About Classroom in a Book
Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book® is part of the official training series

to put the application to work. If you are an experienced user, you’ll find that 
Classroom in a Book teaches many advanced features, including tips and 
techniques for using the latest version of Adobe Illustrator.
Although each lesson provides step-by-step instructions for creating a specific 
project, there’s room for exploration and experimentation. You can follow 
the book from start to finish, or do only the lessons that correspond to your 
interests and needs. Each lesson concludes with a review section summarizing 
what you’ve covered.
Prerequisites
Before beginning to use Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book, you should

 Note:  When instructions differ by platform, Windows commands appear first, and then 
the Mac OS commands, with the platform noted in parentheses. For example, “press the 
Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key and click away from the artwork.” In some instances, 
common commands may be abbreviated with the Windows commands first, followed by a

Restoring default preferences
The preferences file controls how command settings appear on your screen when 
you open the Adobe Illustrator program. Each time you quit Adobe Illustrator, 
the position of the panels and certain command settings are recorded in different 
preference files. If you want to restore the tools and settings to their original default 
settings, you can delete the current Adobe Illustrator CS6 preferences file. Adobe 
Illustrator creates a new preferences file, if one doesn’t already exist, the next time 
you start the program and save a file.
You must restore the default preferences for Illustrator before you begin each 
lesson. This ensures that the tools and panels function as described in this book. 
When you have finished the book, you can restore your saved settings.
To save current Illustrator preferences
1 Exit Adobe Illustrator CS6.
2 Locate the AIPrefs (Windows) or Adobe Illustrator Prefs (Mac OS) file,
as follows.
• 
(Windows XP SP3) The AIPrefs file is located in the folder [startup drive]\
Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Adobe\Adobe 
Illustrator CS6 Settings\en_US*\x86 or x64.
• 
(Windows Vista or Windows 7) The AIPrefs file is located in the folder 
[startup drive]\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe 
Illustrator CS6 Settings\en_US*\x86 or x64.
• 
(Mac OS 10.6 and 10.7**) The Adobe Illustrator Prefs file is located in 
the folder [startup drive]/Users/[username]/Library/Preferences/Adobe 
Illustrator CS6 Settings/en_US*.
*Folder name may be different depending on the language version you have installed.

are completed.
 Tip:  The Adobe Application Manager dialog box shows all of the Adobe updates for installed 
applications, independent of the Adobe application from which it is invoked (Illustrator in this case). 
You can choose to update other Adobe applications too (if their corresponding update is available) 
from the dialog box.
3 When you are finished investigating updates, close the window and return
to Illustrator.

8  What’s New In Adobe Illustrator CS6
WHAT’S NEW IN ADOBE 
ILLUSTRATOR CS6
Adobe Illustrator CS6 is packed with new and innovative features to help you 
produce artwork more efficiently for print, web, and digital video publication. In 
this section, you’ll learn about many of these new features—how they function and 
how you can use them in your work.
Efficient, flexible interface
Over 40 new enhancements to the Illustrator user interface (UI) make working with 
your favorite tools smoother, more efficient, and more intuitive. 
The tools, panels, and controls are still where you expect them, but daily tasks take 
fewer steps and your interactions are faster and more direct—from inline editing 
of layer names to navigating the font menu. Panel updates include expandable 
color-sampling areas and hex-value editing in the Color panel. You can edit names 
of layers, styles, and swatches directly in the panel, and the Character panel shows 
glyphs previously requiring multiple clicks to access.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  9
Adjustable user interface brightness
Use adjustable UI brightness to set your working preference for every day or for a 
particular project. Match the look of your video tools or Adobe Photoshop CS6, or 
simply use it to put the visual focus on your artwork.
Image Trace
A completely new tracing engine in Illustrator CS6 makes the conversion of raster 
images to editable vector artwork easy and clean. Get sharper lines, with better 
shape fitting and more accurate color selection than with the Live Trace feature, 
introduced in CS2. Image Trace provides many of the same benefits but with far 
better results, produced more quickly, using intuitive, easy controls. No more 
struggling with complex options.

10  What’s New In Adobe Illustrator CS6
Pattern creation
Easily create and edit seamlessly tiled vector patterns. Freely experiment with 
various types of layout or precisely control tiling and overlaps with automatically 
seamless repeats.
Mercury Performance System
The underlying power of the new Illustrator CS6 is apparent in many different 
ways. Native 64-bit support on Mac OS and Windows provides access to all the 
available RAM on your system. Overall performance optimization is apparent when 
you open, save, and export large files. Previews are faster, and interaction in general 
is more responsive.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  11
Gradients on strokes
Design creatively with gradients on strokes that can be applied along the length, 
across the width, or within a stroke. Transform a simple path into a visually 
complex and compelling shape. With complete control over gradient placement 
and opacity, you can use strokes rather than fills to create sophisticated artwork.
Other enhancements
•	 Transform panel—Quickly access the critical Scale Strokes & Effects option 
right in the Transform panel. Scale Strokes & Effects is now also available in the 
updated Transform Effect panel.
•	 Transparency panel—Create opacity masks and work with them more easily, 
thanks to new Make Mask and Release buttons. All of the Illustrator masking 
functionality is now exposed in the Transparency panel.
•	 Control panel—Find what you need right when you need it, using a more 
efficient Control panel with increased consistency across options—no matter 
what the context, including placement of anchor point controls, clipping masks, 
envelope distortions, and more.
•	 Improved Gaussian Blur—The Gaussian Blur effect has been specifically 
optimized for speed, improving the performance of drop shadows and glows, 
and live preview while applying or editing the effect has also been added.
Although this list touches on just a few of the new and enhanced features of 
Illustrator CS6, it exemplifies Adobe’s commitment to providing the best 
tools possible for your publishing needs. We hope you enjoy working with 
Illustrator CS6 as much as we do.

GETTING TO KNOW THE 
WORK AREA
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll explore the workspace and learn how to do
the following:
• Open an Adobe Illustrator CS6 file.
• Adjust the user interface brightness.
• Work with the Tools panel.
• Work with panels.
• Reset and save your workspace.
• Use viewing options to enlarge and reduce artwork.
• Navigate multiple artboards and documents.
• Understand rulers.
• Explore document groups.
• Use Illustrator Help.
This lesson takes approximately 45 minutes to complete. If needed, 
remove the previous lesson folder from your hard disk and copy the 
Lesson01 folder onto it.

33
To make the best use of the extensive 
drawing, painting, and editing capabilities of 
Adobe Illustrator CS6, it’s important to learn how to 
navigate the workspace. The workspace consists of the 
Application bar, the menus, Tools panel, Control panel, 
Document window, and the default set of panels.

34 
LESSON 1 
Getting to Know the Work Area
Getting started
You’ll be working in multiple art files during this lesson, but before you begin, 
restore the default preferences for Adobe Illustrator CS6. Then, open the finished 
art file for this lesson to see an illustration.
1 To ensure that the tools and panels function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CS6 preferences file. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 3.
	Note:  If you have not already done so, copy the Lesson01 folder from the Lessons folder on the 
Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book CD onto your hard disk. See “Copying the Classroom in a 
Book files” on page 2.
2 Double-click the Adobe Illustrator CS6 icon to start Adobe Illustrator.
3 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials to ensure that the workspace is 
set to the default settings.
	Note:  If you don’t see “Reset Essentials” in the Workspace menu, choose Window > Workspace > 
Essentials before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
4 Choose File > Open to open the L1start_1.ai file. In the Lesson01 folder in the 
Lessons folder on your hard disk, select the L1start_1.ai file and click Open.
5 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
Choosing to fit the artboard in the window fits the active artboard into the 
Document window so that you can see the entire artboard.
The artwork file contains the front and back of a brochure.
 Note:  Due to the 
differences in Color 
Settings from one 
system to another, a 
Missing Profile dialog 
box may appear as you 
open various exercise 
files. Click OK if you see 
this dialog box.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  35
When the file is open and Illustrator is fully launched, the Application bar, 
menus, Tools panel, Control panel, and panel groups appear on the screen. 
Docked on the right side of the screen, you will see the default panels that 
appear as icons. Illustrator also consolidates many of your most frequently 
accessed options in the Control panel below the menu bar. This lets you work 
with fewer visible panels and gives you a larger area in which to work.
You will use the L1start_1.ai file to practice navigating, zooming, and investigating 
an Illustrator document and the workspace.
6 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, name the file brochure.ai 
and save it in the Lesson01 folder. Leave the Save As Type option set to Adobe 
Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows), or leave the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator 
(ai) (Mac OS). Click Save. If a warning dialog box appears referencing spot 
colors and transparency, click Continue. In the Illustrator Options dialog box, 
leave the options at their default settings and click OK.
 Note:  The Illustrator Options dialog box contains options that can control how the file is saved, 
allow you to save to a previous version of Illustrator, and more.
Why use Adobe Illustrator?
Vector graphics (sometimes called vector shapes or vector objects) are made up  
of lines and curves defined by mathematical objects called vectors, which describe 
an image according to its geometric characteristics. You’ll learn more about lines 
and curves in Lesson 5, “Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools.”
You can freely move or modify vector graphics without losing detail or clarity, 
because they are resolution-independent—they maintain crisp edges when resized, 
printed to a PostScript printer, saved in a PDF file, or imported into a vector-based 
graphics application. As a result, vector graphics are the best choice for artwork, 
such as logos, that will be used at various sizes and in various output media.
The vector objects you create using the drawing and shape tools in Adobe 
Illustrator and the Adobe Creative Suite® are examples of vector graphics.

LESSON 1 
Getting to Know the Work Area
Understanding the workspace
You create and manipulate your documents and files using various elements 
such as panels, bars, and windows. Any arrangement of these elements is called a 
workspace. When you first start Illustrator, you see the default workspace, which 
you can customize for the tasks you perform. You can create and save multiple 
workspaces—one for editing and another for viewing, for example—and switch 
between them as you work. Below, the areas of the default workspace are described:
A.	 The Application bar across the top contains a workspace switcher, a menu bar 
(Windows only, depending on screen resolution), and application controls.
	Note:  For the Mac OS, the menu items appear above the Application bar.
B.	 The Control panel displays options for the currently selected object.
C.	 Panels help you monitor and modify your work. Certain panels are displayed 
by default, but you can add any panel by choosing it from the Window menu. 
Many panels have menus with panel-specific options. Panels can be grouped, 
stacked, docked, or free-floating.
D.	 The Tools panel contains tools for creating and editing images, artwork, page 
elements, and more. Related tools are grouped together.
E.	 The Document window displays the file you’re working on.
F.	 The Status bar appears at the lower-left edge of the Document window. It 
displays information and navigation controls.
 Note:  The figures 
in this lesson are taken 
using the Windows 
operating system 
and may look slightly 
different from what you 
see, especially if you are 
using the Mac OS.
C. Panels
E. Document window
F. Status bar
D. Tools panel
B. Control panel

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  37
Adjusting the user interface brightness
Similar to Adobe After Effects® or Adobe Photoshop CS6, Illustrator supports 
a brightness adjustment for the application user interface. This is a program 
preference setting that allows you to choose a brightness setting from four preset 
levels or to specify a custom value.
In this section, you will change the setting to see its effect, and then you will change 
it back to the program default.
1 Choose Edit > Preferences > User Interface (Windows) or Illustrator > 
Preferences > User Interface (Mac OS).
2 Choose Light from the Brightness menu of the User Interface options.
You can adjust the brightness of the user interface using set options in the 
Brightness menu.
3 Drag the Brightness slider to the left until you see a value of 50%.
You can drag the Brightness slider beneath the Brightness menu to the left or to 
the right to adjust the overall brightness using a custom value.
4 Choose Medium Dark from the Brightness menu.

1 Position the pointer over the Selection tool ( ) in 
the Tools panel. Notice that the name and keyboard 
shortcut are displayed.
 Tip:  You can turn the tool tips on or off by choosing Edit > 
Preferences > General (Windows) or Illustrator > Preferences > 
General (Mac OS) and deselecting Show Tool Tips.
2 Position the pointer over the 
Direct Selection tool ( ) and 
click and hold down the mouse 
button. You’ll see additional 
selection tools. Drag to the 
right. Release the mouse button 
over the additional tool to select it. 
Any tool in the Tools panel that displays a small triangle contains additional 
tools that can be selected in this way. 
 Tip:  You can also select hidden tools by pressing the Alt key (Windows) or the Option key 
(Mac OS) and clicking the tool in the Tools panel. Each click selects the next hidden tool in the 
hidden tool sequence.
3 Click and hold down the 
mouse button on the Rectangle 
tool (
). Drag the pointer 
over the arrow at the end of 
the hidden tools panel, and 
release the mouse button. This 
separates the tools from the 
Tools panel so that you can 
access them at all times.
4 Click the Close button (X) 
in the upper-right corner 
(Windows) or upper-left 
corner (Mac OS) on the 
floating tool panel’s title bar to 
close it. The tools return to the Tools panel.
Next, you’ll learn how to resize and float the Tools panel.
5 Click the double arrow in the upper-left corner 
of the Tools panel to collapse the two columns 
into one column, which conserves screen space. 
Click the double arrow again to expand to
two columns.
 Tip:  Because the 
default keyboard 
shortcuts work only 
when you do not have 
a text insertion point, 
you can also add other 
keyboard shortcuts to 
select tools, even when 
you are editing text. To 
do this, choose Edit > 
Keyboard Shortcuts. For 
more information, see 
“Keyboard Shortcuts” in 
Illustrator Help.
 Tip:  You can also 
collapse the floating 
tool panels or dock 
them to the workspace 
or each other.

Exploring the Control panel
The Control panel is context-sensitive, meaning that it offers quick access to 
options, commands, and other panels relevant to the currently selected object(s). 
You can click text that is underlined to display a related panel. For example, click 
the underlined word Stroke to display the Stroke panel. By default, the Control 
panel is docked at the top of the application window (Windows) or screen (Mac 
OS); however, you can dock it at the bottom, float it, or hide it altogether.
1 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and click the middle of the 
reddish bar close to the center of the page.
Notice that information for that object appears in the Control panel, including 
the word “Path,” color options, Stroke, and more.
2 With any tool, drag the gripper bar (the dashed line along the left edge) of the 
Control panel into the workspace. 
Once the Control panel is free-floating, you can drag the dark gray gripper 
bar that appears on the left edge of the Control panel to move it to the top or 
bottom of the workspace.

42 
LESSON 1 
Getting to Know the Work Area
3 Drag the Control panel by the dark gray gripper bar on the left end to the 
bottom of the application window (Windows) or screen (Mac OS). When the 
pointer reaches the bottom of the Application window (Windows) or screen 
(Mac OS), a blue line appears, indicating the drop zone in which it will be 
docked when you release the mouse button.
4 Drag the Control panel to the top of the Document window by the gripper 
bar on the left end of the panel. When the pointer reaches the bottom of the 
Application bar, a blue line appears indicating the drop zone. When you release 
the mouse button, the panel is docked.
5 Choose Select > Deselect so that the path is no longer selected.
Working with panels
Panels, which are located in the Window menu, give you quick access to many tools 
that make modifying artwork easier. By default, some panels are docked and appear 
as icons on the right side of the workspace. Next, you’ll experiment with hiding, 
closing, and opening panels.
1 First, choose Reset Essentials from the workspace 
switcher in the upper-right corner of the 
Application bar to reset the panels to their 
original location.
 Tip:  You can also choose Window > Workspace > Reset 
Essentials to reset the panels.
2 Click the Swatches panel icon (
) on the right 
side of the workspace to expand the panel, or 
choose Window > Swatches. Notice that the Swatches panel appears with two 
other panels—the Brushes panel and Symbols panel. They are all part of the 
same panel group. Click the Symbols panel tab to view the Symbols panel.
 Tip:  You can also 
dock the Control panel 
by choosing Dock To 
Top or Dock To Bottom 
from the Control panel 
menu on the right  
side of the Control 
panel (
).
 Tip:  To move 
the Control panel 
back to the top of 
the workspace, you 
can also choose 
Window > Workspace > 
Reset Essentials. This 
resets the Essentials 
workspace. You’ll learn 
more about resetting 
workspaces later in  
the lesson.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  43
3 Now click the Color panel icon (
). Notice that a new panel group appears, 
and the panel group that contained the Swatches panel collapses.
4 Click and drag the gripper bar at the bottom 
of the Color panel down to resize the panel, 
showing more of the color spectrum.
5 Click the Color panel icon (
) to collapse the 
panel group.
 Tip:  To find a hidden panel, choose the panel name from 
the Window menu. A check mark to the left of the panel 
name indicates that the panel is already open and in front of 
other panels in its panel group. If you choose a panel name 
that is already selected in the Window menu, the panel and 
its group collapses.
6 Click the double arrow at the top of the dock to 
expand the panels. Click the double arrow again to 
collapse the panels. Use this method to show more than one panel group at a time. 
Your panels may look different when expanded, and that’s okay.
Click to expand.	
Click to collapse.	
The dock collapsed.
 Tip:  To expand or collapse the panel dock, you can also double-click the panel dock title bar at 
the top.
7 To increase the width of all the panels in the dock, drag the left edge of the 
docked panels to the left until text appears. To decrease the width, click and 
drag the left edge of the docked panels to the right until the text disappears.
8 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials to reset the workspace.
 Tip:  To collapse a 
panel back to an icon, 
you can click its tab, 
its icon, or the double 
arrow in the panel  
title bar.

44 
LESSON 1 
Getting to Know the Work Area
9 Drag the Swatches panel icon (
) to remove the panel from the dock and make 
it a free-floating panel. Notice that the panel stays collapsed as an icon when it 
is free-floating. Click the double arrow in the Swatches panel title bar to expand 
the panel so you can see its contents.
You can also move panels from one panel group to another. In this way you can 
create custom panel groups that contain the panels you use most often.
 Tip:  To close a panel, drag the panel away from the dock and click the X in the panel title bar. 
You can also right-click or Ctrl-click a docked panel tab and choose Close from the menu.
10 Drag the Swatches panel by the panel tab, the panel title bar, or the area behind 
the panel tab onto the Brushes and Symbols panel icons. Release the mouse 
button when you see a blue outline around the Brushes panel group.
Next, you’ll organize the panels to create more room in your workspace.
11 Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar, to 
make sure that the panels are reset to their default state.
12 Click the double arrow at the top of the dock to expand the panels. Click the 
Color Guide panel tab to make sure it’s selected. Double-click the panel tab to 
reduce the size of the panel. Double-click the tab again to minimize the panel. 
This can also be done when a panel is free-floating (not docked).
 Note:  Many panels only require that you double-click the panel tab twice to return to the full-
size view of the panel. If you double-click one more time, the panel fully expands.
 Tip:  Press Tab to 
hide all panels. Press 
Tab again to show 
them all again. You can 
hide or show all panels 
except for the Tools 
and Control panels by 
pressing Shift+Tab to 
hide and Shift+Tab 
to show.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  45
 Tip:  To reduce and expand the panel size, instead of double-clicking the panel tab, you can click 
the small arrow icon to the left of the panel name in the panel tab, if present.
13 Click the Appearance panel tab to expand that panel. Depending on your screen 
resolution, it may already be expanded.
Next, you will resize a panel group, which can make it easier to see more
important panels.
14 Click the Symbols panel tab. Drag the 
dividing line between the Symbols panel 
group and the Stroke panel group up to 
resize the group.
 Note:  You may not be able to drag the divider very 
far, depending on your screen size, screen resolution, 
and number of panels expanded.
15 Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace 
switcher in the Application bar.
Next, you’ll arrange panel groups. Panel groups can be docked, undocked, and 
arranged in either collapsed or expanded modes.
16 Choose Window > Align to open the Align panel group. Drag the title bar of 
the Align panel group to the docked panels on the right side of the workspace. 
Position the pointer below the group that the Symbols panel icon (
) is in so 
that a single blue line appears. Release the mouse button to create a new group 
in the dock.
 Note:  If you drag a 
group into the dock and 
drop it into an existing 
group, the two groups 
merge. Reset the 
workspace and open 
the panel group to  
try again.

46 
LESSON 1 
Getting to Know the Work Area
Next, you will drag a panel from one group to another in the docked panels.
17 Drag the Transform panel icon (
) up so 
that the pointer is just below the Color 
panel icon (
). A blue line appears 
between the Color panel icon and the 
Color Guide panel icon, outlining the 
Color panel group in blue. Release the 
mouse button.
Arranging the panels in groups can help 
you work faster.
Resetting and saving your workspace
You can reset your panels and Tools panel to their default position, which you’ve 
been doing throughout this lesson. You can also save the position of panels so that 
you can easily access them at any time by creating a workspace. Next, you will 
create a workspace to access a group of commonly used panels.
1 Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar.
2 Choose Window > Pathfinder. Click and drag the Pathfinder panel tab to the 
right side of the workspace. When the pointer approaches the left edge of the 
docked panels, a blue line appears. Release the mouse button to dock the panel. 
Click the Close button (X) in the upper-right corner (Windows) or upper-left 
corner (Mac OS) to close the remaining panel group, which contains the Align 
and Transform panels.
3 Choose Window > Workspace > New Workspace. Change the Name to 
Navigation in the New Workspace dialog box, and click OK. The workspace 
named Navigation is now saved with Illustrator until you remove it.
4 Choose Window > Workspace > Essentials, and then choose Window > 
Workspace > Reset Essentials. Notice that the panels return to their default 
positions. Choose Window > Workspace > Navigation. Toggle between the 
two workspaces using the Window > Workspace command, and return to the 
Essentials workspace before starting the next exercise.
 Tip:  You can also 
reorder entire panel 
groups in the dock by 
dragging the double 
gray line at the top of 
each panel group up 
or down.
 Tip:  Docking panels 
next to each other on 
the right side of the 
workspace is a great 
way to conserve space. 
A docked panel can 
also be collapsed and 
resized to conserve 
even more space.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  47
 Note:  To delete saved workspaces, choose Window > Workspace > Manage Workspaces. Select 
the workspace name, and click the Delete Workspace button.
 Tip:  To change a saved workspace, reset the panels as you’d like them to appear and then 
choose Window > Workspace > New Workspace. In the New Workspace dialog box, name the 
workspace with the original name. A message appears in the dialog box warning that you will 
overwrite an existing workspace with the same name if you click OK. Click OK.
Using panel menus
Most panels have a panel menu in the upper-right corner. Clicking the panel menu 
button (
) gives you access to additional options for the selected panel, including 
changing the panel display in some cases.
Next, you will change the display of the Symbols panel using its panel menu.
1 Click the Symbols panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace. You can 
also choose Window > Symbols to display this panel.
2 Click the panel menu button (
) in the upper-right corner of the Symbols panel.
3 Choose Small List View from the panel menu. 
This displays the symbol names, together with thumbnails. Because the options 
in the panel menu apply only to the active panel, only the Symbols panel view 
is affected.
4 Click the Symbols panel menu and choose Thumbnail View, to return the symbols 
to their original view. Click the Symbols panel tab to hide the panel again.
In addition to the panel menus, context-sensitive menus display commands 
relevant to the active tool, selection, or panel.
5 Position the pointer over the Document window or a panel. 
Then, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) to show a 
context menu with specific options.
The context-sensitive menu shown here is displayed when 
you right-click (Windows) or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) the 
artboard with nothing selected.
	Note:  If you position the pointer over a panel, like the Swatches panel, and 
right-click (Windows) or Ctrl-click (Mac OS), you can close a panel or a panel 
group in the context menu that appears.

48 
LESSON 1 
Getting to Know the Work Area
Changing the view of artwork 
When working in files, it’s likely that you’ll need to change the magnification level 
and navigate between artboards. The magnification level, which can range from 
3.13% to 6400%, is displayed in the title bar (or document tab) next to the file name 
and in the lower-left corner of the Document window. Using any of the viewing 
tools and commands affects only the display of the artwork, not the actual size of 
the artwork.
Using the view commands 
To enlarge or reduce the view of artwork using the View menu, do one of 
the following: 
• Choose View > Zoom In to enlarge the display of the brochure.ai artwork.
 Tip:  Zoom in using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl++ (Windows) or Command++ (Mac OS).
• Choose View > Zoom Out to reduce the view of the brochure.ai artwork.
 Tip:  Zoom out using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+– (Windows) or Command+–(Mac OS) .
Each time you choose a Zoom option, the view of the artwork is resized to the 
closest preset zoom level. The preset zoom levels appear in a menu in the lower-left 
corner of the Document window, identified by a down arrow next to a percentage.
You can also use the View menu to fit the artwork for the active artboard to your 
screen, to fit all artboards into the view area, or to view artwork at actual size.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window. A reduced view of the active artboard 
is displayed in the window.
 Note:  Because the canvas (the area outside the artboards) extends to 227", you can easily 
lose sight of your illustration. By choosing View > Fit Artboard In Window, or using the keyboard 
shortcuts Ctrl+0 (Windows) or Command+0 (Mac OS), artwork is centered in the viewing area.
2 To display artwork at actual size, choose View > Actual Size.
The artwork is displayed at 100%. The actual size of your artwork determines 
how much of it can be viewed on-screen at 100%.
 Tip:  You can also double-click the Zoom tool in the Tools panel to display artwork at 100%.
3 Choose View > Fit All In Window.
You will see all artboards in the document displayed in the Document window. 
You can learn more about navigating artboards in the section “Navigating 
multiple artboards,” later in this lesson.
4 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window before continuing to the next section.
 Tip:  You can also 
double-click the Hand 
tool in the Tools panel 
to fit the active  
artboard in the 
Document window.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  49
Using the Zoom tool
In addition to the View menu options, you can use the Zoom tool (
) to magnify 
and reduce the view of artwork to predefined magnification levels.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and then move the pointer into the 
Document window. 
Notice that a plus sign (+) appears at the center of the Zoom tool pointer.
2 Position the Zoom tool over the title text 
“Created with...” in the center of the artboard, and 
click once. The artwork is displayed at a 
higher magnification.
3 Click two more times on the “Created with...” text. 
The view is increased again, and you’ll notice that 
the area you clicked is magnified. 
Next, you’ll reduce the view of the artwork.
4 With the Zoom tool still selected, position the pointer over the text “Created 
with...” and hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key. A minus 
sign (–) appears at the center of the Zoom tool pointer. Continue holding the 
key down for the next step.
5 With the Alt or Option key pressed, click the artwork twice to reduce the view 
of the artwork.
For a more controlled zoom, you can drag a marquee around a specific area of your 
artwork. This magnifies only the selected area.
6 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
7 With the Zoom tool still selected, click and drag a marquee around the Uncle 
Henry’s Farm logo in the lower-right corner of the artboard. When you see 
the marquee around the area you are dragging, release the mouse button. The 
marqueed area is now enlarged to fit the size of the Document window.
8 Double-click the Hand tool (
) in the Tools panel to fit the artboard in the 
Document window.
 Note:  The percent 
of the magnification is 
determined by the size 
of the marquee you 
draw with the Zoom 
tool—the smaller the 
marquee, the higher the 
level of magnification. 

50 
LESSON 1 
Getting to Know the Work Area
The Zoom tool is used frequently during the editing process to enlarge and reduce 
the view of artwork. Because of this, Illustrator allows you to select it using the 
keyboard at any time without first deselecting any other tool you may be using.
9 Before selecting the Zoom tool using the keyboard, select any other tool in the 
Tools panel and move the pointer into the Document window.
10 Now hold down Control+spacebar (Windows) or Command+spacebar (Mac 
OS) to use the Zoom tool. Click or drag to zoom in on any area of the artwork, 
and then release the keys.
11 To zoom out using the keyboard, hold down Control+Alt+spacebar (Windows) 
or Command+Option+spacebar (Mac OS). Click the desired area to reduce the 
view of the artwork, and then release the keys.
12 Double-click the Hand tool in the Tools panel to fit the artboard in the 
Document window.
Scrolling through a document 
You can use the Hand tool to pan to different areas of a document. Using the Hand 
tool allows you to push the document around much like you would a piece of paper 
on your desk.
1 Select the Hand tool (
) in the Tools panel.
2 Drag down in the Document window. As you drag, the artwork moves with
the hand.
As with the Zoom tool (
), you can select the Hand tool with a keyboard shortcut 
without first deselecting the active tool.
3 Click any other tool except the Type tool (
) in the Tools panel, and move the 
pointer into the Document window.
4 Hold down the spacebar to select the Hand tool from the keyboard, and then 
drag to bring the artwork back into the center of your view.
5 Double-click the Hand tool to fit the active artboard in the Document window.
 Note:  The spacebar shortcut for the Hand tool does not work when the Type tool is active and 
your cursor is in text.
 Note:  In certain 
versions of Mac OS, the 
keyboard shortcuts for 
the Zoom tool (steps 10 
and 11) open Spotlight 
or Finder. If you decide 
to use these shortcuts 
in Illustrator, you may 
want to turn off or 
change those keyboard 
shortcuts in the Mac OS 
System Preferences.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  51
Viewing artwork
When you open a file, it is automatically displayed in Preview mode, which 
shows how the artwork will print. When you’re working with large or complex 
illustrations, you may want to view only the outlines, or wireframes, of objects in 
your artwork so that the screen doesn’t have to redraw the artwork each time you 
make a change. This is called Outline mode. Outline mode can be helpful when 
selecting objects, as you will see in Lesson 3, “Creating and Editing Shapes.”
1 Choose View > Logo Zoom (at the bottom of the View menu) to zoom in to a 
preset area of the image. This custom view was saved with the document.
	Tip:  To save time when working with large or complex documents, you can create your own 
custom views within a document so that you can quickly jump to specific areas and zoom levels. Set 
up the view that you want to save, and then choose View > New View. Name the view, and click OK; 
it is saved with the document. 
2 Choose View > Outline.
Only the outlines of the objects are displayed. Use this view to find objects that 
might not be visible in Preview mode.
3 Choose View > Preview to see all the attributes of the artwork.
If you prefer keyboard shortcuts, use Control+Y (Windows) or Command+Y 
(Mac OS) to toggle between Preview and Outline modes.
4 Choose View > Overprint Preview to view any lines or shapes that are set
to overprint. 
This view is helpful for those in the print industry who need to see how inks 
interact when set to overprint. You may not actually see much of a change in 
the logo when you change to this mode.
	Note:  When switching between viewing modes, visual changes may not be readily apparent. 
Zooming in and out (View > Zoom In and View > Zoom Out) may help you see the differences
more easily.
5 Choose View > Pixel Preview to see how the artwork will look when it is 
rasterized and viewed on-screen in a web browser. Choose View > Pixel Preview 
to deselect pixel preview.

LESSON 1 
Getting to Know the Work Area
Navigating multiple artboards
Illustrator allows for multiple artboards within a single file. This is a great way to 
create a multi-page document so that you can have collateral pieces like a brochure, 
a postcard, and a business card in the same document. You can easily share content 
between pieces, create multi-page PDFs, and print multiple pages by creating 
multiple artboards.
Multiple artboards can be added when you initially create an Illustrator document 
by choosing File > New. You can also add or remove artboards after the document 
is created using the Artboard tool in the Tools panel.
Next, you will learn how to efficiently navigate a document with multiple artboards.
1 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel.
2 Choose View > Fit All In Window. Notice that there are two artboards in
the document.
The artboards in a document can be 
arranged in any order, orientation, or 
artboard size–they can even overlap. 
Suppose that you want to create a 
four-page brochure. You can create 
different artboards for every page of 
the brochure, all with the same size 
and orientation. They can be arranged 
horizontally or vertically or in whatever 
way you like.
The brochure.ai document has two artboards, which are the front and back of a 
color brochure.
3 Press Ctrl+– (Windows) or Command+– (Mac OS) until you can see the logo in 
the upper-left corner of the canvas, which is outside the artboards.
4 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
This command fits the currently active artboard in the window. The active 
artboard is identified in the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner 
of the Document window.
5 Choose 2 from the Artboard Navigation 
menu. The back of the brochure appears in the 
Document window.
6 Choose View > Zoom Out. Notice that zooming 
occurs on the currently active artboard.
 Note:  Learn how 
to work more with 
artboards in Lesson 4, 
“Transforming Objects.”

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  53
Notice the arrows to the right and left of the Artboard Navigation menu. You can 
use these to navigate to the first (
), previous (
), next (
), and last (
) artboards.
7 Click the Previous navigation button to view the previous 
artboard (artboard #1) in the Document window.
	Note:  Since there are only two artboards in this document, you could have 
also clicked the First button (
) in this step.
8 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to make sure that the first artboard 
(artboard #1) is fit in the Document window.
Another method for navigating multiple artboards is to use the Artboards panel. 
Next, you will open the Artboards panel and navigate the document.
9 Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar to 
reset the Essentials workspace.
10 Choose Window > Artboards to expand the Artboards panel on the right side of 
the workspace.
The Artboards panel lists all artboards in the document. This panel allows you 
to navigate between artboards, rename artboards, add or delete artboards, edit 
artboard settings, and more.
Next, you will focus on navigating the document using this panel.
11 Double-click the number 2 in the 
Artboards panel. This fits Artboard 2 in 
the Document window.
	Note:  Double-clicking the artboard name in the 
Artboards panel allows you to change the name of 
the artboard. Clicking the artboard icon ( ) to the 
right of the artboard name in the panel allows you 
to edit artboard options.
12 Choose View > Zoom In to zoom in on 
the second artboard.
13 Double-click the 1 to the left of Artboard 1 in the Artboards panel to show the 
first artboard in the Document window.
Notice that when you double-click to navigate to an artboard, that artboard is fit 
in the Document window.

Getting to Know the Work Area
Artboard overview
Artboards represent the regions that can contain printable artwork (similar to  
pages in a program like Adobe InDesign). You can use artboards to crop areas for 
printing or placement purposes. Multiple artboards are useful for creating a variety 
of things such as multiple page PDFs, printed pages with different sizes or different 
elements, independent elements for websites, video storyboards, or individual 
items for animation in Adobe Flash® or Adobe After Effects.

A. Printable area is bounded by the innermost dotted lines and represents the 
portion of the page on which the selected printer can print. Many printers 
cannot print to the edge of the paper. Don’t get confused by what is  
considered nonprintable. 
B. Nonprintable area is between the two sets of dotted lines representing any 
nonprintable margin of the page. This example shows the nonprintable area of 
an 8.5" x 11" page for a standard laser printer. The printable and nonprintable 
area is determined by the printer selected in the Print Options dialog box.
C. Edge of the page is indicated by the outermost set of dotted lines.
D. Artboard is bounded by solid lines and represents the entire region that can 
contain printable artwork.
E. Bleed area is the amount of artwork that falls outside of the printing bounding 
box, or outside the crop area and trim marks. You can include bleed in your 
artwork as a margin of error—to ensure that the ink is still printed to the edge of 
the page after the page is trimmed.
F. Canvas is the area outside the artboard that extends to the edge of the 227" 
square window. Objects placed on the canvas are visible on-screen, but they do 
not print.

 Note:  You can have 
up to 100 artboards per 
document, depending 
on the size of the 
artboards. You can 
specify the number 
of artboards for a 
document when you 
create it, and you 
can add and remove 
artboards at any time 
while working in a 
document. You can 
create artboards of 
different sizes, resize 
them with the Artboard 
tool, and position them 
on the screen—they 
can even overlap
each other.

Using the Navigator panel
The Navigator panel is another way to navigate a document with a single artboard 
or multiple artboards. This is useful when you need to see all artboards in the 
document in one window and edit content in any of those artboards in a zoomed
in view.
1 Choose Window > Navigator to open the Navigator panel. It is free-floating in 
the workspace.
2 In the Navigator panel, drag the slider to the left to approximately 50% to 
decrease the level of magnification. As you drag the slider, the red box in the 
Navigator panel, called the proxy view area, becomes larger, indicating the area 
of the document that is being shown. Depending on the zoom percentage, you 
may or may not see the proxy view area yet, but you will.
3 Click the larger mountain icon (
) in the lower-right corner of the Navigator 
panel several times to zoom in to the brochure until the percentage in the 
Navigator panel shows approximately 150%.
4 Position the pointer inside the proxy view area (the red box) of the Navigator 
panel. The pointer becomes a hand (
).
5 Drag the hand in the proxy view area of the Navigator panel to pan to different 
parts of the artwork. Drag the proxy view area over the logo in the lower-right 
corner of the brochure cover.
 Note:  Dragging the 
slider in the Navigator 
panel tends to jump 
the magnification to set 
values. To zoom more 
precisely, type in a value 
in the lower-left corner 
of the Navigator panel.
 Note:  The 
percentage and proxy 
view area in your 
Navigator panel may 
appear differently. 
That’s okay.

56 
LESSON 1 
Getting to Know the Work Area
6 In the Navigator panel, move the pointer outside of the proxy view area and 
click. This moves the box and displays a different area of the artwork in the 
Document window.
 Tip:  Choosing Panel Options from the Navigator panel menu allows you to customize the 
Navigator panel. For example, you can change the color of the view box.
7 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
8 Deselect View Artboard Contents Only in the 
Navigator panel menu (
) so that you see any 
artwork that is on the canvas as well. Notice the 
logo on the canvas.
 Note:  You may need to adjust the slider in the Navigator 
panel to see the logo in the proxy view area.
9 Close the Navigator panel group by clicking the Close button (X) in the upper-
right corner (Windows) or upper-left corner (Mac OS).
Understanding rulers
Rulers can help you accurately place and measure objects in your document and are 
displayed in each document by default. Horizontal and vertical rulers appear at the 
top and left sides of each Document window. The place where 0 appears on each 
ruler is called the ruler origin.
Next, you will explore the rulers by turning them on and off and noticing where the 
ruler origin is located on each artboard.
1 Choose View > Rulers > Hide Rulers to hide the rulers.
2 Choose View > Rulers > Show Rulers to show them again.
Notice that the 0 for the horizontal ruler is aligned with the left edge of the 
first artboard, and the 0 for the vertical ruler (on the left side of the Document 
window) is aligned with the top edge of the artboard.
3 Navigate to the second artboard by choosing 2 from the Artboard 
Navigation menu.
 Note:  The 
percentage and proxy 
view area in your 
Navigator panel may 
appear differently. 
That’s okay.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  57
Notice that the rulers start at 0 in the upper-left corner in this second artboard 
as well. Each artboard has its own ruler system, with the zeros for horizontal 
and vertical rulers starting in the upper-left corner of each artboard. You 
will learn about changing the zero point and other ruler options in Lesson 4, 
“Transforming Objects.”
4 Navigate back to the first artboard by choosing 1 from the Artboard
Navigation menu.
Arranging multiple documents
When you open more than one Illustrator file, the Document windows are tabbed. 
You can arrange the open documents in other ways, such as side by side, so that 
you can easily compare or drag items from one document to another. You can also 
use the Arrange Documents window to quickly display your open documents in a 
variety of configurations.
Next, you will open several documents.
1 Choose File > Open and, in the Lesson01 folder, Shift-click to select the 
L1start_2.ai and L1start_3.ai files that are located in the Lessons folder on your 
hard disk. Click Open to open both files at once.
You should now have three Illustrator files open: brochure.ai, L1start_2.ai, 
and L1start_3.ai. Each file has its own tab at the top of the Document window. 
These documents are considered a group of Document windows. You can create 
document groups to loosely associate files while they are open.
2 Click the brochure.ai document tab to show the brochure.ai Document window.
3 Click and drag the brochure.ai document tab to the right so that it is between 
the L1start_2.ai and L1start_3.ai document tabs.
Dragging the document tabs allows you to change the order of the documents. 
This can be very useful if you use the document shortcuts to navigate to the next 
or previous document.
	Note:  Your tabs may 
be in a slightly different 
order. That’s okay. Be 
careful to drag directly 
to the right. Otherwise, 
you could undock the 
Document window and 
create a new group. 
If that happens, 
choose Window > 
Arrange > Consolidate 
All Windows.

58 
LESSON 1 
Getting to Know the Work Area
 Tip:  You can cycle between open documents by pressing Ctrl+F6 (next document), Ctrl+Shift+F6 
(previous document) (Windows) or Command+~ (next document), Command+Shift+~ (previous 
document) (Mac OS).
4 Drag the document tabs in the following order, from left to right: brochure.ai, 
L1start_2.ai, L1start_3.ai.
These three documents are versions of marketing pieces. To see all of them at 
one time, you can arrange the Document windows by cascading the windows or 
tiling them. Cascading allows you to cascade (stack) different document groups 
and is discussed further in the next section. Tiling shows multiple Document 
windows at one time, in various arrangements.
Next, you will tile the open documents so that you can see them all at one time.
5 On the Mac OS (Windows users can skip to the next step), choose Window > 
Application Frame. Then, click the green button in the upper-left corner of the 
Application window so that the it fits as well as possible.
Mac OS users can use the Application frame to group all the workspace 
elements in a single, integrated window, similar to working in Windows. If you 
move or resize the Application frame, the elements respond to each other so 
that they don’t overlap.
6 Choose Window > Arrange > Tile.
This shows all three Document windows arranged in a pattern.
7 Click in each of the Document windows to activate the documents. Choose 
View > Fit Artboard In Window for each of the documents. Also, make sure 
that artboard #1 is showing for each document in the Document window.
With documents tiled, you can drag the dividing lines between each of the 
Document windows to reveal more or less of a particular document. You can also 
drag objects between documents to copy them from one document to another.
 Note:  Your 
documents may be 
tiled in a different order. 
That’s okay.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  59
8 Click in the L1start_3.ai Document window. With the Selection tool, drag the 
wagon wheel image (behind the pumpkins on the artboard) to the L1start_2.ai 
Document window and release the mouse button. This copies the image from 
L1start_3.ai to L1start_2.ai.
 Note:  After dragging the content in step 8, notice that the document tab for L1start_2.ai now 
has an asterisk to the right of the file name. This indicates that the file needs to be saved.
 Note:  When you drag content between tiled documents, a plus sign (+) appears next to the 
pointer, as shown in the figure below. Depending on your operating system, the pointer may 
look different.
To change the arrangement of the tiled windows, it’s possible to drag document 
tabs to new positions. However, it’s easier to use the Arrange Documents window 
to quickly arrange open documents in a variety of configurations.
9 Click the Arrange Documents button 
(
) in the Application bar to display the 
Arrange Documents window. Click the 
Tile All Vertically button (
) to tile the 
documents vertically.
	Note:  On the Mac OS, the menu bar is above the 
Application bar. Also, depending on the resolution of 
your screen, the Windows menus may appear in the 
Application bar.
10 Click the Arrange Documents button (
) in the Application bar to display the 
Arrange Documents window again. Click the 2-Up vertical button (
) in the 
Arrange Documents window.
Notice that two of the documents appear as tabs in one of the tiled areas.

Getting to Know the Work Area
11 Click to select the L1start_2.ai tab if it is not already selected. Then, click the 
Close button (X) on the L1start_2.ai document tab to close the document. If 
a dialog box appears asking you to save the document, click No (Windows) or 
Don’t Save (Mac OS).
12 Click the Arrange Documents button (
) in the Application bar, and click the 
Consolidate All button (
) in the Arrange Documents window. This returns 
the two documents to tabs in the same group. Keep the brochure.ai and 
L1start_3.ai documents open.
Exploring document groups
By default, open documents in Illustrator are arranged as tabs in a single group 
of windows. You can create multiple groups of files for easier navigation and 
temporarily associate files together. This can be helpful if you are working on 
a large project that requires you to create and edit multiple pieces. Grouping 
documents lets you float the groups so that they are separate from the application 
window (Windows) or screen (Mac OS).
Next, you will create and work with two groups of files.
1 Click to select the L1start_3.ai file tab, if not already selected.
2 Choose Window > Arrange > Float All In Windows. This creates separate 
groups for all open documents. By default, the groups are cascaded with one on 
top of the other.
Document windows floating in separate groups
3 Click the title bar for brochure.ai, and notice that L1start_3.ai is not visible.
L1start_3.ai is now behind brochure.ai.
4  Choose File > Open and, in the Lesson01 folder, select the L1start_2.ai file, 
which is located in the Lessons folder on your hard disk. Click Open. Notice 
that the newly opened document is added as a document tab to the group that 
contains brochure.ai.
 Note:  When you open a document or create a new document, that document is added to the 
currently selected group.
5 Choose Window > Arrange > Cascade to reveal both groups.
6 Click the Minimize button in the upper-right corner (Windows) or the upper-
left corner (Mac OS) of the L1start_3.ai group.
 Tip:  You can also 
choose Window > 
Arrange > Consolidate 
All Windows to return 
the two documents to 
tabs in the same group.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  61
	Note:  If you cannot select the L1start_3.ai group, choose Window > L1start_3.ai at the bottom of 
the Window menu.
7 Choose Window > L1start_3.ai to show the document again.
8 Click the Close box (Windows) or Close button (Mac OS) to close the 
L1start_3.ai group. If a dialog box appears asking you to save the document, 
click No (Windows) or Don’t Save (Mac OS).
9 Drag the document tab for L1start_2.ai down until the document appears to 
float freely. This is another way to create a floating group of documents.
10 Close the L1start_2.ai file, and leave brochure.ai open. If a dialog box appears 
asking you to save the document, click No (Windows) or Don’t Save (Mac OS).
11 On Windows (Mac OS users can skip to the next step), choose Window > 
Arrange > Consolidate All Windows.
12 On the Mac OS, choose Window > Application Frame to deselect the 
Application frame.
13 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to fit the first artboard of brochure.ai in

2 SELECTING AND ALIGNING
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Differentiate between the various selection tools and employ 
different selection techniques.
• Recognize Smart Guides.
• Save selections for future use.
• Use tools and commands to align shapes and points to each other 
and the artboard.
• Group and ungroup items.
• Work in Isolation mode.
• Arrange content.
• Select behind content.
• Copy items with the Selection tool.
• Hide and lock items for organizational purposes.
This lesson takes approximately an hour to complete. If needed, remove 
the previous lesson folder from your hard disk and copy the Lesson02 
folder onto it.

65
Selecting content in Adobe Illustrator is one of the 
more important things you’ll do. In this lesson, you 
learn how to locate and select objects using the 
selection tools; protect other objects by grouping, 
hiding, and locking them; align objects to each other 
and the artboard; and much more.

66 
LESSON 2 
Selecting and Aligning
Getting started
When changing colors or size and adding effects or attributes, you must first select 
the object to which you are applying the changes. In this lesson, you will learn the 
fundamentals of using the selection tools. More advanced selection techniques 
using layers are discussed in Lesson 8, “Working with Layers.”
1 To ensure that the tools and panels function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CS6 preferences file. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 3.
2 Start Adobe Illustrator CS6.
	Note:  If you have not already done so, copy the Lesson02 folder from the Lessons folder on the 
Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book CD onto your hard disk. See “Copying the Classroom in a 
Book files” on page 2.
3 Choose File > Open, and open the L2start_1.ai file in 
the Lesson02 folder, located in the Lessons folder on 
your hard disk. Choose View > Fit Artboard

4 Choose Window > Workspace > Essentials, make sure 
it’s selected, and then choose Window > Workspace > 
Reset Essentials to reset the workspace.
Selecting objects
Whether you are starting artwork from scratch or editing existing artwork in 
Illustrator, you will need to become familiar with selecting objects. There are many 
methods and tools for selecting objects, and in this section, you will explore the 
main selection tools, including the Selection and Direct Selection tools.
Using the Selection tool
The Selection tool in the Tools panel lets you select entire objects.
1 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, if it’s not already selected. 
Position the pointer over different shapes without clicking. The icon that appears 
as you pass over objects (
) indicates that there is an object that can be selected 
under the pointer. When you hover over an object, it is also outlined in blue.
2 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and drag a marquee around the 
four colored shapes (the apples and hat) in the center of the page, to zoom in.
3 Select the Selection tool, and then position the pointer over the edge of the red 
apple on the left. A word such as “path” or “anchor” may appear, because Smart 
Guides are turned on by default. Smart Guides are snap‑to guides that help you 
	Note:  In Mac OS, 
when opening lesson 
files, you may need to 
click the round, green 
button in the upper-left 
corner of the Document 
window to maximize 
the window’s size.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  67
align, edit, and transform objects or artboards. Smart Guides are discussed in 
more detail in Lesson 3, “Creating and Editing Shapes.”
4 Click the left red apple on its edge or anywhere in its center to select it. A 
bounding box with eight handles appears.
The bounding box is used when making changes to objects, such as resizing 
or rotating them. The bounding box also indicates that an item is selected and 
ready to be modified. The color of the bounding box indicates which layer the 
object is on. Layers are discussed more in Lesson 8, “Working with Layers.”
5 Using the Selection tool, click the red apple on the right. Notice that the left red 
apple is now deselected and only the right apple is selected.
6 Hold down the Shift key, and click the left red apple to add it to the selection. 
Both red apples are now selected.
7 Reposition the apples anywhere in the document by clicking the center of either 
selected apple and dragging in one motion. Because both apples are selected, 
they move together.
As you drag, you may notice the green lines that appear. These are called 
alignment guides and are visible because Smart Guides are turned on (View > 
Smart Guides). As you drag, the objects are aligned to other objects on the 
artboard. Also notice the gray box, or measurement label, that shows the 
object’s distance from its original position. Measurement labels also appear 
because Smart Guides are turned on.
8 Deselect the apples by clicking the artboard where there are no objects or by 
choosing Select > Deselect.
9 Revert to the last saved version of the document by choosing File > Revert. In 
the Revert dialog box, click Revert.
	Note:  To select an 
item without a fill, you 
must click the stroke 
(border).
	Tip:  To select all 
objects, choose Select > 
All. To select all objects 
in a single artboard, 
choose Select > All On 
Active Artboard. To learn 
more about artboards, 
see Lesson 3, “Creating 
and Editing Shapes.”

68 
LESSON 2 
Selecting and Aligning
Using the Direct Selection tool
The Direct Selection tool selects points or path segments within an object so that it 
can be reshaped. Next, you will select anchor points and path segments using the 
Direct Selection tool.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel. 
Without clicking, position the pointer over the top edge 
of one of the fence pickets you see above the red apples.
When the Direct Selection tool is over an anchor 
point of a path or object, a label, such as the word 
“anchor” or “path,” appears. This label is showing 
because Smart Guides are selected. Also notice the 
small dot that appears in the center of the box to the 
right of the cursor. When you position the Direct Selection tool over an anchor 
point, a dot appears in the small box next to the cursor, indicating that the 
cursor is positioned over an anchor point.
3 Click the top point of the same picket. Note that 
only the point you selected is solid, indicating that 
it is selected, while the other points in the picket are 
hollow and not selected.
Also notice the blue direction lines extending from 
the selected anchor point. At the end of the direction 
lines are direction points. The angle and length of the 
direction lines determine the shape and size of the 
curved segments. Moving the direction points reshapes the curves.
4 With the Direct Selection tool still selected, drag 
the individual point down to edit the shape of the 
object. Try clicking another point, and notice that the 
previous point is deselected.
	Note:  The gray measurement label that appears as you drag the 
anchor point has the values dX and dY. dX indicates the distance the 
pointer has moved along the x axis (horizontal), and dY indicates the 
distance the pointer has moved along the y axis (vertical).
 Tip:  Using the Shift key, you can select multiple points to move them together.
5 Revert to the last saved version of the file by choosing File > Revert. In the 
Revert dialog box, click Revert.
 Note:  The 
measurements 
you see in the gray 
measurement label may 
be different than what 
you see in the figure, 
and that’s okay.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  69
Selection and anchor 
point preferences
You can change selection preferences and how anchor points appear in the 
Illustrator Preferences dialog box. 
Choose Edit > Preferences > Selection & Anchor Display (Windows) or  
Illustrator > Preferences > Selection & Anchor Display (Mac OS). You can change 
the size of anchor points (called anchors in the dialog box) or the display of the 
direction lines (called handles in the dialog box).
As you move the pointer over anchor points in your artwork, they are highlighted. 
You can also turn off the highlighting of anchor points as the pointer hovers over 
them. Highlighting anchor points makes it easier to determine which point you are 
about to select. You will learn more about anchor points and anchor point handles 
in Lesson 5, “Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools.”
Creating selections with a marquee
Some selections may be easier to make by creating a marquee around the objects 
that you want to select.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel. Instead of Shift-clicking to select 
multiple objects, position the pointer above and to the left of the upper-left 
red apple, and then drag downward and to the right to create a marquee that 
overlaps just the tops of the apples.
 Tip:  When dragging 
with the Selection 
tool, you only need to 
encompass a small part 
of an object to include it 
in the selection.

70 
LESSON 2 
Selecting and Aligning
3 Choose Select > Deselect, or click where there are no objects.
Now, you will use the Direct Selection tool ( ) to select multiple points in objects.
4 Select the Direct Selection tool. Click outside the top of one of the fence pickets 
above the red apples, and drag across to select the tops of two pickets in the top 
row. Only the top points become selected. 
5 Click one of the selected anchor points, and drag to see how the anchor points 
reposition together. Use this method when selecting points so that you don’t 
have to click exactly on the anchor point that you want to select.
	Note:  Selecting points using this method might take some practice. You’ll need to drag across 
only the points you want selected; otherwise, more will be selected. You can always click away from 
the objects to deselect them and then try again.
6 Choose Select > Deselect.
7 With the Direct Selection tool, try dragging across the tops of the red apples. 
Notice how multiple points in each apple are selected.
8 Choose Select > Deselect.
Creating selections with the Magic Wand tool
You can use the Magic Wand tool to select all objects in a document that have the 
same or similar color or pattern fill attributes.
1 Select the Magic Wand tool (
) in the Tools panel. Click the orange apple, 
and notice that the orange hat is selected as well. No bounding box (a box 
surrounding the two shapes) appears, because the Magic Wand tool is
still selected.
When selecting with the Magic Wand tool, objects with the same fill color are selected as well.
 Tip:  You can 
customize the Magic 
Wand tool to select 
objects based on 
options, like stroke 
weight, stroke color, 
and more, by double-
clicking the Magic 
Wand tool in the Tools 
panel. You can also 
change the tolerances 
used to identify  
similar objects.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  71
2 Click one of the red apples with the Magic Wand tool. Notice that both red 
apples are selected and that the orange apple and hat are deselected.
3 Holding down the Shift key, click the orange hat with the Magic Wand tool, and 
then release the key. This adds the orange hat and orange apple to the selection, 
because they have the same fill color (orange). With the Magic Wand tool 
still selected, hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, click the 
orange hat to deselect the orange objects, and then release the key.
4 Choose Select > Deselect, or click where there are no objects.
Selecting similar objects
You can also select objects based on fill color, stroke color, stroke weight, and more 
using the Select Similar Objects button or the Select > Same command. The fill is a 
color applied to the interior area of an object, the stroke is its outline (border), and 
the stroke weight is the size of the stroke.
Next, you will select several objects with the same stroke applied.
1 Revert to the last saved version of the file by choosing File > Revert. In the 
Revert dialog box, click Revert. Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select one of the white fence picket objects 
at the top of the artboard.
3 Click the arrow to the right of the Select Similar 
Objects button (
) in the Control panel to show 
a menu. Choose Fill Color to select all objects on 
any artboard with the same fill color (white) as the 
selected object.
Notice that all of the pickets at the top are selected, 
in addition to the white rectangle at the bottom of 
the artboard.
4 Choose Select > Deselect.
5 Select one of the white picket shapes at the top of 
the artboard again, and then choose Select > 
Same > Stroke Weight.
All of the fence picket shapes have a 1 pt stroke, so 
all strokes that are 1 pt are now selected.
6 With the previous selection still active, choose 
Select > Save Selection. Name the selection Fence in 
the Save Selection dialog box, and click OK so that 
you’ll be able to choose this selection at a later time.
7 Choose Select > Deselect.
 Tip:  It is helpful 
to name selections 
according to use or 
function. In step 6, if 
you name the selection 
1 pt stroke, for instance, 
the name may be 
misleading if you later 
change the stroke 
weight of the object.

LESSON 2 
Selecting and Aligning
Aligning objects
Multiple objects can be aligned or distributed relative to each other, the artboard, 
or a key object. In this section, you will explore the options for aligning objects and 
aligning points, as well learn what a key object is.
Aligning objects to each other
1 Choose Select > Fence to reselect the fence pickets.
2 Choose Align to Selection from the Align To button (
) in the Control panel, 
if it’s not already selected. This ensures that the selected objects are aligned to 
each other.
3 Click the Vertical Align Bottom button (
) 
in the Control panel.
Notice that the bottom edges of all the fence 
picket objects move to align with the
lowest picket.
 Note:  These are the same options you will see by 
opening the Align panel (Window > Align).
4 Choose Edit > Undo Align to return the objects to their original positions. Leave 
the objects selected for the next section.
Aligning to a key object
A key object is an object that you want other objects to align to. You specify a key 
object by selecting all the objects you want to align, including the key object, and 
then clicking the key object again. When selected, the key object has a thick blue 
outline, and the Align To Key Object icon (
) appears in the Control panel and 
the Align panel.
1 With the fence picket objects still selected, 
click the left-most picket with the Selection 
tool ( ).
The thick blue outline indicates that it is 
the key object which other objects will 
align to.
 Tip:  In the Align panel, you can also choose Align To Key Object from the Align To option. The 
object that is in front becomes the key object.
 Note:  The Align 
options may not appear 
in the Control panel. If 
you don’t see the Align 
options, click the word 
Align in the Control 
panel to open the Align 
panel. The number of 
options displayed in 
the Control panel 
depends on your 
screen resolution.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  73
2 In the Align options, which you can view 
in the Control panel or by clicking with 
word Align, click the Vertical Align Bottom 
button (
). Notice that all of the pickets 
move to align to the bottom edge of the 
key object.
	Note:  To stop aligning and distributing relative to an object, click again on the object to remove 
the blue outline, or choose Cancel Key Object from the Align panel menu.
3 Choose Select > Deselect.
Aligning points
Next, you’ll align two points to each other using the Align panel.
1 With the Direct Selection tool ( ) selected, click the topmost point of the picket 
that is taller than the rest. Shift-click to select the topmost point of any other 
picket. In the figure, the picket to the right of the tallest picket is selected.
You select the points in a specific order because the last selected anchor point is 
the key anchor. Other points align to this point.
2 Click the Vertical Align Top button (
) in the Control panel. The first point 
selected aligns to the second point selected.
Select the first point.	
Select the second point.	
Align the points.
	Note:  If you don’t see the Align options, click the word Align in the Control panel to show the 
Align panel.
3 Choose Select > Deselect.

74 
LESSON 2 
Selecting and Aligning
Distributing objects
Distributing objects using the Align panel enables you to select multiple objects 
and to distribute the spacing between those objects equally. Next, you will make the 
spacing between the fence pickets even, using a distribution method.
1 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel. Choose Select > Fence to 
reselect all of the fence pickets.
2 Click the Horizontal Distribute Center 
button ( ) in the Control panel.
This moves all of the fence objects so that 
the spacing between the center of each of 
them is equal.
3 Choose Select > Deselect.
4 With the Selection tool ( ) selected, hold 
down the Shift key and drag the right-most 
fence picket slightly to the right, to keep 
the picket aligned with the other pickets. 
Release the mouse button and then the key.
5 Choose Select > Fence to select all of the 
fence pickets again, and then click the Horizontal Distribute Center button ( ) 
again. Notice that, with the right-most picket repositioned, the objects move to 
redistribute the spacing between the centers of the objects.
 Note:  When distributing objects horizontally, make sure that the left-most and right-most 
objects are where you want them, and then distribute the objects between them. For vertical 
distribution, position the topmost and bottommost objects, and then distribute the objects 
between them.
6 Choose Select > Deselect.
Aligning to the artboard
You can also align content to the artboard rather than to a selection or a key object. 
Aligning to the artboard aligns each selected object separately to the artboard. 
Next, you’ll align the leaves shape in the next artboard to the center of the artboard.
1 Click the Next artboard button (
) in the lower-left corner of the Document 
window to navigate to the next artboard in the document, which contains
the tree.
2 With the Selection tool selected, click to select the green leaves shape.
3 Click the Align To Selection button (
), and choose Align To Artboard in the 
menu that appears.
 Note:  Using the 
Horizontal or Vertical 
Distribute Center 
buttons distributes 
the spacing equally 
between the centers 
of the objects. If the 
selected objects are 
not the same size, 
unexpected results 
may occur.
 Note:  The Align 
options may not appear 
in the Control panel but 
are indicated by the 
word Align. The number 
of options displayed 
in the Control panel 
depends on your 
screen resolution.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  75
4 Click the Horizontal Align Center 
( ) button to align the selection to the 
horizontal center of the artboard.
 Note:  When you want to align all objects to the 
center of the artboard for a poster, for example, 
grouping the objects is an important step. Grouping 
moves the objects together as one object relative to 
the artboard. If this isn’t done, centering everything horizontally moves all the objects to the center, 
independent of each other.
5 With the Selection tool, click to select the brown tree trunk shape.
6 Click the Horizontal Align Center ( ) 
button, and then click the Vertical Align 
Bottom (
) button to align the bottom of 
the tree trunk to the bottom of the artboard.
Leave the tree trunk selected for the
next step.
Working with groups
You can combine objects in a group so that the objects are treated as a single unit. 
This way, you can move or transform a number of objects without affecting their 
individual attributes or relative positions.
Grouping items
Next, you will select multiple objects and create a group from them.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), press the Shift key and click the green leaves to 
select them along with the tree trunk you had selected previously.
2 Choose Object > Group, and then choose Select > Deselect.
3 With the Selection tool, click the brown tree trunk. Because the trunk is 
grouped with the leaves, both are now selected.
Notice that the word “Group” appears on the left side of the Control panel.
 Tip:  To select the objects in a group separately, select the group, and then choose Object > 
Ungroup. This ungroups them permanently.
4 Choose Select > Deselect.

76 
LESSON 2 
Selecting and Aligning
Working in Isolation mode
Isolation mode isolates groups or sublayers so that you can easily select and edit 
specific objects or parts of objects without having to ungroup the objects. When 
you use Isolation mode, you don’t need to pay attention to what layer an object is 
on, nor do you need to manually lock or hide the objects you don’t want affected 
by your edits. All objects outside of the isolated group are locked so that they aren’t 
affected by the edits you make. An isolated object appears in full color, while the 
rest of the artwork appears dimmed, letting you know which objects you can edit.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), click either the green leaves or the brown tree trunk 
to select the group you created.
2 Double-click the tree trunk to enter 
Isolation mode.
3 Choose View > Fit All In Window, and 
notice that the rest of the content in the 
document appears dimmed (you can’t 
select it).
At the top of the Document window, a 
gray arrow appears with the words Layer 1 
and <Group>. This indicates that you have 
isolated a group of objects that is on layer 1. 
You will learn more about layers in 
Lesson 8, “Working with Layers.”
4 Hold down the Shift key, and drag the brown tree trunk slightly to the right. The 
Shift key constrains its movement to the horizontal.
When you enter Isolation mode, groups are temporarily ungrouped. This 
enables you to edit objects in the group without having to ungroup.
5 Double-click outside of the objects within the group to exit Isolation mode.
6 Click to select the green leaves shape. 
Notice that it is once again grouped with the tree trunk, and you can now select 
other objects.
7 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
Adding to a group
Groups can also be nested—they can be grouped within other objects or grouped 
to form larger groups. In this section, you will explore how to add objects to an 
existing group.
1 Click the Previous Artboard button (
) in the lower-left corner of the 
Document window to navigate to the previous artboard in the document, which 
contains the fence objects.
 Tip:  To enter 
Isolation mode, you can 
also select a group with 
the Selection tool and 
then click the Isolate 
Selected Object  
button (
) in the 
Control panel.
 Tip:  To exit Isolation 
mode, you can also 
click the gray arrow in 
the upper-left corner of 
the Document window 
until the document is 
no longer in Isolation 
mode. Or click the  
Exit Isolation Mode 
button (
) in the 
Control panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  77
2 With the Selection tool ( ), drag a marquee across the pickets at the top of the 
artboard to select them all.
3 Choose Object > Group.
4 With Align To Artboard chosen from the Align To Selection button (
) menu, 
click the Horizontal Align Center ( ) button to align the group to the horizontal 
center of the artboard. Choose Select > Deselect.
5 With the Selection tool, holding down the Shift 
key, drag the white rectangle at the bottom of 
the artboard on top of the group of pickets. You 
needn’t pay attention to the alignment.
6 With the Selection tool, Shift-click a picket object 
to select the grouped objects as well.
7 Choose Object > Group.
You have created a nested group—a group within a 
group. Nesting is a common technique used when designing artwork. It’s a great 
way to keep associated content together.
8 Choose Select > Deselect.
9 With the Selection tool, click one of the grouped objects. All objects in the 
group become selected.
10 Click a blank area on the artboard to deselect the objects.
11 Hold down on the Direct Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and drag to the 
right to access the Group Selection tool (
). The Group Selection tool adds the 
object’s parent group(s) to the current selection.
12 Click the left-most fence picket once to select the object. Click again to select 
the object’s parent group (the group of pickets). The Group Selection tool adds 
each group to the selection in the order in which it was grouped.
Click once to select a picket.	
Click twice to select the parent group.
13 Choose Select > Deselect.
14 With the Selection tool, click any of the grouped objects to select the group. 
Choose Object > Ungroup to ungroup the objects. Choose Select > Deselect.
15 Click to select the fence pickets. Notice that they are still grouped.
16 Choose Select > Deselect.
 Tip:  If you were to 
click a third time, the 
white rectangle would 
also become selected.
 Note:  To ungroup  
all of the selected 
objects, even the fence 
pickets, choose Object > 
Ungroup twice.

78 
LESSON 2 
Selecting and Aligning
Exploring object arrangement
As you create objects, Illustrator stacks them in order on the artboards, beginning 
with the first object created. The order in which objects are stacked (called stack 
order) determines how they display when they overlap. You can change the 
stacking order of objects in your artwork at any time using either the Layers panel 
or Object > Arrange commands.
Arranging objects
Next, you will work with the Arrange commands to change how objects are stacked.
1 With the Selection tool ( ) selected, position the pointer over a red apple and 
click to select it.
2 Choose View > Fit All In Window to see both artboards in the document.
3 Drag the selected red apple on top of the 
leaves in the tree. Release the mouse, and 
notice that the red apple goes behind the 
tree, but it is still selected.
It is behind the tree because it was probably 
created before the tree, which means it is 
lower in the stack of shapes.
4 With the apple still selected, choose Object > Arrange > Bring to Front. This 
brings the apple to the front of the stack, making it the topmost object.
About arranging objects
As you create more complex artwork, you may need to send content behind or 
bring it in front of other content, by doing any of the following:
• 
To move an object to the top or bottom position in its group or layer, select 
the object you want to move and choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front or 
Object > Arrange > Send To Back.
• 
To move an object by one object to the front or one object to the back of a 
stack, select the object you want to move and choose Object > Arrange > Bring 
Forward or Object > Arrange > Send Backward.
—From Illustrator Help

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  79
Selecting objects behind
When you stack objects on top of each other, sometimes it becomes difficult to 
select objects that are underneath. Next, you will learn how to select an object 
through a stack of objects.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), select the other red apple on the left artboard, drag 
it onto the green leaves shape on the right artboard, and then release
the mouse.
Notice that the apple seems to disappear again. The apple went behind the 
leaves of the tree, but is still selected. This time you will deselect the apple and 
then select it again by selecting through objects.
2 Click the red apple again. Notice that you 
have selected the object on top, which is 
the tree group, instead.
3 With the pointer still positioned over the 
location of the apple, behind the tree, hold 
down the Ctrl (Windows) or Command 
(Mac OS) key and click. Notice the angled 
bracket displayed with the pointer (
). 
Click once more to select through the 
leaves of the tree to the apple.
4 Choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front to bring the apple on top of the tree.
5 Choose Select > Deselect.
 Tip:  You can add more apples to the tree for practice, if you like.
Hiding objects
When working on complex artwork, selections may become more difficult to 
control. In this section, you’ll combine some of the techniques you’ve already 
learned with additional features that make selecting objects easier.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), drag a marquee across the fence pickets and the 
white rectangle on top to select them. Drag them to the bottom of the right 
artboard with the tree on it.
2 Choose Object > Arrange > Bring to Front. On the artboard with the tree, click 
a blank area to make that artboard the active artboard.
3 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
 Note:  To select 
the hidden apple, 
make sure that you 
click where the apple 
and the tree overlap. 
Otherwise, nothing 
will happen.
 Note:  You may 
also see a plus symbol 
(+) next to the pointer 
when selecting behind.  
That’s okay.

LESSON 2 
Selecting and Aligning
4 Click somewhere to deselect the objects, and then click to select the white 
rectangle on top of the group of pickets. Choose Object > Arrange > Send 
Backward one or more times until the white rectangle is behind the picket 
group. Choose Select > Deselect.
5 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the picket group and choose Object > Hide >
Selection or press Ctrl+3 (Windows) or Command+3 (Mac OS). The picket 
group is hidden so that you can more easily select other objects.
6 Click to select the white rectangle and, holding down the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key, drag the rectangle down to create a copy. Release the 
mouse button and then the modifier key.
7 Choose Object > Show All to show the picket group again.
8 Choose Select > Same > Fill Color to select all three parts of the fence, including 
the picket group. Choose Object > Group.
9 With Align To Artboard chosen from the Align To Selection button (
) menu, 
click the Horizontal Align Center ( ) button to align the group to the horizontal 
center of the artboard. Choose Select > Deselect.
10 Choose File > Save to save the file, and then choose File > Close.
Applying selection techniques
As stated earlier, selecting objects is an important part of working with Illustrator. 
In this part of the lesson, you will use most of the techniques discussed previously 
in this lesson to get more practice and to learn a few new ones.
1 Choose File > Open, and open the L2start_2.ai file in the Lesson02 folder, 
located in the Lessons folder on your hard disk.
2 Choose View > Fit All In Window. 
Artboard #2 (the artboard on the right) shows the final artwork. Artboard #1 
(the artboard on the left) shows the artwork in progress that you need to finish.
3 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to fit artboard #1 in the Document 
window. 
4 Choose View > Smart Guides to temporarily deselect the Smart Guides.

steering wheel shape in the upper-right 
corner into place. Drag the black rounded 
rectangle in the upper-left corner of the 
artboard on the front of the bus, as shown 
in the figure.
6 With the Selection tool, select the headlight 
shapes (the circles) in the lower-right corner of the artboard by dragging a 
marquee across them. Choose Object > Group.
7 Drag the center of the headlight group to 
slide it to its new location to the right of 
the newly aligned rounded rectangle.
8 Double-click the center of the headlight 
group to enter Isolation mode. Click to 
select the white shape and drag it so that 
it’s visually centered on the other shapes. 
Choose Select > Deselect. Press the Escape 
key to exit Isolation mode.
9 With the Selection tool, press the Alt+Shift 
(Windows) or Option+Shift (Mac OS) keys 
and drag the headlight group to the left to 
duplicate it. Release the mouse button, and 
then the modifier keys.
10 Shift-click the rounded rectangle and the 
headlight group to the right to select all 
three objects.
11 In the Control panel, choose Align To 
Selection from the Align To Selection 
button (
) menu, and then click the 
Horizontal Distribute Center ( ) button. 
Choose Object > Group.
12 Shift-click the orange shape behind the 
selected group. Click the orange shape 
again to make it the key object. Click the 
Horizontal Align Center ( ) button and then 
the Vertical Align Center (
) button to 
align the rounded rectangle group to the 
orange shape.
	Note:  You drag from 
the center to avoid 
grabbing a bounding 
box handle and 
accidently resizing 
the shapes.
 Tip:  You could align 
the shapes using the 
Align options in the 
Control panel.
 Note:  If you don’t 
see the Align panel 
options in the Control 
panel, either click 
the word Align in the 
Control panel or choose 
Window > Align.

LESSON 2 
Selecting and Aligning
13  With the Selection tool, Shift-click the orange shape to deselect it. With 
the group of objects that contains the headlights selected, choose Object > 
Lock > Selection to keep them in position. You cannot select the shapes until 
you choose Object > Unlock All. Leave them locked.
14 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click three times, slowly, on 
the dome at the top of the bus, above the text, “SCHOOL BUS.”
15 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ), select 
the top anchor point in the dome, and 
then begin dragging up to make the dome

18 With the Selection tool ( ), drag a marquee across the four lines to select them.
19 In the Control panel, click the Horizontal Align Left (
) button.
20 Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them back on.
21 With the Direct Selection tool ( ), click 
the right end of the top, shorter line to 
select the anchor point (the word “anchor” 
appears). Click and drag that point to the 
right until the anchor point aligns with the 
other lines.
22 With the Selection tool, drag a marquee 
around the lines to select them. Choose Object > Group to group them.
23 Double-click the Hand tool (
) to fit the artboard in the Document window.
24 With the Selection tool, drag the line group 
to position it on the rounded rectangle 
between the headlights. 
Notice that you need to drag one of the 
lines, not between the lines, to move the 
group. You could also align the lines group 
to the black rounded rectangle using the 
Align options in the Control panel.
25 Choose Select > Deselect. 
26 Choose File > Save and then File > Close.
 Tip:  Locking objects 
is a great way to keep 
from selecting or 
editing content and can 
be used in conjunction 
with hiding objects.
 Note:  You may 
want to turn the Smart 
Guides off (View > 
Smart Guides) so that 
you can more easily 
drag the group of lines 
onto the bus. You can 
then align the group 
of lines with the other 
content, if you want.

CREATING AND 
EDITING SHAPES
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Create a document with multiple artboards.
• Use tools and commands to create basic shapes.
• Work with drawing modes.
• Use rulers and Smart Guides as drawing aids.
• Scale and duplicate objects.
• Join and outline objects.
• Edit strokes with the Width tool.
• Work with the Shape Builder tool.
• Work with Pathfinder commands to create shapes.
• Use Image Trace to create shapes.
This lesson takes approximately an hour and a half to complete. If needed, 
remove the previous lesson folder from your hard disk and copy the 
Lesson03 folder onto it.

85
You can create documents with multiple artboards 
and many kinds of objects by starting with a basic 
shape and then editing it to create new shapes. In this 
lesson, you’ll create a new document, and then create 
and edit some basic shapes for an illustration.

86 
LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll create an illustration for a brochure.
1 To ensure that the tools and panels function as described in this lesson, delete 
or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CS6 preferences file. See 
“Restoring default preferences” on page 3.
2 Start Adobe Illustrator CS6.
	Note:  If you have not already done so, copy the Lesson03 folder from the Lessons folder on the 
Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book CD onto your hard disk. See “Copying the Classroom in a 
Book files” on page 2.
3 Choose File > Open. Locate the file 
named L3end.ai, which is in the 
Lesson03 folder in the Lessons folder 
that you copied onto your hard disk. 
These are the finished illustrations 
that you will create throughout this 
lesson. Choose View > Fit All In 
Window and leave the file open for reference, or choose File > Close.
Creating a new document
You will now create a document that will have two artboards, each with an 
illustration that you will later combine.
1 Choose File > New to open a new, untitled document. In the New Document 
dialog box, change the Name to homesale, choose Print from the New 
Document Profile menu (if it isn’t already selected), and change the Units to 
Inches. When you change the units, the New Document Profile automatically 
changes to [Custom]. Keep the dialog box open for the next step.
Using document profiles, you can set up a document for different kinds of 
output, such as print, web, video, and more. For example, if you are designing 
a web page mockup, you can use a web document profile, which automatically 
displays the page size and units in pixels, changes the color mode to RGB, and 
changes the raster effects to Screen (72 ppi).
2 Change the Number Of Artboards option to 2 to create two artboards. Click the 
Arrange By Row button (
), and make sure that the Left To Right Layout arrow 
(
) is showing. In the Spacing field, type 1. Click the word “Width,” and type 8 
in the Width field. Type 8 in the Height field. You don’t need to type the in for 
inches, since the units are set to inches (it’s assumed). Click OK.
	Note:  In Mac OS, 
when opening lesson 
files, you may need to 
click the round, green 
button in the upper-left 
corner of the Document 
window to maximize 
the window’s size.
	Note:  The spacing 
value is the distance 
between each artboard.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  87
3 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, ensure that the name of the 
file is homesale (Windows) or homesale.ai (Mac OS), and choose the Lesson03 
folder. Leave the Save As Type option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows) 
or the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator (ai) (Mac OS), and click Save. In 
the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default 
settings, and click OK.
Set up multiple artboards
Illustrator allows you to create multiple artboards. Setting up the artboards requires 
an understanding of the initial artboard settings in the New Document dialog box. 
After specifying the number of artboards for your document, you can set the order 
you’d like them laid out on screen. They are defined as follows:
• 
Grid By Row: Arranges multiple artboards in the specified number of rows. 
Choose the number of rows from the Rows menu. The default value creates the 
most square appearance possible with the specified number of artboards.
• 
Grid By Column: Arranges multiple artboards in the specified number of 
columns. Choose the number of columns from the Columns menu. The default 
value creates the most square appearance possible with the specified number 
of artboards.
• 
Arrange By Row: Arranges artboards in one straight row.
• 
Arrange By Column: Arranges artboards in one straight column.
• 
Change To Right-To-Left Layout: Arranges multiple artboards in the specified

4 Click the Document Setup button in the Control panel.
This button opens the Document Setup dialog box, where you can change the 
artboard size, units, bleeds, and more, after a document is created.
 Note:  If the Document Setup button does not appear in the Control panel, it may mean that 
content in the document is selected. You can also choose File > Document Setup.
5 In the Bleed section of the Document Setup dialog box, change the value in the 
Top field to .125 in, either by clicking the up arrow to the left of the field once 
or by typing the value, and all four fields change. Click OK.
Notice the red line that appears around both artboards. The red line indicates 
the bleed area. Typical bleeds for printing are about 1/8 of an inch.
What is a bleed?
Bleed is the amount of artwork that falls outside of the printing bounding box, or 
outside the artboard. You can include bleed in your artwork as a margin of error—to 
ensure that the ink is still printed to the edge of the page after the page is trimmed 
or that an image can be stripped into a keyline in a document.

Working with basic shapes
In the first part of this lesson, you’ll create a house using basic shapes, like 
rectangles, ellipses, rounded rectangles, and polygons. You’ll begin this exercise by 
setting up the workspace.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Essentials (if it’s not already selected), and then 
choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
2 Choose View > Rulers > Show Rulers, or press Ctrl+R (Windows) or 
Command+R (Mac OS), to display rulers along the top and left side of the 
Document window, if they are not already showing.
The ruler units are inches because you specified Units as inches in the New 
Document dialog box. You can change the ruler units for all documents or for 
 Tip:  You can change 
the units for the current 
document by right-
clicking (Windows) 
or Ctrl-clicking (Mac 
OS) the horizontal 
or vertical ruler and 
choosing a new unit 
from the context menu.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  89
the current document only. The ruler unit applies to measuring objects, moving 
and transforming objects, setting grid and guide spacing, and creating shapes. 
It does not affect the units used in the Character, Paragraph, and Stroke panels. 
The units used in these panels are specified in the Units category in the program 
preferences (Edit > Preferences [Windows] or Illustrator > Preferences
[Mac OS]).
Understanding drawing modes
Before starting to draw shapes in Illustrator, 
notice the three drawing modes found at the 
bottom of the Tools panel: Draw Normal, 
Draw Behind, and Draw Inside.
Each drawing mode allows you to draw 
shapes in a different way.
• Draw Normal mode: You start every 
document by drawing shapes in Normal mode, which stacks shapes on top of 
each other.
• Draw Behind mode: This mode allows you to draw objects behind other objects 
without choosing layers or paying attention to the stacking order.
• Draw Inside mode: This mode lets you draw objects or place images inside 
other objects, including live text, automatically creating a clipping mask of the 
selected object.
	Note:  To learn more about clipping masks, see Lesson 15, “Combining Illustrator CS6 Graphics 
with Other Adobe Applications.”
As you create shapes in the following sections, you will be using the different 
drawing modes and learning how they affect your shapes.
Creating rectangles
First, you’ll create a series of rectangles.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window. Make sure that 1 is showing in the 
Artboard Navigation area in the lower-left corner of the Document window, 
which indicates that the first artboard is showing.
2 Choose Window > Transform to open the Transform panel.
The Transform panel is useful for editing properties, such as the width and 
height of an existing shape.
Draw Behind
Draw Inside
Draw Normal
	Note:  If the Tools 
panel you see is a 
single column, select 
a drawing mode by 
clicking the Drawing 
Modes button (
) at 
the bottom of the Tools 
panel and choosing a 
drawing mode from the 
menu that appears.

LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
3 Select the Rectangle tool (
) in the 
Tools panel, and start dragging from just 
to the left of the center on the artboard, 
down and to the right. See the figure 
for placement on the artboard. As you 
drag, notice the tool tip that appears as 
a gray box next to the cursor, indicating 
the width and height of the shape as you 
draw. This is called the measurement 
label and is a part of the Smart Guides, 
which will be discussed further in this 
lesson. Drag down and to the right until 
the rectangle is approximately 4.7 in wide and has a height of 2.3 in.
When you release the mouse button, the rectangle is selected, and its center 
point appears. The center point lets you drag to align the object with other 
elements in your artwork. Also, by default, shapes are filled with a white color 
and have a black stroke (border). A shape with a fill can be selected and moved 
by first positioning the pointer anywhere inside the shape.
 Tip:  Holding down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key as you drag with the Rectangle, 
Rounded Rectangle, or Ellipse tools draws a shape from its center point rather than from its upper-
left corner. Holding down the Shift key as you draw with the Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, or 
Ellipse tools selected draws a shape in perfect proportion (a square, rounded corner square, 
or circle).
4 In the Transform panel, if necessary, 
change the size of the selected object by 
typing 4.7 for the width (W:) and 2.3 for the 
height (H:). Typing the in for inches isn’t 
necessary and will be added automatically.
5 Close the Transform panel group by clicking 
the Close button (X) in the upper-right corner of the group title bar (Windows) or 
in the upper-left corner (Mac OS).
6 With the new rectangle still selected, click the Fill color (
) in the Control 
panel and change the fill color to a dark brown. When you position the pointer 
over the swatches in the panel that appears, a tooltip showing “C=50 M=70 
Y=80 K=70” appears over the correct swatch. Press the Escape key to hide the 
Swatches panel.
 Note:  You will learn more about working with color in Lesson 6, “Color and Painting.”
Next, you will create another rectangle using a different method.
7 With the Rectangle tool still selected, position the pointer over the rectangle on 
the artboard and click. The Rectangle dialog box appears.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  91
8 In the Rectangle dialog box, change the Width 
to 1 in, press the Tab key, and type 1.6 in the 
Height field. Click OK.
9 With the new rectangle still selected, click the 
Fill color (
) in the Control panel and change 
the fill color to red (position the pointer over a 
red swatch until the tooltip displays as “C=15 
M=100 Y=90 K=10”). Press the Escape key to 
hide the Swatches panel.
10 Select the Selection tool ( ), and drag the new 
rectangle for the door so that the bottom edge 
snaps to the bottom edge of the brown 
rectangle and is closer to the left edge of the 
brown rectangle.
The snapping of the two shapes is caused by the 
Smart Guides being turned on. Also, the values 
you see in the measurement label may not be 
the same as you see in the figure, and that’s okay.
Another way to make a shape is to make a copy of that shape. Next, you’ll copy the 
door shape and create shapes for a window and the chimney.
1 With the Selection tool selected, position the 
pointer over the red filled rectangle. Press the 
Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, and 
drag directly to the right. When a green line 
appears indicating that you are snapping to the 
horizontal center of the brown rectangle and 
the vertical center of the red rectangle, release 
the mouse button and then the Alt or Option 
key. The measurements you see may be different than the figure and that’s okay.
2 With the new rectangle still selected, click the Fill color in the Control panel 
and change the color to white to fill the new shape.
3 Drag the lower-right bounding point of the white 
rectangle to the right to change the width of the 
shape to approximately 2.3 in with a height of 
1.1 in, as seen in the measurement label.
 Tip:  You can always zoom in closer to the artwork for more 
precision or enter the values in the Transform panel after you 
draw the shape.
 Note:  When 
entering values, if the 
correct unit appears 
(such as in for inches), 
you don’t need to type 
the in. If the correct unit 
does NOT appear, type 
the in and the units will 
be converted.

92 
LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
4 With the Selection tool, press the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, and drag 
the white rectangle from its center straight up 
so that the bottom edge snaps to the top edge 
of the brown rectangle.
5 Drag the left, middle bounding point of 
the rectangle to the right until a width 
of approximately .75 in shows in the 
measurement label.
6 Drag the new rectangle to the right until 
the right edge snaps to the right edge of the 
brown rectangle.
7 Choose Select > Deselect and then 
File > Save.
Working with the document grid
The grid allows you to work more precisely by 
creating a grid behind your artwork in the Document 
window that objects can snap to, and it does not 
print. To turn the grid on and use its features, do  
the following:
• 
To use the grid, choose View > Show Grid.
• 
To hide the grid, choose View > Hide Grid.
• 
To snap objects to the gridlines, choose  
View > Snap To Grid, select the object you want 
to move, and drag it to the desired location. When the object’s boundaries 
come within 2 pixels of a gridline, it snaps to the point.
• 
To specify the spacing between gridlines, grid style (lines or dots), grid color, or 
whether grids appear in the front or back of artwork, choose Edit > Preferences > 
Guides & Grid (Windows) or Illustrator > Preferences > Guides & Grid (Mac OS).
Note: When Snap To Grid is turned on, you cannot use Smart Guides (even if the menu 
command is selected).

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  93
Creating rounded rectangles
Next, you’ll create a rounded rectangle for another part of the illustration.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click twice on the last white 
rectangle you created, which will become the chimney of the house.
2 Click and hold down the mouse button on the Rectangle tool (
), and select 
the Rounded Rectangle tool (
) in the Tools panel.
3 Position the pointer on the left edge of the small white rectangle, below the top 
edge, until you see the word “path.” Click and drag down and to the right to the 
right edge of the white rectangle. Do not release the mouse button yet.
4 Press the Down Arrow key several times to 
decrease the corner radius (make the corners 
less rounded). If you’ve gone too far, you can 
press the Up Arrow key several times until 
you achieve the desired roundness. The corner 
radius of your shape does not have to match 
the figure exactly. Release the mouse button 
when the height is approximately .14 in.
 Tip:  You can also press and hold the Down Arrow or Up Arrow key to change the corner 
radius faster.
Next, you’ll use Smart Guides to help you align the shape you created to the 
existing shapes.
5 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools 
panel. Click anywhere inside the rounded 
rectangle, and drag it up so that it’s centered 
horizontally with the larger white rectangle 
and so that its bottom snaps to the top of the 
larger white rectangle, as shown in the figure. 
When the word “intersect” and the green 
line(s) appear, release the mouse button.
	Note:  The gray tool tip that appears as you drag the shape indicates the x and y distance that the 
pointer has moved.
6 With the rounded rectangle selected, click 
and drag the right, middle bounding point 
to the right. As you drag, press the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key. This 
allows you to resize from the center of the 
shape. Drag until the width is approximately 
.9 in, and release the mouse button and then 
the modifier key.
 Tip:  The color 
of the Smart Guides 
can be changed from 
green to another color 
by choosing Edit > 
Preferences > Smart 
Guides (Windows) 
or Illustrator > 
Preferences > Smart 
Guides (Mac OS).

94 
LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
7 With the rounded rectangle still selected, click the Fill color in the Control 
panel and change the color to a light gray (the tool tip will show 
“C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=20”) to fill the new shape.
8 Choose Select > Deselect.
9 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
10 Select the Rounded Rectangle tool (
) in the Tools panel. Position the pointer 
on the larger white window rectangle, and click.
11 In the Rounded Rectangle dialog box, change 
the Width to 2.4 in and click OK.
Creating a rounded rectangle this way 
allows you to enter a width, height, and 
corner radius. By clicking the artboard with 
the Rounded Rectangle tool selected, the 
measurements of the last created rounded 
rectangle appear by default in the dialog box. 
12 With the Selection tool ( ), drag the rounded 
rectangle from its center down under the 
window shape until it’s centered horizontally 
and its top edge snaps to the bottom edge of 
the window. The green alignment guides will 
help to snap it into place.
13 Choose File > Save.
Creating ellipses
You can control the shape of polygons, stars, and ellipses by pressing certain modi­
fying keys as you draw. You’ll draw an ellipse next, to represent the top of the door.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click twice on the 
red rectangle.
2 Click and hold down the mouse button on the 
Rounded Rectangle tool (
), and select the 
Ellipse tool (
). Position the pointer over 
the upper-left corner of the red rectangle. 
Notice that the word “anchor” appears. Begin 
dragging down and to the right, snapping to 
the right edge of the red rectangle when the 
word “path” appears. Without releasing the 
mouse button, drag up or down slightly until 
the measurement label shows a height of approximately 0.7 in, and then release 
the mouse button.
 Tip:  Drawing with 
the Smart Guides 
turned on can be very 
helpful, especially when 
precision is necessary. 
If you don’t find them 
useful, you could turn 
the Smart Guides off by 
choosing View >  
Smart Guides.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  95
3 Choose View > Hide Bounding Box.
The bounding box, as you saw in previous lessons, allows you to transform the 
shape. If you turn the bounding box off, you can drag the shape by an edge or an 
anchor point without transforming it.
4 Select the Selection tool. Click and drag the 
ellipse up by the right, middle point. Release 
the mouse button when the center of the 
ellipse snaps to the top of the red rectangle.
5 Choose View > Show Bounding Box.
6 Choose Window > Transform to open the 
Transform panel. Click the red rectangle to 
select it, and note the width in the Transform 
panel. Click the ellipse again, and see if the widths are the same in the 
Transform panel. If not, correct the ellipse by typing the same width value as the 
red rectangle and pressing Enter or Return. Close the Transform panel group.
7 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Creating polygons
Now, you’ll create two triangles for the roof of the house, using the Polygon tool. 
Polygons are drawn from the center by default, which is different than the other 
tools you’ve worked with so far.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Click and hold down the mouse button 
on the Ellipse tool (
), and select the 
Polygon tool (
). Position the pointer 
just above the brown rectangle. Drag 
to begin drawing a polygon, but don’t 
release the mouse button. Press the 
Down Arrow key three times to reduce 
the number of sides on the polygon to 
three (a triangle). Hold down the Shift 
key to straighten the triangle. Without releasing the Shift key, drag down and 
to the right until the Smart Guides measurement label displays a width of 
approximately 3.5 in. Release the mouse and then the modifier key.
 Note:  If you 
corrected the width in 
the Transform panel, 
the ellipse may no 
longer be aligned with 
the rectangles. With the 
Selection tool, drag the 
ellipse horizontally to 
align it again.
 Tip:  While drawing 
with the Polygon tool, 
press the Up Arrow key 
to increase the number 
of sides.

LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
3 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools 
panel, and drag the triangle from its 
center until the bottom of the triangle 
snaps to the top and right of the larger 
brown rectangle. The word “intersect” 
appears when it is snapped. Drag the 
triangle a little further to the right to 
hang it over the brown rectangle. See the 
figure for placement help.
4 With the Selection tool, drag the top, 
middle bounding point down until the 
measurement label shows a height of 
approximately 1.7 in. You may need to 
zoom out or scroll in the Document 
window to see the top of the triangle.
Working with Draw Behind mode
Next, you’ll create another triangle behind the one you just drew, using the Draw 
Behind mode.
1 Click the Draw Behind button (
) at the bottom 
of the Tools panel.
As long as this drawing mode is selected, every 
shape you create, using the different methods 
you’ve learned, will be created behind the other 
shapes on the page.
2 Select the Polygon tool (
) in the Tools panel. Position the pointer just to the 
left of the triangle you created. Click to open the Polygon dialog box. Click OK, 
and notice that the new triangle is behind the existing triangle on the artboard.
The values in the Polygon dialog box match the radius and number of sides of 
the last drawn polygon (before you modified it).
3 Select the Selection tool, and drag the 
new triangle so that the bottom edge 
snaps to the top of the brown rectangle, 
as shown in the figure (the blue outline). 
With the triangle selected and in place, 
you can move it to the left, if needed, 
by pressing the Left Arrow key so that 
it hangs off the left edge of the brown 
rectangle a little.
	Note:  If the Tools 
panel you see is 
displayed as a single 
column, you can click 
the Drawing Modes 
button (
) at the 
bottom of the Tools 
panel and choose Draw 
Behind from the menu 
that appears.
	Note:  If your larger 
triangle extends a bit off 
the top of the artboard  
don’t worry. You will cut 
off the top of it later in 
the lesson.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  97
4 With the new triangle still selected, click the Fill color in the Control panel, 
and change the fill color to a darker gray than the smaller triangle. We chose a 
swatch with the tool tip values C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=50.
5 Click the Draw Normal button (
) at the bottom of the Tools panel.
Creating stars
Next, you’ll create a star for the window above the door, using the Star tool.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click twice on the ellipse at the 
top of the red door rectangle.
2 Click and hold down the mouse button on 
the Polygon tool (
), and select the Star tool 
(
) in the Tools panel. Position the pointer 
in the center of the gray ellipse shape. Notice 
that the word “center” appears.
 Tip:  The next step uses several keyboard commands for 
working with stars, so take it slowly and reference the figure 
as you draw. Only release the mouse button when indicated.
3 Click and drag slowly to the right to create a star shape. Without releasing the 
mouse button, press the Up Arrow key five times to increase the number of 
points on the star to ten. Drag the mouse until you see a width of approximately 
.28 in and stop dragging, but don’t release the mouse button yet.
Hold down the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key, and continue 
dragging to the right. This keeps the inner radius constant. Drag until you see 
a width of approximately 1.3 in and stop dragging, without releasing the mouse 
button. Release the Control or Command key, but not the mouse. Hold down 
the Shift key, and drag until the star has a width of about 1.3 in. Release the 
mouse button and then the Shift key.
4 Change the Stroke weight, to the right of the word “Stroke” in the Control 
panel, to 0. Later in the lesson, you will use the ellipse and the star shape to 
create the window above the door.
5 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Change the number of points.	
Resize the star.	
Constrain the star.

Tips for drawing polygons, 
spirals, and stars
You can control the shapes of polygons, spirals, and stars by pressing certain keys as 
you draw the shapes. Choose any of the following options to control the shape:
• 
To add or subtract sides on a polygon, points on a star, or number of segments 
on a spiral, hold down the Up Arrow or Down Arrow key while creating the 
shape. This only works if the mouse button is held down. When the mouse 
button is released, the tool remains set to the last specified value.
• 
To rotate the shape, move the mouse in an arc.
• 
To keep a side or point at the top, hold down the Shift key.
• 
To keep the inner radius constant, start creating a shape and then hold down 
Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS).
—From Illustrator Help
Changing stroke width and alignment
Every shape, by default, is created with a 1 point stroke. You can easily change the 
stroke weight of an object to make it thinner or thicker. Strokes are also aligned 
to the center of a path edge, by default, but you can easily change the alignment as 
well, using the Stroke panel.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the smaller light gray triangle that 
makes up part of the roof.
3 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click that triangle once to 
zoom in.
4 Click the word “Stroke” in the Control panel 
to open the Stroke panel. In the Stroke panel, 
change the Stroke weight to 10 pt. Notice that 
the stroke of the triangle is centered on the 
edge of the shape, by default.
5 Click the Align Stroke To Inside button (
) in 
the Stroke panel. This aligns the stroke to the 
inside edge of the triangle.
You set the stroke to the inside of the triangle so that the bottom edge still 
visually aligns with the bottom of the other triangle.
	Note:  You can 
also open the Stroke 
panel by choosing 
Window > Stroke.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  99
6 With the triangle still selected, 
click the Stroke color in the 
Control panel (to the left of the 
word Stroke), and change the 
stroke color to a darker gray than 
the fill of that same triangle.
7 Choose File > Save.
About aligning strokes
If an object is a closed path (such as a square), you can select an option in the Stroke 
panel to align the stroke along the path to the center (default), inside, or outside:
	 Align Stroke 
To Outside 
	 Align Stroke 
To Inside 
	 Align Stroke 
To Center 
Working with line segments
Next, you’ll work with straight lines and line segments, known as open paths, to 
create a flower pot. Shapes can be created in many ways in Illustrator, and the 
simpler way is usually better.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click four times below the red 
door to zoom in on the empty artboard space below it.
2 Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar.
You’ve been working in the default Preview mode, which lets you see how objects 
are painted with fill and stroke colors. If paint attributes seem distracting, you can 
work in Outline mode, which you’ll do next.
3 Choose View > Outline to switch from Preview to Outline mode.
	Note:  Outline mode removes all paint attributes, such as colored fills and strokes, to speed up 
selecting and redrawing artwork. You can’t select or drag shapes by clicking in the middle of a 
shape, because the fill temporarily disappears.

100 
LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
4 Select the Ellipse tool (
) in the Tools 
panel. Below the house shapes, draw an 
ellipse that has a width of 0.6 in and a height 
of 0.1 in, as shown in the measurement label 
that appears.
 
5 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ) in the 
Tools panel. Drag across the lower part of 
the ellipse to select the bottom half.
6 Choose Edit > Copy and then 
Edit > Paste In Front to create a new path 
that is directly on top of the original.
This copies and pastes only the bottom half 
of the ellipse as a single path, because that is 
what you selected with the Direct Selection tool.
7 Select the Selection tool ( ), and press the 
Down Arrow key about five times to move 
the new line down.
8 Click and drag the line straight down until 
you see, in the measurement label, a dY of 
approximately .25 in.
Make sure that you position the pointer 
directly on the line to select and drag it.
9 Click the word “Transform” in the Control 
panel to show the Transform panel. Change 
the Width of the selected line to .4 in.
You could also open the Transform panel by choosing Window > Transform.
10 Select the Line Segment tool (
) in the 
Tools panel. Draw a line by clicking on the 
left anchor point of the ellipse and dragging 
to the left anchor point of the new path. The 
anchor points are highlighted when the line 
snaps to them. Repeat this on the right side 
of the ellipse.
 Note:  When you 
drag to select, make 
sure that you do not 
drag across the points 
on the left and right 
ends of the ellipse.
 Note:  Depending on 
the resolution of your 
screen, the Transform 
options may appear 
in the Control panel. If 
they do appear, you 
can change the W value.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  101
11 Choose Select > Deselect.
12 Choose File > Save.
Next, you will take the three line segments that make up part of the flower pot and 
join them together as one path.
Joining paths
When more than one open path is selected, you can join them together to create a 
closed path (like a circle). You can also join the end points of two separate paths.
Next, you will join the three paths to create a single closed path.
1 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools 
panel. Drag a selection marquee across each 
of the three paths that you just created, to 
select them all (not the top ellipse).
2 Choose Object > Path > Join.
The three paths are converted to a single 
path. Illustrator identifies the anchor points 
on the ends of each path and joins the 
closest points together.
 Tip:  After the paths are selected, you can also join paths by pressing Ctrl+J (Windows) or
Command+J (Mac OS).
3 With the path still selected, choose 
Object > Path > Join once more. Choose 
Select > Deselect to see the joined path.
This creates a closed path, connecting the 
two endpoints of the path. If you select a 
single open path and choose Object > 
Path > Join, Illustrator creates a path 
segment between the endpoints of the open 
path, creating a closed path.
4 Choose View > Preview.
5 With the Selection tool, drag a marquee across the two flower pot shapes 
to select them both. Change the Stroke weight in the Control panel to 1 pt. 
Change the Stroke color to black. Change the Fill color to black.
6 Choose Select > Deselect. Click to select the bottom flower pot shape, and 
choose Object > Arrange > Send To Back.
	Note:  If you only 
want to fill the shape 
with a color, it is not 
necessary to join the 
path to make a closed 
path. An open path 
can have a color fill. It 
is, however, necessary 
to do this if you want a 
stroke to appear around 
the entire fill area.

102 
LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
7 In the Control panel, change the Fill color to 
a brown (C=35 M=60 Y=80 K=25).
	Note:  To select a path without a fill, click the stroke or 
drag across the path.
8 Hold down the Shift key, and click the 
ellipse with the Selection tool to select both 
flower pot shapes. Choose Object > Group.
Open path vs. closed path
As you draw, you create a line called a path. A path is made up of one or more 
straight or curved segments. The beginning and end of each segment are marked 
by anchor points, which work like pins holding a wire in place. A path can be closed 
(for example, a circle), or open, with distinct endpoints (for example, a wavy line).
Closed Paths
Open Paths
Both open and closed paths can have fills applied to them.
—From Illustrator Help
Using the Width tool
Not only can you adjust the stroke weight and the alignment of the stroke, but 
you can also alter regular stroke widths either by using the Width tool (
) or by 
applying width profiles to the stroke. This allows you to create variations along the 
stroke of a path. Next, you will use the Width tool to create some curtains.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window. Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools 
panel, and then click the white window rectangle three times to zoom in.
2 With the Selection tool, press the Shift key and click the white rectangle, the 
gray rounded rectangle beneath it, and the brown rectangle, to select them all. 
Choose Object > Lock > Selection to temporarily lock them.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  103
3 Select the Line Segment tool (
) in the 
Tools panel, and position the pointer at 
the top of the white rectangle, away from 
the left edge. Hold down the Shift key, and 
drag straight down, snapping the end of the 
line to the bottom of the white rectangle. 
Release the mouse button and then the 
modifier key.
4 Make sure that in the Control panel the Stroke color of the line is black, and 
that the Stroke weight is 1 pt.
5 Select the Width tool (
) in the Tools 
panel. Position the pointer over the middle 
of the line, and notice the pointer has a plus 
symbol next to it ( ). Drag to the right, 
away from the line. Notice that as you drag, 
you are stretching the stroke to the left and 
right equally. Release the mouse when the 
measurement label shows Side 1 and Side 2 
at approximately .25 in.
The new point on the stroke of the original line is called the width point. The 
lines extending from the width point are the handles. Width points created at 
a corner or at a direct-selected anchor point stick to the anchor point during 
basic editing of the path.
6 The width point on the stroke (circled in 
the figure) should still be selected. You can 
tell it’s selected, because it’s not hollow like 
the points at the ends of the handles. Press 
Delete to remove it.
Because you only created one width point 
on the stroke, removing that one removed 
the width completely.
7 Position the pointer over the top anchor 
point of the line, and notice the pointer 
has a curve next to it (
). Press the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, and 
drag to the right until you see that Side 1 is 
approximately 0.25 in. Release the mouse 
button and then the modifier key.
The modifier key allows you to drag one side 
of the stroke rather than both sides, as you did previously.
	Note:  If you need to 
reselect the point, make 
sure that the Width tool 
is selected, position the 
pointer over the point, 
and then click it.
 Note:  When you 
edit with the Width tool, 
you are only editing the 
stroke of the object.

LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
8 Position the pointer over the bottom anchor 
point of the line. Press the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key, and drag to the right 
until you see that Side 1 is approximately 
0.3 in. Release the mouse button and then 
the modifier key.
9 With the Width tool still selected, 
position the pointer over the top width 
point or handle of the line and double-
click to open the Width Point Edit dialog 
box. Change the Side 1 width to .3 in. 
Make sure that Side 2 is set to 0, and 
click OK.
The Width Point Edit dialog box allows 
you to adjust the sides together or 
separately, using more precision. Clicking the Adjust Widths Proportionately 
button (
) would link Side 1 with Side 2 so that they adjust together, in 
proportion. Also, if you select the Adjust Adjoining Width Points option, 
changes to the selected width point affect neighboring width points as well.
10 Position the pointer over the bottom width point or handle of the line and 
double-click to open the Width Point Edit dialog box. Change the Side 1 width 
to .3 in. Make sure that Side 2 is set to 0, and click OK.
11 Position the pointer over the middle of the 
line (indicated by the X in the figure). Click 
and drag to the right until you see a Side 1 
width of approximately .06 in.
 Note:  You don’t have to position the pointer over the 
center of the line and drag to create another width point. 
You can also drag from anywhere in the stroke area.
12 Position the pointer over the new width 
point you just created (circled in the figure) 
and, pressing the Alt (Windows) or Option 
(Mac OS) key, drag the new width point 
down to create a copy. Release the mouse 
button and then the key.
13 Click the new width point to select it.
 Tip:  You can use the 
Width Point Edit dialog 
box to ensure that 
width points are 
the same.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  105
Next, you will select another width point and move them both. You may want to 
zoom in to the line.
14 With the Width tool, press the Shift key 
and click the width point above the selected 
width point to select both. Release the Shift 
key. Drag the point you just selected down 
just a bit. Notice that the two width points 
move together proportionately.
15 Position the pointer between the top width 
point and the second width point from the 
top. See the figure for help. Click and drag 
to the right until you see a Side 1 width of 
approximately .2 in.
16 Choose File > Save.
Saving width profiles
After defining the stroke width, you can save the variable 
width profile from the Stroke panel or the Control panel.
Width profiles can be applied to selected paths by 
choosing them from the Width Profile drop-down list in 
the Control panel or Stroke panel. When a stroke with no 
variable width is selected, the list displays the Uniform 
option. You can also select the Uniform option to remove 
a variable width profile from an object. To restore the 
default width profile set, click the Reset Profiles button at 
the bottom of the Profile drop-down list.
If you apply a variable width profile to a stroke, it is 
indicated with an asterisk (*) in the Appearance panel.
—From Illustrator Help
Outlining strokes
Paths, such as a line, can show a stroke color but not a fill color, by default. If you 
create a line in Illustrator and you want to apply both a stroke and a fill, you can 
outline the stroke, which converts the line into a closed shape (or compound path). 
Next, you will outline the stroke of the curtain you just created.
 Tip:  You can drag 
one width point on 
top of another width 
point to create a 
discontinuous width 
point. If you double-
click a discontinuous 
width point, the Width 
Point Edit dialog box 
allows you to edit both 
width points.

106 
LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
1 With the line still selected, choose None from the Fill color in the Control panel, 
if it is not already selected.
	Note:  If the line initially has a color fill, a more complex group is created when you choose 
Outline Stroke.
2 Choose Object > Path > Outline Stroke. This creates a filled shape that is a 
closed path.
3 With the new shape selected, click the Fill color in the Control panel and 
change the color to a light orange that shows “C=0 M=35 Y=85 K=0” in the tool 
tip. Click the Stroke color, and make sure that the color is None (
).
4 Select the Selection tool ( ) and begin dragging the left edge of the curtain 
shape to the left. As you drag, press the Shift key. When it snaps to the left edge 
of the white window rectangle, release the mouse button and then the key.
5 Drag the right, middle bounding point of 
the curtain shape to the right to make the 
curtain a bit wider.
6 Press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac 
OS) key, and drag the curtain shape to the 
right until its right edge aligns to the right 
edge of the white rectangle.
7 In the Control panel, click 
the word “Transform” to 
open the Transform panel 
(Window > Transform). 
Making sure that the 
center point of the 
Reference Point Indicator 
(
) is selected (to flip the 
curtain shape around its center), choose Flip Horizontal from the Transform 
panel menu (
).
8 Choose Object > Unlock All, and then choose Select > Deselect.
9 With the Selection tool, click to select the white window rectangle. Click the 
word “Stroke” in the Control panel to open the Stroke panel. Click the Align 
Stroke To Outside button (
).
10 Click to select the gray rounded rectangle beneath the white window rectangle 
and curtain shapes. Choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front.
11 Choose Select > Deselect and then 
File > Save.
 Note:  Depending 
on the resolution 
of your screen, the 
word “Transform” 
may not appear in the 
Control panel. Click 
the underlined X, Y, W, 
or H links to open the 
Transform panel if you 
see them instead.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  107
Combining and editing shapes
In Illustrator, you can combine vector objects to create shapes in a variety of ways. 
The resulting paths or shapes differ depending on the method you use to combine 
the paths. The first method you will learn for combining shapes involves working 
with the Shape Builder tool. This tool allows you to visually and intuitively merge, 
delete, fill, and edit overlapping shapes and paths directly in the artwork.
Working with the Shape Builder tool
Using the Shape Builder tool, you’ll change the appearance of the red door and 
create the window above it. Then, you’ll make a cloud.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and click to select the star shape. 
Choose Object > Hide > Selection to temporarily hide it.
3 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click three times on the top of 
the red door to zoom in.
4 Choose View > Outline.
5 Select the Rectangle tool (
) in the Tools 
panel. Position the pointer off the left edge 
of the top of the door. When the green 
alignment guide appears, click and drag 
down and to the right to create a rectangle 
with an approximate width of 1.2 in and a 
height of .1 in.
6 Choose View > Preview.
7 With the Selection tool, Shift-click the gray ellipse and the red rectangle to 
select all three shapes. With the shapes selected, select the Shape Builder tool 
(
) in the Tools panel.
Using the Shape Builder tool, you will now combine, delete, and paint these shapes. 
8 Position the pointer over the bottom of 
the ellipse, indicated by the red x in the 
figure. Drag the pointer down into the red 
rectangle. See the figure at right. Release the 
mouse button to combine the shapes.
In order to edit shapes with the Shape 
Builder tool, they need to be selected. 
When you select the Shape Builder tool, the overlapping shapes are divided 
into separate objects temporarily. As you drag from one part to another, a red 
outline appears, showing you what the final shape outline will look like when it 
merges the shapes together.
 Tip:  Zooming in 
can help you see what 
shapes you are going 
to combine.

108 
LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
9 With the shapes still selected, hold down 
the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key 
and click the left end of the rectangle to 
delete it.
Notice that, with the modifier key held 
down, the pointer shows a minus sign (
).
Next, you will delete a series of shapes using 
the Shape Builder tool.
10 With the Shape Builder tool still selected, 
position the pointer off the left edge of the 
small rectangle below the ellipse, indicated 
by the red x in the figure. Hold down the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, and 
drag to the right to delete all of the shapes. 
Release the mouse button and then the 
modifier key.
Notice that all of the shapes that will be deleted are highlighted as you drag.
11 With the shapes still selected, change the 
Fill color in the Control panel to red, with 
the tool tip showing “C=15 M=100 Y=90 
K=10.” This won’t change anything on the 
artboard. Position the pointer over the 
larger rectangle that is the door, and click to 
apply the red color fill.
You can apply fills to any of the selected shapes by selecting the fill color first 
and then clicking the shape.
12 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
13 Choose Object > Show All to show the star shape.
Lastly, with the Shape Builder, you will build a simple cloud.
1 Select the Ellipse tool (
) in the Tools panel, and draw an ellipse that has 
an approximate width of 1.4 in and an approximate height of .8 in above the 
chimney on the house.
2 Select the Selection tool and, pressing the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) 
key, drag the ellipse twice to create two copies.
3 With the Selection tool, position the shapes 
like you see in the figure and select them all.
4 Select the Shape Builder tool (
) in the 
Tools panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  109
5 Press the Shift key and, starting off the 
upper-left edge of the shapes, drag a 
marquee across them all. Release the mouse 
button and then the key.
 Tip:  Pressing Shift+Alt (Windows) or Shift+Option 
(Mac OS) and dragging a marquee across selected 
shapes with the Shape Builder tool selected allows you 
to delete a series of shapes within the marquee.
6 Select the Selection tool and, with the shape selected, change the Fill color in 
the Control panel to white and the Stroke color to black.
7 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Shape Builder tool options
You can set up and customize various options such as 
gap detection, coloring source, and highlighting to get 
the required merging capability and better  
visual feedback.
Double-click the Shape Builder Tool icon in the Tools 
panel to set these options in the Shape Builder Tool 
Options dialog box.
 —From Illustrator Help
Working with Pathfinder effects
Pathfinder effects in the Pathfinder panel let you 
combine shapes in many different ways to create 
paths or compound paths, by default. When 
a Pathfinder effect is applied (such as Merge), 
the original objects selected are permanently 
transformed. If the effect results in more than one 
shape, they are grouped automatically.
Next, you will finish the roof of the house by 
removing a portion of one of the gray triangles.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window. Press 
and hold the spacebar to access the Hand tool. Drag the artboard down a bit so 
that you can see the gray area above the artboard.
2 Choose Window > Pathfinder to open the Pathfinder panel group.

LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
3 Select the Rectangle tool (
) in the Tools 
panel. Position the pointer above the 
artboard on the left edge. Click and draw 
a rectangle that covers the top part of the 
larger triangle. See the figure for guidance.
4 With the Selection tool ( ), hold down 
the Shift key and click the larger triangle 
to select it as well.
5 With the shapes selected, in the Pathfinder panel, click the Minus Front 
button (
).
With the new shape selected, notice the word “Path” on the left side of the 
Control panel.
6 Choose Object > Arrange > Send To Back.
7 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose 
File > Save.
Working with shape modes
Shape modes create paths like Pathfinder effects, but they can also be used to 
create compound shapes. When several shapes are selected, clicking a shape mode 
while pressing the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key creates a compound 
shape rather than a path. The original underlying objects of compound shapes are 
preserved. As a result, you can still select each object within a compound shape.
Next, you will use shape modes to finish the window above the door.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Select the Zoom tool (
), and click several times on the star above the 
red rectangle.
	Note:  If the star is not showing, you can choose Object > Show All to show the star shape.
3 With the Selection tool, click to select the star, hold down the Shift key, and 
then click the gray ellipse behind it to select both shapes. Release the Shift key, 
and then click the ellipse once more to make it the key object.
4 Click the Horizontal Align Center button ( ) in the Control panel.
 Note:  The Align options may not appear in the Control panel. If you don’t see the Align 
options, click the word “Align” in the Control panel to open the Align panel. The number of options 
displayed in the Control panel depends on your screen resolution.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  111
5 With the objects selected, hold down the 
Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key 
and click the Minus Front button (
) in 
the Pathfinder panel.
This creates a compound shape that traces 
the outline of the overlapping area of both 
objects. You will still be able to edit the 
star and the ellipse shape separately.
6 Choose Select > Deselect to see the 
final shape.
The star was removed from the ellipse 
shape, and the stroke is around the final 
window shape.
7 With the Selection tool, double-click the window shape above the door to enter 
Isolation mode.
8 Choose View > Outline so that you can 
see the two shapes (the ellipse and the 
star). Click the edge of the ellipse to 
select it, if it isn’t already selected. In the 
Control panel, change the Fill color 
to white.
9 Drag the top, middle bounding point of 
the ellipse bounding box down to make it 
shorter. Drag until the measurement tool 
tip shows a height of approximately 0.3 in. 
Leave the ellipse selected.
10 Choose View > Preview.
11 Choose Edit > Copy to copy the ellipse shape. Choose Select > Deselect.
12 Press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode.
13 With the Selection tool, click to select the window shape again. Choose Edit > 
Paste In Back. In the Control panel, change the Fill color of the ellipse copy to a 
darker gray (C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=40) and make sure that the Stroke color is None.
14 Choose Select > Deselect. Click to select the window shape again (the 
compound shape on top). Click the Stroke panel icon (
) on the right side 
of the workspace to expand the Stroke panel. Change the Stroke weight to 0 
by clicking the down arrow to the left of the field or typing in the value and 
pressing Enter or Return. Click the Stroke panel tab to collapse the panel. Leave 
the window compound shape selected.
 Tip:  To edit the 
original shapes in a 
compound shape like 
this one, you can also 
select them individually 
with the Direct 
Selection tool ( ).
	Note:  It is easier to 
resize a shape precisely 
if you zoom in. You 
can also change the 
width and height of the 
selected shape in the 
Transform panel.

112 
LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
You will now expand the window shape. Expanding a compound shape maintains 
the shape of the compound object, but you can no longer select or edit the 
original objects.
15 Click the Expand button in the Pathfinder panel. Close the Pathfinder panel 
group. Choose Select > Deselect.
16 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window, and then File > Save.
Using Draw Inside mode
Next, you will learn how to draw a shape inside of another using the Draw Inside 
drawing mode.
1 Select the Ellipse tool (
) in the Tools panel. 
Position the pointer over the upper-left corner of the 
artboard, and click. In the Ellipse dialog box, enter 
7 in for the Width and 7 for the Height. Click OK.
2 With the ellipse selected, choose Align To Artboard 
from the Align To (
) menu in the Control panel. 
Click the Horizontal Align Center button ( ) and 
the Vertical Align Center button (
).
3 Change the Fill color to blue (C=70 M=15 Y=0 K=0) in the Control panel.
4 Click the Draw Inside button, located near the 
bottom of the Tools panel.
This button is active when a single object is 
selected (path, compound path, or text), and it 
allows you to draw within the selected object 
only. Every shape you create will now be drawn 
inside of the selected shape (the circle). Also, 
notice that the blue circle has a dotted open rectangle around it, indicating that, 
if you draw, paste, or place content, it will be inside of the circle.
	Note:  If the Tools panel is a single column, to access the drawing modes, click and hold down 
the Drawing Modes button (
) at the bottom of the Tools panel and choose Draw Inside from the 
menu that appears.
5 Choose Select > Deselect.
 Tip:  You typically 
expand an object when 
you want to modify the 
appearance attributes 
and other properties of 
specific elements  
within it.
 Note:  The Align 
options may not appear 
in the Control panel. If 
you don’t see the Align 
options, click the word 
“Align” in the Control 
panel to open the  
Align panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  113
6 Choose View > Outline to see the rest of the shape outlines. 
7 Select the Rectangle tool (
), and draw 
a rectangle that starts halfway down the 
roof, vertically, and just off the left edge of 
the large circle you are drawing inside of. 
Make it large enough to cover the bottom 
part of the circle. This will become grass.
8 Choose View > Preview to see that the 
rectangle is inside of the circle.
9 With the rectangle selected, change the Fill color in the Control panel to a green 
(C=50 M=0 Y=100 K=0).
Notice that the circle still has the dotted open rectangle around it, indicating 
that Draw Inside mode is still active.
10 Select the Polygon tool (
) in the Tools panel. Position the pointer in the lower 
half of the circle, and click. In the Polygon dialog box, change the Radius 
to 2.6 in and the Sides to 3. Click OK.
	Note:  If you draw a shape outside of the circle shape, it will seem to disappear. That is because 
the circle is masking all shapes drawn inside of it, so only shapes positioned inside of the circle 
bounds will appear.
11 In the Control panel, change the 
Fill color of the shape to a light gray 
(C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=10).
When you are finished drawing content 
inside of a shape, you can click the Draw 
Normal button so that any new content 
you create will be drawn normally. Right 
now, if you were to attempt to select the triangle or the rectangle, you would 
select the circle instead. If you move the circle, the shapes inside go with it. If 
you resize or reshape the circle, the shapes inside also resize or reshape.
12 Choose Select > Deselect. Click the Draw Normal button (
) at the bottom of 
the Tools panel.
Editing content drawn inside
Next, you will edit the shapes inside of the circle.
1 Select the Selection tool ( ), and click to 
select the gray triangle. Notice that it selects 
the blue circle instead. Double-click the gray 
triangle to enter Isolation mode. Click once 
more on the gray triangle to select it.
	Note:  The blue circle 
is masking part of the 
green rectangle and is 
referred to as a clipping 
mask. You can learn 
more about clipping 
masks in Lesson 15, 
“Combining Illustrator 
CS6 Graphics with Other 
Adobe Applications.”
 Tip:  You can  
separate the shapes by 
selecting the blue circle 
with the Selection tool 
and choosing Object > 
Clipping Mask > Release. 
This would make three 
shapes, stacked on top 
of each other.

114 
LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
With the gray triangle selected, notice that the Edit Contents button (
) on the 
left end of the Control panel is selected. Also notice the gray bar along the top 
of the Document window, indicating that this content is a clip group.
2 Choose View > Outline to see the rest 
of the shapes. With the Selection tool 
still selected, drag the triangle from its 
edge down and to the left until it looks 
approximately like the figure. This will 
be a sidewalk that starts at the front 
door. The dX and dY you see in the 
measurement label will most likely be 
different than what you see in the figure, and that’s okay.
3 Choose View > Preview to see the fill of the shapes again. Choose View > Fit 
Artboard In Window.
4 Press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode.
5 Choose Select > Deselect.
6 With the Selection tool, click to select 
the green grass shape. Choose Object > 
Arrange > Send To Back.
7 Choose File > Save.
Another way to work with the Draw Inside 
mode is to paste or place content into a path, compound path, or text.
8 Choose File > Open, and open the pieces.ai file in the Lesson03 folder, located in 
the Lessons folder on your hard disk.
9 Navigate to the first artboard, with the red brick shapes on it. Select the 
Selection tool, and click to select the brick group. Choose Edit > Copy. Leave 
the pieces.ai file open.
10 Click the homesale.ai tab to return to that document.
11 With the Selection tool, click to select the larger chimney rectangle. Click the 
Draw Inside button, located near the bottom of the Tools panel.
12 Choose Edit > Paste.
The brick group will be pasted into the 
chimney rectangle and will be selected.
	Note:  Your sidewalk  
(gray triangle) may not 
look exactly the same  
as in the figure and 
that’s okay.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  115
13 Press the Shift+Alt (Windows) or 
Shift+Option (Mac OS) keys and, with the 
Selection tool, click and drag the upper, 
middle bounding down to make the brick 
pattern smaller. When the pattern fits 
better, release the mouse button and then 
the keys.
14 Click the Draw Normal button (
) at the bottom of the Tools panel, and 
choose Select > Deselect. Choose File > Save.
Using the Eraser tool
The Eraser tool lets you erase any area of your artwork, regardless of the structure. 
You can use the Eraser tool on paths, compound paths, paths inside Live Paint 
groups, and clipping paths.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), double-click the green rectangle behind the house. 
This enters Isolation mode and lets you edit the shapes in the circle. Click once 
more on the green rectangle to select it.
By selecting the green rectangle, you’ll erase only that shape and nothing else. If 
you leave all objects deselected, you can erase any object that the tool touches 
across all layers.
3 Select the Eraser tool (
) in the Tools panel. With the pointer on the
artboard, press and hold the Right Bracket key (]) for a second or two to make 
the size of the eraser diameter larger. If you make it too large, you can press the 
Left Bracket key ([) to make it smaller.
4 Position the pointer in the upper-left 
corner of the green rectangle—beyond 
the left edge of the circle. Click and drag 
from left to right, along the top edge of 
the rectangle, moving the pointer up and 
down to create hills. When you release 
the mouse button, the path remains 
closed (the erased ends are joined).
 Tip:  If you press the Shift key and drag across content, you will constrain the Eraser tool to a 
vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line.
5 Press the Escape key to exit Isolation 
mode. Choose Select > Deselect and then 
File > Save.
 Tip:  To create 
a marquee around 
an area and erase 
everything inside the 
area, Alt‑drag (Windows) 
or Option‑drag (Mac 
OS). To constrain the 
marquee to a square, 
Alt‑Shift‑drag (Windows) 
or Option‑Shift‑drag 
(Mac OS).

LESSON 3 
Creating and Editing Shapes
Using Image Trace to create shapes
In this part of the lesson, you will learn how to work with the Image Trace 
command. Image Trace traces existing artwork, like a raster picture from 
Adobe Photoshop. You can then convert the drawing to vector paths or a Live 
Paint object. This can be useful for turning a drawing into vector art, tracing raster 
logos, and much more.
1 Click the Next button (
) in the status bar in the lower-left corner of the 
Document window to navigate to the second artboard.
2 Click the pieces.ai tab to show the artwork in the Document window. Click the 
Next button (
) in the status bar to navigate to the second artboard. Choose 
Select > All On Active Artboard to select the realty sign frame. Choose Edit > 
Copy and then File > Close to close the pieces.ai file without saving.
3 Back in the homesale.ai file, on the second artboard, choose Edit > Paste. With 
the content selected, choose Object > Hide > Selection to hide the sign frame.
4 Choose File > Place. Select the logo.png file in the Lesson03 folder, located in 
the Lessons folder on your hard disk, and click Place.
With the placed image selected, the Control panel options change. You will see 
“Linked File” on the left side of the Control panel, and you can see the name 
“logo.png” and the resolution (PPI: 72), as well as other information.
5 Click the Image Trace button in the Control 
panel. The tracing results you see may differ 
slightly from the figure, and that’s okay.
This converts the image into an image 
tracing object using the default tracing 
options. That means that you can’t edit 
the vector content yet, but you can change

Review questions
1 What are the basic tools for creating shapes?
2 How do you select a shape with no fill?
3 How do you draw a square?
4 How do you change the number of sides on a polygon as you draw?
5 Name two ways you can combine several shapes into one.
6 How can you convert a raster image to editable vector shapes?
Review answers
1 There are six basic shape tools: Rectangle, Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, Star, 
and Flare. To tear off a group of tools from the Tools panel, position the pointer over 
the tool that appears in the Tools panel and hold down the mouse button until the 
group of tools appears. Without releasing the mouse button, drag to the triangle on the 
right side of the group and then release the mouse button to tear off the group.
2 Items that have no fill can be selected by clicking the stroke.
3 To draw a square, select the Rectangle tool in the Tools panel. Hold down the Shift key 
and drag to draw the square, or click the artboard to enter equal dimensions for the 
width and height in the Rectangle dialog box.
4 To change the number of sides on a polygon as you draw, select the Polygon tool in the 
Tools panel. Start dragging to draw the shape, and hold down the Down Arrow key to 
reduce the number of sides and the Up Arrow key to increase the number of sides.
5 Using the Shape Builder tool, you can visually and intuitively merge, delete, fill, 
and edit overlapping shapes and paths directly in the artwork. You can also use the 
Pathfinder effects to create new shapes out of overlapping objects. You can apply 
Pathfinder effects by using the Effects menu or the Pathfinder panel.
6 If you want to base a new drawing on an existing piece of artwork, you can trace it. 
To convert the tracing to paths, click Expand in the Control panel or choose Object > 
Image Trace > Expand. Use this method if you want to work with the components of 
the traced artwork as individual objects. The resulting paths are grouped.

Working with artboards
Artboards represent the regions that can contain printable artwork, similar to pages 
in Adobe InDesign. You can use multiple artboards for creating a variety of things, 
such as multiple-page PDF files, printed pages with different sizes or different 
elements, independent elements for websites, video storyboards, or individual items 
for animation.
Adding artboards to the document
You can add and remove artboards at any time while working in a document. 
You can create artboards in different sizes, resize them with the Artboard tool 
or Artboards panel, and position them anywhere in the Document window. All 
artboards are numbered and can have a unique name assigned to them.
Next, you will add more artboards to create the save the date card (front and back) 
and envelope.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window. This is the first artboard.
2 Press the spacebar to temporarily access the Hand tool (
). Drag the artboard 
to the left until you see the canvas off the right side of the artboard.
3 Select the Artboard tool (
) in the Tools panel. Position the Artboard tool 
cursor to the right of the existing artboard and in line with the top edge of the 
existing artboard until a green alignment guide appears. Drag down and to the 
right to create an artboard that is 9 in (width) by 4 in (height). The measurement 
label indicates when the artboard is the correct size.
4 Click the New Artboard button (
) in the Control panel. This allows you to 
create a duplicate of the last selected artboard.
5 Position the pointer below the 
lower-left corner of the new 
artboard. When a vertical green 
alignment guide appears, click 
to create a new artboard. This is 
artboard #3.
6 Select the Selection tool ( ) in 
the Tools panel.
 Tip:  If you zoom 
in on an artboard, the 
measurement label has 
smaller increments.

LESSON 4  Transforming Objects
7 Click the Artboards panel icon (
) on the right side 
of the workspace to expand the Artboards panel.
Notice that Artboard 3 is highlighted in the panel. 
The active artboard is always highlighted in 
this panel.
The Artboards panel allows you to see how many 
artboards the document currently contains. It also 
allows you to reorder, rename, add, and delete artboards and to choose many 
other options related to artboards.
Next, you will create a copy of an artboard using this panel.
8 Click the New Artboard button (
) at the bottom 
of the panel to create a copy of Artboard 3, called 
Artboard 4.
Notice that a copy is placed to the right of 
Artboard 2 in the Document window (the first 
artboard you created).
 Tip:  With the Artboard tool (
), you can also copy an artboard 
by holding down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key and dragging it until the copied 
artboard clears the original. When creating new artboards, you can place them anywhere; you can 
even overlap them.
9 Click the Artboards panel icon (
) to collapse the panel.
10 Choose View > Fit All In Window.
Editing artboards
You can edit or delete artboards at any time by using the Artboard tool, menu 
commands, or the Artboards panel. Next, you will reposition and change the sizes 
of several of the artboards using multiple methods.
1 Select the Artboard tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click Artboard 4, on the 
right, to select it.
Next, you will resize an artboard by entering values in the Control panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  125
2 Select the upper-left point in the reference point locator (
) in the
Control panel.
This allows you to resize an artboard from the upper-left corner of the artboard. 
By default, artboards are resized from their center.
3 With the artboard named “04 – Artboard 4” selected, notice the bounding 
points around the artboard and the dashed box. In the Control panel, change 
the width to 9.5 in and press Enter or Return. Make sure that the height is 4 in.
You will see the Constrain Width and Height Proportions button (
) in the 
Control panel, between the Width and Height fields. This button, if selected, 
allows both fields to change in proportion to each other.
Another way to resize an artboard is to drag the active artboard handles using the 
Artboard tool, which is what you’ll do next.
4 With Artboard 4 (04 – Artboard 4) still selected, choose View > Fit Artboard 
In Window.
5 With the Artboard tool selected, drag the bottom-center bounding point of 
the artboard down until the height is approximately 4.15 in, as shown in the 
measurement label.
 Tip:  To delete an artboard, select the artboard with the Artboard tool and either press Delete, 
click the Delete Artboard button (
) in the Control panel, or click the Delete icon (
) in the upper-
right corner of an artboard. You can delete all but one artboard.
6 With Artboard 4 (04 – Artboard 4) still selected, click the Show Center 
Mark button (
) in the Control panel to show a center mark for the active 
artboard only. The center mark can be used for many purposes, including 
working with video content.
7 Select the Selection tool ( ), and choose View > Fit All In Window.
Notice the black outline around the artboard, which indicates that Artboard 4 is 
the currently active artboard.

LESSON 4  Transforming Objects
8 Click the Artboards panel icon (
) to expand the Artboards panel (Window > 
Artboards). Click the name “Artboard 1” in the Artboards panel to make it the 
active artboard.
This is the original artboard. Notice that a dark border appears around 
Artboard 1 in the Document window. This indicates that it is active. There can 
be only one active artboard at a time. Commands such as View > Fit Artboard 
In Window apply to the active artboard.
Next, you will edit the active artboard size by choosing a preset value.
9 Click the Artboard Options button (
) to the right 
of the name “Artboard 1” in the Artboards panel. 
This opens the Artboard Options dialog box.
 Tip:  You also may have noticed that this button appears to the 
right of each artboard. It allows access to the artboard options for 
each artboard but also indicates the orientation of the artboard.
10 Locate the reference point locator (
) to the left of 
the X and Y values, and make sure that the upper-left point is still selected. This 
ensures that the artboard will be resized from the upper-left corner.
11 Choose Letter from the Preset 
menu in the Artboard Options 
dialog box. Click OK.
The Preset menu lets you change 
a selected artboard to a set size. 
Notice that the sizes in the Preset 
menu include typical print, video, 
tablet (Apple iPad, for instance), 
and web sizes. You can also fit the artboard to the artwork bounds or the selected 
art, which is a great way to fit an artboard to a logo, for instance.
12 Click the Document Setup button in the Control panel.
 Tip:  You can also access the Document Setup dialog box by choosing File > Document Setup.
13 In the Document Setup 
dialog box, change the 
Top Bleed option to .125 
by clicking the up arrow to 
the left of the field. Notice 
that all the values change 
together, because Make

You can drag artboards at any time and even overlap them, if necessary.
16 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel.
17 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
18 Choose File > Save.
Renaming artboards
By default, artboards are assigned a number and a name. When you navigate the 
artboards in a document, it can be helpful to name them.
Next, you are going to rename the artboards so that the names are more useful.
1 Click the Artboards panel icon (
) to expand the Artboards panel.
2 Double-click the name “Artboard 1” in the 
Artboards panel. Change the name to Flyer and 
press Enter or Return.
 Tip:  You can also change the name of an artboard by clicking 
the Artboard Options button (
) in the Artboards panel and 
changing the name in the Artboard Options dialog box. Another 
way is to double-click the Artboard tool in the Tools panel to 
change the name for the currently active artboard in the Artboard 
Options dialog box. You can make an artboard the currently active artboard by clicking the artboard 
with the Selection tool.
You will now rename the rest of the artboards.
 Note:  When you 
drag an artboard with 
content on it, the 
art moves with the 
artboard by default. 
If you want to move 
an artboard, but not 
the art on it, select the 
Artboard tool, and then 
click to deselect Move/
Copy Artwork With 
Artboard (
).

128 
LESSON 4  Transforming Objects
3 Double-click the name “Artboard 2” in the panel, and change the name to 
Card-front.
4 Do the same for the remaining two artboards, 
changing “Artboard 3” to Card-back and 
“Artboard 4” to Envelope.
5 Choose File > Save, and keep the Artboards panel 
expanded for the next steps.
Reordering artboards
When you navigate your document, the order in which the artboards appear can be 
important, especially if you are navigating the document using the Next artboard 
and Previous artboard buttons. By default, artboards are ordered according to 
the order in which they are created, but you can change that order. Next, you will 
reorder the artboards so that the two sides of the card are in the correct order.
1 With the Artboards panel still open, click the name “Envelope” in the panel. 
This makes the Envelope artboard the active artboard.
2 Choose View > Fit All In Window.
3 Position the pointer over the Envelope artboard 
listed in the Artboards panel. Click and drag up 
until a line appears between the Flyer and Card-
front artboards. Release the mouse button.
 Tip:  You can also reorder the artboards by selecting an 
artboard in the Artboards panel and clicking the Move Up or Move 
Down button at the bottom of the panel.
This moves the artboard up in order so that it becomes the second artboard. 
Notice that it does nothing to the artboards in the Document window.
4 Double-click to the right or left of the name “Flyer” in the Artboards panel to fit 
that artboard in the Document window.
5 Click the Next Artboard button (
) in the lower-left corner of the Document 
window to navigate to the next artboard (Envelope). This fits the Envelope 
artboard in the Document window.
If you had not changed the order, the next artboard would have been
the Card-front.
Now that the artboards are set up, you will concentrate on transforming artwork to 
create the content for the artboards.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  129
Transforming content
Transforming content allows you to move, rotate, reflect, scale, and shear objects. 
Objects can be transformed using the Transform panel, selection tools, specialized 
tools, Transform commands, guides, Smart Guides, and more. In this part of the 
lesson, you will transform content using a variety of methods.
Working with rulers and guides
Rulers help you accurately place and measure objects. The point where 0 appears 
on each ruler (horizontal and vertical) is called the ruler origin. The ruler origin can 
be reset depending on which artboard is active. There are also two types of rulers 
available: global rulers and artboard rulers. Artboard rulers, which are the default, 
set the ruler origin to the upper-left corner of the active artboard. Global rulers set 
the ruler origin at the upper-left corner of the first artboard.
Guides are non-printing lines that help you align objects. You can create horizontal 
and vertical ruler guides by dragging them from the rulers. Next, you will create a 
guide and then reset the origin and create a new guide.
1 In the Artboards panel, double-click to the right or left of the Card-front 
artboard name to navigate to that artboard.
2 Shift-drag from the left vertical ruler 
toward the right to create a vertical guide at 
1/2 inch on the horizontal ruler. The Shift key 
snaps the guide to the ruler units as you drag. 
Release the mouse button, and then the Shift 
key. The guide will be selected.
If you don’t see the rulers, you can choose 
View > Rulers > Show Rulers. Also, you will 
see finer increments in the rulers the more 
you zoom in to the artboard.
 Note:  Notice that the rulers show 0 at the upper-left corner of the artboard. If they don’t show 0, 
choose View > Rulers > (and make sure that you see) Change To Global Rulers. If you see Change To 
Artboard Rulers, choose it.
3 With the guide selected, change the X value in the Control panel to .25 in and 
press Enter or Return. 
	Note:  If you don’t see the X value, you can click the word “Transform” or open the Transform 
panel (Window > Transform).
Guides are similar to drawn objects in that they can be selected like a drawn 
line, and they can be deleted by pressing the Backspace or Delete key.
 Tip:  To change the 
units for a document, 
choose File > Document 
Setup or, with nothing 
selected, click the 
Document Setup 
button in the Control 
panel. You can also 
right-click (Windows) 
or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) 
either ruler to change 
the units.

130 
LESSON 4  Transforming Objects
4 Position the pointer in the upper-left corner of the Document window, where 
the rulers intersect (
), and drag the pointer to the upper-right corner of the 
artboard, not the red bleed guides. The word “intersect” will appear.
As you drag, a cross hair in the window and in the rulers indicates the 
changing ruler origin. This sets the ruler origin (0,0) to the upper-right corner of 
the artboard.
5 Shift-drag from the left vertical ruler toward the 
right to 1/4 inch inside the right edge of 
the artboard to create a new guide. Release the 
mouse button and then the key.
Look at the X value in the Control panel and, 
after releasing the mouse button, you should 
see -0.25 in. The X axis runs horizontal, and 
the Y axis runs vertical. Measurements to the 
right (horizontal) and below (vertical) the ruler 
origin are positive. Measurements to the left 
(horizontal) and above (vertical) the ruler origin are negative.
6 Position the pointer in the upper-left corner of the Document window, where 
the rulers intersect, and double-click to reset the ruler origin.
7 Choose View > Guides > Lock Guides to prevent them from being accidentally 
moved. Choose View > Fit All In Window.
The guides are no longer selected and are aqua in color, by default.
 Tip:  To change guide settings, choose Edit > Preferences > Guides & Grid (Windows) or 
Illustrator > Preferences > Guides & Grid (Mac OS).
8 Choose File > Save.
Scaling objects 
Objects are scaled by enlarging or reducing them horizontally (along the X 
axis) and vertically (along the Y axis) relative to a fixed reference point that you 
designate. If you don’t designate an origin, objects are scaled from their center 
point. So far in the lessons, you scaled most content with the selection tools. In this 
lesson, you’ll use several other methods to scale the objects.
First, you’ll set the preference to scale strokes and effects. Then, you’ll scale a logo 
by using the Scale command and aligning the logo to the guides provided.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  131
1 Choose Edit > Preferences > General (Windows) or Illustrator > Preferences > 
General (Mac OS), and select Scale Strokes & Effects. This scales the stroke 
width of any object scaled in this lesson. Click OK.
2 Click to select the large yellow/green wheel logo on the Flyer artboard. Alt-drag 
(Windows) or Option-drag (Mac OS) the object to the upper-right artboard. 
Release the mouse button and then the key, when in position.
3 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click twice, slowly, on the new 
wheel logo to zoom in.
4 Choose View > Hide Edges. This hides the inside edges of the shapes, not the 
bounding box.
5 Double-click the Scale tool (
) in the 
Tools panel.
6 In the Scale dialog box, select the 
Preview option. Change Uniform to 
50%. Deselect and then select Preview 
to see the change in size. Click OK.
7 With the Selection tool ( ) selected, 
position the pointer over the left anchor 
point of the bottom, left arrow in the 
wheel. When you see the word “anchor” 
appear, drag the wheel to the left until 
the anchor snaps to the guide. The 
pointer will turn white when it 
is snapped.
 Note:  You may need to turn off the Smart Guides 
in order to snap the content to the guide (View > 
Smart Guides). If you do turn them off, turn them 
back on after you have completed the step.
 Tip:  You can  
also select Scale 
Strokes & Effects in the 
Transform panel.
 Tip:  The Scale 
dialog box can also be 
accessed by choosing 
Object > Transform > 
Scale. 
 Note:  When 
snapping to a point, the 
snapping alignment 
depends on the 
position of the pointer, 
not the edges of the 
dragged object. Also, 
you can snap points 
to guides because the 
View > Snap To Point 
command is selected  
by default.

LESSON 4  Transforming Objects
8 Choose View > Fit All In Window, and then choose View > Show Edges.
9 Choose View > Outline.
10 With the Selection tool, drag a marquee across the text that starts with, “YOU 
DONATE YOUR,” and ends with, “KEEP MAKING ART,” on the first artboard 
(Flyer) to select it all. Choose Edit > Copy.
11 Choose 3 Card-front from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left 
corner of the Document window to return to the card artboard.
12 Choose Edit > Paste In Place.
This command pastes the grouped content in the same relative position on the 
card artboard as it was on the Flyer artboard.
13 In the Control panel, click the middle-left reference point of the reference point 
locator (
) to set the reference point. Click to select the Constrain Width And 
Height Proportions icon (
), located between the W and H fields. Type 75% in 
the Width (W) field, and then press Enter or Return to decrease the size of the 
grouped text.
14 Choose View > Preview, and then choose File > Save.
You will position the text, along with other content, later in the lesson.
Reflecting objects
When you reflect an object, Illustrator creates a reflection of the object across an 
invisible vertical or horizontal axis. Copying objects while reflecting allows you to 
create a mirror image of the object, based on an invisible axis. In a similar way to 
scaling and rotating, when you reflect an object, you either designate the reference 
point or use the object’s center point by default. Next, you’ll move content onto an 
artboard and use the Reflect tool to flip it 90° across the vertical axis and copy it.
1 Choose View > Fit All In Window. Press Ctrl+– (Windows) or Command+– (Mac 
OS) twice to zoom out to see the bicycle off the left edge of the Flyer artboard.
 Note:  Depending on 
the resolution of your 
screen, the Transform 
options may not appear 
in the Control panel. If 
they do not appear, you 
can click the word 
“Transform” to see the 
Transform panel, or 
you can also choose 
Window > Transform.

2 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the bicycle. Choose Edit > Cut.
3 Choose 4 Card-back from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left 
corner of the Document window to return to the card artboard.
4 Choose Edit > Paste to paste the bicycle in the center of the Document window.
5 With the Selection tool ( ), drag the bicycle down into the lower-right corner 
of the artboard. Try to approximately align the right side of the bicycle with the 
right guide, using the figure as a guide. It doesn’t have to be exact.
6 With the bicycle still selected, choose Edit > Copy and Edit > Paste In Front to 
put a copy directly on top.
7 Select the Reflect tool (
), which is nested 
within the Rotate tool (
) in the Tools panel. 
Click the left edge of the front bicycle tire (the 
word “anchor” or “path” may appear).
This will set the point of the axis on the left edge 
of the bicycle rather than the center, which is 
the default.
8 With the bicycle copy still selected, position the pointer off the left edge and 
drag clockwise. As you are dragging, hold down the Shift key. When the 
measurement label shows –90°, release the mouse and then the modifier key.
The Shift key constrains the rotation to 45° as it is reflected. Leave the new 
bicycle where it is for now. You’ll move it a bit later.
 Tip:  You can reflect 
and copy in one step. 
With the Reflect tool 
(
) selected, Alt-click 
(Windows) or Option-
click (Mac OS) to set a 
point to reflect around 
and open the Reflect 
dialog box, in one step. 
Select Vertical, and then 
click Copy.

LESSON 4  Transforming Objects
Rotating objects
Objects are rotated by turning them around a designated reference point. You 
can rotate objects by displaying their bounding boxes and moving the pointer to 
an outside corner. You can also rotate objects using the Transform panel to set a 
reference point and a rotation angle.
You’ll rotate the wheels using the Rotate tool.
1 Choose 1 Flyer from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of 
the Document window. Select the Zoom tool (
), and drag a marquee across 
the small, black wheel logo in the upper-left corner of the Flyer artboard.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), select the small black wheel. Choose Object > 
Transform > Rotate.
By default, the wheel logo will rotate around its center.
 Tip:  To access the Rotate dialog box, you can also double-click the Rotate tool (
) in the Tools 
panel. The Transform panel (Window > Transform) also has a rotate option.
3 In the Rotate dialog box, make sure that 
Preview is selected. Change the angle 
to 20, and then click OK to rotate the 
wheel around the center.
 Note:  If you select an object and then select the 
Rotate tool, you can Alt-click (Windows) or Option-
click (Mac OS) anywhere on the object (or artboard) to 
set a reference point and open the Rotate dialog box.
4 Choose View > Fit All In Window. Select the Selection tool ( ) and, with the 
small wheel logo selected, press the Shift key and click the text to the right of 
logo that begins, “THE CHILDREN’S ART CENTER,” to select both. Choose 
Edit > Cut.

1.7 in and the Y value to 0.6 in. Press 
Enter or Return to hide the panel again.
Next, you’ll rotate content manually, using the Rotate tool.
7 Choose View > Fit All In Window.
8 With the Selection tool, click to select the large yellow/green wheel logo on the 
Flyer artboard. Choose View > Hide Edges.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  135
9 Select the Rotate tool (
) which is nested within the Reflect tool (
) in the 
Tools panel. Click in the approximate center of the wheel part of the logo to 
set the reference point (
) (just above where the reference point is by default). 
Position the pointer to the right of the wheel logo, and drag up. Notice that the 
movement is constrained to a circle rotating around the reference point. When 
the measurement label shows approximately 20˚, release the mouse button.
Next, you will rotate the wheel logo on the 3 Card-front artboard in the same way.
10 Choose 3 Card-front from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left 
corner of the Document window. Select the Selection tool, and click to select 
the yellow/green wheel logo.
11 Select the Rotate tool (
), and click in the approximate center of the wheel part 
of the logo to set the reference point (
) (just above where the reference point 
is by default). Position the pointer to the right of the wheel logo, and 
drag up. When the measurement label shows approximately 20˚, release the 
mouse button.
12 Choose View > Show Edges, and then choose File > Save.
Distorting objects
You can distort the original shapes of objects in different ways, using various tools. 
Now, you’ll distort a logo shape, first using the Pucker & Bloat effect, and then 
applying the Twist effect to twirl the shape.
1 Click the First button (
) in the status bar to navigate to the first artboard.
2 Click the Layers panel icon to open the panel, and 
then click the visibility column to the left of the 
Flyer Background layer name to show that content.
3 Select the Selection tool ( ), and click to select the 
white triangle in the lower-right corner of the 
Flyer artboard.
4 Choose Effect > Distort & Transform > Pucker 
& Bloat.

136 
LESSON 4  Transforming Objects
5 In the Pucker & Bloat dialog box, select Preview and drag the slider to the left to 
change the value to roughly –60%, which distorts the triangle. Click OK.
6 Choose Effect > Distort & Transform > Twist. Change the Angle to 20, select 
Preview if not already selected, and then click OK.
Twist distortion is applied as an effect, which maintains the original shape and 
lets you remove or edit the effect at any time, in the Appearance panel. Learn 
more about using effects in Lesson 12, “Applying Effects.”
7 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Shearing objects
Shearing an object slants, or skews, the sides of the object along the axis you 
specify, keeping opposite sides parallel and making the object asymmetrical.
Next, you’ll copy a bicycle object and apply shear to it.
1 Click the Artboards panel tab. Double-click the 4 to the left of the Card-back 
artboard name. Click the Artboards panel tab to collapse the panel group.
2 Select the Selection tool ( ). Click to select the bicycle shape on the left. Choose 
Object > Hide > Selection. Click to select the remaining bicycle shape.
3 Choose Edit > Copy, and then choose Edit > Paste In Front to paste a copy 
directly on top of the original.
4 Select the Shear tool (
), nested within the 
Scale tool (
) in the Tools panel. Position 
the pointer at the bottom of the bicycle shape, 
between the wheels, and click to set the 
reference point.

earlier. Choose Edit > Cut to cut the bicycle from the artboard.
9 Choose 2 Envelope from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner 
of the Document window. Choose Edit > Paste.
10 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Positioning objects precisely
You can use the Smart Guides and the Transform panel to move objects to exact 
coordinates on the X and Y axes and to control the position of objects in relation to 
the edge of the artboard.
You’ll add content to the backgrounds of both sides of the cards and then position 
it precisely.
1 Choose View > Fit All In Window to see all of the artboards.
2 Press Ctrl+– (Windows) or Command+– (Mac OS) once to zoom out. You 
should see the two images off the left edge of the Flyer artboard.

138 
LESSON 4  Transforming Objects
3 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the top, darker image.
4 Click the Artboards panel icon (
), if the panel isn’t showing. Click once on the 
3 Card-front artboard name in the list to make it the active artboard.
The ruler origin is now in the upper-left corner of that artboard.
5 Click the upper-left point of the reference point locator (
) in the Control 
panel. Then, change the X value to 0 and the Y value to 0.
6 Choose Object > Arrange > Send to Back, and then Select > Deselect.
The image should now be precisely positioned on the artboard, since it was the 
same size as the artboard to begin with.
7 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to fit the 3 Card-front artboard in the 
Document window.
8 With the Selection tool, hold down the Shift key and, in the text on the right, click/
drag to the left from the word, “YOU,” until the right edge of the “h” in “MAY 19th” 
is aligned with the right guide. Release the mouse button and then the Shift key.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  139
9 In the Artboards panel, click once on the 4 Card-back artboard name in the list 
to make it the active artboard. Click the Artboards panel tab to collapse 
the panel group.
10 Choose View > Fit All In Window to see all of the artboards.

change the X value to 0 and the Y value to 0.
18 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
19 Using the Selection tool, position the pointer 
over the upper-left word, “YES,” and drag 
the text group down and to the right. When 
the measurement label shows dX: 0.25 in and 
dY: 0.5 in, release the mouse button.
The dY in the measurement label indicates the distance moved along the Y axis 
(vertically), and the dX indicates the distance moved along the X axis (horizontally).
20 With the text group still selected, choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front, to 
bring the text on top of the other content on the artboard.
21 Click away from the artwork to deselect it, and then choose File > Save.
	Note:  The dX 
or dY appears as a 
negative value in the 
measurement label  
if you drag content  
up or to the left on  
an artboard.

140 
LESSON 4  Transforming Objects
Changing perspective 
Next, you’ll use the Free Transform tool to change the perspective of content. The 
Free Transform tool is a multipurpose tool that, besides letting you change the 
perspective of an object, combines the functions of scaling, shearing, reflecting, 
and rotating.
1 Choose 2 Envelope from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner 
of the Document window.
2 Click to select the bicycle on the artboard with the Selection tool ( ). Select the 
Free Transform tool (
) in the Tools panel.
3 Position the pointer over the 
upper-middle point of the 
bounding box around the 
bicycle. Extra attention is 
required in the rest of this step, 
so follow directions closely. 
Slowly drag the point down and 
to the right. While dragging, 
press the Control (Windows) 
or Command (Mac OS) 
key to transform the object. When the measurement label shows a width of 
approximately 4.75 in and a height of approximately 1.5 in, release the mouse 
button and then the modifier key.
Pressing the Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key as you drag distorts an 
object from the anchor point or bounding box handle that you’re dragging.
4 Position the pointer over the 
upper-left corner of the bounding 
box, and begin dragging down. 
While dragging, press the 
Shift+Control+Alt (Windows) or 
Shift+Option+Command (Mac 
OS) keys to transform the object. 
When the measurement label 
shows a width of approximately 
4.75 in and a height of approximately 1.25 in, release the mouse button and then 
the modifier keys. If the values you see don’t match exactly, that’s okay.
5 With the Selection tool, drag the 
bicycle to the left until the left 
edge is close to the edge of the 
artboard. Change the Opacity to 
20% in the Control panel. See 
the figure for placement help.
	Note:  Take your 
time on this step. The 
process is specific, and 
you can always choose 
to undo if you make  
a mistake.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  141
6 Choose Select > Deselect, and then File > Save.
Applying multiple transformations
Next, you will learn about the Transform Each command and how to apply a series 
of transformations multiple times.
1 With the 2 Envelope artboard showing in the Document window, select 
the Zoom tool (
), and drag a marquee across the upper-left corner of the 
artboard. Make sure you can still see the corner of the artboard and the wheel.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), double-click the small wheel logo. Click to select the 
wheel shape (not the “RE-CYCLE IT” text), and then choose Edit > Copy.
3 Press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode, and then choose Edit > Paste In Front.
4 Choose Object > Transform > Transform Each. In the Transform Each dialog 
box, select Preview. Ensure that center point of the reference point locator (
) 
is selected in the dialog box. Change the Move Horizontal to –0.45 in. Change 
the Rotate Angle to 20. Leave the other settings as they are, and then click Copy.
The options in the Transform Each dialog box let you apply multiple types of 
transformations in a random manner, if you want. It also allows you to transform 
multiple selected objects on the artboard, independently of each other.
5 With the new wheel selected, change the Fill color to a darker gray 
(C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=60) in the Control panel and choose Object > Arrange > Send 
To Back.
6 Choose Object > Transform > Transform Again to create one more wheel.
7 With the new wheel selected, change the Fill color to a lighter gray 
(C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=30) in the Control panel and choose Object > Arrange > Send 
To Back.
8 Press Ctrl+D (Windows) or Command+D (Mac OS) to transform the last 
selected wheel, creating a total of four wheel shapes.
 Tip:  You can also 
apply transformations 
to selected content 
as an effect (Effect > 
Distort & Transform > 
Transform). 
Transforming as 
an effect has the 
advantage of letting 
you change or remove 
the transformation in 
the Appearance panel 
at any time. You will 
learn more about the 
Appearance panel in 
Lesson 13, “Applying 
Appearance Attributes 
and Graphic Styles.”

142 
LESSON 4  Transforming Objects
9 Change the Fill color of the last wheel to 
a lighter gray (C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=10) in 
the Control panel, and choose Object > 
Arrange > Send To Back.
10 Choose File > Save and File > Close.
Using the Free Distort effect
Now, you’ll explore a slightly different way of distorting objects. Free Distort is an 
effect that lets you distort a selection by moving any of its four corner points.
1 Choose File > Open, and open the L4start_2.ai file in the Lesson04 folder, 
located in the Lessons folder on your hard disk.
2 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, change the name to
hangtags.ai, and navigate to the Lesson04 folder. Leave the Save As Type 
option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows) or the Format option set to 
Adobe Illustrator (ai) (Mac OS), and then click Save. In the Illustrator Options 
dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default settings, and then click OK.
3 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window to fit Artboard 1 in the window.
4 With the Selection tool ( ), double-click the text, “RE-CYCLE IT” to enter 
Isolation mode. Click to select the text shapes.
5 Choose Effect > Distort & Transform > Free Distort.
6 In the Free Distort dialog box, drag one or 
more of the handles to distort the selection. 
In the figure, we dragged the upper-right 
point up and the bottom-right point in 
toward the center. Click OK.
7 Double-click outside the artwork to exit 
Isolation mode and to deselect it.
Now, you’ll create multiple copies of the 
business card content.
8 Choose Select > All On Active Artboard.
9 Choose Edit > Cut.
10 Choose View > Fit All In Window, and then 
choose Edit > Paste On All Artboards.
11 Choose Select > Deselect. Then, choose 
View > Guides > Hide Guides to hide the red 
bleed guides.
12 Choose File > Save and then File > Close.
 Tip:  In this case, 
the text was selected 
with the Selection tool, 
and the Type > Create 
Outlines command 
was applied to convert 
the text to shapes. It is 
not necessary to apply 
the Create Outlines 
command to text prior 
to applying the Free 
Distort command.
 Tip:  To print the 
cards on a single page, 
choose File > Print and 
select Ignore Artboards 
to fit all the artboards 
on a single page.

dialog box.
3 The ruler origin is the point where 0 (zero) appears on each ruler. By default, the ruler 
origin is set to be 0 (zero) in the top-left corner of the active artboard.
4 You can resize an object in several ways: By selecting it and dragging handles on its 
bounding box, by using the Scale tool or the Transform panel, or by choosing 
Object > Transform > Scale to specify exact dimensions. You can also scale by 
choosing Effect > Distort & Transform > Transform.
5 You use the Transform panel for making the following transformations: Moving or 
precisely placing objects in your artwork (by specifying the X and Y coordinates and 
the reference point), scaling, rotating, shearing, and flipping.
6 The square icon, called the reference point locator, indicates the bounding box of the 
selected objects. Select a reference point in the square to indicate the reference point 
from which the objects (as a group) move, scale, rotate, shear, or reflect.

DRAWING WITH THE PEN 
AND PENCIL TOOLS
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Draw curved lines.
• Draw straight lines.
• Use template layers.
• End path segments and split lines.
• Select and adjust curve segments.
• Create dashed lines and add arrowheads.
• Draw and edit with the Pencil tool.
This lesson takes approximately an hour and a half to complete. If needed, 
remove the previous lesson folder from your hard disk and copy the 
Lesson05 folder onto it.

145
While the Pencil tool is preferable for drawing and 
editing freeform lines, the Pen tool is excellent for 
drawing precisely, including straight lines, Bezier 
curves, and complex shapes. You’ll practice using the 
Pen tool on a blank artboard and then use it to create 
an illustration of a violin.

146 
LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
Getting started
In the first part of this lesson, you learn how to manipulate the Pen tool on a 
blank artboard.
1 To ensure that the tools and panels function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CS6 preferences file. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 3.
2 Start Adobe Illustrator CS6.
	Note:  If you have not already done so, copy the Lesson05 folder from the Lessons folder on the 
Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book CD onto your hard disk. See “Copying the Classroom in a 
Book files” on page 2.
3 Open the L5start_1.ai file in the Lesson05 folder, 
located in the Lessons folder on your hard disk.
The top artboard shows the path that you will 
create. Use the bottom artboard for this exercise.
4 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog 
box, navigate to the Lesson05 folder and open 
it. Rename the file to path1.ai. Choose Adobe 
Illustrator (*.AI) from the Save As Type menu 
(Windows), or choose Adobe Illustrator (ai) from 
the Format menu (Mac OS). Click Save and, in the Illustrator Options dialog 
box, leave the default settings, and then click OK.
Starting with the Pen tool
1 Press Alt+Ctrl+0 (zero) (Windows) or Option+Command+0 (zero) (Mac OS) to 
fit both artboards in the window. Then, hold down the Shift key and press the 
Tab key once to close all the panels except for the Tools panel. You don’t need 
the panels for the first part of this lesson.
2 Choose View > Smart Guides to deselect the Smart Guides.
3 In the Control panel, click the Fill color and choose the None swatch (
). Then, 
click the Stroke color and make sure that the black swatch is selected.
4 Make sure the Stroke weight is 1 pt in the Control panel.
When you draw with the Pen tool, it is best to have no fill on the path you create. 
You can add a fill later, if necessary.
5 Select the Pen tool (
) in the Tools panel. Notice the asterisk next to the Pen 
icon (
), indicating that you are starting a path. Click toward the top of the 
bottom artboard to set the first point, and then move the pointer to the right of 
the original anchor point. The asterisk disappears.
	Note:  In Mac OS, 
when opening lesson 
files, you may need to 
click the round, green 
button in the upper-left 
corner of the Document 
window to maximize 
the window’s size.
 Note:  If you see a 
cross hair instead of 
the Pen icon, the Caps 
Lock key is active. Caps 
Lock turns tool icons 
into cross hairs for 
increased precision.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  147
6 Click down and to the right of the original point to 
create the next anchor point in the path.
 Note:  The first segment you draw is not visible until you click 
a second anchor point. If direction handles appear, you have 
accidentally dragged with the Pen tool; choose Edit > Undo Pen, and 
then click again.
7 Click a third anchor point beneath the initial anchor 
point to create a zigzag pattern. Create a zigzag that 
has six anchor points, which means you will click the 
artboard a total of six times.
One of the many benefits of using the Pen tool is that you 
can create custom paths and continue to edit the anchor 
points that make up the path. Notice that only the last 
anchor point is selected (not hollow), like the rest of the anchor points.
Next, you’ll see how the Selection tools work with the Pen tool.
8 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and position the pointer directly 
over the zigzag path. When the pointer shows a solid black box (
) next to it, 
click to select the path and all of the anchor points. Notice that all of the anchor 
points become solid, signifying that all anchor points are selected. Drag the 
path to a new location anywhere on the artboard. All the anchor points travel 
together, maintaining the zigzag path.
9 Deselect the zigzag path in one of the following ways:
• 
With the Selection tool, click an empty area of the artboard.
• 
Choose Select > Deselect.
• 
If the Pen tool were still selected, you could Ctrl-click (Windows) or 
Command-click (Mac OS) in a blank area of the artboard to deselect the 
path. This temporarily selects the Selection tool. When you release the Ctrl 
or Command key, the Pen tool is again selected.
10 In the Tools panel, select the Direct Selection tool ( ) 
and position the pointer over any anchor point. The 
pointer shows a small box with a dot in the center (
), 
indicating that, if you click, you will select an anchor 
point. Click that same point in the zigzag, or drag a 
marquee selection around an anchor point. 
The selected anchor point turns solid, and the 
deselected anchor points are hollow.
11 With the anchor point selected, drag to reposition it. The anchor point moves, 
but the others remain stationary. Use this technique to edit a path.

148 
LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
12 Choose Select > Deselect.
13 With the Direct Selection tool, click any line segment 
that is between two anchor points, and then choose 
Edit > Cut. This cuts only the selected segment from 
the zigzag.
When you position the pointer over a line segment that 
is not already selected, a black square appears next to 
the Direct Selection tool pointer (
). The solid square 
indicates that you are selecting a line segment.
14 Select the Pen tool, and position the pointer over one 
of the end anchor points that was connected to the line 
segment that was cut. Notice that the Pen tool shows 
a forward slash (/), indicating a continuation of an 
existing path. Click the point. Notice that it becomes 
solid. Only active points appear solid.
15 Position the pointer over the other anchor point that 
was connected to the cut line segment. The pointer now 
shows a merge symbol next to it (
), indicating that 
you are connecting to another path. Click the point to

Creating straight lines
In Lesson 4, “Transforming Objects,” you learned that using the Shift key and 
Smart Guides in combination with shape tools constrains the shape of objects. The 
Shift key and Smart Guides also constrain the Pen tool to create paths of 45˚.
Next, you will learn how to draw straight lines and constrain angles.
1 Open the L5start_2.ai file in the Lesson05 folder, located in the Lessons folder 
on your hard disk. The top artboard shows the path that you will create. Use the 
bottom artboard for this exercise.
2 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the Lesson05 
folder and open it. Name the file path2.ai. Choose Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) from 
the Save As Type menu (Windows), or choose Adobe Illustrator (ai) from the 
Format menu (Mac OS). Click Save and, in the Illustrator Options dialog box, 
leave the default settings and then click OK.
3 Choose View > Smart Guides to select the Smart Guides, and then choose 
View> Fit All In Window.
 Note:  If the entire 
zigzag path disappears, 
choose Edit > Undo Cut 
and try again.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  149
4 With the Pen tool (
) selected, and without dragging, click once on the left side 
of the bottom artboard (toward the top) to set the first point.
5 Move the pointer to the right of the original anchor 
point 1.5 inches, as indicated by the measurement 
label. It doesn’t have to be exact. A green construction 
guide appears when the pointer is vertically aligned 
with the previous anchor point. Click to set another 
anchor point.
As you've learned in previous lessons, the measurement 
label and construction guide are part of the Smart Guides. When working with 
the Pen tool, you will learn that you can achieve finer measurements in the 
measurement label when you zoom in.
6 Click to set three more points, following 
the same shape as shown in the top half 
of the artboard.
7 Press the Shift key, and move the 
pointer to the right and down, until it 
is aligned with the bottom two points 
and the green alignment guide appears. 
Click to set an anchor point, and then 
release the modifier key.
Pressing the Shift key creates angled lines constrained to 45˚. The Smart 
Guides will show a green construction guide when the pointer is aligned with 
the existing points, which can be very useful when you are drawing paths with 
straight lines.
8 Position the pointer below the last 
point, and click to set the last anchor 
point for the shape.
9 Choose File > Save, and then choose 
File > Close.
 Tip:  If Smart Guides 
are deselected, the 
measurement label and 
construction guides 
won’t appear. If you 
don’t use Smart Guides, 
you can press the Shift 
key and click to create 
straight lines.

 Note:  The points you 
set don’t have to be in 
exactly the same position 
as the path at the top of 
the artboard. Also, the 
measurement you see in 
your measurement label 
may not match what you 
see in the figure, and 
that's okay.

LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
Creating curved paths
In this part of the lesson, you’ll learn how to draw smooth, curved lines with the 
Pen tool. In vector drawing applications, such as Illustrator, you draw a curve, 
called a Bezier curve, with control points. By setting anchor points and dragging 
direction handles, you can define the shape of the curve. Although drawing curves 
this way can take some time to learn, it gives you the greatest control and flexibility 
in creating paths.
1 Open the L5start_3.ai file in the Lesson05 folder. Choose View > Fit All In Window.
This file contains a template layer that you can trace to practice using the Pen 
tool (
). You will draw in the bottom artboard for this exercise.
2 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the Lesson05 
folder. Change the name to path3.ai. Choose Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) from 
the Save As Type menu (Windows), or choose Adobe Illustrator (ai) from the 
Format menu (Mac OS). Click Save and, in the Illustrator Options dialog box, 
leave the default settings and then click OK.
3 In the Control panel, click the Fill color (
) and choose the None swatch (
). 
Then, click the Stroke color (
) and make sure that the black swatch 
is selected.
4 Make sure the Stroke weight is 1 pt in the Control panel.
5 With the Pen tool (
), click on the left side of the 
bottom artboard to create the initial anchor point. 
Click another location, and drag away from the point 
to create a curved path.
Continue clicking and dragging at different locations 
on the page. The goal for this exercise is not to create 
anything specific but to get accustomed to the feel of 
the Bezier curve.
Notice that as you drag, direction handles appear. Direction handles consist of 
direction lines that end in round direction points. The angle and length of the 
direction handles determine the shape and size of the curve. Direction handles 
do not print and are not visible when the anchor is inactive.
6 Choose Select > Deselect.
7 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, 
and click the line between two points (called a line 
segment) to display the direction handles. Click and 
drag the end of a direction handle as you see in the 
figure. Moving the direction handles reshapes the curve.
8 Leave the file open for the next section.
	Note:  See Lesson 8, 
“Working with Layers,” 
for information about 
creating layers.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  151
Components of a path
As you draw, you create a line called a path. 
A path is made up of one or more straight or 
curved segments. The beginning and end of 
each segment are marked by anchor points, 
which work like pins holding a wire in place. 
A path can be closed (for example, a circle) or 
open, with distinct endpoints (for example, 
a wavy line). You change the shape of a path 
by dragging its anchor points, the direction 
points at the end of direction lines that 
appear at anchor points, or the path  
segment itself.
Paths can have two kinds of anchor points: 
corner points and smooth points. At a corner 
point, a path abruptly changes direction. At a 
smooth point, path segments are connected as 
a continuous curve.
You can draw a path using any combination 
of corner and smooth points. If you draw the 
wrong kind of point, you can always change it.

Building a curve
In this part of the lesson, you will learn how to control the direction handles to 
control curves. You will use the top artboard to trace shapes.
1 Press Z to switch to the Zoom tool (
), and 
drag a marquee around the curve in the top 
artboard, labeled A.
2 Choose View > Smart Guides to 
deselect them.

LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
3 Select the Pen tool (
) in the Tools panel. Click 
at the base of the left side of the arch, and drag 
up to create a direction line going the same 
direction as the arch. Remember to always 
follow the direction of the curve. Release the 
mouse button when the direction line is above 
the gray arch.
 Tip:  If you make a mistake while drawing with the 
Pen tool, choose Edit > Undo Pen to undo the points you 
have set.
4 Click the lower-right base of the gray arch path, 
and drag down. Release the mouse button when 
the path you are creating looks like the arch.
 Note:  Pulling the direction handle longer makes a steeper 
slope; when the direction handle is shorter, the slope is flatter.
5 If the path you created is not aligned exactly 
with the template, use the Direct Selection 
tool ( ) to select the anchor points one at a 
time. Then, adjust the direction handles until your path follows the template
more accurately.
6 Select the Selection tool ( ), and click the artboard in an area with no objects, 
or choose Select > Deselect. Deselecting the first path allows you to create a new 
path. If you click somewhere on the artboard with the Pen tool while path A is 
still selected, the path connects to the next point you draw.
 Tip:  To deselect objects, you can also press the Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key to 
temporarily switch to the Selection or Direct Selection tool, whichever was last used. Then, click the 
artboard where there are no objects.
7 Choose File > Save.
8 Zoom out to see path B.
9 Select the Pen tool, and drag up from the left 
base of path B in the direction of the arch. Click 
and drag down on the next square point to 
the right, adjusting the arch with the direction 
handle before you release the mouse button. 
This creates the same type of arch shape you 
created for path A.
	Note:  Don’t worry if the path you draw is not exact. You 
can correct the line with the Direct Selection tool when the 
path is complete.
 Note:  The artboard 
may scroll as you drag.  
If you lose visibility 
of the curve, choose 
View > Zoom Out until 
you see the curve and 
anchor point. Pressing 
the spacebar allows you 
to use the Hand tool to 
reposition the artwork.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  153
10 Continue along the path, alternating between 
dragging up and down. Put anchor points only 
where there are square boxes. If you make a 
mistake as you draw, you can undo your work 
by choosing Edit > Undo Pen.
11 When the path is complete, select the Direct 
Selection tool and click to select an anchor 
point. When the anchor is selected, the 
direction handles appear and you can readjust 
the curve of the path.
12 Practice repeating these paths in the work area.
13 Choose File > Save and then File > Close.
Converting smooth points to corner points
When creating curves, the direction handles help to determine the shape and size 
of the curved segments. If you've created a smooth point by dragging out direction 
handles, as you did in the previous section, you can convert that point to a corner 
point. In the next part of the lesson, you will practice converting smooth points to 
corner points.
1 Open the L5start_4.ai file in the Lesson05 folder. Choose View > Fit All In Window.
On the top artboard, you can see the paths that you will create, labeled A and B. 
You will use the top artboard as a template for the exercise, creating your paths 
directly on top of those. Use the bottom artboard for additional practice on 
your own.
2 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the Lesson05 
folder. Change the name to path4.ai. Choose Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) from 
the Save As Type menu (Windows), or choose Adobe Illustrator (ai) from the 
Format menu (Mac OS). In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the default 
settings and then click OK.
3 In the top artboard, use the Zoom tool (
) and drag a marquee around path A.
4 In the Control panel, click the Fill color and choose the None swatch (
). Then, 
click the Stroke color and make sure that the black swatch is selected.
5 Make sure the Stroke weight is 1 pt in the Control panel.
	Note:  If you're paths don't match the gray template path exactly in these sections, that's okay! 
The purpose is to get used to how the Pen tool works. 

154 
LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
6 Select the Pen tool (
) and, pressing the Shift key, click the first anchor point 
and drag up. Release the mouse button and then the Shift key when the direction 
line is slightly above the arch. Click the next anchor point to the right, and, 
pressing the Shift key, drag down. When the curve looks correct, release the 
mouse button and then the Shift key. Leave the path selected.
Next, you will split the direction lines to convert a smooth point to a corner point.
7 Press the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key, and 
position the pointer over either 
the last anchor point created or 
the bottom direction point. When 
you see the caret (^) symbol 
appear next to the Pen tool 
pointer, click and drag a direction 
line up. Release the mouse button 
and then the modifier key. If you 
do not see the caret (^), you will create an additional loop.
	Note:  If you don’t click exactly 
on the anchor point or the direction 
point at the end of the direction line, a 
warning dialog box appears . Click OK, 
and try again. 
You can practice adjusting the 
direction handles with the Direct Selection tool when the path is completed.
8 Position the Pen tool pointer over the next black square point on the template 
path, and drag down. Release the mouse button when the path looks similar to 
the template path.
9 Press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key and, after the caret (^) 
appears, position the pointer over the last anchor point or direction point and 
drag up. Release the mouse button and then the modifier key.
10 For the fourth anchor point, 
click the next square on 
the template path and drag 
down until the path looks 
correct. Do not release the 
mouse button.
11 Press the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key, and 
drag the direction handle 
up for the next curve. Release the mouse button and then the modifier key.
 Note:  Pressing 
the Shift key when 
dragging constrains the 
tool to multiples of 45°.
 Tip:  After you draw 
a path, you can also 
select single or multiple 
anchor points and click 
the Convert Selected 
Anchor Points To Corner 
button (
) or Convert 
Selected Anchor Points 
To Smooth button ( ) 
in the Control panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  155
12 Continue this process using the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key to create 
corner points until the path is completed. Use the Direct Selection tool ( ) to 
fine-tune the path, and then deselect the path.
Next, you will switch from a curve to a straight line.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window. You can also press Ctrl+0 (zero) 
(Windows) or Command+0 (zero) (Mac OS). Use the Zoom tool to drag a 
marquee around path B to enlarge its view.
2 With the Pen tool (
), click the first anchor point on the left side of the gray 
template path and drag up. Release the mouse button when the path looks right. 
Then, drag down from the second anchor point and release the mouse button 
when the arch matches the template. 
This method of creating an arch should be familiar to you by now.
You will now continue the path as a straight line.
Pressing the Shift key and clicking does not 
produce a straight line, because the last point 
you created is a smooth anchor point. The 
figure shows what the path would look like if 
you clicked with the Pen tool on the 
last point.
3 Click the last point created to delete the 
leading direction line from the path, as 
shown in the figure.
4 Press the Shift key, and click the next point 
in the template path to the right to set the 
next point, creating a straight segment.
5 For the next arch, position the pointer over 
the last point created (notice that the carat 
appears [
]) and then drag down from that 
point. This creates a new direction line.
6 Click the next point, and drag up to 
complete the arch. Click the last anchor 
point you just created, to remove the 
direction line.
7 Shift-click the next point to create the second straight segment.
8 Click and drag up from the last point created, and then click and drag down on 
the last point to create the final arch. Practice repeating these paths in the lower 
artboard. Use the Direct Selection tool to adjust your path, if necessary.
9 Choose File > Save and then File > Close.

the artwork open, choose File > Close.
3 Choose File > Open, and open 
the L5start_5.ai file in the 
Lesson05 folder.
4 Choose File > Save As, name 
the file violin.ai, and select the 
Lesson05 folder in the Save 
As dialog box. Choose Adobe 
Illustrator (*.AI) from the Save As 
Type menu (Windows), or choose 
Adobe Illustrator (ai) from the Format menu (Mac OS), and click Save. In the 
Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the options set at the defaults, and then 
click OK.
5 In the Control panel, click the Fill color and choose the None swatch (
). Then, 
click the Stroke color and make sure that the black swatch is selected.
6 Make sure the Stroke weight is 1 pt in the Control panel.
Drawing curves
In this part of the lesson, you will review drawing curves by drawing the violin, its 
neck, the strings, and a curved path.
Selecting a curved path
You’ll first examine a single curve and then draw a series of curves together, using 
the template guidelines to help you.
1 Choose 2 Curved Line from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left 
corner of the Document window. 
2 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window if the artboard is not fit into the 
Document window.
	Note:  The S shaped 
scrolls in the final 
artwork were added as 
an extra touch and will 
not be covered in  
this lesson.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  157
3 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ), and 
click one of the segments of the curved 
line to view its anchor points and direction 
handles, which extend from the points. The 
Direct Selection tool lets you select and edit 
individual segments in the curved line.
With a curve selected, you can also select the 
stroke and fill of the curve. When you do this, 
the next line you draw will have the same attributes. For more information about 
these attributes, see Lesson 6, “Color and Painting.”
Drawing a curved path
Next, you’ll draw the first curve of the curved shape.
1 Choose 3 Curved Shape step 1 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the 
lower-left corner of the Document window.
Instead of clicking with the Pen tool (
) to start a path, you will drag with it to set 
the starting point and the direction of the path's curve.
2 Select the Pen tool (
), and position it 
over point A on the template. Drag from 
point A to the red dot above it.
Next, you’ll create the second anchor point 
with direction lines.
3 Drag with the Pen tool from point B to 
the next red dot.
The two anchor points are connected 
with a line segment which has a curve 
that is controlled by the direction 
handles you created. Notice that, if you 
vary the angle of dragging, you change 
the shape of the curve.
4 To complete the curved line, position the 
pointer over point C and drag from point 
C to the last red dot.
5 Control-click (Windows) or Command-
click (Mac OS) away from the path to 
stop drawing that path.
 Tip:  You can also 
end a path by clicking 
the Pen tool, pressing 
P for the Pen tool 
shortcut, or choosing 
Select > Deselect.

158 
LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
Drawing a closed path with curves
Next, you’ll finish drawing the curved shape by adding to an existing curved path. 
Even after you stop drawing a path, you can return to the path and edit it.
1 Choose 4 Curved Shape step 2 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the 
lower-left corner of the Document window.
Next, you’ll add a corner point to the path. A corner point lets you change the 
direction of the curve. A smooth point lets you draw a continuous curve.
2 Position the Pen tool (
) over point A.
The slash (/) next to the Pen tool pointer 
indicates that the cursor is over an end 
anchor point of an open path. By clicking 
that point, you can continue the path 
rather than starting a new one.
3 Press the Alt (Windows) or Option 
(Mac OS) key, and notice that the 
status bar in the lower-left corner of the 
Document window displays 
Pen: Make Corner. Press the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, and 
drag the Pen tool from anchor point A to 
the gray dot. Release the mouse button 
and then the modifier key.
4 With the Pen tool, drag from point D 
to the red dot to the right, and don't let 
go of the mouse button. Press the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, and 
drag the direction line from the red dot 
to the gold dot. Release the mouse button 
and then the modifier key.
So far, you've drawn open paths, where there 
are two distinct endpoints. Next, you’ll close a path using a smooth point.
5 Position the pointer over anchor point 
C on the template. A circle appears to 
the right of the Pen tool (
) pointer, 
indicating that you can click to close 
the path. 
	Note:  The dotted 
template lines are 
guides only. The shapes 
you create do not  
need to follow the  
lines exactly.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  159
6 Drag from point C to the gray dot, as 
shown in the figure. As you drag, pay 
attention to the line segments on either 
side of point C.
Notice that the direction handles that 
appear on both sides of a smooth point 
where you close the path are aligned along 
the same angle.
7 Control-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) away from the line, and 
choose File > Save.
Drawing the violin shape
Next, you’ll draw a single, continuous path that consists of smooth points and 
corner points. This closed shape will become the body of the violin.
1 Choose View > Violin to display the violin in the Document window. You may 
wish to zoom in further as you work through this section.
2 With the Pen tool (
) selected, starting 
at the blue square (point A), drag from 
point A to the red dot to set the starting 
anchor point and direction of the first curve.
3 With the Pen tool, begin dragging from 
point B to the red dot on the left. As you 
drag, hold down the Shift key. Release the 
mouse button and then the Shift key when 
the pointer reaches the red dot.
4 Drag from point C to the red dot.
5 Drag from point D to the red dot. 
Don't release the mouse button yet. 
When the pointer reaches the red 
dot, hold down the Alt (Windows) 
or Option (Mac OS) key and drag 
from the red dot to the gold dot. 
Release the mouse button and then 
the modifier key. This splits the 
direction lines.

10 Continue drawing the points at I and J by first dragging from the anchor point 
to the red dot and then pressing the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key 
and dragging the direction handle from the red dot to the gold dot.
Next, you’ll complete the drawing of the violin by closing the path.
11 Position the Pen tool over point A. 
Notice that an open circle appears next 
to the Pen tool pointer (
), indicating 
that the path will close when you click.
12 Drag down and to the left, to the red dot 
below point A.
As you drag down, another direction line 
appears above the point. As you drag, 
you are reshaping the path.
13 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) away from the path to 
deselect it, and then choose File > Save.
 Tip:  Pen tool practice is important and encouraged. To speed up the process of drawing 
symmetrical objects and to ensure that they are perfectly symmetrical, however, you can also 
draw half of the object and then reflect and join a copy. To learn more about reflecting objects, see 
Lesson 4, "Transforming Objects."

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  161
Creating the strings
There are many ways to create straight paths, including using the Pen tool. Next, 
you’ll draw a straight line for the strings of the violin using the Pen tool.
1 Choose 5 Strings from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of 
the Document window.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
	Note:  If you don't see “Reset Essentials” when choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials, 
first choose the Window > Workspace > Essentials and then choose Window > Workspace > Reset 
Essentials. You can also choose the same commands in the workspace switcher in the 
Application bar.
3 In the Control panel, make sure that None (
) is chosen for the Fill color and 
black is the Stroke color. Also make sure that the Stroke weight is 1 pt.
4 Choose View > Hide Bounding Box to hide the bounding boxes of 
selected objects.
5 Select the Pen tool (
), and place it in the middle 
of the circle (point A) on the artboard. Notice that 
the pointer has an asterisk next to it, indicating that 
your next click begins a new path. Click to create the 
starting anchor point.
6 Pressing the Shift key, click point B to create the 
ending anchor point. The Shift key constrains the 
placement of the anchor point to a multiple of 45°.
After clicking to create point B, a caret (^) appears 
next to the Pen tool when the pointer is positioned 
over the new point, indicating that you can create 
a direction line for a curve by dragging the Pen tool 
from this anchor point. The caret disappears when you 
move the Pen tool away from the anchor point.
7 Press the letter V to switch to the Selection tool ( ). 
The straight line will still be selected. Click in a blank area to deselect this line so 
that you can draw other lines that aren’t connected to this path.
Next, you’ll make the straight line thicker by changing its stroke weight.
8 With the Selection tool, click the line you 
just drew. In the Control panel, change 
the Stroke weight to 3 pt. Leave the line 
segment selected.
 Note:  When 
drawing with the Pen 
tool, it can be easier to 
draw paths with no fill. 
You can also change the 
fill and other properties 
of the path later.
	Note:  If you don’t 
see the Stroke weight 
option in the Control 
panel, click the line 
again, even though it 
may still be selected. 
This indicates to 
Illustrator that you are 
no longer drawing. You 
can also expand the 
Stroke panel by clicking 
its icon on the right side 
of the workspace.

162 
LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
Splitting a path
To continue creating the strings, you’ll split a path using the Scissors tool and then 
adjust the segments.
1 With the line selected, in the Tools panel, click and 
hold down the Eraser tool (
) to reveal the Scissors 
tool (
). Select the Scissors tool, and click about 
three-fourths of the way down the line to make a cut. 
See the figure for placement help.
If you don't click directly on the path, you will see a 
warning dialog box. You can simply click OK and try 
again. Cuts made with the Scissors tool must be on 
a line or a curve rather than on an endpoint. When 
you click with the Scissors tool, a new anchor point 
appears and is selected. The Scissors tool has split the line into two lines.
2 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ), and click directly 
on the top path to select it and show the anchor 
points. Click to select the bottom anchor point of that 
selected path. Begin dragging that point up, and as 
you drag, hold down the Shift key to widen the gap 
between the two split segments. Release the mouse 
button and then the key. Leave the top path selected.
Adding arrowheads
You can add arrowheads to both ends of an open path using the Stroke panel. 
There are many different arrowhead styles to choose from in Illustrator, as well as 
arrowhead editing options.
Next, you’ll add different arrowheads to the paths.
1 With the top line segment still selected, open the Stroke panel by clicking the 
Stroke panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace.
2 In the Stroke panel, choose Arrow 24 from the menu directly to the right of the 
word "Arrowheads." This adds an arrowhead to the start (top) of the line.
 Note:  If necessary, click the double arrows on the left side of the Stroke panel tab or choose 
Show Options from the panel menu to expand the panel so that you can see all of the content.
3 In the Stroke panel, change the Scale (beneath the start of the line arrowhead 
menu) to 30% by clicking the word "Scale," typing the value in the field, and 
then pressing Enter or Return.
 Note:  If you click the 
stroke of a closed shape

4 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the lower, shorter path. In the 
Stroke panel, choose Arrow 22 from the arrowheads menu to the far right of the 
word "Arrowheads." This adds an arrowhead to the end of the line, as shown in 
the figure.
5 In the Stroke panel, change the Scale (beneath the end of the line arrowhead 
menu) to 40% by typing the value in the field and then press Enter or Return.
Notice that the arrowheads are positioned inside the endpoints of the line, by 
default. Next, you will extend the arrowheads beyond the ends of the paths.
6 With the Selection tool, 
Shift-click to select the upper 
line segment so both lines 
are selected. Click the Extend 
Arrow Tip Beyond End of Path 
button (
) beneath the Scale 
value in the Stroke panel.
Notice that the arrowheads 
on both lines move slightly 
beyond the end of the lines. 
Leave both lines selected for 
the next steps.
 Tip:  Click the 
Swap Start And End 
Arrowheads button (
) 
in the Stroke panel to 
swap the starting and 
ending arrowheads on 
selected lines.
 Tip:  The Link Start 
And End Arrowhead 
Scales button (
) to 
the right of the Scale 
values in the Stroke 
panel allows you 
to link the scale 
values together so 
that, if one changes, 
the other changes 
proportionately.

LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
Creating a dashed line
Dashed lines apply to the stroke of an object and can be added to a closed path or 
an open path. Dashes are created by specifying a sequence of dash lengths and the 
gaps between them.
Next, you’ll apply a dash to both paths.
1 With both paths still selected, make sure that the 
Butt Cap button (
) is selected in the Stroke panel 
to the right of the word “Cap.” Select Dashed Line in 
the middle of the Stroke panel.
By default, this creates a repeating dash pattern of
12 pt dash, 12 pt gap.
 Tip:  To learn about the Cap and Corner options in the 
Stroke panel, search for "Change the caps or joins of a line" in 
Illustrator Help.
Next, you will change the size of the dash.
2 In the Stroke panel, select the 12 pt value in the first Dash field on the left, 
below the Dashed Line check box. Change the value to 3 pt, and press Enter or 
Return to set the value.
This creates a 3 pt dash, 3 pt gap repeating line pattern. Next, you will adjust the 
gap between each dash, using the Stroke panel.
3 Insert the cursor in the Gap field to the right of the first Dash value. Type 1 pt, 
and press Enter or Return to set the value. This creates a 3 pt dash, 1 pt gap
line pattern.
 Tip:  If you want to create a custom dash pattern that has multiple dash and gap sizes, continue 
adding values in the next dash and gap fields in the Stroke panel. This pattern will be repeated in 
the line segment.
4 With both lines still selected, choose Object > Group.
5 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
 Tip:  The Preserve 
Exact Dash And Gap 
Lengths button (
) 
allows you to retain the 
appearance of the 
dashes without aligning 
to the corners or the 
dash ends.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  165
Editing curves
In this part of the lesson, you’ll adjust the curves you’ve drawn by dragging either 
the curve’s anchor points or direction handles. You can also edit a curve by moving 
the line. You will hide the template layer to make editing the path easier.
1 Choose 4 Curved Shape step 2 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the 
lower-left corner of the Document window.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials. 
Then, click the Layers panel icon (
) on the right 
side of the workspace to expand the Layers panel. 
Click the Template Layer icon (
) in the Layers 
panel to make the template layer invisible.
 Tip:  To learn more about layers, see Lesson 8, “Working 
with Layers.”
3 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ), and click the outline of the curved shape. All 
of the points will appear.
Clicking with the Direct Selection tool displays the curve’s direction handles 
for the selected line segment and lets you adjust the shape of individual curved 
segments. Clicking with the Selection tool ( ) selects the entire path.
4 Click the anchor point that is at the top, 
just to the left of center on the curved 
shape, to select it. Press the Down Arrow 
key three times to nudge the point down.
	Note:  You can also drag the anchor point with the 
Direct Selection tool.
5 With the Direct Selection tool, drag 
across the top half of the shape to select 
the top two anchor points.
Notice that, when both points are 
selected, the handles disappear.
6 In the Control panel, click Show Handles 
For Multiple Selected Anchor Points 
(
), to the right of the word Handles, to 
see the direction lines for both selected points.
 Tip:  Pressing and 
holding down the Shift 
key and then pressing 
an arrow key moves the 
point five times further 
than pressing the 
arrow key without the 
modifier key.
	Note:  If you don’t 
select both points the 
first time, try dragging 
across them again. If 
you have at least one 
of the anchor points 
selected, you can also 
Shift-click with the 
Direct Selection tool on 
the other anchor point 
to add it to the selection.

LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
7 For the selected point on the right, drag 
the bottom control handle up and to the 
left to edit the curve.
As you drag, notice that both direction 
lines for the point are moving. Also 
notice that you can control the length of 
each direction line independently.
8 For the selected point on the left, drag 
the bottom control handle up and to the 
right to reshape the curve.
9 Choose Select > Deselect.
10 Choose File > Save.
Deleting and adding anchor points
It can be easier to work with paths if you don’t add more anchor points than 
necessary. A path with fewer points is easier to edit, display, and print. You can 
reduce a path’s complexity or change its overall shape by deleting unnecessary 
points. You can also reshape a path by adding points to it.
Next, you will delete an anchor point and then add points to the path.
1 Choose 1 Violin from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of 
the Document window.
2 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click once in the center of the 
violin shape to zoom in. You need to see the whole violin shape for the
next steps.
3 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and then click the edge of
the violin.
4 Position the pointer over the top corner 
point of the violin. Click to select the 
anchor point.
5 In the Control panel, click Remove 
Selected Anchor Points (
) to delete the
anchor point.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  167
6 With the Direct Selection tool, position 
the pointer over the top part of the path. 
Click and begin dragging the path up to 
reshape the top curve. As you drag, hold 
down the Shift key. When the path is 
reshaped, release the mouse button and 
then the modifier key. Leave the 
shape selected.
 Tip:  You can also delete a point by selecting the Pen tool and clicking an anchor point.
Next, you will add anchor points and reshape the bottom of the violin.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click twice, slowly, on the 
bottom part of the violin shape to zoom in.
2 Select the Pen tool (
) in the Tools 
panel, and position the pointer over the 
violin path to the right of the bottom 
anchor point. A plus sign (+) appears to 
the right of the Pen tool pointer. Click to 
add another point to the path.
3 Position the pointer over the path to the 
left of the bottom anchor point until 
a plus sign (+) appears to the right of 
the pointer. Click to add another point, 
making three points in a row.
4 With the Direct Selection tool ( ), click 
to select the bottom-center point. Begin 
dragging the point down and, as you 
drag, hold down the Shift key. Drag the 
point down just a bit. Release the mouse 
button and then the modifier key.
You may need to zoom in.
 Tip:  When adding points to a shape that is symmetrical, it can be difficult to make sure that they 
are the same distance from the bottom-center point. You can select the points and distribute their 
spacing based on the bottom-center point. To learn more about distributing points, see Lesson 2, 
“Selecting and Aligning.”
5 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
 Note:  Don’t use 
the Delete, Backspace, 
or Clear keys or the 
Edit > Cut or Edit > 
Clear command to 
delete anchor points; 
you will delete the  
point and the line 
segments that connect 
to that point.
 Tip:  Another way to 
add anchor points is to 
select the Add Anchor 
Point tool (
) in the 
Tools panel, position 
the pointer over a path, 
and click to add a point.

LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
Converting between smooth points and corner points
Next, you’ll finish the violin neck by adjusting a path. You’ll be converting a smooth 
point on the curve to a corner point and a corner point to a smooth point.
1 Choose 6 Violin Neck from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left 
corner of the Document window.
2 In the Layers panel, click the blank box to the left of the Template layer lock 
icon ( ) to turn on the visibility for the template layer again.
3 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click three times in the middle 
of the points A, B, C, and D.
4 With the Direct Selection tool ( ), position the pointer over point A on the left 
side of the shape. When an open square with a dot in the center (
) appears 
next to the pointer, click the anchor point to select it.
5 With the point selected, click the Convert Selected Anchor Points To Smooth 
button (
) in the Control panel.
6 With the Direct Selection tool, hold down the Shift key and click and drag the 
bottom direction handle down to reshape the bottom half of the curve. Release 
the mouse button and then the key to match the figure.

Drag the direction point down.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  169
10 With the Direct Selection tool, click to select the top point of the neck shape. 
In the Control panel, click the Cut Path At Selected Anchor Points button (
). 
Choose Select > Deselect.
11 With the Selection tool ( ), hold down the Shift key and drag the right side 
of the neck shape a little to the right. Release the mouse button and then the 
modifier key. This creates a gap between the two open paths.
12 With the Direct Selection tool, drag a marquee 
across the top two points of both paths. Then 
click the Connect Selected End Points button 
(
) in the Control panel to create a straight line 
connecting the two paths.
13 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
14 Select the Selection tool in the Tools panel, and 
then click the path to select it (even though it 
looks selected). Choose Object > Path > Join to join the open endpoints at the 
bottom of the neck shape. Leave the shape selected.
15 Select the Convert Anchor Point tool ( ), which 
is nested in the Pen tool in the Tools panel.
16 Drag the bottom-left anchor point of the neck 
shape down. As you drag, press the Shift key to 
constrain the movement. Release the mouse and 
then the Shift key.
The Convert Anchor Point tool also allows you 
to convert points from smooth to corner points, 
corner to smooth points, and much more.
17 Drag up from the bottom-right corner of the 
neck shape, pressing the Shift key as you drag, to 
make a smooth point. This makes the bottom of 
the shape round. Release the mouse button and 
then the modifier key.
18 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose
File > Save.
 Note:  Make sure to 
press the Shift key after 
you start dragging away 
from the point.
	Note:  As mentioned 
earlier in the lesson, if 
you don’t click on the 
point exactly, a warning 
dialog box may appear.

170 
LESSON 5 
Drawing with the Pen and Pencil Tools
Drawing with the Pencil tool
The Pencil tool lets you draw open and closed paths as if you were drawing with a 
pencil on paper. Anchor points are created by Illustrator and are placed on the path 
as you draw. However, you can adjust the points when the path is complete. The 
number of anchor points set down is determined by the length and complexity of 
the path and by tolerance settings in the Pencil Tool Options dialog box. The Pencil 
tool is most useful for freeform drawing and for creating more organic shapes.
Next, you will draw a few lines that will be a chin rest on the curved shape you
drew earlier.
1 Choose 4 Curved Shape step 2 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the 
lower-left corner of the Document window.
2 In the Layers panel (
), click the Template Layer icon (
) to hide the template 
layer. Click the Layers panel icon or panel tab to collapse the panel.
3 Double-click the Pencil tool (
) in 
the Tools panel. In the Pencil Tool 
Options dialog box, drag the 
Smoothness slider to the right until 
the value is 100%. This reduces the 
number of points on the paths drawn 
with the Pencil tool and makes them 
appear smoother. Click OK.
4 With the Pencil tool selected, click 
the Stroke color in the Control panel 
and select black in the Swatches panel 
that appears. Then, click the Fill color 
in the Control panel and choose None (
), if not already selected.
 Note:  The colors may already be set for the stroke and fill.
5 Position the pointer inside the curved 
shape, on the left side of the shape. When 
you see an x to the right of the Pencil tool 
pointer, drag from the left side toward 
the right side to create an arc inside the 
curved shape. See the figure for position 
and shape.
The x that appears to the right of the 
pointer before you begin drawing indicates that you are about to create a new 
path. If you don’t see the x, it means that you are about to redraw a shape that 
the pointer is near. If necessary, move the pointer further from the edge of the 
curved shape.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  171
 Tip:  To create a closed path, such as a circle, select the Pencil tool and press the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key and drag. The Pencil tool displays a small circle to indicate that you’re creating 
a closed path. When the path is the size and shape you want, release the mouse button but don’t 
release the Alt or Option key until the path closes. The beginning and ending anchor points are 
connected with the shortest line possible.
Notice that, as you draw, the path may not look perfectly smooth. When you 
release the mouse button, the path is smoothed based on the Smoothness value that 
you set in the Pencil Tool Options dialog box.
6 Position the pointer anywhere over the newly created path. Notice that the x is 
no longer next to the Pencil tool pointer. This indicates that if you drag to start 
drawing, you will edit the path from that point rather than draw a new path.
Next, you will set more options for the Pencil tool and then draw another curve to 
the right of the curved line you just drew.
7 Double-click the Pencil tool (
) in the Tools panel.
8 In the Pencil Tool Options dialog box, deselect Edit Selected Paths. Change the 
Fidelity value to 10 pixels. Click OK.
9 With the Pencil tool, click the end of the 
curved path you just drew and drag to 
the right to draw another arc shape.
10 Choose Select > Deselect.
Editing with the Pencil tool
Using the Pencil tool, you can also edit any path and add freeform lines and shapes 
to any shape. Next, you will edit the curved shape using the Pencil tool.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), select the closed curved path (not the arcs you drew 
with the Pencil tool).
2 Double-click the Pencil tool. In the Pencil Tool Options dialog box, click Reset. 
Make sure that the Edit Selected Paths option is selected (this is important for 
the next steps). Ensure that the Fidelity is 10, and change the Smoothness to 
30%. Click OK.
3 Position the Pencil tool on the top left of 
the curved path (not on the point), and 
notice that the x disappears from the 
pointer. This indicates that you are about 
to redraw the selected path.
 Tip:  The higher 
the Fidelity value, the 
greater the distance 
between anchor points 
and the fewer the 
anchor points created. 
Fewer anchor points 
can make the path 
smoother and less 
complex.
 Note:  Depending 
on where you begin 
to redraw the path 
and in which direction 
you drag, you may get 
unexpected results. 
Try redrawing if that 
happens.

4 Drag to the right to edit the curve of the 
path. When the pointer is back on the path, 
release the mouse button to see the shape.
5 Choose Select > All On Active Artboard.
 Note:  Your curved path result may not look exactly 
as you see in the figure. That’s okay. If you want, edit the 
path again, using the Pencil tool.
6 Choose Object > Group.
7 With the group selected, double-click the 
Scale tool (
) in the Tools panel. In the 
Scale dialog box that appears, change the 
Uniform Scale to 70% and then click OK.

Understanding color
When working with color in Illustrator, you first need to understand color modes 
(also called color models). When you apply color to artwork, keep in mind the final 
medium in which the artwork will be published (print or web, for instance) so that 
you can use the correct color mode and color definitions. First, you will learn about 
color modes, and then you will learn the basic color controls.
	Note:  In Mac OS, 
when opening lesson 
files, you may need to 
click the round, green 
button in the upper-left 
corner of the Document 
window to maximize 
the window’s size.
	Note:  If you don’t 
see “Reset Essentials” 
in the menu, choose 
Window > Workspace >  
Essentials before 
choosing Window >

Essentials.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  179
Color modes
Before starting a new illustration, you must first decide which color mode the 
artwork should use, CMYK or RGB.
• CMYK—Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black are the colors used in four-color 
process printing. These four colors are combined and overlapped in a screen 
pattern to create a multitude of other colors. Select this mode for printing.
• RGB—Red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to create 
an array of colors. Select this mode if you are using images for on-screen 
presentations or the Internet.
When creating a new document, you select a color mode by choosing File > New 
and picking the appropriate document Profile, such as Print, which uses CMYK for 
the color mode. You can change the color mode by clicking the arrow to the left of 
Advanced and selecting a Color Mode.
When a color mode is selected, the applicable panels open, displaying colors in 
either the CMYK or RGB mode. You can change the color mode of a document 
after a file is created by choosing File > Document Color Mode and then selecting 
either CMYK or RGB in the menu.
Understanding the color controls
In this lesson, you will learn about the traditional methods of coloring objects 
in Illustrator. This includes painting objects with colors and patterns using a 
combination of panels and tools, such as the Control panel, Color panel, Swatches 
panel, Gradient panel, Stroke panel, Color Guide panel, Color Picker, and the paint 
buttons in the Tools panel. You’ll begin by looking at finished artwork to which 
color has already been applied.

LESSON 6 
Color and Painting
Creating color
In this project, you will be working on artwork in the CMYK color mode, which 
means that will create your own color from any combination of cyan, magenta, 
yellow, and black. You can create color in a variety of ways, depending on the 
artwork. If you want to create a color that is specific to your company, for instance, 
you can use a swatch library. If you are trying to match color in artwork, you can 
use the Eyedropper tool to sample color or the Color Picker to enter exact values.
Next, you will create color using different methods and then apply that color 
to objects.
Building and saving a custom color
First, you will create a color using the Color panel, and then you will save the color 
as a swatch in the Swatches panel.
1 Choose Select > Deselect to ensure that nothing is selected.
2 Choose 1 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the 
Document window (if not selected), then choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
3 If the Color panel is not visible, click the Color 
panel icon (
). If the CMYK sliders are not 
visible, choose the CMYK color model from 
the Color panel menu (
). Click the Stroke 
box, and type the following values in the 
CMYK text fields: C=19, M=88, Y=78, K=22.
4 Click the Swatches panel icon (
), and 
choose New Swatch from the Swatches panel 
menu (
). In the New Swatch dialog box, 
name the color label background and, leaving 
the rest of the options as they are, click OK.
 Tip:  If you want to load swatches from one saved 
document into another, click the Swatch Libraries Menu 
button (
) at the bottom of the Swatches panel and 
choose Other Library. Then, locate the document with the 
swatches that you want to import.
Notice that the swatch is highlighted in the 
Swatches panel (it has a white border around 
it). New colors added to the Swatches panel are 
saved with the current document only. Opening a 
new file displays a default set of swatches.
 Note:  If an object 
is selected when you 
create a color, the 
color is applied to the 
selected object.
 Tip:  The values are 
each a percentage  
of 100.
 Tip:  To save a color 
you made in the Color 
panel, you can also click 
the New Swatch  
button at the bottom of 
the Swatches panel to 
open the New Swatch 
dialog box.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  183
5 With the Selection tool ( ), click anywhere 
in the white-filled background shape on 
the artboard to select it. Click the Fill box 
at the bottom of the Tools panel. Click the 
Swatches panel icon (
) if the panel is not 
showing, and select the label background 
swatch. Choose Select > Deselect.
Next, you will create another swatch using a 
similar method.
6 In the Swatches panel, click the New Swatch (
) button at the bottom of the 
panel to create a copy of the selected swatch.
7 In the New Swatch dialog box, change the 
name to label background stroke and change 
the values to C=19, M=46, Y=60, K=0. 
Click OK.
 Note:  If the shape had still been selected, it would be 
filled with the new color.
8 With the Selection tool ( ), click the shape 
again to select it. Click the Stroke color in 
the Control panel. When the Swatches panel 
appears, select the label background 
stroke swatch.
9 Change the Stroke weight in the Control panel 
to 7 pt. Leave the Swatches panel showing.
Editing a swatch
After a color is created and saved in the Swatches panel, you can edit that color. 
Next, you will edit the label background swatch that you just saved.
1 Select the Stroke box in the Tools panel. This expands the Color panel. Click the 
Swatches panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace.
2 With the shape still selected, double-click 
the label background stroke swatch in the 
Swatches panel. In the Swatch Options dialog 
box, change the values to C=2, M=15, Y=71, 
K=20. Select Preview to see the changes to the 
logo shape. Change the K value to 0, and then 
click OK.
 Note:  The Swatches 
panel that appears 
when you click Fill 
color in the Control 
panel is the same as 
the Swatches panel on 
the right side of the 
workspace.
 Tip:  You can 
position the pointer 
over a color swatch in 
the Swatches panel to 
see a tool tip indicating 
the name of the swatch.

184 
LESSON 6 
Color and Painting
When you create a swatch and then edit it, the objects that already have that 
swatch color applied need to be selected to apply the change.
Next, you will change the logo background swatch to a global color. When you 
edit it, a global color automatically updates throughout the artwork, regardless 
of whether the objects that use that global color are selected.
3 With the shape still selected, click the Fill box in the Tools panel.
4 Double-click the label background swatch 
in the Swatches panel to open the Swatch 
Options dialog box. Select Global, and then 
click OK.
5 Choose Select > Deselect.
6 Double-click the label background swatch 
in the Swatches panel again to open the 
Swatch Options dialog box. Change the 
K value (black) to 70. Select Preview to 
see the changes. Notice how the shape 
fill changes, even though the shape is not 
selected. That’s the purpose of a global color. Click Cancel so that the color 
change is not saved.
7 Choose File > Save.
Using Illustrator swatch libraries
Swatch libraries are collections of preset colors, such as PANTONE and TOYO, 
and thematic libraries, such as Earthtone and Ice Cream. Illustrator has default 
swatch libraries that appear as separate panels and cannot be edited. When you 
apply color from a library to artwork, the color in the library becomes a swatch 
that is saved in the Swatches panel for that document. Libraries are a great starting 
point for creating colors.
Next, you will create a yellow spot color using a PANTONE+ library for another 
shape in the label. When this color is defined, it could be a warm, dark, or light 
yellow. This is why most printers and designers rely on a color matching system, 
like the PANTONE system, to help maintain color consistency and to give a wider 
range of colors, in some cases.
 Note:  The white 
triangle in the lower-
right corner of a 
swatch icon (
) in 
the Swatches panel 
indicates a global color.
 Note:  Most, but not 
all, of the libraries that 
come with Illustrator  
are CMYK colors.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  185
Spot versus process colors
You can designate colors as either spot or process color types, which correspond 
to the two main ink types used in commercial printing.
• 
A process color is printed using a combination of the four standard process inks: 
cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K) (CMYK).
• 
A spot color is a special premixed ink that is used instead of, or in addition to, 
CMYK process inks. A spot color requires its own printing plate on a 
printing press.
Creating a spot color
In this section, you will see how to load a color library, such as the PANTONE 
color system, and how to add a PANTONE Matching System (PMS) color to the 
Swatches panel.
1 In the Swatches panel, click the Swatch Libraries Menu button (
). Choose 
Color Books > PANTONE+ Solid Coated. 
The PANTONE+ solid coated library appears in its own panel.
2 Type 100 in the Find field. The PANTONE 100 C swatch is highlighted in the 
swatches. Click the highlighted swatch to add it to the Swatches panel. Close 
the PANTONE+ Solid Coated panel. The PANTONE color appears in the 
Swatches panel.
3 Position the pointer on the artboard and, holding down the spacebar, drag to 
the right so that you can see both the white-filled shape off the left edge and the 
content on the first artboard.
4 With the Selection tool ( ), click the white-filled 
shape off the left edge of artboard 1 to select it. 
From the Fill color in the Control panel, choose 
the PANTONE 100 C color to fill the shape. 
Change the Stroke color to None (
).
5 With the shape still selected, Shift-click to 
select the original red label background shape 
on the first artboard. Release the Shift key.
 Note:  When you 
exit Illustrator and 
then relaunch it, the 
PANTONE library panel 
does not reopen. To 
automatically open 
the panel whenever 
Illustrator opens, 
choose Persistent from 
the PANTONE+ Solid 
Coated panel menu.

6 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
7 With the Selection tool, click the red shape once more to make it the key object.
8 In the Control panel, click the Horizontal Align 
Center button ( ) and the Vertical Align Center 
button (
) to align the yellow shape to the red 
label shape.
	Note:  If you don’t see the Align options, click the word 
“Align” in the Control panel to reveal the Align panel.
9 Choose Select > Deselect.
10 Choose File > Save. Keep the file open.
Why does my PANTONE swatch 
look different from the other 
swatches in the Swatches panel?
In the Swatches panel, the color type is identified by the icon that appears next to 
the name of the color. You can identify spot-color swatches by the spot-color icon 
(
) when the panel is in List view or by the dot in the lower corner (
) when the 
panel is in Thumbnail view. Process colors do not have a spot-color icon or a dot.
By default, the PANTONE solid coated swatch is defined as a spot color. A spot color 
is not created from a combination of CMYK inks but is its own solid ink color. A press 
operator uses a premixed PMS color in the press, offering more consistent color.
A triangle indicates that the color is global. If a global color is edited, all color 
references used in the illustration are updated. Any color can be global, not only 
PANTONE colors. To learn more about spot colors, search for “spot colors“ in 
Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
Using the Color Picker
The Color Picker lets you select color in a color field and in a spectrum by either 
defining colors numerically or by clicking a swatch.
Next, you will create a color using the Color Picker and then save the color as a 
swatch in the Swatches panel.
1 In the lower half of artboard 1, with the Selection tool ( ), click one of the white 
bars in the lower part of the label shape to select the underlying white shape.
	Note:  To learn more 
about what key objects 
are and how to work 
with them, see Lesson 2, 
“Selecting and Aligning.”

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  187
2 Double-click the Fill box in the Tools panel to open the Color Picker.
 Tip:   You can double-click the Fill box or Stroke box in the Color panel to access the 
Color Picker.
3 In the Color Picker dialog box, type these values into the CMYK text 
fields: C=0, M=11, Y=54, and K=0.
Notice that the slider in the color spectrum bar and the circle in the color field 
move as you enter the CMYK values. The color spectrum shows the hue, and 
the color field shows saturation (horizontally) and brightness (vertically).
4 Select S (saturation) to change the color spectrum displayed in the Color Picker. 
The color spectrum bar becomes the saturation of the orange color. Drag the 
color spectrum slider up until the S value is 60%, and then click OK.
The white shape is filled with the yellow/orange color you just made in the 
Color Picker.
 Note:  The Color Swatches button in the Color Picker shows you the swatches in the Swatches 
panel and the default color books (the sets of swatches that come with Illustrator) and lets you 
select a color from one. You can return to the color models view by clicking the Color Models button 
and editing the swatch color values, if necessary.
5 Change the Stroke color in the Control panel to 
None (
).
Next, you will save the color in the Swatches panel.
6 Ensure that the Fill box is selected (in front) at the 
bottom of the Tools panel.
This ensures that, when you create a new swatch, 
it is created using the fill of the selected shape.
7 Click the Swatches panel icon (
) to show the panel, if it’s not already showing.
8 Click the New Swatch button (
) at the bottom of the Swatches panel, and 
name the color yellow/orange in the New Swatch dialog box. Select Global, and 
then click OK to see the color appear as a swatch in the Swatches panel.
9 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
 Tip:  If you work in 
Adobe Photoshop or 
Adobe InDesign, the 
Color Picker may be 
familiar, because those 
programs also have a 
Color Picker feature.

Creating color groups
In Illustrator, you can save colors in color groups, which consist of related color 
swatches in the Swatches panel. Organizing colors by their use, such as grouping all 
colors for a logo, is helpful for organization and to be able to edit all of those colors 
together, if necessary. Only spot, process, and global colors can be in a group.
Next, you will create a color group using the label colors you’ve created.
1 In the Swatches panel, click a blank area of the panel to deselect the color 
swatches. Click the label background swatch (red) and, holding down the Shift 
key, click the yellow/orange swatch to the right to select four color swatches.

6 Drag the PANTONE 100 C swatch to the right of the yellow/orange swatch.
 Note:  If you drag the PANTONE 100 C swatch too far to the right, you may pull it out of the 
group. If that happens, you can always drag it back into the group.
7 Choose File > Save.
Working with the Color Guide panel
The Color Guide panel can provide you with color inspiration as you create your 
artwork. Use it to pick harmony rules such as color tints, analogous colors, and 
much more. In this panel, you can also access the Edit Color/Recolor Artwork

group. Drag the largest red marker on the right side of the color wheel up and 
to the right edge of the color wheel.
6 Change the Brightness by dragging the Adjust Brightness slider below the color 
wheel to the right, to brighten all the colors at once. Leave the Edit Colors 
dialog box open.
	Note:  You can match the H, S, B (hue, saturation, brightness) values below the color wheel in the 
Edit Colors dialog box to what you see in the figure, if you want to match exactly the color 
we achieved.
The Recolor Art selection at the bottom of the Edit Colors dialog box is dimmed 
because no artwork is selected. If artwork is selected when you open this dialog 
box, the dialog box is called the Recolor Artwork dialog box and any edits you 
make change the color group and artwork.
	Note:  The larger marker in the color wheel with the double circle is the base color of the
color group.
Rename the color group.	
Edit the color and brightness.

Working with the Kuler panel
The Kuler panel is a portal to themed color groups, such as Ice Cream, created by an 
online community of designers. You can browse lots of color groups and download 
them to edit or use. You can also create themed color groups to share with others.
Next, you will download a themed color group for an Italian restaurant and apply 
color to it.
1 Choose 3 Artboard 3 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left 
corner of the Document window.
2 Choose Window > Extensions > Kuler.
 Note:  You need an Internet connection to access the Kuler themes.
3 In the Kuler panel, click the Highest Rated menu and choose Most Popular. The 
Kuler panel shows you the newest themes, highest rated themes, and more.
4 To search for themes, type Italian restaurant in the Search field at the top of 
the panel and press Enter or Return. This brings in the themes related to the 
words “Italian restaurant.”
5 Click the Italian Restaurant theme that looks 
something like this (
) in the search results 
(below the search field). If the Italian Restaurant 
theme does not appear, select another. Click the Add

if it isn’t already open.
Notice that the new color group, Italian Restaurant, 
appears in the panel list of swatches (scroll down, if 
necessary).
8 Choose File > Save.
 Note:  Because the 
themes are constantly 
updated and are 
brought into the Kuler 
panel via the Internet, 
your Kuler panel may 
show different themes 
from those shown in 
the figures.
 Note:  To learn 
more about the Kuler 
panel options, search 
for “Kuler panel” in 
Illustrator Help (Help >

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  197
Assigning colors to your artwork
The Assign tab of the Recolor Artwork dialog box lets you assign colors from a 
color group to your artwork. You can assign colors in several ways, including using 
a new color group chosen from the Harmony Rules menu. Next, you will assign 
new colors to a third version of the label.
1 Choose Select > All On Active Artboard.
2 Click the Recolor Artwork button (
) in the Control panel.
3 Click the Show Color Group Storage icon ( ) (the small arrow) on the right side 
of the dialog box to show the color groups, if they aren’t already showing. Make 
sure that, in the top left of the dialog box, the Assign button is selected.
On the left side of the Recolor Artwork dialog box, notice that the colors of the 
label are listed in the Current Colors column, in what is called “Hue-Forward” 
sorting. That means they are arranged, from top to bottom, in the ordering of 
the color wheel: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.
	Note:  If the colors in the Kuler group you selected earlier were different than what we selected, 
the colors in this section will also look a little different and that’s okay.
4 Under Color Groups in the Recolor Artwork panel, select the Italian Restaurant 
color group you saved from the Kuler panel.
On the left side of the Recolor Artwork dialog box, notice that the colors of 
the Italian Restaurant color group are assigned to the colors in the label. The 
Current Colors column shows what the color was in the label, and the New 
column shows what the color has become (or been “reassigned to”). Also, notice 
that the two yellow colors in the original label are now next to each other and 
are mapped to a single color. This is because there are only five colors in the 
Italian Restaurant group and six in the label.
	Note:  If the colors of the label do not change, make sure that Recolor Art is selected at the 
bottom of the Recolor Artwork dialog box.

5 Click the Hide Color Group Storage icon ( ) to hide the color groups. Drag the 
dialog box by the title bar at the top so that you can see the artwork.
6 In the New column of the Recolor Artwork dialog box, drag the red color down 
on top of the green color below it. See the first part of the figure below.
This swaps the green and red colors in the artwork order and changes the color 
in the artwork on the artboard.
7 Drag the colors back to their original order.
The colors in the New column show what you see in the artwork. If you click 
one of the colors, notice that the HSB sliders at the bottom of the dialog box let 
you edit that one color.

color edits to the Italian Restaurant color group.
10 Click the arrow between the lighter green 
color in the Current Color column and the 
light brown color in the New column.
In the artwork, the color on the label 
changes. By clicking the arrow between a 
current color and a new color, you prevent 
the current color in the row (the light green) 
from being reassigned to the new color (light 
brown). It stays light green (in this case).
Reorder the New colors.	
Double-click the brown color.	
Select the label background swatch. 

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  199
11 Drag the light green bar up on top of the dark brown bar in the current color 
list. Notice the color change in the artwork.
When you drag a color in the current color column onto another row in the 
same column, you are telling Illustrator to apply the same new color (the green 
in this case) to both colors. The green color in the New column is split into three 
sections (
). The darkest color in the row (the dark brown gray) is replaced 
with the green. The lighter green color is replaced with a proportionally lighter 
tint of the green.
12 Click the Show Color Group Storage icon ( ) to show the color groups on the 
right side of the dialog box. Click the Save Changes To Color Group button (
) 
to save the changes to the color group without closing the dialog box. Click OK. 
The color changes that you made to the color group are saved in the 
Swatches panel.
13 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Adjusting colors
Next, you will change the original label on artboard 1 to use CMYK colors only. 
You’ll convert the yellow color PANTONE 100 C to CMYK.
1 Choose 1 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the 
Document window.
2 Choose Select > All On Active Artboard.
3 Choose Edit > Edit Colors > Convert To CMYK. 
The colors in the selected label, including the 
yellow PANTONE 100 C, are now CMYK. 
There are many options in the Edit > Edit 
Colors menu for converting color, including 
Recolor With Preset. This command lets you 
change the color of selected artwork using a 
chosen number of colors, a color library, and a 
specific color harmony (such as complementary colors).
4 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
	Note:  If you want to 
apply a single color to 
the selected artwork, 
you can choose 1 from 
the Colors menu, above 
the New column in the 
Recolor Artwork dialog 
box. Be sure to finish 
the steps in this lesson 
before experimenting 
with this.
	Note:  Many kinds 
of color edits can be 
made to selected 
artwork in the Recolor 
Artwork dialog box. 
To learn more, search 
for “Working with 
color groups” in 
Illustrator Help.
	Note:  Using this 
method for converting 
to CMYK does not affect 
the color swatches in 
the Swatches panel. 
It simply converts the 
selected artwork colors 
to CMYK.

LESSON 6 
Color and Painting
Painting with patterns
In addition to process and spot colors, the Swatches panel can also contain pattern 
and gradient swatches. Illustrator provides sample swatches of each type in the 
default Swatches panel and lets you create your own patterns and gradients. In this 
section, you will focus on creating, applying, and editing patterns. To learn more 
about working with gradients, see Lesson 10, “Blending Colors and Shapes.”
Applying existing patterns
A pattern is artwork saved in the Swatches panel that can be applied to the stroke 
or fill of an object. You can customize existing patterns and design patterns from 
scratch with any of the Illustrator tools. All patterns start with a single tile that is 
tiled (repeated) within a shape, starting at the ruler origin and continuing to the 
right. Next, you will apply an existing pattern to a shape.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
2 Click the Layers panel icon (
) to expand the Layers panel.
3 In the Layers panel, click to select the visibility 
column to the left of the layer named pattern.
4 Click the Swatches panel icon (
). In the 
Swatches panel, click the Swatch Libraries Menu 
button (
) at the bottom of the panel and choose 
Patterns > Decorative > Vonster Patterns to open 
the pattern library.
5 Using the Selection tool ( ), select the white filled shape toward the top of the 
artboard. In the Control panel, change the Stroke color to None (
). Make sure 
that the Fill box toward the bottom of the Tools panel is selected.
	Note:  This last step is important. When you apply a pattern swatch, it applies to the stroke or the 
fill that is selected.
6 Select the Blazer pattern swatch in the Vonster Patterns panel to fill the path 
with the pattern. Close the Vonster Patterns panel, and notice that the pattern 
swatch fills the shape and is added to the list in the Swatches panel. Click the 
Swatches panel icon to collapse the panel.
7 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
 Tip:  Because some 
supplied patterns have 
a clear background, you 
can create a second fill 
for the object, using the 
Appearance panel. For 
more information, see 
Lesson 13, “Applying 
Appearance Attributes 
and Graphic Styles.”

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  201
Creating your own pattern
In this section of the lesson, you will create your own custom pattern and add it to 
the Swatches panel.
1 Select the Rectangle tool (
) in the Tools panel. 
Click once in a blank area of the artboard to open the 
Rectangle dialog box. Change the Width to 34 pt and 
the Height to 34 pt, and then click OK.
Notice that the new rectangle has the same pattern 
fill as the shape in the previous steps. You will use 
this shape as the basis for your new pattern.
2 With the rectangle selected, press the letter D to set the default stroke (black) 
and fill (white) on the selected shape. A pattern that you create cannot contain 
another pattern.
3 With the rectangle selected, choose Object > Pattern > Make. Click OK in the 
dialog box that appears.
When you create a pattern, Illustrator enters Pattern Editing mode, which 
is similar to Isolation mode you’ve worked with in grouped content. Pattern 
Editing mode allows you to create and edit patterns interactively, while 
previewing the changes to the pattern on the artboard. The Pattern Options 
panel (Window > Pattern Options) also opens, giving you all of the necessary 
options to create your pattern.
4 Select the Selection tool ( ), and click the center 
rectangle to select it. Press Ctrl++ (Windows) or 
Command++ (Mac OS) twice to zoom in.
Notice the series of lighter colored rectangles 
around the center rectangle. This is the rectangle 
shape repeated into a pattern and dimmed to let 
you focus on the original rectangle.
5 With the shape selected, double-click 
the Rotate tool (
) in the Tools panel. 
In the Rotate dialog box, change the 
Angle value to 45. Click OK.
Notice the blue rectangle in the center 
of the pattern. This indicates the tile 
edge (which is a part of the pattern 
definition area).
	Note:  You don’t 
have to have anything 
selected to start with a 
blank pattern.
	Note:  A pattern 
can be composed of 
more than one shape. 
For instance, to create 
a flannel pattern for a 
shirt, you can create 
three overlapping 
rectangles or lines, 
each with varying 
appearance options.

202 
LESSON 6 
Color and Painting
6 Select the Selection tool and, pressing the 
Shift+Alt (Windows) or Shift+Option (Mac 
OS) keys, drag the top bounding point of the 
selected rectangle down until the width and 
height are approximately 30 pt.
Notice that the tile area (the blue box) didn’t 
change in size and that the rectangles have 
more space between them. At this point, 
you can edit the existing artwork, add new 
artwork, or delete artwork.
7 In the Pattern Options panel, change the Name 
to checker (the name is what appears in the 
Swatches panel as a tool tip). Choose Hex By 
Column for the Tile Type.
You have three Tile Type choices: the default 
grid pattern, a brick style pattern, or the hex 
pattern. The Brick Offset options can be selected 
when you choose a brick Tile Type.
8 Click the Pattern Tile Tool button (
) in 
the upper-left corner of the Pattern Options 
panel. Position the pointer over the right, 
middle tile size control widget of the blue 
tile. Press the Alt (Windows) or Option 
(Mac OS) key, and drag the widget to the 
right a bit to make it wider.
To stop editing the pattern tile, you can 
either select any tool in the Tools panel 
or click the Pattern Tile Tool button (
). 
Instead of manually dragging to resize the tile with the Pattern Tile Tool, you 
can also enter values in the Width and Height fields in the Pattern Options 
panel. You can do this only if Size Tile To Art is not selected.
9 Select Size Tile To Art in the Pattern Options panel.
The Size Tile To Art selection fits the tile area (the blue hex shape) to the 
bounds of the artwork, changing the spacing between the repeated objects. You 
can manually change the width and the height of the pattern definition area to 
include more content or to edit the spacing between.
10 Change the H Spacing to 5 pt, and change the V Spacing to -5 pt.
 Tip:  The spacing values can be either positive or negative values, to move the tiles apart or to 
bring them closer together.
	Note:  The figure at 
right shows the pattern 
before resizing.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  203
11 For Overlap, click the Bottom 
In Front button (
), to see the 
change in the pattern.
The artwork in a pattern may 
begin to overlap, due to the size 
of the tile or the spacing values. 
By default, when objects overlap 
horizontally, the left object is 
on top; when objects overlap 
vertically, the top object is on top.
The Pattern Options panel has a host of other pattern editing options, including 
the ability to see more or less of the pattern, called Copies. To learn more about the 
Pattern Options panel, search for “Pattern options” in Illustrator Help.
12 Choose Edit > Undo Pattern Options twice to remove the overlap change and 
the vertical spacing change, but keep the horizontal spacing at 5 pt.
13 Select Show Swatch Bounds at the bottom of the Pattern Options panel to see 
the dotted area that will be saved in the swatch. Deselect Show 
Swatch Bounds.
14 With the rectangle still selected, 
change the Fill color to CMYK 
Cyan in the Control panel.
15 Click Done in the bar along the 
top of the Document window.
16 Choose File > Save.
Applying a pattern
You can assign a pattern using a number of different methods. In this lesson, you 
will use the Swatches panel to apply the pattern. You can also apply the pattern 
using the Fill color in the Control panel.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), click the shape 
filled with the Blazer pattern swatch near the 
top of the artboard.
3 Select the checker pattern swatch from the Fill 
color in the Control panel.
4 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
 Tip:  If you want 
to create pattern 
variations, you can click 
Save A Copy in the bar 
along the top of the 
Document window. 
This saves the current 
pattern in the Swatches 
panel as a copy and 
allows you to  
continue creating.
	Note:  Your pattern 
may look different, and 
that’s okay.

Editing a pattern
Next, you will edit the saved pattern and then update all instances in your artwork.
1 In the Swatches panel, double-click the checker pattern swatch to edit it.
 Tip:  You can also select an object filled with a pattern swatch, and with the Fill box selected in 
the Tools panel, choose Object > Pattern > Edit Pattern.
2 In Pattern Editing mode, with the Selection 
tool, click to select the center diamond shape 
in the tile. In the Control panel, change the 
fill color to the yellow swatch named label 
background stroke (in a color group) and the 
Stroke weight to 0.
3 Click Done to exit Pattern Editing mode.
4 Click the shape with the checker pattern 
fill to select it. Double-click the Scale 
tool (
) in the Tools panel to make 
the pattern larger without affecting the 
shape. In the Scale dialog box, change the 
Uniform Scale to 110%. Deselect Scale 
Strokes & Effects, if necessary. Deselect 
Transform Objects, which selects 
Transform Patterns, and select Preview 
to see the change. Click OK.
5 On the artboard, select and delete the 
original white rectangle that you used to 
create the pattern.
6 Open the Layers panel, and make all layers visible by selecting the Visibility 
column to the left of the tomato and top shapes layers. Click the Layers panel 
icon to collapse the panel group.
7 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
8 Choose File > Close.

Working with Live Paint
Live Paint lets you paint vector graphics intuitively, by automatically detecting 
and correcting gaps that otherwise would have affected how fills and strokes 
were applied. Paths divide the drawing surface into areas, any of which can be 
colored, regardless of whether the area is bounded by a single path or by segments 
of multiple paths. Painting objects is like filling in a coloring book or using 
watercolors to paint a pencil sketch. Live Paint does not edit the underlying shapes.
Creating a Live Paint group
Next, you will open a file and paint objects using the Live Paint Bucket tool.
1 Choose File > Open, and open the L6start_2.ai 
file in the Lesson06 folder.
2 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog 
box, name the file greetingcard.ai and navigate 
to the Lesson06 folder. Leave the Save As 
Type option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) 
(Windows) or the Format option set to Adobe 
Illustrator (ai) (Mac OS), and click Save. In the Illustrator Options dialog box, 
leave the Illustrator options at their default settings and then click OK.
3 Use the Selection tool ( ) to drag a selection across the three white flower 
shapes on the artboard. The rest of the content is locked.
4 Choose Object > Live Paint > Make.
This creates a Live Paint group that you 
can now paint using the Live Paint Bucket 
tool (
). Once a Live Paint group is created, 
each path remains fully editable. When you 
move or adjust a path’s shape, the colors are 
automatically reapplied to the new regions that 
are formed by the edited paths.
5 Select the Live Paint Bucket tool (
) from the Shape Builder tool (
) group 
in the Tools panel. Before painting, click the Fill color in the Control panel and 
select the yellow/orange swatch in the Swatches panel.
6 Position the pointer over the center of the 
Live Paint group. As you move over Live 
Paint objects, they are highlighted and three 
color swatches appear above the pointer. The 
swatches represent the three adjacent swatches 
in the Swatches panel. The center swatch is the 
last selected color. Click when the larger, center 
flower shape is highlighted.
	Note:  The final 
lesson file L6end_2.ai is 
in the Lesson06 folder 
in the Lessons folder if 
you wish to open it.
 Tip:  You can tell 
it’s a Live Paint group 
because of the special 
bounding box around 
all three shapes.
 Note:  You may 
need to press the 
Escape key to hide the 
Swatches panel.
 Tip:  You can also 
drag across multiple 
shapes to apply color to 
them all at once.

7 Move the pointer to the left, to the overlapping 
shape. Click the Left Arrow key twice to 
highlight the light yellow color in the three 
swatches above the pointer. Click to apply the 
color to the flower.
 Note:  You can also switch to a color other than the 
one selected in the group by clicking a color in the 
Swatches panel.
8 Paint the remaining three flower shapes using 
the colors you see in the figure at right (yellow, 
pink, and dark pink). Before clicking to apply 
a color, press the Left and Right Arrow keys to 
cycle through the colors in the Swatches panel.
Painting strokes with the Live Paint Bucket tool 
is just as easy as painting fills. First, you need to 
enable the option to paint strokes.
9 Double-click the Live Paint Bucket tool in 
the Tools panel. This opens the Live Paint 
Bucket Options dialog box. Select the Paint 
Strokes option, and then click OK.
Next, you’ll remove the inner black strokes 
from the shapes and retain the outer 
black strokes.
10 Position the tip ( ) part of the pointer directly 
over the stroke, between the center shape and 
the light yellow filled shape, as shown in the 
figure. When the Stroke pointer (
) appears, 
click the Left Arrow key to select None and 
then click the stroke to remove the stroke color.
11 Position the pointer directly over the stroke, 
between the center shape and the light pink 
filled shape, as shown in the figure. When 
the Stroke pointer appears, ensure that None 
appears in the swatches above the pointer and 
then click the stroke to remove the stroke color.
12 Choose Select > Deselect to see how the strokes 
are now painted. Then, choose File > Save.

Editing Live Paint regions
When you make a Live Paint group, each path remains editable. When you move 
or adjust a path, the colors that were previously applied don’t just stay where they 
were, like they do in natural media paintings or image-editing software. Instead, the 
colors are automatically reapplied to the new regions that are formed by the edited 
paths. Next, you will edit the paths and add another shape.
1 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and then hold down the 
spacebar and drag the artboard to the right to reveal the white flower shape off 
the left edge of the artboard.
2 Select the flower shape, and choose Edit > Copy.
3 Double-click the Hand tool (
) to fit the artboard in the Document window.
4 With the Selection tool, double-click the Live Paint group.
Illustrator enters Isolation mode and allows you to edit each shape independently.
5 Choose Edit > Paste. Drag the pasted flower 
shape down to the lower left so that it overlaps 
the center flower, as shown in the figure.
6 Select the Live Paint Bucket tool (
) in the 
Tools panel, and paint the outer half of the 
pasted flower with dark green and the inner 
half with light green.
7 Position the pointer directly over the stroke, 
between the center orange shape and the green-
filled shape. When the Stroke pointer appears, 
click the Left Arrow key to highlight None and 
then click the stroke to remove the stroke color. Do this for the last remaining 
stroke inside the green-filled shape as well.
8 Select the Selection tool, and drag the green-
filled flower shape a little up and to the left, to 
reposition it. Notice how the color fill changes.
9 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ) in the Tools 
panel, and position the pointer over the small 
yellow flower in the upper-left corner. Click one 
of the anchor points on the edge of the center 
flower (located in the middle of the small yellow 
flower), and drag to reposition it.
	Note:  When you 
move or edit shapes 
that are part of a 
Live Paint group, 
unexpected things can 
happen. For instance, 
a stroke may appear 
where there was 
none before. Be sure 
to double-check the 
shapes to make sure 
that they look like 
they should.

208 
LESSON 6 
Color and Painting
Notice how the paths are still completely editable and the colors are 
automatically reapplied to the new regions that are formed by the edited paths.
Next, you will add a white color to the center of the larger flower so that you can 
add text and make it readable.
10 Press Ctrl++ (Windows) or Command++ (Mac OS) twice to zoom in. Press 
Escape to exit Isolation mode, and then choose Select > Deselect.
11 Expand the Layers panel by clicking the Layers 
panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace. 
Click the visibility column for the layer named 
text (just above the eye icon for the layer named 
live paint). Collapse the Layers panel group.
12 Select the Selection tool ( ), and double-click the 
flower shapes to enter Isolation mode.
13 Select the Line Segment tool (
) in the Tools panel. Change the Stroke color to

14 Click the center of the orange flower and, in the Line Segment Tool Options 
dialog box, change the Length to 2.55 in and the Angle to 0. Click OK, and leave 
the line selected.
15 Select the Selection tool. In the 
Control panel, with the center point 
selected in the reference point locator (
), change the X value to 4.48 in and 
the Y value to 1.8 in to position the line and leave a small gap on the right end of 
the line between the end of the line and the flower shape.
16 Select the Line Segment tool (
) and draw another line below that by pressing 
the Shift key and clicking the right edge of the green flower and then dragging to 
the right, to the point where the line snaps to the left edge of the light pink shape. 
The Smart Guides (View > Smart Guides) help you snap the line to the shapes.
17 Select the Live Paint Bucket tool in the Tools panel, and position the cursor over 
the center of the large orange flower, between the lines. Do not click.
Note that the bottom line “closes” the bottom of the flower shape, but the top 
line may not close the top of the path. That means that if you were to click 
(don’t), the color would fill everywhere that the red outline surrounds. The red 
line in the figure below has been enhanced to see it more easily.
Draw the bottom line.	
Hover to see the paint area.
 Note:  If you see  
the word “Transform,”

any gaps it detects in red. Setting the gap 
detection stops paint from leaking through 
some of the gaps between objects as you 
paint. Look at the artwork to see any gaps highlighted in red. The gap between the 
top line and the right edge of the flower shape should be closed with a red line. If 
not, you can try choosing Large Gaps from the Paint Stops At menu. Click OK.
3 Select the Live Paint Bucket tool (
), and 
cross over the space between the two lines you 
drew. Make sure that white is showing in the 
swatches above the pointer, and then click to 
fill the space with white.

5 Select the Live Paint Selection tool (
) in the Tools panel, from the Live Paint 
Bucket tool group. Click the top yellow/orange shape, and Shift-click the 
bottom yellow/orange shape, as shown in the figure below. Choose the gradient 
swatch named background from the Fill color in the Control panel.
6 Select the Gradient tool (
) in the Tools panel. Make sure that the Fill box is 
selected towards the bottom of the Tools panel. Drag from the center of the 
large flower shape (in the white area) down and to the right to create a uniform 
gradient across both shapes.
7 Select the Selection tool ( ), and press Escape to exit Isolation mode and to see 
the “Happy Birthday” text on the artboard.
Select the pieces.	
Drag with the Gradient tool.	
The final result.
8 Choose File > Save then File > Close.

Review answers
1 To fill an object with color, select the object and change the Fill color or Stroke color 
in the Control panel or select the Fill box in the Tools panel. Then do one of 
the following: 
• 
Double-click the Fill or Stroke box in the Tools panel to access the Color Picker.
• 
Drag the color sliders, or type values in the text boxes in the Color panel.
• 
Click a color swatch in the Swatches panel.
• 
Select the Eyedropper tool, and then click a color in the artwork.
• 
Choose Window > Swatch Libraries to open another color library, and then click a 
color swatch in the Color Library panel.
2 You can save a color for painting other objects in your artwork by adding it to the 
Swatches panel. Select the color, and do one of the following: 
• 
Drag it from the Fill box, and drop it over the Swatches panel.
• 
Click the New Swatch button at the bottom of the Swatches panel.
• 
Choose New Swatch from the Swatches panel menu. 
You can also add colors from other color libraries by selecting them in the Color 
Library panel and choosing Add To Swatches from the panel menu.
3 To name a color, double-click the color swatch in the Swatches panel or select it and 
choose Swatch Options from the panel menu. Type the name for the color in the 
Swatch Options dialog box.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  211
4 The Color Guide panel is a tool you can use for inspiration while you create your 
artwork. The panel suggests color harmonies based on the current color in the
Tools panel.
5 You use the Edit Colors/Recolor Artwork dialog box to create and edit color groups, to 
reassign or reduce the colors in your artwork, and more.
6 Easily create and edit seamlessly tiled vector patterns. Either create content for the 
pattern or deselect all content and choose Object > Pattern > Make. In Pattern Editing 
mode you can edit the pattern and preview it.
7 Live Paint lets you paint vector graphics intuitively by automatically detecting and 
correcting gaps that otherwise would have affected how fills and strokes were applied. 
Paths divide the drawing surface up into areas, any of which can be colored, regardless 
of whether the area is bounded by a single path or by segments of multiple paths. 
Painting objects with Live Paint is like filling in a coloring book or using watercolors to 
paint a pencil sketch.

Working with type
Type features are some of the most powerful tools in Illustrator. You can add a 
single line of type to your artwork, create columns and rows of text like you do in 
Adobe InDesign, flow text into a shape or along a path, and work with letterforms 
as graphic objects.
You can create text in three different ways: as point type, area type, and type on a 
path. Following is a short description of each type of text:
• Point type is a horizontal or vertical line of text that begins where you click 
and expands as you enter characters. Each line of text is independent—the line 
expands or shrinks as you edit it but doesn’t wrap to the next line. Entering text 
this way is useful for adding a headline or a few words to your artwork.
• Area type uses the boundaries of an object to control the flow of characters, 
either horizontally or vertically. When the text reaches a boundary, it 
automatically wraps to fit inside the defined area. Entering text in this way is 
useful when you want to create one or more paragraphs, such as for a brochure.
• Type on a path flows along the edge of an open or closed path. When you enter 
text horizontally, the characters are parallel to the baseline. When you enter 
text vertically, the characters are perpendicular to the baseline. In either case, 
the text flows in the direction in which points were added to the path.
Next, you will create point type and then you will create area type. Later in this 
lesson, you will also create type on a path.
Creating point type
When typing text directly into a document, you select the Type tool and click 
where you’d like the text. When the cursor appears, you can begin typing.
Next, you will enter some text at the top of the poster.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click the upper-left corner of 
the artboard twice, slowly.
2 Select the Type tool (
), and click 
where the guides meet in the upper-
left corner of the artboard. The cursor 
appears on the artboard. Type Help 
stop the spread of germs that cause 
colds and other illnesses!
By clicking with the Type tool, you 
create point type. Point type is a line 
of text that keeps going until you stop 
typing or press Return or Enter. It’s very useful for headlines.

216 
LESSON 7  Working with Type
3 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the 
Tools panel, and notice the bounding 
box around the text. Drag the 
bounding point on the right to the 
right. Notice that the text stretches as 
you drag any bounding point.
4 Choose Edit > Undo Scale and then 
View > Fit Artboard In Window.
Creating area type
To create area type, you click with the Type tool where you want the text and drag 
to create an area type object (also called a text area). When the cursor appears, 
you can type. You can also convert an existing shape or object to a type object by 
clicking on or inside the edge of the object with the Type tool.
Next, you will create area type and enter more text.
1 Choose View > Smart Guides to select the Smart Guides.
2 Select the Type tool (
), and position 
the cursor below the text you just created, 
aligned on the left guide. Drag from the 
guide down and to the right to create 
a text area with a width and height of 
approximately 2 in.
The cursor appears in the new text area.
3 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools 
panel, and click twice, slowly, in the center 
of the new text area.
4 Select the Type tool (
), and type Cover 
your mouth and nose when you cough 
or sneeze. Do not type the period.
Notice that the text wraps in the text area.
5 Select the Selection tool ( ), and notice the 
bounding box around the text. Drag the 
right center bounding point to the right, 
noticing how the text wraps within the 
object. Drag until it approximately aligns 
with the right edge of the text above it.
6 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose 
File > Save.

Area type versus point type
Illustrator provides visual indications to help you tell the difference between  
point type and area type. With the Selection tool, click to select text and its 
bounding box.
Area type has two extra boxes, called ports. Ports are used to thread (flow) text from 
one type area to another. Working with ports and threading is covered later in this 
lesson. Point type, when selected, does not have ports; instead, it has a point before 
the first letter in the first line.
Area type	
Point type
Importing a plain text file
You can import text into artwork from a file that was created in another 
application. Illustrator supports the following formats for importing text: 
• Microsoft Word (doc)
• Microsoft Word DOCX (docx)
• Microsoft RTF (rtf)
• Plain text (txt)(ASCII) with ANSI, Unicode, Shift JIS, GB2312, Chinese Big 5, 
Cyrillic, GB18030, Greek, Turkish, Baltic, and Central European encoding.
You can also copy and paste text, but formatting may be lost when text is pasted. 
One of the advantages of importing text from a file, rather than copying and 
pasting it, is that imported text retains its character and paragraph formatting. For 
example, text from an RTF file retains its font and style specifications in Illustrator.
Next, you will place text from a simple text file.
1 Before importing the text, select the Type 
tool (
) and insert the cursor at the end of 
the text “Cover your mouth and nose when 
you cough or sneeze.” Press Enter or Return, 
and leave the cursor in the text.
2 Choose File > Place. Navigate to the 
Lesson07 folder in the Lessons folder, select 
the L7copy.txt file, and click Place.

	Note:  Ensure that 
the cursor is in the  
text frame before you 
click. Otherwise, you 
may create another 
type area.

218 
LESSON 7  Working with Type
3 In the Text Import Options dialog box, 
you can set options prior to importing text. 
Leave the default settings, and then 
click OK.
The text is now placed in the text area. You 
will learn how to apply attributes to format 
text later in this lesson. Also, if you see a 
red plus sign (
) in the lower-right corner 
of the type object, this indicates that the 
text does not fit within the bounds. You 
will fix this later in the lesson.
4 Choose File > Save, and leave this file open.
By inserting the cursor in a text area, the text is automatically flowed within the 
bounds of the area. If you didn’t insert the cursor in the text area, and you placed 
the text, you could click to have Illustrator automatically create a text area that 
covers most of the page or click and drag to create a new text area in the size and 
position you want.
Placing Microsoft Word documents
When you place (File > Place) RTF (Rich Text 
Format) or Word documents (.DOC or .DOCX) in 
Illustrator, the Microsoft Word Options dialog  
box appears.
In this dialog box, you can select to keep the 
generated Table of Contents, footnotes and 
endnotes, and index text, and even choose to 
remove the formatting of the text before you 
place it.
Note:  When you place a Word document and do not select Remove Text Formatting, 
paragraph styles that were used in Word are brought into Illustrator.
Working with overflow text and text reflow
Each area type object contains an 
in port and an out port. The ports 
enable you to link to other objects 
and to create a linked copy of the 
type object. An empty port indicates that all the text is visible and that the object 
isn’t linked. A red plus sign (
) in an out port indicates that the object contains 
additional text, which is called overflow text.

Washington
In port
Out port

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  219
There are two main methods for remedying overflow text:
• Thread the text to another type object.
• Resize the type object or adjust the text.
Threading text
To thread, or continue, text from one object to the next, you have to link the 
objects. Linked type objects can be of any shape; however, the text must be entered 
in an object or along a path, not as point type (by simply clicking to create text).
Next, you will thread the overset text to another type object.
1 Use the Selection tool ( ) to select the larger type object.
2 With the Selection tool, click the out 
port (
) of the selected type object. 
The pointer changes to a loaded text 
icon (
) when you move it away.
	Note:  If you double-click, a new type object 
appears. If this happens, you can either drag 
the new object where you would like it to be 
positioned or choose Edit > Undo Link Threaded 
Text, and the loaded text icon reappears.
3 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
4 Towards the bottom of the artboard, 
click and drag from the upper-left 
corner of the aqua guide box, down 
and to the right corner of the 
guide box.
	Note:  With the loaded text icon, you can 
simply click the artboard instead of dragging to 
create a new type object. This creates a much larger type object.
5 Choose File > Save.
With the bottom type object still 
selected, notice the line between 
the two objects, which is the thread 
that tells you that the two objects 
are connected. Notice the out 
port (
) of the top type object and 
the in port (
) of the bottom type 
object (both circled in the figure at 
right). The arrow indicates that an 
object is linked to another object.

 Tip:  Another way 
to thread text between 
objects is to select an 
area type object, select 
the object (or objects) 
you want to link to, and 
then choose Type > 
Threaded Text > Create.
	Note:  If you delete 
the second type object 
(created in the previous 
step), the text is pulled 
back into the original 
object as overflow text. 
Although not visible, 
the overflow text is  
not deleted.

220 
LESSON 7  Working with Type
Creating columns of text
You can easily create columns and rows of text by using the Area Type options.
1 If the bottom type object is no longer selected, use the Selection tool ( ) to 
select it.
2 Choose Type > Area Type Options. In the Area Type Options dialog box, select 
Preview in the lower-left corner. In the Columns section of the dialog box, 
change Number to 2 and then click OK.

Area type options
You can use the Area Type Options command to create rows and columns of text. 
Read about additional options below:
• 
Number specifies the number of rows and columns you want the object 
to contain.
• 
Span specifies the height of individual rows and the width of individual 
columns. 
• 
Fixed determines what happens to the span of rows and columns if you resize 
the type area. When this option is selected, resizing the area can change the 
number of rows and columns, but not their width. Leave this option deselected 
if you want row and column widths to change when you resize the type area.
• 
Gutter specifies the distance between rows or columns.
• 
Inset Spacing controls the margin between the text and the bounding path. 
This margin is referred to as the inset spacing.
• 
First Baseline controls the alignment of the first line of text with the top of 
the object.
• 
Text Flow determines how text flows between rows and columns. 
—From Illustrator Help
 Note:  If the cursor is 
still in the type object, 
you don’t have to select 
the text area with the 
Selection tool to access 
the Area Type options.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  221
Formatting type
In this section, you’ll discover how to change text attributes, such as size, font, and 
style. You can quickly change most attributes in the Control panel.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click twice, slowly, in the 
center of the top text area that is threaded at the top of the artboard.
2 Select the Type tool (
) in the Tools panel, and insert the cursor anywhere in 
the text area. Choose Select > All, or press Ctrl+A (Windows) or Command+A 
(Mac OS) to select all the text in both threaded type objects.
In this next section, you’ll learn two different methods for selecting a font. First, 
you’ll change the font of selected text using the Font menu in the Control panel.
3 Click the arrow to the right of the Font 
menu and scroll to find and select Myriad 
Pro, if not already selected.
This sets the font for all of the threaded text.
	Note:  You may see the word “Character” instead of 
the Font menu listed in the Control panel. Click the word 
“Character” to reveal the Character panel.
4 Click three times in the first line of the text “Cover your mouth and nose when 
you cough or sneeze” to select the entire paragraph. Choose Type > Font to see 
a list of available fonts. Scroll down, and select Minion Pro > Bold. If your font 
list is long, you may need to scroll quite far to find this font (the list 
is alphabetized).
	Note:  Be careful when selecting text. If you attempt to drag across the text to select it, you may 
wind up creating a new text area.
 Tip:  If you double-
click text with the 
Selection or Direct 
Selection tool, the Type 
tool becomes selected.
 Note:  You may 
need to click the arrow 
that appears at the 
bottom of the font list 
to continue scrolling 
through the list.

LESSON 7  Working with Type
5 Make sure that the text is still selected, and then follow the instructions below. 
This next method is the most dynamic method for selecting a font.
• 
Select whatever font is listed in the 
Font menu in the Control panel, 
and begin typing the name Letter 
Gothic Std. Illustrator filters 
through the list and displays the 
font name in the field.
 Tip:  You can also click the word “Character” in the Control panel to open the Character panel 
(Window > Type > Character) and type the name of the font there. 
6 Click the arrow in the Font Style menu in the Control panel to see the available 
styles for Letter Gothic Std, and make sure Bold is selected.
Font styles are specific to each font family. Although you may have the Letter

What is OpenType?
If you frequently send files back and forth between platforms, you should be 
designing your text files using the OpenType format.
OpenType® is a cross-platform font file format developed jointly by Adobe and 
Microsoft. Adobe has converted the entire Adobe Type Library into this format and 
now offers thousands of OpenType fonts.
The two main benefits of the OpenType format are its cross-platform compatibility 
(the same font file works on Macintosh and Windows computers) and its ability to 
support widely expanded character sets and layout features, which provide richer 
linguistic support and advanced typographic control.
The OpenType format is an extension of the TrueType SFNT format that also can 
support Adobe PostScript font data and new typographic features. OpenType fonts 
containing PostScript data, such as those in the Adobe Type Library, have an .otf 
suffix in the font file name, while TrueType-based OpenType fonts have a .ttf file 
name suffix.
OpenType fonts can include an expanded character set and layout features, 
providing broader linguistic support and more precise typographic control. Feature-
rich Adobe OpenType fonts can be distinguished by the word “Pro,” which is part 
of the font name and appears in application font menus. OpenType fonts can be 
installed and used alongside PostScript Type 1 and TrueType fonts.

Resizing type objects
In this next section, you’ll see how to resize type objects to either make room for 
additional text or to make sure that threaded frames have the correct text in them.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click twice, slowly, in the 
center of the top text area that is threaded.
3 With the Selection tool ( ), click 
the text in the top text area that is 
threaded, to select it. Double-click 
the out port (
) in the lower-right 
corner of the text area.
Because the two text areas are 
threaded, double-clicking the 
out port of the top text area or 
the in port of the bottom text area breaks the connection between them. Any 
text threaded between the two type objects flows back into the first object. The 
bottom text area is still there, but it has no stroke or fill.
4 Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them off.
5 Using the Selection tool, drag 
the bottom, middle handle of the 
bounding box up until the yellow 
text “Cover Your Mouth and 
Nose” disappears. The text area 
changes in size vertically.
6 With the Selection tool, click the 
out port (
) in the lower-right 
corner of the top type object. The pointer changes to the loaded text icon (
).

When type objects are threaded, you can move them anywhere and still maintain 
the connection between them. You can even thread between artboards. When type 
objects are resized, especially those in the beginning of the thread, text can reflow.
10 Choose File > Save.
 Tip:  You can create unique type object 
shapes by deselecting the type object and 
choosing the Direct Selection tool ( ). Drag 
the edge or corner of the type object to 
adjust the shape of the path. This method 
is easier to use when View > Hide Bounding 
Box is selected. Adjusting the type path with 
the Direct Selection tool is easiest when 
you’re in Outline mode (View > Outline).
Changing paragraph attributes
As with character attributes, you can set paragraph attributes, such as alignment or 
indenting, before you enter new type or to change the appearance of existing type. 
If you select several type paths and type containers, you can set attributes for them 
all at the same time. Most of this type of formatting is done in the Paragraph panel, 
which you can access by clicking the underlined word “Paragraph” in the Control 
panel or by choosing Window > Type > Paragraph.
Now, you’ll add more space after all the paragraphs in the main text.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click twice in the center of the 
bottom text area (at the bottom of the artboard).
2 Using the Type tool (

Creating and applying text styles
Styles allow you to format text consistently and are helpful when text attributes 
need to be globally updated. Once a style is created, you only need to edit the saved 
style. Then, all text formatted with that style is updated.
Illustrator provides two types of styles:
• Paragraph—Retains character and paragraph attributes and applies them to an 
entire paragraph.
• Character—Retains the character attributes and applies them to selected text.
Creating and applying a paragraph style
First, you will create a paragraph style for the subheadings.
1 With the Type tool (
) selected, insert the cursor in the yellow subhead “Cover 
Your Mouth and Nose.”
You do not need to select text to create a paragraph style, but you do have to 
place the text insertion point in the line of text that has the attributes you are 
going to save.
2 Choose Window > Type > Paragraph Styles, and click the Create New Style 
button (
) at the bottom of the Paragraph Styles panel.
This creates a new paragraph style in the panel, called Paragraph Style 1. This 
style captures the character and paragraph formatting from the yellow subhead.
3 Double-click the style name Paragraph Style 1 in 
the list of styles. Change the name of the style to 
Subhead, and press Enter or Return to edit the 
name inline.
By double-clicking the style to edit the name, you 
are also applying the new style to the yellow subhead 
(where the cursor is). This means that if you edit the Subhead paragraph style, 
this first yellow paragraph will update as well.
4 Two paragraphs below the first yellow subhead, 
click three times on the text “Wash Your Hands” to 
select it. Select the Subhead style in the Paragraph 
Styles panel.
Notice that a plus sign (+) appears to the right of 
the style name, and the text doesn’t look exactly like the “Cover Your Mouth 
and Nose” text. The plus sign (+) means that the style has an override. An 
override is any formatting that doesn’t match the attributes defined by the style, 
for example, if you changed the font size for the selected paragraph.

232 
LESSON 7  Working with Type
5 Press the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key, and select 
the Subhead style name again 
in the Paragraph Styles panel 
to overwrite existing attributes 
on the selected text. The text 
attributes of the Subhead style are 
applied to the selected text.
	Note:  If you place a Microsoft Word document and choose to keep the formatting, the styles 
used in the Word document may be brought into the Illustrator document and show up in the 
Paragraph Styles panel.
6 With the Type tool, click three 
times in the text “Stay Home 
When Sick” to select the 
paragraph. Alt-click (Windows) 
or Option-click (Mac OS) the 
Subhead style in the Paragraph 
Styles panel.
7 Choose Select > Deselect.
Editing a paragraph style
After creating a paragraph style, you can easily edit the style formatting. Then, 
anywhere the style has been applied, the formatting will be automatically updated.
1 Double-click to the right of the name “Subhead” in the Paragraph Styles panel 
list to open the Paragraph Style Options dialog box.
 Tip:  You can also choose Paragraph Style Options from the Paragraph Styles panel menu (
).
2 Select the Indents and Spacing category on the left side of the dialog box.
3 Change the Space After 
to 10 pt. 
Since Preview is selected 
by default, you can move 
the dialog box out of the 
way to see the text change.
4 Click OK. Choose 
File > Save.
There are many options for 
working with paragraph 
styles, most of which are found in the Paragraph Styles panel menu, including 
duplicating, deleting, and editing paragraph styles.

When you sneeze or cough, always cover your mouth and

the cursor in the text.
	Note:  Clicking 
[Normal Character 
Style] ensures that any 
new text you add to 
the document will not 
have the style named 
emphasis applied.

Reshaping text with a preset envelope warp
Envelopes are objects that distort or reshape selected objects, such as text. You can 
use a preset warp shape or a mesh grid as an envelope, or you can create and edit 
your own envelope using objects on the artboard.
Next, you’ll explore the preset warp shapes that Illustrator provides.
1 Select the Type tool (
) in the Tools panel. Before typing, in the Control panel, 
change the Font Family to Myriad Pro (if it is not already selected), the Font 
Style to Bold, and the font size to 36 pt.
2 With the Type tool, click on the poster to the right of the orange face, below 
the green object (you may need to scroll up in the Document window). Exact 
placement is not important. A cursor appears.
3 Type the word COLD (all 
uppercase). Select the text with 
the Type tool, and then select the 
Eyedropper tool (
). Click the 
green fill of the object above the 
text to fill the text with the same 
green color.
4 Select the Selection tool ( ). With 
the text area selected, click the Make Envelope button (
) in the Control 
panel (not the arrow to the right). In the Warp Options dialog box, select 
Preview. The text appears as an arc.
5 Choose Bulge from the Style menu. Drag the Bend slider to the right to see 
it bend up further. You can experiment with many combinations. Drag the 
Horizontal and Vertical Distortion sliders to see the effect on the text. When 
you are finished experimenting, drag the Distortion sliders to 0%, make sure 
that the Bend is 40%, and then click OK.
6 Using the Selection tool, click to select the white placeholder circle on the green 
object above the text and then press Delete or Backspace to remove it.
COLD
 Note:  The Make 
Envelope button 
(
) does not apply an 
effect. It just turns the 
text into an envelope 
object. The same visual 
result is achieved by 
choosing Effect > 
Warp > Arc Upper. For 
more information about 
envelopes, see “Reshape 
using envelopes” in 
Illustrator Help.

236 
LESSON 7  Working with Type
7 Drag the envelope object (warped text) into the approximate center of the 
green object.
If you want to make any changes, you can edit the text and shape that make up the 
envelope warp object separately. Next, you will edit the text and then the warp shape.
8 Select the Zoom tool (
), and click several times on the warped text to zoom in.
9 With the warped text still selected, click the Edit Contents button (
) in the 
Control panel. This is how you edit the text in the warped shape.
10 Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them on.
11 Using the Type tool, position 
the cursor over the warped text. 
Notice that the text “COLD” is in 
blue and is underlined. The Smart 
Guides show you the original text. 
Click the text to insert the cursor, 
and then double-click to select 
the text.
12 Type GERM, and notice that the 
text warps automatically in the 
envelope shape. Choose Edit > 
Undo Typing to return to the 
original text (“COLD”).
Besides editing the text, you can also 
change the formatting at this point.
13 Select the Selection tool, and make 
sure that the warped text is still selected. Click the Edit Envelope button (
) in 
the Control panel.
Notice the options for the envelope warp object in the Control panel, such as 
Horizontal, Vertical, and Bend. These are the same options you saw in the Warp 
Options dialog box when you first created the envelope warp.
14 Change the Bend to 87% in the Control panel. Make sure that the H (horizontal) 
Distortion is 0 and the V (vertical) Distortion is 0.
 Tip:  If you double-
click with the Selection 
tool instead of the Type 
tool, you enter Isolation 
mode. This is another 
way to edit the text 
within the envelope 
warp object. Press 
the Escape key to exit 
Isolation mode.
 Note:  Changing the 
warp style may move 
the text on the artboard.

15 Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them off.
16 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ) in 
the Tools panel. Click to select one 
of the anchor points to the right of 
the letter D. Then, drag the selected 
point to the right a bit to change the 
warp shape.
17 Choose Edit > Undo Move.
18 Select the Selection tool and, 
holding down the Alt (Windows) 
or Option (Mac OS) key, drag the 
right, middle bounding point to the 
right. The purpose is to remove the 
gaps between the text and the green 
shape edge. See the figure for help.
19 Choose Select > Deselect, and then 
File > Save. Leave the file open.
Reshaping text with an object warp
Another way to reshape text is to create and edit your own warp object, using 
objects on the artboard.
1 With the Selection tool, click to select the warped text again. Press the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, and drag a copy of the envelope warp 
object down. Scroll down the artboard, and drop the copy of the envelope warp 
object on top of the red shape above the two columns of text.
2 Choose Object > Envelope Distort > Release to separate the text area from the 
envelope. Choose Select > Deselect. Click to select the gray envelope shape and 
delete it, leaving the text area. Click to select the text area.
3 Select the Eyedropper tool (
) in the 
Tools panel, and click the darker red 
shape surrounding the white circle.
4 With the Selection tool, click to 
select the white circle and choose 
Object > Arrange > Bring To Front.
5 Choose Edit > Copy, and then 
Edit > Paste In Front. There are now 
two white circles on top of each other, with the top one still selected.
6 Choose Object > Hide > Selection. You will use that white circle later.
7 Choose View > Outline.
 Tip:  To take the 
text out of the warped 
shape, select the text 
with the Selection 
tool and choose 
Object > Envelope 
Distort > Release. This 
gives you two objects: 
the text and an  
ellipse shape.

Creating text outlines
Converting text to outlines means converting text into vector outlines that you 
can edit and manipulate as you would any other graphic object. Text outlines are 
useful for changing the look of large display type, but they are rarely useful for body 
text or other type at small sizes. The file recipient doesn’t need to have your fonts 
installed in order to open and view the file correctly.
1 Click the Layers panel icon (
) on the right side 
of the workspace to expand the panel. Click the 
visibility column to the left of the warped text 
layer. Click the Layers panel tab to collapse it.
2 With the Selection tool, click the text 
“AH-CHOO” that appears on the 
artboard to select it. Choose Type > 
Create Outlines.
The text is no longer linked to a 
particular font. Instead, it is now 
artwork, much like any other vector art in your illustration. The AH-CHOO 
text was also warped, so the selection doesn’t match the yellow text. To have it 
match, you could choose Object > Expand Appearance.

Review questions
1 Name two methods for creating a text area in Adobe Illustrator.
2 What are two benefits of using an OpenType font?
3 What is the difference between a character style and a paragraph style?
4 What are the advantages and disadvantages of converting text to outlines?
Review answers
1 The following methods can be used for creating text areas:
• 
With the Type tool, click the artboard and start typing when the cursor appears. A 
text area is created to accommodate the text.
• 
With the Type tool, drag to create a text area. Type when a cursor appears.
• 
With the Type tool, click a path or closed shape to convert it to text on a path or 
in a text area. Alt-clicking (Windows) or Option-clicking (Mac OS) when crossing 
over the stroke of a closed path creates text around the shape.
2 The two main benefits of OpenType fonts are cross-platform compatibility (they work 
the same on both Windows and Mac OS) and support of widely expanded character 
sets and layout features, which provide richer linguistic support and advanced 
typographic control.
3 A character style can be applied to selected text only. A paragraph style is applied to an 
entire paragraph. Paragraph styles are best for indents, margins, and line spacing.
4 Converting type to outlines eliminates the need to send the fonts along with the 
file when sharing with others. You can also fill the type with a gradient and create 
interesting effects on individual letters. However, when you create outlines from text, 
you should consider the following:
• 
Text is no longer editable. The content and font cannot be changed for outlined text. 
It is best to save a layer with the original text or to use the Outline Object effect.
• 
Bitmap fonts and outline‑protected fonts cannot be converted to outlines.
• 
Outlining text that is less than 10 points in size is not recommended. When type is 
converted to outlines, the type loses its hints—instructions built into outline fonts 
to adjust their shape to display or print optimally at many sizes. When scaling type, 
adjust its point size before converting it to outlines.
• 
You must convert all type in a selection to outlines; you cannot convert a single 
letter within a string of type. To convert a single letter into an outline, create a 
separate type area containing only that letter.

8 WORKING WITH LAYERS
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Work with the Layers panel.
• Create, rearrange, and lock layers and sublayers.
• Move objects between layers.
• Locate objects in the Layers panel.
• Copy and paste objects and their layers from one file to another.
• Merge layers into a single layer.
• Apply a drop shadow to a layer.
• Make a layer clipping mask.
• Apply an appearance attribute to objects and layers.
• Isolate content in a layer.
This lesson takes approximately 45 minutes to complete. If needed, 
remove the previous lesson folder from your hard disk and copy the 
Lesson08 folder onto it.

245
Layers let you organize your work into distinct 
levels that can be edited and viewed individually 
or together. Every Adobe Illustrator document has 
at least one layer. Creating multiple layers in your 
artwork lets you easily control how artwork is printed, 
displayed, selected, and edited.

246 
LESSON 8  Working with Layers
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll finish the artwork for a television as you explore the various 
ways to use the Layers panel.
1 To ensure that the tools and panels function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CS6 preferences file. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 3.
2 Start Adobe Illustrator CS6.
	Note:  If you have not already done so, copy the Lesson08 folder from the Lessons folder on the 
Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book CD onto your hard disk. See “Copying the Classroom in a 
Book files” on page 2.
3 Choose File > Open, and open the L8end.ai 
file in the Lesson08 folder, located in the 
Lessons folder on your hard disk.
4 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
5 Choose Window > Workspace > 
Reset Essentials.
6 Click the Layers panel icon (
) on the right 
side of the workspace, or choose Window > Layers.
Separate layers are used for the objects that make up the artwork, as indicated 
by the layer names listed in the Layers panel. In the figure below, you can see the 
Layers panel (Window > Layers) and descriptions of the icons.

About layers
When creating complex artwork, it can be a challenge to keep track of all the  
items in your Document window. Small items get hidden under larger items, and 
selecting artwork becomes difficult. Layers provide a way to manage all the items 
that make up your artwork. Think of layers as clear folders that contain artwork. 
If you reshuffle the folders, you change the stacking order of the items in your 
artwork. You can move items between folders and create subfolders within folders.
The structure of layers in your document can be as simple or complex as you want it 
to be. By default, all items are organized in a single, parent layer. However, you can 
create new layers and move items into them or move elements from one layer to 
another at any time. The Layers panel provides an easy way to select, hide, lock, and 
change the appearance attributes of artwork. You can even create template layers, 
which you can use to trace artwork, and exchange layers with Adobe Photoshop.
Example of composite art and how layers break out individually.

LESSON 8  Working with Layers
Creating layers
By default, every document begins with one layer, called Layer 1. As you create 
artwork, you can rename and add layers at any time. Placing objects on separate 
layers lets you more easily select and edit them. For example, by placing type on a 
separate layer, you can change the type all at once without affecting the rest of 
the artwork.
Next, you’ll change the default layer name and then create two layers using 
different methods and a sublayer.
1 If the Layers panel isn’t visible, click the Layers panel icon (
) on the right side 
of the workspace, or choose Window > Layers.
Layer 1 (the default name for the first layer) is highlighted, indicating that it is active.
2 In the Layers panel, double-click the layer 
name Layer 1 to edit it. Type Side panel, and 
then press Enter or Return.
Instead of keeping all content on one single layer, 
you’ll create several layers and sublayers to better 
organize the content and to make it easier to 
select content later.
3 Click the Create New Layer button (
) at the 
bottom of the Layers panel, or choose New 
Layer from the Layers panel menu (
).
Layers and sublayers that aren’t named are 
numbered in sequence; for example, the 
second layer is named Layer 2.
4 Double-click the layer name Layer 2, and 
change the name to TV body.
The new layer is added above the Side panel 
layer and becomes active. Notice that the new layer has a different layer color (a 
light red) to the left of the layer name. This will become more important later, as 
you select content.
Next, you will create a layer and name it in one step, using a modifier key.
5 Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac 
OS) the Create New Layer button (
) at 
the bottom of the Layers panel. In the 
Layer Options dialog box, change the 
name to Screen, and then click OK.
 Tip:  You can easily 
delete a layer by 
selecting the layer or 
sublayer and clicking 
the Delete Selection 
button ( ) at the 
bottom of the Layers 
panel. This deletes the 
layer or sublayer and all 
content on it.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  249
6 Click the layer named Side panel once, 
and then click the Create New Sublayer 
button (
) at the bottom of the Layers panel 
to create a new sublayer in the Side panel layer.
Creating a new sublayer opens the selected 
layer to show existing sublayers. A sublayer 
is a layer within another layer. Sublayers 
are used to organize content within a layer 
without grouping or ungrouping content.
7 Double-click the new sublayer name 
Layer 4, change the name to knobs, and then 
press Enter or Return.
The new sublayer appears directly beneath its 
main layer, Side panel, and is selected.
Layers and color
By default, Illustrator assigns a unique color 
to each layer in the Layers panel. The color 
displays next to the layer name in the panel. 
The same color displays in the artwork 
bounding box, path, anchor points, and 
center point of a selected object.
You can use this color to quickly locate an 
object’s corresponding layer in the Layers 
panel, and you can change the layer color to 
suit your needs.
—From Illustrator Help
Each layer and sublayer can 
have a unique color.
Selecting and moving objects and layers
By rearranging the layers in the Layers panel, you can change the stacking order 
of objects in your artwork. On an artboard, objects in layers that are higher in the 
Layers panel list are in front of objects located on layers lower in the list. You can 
also move objects between layers and sublayers.
First, you’ll move the knobs into the knobs sublayer.
 Note:  To create a 
new sublayer and name 
it in one step, press 
the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key 
and click the Create 
New Sublayer button to 
open the Layer Options 
dialog box.

LESSON 8  Working with Layers
1 If the contents of the Side panel layer are not showing in the Layers panel, click 
the triangle to the left of the Side panel layer name. This reveals the contents of 
the Side panel layer, which was the original layer.
When a layer or sublayer in the Layers panel contains other items, a triangle 
appears to the left of the layer or sublayer name. Click the triangle to show or 
hide the contents. If no triangle appears, the layer contains no additional items.
2 Drag the bottom of the Layers panel down to make the panel taller so that you 
can see all of the layers.
3 In the artwork, using the Selection tool ( ), 
click the top smaller knob on the right side of 
the television.
Notice that the bounding box and points have 
a blue color that matches the Side panel layer 
color in the Layers panel. Also notice, in the 
Layers panel, that the layer name has a small 
blue box to the far right of the layer name and 
the object name (<Path>, in this case). This is the selected-art indicator (
) and 
is meant to show you which layer the selected content is on.
4 Click and drag the <Path> row that has the 
selected-art indicator showing onto the knobs 
sublayer. Release the mouse button when you 
see the knobs sublayer highlighted.
Notice the triangle that appears to the left 
of the knobs sublayer when you release the 
mouse button. This indicates that the sublayer 
has content.
5 Choose Select > Deselect.
6 Click the top <Group> object in the Side panel 
layer, and then press and hold the Shift key 
and click the <Group> object directly beneath 
it in the Layers panel to highlight both objects. See the figure for selection help.
7 Drag either of the highlighted rows onto the 
knobs sublayer. Release the mouse button 
when you see the knobs sublayer highlight.
This better organizes the panel and makes it 
easier to find content later.
8 Click the triangle to the left of the knobs 
sublayer to show the contents.
 Tip:  Keeping layers 
and sublayers closed 
can make it easier to 
navigate content in the 
Layers panel.

 Tip:  You can use 
the Shift key to select 
multiple sublayers and 
drag them all at once.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  251
Duplicating layer content
You can either use the Layers panel to duplicate layers and other content or use the 
Edit > Copy or Edit > Cut commands, as you have used in previous lessons.
1 Click the <Path> name in the knobs sublayer. 
Press the Alt (Windows) or Options (Mac OS) 
key, and drag the <Path> object up until a line 
appears just above the current <Path> object. 
Release the mouse button and then the key.
Dragging with the modifier key copies the 
selected content. This is the same as selecting 
the content on the artboard and choosing 
Edit > Copy and then Edit > Paste In Front.
2 Drag the left edge of the Layers panel to the left to make it wider so that you can 
more easily read the layer names.
3 Click the triangle to the left of the knobs sublayer to hide the sublayer contents. 
Hiding layer and/or sublayer contents makes the Layers panel easier to 
work with.
4 With the Selection tool ( ) selected, click to 
select the small knob in the artwork again. 
Double-click the Selection tool and, in the 
Move dialog box, change the Horizontal 
Position to 0.8 in, make sure that the 
Vertical Position is 0, and then click OK.
5 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose 
File > Save.
Moving layers
Now, you’ll move the screen artwork to the Screen layer, to which you’ll later add 
content from another Illustrator file. You’ll also move the artwork for the television 
body to the TV body layer.
1 In the artwork, using the Selection tool ( ), 
click the white, rounded corner shape where 
the screen content will be, to select it.
In the Layers panel, the Side panel layer shows 
a selected-art indicator (
) to the far right of 
the layer name.
 Tip:  You can also 
select the <Path> row 
in the Layers panel 
and choose Duplicate 
<Path> from the Layers 
panel menu.

LESSON 8  Working with Layers
2 Drag the selected-art indicator (
) from 
the right of the Side panel layer name 
straight up to the right of the target 
icon (
) on the Screen layer.
This action moves the selected object 
(<Path>) to the Screen layer. The color 
of the bounding box and of the anchor 
points in the artwork changes to the color 
of the Screen layer, which is green.
3 Choose Select > Deselect.
4 Click the selection column to the right 
of the bottom <Path> object in the 
Side panel layer to see which content is 
selected on the artboard. A blue selected-
art indicator (
) will appear in the 
selection column, as shown.
Clicking the selection column is a way to 
select the artwork on the artboard.
5 Drag that same <Path> sublayer up onto the TV body layer.
The <Path> object appears on top of most of the other content in the artwork.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  253
6 Click the bottom <Path> sublayer on the 
Side panel layer to select it. Shift-click the 
<Path> sublayer above it to select both 
sublayers. Drag either selected <Path> 
sublayer up onto the TV body layer name.
The Side panel content (the knobs) has 
disappeared. That is because the TV body 
layer content is higher in the Layers panel 
and, therefore, higher in the stacking order (on top of the Side panel 
layer content).
7 Click the triangle to the left of the Side panel layer to hide the layer contents, 
and then choose Select > Deselect.
8 Click and drag the Side panel layer up between the Screen and TV body layers 
in the Layers panel. When a line appears between the layers, release the 
mouse button.

9 Choose File > Save.
Locking layers
As you edit your artwork, you can lock layers to prevent selecting or changing the 
rest of the artwork. In this section, you will learn how to lock all content on a layer 
or sublayer. Now, you’ll lock all of the layers except the knobs sublayer so that you 
can easily edit the knobs without affecting objects on other layers.
1 Select the edit column to the right of the 
eye icon (
) on the Screen layer to lock 
the layer.
The lock icon ( ) indicates that a layer 
and all its content are locked.
2 Repeat the previous step for the 
TV body layer.
	Note:  Be careful 
not to drag the layer 
into one of the other 
layers. If the Side panel 
layer disappears, you 
can choose Edit > Undo 
Reorder Layers and  
try again.

254 
LESSON 8  Working with Layers
3 Click the triangle to the left of the Side 
panel layer to show the layer contents. 
Select the edit column to the right of the 
eye icon on the <Path> sublayer below the 
knobs sublayer.
You can unlock individual layers by 
deselecting the lock icon ( ).
 Tip:  You can also double-click the layer thumbnail 
or double-click just to the right of the layer name to open the Layer Options dialog box. You can 
then select Lock and click OK.
Now, you’ll change the size of the smaller knobs.
4 With the Selection tool ( ) selected, 
drag a marquee across the two small 
knobs in the upper-right corner of 
the television.
By locking all other content, you 
cannot select it on the artboard. 
Locking layers can be a great way to 
more easily select your content.
5 Choose Object > Transform > Scale. In the 
Scale dialog box, change the Uniform Scale 
to 110% and then click OK.
6 In the Layers panel, deselect the lock 
icons ( ) next to the <Path>, Screen, and 
TV body layers to unlock them. Click the 
triangle to the left of the Side panel layer to 
collapse it.
7 Choose Select > Deselect.
8 Choose File > Save.
Viewing layers
The Layers panel lets you hide layers, sublayers, or individual objects from view. 
When a layer is hidden, the content on the layer is also locked and cannot be 
selected or printed. You can also use the Layers panel to display layers or objects 
individually, in either Preview or Outline mode. Now, you’ll change the fill color of 
part of the television body.
1 In the Layers panel, click the TV body layer to select it and then Alt-click 
(Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) the eye icon (
) to the left of the TV 
body layer name to hide the other layers.
 Tip:  Clicking again in 
the edit column relocks 
the layer. Pressing the 
Alt (Windows) or Option 
(Mac OS) key as you 
click in the edit column 
alternately locks and 
unlocks all other layers.
 Tip:  You can Alt 
(Windows) or Option 
(Mac OS) click the layer 
eye icon to hide or 
show a layer. Hiding 
layers prevents them 
from being changed.

2 Click the triangle to the left of the TV body layer name to show the contents of 
the layer.
3 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the eye icon (
) to the left 
of the TV body layer name to view the artwork for that layer in Outline mode.
This action lets you see that there are three shapes. Displaying a layer in Outline 
mode is also useful for selecting the anchor points or center points on objects.
Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the eye icon to enter Outline mode.
4 Using the Selection tool ( ), on the 
artboard, click the rectangle just inside 
the television shape to select it. See the 
figure for selection help.
5 With the rectangle selected, click Fill color 
in the Control panel and then select the 
Wood Grain swatch in the Swatches panel 
that appears in the tool tip, to paint the 
rectangle with a gradient.
 Tip:  To view layer 
artwork in Outline 
mode, you can also 
double-click either the 
layer thumbnail or just 
to the right of the layer 
name to open the Layer 
Options dialog box. 
You can then deselect 
Preview and click OK.

256 
LESSON 8  Working with Layers
6 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click 
(Mac OS) the eye icon (
) to the left of the 
TV body layer name to view the artwork for 
that layer in Preview mode.
In the Layers panel, notice the selected-art 
indicator (
) to the right of the bottom 
<Path> sublayer. Also note that you cannot 
see the shape on the artboard, since it is on 
the bottom of the layer stack, behind the 
other two <Path> objects.
7 Choose Object > Arrange > Bring Forward.
You can now see the selected shape and its 
gradient fill on the artboard. By choosing 
an Arrange command, you are moving the 
content in the layer stack in the Layers panel, 
much as you did earlier in the lesson by 
dragging the sublayers in the Layers panel.
8 Select the Gradient tool (
) in the Tools 
panel. Make sure that the Fill box is 
selected at the bottom of the Tools panel. 
Position the pointer over the bottom, 
middle of the selected rectangle. Press 
and hold the Shift key, click the pointer, 
and drag in a line straight up to the top 
of the rectangle to change the direction 
of the gradient. Release the mouse button 
and then the modifier key.

Pasting layers
To complete the television, you’ll copy and paste the remaining pieces of artwork 
from another file. You can paste a layered file into another file and keep the 
layers intact.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
2 Choose File > Open, and open the show.ai file, 
located in the Lesson08 folder in the Lessons 
folder on your hard disk.
3 To see how the objects in each layer are 
organized, Alt-click (Windows) or Option-
click (Mac OS) the eye icon (
) for each layer 
in the Layers panel to show one layer and hide 
the others. You can also click the triangles 
( ) to the left of the layer names to expand 
and collapse the layers for further inspection. 
When you’re finished, make sure that all the 
layers are showing and that they are collapsed.
4 Choose Select > All and then Edit > Copy to select and copy the game show 
content to the clipboard.
5 Choose File > Close to close the show.ai file without saving any changes. If a 
warning dialog box appears, click No (Windows) or Don’t Save (Mac OS).
6 In the tv.ai file, choose Paste Remembers Layers from the Layers panel 
menu (
). A check mark next to the option indicates that it’s selected.
When Paste Remembers Layers is selected, artwork is pasted into the layer(s) 
from which it was copied, regardless of which layer is active in the Layers panel. 
If the option is not selected, all objects are pasted into the active layer and the 
layers from the original file are not pasted in.
7 Choose Edit > Paste to paste the game 
show content onto the television.
The Paste Remembers Layers option 
causes the show.ai layers to be pasted 
as four separate layers at the top of the 
Layers panel (Shadow/highlight, Text, 
Game board, and Background).
 Note:  If the target 
document has a layer 
of the same name, 
Illustrator combines the 
pasted content into a 
layer of the same name.

LESSON 8  Working with Layers
8 With the Selection tool, drag the new 
content on top of the gray, rounded 
rectangle to center it as best as you can. 
See the figure for placement help.
Now, you’ll move the newly pasted layers into 
the Screen layer.
9 In the Layers panel, select the Shadow/
highlight layer (if not already selected) 
and Shift-click the Background layer name. Drag any of the four selected layers 
down on top of the Screen layer. The artwork should not change in appearance.
Drag the selected layers.	
The result.
The four pasted layers become sublayers of the Screen layer. Notice that they 
keep their individual layer colors.
10 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.
Creating a clipping mask
The Layers panel lets you create clipping masks to control whether artwork on a 
layer (or in a group) is hidden or revealed. A clipping mask is an object or group of 
objects which masks (with its shape) artwork below it, in the same layer or sublayer, 
so that only artwork within the shape is visible.
Now, you’ll create a clipping mask with the white, rounded rectangle shape at the 
top of the Screen layer. 
1 Drag the bottom of the Layers panel down to reveal all of the layers.
In the Layers panel, a masking object must be above the objects it masks. You 
can create a clipping mask for an entire layer, a sublayer, or a group of objects. 
Because you want to mask all of the content in the Screen layer, the clipping 
object needs to be at the top of the Screen layer, which is what you did in the 
previous section.

2 Click the <Path> sublayer at the bottom of 
the Screen layer. Drag the selected <Path> 
sublayer up onto the Screen layer name. 
When the layer is highlighted, release the 
mouse button to position the <Path> on the 
top of the layer. The white, rounded 
rectangle will now be on top of the other 
artwork on the Screen layer.

The name of the <Path> sublayer is underlined to indicate that it is the masking 
shape. On the artboard, the <Path> sublayer has hidden the parts of the screen 
content that extended outside of the shape.
4 Choose File > Save.
Merging layers
To streamline your artwork, you can merge layers, sublayers, or groups. Merging 
layers, sublayers, or groups combines the contents into one layer, sublayer, or 
group. Note that items will be merged into the layer or group that you selected last.
1 Click the Text sublayer in the Layers panel to 
highlight it, and then Shift-click to highlight 
the Background sublayer.
Notice that the current layer indicator ( ) 
shows the last highlighted layer as the active 
layer. The last layer you select determines the 
name and color of the merged layer.
 Note:  Deselecting 
the artwork on 
the artboard is not 
necessary to complete 
the next steps, but 
it can be helpful for 
viewing the artwork.
 Tip:  To release the 
clipping mask, you can 
select the Screen layer 
again and click the 
same Make/Release 
Clipping Mask button.

260 
LESSON 8  Working with Layers
	Note:  Layers can only merge with other layers that are on the same hierarchical level in the 
Layers panel. Likewise, sublayers can only merge with other sublayers that are in the same layer and 
at the same hierarchical level. Objects can’t be merged with other objects.
2 Choose Merge Selected from the Layers panel 
menu (
) to merge the content from the 
three sublayers into the Background sublayer.
The objects on the merged layers retain their 
original stacking order and are added above 
the objects in the destination layer.
3 Double-click the thumbnail to the 
left of the Background layer name, or 
double-click directly to the right of the 
Background layer name. In the Layer 
Options dialog box, choose Green from 
the Color menu to match the Screen 
layer color. Click OK.
Changing the layer color to match the 
main layer isn’t necessary. The Layer 
Options dialog box has a lot of the options you’ve already worked with, 
including naming layers, Preview or Outline mode, locking layers, and showing 
and hiding layers. You can also deselect the Print option in the Layer Options 
dialog box and any content on that layer will not print.
4 Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac 
OS) the eye icon (
) to the left of the Screen 
layer to hide the other layers. Click the blank 
visibility column to the left of the Shadow/
highlight sublayer to show its content on 
the artboard.
5 Choose Select > All On Active Artboard.
6 Make sure that Align To Selection is chosen 
in the Control panel, and then click the Horizontal Align Center button ( ) and 
the Vertical Align Center button (
) in the Control panel to align the content 
to each other.
7 In the Layers panel, choose Show All 
Layers from the panel menu (
), and 
then choose Select > Deselect.
8 Choose File > Save.
 Note:  The Align 
options may not appear 
in the Control panel 
but are indicated by 
the word “Align.” The 
number of options 
displayed in the Control 
panel depends on your 
screen resolution.

Locating layers
When working in artwork, there may be times when you select content on the 
artboard and then want to locate that same content in the Layers panel. This can 
help you to determine how content is organized.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), in the artwork, 
click to select one of the small knobs.
In the Layers panel, you will see the 
selection indicator to the far right of the 
Side panel layer and knobs sublayer name.
2 Click the Locate Object button (
) at the 
bottom of the Layers panel to reveal the object 
within the knobs sublayer.
Clicking the Locate Object button will open 
the layer so that the layer content can be seen, 
and the Layers panel will scroll, if necessary, 
to reveal the selected content. With an 
Illustrator file that has a lot of layered content, 
this can be helpful.
3 Choose Select > Deselect.
4 Click the triangle to the left of the Screen and 
Side panel layer names to hide the contents of each layer.
Applying appearance attributes to layers
You can apply appearance attributes, such as styles, effects, and transparency, to 
layers, groups, and objects, using the Layers panel. When an appearance attribute is 
applied to a layer, any object on that layer takes on that attribute. If an appearance 
attribute is applied only to a specific object on a layer, it affects only that object, not 
the entire layer.
	Note:  To learn more about working with appearance attributes, see Lesson 13, “Applying 
Appearance Attributes and Graphic Styles.”
You will apply an effect to an object on one layer. Then, you’ll copy that effect to 
another layer to change all objects on that layer.
1 Click the triangle to the left of the TV body layer name to show the contents of 
the layer.

262 
LESSON 8  Working with Layers
2 Click the target icon (
) to the right of the 
bottom <Path> object in the target column.
Clicking the target icon indicates that you 
want to apply an effect, style, or transparency 
change to that layer, sublayer, group, or 
object. In other words, the layer, sublayer, 
group, or object is targeted. The content is 
also selected in the Document window. When 
the target button appears as a double ring 
icon (either 
 or 
), the item is targeted; a 
single ring icon indicates that the item is not 
targeted.
3 Choose Effect > Stylize > Drop Shadow. In the Drop Shadow dialog box, change 
the Opacity to 50%, the X Offset to 0, the Y Offset to 0.1 in, and the Blur to 0.1 
in, if necessary. Click OK. A drop shadow appears on the edge of the 
television shape.

 Note:  There are two Stylize commands in the Effect menu. Choose the top Stylize menu 
command, which is in the Illustrator Effects.
Notice that, on the <Path> sublayer, the target icon (
) is now shaded, 
indicating that the object has appearance attributes applied to it.
4 Click the Appearance panel icon (
) on the 
right side of the workspace to reveal the 
Appearance panel. If the Appearance panel 
isn’t visible, choose Window > Appearance. 
Notice that Drop Shadow has been added 
to the list of appearance attributes for the 
selected object.
5 Choose Select > Deselect.
You will now use the Layers panel to copy an appearance attribute into a layer and 
then edit it.
 Note:  Clicking 
the target icon also 
selects the object(s) on 
the artboard. You could 
also simply select the 
content on the artboard 
to apply an effect.

down to display the entire list.
7 Press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac 
OS) key, and drag the shaded target icon of 
the bottom <Path> sublayer in the TV body 
layer to the target icon of the knobs sublayer, 
without releasing the mouse button. When 
the target icon of the knobs sublayer turns 
light gray, release the mouse button and then 
the modifier key.
The drop shadow is now applied to the knobs 
sublayer and all content in that sublayer, as 
indicated by the shaded target icon.
Now, you’ll edit the drop shadow effect for the 
knobs to make the shadow more prominent.
8 In the Layers panel, click the target icon (
) 
to the right of the knobs sublayer name.
This automatically selects the objects on the 
sublayer and deselects the object on the TV 
body layer.
9 Click the Appearance panel icon (
) on the 
right side of the workspace to reveal the 
Appearance panel. In the Appearance panel, 
click the words “Drop Shadow,” scrolling 
down to find it in the list, if necessary.
10 In the Drop Shadow dialog box, change 
the Opacity to 80%, and then click OK.
This will make a subtle gradient change to 
the knobs.
11 Choose Select > Deselect.
12 Choose File > Save.
 Note:  You can drag 
and copy the shaded 
target icon to any 
layer, sublayer, group, 
or object to apply the 
properties found in the 
Appearance panel.

LESSON 8  Working with Layers
Isolating layers
When a layer is in Isolation mode, objects on that layer are isolated so that you can 
easily edit them without affecting other layers. Next, you will enter Isolation mode 
for a layer and make a simple edit.
1 Expand the Layers panel by clicking the Layers panel icon, if it’s not 
already showing.
2 Click the triangles to the left of the layers in the Layers panel to close them all.
3 Click to select the Side panel layer.
4 Choose Enter Isolation Mode from the 
Layers panel menu (

In Isolation mode, the contents of the 
Side panel layer appear on top of all 
the objects on the artboard. The rest of 
the content on the artboard is dimmed 
and locked, much like when you enter 
Isolation mode for a group. The Layers 
panel now shows a layer called Isolation 
Mode and a sublayer that contains the Side panel content.
5 Select the Selection tool ( ), and Shift-click the two small knobs at the top of 
the side panel to select them.
6 Press the Down Arrow key twice to move 
the knobs down.
7 Press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode.
Notice that the content is no longer 
locked and the Layers panel reveals all the 
layers and sublayers again.
8 Choose Select > Deselect.
Now that the artwork is complete, you may 
want to combine all the layers into a single layer and then delete the empty layers. 
This is called flattening artwork. Delivering finished artwork in a single–layer file 
can prevent accidents, such as hiding layers and omitting parts of the artwork 
during printing. To flatten specific layers without deleting hidden layers, you can 
select the layers you want to flatten and then choose Merge Selected from the 
Layers panel menu.
For a complete list of shortcuts that you can use with the Layers panel, see 
“Keyboard shortcuts” in Illustrator Help.

Review answers
1 The benefits of using layers when creating artwork include: protecting artwork that 
you don’t want to change, hiding artwork that you aren’t working with so that it’s not 
distracting, and controlling what prints.
2 To hide a layer, click to deselect the eye icon to the left of the layer name in the Layers 
panel. Select the blank, leftmost column (the Visibility column) to show a layer.
3 You reorder layers by selecting a layer name in the Layers panel and dragging the layer 
to its new location. The order of layers in the Layers panel controls the document’s 
layer order—topmost in the panel is front-most in the artwork.
4 The selection color controls how selected anchor points and direction lines are 
displayed on a layer and helps you identify the different layers in your document.
5 The paste commands paste layered files or objects copied from different layers into the 
active layer, by default. The Paste Remembers Layers option keeps the original layers 
intact when the objects are pasted.
6 Create a clipping mask on a layer by selecting the layer and clicking the Make/Release 
Clipping Mask button in the Layers panel. The topmost object in the layer becomes the 
clipping mask.
7 Click the target icon for the layer to which you want to apply an effect. Then choose 
an effect from the Effect menu. To edit the effect, make sure that the layer is selected 
and then click the name of the effect in the Appearance panel. The effect’s dialog box 
opens, and you can change the values.

In Adobe Illustrator CS6, you can easily draw or render 
artwork in perspective, using the Perspective Grid. 
The Perspective Grid allows you to approximately 
represent a scene on a flat surface, as it is naturally 
perceived by the human eye. For example, you can 
render a road or a pair of railway tracks, which seem 
to meet or vanish in the line of vision.

268 
LESSON 9  Working with Perspective Drawing
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll explore working with the Perspective Grid, adding content to 
it, and editing on the Perspective Grid.
Before you begin, you’ll restore the default preferences for Adobe Illustrator. Then, 
you’ll open the finished art file for this lesson to see what you’ll create.
1 To ensure that the tools and panels function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CS6 preferences file. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 3.
2 Start Adobe Illustrator CS6.
	Note:  If you have not already done so, copy the Lesson09 folder from the Lessons folder on the 
Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book CD onto your hard disk. See “Copying the Classroom in a 
Book files” on page 2.
3 Choose File > Open, and open the L9end.ai file 
in the Lesson09 folder, located in the Lessons 
folder on your hard disk.
4 Choose View > Zoom Out to make the finished 
artwork smaller, if you want to leave it on your 
screen as you work. (Use the Hand tool [
] 
to move the artwork where you want it in the window.) Leave the file open for 
reference, or choose File > Close.
5 Choose File > Open. Navigate to the Lesson09 
folder, located in the Lessons folder on your 
hard disk. Open the L9start.ai file.
6 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog 
box, navigate to the Lesson09 folder and name 
the file city.ai. Leave the Save As Type option 
set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows) or the Format option set to Adobe 
Illustrator (ai) (Mac OS), and then click Save. In the Illustrator Options dialog 
box, leave the Illustrator options at their default settings and then click OK.
Understanding perspective
In Illustrator CS6, you can easily draw or render 
artwork in perspective, using a feature set that 
works based on established laws of perspective 
drawing. Perspective in drawing is an approximate 
representation, on a flat surface, of an image as it 
is seen by the eye. 
	Note:  In Mac OS, 
when opening lesson 
files, you may need to 
click the round, green 
button in the upper-left 
corner of the Document 
window to maximize 
the window’s size.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  269
Objects drawn in perspective are characterized primarily by the following:
• They are drawn smaller as their distance from the observer increases.
• The perspective objects are foreshortened, which means that an object or 
distance appears shorter than it actually is, because it is angled toward
the viewer.
Understanding the Perspective Grid
The Perspective Grid allows you to approximately represent a scene on a flat 
surface, as it is naturally perceived by the human eye. For example, you can render 
a road or a pair of railway tracks, which seem to meet or vanish in the line of vision. 
The Perspective Grid allows you to create and render artwork in perspective.
1 Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar.
2 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
3 Select the Perspective Grid tool (
) in the Tools panel. 
The default two-point Perspective Grid appears on the artboard.
The figure below shows the Perspective Grid and its parts. As you go through 
this lesson, you will learn about each part. It may be helpful to refer back to the 
Perspective Grid options shown in this figure as you progress through the lesson.

LESSON 9  Working with Perspective Drawing
Working with the Perspective Grid
In order to begin working with content in perspective, it is helpful to see and set up 
the Perspective Grid the way you want.
Using a preset grid
To begin the lesson, you’ll work with the Perspective Grid, starting with some 
Illustrator presets.
You use the Perspective Grid to draw and snap content in perspective, although 
the grid is non-printing. The Perspective Grid, by default, is set up as a two-point 
perspective, and you can easily change that using presets. A grid in Illustrator can 
have up to three points of perspective.
1 Choose View > Perspective Grid > One Point 
Perspective > [1P-Normal View]. Notice that the 
grid changes to a one-point perspective.
A one-point perspective can be very useful 
for drawing roads, railway tracks, or buildings 
viewed so that the front is directly facing 
the viewer.
2 Choose View > Perspective Grid > Three Point 
Perspective > [3P-Normal View]. Notice that the 
grid changes to a three-point perspective.
Three-point perspective is usually used for 
buildings seen from above or below. In addition 
to showing vanishing points for each wall, there 
is now a point showing those walls receding into 
the ground or high in space.
3 To return the grid back to a two-point 
perspective, choose View > Perspective Grid > 
Two Point Perspective > [2P-Normal View].
Editing the Perspective Grid
Next, you’ll learn how to edit the Perspective Grid. To edit the grid, you can either 
select the Perspective Grid tool or edit using the Define Grid command. You can 
make changes to the grid if you have content on the grid, although it may be easier 
to establish the grid settings before you add content. You can create only one grid 
per Illustrator document.
 Tip:  You can show 
the Perspective Grid 
without selecting the 
Perspective Grid tool, 
by choosing View > 
Perspective Grid > 
Show Grid.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  271
1 With the Perspective Grid tool (
) 
selected, drag the horizon line point 
down below the bottom of the blue sky 
to move the horizon down, as shown 
in the figure. The measurement label 
should show approximately 147 pt.
The location of the horizon line 
indicates the observer’s eye level.
2 With the Perspective Grid tool, drag 
the left ground level point up, to move 
the whole Perspective Grid. Drag 
until the horizon line you adjusted in 
the previous step is lined up with the 
bottom of the blue sky.
The ground level point allows you to 
drag the Perspective Grid to different 
parts of the artboard or to a different artboard altogether.
	Note:  As you drag the Perspective Grid by the ground level point, notice that you can move it in 
any direction. Make sure that it is still more or less centered horizontally on the artboard.
3 With the Perspective Grid tool, drag 
the horizontal grid plane control point 
up about 68 pt so that it’s closer to the 
horizon line.
 Tip:  The location of the ground level in relation 
to the horizon line will determine how far above or 
below eye level the object will be viewed.
4 With the Perspective Grid tool, click 
and drag the Vertical Grid Extent point 
(the top point in the grid) down to 
shorten the vertical extent.
Making the vertical extent shorter can 
be a way to minimize the grid if you are 
drawing objects that are less precise, as 
you will see later in the lesson.
5 Choose File > Save. Changes you make to the Perspective Grid are saved with 
this document only.
Setting the grid up for your drawing is an important step. Next, you will access 
these changes using the Define Grid menu.
	Note:  Throughout 
this section, a red X in 
the figures shows where 
to drag from.
	Note:  The gray 
lines in some of these 
figures indicate the 
initial position of the 
Perspective Grid, before 
it was adjusted.

272 
LESSON 9  Working with Perspective Drawing
6 Choose View > Perspective Grid > Define Grid.
7 In the Define Perspective Grid dialog 
box, change the Units to Inches, 
change the Gridline Every value to .3 in 
and change the Viewing Distance 
to 7 in. 
The Viewing Distance is the distance 
between the observer and the scene. 
Notice that you can change the Scale of 
the grid, which you might want to do if 
real-world measurements are involved. 
You can edit settings, like Horizon 
Height and Viewing Angle, which you 
can also edit on the artboard, using 
the Perspective Grid tool. Leave the 
Grid Color & Opacity settings at their 
defaults. When you have finished 
making changes, click OK.
8 With the Perspective Grid tool, drag 
the left vanishing point about –.75 in to 
the left, until it reaches the left horizon 
line point. Notice that this changes 
only the left (blue) grid on the two-
point Perspective Grid.
9 Choose Edit > Undo Perspective 
Grid Edit.
You are able to undo most changes made to the Perspective Grid.
10 Choose View > Perspective Grid > Lock Station Point. This locks the left and 
right vanishing points so that they move together.
11 With the Perspective Grid tool, drag the left vanishing point about –.75 in to 
the left again, until it reaches the left horizon line point. Notice that this now 
changes both grids on the two-point Perspective Grid.
12 Choose File > Save.
 Tip:  To learn more 
about the Define 
Perspective Grid 
dialog box, search for 
“Define grid presets” in 
Illustrator Help.
 Tip:  After setting 
the Define Perspective 
Grid settings, you can 
save them as a preset 
to access later. In the 
Define Perspective Grid 
dialog box, change the 
settings and then click 
the Save Preset button.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  273
13 Choose View > Perspective Grid > Lock Grid.
This command restricts the grid movement and other grid editing features of 
the Perspective Grid tool. You can only change the visibility and the grid plane 
position, which you will work with later in this lesson.
	Note:  When you select a tool other than the Perspective Grid tool, you cannot edit the 
Perspective Grid. Also, if the Perspective Grid is locked, you can edit it by choosing View > 
Perspective Grid > Define Grid.
Now that the grid is locked into the correct position, you will begin creating your 
cityscape by adding content to it.
Drawing objects in perspective
To draw objects in perspective, use the line group tools or rectangle group tools 
(except for the Flare tool) while the grid is visible. Before you begin drawing using 
any of these tools, you need to select a grid plane to attach the content to, using the 
Plane Switching Widget or keyboard shortcuts.
The Plane Switching Widget
When you select the Perspective Grid, a Plane Switching 
Widget also appears in the upper-left corner of the 
Document window, by default. You can use this widget 
to select the active grid plane.
In the Perspective Grid, an active plane is the plane on 
which you draw an object to project the observer’s view 
of that portion of the scene.
You can change the position of the widget and other  
options by double-clicking the Perspective Grid tool in  
the Tools panel.
—From Illustrator Help
1 Click the Layers panel icon (
) to expand the Layers panel. Click the eye 
icon (
) to the left of the Background layer to hide its contents on the artboard. 
Click to select the layer named Left face so that the new content you create is on 
that layer. Click the Layers panel icon to collapse the panel.
2 Select the Rectangle tool (
) in the Tools panel.
3 Select the Left Grid in the Plane Switching Widget.
Whichever grid plane is selected in the widget is the grid 
plane on the Perspective Grid to which you’ll add content.
 Tip:  The numbers 
in parentheses (Left 
Grid(1), for instance) 
refer to the keyboard 
shortcut assigned to 
that grid plane.
	Note:  With practice, 
you’ll develop the 
habit of checking which 
grid plane is active 
before drawing or 
adding content.

LESSON 9  Working with Perspective Drawing
4 Position the pointer over the top of the Perspective Grid, where the two 
planes meet. Notice that the cursor (
) has an arrow pointing to the left, 
indicating that you are about to draw on the left grid plane. Drag down and to 
the left, to the bottom orthogonal line, as shown in the figure, so that the gray 
measurement label shows an approximate width of 3.6 in. Note that it’s okay if 
your measurements are a little different from those shown.
When drawing on the grid plane, objects snap to the grid lines, by default.
5 With the rectangle selected, change the Fill color in the Control panel to a 
medium gray (C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=40 will appear in the swatch tool tip).
Start drawing.	
Create the rectangle.	
Change the Fill color.
Next, you will draw another rectangle to create the other side of a building.
 Tip:  You can turn off grid snapping by choosing View > Perspective Grid > Snap To Grid.
6 Press Ctrl++ (Windows) or Command++ (Mac OS) twice to zoom in to the 
Perspective Grid. Snapping to the grid doesn’t work if you are zoomed out
too far.
7 Click the Layers panel icon (
) to expand the Layers panel. Click to select the 
layer named Right face so that the new content you create is on that layer.
8 With the Rectangle tool still 
selected, click Right Grid(3) in the 
Plane Switching Widget to draw in 
perspective on the right grid plane. 
Notice that the cursor (
) now has an 
arrow pointing to the right, indicating 
that you are about to draw on the right 
grid plane. Position the pointer at the 
same top point as for the last rectangle 
you drew, and drag down and to the 
right. When the measurement label 
shows a width of approximately 3.3 in and the pointer reaches the bottom of the 
right grid plane, release the mouse button.
	Note:  You may want 
to zoom in for the  
next steps.
	Note:  Depending 
on the zoom level, your 
grid may not match the 
figures exactly and  
that’s okay.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  275
9 With the rectangle selected, change the Fill color in the Control panel to a light 
gray (C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=10). Press the Escape key to hide the Swatches panel.
10 Click the X in the upper-left corner of the Plane Switching Widget to hide the 
Perspective Grid and to see your artwork.
11 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
Next, you will draw a rectangle that will serve as a window for the building. But 
first, you must show the grid again to continue drawing in perspective.
12 Press Shift+Ctrl+I (Windows) or Shift+Command+I (Mac OS) to show the grid.
 Tip:  You can also show the Perspective Grid by selecting the Perspective Grid tool or by 
choosing View > Perspective Grid > Show Grid.
13 Select the Rounded Rectangle tool (
) by holding 
down the mouse button on the Rectangle tool 
(
) in the Tools panel. Position the pointer over 
the center of the rectangle you just created. Click 
once to open the Rounded Rectangle dialog box. 
Change the Width to 1.5 in and the Height to 
.9 in. Change the Corner Radius to .1 in, and then 
click OK. This will be a window in the building.
14 Press Ctrl++ (Windows) or Command++ (Mac OS) three times to zoom in.
15 Select the Selection tool ( ), and drag the rectangle down and to the left to 
position it at the bottom, left of the light gray rectangle.
If you use the Selection tool to drag an object that was drawn in perspective, 
it maintains its original perspective but it doesn’t change to match the 
Perspective Grid.
16 Choose Edit > Undo Move to return the rectangle to its original position.
Selecting and transforming objects in perspective
You can select objects in perspective using the Perspective Selection tool. The 
Perspective Selection tool uses the active plane settings to select the objects.
Next, you will move and resize the rectangle you just drew.
1 Select the Perspective Selection 
tool (
) by holding down the mouse 
button on the Perspective Grid tool 
in the Tools panel. Drag the rounded 
rectangle down and to the left, to the 
lower-left corner of the light gray 
rectangle. See the figure for placement 
help. Notice that it snaps to the grid as 
you drag it.
 Tip:  You can 
also choose View > 
Perspective Grid > Hide 
Grid to hide the grid.
 Tip:  When drawing 
in perspective, you 
can still use the usual 
keyboard shortcuts for 
drawing objects, such 
as Shift-drag.

276 
LESSON 9  Working with Perspective Drawing
2 With the rectangle still selected, change the Fill color in the Control panel to the 
window gradient. Press the Escape key to hide the Swatches panel.
3 With the Perspective Selection tool still selected, click the darker 
gray rectangle on the left grid plane to select it. Notice that the left 
grid plane is now selected in the Plane Switching Widget.
4 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and drag a marquee across the 
lower-left corner of the darker gray rectangle on the left grid plane.
5 Select the Perspective Selection tool (
), and then drag the lower-left corner 
up and to the left, following the bottom grid plane line that leads to the left 
vanishing point. See the figure below for help. When the measurement label 
shows a width of about 4.5 in, release the mouse button.
	Note:  The size does not have to match exactly, as long as the shape is snapped to the 
Perspective Grid. The width of your rectangles may be different than what you see in the figure, and 
that’s okay.
Scale objects in perspective
You can scale objects in perspective using the Perspective Selection tool. While 
scaling objects in perspective, the following rules apply:
• 
Scaling is done in the object’s plane. When you scale an object, the height or 
distance is scaled based on the object’s plane and not on the current or 
active plane.
• 
For multiple objects, scaling is done for objects that are on the same plane. 
For example, if you select multiple objects on the right and left planes, all the 
objects that are on the same plane as the object with the bounding box that is 
used for scaling are scaled.
• 
Objects that have been moved perpendicularly are scaled on their respective 
plane and not on the current or active plane.
—From Illustrator Help
Next, you will duplicate an object in perspective, as well as move an object 
perpendicular to an existing object.
 Tip:  You can open 
the Transform panel 
(Window > Transform) 
and make the height of 
both rectangles 
the same.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  277
6 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
7 With the Perspective Selection tool, 
click to select the light gray rectangle 
on the right grid plan. Holding down 
Alt+Shift (Windows) or Option+Shift 
(Mac OS), drag the selected rectangle 
to the right on the right grid plane. 
When the measurement label shows a 
distance (dX) of approximately 4.75 in, 
release the mouse button and then the 
modifier keys.
You will use this copy as the face of another building. As with other types 
of drawings, the Alt or Option key duplicates the object and the Shift key 
constrains the movement.
With the rectangle copy in place and in perspective, you will now adjust the 
Perspective Grid so that the grid pattern covers the new shape. You’ll do this by 
editing the grid extent.
8 Select the Perspective Grid tool (
) in the Tools panel.
9 Press Ctrl++ (Windows) or Command++ (Mac OS) twice to zoom in.
Notice that the grid pattern in the Perspective Grid starts to expand to the right 
and left the closer you zoom in.
10 Choose View > Perspective Grid > Unlock Grid, which enables you to edit the grid.
11 With the Perspective Grid tool, position the pointer over the right grid extent 
widget, indicated by the red X in the figure below, and drag to the left until it 
reaches the right edge of the copied rectangle.
12 Drag the grid cell widget (circled in the figure) down a bit, until the grid cell size 
becomes smaller.
Notice that if you drag too far down, the left and right extents of the grid moves away 
from their accompanying vanishing points. Dragging up would increase the size of 
the grid cells. Your grid cell size may not match the figure exactly, and that’s okay.
Drag the grid extent widget.	
Edit the grid cell size.
	Note:  Gridlines 
are set to display 
on-screen when there 
is a 1-pixel gap in them. 
Progressive zooming 
in will bring into view 
more gridlines that 
are closer to the 
vanishing point. Your 
grid does not have 
to match the figures 
exactly, going forward.

278 
LESSON 9  Working with Perspective Drawing
13 Choose View > Perspective Grid > Define Grid, and in the Define Perspective 
Grid dialog box, change the Gridline Every value to .25 in. Click OK. This is the 
same as dragging the grid cell widget on the grid.
14 Select the Selection tool ( ), and click to select the darker gray rectangle on the 
left grid plane. Change the Fill color in the Control panel to the building face 1 
color. Click to select the lighter gray rectangle you created (the other face of the 
same building), and change the Fill color in the Control panel to building face 2.
15 Choose File > Save.
Now that the copied rectangle is in place and the grid cells display correctly, you 
will copy the rectangle on the left grid plane so that it becomes the left face of the 
newly copied rectangle. Next, you will see how to move an object parallel to its 
current location.
1 Select the Perspective Selection tool 
(
) in the Tools panel. Click to select 
the red-colored rectangle on the left 
grid plane. Holding down the number 5 
key, drag the rectangle to the left a bit. 
Release the mouse and then the 5 key.
This action moves the object in parallel 
to its current location.
2 Choose Edit > Undo Perspective Move.
3 With the Perspective Selection tool 
selected, hold down the Alt (Windows) 
or Option (Mac OS) key and the 
number 5 key and drag the same 
rectangle to the right. Drag to position 
it as the left face of the second building. 
When in position, release the mouse 
and then the modifier keys.
This duplicates the object and places it 
at the new location without changing 
the original object.
4 With the new copy still selected, choose 
Object > Arrange > Send To Back. Change the Fill color of the new object in the 
Control panel to a medium gray (C=0 M=0 Y=0 K=50 will appear in the tool tip).
Next, you will make a copy of the rounded rectangle “window” and then move it 
to the left grid plane of the red building by pressing a keyboard shortcut to switch 
planes while dragging.
 Tip:  If you were to 
select the Draw Behind 
mode, this step would 
copy the rectangle and 
place it behind all  
other objects.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  279
5 With the Perspective Selection tool selected, select the blue window on the right 
face of the building. Choose Edit > Copy and then Edit > Paste In Front.
6 With the Perspective Selection tool, drag the copy of the rounded rectangle 
window to the left. As you drag, press and then release the number 1 key to 
switch the window to the left grid plane. Drag the window to the lower-left 
corner of the red rectangle on the left (which is the left side of the red building).
7 Choose Edit > Cut.
8 Click the Layers panel icon (
) to expand the Layers panel. In the Layers panel, 
make sure that the Left face layer is selected. Click the Layers panel icon to 
collapse the panel again.
9 Choose Edit > Paste In Front.
	Note:  If the rounded rectangle doesn’t appear on top of all other objects, choose Object > 
Arrange > Bring To Front.
10 With the rounded rectangle still selected, press the Right Arrow key and then 
the Up Arrow key. Notice that pressing the arrow keys snaps a side of the 
rounded rectangle to the Perspective Grid. Using the arrow keys, position the 
window in the lower-left corner of the red rectangle, as shown in the figure.
11 Click to select the original rounded rectangle on the right grid plane so that it is 
the only thing selected. Position it on the same grid lines (relatively) as the copy, 
using the arrow keys to snap it to the grid, as shown in the figure.
12 Press Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or 
Command+Shift+I (Mac OS) to temporarily hide 
the Perspective Grid.
13 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
	Note:  While 
dragging, you may need 
to press the number 1 
key a few times.

LESSON 9  Working with Perspective Drawing
Attaching content to perspective
If you have already created content, Illustrator provides an option to attach the 
objects to an active plane on the Perspective Grid. You will now add an existing 
sign for a coffee shop to one of the sides of a building.
1 Choose View > Perspective Grid > Show Grid to show the grid.
2 Choose View > Fit All In Window to see the two artboards.
3 Select the Selection tool ( ), and click to select the Coffee sign on the artboard 
on the right. Drag the sign close to the right of the gray building you’ve created 
in perspective. After you’ve placed the sign, click once somewhere on a blank 
area of the main artboard with the grid. This makes the artboard with the 
Perspective Grid the active artboard and deselects the sign.
4 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
5 Press Ctrl++ (Windows) or Command++ (Mac OS) twice to zoom in to the 
Perspective Grid and artwork.
Next, you will add the selected sign to the right side of the red building and put it 
into perspective along with the rest of the artwork on the main artboard.
6 Select the Perspective Selection tool (
) in the Tools 
panel. Select the Left Grid(1) in the Plane Switching 
Widget to make sure that the sign will be added to the left 
grid plane.
	Note:  The above step is an important step that can be easily forgotten!
7 With the Perspective Selection tool, 
drag the sign so that the top of the sign 
aligns with the top of the vertical
grid extent.
The artwork is added to the grid that is 
selected in the Plane Switching Widget.
	Note:  The coffee sign is a group of objects. 
You can just as easily attach a single object to the 
Perspective Grid.
8 With the sign still selected, choose Edit > Cut.
9 Click the Layers panel icon (
) on the right side of 
the workspace to expand the Layers panel. Click to 
select the Right face layer. Choose Edit > Paste In 
Place. This pastes the sign on the Right face layer.
10 Click the Layers panel icon to collapse the panel.
 Tip:  You can also 
select the active plane 
by pressing keyboard 
shortcuts: 1=Left Grid, 
2=Horizontal Grid, 
3=Right Grid, and 4=No 
Active Grid.
 Tip:  Instead of 
dragging the object 
onto the plane using 
the Perspective 
Selection tool, you can 
also select the object 
with the Perspective 
Selection tool, choose 
the plane using the 
Plane Switching Widget, 
and then choose  
Object > Perspective > 
Attach To Active Plane.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  281
You will now move the coffee sign perpendicular to its current location, along the 
right side of the building.
11 With the Perspective Selection tool, hold down the number 5 key and drag the 
coffee sign to the right until it reaches the right side of the red rectangle, as 
shown in the figure. Release the mouse button and then the modifier key.
12 With the Perspective 
Selection tool, hold down 
the Shift key and drag the 
bottom, middle point of the 
sign up to make it smaller. 
When the measurement 
label shows a Height of 
about 2.4 or 2.5 in, stop 
dragging. Release the 
mouse button and then 
the Shift key.
	Note:  If your sign is too close or 
too far from the red building after 
resizing, you can drag to position it better, using the Perspective Selection tool.
13 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Editing planes and objects together
You can edit the grid planes either before or after there is artwork on them. You 
can move objects perpendicularly by dragging them, as you’ve seen, or you can 
move a grid plane using grid plane controls to move objects perpendicularly.
Next, you will edit the grid planes and the artwork together.
1 With the Perspective Selection tool (
) still selected, drag the right grid plane 
control to the right until D: 1 in (approximately) appears in the measurement label, 
as shown in the figure. This moves the right grid plane but not the objects on it.
Drag the sign into position.	
Scale the sign.
	Note:  Throughout 
this section, a red X in 
the figures shows where 
to drag from.

282 
LESSON 9  Working with Perspective Drawing
2 Choose Edit > Undo Perspective Grid Edit to return the grid plane to its
original position.
3 With the Perspective Selection tool still selected, hold down the Shift key and 
drag the right grid plane control to the right until the measurement label shows 
about 1 in. Release the mouse button and then the Shift key.
The Shift key moves the grid plane and the artwork on the grid perpendicular to 
their original positions.
 Tip:  Dragging a grid plane control while pressing Shift+Alt (Windows) or Shift+Option (Mac OS) 
drags a copy of the objects with the grid plane.
Dragging a grid plane control is not very precise. For more precision, you can move 
the right grid plane control according to values you enter, which you will do next.
4 Double-click the same right grid 
plane control you just dragged. 
In the Right Vanishing Plane 
dialog box, change the Location 
to .5 in and then select Move All 
Objects. Click OK.
In the Right Vanishing Plane 
dialog box, the Do Not Move 
option allows you to move the 
grid plane and not the objects on it. Copy All Objects allows you to move the 
grid plane and to bring a copy of the objects on the grid plane with it.
The location in the Right Vanishing Plane dialog box starts at the station point, 
which is 0. The station point is indicated by the small green diamond on the 
Perspective Grid, above the horizontal grid control.
Next, you will move the left grid plane using the same method.
 Tip:  If you select an 
object or objects on the 
active grid plane and 
then drag the grid plane 
control while holding 
down the Shift key,  
only the selected 
objects move with the 
grid plane.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  283
5 Double-click the left grid plane control. 
In the Left Vanishing Plane dialog box, 
change the Location to –.4 in and then 
select Move All Objects. Click OK.
Grid planes move to the right when 
you enter a positive value and to the 
left when you enter a negative value.
Now the grid planes and objects are 
where they need to be, except for the coffee sign and the left side of the second, 
gray building, which you will move later. You will now add a rectangle to the red 
building to fill in the gap left when you moved the planes.
6 Click the Layers panel icon (
) on the right side of 
the workspace to expand the Layers panel. Click to 
select the Center face layer.
7 Click the Layers panel icon to collapse the panel.
8 Select the Rectangle tool (
) from the same group as the 
Rounded Rectangle tool (
) in the Tools panel. Click No 
Active Grid(4) in the Plane Switching Widget.
This allows you to draw without perspective.
9 Starting from the upper-right corner of the red rectangle on the left grid plane, 
drag down and to the right, to the lower-left corner of the red rectangle on the 
right grid plane, as shown in the figure below.
	Note:  The corners of the rectangles may not line up perfectly. If you want to ensure that they do, 
you can select the Perspective Selection tool and position the rectangles to snap to each other.
10 With the rectangle still 
selected, change the Fill color 
to the building corner swatch 
in the Control panel.
11 Choose Select > Deselect and 
then File > Save.
Now that the red building is 
taking shape, you will reposition 
the coffee sign and draw some 
rectangles to attach the sign to 
the face of the building. This will 
require that you move a grid plane to match the coffee sign.

284 
LESSON 9  Working with Perspective Drawing
1 Select the Perspective Selection tool (
) in the Tools panel. Click to select the 
Coffee sign. Choose Object > Perspective > Move Plane To Match Object.
This moves the left grid plane to match the perspective of the sign. This allows 
you to draw or add more content in the same plane as the coffee sign.
2 Choose Select > Deselect. Select the Zoom tool (
) in 
the Tools panel, and drag a marquee around the coffee 
sign to zoom in to it.
3 Making sure that the Left Grid(1) is selected in the 
Plane Switching Widget, select the Rectangle tool in 
the Tools panel.
Next, you will draw some rectangles between the sign and 
the building to attach the sign to the building.
4 Starting on the left edge of the coffee sign, drag down and to the left to create a 
small rectangle, as shown in the first panel of the figure below. This acts as one 
attachment point for the sign.
5 With the rectangle still selected, change the Fill color in the Control panel to 
light blue.
6 Select the Perspective Selection tool (
) in the Tools panel. Holding down 
Shift+Alt (Windows) or Shift+Option (Mac OS), drag the new rectangle down 
to create a copy toward the bottom of the sign. Release the mouse button and 
then the modifier keys. You may need to zoom in further.
7 With the new rectangle copy still selected, Shift-click the first rectangle you just 
drew and the coffee sign and then choose Object > Group.
8 Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them off.
9 Holding down the Shift key, drag the sign group to the right so that it looks like 
it’s attached to the building. The sign position does not have to match the figure 
below exactly.
10 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
	Note:  If you 
wanted to simply 
move the coffee sign 
in perspective with the 
Perspective Selection 
tool, you would not 
have to move the grid 
plane to match it.
 Tip:  Effects can 
be applied to objects 
in perspective. For 
instance, you could 
apply a 3D extrude 
effect (Effect > 3D > 
Extrude & Bevel) to the 
coffee sign group.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  285
11 With the Perspective Selection tool, click to select the red rectangle, 
representing the left side of the building. Choose Object > Perspective > Move 
Plane To Match Object.
12 Choose Select > Deselect.
Next, you’ll move the medium gray rectangle that represents the left part of the 
second building into the proper position. In order to see a grid plane as you drag 
the rectangle into position, you can temporarily align the left grid plane to the object.
13 Press Ctrl++ (Windows) or Command++ (Mac OS) twice to zoom in to the 
Perspective Grid and artwork.
14 Choose View > Smart Guides to turn them on.
15 With the Perspective Selection tool, click to select the medium gray rectangle 
behind the coffee sign, as shown in the figure below.
	Note:  If it is difficult selecting the medium gray rectangle behind the coffee sign, you may need 
to choose View > Outline to select it by the edge and then choose View > Preview.
16 Holding down the Shift key, position the pointer over the lower-right corner 
point on the medium gray rectangle. Release the Shift key.
The left grid plane is temporarily aligned with the medium gray rectangle, which 
means that you can draw or add content to the grid on that plane. You can 
position the pointer over any of the corner points while holding the Shift key to 
do the same thing.
	Note:  Smart Guides need to be turned on (View > Smart Guides) in order for you to position the 
plane automatically, using the Shift key.
17 Drag the middle, right point on the medium gray rectangle to the right so that it 
aligns with the edge of the light gray rectangle.
After dragging the rectangle, notice that the left grid plane returns to its original 
position. This is a way to temporarily reposition a grid plane.
18 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
 Tip:  To return the 
left grid plane to the 
building face, you 
can also double-click 
the left grid plane 
control and change the 
Location to –.4 in, select 
Do Not Move, and then 
click OK.
	Note:  When 
using the Perspective 
Selection tool to resize 
or reposition an object 
in perspective, you do 
not need to position the 
grid plane.

LESSON 9  Working with Perspective Drawing
Working with symbols in perspective
Adding symbols to a perspective plane when the grid is visible is a great way to add 
repeating items, such as windows. Like text, you can bring symbols into perspective 
after creating them in Normal mode. Next, you will add some windows to the red 
building from a window symbol that is already created.
Adding symbols to the Perspective Grid
1 Press Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Shift+I (Mac OS) to show the 
Perspective Grid, and then press Ctrl++ (Windows) or Command++ (Mac OS) 
twice to zoom in to the Perspective Grid and artwork.
2 With the Perspective Selection tool (
) selected, click the left side of the red 
building on the left grid plane (the side with the text).
Next, you’ll attach a window to the left grid plane and put it on the Left face layer.
3 Click the Symbols panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to expand 
the Symbols panel. Drag the window1 symbol from the Symbols panel onto the 
left face of the red building. Notice that it is not in perspective.
4 With the Perspective Selection tool, drag the window to above the Coffee Shop 
text to attach it to the left grid plane. Then, drag the window toward the upper-
left corner of the left side of the red building. Snap it to the grid.
Drag the symbol onto the artboard.	
Drag it into perspective.
Transforming symbols in perspective
1 With the Perspective Selection tool (
), double-click the window on the left 
grid plane. A dialog box appears, telling you that you are about to edit the 
symbol definition. This means that if you edit the content, it will change all of 
the window symbols on the artboard, which are called instances. Click OK.
2 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel. Choose Select > All On Active 
Artboard. Holding down the Shift key, drag the lower-right corner of the 
window up and to the left to make it smaller. When the measurement label 
shows a width of about .6 in, release the mouse button and then the Shift key.
	Note:  To learn more 
about symbols, see 
Lesson 14, “Working 
with Symbols.”
	Note:  Make sure 
that the window is 
close to the top of the 
building, since you will 
be adding another 
row of windows below 
this one. See the figure 
for position.
	Note:  To edit 
a symbol that is 
associated with the 
Perspective Grid, you 
can also select the 
symbol and then click 
the Edit Symbol button 
( ) in the Control panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  289
3 Press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode. Notice that the window is now smaller.
Next, you will align the left edge of the window with the left edge of the rounded 
rectangle window shape at the bottom of the building face. To do that, you will 
reposition the grid origin. If you shift the origin, the X and Y coordinates of the 
horizontal plane and the X coordinate of vertical planes are affected. When you 
select an object in perspective while the grid is visible, the X and Y coordinates 
displayed in the Transform and Info panels change with the shift in the origin.
4 Select the Perspective Selection tool (
) in the Tools panel. Click to select the 
rounded rectangle window on the left side of the red building, below the Coffee 
Shop text. Choose Window > Transform to open the Transform panel. Notice 
the X and Y measurements.
5 Select the Perspective Grid tool (
) in the Tools panel. 
Position the pointer over the origin point at the bottom of 
the center, brick face of the red building on the grid. The 
cursor ( ) shows a small circle next to it. Drag the origin 
point to the lower-left corner of the red rectangle of the left grid plane. It may 
snap a little to the left of the lower-left point of the rectangle, and that’s okay.
This sets the 0,0 point (origin) for the X and Y coordinates of the horizontal 
plane and the X coordinate of vertical planes to the new origin point.
6 Select the Perspective Selection tool in the Tools panel. Click to select the 
rounded rectangle window, and then click the lower-left reference point in the 
Transform panel (
). Change the X value to .3 in.
7 Select the window above the rounded rectangle, and change the X value to
.3 in. This will align the left edge of both objects to each other at the distance 
you specified from the origin. Don’t worry if the Y position you see is different.
Drag the origin point.	
Reposition the window.	
Reposition the other window.
 Tip:  You can 
show rulers on the 
Perspective Grid by 
choosing View > 
Perspective Grid > 
Show Rulers. This shows 
you a ruler on each grid 
plane, in the units set in 
the Define Grid 
dialog box.
	Note:  To reset the 
origin point, you can 
select the Perspective 
Grid tool in the Tools 
panel and double-click 
the origin point.

windows in perspective, making a total of eight windows.
Drag a copy of the window.	
Repeat the transformation.	
Drag a copy of the windows.
13 Choose Select > Deselect.
14 With the Perspective Selection tool, starting above the left side of the red 
building, drag a marquee across the four windows on the right, above the word 
“Shop.” Shift-click the red rectangle on the left grid plane to deselect it.
Drag to select the windows.	
Shift-click to deselect.
The next step requires several key commands in a precise order, so read carefully.
	Note:  When 
you Shift-click the 
window(s), you may 
accidentally move 
them. If this happens, 
choose Edit > Undo 
Perspective Move and 
try again.

You can position the selected windows by pressing the arrow keys.
19 Choose Select > Deselect.
20 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window, and then choose File > Save.
Releasing content from perspective
There will be times when you want to use objects that are currently in perspective 
elsewhere, or you want to detach an object from a grid plane. Illustrator allows you 
to release an object from the associated perspective plane and to make it available 
as normal artwork. That’s what you’ll do next.
1 With the Perspective Selection tool (
) selected, click to select the Coffee Shop 
text on the left side of the red building.
2 Choose Object > Perspective > Release With Perspective.
3 Choose Select > Deselect.

Review questions
1 There are three preset grids. Describe briefly what each could be used for.
2 How can you show or hide the Perspective Grid?
3 Before drawing content on a grid plane, what must be done to ensure that the object is 
on the correct grid plane?
4 Describe the steps required to move content from one grid plane to another.
5 What does double-clicking a grid plane control allow you to do?
6 How do you move an object perpendicular to the grid?
Review answers
1 A one-point perspective can be very useful for roads, railway tracks, or buildings 
viewed so that the front is directly facing the viewer. Two-point perspective is useful 
for drawing a cube, such as a building, or two roads going off into the distance, and it 
typically has two vanishing points. Three-point perspective is usually used for buildings 
seen from above or below. In addition to vanishing points for each wall, there is a 
vanishing point in three-point perspective showing those walls receding into the 
ground or high in space.
2 You can hide or show the Perspective Grid by selecting the Perspective Grid 
tool (
) in the Tools panel, by choosing View > Perspective Grid > Show Grid/Hide 
Grid, or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Shift+I (Mac OS).
3 The correct grid plane must be selected by choosing it in the Plane Switching Widget; 
by using the following keyboard commands: Left Grid(1), Horizontal Grid(2), Right 
Grid(3), or No Active Grid(4); or by selecting content on the grid you want to choose 
with the Perspective Selection tool (
).
4 With the object(s) selected, begin dragging them, without releasing the mouse button 
yet. Press the number 1, 2, 3, or 4 key (depending on which grid you intend to attach 
the object[s] to) to switch to the grid plane of your choice.
5 Double-clicking a grid plane control allows you to move the plane. You can specify 
whether to move the content associated with the plane and whether to copy the 
content as the plane moves.
6 To move an object perpendicular to the grid, with the Perspective Selection tool, hold 
down the number 5 key and drag the object perpendicular to the plane.

Working with gradients
A gradient fill is a graduated blend of two or more colors. You can create your own 
gradients, or you can use the gradients provided with Adobe Illustrator and then 
edit them and save them as swatches for later use.
You can use the Gradient panel (Window > Gradient) or the Gradient tool (
) 
to apply, create, and modify gradients. In the Gradient panel, the Gradient Fill or 
Stroke box displays the current gradient colors and gradient type applied to the fill 
or stroke of an object.
In the Gradient panel, the left gradient stop under the gradient slider marks the 
starting color; the right gradient stop marks the ending color. A gradient color stop 
is the point at which a gradient changes from one color to the next. You can add 
more color stops by clicking below the gradient slider. Double-clicking a color stop 
opens a panel where you can choose a color from swatches, color sliders, or 
the eyedropper.
Creating and applying a linear gradient to a fill
To begin the lesson, you’ll create a gradient fill for the background.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), click to select the large yellow rectangle with a 
black border in the background.
The background is painted with a yellow fill color and a black stroke, as shown 
in the Fill and Stroke boxes toward the bottom of the Tools panel. The Gradient 
box below the Fill and Stroke boxes shows the last created gradient. The default 
gradient fill is a black-and-white gradient.
3 Click the Fill box to activate it, and then click the Gradient box (
) 
near the bottom of the Tools panel.
The default black-and-white gradient appears in the Fill box and is 
applied to the fill of the selected background shape. The Gradient

LESSON 10 
Blending Colors and Shapes
Adjusting the direction and angle of a gradient fill
Once you have painted an object with a gradient, you can adjust the direction, 
origin, and the beginning and end points of the gradient using the Gradient tool.
Now, you’ll adjust the gradient fill in the background shape.
1 Select the Gradient tool (
) in the 
Tools panel.
The Gradient tool works only on selected 
objects that are filled with a gradient. 
Notice the horizontal gradient annotator 
(bar) that appears in the middle of the 
rectangle. The bar indicates the direction 
of the gradient. The larger circle on 
the left shows the starting point of the 
gradient (the first color stop), and the smaller square on the right is the ending 
point (the last color stop).
 Tip:  You can hide the gradient annotator (bar) by choosing View > Hide Gradient Annotator. To 
show it again, choose View > Show Gradient Annotator.
2 Position the pointer over the bar in the 
gradient annotator.
The bar turns into the gradient slider, 
much like the one in the Gradient 
panel. You can use the gradient slider 
to edit the gradient without opening the 
Gradient panel.
3 With the Gradient tool, Shift-click the 
top of the rectangle and drag down to 
the bottom of the rectangle to change the 
position and direction of the starting and 
ending colors of the gradient. Release the 
mouse button and then the key.
Holding down the Shift key constrains 
the gradient to 45 degree angles.
4 Practice changing the gradient in the 
rectangle. For example, drag inside the rectangle to create a short gradient 
with distinct color blends; drag a longer distance beyond the rectangle edges to 
create a longer gradient with more subtle color blends. You can also drag up to 
transpose the colors and reverse the direction of the blend. Repeat step 3 before 
continuing to the next step.
 Note:  If you move 
the pointer to different 
areas of the gradient 
slider, the appearance of 
the pointer may change. 
This indicates that 
different functionality 
has been activated.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  301
5 With the Gradient tool, position the 
pointer just off the small white square at 
the bottom of the gradient annotator. A 
rotation icon (
) appears. Drag to the right 
to rotate the gradient in the rectangle.
The gradient annotator is rotated to 
indicate the direction of the gradient when 
you release the mouse button.
6 Double-click the Gradient tool in the Tools 
panel to show the Gradient panel. Change 
the rotation angle in the Angle field to –90 to 
return the gradient to vertical. Press Enter 
or Return.
7 With the background rectangle still selected, 
choose Object > Lock > Selection.
8 Choose File > Save.
Applying a gradient to a stroke
Not only can you apply a gradient to the fill of an object, but you can also apply 
a gradient blend to the stroke of an object. Unlike a gradient applied to the fill of 
an object, you cannot use the Gradient tool to edit a gradient on the stroke of an 
object. Next, you will apply a gradient fill and gradient stroke to a rectangle that 
will become a painting.
1 Click the Layers panel icon (
) to expand the 
panel. Make sure that the triangle to the left 
of the Gallery layer is toggled open. Click the 
visibility column to the left of the painting 
sublayer to reveal its content.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the 
white rectangle that appears on the artboard.
3 In the Control panel, change the Fill color to 
the painting background swatch.
4 Select the Gradient tool in the Tools 
panel, and make sure that the Fill box is 
selected toward the bottom of the Tools 
panel. Position the pointer over the top 
of the rectangle, and Shift-drag down to 
the bottom of the rectangle to change the 
position and direction of the starting and 
ending colors of the gradient. Release the 
mouse button and then the key.
 Note:  Entering the 
gradient rotation in 
the Gradient panel, 
rather than adjusting it 
directly on the artboard, 
is useful when you want 
to achieve consistency 
and precision.

5 Change the Stroke weight to 30 pt in the Control panel.
6 In the Control panel, change the Stroke 
color to the White, Black gradient. 
Press the Escape key to hide the 
Swatches panel.
Next, you will use this generic gradient 
as a starting point for the stroke gradient 
and then edit it.
Editing a gradient on a stroke
A gradient on a stroke has more options available than a gradient fill. Next, you will 
add a series of colors to the stroke gradient to create a frame for a painting.
1 Click the Gradient panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to open 
the panel.
2 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and drag a marquee across the 
upper-right corner of the selected painting rectangle to zoom in to it.
3 Click the Stroke box in the Gradient panel to edit the gradient applied to
the stroke (circled in the figure below).
4 Leave the Type as Linear, and click the Apply Gradient Across Stroke 
button (
).
You can apply a gradient to a stroke in three ways: within a stroke (default), 
along a stroke, and across a stroke.
5 Drag the black color stop to the left until the Location shows approximately 60%.
6 Double-click the white color stop, and click the Swatches button (
) to show 
the swatches. Click to select the frame 1 swatch in the top color group. Click 
outside the panel to accept the selection.
7 Position the pointer below the color ramp, between the two color stops, to add 
another color stop. When the pointer with a plus (
) appears, click to add 
another color stop (see the figure). Double-click that color stop and, with the 
swatches showing, click the light yellow swatch at the top of the panel.
 Tip:  You can delete 
a color in the color 
ramp by selecting a 
color stop and clicking 
the Delete Stop button 
or by dragging the color 
stop downward and out 
of the Gradient panel.

Edit the white color.	
Add another color to the gradient.
8 Pressing the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, drag the light yellow color 
stop to the right, close to the black color stop, and release the mouse button and 
then the modifier key. This is an easy way to duplicate a color in a gradient.
9 Pressing the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, drag the leftmost (brown) 
color stop to the right. Release the mouse button and then the modifier key, 
when it is positioned as you see in the figure below.
10 Click below the color ramp, between the two leftmost color stops, to add a final 
color stop. Double-click the color stop and, with the swatches showing, click the 
swatch named frame 2 in the top color group.

LESSON 10 
Blending Colors and Shapes
Creating and applying a radial gradient
You can create either linear or radial gradients in Illustrator. Both types of 
gradients have a starting and ending color. With a radial gradient, the starting 
color (leftmost color stop) of the gradient defines the center point of the fill, which 
radiates outward to the ending color (rightmost color stop). Next, you will create 
and apply a radial gradient fill to a plate.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Expand the Layers panel by clicking the Layers panel icon (
) on the right side 
of the workspace. Make sure that the triangle to the left of the Gallery layer is 
toggled open. Click to select the visibility column to the left of the plate sublayer 
(you may need to scroll in the Layers panel).
3 Use the Selection tool ( ) to select the 
white ellipse in the frame of the painting.
4 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools 
panel, and click the ellipse several times 
to zoom in.
5 In the Control panel, change the Fill 
color to the White, Black gradient.
6 Click the Gradient panel icon (
) to 
show the Gradient panel. In the Gradient panel, make sure that the Fill box is 
selected. Choose Radial from the Type menu to convert the linear gradient in 
the shape to a radial gradient. Keep the ellipse selected and the Gradient 
panel showing.
Editing the radial gradient colors
Once you have filled an object with a gradient, you can use the Gradient tool or the 
Gradient panel to edit the gradient, including changing the direction, color, and origin.
Next, you will use the Gradient tool to adjust the color of each color stop and add 
two more colors, for a total of four colors in the radial gradient.
1 Select the Gradient tool (
) in the Tools panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  305
2 Position the pointer over the gradient annotator (bar) in the artwork to reveal 
the gradient slider. Double-click the white color stop on the left end to edit 
the color. In the panel that appears, click the Swatches button (
), if it’s not 
already selected. Select the color called plate 1 in the second color group. Press 
the Escape key to hide the panel.
Notice that the gradient annotator starts from the center of the ellipse and 
points to the right. The dashed circle around it indicates that it is a radial 
gradient. You can set additional options for radial gradients, as you’ll soon see.
3 In the gradient slider, double-click the black color stop on the right. In the panel 
that appears, select the light yellow swatch at the top of the swatches panel. 
Press the Escape key to close the panel.
4 Position the pointer beneath the gradient slider. When the pointer with a plus 
sign appears (
), click to add another color to the gradient. See the figure 
below for placement. Double-click the new color stop beneath the gradient 
slider. In the panel that appears, select the plate 2 swatch in the second color 
group. Press the Escape key to close the panel.
 Note:  When you 
double-click the color 
stop, you can see 
the Location in the 
panel that appears. As 
you build this radial 
gradient, you can copy 
the values you see in 
the figures to closely 
match the positions of 
the color stops.

306 
LESSON 10 
Blending Colors and Shapes
5 Position the pointer beneath the gradient slider, and click to add a fourth (and 
final) color stop. See the figure for placement. Double-click the new color stop 
beneath the gradient slider. In the panel that appears, select the plate 3 swatch 
in the second color group. Make sure that the Location is 97%. Press the Escape 
key to close the panel.
Once the colors are set in the gradient, you can always delete, add more, or even 
change the order of colors. Next, you will change the order of the last two colors.
6 Double-click the leftmost color stop, and change the Location value to 42% in the 
panel that appears. Press Enter or Return to change the value and hide the panel.
7 Drag the rightmost (yellow) color stop to the left (just to the left of the closest 
brown color stop). Drag the rightmost brown color stop to the right, all the way 
to the end of the gradient slider. See the figure for how they should be arranged. 
Notice that they are still close to each other.
8 Choose File > Save.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  307
Adjusting the radial gradient
Next, you will change the aspect ratio of the gradient, adjust the position, and 
change the radius and the origin of the radial gradient.
1 With the Gradient tool, position the pointer over the small white box on the 
right end of the gradient annotator. Click and drag to the right, stopping just 
past the right edge of the ellipse shape, and release the mouse button. This 
lengthens the gradient.
	Note:  You may not see the dotted circle as you drag the end of the gradient annotator. It 
appears if you position the pointer over the gradient annotator bar first, before dragging the right 
end point. That’s okay.
2 In the Gradient panel, ensure that the Fill 
box is selected and then change the Aspect 
Ratio (
) to 40% by selecting it from the menu.
The aspect ratio changes a radial gradient into 
an elliptical gradient and makes the gradient 
better match the shape of the plate.
3 With the Gradient tool, position the pointer 
over the gradient on the plate. Click the top 
black circle on the dotted path, and drag up to 
just past the top of the ellipse shape to change the aspect ratio.
When you release the mouse button, notice that the Aspect Ratio value in the 
Gradient panel is now larger than the 40% set previously (it’s now closer to 50%).
 Note:  The aspect 
ratio is a value between 
0.5 and 32767%. As 
the aspect ratio gets 
smaller, the ellipse 
flattens and widens.

308 
LESSON 10 
Blending Colors and Shapes
Next, you will drag the gradient slider to reposition the gradient in the ellipse.
4 With the Gradient tool, click and drag the gradient slider up a little bit to move 
the gradient in the ellipse. Make sure that the bottom edge of the dotted ellipse 
is above the edge of the ellipse.
5 With the Gradient tool, click the small white dot to the left of the leftmost color 
stop and drag to the left.
This dot repositions the center of the gradient (the leftmost color stop) without 
moving the entire gradient bar and changes the radius of the gradient.
6 Choose Edit > Undo Gradient to put the gradient back to the center.
7 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Applying gradients to multiple objects
You can apply a gradient to multiple objects by selecting all the objects, applying a 
gradient color, and then dragging across the objects with the Gradient tool.
Now, you’ll paint a flower with a radial gradient fill, and then edit the colors in it.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Click the Layers panel icon (
) to open the Layers panel. Click to select the 
visibility column to the left of the flower sublayer.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  309
3 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and drag a marquee across the blue 
flower shapes to zoom in.
4 Use the Selection tool ( ), and click to select one of the blue flower shapes.
5 Choose Select > Same > Fill Color to select all five blue flower shapes.
6 In the Control panel, choose the gradient named flower from the Fill color.
When you apply a gradient to the fill or stroke of multiple selected objects, they 
are applied independently.
Now, you’ll adjust the gradient on the shapes so that the gradient blends across all 
of them as one object, and then you’ll adjust the gradient itself.
7 Make sure that the Fill box is selected at the bottom of the Tools panel.
8 Double-click the Gradient tool (
) in the Tools panel to select the tool and 
to show the Gradient panel. Drag from the approximate center of the yellow 
flower center to the outer edge of one of any one of the petal shapes, as shown 
in the figure, to apply the gradient uniformly. Leave the flower shapes selected.
Drag across the flower shapes with the Gradient tool.	
The result.
Exploring other methods for editing gradient colors
Up to this point, you’ve added, edited, and adjusted the position of colors on the 
color ramp. Next, you will reverse a gradient and adjust the midpoint between 
colors on the color ramp.
1 In the Gradient panel, with the Fill box 
selected, click the Reverse Gradient 
button (
).
You can also reverse the colors in a gradient 
by using the Gradient tool to drag across 
the gradient on the artboard in the opposite 
direction. This will make it so that the dark 
color is in the center of the gradient.

310 
LESSON 10 
Blending Colors and Shapes
2 In the color ramp, in the Gradient panel, drag the leftmost color stop to the 
right until you see approximately 20% in the Location at the bottom of the 
Gradient panel (it doesn’t have to be exact).
3 Drag the diamond icon located between the leftmost color stop and the middle 
color stop to the left, closer to the leftmost color stop. Drag until the Location 
shows a value of approximately 30% (it doesn’t have to be exact).
Another way to apply a color to a gradient is to sample the color from the artwork, 
using the Eyedropper tool, or drag a color swatch onto a color stop.
4 With the flower shapes still selected, click to select the leftmost color stop (the 
dark color) in the Gradient panel.
5 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
6 Select the Eyedropper tool (
) in the Tools panel. In the artwork, Shift-click the 
black rectangle at the bottom of the wall.
Shift-clicking with the Eyedropper tool applies the sampled color to the selected 
color stop in the gradient, rather than replacing the entire gradient with the 
color in the selected artwork.
The flower petals are complete. Now, you will group them with the flower center 
shape and apply a warp to give the whole flower some dimension.
7 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and drag a marquee across the blue 
flower shapes to zoom in.
8 With the Selection tool ( ), Shift-click the yellow center shape in the flower.

11 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Adding transparency to gradients
By specifying different opacity values for the different color stops in your gradient, 
you can create gradients that fade in or out and that show or hide underlying 
images. Next, you will create a light for the painting and apply a gradient that fades 
to transparent.
1 Click the Layers panel icon (
) to open the Layers panel. Click to select the 
visibility column to the left of the <Path> object.
2 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
3 Using the Selection tool ( ), click to select the white ellipse now showing on 
the artboard.
4 Open the Gradient panel by 
clicking the Gradient panel 
icon. Ensure that the Fill box 
is selected, click the Gradient 
menu button (
), and then 
select White, Black.
5 Choose Radial from the Type 
menu in the Gradient panel. 
Double-click the rightmost 
color stop (the black color). In the panel that appears, click the Swatches 
button (
) and select the color swatch named White. Press the Escape key 
once to hide the swatches. 
 Tip:  The Fading 
Sky and Super Soft 
Black Vignette default 
gradients are also great 
starting points for 
fading to transparency.

Working with blended objects
You can blend two distinct objects to create and 
distribute shapes evenly between two objects. 
The two shapes you blend can be the same or 
different. You can also blend between two open 
paths to create a smooth transition of color 
between objects, or you can combine blends of 
colors and objects to create color transitions in 
the shape of a particular object.
When you create a blend, the blended objects 
are treated as one object, called a blend object. If 
you move one of the original objects or edit the 
anchor points of the original object, the blend 
changes accordingly. You can also expand the 
blend to divide it into distinct objects.
Creating a blend with specified steps
Now, you’ll use the Blend tool to blend three shapes that will make up the wood 
floor of the gallery.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Click the Layers panel icon (

dialog box. Change the specified steps 
to 3. Click OK.
6 Choose View > Outline.
In Outline mode, you can see the outlines of 
the two original grapes and a straight path 
between them. These three objects are what 
a blend object is composed of, by default. It 
can be easier to edit the path between the original objects in Outline mode.
7 Make sure that the Smart Guides are selected (View > Smart Guides).
8 Select the Direct Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel. Click the anchor point 
on the right end of the path to select that anchor point. In the Control panel, 
click the Convert Selected Anchor Points To Smooth button (
) to smooth the 
curve. With the Direct Selection tool, drag the bottom direction handle up and 
to the left. See the figure for help.
9 Choose View > Preview to see the change.
10 Choose Select > Deselect.
You can modify the blend instantly by changing the shape, color, or position of the 
original objects. Next, you will edit the position of the grape on the left and see the 
effect on the blend.
11 With the Selection tool ( ), click the blended grapes to select them.
12 Double-click anywhere on the blend object to enter Isolation mode.
This temporarily ungroups the blended objects and lets you edit each original 
grape (but not the grapes created by blending), as well as the spine.
 Note:  You are 
editing the spine. 
However you edit the 
spine, the blend objects 
will follow.
 Tip:  A quick way to 
reshape the spine of a 
blend is to blend the 
shapes along another 
path. You can draw 
another path, then 
select the blend as well, 
and choose Object > 
Blend > Replace Spine.

LESSON 10 
Blending Colors and Shapes
13 Click to select the grape on the left. 
With the Selection tool, press Shift+Alt 
(Windows) or Shift+Option (Mac OS) and 
drag a corner bounding point toward the 
center to make the grape smaller. Release 
the mouse button and then the keys.
14 Press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode.
The blended objects are considered a single 
blend object. If you need to edit all the grapes 
(including the grapes that the blend created), you can expand the blend. Expanding 
the blend converts the blend to individual objects. You can no longer edit the blend 
as a single object because it has become a group of individual grape shapes. Next, 
you will expand the blend.
15 Choose Object > Blend > Expand. With the 
grapes still selected, notice the word “Group” 
on the left side of the Control panel.
The blend is now a group of individual 
shapes that you can edit independently.
16 Choose Select > Deselect.
17 Choose File > Save.
Creating and editing smooth color blends
You can choose several options for blending the shapes and colors of objects to 
create a new object. When you choose the Smooth Color blend option, Illustrator 
combines the shapes and colors of the objects into many intermediate steps, 
creating a smooth, graduated blend between the original objects.
Now, you’ll combine three shapes into a smooth color blend to make a banana.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window. Press Ctrl++ (Windows) or 
Command++ (Mac OS) twice to zoom in.
You will now blend the three paths that are behind the blended grapes. All of the 
paths have a stroke color and no fill. Objects that have strokes blend differently 
than those that have no stroke.
2 With the Blend tool, position the pointer over the top line until it displays an X 
(
), and then click. Click the middle (yellow) line with the Blend tool pointer 
that displays a plus sign (
) to add it to the blend. Position the pointer over the 
third line (away from the grapes), and click when a plus sign (+) appears next to 
the pointer.
 Tip:  You can reverse 
a blend by choosing 
Object > Blend > 
Reverse Front To Back.
 Tip:  To release, or 
remove, a blend from 
the original objects, 
select the blend and 
choose Object >  
Blend > Release.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  317
You’ve created a blend with the same settings as before (a specified step blend). 
Next, you will change the blend settings for the banana so that it blends as 
smooth color.
3 Double-click the Blend tool (
) in the Tools 
panel. In the Blend Options dialog box, choose 
Smooth Color from the Spacing menu to set up 
the blend options, which will remain set until 
you change them. Click OK.
4 Choose Select > Deselect.
When you make a smooth color blend between 
objects, Illustrator automatically calculates the 
number of intermediate steps necessary to create 
the transition between the objects. Once you’ve applied a smooth color blend to 
objects, you can edit it. Next, you will edit the paths that make up the blend.
5 Using the Selection tool ( ), double-click the color blend (the banana) to enter 
Isolation mode. Click to select the middle path, and change the Stroke color in 
the Control panel to any color you want. Notice how the colors are blended. 
Choose Edit > Undo Apply Swatch to return to the original stroke color.
6 Double-click away from the blend paths to exit Isolation mode.
7 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
8 Open the Layers panel and click to select the visibility column for all of the 
sublayers, including the Mask sublayer, to make all objects visible on the artboard.
9 In the Layers panel, click to select the 
Gallery layer.
10 Click the Make/Release Clipping Mask 
button (
) at the bottom of the 
Layers panel.
This uses the first shape (the Mask shape) 
as a clipping mask to hide artwork that is 
outside the bounds of the shape.
11 Choose File > Save, and close all open files.
 Tip:  Creating 
smooth color blends 
between paths can 
be difficult in certain 
situations. For instance, 
if the lines intersect or 
the lines are too curved, 
unexpected results  
can occur.

Review answers
1 A gradient is a graduated blend of two or more colors or of tints of the same color. 
Gradients can be applied to the stroke or fill of an object.
2 To apply a gradient to a selected object, select an object, and do one of the following:
• 
Select the Stroke or Fill box, and then click the Gradient box in the Tools panel 
to fill an object with the default white-to-black gradient or with the last 
selected gradient.
• 
Change the Fill color or Stroke color in the Control panel to apply a gradient to 
selected content.
• 
Select the Stroke or Fill box in the Tools panel, and then click a gradient swatch in 
the Swatches panel.
• 
Use the Eyedropper tool to sample a gradient from an object in your artwork, and 
then apply it to the selected object.
3 To adjust the blend between colors in a gradient, with the Gradient tool selected, and 
the pointer over the gradient annotator or in the Gradient panel, you can drag the 
diamond icons or color stops of the gradient slider.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  319
4 To add colors to a gradient, in the Gradient panel, click beneath the gradient slider to 
add a gradient stop to the gradient. Then double-click the color stop to edit the color, 
using the panel that appears to mix a new color or to apply an existing color swatch. 
You can select the Gradient tool in the Tools panel, position the pointer over the 
gradient-filled object, and then click beneath the gradient slider that appears in the 
artwork to add a color stop.
5 Drag with the Gradient tool to adjust the direction of a gradient. Dragging a long 
distance changes colors gradually; dragging a short distance makes the color change 
more abrupt. You can also rotate the gradient using the Gradient tool and change the 
radius, aspect ratio, starting point, and more.
6 The difference between a gradient and a blend is the way that colors combine 
together—colors blend together within a gradient and between objects in 
a blend.
7 You can blend the shapes and colors of objects by doing one of the following:
• 
Clicking each object with the Blend tool to create a blend of intermediate steps 
between the objects, according to preset blend options.
• 
Selecting the objects and choosing Object > Blend > Blend Options to set the 
number of intermediate steps, and then choosing Object > Blend > Make to create 
the blend. 
Objects that have painted strokes blend differently than those with no strokes.
8 When you choose Smooth Color blend, Illustrator automatically calculates the 
number of intermediate steps necessary to create a seamlessly smooth blend between 
the selected objects. Specifying the number of steps lets you determine how many 
intermediate steps are visible in the blend. You can also specify the distance between 
intermediate steps in the blend.
9 You can use the Direct Selection tool to select and adjust the shape of an original 
object, thus changing the shape of the blend. You can change the colors of the original 
objects to adjust the intermediate colors in the blend. Use the Convert Anchor Point 
tool to change the shape of the path, or spine, of the blend by dragging anchor points 
or direction handles on the spine.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  323
Working with brushes
Using brushes, you can decorate paths with 
patterns, figures, brush strokes, textures, or 
angled strokes. You can modify the brushes 
provided with Illustrator and create your
own brushes.
You can apply brush strokes to existing paths, 
or you can use the Paintbrush tool to draw a 
path and apply a brush stroke simultaneously. 
You can change the color, size, and other 
features of a brush, and you can edit paths 
after brushes are applied.
There are five types of brushes that appear in the Brushes panel (Window > 
Brushes): Calligraphic, Art, Pattern, Scatter, and Bristle. In this lesson, you will 
discover how to work with all of these except for the Scatter brush.
Using Calligraphic brushes
Calligraphic brushes resemble strokes drawn with the angled 
point of a calligraphic pen. Calligraphic brushes are defined 
by an elliptical shape whose center follows the path. You can 
use these brushes to create the appearance of hand-drawn 
strokes made with a flat, angled pen tip.
Next, you’ll use a Calligraphic pen to create the bunting on 
the train car.
1 Click the Brushes panel icon ( ) on the right side of the 
workspace to expand the Brushes panel.
2 In the Brushes panel, choose List View from the panel menu (
).
3 Open the Brushes panel menu (
), and deselect Show Art Brushes, Show 
Bristle Brushes, and Show Pattern Brushes, leaving only the Calligraphic 
brushes visible in the Brushes panel.

LESSON 11  Working with Brushes
4 In the Control panel, click the Stroke color and choose the light orange swatch. 
Change the Stroke weight to 2 pt, and make sure that the Fill color is None.
Calligraphic brushes use the current stroke color when you apply the brushes
to artwork.
5 Double-click the Pencil tool (
) in the Tools panel. In the Pencil Tool Options 
dialog box, change the Smoothness to 100% and leave the rest of the settings at 
their default settings. Click OK.
6 Position the pointer in the upper-left corner of the red train car shape, and draw 
two “U” shapes on the train car, from left to right, in one continuous motion. 
This will be the bunting on the car.
7 With the shape you drew selected, select the 5 pt. Oval brush in the Brushes 
panel to apply it to the line. You may need to scroll down. Notice that the stroke 
weight changes in the Control panel.
Editing a brush
To change the options for a brush, you can double-click the brush in the Brushes 
panel. Edits will apply to the current document only, although you can also choose 
to change artwork to which the brush has been applied. Next, you’ll change the 
appearance of the 5 pt. Oval brush.
1 In the Brushes panel, double-click the name 5 pt. Oval brush and change the 
name to 30 pt. Oval. Press Enter or Return.
2 In the Brushes panel, double-click the 30 pt. Oval brush thumbnail or to the 
right of the brush name to display the Calligraphic Brush Options dialog box.
3 Enter 0 for the Angle and 
choose Fixed from the 
menu to the right. Change 
the Roundness to 10% and 
choose Fixed from the menu 
to the right. Change the Size 
to 30 pt and select Preview. 
Click OK.
	Note:  The edits

bunting path still selected, click the 30 pt. Oval brush again to apply it to the path.
5 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.
Using a fill color with brushes
When you apply a brush to an object’s stroke, 
you can also apply a fill color to paint the interior 
of the object with a color. When you use a fill 
color with a brush, the brush objects appear on 
top of the fill color in places where the fill and 
the brush objects overlap. Now, you’ll fill the 
bunting shape you created with a fill color.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), select the bunting 
shape that you drew.
2 Click the Fill color in the Control panel, and select 
the CMYK Cyan swatch.
3 Click outside the artwork to deselect it.
Removing a brush stroke
You can easily remove a brush stroke applied to artwork where you don’t want 
it. Now, you’ll remove the brush stroke on the path above the duck, on the train 
engine. This path had the original 5 pt. Oval brush you edited applied to it.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), click the dark gray path above the duck.
2 Click the Remove Brush Stroke button (
) at the bottom of the Brushes panel.
3 Change the Stroke weight to 10 pt in the Control panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  331
Using Bristle brushes
Bristle brushes allow you to create strokes with the 
appearance of a natural brush with bristles. You’ll start by 
adjusting options for a brush to change how it appears in the 
artwork and then paint with the Paintbrush tool and Bristle 
brush to create a fire effect.
Changing Bristle brush options
As you’ve seen earlier, you can change the appearance of a 
brush by adjusting its settings in the Brush Options dialog 
box, either before or after brushes have been applied to the artwork. When you 
paint with a Bristle brush, it creates vector paths. It is usually best to adjust Bristle 
brush settings prior to painting, since it can take some time to update the brush strokes.
1 In the Brushes panel, choose Show Bristle Brushes from the panel menu (
) 
and then deselect Show Art Brushes.
2 Double-click the thumbnail for the Filbert brush or directly to the right of the 
brush name to open the Bristle Brush Options dialog box for that brush. Leave 
the dialog box open for the next step.

the brush.
• 
Change the Bristle Length to 
178%. The bristle length starts 
from the point where the bristles 
meet the handle of the bristle tip.
• 
Change the Bristle Density to 
84%. The bristle density is the 
number of bristles in a specified 
area of the brush neck.
• 
For Bristle Thickness, set the value to 
74%. The bristle thickness can vary from fine to coarse (between 1% and 100%).
• 
For Paint Opacity, change the value to 90%. This option lets you set the 
opacity of the paint being used.
• 
For Stiffness, change the value to 29%. Stiffness implies the rigidness of
the bristles.

LESSON 11  Working with Brushes
Painting with a Bristle brush
Now, you’ll use the Filbert brush to draw some fire. Painting with a Bristle brush 
can create a very organic stroke. In order to constrain the painting, you will paint 
inside a shape. This will mask (hide) part of the painting to be in the shape of a flame.
1 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and drag a marquee around the 
flame shape to the left of the dinosaur, to zoom in on it.
2 Select the Selection tool ( ) in the Tools panel, and click to select the flame 
shape. This selects the layer that the shape is on so that any artwork you paint 
will be on the same layer.
3 Click the Draw Inside button (
) at the bottom of the Tools panel.
	Note:  If the Tools panel appears as one column, click and hold down the Drawing Modes button 
at the bottom of the Tools panel, and then choose a Drawing mode from the menu that appears.
4 Choose Select > Deselect to deselect the flame shape. You can still draw inside 
the shape, as indicated by the dotted lines on the corners of the shape.
5 Select the Paintbrush tool (
) in the Tools panel. Choose the Filbert brush 
from the Brush Definition menu in the Control panel, if it’s not already chosen.
6 Change the Fill color to None and Stroke color to flame red in the Control panel. 
Press the Escape key to hide the Swatches panel. Make sure that the Stroke 
weight is 1 pt in the Control panel.
7 Position the pointer at the upper-left tip of the flame shape. Drag down and to 
the right to loosely follow the top edge of the flame shape. Release the mouse 
button when you pass the lower-right tip of the flame shape.
When you release the mouse button, notice that the path you just painted is 
masked by the flame shape.
8 Use the Paintbrush tool (
) to provide some texture by drawing more strokes 
inside the flame shape, using the Filbert brush.
 Tip:  If you don’t like what you just painted, you can choose Edit > Undo Bristle Stroke.
Next, you will edit the brush and paint with another color to build the flame by 
layering paths.
	Note:  To learn  
more about the 
drawing modes, see 
Lesson 3, “Creating and 
Editing Shapes.”
 Tip:   If you want to 
edit paths as you draw, 
you can select the Keep 
Selected option in the 
Paintbrush Tool Options 
for the Paintbrush tool 
or select paths with 
the Selection tool. 
You don’t need to 
completely fill 
the shape.

LESSON 11  Working with Brushes
The Bristle brush and 
graphic tablets
When you use a Bristle brush with a graphic tablet, Illustrator interactively tracks the 
movements of the stylus over the tablet. It interprets all aspects of its orientation 
and pressure input at any point along a drawing path. Illustrator provides the 
output that is modeled on the stylus’s x-axis position, y-axis position, pressure, tilt, 
bearing, and rotation.
A cursor annotator that simulates the tip of an actual brush is displayed when using 
a tablet and stylus that support rotation. This annotator does not appear when 
other input devices such as a mouse are used. The annotator is also disabled while 
using the precise cursors.
Note: Use the Wacom Intuos 3 or higher tablet with Art (6D) pen to explore the full 
capabilities of the Bristle brush. Illustrator can interpret all 6-degrees of freedom that 
this device combination provides. However, other devices including the Wacom Grip pen 
and Art brush pen may not be able to interpret some attributes such as rotation. These 
uninterpreted attributes are treated as constants in the resulting brush strokes.
While using a mouse, only x and y-axis movements are recorded. Other inputs, such 
as tilt, bearing, rotation, and pressure remain fixed resulting in even and 
consistent strokes.
For Bristle brush strokes, feedback is displayed when you drag the tool. This 
feedback provides an approximate view of the final stroke.
Note: Bristle brush strokes are made up of several overlapping, filled transparent paths. 
These paths, like any other filled path in Illustrator, interact with the paint of other 
objects, including other bristle brush paths. However, the fill for strokes does not self-
interact. Therefore, layered, individual, bristle brush strokes build up and interact with 
each other, but a single stroke scrubbed back and forth in place does not interact with 
itself and build up.
—From Illustrator Help
Using Pattern brushes
Pattern brushes paint a pattern made up of separate 
sections, or tiles. When you apply a Pattern brush to 
artwork, different tiles of the pattern are applied to different 
sections of the path, depending on where the section falls on 
the path—the end, middle, or corner. There are hundreds of 
interesting Pattern brushes that you can choose from when 
creating your own projects, from dog tracks to cityscapes. 
Next, you’ll open an existing Pattern Brush library and 
choose a train track pattern to create tracks.
Pattern brush 
examples

box is used to edit the properties of the brushed path without updating the 
corresponding brush.
11 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Creating a Pattern brush
You can create a Pattern brush in several ways. For a simple pattern applied to 
a straight line, for instance, you can select the content that you’re using for the 
pattern and click the New Brush button (
) at the bottom of the Brushes panel. 
To create a more complex pattern to apply to objects with curves and corners, you 
must first create swatches in the Swatches panel from the artwork that you are 
using for the Pattern brush tiles and then create the new brush. For example, to 
create a Pattern brush that will be used on a straight line with corners, you might 
need to create three swatches, one for the straight line, another for the inside 
corner and another for the outside corner. Next, you’ll create swatches to be used 
in a Pattern brush.
1 Click the Layers panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to expand the 
Layers panel.
2 Click the visibility column to the left of the Frame layer to show its contents.
3 Click the Swatches panel icon (
) to expand the Swatches panel, or choose 
Window > Swatches.
Now, you’ll create a pattern swatch.
4 Choose 2 from the Artboard Navigation menu in the lower-left corner of the 
Document window.
5 With the Selection tool ( ), drag the flower into the Swatches panel. The new 
pattern swatch appears in the Swatches panel.
 Tip:  To change 
the size of the railroad 
tracks, you can also 
change the stroke of 
the line on the artboard, 
with the brush applied.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  337
6 Choose Select > Deselect.
7 In the Swatches panel, double-click the pattern 
swatch that you just created. In the Pattern 
Options dialog box, name the swatch Corner and 
choose 1 x 1 from the Copies menu. 
8 Click Done in the gray bar along the top of the 
Document window to finish editing the pattern.
9 Repeat steps 5 through 7 to create a pattern 
swatch of the orange circle located to the left of 
the flower on the artboard. Name the swatch Side.
To create a new Pattern brush, you apply swatches 
from the Swatches panel to tiles in the Brush 
Options dialog box. Now, you’ll apply the pattern 
swatches that you just made to tiles, to create a 
new Pattern brush.
10 Click the Brushes panel icon ( ) to expand the panel.
11 Choose Select > Deselect, if there is content selected.
This is an important step! Any content selected will be part of the brush.
12 In the Brushes panel, click the New Brush button ( ).
13 In the New Brush dialog box, select Pattern Brush.
Notice that you can’t select the Art Brush or Scatter Brush. That is because 
artwork needs to be selected in the document first. Click OK.
Now, you’ll apply the swatches to the tiles for the new Pattern brush.
 Tip:  For more 
information on creating 
pattern swatches, see 
“About patterns” in 
Illustrator Help.

338 
LESSON 11  Working with Brushes
14 In the Pattern Brush Options dialog box, name the brush Border.
15  Under the Spacing option, make 
sure that the Side Tile box is 
selected. Below the tile boxes, select 
Side. The Side swatch appears in 
the Side tile box.
The Pattern Brush Options dialog 
box shows the tiles in the new 
brush you are making. The first tile 
on the left is the side tile, which is 
used to paint the middle sections of 
a path. The second tile is the outer 
corner tile. The third tile is the 
inner corner tile. The names of the pattern swatches that are in the Swatches 
panel are listed under the tiles.
Pattern brushes can have up to five tiles—the side, start, and end tiles, plus an 
outer corner tile and an inner corner tile to paint sharp corners on a path. Some 
brushes have no corner tiles because the brush is designed for curved paths.
In the next part of this lesson, you’ll create your own Pattern brush that has corner 
tiles. Next, you’ll apply the Corner swatch to the outer corner and inner corner tiles 
for the new Pattern brush.
16 In the Pattern Brush Options 
dialog box, select the Outer Corner 
Tile box (the second tile box from 
the left). In the pattern swatches 
list, select Corner. The Corner 
swatch appears in the Outer Corner 
Tile box.
17 Select the Inner Corner Tile box 
(the middle tile box). In the pattern 
swatches list, select the Corner 
swatch. The Corner swatch appears 
in the Inner Corner Tile box. 
Click OK.
You won’t create a start or end tile for the new brush, because you’ll apply the 
new brush to a path in the artwork next. When you want to create a Pattern 
brush that includes start and end tiles, you add those tiles the same way as you 
did the side and corner tiles.
The Border brush appears in the Brushes panel.
 Tip:  To save a brush and reuse it in another file, you can create a brush library with the brushes 
you want to use. For more information, see “Work with brush libraries” in Illustrator Help. 
 Tip:  Position the 
pointer over the tile 
squares in the Pattern 
Brush Options dialog 
box to see a tool tip 
indicating which tile 
it is.
 Note:  When you 
create a new brush, the 
brush appears in the 
Brushes panel of the 
current document only. 

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  339
Applying a Pattern brush
In this section, you’ll apply the Border Pattern brush to a rectangular border 
around the artwork. When you use drawing tools to apply brushes to artwork, you 
first draw the path with the drawing tool and then select the brush in the Brushes 
panel to apply the brush to the path.
1 Click the First artboard button (
) in the lower-left corner of the Document 
window to return to the first artboard and to fit it in the Document window.
2 With the Selection tool ( ) selected, click the white stroke of the rectangle on 
the border.
3 In the Tools panel, click the Fill box and make sure that None (
) is selected. 
Then, click the Stroke box and select None (
).
4 Click the Brushes panel icon ( ) to expand the panel and choose Thumbnail 
View from the Brushes panel menu (
).
Notice that Pattern brushes in Thumbnail view are segmented in the Brushes 
panel. Each segment corresponds to a pattern tile. The side tile is repeated in 
the Brushes panel thumbnail preview.
5 With the rectangle selected, click the Border brush in the Brushes panel.
The rectangle is painted with the Border brush, with the side tile on the sides 
and the corner tile on the corners.
Now, you’ll edit the Border brush.
6 In the Brushes panel, double-click the Border Pattern brush to open the Pattern 
Brush Options dialog box.

LESSON 11  Working with Brushes
7 In the Pattern Brush Options dialog 
box, change the Scale to 70% and 
the Spacing to 120% and then 
select Add Space To Fit. Click OK.
8 In the Brush Change Alert dialog 
box, click Apply To Strokes to 
update the border on the artboard.
9 With the Selection tool selected, 
click to select the arch right above 
the duck’s head. Click the Border 
brush in the Brushes panel to 
apply it.
Notice that the flowers are not applied to the path. The path is painted with the 
side swatch from the Border brush, to which the side tile is applied. Because the 
path does not include sharp corners, the outer corner and inner corner tiles are 
not applied to the path.
10 Choose Edit > Undo Apply Pattern Brush to remove the brush from the arch.
	Note:  Earlier in the lesson, you learned how to remove a brush from an object by clicking the 
Remove Brush Stroke button (
) in the Brushes panel. In this case, you chose Edit > Undo Apply 
Pattern Brush instead, because clicking the Remove Brush Stroke button would strip the previous 
formatting from the arch, leaving it with a default fill and stroke.
Editing Pattern brush tiles
You can edit the tiles in a Pattern brush by creating (or updating) swatches and 
applying the new swatches to the tiles in the Pattern Brush Options dialog box.
You can also change the pattern tiles in a Pattern brush by pressing the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key and dragging the new artwork from the artboard 
onto the tile you wish to change in the Brushes panel.
Changing the color attributes of brushes
The colors that a Scatter, Art, or Pattern brush paints depend on the current stroke 
color and the colorization method of the brush. If you have not set a colorization 
method, the default color for that brush is used. For example, the train logo Art 
brush was applied with its default color (not the current stroke of black) because its 
colorization method was set to None.
To colorize Art, Pattern, and Scatter brushes, you can use three editing options in 
the Brush Options dialog box: Tints, Tints and Shades, and Hue Shift. 

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  341
To learn more about each of these colorization methods, search for “Colorization 
options” in Illustrator Help.
 Note:  Brushes colorized with a stroke color of white may appear entirely white. Brushes colorized 
with a stroke color of black may appear entirely black. Results depend on which brush colors were 
originally chosen.
Changing a brush color using Tints colorization
Now, you’ll change the color of the train logo Art brush using the Tints
colorization method.
1 In the Brushes panel, choose Show Art Brushes from the panel menu (
) and 
deselect Show Pattern Brushes.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the train logo (the circle with the train 
logo Art brush applied) below the duck.
3 Pressing the Shift key, click the Stroke 
color in the Control panel to open 
the Color panel. Change the values to 
C=3, M=92, Y=100, K=16.
4 In the Brushes panel, double-click the train 
logo brush to view the Art Brush Options 
dialog box. 
A tool tip appears with the brush name when 
you position the pointer over it. Select Preview 
(if necessary) to see the changes you will make, and then move the dialog box off 
to the side so that you can see your artwork as you work.
5 In the Colorization section of the Art 
Brush Options dialog box, choose 
Tints from the Method menu.
The selected path with the train 
logo brush applied is colorized and 
displays the brush stroke in tints of 
the stroke color. Portions of the art 
that are black become the stroke 
color, portions that aren’t black 
become tints of the stroke color, and 
white remains white.
	Note:  The Tints And Shades colorization 
method displays the brush stroke in tints and shades of the stroke color. Tints And Shades 
maintains black and white, and everything between becomes a blend from black to white through 
the stroke color.
 Tip:  To learn more 
about how the different 
colorization methods 
affect artwork, click the 
light bulb icon ( ) in 
the Art Brush Options 
dialog box.

LESSON 11  Working with Brushes
Working with the Blob Brush tool
You can use the Blob Brush tool to paint filled shapes that intersect and merge 
with other shapes of the same color. With the Blob Brush tool, you can draw with 
Paintbrush tool artistry. Unlike the Paintbrush tool, which lets you create open 
paths, the Blob Brush tool lets you create a closed shape with a fill only (no stroke) 
that you can then easily edit with the Eraser or Blob Brush tool. Shapes that have a 
stroke cannot be edited with the Blob Brush tool.

the workspace switcher, 
choose Essentials 
before choosing 
Reset Essentials in the 
workspace switcher.
 Note:  When 
drawing with the Blob 
Brush tool, if a fill and 
stroke are set before 
drawing, the stroke 
becomes the fill of the 
shape made by the Blob 
Brush tool. If only a fill 
is set before drawing, it 
becomes the fill of the 
shape created.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  345
7 Choose Select > Deselect.
Merging paths with the Blob Brush tool
Besides drawing new shapes with the Blob Brush tool, you can use it to intersect 
and merge shapes of the same color. Next, you will merge the smoke you just 
created with the white ellipse to the right of it to create one big smoke shape.
1 Click the Appearance panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to 
expand the panel. In the Appearance panel menu (
), deselect New Art Has 
Basic Appearance. When this option is deselected, the Blob Brush tool uses the 
attributes of the selected artwork.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), click the smoke you just drew and Shift-click the 
white ellipse to the right of the smoke shape.
3 In the Appearance panel, click the word “Path” at the top of the panel so that 
the drop shadow you apply next isn’t applied to the fill or stroke only.
 Note:  If you see “Mixed Appearances” in the Appearance panel with both shapes selected, then 
press the letter D to apply the default fill and stroke and then change the stroke to 0 in the Control 
panel, to remove it.
4 Choose Effect > Stylize > Drop Shadow. 
In the Drop Shadow dialog box, change 
Opacity to 35%, X Offset to 3 px, Y Offset to 
3 px, and Blur to 2 px. Click OK.
5 Choose Select > Deselect.
6 With the Blob Brush tool selected in the 
Tools panel, make sure that you see the 
same attributes as the smoke shapes (a white 
fill, no stroke, and a drop shadow) in the 
Appearance panel. Drag from inside the 
smoke shape you created to the inside of the ellipse to the right, connecting the 
two shapes.
 Note:  Objects merged with the Blob Brush tool need to have the same appearance attributes, 
have no stroke, be on the same layer or group, and be adjacent to each other in the stacking order.
 Note:  When you 
draw with the Blob 
Brush tool, you create 
filled, closed shapes. 
Those shapes can 
contain any type of fill, 
including gradients, 
solid colors, patterns, 
and more.
 Note:  Notice that 
the drop shadow is 
applied to the entire 
shape as you draw 
and edit.

346 
LESSON 11  Working with Brushes
7 Continue drawing with the Blob Brush tool to make the smoke look more like
a cloud. When you release the mouse button, the drop shadow is applied.
If you find that new shapes are being made, instead of the existing cloud shape 
being edited, undo what you’ve created; then, with the Selection tool, reselect 
and then deselect the cloud shape and continue.
8 With the Blob Brush tool, add more shape to the ellipse part of the smoke on 
the right side to make it more cloud-like.
9 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Editing with the Eraser tool
As you draw and merge shapes with the Blob Brush tool, you may draw too much 
and want to edit what you’ve done. You can use the Eraser tool to mold the shape 
and correct any changes you don’t like.
 Tip:  As you draw with the Blob Brush and Eraser tools, it is recommended that you use shorter 
strokes and release the mouse button often. You can undo the edits that you make, but if you draw 
in one long stroke without releasing the mouse button, an undo removes the entire stroke.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the smoke shape.
2 Select the Eraser tool (
) in the Tools panel. Proceed slowly with the next 
steps, and remember that you can always stop and undo.
3 Position the pointer over the cloud shape, and press the right bracket key (]) 
several times to increase the size of Eraser brush.
4 With the Eraser tool, drag along the bottom of the smoke shape to remove some 
of the smoke.
The Blob Brush and Eraser tools have pointers that include a circle, indicating 
the diameter of the brush.
 Note:  Selecting the 
shape before selecting 
the Eraser tool limits 
the Eraser tool so that it 
erases only the selected 
shape.

The Blob Brush tool guidelines
When using the Blob Brush tool, keep the following guidelines in mind:
• 
To merge paths, they must be adjacent in stacking order.
• 
The Blob Brush tool creates paths with a fill and no stroke. If you want your Blob 
Brush paths to merge with existing artwork, make sure that the artwork has the 
same fill color and no stroke.
• 
When drawing paths with the Blob Brush tool, new paths merge with the topmost 
matching path encountered. If the new path touches more than one matching path 
within the same group or layer, all of the intersecting paths are merged together.
• 
To apply paint attributes (such as effect or transparency) to the Blob Brush tool, 
select the brush and set the attributes in the Appearances panel before you  
start drawing.
• 
You can use the Blob Brush tool to merge paths created by other tools. To do 
this, make sure that the existing artwork does not have a stroke; then set up the 
Blob Brush tool to have the same fill color, and draw a new path that intersects 
all of the paths that you want to merge together.

 Note:  You may need 
to select the Selection 
tool and reposition the 
text “Ted and Fuego 
Take a Train” to center 
the text on the smoke.

LESSON 11  Working with Brushes
Review questions
1 Describe each of the five brush types: Art, Calligraphic, Pattern, Bristle, and Scatter.
2 What is the difference between applying a brush to artwork using the Paintbrush tool 
and applying a brush to artwork using one of the drawing tools?
3 Describe how to edit paths with the Paintbrush tool as you draw. How does the Keep 
Selected option affect the Paintbrush tool?
4 How do you change the colorization method for an Art, Pattern, or Scatter brush? 
(Remember, you don’t use colorization methods with Calligraphic or Bristle brushes.)
5 For which brush types must you have artwork selected on the artboard before you can 
create a brush?
6 What does the Blob Brush tool allow you to create?
Review answers
1 The following are the five brush types:
• 
Art brushes stretch artwork evenly along a path. Art brushes include strokes that 
resemble graphic media, such as the Charcoal - Thick brush used in the lesson. Art 
brushes also include objects, such as the arrow brush.
• 
Calligraphic brushes are defined by an elliptical shape whose center follows the 
path. They create strokes that resemble hand-drawn lines made with a flat, angled 
calligraphic pen tip.
• 
Pattern brushes paint a pattern made up of separate sections, or tiles, for the 
sides, ends, and corners of the path. When you apply a Pattern brush to artwork, 
the brush applies different tiles from the pattern to different sections of the path, 
depending on where the section falls on the path.
• 
Bristle brushes allow you to create brush strokes with the appearance of a natural 
brush with bristles.
• 
Scatter brushes scatter an object, such as a leaf, along a path. You can adjust the 
size, spacing, scatter, and rotation options to change the appearance of the brush.
2 To apply brushes using the Paintbrush tool, you select the tool, choose a brush in the 
Brushes panel, and draw on the artboard. The brush is applied directly to the paths as 
you draw. To apply brushes using a drawing tool, you select the tool and draw in the 

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  349
artwork. Then, you select the path in the artwork and choose a brush in the Brushes 
panel. The brush is applied to the selected path.
3 To edit a path with the Paintbrush tool, drag over a selected path to redraw it. The 
Keep Selected option keeps the last path selected as you draw with the Paintbrush tool. 
Leave the Keep Selected option selected (the default setting) when you want to easily 
edit the previous path as you draw. Deselect the Keep Selected option when you want 
to draw layered paths with the paintbrush without altering previous paths. When Keep 
Selected is deselected, you can use the Selection tool to select a path and then edit it. 
4 To change the colorization method of a brush, double-click the brush in the Brushes 
panel to open the Brush Options dialog box. Use the Method menu in the Colorization 
section to select another method. If you choose Hue Shift, you can use the default 
color displayed in the dialog box preview or you can change the key color by clicking 
the Key Color Eyedropper and clicking a color in the preview. Click OK to accept the 
settings, and close the Brush Options dialog box. Click Apply To Strokes in the alert 
dialog box if you want to apply the changes to existing strokes in the artwork.
Existing brush strokes are colorized with the stroke color that was selected when 
the strokes were applied to the artwork. New brush strokes are colorized with the 
current stroke color. To change the color of existing strokes after applying a different 
colorization method, select the strokes and select a new stroke color.
5 For Art and Scatter brushes, you need to have artwork selected in order to create a 
brush using the New Brush button in the Brushes panel.
6 Use the Blob Brush tool to edit filled shapes that you can intersect and merge with 
other shapes of the same color or to create artwork from scratch.

12 APPLYING EFFECTS
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Use various effects, such as Pathfinder, Scribble, and 
Drop Shadow.
• Use Warp effects to distort type.
• Create three-dimensional (3D) objects from 
two-dimensional (2D) artwork.
• Map artwork to the surfaces of three-dimensional objects.
This lesson takes approximately an hour to complete. If needed, remove 
the previous lesson folder from your hard disk and copy the Lesson12 
folder onto it.

351
Effects change the look of an object. Effects are live, 
which means that you can apply an effect to an object 
and then modify or remove it at any time, using the 
Appearance panel. Using effects, it’s easy to apply 
drop shadows, turn two-dimensional artwork into 
three-dimensional shapes, and much more.

352 
LESSON 12 
Applying Effects
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll create objects using various effects. Before you begin, you’ll 
need to restore the default preferences for Adobe Illustrator. Then, you’ll open a file 
containing the finished artwork to see what you’ll create.
1 To ensure that the tools and panels function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CS6 preferences file. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 3.
2 Start Adobe Illustrator CS6.
	Note:  If you have not already done so, copy the Lesson12 folder from the Lessons folder on the 
Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book CD onto your hard disk. See “Copying the Classroom in a 
Book files” on page 2.
3 Choose File > Open, and open the L12end.ai 
file in the Lesson12 folder, located in the 
Lessons folder on your hard disk.
This file displays a completed illustration of a 
soda can.
4 Choose View > Zoom Out to make the 
finished artwork smaller. Adjust the window 
size, and leave it on your screen as you work. 
(Use the Hand tool [

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  353
Using live effects
The Effect menu commands alter the appearance of 
an object without changing the base object. Applying 
an effect automatically adds the effect to the object’s 
appearance attribute. You can apply more than one 
effect to an object. You can edit, move, delete, or 
duplicate an effect at any time in the Appearance 
panel. To edit the points that the effect creates, you 
must first expand the object.
There are two types of effects in Illustrator: vector 
effects and raster effects. In Illustrator, click the Effect 
menu item to see the different types of effects available.
• Illustrator effects: The top half of the Effect menu contains vector effects. You 
can apply these effects only to vector objects or to the fill or stroke of a bitmap 
object in the Appearance panel. The following vector effects can be applied to 
both vector and bitmap objects: 3D effects, SVG filters, Warp effects, Transform 
effects, Drop Shadow, Feather, Inner Glow, and Outer Glow.
• Photoshop effects: The bottom half of the Effect menu contains raster effects. 
You can apply them to either vector or bitmap objects.
Applying an effect
Effects are applied using the Effect menu or the Appearance panel and can be 
applied to objects or groups. In this part of the lesson, you are first going to learn 
how to apply an effect to a soda can label using the Effect menu and then you will 
apply an effect using the Appearance panel.
1 Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar to 
reset the workspace.
2 Choose View > Smart Guides to deselect them.
3 With the Selection tool ( ), click the text shapes “Sparkling Soda” on the artboard.
4 With the group selected, choose Effect > Stylize > Drop Shadow from the 
Illustrator Effects section of the menu that appears.
5 In the Drop Shadow dialog box, change the 
X Offset, Y Offset, and Blur to .04 in. Select 
Preview to see the drop shadow applied to the 
text shapes. Click OK.
This applies a subtle drop shadow to the 
text shapes.

 Note:  When you 
apply a raster effect, 
the original vector 
data is rasterized 
using the document’s 
raster effects settings, 
which determine 
the resolution of the 
resulting image. To 
learn about document 
raster effects settings, 
search for “Document 
raster effects settings” 
in Illustrator Help.
	Note:  If you don’t 
see “Reset Essentials” in 
the workspace switcher 
menu, choose Essentials 
before choosing  
Reset Essentials.

Editing an effect
Effects are live, so they can be edited after they are applied to an object. You can 
edit the effect in the Appearance panel by selecting the object with the effect 
applied and then either clicking the name of the effect or double-clicking the 
attribute row in the Appearance panel. This displays the dialog box for that effect. 
Changes you make to the effect update in the artwork. In this section, you will edit 
the drop shadow effect applied to the cherries.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), click the 
grouped cherry shapes and make sure that 
the Appearance panel is showing. If it isn’t, 
choose Window > Appearance or click its 
panel icon (
).
Notice the drop shadow effect listed in the 
Appearance panel. The (
) icon to the right 
of an item listed in the panel indicates that it is an effect.
2 Click Drop Shadow in the Appearance panel. In the Drop Shadow dialog box, 
change Opacity to 60% and select Preview to see the change. Try different 
settings to see their effects (we set the Blur at .03 in), and then click OK.

Applying Effects
3 With the Selection tool, click the “Sparkling Soda” text shapes.
4 In the Appearance panel, click to the right or left of Drop Shadow to highlight 
the attribute row for the Drop Shadow effect, if it’s not already highlighted. 
After highlighting the attribute row, click the Delete Selected Item button (
) at 
the bottom of the panel.
5 With the Selection tool, click to select the cherries group again.
6 Choose Object > Ungroup.
Notice that the drop shadow is gone from the cherries. When an effect is 
applied to a group, it affects the group as a whole. If the objects are no longer 
grouped together, the effect no longer applies.
7 Choose Edit > Undo Ungroup, and the drop shadow reappears.
8 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Styling text with effects
You can make a warp from objects in your artwork, or you can use a preset warp 
shape or mesh object as an envelope, like you saw in Lesson 7, “Working With 
Type.” Next, you will use a Warp effect to warp the text at the bottom of the label.
1 With the Selection tool ( ) selected, select the “NET WT...” type at the bottom 
of the label.
2 Choose Effect > Warp > Arc Lower.
3 In the Warp Options dialog box, to create an arcing effect, set Bend to 35%. 
Select Preview to preview the changes. Try choosing other styles from the Style 
menu, and then return to Arc Lower. Try adjusting the Horizontal and Vertical 
Distortion sliders to see the effect. Make sure that the Distortion values are 
returned to 0, and then click OK.
	Note:  Be careful not 
to click the underlined 
words “Drop Shadow,” 
which will open the 
Drop Shadow dialog box.
 Note:  When you 
ungroup the cherries, 
you will still see the

2 Click the Add New Effect button (
) at the bottom of the Appearance panel. 
Choose Warp > Rise.
3 In the Warp Options dialog box, leave the Horizontal option selected and 
change the Bend to 20%. Select Preview to see the change, and then click OK.
Notice how the selected text shapes (in blue) still look like the original shapes 
but are actually warped. This shows how a live effect allows you to print the text 
shapes with the Rise effect applied but does not change the underlying object. 
Also, you can see that the Appearance panel lists the Warp: Rise effect that has 
been applied to the text shapes.
Next, you will hide the selection anchor points so that you can focus on the outcome.
4 With the “CHERRY BLAST” text shapes still selected, choose View > Hide Edges.
5 In the Control panel, change the Fill color 
to the swatch named Banner and leave the 
stroke at black, 1 pt.
6 Choose Edit > Copy, and then choose 
Object > Hide > Selection.
7 Choose Edit > Paste In Front.
8 With the copy selected, change the Fill color 
to the swatch named Scribble and the Stroke color to None in the Control panel.
Next, you will apply the Scribble effect to the text shapes.
9 With the text shapes selected, choose Effect > Stylize > Scribble.
10 In the Scribble Options dialog box, choose Tight from the Settings menu. Select 
Preview to see the change. Change the Angle to 10, and the Path Overlap 
to -3 pt, and leave the remainder of the settings as they are. Click OK.
After you make changes in the dialog box, the Settings menu will show Custom, 
rather than Tight.
 Note:  The Scribble 
effect in the figure may 
not look exactly like 
yours, and that’s okay.

Editing shapes with a Pathfinder effect
Pathfinder effects are similar to working with Pathfinder commands in
the Pathfinder panel, except they are applied as effects and do not change the 
underlying content.
Next, you will apply a Pathfinder effect to several shapes.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), Shift-click to 
select both the red banner shape behind the 
“SPARKLING SODA” text shapes and the 
oval in the background.
2 Choose Object > Group.
You grouped the objects together because 
Pathfinder effects may only be applied to 
groups, layers, or type objects.
3 Choose Effect > Pathfinder > Intersect to 
create a shape that shows where the two 
shapes intersect.
 Note:  If you see a warning dialog box when you 
choose Effect > Pathfinder > Intersect, it’s because you 
didn’t group the objects first.
Notice that the Intersect effect appears in the 
Appearance panel. Clicking Intersect allows you 
to change the Pathfinder effect and to edit the Intersect effect.
 Note:  To learn 
more about the 
Pathfinder commands, 
see the “Working with 
Pathfinder effects” 
section in Lesson 3, 
“Creating and Editing 
Shapes.”

LESSON 12 
Applying Effects
	Note:  You’ll learn more about the Appearance panel in Lesson 13, “Applying Appearance 
Attributes and Graphic Styles.”
4 With the group still selected, choose 
View > Outline.
The two shapes are still there and 
completely editable, since the effect being 
applied is live.
	Note:  To intersect shapes, you can also use the 
Pathfinder panel, which will expand the shapes 
immediately, by default. Using the Effect menu lets you 
edit shapes independently.
Next, you will copy the oval shape from the group of shapes that has the Pathfinder 
effect applied.
5 With the Selection tool, double-click directly on the edge of the oval shape to 
enter Isolation mode.
This allows you to edit just the two shapes that are part of the group.
	Note:  You are double-clicking the edge because shapes in Isolation mode have no fill, so they 
can’t be selected by clicking in the center.
6 Click the edge of the oval shape to select it. Choose Edit > Copy.
7 Press the Escape key to exit Isolation mode. Choose Select > Deselect.
8 Choose View > Preview, and then choose 
Edit > Paste In Front to paste a copy on top 
of the other objects. Leave the oval 
shape selected.
9 Choose File > Save.
Applying the Offset Path effect
Next, you will edit the oval shape by adding multiple strokes to it. You will then 
edit the multiple strokes by offsetting them against the oval shape. This process 
allows you to create the appearance of multiple stacked shapes.
1 With the oval shape selected, change the Stroke color to the swatch named 
Green, the Fill color to the gradient swatch named Center, and the stroke 
weight to 5 pt in the Control panel.
2 Click the word “Stroke” in the Control panel, and click the Align Stroke To 
Outside button (
) in the Stroke panel. Press the Escape key to hide the panel.

of the words “Stroke: 9 pt” to toggle it open. Notice 
that Offset Path is a subset of Stroke. This 
indicates that the Offset Path effect is applied to 
only that Stroke.
Now that the artwork is complete, you will scale it and 
then save it as a symbol in the Symbols panel. Then, you’ll apply it to a 3D soda can 
that you’ll create.

Applying Photoshop effects
As described earlier in the lesson, the effects in the bottom half of the Effect 
menu are Photoshop effects. You can apply them to either vector or bitmap 
objects. Photoshop effects are effects that generate pixels rather than vector data. 
Photoshop effects include SVG Filters, all of the effects in the bottom portion 
of the Effect menu, and the Drop Shadow, Inner Glow, Outer Glow, and Feather 
commands in the Effect > Stylize submenu.

13 In the Scale dialog box, change the Uniform 
Scale value to 60% and select Scale Strokes & 
Effects. Click OK.
	Note:  If you scale content and do not select Scale Strokes & 
Effects, the stroke weights and effects will stay the same when 
you scale the content.
Document raster effects settings
Whenever you apply a raster effect, 
Illustrator uses the document’s ras-
ter effects settings to determine the 
resolution of the resulting image. It’s 
important to check the document 
raster effects settings before you 
start working with effects.
You set rasterization options for 
a document when creating a new 
document or by choosing Effect > 
Document Raster Effects Settings. 
In the Document Raster Effects 
Settings dialog box, for all raster 
effects in a document or when you 
rasterize a vector object, you can 
set the Color Model, Resolution, 
Background, Anti-alias, Create 
Clipping Mask, and Add Around Object. To learn more about Document Raster 
Effects Settings, search for “About raster effects” in Help.

Working with a 3D effect
Using the Illustrator 3D effect, you can control the appearance of 3D objects with 
lighting, shading, rotation, and other attributes. In this part of the lesson, you’ll use 
two-dimensional shapes as the foundation for creating three-dimensional objects.
You can apply three types of 3D effects:
• 
Extrude & Bevel: Extends a 2D object along the 
object’s Z axis to add depth to the object. For 
example, if you extrude a 2D ellipse, it becomes 
a cylinder.
• 
Revolve: Sweeps a path or profile in a circular 
direction around the global Y axis (revolve axis) 
to create a 3D object.
• 
Rotate: Uses the Z axis to rotate 2D artwork in 
3D space and change the artwork’s perspective.
Below are examples of each type of 3D effect applied to an initial shape on the left.
Extrude & Bevel 3D effect	
Revolve 3D effect	
Rotate 3D effect
Creating a revolved object
In this part of the lesson, you will explore the 3D effect called Revolve. You will create 
a soda can from an existing path on the second artboard, using the Revolve effect.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
2 Click the Artboards panel icon (
) to expand the Artboards panel.
3 Double-click Artboard 2 in the panel (not the 
name) to fit the artboard in the Document window. 
Click the Artboards panel tab to collapse the panel.
4 Choose Select > All On Active Artboard.
The selected path is half of the shape of a soda can. 
When you apply the Revolve effect to it, it will be 
revolved around the right or left edge to create a 
360 degree shape, if that’s what you want.
5 Click the Stroke color in the Control panel, and choose None (
).

6 Click the Fill color in the Control panel, and select White.
7 Choose Effect > 3D > Revolve. In the 3D Revolve Options dialog box, choose 
Front from the Position menu. Select Preview to see the changes. You may need 
to reposition the 3D Revolve Options dialog box to see the artwork.
	Note:  Depending on the complexity of the shape being revolved and the speed of the computer 
you are working on, making changes in the 3D Revolve Options dialog box can take some time. It 
may be helpful to deselect Preview, make some changes, and then select Preview again. That way 
the shape does not have to “redraw” on the artboard every time a change is made in the dialog box.
8 Choose Right Edge from the Offset From menu. Click OK.
This is the edge that your arc revolves around. The result varies dramatically, 
depending on the side that you choose and whether you have a stroke or fill 
applied to the original object.
Choose which edge to revolve around.	
Left Edge.	
Right Edge.
9 Choose File > Save, and keep the file open.
3D Revolve options
In the 3D Options dialog box for the Revolve 3D effect, there are several other 
options worth mentioning:
• 
Angle: Sets the number of degrees to revolve the path, between 0 and 360. 
• 
Cap: Specifies whether the object appears solid (Turn Cap On For Solid 
Appearance) or hollow (Turn Cap Off For Hollow Appearance).
• 
Offset: Adds distance between the revolve axis and the path, to create a ring-
shaped object, for instance. You can enter a value between 0 and 1,000.
—From Illustrator Help
 Tip:  The Angle 
determines the degree 
of revolution. To create 
a “cut-away” look, you 
can change the degree 
to less than 360.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  367
Changing the lighting of a 3D object
The Revolve effect allows you to add one or more lights, vary the light intensity, 
change the object’s shading color, and move lights around the object.
In this section, you will change the strength and direction of the light source.
1 With the soda can shape selected, click the words “3D Revolve” in the 
Appearance panel.
If the Appearance panel is not visible, choose Window > Appearance. You may 
also need to scroll in the Appearance panel or resize it for easier viewing.
2 Select Preview in the 3D Revolve Options dialog box, and click More Options.
You can create custom lighting effects on your 3D object. Use the Preview window 
in the lower left of the 3D Revolve Options dialog box to reposition the lighting and 
to change the shade color.
3 Choose Plastic Shading from the Surface menu, if not already selected.
4 In the Preview window (the 
shaded sphere), drag the white 
square that represents the 
light source to the left. This 
changes the direction of the 
lighting. Click the New Light 
button (
) to add another 
light source to the soda can. 
Drag the second light source 
down and to the right.
Try positioning them in different arrangements, and move the dialog box out of 
the way to see the artwork.
5 Choose Custom from the Shading Color menu. Click the colored square to the 
right of the Shading Color menu to open the Color Picker. In the Color Picker, 
change the color to a medium gray (C=0, M=0, Y=0, K=50). Click OK to close 
the Color Picker, and return to the 3D Revolve Options dialog box.
6 In the 3D Revolve Options 
dialog box, change Light 
Intensity to 80% and the 
Ambient Light to 10%. Leave 
the dialog box open.
Ambient light controls the 
brightness uniformly on the 
surface of the 3D object.
 Note:  Depending 
on the speed of the 
computer you are 
working on, it may take 
some time to process 
changes made in the 
3D Revolve Options 
dialog box.

7 Change the Blend Steps to 40, and click OK when it is done processing.
8 Choose File > Save.
Surface shading options
In the 3D Options dialog box for Extrude & Bevel and Revolve, Surface lets you 
choose options for shading surfaces such as:
• 
Wireframe: Outlines the contours of the object’s geometry and makes each 
surface transparent.
• 
No Shading: Adds no new surface properties to the object. The 3D object has 
the same color as the original 2D object.
• 
Diffuse Shading: Makes the object reflect light in a soft, diffuse pattern.
• 
Plastic Shading: Makes the object reflect light as if it were made of a shiny, 
high-gloss material.
Note: Depending on what option you choose, different lighting options are available. 
If the object only uses the 3D Rotate effect, the only Surface choices available are Diffuse 
Shading or No Shading.
—From Illustrator Help
Mapping a symbol to the 3D artwork
You can map artwork to the surface of an object with a 3D effect applied. 
This artwork can come from Illustrator or from artwork imported from other 
applications, such as Photoshop. The artwork you map needs to be 2D artwork 
that’s stored in the Symbols panel. Symbols can be any Illustrator art object, 
including paths, compound paths, text, raster images, mesh objects, and groups of 
objects. In this part of the lesson, you will map the soda label that you previously 
saved as a symbol to the soda can.
1 With the soda can still selected, click 3D Revolve in the Appearance panel. Drag 
the 3D Revolve Options dialog box off to the side, so that you can see the soda 
can artwork. Make sure that Preview is also selected.
2 Click the Map Art button in the 3D Revolve Options dialog box.
When you map art to a 3D object, you first need to choose which surface to map 
the art to. Every 3D object is composed of multiple surfaces. For example, an 
extruded square becomes a cube that is made of six surfaces: the front and back 
faces and the four side faces. Next, you will choose which surface to map the 
artwork to.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  369
3 Drag the Map Art dialog box off to the side. Click the Next Surface button ( ) 
until “4 of 4” appears in the Surface field. In the artwork, notice that Illustrator 
is highlighting the wireframe and the selected surface in red.
4 Choose soda label from the Symbol menu. Select Preview, if not already selected.
 Note:  If you select the wrong surface, choose Clear and then map to another surface.
5 Deselect Preview in the Map Art dialog box to speed up the next few steps.
6 Drag the symbol into the light area of the map in the Map Art dialog box.
A light gray color marks surfaces that are currently visible. A dark gray color 
marks surfaces that are hidden by the object’s current position.
7 Select Shade Artwork (Slower). Select Preview to see the artwork with the 
symbol mapped to it. You may want to reposition or resize the artwork. Then, 
click OK to close the Map Art dialog box.
 Note:  You can work 
in the Map Art dialog 
box without selecting 
Preview, if you find  
that Preview slows your 
system down.
 Tip:  If you don’t like 
the position or size of 
the symbol artwork, 
you can click the Clear 
button at the bottom of 
the dialog box to clear 
the symbol artwork 
from the current surface.
 Tip:  You can interact 
with the symbol in 
the Map Art dialog 
box, using the normal 
bounding box controls 
to move, scale, or rotate 
the object.

370 
LESSON 12 
Applying Effects
8 In the 3D Revolve Options dialog box, click the Fewer Options button and then 
click the left edge of the blue square and drag to the right to spin the 3D object 
along the Y axis. With Preview selected, release the mouse button when you see 
a value of -11 in the Y axis field. Make sure that the X and Z values above and 
below the Y value are 0. Click OK.
The texture now wraps around the soda can. Next, you will edit the soda can color.
To map artwork to a 3D object
When mapping 3D objects, consider the following:
• 
Because the Map Art feature uses symbols for mapping, you can edit a symbol 
instance and then automatically update all surfaces that are mapped with it.
• 
You can interact with the symbol in the Map Art dialog box with normal 
bounding box controls to move, scale, or rotate the object.
• 
The 3D effect remembers each mapped surface on an object as a number. If you 
edit the 3D object or apply the same effect to a new object, there may be fewer 
or more sides than the original. If there are fewer surfaces than the number of 
surfaces defined for the original mapping, the extra artwork will be ignored.
• 
Because a symbol’s position is relative to the center of an object surface, if the 
geometry of the surface changes, the symbol will be remapped relative to the 
new center of the object.
• 
You can map artwork to objects that use the Extrude & Bevel or Revolve effect, 
but you can’t map artwork to objects that only use the Rotate effect.
—From Illustrator Help

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  371
9 With the Selection tool selected and the 3D object selected, change the Fill color 
to the swatch named Background in the Control panel.
Notice that the entire shape changes color, except where the symbol artwork is 
mapped to the surface. At this point, if necessary, you can edit the shape that 
you started with. If you need to rotate the 3D object, in this situation it’s best 
done in the 3D Revolve Options dialog box.
 Tip:  If you need to edit the shape, it is recommended that you first deselect the visibility column
of the 3D Revolve (Mapped) effect in the Appearance panel. Then, when you are finished editing the 
shape, click the visibility column to show the 3D Revolve (Mapped) effect again.
 
10 Choose View > Show Edges to show the 
edges for later lessons.

File > Close.
Printing resources
To make optimum decisions about printing, you should understand basic printing 
principles, including how the resolution of your printer or the calibration and 
resolution of your monitor can affect the way your artwork appears when printed. 
Illustrator’s Print dialog box is designed to help you through the printing process. 
For information on working in the print dialog box, see “Print dialog box options” in 
Illustrator Help.

LESSON 12 
Applying Effects
Review questions
1 Name two ways to apply an effect to an object.
2 Where can the effects applied to an object be edited, once they are applied?
3 What three types of 3D effects are available? Give an example of why you would use 
each one.
4 How can you control lighting on a 3D object? Does the lighting of one 3D object affect 
other 3D objects?
5 What are the generic steps to map artwork to an object?
Review answers
1 You can apply an effect to an object by selecting the object and then choosing the effect 
from the Effect menu. You can also apply an effect by selecting the object, clicking the 
Add New Effect button (
) in the Appearance panel, and then choosing the effect 
from the menu that appears.
2 You can edit effects in the Appearance panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  373
3 The types of 3D effects are Extrude & Bevel, Revolve, and Rotate.
• 
Extrude & Bevel: Uses the Z axis to give a 2D object depth by extruding the object. 
For example, a circle becomes a cylinder.
• 
Revolve: Uses the Y axis to revolve an object around an axis. For example, an arc 
becomes a circle.
• 
Rotate: Uses the Z axis to rotate 2D artwork in 3D space and to change the 
artwork’s perspective.
4 By clicking the More Options button in any of the 3D dialog boxes, you can change 
the light, the direction of the light, and the shade color. Settings for the light of one 
3D object do not affect the settings for other 3D objects.
5 Map artwork to an object by following these steps:
a Select the artwork to be used as a symbol, and save it as a symbol in the Symbols panel.
b Select the object, and choose Effect > 3D > Extrude & Bevel or Effect > 3D > Revolve.
c 
Click Map Art.
d Navigate to the surface by clicking the Next Surface or Previous Surface buttons. 
Select the symbol from the Symbol menu. Close both dialog boxes.

APPLYING APPEARANCE 
ATTRIBUTES AND 
GRAPHIC STYLES
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following: 
• Create and edit an appearance attribute.
• Add a second stroke to an object.
• Reorder appearance attributes and apply them to layers.
• Copy, turn on and off, and remove appearance attributes.
• Save an appearance as a graphic style.
• Apply a graphic style to an object and a layer.
• Apply multiple graphic styles to an object or layer.
• Align content to the pixel grid.
• Work with the Slice and Slice Selection tools.
• Use the Save For Web command.
This lesson takes approximately an hour to complete. If needed, remove 
the previous lesson folder from your hard disk and copy the Lesson13 
folder onto it.

375
Without changing the structure of an object, you 
can change its look using appearance attributes, 
including fills, strokes, effects, transparency, and 
blending modes. You can save appearance attributes 
as graphic styles and apply them to another object. 
You can also edit an object that has a graphic style 
applied to it and then edit the graphic style—an 
enormous time-saver!

Using appearance attributes
You can apply appearance attributes to any object, group, or layer by using effects, 
the Appearance panel, and the Graphic Styles panel. An appearance attribute is 
an aesthetic property—such as a fill, stroke, transparency, or effect—that affects 
the look of an object but does not affect its basic structure. An advantage of using 
appearance attributes is that they can be changed or removed at any time without 
changing the underlying object or any other attributes applied to the object in the 
Appearance panel (Window > Appearance).
1 Click the Appearance panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to 
expand the Appearance panel.
2 Select the Selection tool, and click to select the large, yellow number 5 next 
to the duck.
The different options available in the Appearance panel are described below:
If you apply the Drop Shadow effect to an object, in the Appearance panel you can 
turn off the Drop Shadow effect, duplicate it, edit it, delete it, and more. You can 
also copy that effect and apply it to other shapes, groups, or layers. You can even 
save it as a graphic style and use it for other objects or files.
Editing and adding appearance attributes
You’ll start by changing the basic appearance of the selected number 5, using the 
Appearance panel.
1 With the yellow number 5 still selected and with 
the Appearance panel showing, select the Fill 
attribute row by clicking to the right or left of 
the yellow Fill color box.
Selecting an attribute row lets you change the 
properties of only that attribute in the 
selected artwork.

Reordering appearance attributes
The ordering of the appearance attribute rows can greatly change how your artwork 
looks. In the Appearance panel, fills and strokes are listed in stacking order; top 
to bottom in the panel correlates to front to back in the artwork. You can reorder 
attribute rows in a way similar to dragging layers in the Layers panel, to rearrange 
the stacking order. Now, you’ll change the appearance of the artwork by reordering 
attributes in the Appearance panel.
1 Resize the Appearance panel so that you can view all its contents. Click the 
triangle ( ) to the left of all of the appearance rows to hide their properties.
2 Drag the new Fill attribute row (with the Duck 
pattern swatch applied) below the original Fill 
attribute row.
Moving the new Fill attribute below the original 
Fill attribute changes the look of the artwork. The 
original yellow/orange gradient fill is now covering 
the new fill.
	Note:  The 
thumbnail you see 
in the transparency 
options may look 
different, depending on 
your operating system.

LESSON 13 
Applying Appearance Attributes and Graphic Styles
3 Choose Edit > Undo Move Appearance Item so that the new Fill row is once 
again between the stroke and original Fill rows in the Appearance panel.
Applying an appearance to a layer
You can also apply simple appearance attributes to layers. For example, to make 
everything on a layer 50% opaque, target that layer and change the opacity.
Next, you’ll target a layer and add a drop shadow.
1 Click the Layers panel icon (
) to open the panel. In the Layers panel, click the 
triangle to the left of the Buttons layer to view its content, if necessary.
2 Click the target icon (

3 Open the Appearance panel, and notice that it says Layer at the top. This 
indicates that any attributes applied will be applied to all content on that layer. 
When you select items that contain other items, such as a layer or group, the 
Appearance panel displays a Contents item, which you can double-click to edit.
4 Click the Add New Effect button (
) at the bottom of the Appearance panel, 
and choose Stylize > Drop Shadow.
5 In the Drop Shadow dialog box, change the Opacity to 25%, the X Offset 
to -2 px, the Y Offset to 2 px, and the Blur to 2 px. Click OK.
6 Click the Layers panel icon (
), and notice that the target icon now has a shaded 
center (
), indicating that the layer has appearance attributes applied to it.
7 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.
	Note:  The layer 
colors you see may be 
different, depending on 
your operating system, 
and that’s okay.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  383
Using graphic styles
A graphic style is a saved set of appearance attributes that you can reuse. By 
applying graphic styles, you can quickly and globally change the appearance of 
objects and text.
The Graphic Styles panel (Window > Graphic Styles) lets you create, name, save, 
apply, and remove effects and attributes for objects, layers, and groups. You can 
also break the link between an object and an applied graphic style to edit that 
object’s attributes without affecting other objects that use the same graphic style.
For example, if you have a map that uses a shape to represent a city, you can create 
a graphic style that paints the shape green and adds a drop shadow. You can then 
use that graphic style to paint all the city shapes on the map. If you decide to use 
a different color, you can change the fill color of the graphic style to blue. All the 
objects that use that graphic style are then updated to blue.
Creating and saving a graphic style
Now, you’ll save and name a new graphic style using the appearance attributes you 
just specified for the shirt shape below the “Clothing” text. You will then apply the 
same appearance attributes to the other button shapes.
1 Choose Reset Essentials from the workspace switcher in the Application bar.
2 Click the Graphic Styles panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to 
open the Graphic Styles panel.
3 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select 
the shirt shape beneath the “Clothing” text.
	Note:  Depending on your operating system, the 
bounding box and edges (the yellow outlines in the 
figure) of some selected objects may be a different color, 
and that’s okay.
 Tip:  To create a 
graphic style, you can 
also click to select the 
object that you are 
making the graphic 
style from. In the 
Appearance panel, 
drag the appearance 
thumbnail at the top 
of the listing into the 
Graphic Styles panel.

Replacing graphic style attributes
Once you create a graphic style, you can still edit the object that the style is applied 
to. You can also update a graphic style, and all artwork with that style applied will 
update their appearance as well.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the shirt shape again. In the Graphic 
Styles panel, you will see that the Icons graphic style thumbnail is highlighted 
(has a border around it), indicating that it is applied.
2 Click the Appearance panel tab. Change the stroke color of the orange stroke 
to white. Click the Graphic Styles panel tab to see that the graphic style is no 
longer highlighted, which means that the graphic style is no longer applied.
3 Press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, and drag the shirt shape on 
top of the Icons graphic style thumbnail in the Graphic Styles panel. Release the 
mouse button and then the modifier key when the thumbnail is highlighted.
4 Choose Select > Deselect.

Applying Appearance Attributes and Graphic Styles
2 Click the Clear Appearance button (
) at the bottom of the Appearance panel. 
Select the No Selection appearance name or thumbnail at the top of the panel.
The Clear Appearance button removes all appearance attributes applied to an 
object, including any stroke or fill. By clicking the Clear Appearance button with 
nothing selected, you are setting the default appearance for new shapes.
3 Click the Add New Effect button (
), and choose Stylize > Drop Shadow.
4 In the Drop Shadow dialog box, change the Opacity to 100%, the X Offset 
to -2 px, the Y Offset to 2 px, and the Blur to 2 px. Leave the rest of the settings 
at default, and click OK. In the Appearance panel, notice that Drop Shadow 
appears in the list. You may need to scroll in the Appearance panel to see it listed.
A new graphic style is created from the current appearance attributes displayed 
in the Appearance panel, if nothing is selected in the Document window.
5 Click the Graphic Styles panel tab. Alt-click 
(Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) the 
New Graphic Style button (
), and name the 
new style Icons shadow in the Graphic Style 
Options dialog box. Click OK.
Pressing the modifier key opens the dialog box 
when you click. The graphic style thumbnail 
shows a box with a slash on the lower-left corner of the thumbnail. This 
indicates that the graphic style has no stroke and no fill.
Now, you’ll target the bases sublayer to apply a drop shadow to all the shapes on 
that layer. Targeting selects the path(s) on that layer in the artwork.
6 Click the Layers panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to open the 
Layers panel.
7 In the Layers panel, click the triangle ( ) to the left of the Buttons layer to

If you apply multiple graphic styles to an object, the latest graphic style 
overwrites the previous. If you apply a graphic style to artwork and then apply a 
graphic style to the layer (or sublayer) that it’s on, the graphic style formatting is 
added together and is cumulative.
Notice that the shape above the text “Registry” does not have the drop shadow 
applied. That’s because that shape is not on the bases sublayer.
9 Click the Layers panel icon (
), and drag the 
<Path> object at the top of the Buttons layer 
on top of the bases sublayer to add it to that 
sublayer and to apply the Icons shadow graphic 
style to the Registry shape.
10 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Editing a graphic style applied to a layer
Next, you will edit the drop shadow applied to the layer.
1 Click the Appearance panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to open 
the Appearance panel.
2 With the Selection tool, click to select the shirt shape beneath the “Clothing” text.
In the Appearance panel, notice the name 
Layer: Icons shadow at the top of the panel. The 
Appearance panel shows that the shirt shape is on 
a layer with a graphic style called Icons shadow 
applied to it.
3 Click the words Layer: Icons shadow to access 
the Drop Shadow effect applied to the layer. 
This also selects all of the shapes on the layer.

Applying an existing graphic style
You can also apply graphic styles to your artwork from graphic style libraries that 
come with Illustrator CS6. Now, you’ll add graphic styles to a button in the design.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
Now, you’ll apply an existing graphic style to the Go button that is located off the 
upper-right corner of the artboard.
2 Click the Graphic Styles panel tab. Click the 
Graphic Styles Libraries Menu button (

choose Illuminate Styles. Scroll down in the 
Illuminate Styles panel, and click the Illuminate 
Yellow graphic style. Clicking that style adds it to 
the Graphic Styles panel for the document.
3 At the bottom of the Illuminate Styles panel, click 
the Graphic Styles Libraries Menu button (
) 
and choose Additive. In the Additive panel, click 
the Round Corners 10 pt graphic style thumbnail 
to add it to the Graphic Styles panel as well. 
Close the Additive panel.
4 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the white rectangle off the upper-
right corner of the artboard (to the right of the Search field). Be careful not to 
select the white text “Go” that is on top of it.
5 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS), and hold down the mouse 
button on the Illuminate Yellow style thumbnail in the Graphic Styles panel to 
preview the graphic style on the shape. Release the mouse button (and then the 
Control key on Mac OS) when finished.
Previewing a graphic style is a great way to see how the graphic style will affect 
the selected object, without actually applying it.
6 Click the Illuminate Yellow graphic style in the Graphic Styles panel to apply it 
to the shape. Click the Graphic Styles panel tab to collapse the panel group.
 Tip:  Use the arrows 
at the bottom of 
the Illuminate Styles

helpful indicator that the topmost fill/stroke is not active.
Applying multiple graphic styles
You can apply a graphic style to an object that already has a graphic style applied. 
This can be useful if you want to add properties to an object from another 
graphic style.
1 With the rectangle behind the text “Go” still selected, click the Style menu in 
the Control panel. In the Graphic Styles panel that appears, click to apply the 
Round Corners 10 pt graphic style to the Go button shape.

the formatting on selected objects, by default.
2 Choose Edit > Undo Graphic Styles.
3 Click the Style menu in the Control panel again, and Alt-click (Windows) or 
Option-click (Mac OS) the Round Corners 10 pt graphic style.
Notice that, on the Go button, the fills and stroke are preserved and that the 
corners are rounded as well (you may need to zoom in). Alt-clicking (Windows) 
or Option-clicking (Mac OS) adds the graphic style formatting to the existing 
formatting, rather than replacing it.

6 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
Copying and removing graphic styles
When you create several graphic styles and appearances, you may want to use 
them on other objects in your artwork. You can use the Graphic Styles panel, the 
Appearance panel, the Eyedropper tool, or the Live Paint Bucket tool to apply and 
copy appearance attributes. Now, you’ll use the Layers panel to copy an attribute 
from one layer to another.
1 Expand the Layers panel to see all the layers. With the triangle to the left of the 
Buttons layer expanded, Alt-drag (Windows) or Option-drag (Mac OS) the target 
icon (
) from the bases sublayer onto the target icon of the text sublayer above it.
Using the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key as you drag, copies 
appearance attributes from one layer to another. The shaded target icon (
) 
indicates that the layer contains appearance attributes. To move, not copy, an 
appearance or style from one layer or object to another, drag the target icon. 
The text now has the same subtle drop shadow applied.
Now, you’ll remove the appearance attributes from that layer, using the Layers panel.
2 In the Layers panel, click the target icon to the right of the text sublayer.
3 Drag the target icon to the Trash button (
) at the bottom of the Layers panel 
to remove the appearance attribute. Click the Layers panel tab to collapse it.

LESSON 13 
Applying Appearance Attributes and Graphic Styles
You can also remove attributes of a selected object or layer in the Appearance 
panel. To do this, select the object and then choose Reduce To Basic 
Appearance from the panel menu. This removes all appearance attributes 
except a single fill and stroke.
4 Choose Select > Deselect, and then File > Save.
Creating web graphics
Creating content for the web requires that vector content be converted to raster 
content. You can do this using the Save For Web command. Images can be saved in 
a multitude of file formats, such as GIF, JPEG, and PNG. GIF, JPEG, and PNG are 
optimized for use on the web and are compatible with most browsers, yet they each 
have different capabilities. The key to the effective use of images on a website is finding 
the balance of resolution, size, and color to achieve optimal quality.
	Note:  This section is meant as an introduction to the main tools and processes for saving web 
content from Illustrator and is not a comprehensive guide. To learn more about working with web 
graphics, search for “File formats for exporting artwork“ in Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
Aligning content to the pixel grid
It is critical that raster images look sharp, especially standard web graphics at 
72-ppi (pixels per inch) resolution. To enable web designers to create pixel-
accurate designs, you can align artwork to the pixel grid. The pixel grid is a grid of 
72 squares per inch, vertically and horizontally, that is viewable when you zoom to 
600% or higher when Pixel Preview mode is enabled (View > Pixel Preview).
When the pixel-aligned property is enabled for an object, all the horizontal and 
vertical segments in the object get aligned to the pixel grid, which provides a crisp 
appearance to strokes. When you create a new document, you can set the Align 
New Objects To Pixel Grid option at the document level by choosing Web from the 
Profile menu in the New Document dialog box. This makes all artwork (that is able 
to be aligned to the pixel grid) align to the pixel grid automatically. You can also 
align content to the pixel grid later, as you will do in this section.
1 With the webstore.ai file still 
open, choose File > New. In 
the New Document dialog box, 
choose Web from the Profile 
menu. Click the triangle to the 
left of the Advanced content, 
toward the bottom of the 
dialog box.
	Note:  To learn more 
about what the term 
raster means, see the 
section “Vector versus 
bitmap graphics” in 
Lesson 15, “Combining 
Illustrator CS6  
Graphics with Other 
Adobe Applications.”

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  393
In the Advanced settings, you can see that the Color Mode is RGB for all 
artwork you create, the Raster Effects are 72 ppi, and Align New Objects To 
Pixel Grid is selected.
2 Click Cancel.
3 In the webstore.ai file, choose File > Document Color Mode and you will see 
that RGB is selected.
After you create a document, you can change the document color mode. This 
sets the default color mode for all new colors you create.
4 Select the Zoom tool (
), and drag a marquee around the text shapes “Little” to 
the right of the duck in the header, to zoom in closely. This is text that has been 
converted to outlines (paths).
5 Choose View > Pixel Preview to preview a rasterized version of the design and 
the pixel grid.
The artwork in Preview mode	
The artwork in Pixel Preview mode
By zooming in to at least 600%, and with Pixel Preview turned on, you can see 
a pixel grid appear, as in the figure. The pixel grid divides the artboard into 
1‑point (1/72 inch) increments.
6 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the group of text shapes that begins 
with “Little.”
7 Click the word “Transform” 
(or X, Y, W, or H) in the 
Control panel, and select 
Align To Pixel Grid at the 
bottom of the Transform 
panel. Deselect and select 
Align To Pixel Grid to see the 
change on the edge of the 
text shapes.
8 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
9 Choose Select > Object > Not Aligned To Pixel Grid to select all artwork in the 
document that is able to be, but is not currently, aligned to the pixel grid.
10 Click the word “Transform” in the Control panel, and select Align To Pixel 
Grid. Leave the Transform panel showing.
 Tip:  You can turn 
off the pixel grid 
by choosing Edit > 
Preferences > Guides 
& Grid (Windows) or 
Illustrator > Preferences > 
Guides & Grid (Mac OS) 
and deselecting Show 
Pixel Grid (Above 600% 
Zoom).
	Note:  Objects that 
are pixel-aligned, but 
do not have any straight 
vertical or horizontal 
segments, are not 
modified to align to the 
pixel grid. For example, 
because a rotated 
rectangle does not 
have straight vertical or 
horizontal segments, 
it is not nudged to 
produce crisp paths 
when the pixel-aligned 
property is set for it.

394 
LESSON 13 
Applying Appearance Attributes and Graphic Styles
11 Choose Align New Objects To Pixel Grid from the Transform panel menu (
). 
Press the Escape key to hide the Transform panel.
This sets all new artwork to be aligned to the pixel grid automatically. Once again, if you 
had chosen the Web Profile when creating a document, this would be set already.
12 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.
Text anti-aliasing
The Character panel in Illustrator provides the 
following text anti-aliasing options: None, Sharp, 
Crisp, and Strong. You can set anti-aliasing options for 
each text frame. These text anti-aliasing attributes get 
saved as part of the document.
While exporting to web formats like JPEG and GIF 
using the File > Save For Web command, the following 
options are available in the anti-aliasing drop-down 
list: None, Art Optimized, and Type Optimized.
• 
Art Optimized option produces raster for each 
of these formats in the same way as in earlier 
versions. However, text anti-aliasing options are 
not honored while rasterizing the artwork in this case.
• 
Type Optimized option honors the newly introduced anti-aliasing options for 
the text frames in the raster produced.
—From Illustrator Help
Slicing content
If you create artwork on an artboard and choose File > Save For Web, Illustrator 
creates a single image file the size of the artboard. You can create multiple 
artboards for artwork that each contain a piece of the web page, like a button, and 
save each artboard as a separate image file. 
You can also design your artwork on an artboard and slice the content. In 
Illustrator, you can create slices to define the boundaries of different web elements 
in your artwork. For example, if you design an entire web page on an artboard 
and there is a vector shape that you want to save as a button for your website, that 
artwork can be optimized in GIF format, while the rest of the image is optimized as 
a JPEG file. You can isolate the button image by creating a slice. When you save the 
artwork as a web page using the Save For Web command, you can choose to save 
each slice as an independent file with its own format and settings.
Next, you will create a new layer that will contain the slices and then you will create 
slices for different parts of the artwork.
	Note:  To learn more 
about creating slices, 
search for “Create slices“ 
in Adobe Illustrator 
Help (Help >  
Illustrator Help).

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  395
1 Click the Layers panel icon (
) to open the 
Layers panel. Click to select the Top nav layer. 
Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) 
the Create New Layer button (
) at the bottom 
of the Layers panel. In the Layer Options dialog 
box, change the name of the layer to Slices and 
click OK. Make sure that the new layer named 
Slices is selected.
When you create slices, they are listed in the 
Layers panel and can be selected, deleted, 
resized, and more. It helps to keep them on their own layer so that you can 
more easily manage them, but this isn’t necessary.
2 Select the Slice tool (
) in the Tools panel. Click and drag a slice around the 
duck, the number 5, and the text “Little Duckies.” Don’t worry about it fitting 
perfectly right now; you will edit it later.
When you create a slice, Illustrator slices the surrounding artwork into 
automatic slices to maintain the layout of the page. Auto slices account for the 
areas of your artwork that you did not define as a slice. Illustrator regenerates 
auto slices every time you add or edit your own slices. Also, notice the 
number 3 in the corner of the slice you created. Illustrator numbers slices from 
left to right and top to bottom, beginning in the upper-left corner of the artwork.
Next, you will create a slice based on selected content.
3 Select the Selection tool ( ) and click the Go button group in the upper-right 
corner of the artboard. You may want to zoom in.
4 Select the Slices layer in the Layers panel to place the new slice on that layer.
5 Choose Object > Slice > Create 
From Selection.
Illustrator can create slices based on 
guides you create or on content that 
you select in the Document window.
	Note:  To learn 
more about creating 
layers, see the section 
“Creating layers” in 
Lesson 8, “Working  
With Layers.” The new 
layer you create may 
have a different layer 
color and that’s okay.
 Tip:  Use the 
Object > Slice > 
Make command 
when you want the 
slice dimensions to 
match the boundary 
of an element in your 
artwork. If you move or 
modify the element, the 
slice area automatically 
adjusts to encompass 
the new artwork.

396 
LESSON 13 
Applying Appearance Attributes and Graphic Styles
Selecting and editing slices
Editing user slices is necessary, for instance, when sliced content changes or when 
what is included in the slice needs to change.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Select the Slice Selection tool (
) from the Slice tool group in the Tools panel 
by clicking and holding down on the Slice tool (
).
3 Click in the center of the first slice you created over the “5 Little Duckies” text. 
The selected slice is highlighted, and four corner bounding points appear.
The Slice Selection tool allows you to edit slices you’ve created using the different 
methods. You can also select a user slice with the Selection or Direct Selection 
tools by clicking the stroke (edge) of the slice or from within the Layers panel.
4 Position the pointer over the left edge of the selected slice. When a double arrow 
appears, click and drag to the left until it snaps to the left edge of the artboard.
5 Position the pointer over the lower-right bounding point of the selected slice, and 
click and drag the slice to tighten it around the “5 Little Duckies” text, if necessary.
When slicing content, you should contain all appearance attributes, like drop 
shadows, in the slice area. This can be difficult if the shadow is blurred quite a bit. 
Using the Object > Slice > Create From Selection command will create a slice that 
surrounds all appearance properties, like effects, if those effects are applied directly 
to the artwork and not to the layer the artwork is on. Using the Slice Selection tool, 
you can click and drag a slice, copy and paste it, delete it, and much more.
6 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose View > Lock Slices so that you 
cannot select them. Choose File > Save.
Using the Save For Web command
After having sliced your artwork, if necessary, you can then optimize that artwork 
for use on the web. You can use the File > Save For Web command to select 
optimization options and to preview optimized artwork. This is the last step in the 
process of creating content for the web.
1 Choose View > Hide Slices.
	Note:  To learn more 
about editing slices, 
search for “Create slices“ 
in Adobe Help (Help > 
Illustrator Help).

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  397
While working on your artwork, you don’t have to have the slices showing. This 
can make it so that you can concentrate on selecting artwork without selecting 
slices. You can also hide the layer that the slices are on if you created a layer for 
them in the Layers panel.
2 Select the Selection tool ( ), and Shift-click the duck, the number 5, the “Little 
Duckies” text, and the Go button in the upper-right corner.
3 Choose Object > Hide > Other Layers.
When you save the sliced content using the Save For Web command, all 
content that is showing in a slice will be flattened into a raster image. If you 
want to have transparency in the selected artwork (part of the image will be see-
through), you need to first hide what you don’t want to save. The areas where 
you see the artboard in a slice can be transparent, depending on the type of 
image you choose.
4 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.
5 Choose View > Show Slices, and ensure that the artwork and drop shadows are 
contained within the slice. If not, you can resize either slice.
6 Choose File > Save For Web.
7 In the Save For Web dialog box, click the 2-Up tab at the top of the dialog box 
to select that display option, if it’s not already selected.
This shows a split window with the original artwork on the left and the 
optimized artwork on the right.
8 With the Slice Selection tool (
) selected, click in the optimized area on the 
right. Click to select the slice that covers the duck and text artwork, if it isn’t 
selected already. You can tell when a slice is selected because of the light brown 
border around it.
9 In the Preset area on the right side of the dialog box, choose PNG-24 from the 
Optimized File Format menu (below Name).
	Note:  To resize the 
slices, you would need 
to make sure that they 
are unlocked. Choose 
View > Lock Slices (if  a 
checkmark appears to 
the left of the menu 
item, they are locked).

398 
LESSON 13 
Applying Appearance Attributes and Graphic Styles
You can choose from four file formats, including GIF, JPEG, PNG-8, and 
PNG-24, as well as set the options for each in the Preset area. The available 
options change depending on the file format you select. If your image contains 
multiple slices that you are going to save, be sure to select each separately and 
to optimize all the slices.
10 Choose Selected Slices from the Export menu.
Any slices that you select in the Save For Web dialog box will be exported. You 
can select multiple slices, after you’ve assigned optimization settings to them, 
by Shift-clicking the desired slices. By choosing All User Slices from the Export 
menu, all slices that you created will be exported.
11 Click the Preview button in the lower-left corner of the dialog box to launch the 
default web browser on your computer and to preview the sliced content. After 
viewing the content, close the browser and return to Illustrator.
12 In the Save For Web dialog box, click Save.
13 In the Save Optimized As 
dialog box, navigate to 
the Lesson13 folder in the 
Lessons folder and open it. 
Change the name to logo, 
and click Save.
14 Navigate to your Lesson13 
folder, and open the images 
folder that Illustrator 
generated. In that folder, you 
will see the single image that 
is named according to the name entered in the Save Optimized dialog box, with 
the slice number appended to the end.
 Tip:  When you select slices in the Save For Web dialog box and set optimization settings, they 
are saved with the slices in the file. That means, if you need to make a change to artwork and save 
that slice again, you can simply select the slice with the Slice Selection tool and choose File > Save 
Selected Slices. The saved optimization settings are applied to the artwork, and it is saved where 
you determine.
15 Return to Illustrator, and open the Layers panel. 
Choose Show All Layers from the panel menu (
) to 
reveal blue icons on the white shapes.
16 Choose File > Save and then File > Close.
	Note:  If nothing 
happens after clicking 
the Preview button, try 
clicking again. You may 
also need to click the 
Select Browser Menu 
button to the right of 
the Preview button and 
choose Edit List to add a

Review answers
1 Click the Add New Stroke button in the Appearance panel, or choose Add New Stroke 
from the Appearance panel menu. A stroke is added to the top of the appearance list. 
It has the same color and stroke weight as the original stroke.
2 After a graphic style is applied to a layer, everything you add to that layer has that style 
applied to it. For example, if you create a circle on Layer 1 and then move that circle to 
Layer 2, which has a Drop Shadow effect applied, the circle adopts that effect.
When a style is applied to a single object, other objects on that layer are not affected. 
For example, if a triangle object has a Roughen effect applied to its path and you move 
it to another layer, it retains the Roughen effect.
3 With a graphic style applied to an object, Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click
(Mac OS) another graphic style in the Graphic Styles panel.
4 In the Layers panel, click the target icon of a layer. Drag the target icon to the Delete 
Selection button in the Layers panel to remove the appearance attribute. You can also 
remove the appearance attribute of a selected object or layer using the Appearance 
panel. Select the object, and choose Reduce To Basic Appearance from the Appearance 
panel menu to return the object to its original state.
5 When the pixel-aligned property is enabled for an object, all the horizontal and vertical 
segments in the object get aligned to the pixel grid, which provides a crisp appearance 
to strokes.
6 The three image file types that can be chosen in the Save For Web dialog box are: 
JPEG, GIF, and PNG. PNG has two versions: PNG-8 and PNG-24.

WORKING WITH SYMBOLS
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Work with existing symbols.
• Create a symbol.
• Modify and redefine a symbol.
• Use the Symbolism tools.
• Store and retrieve artwork in the Symbols panel.
• Work with symbols and Adobe Flash®.
This lesson takes approximately an hour to complete. If needed, remove 
the previous lesson folder from your hard disk and copy the Lesson14 
folder onto it.

401
The Symbols panel lets you apply multiple objects 
by painting them on the page. Symbols used in 
combination with the Symbolism tools offer options 
that make creating repetitive shapes, such as blades 
of grass, easy and fun. You can also use the Symbols 
panel as a database to store artwork and to map 
symbols to 3D objects.

LESSON 14  Working with Symbols
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll add symbols to a map. Before you begin, restore the default 
preferences for Adobe Illustrator. Then, open the file containing the finished 
artwork to see what you are going to create.
1 To ensure that the tools and panels function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CS6 preferences file. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 3.
2 Start Adobe Illustrator CS6.
	Note:  If you have not already done so, copy the Lesson14 folder from the Lessons folder on the 
Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book CD onto your hard disk. See “Copying the Classroom in a 
Book files” on page 2.
3 Choose File > Open, and open the 
L14end.ai file in the Lesson14 folder in 
the Lessons folder on your hard disk.
If you want to view the finished map as 
you work, choose View > Zoom Out and 
adjust the window size. Use the Hand 
tool (
) to move the artwork where you 
want it in the window. If you don’t want to leave the image open, choose 
File > Close.
To begin working, you’ll open an existing art file.
4 Choose File > Open to open the 
L14start.ai file in the Lesson14 folder, 
located in the Lessons folder on your 
hard disk.
5 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As 
dialog box, name the file map.ai and 
navigate to the Lesson14 folder. Leave 
the Save As Type option set to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows) or the 
Format option set to Adobe Illustrator (ai) (Mac OS), and click Save. In the 
Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the Illustrator options at their default 
settings and then click OK.
6 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
	Note:  If you don’t see “Reset Essentials” in the Workspace menu, choose Window > Workspace > 
Essentials before choosing Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.

Working with symbols
A symbol is a reusable art object that is stored in the Symbols panel (Window > 
Symbols). For example, if you create a symbol from a fish you drew, you can then 
quickly add multiple instances of that fish symbol to your artwork, which saves 
you from having to draw each fish again. All instances of the fish symbol are linked 
to the associated symbol in the Symbols panel, so you can easily alter them using 
Symbolism tools.
When you edit the original symbol, all instances of the fish that are linked to it are 
updated. You can turn that fish from blue to green instantly! Not only do symbols 
save time, but they also greatly reduce file size. They can also be used to create SWF 
files or artwork for Adobe Flash.
• Click the Symbols panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace. Take a 
minute to familiarize yourself with the parts of the Symbols panel.
Illustrator comes with a series of symbol libraries, which range from tiki icons 
to hair and fur. You can access the symbol libraries in the Symbols panel or by 
choosing Window > Symbol Libraries.
Using existing Illustrator symbol libraries
You will start by adding a symbol from an existing symbol library to the artwork.
1 Choose View > Smart Guides to deselect Smart Guides.
2 Click the Layers panel icon (
) on the right 
side of the workspace to expand the Layers 
panel. Click the Symbols layer to make sure it 
is selected. Make sure that all of the layers are 
collapsed by clicking the triangles to the left 
of the layer names.
When adding symbols to a document, which 
layer is selected when they are added is the 
layer they become a part of.
3 Click the Symbols panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to expand 
the panel.

LESSON 14  Working with Symbols
4 In the Symbols panel, click the Symbol 
Libraries Menu button (
) at the bottom of 
the panel and choose Maps. The Maps library 
opens as a free-floating panel.
This library is external to the file that you are 
working on, but you can import any of the 
symbols into the document and use them in the artwork.
5 Position the pointer over the symbols in the 
Maps panel to see their names as tool tips. 
Click the Rest Area symbol to add it to the 
Symbols panel for the document. Close the 
Maps panel.
Every document has a default set of symbols 
in the Symbols panel. When you add symbols to the panel, as you just did, they 
are saved with the active document only.
6 Using the Selection tool ( ), drag the Rest Area symbol from the Symbols panel 
into the UNION PARK area (smaller green area) on the artboard. Drag 
another into the CENTRAL PARK (larger green area) on the artboard, and leave 
it selected.
Each time you drag a symbol onto the artboard, an instance of the Rest Area 
symbol is created. Next, you will resize one of the symbol instances on the page.
 Tip:  You can also copy a symbol instance on the artboard and paste as many as you need. This is 
the same as dragging a symbol instance out of the Symbols panel onto the artboard.
7 Using the Selection tool and holding down the Shift key, drag the upper-right 
corner of the Rest Area symbol instance in the CENTRAL PARK area, up and 
to the right, to make it a little larger, while constraining its proportions. Release 
the mouse button and then the modifier key.
 Note:  The pointer that you see when dragging a symbol from the Symbols panel into the 
Document window may look different, and that’s okay.
 Tip:  If you want to 
see the symbol names 
rather than the symbol 
pictures, choose Small 
List View or Large List 
View from the Symbols 
panel menu (
).
 Note:  Although you 
can transform symbol 
instances in many ways, 
specific properties of 
instances cannot be 
edited. For example, 
the fill color is locked 
because it is controlled 
by the original symbol 
in the Symbols panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  405
With the symbol instance selected on the artboard, notice that, in the Control 
panel, you see the word “Symbol” and symbol-related options.
Next, you will edit the Rest Area symbol so that both instances are affected. There 
are several ways to edit a symbol, and in this section we will focus on one.
8 With the Selection tool ( ), double-click the Rest Area symbol instance in the 
CENTRAL PARK area on the artboard.
A warning dialog box appears, stating that you are about to edit the original 
symbol and that all instances will update. Click OK to continue. This takes you 
into Symbol Editing mode, so you can’t edit any other objects on the page.
 Tip:  Another way to edit a symbol is to select the symbol instance on the artboard and then click 
the Edit Symbol button in the Control panel.
The Rest Area symbol instance you double-clicked appears to change in size. 
That’s because you are looking at the original symbol, not at the resized symbol 
instance on the page. You can now edit the shapes that make up the symbol.
9 Select the Zoom tool (
), and draw a marquee around the symbol instance in 
the CENTRAL PARK area to zoom in to it.
10 Select the Selection tool and click to select any of the red shapes that make up 
the picnic bench.
11 In the Control panel, change the Fill color to the swatch named Local Green.
12 With the Selection tool, double-click away from the Rest Area content or click 
the Exit Symbol Editing Mode button (
) in the upper-left corner of the artboard 
until you exit Symbol Editing mode so that you can edit the rest of the content.

13 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window, and notice that both Rest Area 
instances on the artboard now have a green fill.
14 Choose File > Save, and leave the document open.

LESSON 14  Working with Symbols
Creating symbols
Illustrator also lets you create your own symbols. You can make symbols from 
objects, including paths, compound paths, text, raster images, mesh objects, and 
groups of objects. Symbols can even include active objects, such as brush strokes, 
blends, effects, or other symbol instances. Now, you will create your own symbol 
from existing artwork.
1 Choose View > symbol content. This takes you to a zoomed in view off the right 
side of the artboard.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), drag a marquee across the yellow fork content to 
select it. Drag the selected content into a blank area of the Symbols panel.
3 In the Symbol Options dialog box, change the name to Food and select Graphic 
as the Type. Click OK to create the symbol.
In the Symbol Options dialog box, you will see a note that explains that there is 
no difference between a Movie Clip and a Graphic Type in Illustrator, so if you 
do not plan on exporting this content to Adobe Flash, you don’t need to worry 
about the Type.
	Note:  If you are creating artwork for use on the web or for screen display, you can select 
Align To Pixel Grid in the Symbol Options dialog box to align the instances to the pixel grid. To learn 
more about the pixel grid, see Lesson 13, “Applying Appearance Attributes and Graphic Styles.”
After creating the Food symbol, the original fork group off the right edge of the 
artboard is converted to an instance of the Food symbol. You can leave it there or 
delete it, it’s up to you.
4 If it isn’t already there, drag the Food symbol 
icon to the right of the Rest Area to change 
the order of the symbols in the panel.
Reordering symbols in the Symbols panel has 
no effect on the artwork. It can be a way to 
organize your symbols.
5 Choose File > Save.
 Note:  You can only 
use placed art that is 
embedded (not linked)
to create a symbol.
 Tip:  By default, 
the selected artwork 
becomes an instance of 
the new symbol. If you 
don’t want the artwork 
to become an instance 
of the symbol, press the 
Shift key as you create 
the new symbol.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  407
Symbol Options
In the Symbol Options dialog box, you will encounter several options that are 
related to working with Adobe Flash. These options are briefly described below and 
will be addressed more fully later in this lesson.
• 
Select Movie Clip for type. Movie Clip is the default symbol type in Flash and 
in Illustrator.
• 
Specify a location on the Registration grid where you want to set the symbol’s 
anchor point. The location of the anchor point affects the position of the symbol 
within the screen coordinates.
• 
Select Enable Guides For 9-Slice Scaling if you want to utilize 9-Slice scaling 
in Flash.
—From Illustrator Help
Editing a symbol
In this next section, you will add several instances of the Food symbol to the 
artwork. Then, you will edit the symbol in the Symbols panel and all instances will 
be updated.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 Using the Selection tool ( ), drag an instance of the Food symbol (the yellow 
fork) from the Symbols panel to just to the right of the MARKET ST label in the 
middle of the artboard.

Next, you will learn how to add more instances of a symbol that’s already on the 
artboard, using a modifier key.
4 With the Selection tool ( ), press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key 
and drag one of the Food symbol instances already on the artboard to create a 
copy of the instance. Drag it to the right of the WALNUT ST label. When the

You should now have a total of seven Food symbol instances on the artboard.
6 In the Symbols panel, double-click the Food symbol to edit it. A temporary 
instance of the symbol appears in the center of the Document window.
Editing a symbol by double-clicking the symbol in the Symbols panel hides all 
artboard content except the symbol. This is just another way to edit a symbol.
7 Press Ctrl++ (Windows) or Command++ (Mac OS) several times to zoom in.
8 With the Direct Selection tool ( ), click to 
select the yellow shape. Change the Fill color 
to the swatch named New Local Blue in the 
Control panel.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  409
Since the fork content is grouped, selecting with the Direct Selection tool lets 
you select a shape within the group.
9 Choose Select > All, or drag across the shapes with the Selection tool.
10 Choose Object > Transform > Scale. In the Scale dialog box, change the Uniform 
Scale to 60% and then click OK.
This allows you to scale all of the symbol instances at once, rather than having 
to scale each individually. You could make other changes to the symbol artwork 
in a similar manner.
11 Double-click outside the symbol instance artwork on the artboard, or click the 
Exit Symbol Editing Mode button (
) in the upper-left corner of the artboard to 
see all of the artwork.
12 Press Ctrl+0 (Windows) or Command+0 (Mac OS) to fit the artboard in 
the window.

you edit it in place. By double-clicking a symbol in the Symbols panel, the rest 
of the artwork is hidden and the symbol appears in the center of the Document 
window. You can use whichever method suits your workflow.
14 Choose File > Save.
Replacing symbols
Next, you will create a symbol from some other shapes and then replace a few of 
the Food symbol instances with the new symbol.
1 Choose View > symbol content.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), select the green group of shapes with the smiley face 
(not the two trees).

This is a great way to select all instances of a symbol in the document. Notice 
that it also selects the original symbol instance off the right side of the artboard.
10 Choose Object > Group, and then File > Save. Keep the file open.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  411
Symbol layers
When you edit a symbol using any of the methods 
described, open the Layers panel and you will see 
that the symbol has its own layering.
Similar to working with groups in Isolation mode, 
you see the layers associated with that symbol 
only, not the document’s layers. In the Layers 
panel, you can rename, add, delete, show/hide, 
and reorder content for a symbol.
Breaking a link to a symbol
At times, you will need to edit specific instances on the artboard but not all of 
them. Because you can only make changes to a symbol instance like scaling, 
opacity, flipping, and more, you may need to break the link between a symbol 
and an instance. This breaks the instance into the original objects or group, if the 
symbol content was originally grouped, on the artboard.
Next, you will break the link to one of the Food instances.
1 With the Selection tool ( ) 
selected, click to select the 
Food symbol instance to 
the right of the EAST AVE 
label on the artboard. In the 
Control panel, click the 
Break Link button.
This object is now a series 
of paths, as indicated by the 
word “Path” on the left side of 
the Control panel. You should 
be able to see the anchor points of the shapes. This content will no longer 
update if the Food symbol is edited.
2 Select the Zoom tool (
), and drag a marquee across the selected content to 
zoom in.
3 Choose Select > Deselect. Select the Direct Selection tool ( ), and then click the 
aqua shape.
4 Change the Fill color to the swatch named Mid Gray in the Control panel.
5 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
E A S T  AV E
B R O A D WAY
 Tip:  You can also 
break the link to a 
symbol instance 
by selecting the 
symbol instance on 
the artboard and 
then clicking the 
Break Link To Symbol 
button (
) at the 
bottom of the Symbols 
panel.

412 
LESSON 14  Working with Symbols
Editing symbol options
Using the Symbols panel, you can easily rename or change other options for a 
symbol, which then updates all the symbol instances in the artwork. Next, you will 
rename the Rest Area symbol.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.
2 In the Symbols panel, make sure that the Rest Area symbol is selected. Click the 
Symbol Options button (
) at the bottom of the Symbols panel.
3 In the Symbol Options dialog box, change the name to Picnic area and the 
Type to Graphic. Click OK.
Working with the Symbolism tools
The Symbol Sprayer tool (
) in the Tools panel allows you to spray symbols on the 
artboard, creating symbol sets. A symbol set is a group of symbol instances that you 
create with the Symbol Sprayer tool. This can be really useful if, for instance, you 
were to create grass from individual blades of grass. Spraying the blades of grass 
speeds up this process greatly and makes it much easier to edit individual instances 
or the sprayed grass as a group. You can create mixed sets of symbol instances 
by using the Symbol Sprayer tool with one symbol and then using it again with 
another symbol.
Spraying symbol instances
Next, you will save several trees as a symbol and then use the Symbol Sprayer tool 
to apply those trees to your illustration.
1 Choose View > symbol content.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), drag across the two tree shapes to select them.
3 Drag the trees group into the Symbols panel. In the Symbol Options dialog box, 
change the name to Trees and the Type to Graphic. Click OK.
4 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose View > Fit Artboard In Window.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  413
5 Select the Symbol Sprayer tool (
) in the Tools panel. Make sure the Trees 
symbol is selected in the Symbols panel.
6 Double-click the Symbol Sprayer tool (
) in the Tools panel. In the Symbolism 
Tools Options dialog box, change the Diameter to 1 in and the Intensity to 5, if 
they aren’t already, and change the Symbol Set Density to 7. Click OK.
 Note:  A higher intensity value increases the rate of change—the Symbol Sprayer tool sprays 
more and faster. The higher the symbol set density value, the more tightly packed the symbols are 
as you spray them. If you were to spray grass, for instance, you would want the intensity and density 
set high.
7 Position the pointer over the CENTRAL PARK label, and click and drag from 
left to right and from right to left with the Symbol Sprayer, much like using an 
airbrush or a can of spray paint, to create trees in the park. Release the mouse 
button when you see some trees on the artboard, like in the figure.
Notice the bounding box around the Trees symbol instances, identifying it as a 
symbol set. As you spray, the instances are grouped together as a single object. 
If a symbol set is selected when you begin to spray with the Symbol Sprayer tool, 
the symbol instances that you are spraying are added to the selected symbol set. 
You can easily delete an entire symbol set by selecting it and then pressing the 
Delete key.
Spray the symbols.	
The result.
 Tip:  Make sure 
to keep moving the 
pointer. If you don’t 
like the results, you can 
choose Edit > Undo 
Spraying and try again.

LESSON 14  Working with Symbols
8 Choose Select > Deselect.
9 Position the Symbol Sprayer 
pointer over the trees you just 
created. Click and drag to add 
more trees.
Notice that after releasing 
the mouse button, you see 
a bounding box around 
only the new symbol set. To 
add symbol instances to an 
existing symbol set, you must first select 
the set.
10 With the new symbol set selected, press Delete or Backspace to delete it.
11 With the Selection tool, click to select the first Trees symbol set you created.
12 Select the Symbol Sprayer 
tool, and add more trees 
to the first symbol set. Try 
clicking and releasing, instead 
of clicking and dragging, to 
add one tree at a time.
13 Choose File > Save, and leave 
the symbol set selected.
Editing symbols with the Symbolism tools
Besides the Symbol Sprayer tool, there is a series of Symbolism tools that allow you 
to edit the size, color, rotation, and more of the instances within a symbol set. In 
the next steps, you will edit the trees in the Trees symbol set using the Symbolism 
tools in the Tools panel.
1 With the Trees symbol set and the Symbol Sprayer tool (
) still selected, 
position the pointer over one of the tree instances. Press the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key, and click to delete one of the instances in the set.
2 Select the Symbol Sizer tool (
) from the Symbol Sprayer tool (
) group in 
the Tools panel. Double-click the Symbol Sizer tool, and change the Intensity 
to 3 in the Symbolism Tools Options dialog box. Click OK.
3 Position the pointer over some of the trees, and click the mouse button to 
increase the size of some of the trees. In another area of trees, press the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key while you are using the Symbol Sizer tool 
to reduce the size of the selected symbol set. Make some of the trees smaller 
than the rest, varying the sizes.
 Tip:  If you don’t 
like the placement of 
a tree, you can choose 
Edit > Undo Spraying to 
remove the instances 
you sprayed in the 
previous click.
 Tip:  If the Symbol 
Sizer tool is sizing too 
quickly, double-click 
the Symbol Sizer tool in 
the Tools panel and try 
lowering the Intensity 
and Density values in 
the Symbolism Tools 
Options dialog box.

Now, you will reposition some of the trees in the symbol set.
4 Select the Symbol Shifter tool (
) from the Symbol Sizer tool group. Double-
click the Symbol Shifter tool. In the Symbolism Tools Options dialog box, 
change the Intensity to 8, and then click OK.
The higher the Intensity, the further you can move the symbol instances.
5 Position the pointer over a tree in the selected symbol set, and then drag left or 
right to move it. Drag the trees away from the CENTRAL PARK label so that 
you can see the whole thing.
The more you move the pointer, the further you can drag instances. The trees 
you see in your symbol set may be arranged differently than in the figures and 
that’s okay.
Drag the trees.	
The result.
You may notice that, as you drag, some of the trees that 
should be behind other trees are actually on top of them.
Next, you will fix this with the Symbol Shifter tool.
 Tip:  The circle 
(diameter setting) 
around the Symbolism 
tools pointers indicates 
that any symbol 
instances within that 
circle will be affected. 
Press the left bracket 
key ([) or right bracket 
key (]) to change the 
brush diameter.

416 
LESSON 14  Working with Symbols
You may want to zoom in to the symbol set for the next steps.
6 With the Symbol Shifter tool selected, press the left bracket key ([) a few times 
to decrease the diameter. Make sure that the circle surrounding the pointer 
(that indicates the diameter) isn’t much bigger than a tree. Shift-click one of the 
trees that should be in front to bring it to the front.
7 Select the Symbol Stainer 
tool (
) from the Symbol 
Shifter tool group in the Tools 
panel. With the symbol set 
still selected, position the 
pointer over the symbol set. 
Press the right bracket key (]) 
several times to increase the 
size of the brush.
8 Change the Fill color in the Control panel to New Local Yellow, and begin 
clicking on trees in the symbol set to change their color.
You can always choose Edit > Undo Staining, if you don’t like how it’s affecting 
the trees, or Alt-click (Windows) or Option-click (Mac OS) to decrease the 
amount of colorization.
 Tip:  There are lots of Symbolism tools for you to experiment with, including the Symbol Styler 
tool (
), which allows you to apply graphic styles to symbol instances in the symbol set. To learn 
more about the different types of Symbolism tools available, search for “symbolism tool gallery” in 
Illustrator Help (Help > Illustrator Help).
9 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.
Copying and editing symbol sets
A symbol set is treated as a single object. In order to edit the instances in it, you use 
the Symbolism tools in the Tools panel, as you’ve already seen. You can, however, 
duplicate symbol instances and use the Symbolism tools to make the duplicates 
look different.
 Tip:  Shift+Alt-click 
(Windows) or Shift+ 
Option-click (Mac OS) to 
send a tree behind.
 Tip:  The longer you 
press the mouse button, 
the more stained  
they become. Try 
quickly tapping the 
mouse button.
Change the stacking order of instances.	
The final result.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  417
Next, you will duplicate the Trees symbol set.
1 Select the Selection tool ( ), and click to select the Trees symbol set.
2 Press the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, and drag a copy of the 
instances down and to the left, into the lower-left part of the CENTRAL PARK 
green area. When it is in position (see the figure), release the mouse button and 
then the modifier key.
	Note:  There are many transformations that you can make to a symbol set. You can also drag a 
point in the bounding box of a symbol set with the Selection tool to resize it.
3 Select the Symbol Shifter 
tool (
) from the Symbol 
Stainer tool group. Double-
click the Symbol Shifter tool, 
and change the Intensity to 9. 
Click OK. Drag the trees in 
the symbol set so that they fit 
within the green park area, as 
you see in the figure.
You can change the diameter by pressing the left bracket ([) key or right bracket 
(]) key. This will help you move more or fewer trees.
4 With the Symbol shifter tool, 
Shift-click the trees that 
should be in front, to bring 
them to the front. Shift+Alt-
click (Windows) or Shift+ 
Option-click (Mac OS) to 
send a tree behind.
5 Choose Select > Deselect.
6 Choose File > Save.

LESSON 14  Working with Symbols
Storing and retrieving artwork 
in the Symbols panel
Saving frequently used logos or other artwork as symbols lets you access
them quickly. Unfortunately, symbols you create in one document are not 
accessible by default in another document. In this next part of the lesson, you will 
take symbols that you’ve created and save them as a new symbol library that you 
can share with other documents or users.
1 In the Symbols panel, click the Symbol 
Libraries Menu button (
) at the bottom and 
then choose Save Symbols.
 Note:  When saving symbols as a separate library, the 
document that contains the symbols that you want to save 
should be open and active in the Document window.
2 In the Save Symbols As Library dialog box, 
choose a location, such as your Desktop, to 
place the symbol library file. Name the library 
file map_symbols.ai. Click Save.
 Note:  When you first open the Save Symbols As Library dialog box, Illustrator takes you to the 
default Symbols folder, where you can store the libraries that you create. Illustrator recognizes any 
libraries stored here and lets you choose them from the Symbol Libraries menu later.
 Tip:  If you save the library in the default folder, you can make subfolders and create a folder 
structure that suits you. You can then easily access them using the Symbol Libraries Menu button or 
by choosing Window > Symbol Libraries > User Defined > your symbol library.
3 Without closing the map.ai file, create a new document by choosing
File > New. Leave the default settings, and then click OK.
4 In the Symbols panel, click the Symbol Libraries Menu button (
) and choose 
Other Library at the bottom of the menu. Navigate to the folder where you 
saved the map_symbols.ai library, select it, and then click Open.
The map_symbols library appears as a free-floating panel in the workspace. You 
can dock it or leave it where it is. It stays open as long as Illustrator is open. 
When you close Illustrator, and then relaunch it, this panel does not reopen.
5 Drag any of the Symbols from the map_symbols library panel onto the artboard.
6 Choose File > Close, and do not save the new file.
7 Close the map_symbols library.
8 With the map.ai file open, choose File > Save, if necessary, and then File > Close.
 Note:  Symbol 
libraries are saved as 
Adobe Illustrator  
(.ai) files.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  419
Mapping a symbol to 3D artwork
You can apply 2D artwork stored as a symbol in the Symbols panel to selected 
surfaces on a 3D object. To learn about mapping symbols to 3D artwork, see 
Lesson 12, “Applying Effects.”
Working with symbols and Flash integration
Illustrator also provides excellent support for SWF and SVG file type export. When 
you export to Flash, you can set the symbol type to Movie Clip. In Adobe Flash, 
you can choose another type, if necessary. You can also specify 9‑slice scaling in 
Illustrator so that the movie clips scale appropriately when used for user 
interface components.
You can move Illustrator artwork into the Flash editing environment or directly 
into the Flash Player. You can copy and paste artwork, save files as SWF, or 
export artwork directly to Flash. In addition, Illustrator provides support for Flash 
dynamic text and movie clip symbols.
The following is a generic symbol workflow in Illustrator:
• 
Step 1: Symbol creation
When you create a symbol in Illustrator, the Symbol Options dialog box lets 
you name the symbol and set the following options, specific to Flash: Movie 
Clip symbol type (which is the default for Flash symbols), Flash registration 
grid location, and 9‑slice scaling guides. In addition, you can use many of the 
same symbol keyboard shortcuts in Illustrator and Flash, such as pressing F8 
to create a symbol.
• 
Step 2: Isolation mode for symbol editing
• 
Step 3: Symbol properties and links
• 
Step 4: Static, dynamic, and input text objects
Next, you will create a button, save it as a symbol, and then edit the symbol options.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Essentials.
2 Choose File > New.
3 In the New Document dialog box, choose Web from the New Document Profile 
menu. Keep the rest of the options at their default settings, and then click OK.
4 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, name the file buttons.ai and 
navigate to the Lesson14 folder. Leave the Save As Type option set to Adobe 
Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows) or the Format option set to Adobe Illustrator (ai) 
(Mac OS), and then click Save. In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave the 
Illustrator options at their default settings and then click OK.
5 Choose Window > Symbol Libraries > Web Buttons And Bars.
	Note:  If you don’t 
see “Reset Essentials” in 
the Workspace menu, 
choose Window > 
Workspace > Essentials 
before choosing 
Window > Workspace > 
Reset Essentials.

420 
LESSON 14  Working with Symbols
6 Choose Small List View from the Symbols panel menu (
).
7 Drag the blue Bullet 4 - Forward symbol from the Web Buttons And Bars panel 
onto the artboard. Close the Web Buttons And Bars panel menu group.
8 With the Selection tool ( ), Shift-click the upper-right corner of the button and 
drag to make it roughly twice its original size, releasing the mouse button and 
then the key.
9 With the button still selected, change the Instance Name in the Control panel to 
Home and press Enter or Return.
The Instance Name is optional when working in Illustrator and is used to 
identify one symbol instance from another. Entering an instance name for each 
button is useful if you choose to import the Illustrator content to the stage in 
Flash (File > Import > Import To Stage).
10 With the button selected, begin dragging it to the right. As you drag, press 
Shift+Alt (Windows) or Shift+Option (Mac OS) to create a copy. Release the 
mouse button first and then the modifier keys.
11 In the Control panel, change the Instance Name to Info and press Enter or Return.
12 With one of the buttons still selected, click the 
Symbols panel icon (
) to open the panel. Click 
the Symbol Options button (
) at the bottom of 
the panel. Make sure that Movie Clip is chosen 
from the Type menu, select Enable Guides For 
9-Slice Scaling, and then click OK.
Next, you’ll adjust the 9-slice scaling guides.
13 With the Selection tool, double-click the 
leftmost button to enter Isolation mode. When 
the warning dialog box appears, click OK.
14 Select the Zoom tool (
) in the Tools panel, and click three times on the 
leftmost button to zoom in. Choose Select > All.
Choosing Select > All allows you to see the anchor points in the shapes. When 
you adjust the 9-slice scaling guides, you want to try to position them to 
indicate the scalable part of the object (usually not the corners).
Resize the symbol instance.	
Name the instance.	
Duplicate the instance.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  421
15 With the Selection tool, drag the rightmost dotted 
line to the right so that it lines up approximately with 
the anchor points (circled), as shown in the figure.
You can use 9-slice scaling (scale-9) to specify 
component-style scaling for graphic style and movie 
clip symbols. To maintain the visual integrity of the 
symbol, corners are not scaled, while the remaining 
areas of the image are scaled (as opposed to being stretched) larger or smaller, 
as needed.
16 With the Selection tool, double-click away from the buttons to exit 
Isolation mode.
17 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window and then File > Save.
Understanding symbol  
options for Flash
Movie Clip: Use movie clip symbols to create 
reusable pieces of animation (in Flash). Movie 
clips have their own multiframe Timeline that is 
independent from the main Timeline—think of 
them as nested inside a main Timeline that can 
contain interactive controls, sounds, and even 
other movie clip instances. You can also place 
movie clip instances inside the Timeline of a button 
symbol to create animated buttons. In addition, 
movie clips are scriptable with ActionScript®.
Align to Pixel Grid: To create a pixel-aligned 
symbol, select the Align to Pixel Grid option from the Symbol Options dialog box. 
Symbols aligned to the pixel grid remain aligned to the pixel grid at all locations of 
the artboard, in their actual size.
9-slice scaling: You can use 9-slice scaling (scale-9) to specify component-style 
scaling for graphic style and movie clip symbols. This type of scaling lets you create 
movie clip symbols that scale appropriately for use as user interface components, as 
opposed to the type of scaling typically applied to graphics and design elements.
The symbol is conceptually divided into nine sections with a grid-like overlay, and 
each of the nine areas is scaled independently. To maintain the visual integrity 
of the symbol, corners are not scaled, while the remaining areas of the image are 
scaled (as opposed to being stretched) larger or smaller, as needed.
—From Illustrator Help
For the next section, you need to have Adobe Flash CS6 installed on your machine.
 Note:   If you don’t 
own Adobe Flash 
CS6, you can install a 
free trial version from 
Adobe.com for 30 
days, here: http://www.
adobe.com/downloads/

422 
LESSON 14  Working with Symbols
1 Open Adobe Flash CS6.
2 Choose File > New. In the New Document dialog box, make sure that the 
General tab is selected and that ActionScript 3.0 is also selected as the Type.
Click OK.
3 Choose File > Import > Import To Library in Adobe Flash. Navigate to the 
buttons.ai file you just saved in Illustrator, and then click Open. The Import 
“buttons.ai” To Library dialog box appears.
In this dialog box, you can select which artboard to import, which layers to 
import, how to import the content, and more. The Import Unused Symbols 
option at the bottom of the dialog box brings all the symbols in the Illustrator 
Symbols panel into the Flash Library panel. This can be very useful if, for 
instance, you are developing a series of buttons for a site but they are not on the 
artboard in Illustrator.
4 Click OK.
5 Open the Library panel by clicking the 
Library panel tab on the right side of the 
workspace. Click the arrow to the left of 
the folder names to reveal the assets as 
well as the Bullet 4 - Forward symbol in 
the Illustrator Symbols folder.
6 Drag the Bullet 4 - Forward symbol onto 
the stage.
7 Choose File > Close to close the Flash file, 
and don’t save changes. Close Flash, and 
return to Illustrator. Close all open files 
in Illustrator.

COMBINING ILLUSTRATOR 
CS6 GRAPHICS WITH OTHER 
ADOBE APPLICATIONS
Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to do the following:
• Differentiate between vector and bitmap graphics.
• Place linked and embedded Adobe Photoshop graphics in an
Adobe Illustrator file.
• Create and edit a simple clipping mask.
• Create a clipping mask from a drawn shape.
• Create a clipping mask from a compound path.
• Make an opacity mask to display part of an image.
• Sample color in a placed image.
• Work with the Links panel.
• Replace a placed image with another and update the document.
• Export a layered file to Adobe Photoshop.
This lesson takes approximately an hour to complete. If needed, remove 
the previous lesson folder from your hard disk and copy the Lesson15 
folder onto it.

425
You can easily add an image created in an image-
editing program to an Adobe Illustrator file. This is 
an effective method for incorporating images into 
your vector artwork or for trying out Illustrator special 
effects on bitmap images.

LESSON 15 
Combining Illustrator CS6 Graphics with Other Adobe Applications
Getting started
Before you begin, you’ll need to restore the default preferences for Adobe 
Illustrator CS6. Then, you’ll open the finished art file for this lesson to see what 
you’ll create.
1 To ensure that the tools and panels function exactly as described in this lesson, 
delete or deactivate (by renaming) the Adobe Illustrator CS6 preferences file. 
See “Restoring default preferences” on page 3.
2 Start Adobe Illustrator CS6.
	Note:  If you have not already done so, copy the Lesson15 folder from the Lessons folder on the 
Adobe Illustrator CS6 Classroom in a Book CD onto your hard disk. See “Copying the Classroom in a 
Book files” on page 2.
3 Choose File > Open. Locate the file named L15end.ai 
in the Lesson15 folder in the Lessons folder that you 
copied onto your hard disk. This is a poster for a 
farmers market, and you will add and edit graphics, in 
this lesson. Leave it open for reference, or choose
File > Close.
Now, you’ll open the start file from Adobe Bridge CS6.
Working with Adobe Bridge
Bridge is an application that installs when you install either an Adobe Creative 
Suite 6 component, such as Illustrator, or the entire Adobe Creative Suite 6. It 
allows you to browse content visually, manage metadata, and more.
1 Choose File > Browse In Bridge to open Bridge.
2 In the Favorites pane on the left, click Desktop and navigate to the L15start.ai 
file in the Lesson15 folder. Click the thumbnail in the Content pane.

13 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, 
navigate to the Lesson15 folder and open it. Name the 
file marketposter.ai. Leave the Save As Type option set 
to Adobe Illustrator (*.AI) (Windows) or the Format 
option set to Adobe Illustrator (ai) (Mac OS), and then 
click Save. In the Illustrator Options dialog box, leave 
the Illustrator options at their default settings. 
Click OK.
Combining artwork
You can combine Illustrator artwork with images from other graphics applications 
in a variety of ways for a wide range of creative results. Sharing artwork between 
applications lets you combine continuous-tone paintings and photographs with 
vector art. Even though Illustrator lets you create certain types of raster images, 
Adobe Photoshop excels at many image-editing tasks. The images can then be 
inserted into Illustrator.
This lesson steps you through the process of creating a composite image, including 
combining bitmap images with vector art and working between applications. 
You will add photographic images created in Photoshop to a poster created in 
Illustrator. Then, you’ll adjust the color of an image, mask an image, and sample 
color from an image to use in the Illustrator artwork. You’ll update a placed image, 
and then export your poster to Photoshop.
Vector versus bitmap graphics
Illustrator creates vector graphics, also called draw graphics, which contain shapes 
based on mathematical expressions. Vector graphics consist of clear, smooth lines 
that retain their crispness when scaled. They are best for illustrations, type, and 
graphics that need to be scaled to different sizes, such as logos.
	Note:  In Mac OS, 
when opening lesson 
files, you may need to 
click the round, green 
button in the upper-left 
corner of the Document 
window to maximize 
the window’s size.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  429
This logo is drawn as vector art, which retains its crispness when scaled to a larger size.
Bitmap graphics, also called raster images, are based on a grid of pixels usually 
measured in pixels per inch (ppi). They are created by image-editing applications 
such as Photoshop. When working with bitmap images, you edit groups of pixels 
rather than objects or shapes. Because bitmap graphics can represent subtle 
gradations of shade and color, they are appropriate for continuous-tone images, 
such as photographs, or for artwork created in painting programs. A disadvantage 
of bitmap graphics is that they lose definition and appear jagged when scaled up.
This logo is rasterized as bitmap art and loses its definition when enlarged.
In deciding whether to use Illustrator or a bitmap image-editing program such 
as Photoshop for creating and combining graphics, consider the elements of the 
artwork and how the artwork will be used.
In general, use Illustrator if you need to create art or type with clean lines that 
looks good at any magnification. In most cases, you’ll also want to use Illustrator 
for laying out a single-page design, because Illustrator offers more flexibility than 
Photoshop when working with type and when reselecting, moving, and altering 
images. You can create raster images in Illustrator, but its pixel-editing tools are 
limited. Use Photoshop for images that need pixel editing, color correcting, and 
other special effects. Use Adobe InDesign for laying out anything from a postcard 
to a multiple chapter book, such as this Classroom in a Book.

430 
LESSON 15 
Combining Illustrator CS6 Graphics with Other Adobe Applications
Placing Photoshop files
You can bring artwork from Photoshop into Illustrator using the Open command, 
the Place command, the Paste command, and drag-and-drop. Illustrator supports 
most Photoshop data, including layer comps, layers, editable text, and paths. This 
means that you can transfer files between Photoshop and Illustrator without losing 
the ability to edit the artwork. 
 Note:  Adjustment layers for which visibility is turned off in Photoshop are imported into 
Illustrator, although they are inaccessible (an adjustment layer applies color and tonal adjustments 
to your image without permanently changing pixel values). When exported back to Photoshop, the 
layers are restored.
When placing files using the File > Place command, no matter what type of image 
file it is (JPG, GIF, PSD, etc.), it can either be embedded or linked. Embedding files 
stores a copy of the image in the Illustrator file, and the Illustrator file size increases 
to reflect the addition of the placed file. Linked files remain separate external files, 
and a link to the external file is placed in the Illustrator file. Linking to files can be 
a great way to ensure that image updates are reflected in the Illustrator file. The 
linked file must always accompany the Illustrator file, or the link will break and the 
placed file will not appear in the Illustrator artwork.
Placing a Photoshop file
1 In Illustrator CS6, choose Window > Layers 
to open the Layers panel. In the Layers panel, 
select the Woman layer.
When you place an image, it is added to the 
selected layer. You’ll use the Woman layer for 
the placed image. The layer already includes 
the white circle you see on the artboard.
2 Choose File > Place.
3 Navigate to the carrots.psd file 
in the images folder inside the 
Lesson15 folder, and select it. 
Make sure that Link is selected in 
the Place dialog box.
By default, placed Photoshop files 
are linked to their source file. So, if 
the source file is edited, the placed 
image in Illustrator is updated. 
If you deselect the Link option, 
you embed the PSD file in the 
Illustrator file.
 Note:  Illustrator 
includes support for 
Device N rasters. For 
instance, if you create 
a Duotone image in 
Photoshop and place 
it in Illustrator, it 
separates properly and 
prints the spot colors.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  431
4 Click Place.
Notice that the image of carrots is placed in the 
center of the Document window. It is selected and 
has bounding points and an X in the center of the 
image. Also notice in the Control panel that, with 
the image selected, you see the words “Linked File,” 
indicating that the image is linked to its source file, 
together with other information about the image. 
Clicking Linked File in the Control panel opens the 
Links panel, which you’ll do later in this lesson.
Transforming a placed image
You can duplicate and transform placed images just as you do other objects in an 
Illustrator file. Unlike vector artwork, you need to consider the resolution of the 
raster image. Next, you will move, resize, and rotate the carrots.psd image.
1 With the Selection tool ( ) selected and the image already selected, drag the 
image down and to the right so that it is positioned over the top of the white 
circle in the lower-right corner of the artboard. You may need to scroll down in 
the Document window.
2 Holding down the Alt+Shift 
(Windows) or Option+Shift (Mac OS) 
keys, use the Selection tool to drag the 
upper-right bounding point toward 
the center of the image until the 
width is approximately 4.5 in. Release 
the mouse button and then the keys.
After resizing the image, notice that 
the PPI (Pixels Per Inch) value in 
the Control panel is approximately 157. The PPI refers to the resolution of the 
image. Working in Illustrator, if you make an image smaller, the resolution of 
the image increases. If you make an image larger, the resolution decreases.
3 With the Selection tool, position 
the pointer just off the upper-right 
bounding point. The rotate arrows 
should appear. Drag up and to the 
left to rotate the image about 
13 degrees. With Smart Guides 
on, you’ll see a measurement label. 
Make sure that the image completely 
covers the circle.
4 Choose Select > Deselect and then 
File > Save.
 Tip:  To transform a 
placed image, you can 
also open the Transform 
panel (Window > 
Transform) and change 
settings there.
	Note:  Transformations 
performed on a linked 
image in Illustrator, and 
any resulting resolution 
changes, do not change 
the original image. The 
changes apply only to the 
image within Illustrator.

Embedding a Photoshop image with layer comps
Designers often create multiple compositions, or comps, of a page layout to show 
their clients. Using layer comps in Photoshop, you can create, manage, and view 
multiple versions of a layout in a single Photoshop file.
A layer comp is a snapshot of a state of the Layers panel in Photoshop. Layer comps 
record the following information about a layer:
• Visibility—whether a layer is showing or hidden
• Position in the document
• Appearance (Layer Style)—whether a layer style is applied to the layer and the 
layer’s blending mode
You create a layer comp in Photoshop by making changes to the layers in your 
document and clicking the Create New Layer Comp button in the Layer Comps 
panel. You view comps by applying them in the document. You can export layer 
comps to separate files, to a single PDF file, to a web photo gallery, or choose one 
when placing the Photoshop file into Illustrator.
Next, you will place a Photoshop file with layer comps and embed it in the 
Illustrator file.
1 In the Layers panel, click the visibility column 
in the Woman layer to hide the contents and 
then select the Background layer.
2 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window, in 
case you zoomed in on the artwork or scrolled 
in previous steps.
3 Choose File > Place.
4 Navigate to the market.psd file in the images folder inside of the Lesson15 
folder. Deselect the Link option, and then click Place.
5 In the Photoshop Import Options dialog box, 
set the following options:
• 
Select Show Preview, if it’s not 
already selected.
• 
Choose All from the Layer Comp menu.
• 
Select Convert Layers To Objects.
• 
Select Import Hidden Layers to import 
layers hidden in Photoshop.
Click OK.
 Note:  Deselecting 
the Link option 
embeds the PSD file 
in the Illustrator file. 
Embedding the PSD 
allows for more options 
when it is placed.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  433
 Note:  A color mode warning may appear in the Photoshop Import Options dialog box. This 
indicates that the image you are placing may not be the same color mode as the Illustrator 
document. Also, for this image, and going forward, if a color warning dialog box appears after you 
click OK, click OK in the warning dialog box.
Rather than flatten the file, you want to convert the Photoshop layers to objects, 
because the market.psd file contains several layers.
6 In the Layers panel, click the triangle ( ) to the 
left of the Background layer to expand it. Drag 
the bottom of the panel down, if necessary, so 
that you can see more of the layers. Click the 
triangle to the left of the market.psd sublayer to 
expand it.
Notice the sublayers of market.psd. These 
sublayers were Photoshop layers in Photoshop and appear in the Layers panel in 
Illustrator because you chose not to flatten the image when you placed it. Also 
notice that, with the image still selected on the page, the Control panel shows 
the word “Group” on the left side and includes a link to Multiple Images. When 
you place a Photoshop file with layers and you choose to convert the layers to 
objects in the Photoshop Import Options dialog box, Illustrator treats the layers 
as separate images in a group.
7 Click the eye icon (
) to the left of the Color 
Fill 1 sublayer to hide it.
 Note:  You may need to drag the left edge of the Layers 
panel to the left to see the full names.
8 With the Selection tool ( ), drag the market 
image down so that the bottom edge of the 
image snaps to the bottom, red bleed guide.
9 Choose Select > Deselect, and 
then choose File > Save.

Applying color edits to a placed image
You can use color edits in a variety of ways to modify colors in placed images that 
are embedded. You can convert to a different color mode (such as RGB, CMYK, 
or grayscale) or adjust individual color values. You can also saturate (darken) or 
desaturate (lighten) colors or invert colors (create a color negative).
Next, you’ll place an image and then adjust its colors. Later in the lesson, you’ll 
apply a mask to this image.
1 In the Layers panel, click the eye icon (
) 
to the left of the Background layer to hide it. 
Click the triangle to the left of the Background 
layer to collapse it. Click the visibility column 
in the Corn layer and the Berries layer to show 
the contents, and then select the Berries layer.
The Corn layer shows an image of corn with 
the word “LOCAL.” You are going to place 
another image and adjust the color and then mask a copy of it. The corn image 
and text are an example of what you are about to create.
2 Choose File > Place.
3 Navigate to the berries.psd file in the images folder inside the Lesson15 folder, 
and then select it. Select Link in the Place dialog box, and then click Place.
 Note:  As long as the file is open, the Link option is sticky. That means the next time you place an 
image, the Link option will automatically apply.
4 With the berries image selected, double-click the Rotate tool (
) in the Tools 
panel. Change the Rotate Angle to -90, and then click OK.
5 Select the top, center point of the Reference Point Indicator (
) in the Control 
panel. Change the Y value to -0.125 in. Click the Constrain Width And Height 
Proportions button (
), change the W value to 70% (make sure to type in 
the “%”), and then press Enter or Return.
 Tip:  For information 
on color modes and 
modifying colors 
with color edits, see 
“About colors in 
digital graphics” and 
“Apply an effect” in 
Illustrator Help.
 Note:  Depending on 
your screen resolution, 
the Transform options 
may not appear in the 
Control panel. You 
can click the word 
“Transform,” or you may 
need to choose  
Window > Transform to 
open the panel.
 Note:  This figure 
shows the values 
before pressing 
Enter or Return.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  435
In order to edit colors in the image, the image needs to be embedded in the 
Illustrator file. If the file is linked, the edits you are about to do can be done in 
Photoshop and then updated in Illustrator. But sometimes you may want to embed 
the image so that you don’t have to worry about keeping track of a linked image.
6 With the berries.psd still selected on the artboard, choose Edit > Copy and 
then Edit > Paste In Front. With the new copy selected, choose Object > 
Hide > Selection.
7 With the Selection tool, click to select the original berries image. Click the 
Embed button in the Control panel.
If the berries.psd image had layers in Photoshop, the Photoshop Import Options 
dialog box would open when you embed it, allowing you to set options for 
embedding the image. On the left end of the Control panel, you will now see the 
word “Embedded.”
8 With the image still selected, choose Edit > Edit Colors > Adjust Color Balance.
9 In the Adjust Colors dialog box, drag the sliders or enter values for the CMYK 
percentages to change the colors in the image. You can press Tab to move 
between the text fields. We used the following values to create more of a red 
cast: C=-30, M=-30, Y=-30, and K=0. Feel free to experiment a little. Select 
Preview so that you can see the color changes. Click OK.
 Note:  To see the results, you may need to select and deselect Preview as you change options in 
the Adjust Colors dialog box.
	Note:  If you later decide to adjust the colors of the same image by choosing Edit > Edit Colors > 
Adjust Color Balance, the color values will be set to 0 (zero).
10 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.

LESSON 15 
Combining Illustrator CS6 Graphics with Other Adobe Applications
Masking an image
Clipping paths, or masks, crop an image so that only a portion of the image appears 
through the shape of the mask. Only vector objects can be clipping paths; however, 
any artwork can be masked. You can also import masks created in Photoshop files. 
The clipping path and the masked object are referred to as the clipping set.
Applying a simple clipping mask to an image
In this short section, you’ll create a simple clipping mask for the berries.psd image.
1 With the Selection tool ( ), click the berries.psd image to select it. Click the 
Mask button in the Control panel. This applies a clipping mask to the image in 
the shape and size of the image.
 Tip:  Another way to create a mask is to use the Draw Inside mode. This mode allows you to draw 
inside the selected object. The Draw Inside mode can eliminate the need to perform multiple tasks, 
such as drawing and altering stacking order or drawing, selecting, and creating a clipping mask. To 
learn more about the drawing modes, see Lesson 3, “Creating and Editing Shapes.”
2 In the Layers panel, click the triangle ( ) 
to the left of the Berries layer to reveal 
its contents, if you haven’t already done 
so. You may need to drag the bottom of 
the Layers panel down or scroll in the 
panel. Click the triangle to the left of 
the <Clip Group> Sublayer to reveal its 
contents as well.
	Note:  You may need to drag the left edge of the Layers panel to the left to see the full names, 
like we did for the figure.
Notice the <Clipping Path> sublayer. This is the mask you created by clicking 
the Mask button in the Control panel. The <Clip Group> sublayer is the 
clipping set that contains the mask and the object that is masked.
Next, you will edit this simple mask.
Editing a mask
In order to edit a clipping path, you need to be able to select it. Illustrator offers 
several ways to do this.
1 With the berries image still selected on the artboard, click the Edit Contents 
button (
) in the Control panel and, in the Layers panel, notice that the 
berries.psd sublayer (in the <Clip Group>) is showing the selected-art indicator 
(blue box). Click the Edit Clipping Path button (
) in the Control panel, and 
notice that the <Clipping Path> is showing the selected-art indicator (blue box) 
in the Layers panel.
	Note:  You can also 
apply a clipping mask 
by choosing Object > 
Clipping Mask > Make.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  437
When an object is masked, you can edit either the mask, the object that is 
masked, or both. Use these two buttons to select which to edit. When you first 
click to select an object that is masked, you will edit both the mask and the 
masked object.
2 With the Edit Clipping Path button (
) selected in the Control panel, choose 
View > Outline.
3 Use the Selection tool ( ) to drag 
the bottom, middle bounding 
point of the selected mask up 
to snap the bottom edge of the 
clipping path to the top edge of 
the corn image (the line above 
the word “LOCAL”).
4 Choose View > Preview.
5 With the Selection tool, press 
and hold the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key, and then 
click and drag the right, middle bounding point to the left. Drag until it snaps to 
the red bleed guide. Release the mouse button and then the key.
6 In the Control panel, click the Edit Contents button (
) to edit the berries.psd 
image, not the mask. With the Selection tool, drag the berries image up a little 
bit and release the mouse button. Notice that you are moving the image and not 
the mask.
7 Choose Edit > Undo Move to put the image back where it was.
With the Edit Contents button (
) selected, you can apply many 
transformations to the image, including scaling, moving, rotating, and more.
8 In the Layers panel, click the triangle ( ) to the left of the <Clip Group> 
sublayer to hide its contents.
9 Choose Select > Deselect and then File > Save.
 Tip:  You can also 
edit a clipping path with 
transformation options 
like rotate, skew, etc., 
or by using the Direct 
Selection tool ( ).

Combining Illustrator CS6 Graphics with Other Adobe Applications
Masking an object with a shape
In this section, you’ll create a mask for the carrots.psd image in the shape of a 
circle. In order to create a mask from a shape you draw, the shape needs to be on 
top of the image, as you’ll see.
1 In the Layers panel, click the visibility column to the left of the layer named 
Woman, to reveal its contents.
2 With the Selection tool ( ), click to select the carrots.psd image on the artboard.
3 Choose Object > Arrange > Send To Back. You should see the white circle as well.
4 Drag a selection marquee across the white circle and carrots.psd image in the 
lower-right corner of the artboard to select them both.
5 Choose Object > Clipping Mask > Make.
Both objects selected	
The carrots.psd image masked
You can edit the carrots.psd image and the clipping mask separately, just as you 
did previously with the masked berries image.
 Tip:  You can use text as a clipping mask, if you like. Just create the text, ensure that it’s on top of 
the content to be masked, and then choose Object > Clipping Mask > Make.
6 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.
Masking an object with multiple shapes
In this section, you’ll create a mask for the hidden berries.psd image from text that 
has been converted to outlines. In order to create a clipping mask with multiple 
shapes, the shapes need to be converted to a compound path.
1 Choose View > Fit Artboard In Window, if necessary.
2 In the Layers panel, click the triangle ( ) to the left of the Background layer to 
collapse it, if necessary. Scroll up in the Layers panel, if necessary, to see the 
contents of the Berries layer. Notice that the berries.psd sublayer is hidden.
3 Click the visibility column to the left of the berries.psd sublayer to show the 
image on the artboard.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  439
4 Click the selection column to the right of the <Group> sublayer at the bottom 
of the Berries layer. You should see what look like text outlines on the artboard. 
Choose Object > Arrange > Bring To Front.
With the “FRESH” text shapes selected, you can see the word “Group” on the 
left end of the Control panel. This was text that was converted to outlines 
(Type > Create Outlines) so that the letter shapes could each be edited, if necessary.
5 Choose Object > Compound Path > Make.
Notice that the group of letter shapes are placed into one sublayer, called 
<Compound Path> in the Layers panel. Leave the new compound path selected. 
The Compound Path command creates a single compound object from two or 
more objects. Compound paths act as grouped objects. The Compound Path 
command lets you create complex objects more easily than if you used the 
drawing tools or the Pathfinder commands.
	Note:  In order to make a compound path from multiple objects, they don’t need to be grouped.
6 With the compound path still 
selected, Shift-click the berries 
image on the artboard to select 
both. Right-click (Windows) or 
Ctrl-click (Mac OS), and choose 
Make Clipping Mask.
Notice the Edit Clipping Path 
button (
) and the Edit Contents 
button (
) that now show in the Control panel. This creates a clip group from 
the FRESH group and the berries.psd image.
7 With the FRESH clip group still selected, click the Graphic Styles panel icon (
) 
to expand the panel. Click the Large text graphic style to apply a drop shadow 
to the group.
 Tip:  To make the 
letter shapes into a 
compound path, you 
can also position the 
pointer over the letter 
shapes and right-
click or Control-click 
and choose Make 
Compound Path.
 Tip:  You can also 
choose Object > 
Clipping Mask > Make.

8 Click the Stroke panel icon (
) to expand the Stroke panel. Change the Stroke 
weight to 3 pt and, if necessary, change the stroke color to white by selecting 
the Stroke box in the Tools panel and choosing the White swatch from the 
Swatches panel.
9 Choose Select > Deselect, and then 
choose File > Save.
Creating an opacity mask
An opacity mask is different from a clipping mask, because it allows you to not only 
mask an object but also to alter the transparency of artwork. An opacity mask is 
made and edited using the Transparency panel.
In this section, you’ll create an opacity mask for the market.psd image so that it 
fades into the blue color of the background shape.
1 Open the Layers panel and click the triangle 
( ) to the left of the Berries layer to collapse it.
2 Click the eye icon (
) to the left of the Berries, 
Corn, and Woman layers. Click the visibility 
column to the left of the Background layer to 
see its contents. Select the Background layer.
3 Select the Rectangle tool (
) in the Tools 
panel, and click in the approximate center of 
the artboard. In the Rectangle dialog box, change the Width to 8.75 in and the 
Height to 4.2 in. Click OK. This will become the mask.
	Note:  The object that is to become the opacity mask (the masking object) needs to be the 
top selected object in the artboard. If it is a single object, like a rectangle, it does not need to be a 
compound path. If the opacity mask is to be made from multiple objects, they need to be grouped.
4 Press the letter D to set the default stroke and fill.
5 Select the Selection tool ( ), and drag the rectangle so that the bottom of the 
rectangle snaps to the bottom, red bleed guide and the center of the artboard. 
Leave the rectangle selected.
6 Press the Shift key, and click the market.psd image to select it as well.
7 Click the Transparency panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to 
expand the Transparency panel. Click the Make Mask button.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  441
After clicking the Make Mask button, the button now shows as Release. If you 
were to click the button again, the image would no longer be masked.

Editing an opacity mask
Next, you’ll adjust the opacity mask that you just created.
1 In the Transparency panel, Shift-click the mask 
thumbnail (as indicated by the white rectangle on 
the black background) to disable the mask.
Notice that a red X appears on the mask in 
the Transparency panel and that the entire 
market.psd image reappears in the Document window.
2 In the Transparency panel, Shift-click the mask thumbnail to enable the 
mask again.
3 Click to select the mask thumbnail on the right 
side of the Transparency panel.
Clicking the opacity mask in the Transparency 
panel selects the mask (the rectangle path) on 
the artboard. If the mask isn’t selected, click to 
select it with the Selection tool ( ). With the mask selected, you can’t edit other 
artwork on the artboard. Also, notice that the document tab shows (<Opacity 
Mask>/Opacity Mask), indicating that you are now editing the mask.
4 Click the Layers panel icon (
) on the right side of the workspace to reveal the 
Layers panel. In the Layers panel, notice that the layer <Opacity Mask> appears, 
indicating that the mask is selected, rather than the artwork that is being masked.
5 With the mask selected in the Transparency panel and on the artboard, in the 
Control panel, click the Fill color and select a white-to-black linear gradient, 
called White, Black.
 Tip:  To disable and 
enable an opacity mask, 
you can also choose 
Disable Opacity Mask 
or Enable Opacity Mask 
from the Transparency 
panel menu.

442 
LESSON 15

You will now see that where there is white in the mask, the market.psd image is 
showing, and where there is black, it is hidden. The gradient between gradually 
reveals the image from black to white.
6 Choose View > Hide Gradient Annotator.
7 Make sure that the Fill box is selected toward the bottom of the Tools panel.
8 Select the Gradient tool (
) in the Tools panel. Holding down the Shift key, 
position the pointer in the center of the mask (horizontally and vertically) and 
then click and drag up to the top of the mask shape, as shown in the figure. 
Release the mouse button, and then release the Shift key.
9 Click the Transparency panel icon (
), and notice how the mask has changed 
appearance in the Transparency panel.
10 Choose View > Show Gradient Annotator.
Next, you’ll move the image but not the opacity mask. With the image thumbnail 
selected in the Transparency panel, both the image and the mask are linked 
together, by default, so that if you move the image, the mask moves as well.
11 In the Transparency panel, click the image thumbnail so that you are no longer 
editing the mask. Click the link icon (
) between the image thumbnail and the 
mask thumbnail. This allows you to move just the image or the mask, but not both.
12 With the Selection tool, begin dragging the market.psd image down. As you 
drag, press and hold the Shift key to constrain the movement vertically. Release 
the mouse button and then the key to see where it is positioned. Drag until it 
looks approximately like the figure, always releasing the mouse button and then 
the key.
 Note:  You only 
have access to the 
link icon when the 
image thumbnail, not 
the mask thumbnail, 
is selected in the 
Transparency panel.
 Note:  The position 
of the market.psd does 
not have to match the 
figure exactly.

thumbnail and the mask thumbnail. 
14 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.
Sampling colors in placed images
You can sample, or copy, the colors in placed images to apply the colors to other 
objects in the artwork. Sampling colors enables you to easily make colors consistent 
in a file that combines images and Illustrator artwork.
1 In the Layers panel, make sure that all of the 
layers are collapsed, and then click the visibility 
column to the left of the Banner, Berries, Corn, 
and Woman layers to show their contents on 
the artboard.
2 With the Selection tool ( ) selected, click 
the white banner shape behind the 
“MERIDIEN” text.
3 Make sure that the Fill box is selected toward the bottom of the Tools panel.
4 Select the Eyedropper tool (
) in the
Tools panel, and Shift-click the top green 
area in the top of the C in “LOCAL,” to 
sample and apply a green color from the 
corn image.
You can try sampling the color of 
different images and content if you want. 
The color you sample is applied to the 
selected shape.
5 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose File > Save.
Working with image links
When you place images in Illustrator and either link to them or embed them, you 
can see a listing of these images in the Links panel. You use the Links panel to see 
and manage all linked or embedded artwork. The panel displays a small thumbnail 
of the artwork and uses icons to indicate the artwork’s status. From the Links panel, 
you can view the images that are linked to and embedded, replace a placed image, 
update a linked image that has been edited outside of Illustrator, or edit a linked 
image in the original application, such as Photoshop.
 Note:  Using the 
Shift key with the 
Eyedropper tool allows 
you to apply only 
the sampled color to 
the selected object. 
If you don’t use the 
Shift key, you apply all 
appearance attributes 
to the selected object.

Finding link information
When you place images, it can be helpful to see where the original image is located, 
what transformations have been applied to the image (such as rotation and scale), 
and more information.
1 Choose Window > Links.
Looking in the Links panel, you will see a listing of all of the images you’ve 
placed. Images with a name to the right of the image thumbnail are linked, and 
those images without a name are embedded. You can also tell if an image has 
been embedded by the embedded icon ( ).
2 Double-click the berries.psd image (which shows the name to the right of the 
thumbnail) to open the Link Information dialog box.
In the Link Information dialog box, you will see information, such as the 
original location of the image, the kind of file, modification and creation dates, 
transformation information, and more.
3 Click OK to close the Link Information dialog box.
4 Scroll down in the Links panel, and select the carrots.psd file in the list.
5 Click the Go To Link button (
) at the bottom 
of the Links panel. The carrots.psd image will be 
selected and centered in the Document window.
6 Click the orange link text “Linked File” in the 
Control panel to open the Links panel.
This is another way to access the Links panel. If 
you select a linked image or the image content of a Clip Group, you will see the 
text “Linked File.”
7 In the Control panel, click the filename 
carrots.psd to reveal a menu of options.

ADOBE ILLUSTRATOR CS6 CLASSROOM IN A BOOK  445
The menu of options that appears mirrors those options found in the Links panel. 
If you were to select an embedded image, you would instead see the link named 
Embedded in the Control panel. Clicking that orange link would show the same 
menu options but with some of them inaccessible.
8 Press the Escape key to hide the menu and leave the image selected.
Replacing a linked image
You can easily replace a linked or embedded image with another image to update 
the artwork. The replacement image is positioned exactly where the original 
image was, so no adjustment should be necessary if the new image is of the same 
dimensions. If you scaled the image that you are replacing, you may need to resize 
the replacement image to match the original.
Next, you will replace the selected carrots.psd image with another image.
1 In the Links panel, with carrots.psd selected, 
click the Relink button (
) at the bottom of 
the panel.
2 In the Place dialog box, navigate to the 
woman.psd image in the images folder in the 
Lesson15 folder and select it. Make sure that the 
Link option is selected. Click Place to replace the 
carrots image with the new one.
The replacement image (woman.psd) appears on the artboard in place of the 
carrots.psd image. When you replace an image, any color adjustments made to 
the original image are not applied to the replacement. However, masks applied to 
the original image are preserved. Any layer modes and transparency adjustments 
that you’ve made to other layers also may affect the image’s appearance.
3 Close the Links panel group.
4 With the Selection tool ( ) selected, click 
the Edit Contents button (
) in the Control 
panel. Drag the new woman.psd image until 
it is positioned as you see in the figure.
5 Click the Edit Clipping Path button (
) in 
the Control panel.
6 In the Control panel, change the Stroke color 
to white and the Stroke weight to 3 pt.
7 Choose Select > Deselect, and then choose 
File > Save.
 Tip:  You can also 
press the arrow keys 
on the keyboard to 
reposition the image.

Exporting a layered file to Photoshop
Not only can you open layered Photoshop files in Illustrator, but you can also 
save layered Illustrator files and then open them in Photoshop. Moving layered 
files between Illustrator and Photoshop is helpful when creating and editing web 
or print graphics. You can preserve the hierarchical relationship of the layers by 
selecting the Write Layers option when saving your file. You can also open and edit 
type objects.
1 With the marketposter.ai file still open, choose File > Export.
2 Choose Photoshop (*.PSD) from the Save As Type menu (Windows) or 
Photoshop (psd) from the Format menu (Mac OS). Navigate to the folder where 
you’ll save the file, and name the file marketposter.psd. Click Save (Windows) 
or Export (Mac OS).
3 In the Photoshop Export Options dialog box, make sure that CMYK is the 
Color Model, select High (300 ppi) for the resolution, and make sure that Write 
Layers is selected. Leave the rest of the settings at their defaults. Preserve Text 
Editability is grayed out because all the text was already converted to outlines. 
Click OK.
	Note:  After clicking OK, you may need to give it some time to save the file.
 Tip:  You can also copy and paste or drag and drop from Illustrator to Photoshop. When you copy

Review answers
1 A linked file is a separate, external file connected to the Illustrator file by an electronic 
link. A linked file does not add significantly to the size of the Illustrator file. The 
linked file must accompany the Illustrator file to preserve the link and ensure that the 
placed file appears when you open the Illustrator file. An embedded file is included in 
the Illustrator file. The Illustrator file size reflects the addition of the embedded file. 
Because the embedded file is part of the Illustrator file, no link can be broken. You can 
update linked and embedded files using the Relink button in the Links panel.
2 A mask can be a simple or compound path. You can use type as a mask. You can 
import opacity masks with placed Photoshop files. You can also create layer clipping 
masks with any shape that is the topmost object of a group or layer.
3 You create an opacity mask by placing the object to be used as a mask on top of the 
object to be masked. Then, you select the mask and the objects to be masked and either 
click the Make Mask button in the Transparency panel or choose Make Opacity Mask 
from the Transparency panel menu.
4 You can use effects to change the color mode (RGB, CMYK, or grayscale) or adjust 
individual colors in a selected object. You can also saturate or desaturate colors or 
invert colors in a selected object. You can apply color modifications to placed images, 
as well as to artwork created in Illustrator.
5 To replace a placed image, select the image in the Links panel. Then, click the Relink 
button and locate and select the replacement image. Click Place.
