1. Extensions of Fields
1.1. Deﬁnitions. A ﬁeld is a set F with two composition laws + and · such that
(a) (F, +) is an abelian group;
(b) let F × = F −{0}; then (F ×, ·) is an abelian group;
(c) (distributive law) for all a, b, c ∈F, (a + b)c = ac + bc (hence also a(b + c) = ab + ac).
Equivalently, a ﬁeld is a nonzero commutative ring (meaning with 1) such that every nonzero
element has an inverse. A ﬁeld contains at least two distinct elements, 0 and 1. The smallest,
and one of the most important, ﬁelds is F2 = Z/2Z = {0, 1}.
Lemma 1.1. A commutative ring R is a ﬁeld if and only if it has no ideals other than (0)
and R.
Proof. Suppose R is a ﬁeld, and let I be a nonzero ideal in R. If a is a nonzero element
of I, then 1 = a−1a ∈I, and so I = R. Conversely, suppose R is a commutative ring with
no nontrivial ideals; if a ̸= 0, then (a) = R, which means that there is a b in F such that
ab = 1.
Example 1.2. The following are ﬁelds: Q, R, C, Fp = Z/pZ.
A homomorphism of ﬁelds α : F →F ′ is simply a homomorphism of rings, i.e., it is a map
with the properties
α(a + b) = α(a) + α(b),
α(ab) = α(a)α(b),
α(1) = 1,
all a, b ∈F.
Such a homomorphism is always injective, because the kernel is a proper ideal (it doesn’t
contain 1), which must therefore be zero.
1.2. The characteristic of a ﬁeld. The map
Z →F,
n 
→1F + 1F + · · · + 1F
(ntimes),
is a homomorphism of rings.
Case 1: Kernel = (0); then n · 1F = 0 =⇒n = 0 (in Z). The map Z →F extends to a
homomorphism Q →F, m
n 
→(m · 1F )(n · 1F )−1. Thus F contains a copy of Q. In this case,
we say that F has characteristic zero.
Case 2: Kernel ̸= (0), i.e., n · 1F = 0 some n ̸= 1.
The smallest such n will be a
prime p (else F will have nonzero zero-divisors), and p generates the kernel. In this case,
{m · 1F | m ∈Z} ≈Fp, and F contains a copy of Fp. We say that F has characteristic p.
The ﬁelds Fp, p prime, and Q are called the prime ﬁelds. Every ﬁeld contains a copy of
one of them.
Remark 1.3. The binomial theorem
(a + b)m = am +
m
1

am−1b + · · · +
m
r

am−rbr + · · · + bm
holds in any ring. If p is prime, then p|
p
r

for all r, 1 ≤r ≤p −1. Therefore, when F has
characteristic p, (a + b)p = ap + bp. Hence a 
→ap is a homomorphism F →F, called the
Frobenius endomorphism of F. When F is ﬁnite, it is an isomorphism, called the Frobenius
automorphism.

1.3. The polynomial ring F[X]. I shall assume everyone knows the following (see Jacob-
son Chapter II, or Math 593).
(a) Let I be a nonzero ideal in F[X]. If f(X) is a nonzero polynomial of least degree in I,
then I = (f(X)). When we choose f to be monic, i.e., to have leading coeﬃcient one, it is
uniquely determined by I. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the nonzero ideals
of F[X] and the monic polynomials in F[X]. The prime ideals correspond to the irreducible
monic polynomials.
(b) Division algorithm: given f(X) and g(X) ∈F[X] with g ̸= 0, we can ﬁnd q(X) and
r(X) ∈F[X] with deg(r) < deg(g) such that f = gq + r; moreover, q(X) and r(X) are
uniquely determined. Thus the ring F[X] is a Euclidean domain.
(c) Euclid’s algorithm: Let f and g ∈F[X] have gcd d(X); the algorithm gives polynomials
a(X) and b(X) such that
a(X) · f(X) + b(X) · g(X) = d(X),
deg(a) ≤deg(g),
deg(b) ≤deg(f).
Recall how it goes. Using the division algorithm, we construct a sequence of quotients and
remainders:
f
=
q0g + r0
g
=
q1r0 + r1
r0
=
q2r1 + r2
· · ·
rn−2
=
qnrn−1 + rn
rn−1
=
qn+1rn.
Then rn = gcd(f, g), and
rn = rn−2 −qnrn−1 = rn−2 −qn(rn−3 −qn−1rn−2) = · · · = af + bg.
Maple knows Euclid’s algorithm—to learn its syntax, type “?gcdex;”.
(d) Since F[X] is an integral domain, we can form its ﬁeld of fractions F(X). It consists
of quotients f(X)/g(X), f and g polynomials, g ̸= 0.
1.4. Factoring polynomials. It will frequently be important for us to know whether a
polynomial is irreducible and, if it isn’t, what its factors are. The following results help.
Proposition 1.4. Suppose r = c
d, c, d ∈Z, gcd(c, d) = 1, is a root of a polynomial
amXm + am−1Xm−1 + · · · + a0,
ai ∈Z.
Then c|a0 and d|am.
Proof. It is clear from the equation
amcm + am−1cm−1d + · · · + a0dm = 0
that d|amcm, and therefore, d|am. The proof that c|a0 is similar.
Example 1.5. The polynomial X3−3X−1 is irreducible in Q[X] because its only possible
roots are ±1 (and they aren’t).
Proposition 1.6. Let f(X) ∈Z[X] be such that its coeﬃcients have greatest common
divisor 1. If f(X) factors nontrivially in Q[X], then it factors nontrivially in Z[X]; moreover,
if f(X) ∈Z[X] is monic, then any monic factor of f(X) in Q[X] lies in Z[X].

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY

Proof. Use Gauss’s lemma (see Jacobson, 2.16, or Math 593).
Proposition 1.7. (Eisenstein criterion) Let
f = amXm + am−1Xm−1 + · · · + a0,
ai ∈Z;
suppose that there is a prime p such that:
p does not divide am,
p divides am−1, ..., a0,
p2 does not divide a0.
Then f is irreducible in Q[X].
Proof. We may remove any common factor from the coeﬃcients f, and hence assume
that they have gcd = 1. Therefore, if f(X) factors in Q[X], it factors in Z[X]:
amXm + am−1Xm−1 + · · · + a0 = (bnXn + · · · + b0)(crXr + · · · + c0),
bi, ci ∈Z,
n, r < m.
Since p, but not p2, divides a0 = b0c0, p must divide exactly one of b0, c0, say p divides b0.
Now from the equation
a1 = b0c1 + b1c0,
we see that p|b1. Now from the equation
a2 = b0c2 + b1c1 + b2c0,
we see that p|b2.
By continuing in this way, we ﬁnd that p divides b0, b1, . . . , bn, which
contradicts the fact that p does not divide am.
The above three propositions hold with Z replaced by any unique factorization domain.
Proposition 1.8. There is an algorithm for factoring a polynomial in Q[X].
Proof. Consider f(X) ∈Q[X]. Multiply f(X) by an integer, so that it is monic, and
then replace it by Ddeg(f)f( X
D), D = a common denominator for the coeﬃcients of f, to obtain
a monic polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Thus we need consider only polynomials
f(X) = Xm + a1Xm−1 + · · · + am,
ai ∈Z.
From the fundamental theorem of algebra (see later), we know that f splits completely in
C[X]:
f(X) =
m

i=1
(X −αi),
αi ∈C.
From the equation f(αi) = 0, it follows that |αi| is less than some bound M depending on
a1, . . . , am. Now if g(X) is a monic factor of f(X), then its roots in C are certain of the αi,
and its coeﬃcients are symmetric polynomials in its roots. Therefore the absolute values of
the coeﬃcients of g(X) are bounded. Since they are also integers (by 1.6), we see that there
are only ﬁnitely many possibilities for g(X). Thus, to ﬁnd the factors of f(X) we (better
Maple) only have to do a ﬁnite amount of checking.
One other observation is sometimes useful: Suppose that the leading coeﬃcient of f(X) ∈
Z[X] is not divisible by the prime p; if f(X) is irreducible in Fp[X], then it is irreducible
in Z[X]. Unfortunately, this test is not always eﬀective: for example, X4 −10X2 + 1 is
reducible1 modulo every prime, but it is irreducible in Q[X].
1I don’t know an elementary proof of this. One proof uses that its Galois group is ≈(Z/2Z)2.

Maple knows how to factor polynomials in Q[X] and in Fp[X]. For example
>factor(6*X^2+18*X-24); will ﬁnd the factors of 6X2 + 18X −24, and
>Factor(X^2+3*X+3) mod 7; will ﬁnd the factors of X2 +3X +3 modulo 7, i.e., in F7[X].
Thus, we need not concern ourselves with the problem of factorizing polynomials in Q[X] or
Fp[X].
1.5. Extension ﬁelds; degrees. A ﬁeld E containing a ﬁeld F is called an extension (ﬁeld)
of F. Such an E can be regarded (in an obvious fashion) as an F-vector space. We write
[E : F] for the dimension (possibly inﬁnite) of E as an F-vector space, and call [E : F] the
degree of E over F. We often say that E is ﬁnite over F when it has ﬁnite degree over F.
Example 1.9. (a) The ﬁeld of complex numbers C has degree 2 over R (basis {1, i}).
(b) The ﬁeld of real numbers R has inﬁnite degree over Q. (We know Q is countable,
which implies that any ﬁnite-dimensional vector space over Q is countable; but R is not
countable. More explicitly, one can ﬁnd real numbers α such that 1, α, α2, . . . are linearly
independent (see section 1.9 below)).
(c) The ﬁeld of Gaussian numbers Q(i) =df {a + bi ∈C | a, b ∈Q} has degree 2 over Q
(basis {1, i}).
(d) The ﬁeld F(X) has inﬁnite degree over F. (It contains the F-subspace F[X], which
has the inﬁnite basis {1, X, X2, . . .}.)
Proposition 1.10. Let L ⊃E ⊃F (all ﬁelds). Then L/F is of ﬁnite degree ⇐⇒L/E
and E/F are both of ﬁnite degree, in which case
[L : F] = [L : E][E : F].
Proof. Assume that L/E and E/F are of ﬁnite degree, and let {ei} be a basis for E/F
and {ℓj} a basis for L/E. I claim that {eiℓj} is a basis for L over F. I ﬁrst show that it
spans L. Let γ ∈L. Then, because {ℓj} spans L as an E-vector space,
γ =

αjℓj,
some αj ∈E,
and because {ei} spans E as an F-vector space, for each j,
αj =

aijei,
some aij ∈F.
On putting these together, we ﬁnd that
γ =

aijeiℓj.
Next I show that {eiℓj} is linearly independent. A linear relation  aijeiℓj = 0 can be
rewritten 
j(
i aijei)ℓj = 0. The linear independence of the ℓj’s now shows that 
i aijei =
0 for each j, and the linear independence of the ei’s now shows that each aij = 0.
Conversely, if L is of ﬁnite degree over F, then it is certainly of ﬁnite degree over E.
Moreover, E, being a subspace of a ﬁnite dimensional F-space, is also ﬁnite dimensional.
1.6. Construction of some extensions. Let f(X) ∈F[X] be a monic polynomial of
degree m, and let (f) be the ideal generated by f. Consider the quotient ring F[X]/(f(X)),
and write x for the image of X in F[X]/(f(X)), i.e., x is the coset X + (f(X)). Then:
(a) The map
P(X) 
→P(x) : F[X] →F[x]

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY

is a surjective homomorphism; we have f(x) = 0.
(b) From the division algorithm, we know each element g of F[X]/(f) is represented by a
unique polynomial r of degree < m. Hence each element of F[x] can be written uniquely as
a sum
a0 + a1x + · · · + am−1xm−1,
ai ∈F,
(*).
(c) The addition of two elements, written in the form (*), is obvious.
(d) To multiply two elements in the form (*), multiply in the usual way, and use the
relation f(x) = 0 to express the monomials of degree ≥m in x in terms of lower degree
monomials.
(e) Now assume f(X) is irreducible. To ﬁnd the inverse of an element α ∈F[x], write α
in the form (*), i.e., set α = g(x) where g(X) is a polynomial of degree ≤m −1. Then use
Euclid’s algorithm in F[X] to obtain polynomials a(X) and b(X) such that
a(X)f(X) + b(X)g(X) = d(X)
with d(X) the gcd of f and g.
In our case, d(X) is 1 because f(X) is irreducible and
deg g(X) < deg f(X). On replacing X with x in the equation, we ﬁnd b(x)g(x) = 1. Hence
b(x) is the inverse of g(x).
Conclusion: For any monic irreducible polynomial f(X) ∈F[X], F[x] = F[X]/(f(X)) is
a ﬁeld of degree m over F. Moreover, if we know how to compute in F, then we know how
to compute in F[x].
Example 1.11. Let f(X) = X2 + 1 ∈R[X]. Then R[x] has:
elements: a + bx, a, b ∈R;
addition: obvious;
multiplication: (a + bx)(a′ + b′x) = (aa′ −bb′) + (ab′ + a′b)x.
We usually write i for x and C for R[x].
Example 1.12. Let f(X) = X3 −3X −1 ∈Q[X]. This is irreducible over Q, and so
Q[x] has basis {1, x, x2} as a Q-vector space. Let
β = x4 + 2x3 + 3 ∈Q[x].
Then using that x3 −3x −1 = 0, we ﬁnd that β = 3x2 + 7x + 5. Because X3 −3X −1 is
irreducible,
gcd(X3 −3X −1, 3X2 + 7X + 5) = 1.
In fact, Euclid’s algorithm (courtesy of Maple) gives
(X3 −3X −1)( −7
37 X + 29
111) + (3X2 + 7X + 5)( 7
111X2 −26
111X + 28
111) = 1.
Hence
(3x2 + 7x + 5)( 7
111x2 −26
111x + 28
111) = 1;
we have found the inverse of β.
1.7. Generators of extension ﬁelds. Let E be an extension ﬁeld of F, and let S be a
subset of E. The intersection of all the subrings of E containing F and S is again a subring
of E (containing F and S). We call it the subring of E generated by F and S, and we write
it F[S].

J.S. MILNE
Lemma 1.13. The ring F[S] consists of all the elements of E that can be written as ﬁnite
sums of the form

ai1···inαi1
1 · · · αin
n ,
ai1···in ∈F,
αi ∈S.
(*)
Proof. Let R be the set of all such elements; it is easy to check that R is a ring containing
F and S, and that any ring containing F and S contains R; therefore R equals F[S].
Note that the expression of an element in the form (*) will not be unique in general. When
S = {α1, ..., αn}, we write F[α1, ..., αn] for F[S].
Lemma 1.14. Let E ⊃R ⊃F with E and F ﬁelds and R a ring. If R is ﬁnite-dimensional
when regarded as an F-vector space, then it is a ﬁeld.
Proof. Let α be a nonzero element of R—we have to show that α is invertible. The map
x 
→αx : R →R is an injective F-linear map, and is therefore surjective. In particular,
there is an element β ∈R such that αβ = 1.
Example 1.15. An element of Q[π], π = 3.14159..., can be written uniquely as a ﬁnite
sum
a0 + a1π + a2π2 + · · · ,
ai ∈Q.
An element of Q[i] can be written uniquely in the form a + bi, a, b ∈Q.
(Everything
considered in C.)
Let E again be an extension ﬁeld of F and S a subset of E. The subﬁeld F(S) of E
generated by F and S is the intersection of all subﬁelds of E containing F and S. It is
equal to the ﬁeld of fractions of F[S] (since this is a ﬁeld containing F and S, and is the
smallest such ﬁeld). Lemma 1.14 shows that F[S] is sometimes already a ﬁeld, in which case
F(S) = F[S]. We write F(α1, ..., αn) for F(S) when S = {α1, ..., αn}.
Thus: F[α1, . . . , αn] consists of all elements of E that can be expressed as polynomials in
the αi with coeﬃcients in F, and F(α1, . . . , αn) consists of all elements of E that can be
expressed as quotients of two such polynomials.
Example 1.16. An element of Q(π) can be expressed as a quotient
g(π)/h(π),
g(X), h(X) ∈Q[X],
h(π) ̸= 0.
The ring Q[i] is already a ﬁeld.
An extension E of F is said to be simple if E = F(α) some α ∈E. For example, Q(π)
and Q[i] are simple extensions of Q.
When F and F ′ are subﬁelds of E, then we write F · F ′ for F(F ′)(= F ′(F)), and we call
it the composite of F and F ′. It is the smallest subﬁeld of E containing both F and F ′.
1.8. Algebraic and transcendental elements. Let E be an extension ﬁeld of F, and let
α ∈E. Then we have a homomorphism
f(X) 
→f(α) : F[X] →E.
There are two possibilites.
Case 1: The kernel of the map is (0), i.e.,
f(α) = 0,
f(X) ∈F[X] =⇒f(X) = 0.

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
7
In this case we say that α transcendental over F. The isomorphism F[X] →F[α] extends
to an isomorphism F(X) →F(α).
Case 2: The kernel is ̸= (0), i.e., g(α) = 0 for some nonzero g(X) ∈F[X]. We then say
that α is algebraic over F. Let f(X) be the monic polynomial generating the kernel of the
map. It is irreducible (if f = gh is a proper factorization, then g(α)h(α) = f(α) = 0, but
g(α) ̸= 0 ̸= h(α)). We call f the minimum polynomial of α over F. It is characterized as an
element of F[X] by each of the following sets of conditions:
f is monic; f(α) = 0; g(α) = 0 and g ∈F[X] =⇒f|g;
f is the monic polynomial of least degree such f(α) = 0;
f is monic, irreducible, and f(α) = 0.
Note that g(X) 
→g(α) induces an isomorphism F[X]/(f) →F[α]. Since the ﬁrst is a ﬁeld,
so also is the second: F(α) = F[α]. Moreover, each element of F[α] has a unique expression
a0 + a1α + a2α2 + · · · + am−1αm−1,
ai ∈F,
where m = deg(f).
In other words, 1, α, . . . , αm−1 is a basis for F[α] over F.
Hence
[F(α) : F] = m. Since F[x] ≈F[α], arithmetic in F[α] can be performed using the same
rules as in F[x].
Example 1.17. Let α ∈C be such that α3 −3α −1 = 0. The minimum polynomial of α
over Q is X3 −3X −1 (because this polynomial is monic, irreducible, and has α as a root).
The set {1, α, α2} is a basis for Q[α] over Q. The calculations in an example above show
that if β is the element α4 + 2α3 + 3 of Q[α], then β = 3α2 + 7α + 5, and
β−1 =
7
111α2 −26
111α + 28
111.
Remark 1.18. Maple knows how to compute in Q[α]. For example,
factor(X^4+4); returns the factorization
(X2 −2X + 2)(X2 + 2X + 2).
Now type: alias(c=RootOf(X^2+2*X+2);. Then
factor(X^4+4,c); returns the factorization
(X + c)(X −2 −c)(X + 2 + c)(X −c),
i.e., Maple has factored X4 + 4 in Q[c] where c has minimum polynomial X2 + 2X + 2.
An extension E/F is algebraic if all elements of E are algebraic over F; otherwise it is
transcendental over F.
Proposition 1.19. (a) If [E : F] is ﬁnite, then E is algebraic over F.
(b) If E is algebraic over F and ﬁnitely generated (as a ﬁeld), then [E : F] is ﬁnite.
Proof. (a) If α were transcendental over F, then 1, α, α2, . . . would be linearly indepen-
dent over F.
(b) Let E = F[α1, ..., αn]; then F[α1] is ﬁnite over F (because α1 is algebraic over F);
F[α1, α2] is ﬁnite over F[α1] (because α2 is algebraic over F, and hence F[α1]).
Hence
F[α1, α2] is ﬁnite over F. This argument can be continued.
Corollary 1.20. If E is algebraic over F then any subring R of E containing F is a
ﬁeld.

8
J.S. MILNE
Proof. Let α ∈R; then F[α] is a ﬁeld and F[α] ⊂R. Therefore α has an inverse in
R.
A ﬁeld F is said to be algebraically closed if E algebraic over F implies E = F. Equivalent
condition: the only irreducible polynomials in F[X] are of degree one; every nonconstant
polynomial in F[X] has a root in F.
Example 1.21. The ﬁeld of complex numbers C is algebraically closed. The set of all
complex numbers algebraic over Q is an algebraically closed ﬁeld. Every ﬁeld F has an alge-
braically closed algebraic extension ﬁeld (which is unique up to a nonunique isomorphism).
All these statements will be proved later.
1.9. Transcendental numbers. A complex number is said to be algebraic or transcenden-
tal according as it is algebraic or transcendental over Q. First some history:
1844: Liouville showed that certain numbers (now called Liouville numbers) are transcen-
dental.
1873: Hermite showed that e is transcendental.
1873: Cantor showed that the set of algebraic numbers is countable, but that R is not
countable. [Thus almost all numbers are transcendental, but it is usually very diﬃcult to
prove that a particular number is transcendental.]
1882: Lindemann showed that π is transcendental.
1934: Gelfond-Schneider showed that if α and β are algebraic, α ̸= 0, 1, and β /∈Q, then
αβ is transcendental. (This was one of Hilbert’s famous problems)
1994: Euler’s constant
γ = lim
n→∞(
n

k=1

Proposition 1.22. The set of algebraic numbers is countable.
Proof. Deﬁne the height h(r) of a rational number to be max(|m|, |n|), where r = m/n
is the expression of r in its lowest terms. There are only ﬁnitely many rational numbers
with height less than a ﬁxed number N. Let A(N) be the set of algebraic numbers whose
minimum equation over Q is of degree ≤N and has coeﬃcients of height < N. Then A(N)
is ﬁnite for each N. Count the elements of A(10); then count the elements of A(100); then
count the elements of A(1000), and so on.

Proof. Suppose not, and let

be the minimum polynomial of α over Q. Thus [Q[α] : Q] = d. Let
f(X) =

ΣN →α as N →∞, and let xN = f(ΣN).
Because f(X) is irreducible in Q[X], it has no rational root, except possibly α; but ΣN ̸= α,
and so xN ̸= 0. (In fact α is obviously nonrational because its expansion to base 2 is not
periodic.)
Clearly xN ∈Q; in fact (2N!)dDxN ∈Z, and so
|(2N!)dDxN| ≥1.
On the other hand,
|xN| =

1.10. Constructions with straight-edge and compass. The Greeks understood that
integers and the rational numbers.
They were surprised to ﬁnd that the length of the
diagonal of a square of side 1, namely
√
2, is not rational. They thus realized that they needed
to extend their number system. They then hoped that the “constructible” numbers would
suﬃce. Suppose we are given a length, which we call 1, a straight-edge, and a compass (device
for drawing circles). A number (better a length) is constructible if it can be constructed by
forming successive intersections of
• lines drawn through two points already constructed, and
• circles with centre a point already constructed and radius a constructed length.
This led them to three famous problems that they were unable to solve: is it possible
to duplicate the cube, trisect an angle, or square the circle by straight-edge and compass
constructions? We’ll see that the answer to all three is negative.
Let F be a subﬁeld of R.
The F-plane is F × F ⊂R × R.
We make the following
deﬁnitions:
A line in the F-plane is a line through two points in the F-plane. Such a line is given by
an equation:
ax + by + c = 0,
a, b, c ∈F.

J.S. MILNE
A circle in the F-plane is a circle with centre an F-point and radius an element of F. Such
a circle is given by an equation:
(x −a)2 + (y −b)2 = c2,
a, b, c ∈F.
Lemma 1.24. Let L ̸= L′ be F-lines, and let C ̸= C′ be F-circles.
(a) L ∩L′ = ∅or consists of a single F-point.
(b) L ∩C = ∅or consists of one or two points in the F[√e]-plane, some e ∈F.
(c) C ∩C′ = ∅or consists of one or two points in the F[√e]-plane, some e ∈F.
Proof. The points in the intersection are found by solving the simultaneous equations,
and hence by solving (at worst) a quadratic equation with coeﬃcients in F.
Lemma 1.25. (a) If c and d are constructible, then so also are c ± d, cd, and c
d (d ̸= 0).
(b) If c > 0 is constructible, then so also is √c.
Proof. First show that it is possible to construct a line perpendicular to a given line
through a given point, and then a line parallel to a given line through a given point. Hence
it is possible to construct a triangle similar to a given one on a side with given length. By
an astute choice of the triangles, one constructs cd and c−1. For (b), draw a circle of radius
c+1
2
about (c+1
2 , 0), and draw a vertical line through the point A = (1, 0) to meet the circle
at P. The length AP is √c. (For more details, see for example, Rotman, Galois Theory,
Appendix 3.)
Theorem 1.26.
(a) The set of constructible numbers is a ﬁeld.
(b) A number α is constructible if and only if it is contained in ﬁeld of the form
Q[√a1, . . . , √ar],
ai ∈Q[√a1, . . . , √ai−1].
Proof. (a) Immediate from (a) of Lemma 1.25.
(b) From (a) we know that the set of constructible numbers is a ﬁeld containing Q, and
it follows from (a) and Lemma 1.25 that every number in Q[√a1, . . . , √ar] is constructible.
Conversely, it follows from Lemma 1.24 that every constructible number is in a ﬁeld of the
form Q[√a1, . . . , √ar].
Now we can apply the (not quite elementary) result Proposition 1.10 to obtain:
Corollary 1.27. If α is constructible, then α is algebraic over Q, and [Q[α] : Q] is a
power of 2.
Proof. We know that [Q[α] : Q] divides [Q[√a1, . . . , √ar] : Q] = 2r.
Corollary 1.28. It is impossible to duplicate the cube by straight-edge and compass
constructions.
Proof. The problem is to construct a cube with volume 2. This requires constructing
a root of the polynomial X3 −2 = 0. But this polynomial is irreducible (by Eisenstein’s
criterion for example), and so [Q[
3√
2] : Q] = 3.
Corollary 1.29. In general, it is impossible to trisect an angle by straight-edge and
compass constructions.

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
11
Proof. Knowing an angle is equivalent to knowing the cosine of the angle. Therefore, to
trisect 3α, we have to construct a solution to
cos 3α = 4 cos3 α −3 cos α.
For example, take 3α = 60; to construct α, we have to solve 8x3 −6x −1 = 0, which is
irreducible.
Corollary 1.30. It is impossible to square the circle by straight-edge and compass con-
structions.
Proof. A square with the same area as a circle of radius r has side √πr. Since π is
transcendental, so also is √π.
We now consider another famous old problem, that of constructing a regular polygon.
Note that Xm −1 is not irreducible; in fact
Xm −1 = (X −1)(Xm−1 + Xm−2 + · · · + 1).
Lemma 1.31. If p is prime then Xp−1 + · · · + 1 is irreducible; hence Q[e2πi/p] has degree
p −1 over Q.
Proof. Consider
f(X + 1) = (X + 1)p −1
X
= Xp−1 + · · · + a2X2 + a1X + p,
with ai =
 p
i+1

. Since p|ai, i = 1, ..., p−2, f(X+1) is irreducible by Eisenstein’s criterion.
In order to construct a regular p-gon, p an odd prime, we need to construct cos 2π
p . But
Q[e
2πi
p ] ⊃Q[cos 2π
p ] ⊃Q. The degree of Q[e
2πi
p ] over Q[cos 2π
p ] is 2—the equation
α2 −2 cos 2π
p · α + 1 = 0,
α = e
2πi
p ,
shows that it is ≤2, and it is not 1 because Q[e
2πi
p ] is not contained in R. Hence [Q[cos 2π
p ] :
Q] = p−1
2 .
Thus if the regular p-gon is constructible, then (p −1)/2 = 2k some k (later, we shall see
a converse), which imples p = 2k+1 + 1. But 2r + 1 can only be a prime if r is a power of 2,
because otherwise r has an odd factor t, and for t odd,
Y t + 1 = (Y + 1)(Y t−1 −Y t−2 + · · · + 1).
Thus if the regular p-gon is constructible, then p = 22k + 1 for some k. Fermat conjectured
that all numbers of the form 22k + 1 are prime, and claimed to show that this is true for
k ≤5—for this reason primes of this form are called Fermat primes. For 0 ≤k ≤4, the
numbers p = 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, are prime but Euler showed that 232 + 1 = 641 · 6700417,
and we don’t know of any more Fermat primes.

2. Splitting Fields; Algebraic Closures
2.1. Maps from simple extensions.
Let E and E′ be ﬁelds containing F.
An F-homomorphism is a homomorphism ϕ :
E →E′ such that ϕ(a) = a for all a ∈F. Thus an F-homorphism maps a polynomial
 ai1···imαi1
1 · · · αim
m , ai1···im ∈F, to

ai1···imϕ(α1)i1 · · · ϕ(αm)im.
An F-isomorphism is a bijective F-homomorphism. Note that if E and E′ have the same
ﬁnite degree over F, then an F-homomorphism is automatically an F-isomorphism.
Proposition 2.1. Let F(α) be a simple ﬁeld extension of a ﬁeld F, and let Ωbe a second
ﬁeld containing F.
(a) Assume α is transcendental over F; then for any F-homomorphism ϕ : F(α) →Ω, ϕ(α)
is transcendental over F, and the map ϕ 
→ϕ(α) deﬁnes a one-to-one correspondence
{F-homomorphisms ϕ : F(α) →Ω} ↔{ elements of Ωtranscendental over F}.
(b) Assume α is algebraic over F, with minimum polynomial f(X); then for any F-
homomorphism ϕ : F[α] →Ω, ϕ(α) is a root of f(X) in Ω, and the map ϕ 
→ϕ(α)
deﬁnes a one-to-one correspondence
{F-homomorphisms ϕ : F[α] →Ω} ↔{ distinct roots of f(X) in Ω}.
In particular, the number of such maps is the number of distinct roots of f in Ω.
Proof. (a) Let γ ∈Ω. To say that α is transcendental over F means that F[α] is the
ring of polynomials in α (as variable). By the universal property of polynomial rings, there
is a unique F-homomorphism ϕ : F[α] →Ωsending α to γ. This extends to F(α) if and
only if all nonzero elements of F[α] are sent to invertible (i.e., nonzero) elements of Ω, which
is so if and only if γ is transcendental.
(b) Let f(X) =  aiXi, and consider an F-homomorphism ϕ : F[α] →Ω. On applying
ϕ to the equation  aiαi = 0, we obtain the equation  aiϕ(α)i = 0, which shows that
γ =df ϕ(α) is a root of f(X) in Ω. Conversely, let γ ∈Ωbe a root of f(X). The map
F[X] →Ω, g(X) 
→g(γ), factors through F[X]/(f(X)). When composed with the inverse
of the isomorphism F[X]/(f(X)) →F[α], it becomes a homomorphism F[α] →Ωsending
α to γ.
We shall need a slight generalization of this result.
Proposition 2.2. Let F(α) be a simple ﬁeld extension of a ﬁeld F, and let ϕ0 : F →Ω
be a homomorphism of F into a second ﬁeld Ω.
(a) Assume α is transcendental over F; then the map ϕ 
→ϕ(α) deﬁnes a one-to-one
correspondence
{extensions ϕ : F(α) →Ωof ϕ0} ↔{elements of Ωtranscendental over ϕ0(F)}.
(b) Assume α is algebraic over F, with minimum polynomial f(X); then the map ϕ 
→ϕ(α)
deﬁnes a one-to-one correspondence
{extensions ϕ : F[α] →Ωof ϕ0} ↔{ distinct roots of (ϕ0f)(X)in Ω}.
In particular, the number of such maps is the number of distinct roots of ϕ0f in Ω.

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
13
Proof. The proof is essentially the same as that of the preceding proposition.
By ϕ0f we mean the polynomial obtained by applying ϕ0 to the coeﬃcients of f, i.e.,
f =  aiXi =⇒ϕ0f =  ϕ(ai)Xi.
2.2. Splitting ﬁelds.
Let f be a polynomial with coeﬃcients in F. A ﬁeld E containing F is said to split f if f
splits in E[X], i.e., if f(X) = (X −αi) with αi ∈E. If E is also generated by the αi, then
it is called a splitting ﬁeld for f.
Note that if f(X) =  fi(X)mi, then a splitting ﬁeld for  fi(X) is also a splitting ﬁeld
for f (and conversely).
Example 2.3. (a) Let f(X) = aX2 + bX + c ∈Q[X] be irreducible, and let α =
√
b2 −4ac; then the subﬁeld Q[α] of C generated by α is a splitting ﬁeld for f.
(b) Let f(X) = X3 + aX2 + bX + c ∈Q[X] be irreducible, and let α1, α2, α3 be its roots
in C. Then Q[α1, α2, α3] = Q[α1, α2] is a splitting ﬁeld for f(X). Note that [Q[α1] : Q] = 3
and that [Q[α1, α2] : Q[α1]] = 1 or 2, and so [Q[α1, α2] : Q] = 3 or 6. We’ll see later that
the degree is 3 if and only if the discriminant of f(X) is a square in F. For example, the
discriminant of X3 + bX + c is −4b3 −27c2, and so the splitting ﬁeld of X3 + 10X + 1 has
degree 6 over Q.
Proposition 2.4. Every polynomial has a splitting ﬁeld.
Proof. Let f
∈F[X].
Let g1 be an irreducible factor of f(X), and let F1 =
F[X]/(g1(X)) = F[α1], α1 = X + (g1). Then α1 is a root of f(X) in F1, and we deﬁne
f1(X) to be the quotient f(X)/(X −α1) (in F1[X]). Then f1 ∈F1[X], and the same con-
struction gives us a ﬁeld F2 = F1[α2] with α2 a root of f1. By continuing in this fashion, we
obtain a splitting ﬁeld.
Remark 2.5. Let n = deg f. In the proof, [F1 : F] ≤n, [F2 : F1] ≤n −1, ..., and so
the degree of the splitting ﬁeld over F is ≤n!. Whether or not there exist polynomials of
degree n in F[X] whose splitting ﬁeld has degree n! depends on F. For example, there don’t
for n > 1 if F = C or Fp, nor for n > 2 if F = R. However, later we shall see how to
write down large numbers (in fact inﬁnitely many) polynomials of degree n in Q[X] whose
splitting ﬁelds have degree n!.
Example 2.6. (a) Let f = (Xp −1)/(X −1); any ﬁeld generated by a root of f is a
splitting ﬁeld (if ζ is one root, the remainder are ζ2, ζ3, . . . , ζp−1).
(b) Suppose F is of characteristic p, and let f = Xp −X −a; any ﬁeld generated by a
root of f is a splitting ﬁeld (if α is one root, the remainder are α + 1, ..., α + p −1).
(c) If α is one root of Xn−a, then the remaining roots are all of the form ζα, where ζn = 1.
Therefore, if F contains all the nth roots of 1, i.e., if Xn −1 splits in F[X], then F[α] is a
splitting ﬁeld for Xn −a. Note that if p is the characteristic of F, then Xp −1 = (X −1)p,
and so F automatically contains all the pth roots of 1.
Proposition 2.7. Let f ∈F[X], and let E be a splitting ﬁeld for f, and let Ω⊃F be a
second ﬁeld splitting f.
(a) There exists at least one F-homomorphism ϕ : E →Ω.

14
J.S. MILNE
(b) The number of F-homomorphisms E →Ωis ≤[E : F], and = [E : F] if f has deg(f)
distinct roots in Ω.
(c) If Ωis also a splitting ﬁeld for f, then each F-homomorphism E →Ωis an isomor-
phism. In particular, any two splitting ﬁelds for f are F-isomorphic.
Proof. Write E = F[α1, ..., αm], m ≤deg(f), with the αi the distinct roots of f(X).
The minimum polynomial of α1 is an irreducible polynomial f1 dividing f. As f (hence f1)
splits in Ω, Proposition 2.1 shows that there exists an F-homomorphism ϕ1 : F[α1] →Ω,
and the number of ϕ1’s is ≤deg(f1) = [F[α1] : F], with equality holding when f (hence also
f1) has distinct roots in Ω.
Next, the minimum polynomial of α2 over F[α1] is an irreducible factor f2 of f(X)
in F[α1][X].
According to Proposition 2.2, each ϕ1 extends to a homomorphism ϕ2 :
F[α1, α2] →Ω, and the number of extensions is ≤deg(f2) = [F[α1, α2] : F[α1]], with
equality holding when f (hence also f2) has distinct roots in Ω.
On combining these statements we conclude that there exists an F-homomorphism ϕ :
F[α1, α2] →Ω, and the number of such homomorphisms is ≤[F[α1, α2] : F], with equality
holding when f has deg(f) distinct roots in Ω.
After repeating the argument m times, we obtain (a) and (b). For (c), note that, because
an F-homomorphism E →Ωis injective, we must have [E : F] ≤[Ω: F]. If Ωis also a
splitting ﬁeld, then we obtain the reverse inequality also. We therefore have equality, and so
any F-homomorphism E →Ωis an isomorphism.
Corollary 2.8. Let E and L be extension ﬁelds of F, with E ﬁnite over F; then there
exists an extension ﬁeld Ωof L and an F-homomorphism E →Ω.
Proof. Write E = F[α1, . . . , αm], and let fi be the minimum polynomial of αi over F.
Let E′ be a splitting ﬁeld of f =df
 fi regarded as an element of E[X], and replace E with
the subﬁeld of E′ generated by F and all the roots of f(X). Thus E is now the splitting
ﬁeld of f(X) ∈F[X]. Let Ωbe a splitting ﬁeld for f regarded as an element of L[X]. The
proposition shows that there is an F-homomorphism E →Ω.
Remark 2.9. After replacing E by its (isomorphic) image in Ω, we will have that E and
L are subﬁelds of Ω. This will allow us to assume that E and L are subﬁelds of a common
ﬁeld.
Warning! If E and E′ are splitting ﬁelds of f(X) ∈F[X], then we know there is an
F-isomorphism E →E′, but there will in general be no preferred such isomorphism. Error
and confusion can result if you simply identify the ﬁelds.
2.3. Algebraic closures.
Recall that Ωis said to be algebraically closed if every nonconstant polynomial f(X) ∈Ω[X]
has a root in Ω(and hence splits in Ω[X]); equivalently, if the only irreducible polynomials in
Ω[X] are those of degree 1. Recall also that a ﬁeld Ωcontaining F is said to be an algebraic
closure of F if it is algebraic over F and it is algebraically closed. We want to show that
(assuming the axiom of choice) every ﬁeld has an algebraic closure. The following criterion
suggests how this might be done.
Lemma 2.10. Suppose that Ωis algebraic over F and every polynomial f ∈F[X] splits
in Ω[X]; then Ωis an algebraic closure of F.

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
15
Proof. Let f ∈Ω[X]. We know (see §1.6) how to construct a ﬁnite extension E of Ω
containing a root α of f. We want to show that α in fact lies in Ω. Write f = anXn+· · ·+a0,
ai ∈Ω, and consider the sequence of ﬁelds F ⊂F[a1, . . . , an] ⊂F[a1, . . . , an, α]. Because
each ai is algebraic over F, F[a1, . . . , an] is a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension of F, and because f ∈
F[a1, . . . , an][X], α is algebraic over F[a1, . . . , an]. Therefore α lies in a ﬁnite extension of
F, and is therefore algebraic over F, i.e., it is the root of a polynomial with coeﬃcients in
F. But, by assumption, this polynomial splits in Ω[X], and so all its roots lie in Ω. In
particular, α ∈Ω.
Lemma 2.11. Let Ω⊃F; then
E = {α ∈Ω| α algebraic over F}
is a ﬁeld.
Proof. If α and β are algebraic over F, then F[α, β] is of ﬁnite degree over F, and so
is a ﬁeld (see 1.14). Every element of F[α, β] is algebraic over F, including α ± β, α/β,
αβ, . . ..
The ﬁeld E constructed in the lemma is called the algebraic closure of F in Ω.
The
preceding lemma shows that if every polynomial in F[X] splits in Ω[X], then E is an algebraic
closure of F. Thus to construct an algebraic closure of F, it suﬃces to construct an extension
in which every polynomial in F[X] splits. We know how to do this for a single polynomial,
but passing from there to all polynomials causes set-theoretic problems.
Theorem 2.12 (*). 2Every ﬁeld has an algebraic closure.
Once we have proved the fundamental theorem of algebra, that C is algebraically closed,
then we will know that the algebraic closure in C of any subﬁeld F of C is an algebraic
closure of F. This proves the theorem for such ﬁelds. We sketch three proofs of the general
result. The ﬁrst doesn’t assume the axiom of choice, but does assume that F is countable.
Proof. (First proof of 2.12) Because F is countable, it follows that F[X] is countable,
i.e., we can list its elements f1(X), f2(X), . . . . Deﬁne the ﬁelds Ei inductively as follows:
E0 = F; Ei is the splitting ﬁeld of fi over Ei−1. Note that E0 ⊂E1 ⊂E2 ⊂· · · . Deﬁne
Ω= ∪Ei; it is obviously an algebraic closure of F.
Remark 2.13. Since the Ei are not subsets of a ﬁxed set, forming the union requires
explanation: deﬁne Ω∗to be the disjoint union of the Ei; let a, b ∈Ω∗, say a ∈Ei and
b ∈Ej; write a ∼b if a = b when regarded as elements of the larger of Ei or Ej; verify that
∼is an equivalence relation, and let Ω= Ω∗/ ∼.
Proof. (Second proof of 2.12) If A and B are rings containing a ﬁeld F, then A ⊗F B is
a ring containing F, and there are F-homomorphisms A, B →A ⊗F B. More generally, if
(Ai)i∈I is some family of rings each of which contains F, then ⊗FAi is a ring containing F,
and there are F-homomorphisms Aj →⊗FAi for each j ∈I. It is deﬁned to be the quotient
of the F-vector space with basis ΠAi by the subspace generated by elements of the form:
• (xi) + (yi) −(zi) with xj + yj = zj for one j ∈I and xi = yi = zi for all i ̸= j.
• (xi) −a(yi) with xj = ayj for one j ∈I and xi = yi for all i ̸= j.

It can be made into a ring in an obvious fashion (see Bourbaki, Alg`ebre, Chapt 3, Appendix).
For each polynomial f ∈F[X], choose a splitting ﬁeld Ef, and let Ω= (⊗fEf)/M where
M is a maximal ideal in ⊗fEf—Zorn’s lemma implies that M exists (see below). Then Ω
is a ﬁeld (see 1.1), and there are F-homomorphisms Ef →Ω(which must be injective) for
each f ∈F[X]. Since f splits in Ef, it must also split in the larger ﬁeld Ω. The algebraic
closure of F in Ωis therefore an algebraic closure of F. (Actually, Ωitself is an algebraic
closure of F.)
Lemma 2.14 (Zorn’s). Let (S, ≤) be a nonempty partially ordered set (reﬂexive, transi-
tive, anti-symmetric, i.e., a ≤b and b ≤a =⇒a = b). Suppose that every totally ordered
subset T of S (i.e., for all s, t ∈T, either s ≤t or t ≤s) has an upper bound in S (i.e.,
there exists an s ∈S such that t ≤s for all t ∈T). Then S has a maximal element (i.e., an
element s such that s ≤s′ =⇒s = s′).
Zorn’s lemma is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice.
Lemma 2.15 (*). Every nonzero commutative ring A has a maximal ideal.
Proof. Let S be the set of all proper ideals in A, partially ordered by inclusion. If T is
a totally ordered set of ideals, then J = 
I∈T I is again an ideal, and it is proper because
if 1 ∈J then 1 ∈I for some I in T. Thus J is an upper bound for T. Now Zorn’s lemma
implies that S has a maximal element, which is a maximal ideal in A.
Proof. (Third proof of 2.12) First show that the cardinality of any ﬁeld algebraic over F
is the same as that of F. Next choose an uncountable set Ξ of cardinality greater than that
of F, and identify F with a subset of Ξ. Let S be the set triples (E, +, ·) with E ⊂S and
(+, ·) a ﬁeld structure on E such that (E, +, ·) contains F as a subﬁeld and is algebraic over
it. Write (E, +, ·) ≤(E′, +′, ·′) if the ﬁrst is a subﬁeld of the second. Apply Zorn’s lemma to
show that S has maximal elements, and then show that a maximal element is algebraically
closed. (See Jacobson, Lectures in Algebra, III, p144 for the details.)
There do exist naturally occurring ﬁelds, not contained in C, that are uncountable. For
example, for any ﬁeld F there is a ring F[[T]] of formal power series 
i≥0 aiT i, ai ∈F, and
its ﬁeld of fractions is uncountable even if F is ﬁnite.
Theorem 2.16 (*). Let Ωbe an algebraic closure of F, and let E be an algebraic exten-
sion of F; then there is an F-homomorphism E →Ω. If E is also an algebraic closure of
F, then any such map is an isomorphism.
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that E is countably generated over F, i.e., E = F[α1, ..., αn, . . . ].
Then we can extend the inclusion map F →Ωto F[α1] (map α1 to any root of its minimal
polynomial in Ω), then to F[α1, α2], and so on.
The uncountable case is a straightforward application of Zorn’s lemma.
Let S be the set of pairs (M, ϕM) with M a ﬁeld F ⊂M ⊂E and ϕM an F-homomorphim
M →Ω.
Write (M, ϕM) ≤(N, ϕN) if M ⊂N and ϕN|M = ϕM.
This makes S into
a partially ordered subset. Let T be a totally ordered subset of S. Then M′ = ∪M∈TM
is a subﬁeld of E, and we can deﬁne a homomorphism ϕ′ : M′ →Ωby requiring that
ϕ′(x) = ϕM(x) if x ∈M. The pair (M′, ϕ′) is an upper bound for T in S. Hence Zorn’s
lemma gives us a maximal element (M, ϕ) in S. Suppose that M ̸= E. Then there exists an
element α ∈E, α /∈M. Since α is algebraic over M, we can apply (2.2) to extend ϕ to M[α],

contradicting the maximality of M. Hence M = E, and the proof of the ﬁrst statement is
complete.
If E is algebraically closed, then every polynomial f ∈F[X] splits in E and hence in ϕ(E),
i.e., f(X) = (X −αi), αi ∈ϕ(E). Let α ∈Ω, and let f(X) be the minimum polynomial of
α. Then X −α is a factor of f(X) in Ω[X], but, as we just observed, f(X) splits in ϕ(E)[X].
Because of unique factorization, this implies that α ∈ϕ(E).
The above proof is a typical application of Zorn’s lemma: once we know how to do
something in a ﬁnite (or countable) situation, Zorn’s lemma allows us to do it in general.
Remark 2.17. Even for a ﬁnite ﬁeld F, there will exist uncountably many isomorphisms
from one algebraic closure to a second, none of which is to be preferred over any other. Thus
it is (uncountably) sloppy to say that the algebraic closure of F is unique. All one can say
is that, given two algebraic closures Ω, Ω′ of F, then, thanks to the axiom of choice, there
exists an F-isomorphism Ω→Ω′.

3. The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory
In this section, we prove the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, which gives a one-to-
one correspondence between the subﬁelds of the splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial and
the subgroups of the Galois group of f.
3.1. Multiple roots.
Let f, g ∈F[X]. Even when f and g have no common factor in F[X], you might expect
that they could acquire a common factor in Ω[X] for some Ω⊃F. In fact, this doesn’t
happen—gcd’s don’t change when the ﬁeld is extended.
Proposition 3.1. Let f and g be polynomials in F[X], and let Ω⊃F. If r(X) is the
gcd of f and g computed in F[X], then it is also the gcd of f and g in Ω[X]. In particular,
if f and g are monic and irreducible and f ̸= g, then they do not have a common root in
any extension ﬁeld of F.
Proof. Let rF(X) and rΩ(X) be the greatest common divisors of f and g in F[X] and
Ω[X] respectively. Certainly rF(X)|rΩ(X) in Ω[X]. The Euclidean algorithm shows that
there are polynomials a and b in F[X] such that
a(X)f(X) + b(X)g(X) = rF (X).
Since rΩ(X) divides f and g in Ω[X], it divides the left-hand side of the equation, and
therefore also the right. Hence rΩ= rF .
For the second statement, note that the hypotheses imply that gcd(f, g) = 1 (in F[X]).
Hence they can’t have a common factor X −α in any extension ﬁeld.
The proposition allows us to write gcd(f, g), without reference to a ﬁeld.
Let f ∈F[X], and let f(X) = (X −αi)mi, αi distinct, be a splitting of f over some
large ﬁeld Ω⊃F. We then say that αi is a root of multiplicity mi. A root of multiplicity
one is said to be simple.
We say that f has multiple roots if it has roots of multiplicity > 1 in some big ﬁeld Ω.
It then has multiple roots in the subﬁeld of Ωgenerated by its roots, and because any two
splitting ﬁelds are F-isomorphic, this shows that f will have roots of multiplicity > 1 in
every ﬁeld containing F in which it splits.
If f has multiple factors in F[X], say f =  fi(X)mi with some mi > 1, then obviously
it will have multiple roots. If f =  fi with the fi distinct monic irreducible polynomials,
then the proposition shows that f can only have multiple roots if one of the fi has multiple
roots. Thus it remains to examine irreducible polynomials for multiple roots.
Example 3.2. Let F be of characteristic p, and assume that F has an element a that
is not a pth-power (e.g., F = Fp(T); a = T). Then Xp −a is irreducible in F[X], but
Xp −a = (X −α)p in its splitting ﬁeld. Thus an irreducible polynomial can have multiple
roots.
We deﬁne the derivative f′(X) of a polynomial f(X) =  aiXi to be  iaiXi−1. When
F = R, this agrees with the usual deﬁnition. The usual rules for diﬀerentiating sums and
products still hold, but note that the derivative of Xp is zero in characteristic p.
Proposition 3.3. Let f be a (monic) irreducible polynomial in F[X]. The following
statements are equivalent:

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
19
(a) f has at least one multiple root (in a splitting ﬁeld);
(b) gcd(f, f′) ̸= 1;
(c) F has characteristic p ̸= 0 and f(X) = g(Xp), some g ∈F[X];
(d) all the roots of f are multiple.
Proof. (a) =⇒(b). Let α be a multiple root of f, and write f = (X −α)mg(X), m > 1,
in some splitting ﬁeld. Then
f′(X) = m(X −α)m−1g(X) + (X −α)mg′(X).
Hence f′(α) = 0, and so gcd(f, f′) ̸= 1.
(b) =⇒(c). Since f is irreducible and deg(f′) < deg(f),
gcd(f, f′) ̸= 1 =⇒f′ = 0 =⇒f = g(Xp).
(c) =⇒(d). Suppose f(X) = g(Xp), and let g(X) = (X −ai)mi in some splitting ﬁeld.
Then
f(X) = g(Xp) =

(Xp −ai)mi =

(X −αi)pmi
where αp
i = ai (in some big ﬁeld). Hence every root of f(X) has multiplicity at least p.
(d) =⇒(a). Every root multiple =⇒at least one root multiple (I hope).
Definition 3.4. A polynomial f ∈F[X] is said to be separable if all its irreducible
factors have simple roots.
Note that the preceding discussion shows that f is not separable if and only if
(a) the characteristic of F is p ̸= 0, and
(b) at least one of the irreducible factors of f is a polynomial in Xp.
A ﬁeld F is said to be perfect if all polynomials in F[X] are separable.
Proposition 3.5. A ﬁeld F is perfect if and only if it either
• has characteristic 0, or
• it has characteristic p and F = F p (i.e., every element of F is a pth power).
Proof. =⇒: If char F = p and it contains an element a that is not a pth power, then
F[X] contains a nonseparable polynomial, namely, Xp −a.
⇐= : If char F = p and F = F p, then every polyonomial in Xp is a pth power—
 aiXp = ( biX)p if ai = bp
i—and so can’t be irreducible.
Example 3.6. (a) All ﬁnite ﬁelds are perfect (because a 
→ap is an injective homomor-
phism F →F, which must be surjective if F is ﬁnite). In fact, any ﬁeld algebraic over Fp is
perfect.
(b) If F0 has characteristic p, then F = F0(X) is not perfect (because X is not a pth
power).
3.2. Groups of automorphisms of ﬁelds.
Consider ﬁelds E ⊃F. We write Aut(E/F) for the group of F-automorphisms of E, i.e.,
automorphisms σ : E →E such that σ(a) = a for all a ∈F.

20
J.S. MILNE
Example 3.7. (a) There are two obvious automorphisms of C, namely, the identity map
and complex conjugation. We’ll see later (last section) that by using the Axiom of Choice,
one can construct uncountably many more. They are all noncontinuous and (I’ve been told)
nonmeasurable—hence they require the Axiom of Choice for their construction.
(b) Let E = C(X).
Then Aut(E/C) consists of the maps X 
→
aX+b
cX+d, ad −bc ̸= 0
(Jacobson, Lectures III, p158), and so Aut(E/C) = PGL2(C). Analysts will note that this
is the same as the automorphism group of the Riemann sphere. This is not a coincidence:
the ﬁeld of meromorphic functions on the Riemann sphere P1
C is C(z) ≈C(X), and so there
is a map Aut(P1
C) →Aut(C(z)/C), which one can show is an isomorphism.
(c) The group Aut(C(X1, X2)/C) is quite complicated—there is a map
PGL3(C) = Aut(P2
C) →Aut(C(X1, X2)/C),
but this is very far from being surjective. When there are more X’s, the group is unknown.
(The group Aut(C(X1, . . . , Xn)/C) is the group of birational automorphisms of Pn
C. It is
called the Cremona group.
Its study is part of algebraic geometry.)
In this section, we shall be concerned with the groups Aut(E/F) when E is a ﬁnite
extension of F.
Proposition 3.8. If E is a splitting ﬁeld of a monic separable polynomial f ∈F[X],
then Aut(E/F) has order [E : F].
Proof. Let f =  fmi
i
, with the fi monic irreducible and distinct. The splitting ﬁeld
of f is the same as the splitting ﬁeld of  fi. Hence we may assume f is a product of
distinct monic separable irreducible polynomials, and hence has deg f distinct roots in E.
Now Proposition 2.7b shows that there are [E : F] distinct F-homomorphisms E →E; they
are automatically isomorphisms.
Example 3.9. (a) Let E = F[α], f(α) = 0; if f has no other root in E than α, then
Aut(E/F) = 1. For example, if
3√
2 denotes the real cube root of 2, then Aut(Q[
3√
2]/Q) = 1.
Thus, in the proposition, it is essential that E be a splitting ﬁeld.
(b) Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic p ̸= 0, and let a be an element of F that is not a
pth power. The splitting ﬁeld of f = Xp −a is F[α] where α is the unique root of f. Then
Aut(E/F) = 1. Thus, in the proposition, it is essential that E be the splitting ﬁeld of a
separable polynomial.
When G is a group of automorphisms of a ﬁeld E, we write
EG = Inv(G) = {α ∈E | σα = α, all σ ∈G}.
It is a subﬁeld of E, called the subﬁeld of G-invariants of E or the subﬁeld of E ﬁxed by G.
We have maps
G 
→Inv(G)
F 
→Aut(E/F).
Goal: Show that when E is the splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial in F[X] and G =
Aut(E/F), then
H 
→Inv(H),
M 
→Aut(E/M)
give a one-to-one correspondence between the set of intermediate ﬁelds M, F ⊂M ⊂E,
and the set of subgroups H of G.

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
21
Lemma 3.10 (E. Artin). Let G be a ﬁnite group of automorphisms of a ﬁeld E, and let
F = EG; then [E : F] ≤(G : 1).
Proof. Let G = {σ1 = 1, . . . , σm}, and let α1, . . . , αn be n > m elements of E. We shall
show that the αi are linearly dependent over F. In the system
σ1(α1)x1 + · · · + σ1(αn)xn
=
0
· · ·
· · ·
σm(α1)x1 + · · · + σm(αn)xn
=
0
there are m equations and n > m unknowns, and hence there are nontrivial solutions (in E).
Choose a nontrivial solution (c1, . . . , cn) with the fewest nonzero elements. After renum-
bering the αi’s, we may suppose that c1 ̸= 0, and then (after multiplying by a scalar) that
c1 = 1. With these normalizations, we’ll see that all ci ∈F. Hence the ﬁrst equation (recall
σ1 = 1)
α1c1 + · · · + αncn = 0
shows that the αi are linearly dependent over F.
If not all ci are in F, then σk(ci) ̸= ci for some i, k. On apply σk to the equations
σ1(α1)c1 + · · · + σ1(αn)cn
=
0
· · ·
· · ·
σm(α1)c1 + · · · + σm(αn)cn
=
0
and using that {σkσ1, . . . , σkσm} is a permutation of {σ1, . . . , σm},
we ﬁnd that
(1, . . . , σk(ci), . . .) is also a solution to the system of equations. On subtracting it from
the ﬁrst, we obtain a solution (0, . . . , ci −σk(ci), . . . ), which is nonzero (look at the ith
coordinate), but has more zeros than the ﬁrst solution (look at the ﬁrst coordinate)—
contradiction.
3.3. Separable, normal, and Galois extensions. An algebraic extension E/F is said
to be separable if the minimum polynomial of every element of E is separable, i.e., doesn’t
have multiple roots (in a splitting ﬁeld); equivalently, if every irreducible polynomial in F[X]
having a root in E is separable. Thus E/F is inseparable if and only if
(a) F is nonperfect, and in particular has characteristic p ̸= 0, and
(b) there is an element α of E whose minimal polynomial is of the form g(Xp), g ∈F[X].
For example, E = Fp(T) is an inseparable extension of Fp(T p).
An algebraic extension E/F is normal if the minimum polynomial of every element of E
splits in E; equivalently, if every irreducible polynomial f ∈F[X] having a root in E splits
in E.
Thus if f ∈F[X] is irreducible of degree m and has a root in E, then
E/F separable
=⇒
roots of f distinct
E/F normal
=⇒
f splits in E


=⇒f has m distinct roots in E.
Therefore, E/F is normal and separable if and only if, for each α ∈E, the minimum
polynomial of α has [F[α] : F] distinct roots in E.

22
J.S. MILNE
Example 3.11. (a) The ﬁeld Q[
3√
2], where
3√
2 is the real cube root of 2, is separable
but not normal over Q (X3 −2 doesn’t split in Q[α]).
(b) The ﬁeld Fp(T) is normal but not separable over Fp(T p)—it is the splitting ﬁeld of the
inseparable polynomial Xp −T p.
Theorem 3.12. Let E be an extension ﬁeld of F. The following statements are equiva-
lent:
(a) E is the splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial f ∈F[X];
(b) F = EG for some ﬁnite group of automorphisms of E;
(c) E is normal and separable, and of ﬁnite degree, over F.
Moreover, if E is as in (a), then F = EAut(E/F); if G and F are as in (b) then G =
Aut(E/F).
Proof. (a) =⇒(b). Let G = Aut(E/F), and let F ′ = EG ⊃F. Then E is also the
splitting ﬁeld of f ∈F ′[X], and f is still separable when regarded as a polynomial over F ′.
Hence Proposition 3.8 shows that
[E : F ′] = # Aut(E/F ′)
[E : F] = # Aut(E/F).
Since Aut(E/F ′) = Aut(E/F) = G, we conclude that F = F ′, and so F = EAut(E/F).
(b) =⇒(c). By Artin’s lemma, we know that [E : F] ≤(G : 1); in particular, it is ﬁnite.
Let α ∈E and let f be the minimum polynomial of α; we have to prove that f splits into
distinct factors in E. Let {α1 = α, ..., αm} be the orbit of α under G, and let
g(X) =

(X −αi) = Xm + a1Xm−1 + · · · + am.
Any σ ∈G merely permutes the αi. Since the ai are symmetric polynomials in the αi, we
ﬁnd that σai = ai for all i, and so g(X) ∈F[X]. It is monic, and g(α) = 0, and so f(X)|g(X)
(see p7). But also g(X)|f(X), because each αi is a root of f(X) (if αi = σα, then applying
σ to the equation f(α) = 0 gives f(αi) = 0). We conclude that f(X) = g(X), and so f(X)
splits into distinct factors in E.
(c) =⇒(a). Because E has ﬁnite degree over F, it is generated over F by a ﬁnite number
of elements, say, E = F[α1, ..., αm], αi ∈E, αi algebraic over F. Let fi be the minimum
polynomial of αi over F. Because E is normal over F, each fi splits in E, and so E is the
splitting ﬁeld of f =  fi. Because E is separable over F, f is separable.
Finally, we have to show that if G is a ﬁnite group acting on a ﬁeld E, then G =
Aut(E/EG). We know that:
• [E : EG] ≤(G : 1) (Artin),
• G ⊂Aut(E/EG), and,
• E is the splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial in EG[X] (because b =⇒a), and so
(by 3.8) the order of Aut(E/EG) is [E : EG].
Now the inequalities
[E : EG] ≤(G : 1) ≤(Aut(E/EG) : 1) = [E : EG]
must be equalities, and so G = Aut(E/EG).

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
23
An extension of ﬁelds E ⊃F satisfying the equivalent conditions of the proposition is
called a Galois extension, and Aut(E/F) is called the Galois group Gal(E/F) of E over F.
Note that we have shown that F = EGal(E/F).
Remark 3.13. Let E be Galois over F with Galois group G, and let α ∈E. The elements
α1 = α, α2, ..., αm of the orbit of α are called the conjugates of α. In the course of the proof
of the the above theorem we showed that the minimum polynomial of α is (X −αi).
Corollary 3.14. Every ﬁnite separable extension E of F is contained in a ﬁnite Galois
extension.
Proof. Let E = F[α1, ..., αm]. Let fi = minimum polynomial of αi over F, and take E′
to be the splitting ﬁeld of  fi over F.
Corollary 3.15. Let E ⊃M ⊃F; if E is Galois over F, then it is Galois over M.
Proof. We know E is the splitting ﬁeld of some f ∈F[X]; it is also the splitting ﬁeld of
f regarded as an element of M[X].
Remark 3.16. When we drop the assumption that E is separable over F, we can still
say something. Let E be a ﬁnite extension of F. An element α ∈E is said to be separable
over F if its minimum polynomial over F is separable. The elements of E separable over
F form a subﬁeld E′ of E that is separable over F; write [E : F]sep = [E′ : F] (separable
degree of E over F). If Ωis an algebraically closed ﬁeld containing F, then there are exactly
[E : F]sep F-homomorphisms E →Ω. When E ⊃M ⊃F (ﬁnite extensions),
[E : F]sep = [E : M]sep[M : F]sep.
In particular,
E is separable over F ⇐⇒E is separable over M and M is separable over F.
3.4. The fundamental theorem of Galois theory.
Theorem 3.17 (Fundamental theorem of Galois theory). Let E be a Galois extension of
F, and let G = Gal(E/F). The maps H 
→EH and M 
→Gal(E/M) are inverse bijections
between the set of subgroups of G and the set of intermediate ﬁelds between E and F:
{subgroups of G} ↔{intermediate ﬁelds F ⊂M ⊂E}.
Moreover:
(a) The correspondence is inclusion-reversing, i.e., H1 ⊃H2 ⇐⇒EH1 ⊂EH2.
(b) Indexes equal degrees, i.e., (H1 : H2) = [EH2 : EH1].
(c) The group σHσ−1 ↔σM, i.e., EσHσ−1 = σ(EH); Gal(E/σM) = σ Gal(E/M)σ−1.
(d) The group H is normal in G ⇐⇒EH is normal (hence Galois) over F, in which case
Gal(EH/F) = G/H.
Proof. Let H be a subgroup of G. We ﬁrst have to show that Gal(E/EH) = H. But we
have already observed that E is Galois over EH, and Theorem 3.12 shows that Gal(E/EH) =
H.
Next let M be an intermediate ﬁeld, and let H = Gal(E/M). We have to show that
EH = M, but this is again proved in Theorem 3.12.
Thus we have proved that Inv(·) and Gal(E/·) are inverse bijections.

24
J.S. MILNE
(a) We have the obvious implications:
H1 ⊃H2 =⇒EH1 ⊂EH2 =⇒Gal(E/EH1) ⊃Gal(E/EH2).
But Gal(E/EHi) = Hi.
(b) In the case H2 = 1, the ﬁrst equality follows from (3.8) and (3.12). The general case
follows, using that
(H1 : 1) = (H1 : H2)(H2 : 1)
and
[E : EH1] = [E : EH2][EH2 : EH1].
(c) If H = {τ ∈G | τα = α, all α ∈M}, i.e., H = Gal(E/M), then σHσ−1 = {τ ∈G |
τσα = σα, all α ∈M}, i.e., σHσ−1 = Gal(E/σM).
(d) Assume H to be normal in G, and let M = EH. Because σHσ−1 = H for all σ ∈G,
we must have σM = M for all σ ∈G, i.e., the action of G on E stabilizes M. We therefore
have a homomorphism
σ 
→σ|M : G →Aut(M/F)
with kernel H. Let G′ be the image. Then F = MG′, and so M is Galois over F with Galois
group G′ (by Theorem 3.12).
Conversely, assume that M is normal over F, and write M = F[α1, ..., αm]. For σ ∈G,
σαi is a root of the minimum polynomial of αi over F, and so lies in M. Hence σM = M,
and this implies that σHσ−1 = H (by (c)).
Remark 3.18. The theorem shows that there is an order reversing bijection between
the intermediate ﬁelds of E/F and the subgroups of G. Using this we can read oﬀmore
results. For example let M1, M2, . . . , Mr be intermediate ﬁelds, and let Hi be the subgroup
corresponding to Mi (i.e., Hi = Gal(E/Mi)).
Then (by deﬁnition) M1M2 · · · Mr is the
smallest ﬁeld containing all Mi; hence it must correspond to the largest subgroup contained
in all Hi, which is  Hi. Therefore
Gal(E/M1 · · · Mr) = H1 ∩... ∩Hr.
We mention two further results (they are not diﬃcult to prove):
1. Let E/F be Galois, and let L be any ﬁeld containing F. Assume L and E are contained
in some large ﬁeld Ω. Then EL is Galois over L, E is Galois over E ∩L, and the map
σ 
→σ|E : Gal(EL/L) →Gal(E/E ∩L) is an isomorphism.
2.
Let E1/F and E2/F be Galois, with E1 and E2 subﬁelds of some ﬁeld Ω. Then E1E2
is Galois over F, and
σ 
→(σ|E1, σ|E2) : Gal(E1E2/F) →Gal(E1/F) ×Gal(E2/F)
is injective with image {(σ1, σ2) | σ1|E1 ∩E2 = σ2|E1 ∩E2}.
Example 3.19. We analyse the extension Q[ζ]/Q, where ζ is the primitive 7th root of
1, say ζ = e2πi/7. Then Q[ζ] is the splitting ﬁeld of the irreducible polynomial
X6 + X5 + X4 + X3 + X2 + X + 1
(see 1.31), and so is Galois of degree 6 over Q. For any σ ∈G, σζ = ζi, some i, 1 ≤i ≤6,
and the map σ 
→i deﬁnes an isomorphism Gal(Q[ζ]/Q) →(Z/7Z)×. Let σ be the element
of Gal(Q[ζ]/Q) such that σζ = ζ3. Then σ generates Gal(Q[ζ]/Q) because the class of 3 in
(Z/7Z)× generates it (the powers of 3 mod 7 are 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1). We investigate the subﬁelds
of Q[ζ] corresponding to the subgroups < σ3 > and < σ2 >.

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
25
Note that σ3ζ = ζ6 = ¯ζ (complex conjugate of ζ). The subﬁeld of Q[ζ] corresponding to
< σ3 > is Q[ζ + ¯ζ], and ζ + ¯ζ = 2 cos 2π
7 . Since < σ3 > is a normal subgroup of < σ >,
Q[ζ + ¯ζ] is Galois over Q, with Galois group < σ > / < σ3 > . The conjugates of α1 = ζ + ¯ζ
are α3 = ζ3 + ζ−3, α2 = ζ2 + ζ−2. Direct calculation shows that

αi =
6

i=1
ζi = −1,
α1α2α3 = (ζ+ζ6)(ζ2+ζ5)(ζ3+ζ4) = (ζ+ζ3+ζ4+ζ6)(ζ3+ζ4) = (ζ4+ζ6+1+ζ2+ζ5+1+ζ+ζ3) = 1.
α1α2 + α1α3 + α2α3 = −2.
Hence the minimum polynomial of ζ + ¯ζ is
g(X) = X3 + X2 −2X −1.
The minimum polynomial of cos 2π
7 = α1
2 is therefore
g(2X)
8
= X3 + X2/2 −X/2 −1/8.
The subﬁeld of Q[ζ] corresponding to < σ2 > is generated by β = ζ +ζ2+ζ4. Let β′ = σβ.
Then (β −β′)2 = −7. Hence the ﬁeld ﬁxed by < σ2 > is Q[√−7].
Example 3.20. We compute the Galois group of the splitting ﬁeld E of X5 −2 ∈Q[X].
Recall (from the Homework) that E = Q[ζ, α] where ζ is a primitive 5th root of 1, and α is
a root of X5 −2. For example, we could take E to be the splitting ﬁeld of X5 −2 in C, with
ζ = e2πi/5 and α equal to the real 5th root of 2. We have the picture:
Q[ζ, α]
N
⧸
⧹
H
Q[ζ]
Q[α]
G/N
⧹
⧸
Q
The degrees
[Q[ζ] : Q] = 4,
[Q[α] : Q] = 5.
Because 4 and 5 are relatively prime,
[Q[ζ, α] : Q] = 20.
Hence G = Gal(Q[ζ, α]/Q) has order 20, and the subgroups N and H corresponding to Q[ζ]
and Q[α] have orders 5 and 4 respectively (because N = Gal(Q[ζ, α]/Q[ζ] . . .). Because
Q[ζ] is normal over Q (it is the splitting ﬁeld of X5 −1), N is normal in G.
Because
Q[ζ] · Q[α] = Q[ζ, α], we have H ∩N = 1 (see 3.18), and so G = N ⋊θ H.
We have
H ≈G/N ≈(Z/5Z)×, which is cyclic, being generated by the class of 2. Let τ be the
generator of H corresponding to 2 under this isomorphism, and let σ be a generator of N.
Thus σ(α) is another root of X5 −2, which we can take to be ζα (after possibly replacing σ
by a power). Hence:

Note that τστ −1(α) = τσα = τ(ζα) = ζ2α and it ﬁxes ζ; therefore τστ −1 = σ2. Thus G has
generators σ and τ and deﬁning relations
σ5 = 1,
τ 4 = 1,
τστ −1 = σ2.

The subgroup H has ﬁve conjugates, which correspond to the ﬁve ﬁelds Q[ζiα],
σiHσ−i ↔σiQ[α] = Q[ζiα],
1 ≤i ≤5.
Definition 3.21. An extension E ⊃F is called a cyclic, abelian, ..., solvable extension
if it is Galois with cyclic, abelian, ..., solvable Galois group.
3.5. Constructible numbers revisited.
Earlier, we showed that a number α is constructible if and only if it is contained in a ﬁeld
Q[√a1] · · · [√ar]. In particular
α constructible
=⇒[Q[α] : Q] = 2s some s.
Now we can prove a partial converse to this last statement.
Theorem 3.22. If α is contained in a Galois extension of Q of degre 2r then it is con-
structible.
Proof. Suppose α ∈E where E is Galois over Q of degree 2r, and let G = Gal(E/Q).
From a theorem on the structure of p-groups, we know there will be a sequence of groups
{1} ⊂G1 ⊂G2 ⊂· · · ⊂Gr = G
with Gi/Gi−1 of order 2. Correspondingly, there will be a sequence of ﬁelds,
Q ⊂E1 ⊂E2 ⊂· · · ⊂Er = E
with Ei of degree 2 over Ei−1.
But (see below), every quadratic extension is obtained by extracting a square root, and
we know that square roots can be constructed using only a ruler and compass. This proves
the theorem.
Lemma 3.23. Let E/F be a quadratic extension of ﬁelds of characteristic ̸= 2. Then
E = F[
√
d] for some d ∈F.
Proof. Let α ∈E, α /∈F, and let X2 + bX + c be the minimum polynomial of α. The
α = −b±
√
b2−4c
2
, and so E = F[
√
b2 −4c].
Corollary 3.24. If p is a prime of the form 2k + 1, then cos 2π
p is constructible.
Proof. The ﬁeld Q[e2πi/p] is Galois over Q with Galois group G ≈(Z/pZ)×, which has
order p −1 = 2k.
Thus a regular p-gon, p prime, is constructible if and only if p is a Fermat prime, i.e., of the
form 22r + 1. For example, we have proved that the regular 65537-polygon is constructible,
without (happily) having to exhibit an explicit formula for cos
2π
65537.
3.6. Galois group of a polynomial.
If the polynomial f ∈F[X] is separable, then its splitting ﬁeld E is Galois over F, and we
call Gal(E/F) the Galois group Gf of f.
Let f = n
i=1(X −αi) in the splitting ﬁeld E. We know elements of Gal(E/F) map
roots of f to roots of f, i.e., they map the set {α1, α2, . . . , αn} into itself. Since they are
automorphisms, they deﬁne permutations of {α1, α2, . . . , αn}.
As E = F[α1, ..., αn], an
element of Gal(E/F) is uniquely determined by its action on {α1, α2, . . . , αn}. Thus Gf can

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
27
be identiﬁed with a subset of Sym({α1, α2, . . . , αn}) ≈Sn. From the deﬁnitions, one sees
that Gf consists of the permutations σ of {α1, α2, . . . , αn} with the property
P ∈F[X1, . . . , Xn],
P(α1, . . . , αn) = 0 =⇒P(σα1, . . . , σαn) = 0.
This gives a description of Gf without mentioning ﬁelds or abstract groups (neither of which
were available to Galois).
Note that (Gf : 1) ≤deg(f)!.
3.7. Solvability of equations.
Let f be a polynomial. We say the equation f(X) = 0 is solvable (by extracting radicals)
if there is a tower
F = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂F2 ⊂· · · ⊂Fm
such that
(a) Fi = Fi−1[αi], αmi
i
∈Fi−1;
(b) Fm contains a splitting ﬁeld for f.
Theorem 3.25. (Galois, 1832) Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero. The equation f = 0
is solvable if and only if the Galois group of f is solvable.
We shall prove this later. Also we shall exhibit polynomials f(X) ∈Q[X] with Galois
group Sn, which therefore are not solvable when n ≥5.
Remark 3.26. If F has characteristic p, then the theorem fails for two reasons:
(i) f may not be separable, and so not have a Galois group;
(ii) Xp −X −a is not solvable by radicals.
If the deﬁnition of solvable is changed to allow extensions of the type in (ii) in the chain,
and f is required to be separable then the theorem becomes true in characteristic p.

4. Computing Galois Groups.
In this section, we investigate general methods for computing Galois groups.
4.1. When is Gf ⊂An?
Consider a polynomial
f(X) = Xn + a1Xn−1 + · · · + an
and let f(X) = n
i=1(X −αi) in some splitting ﬁeld. Set
∆(f) =

1≤i<j≤n
(αi −αj),
D(f) = ∆(f)2 =

1≤i<j≤n
(αi −αj)2.
Note that D(f) ̸= 0 if f has a only simple roots, i.e., if f is separable with no multiple
factors. Identify Gf with a subgroup of Sym({α1, . . . , αn}) (as in §3.6).
Proposition 4.1. Assume f is separable, and let σ ∈Gf.
(a) σ∆(f) = sign(σ)∆(f), where sign(σ) is the signature of σ.
(b) σD(f) = D(f).
Proof. The ﬁrst equation follows immediately from the deﬁnition of the signature of σ
(see Groups, p31), and the second equation is obtained by squaring the ﬁrst.
Corollary 4.2. Let f(X) ∈F[X] be of degree n and have only simple roots. Let Ff be
a splitting ﬁeld for f, so that Gf = Gal(Ff/F).
(a) The discriminant D(f) ∈F.
(b) The subﬁeld of Ff corresponding to An ∩Gf is F[∆(f)]. Hence
Gf ⊂An ⇐⇒∆(f) ∈F ⇐⇒D(f) is a square in F.
Proof. (a) We know that D(f) is an element of Ff ﬁxed by Gf =df Gal(Ff/F). Therefore
it lies in F (by the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory).
(b) Because f has simple roots, ∆(f) ̸= 0, and so the formula σ∆(f) = sign(σ)∆(f) shows
that σ ﬁxes ∆(f) ⇐⇒σ ∈An. Therefore Gf ∩An is the subgroup of Gf corresponding to
F[∆(f)], and so Gf ∩An = Gf ⇐⇒F[∆(f)] = F.
The discriminant of f can be expressed as a universal polynomial in the coeﬃcients of
f—we shall prove this later. For example:
D(aX2 + bX + c)
=
b2 −4ac
D(X3 + bX + c)
=
−4b3 −27c2.
By completing the cube, one can put any cubic polynomial in this form.
The formulas for the discriminant rapidly become very complicated, for example, that for
X5 + aX4 + bX3 + cX2 + dX + e has about 60 terms. Fortunately, Maple knows them: the
syntax is “discrim(f,X);” where f is a polynomial in the variable X.
Remark 4.3. Suppose F ⊂R. Then D(f) will not be a square if it is negative. It is
known that the sign of D(f) is (−1)s where 2s is the number of nonreal roots of f in C.
Thus if s is odd, then Gf is not contained in An. This can be proved more directly by noting
that complex conjugation will act on the roots as the product of s transpositions (cf. the
proof of Proposition 4.13). Of course the converse is not true: when s is even, Gf is not
necessarily contained in An.

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
29
4.2. When is Gf transitive?
Proposition 4.4. Let f(X) ∈F[X] have only simple roots. Then f(X) is irreducible if
and only if Gf permutes the roots of f transitively.
Proof. =⇒: If α and β are two roots of f(X) in a splitting ﬁeld Ff for f, then they
both have f(X) as their minimum polynomial, and so there is a natural F-isomorphism
F[α] →F[β], namely,
F[α] ≈F[X]/(f(X)) ≈F[β],
α ↔X ↔β.
Write Ff = F[α1, α2, ...] with α1 = α and α2, α3, . . . the other roots of f(X). Then the
F-isomorphism F[α] →F[β] extends (step by step) to a homomorphism F[α1, α2, ...] →Ff
(see 2.7), which must be an isomorphism.
⇐= : Let g(X) ∈F[X] be an irreducible factor of f, and let α be one of its roots. If β is
a second root of f, then (by assumption) β = σα for some σ ∈Gf. Now the equation
0 = σg(α)
g(X)∈F[X]
=
g(σα)
shows that β is also a root of g, and we see that we must have f(X) = g(X).
Note that when f(X) is irreducible of degree n, then n|(Gf : 1) because [F[α] : F] = n
and [F[α] : F]|[Ff : F] = (Gf : 1). Thus Gf is a transitive subgroup of Sn whose order is
divisible by n.
4.3. Polynomials of degree ≤3.
Example 4.5. Let f(X) ∈F[X] be a polynomial of degree 2. Then f is inseparable
⇐⇒F has characteristic 2 and f(X) = X2 −a for some a ∈F \ F 2. If f is separable, then
Gf = 1(= A2) or S2 according as D(f) is a square in F or not.
Example 4.6. Let f(X) ∈F[X] be a polynomial of degree 3. We can assume f to be
irreducible, for otherwise we are essentially back in the previous case. Then f is inseparable
⇐⇒F has characteristic 3 and f(X) = X3 −a some a ∈F \ F 3. If f is separable, then Gf
is a transitive subgroup of S3 whose order is divisible by 3. There are only two possibilities:
Gf = A3(=< (123) >) or S3 according as D(f) is a square in F or not.
For example, X3 −3X +1 ∈Q[X] is irreducible (apply 1.4), its discriminant is −4(−3)3 −
27 = 81 = 92, and so its Galois group is A3.
On the other hand, X3+3X +1 ∈Q[X] is also irreducible (apply 1.4), but its discriminant
is −135 which is not a square in Q, and so its Galois group is S3.
4.4. Quartic polynomials.
Let f(X) be a quartic polynomial, and assume that the roots of f are simple. In order to
determine Gf we shall exploit the fact that S4 has
V = {1, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}
as a normal subgroup—it is normal because it contains all elements of type 2+2—see Groups
p34. Let E be the splitting ﬁeld of f, and let f(X) = (X −αi) in E. We identify the

30
J.S. MILNE
Galois group Gf of f with a subgroup of the symmetric group S4 = Sym({α1, α2, α3, α4}).
Consider the partially symmetric elements
α
=
α1α2 + α3α4
β
=
α1α3 + α2α4
γ
=
α1α4 + α2α3.
They are distinct elements of E because the αi are distinct, e.g.,
α −β = α1(α2 −α3) + α4(α3 −α2) = (α1 −α4)(α2 −α3).
The group Sym({α1, α2, α3, α4}) permutes {α, β, γ} transitively. The stabilizer of each of
α, β, γ must therefore be a subgroup of index 3 in S4, and hence has order 8. For example,
the stabilizer of β is < (1234), (13) >. Groups of order 8 in S4 are Sylow 2-subgroups. There
are three of them, all isomorphic to D4. By the Sylow theorems, V is contained in a Sylow 2-
subgroup, and, because they are conjugate and it is normal, it must be contained in all three.
It follows that V is the intersection of the three Sylow 2-subgroups. Each Sylow 2-subgroup
stabilizes exactly one of α, β, or γ, and therefore their intersection V is the subgroup of S4
ﬁxing α, β, and γ.
Lemma 4.7. The ﬁeld M = F[α, β, γ] corresponds to Gf ∩V . Hence M is Galois over
F, with Galois group G/G ∩V .
Proof. The ﬁrst statement follows from the above discussion, and the second follows
from the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory.
Picture:

Let g(X) = (X −α)(X −β)(X −γ) ∈M[X]—it is called the resolvant cubic of f. Any
permutation of the αi (a fortiori, any element of Gf) merely permutes α, β, γ, and so ﬁxes
g(X). Therefore (by the Fundamental Theorem) g(X) has coeﬃcients in F. More explicitly,
we have:
Lemma 4.8. If f = X4+bX3+cX2+dX+e, then g = X3−cX2+(bd−4e)X−b2e+4ce−d2.
The discriminants of f and g are equal.
Proof. Compute everything in terms of the αi’s. (Cf. Hungerford, V.4.10.)
Now let f be an irreducible separable quartic. Then G = Gf is a transitive subgroup of
S4 whose order is divisible by 4. There are the following possibilities:

(G ∩V : 1) = [E : M],
(G : V ∩G) = [M : F].
Note that G can’t, for example, be the group generated by (12) and (34) because this is
not transitive. The groups of type D4 are the Sylow 2-subgroups discussed above, and the
groups of type C4 are those generated by cycles of length 4.
We can compute (G : V ∩G) from the resolvant cubic g, because G/V ∩G = Gal(M/F),
and M is the splitting ﬁeld of g. Once we know (G : V ∩G), we can deduce G except in the
case that it is 2. If [M : F] = 2, then G∩V = V or C2. Only the ﬁrst group acts transitively
on the roots of f, and so (from 4.4) we see that (in this case) G = D4 or C4 according as f
is irreducible or not in M[X].
Example 4.9. Consider f(X) = X4 + 4X2 + 2 ∈Q[X]. It is irreducible by Eisenstein’s
criterion, and its resolvant cubic is (X −4)(X2 −8); thus M = Q[
√
2]. Note that f, when
regarded as a polynomial in X2, factors over M; hence Gf = C4.
Example 4.10. Consider f(X) = X4 −10X2 + 4 ∈Q[X]. One can check directly (using
1.6) that it is irreducible, and its resolvant cubic is (X + 10)(X + 4)(X −4). Hence Gf = V .
Example 4.11. Consider f(X) = X4 −2 ∈Q[X].
It is irreducible by Eisenstein’s
criterion, and its resolvant cubic is g(X) = X3 + 8X. Hence M = Q[i
√
2]. One can check
that f is irreducible over M, and so its Galois group is D4.
Alternatively, analyze the equation as in (3.20).
Maple knows how to factor polynomials over Q and over Q[α] where α is a root of an
irreducible polynomial. To learn the syntax, type: ?Factor.
4.5. Examples of polynomials with Sp as Galois group over Q.
The next lemma gives a criterion for a subgroup of Sp to be the whole of Sp.
Lemma 4.12. Let p be a prime number. Then Sp is generated by any transposition and
any p-cycle.
Proof. After renumbering, we may assume that the transposition is τ = (12). Let the
p-cycle be σ = (i1 · · · ip); we may choose to write σ so that 1 occurs in the ﬁrst position,
σ = (1 i2 · · · ip). Now some power of σ will map 1 to 2 and will still be a p-cycle (here is where
we use that p is prime). After replacing σ with the power, we may suppose σ = (1 2 j3 . . .jp),
and after renumbering again, we may suppose σ = (1 2 3 . . . p). Then we’ll have (2 3), (3 4),
(4 5), . . . in the group generated by σ and τ, and these elements generated Sp.
Proposition 4.13. Let f be an irreducible polynomial of prime degree p in Q[X]. If f
splits in C and has exactly two nonreal roots, then Gf = Sp.
Proof. Let E ⊂C be the splitting ﬁeld of f, and let α ∈E be a root of f. Because f is
irreducible, [Q[α] : Q] = deg f = p, and so p|[E : Q] = (Gf : 1). Therefore Gf contains an
element of order p (Cauchy’s theorem), but the only elements of order p in Sp are p-cycles
(here we use that p is prime again).
Let σ be complex conjugation on C. Then σ transposes the two nonreal roots of f(X)
and ﬁxes the rest. Therefore Gf ⊂Sp contains a transposition and a p-cycle, and so is the
whole of Sp.

It remains to construct polynomials satisfying the conditions of the Proposition.
Example 4.14. Let p≥5 be a prime number. Choose a positive even integer m and even
integers
n1 < n2 < · · · < np−2.
Let f(X) = g(X) −2, where
g(X) = (X2 + m)(X −n1)...(X −np−2).
When we write f(X) = Xp+a1Xp−1+· · ·+ap, then all ai are even, and ap = −(m  ni)−2
is not divisible by 4. Hence Eisenstein’s criterion implies that f(X) is irreducible.
The polynomial g(X) certainly has exactly two nonreal roots. Its graph crosses the x-axis
exactly p −2 times, and its maxima and minima all have absolute value > 2 (because its
values at odd integers have absolute value > 2). Hence the graph of f(X) = g(X) −2 also
crosses the x-axis exactly p −2 times.
4.6. Finite ﬁelds.
Let Fp = Z/pZ, the ﬁeld of p elements. As we noted in §1.2, any other ﬁeld E of characteristic
p contains a copy of Fp, namely, {m1E | m ∈Z}. No harm results if we identify Fp with this
subﬁeld of E.
Let E be a ﬁeld of degree n over Fp. Then E has q = pn elements, and so E× is a group
of order q −1. Hence the nonzero elements of E are roots Xq−1 −1, and all elements of E
(including 0) are roots of Xq −X. Hence E is a splitting ﬁeld for Xq −X, and so any two
ﬁelds with q elements are isomorphic.
Now let E be the splitting ﬁeld of f(X) = Xq −X, q = pn. The derivative f′(X) = −1,
which is relatively prime to f(X) (in fact, to every polynomial), and so f(X) has q distinct
roots in E. Let S be the set of its roots. Then S is obviously closed under multiplication
and the formation of inverses, but it is also closed under subtraction: if aq −a = 0 and
bq −b = 0, then
(a −b)q = aq −bq = a −b.
Hence S is a ﬁeld, and so S = E. In particular, E has pn elements.
Proposition 4.15. For each power q = pn there is a ﬁeld Fq with q elements. It is the
splitting ﬁeld of Xq −X, and hence any two such ﬁelds are isomorphic. Moreover, Fq is
Galois over Fp with cyclic Galois group generated by the Frobenius automorphism σ(a) = ap.
Proof. Only the ﬁnal statement remains to be proved. The ﬁeld Fq is Galois over Fp
because it is the splitting ﬁeld of a separable polynomial. We noted in (1.3) that σ = (x 
→xp)
is an automorphism of Fq. It has order n, and a ∈Fq is ﬁxed by σ if and only if ap = a. But
Fp consists exactly of such elements, and so the ﬁxed ﬁeld of < σ > is Fp. This proves that
< σ >= Gal(Fq/Fp).
Corollary 4.16. Let E be a ﬁeld with pn elements. Then E contains exactly one ﬁeld
with pm elements for each m|n, m ≥0, and E is Galois over that ﬁeld.
Proof. We know that E is Galois over Fp and that Gal(E/Fp) is the cyclic group of order
n generated by σ. The subgroups of < σ > are the groups < σm > with m|n. The ﬁxed
ﬁeld of < σm > is Fpm.
Corollary 4.17. Every extension of ﬁnite ﬁelds is simple.

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
33
Proof. Consider E ⊃F. Then E× is a ﬁnite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a
ﬁeld, and hence is cyclic (see Exercise 3). If ζ generates E× as a multiplicative group, then
clearly E = Fp[ζ].
Corollary 4.18. Each monic irreducible polynomial of degree d|n in Fp[X] occurs ex-
actly once as a factor of Xpn −X.
Proof. First, the factors of Xpn −X are distinct because it has no common factor with its
derivative. If f(X) is irreducible of degree d, then f(X) has a root in a ﬁeld of degree d over
Fp. But the splitting ﬁeld of Xpn −X contains a copy of every ﬁeld of degree d over Fp with
d|n. Hence some root of Xpn −X is also a root of f(X), and therefore f(X)|Xpn −X.
Maple factors polynomials modulo p very quickly. The syntax is “Factor(f(X)) mod p;”.
Thus, for example, to obtain a list of all monic polynomials of degree 1, 2, or 4 over F5, ask
Maple to factor X625 −X.
Let F be an algebraic closure of Fp. Then F contains one ﬁeld Fpn for each integer n ≥1—
it consists of all roots of Xpn −X—and Fpm ⊂Fpn ⇐⇒m|n. The partially ordered set of
ﬁnite subﬁelds of F is isomorphic to the set of integers n ≥1 partially ordered by divisibility.
Finite ﬁelds were sometimes called Galois ﬁelds, and Fq used to be denoted GF(q) (it still
is in Maple). Maple contains a “Galois ﬁeld package” to do computations in ﬁnite ﬁelds. For
example, it can ﬁnd a primitive element for Fq (i.e., a generator for F×
q ). To start it, type:
readlib(GF);.
4.7. Computing Galois groups over Q.
We sketch a practical method for computing Galois groups over Q and similar ﬁelds. Our
ﬁrst result generalizes Proposition 4.4.
Proposition 4.19. Let f(X) be a monic separable polynomial in F[X] of degree m with
distinct roots, and suppose that Gf ⊂Sm has r orbits with m1, . . . , mr elements respectively
(so that m = m1 + · · · + mr); then f factors as f = f1 · · · fr with fi irreducible of degree mi.
Proof. Let α1, . . . , αm be the distinct roots of f(X). For S ⊂{1, 2, . . . , m}, consider
fS = 
i∈S(X −αi). This polynomial divides f(X) in Ff[X], and it is ﬁxed under the action
of Gf (and hence has coeﬃcients in F) if and only if S is stable under Gf. Therefore the
irreducible factors are the polynomials fS corresponding to minimal subsets S of {1, . . . , m}
stable under G, but such sets S are precisely the orbits of G in {1, . . . , m}.
Now suppose F is ﬁnite, with pn elements say, and let E be the splitting ﬁeld of f. The
Galois group of E over F is generated by the Frobenius automorphism σ : x 
→xpn. When
we regard σ as a permutation of the roots of f, then its factors in the cycle decomposition
of σ correspond to the distinct orbits of σ. Hence, if the degrees of the distinct irreducible
factors of f are m1, m2, . . . , mr, then σ has a cycle decompostion of type
m1 + · · · + mr = m.
Lemma 4.20. Let R be a unique factorization domain with ﬁeld of fractions F, and let f
be a monic polynomial in R[X]. Let P be a prime ideal in R, and let ¯f be the image of f
in (R/P)[X]. Assume neither f nor ¯f has a multiple root. Then the roots α1, . . . , αm of f
lie in R, and their reductions ¯αi modulo P are the roots of ¯f. Moreover G ¯f ⊂Gf when both
are identiﬁed with subgroups of Sym{α1, . . . , αm} = Sym{¯α1, . . . , ¯αm}.

34
J.S. MILNE
Proof. Omitted—see van der Waerden, Modern Algebra, I, §61 (second edition) or Math
676 (Algebraic Number Theory).
On combining these results, we obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 4.21 (Dedekind). Let f(X) ∈Z[X] be a monic polynomial of degree m, and
let p be a prime such that f mod p has simple roots (equivalently, D(f) is not divisible by
p). Suppose that ¯f =  fi with fi irreducible of degree mi in Fp[X]. Then Gf contains an
element whose cycle decomposition corresponds to the partition:
m = m1 + · · · + mr.
Example 4.22. Consider X5−X−1. Modulo 2, this factors as (X2+X+1)(X3+X2+1),
and modulo 3 it is irreducible. Hence Gf contains (12345) and (ik)(lmn), and hence also
((ik)(lmn))3 = (ik). Therefore Gf = S5.
Lemma 4.23. A transitive subgroup of H ⊂Sn containing a transposition and an (n−1)-
cycle is equal to Sn.
Proof. Let (123 . . . n −1) be the (n −1)-cycle. By virtue of the transitivity, the trans-
position can be transformed into (in), some 1 ≤i ≤n −1. Now the (n −1)-cycle and
its powers will transform this into (1n), (2n), . . . , (n −1 n), and these elements obviously
generate Sn.
Example 4.24. Select monic polynomials of degree n, f1, f2, f3 with coeﬃcients in Z such
that:
(a) f1 is irreducible modulo 2;
(b) f2 = (degree 1)(irreducible of degree n −1) mod 3;
(c) f3 = (irreducible of degree 2)(product of 1 or 2 irreducible polys of odd degree) mod 5.
We choose them to have distinct roots. Take
f = −15f1 + 10f2 + 6f3.
Then
(i) Gf is transitive (it contains an n-cycle because f ≡f1 mod 2);
(ii) Gf contains a cycle of length n −1 (because f ≡f2 mod 3);
(iii) Gf contains a transposition (because f ≡f3 mod 5, and so it contains the product of a
transposition with a commuting element of odd order; on raising this to an appropriate
odd power, we are left with the transposition). Hence Gf is Sn.
This gives the following strategy for computing Galois groups over Q. Factor f modulo
a sequence of primes p not dividing D(f) to determine the cycle types of the elements in
Gf—a diﬃcult theorem in number theory, the eﬀective Chebotarev density theorem, says
that if a cycle type occurs in Gf, then this will be seen by looking modulo a set of prime
numbers of positive density, and will occur for a prime less than some bound. Now look up
a table of transitive subgroups of Sn with order divisible by n and their cycle type. If this
doesn’t suﬃce to determine the group, then look at its action on the set of subsets of r roots
for some r.

few exceptions, these invariants are suﬃcient to determine the subgroup up to isomorphism.

5. Applications of Galois Theory
In this section, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory to obtain other
results about polynomials and extensions of ﬁelds.
5.1. Primitive element theorem.
Recall that a ﬁnite extension of ﬁelds E/F is simple if E = F[α] for some element α of E.
Such an α is called a primitive element of E. We shall show that (at least) all separable
extensions have primitive elements.
Consider for example Q[
√
2,
√
3]/Q. We know (see Exercise 13) that its Galois group over
Q is a 4-group < σ, τ >, where

the elements of Q[

√

Q[

It is clear that this argument should work much more generally.
We say that an element α algebraic over a ﬁeld F is separable over F if its minimum
polynomial over F has no multiple roots. Thus a ﬁnite extension E of F is separable if and
only if all its elements are separable over F.
Theorem 5.1. Let E = F[α1, ..., αr] be a ﬁnite extension of F, and assume that α2, ..., αr
are separable over F (but not necessarily α1). Then there is an element γ ∈E such that
E = F[γ].
Proof. For ﬁnite ﬁelds, we proved this in (4.16). Hence we may assume F to be inﬁnite.
It suﬃces to prove the statement for r = 2. Thus let E = F[α, β] with β separable over
F[α]. Let f and g be the minimum polynomials of α and β over F. Let α1 = α, . . . , αs be
the roots of f in some ﬁeld containing E, and let β1 = β, β2, . . . , βt be the roots of g. For
j ̸= 1, βj ̸= β1, and so the the equation
αi + Xβj = α1 + Xβ1,
j ̸= 1,
has exactly one solution, namely, X = αi−α1
β1−βj . If we choose a c diﬀerent from any of these
solutions (using that F is inﬁnite), then
αi + cβj ̸= α + cβ unless i = 1 = j.
I claim that γ = α + cβ generates E over F.
The polynomials g(X) and f(γ −cX) have coeﬃcients in F[γ][X], and have β as a root:
g(β) = 0,
f(γ −cβ) = f(α) = 0.
In fact, β is their only common root, because the roots of g are β1, ..., βt, and we chose c so
that γ −cβj ̸= αi unless i = 1 = j. Therefore gcd(g(X), f(γ −cX)) computed in some ﬁeld

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
37
splitting fg is X −β, but we have seen (Proposition 3.1) that the gcd of two polynomials
has coeﬃcients in the same ﬁeld as the coeﬃcients of the polynomials. Hence β ∈F[γ], and
then α = γ −cβ also lies in F[γ].
Remark 5.2. Assume F to be inﬁnite. The proof shows that γ can be chosen to be of
the form
γ = α1 + c2α2 + · · · + crαr,
ci ∈F.
In fact, all but a ﬁnite number of elements of this form will serve. If E = F[α1, . . . , αr] is
Galois over F, then an element of this form will be a primitive element provided it is moved
by every element of Gal(E/F) except 1. These remarks make it very easy to write down
primitive elements.
Our hypotheses are minimal: if two of the α’s are not separable, then the extension need
not be simple. Before proving this, we need another result.
Proposition 5.3. Let E = F[γ] be a simple algebraic extension of F. Then there are
only ﬁnitely many intermediate ﬁelds M,
F ⊂M ⊂E.
Proof. Let M be such a ﬁeld, and let g(X) be the minimum polynomial of γ over M.
Let M′ be the subﬁeld of E generated over F by the coeﬃcients of g(X). Clearly M′ ⊂M,
but (equally clearly) g(X) is the minimum polynomial of γ over M′. Hence
[E : M′] = deg g = [E : M],
and so M = M′: M is generated by the coeﬃcients of g(X).
Let f(X) be the minimum polynomial of γ over F. Then g(X) divides f(X) in M[X], and
hence also in E[X]. Therefore, there are only ﬁnitely many possible g’s, and consequently
only ﬁnitely many possible M’s.
Remark 5.4. (a) Note that the proposition in fact gives a description of all the interme-
diate ﬁelds: each is generated over F by the coeﬃcients of a factor g(X) of f(X) in E[X].
The coeﬃcients of such a g(X) are partially symmetric polynomials in the roots of f(X)
(i.e., ﬁxed by some, but not necessarily all, of the permutations of the roots).
(b) The proposition has a converse: if E is a ﬁnite extension of F and there are only ﬁnitely
many intermediate ﬁelds M, F ⊂M ⊂E, then E is a simple extension of F (see Dummit,
p508). This gives another proof of the theorem when E is separable over F, because Galois
theory shows that there are only ﬁnitely many intermediate ﬁelds in this case (embed E in
a Galois extension of F).
(c) The simplest nonsimple extension is k(X, Y ) ⊃k(Xp, Y p) = F, where k is an alge-
braically closed ﬁeld of characteristic p. For any c ∈k, we have
k(X, Y ) = F[X, Y ] ⊃F[X + cY ] ⊃F
with the degree of each extension equal to p. If F[X + cY ] = F[X + c′Y ], c ̸= c′, then
F[X + cY ] would contain both X and Y , which is impossible because [k(X, Y ) : F] = p2.
Hence there are inﬁnitely many distinct intermediate ﬁelds.3
3Zariski showed that there is even an intermediate ﬁeld M that is not isomorphic to F (X, Y ), and Piotr
Blass showed in his UM thesis, 1977, using the methods of algebraic geometry, that there is an inﬁnite
sequence of intermediate ﬁelds, no two of which are isomorphic.

5.2. Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.
We ﬁnally prove the misnamed4 fundamental theorem of algebra.
Theorem 5.5. The ﬁeld C of complex numbers is algebraically closed.
Proof. Deﬁne C to be the splitting ﬁeld of X2 + 1 ∈R[X], and let i be a root of X2 + 1
in C; thus C = R[i]. We have to show (see 2.10) that every f(X) ∈R[X] has a root in C.
The two facts we need to assume about R are:
• Positive real numbers have square roots.
• Every polynomial of odd degree with real coeﬃcients has a real root.
Both are immediate consequences of the Intermediate Value Theorem, which says that a
continuous function on a closed interval takes every value between its maximum and mini-
mum values (inclusive). (Intuitively, this says that, unlike the rationals, the real line has no
“holes”.)
We ﬁrst show that every element of C has a square root. Write α = a + bi, with a, b ∈R,
and choose c, d to be real numbers such that
c2 = (a +
√
a2 + b2)
2
,
d2 = (−a +
√
a2 + b2)
2
.
Then c2 −d2 = a and (2cd)2 = b2. If we choose the signs of c and d so that cd has the same
sign as b, then (c + di)2 = α.
Let f(X) ∈R[X], and let E be a splitting ﬁeld for f(X)(X2 + 1)—we have to show that
E = C. Since R has characteristic zero, the polynomial is separable, and so E is Galois over
R. Let G be its Galois group, and let H be a Sylow 2-subgroup of G.
Let M = EH. Then M is of odd degree over R, and M = R[α] some α (Theorem 5.1).
The minimum polynomial of α over R has odd degree, and so has a root in R. It therefore
has degree 1, and so M = R and G = H.
We now have that Gal(E/C) is a 2-group. If it is ̸= 1, then it has a subgroup N of index
2. The ﬁeld EN has degree 2 over C, and can therefore be obtained by extracting the square
root of an element of C (see 3.23), but we have seen that all such elements already lie in C.
Hence EN = C, which is a contradiction. Thus E = C.
Corollary 5.6. (a) The ﬁeld C is the algebraic closure of R.
(b) The set of all algebraic numbers is an algebraic closure of Q.
Proof. Part (a) is obvious from the deﬁnition of “algebraic closure”, and (b) follows from
the discussion on p15.
4Because it is not strictly a theorem in algebra: it is a statement about R whose construction is part of
analysis. In fact, I prefer the proof based on Liouville’s theorem in complex analysis to the more algebraic
proof given in the text: if f(z) is a polynomial without a root in C, then f(z)−1 will be bounded and
holomorphic on the whole complex plane, and hence (by Liouville) constant. The Fundamental Theorem
was quite a diﬃcult theorem to prove. Gauss gave a proof in his doctoral dissertation in 1798 in which he
used some geometric arguments which he didn’t justify. He gave the ﬁrst rigorous proof in 1816. The elegant
argument given here is a simpliﬁcation by Emil Artin of earlier proofs.

5.3. Cyclotomic extensions.
A primitive nth root of 1 in F is an element of order n in F ×. Such an element can exist
only if F has characteristic 0 or characteristic p not dividing n.
Proposition 5.7. Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic 0 or characteristic p not dividing n.
Let E be the splitting ﬁeld of Xn −1.
(a) There exists a primitive nth root of 1 in E.
(b) If ζ is a primitive nth root of 1 in E, then E = F[ζ].
(c) The ﬁeld E is Galois over F, and the map
Gal(E/F) →(Z/nZ)×
sending σ to [i] if σζ = ζi is injective.
Proof. (a) The roots of Xn −1 are distinct, because its derivative nXn−1 has only zero
as a root (we use here the condition on the characteristic), and so E contains n distinct nth
roots of 1. The nth roots of one form a ﬁnite subgroup of E×, and so (see Exercise 3) they
form a cyclic group. Any generator will have order n, and hence will be a primitive nth root
of 1.
(b) The roots of Xn −1 are the powers of ζ, and F[ζ] contains them all.
(c) If ζ is one primitive nth root of 1, then the remaining primitive nth roots of 1 are the
elements ζi with i relatively prime to n. Since σζ is again a primitive nth root of 1 for any
automorphism σ of E, it equals ζi for some i relatively prime to n, and the map σ 
→i
mod n is injective because ζ generates E over F. It obviously is a homomorphism (and is
independent of the choice of ζ).
The map σ 
→i : Gal(F[ζ]/F) →(Z/nZ)× need not be surjective. For example, if F = C,
then its image is {1}, and if F = R, it is {±1} (n ̸= 2)—because F[ζ] = C, Gal(C/R) is
generated by complex conjugation ι, and ιζ = ¯ζ = ζn−1. On the other hand, when n = p is
prime, we saw in (1.31) that [Q[ζ] : Q] = p −1, and so the map is surjective. We shall prove
that the map is surjective for all n when F = Q.
The polynomial Xn −1 has some obvious factors in Q[X], namely, the polynomials Xd −1
for any d|n. The quotient of Xn −1 by all these factors for d < n is called the nth cyclotomic
polynomial Φn. Thus
Φn =

(X −ζ)
(product over the primitive nth roots of 1).
It has degree ϕ(n), the order of (Z/nZ)×. Since every nth root of 1 is a primitive dth root of
1 for exactly one d dividing n, we see that
Xn −1 =

d|n
Φd(X).
For example, Φ1(X) = X −1, Φ2(X) = X + 1, Φ3(X) = X2 + X + 1, and
Φ6(X) =
X6 −1
(X −1)(X + 1)(X2 + X + 1) = X2 −X + 1.
This gives an easy inductive method of computing the cyclotomic polynomials. Alterna-
tively ask Maple by typing: with(numtheory); cyclotomic(n,X);. Because Xn −1 has
coeﬃcients in Z and is monic, any monic factor of it has coeﬃcients in Z (see (1.6)). In
particular, the cyclotomic polynomials lie in Z[X].

Lemma 5.8. Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic 0 or p not dividing n, and let ζ be a primitive
nth root of 1 in some extension ﬁeld. The following are equivalent:
(a) the nth cyclotomic polynomial Φn is irreducible;
(b) the degree [F[ζ] : F] = ϕ(n);
(c) the homomorphism
Gal(F[ζ]/F) →(Z/nZ)×
is an isomorphism.
Proof. Because ζ is a root of Φn, the minimum polynomial of ζ divides Φn. It is equal to
it if and only if [F[ζ] : F] = ϕ(n), which is true if and only if the injection Gal(F[ζ]/F) →
(Z/nZ)× is onto.
Theorem 5.9. The nth cyclotomic polynomial Φn is irreducible in Q[X].
Proof. Let f(X) be a monic irreducible factor of Φn in Q[X]. Its roots will be primitive
nth roots of 1, and we have to show they include all primitive nth roots of 1. For this it
suﬃces to show that
ζ a root of f(X) =⇒ζi a root of f(X) for all i such that gcd(i, n) = 1.
Such an i is a product of primes not dividing n, and so it suﬃces to show that
ζ a root of f(X) =⇒ζp a root of f(X) for all primes p ∤n.
Write
Φn(X) = f(X)g(X).
Again (1.6) implies that f(X) and g(X) lie in Z[X]. Suppose ζ is a root of f, but that for
some prime p not dividing n, ζp is not a root of f. Then ζp is a root g(X), which implies
that ζ is a root of g(Xp). Since f(X) and g(Xp) have a common root, their greatest common
divisor (in Q[X]) is ̸= 1 (see 3.1). Write h(X) 
→¯h(X) for the map Z[X] 
→Fp[X], and note
that
gcd(f(X), g(Xp)) ̸= 1 =⇒gcd( ¯f(X), ¯g(Xp)) ̸= 1.
But ¯g(Xp) = ¯g(X)p (use the
mod p binomial theorem and that ap = a for all a ∈Fp), and
so gcd( ¯f(X), ¯g(X)p) ̸= 1, which implies that ¯f(X) and ¯g(X) have a common factor. Hence
Xn −1 (regarded as an element of Fp[X]) has multiple roots, but we saw in the proof of 5.7
that it doesn’t. Contradiction.
Remark 5.10. This proof is very old—in essence it goes back to Dedekind in 1857—but
its general scheme has recently become very popular: take a statement in characteristic zero,
reduce modulo p (where the statement may no longer be true), and exploit the existence
of the Frobenius automorphism a 
→ap to obtain a proof of the original statement. For
example, commutative algebraists use this method to prove results about commutative rings,
and there are theorems about complex manifolds5 that have only been proved by reducing
things to characteristic p.
There are some beautiful and mysterious relations between what happens in characteristic
0 and in characteristic p. For example, let f(X1, ..., Xn) ∈Z[X1, ..., Xn]. We can
(i) look at the solutions of f = 0 in C, and so get a topological space;
(ii) reduce mod p, and look at the solutions of ¯f = 0 in Fpn.
5This is from my old notes—I no longer remember what I was thinking of.

The Weil conjectures (Weil 1949; proved by Grothendieck and Deligne 1973) assert that the
Betti numbers of the space in (i) control the cardinalities of the sets in (ii).
Theorem 5.11. The regular n-gon is constructible if and only if n = 2kp1 · · · ps where
the pi are distinct Fermat primes.
Proof. The regular n-gon is constructible if and only if cos 2π
n (or ζ = e2πi/n) is con-
structible. We know that Q[ζ] is Galois over Q, and so (according to 1.27 and 3.22) ζ is
constructible if and only if [Q[ζ] : Q] is a power of 2. But (see Groups 3.10)
ϕ(n) =

p|n
(p −1)pn(p)−1,
n =

pn(p),
and this is a power of 2 if and only if n has the required form.
Remark 5.12. The ﬁnal section of Gauss’s, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801) is titled
“Equations deﬁning sections of a Circle”. In it Gauss proves that the nth roots of 1 form
a cyclic group, that Xn −1 is solvable (this was before the theory of abelian groups had
been developed, and before Galois), and that the regular n-gon is constructible when n is as
in the Theorem. He also claimed to have proved the converse statement6. This leads some
people to credit him with the above proof of the irreducibility of Φn, but in the absence of
further evidence, I’m sticking with Dedekind.
5.4. Independence of characters.
Theorem 5.13 (Dedekind’s theorem on the independence of characters). Let
F
be
a
ﬁeld, and let G be a group (monoid will do). Then any ﬁnite set {χ1, . . . , χm} of homo-
morphisms G →F × is linearly independent over F, i.e.,

aiχi = 0 (as a function G →E) =⇒a1 = 0, . . . , am = 0.
Proof. Induction on m. If m = 1, it’s obvious. Assume it for m −1. We suppose
a1χ1(x) + a2χ2(x) + · · · + amχm(x) = 0
for all x ∈G,
and show that this implies the ai to be zero. Since χ1 ̸= χ2, χ1(g) ̸= χ2(g) for some g ∈G.
On replacing x with gx in the equation, we obtain the equation
a1χ1(g)χ1(x) + a2χ1(g)χ2(x) + · · · + amχ1(g)χm(x) = 0,
all x ∈G.
On multiplying the ﬁrst equation by χ1(g) and subtracting it from the second, we obtain
the equation
a′
2χ2 + · · · + a′
mχm = 0,
a′
i = ai(χi(g) −χ1(g)).
The induction hypothesis now shows that a′
i = 0 for all i ≥2. Since χ2(g) −χ1(g) ̸= 0, we
must have a2 = 0, and the induction hypothesis shows that all the remaining ai’s are also
zero.

Corollary 5.14. Let F1 and F2 be ﬁelds, and let σ1, ..., σm be distinct homomorphisms
F1 →F2. Then σ1, ..., σm are linearly independent over F2.
Proof. Apply the theorem to χi = σi|F ×
1 .
5.5. Hilbert’s Theorem 90.
Let G be a ﬁnite group. A G-module is an abelian group M together with an action of G,
i.e., a map G × M →M such that
(a) σ(m + m′) = σm + σm′ for all σ ∈G, m, m′ ∈M;
(b) (στ)(m) = σ(τm) for all σ, τ ∈G, m ∈M;
(c) 1m = m for all m ∈M.
Thus, to give an action of G on M is the same as to give a homomorphism G →Aut(M)
(automorphisms of M as an abelian group).
Example 5.15. Let E be a Galois extension of F, with Galois group G; then (E, +) and
E× are G-modules.
Let M be a G-module. A crossed homomorphism is a map f : G →M such that
f(στ) = f(σ) + σf(τ).
Note that the condition implies that f(1) = f(1 · 1) = f(1) + f(1), and so f(1) = 0.
Example 5.16. (a) Consider a crossed homomorphism f : G →M, and let σ ∈G. Then
f(σ2) = f(σ) + σf(σ),
f(σ3) = f(σ · σ2) = f(σ) + σf(σ) + σ2f(σ)
and so on, until
f(σn) = f(σ) + σf(σ) + · · · + σn−1f(σ).
Thus, if G is a cyclic group of order n generated by σ, then a crossed homomorphism
f : G →M is determined by f(σ) = x, and x satisﬁes the equation
x + σx + · · · + σn−1x = 0,
(∗)
Conversely, if x ∈M satisﬁes (*), then the formulas f(σi) = x + σx + · · · + σi−1x deﬁne a
crossed homomorphism f : G →M. In this case we have a one-to-one correspondence
{crossed homs f : G →M}
f→f(σ)
↔
{x ∈M satisfying (∗)}.
(b) For any x ∈M, we obtain a crossed homomorphism by putting
f(σ) = σx −x,
all σ ∈G.
Such a crossed homomorphism is called a principal crossed homomorphism.
(c) If G acts trivially on M, i.e., σm = m for all σ ∈G and m ∈M, then a crossed
homomorphism is simply a homomorphism, and there are no nontrivial principal crossed
homomorphisms.
The sum of two crossed homomorphisms is again a crossed homomorphism, and the sum
of two principal crossed homomorphisms is again principal. Thus we can deﬁne
H1(G, M) =
{crossed homomorphisms}
{principal crossed homomorphisms}.

The cohomology groups Hn(G, M) have been deﬁned for all n ∈N, but since this was not
done until the twentieth century, it will not be discussed in this course.
Example 5.17. Let π : X →X be the universal covering space of a topological space X,
and let Γ be the group of covering transformations. Under some fairly general hypotheses, a
Γ-module M will deﬁne a sheaf M on X, and H1(X, M) ≈H1(Γ, M). For example, when
M = Z with the trivial action of Γ, this becomes the isomorphism H1(X, Z) ≈H1(Γ, Z) =
Hom(Γ, Z).
Theorem 5.18. Let E be a Galois extension of F with group G; then H1(G, E×) = 0,
i.e., every crossed homomorphism G →E× is principal.
Proof. Let f be a crossed homomorphism G →E×. In multiplicative notation, this
means,
f(στ) = f(σ) · σ(f(τ)),
σ, τ ∈G,
and we have to ﬁnd a γ ∈E× such that f(σ) = σγ/γ for all σ ∈G. Because the f(τ) are
nonzero, Dedekind’s theorem implies that

f(τ)τ : E →E
is not the zero map, i.e., there exists an α ∈E such that
β =

τ∈G
f(τ)τα ̸= 0.
But then, for σ ∈G,
σβ =

τ∈G
σ(f(τ)) · στ(α) =

τ∈G
f(σ)−1 f(στ) · στ(α) = f(σ)−1 
τ∈G
f(στ)στ(α) = f(σ)−1β,
which shows that f(σ) =
β
σ(β) and so we can take β = γ−1.
Let E be a Galois extension of F with Galois group G. We deﬁne the norm of an element
α ∈E to be
Nm α =

σ∈G
σα.
Then, for τ ∈G,
τ(Nm α) =

σ∈G
τσα = Nm α,
and so Nm α ∈F. The map α 
→Nmα : E× →F × is a homomorphism. For example, the
norm map C× →R× is α 
→|α|2 and the norm map Q[
√
d]× →Q× is a + b
√
d 
→a2 −db2.
We are interested in determining the kernel of this homomorphism. Clearly if α is of the
form
β
τβ, then Nm(α) = 1. Our next result show that, for cyclic extensions, all elements with
norm 1 are of this form.
Corollary 5.19 (Hilbert’s theorem 90). 7Let E be a ﬁnite cyclic extension of F with
Galois group < σ >; if NmE/F α = 1, then α = β/σβ for some β ∈E.
7The theorem is Satz 90 in Hilbert’s book, Theorie der Algebraische Zahlk¨orper, 1897, which laid the
foundations for modern algebraic number theory. Many point to it as a book that made a fundamental
contribution to mathematical progress, but Emil Artin has been quoted as saying that it set number theory
back thirty years—it wasn’t suﬃciently abstract for his taste.

J.S. MILNE
Proof. Let m = [E : F]. The condition on α is that α · σα · · · σm−1α = 1, and so (see
5.16a) there is a crossed homomorphism f :<σ>→E× with f(σ) = α. The theorem now
shows that f is principal, which means that there is a β with f(σ) = β/σβ.
5.6. Cyclic extensions.
We are now able to classify the cyclic extensions of degree n of a ﬁeld F in the case that F
contains n nth roots of 1.
Theorem 5.20. Let F be a ﬁeld containing a primitive nth root of 1.
(a) The Galois group of Xn −a is cyclic of order dividing n.
(b) Conversely, if E is cyclic of degree n over F, then there is an element β ∈E such that
E = F[β] and b =df βn ∈F; hence E is the splitting ﬁeld of Xn −b.
Proof. (a) If α is one root of Xn −a, then the other roots are the elements of the form
ζα with ζ an n th root of 1. Hence the splitting ﬁeld of Xn −a is F[α]. The map σ 
→σα
α is
an injective homomorphism of Gal(F[α]/F) into the cyclic group <ζ> .
(b) Let ζ be a primitive nth root of 1 in F, and let σ generate Gal(E/F). Then Nm ζ =
ζn = 1, and so, according to Hilbert’s Theorem 90, there is an element β ∈E such that
σβ = ζβ. Then σiβ = ζiβ, and so only the identity element of Gal(E/F[β]) ﬁxes β—we
conclude by the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory that E = F[β]. On the other hand
σβn = ζnβn = βn, and so βn ∈F.
Remark 5.21. (a) Under the hypothesis of the theorem Xn −a is irreducible, and its
Galois group is of order n, if
(i) a is not a pth power for any p dividing n;
(ii) if 4|n then a /∈−4k4.
See Lang, Algebra, VIII, §9, Theorem 16.
(b) If F has characteristic p (hence has no pth roots of 1 other than 1), then Xp −X −a
is irreducible in F[X] unless a = bp −b for some b ∈F, and when it is irreducible, its Galois
group is cyclic of order p (generated by α 
→α + 1 where α is a root). Moreover, every
extension of F which is cyclic of degree p is the splitting ﬁeld of such a polynomial.
Remark 5.22 (Kummer theory). Above we gave a description of all Galois extensions of
F with Galois group cyclic of order n in the case that F contains a primitive nth root of
1. Under the same assumption on F, it is possible to give a description of all the Galois
extensions of F with abelian Galois group of exponent n, i.e., a quotient of (Z/nZ)r for some
r.
Let E be such an extension of F, and let
S(E) = {a ∈F × | a becomes an nth power in E};
Then S(E) is a subgroup of F × containing F ×n, and the map E 
→S(E) deﬁnes a one-
to-one correspondence between abelian extensions of E of exponent n and groups S(E),
F × ⊃S(E) ⊃F ×n, such that (S(E) : F ×n) < ∞. The ﬁeld E is recovered from S(E) as the
splitting ﬁeld of (Xn −a) (product over a set of representatives for S(E)/F ×n). Moreover,
there is a perfect pairing
(a, σ) 
→σa
a : S(E)
F ×n × Gal(E/F) →µn (group of nth roots of 1).
In particular, [E : F] = (S(E) : F ×n). (Cf. Exercise 5 for the case n = 2.)

5.7. Proof of Galois’s solvability theorem.
Recall that a polynomial f(X) ∈F[X] is said to be solvable if there is a tower of ﬁelds
F = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂F2 ⊂· · · ⊂Fm
such that
(a) Fi = Fi−1[αi], where αmi
i
∈Fi−1 for some mi;
(b) Fm splits f(X).
Theorem 5.23. Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic 0. A polynomial f ∈F[X] is solvable
if and only if its Galois group Gf is solvable.
Before proving the suﬃciency, we need a lemma.
Lemma 5.24. Let f ∈F[X] be separable, and let F ′ be an extension ﬁeld of F. Then the
Galois group of f as an element of F ′[X] is a subgroup of that of f as an element of F[X].
Proof. Let E′ be a splitting ﬁeld for f over F ′, and let α1, . . . , αm be the roots of
f(X) in E′.
Then E = F[α1, ..., αm] is a splitting ﬁeld of f over F.
Any element of
Gal(E′/F ′) permutes the αi and so maps E into itself. The map σ 
→σ|E is an injection
Gal(E′/F ′) →Gal(E/F).
Proof. (Gf solvable =⇒f solvable). Let f ∈F[X] have solvable Galois group. Let
F ′ = F[ζ] where ζ is a primitive nth root of 1 for some large n—for example, n = (deg f)!
will do. The lemma shows that the Galois group G of f as an element of F ′[X] is a subgroup
of Gf, and hence is solvable. This means that there is a sequence of subgroups
G = Gm ⊃Gm−1 ⊃· · · ⊃G1 ⊃G0 = {1}
such that each Gi is normal in Gi+1 and Gi+1/Gi is cyclic (even of prime order, but we don’t
need this). Let E be a splitting ﬁeld of f(X) over F ′, and let Fi = EGi. We have a sequence
of ﬁelds
F ⊂F[ζ] = F ′ ⊂F1 ⊂F2 ⊂· · · ⊂Fm = E
with Fi Galois over Fi−1 with cyclic Galois group. According to (5.20b), Fi = Fi−1[αi] with
α[Fi:Fi−1]
i
∈Fi−1. This shows that f is solvable.
Before proving the necessity, we need to make some observations.
Let Ωbe a Galois
extension of F, and let E be an extension of F contained in Ω. The Galois closure E of E
in Ωis the smallest subﬁeld of Ωcontaining E that is Galois over F. Let G = Gal(Ω/F)
and H = Gal(Ω/E). Then E will be the subﬁeld of Ωcorresponding to the largest normal
subgroup of G contained in H (Galois correspondence 3.17), but this is 
σ∈G σHσ−1 (see
Groups 4.10), and σHσ−1 corresponds to σE. Hence (see 3.18) E is the composite of the
ﬁelds σE, σ ∈G. In particular, we see that if E = F[α1, . . . , αm], then E is generated over
F by the elements σαi, σ ∈G.
Proof. (f solvable
=⇒
Gf solvable). It suﬃces to show that Gf is a quotient of a
solvable group. Hence it suﬃces to ﬁnd a Galois extension E of F with Gal( E/F) solvable
and such that f(X) splits in E[X].
We are given that f splits in an extension Fm of F with the following property: Fm =
F[α1, . . . , αm] and, for all i, there exists an mi such that αmi
i
∈F[α1, . . . , αi−1]. By (5.1)
we know Fm = F[γ] for some γ. Let g(X) be the minimum polynomial of γ over F, and let

46
J.S. MILNE
Ωbe a splitting ﬁeld of g(X)(Xn −1) for some suitably large n. We can identify Fm with a
subﬁeld of Ω. Let G = {σ1 = 1, σ2, . . .} be the Galois group of Ω/F and let ζ be a primitive
nth root of 1 in Ω. Choose E to be the Galois closure of Fm[ζ] in Ω. According to the above
remarks, E is generated over F by the elements
ζ, α1, α2, . . . , αm, σ2α1, . . . , σ2αm, σ3α1, . . . .
When we adjoin these elements one by one, we get a sequence of ﬁelds
F ⊂F[ζ] ⊂F[ζ, α1] ⊂· · · ⊂F ′ ⊂F ′′ ⊂· · · ⊂E
such that each ﬁeld F ′′ is obtained from its predecessor F ′ by adjoining an rth root of an
element of F ′. According to (5.20a) and (5.7), each of these extensions is Galois with cyclic
Galois group, and so G has a normal series with cyclic quotients. It is therefore solvable.
5.8. The general polynomial of degree n.
When we say that the roots of
aX2 + bX + c
are
−b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2
we are thinking of a, b, c as variables: for any particular values of a, b, c, the formula gives
the roots of the particular equation. We shall prove in this section that there is no similar
formula for the roots of the “general polynomial” of degree ≥5.
We deﬁne the general polynomial of degree n to be
f(X) = Xn −t1Xn−1 + · · · + (−1)ntn ∈F[t1, ..., tn][X]
where the ti are variables. We shall show that, when we regard f as a polynomial in X with
coeﬃcients in the ﬁeld F(t1, . . . , tn), its Galois group is Sn. Then Theorem 5.23 proves the
above remark (at least on characteristic zero).
Symmetric polynomials. Let
R
be
a commutative ring (with
1).
A polynomial
P(X1, ..., Xn) ∈R[X1, . . . , Xn] is said to be symmetric if it is unchanged when its vari-
ables are permuted, i.e., if
P(Xσ(1), . . . , Xσ(n)) = P(X1, . . . , Xn),
all σ ∈Sn.
For example
p1
=

i Xi
= X1 + X2 + · · · + Xn,
p2
=

i<j XiXj
= X1X2 + X1X3 + · · · + X1Xn + X2X3 + · · · + Xn−1Xn,
p3
=

i<j<k XiXjXk,
= X1X2X3 + · · ·
· · ·
pr
=

i1<···<ir Xi1...Xir
· · ·
pn
=
X1X2 · · · Xn
are all symmetric, because pr is the sum of all monomials of degree r made up out of distinct
Xi’s. These particular polynomials are called the elementary symmetric polynomials.
Theorem 5.25 (Symmetric polynomials theorem). Every
symmetric
polyno-
mial P(X1, ..., Xn) in R[X1, ..., Xn] is equal to a polynomial in the elementary symmetric
polynomials with coeﬃcients in R, i.e., P ∈R[p1, ..., pn].

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
47
Proof. We deﬁne an ordering on the monomials in the Xi by requiring that
Xi1
1 Xi2
2 · · · Xin
n > Xj1
1 Xj2
2 · · · Xjn
n
if either
i1 + i2 + · · · + in > j1 + j2 + · · · + jn
or equality holds and, for some s,
i1 = j1, . . . , is = js, but is+1 > js+1.
For example,
X1X3
2X3 > X1X2
2X3 > X1X2X2
3.
Let Xk1
1 · · · Xkn
n
be the highest monomial occurring in P with a coeﬃcient c ̸= 0. Because
P is symmetric, it contains all monomials obtained from Xk1
1 · · · Xkn
n
by permuting the X’s.
Hence k1 ≥k2 ≥· · · ≥kn.
The highest monomial in pi is X1 · · · Xi, and it follows that the highest monomial in
pd1
1 · · · pdn
n is
Xd1+d2+···+dn
1
Xd2+···+dn
2
· · · Xdn
n .
Therefore
P(X1, . . . , Xn) −cpk1−k2
1
pk2−k3
2
· · · pkn
n < P(X1, . . . , Xn).
We can repeat this argument with the polynomial on the left, and after a ﬁnite number of
steps, we will arrive at a representation of P as a polynomial in p1, . . . , pn.
Let f(X) = Xn + a1Xn−1 + · · · + an ∈R[X], and let α1, . . . , αn be the roots of f(X) in
some ring S containing R, i.e., f(X) = (X −αi) in S[X]. Then
a1 = −p1(α1, . . . , αn),
a2 = p2(α1, . . . , αn),
. . . ,
an = ±pn(α1, . . . , αn).
Thus the elementary symmetric polynomials in the roots of f(X) lie in R, and so the theorem
implies that every symmetric polynomial in the roots of f(X) lies in R. For example, the
discriminant
D(f) =

i<j
(αi −αj)2
of f lies in R.
The general polynomial.
Theorem 5.26 (Symmetric functions theorem). When Sn acts on E = F(X1, ..., Xn) by
permuting the Xi’s, the ﬁeld of invariants is F(p1, ..., pn).
Proof. Suppose f =
g
h, g, h ∈F[X1, . . . , Xn], is symmetric, i.e., ﬁxed by all σ ∈Sn.
Then H = 
σ∈Sn σh is symmetric, and so therefore is Hf. Both Hf and H are polynomials,
and therefore lie in F[p1, . . . , pn]. Hence their quotient f = Hf
H lies in F(p1, . . . , pn).
Corollary 5.27. The ﬁeld F(X1, ..., Xn) is Galois over F(p1, ..., pn) with Galois group
Sn (acting by permuting the Xi).
Proof. We have shown that F(p1, . . . , pn) = F(X1, . . . , Xn)Sn, and so this follows from
(3.12).
Theorem 5.28. The Galois group of the general polynomial of degree n is Sn.

48
J.S. MILNE
Proof. Let f(X) be the general polynomial of degree n,
f(X) = Xn −t1Xn−1 + · · · + (−1)ntn ∈F[t1, ..., tn][X].
Consider the homomorphism
F[t1, . . . , tn] →F[p1, . . . , pn],
ti 
→pi.
We shall prove shortly that this is an isomorphism, and therefore induces an isomorphism
on the ﬁelds of fractions
F(t1, . . . , tn) →F(p1, . . . , pn),
ti 
→pi.
Under this isomorphism, f(X) corresponds to
g(X) = Xn −p1Xn−1 + · · · + (−1)npn.
But g(X) = (X −Xi) in F(X1, . . . , Xn)[X], and so F(X1, . . . , Xn) is the splitting ﬁeld of
g(X) ∈F(p1, . . . , pn)[X]. Therefore the last corollary shows that the Galois group of g is
Sn, which must also be the Galois group of f.
It remains to show that the homomorphism ti 
→pi is an isomorphism.
Let E ⊃
F(t1, . . . , tn) be a splitting ﬁeld of f, and let α1, ..., αn be the roots of f in E. Consider the
diagram
E ⊃F[α1, . . . , αn]
αi←Xi
←−
F[X1, . . . , Xn]
∪
∪
F[t1, . . . , tn]
ti→pi
−→
F[p1, . . . , pn].
The top and bottom maps are well-deﬁned because F[X1, ..., Xn] and F[t1, ..., tn] are poly-
nomial rings. The diagram commutes because ti = pi(α1, ..., αn). Hence the lower horizontal
map is injective, and, since it is obviously surjective, it is an isomorphism.
Remark 5.29. In the ﬁnal section of this course, we’ll discuss algebraic independence.
Then it will be obvious that the map ti 
→pi : F[t1, . . . , tn] →F[p1, . . . , pn] is an isomor-
phism, which simpliﬁes the proof.
Remark 5.30. Since Sn occurs as a Galois group over Q, and every ﬁnite group occurs
as a subgroup of some Sn, it follows that every ﬁnite group occurs as a Galois group over
some ﬁnite extension of Q, but does every ﬁnite Galois group occur as a Galois group over
Q itself?
The Hilbert-Noether program for proving this was the following.
Hilbert proved that if G occurs as the Galois group of an extension E ⊃Q(t1, ..., tn) (the ti
are variables), then it occurs inﬁnitely often as a Galois group over Q. For the proof, realize
E as the splitting ﬁeld of a polynomial f(X) ∈k[t1, . . . , tn][X] and prove that for inﬁnitely
many values of the ti, the polynomial you obtain in Q[X] has Galois group G. (This is quite
a diﬃcult theorem—see Serre, Lectures on the Mordell-Weil Theorem, Chapter 9.)
Noether conjectured the following: Let G ⊂Sn act on F(X1, ..., Xn) by permuting the Xi;
then F(X1, . . . , Xn)G ≈F(t1, ..., tn) (for variables ti).
Unfortunately, Swan proved in 1969 that the conjecture is false for C47. Hence this ap-
proach can not lead to a proof that all ﬁnite groups occur as Galois groups over Q, but it
doesn’t exclude other approaches. [For more information on the problem, see Serre, ibid.,
Chapter 10, and Serre, Topics in Galois Theory, 1992.]

Remark 5.31. Take F = C, and consider the subset of Cn+1 deﬁned by the equation
Xn −T1Xn−1 + · · · + (−1)nTn = 0.
It is a beautiful complex manifold S of dimension n. Consider the projection
π : S →Cn,
(x, t1, . . . , tn) 
→(t1, . . . , tn).
Its ﬁbre over a point (a1, . . . , an) is the set of roots of the polynomial
Xn −a1Xn−1 + · · · + (−1)nan.
The discriminant of Xn −T1Xn−1 + · · · + (−1)nTn, regarded as a polynomial in X, is a
polynomial D(f) ∈C[T1, . . . , Tn]. Let ∆be the zero set of D(f) in Cn. Then over each
point of Cn \ ∆, there are exactly n points of S, and S \ π−1(∆) is a covering space over
Cn \ ∆with group of covering transformations Sn.
A brief history. As far back as 1500 BC, the Babylonians (at least) knew a general formula
for the roots of a quadratic polynomial. Cardan (about 1515 AD) found a general formula
for the roots of a cubic polynomial. Ferrari (about 1545 AD) found a general formula for the
roots of quartic polynomial (he introduced the resolvant cubic, and used Cardan’s result).
Over the next 275 years there were many fruitless attempts to obtain similar formulas for
higher degree polynomials, until, in about 1820, Ruﬃni and Abel proved that there are none.
5.9. Norms and traces.
The trace of a square matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements, Tr(aij) = 
i aii. Since
Tr(UAU−1) = Tr(A), we can deﬁne the trace of an endomorphism α of a ﬁnite-dimensional
vector space V to be the trace of the matrix of α with respect to any basis of V .
Similarly, we can deﬁne the determinant and characteristic
polynomial of α to be the
determinant and characteristic polynomial of the matrix of α with respect to any basis of V .
In a little more detail, a direct computation shows that Tr(AB) = Tr(BA), which shows
that Tr(UAU−1) = Tr(A) and hence Tr(α) is well-deﬁned. The characteristic polynomial of
α can be deﬁned to be
cα(X) = Xn + c1Xn−1 + · · · + cn,
ci = (−1)i Tr(α|ΛiV ),
n = dim V ;
in particular, c1 = −Tr(A) and cn = (−1)n det A. If A is the matrix of α with respect to
some basis for V , then cα(X) = det(XIn −A).
For α and β endomorphisms of a ﬁnite-dimensional F-vector space V , we have
Tr(α) ∈F;
Tr(α + β)
= Tr(α) + Tr(β);
det(α) ∈F;
det(αβ)
= det(α) det(β).
Now let E be a ﬁnite extension of F of degree n, and regard E as an F-vector space. Then
α ∈E deﬁnes an F-linear map αL : E →E, x 
→αx.
Deﬁne:
TrE/F(α)
= Tr(αL);
Tr is a homomorphism (E, +) →(F, +);
NmE/F(α)
= det(αL);
Nm is homomorphism (E×, ×) →(F ×, ×);
cα(X)
= cαL(X).

50
J.S. MILNE
Note that α 
→αL is an injective ring F-homomorphism from E into the ring of endomor-
phisms of E as a vector space over F, and so the minimum polynomial of α (in the sense of
Section 1.8) is the same as the minimum polynomial of αL (in the sense of linear algebra).
Example 5.32. (a) Consider the ﬁeld extension C ⊃R; the matrix of αL, α = a + bi,
relative to the basis 1, i is

a
−b
b
a

, and so
TrC/R(α) = 2ℜ(α),
NmC/R(α) = |α|2.
(b) For α ∈F, Tr(α) = rα, Nm(α) = αr, r = [E : F].
(c) Let E = Q[α, i] be the splitting ﬁeld of X8 −2. What are the norm and the trace of
α? The deﬁnition requires us to compute a 16 × 16 matrix. We shall see a quicker way of
computing them presently.
Proposition 5.33. Consider a ﬁnite ﬁeld extension E/F, and let f(X) be the minimum
polynomial of α ∈E (in the sense of Section 1.8). Then
cα(X) = f(X)[E:F[α]].
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that E = F[α]. In this case, we have to show that cα(X) = f(X).
But f(X)|cα(X) because cα(αL) = 0 (Cayley-Hamilton theorem), and the injectivity of
E →EndF-linear(E) then implies that cα(α) = 0. Since the polynomials are monic of the
same degree, they must be equal.
For the general case, write V for E regarded as an F-vector space. The endomorphism
αL of V deﬁnes an action of F[X] on V (see Math 593), and this action factors through
F[X]/(f(X)) = F[α]. Because F[α] is a ﬁeld, V is a free F[α]-module, and in fact, V ≈
F[α]m with m = [E : F[α]] (count dimensions over F). Hence the characteristic polynomial
of α acting on V is the mth power of its characteristic polynomial acting on F[α], which,
according to case already proved, is f(X).
Alternatively, we can be more explicit. Let β1, ..., βn be a basis for F[α] over F, and let
γ1, ..., γm be a basis for E over F[α]. As we saw in the proof of (1.10), {βiγk} is a basis
for E over F. Write αβi =  ajiβj; then A = (aij) has characteristic polynomial f(X)
according to the ﬁrst case proved. Note that αβiγk = ajiβjγk. Therefore the matrix of
αL in End(E) breaks up into n × n blocks with A’s down the diagonal and zero matrices
elsewhere. Therefore its characteristic polynomial is f(X)m.
Corollary 5.34. Suppose that the roots of the minimum polynomial of α are α1, . . . , αn
(in some splitting ﬁeld containing E), and that [E : F[α]] = m. Then
Tr(α) = m

Example 5.35. (a) Consider the extension C ⊃R. If α ∈C \ R, then
cα(X) = f(X) = X2 −2ℜ(α)X + |α|2.
If α ∈R, then cα(X) = (X −a)2.
(b) Let E = Q[α, i] be the splitting ﬁeld of X8 −2 (see Exercise 16). The minimum
polynomial of α =
8√
2 is X8 −2, and so
TrQ[α]/Q α
= 0;
TrE/Q α = 0.
NmQ[α]/Q α
= −2;
NmE/Q α = 4.
Remark 5.36. Assume E is separable over F, and let Ωbe an algebraic closure of F; let
σ1, ..., σr be the distinct embeddings of E into Ω. Then
TrE/F α
=

σiα
NmE/F α
=

σiα.
When E = F[α], this follows from the observation (cf. 2.1b) that the σiα are the roots of
the minimum polynomial f(X) of α over F. In the general case, σ1α, ..., σrα are still roots
of f(X) in Ω, but now each root of f(X) occurs [E : F[α]] times (cf. the proof of 2.7).
For example, if E is Galois over F with Galois group G, then

NmE/M ◦NmM/F
=
NmE/F .
Proof. If E is separable over F, then this can be proved fairly easily using the descriptions
in the above remark. We omit the proof in the general case.
Proposition 5.38. Let f(X) ∈F[X] factor as f(X) = m
i=1(X −αi) in some splitting
ﬁeld, and let α = α1. Then, with f′ =
df

disc f(X) = (−1)m(m−1)/2 NmF[α]/F f′(α).

Example 5.39. We compute the discriminant of
f(X) = Xn + aX + b,
a, b ∈F,
assumed to be irreducible and separable. Let α be a root of f(X), and let γ = f′(α) =
nαn−1 + a. We compute its norm. On multiplying the equation
αn + aα + b = 0
by nα−1 and rearranging, we obtain the equation
nαn−1 = −na −nbα−1.
Hence
γ = nαn−1 + a = −(n −1)a −nbα−1.
Solving for α gives
α =
−nb
γ + (n −1)a,
from which it is clear that F[α] = F[γ], and so the minimum polynomial of γ over F has
degree n also. If we write
f(
−nb
X + (n −1)a) = P(X)
Q(X),
then P(γ) = f(α) = 0. Since
P(X) = (X + (n −1)a)n −na(X + (n −1)a)n−1 + (−1)nnnbn−1
is monic of degree n, it must be the minimum polynomial of γ. Therefore Nm γ is (−1)n
times the constant term of this polynomial, and so we ﬁnd that
Nmγ = nnbn−1 + (−1)n−1(n −1)n−1an.
Finally we obtain the formula,
disc(Xn + aX + b) = (−1)n(n−1)/2(nnbn−1 + (−1)n−1(n −1)n−1an),
which is something Maple doesn’t know (because it doesn’t understand symbols as expo-
nents). For example,
disc(X5 + aX + b) = 55b4 + 44a5.
5.10. Inﬁnite Galois extensions (sketch).
Recall that we deﬁned a ﬁnite extension Ωof F to be Galois over F if it is normal and
separable, i.e., if every irreducible polynomial f ∈F[X] having a root in Ωhas deg f distinct
roots in Ω. Similarly, we deﬁne an algebraic extension Ωof F to be Galois over F if it is
normal and separable. Equivalently, a ﬁeld Ω⊃F is Galois over F if it is a union of subﬁelds
E ﬁnite and Galois over F.
Let Gal(Ω/F) = Aut(Ω/F), and consider the map
σ 
→(σ|E) : Gal(Ω/F) →

Gal(E/F)
(product over the ﬁnite Galois extensions E of F contained in Ω). This map is injective,
because Ωis a union of ﬁnite Galois extensions. We give each ﬁnite group Gal(E/F) the
discrete topology and  Gal(E/F) the product topology, and we give Gal(Ω/F) the subspace
topology.
Thus the subgroups Gal(Ω/E), [E : F] < ∞, form a fundamental system of
neighbourhoods of 1 in Gal(Ω/F).

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
53
By the Tychonoﬀtheorem,  Gal(E/F) is compact, and it is easy to see that the image
of Gal(Ω/F) is closed—hence it is compact and Hausdorﬀ.
Theorem 5.40. Let Ωbe Galois over F with Galois group G. The maps
H 
→ΩH,
M 
→Gal(Ω/M)
deﬁne a one-to-one correspondence between the closed subgroups of G and the intermediate
ﬁelds M. A ﬁeld M is of ﬁnite degree over F if and only if Gal(Ω/M) is open in Gal(Ω/F).
Proof. Omit—it is not diﬃcult given the ﬁnite case. See for example, E. Artin, Algebraic
Numbers and Algebraic Functions, p103.
Remark 5.41. The remaining assertions in the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory
carry over to the inﬁnite case provided that one requires the subgroups to be closed.
Example 5.42. Let Ωbe an algebraic closure of a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fp. Then G = Gal(Ω/Fp)
contains a canonical Frobenius element, σ = (a 
→ap), and it is generated by it as a
topological group, i.e., G is the closure of <σ>. Endow Z with the topology for which the
groups nZ, n ≥1, form a fundamental system of neighbourhoods of 0. Thus two integers
are close if their diﬀerence is divisible by a large integer.
As for any topological group, we can complete Z for this topology. A Cauchy seqence in
Z is a sequence (ai)i≥1, ai ∈Z, satisfying the following condition: for all n ≥1, there exists
an N such that ai ≡aj mod n for i, j > N. Call a Cauchy sequence in Z trivial if ai →0
as i →∞, i.e., if for all n ≥1, there exists an N such that ai ≡0 mod n. The Cauchy
sequences form a commutative group, and the trivial Cauchy sequences form a subgroup. We
can deﬁne Z to be the quotient of the ﬁrst group by the second. It has a ring structure, and
the map sending m ∈Z to the constant sequence m, m, m, . . . identiﬁes Z with a subgroup
of Z.
Let α ∈Z be represented by the Cauchy sequence (ai). The restriction of σ to Fpn has
order n. Therefore (σ|Fpn)ai is independent of i provided it is suﬃciently large, and we can
deﬁne σα ∈Gal(Ω/Fp) to be such that, for each n, σα|Fpn = (σ|Fpn)ai for all i suﬃciently
large (depending on n). The map α 
→σα : Z →Gal(Ω/Fp) is an isomorphism.
The group Z is uncountable. To most analysts, it is a little weird—its connected com-
ponents are one-point sets. To number theorists it will seem quite natural— the Chinese
remainder theorem implies that it is isomorphic to 
p prime Zp where Zp is the ring of p-adic
integers.
Example 5.43. Let Ωbe the algebraic closure of Q in C; then Gal(Ω/Q) is one of the
most basic, and intractible, objects in mathematics. Note that, as far as we know, it could
have every ﬁnite group as a quotient, and it certainly has Sn as a quotient group for every
n (and every sporadic simple group, and every...). We do however understand Gal(F ab/F)
when F ⊂C is a ﬁnite extension of Q and F ab is the union of all ﬁnite abelian extensions of
F contained in C. For example, Gal(Qab/Q) ≈Z×. (This is abelian class ﬁeld theory—see
Math 776.)

6. Transcendental Extensions
In this section we consider ﬁelds Ω⊃F with Ωmuch bigger than F. For example, we could
have C ⊃Q.
Elements α1, ..., αn of Ωare said to be algebraically dependent over F if there is a nonzero
polynomial f(X1, ..., Xn) ∈F[X1, ..., Xn] such that f(α1, ..., αn) = 0. Otherwise, the ele-
ments are said to be algebraically independent over F. Thus they are algebraically indepen-
dent if
ai1,...,in ∈F,

ai1,...,inαi1
1 ...αin
n = 0 =⇒ai1,...,in = 0 all i1, ..., in.
Note the similarity with linear independence. In fact, if f is required to be homogeneous
of degree 1, then the deﬁnition becomes that of linear independence. The theory in this
section is logically very similar to a part of linear algebra. It is useful to keep the following
correspondences in mind:
Linear algebra
Transcendence
linearly independent
algebraically independent
A ⊂span(B)
A algebraically dependent on B
basis
transcendence basis
dimension
transcendence degree
Example 6.1. (a) A single element α is algebraically independent over F if and only if
it is transcendental over F.
(b) The complex numbers π and e are almost certainly algebraically independent over Q,
but this has not been proved.
An inﬁnite set A is algebraically independent if every ﬁnite subset of A is algebraically
independent.
Remark 6.2. To say that α1, ..., αn are algebraically independent over F, is the same as
to say that the map
f(X1, ..., Xn) 
→f(α1, ..., αn) : F[X1, ..., Xn] →F[α1, ..., αn]
is an injection, and hence an isomorphism. This isomorphism then extends to the ﬁelds of
fractions,
Xi 
→αi : F(X1, ..., Xn) →F(α1, ..., αn)
In this case, F(α1, ..., αn) is called a pure transcendental extension of F. Then (see 5.28)
the polynomial
f(X) = Xn −α1Xn−1 + . . .(−1)nαn
has Galois group Sn over F(α1, ..., αn).
Let β ∈Ωand let A ⊂Ω. The following conditions are equivalent:
(a) β is algebraic over F(A);
(b) there exist α1, . . . , αn ∈F(A) such that βn + α1βn−1 + · · · + αn = 0;
(c) there exist α0, . . . , αn ∈F[A] such that α0βn + · · · + αn = 0;
(d) there exists an f(X1, . . . , Xm, Y ) ∈F[X1 . . . , Xm, Y ] and a1, . . . , am ∈F such that
f(a1, . . . , am, Y ) ̸= 0 but f(a1, . . . , am, β) = 0.
When these conditions hold, we say that β is algebraically dependent on A (over F). A set
B is algebraically dependent on A if each element of B is algebraically dependent on A.

Theorem 6.3 (Fundamental result). Let A = {α1, ..., αm} and B = {β1, ..., βn} be two
subsets of Ω. Assume
(a) A is algebraically independent (over F);
(b) A is algebraically dependent on B (over F).
Then m ≤n.
Proof. We ﬁrst prove a lemma.
Lemma 6.4 (The exchange property). Let {α1, ..., αn} be a subset of Ω; if β is alge-
braically dependent on {α1, ..., αm} but not on {α1, ..., αm−1}, then αm is algebraically depen-
dent on {α1, ..., αm−1, β}.
Proof. Because β is algebraically dependent on {α1, . . . , αm}, there exists a polynomial
f(X1, ..., Xm, Y ) with coeﬃcients in F such that
f(α1, ..., αm, Y ) ̸= 0,
f(α1, ..., αm, β) = 0.
Write
f(X1, ..., Xm, Y ) =

i
ai(X1, ..., Xm−1, Y )Xi
m
and observe that, because f(α1, . . . , αm, Y )
̸=
0, at least one of the polynomials
ai(α1, ..., αm−1, Y ), say ai0, is not the zero polynomial. Because β is not algebraically depen-
dent on {α1, ..., αm−1}, ai0(α1, ..., αm−1, β) ̸= 0. Therefore, f(α1, ..., αm−1, Xm, β) is not the
zero polynomial. Since f(α1, ..., αm, β) = 0, this shows that αm is algebraically dependent
on {α1, ..., αm−1, β}.
Lemma 6.5 (Transitivity of algebraic dependence). If C is algebraically dependent on B,
and B is algebraically dependent on A, then C is algebraically dependent on A.
Proof. The argument in the proof (2.10) shows that if γ is algebraic over a ﬁeld E which
is algebraic over a ﬁeld F, then γ is algebraic over F (if a1, . . . , an are the coeﬃcients of the
minimum polynomial of γ over E, then the ﬁeld F[a1, . . . , an, γ] has ﬁnite degree over F).
Apply this with F(A ∪B) for E and F(A) for F.
Proof. (of the theorem). We now prove the theorem. Let k be the number of elements
that A and B have in common. If k = m, then A ⊂B, and certainly m ≤n. Suppose that
k < m, and write B = {α1, ..., αk, βk+1, ..., βn}. Since αk+1 is algebraically dependent on
{α1, ..., αk, βk+1, ..., βn} but not on {α1, ..., αk}, there will be a βj, k + 1 ≤j ≤n, such that
αk+1 is algebraically dependent on {α1, ..., αk, βk+1, ..., βj} but not {α1, ..., αk, βk+1, ..., βj−1}.
The exchange lemma then shows that βj is algebraically dependent on
B1 =df B ∪{αk+1} −{βj}.
Therefore B is algebraically dependent on B1, and so A is algebraically dependent on B1
(by the last lemma). If k + 1 < m, repeat the argument with A and B1. Eventually we’ll
achieve k = m, and m ≤n.
Definition 6.6. A transcendence basis for Ωover F is an algebraically independent set
A such that Ωis algebraic over F(A).
Lemma 6.7. If Ωis algebraic over F(A), and A is minimal among subsets of Ωwith this
property, then it is a transcendence basis for Ωover F.

Proof. If α1, . . . , αm ∈A are not algebraically independent, then one is algebraically
dependent on the remainder, and it follows from (6.5) that Ωwill still be algebraic over
F(A) after it has been dropped from A.
Theorem 6.8. If there is a ﬁnite subset A ⊂Ωsuch that Ωis algebraic over F(A), then
Ωhas a ﬁnite transcendence basis over F. Moreover, every transcendence basis is ﬁnite, and
they all have the same number of elements.
Proof. In fact, any minimal subset A′ of A such that Ωis algebraic over F(A′) will be a
transcendence basis. The second statement follows from Theorem 6.3.
The cardinality of a transcendence basis for Ωover F is called the transcendence degree of
Ωover F. For example, the pure transcendental extension F(X1, . . . , Xn) has transcendence
degree n over F.
Example 6.9. Let p1, . . . , pn be the elementary symmetric polynomials in X1, . . . , Xn.
The ﬁeld F(X1, . . . , Xn) is algebraic over F(p1, . . . , pn), and so {p1, p2, . . . , pn} contains a
transcendence basis for F(X1, . . . , Xn). Because F(X1, . . . , Xn) has transcendence degree
n, the pi’s must themselves be a transcendence basis.
Example 6.10. Let Ωbe the ﬁeld of meromorphic functions on a compact complex man-
ifold M.
(a) The only meromorphic functions on the Riemann sphere are the rational functions in
z. Hence, in this case, Ωis a pure transcendental extension of C of transcendence degree 1.
(b) If M is a Riemann surface, then the transcendence degree of Ωover C is 1, and Ωis
a pure transcendental extension of C ⇐⇒M is isomorphic to the Riemann sphere
(c) If M has complex dimension n, then the transcendence degree is ≤n, with equality
holding if M is embeddable in some projective space.
Lemma 6.11. Suppose that A is algebraically independent, but that A∪{β} is algebraically
dependent. Then β is algebraic over F(A).
Proof. The hypothesis is that there exists a nonzero polynomial f(X1, ..., Xn, Y ) ∈
F[X1, ..., Xn, Y ] such that f(a1, ..., an, β) = 0, some distinct a1, ..., an ∈A. Because A is
algebraically independent, Y does occur in f. Therefore
f = g0Y m + g1Y m−1 + · · · + gm,
gi ∈F[X1, ..., Xn],
g0 ̸= 0,
m ≥1.
As g0 ̸= 0 and the ai are algebraically independent, g0(a1, ..., an) ̸= 0. Because β is a root of
f = g0(a1, ..., an)Xm + g1(a1, ..., an)Xm−1 + · · · + gm(a1, ..., an),
it is algebraic over F(a1, ..., an) ⊂F(A).
Proposition 6.12. Every maximal algebraically independent subset of Ωis a transcen-
dence basis for Ωover F.
Proof. We have to prove that Ωis algebraic over F(A) if A is maximal among alge-
braically independent subsets. But the maximality implies that, for every β ∈Ω, A ∪{β} is
algebraically dependent, and so the lemma shows that β is algebraic over F(A).
Theorem 6.13 (*). Every ﬁeld Ωcontaining F has a transcendence basis over F.

FIELDS AND GALOIS THEORY
57
Proof. Let S be the set of algebraically independent subsets of Ω. We can partially order
it by inclusion. Let T be a totally ordered subset, and let B = ∪{A | A ∈T}. I claim that
B ∈S, i.e., that B is algebraically independent. If not, there exists a ﬁnite subset B′ of
B that is not algebraically independent. But such a subset will be contained in one of the
sets in T, which is a contradiction. Now we can apply Zorn’s lemma to obtain a maximal
algebraically independent subset A.
It is possible to show that any two (possibly inﬁnite) transcendence bases for Ωover F
have the same cardinality.
Proposition 6.14.
Any two algebraically closed ﬁelds with the same transcendence de-
gree over F are F-isomorphic.
Proof. Choose transcendence bases A and A′ for the two ﬁelds, and choose a bijection
ϕ : A →A′. Then ϕ extends uniquely to an F-isomorphism ϕ : F[A] →F[A′], and hence to
an isomorphism of the ﬁelds of fractions F(A) →F(A′). Use this isomorphism to identify
F(A) with F(A′). Then the two ﬁelds in question are algebraic closures of the same ﬁeld,
and hence are isomorphic (Theorem 2.16).
Remark 6.15. Any two algebraically closed ﬁelds with the same uncountable cardinality
and the same characteristic are isomorphic. The idea of the proof is as follows. Let F and
F ′ be the prime subﬁelds of Ωand Ω′; we can identify F with F ′. Then show that when Ω
is uncountable, the cardinality of Ωis the same as the cardinality of a transcendence basis
over F. Finally, apply the proposition.
Remark 6.16. What are the automorphisms of C? If we assume the axiom of choice,
then it is easy to construct many: choose any transcendence basis A for C over Q, and
choose any permutation α of A; then α deﬁnes an isomorphism Q(A) →Q(A) that can be
extended to an automorphism of C. On the other hand, without the axiom of choice, there
are probably only two, the identity map and complex conjugation. (I have been told that
any other is nonmeasurable, and it is known that the axiom of choice is required to construct
nonmeasurable functions.)
Theorem 6.17 (L¨uroth’s theorem). Any subﬁeld E of F(X) containing F but not equal
to F is a pure transcendental extension of F.
Proof. See, Jacobson, Lectures in Abstract Algebra III, p157.
Remark 6.18. This fails when there is more than one variable—see the footnote on p38
and Noether’s conjecture 5.30. The best that is true is that if [F(X, Y ) : E] < ∞and F
is algebraically closed of characteristic zero, then E is a pure transcendental extension of F
(Theorem of Zariski, 1958).
