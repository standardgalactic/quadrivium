Intentionality and information
processing: An alternative model
for cognitive science

Abstract: This article responds to two unresolved and crucial problems of cognitive science: (1) What is actually accomplished by
functions of the nervous system that we ordinarily describe in the intentional idiom? and (2) What makes the information processing
involved in these functions semantic? It is argued that, contrary to the assumptions of many cognitive theorists, the computational
approach does not provide coherent answers to these problems, and that a more promising start would be to fall back on mathematical
communication theory and, with the help of evolutionary biology and neurophysiology, to attempt a characterization of the adaptive
processes involved in visual perception. Visual representations are explained as patterns of cortical activity that are enabled to focus
on objects in the changing visual environment by constantly adjusting to maintain levels of mutual information between pattern and
object that are adequate for continuing perceptual control. In these terms, the answer proposed to (1) is that the intentional functions
of vision are those involved in the establishment and maintenance of such representations, and to (2) that semantic features are added
to the information processes of vision with the focus on objects that these representations accomplish. The article concludes with
proposals for extending this account of intentionality to the higher domains of conceptualization and reason, and with speculation
about how semantic information-processing might be achieved in mechanical systems.

1. The need for a theory of intentionality
In his comment on the BBS target article by Dennett
(1983), Bennett (1983) takes its author to task for failing to
explain what intentionality is, and thereby failing to
provide a theoretical basis for adopting the intentional
stance in ethology and psychology. What is needed,
Bennett urges, is an account of intentionality as a feature
of "one kind of function from sensory inputs to behavioral
outputs" - that is, a "description of what these functions
are, of how they actually work" (p. 357).
Another key perspective on the type of theory needed
is provided by the target article itself. As Dennett points
out quite candidly (p. 344), the "decision to conduct one's
science in terms of beliefs, desires, and other 'mentalistic'
notions" is not usual in science. It involves a risk. "It
banks on the soundness of some as yet imperfectly de-
scribed concept of information . . . the concept of what is
often called semantic information" (author's emphasis).
The concept of semantic information is not that of Shan-
non and Weaver, (1949), but rather is what is "recounted
in ordinary talk in terms of beliefs and desires and the
other states and acts philosophers call intentional" (au-
thor's emphasis). The contents (Dennett's term again) of
the mental states cited in the intentional idiom can be
spoken of in terms of the semantic information they
represent; and what imparts informational content to a
representation is its being directed upon a particular
object or state of affairs - that is, its intentional character.
So another requirement of the account of intentionality
needed by cognitive science is that the account provide a
precise description of what it is that makes semantic
information semantic - what it is that lends content to the
internal representations involved in cognitive activity.
First, what do the functions of the nervous system that
we ordinarily describe in the intentional idiom actually
do? What do they accomplish? How do they work? And
second, what exactly is it about the information involved
in these functions that makes it semantic? These two are
among the most pressing questions a scientific account of
intentionality should be equipped to answer. Yet, as
Bennett, Dennett, and various others have seen, they are
questions to which cognitive science (CS) at present has
no clear answers. Although the notion of semantic infor-
mation, and the notion of intentionality standing behind
it, are wholly indispensable to CS, its theorists have yet to
produce an account of these features that explains their
presence in cognitive organisms.
The primary purpose of this essay is to lay out the
rudiments of an account of intentionality that shows
promise of providing intelligible answers to these two
questions, and to illustrate how these answers would go
within a limited range of cognitive activity. Caveats are in
order to prevent an already ambitious goal from further
inflation. There is no completely worked out general
theory of intentionality waiting in the wings to be pre-

Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
sented in capsule form, and no detailed answers to the
questions above that are ready to be put forward in more
than tentative fashion. What is said in this target article is
ready for discussion, but surely not ready for the scientific
archives.
Another important caveat is that this essay deals with
intentionality primarily within the domain of visual per-
ception and will not have much to say by way of extending
the account to more complex forms of cognitive activity.
The justification for this narrow focus, beyond obvious
considerations of space, is (1) that visual perception also
has been the main focus of other authors (notably Gibson,
1979, and Marr, 1982) with whom comparisons naturally
will arise, and (2) that from my perspective the inten-
tionality of perception is both prior to and constituent of
the intentionality of the "higher" activities of language
and reason, and that first things should be taken first.
Nonetheless, a complete theory of intentionality would
presumably have a great deal to say about the relations
between perception and more complex forms of cogni-
tion. A very brief sketch of how these relations look from
my perspective is provided in the final sections of this
essay.
2. The "official" stance of cognitive science
What CS needs, it has been urged, is an account of
intentionality that explains (1) what it is that the input-
output functions producing intentionally described ac-
tivity actually do, and (2) what it is about the information
involved in these functions that lends semantic content to
our mental representations. But it might be objected that
CS has the answers to these questions already at hand, in
the form of what Fodor (1980) calls "the basic idea of
modern cognitive theory" (p. 68, author's emphasis). In
barest outline, the "basic idea" is to conceive the brain as
a computing device that accomplishes major cognitive
tasks as the accumulated effect of many subtasks, all
intentional features of which are paired with physical
constraints of the computing mechanisms.
The "official" view behind this idea, equally con-
densed, is that propositional attitudes (perceptions, be-
liefs, decisions, etc.) are relationships between the over-
all physical organism and certain of its internal states, that
these internal states are representations that provide the
content of the attitudes in question, and further that one
propositional attitude can function as the cause of another
(as perceiving that the book is on the table can result in
believing the same) in the manner in which one computer
state can cause another. This means, first, that the com-
plex representations through which the system interacts
with its environment must be broken down into simple
representations with which the system is equipped to
deal computationally and, second, that the causal pro-
cesses through which these canonical representations
interact are just the physical procedures of computation.
Accordingly, the way to understand how the human
organism functions in a given cognitive task is to analyze
that task under its intentional description, and to proceed
to a level of analysis at which the intentionally specified
subtasks can be performed by computations on canonical
representations. Under their intentional description
these representations have cognitive content; and under
their computational (physical) description they are capa-
ble of causal interaction.
The question to which this view obviously leads is,
what reason do we have for thinking that there is a level in
the analysis of a cognitive task at which intentional and
computational descriptions come together in this fashion?
Like the 17th-century metaphysician Malebranche, cog-
nitive scientists view the intentional (the "mental") and
the computational (the "physical") as held together by a
principle of overarching correspondence. Without rely-
ing on Malebranche's notion of Divine Contrivance, what
reason do we have, in the interests of science, to think
that such correspondence is a real possibility? The "offi-
cial" answer, simply, is that we have actual computer
systems that illustrate the principle. The "basic idea" is
that the human brain is just another example of a comput-
ing system that "pairs physical states of the device with
formulae in a computing language in such a fashion as to
preserve desired semantic relations among the formulae"
(Fodor 1975, p. 73).
But what computer systems are supposed to illustrate
this principle? Not those guiding aircraft, or running
heating systems, or assembling parts on a production
line. Although systems of this sort ("number crunchers")
may be as complex as you like, they have no truck with
semantic content (i.e., technical explanations of how they
function assign no essential role to computations on
semantically laden representations). The all-time favorite
examples of computing systems that do invite intentional
description are chess players and theorem provers. Of
these two, the logical theorem prover is most compelling,
for it seems actually to require an intentional description.
Since logical inference is by definition truth-preserving,
and since truth is a paradigmatic property of intentional
expressions, systems that prove logical theorems by com-
putational procedures are proof also of the possibility of
the needed correspondence. (Some readers may not be
content with theorem provers as an illustrative case,
feeling that such systems are old hat in artificial intel-
ligence [AI] research. According to other viewpoints
within AI, however, topics of automatic deduction have
remained central up to the present and are currently
enjoying a renaissance [Barr and Feigenbaum 1981, p.
228; Cohen and Feigenbaum 1982, pp. 77-79]. In view of
the fact that theorem-proving mechanisms seem almost
to beg for intentional description, choice of this illustra-
tion should not call for apology.)
So, to return to the query at the beginning of this
section, do we not already have a theory of intentionality
that explains what has to be explained about the mind's
dealing with representations and semantic information?
The functions from sensory input to behavioral output of
which Bennett speaks, although varying in particulars
from case to case, fall generally under the category of
computational operations and can be studied by studying
analogous operations in computer simulations. They
work the way other computational operations work. As to
the second question of where the semantic information
involved in these operations comes from, the answer is
that it derives from the functional relationship between
internal representations and the things that they sym-
bolize (Fodor 1981a, p. 123), a relationship secured by
the principle of correspondence between semantical and
physical properties.

3. Criticism of the "official" stance
There has been a good deal of criticism of the cognitive
program since it began to receive coherent articulation in
the early 1970s (with Fodor, 1975, as a sort of watershed
between pre- and postarticulate periods), matched by
elaborate defenses by its major theoreticians (including
articles by Fodor, 1980; Pylyshyn, 1980a, 1980b; and
Dennett, 1983, in recent issues of BBS). Although the
evidence is far from complete, it seems fair to say on
balance that there are both deep insights that will be
preserved as CS matures and deep problems to be
worked out in the process of maturing. One of the deepest
problems, I believe, lies with the notion of semantic
information-processing upon which the computational
model of cognition is based. To see this, in effect, is to see
why Bennett is right in claiming that CS still needs a
coherent account of how intentionally described func-
tions "actually work," and why Dennett is right in observ-
ing that the concept of information involved in these
functions has yet to be precisely described.
The heart of the problem is that computers do not
operate on symbols with semantic content. Not even
computers programmed to prove logical theorems do so.
Hence pointing to symbolic operations performed by
digital computers is no help in understanding how minds
can operate on meaning-laden symbols, or can perform
any sort of semantic information-processing whatever.
But what is the problem with theorem provers?
What a theorem prover does, put very roughly, is to
start with axioms which it breaks up into canonical nota-
tion and, following various heuristic procedures, to gen-
erate theorems from the axioms by prescribed rules of
inference. Put somewhat less roughly, representations of
instructions in the programmer's language are translated
via compiler and interpreter into machine-language in-
structions, which govern the internal workings of the
machine in such a fashion that machine states correspond-
ing to representations of logical axioms at the input
generate other machine states in sequence, leading
eventually to states producing formulae at the putput that
are interpretable as representing theorems according to
the conventions of the programmer's language. If the
programmer, the compiler, the machine-language in-
structions, and so forth, all do their jobs properly, the
formulae at the output are properly interpreted as true in
just the same circumstances and under the same in-
terpretive conventions as those under which the input
axioms are so interpreted. When this happens, we say the
program has proven the output formulae, in the sense of
showing that they follow logically from the axioms at the
input. The catch to all this is that none of the representa-
tions internal to the machine has meaning, or truth, or
external reference, just in and by itself. Whatever mean-
ing, truth, or reference they have is derivative (the term
is borrowed from Haugeland, 1981, p. 32), tracing back to
interpretations imposed by the programmers and users of
the system.
There is a sense, to be sure, in which rules of inference
built into the program are "truth preserving," but it is no
different from the sense in which equivalent rules would
"preserve truth" when applied by human logicians to
symbols on paper or blackboard. As long as the person
applying the rules holds to the same interpretive conven-
Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
tions(e.g., those of Polish notation), the evaluation "true"
will be warranted for formulae at the end of the properly
applied inference procedure if that evaluation is war-
ranted for formulae at the beginning. As far as the
uninterpreted formulae themselves are concerned, how-
ever, no truth evaluation is warranted whatever, because
uninterpreted formulae bear no semantical relation to the
world at large. In like fashion, the sense in which a
computer can be programmed to prove logical theorems,
and in the process to "preserve the truth of its represen-
tations," is a sense in which various symbolic repre-
sentations go through various stages of transformation
carefully controlled to permit the same semantic in-
terpretations at input and output. Of intrinsic intentional
properties, however, these representations are entirely
innocent.
This predicament of the theorem prover admits gener-
alization. There is no purely formal system - automated
or otherwise - that is endowed with semantic features
independent of interpretation. Such is the case even with
symbols in a natural language. There is nothing about the
symbolic structure of the term "cat" (type or token, oral
or written), for instance, that establishes reference to
feline animals. Inasmuch as the English word "cat" refers
to cats, the word consists of more than can be uttered or
written on paper. It consists of the symbolic form CAT
(which can be instantiated in many ways in speech and
writing) plus interpretive conventions by which instances
of that form are to be taken as referring to cats. Similarly,
the symbolic form GO means the opposite of STOP (or
COME, etc.) by appropriate interpretive conventions of
English, while by those of Japanese it means a board
game played with black and white stones. But without
interpretive conventions it means nothing at all. Such is
the case with formal symbols generally, including the
formulae involved in machine computation. And since
interpretive conventions are rules applied by the users of
the symbol system, it follows that formulae involved in
computation â whatever their character as formal sym-
bols - have reference only derivatively from user in-
terpretation. In terms of the useful distinction of Searle
(1980a), the intentionality attaching to machine represen-
tations is not "intrinsic" but "observer-relative," being
entirely dependent upon the "intrinsic" intentions of the
programmer or user.
This seems manifestly at odds with certain lines of
current AI theory, particularly in those areas overlapping
with CS. Accordingly, it is relevant to indicate briefly
why recent work in AI provides no exceptions to the
general remarks above. AI is often depicted as having
originated with the realization that digital computers
(unlike desk calculators) are not limited to the processing
of numerical data, but are also capable of symbol process-
ing (Barr and Feigenbaum 1981, p. 4). This means,
roughly, that computers can be programmed so that
operations on their internal states have the effect of
working out implications and ramifications of symbol
structures presented at their inputs. Broadly perceived,
the major emphasis in AI over the past dozen or so years
has been an attempt to devise formats for the representa-
tion of nonnumerical data, and procedures for the pro-
cessing of such representations, that will enable machines
to operate with symbol systems in a manner approximat-
ing that of human cognition. Perhaps the two most influ-
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
ential approaches to that goal have been those of pro-
cedural representations and of semantic networks.
The key idea behind procedural representation is that
semantic features of natural language can be represented
in the machine by procedures in the form of micro-
programs. The function of these procedures is to compute
relationships among input symbols corresponding to se-
mantic relationships in natural language. A paradigm
example of this approach is Winograd's SHRDLU
(Winograd 1972), which accepts commands and answers
questions about a simulated "microworld" consisting of
blocks and a robot manipulator. Among other compo-
nents, the SHRDLU program incorporates a syntactic
parser for decoding input sentences in natural language,
and a semantic analyzer for converting input information
into commands for the robot and queries to the data base.
Semantic analysis is based on "definations" of linguistic
structures, such as conjunctions and noun phrases, in the
form of LISP programs incorporating information about
implications and other meaning relationships. With the
help of such internal procedures, a human interlocutor is
able to direct the operations of the simulated robot, and to
monitor the results on a cathode-ray tube.
The function of the microprograms in a system of this
sort is to represent semantic relationships among words
and concepts in a natural language. But to represent a
semantic relationship is not thereby to possess semantic
features of the sort represented. Given that the term
"cat" refers to cats, and that microprogram C represents
"cat," it does not follow that C itself refers to cats. (A red
light on a dashboard may warn of [designate, refer to]
inadequate oil pressure, while a photocopy of the light
warns of nothing whatever.) Similarly, from the fact that
a microprogram represents a semantic relationship
among terms in a natural language (e.g., "bird" implying
"winged"), it does not follow that the microprogram
itself posseses that same semantic feature. This is not to
say that the microprograms of this sort are totally inno-
cent of meaning relationships. By contrivance of the
programmer, they are representations - and representa-
tion itself is a semantic feature. But they are representa-
tions only by programmer contrivance, which means
that they are "observer-relative" in Searle's sense above.
The microprogram represents what it represents by the
programmer's intentions, and this representation is not
intrinsic to the operation of the program. Presumably
SHRDLU would have been written differently if
Winograd had worked according to different intentions;
but once written, the operation of its microprograms is
indifferent to what they happen to represent.
A more prominent recent approach is that of semantic
networks, using a notation in which meanings are ex-
pressed by a configuration of nodes and links. Nodes
typically represent objects and situations, whereas links
stand for relationships between the things thus repre-
sented (see Winston, 1984, for an up-to-date discussion).
Connecting two nodes representing cats and animals with
a directional link representing class membership, for
example, can represent the fact that all cats are animals.
In so-called knowledge representation research in AI,
networks of this sort are useful as formats both for storing
information relevant to a given subject domain and for
tracing inferences to facts not directly entered in the data
base. A simple illustration of one available form of in-
ference is provided by a pair of networks representing the
facts that all cats are animals and that all animals are
mortal which, when associated by the common term
"animal," yield the conclusion that all cats are mortal.
With respect to AI applications, it is important to note
that meanings are assigned to nodes and links not solely
by interpretive conventions, but also by the nature of the
particular computational procedures that manipulate the
network structures (Barr and Feigenbaum 1981, pp. 157,
186â87). Due perhaps to this continued emphasis on
procedures, coupled with the fact that networks of this
sort stand behind other current approaches using frames
and scripts (pioneered by work reported in Minsky, 1975,
and Schank and Abelson, 1977), representation formats
provided by semantic networks find wide use in current
AI research.
But do semantic networks in themselves possess intrin-
sic content? No more than the procedural representations
examined above. To be sure, the network format allows
greater flexibility and greater detail in the articulation of
meaning relations. A node-link representation of the fact
that all cats are animals can be embellished by the
addition of a wide range of other relations - reflecting, for
example, the physical makeup of cats and their average
lifetimes - something not so easily accomplished by
procedural representations of a simpler variety. But no
amount of detail will convert a computerized version of a
node-and-link network into an "intrinsic" representation
of a particular meaning or meaning relationship. The
reason is that exactly the same network could represent
any number of alternative meanings. As Pylyshyn ob-
serves, insofar as the computer itself is viewed as a formal
symbol processor, "we have a great deal of latitude in
assigning semantic interpretations to states" (1980a, p.
443). As is the case with formalisms of the propositional
calculus, for purposes of manipulating symbols within the
system it makes no difference how the symbols are
interpreted. It is even irrelevant whether they are in-
terpreted at all.
From the fact that a computer program is intended (by
the programmer) to represent meanings, it does not
follow that the program has intentional features, any
more than it follows that the keys and levers of a type-
writer have intentional properties because they repre-
sent the typist's meanings as they are symbolized on
paper. To the extent that CS relies upon the model of a
symbol-processing system that "behaves in a certain way
because certain expressions represent certain things"
(Pylyshyn 1980a, p. 443, my emphasis), the representa-
tion schemes of AI are poorly suited to its purpose.
Observations of this sort are not new in the literature.
Searle (1980a), for example, draws upon similar consid-
erations as part of an ingenious (and much debated)
argument to show that agents (brains or computers) do
not acquire intentionality merely by instantiating the
right kind of program, thus disenfranchising the approach
of what he calls "strong AI." My point is similar, but with
a different consequence. My point is that computers, just
in and by themselves, no matter how programmed, do
not exhibit intentionality at all, and hence that the at-
tempt by CS to devise an explanation of the intentional
character of human mental activities by thinking of such
activities basically as computations on internal represen-
tations does not have so much as a "ghost of a chance" of
124
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

succeeding. Maybe computations of some sort are in-
volved in all or most mental activities; but this is of no
help in explaining the nature of the intentionality those
activities exhibit.
Can CS be rescued from this impasse? I believe a way
has been indicated by Pylyshyn himself. This way has to
do with environmental constraints upon representational
procedures, and hence upon the meanings these pro-
cedures can represent. As far as computer intentionality
is concerned, Pylyshyn suggests that "if we equip the
machine with transducers and allow it to interact freely
with both natural and linguistic environments" (1980a, p.
443), then representations may be set up in its internal
circuitry that do not depend upon user interpretation.
But CS is (or should be) primarily concerned with human
intentionality. And since human organisms already are
equipped with transducers of the sort required, there is
reason to expect that environmental interaction has a
good deal to do with human intentionality as well. If it can
be shown that basic forms of human intentionality can be
understood in terms of environmental interactions, with-
out direct reference to computational procedures, then
CS may be relieved of its dependency upon AI modeling.
Since it is not the concern of this paper to advance the
cause of AI as such, little more will be said about comput-
er intentionality in the pages that follow. Suffice it to say
that if we can discover how intentionality operates in the
human organism, we will have a much better idea than
anyone has at present of how to build intentional features
into a computer system.
My concern is with the intentionality of human percep-
tion, and with how this intentionality depends upon
environmental constraints. Since perception seems natu-
rally to go together with phenomena of "problem solving,
language processing . . . and so on" (Pylyshyn 1980a, p.
443), there is reason to hope that what can be found out in
the domain of perception might eventually prove fruitful
in these other domains as well. But apart from some brief
remarks at the end of the paper, these other concerns will
be left for other occasions.
4. Resources for a theory
of information processing
In his earlier target article Pylyshyn observed that there
are "clear indications in the history of science . . . that
periods of progress are coincident with major new tech-
nical and conceptual developments or. . . with taking an
existing formalism seriously as a way of understanding the
world" (1978, p. 93). Stressing the "technical develop-
ments" angle, Pylyshyn argues that progress in computer
science within the past twenty years provides "reasons for
viewing the potential contribution of the computational
approach" to cognitive theory with optimism (p. 93),
although he adds at the end of the article that it remains to
be seen whether that optimism is warranted. Having
examined reasons why optimism is not warranted, with
respect to a computational theory of intentionality at
least, I propose to pick up on Pylyshyn's second alter-
native - that of "taking an existing formalism seriously."
Specifically, I wish to advocate the usefulness of the
mathematical theory of communication (MTC) for clarify-
ing the intentionality of certain cognitive activities.
There are antecedent reasons for expecting MTC to
Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
have significant application in the study of cognition. For
one, MTC is a general theory covering all forms of
communicational transactions, and some cognitive ac-
tivities are obviously communicational transactions (per-
ception and language at the very least). Another reason is
that cognitive activities involve informational inter-
changes of various sorts, and MTC is a formal theory of
informational interchanges. An immediate problem, of
course, is that information in the technical sense of MTC
(which I will label "info(t)") has no direct connection with
semantic information ("info(s)"). The info(s) behind the
intentional stance, as Dennett (1983) makes clear, serves
as the content of representations that are directed upon
objects. In a word, info(s) has intentional features. Info(t),
on the other hand, is a statistical concept, defined pre-
cisely as the inverse of the logarithm (to the base 2, when
measured in bits) of the probability of the event bearing
the information. Intuitively conceived, the info(t) of a
given event is the number of times the prior probability of
that event must be doubled to reach the 100% probability
it enjoys after occurrence. Info(t) is thus merely the
opposite of statistical uncertainty and is entirely devoid of
semantic features. A more or less standard way of sum-
marizing the difference between these two concepts
(e.g., Dennett 1983) is to say that info(t) measures the
capacity of communication channels, while info(s) con-
cerns the content of what is communicated.
Despite the uncertain connection between these two
concepts of information, there is a tradition of confidence
that MTC will ultimately prove applicable to the study of
semantic structures. With the first publication of Shan-
non's theory under a single cover (Shannon and Weaver
1949), in fact, there was appended a hopeful article by
Weaver suggesting that Shannon's "analysis has so pen-
etratingly cleared the air that one is now, perhaps for the
first time, ready for a real theory of meaning" (p. 116).
Soon after, MacKay (1950) appeared with a version of
"information theory" attempting to graft semantical fea-
tures onto MTC, which version was adopted without
further ado into the influential works by Broadbent (1958)
and Garner (1962). This may help account for the assump-
tion not uncommon among cognitive theorists that MTC
by itself constitutes a theory of info(s) processing (Gibson
1979, p. 238; see preface of Sayre, 1976, for other in-
stances), which certainly it does not.
Another way of telling the story is that of Cohen and
Feigenbaum, who identify the concept of information as
the key to the shift from behaviorism to cognitive psychol-
ogy, and then cheerfully describe a transition from the
precise sense of MTC to "a more relaxed, and more
appropriate, conception of information" (1982, p. 5) that
began to emerge by the 1960s. The same "relaxed" spirit
is reflected in the insistence of Garner that psychologists
can use informational concepts in any way that helps
them, and that if "going beyond or even distorting estab-
lished usage" (that of MTC) helps solve behavioral prob-
lems, then they "should feel free to do so" (1962, p. 15).
The most significant recent instance of this approach is
Dretske (1981), which attempts "to rescue information
from the clutches of the statisticians and put it to work in
mathematically less purified surroundings" (Dretske
1983b, p. 83; see my commentary on Dretske, 1983a for
details and criticism of Dretske's departure from MTC).
Salutary as this later work may prove to be, the "relaxed"
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1
125

Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
approach has not provided much help in clarifying the
nature of the information that is processed in cognition.
As matters stand, Dennett is exactly right in pointing out
that the intellectual solvency of cognitive theory depends
upon arriving at a sound account of an as yet imprecisely
understood concept of info(s).
In speaking reprovingly of a "relaxed" approach, I do
not mean to suggest that an account of info(s) processing
can be derived by strict deduction from the formalism of
MTC, or that the concepts of MTC by themselves provide
adequate resources for the type of account called for.
Additional resources are clearly needed. And since our
concern in developing such an account is to understand
better the intentionality of certain processes in the ner-
vous system of a cognitively endowed organism, it is
reasonable to expect neurophysiology to make a substan-
tial contribution. A paradigm to heed in this respect is
Marr (1982), who brings mathematical rigor to the em-
pirical study of the mechanisms of vision in a novel and
highly creative way. The present approach attempts to
parallel Marr's in several respects. An important dif-
ference, by way of anticipation, is that Marr's approach
involves virtually no application of MTC as such, and in
fact relies upon the computational model to back up his
extensive use of information-processing terminology.
Inasmuch as cognitive activities are functions between
sensory input and behavioral output (as Bennett puts it
succinctly), they also involve responses to energy trans-
formations ("nerve hits") at the sensory periphery. An
adequate account of these activities may thus be expected
to use certain resources from thermodynamics, particu-
larly regarding the relationship between information and
entropy. I have in mind particularly the intimate formal
relationship between info(t) in MTC and entropy (the
opposite of energy) in thermodynamics, which is accessi-
ble in outline to scientists without special training in
either discipline.
As a final resource there are the basic concepts of
evolution and natural selection, again on a level accessi-
ble without special training. An assumption behind the
present approach is that cognitively endowed organisms
have evolved from simpler life forms and that the neu-
ronal mechanisms of the cognitive functions have evolved
from relatively less complex neuromuscular control sys-
tems. One angle exploited by this approach is to ask, in
connection with a given cognitive function, what em-
pirical constraints probably guided its phylogenetic de-
velopment, and to take those constraints as clues to how
that function actually operates. In application to visual
perception specifically, this emphasis upon evolutionary
constraints is in the spirit of Gibson (1966). My hope is
that the application of MTC, which Gibson all but ig-
nored, will help us say more about how the visual system
processes information from the objective environment
than Gibson apparently was able to articulate.
5. Technical concepts of communication theory
(once-over with summary)
Communication theory is a mathematical discipline, con-
ceived originally for application in the design of commu-
nication circuitry. For present purposes, fortunately, the
technical concepts needed are relatively few, and they
can be defined with minimal use of symbols. (For readers
who want additional detail, the classic source is Shannon,
1948; Abramson, 1963, is one of the clearest technical
treatments available; a reliable source in the psychologi-
cal literature is Luce, 1960.)
Information (here called info(t)) is a characteristic of a
single event (a) within a set (A) of alternative events, one
and only one of which occurs at a given point in a se-
quence (temporal, spatial, or otherwise). Given proba-
bility of occurrence P(a), the information content in bits
of event a is the logarithm (base 2) of the inverse of its
probability (log HP(a); equivalently, -log P(a)). The
average information (H(A)) of the set A is the sum of the
products, for each member taken severally, of informa-
tion content times probability of occurrence (2P(a) log
1/P(a); equivalently, - 2P(a) log P(a)). This quantity is
often called the entropy of set A. (I will label it "en-
tropy(c)" to distinguish it from the entropy of ther-
modynamics.) In a set of three equiprobable events, for
example, the information content of each is 1.58 bits,
and the entropy(c) of the set is the same (0.33 x 1.58 x
3). In a set of three events with probabilities 0.1, 0.3,
and 0.6, however, the entropy(c) is only 1.30 bits ((0.1 x
3.32) + (0.3 x 1.74) + (0.6 x 0.74)). In general, the
closer that the events within a set approach equi-
probability, the closer its entropy(c) approaches max-
imum value.
All communication takes place across an information
channel (of which communication equipment provides
only one class of example). An information channel,
defined with complete generality, is a pair of event sets
the members of which are statistically nonindependent.
In the context of a given communication transaction, one
set A is source (or input) and the other B is terminus (or
output). Since the sets are nonindependent, events at B
are to some extent indicative of events at A. In a sense (not
a semantic sense), events at B contain information about
events at A - in the sense, exactly, that B events add
information with respect to A events. To see what this
means, consider the limiting case in which event b at the
output provides a completely reliable indication of what
event a occurred at the input. Before b, all that can be
known at B with respect to the occurrence of a is its prior
probability (less than 100%). After b, given its complete
reliability, it can be known that a occurred with 100%
probability. The occurrence of b has changed the proba-
bility of a relative to the output from its prior value to a
posterior value of 100%. The occurrence of b thus con-
tains info(t) with respect to a (in the amount of 100%
minus the prior probability of a), which in this sense
(again not a semantic sense) may be said to be information
about a.
The value H(A) fails to reflect the statistical depen-
dence between A and B and is thus sometimes called the a
priori entropy(c) of the input (the entropy(c) of A prior to
B). Another entropy(c) value of A can be calculated when
statistical dependency is taken into account. The a pos-
teriori entropy(c) of A relative to B is defined as the sum
over all members of B of the a posteriori values of each b
with respect to each a. This quantity is symbolized
H(A/B), and represents the amount of uncertainty at the
output about events at the input remaining after occur-
rence of all associated output events. When each event of
A is indicated by events in B with complete reliability,
126
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

then no uncertainty remains and H{AIB) is zero. In real-
life information channels, however, some uncertainty
typically remains at B with respect to A, which means that
the situation of the input is to some extent ambiguous at
the output. (H(AIB) is accordingly called the equivocation
of A with respect to B.)
One further concept is needed, that of mutual informa-
tion. It should be obvious with a little thought that
channels capable of receiving more info(t) at the input are
generally capable of passing more info(t) through to the
output. The capacity of channel A-B as a reliable commu-
nicator of info(t) is thus directly proportional to H(A).
Since equivocation is the opposite of reliable communica-
tion, moreover, this capacity is inversely proportional to
H(A/B). The quantity measuring a channel's capacity for
the reliable communication of info(t) is called its mutual
information and symbolized I(A;B). The equation 1(A;B)
= H(A) - H{AIB) is an important formula of MTC and will
figure prominently in the following discussion of visual
perception.
By way of summary, events that are less than 100%
probable (i.e., are uncertain) in advance convey info(t) by
occurrence, in an amount proportional to their advance
uncertainty. The info(t) of a given event is thus the change
in probability attending its occurrence. The entropy(c),
or average uncertainty, of a set of events is the average
info(t) of its members weighted by advance probability of
occurrence. An information channel is any pair of statis-
tically nonindependent sets of events, conventionally
distinguished as input and output. The a priori entropy(c)
H(A) of the input A of channel A-B is the average uncer-
tainty of A prior to occurrences at B, in contrast with its a
posteriori entropy(c) H(A/B) relative to B which is its
average uncertainty after occurrences at B. H(A/B) mea-
sures the average uncertainty at the output with respect
to the input and is hence referred to as channel equivoca-
tion. The overall capacity I(A;B) of the channel as a
reliable communicator of info(t), finally, is equal to the
quantity H(A) â H(AIB) and is referred to as the channel's
mutual information - that is, the info(t) shared at input
and output.
These concepts from MTC are completely precise and
general, and they are available for service in a non-
metaphorical account of information processing in
organic systems. In their mathematical form, however,
these concepts have no bearing on meaning or intention;
they have no bearing on info(s) processing. What is
needed to assure the solvency of the information-process-
ing approach to cognition, as Dennett saw so clearly, is an
account that bridges the gap between the concepts of
info(t) from MTC and of info(s) with intentional features.
The endeavor to develop such an account is of first-order
importance; and there is room in this endeavor for as
many different approaches as can be coherently formu-
lated. The approach I wish to recommend in the present
essay depends upon the connection between info(t) and
the concept of entropy in thermodynamics.
6. The connection between energy and info(t)
Ever since Von Neumann in 1952 proclaimed the "identi-
ty" of MTC and thermodynamics (Bar-Hillel 1964, p. 12),
there has been speculation among highly competent
Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
scientists about the relationship between these two fun-
damental disciplines (see Sayre, 1976, Ch. 3, for survey).
Although the relationship is still not completely under-
stood, a signal contribution was made by Tribus (1961).
Drawing upon earlier work by Maxwell and Boltzmann,
and more recent work by Gibbs, Planck, and Jaynes,
Tribus was able to show how classical thermodynamics
can be derived from MTC with the help of a few un-
problematic axioms. Substantial help also came from
Brillouin (1962). Leaving aside aspects of this relationship
that still provoke disagreement, we can outline what is
needed here in a relatively straightforward manner.
Entropy in thermodynamics is a mathematical measure
of the disorganization of a closed physical system. Any
physical system consists on the microlevel of elements
that might exist in other configurations, or complexions
(Planck's terminology; see Brillouin, 1962, p. 120), and
that are not empirically distinguishable. For any one
distinguishable macrostate of the system there are many
complexions that might produce it; and the a priori
probability of a macrostate is equal to the proportion of
complexions that might produce it to all possible com-
plexions of the system overall. If P is the priori probability
of a given macrostate, and k is Boltzmann's constant, then
the thermodynamic entropy (S) of the system in that
macrostate is defined as k log,,P ("log,," means natural
logarithm). As a series of interrelated general facts, the
higher the proportion of complexions correlated with a
given macrostate, (1) the more disorder among its ele-
ments, (2) the greater its measure of thermodynamic
entropy, and (3) the less energy it makes available for
useful work. In a state of maximum disorder, a system
contains only thermal energy evenly distributed through-
out and thus contains no energy for work at all â hence the
figurative reference to its highest entropy state as the
"heat death" of the universe.
Like the entropy(c) H of MTC, thermodynamic en-
tropy S is a function of the quantity logP. The major
difference is that, while S is directly proportional to
lognP, H is directly proportional to the negative of log2P.
The way the relationship works out, fine points aside (for
which see Whitrow, 1967, or Sayre, 1976, Ch. 3), is that
the entropy of MTC is the opposite of thermodynamic
entropy. Intuitively, disorder on the microlevel is ran-
domness in the arrangement of microstates; and the more
random a system's microstructure, the more uncertainty
remains regarding that structure after empirical examina-
tion, and the less info(t) the system can convey to a
receptive observer.
The upshot is that all three quantities, energy (from
thermodynamics), structure (from physics and chem-
istry), and info(t) (from MTC), vary inversely with ther-
modynamic entropy. All three are forms of negative
entropy or negentropy for short (following Brillouin,
1962). As such, each can be converted to one of the other.
As gravitational motion is the conversion of structure to
energy, for example, and measurement the conversion of
structure to info(t), so info(t) can be converted to either
structure (biological growth governed by genes) or ener-
gy ("Maxwell's demon"). In any such conversion, howev-
er, the entropy of the system overall tends to increase; in
the economy established by the second law of ther-
modynamics, nothing comes free - not even a measure-
ment (engineer's waggery: "There ain't no free lunch").

7. The evolutionary background
Background from one other area of scientific inquiry must
be marshalled before turning specifically to the processes
of perception. This area is evolutionary biology, tapering
off into ethology and learning theory. One point to be
stressed in this section is that human perception is first
and foremost a means of adapting to a changing environ-
ment. As species evolution is the (relatively slow) adapta-
tion to changing environmental conditions on the level of
the reproductive group, and as conditioning is the (rela-
tively quick) adaptation to changing structures of reward
and punishment on the level of the individual organism,
so perception is the (very rapid) adaptation of the neu-
ronal patterns that guide the organism's response to
environmental contingencies.
Another point to be stressed is that each of these
processes - evolution, behavioral conditioning, and
human perception â can be viewed as a procedure for
maximizing the efficiency of the negentropic coupling
between organism and environment, thus justifying the
deep insight of Marr that evolution and perception,
among other of life's mysteries, are "primarily phe-
nomena of information processing" (1982, p. 4).
According to the second law of thermodynamics, any
closed system tends to increase in entropy with the
forward progression of time. Biological systems, howev-
er, are open with respect to their environment, and they
tend to decrease (with growth) or to remain constant (at
maturity) in entropy level. As Schrodinger puts it pictur-
esquely, a living organism is a device for "sucking or-
derliness from its environment" (1967, p. 79). This means
that an organism is constantly receiving negative entropy
from the world around it, in the form of structure (for
growth), energy (for metabolism), and info(t) (for guid-
ance). In Schrodinger's words once again, "What an
organism feeds upon is negative entropy" (p. 76).
As life is a process of appropriating energy, structure,
and info(t) from the environment, and of sloughing off the
resulting entropy, so death is cessation of the flow of
negentropy from the environment and the beginning of a
progressive entropy increase instead. To sustain the life
process, an organism must maintain a relationship with its
immediate surroundings that enables it to assimilate
negentropy in the forms and amounts needed, and to rid
itself of the resulting byproducts. I refer to this rela-
tionship as a negentropic coupling. Since the environ-
mental side of this relationship is always subject to
change, the organism must be equipped to adjust its
behavior accordingly if it is to accommodate these
changes with a chance of survival. Evolution, condition-
ing, and perception are all ways of adjusting, but on
different time scales and on different levels of activity.
The general drift of evolution is to accumulate gene
pools that produce organisms capable of forming stable
negentropic couplings with their environments within
the normal range of prevailing living conditions. The
general drift of natural selection, in turn, is to single out
gene pools producing negentropic couplings that are
most efficient under prevailing conditions or that are
most capable of adjusting under conditions of change. I
shall refer to these capacities in combination as negen-
tropic flexibility. The upshot of competitive adaptation is
to establish species with relatively high degrees of
negentropic flexibility - not through some "entelechy" or
"vital force," but as a result of the dynamics of its natural
operation.
One tactic for enhancing flexibility of negentropic cou-
pling that was "discovered" during the course of species
evolution is the several-faceted process of behavioral
conditioning. (Despite the recent devaluation of behav-
iorism as psychological theory, the careful empirical stud-
ies of respondent and operant conditioning during earlier
decades remain among psychology's most substantial
achievements.) For purposes of (very rough) comparison,
we may think of the adaptive modification of behavior as
occurring primarily in the association between receptor
and effector mechanisms. Invariable receptor-effector
associations include those that support reflexes, auto-
nomic activity, and various species-specific forms of be-
havior like web-building by the spider and the dance of
the bee. Although associations of this sort are adjustable
on the level of species evolution, they do not vary with the
experience of the individual organism. In adaptive behav-
ior, by contrast, the working association between recep-
tor and effector mechanisms is subject to adjustment,
enabling the organism to alter its responses to repeated
stimulus conditions on the basis of its individual past
experience. An organism capable of adjusting its response
in this fashion - capable, that is, of behavioral condition-
ing - is clearly superior in negentropic flexibility to other
organisms that adapt only through species evolution.
Whereas adaptive alteration of dominant gene struc-
tures (species evolution) requires several generations,
adaptive alteration of neuronal associations governing
behavior (behavioral conditioning) can occur many times
within an individual lifetime. There is little novelty today
in the suggestion of substantial parallels between these
two adaptive processes (tracing back at least to Skinner,
1969). [see special issue on canonical papers of B. F.
Skinner: BBS 7(4) 1984.] The suggestion of a similar
parallel with perceptual awareness is more adventurous.
Nonetheless, another giant step in adaptive flexibility
came with the development of patterned perception,
enabling an organism to adjust its behavior in a changing
environment on a scale marked in milliseconds rather
than portions of lifetimes. What adapts in perceptual
awareness, of course, is not gene pools or afferent-
efferent mechanism pairings, but rather the structure of
the afferent neuronal patterns that generally guide our
discretionary behavior. A leading theme in the present
account of visual perception is that the processes by
which these patterns are adaptively altered can be charac-
terized as forms of info(t) processing.
8. Info(t) processes in the evolution
of visual mechanisms
If a one-sentence description of human vision is in the
cards, I believe it would go something like this: Vision is a
process occurring over a hierarchy of neuronal functions
between retina and cortex by which representations are
adaptively altered in response to changing stimulus con-
figurations, in a fashion maintaining a channel of commu-
nication between representation and environmental ob-
ject with sufficiently high mutual information to enable
the organism to respond selectively to a wide range of
environmental circumstances that affect its interests.
128
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

This emphasis on the adaptive alteration of represen-
tations constitutes a major departure from the theory of
Marr (1982), which is the most carefully worked out
account of vision yet produced by the information-pro-
cessing approach. By Marr's account, the same type of
representation is used in the visual systems of spiders,
house flies, and frogs as in those of human percipients,
with differences only in complexity born of different
purposes (pp. 32-34). The main drift in the evolution of
visual processes is toward representation of "pro-
gressively more objective aspects of the visual world" (p.
340), and toward deriving representations with increas-
ing rapidity (p. 105). According to the present account,
by contrast, evolution tends toward producing in-
creasingly adaptive types of representation, so that the
representations involved in human vision differ radically
from those of "lower" organisms with respect to flexibil-
ity. A likely story of how that came about may serve as a
prologue to this account of how human vision functions.
Any sensory system is (among other things) a control
mechanism for regulating behavioral interactions be-
tween the sensing organism and its sensible environ-
ment. The course of evolution leading to the human
visual system is a progression toward control mechanisms
that are increasingly flexible, and increasingly efficient in
their info(t)-processing capacities. The reason can be
indicated in terms of an important theorem of MTC - the
10th theorem of Shannon (1948).
Shannon's 10th theorem states, in paraphrase, that the
ability of a control system to correct deviations from an
optimal mode of operation cannot exceed the amount of
info(t) at the system's input (for a more exact paraphrase,
see Sayre, 1976, p. 159). Suppose that it is optimal for an
organism to emit behavior b0 under environmental cir-
cumstances e0, and bÂ± under elt but that in the absence of
control it emits b0 and b1 randomly with 40% chance of
the right (optimal) response. Because the deviation or
error rate of the behaving system then in effect is its
equivocation of Â£ with respect to B, the deviation from
optimal operation is measured by the quantity (0.4 X log
1/0.4) + (0.6 X log 1/0.6), or approximately 0.97. This
means that an error-correcting system (such as a system of
perception) must be capable of representing an average of
at least 0.97 bits of info(t) at its input to bring the organism
to optimal performance. A biological corollary to this
important theorem is that the development of organisms
capable of adapting their responses selectively to a pro-
gressively wider range of environmental circumstances
(hence with progressively greater potential for error)
must be supported by the development of sensory mech-
anisms with progressively greater info(t)-handling capaci-
ties. Put as directly as possible, the implication is that
organisms under selective pressure to increase the range
of their adaptive behavior will be under pressure as well
to increase the mutual information of their sensory
channels.
Since mutual information is a joint function of equiv-
ocation and input entropy(c), there are two distinct strat-
egies for increasing this quantity. One is to increase the
capacity of the organism's receptor mechanisms (increas-
ing their entropy(c)), the other to increase the reliability
of the sensory system overall (decreasing its equivoca-
tion). Both appear to have been exploited in the course of
evolution.
Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
As an example of the first, consider what might be
done to increase the capacity of a noninteractive group of
photosensitive receptor cells, such as those interspersed
with nonreceptors in the skin of an earthworm (Walls
1942). One obvious expedient would be to increase the
sheer number of receptors involved - an alternative that
would be attractive only if bulk were not a factor. A less
obvious but more efficient alternative would be to make
the receptors interactive. From the communication-the-
oretic point of view, this amounts to introducing condi-
tional probabilities among neuronal events, in effect
making the uncertainty associated with a given input
event (and hence its info(t) content) depend upon the
occurrence of other input events. (Various mechanisms
that would accomplish this physiologically are discussed
in Hebb, 1949, and Kandel, 1970.) What is interesting
for our purposes is that MTC can show why making
receptors interactive increases their info(t) capacity as a
group. The capacity in bits (Cs) of a combined channel
consisting of two otherwise independent channels with
capacities C1 and C2 is log2 of the sum (2 raised to the
power C1 and 2 raised to the power C2) - in symbols, 2C*
= 2C1 + 2C2. Inspection of this equation shows that
when C1 and C2 are both less than unity, their sum is
less than Cs (recall that the sum of the logarithms of two
numbers is the logarithm of their product). This means
that when two channels with independent capacities less
than unity (single-event channels with equivocation) are
combined by making their input sets interactive, the
capacity of the resulting integrated channel is greater
than the sum of the capacities of the two channels acting
separately. In general, it follows that the receptive ca-
pacities of a group of sensory channels can be used more
efficiently if the channels operate jointly rather than
individually. Given the selective advantages attendant
upon perceptual efficiency, it is predictable on the basis
of MTC that the visual systems of the "higher" orga-
nisms will be highly integrated.
The second strategy for increasing mutual information
of a sensory system is to decrease its equivocation, which
is equivalent to making it less susceptible to noise. Be-
cause a noiseless channel is by definition one in which
each output event correlates invariably with a single
event at the input, this can be accomplished physically by
"tightening up" the connection between input and out-
put, in the sense of making a given input indispensable for
a given output event. An instructive illustration of how
this might work is afforded by the much-cited work on the
visual system of frogs reported in Lettvin, Maturana,
McCulloch, and Pitts (1959). One thing these experi-
ments indicated is that the frog's nervous system discrim-
inates only a few specific configurations of visual stimula-
tion - sharp discontinuity in brightness level (e.g., a
silhouette against a bright sky), overall reduction in
illumination (e.g., a shadow cast by a large predator
nearby), a small object about the size of a fly moving a few
inches away, and so on. Each of these configurations can
be described in terms of its info(t) characteristics, and
each can be detected on the basis of the characteristics
described. For example, the "sharp discontinuity" detec-
tor responds to sharp edges of differential retinal activity,
corresponding to lines of light-dark contrast cast upon
the retina. One side of such an edge is characterized by
relatively infrequent firings, hence by events with rela-

Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
tively high levels of average info(t), and can be picked out
on the basis of random samplings of receptor events
showing consistently high averages. A series of random
samplings on the more highly stimulated side of the edge,
similaly, would show consistent measures of average
info(t) at a lower level due to more frequent firings.
Detection of the light-dark contrast could be accom-
plished by a mechanism for registering different levels of
average info(t) within a local area of retinal activity, the
line being indicated by a sequence of markedly different
readings among neighboring areas. (I am not proposing
that lines of light-dark contrast are detected in this
fashion by the frog's visual system, but only that they
could be. How they are actually detected is a matter for
empirical determination - once we know exactly what to
look for.)
Another discovery of these experiments is that the
frog's visual system provides pathways of excitation that
appear to be assigned exclusively to one visual format or
another. In effect, each configuration is signaled to the
brain by a preestablished channel, which is reserved for
messages of that particular format. Dedicated channels of
this sort may be presumed to be highly reliable (noise-
free). Inasmuch as a frog can conduct its life successfully
at the edge of a pond on the basis of only a few discrimina-
ble visual formats, this particular organization of its af-
ferent nervous system represents an efficient use of its
limited info(t)-processing resources. Evolution of the
frog's visual system, in effect, appears to have exploited
the second general strategy for increasing mutual infor-
mation, that of reducing the equivocation of the informa-
tion channels conveying messages from the retina.
Yet another strategy must have been used in the
"design" of the human visual system, for reasons that
appear weighty from the evolutionary standpoint. Unlike
the frog, which can get by with predetermined responses
to a relatively few distinct visual configurations, the
human organism has become dependent upon the ability
to discriminate a practically indefinite number of distinct
visual situations. This means in turn that the human
visual system must be equipped to process indefinitely
many different message configurations. It is obviously
impractical from the evolutionary standpoint to provide
separate channels for each configuration. What appar-
ently happened instead was the development of a novel
and highly flexible set of procedures for increasing the
mutual information of spatially confined afferent chan-
nels. What appears to distinguish the human visual sys-
tem from that of frogs or cats or other organisms with
similar retinas is that it incorporates procedures for ad-
justing the formats of messages passing through the
system, in response to changes in the objective environ-
ment. These procedures provide a form of short-term
adaptation that I believe to be the essence of human
vision.
9. Functional stages of vision
as info(t) processes
Any message can be symbolized in a variety of codes,
differing in length, configuration, number of code ele-
ments, and so forth (see Abramson, 1963, for definitions
and discussion). Among the practical applications of MTC
is finding the code best suited for a given technological
purpose. For the biological purpose of genetic transmis-
sion, evolution is to be credited with the "finding" that 4
fixed code elements (nucleotides) are an optimal set for
encoding the 20 or so amino acids that must be manufac-
tured for biological growth (see Beadle and Beadle, 1966,
for discussion in explicitly communication-theoretic
terms). For purposes of visual info(t) processing, the
"finding" was of a different sort â namely, that a variable
code format provides the best means of symbolizing the
many different visual circumstances to which the human
organism must respond selectively. The symbols of this
remarkably flexible code are the variable patterns that
structure our visual perceptions. It is with reference to
these patterns, I shall argue shortly, that the inten-
tionality of vision becomes intelligible.
The processes of human vision take place over a cas-
cade (an end-to-end series) of information channels. The
cascade extends from sets of physical events at the object
end of the series, through sets of electromagnetic events
in the adjacent media, hence through sets of elec-
trochemical events in the percipient's retina, to sets of
neuronal events in the cortex by which the sequence is
completed. Between perceptual object and sense organ
are situated as many different channels as there are
distinct media of light-wave transmission (distinct air
masses, optical devices, etc.). Within the sense organ
proper there are further channels, from cornea to aque-
ous humor to lens and retina; which in turn lead into an
upper series of channels, with junctures at optic chiasma,
lateral geniculate body, and various levels of the visual
cortex. Theoretically the output of the cascade is its
juncture with the efferent system, to which it must
convey info(t) properly processed for the effective guid-
ance of the organism's behavior. It is somewhere between
the retina and this efferent juncture that visual patterns
are formed, and that info(t) is transformed into info(s).
Although a full-fledged account of what goes on at these
various stages is nowhere near reach at present, it should
be possible to conjecture reasonably about the types of
info(t) processing that might occur at the major junctions.
Nothing more is attempted in the account that follows.
The key to this account is the concept of pattern. What
I mean by "pattern," informally defined, is a relationship
among elements in a set such that when an arrangement
of a subset of these elements is specified, the arrange-
ment of the remainder is indicated at a level of probability
increasing generally with the size of the subset. As an
intuitively accessible example, consider the pattern of
stones in an archway. If the location of only the cor-
nerstone is known, there are many different ways imagin-
able in which the other stones could be arranged. As the
arrangement of more and more stones becomes known,
however, the number of ways in which the structure
might be completed diminishes rapidly; and when all but
a few have been set, the location of those remaining is all
but determined. Defined in communication-theoretic
terms, a pattern is a set of elements the probabilities of
occurrence of which (at specific times or places, or in
specific sequences) are so interrelated that, as the ar-
rangement of progressively larger subsets of element-
occurrences is given, the info(t) conveyed by the remain-
ing occurrences progressively diminishes.
In the account that follows, the functions served by the
higher levels of the visual system are all aimed at the
130

formulation of patterns of neuronal activity that serve in
the guidance of the organism's behavior, and the ele-
ments of these patterns are neuronal events (firings,
inhibitions, summations) made interactive by condition-
ing or inheritance. From the neurophysiological perspec-
tive, these patterns are configurations of neuronal events
so interrelated that the occurrence of a subset increases
the probability of the remainder's occurring, in propor-
tion to the size of the occurring subset (see Sayre, 1976,
pp. 130-33, for physiological evidence about how this
might occur). From the perspective of visual perception,
on the other hand, these patterns serve as representa-
tions of salient features of the objective environment. Our
task is to account for the origin of these representations -
to tell a coherent story about the info(t) processes by
which the patterns in question emerge.
9.1. The Retina. In rough estimate, it can be calculated that
between 105 and 108 bits of info(t) are presented on the
retina during a typical second of activity. Measured with
comparable tolerance, only about 102 or 103 bits survive
on the level of visual awareness (see Sayre, 1976, for
calculations and data sources). This amounts to a dif-
ference of somewhere between 102 and 106 bits of info(t)
between retina and cortex. In return for this considerable
amount of info(t) lost (or expended), there is a gain (from
none to some) of info(s). For the thing of topical interest
about the patterns of vision is that they are representa-
tions of - are directed upon - specific features of the
objective environment. A natural beginning of an account
of how this happens is with the weeding out of info(t) at
the retinal level.
An expedient available to engineers for reducing the
load on an artificial info(t) channel is the reduction of
noise. In the normally functioning visual system, noise
primarily takes the form of retinal stimulation that is
irrelevant to the guidance of current behavior (what is
irrelevant at one moment may not be so at the next). One
technique for reducing noise is smoothing, or averaging,
illustrated schematically by a line drawn to fit untidy data
points on a graph. A comparable engineering application
is the smoothing of hits on a radar display, by way of
establishing a vector of aircraft movement. An example
pertaining directly to retinal processes is the procedure
discussed above in the case of the frog for detecting a line
of contrast among many disparate "nerve hits." As already
stressed in that discussion, this procedure relies essen-
tially upon the info(t) features of those retinal events.
Another technique of load reduction is the elimination
of redundancy. In an engineering context, redundancy
is often useful to achieve reliable transmission in the
presence of noise, and one of the fine points of commu-
nication-system design is to find the fine line between
reliability and waste. In the visual system, similarly, re-
dundancy may be assumed to be essential to reliable
operation, but in excess it is a drain on limited info(t)-
handling capacities. In one's normal view of a clear sky, a
large building, or a familiar road, by way of example, the
greater proportion of incoming info(t) deriving from
these objects amounts to duplication and is suppressed
at the periphery without further processing. One avail-
able means for accomplishing this is an edge-tracing
procedure that "abstracts" the boundaries of areas of
relatively invariable retinal activity. (A computer pro-
Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
gram for tracing edges on the basis of info(t) features was
developed as part of a working pattern recognition pro-
gram reported in Sayre, 1973, and various other meth-
ods are also available.)
Presumably these are not the only info(t)-reduction
procedures operating at the retina; and probably the ways
such procedures are accomplished at the retina bear little
discernible similarity to the ways they are accomplished
in human technology. Although what is accomplished
may be identical (e.g., elimination of redundant info(t),
the means of accomplishment of man and nature may be
very different.
In this regard it is interesting to reflect upon the
remarkable assumption underlying the account of Marr
(1982), to the effect that the nervous system actually
calculates (p. 149), or infers (p. 44, passim), or computes
(p. 297, passim) its representations; and that it does so
according to mathematical formulae specified by the
author, in the manner of the author's own mathematical
inferences. At first glance this line seems distinctly eccen-
tric - like speaking of subatomic particles computing the
equations of quantum theory. A more credible line would
seem to be that this or that neuronal mechanism in the
retina or optic tract operates on visual data passing
through it in such a manner as to approximate the results
of this or that mathematical transformation, much as the
operation of a radio filter on an incoming signal is approx-
imately described by some set of equations. In Marr's
behalf, however, it must be pointed out that he is working
within the context of computational psychology. Indeed,
he makes explicit that in his use of technical terms, he
wants to restrict "attention to the meanings associated
with machines that are carrying out information-process-
ing tasks" (p. 22). If computers can calculate mathe-
matical functions (which in a limited sense they obviously
can), and if the brain is a computer (the germinal thesis of
computational psychology), then there should be no
problem about the brain - or some part of the visual
system - doing mathematics as Marr's manner of speak-
ing requires.
The problem for Marr, however, is that in his view the
brain is not merely carrying out operations on formal
symbols - formal in the sense of Fodor's formality condi-
tion (1980, p. 65) - and hence doing so in a manner
independent of what the symbols might be interpreted as
being about. According to Marr's view, rather, the cal-
culations the brain is supposed to be carrying out are
about various features of external objects (their surfaces,
pp. 42, 102; their motion, pp. 162, 166; etc.); and given
the position of visual realism that Marr repeatedly
stresses, it seems essential that these calculations have
semantic reference. Where this approach gets hung up,
however, is on the simple point argued earlier in this
essay, that the symbols involved in machine calculation in
and by themselves are not about anything at all. So
neither Marr nor anyone else can insure intelligibility in
the talk about intentional information processing by nod-
ding in the direction of machine computation. In a
nutshell, buying into the computational vocabulary pro-
vides no clarification of how the brain deals with info(s).
Since Marr never defines the sense of "information" his
mathematical analysis is dealing with, we have reason to
remain dissatisfied with his free use of the computational
metaphor.

Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
Leaving aside questions of who or what calculates
according to exactly which formulae, however, the pre-
sent approach (much encouraged by the "Pythagorean"
urgings of Churchland, 1979 agrees with Marr's in treat-
ing mathematics as a major resource for understanding
the processes of vision. According to this account, vision
begins with the detection via their info(t) content of
relatively simple configurations of retinal stimulation,
such as lines and shapes and angular orientation (cf. the
work with cats reported in Hubel and Wiesel, 1962).
The detection of these simple formats is the work of the
Retina, with capital "R" to distinguish the function from
the particular sense organ.
9.2. The Accumulator. The next step is to group these
elementary formats into complex patterns, serving as
potential delineations or sketches of features of the objec-
tive environment. What I have in mind here is something
similar to Marr's "2|-D sketches," but not yet focused on
or matched up with particular objects. The role of these
sketches is to assemble the elementary formats picked out
by the Retina into combinations that reflect persistent
configurations of retinal stimulation and hence are candi-
dates for representing particular features of objects.
On one side of the retina exists a determinate set of
physical circumstances, revealing its presence in an array
of electromagnetic signals. On the other side, I am
conjecturing, there are many sets of temporary sketches,
being synthesized anew as retinal stimulation changes.
One or more at a given moment might match events at the
other side of the retina ("match" will be defined shortly in
terms of mutual information); but further processing is
required before that can be determined.
It should not be assumed, as Marr's account encour-
ages, that these preliminary sketches take the form of a
two-dimensional picture. Almost surely they have no
pictorial form at all, and they bear no physical re-
semblance to the neat photographs and diagrams with
which Marr's book is so profusely illustrated. But this is as
it should be, for what are being reproduced and sym-
thesized in these sketches are not physical features of the
perceptual object, but info(t) structures impressed upon
the retina. The media in which these structures are
momentarily reproduced may be scattered throughout
the midreaches of the visual system. What is required
basically is a field of loosely interactive neuronal circuits,
the activity of which can duplicate and summate the
dominant patterns of activity detected by the Retina.
Because it would be idle to try to identify a physiological
juncture at which something like this might take place,
given our current state of knowledge, let us refer to it
figuratively as the Accumulator.
In the retina of an organism sweeping its gaze across an
unfamiliar scene, many different elementary formats will
be detected (by the Retina) from moment to moment, but
few will be retained within the Accumulator. When the
organism's gaze is directed upon a fixed set of objects,
however, the elementary formats issuing from retinal
stimulation will remain similar through successive mo-
ments and will emerge in the Accumulator as temporary
sketches. An info(t) process by which this preliminary
sorting could be accomplished is based upon a familiar
concept of MTC, that of a Markov source. A Markov
source is equivalent to an information channel with input
and output drawn from the same set of events (the source
alphabet) and related by specific conditional probabilities
of occurrence. In a first-order Markov source, the proba-
bility of occurrence of a given member of the source
alphabet (an output event) is a probabilistic function of
the one event immediately preceding it (an input event).
In general, with an nth-order Markov source, any given
output event is conditional upon the occurrence of the n
events preceding. Application of channel measures (like
mutual information) to a Markov source is assured by the
equivalence of an nth-order Markov source to an n-
membered cascade of information channels with inputs
and outputs drawn from the same alphabet (see Sayre,
1976, pp. 29-30, for reasons).
By treating the series of elementary formats issuing
from the Retina as a Markov source, the Accumulator can
test for repetition by applying mutual information mea-
sures over successive members of the series. A reading of
high mutual information over n successive members
would indicate n repetitions of similar configurations on
the retina. By appropriate adjustment of n, the Ac-
cumulator can make available for further processing a set
of more or less persistent retinal formats.
9.3. The Discriminator. This discussion of operations on
info(t) structures at various stages of the visual cascade is
obviously very schematic. Its purpose is not to provide
even an approximate physiological description, but
rather to indicate a sequence of info(t) processes that
could yield representations with intentional features. To
characterize the next stage in the sequence, it will be
necessary to bring the effector capacities of the organism
into the picture. It has been suggested by several com-
mentators (e.g., Haugeland 1981; Searle 1980a) that con-
sideration of mechanisms through which an organism
interacts with its environment might be necessary for an
adequate account of intentionality. For the present ac-
count, we want to consider not only the effector mecha-
nisms, but also the overall perceptual-behavioral control
loop guiding the organism's responses to a changing
environment.
The perceptual side of this control loop includes the
visual system, channeling info(t) from retina to cortex, as
well as channels feeding into the retina that link the visual
system to the perceptual object. The behavioral side of
the control loop begins with the various stages of the
efferent nervous system, initiating control signals that are
translated into bodily activity undertaken with respect to
objects in the proximate environment. In standard be-
havioral and perceptual circumstances, when the orga-
nism is active and its control system is functioning nor-
mally, its bodily activity is directed toward, or with
respect to, the same object, or set of objects, that pro-
duces the signals at the input of the perceptual side of the
loop. The primary function of the control loop is to enable
the organism to adjust its behavior with respect to those
objects in a manner responsive to its needs and interests.
For the behavioral side of the control loop to serve its
function adequately with respect to a given object, the
perceptual side must provide an adequate representation
of that object at their cortical interface. Considerations of
adequacy in representation bring us back to the third
major stage of visual info(t) processing.
The overall function of the third stage of info(t) process-
132
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

ing is to formulate stable patterns of neuronal activity,
based on the sketches of the Accumulator, that match in
their info(t) characteristics the features of the objects with
which the organism is interacting. As was the case also at
the Accumulator, the representations at this higher level
have no orderly spatial characteristics, and hence do not
match in the sense of image or picture. Their representa-
tion is with respect to info(t) features that have been
preserved through the many channels beginning with the
perceptual object. Because the role of this stage, in a
broad sense, is to highlight the particular features of the
object that are implicated in current behavior, we may
refer to this stage as the visual Discriminator.
The Discriminator is the main locus of visual adapta-
tion. Its input is a set of composite patterns of varying
degrees of completion and detail - that is, the temporary
sketches composed by the Accumulator. Its output is a
stable pattern highlighting those features with which the
organism is dealing in its objective environment. The
transformation it accomplishes between input and output
is a trial-and-error procedure, in which various tempo-
rary sketches in various combinations are tested for suc-
cess in the guidance of behavior.
There are two types of case that must be considered
separately in illustrating the function of this info(t)-pro-
cessing system. The first assumes the existence of a
pattern-storage faculty, like long-term memory except in
not being propositional. This is the faculty of Percept
Storage, which contains patterns proven successful in
past perceptual ventures. In the first type of case, the
Discriminator cooperates with Percept Storage in find-
ing stable patterns that will both (a) serve well in the
guidance of current behavior and (b) maintain a high
degree of mutual information with events at the Retina.
Application of criterion (b) involves treating the series of
information channels between Retina and Discriminator
as an nth-order Markov source, with n's value adjusted
according to prevailing rate of change in retinal stimula-
tion (lower n for higher rate of change ultimately in the
visual field). Patterns meeting this criterion exhibit a
high degree of correspondence in info(t) features with
repeating patterns of retinal activity. Application of cri-
terion (a), on the other hand, involves temporarily "ad-
vancing" a pattern to a position of control over the
activity of the efferent system, and testing out its effects
on the guidance of behavior. If the pattern functions well
(as measured by impending degree of satisfaction of the
organism's immediate needs), it continues to serve in
this capacity until change in circumstances dictates a
change in perceptual focus. If it serves moderately well,
but needs fine tuning, the pattern will be augmented by
greater detail, or changes in detail, from resources avail-
able in the current stock of the Accumulator. If the
pattern serves poorly or not at all, it will be replaced
quickly by another at the position of control.
A case of the second type is one in which Percept
Storage has no patterns available that exhibit high mutual
information with events at the Retina. This would typ-
ically be a case in which the organism is presented with
objective circumstances it had not encountered pre-
viously and hence cannot draw on experience for visual
orientation. In such a case, the Discriminator vacillates
rapidly between criteria (a) and (b), seeking out a com-
bination of Accumulator sketches that will maintain a
Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
moderately high level of correspondence (mutual infor-
mation) with events at the Retina while at the same time
showing promise in the guidance of behavior. When a
pattern emerges that promises to satisfy both criteria at
once, it is refined by testing changes in detail available
from current Accumulator output, and by engaging the
object perceptually from different angles and perspec-
tive. If and when a pattern is found that enables the
organism to "lock" its perception firmly on the circum-
stances of the object - when, that is to say, the pattern is
reinforced by success - it will be set aside for future use in
Percept Storage. These are the major outlines of the
info(t) process of percept learning.
A comparison with Piaget at this point may be instruc-
tive. Piaget (1954) distinguishes two operations with
sensory-motor schemata that he considers essential to our
perception of objective reality. One is "assimilation,"
which is a matter of organizing sensory inputs under
previously established schemata; the other is "accomoda-
tion," which is a matter of developing new schemata
when the old prove inadequate. As Piaget describes the
contrast, "assimilation is conservative and tends to subor-
dinate the environment to the organism as it is, whereas
accommodation is the source of changes and bends the
organism to the successive constraints of the.environ-
ment" (p. 352). Piaget's sensory-motor schemata are
similar in obvious respects to what I have characterized as
patterns controlling the efferent mechanisms, his assim-
ilation corresponding to the process of bringing incoming
retinal stimulation into relationships of high mutual infor-
mation with patterns already in Percept Storage, and his
accommodation to what I have called percept learning.
Insofar as the communication-theoretic framework is
more exact in its basic concepts than the one in which
Piaget was working, it may provide a context in which the
latter can be more precisely formulated. By reverse
token, happy to say, Piaget's findings may provide mate-
rial by which the former can be refined and expanded.
9.4. The Abstractor. One further stage of info(t) processing
is required before visual patterns take on features familiar
to introspection. The role of the Discriminator, summa-
rized, is to adjust the details of the afferent patterns
brought to the effector mechanisms for the guidance of
behavior until a set of patterns is found that enables the
organism's perceptual-behavioral control system to "lock
on" to appropriate features of the objective environment.
Once the control system is locked on and the organism's
behavior is under effective perceptual control, it will
typically turn out that effective control can be maintained
with patterns of appreciably less detail. Although consid-
erable perceptual detail may be required to discern a
walking stick on a bare branch, or a quail in the under-
brush, or a stop sign among billboards and neon lights,
once the object has been picked out and identified it can
be held in view with less attention to details. The function
of this final level of info(t) processing is to cut back on the
details of perceptual patterns without compromising
their effectiveness in the control of behavior. From the
negentropic viewpoint specifically, its role is to enable
the organism to retain an effective environmental cou-
pling with minimum drain upon its info(t)-processing
resources. This it accomplishes by trimming perceptual
patterns of unnecessary detail; in effect, by abstracting
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1
133

Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
those features that prove essential for guidance. We may
refer to this function as the visual Abstractor.
The info(t) processes behind the operation of the Ab-
stractor are described with reference to the equation
defining mutual information I(A;B) as input entropy(c)
H(A) minus equivocation H(AIB). To apply this equation,
let H(A) be the average info(t) of the set of elementary
formats produced by the Retina at a given moment, and
H(AIB) the equivocation of the Discriminator with re-
spect to the Retina. The more detail on the average
among patterns at the Discriminator, the less equivoca-
tion between these patterns and the elementary formats
of the Retina. The less the Discriminator reflects the
diversity of detail at the Retina, on the other hand, the
greater the level of equivocation (H(A/B). As a matter of
working definition, when the control system is locked on
to the appropriate environmental object, the mutual
information 1(A;B) of the overall channel A-B (Retina to
Discriminator) is holding at an adequate level. Quite
simply put, the role of the Abstractor is to reduce the
level of detail at the Abstractor (increase the level of
H(AIB)) to limits compatible with maintaining adequate
mutual information I(A;B) of the visual tract, given the
current entropy(c) H(A) of events at the Retina.
Sketchy as this operational description of the Abstrac-
tor inevitably has been, it is now possible to sample the
type of explanation it offers of familiar Gestalt phe-
nomena. The "vase-face" illusion can be understood as a
consequence of the role played by patterns from Percept
Storage in the shaping of the perceptual field. Illusions of
this sort occur invariably in connection with shapes and
contours that are familiar to the observer from past
experience - that is, with shapes and contours well
established in Percept Storage. In typical cases of pat-
terning by stored percepts, the info(t) configurations
arriving from Retina and Accumulator have been derived
from objects with clearcut identity, so that any mo-
mentary ambivalence about the proper percepts to be
used in further shaping of these configurations is quickly
resolved during further interaction between organism
and object. With a display engineered to trigger "vase-
face" reversal, however, the stimulus configuration is
designed to produce Retinal activity standing in equally
high mutual information with both face and vase per-
cepts, and to yield no cues that would give precedence to
either display under further scrutiny by the observer. In
such a case the Discriminator will oscillate between
equally dominant patterns as it attempts to organize the
visual field.
The phenomena of figural constancy illustrate the role
of the Abstractor function. Phenomenologically consid-
ered, figure constancy is the tendency of representations
within the visual field to retain a fixed configuration,
despite variations in visual perspective and momentary
interruptions in retinal stimulation. Considered with
reference to info(t)-processing operations, figural con-
stancy results from the tendency of the visual system to
produce patterns incorporating as little detail in info(t)
structure as is compatible with effective operation of the
perceptual-behavioral control loop. In the moment-by-
moment functioning of the Abstractor, this amounts to
suppressing detailed changes in perceptual patterns as
long as these patterns remain adequate in their control of
behavior. Inasmuch as our day-to-day dealings with fa-
miliar objects do not rely upon fine discriminations of
differences due to perspective and distance and are not
thwarted when objects drop momentarily from view,
details of this sort are typically not registered in the
patterning of our visual fields. They are abstracted from
the patterns produced by the Discriminator unless they
prove essential for the guidance of the organism's current
behavior. The effect is a constancy in patterning from
moment to moment, until changing circumstances dic-
tate more attention to detail.
Observing that the stimulation of the receptor and
resulting sensations are "variable and changing in the
extreme," Gibson posed as the "unanswered question of
sense perception . . . how an observer . . . can obtain
constant perceptions in everyday life on the basis of these
continually changing sensations" (1966, p. 3). Gibson's
answer, much simplified, is that the senses constitute
perceptual systems that detect invariant structures in the
energy flux surrounding the organism which provide
information about the permanent environment. What
remains deeply problematic about Gibson's view is that
even in its unsimplified version it provides few details
about how exactly the perceptual systems accomplish
this, or about the nature of the information they are
supposed to provide. Marr (1982) is on target with the
complaint that although Gibson "asked the critically
important question" of how constant perceptions can be
obtained on the basis of ever-changing retinal stimula-
tion, "he did not understand properly what information
processing was, which led him to seriously underestimate
the complexity of the information-processing problems
involved in vision" (p. 29). Although Marr certainly did
not underestimate the complexity of these problems,
there remains room for serious doubt whether Marr
himself has understood the informational character of
these processes. For not only does Marr provide no
discussion of the sense of "information" in which vision is
an information-processing phenomenon, but moreover
there is the deep unclarity already noted about how
neuronal mechanisms can perform calculations about
external objects. Without ruling Marr's approach out of
court in its entirety, it seems fair to claim as an advantage
of the present account not only that it offers a fairly
straightforward explanation of how "constant perceptions
can be obtained from continually changing sensations,"
but moreover that it does so in terms of a precisely
defined sense of "information."
10. Intentionality
The account has been silent thus far about info(s); and
intentionality has been mentioned only in anticipation.
The stage is almost set for these two main actors, howev-
er. I have only to recapitulate a few essentials, by way of
introducing a few new labels.
It is natural to think of the perceptual side of the
perceptual-behavioral control loop as divided into an
anterior branch, extending from object to retina, and a
posterior branch, from retina to visual cortex. The input
to the anterior branch, and hence to the visual cascade
overall, is a set of physical events at the surface of the
object - the events responsible for the particular struc-
ture of light radiation reflected from the object in the
direction of the observer. Let us refer to this set of object-
134
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

centered events as the input set O. The output of the
anterior branch is the set of events R at the observer's
retina, which at the same time constitutes the input of the
posterior branch. In normal circumstances the retinal set
R possesses high mutual information with respect to the
object set O, which is to say both that 0 is capable of
issuing a wide variety of distinct signals - that is, that it is
characterized by high entropy(c) H(O) - and that R by
and large provides reliable indications of events at O -
that is, that channel O-R is characterized by low equiv-
ocation H(OIR). Given the normally high mutual infor-
mation 1(O;R) of the channel O-R, there is a sense in
which the info(t) present at R is literally the same as info(t)
present at O. In their probabilistic features, the struc-
tures established at R faithfully reproduce (at least some
of) the structures at 0. Hence (at least some of) the info(t)
present at O is also present at R.
What is important for the perceptual process ensuing is
not the two-dimensional image set up in the retina,
inasmuch as spatial features are lost in the higher reaches
of the visual system. What is important are those info(t)
structures of retinal events that are identical to corre-
sponding structures in the objective environment. This
identity is retained at subsequent stages of visual process-
ing, but only for structures actively involved in percep-
tual guidance.
The posterior branch of the visual cascade extends from
R to a set of cortical events C. Unlike the anterior branch,
however, whose function is to get as much reliable info(t)
from O to R as the retina can handle, the posterior branch
has as its main function to cut back radically on the
amount of info(t) passed on to the cortex, while at the
same time retaining just those info(t) structures that are
important for the guidance of the organism's current
behavior. The processes by which this is accomplished
are those described in the preceeding section (9.2-9.4).
When these processes are working properly the organism
is enabled to adapt its behavior to a variable environment,
under the guidance of perceptual patterns that impose a
relatively light drain on its info(t)-processing resources
while maintaining a high level of mutual information
()
Since the set of cortical events C stands in a rela-
tionship of high mutual information I(R;C) with respect to
the retinal set R, and since R shares high mutual informa-
tion I(O;R) with O, it follows that the mutual information
I(O;C) between object and cortex is comparably high. In
brief, if both channels O-R and R-C are characterized by
high mutual information, then so is the combined channel
0-C. (Except under special conditions, 1(O;C) will none-
theless fall somewhat short of 1(O;R); for these conditions
see Abrarnson, 1963, p. 115.) This means that by and
large the info(t) structures present at C are the same as
(some of) those at O - that the neuronal events in the
observer's cortex faithfully reproduce, in probabilistic
structure, certain events at the object end of the visual
cascade. These events of C are identical with events at O.
The identity in question is not pictorial. There is no
picture at C of events at O - no duplication of color, shape
(pace Locke), or "logical form" (pace Wittgenstein). The
identity in question is of info(t) structure, of a sort akin to
the identity of mathematics (as i = f). (Historical note:
perceptual realism is the position that events in the mind
of the perceiving organism are somehow identical with
Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
events in the object perceived. The present theory is a
version of perceptual realism, maintaining an identity of
info(t) structure at O and C.)
Looking backward to the topics of Section 7, we see
that because of the high level of I(O;C) sustained by the
perceptual process, the perceiving organism enjoys the
benefits of a highly efficient negentropic coupling with its
objective environment. And because of the indefinite
variety of patterns this process makes available for guid-
ance, the organism rates high in negentropic flexibility.
This throws light upon the emergence of patterned vision
in the selective processes by which the human organism
was shaped. For, as pointed out above, the general drift of
natural selection is to single out organic processes with a
high degree of negentropic flexibility.
But what about intentionality and info(s)? The answer
in general is that the relationship of identity in info(t)
structure between O and C is the intentionality of percep-
tion, and that a structure at C enjoying this relationship
possesses the corresponding structure at O as its semantic
content. This is the answer in general; but qualifications
are needed.
First, it should be clear that not just any relationship of
info(t) identity between input and output structures
across a cascade of information channels constitutes a
relationship of intentionality. It is not enough even that
the channel in question be involved in the perceptual
guidance of an organism's behavior. The channel control-
ling pupillary contraction might posse.

is required is a perceptual process that locks on to
particular structures in the objective environment and
tracks those structures through changing perceptual cir-
cumstances. The point of stressing identity of structure
between cortex and object is not merely to adopt a
familiar (philosophic) manner of speaking about the per-
ceptual process, but rather to emphasize the fact that
cortical structures thus engaged are literally focused upon
particular features of an objective environment. The
relationship of "being focused on" is a necessary compo-
nent of perceptual intentionality.
A second requirement is that the focus of cortical upon
objective structure must be maintained by adaptive pro-
cedures that enable the former to adjust to relevant
changes in the latter. In terms used above, info(t) reach-
ing the upper levels of the posterior branch of the visual
cascade is processed in a variable coding format, the
configurations of which are continuously being adjusted
in interests of efficiency. The relatively static formats in
which the frog's brain receives reports from its visual
sensors do not qualify for intentionality. Perceptual in-
tentionality is a dynamic relationship. While the percep-
tual process maintains a steady match between cortical
and objective structures, both poles of the relationship
are constantly changing.
A helpful analogy might be drawn here with the televi-
sion tuner (just the tuner; there are only misleading
analogies with the video-tube display). The upper levels
of the human visual system deal with info(t) impressed
across the retina in something like the fashion in which a
television tuner deals with info(t) impressed across its
antenna. The antenna picks up signals on many different
wavelengths; but only those get through for amplification

that correspond to the resonant frequency of the variable
tuning circuits. Similarly, signals from many sources are
presented to the retina; but only those signals become
encoded for further processing that respond to the orga-
nism's current needs for perceptual guidance. What this
amounts to in either case, quite literally, is the interven-
tion of circuits at the upper levels of the respective
cascades whose activities possess a high degree of mutual
information with respect to selected sets of input signals.
An important disanalogy, however, comes with the man-
ner in which these upper level circuits are adjusted; for
the tuner is adjusted by external dialing. In the human
visual system, by contrast, the structures with which the
info(t) processes of the system culminate are selected for
their ability (1) to focus the percipient's behavior on
changing features of the objective environment, (2) with
minimum outlay of information-processing capacity. The
tuning of the visual system is a process of continued
adjustment, by which the organism preserves balance
with an ever-changing environment.
A third requirement standing behind these two is that
the system must be under load to exhibit perceptual
intentionality. This means that the system must be oper-
ating in relation to an objective environment so that its
info(t) coupling makes a practical difference in the quality
of its continued operation. The case may be otherwise
with the intentionality, say, of speculative reason. But
perceptual intentionality is a feature of info(t) processing
in certain behaviorally involved organisms, as they oper-
ate under constraints from a demanding environment.
With this, the way is paved for info(s). In visual percep-
tion, to recapitulate, the relationship of intentionality is
quite literally a relationship of high mutual information
between a set of objective circumstances and a represen-
tation in the cortex of the perceiving organism. The
representation picks out that particular set of circum-
stances, by virtue of its being the only object in the
perceptual scene with which the representation shares
that relationship. Through such a representation the
organism's perception is directed upon a specific object,
which is thereby the object to which the representation
refers. By sharing identically in its particular structure,
the representation is true of the corresponding object.
But these are precisely the characteristics - inten-
tionality, reference, truth, direction upon an object - that
serve as paradigms of semantic features in CS literature
(see Section 1). Beginning with the concept of info(t), we
have traced the origins of info(s).
Although this account is far from complete and may
require correction in numerous respects, it is fashioned to
capture a set of necessary requirements that together are
sufficient for intentionality. The effect intended is that
any system constructed so as to be able to process info(t)
from its environment, in the manner and with the results
laid out above, would for that reason exhibit perceptual
intentionality. To put it another way, if perceptual inten-
tionality were understood as proposed in this essay, then
(allowing for inevitable refinements and corrections that
will be required as the theory develops) we would never
find ourselves in the position of confronting a system of
this description arid having to admit that it was devoid of
intentional features.
It is not essential that the system be a human organism.
Although the account has been developed with the help
of illustrations drawn from human experience, the human
character of these experiences has been incidental. What
is essential is an info(t)-processing system capable of
formulating representations that (1) are identical in info(t)
structure with specific features of the system's perceptual
environment, (2) vary adaptively in their formulation
with variations in their corresponding objective struc-
tures, and (3) make the difference between success and
failure in the system's dealings with a hazardous environ-
ment. There are undoubtedly many respects in which the
human organism differs in its info(t)-processing capacities
from other organisms, but intentionality of perception is
not necessarily among them. Although the issue is one for
empirical determination, there is no reason by the pre-
sent account why animals other than human should not
possess this feature. Although fishes and reptiles are
probably excluded, higher primates and felines presum-
ably qualify.
It is not essential even that the system be biological in
origin. Although the account alludes to the likely evolu-
tionary origin of the adaptive processes involved in per-
ceptual intentionality, there is no reason in principle why
info(t) processes of this general sort might not be designed
into an entirely mechanical system. I have no idea how
close to the present state of the robotic arts such a system
might be. But advances of two sorts at least appear to be in
order before an intentional robot is feasible. One is the
perfection of data-processing systems that can compute
statistics on their own operations, in real time and in a
manner reflecting fluctuations in the environment from
which their data are derived. Statistical computations of
this sort would be necessary to determine the continually
changing value levels of the communication-theoretic
parameters (H(A), H(AIB), I(A;B), etc.) upon which the
info(t) processes described above are based. The second is
a much fuller understanding than we can muster at
present of the physiological mechanisms by which these
info(t) processes are accomplished in biological orga-
nisms. As Pylyshyn has remarked, discussion of machine
intentionality is often handicapped by the fact that "we
cannot state with any degree of precision what it is that
enables us to claim that people refer" (1980a, p. 444).
Although Pylyshyn might not look favorably upon various
features of the account developed above, he would un-
doubtedly agree that knowing how intentionality works in
humans would aid considerably in building intentional
machines. If the account above is basically correct, at any
rate, advances in our understanding of human perception
may be expected to precede our design of mechanical
counterparts.
At the same time, experiments in the design of me-
chanical counterparts will surely help us test out and
improve our theories of how the original operates. So AI
still has a role to play in the alternative approach laid out
in this essay. The time may even come when we learn
enough about other forms of intentional info(t) processing
in the human organism - for example, the processes of
language and reason - to be able to build similar capaci-
ties into computer-based systems. And presumably such
systems, when they arrive, will manipulate symbols. But
the reason for their intentionality will be their special
forms of info(t) processing, and not the mere fact that they
are symbol manipulators.
Two questions were posed at the beginning of the
136
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

essay: (1) What do the functions of the nervous system
that we ordinarily describe in the intentional idiom actu-
ally do? and (2) What is it about the information involved
in these functions that makes it semantic? Visual percep-
tion is a particular function of the nervous system or-
dinarily described in the intentional idiom. The answer to
(1) proposed in this regard is that visual perception
establishes variably coded representations in the cortex of
the perceiving organism that share a high degree of
mutual information with changing events in the objective
environment. The answer to (2), in turn, is that the info(t)
involved in the various stages of the visual process be-
comes info(s) when a representation, by virtue of its high
mutual information with a particular object, picks out that
object uniquely - becomes directed upon it - and hence
refers to that object specifically in the visual
environment.
11. Postscript
This account of intentionality is obviously incomplete,
not only in requiring additional conceptual and empirical
development, but also in being limited to intentionality of
a rather low-level sort. It tells us nothing as it stands about
language or reasoning, in which CS is no less interested
than in the processes of perception. To show that the
present account is not bereft of implications for these
higher level activities, I wish to sketch out very briefly the
view it opens up on language and reasoning. (These final
remarks are not intended for critical discussion, being
much too scant for that purpose, but only as a gesture
indicating directions worth exploring.)
In Section 9.3, stable patterns of neuronal activity
involved in the processing of perceptual info(t) were
referred to as percepts. Percepts are normally activated
by stimulation at the sensory periphery and are thus
controlled by the external environment. A related ac-
count can be given of meanings, which are in effect
percepts freed from stimulus control. The meanings in
question, of course, are not abstract entities, but rather
are cortical patterns actually functioning in the info(t)
processing of linguistically competent organisms. Be-
cause meanings, like percepts, are patterns of neuronal
activity, their structure can be defined in terms of MTC.
And because the same info(t) structures can be present in
different sets of activities (as with the identical structures
at O and at C cited in the discussion above), the same
meanings can be present in different cortices. Lin-
guistically competent organisms can be conditioned to
activate a given meaning structure on the occasion of a
given auditory signal. And linguistic communities
emerge when many individuals learn to activate the same
meanings upon the same signal presentations.
Although initially under the control of verbal stimuli,
meanings also come to control each other through rela-
tionships of redundancy (see Section 9.1). The meaning
"ripe," applied to bananas for instance, is compounded of
the meanings "yellow" and "handlength" in such a fash-
ion that application of "ripe" in the organism's info(t)-
processing activities ensures applicability of the other two
meanings. Application of "ripe" thus renders the applica-
tion of "yellow" redundant. By reverse token, ap-
plicability of "yellow" is necessary for the application of
Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
"ripe," thus controlling the latter in a restrictive sense.
Concepts, in turn, may be conceived as meanings thus
removed from stimulus control (by either vocalization or
object perception) and brought under the control of other
meanings. Whereas the percept "yellow" is normally
activated only by yellow objects, and the meaning
"yellow" by either objects or auditory signals, the con-
cept "yellow" can be activated not only by sounds and
objects but also by the meaning "ripe" itself. Thus under-
stood, percepts, meanings, and concepts alike are struc-
tures of neuronal activity, distinguished with respect to
source of control.
The redundancy relationships controlling concepts are
basic factors in human reasoning, in two respects at least.
One respect has to do with the notion of a conceptual
linkage. Concepts belong to a shared linkage if they are
mutually relevant to each other's application, perhaps
through the mediation of other concepts within the same
linkage. The concepts "ripe," "yellow," and "hand-
length" thus share a linkage with the concept "banana,"
an association resulting from the coincidence of color and
size properties discovered during standard experience
with edible bananas. If a variety of bananas were encoun-
tered that are not ready to eat when yellow, on the other
hand, the relevant conceptual linkages on the part of the
individual or individuals attempting to eat this fruit would
soon adapt to the novel set of circumstances. Due to the
public nature of the language from which concepts are
derived, however, it is not necessary for a given indi-
vidual to undergo the relevant experiences in order for
his conceptual linkages to be appropriately adjusted.
They can be adjusted through discourse with the affected
individuals. Conceptual linkages are thus media of infor-
mation storage, subject to augmentation and correction
through the experience of subgroups within the linguistic
community. In effect, conceptual linkages are abstract
mappings of percept associations, adjusted by continued
encounters with a shared living environment. By using
these maps to plot the course of anticipated behavior, a
rational agent can explore alternatives before committing
himself to action.
A second respect in which conceptual redundancy
serves reason has to do with the structure of logical
inference. As any student of elementary logic should
know, the paradigmatic form of deduction was long con-
sidered to be the syllogism: if all M is P, and all S is M,
then all S is P. Because the variables in question are
usually interpreted as standing for classes or concepts, an
equivalent formulation would be: if M renders P redun-
dant, and S renders M redundant, then S renders P
redundant. Since the redundancy relationship can be
precisely defined in communication-theoretic terms, de-
duction in this basic form can be understood as an info(t)
process in the cortex of a rational organism. Reason is
thereby brought within the causal matrix, where it con-
tributes directly to rational behavior.
Unlike the case with percepts, the info(t)-processing
role of meanings is not primarily the guidance of ongoing
behavior, but the coordination of activity among different
individuals. In the case of concepts in turn, the role is
maintenance of the organism in a state of readiness to deal
with future experiences. With these higher level cog-
nitive functions, intentionality is a relationship of high
mutual information with objects that may or may not be
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

Commentary/Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
perceptually present. The intentionality of percepts is
initially established through a connected series of info(t)
exchanges extending between the cortex and a percep-
tually present object. But there is nothing in the rela-
tionship of mutual information that requires a direct
causal connection between participating structures. And
once a relationship of high mutual information has been
set up with a particular object or set of objects, that
relationship may continue when the object is no longer
sensibly present. The intentionality of language and rea-
son is thus derivative from that of perception. Such is the
case also with cognitive activities like searching and
hoping where the object in question is expressly absent.
These summary observations on the nature of language
and reason are further elaborated in Chapters 11 and 12 of
Sayre (1976), which also show how the relationship of
conceptual redundancy can be precisely defined in terms
of MTC. Sayre (1979) contains a mathematical proof of the
validity of the basic syllogistic form expressed in terms of
that technical theory.
Further development of these notions, as well as fur-
ther refinement of the account of perception that under-
lies them, depends essentially upon the criticism and
help of the CS community. I hope this help might be
forthcoming despite differences over the fruitfulness of
the computational paradigm. Among substantial points of
agreement with the computational approach as matters
stand are (1) an emphasis upon the functional analysis of
cognitive phenomena, (2) a favorable attitude toward
computer modeling, and (3) a predilection for the termi-
nology of information processing. Among notable diver-
gences, on the other hand, are (4) the central role played
in the present account by the biological sciences (contrary
to protestations that psychology ought to be autonomous;
for example, Fodor, 1981b, introduction), and (5) its
stress on the technical sense of information as treated in
MTC. However, it should be noted regarding (4) that the
present account is not reductionistic, and regarding (5)
that if computers are ever endowed with intentional
features, communication theory might be expected to
help substantially. So maybe even (4) and (5) are not
unforgivable.
At the very least, it should no longer be credible to
remark, with Pylyshyn, that "only one remotely plausible
answer has ever been tendered" (the computational an-
swer), "compatible with a monistic" view of causation, to
the question of what properties an entity must have "to
function in a manner that depends on what it represents"
(1980b, p. 159). The deep-lying purpose of the present
account has been to tender an alternative answer to just
that question.

Not an alternative model for intentionality in
vision
R. Brown, D. C. Earle, and S. E. G. Lea
Department of Psychology; Washington Singer Laboratories, University of
Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QG, England
We will consider four questions about Sayre's argument.
1. Has Sayre resolved the problem of Intentionality In visual
perception? We think not, for two reasons. First, the (admit-
tedly imprecise) terminology of "picking out" implies an essen-
tially efferent process in object recognition: the semantic system
(which Sayre does not specify) is given an active role in deter-
mining what is perceived. A theory of the intentionality of
perception, however, should presumably offer a way in which
visual input can specify uniquely what a given percept is
"about." Sayre points to the ambiguous figures, but from our
point of view, what is remarkable about vision is not that it is
occasionally ambiguous, but that it is so nearly always well
determined.
Secondly, Sayre's proposed solution is so underspecified as to
be impossible to evaluate. His hypothesised stages of processing
probably contain more free parameters than the processes they
are trying to account for. The formalism of his account, in terms
of communication theory, is illusory: the "Retina," "Ac-
cumulator," "Discriminator,"and "Abstractor"arehornuncular
entities whose behavior is quite unspecified, and it is impossible
to tell what intentional characteristics are implicitly embedded
in them.
2. Is Sayre's approach novel? In important respects it is not.
The idea of a semantic resultant of perception helping to deter-
mine what is perceived is not new. It is, for example, the key
feature of the "analysis by synthesis" model put forward by
Licklider (1952) and popularised by Neisser (1967). Sayre says
little about the nature of his info(s), except to reject, explicitly,
procedures and networks as vehicles for meaning. But so far as
we can tell (largely from Section 11, which is supposed to be off-
limits for criticism), his model for the activity of representations
involves the activation of particular nodes in some kind of
associational network not very different from the classic pro-
posal of, for example, Collins and Quillian (1969). This strength-
ens the analogy to the analysis by synthesis model.
3. Is the proposed model truly an alternative? We have to ask,
alternative to what? Explicitly, Sayre is opposing what he calls
the "official" stance of cognitive science, of which "the 'basic
idea' is to conceive the brain as a computing device that accom-
plishes major cognitive tasks as the accumulated effect of many
subtasks." Implicitly, Sayre's model must be taken as an alter-
native to that of Marr (1982), currently the most influential
general theory of vision. Of these two models, Marr's is much
the more detailed and precise; but is Sayre saying anything that
is really different?
Sayre ignores Marr's proposed three distinct levels of expla-
nation (computational theory, algorithm and representation,
and neural implementation). Sayre's criticisms, if they apply at
all, apply to the second of these, and Marr himself (p. 28)
criticises conventional artificial intelligence theories for their
exclusive attention to algorithms. Marr's computational theories
are designed to specify what must be computed, and why this
and only this must be computed, in order to construct a repre-
sentation of aspects of the world (e.g., shape, space, spatial
arrangement, p. 36), and thus to provide information about the
world. The theories draw on real-world constraints incorporated
into an evolved biological system. Insofar as Marr is successful in
producing such theories, they provide the analysis of the precise
relationship between environment and representation that
Sayre requires; and they do so without Sayre's apparently
efferent, "picking-out" process.
We can conclude that Sayre has indeed proposed an alter-
native to current views, specifically those of Marr. But it does
138
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
not seem to us to be a better one. Marr's account provides a
positive heuristic for empirical investigation of vision. Sayre's
information-theoretic account is far too general to make straight-
forward empirical predictions. As an example, consider Marr's
computational theory of stereopsis. It may well be incorrect
(Mayhew & Frisby 1981); but it specifies what must be done in
order to solve the correspondence problem uniquely, and why
that solution will be physically correct (Marr, pp. 111-16). Marr
gives a choice of algorithms by which to implement the com-
putational theory; they specify how it is possible to construct a
unique representation of the orientation and depth of visible
surfaces, which must then be the correct representation of these
surfaces. This seems to us to be a better solution to the problem
of intentionality of vision than Sayre is able to offer. If Marr's
account is wrong, a different account within the same general
framework is more likely to bring progress than Sayre's retreat
to ideas that failed a quarter of a century ago.
Can Sayre's account of the Intentionality of vision be extended?
Sayre mentions the need to extend his account to language and
reason; in the broad context of adaptive behavior that he uses, it
might be more relevant to consider its extension to the inten-
tionality of action.
As regards reason, however, we have only Sayre's concluding
remarks to suggest the kind of extension he would favor. He
says, "As any student of elementary logic should know, the
paradigmatic form of deduction was long considered to be the
syllogism," and he proceeds to draw a parallel between (pre-
sumably) the set-theoretic notation of the syllogism and the set-
theoretic translation of shared information or redundancy. He
concludes that "reason is thereby brought within the causal
matrix, where it contributes directly to rational behavior." This
conclusion is obviously circular, but in any case any student who
has gone much beyond elementary logic should know that the
syllogism is far from being paradigmatic. Indeed, the explana-
tion of syllogistic inference can be seen as a test case for
cognitive psychology, involving far more than some simple set-
theoretic mental logic (Johnson-Laird 1983).
As for the intentionality of action, it is a traditional crux of
philosophical psychology; yet somehow psychology has man-
aged to make progress as a science without the dispute ever
being resolved. Indeed, the philosophical battle has been
waged most fiercely over questions in conditioning and learning
(e.g., Taylor 1964), yet the analysis of these phenomena is, as
Sayre notes, among the most solid achievements of psychology.
In conclusion, we find the formalism of Sayre's presentation
misleading. The ideas he expresses are loose; they are not totally
original; and when they have been used in the past, they have
failed. As an account of intentionality of visual perception, his
target article seems to us to offer nothing to make us prefer it to
existing theories, in particular that of Marr (1982), and as an
account of intentionality in general it seems to have very little
potential.
Semantic content: In defense of a network
approach
Paul M. Churchland
Department of Philosophy, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla,
Calif. 92093
Sayre's applications of the general mathematical theory of com-
munications (MTC) to the special case of perceiving, cognizing,
acting creatures are as illuminating and compelling as any I have
encountered. Considered as natural objects with a hierarchy of
internal complexions coupled very sensitively to each other and
to the environment, sentient creatures emerge as clear cases of
information channels, and hence as special instances of the
general phenomena addressed by the MTC. And given the
cognitive complexity of many living creatures, it is fair to expect
that we will turn out to be, in various ways, interesting instances
of the mathematical concepts at issue. The picture Sayre paints
in answer to his question (1) seems to bear out this expectation. I
have no criticisms of this part of his discussion. It inspired me,
and I hope it inspires others to continue exploring the same
approach.
On the narrower matter of question (2), however, I must
decline to accept Sayre's answer. I do not think his well-turned
sketch of tight negentropic coupling will provide a very il-
luminating or faithful account of the common-sense notion of
semantic information, nor will it provide a solution to "Searle's
Problem" (Searle 1980). For an adequate solution to both of
these, I believe, we must for the following reasons return to the
general area of the "procedural" or "network" approaches re-
jected by Sayre.
One of the problems with trying to explicate a state's semantic
content in terms of its peculiar relations with the external
environment is that we can always contrive counterexamples
where the relevant environmental relations are widely diver-
gent, and yet the semantic content of the states at issue remains
the same.
The simplest illustration of this is the thought experiment in
which a sleeping man has his brain removed from his body and
placed in a vat, there to be stimulated at all afferents and
monitored at all efferents by a supercomputer, one which
stimulates in every detail a normal but "fictive" life for the
unknowing victim. The point of the example is that the brain's
informational coupling to the environment has thus been radi-
cally changed. It is now interacting with the ebb and flow of a
computer's insides, instead of with the ebb and flow of the man's
home and job and family. But has the semantic content of its
perceptions and thoughts and intentions been changed as a
result? I take it the answer is no. Were we to listen in on the
man's subjective adventures by monitoring his fictive speech,
we would ascribe semantic content just as before ("Now he
thinks he's at a baseball game; now he's watching a double play;
now he's asking for a hot dog"; etc.). In particular, we would not
reconstrue his fictive speech as being systematically about the
shifting configurations of flip-flops in a computer. Our victim
knows nothing about computers. He is not even aware that his
situation has changed.
Examples like this illustrate the divergence between the
semantic content of a state and its nomological or statistical
relations to environmental objects and states of affairs: One can
have the same semantic content even where one has different
environmental relations. A divergence shows up in the other
direction as well, for there are real cases of people enjoying the
same coupling to the same environment, but whose semantic
contents are very different from each other. We need only think
of people and cultures who bring very different concepts and
theories to their perception and understanding of the same
external phenomena. Where you see lightning and hear
thunder, a primitive sees heavenly fire and hears god shouting,
and a physicist sees a sudden flux of electrons and hears the
sudden thermal expansion of the air within its path. Same
external phenomena, same coupling, but different semantic
content in all three cases.
The lesson of these examples is that the intentional states of
cognitive creatures enjoy nomic and statistical connections not
only with the environment, but also with the enormous range of
other intentional states, actual and possible, to which the crea-
ture is subject. Intentional states are part of an intricate and
ongoing economy of such states, and the semantic content of any
such state is determined primarily, and perhaps exhaustively,
by its peculiar causal or computational role within that complex
cognitive economy. This returns us to a network or conceptual
role theory of semantic content (as outlined in Churchland,
1979).
Sayre rejects this approach on basically Searlean grounds: A

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
purely formal set of internal relations, no matter how config-
ured, seems to him inadequate to capture genuine semantic
content. Let me close with some comments on this. The proper
strategy with which to address Searle's Problem is not to try to
augment or inflate such formal economies in hopes of finally
achieving the golden fleece of True Intentionality. The proper
strategy is to deflate the inflated conception of the goal we are
after.
The fact is, when one assigns a sentence, a sentence of one's
own idiolect, as the "semantic content" of another's internal
state or overt utterance, one is not thereby showing how the
target state relates to the external world. One is showing how
the target state relates to one's own states. Talk of reference and
meaning masquerades widely as talk about how language and
thought relate to the world, but the cash value of such talk is
always a matter of relating words and utterances to other words
and utterances. In trying to divine another's content, one is
always trying to find a semantic analogue within one's own
cognitive economy, a concept or sentence that plays a suffi-
ciently similar inferential role.
It therefore seems wrong to me to assume that the states of a
genuinely cognitive creature enjoy some elusive "intentional"
relation to the external world, whereas the states of a systematic
computer mockup of that cognitive system must inevitably fail
to enjoy such a relation, and must therefore fail to be a genuine
cognitive system. We humans enjoy no relations to the world
that such a system would not also enjoy. We, and the systematic
functional mockup, are just intricate internal economies in
causal interaction with an external world. Given a rough iso-
morphism between the relevant economies, there is as much,
and as little, sense in ascribing semantic content to the artifact's
states as there is in ascribing it to the states of your own brother.
If intuition syas otherwise, then intuition has been misschooled.
Communication theory and intentionality
John G. Daugman
Engineering and Computer Science and Psychology Departments, Harvard
University, Cambridge, Mass. 02138
Sayre's proposal is that the intentionality of mental events
originates in certain feedback and control processes which he
characterizes in terms of communication theory. In principle,
such a formulation is compatible with the fundamental intuition
(originally articulated by the 19th-century Austrian Franz Bren-
tano) that the distinguishing feature of mental events, which
imparts to them intentionality rather than physical extension, is
their character of referring to or representing other objects or
states. Because communication theory provides a framework for
the scientific study of signification and representation, Sayre's
basic premise has a certain fresh appeal.
Taking Sayre's project in its own terms, I think its central
weakness is the underlying view that the goal of perception is to
maintain high mutual information (essentially fidelity) between
object and representation. I will argue on various grounds that
this is surely not an appropriate description of perceptual
processes beyond the earliest retinal levels, if indeed it is
applicable even there.
(1) In a formal sense, there is a basic incoherence in Sayre's
use of Shannon's (1948) analysis of the capacity, equivocation
entropy, and mutual information of a communication channel.
Focusing on visual perception as a goal-directed process that
clearly exemplifies intentionality, Sayre treats the sequence
Object-Retina-Cortex as forming communication channels
H(O/R) and H(OIC) with associated mutual information mea-
sures I(O;R) and I(O;C) (in Sections 5, 8, and 10); but this
springs from a vernacular sense of information structure that is
entirely different from the statistical sense of information struc-
ture for which Shannon's formulation applies. Whereas Sayre
acknowledges the lack of direct connection between the tech-
nical sense of information ("info(t)") and semantic information
("info(s)"), his investment in communication theory commits
him to a primary concern with fidelity. As Shannon stresses at
the beginning of his classic monograph, "The fundamental
problem of communication is that of reproducing at some point
either exactly or approximately a message selected at another
point" (1948, p. 379).
But fidelity analysis either misses the whole point about
perception or else it must be formulated so loosely that it is
incoherent, as suggested by the following simple considera-
tions. First, An awesome feat of visual perception is the in-
ference of three-dimensional (3D) world properties from a two-
dimensional (2D) image - a kind of "inverse optics." As Poggio
and Torre (1984) have stressed, this task is computationally an
ill-posed problem whose solution is indeterminate. Remark-
ably, this basic problem confronting the visual system is com-
pletely lost sight of in Sayre's fidelity-based analysis of the
"communication channel" between 3D object and 2D represen-
tation of it in Retina or Cortex. How can one define or compute
the fidelity of a representation in which dimensionality is
changed? The units are incommensurate; the event sets are of
different rank. Because no relationship of identity is possible
between incommensurate structures, it is difficult to give co-
herent meaning to Sayre's basic claim that "the relationship of
identity in info(t) structure between O and C is the inten-
tionality of perception, and that a structure at C enjoying this
relationship possesses the corresponding structure at O as its
semantic content" Section 10).
Second, The "information content" of an object or its image,
defined in Shannon's sense of possible states, is infinite until
some grain structure is imposed (such as the molecular structure
of matter or the quanta! nature of light). The bizarre thing is that
Sayre would have to specify such quantities of information
content in order for the definition of mutual information (or
equivocation entropy, etc.) to have any meaning, and then such
measures would of course be irrelevant. That is the trouble with
trying to put objects into communication channels: It is doubtful,
that one could specify in any useful way the "information
content" of an object.
(2) In communication theory, the assignment of "input" and
"output" ends of a channel is irrelevant; the theory is about the
relationship between two probability distributions, and there is
no intrinsic difference between them except in statistical terms.
But this is inadequate for Sayre's intentions, which require an
asymmetry in direction of reference between object and repre-
sentation in order for the intentionality of perception to be
captured by its referentiality. Within Sayre's "mutual informa-
tion" account we would have to say equally that a stone is also a
representation of our percept of it, and then the desired distinc-
tion between extension and intention would be lost.
(3) It is generally agreed that perceptual processes are not in
any sense photographic, but rather involve such things as data
compression and summarization of image information by the
extraction of salient features. But these are processes of data
reduction and hence yield low mutual information, contrary to
Sayre's characterization of maximizing mutual information. (The
best way to maximize mutual information, which Sayre says is
the ground of intentionality in perception, is to take a very high
quality photograph of the retinal image!) Making explicit the
semantically relevant features of the visual environment has less
to do with the verisimilitude of signals (which Sayre's account of
"information structure" is about) than with their deconstruc-
tion. And of these processes, the explanations proposed by
Sayre (Section 9) amount only to Cognitive Psychobabble (posit-
ing an Accumulator, a Discriminator, an Abstractor). Such
explanatory strategies, which one sees all too often in cognitive
psychology, are reminiscent of the well-known medieval expla-
nation of the mechanism by which sleeping powder has its
effect: namely, through its Dormative Potency.
(4) Finally, in support of Sayre's basic goal of guaranteeing the

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
intellectual solvency of cognitive theory by showing how info(t)
is transformed into info(s), I think that some encouragement
might be found through the example of a well-understood
perceptual faculty in which a meaningful object-property is
inferred at an early level from a less meaningful image-property.
In the perceptual phenomenon of color constancy (the Land
Effect), the perceived colors in a Mondrian patchwork are
largely independent of the actual wavelength distributions of
light reflected from any given patch. Rather, the colors that we
see are governed directly by the pigments in the object re-
gardless of illuminant. The ability to "abstract away" the irrele-
vant properties of illuminating light conditions (wavelength mix
and intensity) and to infer directly the object's true pigment
properties despite the unfaithful signals reaching our retinae is
the remarkable inference whose retinal mechanisms are spec-
ified by Retinex Theory. Perhaps this phenomenon illustrates
concretely how even very low-level mechanisms make info(s)
inferences about invariant object-properties that are not explicit
in the info(t) content of the signals received.
Engineering's baby
Daniel C. Dennett
Center for Cognitive Studies, Tufts University, Medford, Mass. 02155
First let me tell you about a wonderful invention of mine, the
Life-of-the-Party Machine. Here's how it works: As each guest
arrives at your party, the Vigilator "locks on" to that guest for a
few minutes, establishing a communication channel of high
mutual information, so that the structures of some of its own
internal states come to be identical to the objective structures of
the guests - that's phase one. In phase two, the Extrapolator
selects a subset of those structures "for their ability" to antici-
pate the guest's reactions to the other guests; and finally, in
phase three, this subset of structures guides the Life-of-the-
Party Machine in the selection of the beverage for each guest
that will optimally "tune" the "impending" behaviors of all the
guests, so that everybody ends up having a wonderful time.
That's how it works, and of course it's still a bit sketchy and no
doubt will need some modifications along the way, but now that
I've worked out the basic idea, from here on out it's engineer-
ing's baby.
This won't do, alas, for even if the basic idea were fine, all the
hard problems have been kicked downstairs to engineering,
with scarcely a clue about how they are to be solved. I proffer
this parody of Sayre's target article in a tentative and apologetic
spirit. I am probably missing the point and conjuring up a
strawman. It is now Sayre's tum to explain why my parody is
unfair, why he is not confusing the "specs" of a system with its
design, why his various proposals take us a step or two forward,
instead of backward, as they seem to me to do. What puzzles me
is that Sayre apparently levels the very charge I have just
expressed against him against Gibson (1966) - correctly, in my
opinion: "even in its unsimplified version it provides few details
about how exactly the perceptual systems accomplish this, or
about the nature of the information they are supposed to pro-
vide." So apparently Sayre thinks he has moved significantly
beyond Gibson in these regards. Apparently he thinks he has an
alternative to Marr (1982), for instance, rather than just a theory
sketch at a less specific level, though I cannot see why.
At one point Sayre offers a telling analogy with the television's
tuning circuits, "whose activities possess a high degree of
mutual information with respect to selected sets of input sig-
nals. " This is a somewhat ominous analogy, since it characterizes
the desired effect of such a tuning circuit, rather than the means
by which the effect is achieved. In the case of the tuning circuit,
the means are well enough known that this is a legitimate
specification. Can the same be said for all the various "info(t)"
processes that Sayre must invoke in his account? There seems to
me to be a striking difference in explicitness in Sayre's descrip-
tions of processes, and at just the crucial place: where he must
turn the corner from what he calls info(t) to info(s).
Sayre begins with the claim that a (desirable) relation be-
tween distal objects of perception and the cortical states that
represent them is high mutual information. We can all agree on
that; everyone from Gibson to Marr to Fodor (1975) to Winograd
(1972) supposes that a necessary condition of (good, useful)
representation is high fidelity - accuracy plus informativeness -
and the mathematical theory of communication (MTC) concept
of high mutual information captures this nicely. If others make
less of this condition than Sayre does, perhaps it is because they
take it for granted. It is quite clear that there are many ways of
meeting this necessary condition, as shown by Sayre's relatively
detailed account of noise reduction and tuning, occurring be-
tween what he calls the Retina and the Accumulator. So long as
we are on MTC's home turf of maintaining high mutual informa-
tion relations, its resources are indeed impressive, but this
necessary condition does not distinguish vision from television.
We still have to get the Discriminator and the Abstractor
working, if we are to have any account at all of vision and the
promised info(s), and when Sayre turns to them, his accounts get
sketchier.
The Discriminator is to operate rather like an analysis-by-
synthesis process, one gathers. The task is to find "stable
patterns that will both (a) serve well in the guidance of current
behavior and (b) maintain a high degree of mutual information
with events at the Retina." Sayre describes an MTC method for
meeting the second criterion - but note that it is crucial that the
relata are events at the Retina, not distal events, which the
Discriminator cannot observe, on pain of regress. But what
MTC process can select patterns meeting criterion (a)? We get a
rosy description of a process that tests the effects on the guid-
ance of behavior of "advancing" a pattern to a position of control,
and while this sounds right phenomenologically, Sayre can
hardly claim to be cashing out his phenomenology in the good
hard coin of MTC. And when we turn to the Abstractor, we get
more handwaving - acknowledged, to be sure, but then where
is the contribution of MTC to cognitive science?
The way to turn the corner and distinguish vision from
television, Sayre notes, is to design a system that will have the
right sort of negentropic coupling and negentropic flexibility.
There is nothing to quarrel with here, and nothing new except
the language. We must figure out how we get constancy of
perception out of all the variability on the retina, but of course it
has to be the right constancy - the right mix of negentropic
coupling and negentropic flexibility. As Gibson saw (and Sayre
saw that Marr saw that Gibson saw), this is the central "how"
question, but Sayre seems to me to be no closer to giving an
answer (right or wrong) than Gibson was. Indeed, in spite of the
terminological innovation, he does not seem even to have given
a more perspicuous setting of the question. If we had a scaling
defined for negentropic coupling or flexibility (as we do for
mutual information), we might have some new powers of de-
scription, and hence problem setting, but so far as I can see,
given several different negentropic couplings, or flexibilities,
there is no prescribed way of saying which gets the higher
rating. Compare two moths, one with second-rate eyes and a
second-rate but lightweight brain, and the other with eagle eyes
(more structure for more info(t)), but more weight to lug around,
hence greater energy demands - which creature has struck the
better negentropy bargain? When does it improve one's
negentropy coupling to turn off one's information-gatherers -
and sleep, for instance? I do not want to disparage these
questions; on the contrary, they strike me as well worth pursu-
ing, but precisely because their answers are not obvious, one
cannot simply fix everything but info(t) at some standard value
and then declare that (always, or even in general) more info(t), or
higher mutual information relations, is a Good Thing. Many
increases in info(t) result in decreases in safety, efficiency, and
so forth. Moreover, of course, claiming that a certain trade-off

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
would be optimal does not explain by subsumption under a law
(there is no law of nature to the effect that design will be
optimal), but rather generates a hypothesis to test - and leaves
the question of mechanism untouched (Dennett 1983).
Sayre realizes all this, for he draws attention to the familiar
point that "the posterior branch [retina to visual cortex] has as its
main function to cut back radically on the amount of info(t)
passed on to the cortex, while at the same time retaining just
those info(t) structures that are important for the guidance of the
organism's current behavior (Section 10, paragraph 5). But he
has not yet shown that the description of processes for per-
forming this latter task has been advanced by his proposed
innovations. Moreover, he has not shown that he has any real
alternative to approaches that treat this part of the problem as a
"computational" problem in the sense he disparages.
His main criticism of that school of thought, by the way, is
curiously undercut by his own proposals. What is wrong, he
says, with AI (artificial intelligence), is that "the symbols in-
volved in machine calculation in and by themselves are not
about anything at all." But the same would be true of the stable
patterns selected by the Discriminator in virtue of their prowess
in behavioral control: In and by themselves - that is, indepen-
dently of their relational, nonintrinsic properties such as the
property of yielding high mutual information relative to some-
thing distal - they are not about anything at all. There are many
things wrong with various versions of the "machine calculation"
paradigm in AI, but failing to do justice to intrinsic intentionality
is not one of them. By Sayre's own lights, intentionality is some
sort of extrinsic property - presumably definable in the terms of
MTC, after all - so there is no such thing as intrinsic
intentionality.
Stalking intentionality
Fred I. Dretske

Sayre asks many of the right questions. From where I sit, he
even looks in the right places for the answers. He has, of course,
been looking in these places a long time. He was, as far as I
know, one of the first to explore the distinctively philosophical
applications of communication theory. My own interest in
information, first in epistemology and later in the philosophy of
mind, was stimulated by Sayre's early work in this area. But
though we both look in the same places, we seem to find
different things. I too think that the key to intentionality lies in
that network of organism-environment relations characteristic
of information (in the statistical sense). Why, then, can't we
agree about just how this key unlocks the door?
Because Sayre is explicit about restricting himself to the "low-
level" intentionality of perception (and not to "more complex
forms of cognitive activity"), and because he devotes merely a
speculative postscript to cognitive activity involving meaning
and concepts, I assume he intends to avoid asking himself (or
having me ask) the question he asked me in his BBS commen-
tary on my book (Dretske 1983a): How does one manage, as all of
us with false beliefs do manage, to manufacture false contents
out of info(t) (Sayre 1983)? In other words, how, on an informa-
tion-theoretical account of things, does one get an account of
misrepresentation? Sayre suggests in his postscript that it is all
really quite simple: Meanings and concepts are merely percepts
that have been progressively freed from stimulus control. As I
understand things, though, this means they have been freed
from the only thing that, in Sayre's account of things, gives
meaning (reference, aboutness) to something. The percept
"yellow" gets its intentionality, we are told, by being activated
only by yellow objects, by "picking out," "focusing," or "lock-
ing" on the color yellow. How, then, do concepts or meanings,
being freed from this kind of exclusive control, manage to be
about yellow when they do not pick out, focus, or lock on this
color? To suggest (as Sayre seems do to in his postscript) that
these "higher order" structures get their meaning by coming
under the control of, or being activated by, other meanings is an
obvious evasion. Where do these other meanings come from?
This is not, by the way, an original criticism. It is the same
criticism Sayre made of me. I repeat it, not just to even the
score, but because it is an important point, one that any account
of intentionality must confront. And the issue is particularly
acute for causal or informational theories of intentionality be-
cause in tracing the source of intentionality to a structure's
causal or informational relations to other conditions - conditions
(notice!) that must exist for the structure to stand in these
relations to them - it is hard to see how one can have meaning
without truth, how one can get an account of misrepresentation.
Sayre may not have liked my way of dealing with this problem,
but I was surprised to find him so casual when it was his turn to
deal with it.
I am, of course, being unfair. Sayre deliberately restricts his
account to the intentionality of perception. His speculative
remarks in the postscript on "higher order" cognitive activities
are "not intended for critical discussion" (though I am curious
about what kind of attention he expected them to receive -
especially in this journal). But what is the intentionality of
perception? Is this supposed to differ from the intentionality of
knowledge, thought, and belief? Sayre apparently thinks of
visual perception as some kind of cognitive activity, as (I assume)
a coming to know that something is so by visual means: for
example, seeing that the flower is yellow or that there is a yellow
flower nearby. But doesn't this involve the application of con-
cepts, the having of thoughts and beliefs, perhaps even (on some
accounts) the use of reason and the making of inferences? Isn't
this a red-blooded prepositional attitude, something with as
fancy a content as we can ever expect to find inhabiting the
mind? Are we to understand all this as "low-level" inten-
tionality? Why? It looks pretty robust to me. In fact, it looks
suspiciously like the higher level cognitive activities that Sayre
wants to exempt from critical discussion.
Of course, in speaking of the intentionality of perception
Sayre could have meant the fact that perception is perception of
something, the fact that our experience (or percept) is of or
about or directed upon a specific object (e.g., a flower). He
certainly talks this way at times. But if this is what he meant, a
great deal of what he says about the conversion of statistical
information (info(t)) into semantic information (info(s)), the
transformation that is supposed to explain this form of inten-
tionality, doesn't make sense. For this aspect of intentionality
clearly doesn't depend on the kind of negentropic coupling (high
mutual information) between cortical structures and object that
Sayre requires. I can see a flower (my percept can be of and in
this sense directed upon, a flower) when, because of bad lighting
and distance, I get very little information about the flower. My
representation of the flower need not (and often does not) pick
out the flower in the way Sayre says it must (being the only
object with which the representation shares that relationship) in
order to be of the flower. A representation (whether percept or
photograph) can be ofX (e.g., my cousin Clyde), it can exhibit
this kind of intentionality (call it referential intentionality) with
respect to X, without distinguishing X from Y (e.g., a twin
brother), without, that is, representing X as X. Without, in
other words, exhibiting the kind of classificatory intentionality
characteristic of knowledge and recognition.
It is not only unclear what aspect of intentionality Sayre
means to be explaining, what kind of thing info(s) is supposed to
be. (Is it a proposition? A truth condition? An object or circum-
stance - that which the representation is of or about? Or
something else?) It is also unclear exactly what process is
supposed to effect the transformation of info(t) into info(s). At
one point we are told that the essence of the matter is the loss of
info(t) ("in return for this considerable amount of info(t) lost (or
expended), there is a gain (from none to some) of info(s)"). At

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
another point the notion of a "pattern" seems to figure promi-
nently ("the key to this account [of how info(t) is converted into
info(s)] is the concept of pattern"). Later it is suggested that the
important point is that the information present at O (the percep-
tual object) is the same as the information in the cortex (or, and
here begins a series of equivocations, the information structures
are the same, or the events in the cortex are identical with the
events in the environment). And then, of course, we have the ad
hoc sounding qualifications designed to rule out simple mechan-
ical systems from having intentionality; doorbell systems, for
instance, do not have intentionality, even though the informa-
tion at the bell is the same as the information generated at the
button because the system doesn't satisfy the right kind of
"focus," "dynamic relationship," or "load" requirements.
Frankly, I find it hard to tell what is supposed to bear the
weight of this account. It sometimes seems as though "key"
points are tugging in different directions. If huge chunks of
information are lost between the retina and the cortex, and this
loss is the key to intentionality, then how can the information in
the cortex be the same as that at the retina (or in the environ-
ment)? It cant be numerically the same, of course. And despite
the way Sayre sometimes talks, the cortical events or structures
are clearly not the same as the external circumstances about
which they carry information. So how can the relationship of
identity in info(t) structures between O (object) and C (cortex)
be the intentionality of perception.
I think I know what Sayre wants to say. He wants to say that
the information in the cortex - the information, namely, that
there is a yellow flower out there - is the same information that
is on the retina and the same information that is generated by
the yellow flower's being out there. But he can't say this because
this is already to invoke a notion of semantic information (that
there is a yellow flower out there) which he doesn't have. And
until he has it, he can't claim an identity between what is
happening out there and what is happening in the cortex. And
no identity, no conversion of info(t) into info(s).
Intentionality and information theory

Sayre begins with an excellent rendition of an old argument that
formal symbol manipulation, "symbol crunching," can never by
itself capture the semantic dimension of mental processes - an
argument forcefully restated in a previous target article by
Searle (1980a). How could one build a physicalistic theory of
intentionality - of the semantic relation between symbol and
referent? This seems particularly unlikely if the referents are
past or future events, or are abstract possibilities as in mathe-
matics. But when the referents are actual objects or states of
affairs (e.g., in perception), a causal relation can be established
between the symbolic representation and referent. Thus the
hope for a physical reductive treatment of some intentionality,
the hope for "strong AI" (artificial intelligence), lies in adding
transducers to symbol crunchers. Computers may be just syn-
tax, but computers-plus-transducers may deliver semantics.
That is the crux of the robot-reply to Searle used by Fodor (1980)
and others, which was ably but briefly answered by Searle in his
response (1980b, especially p. 454).
Sayre's theory is an information-theoretic (I-theoretic) varia-
tion on the robot reply. It uses the I-theoretic properties of the
transducing channel between objective states of affairs and
cortical events in an attempt to account for intentionality in
human perception. The intuitive idea is given in an aside by
Sayre that a dashboard light may "designate" or "refer to" low
oil pressure. The same idea occurs in Dretske's gas gauge
example: "Our humble gauge even exhibits the rudiments of
intensionality [sic] - representing the amount of gas in my tank"
(1983b, p. 82).
The key assertion is that "the relationship of identity in info(t)
structure" (given essentially by low channel equivocation) be-
tween the object set O and cortical events C "is the inten-
tionality of perception." There is a simple counterexample. Let
the input alphabet O and the output alphabet C both be (0, 1). In
channel A, a 1 is received if and only if a 1 is sent, and similarly
for 0. Since channel A is noiseless (outputs determine inputs),
the equivocation (or conditional entropy) of the inputs O with
respect to the outputs C is zero (see Abramson 1963). Since the
channel is deterministic (inputs determine outputs), the equiv-
ocation of C with respect to O is also zero. This is the best
possible case for Sayre's assertion about the identity of info(t)
structures between O and C.
To describe the channel using semantic notions, we ascribe
the "meaning" of an output signal to be its unique causally
antecedent input signal (if such exists). An observer who knew
the particular causal properties (conditional probabilities) of
channel A would then know that a 1 received means a 1 was sent
and similarly for 0. In terms of perceptual intentionality, a 1-
received would be perceived as a 1-sent, and similarly for 0. Can
these semantic relations be characterized using the equivalence
of info(t) structures between O and C?
Consider another channel B defined by permuting the roles of
0 and 1 in the output alphabet. A 1 (response 0) is received if and
only if a 0 (response 1) is sent. All the I-theoretic concepts using
averages, such as the entropies, the equivocations, and the
mutual information, are identical in channels A and B. In Sayre's
terms, the info(t) structure defined on C by channel B is also the
same as the original info(t) structure on O. Yet the semantic
meaning or informations(s) carried by the output signals in
channel B is totally different. A 1-received means aO-sent, and a
0-received would be perceived as a 1-sent. In general, scram-
bling (i.e., permuting) the output alphabet leaves all the average
properties of the channel exactly unchanged but scrambles the
meaning of the output signals. Thus the attempt to characterize
semantic relations and perceptual intentionality using average
I-theoretic properties of the channel from the object set O to die
cortical events C (e.g., low or zero equivocation) must fail.
In the examples, the "meaning" of an output signal was
defined as its unique causally antecedent input signal, a defini-
tion which only makes rigorous sense for noiseless channels. To
know the meaning of output signals, an observer must know the
particular causal properties that determine the channel. It is not
sufficient that the channel have certain average I-theoretic
properties. Thus, to know the meaning of a cortical event r, an
observer must know its causally antecedent objective event s.
But to assume such observer knowledge in a theory of percep-
tion or perceptual intentionality is to assume that which needs to
be explained.
The last and most fundamental point is the distinction be-
tween the semantic and the causal relations that relate the input
and output signals, the distinction between the meaning and the
cause of an output signal. So far we have used a mind-to-world
direction-of-fit between the semantic relation and the causal
relation. That is the stance of perception, of learning about the
world. If we perceive a 1-received as a 1-sent (i.e., hypothesize a
certain causal antecedent) and then find out the signal was sent
over the invertor channel B, then we correct the misperception.
We change the hypothesized meaning of 1-received; we adjust
the mind to the world.
The opposite stance takes the direction-of-fit to be world-to-
mind. That is the stance of intentional action such as construct-
ing an artifact to fit a design. We now specify that by design a 1-
received (response: 0-received) shall mean a 1-sent (response: 0-
sent), and we construct the channel to fit. If we test it and find
that a 1 was received when a 0 was sent, then we change the
channel, not the meaning of 1-received.
Thus the meaning and the cause of receiving a signal are not
only distinct; they can stand in two different relations. A hypoth-

esized meaning of an output signal can be adjusted to fit its
cause, or the cause can be adjusted to fit a specified meaning. If
the meaning and cause of output signals were identical, then
dashboard lights could not malfunction. And the same holds for
robots.
Information is in the eye of the beholder

Diego, La Jolla, Calif. 92093
I see two problems with Sayre's application of information
theory (info(t)) to visual perception (and, by extension, to the
rest of cognition). The first is perhaps only a "technical" diffi-
culty, while the second is more fundamental.
The technical problem is this: How can the brain stages
described by Sayre in Sections 9.2-9.4 alter their operations in
order to "maintain a high degree of mutual information with
events at the Retina" (Section 9.3)? If transmitted or mutual
information is indeed simply the input entropy minus the
equivocation, how can the system or any of its stages apply
"mutual information measures" (Section 9.2)? How can the
system "know" (respond to) the entropy at input, even if it
somehow "knows" its own equivocation rate? At each moment
all it has access to is the pattern of transmitted events; it has no
way of knowing which of these are related to input and which are
noise. This problem is common to all theories that take the
philosophical position of perceptual realism, as Sayre's does;
Katz (1983) provides a further discussion of the logical difficul-
ties of realism as a theory of visual perception.
Sayre himself refers to this difficulty, and a possible solution,
when discussing the feasibility of a nonbiological system pos-
sessing intentional characteristics (Section 10). There he notes
that a computer system using info(t) in the way he describes
would have to calculate statistics on its own operations over
time, and in real time, "in a manner reflecting fluctuations in
the environment from which [the] data are derived." If the
mathematics that would permit information measures to be
derived from such computations have been worked out, I am not
aware of them. I suspect, however, that it might be possible for a
system, operating in this way, to calculate (respond to) the
relevant measures (properties) of info(t), given certain con-
straints on the input information or entropy and equivocation or
noise (H(A) and H(A/B), respectively). One such constraint
would surely be that H(A) reflects a stationary process, that is,
that its statistical properties do not change (or at least change
very slowly) over time. Markov processes may have this proper-
ty, and Sayre does describe his "Accumulator" (Section 9.2) as
responding to a "Markov source." But I do not think he fully
emphasizes the critical importance of the sequential properties
of stimulation. Sayre says that "the Accumulator can test for
repetition by applying mutual information measures over suc-
cessive members of the series [of Retinal patterns]." I doubt that
it is possible to calculate mutual information at all without
comparisons over time (and possibly not even then). This sug-
gests, in other words, that the temporal comparison must be the
primary process, and if info(t) measures are generated they can
only be generated by comparison of inputs over time. A
"snapshot" of the input cannot be used to calculate the amount
of information transmitted, because from a snapshot, the system
cannot know H(A). Sayre, on the other hand, seems to treat the
temporal comparison as a secondary, though important,
process.
There is, however, a more fundamental issue to be raised.
After rereading Sayre's target article several times I still do not
completely understand in what sense he is suggesting that the
nervous system uses info(t). On the one hand, the bulk of the
article (and especially his criticisms of David Marr, Section 9.1)
indicates that Sayre takes a mechanistic view: that is, to use his
own words, "neuronal mechanism[s] in the retina or optic tract
[operate] on visual data passing through it in such a manner as to
approximate the results of this or that mathematical transforma-
tion" (Section 9.1). On the other hand, some parts of the paper -
particularly phrases like "applying mutual information mea-
sures" (Section 9.2) - suggest instead the same sort of computa-
tional view for which Marr is criticized, a view in which parts of
the brain are thought actually to calculate "information mea-
sures." The fundamental point to be made here is that whether
one assumes a mechanistic model or a computational one,
"information" (info(t)) must be "observer-relative" (Searle
1980a), just as intentionality is in the case of the logical theorem
prover (Section 3).
Take, as a simple mechanistic model, a telegraph system. A
telegraph system transmitting Morse code may be described by
information theory, but the info(t) is a description that we, as
observers, apply to it; the telegraph responds to electrical
impulses, not to information (in any sense). The information -
info(t) or info(s) - is in the observer, not intrinsic to the system.
For an example of a computational system, consider a computer
running a routine to calculate information theory measures. The
machine may print out a number that the programmer can
validate, but the computations are purely forma] operations
(Fodor 1980). The programmer, not the computer, identifies
the output number with "information."
If info(t) is observer-relative, how can intentionality depend
on it? Is there some cosmic observer, imbuing us with divine
purpose? The answer may lie, not in our stars, but in reaffirming
the importance of unconscious processing in everyday behavior
(cf Dixon 1981). [See also Holender: "Semantic Activation
without Conscious Awareness" BBS 9(1) 1986.] To the extent
that consciousness can be described as self-observation (e.g.,
Skinner, 1974, Chap. 10), intentionality and semantic informa-
tion are terms properly applied to consciousness. [See special
issue on the work of B. F. Skinner, BBS 7(4) 1984. ] The meaning
we experience in our own behavior is indeed observer-relative,
but we are our own observers. Few would claim, however, that
they consciously compute anything as they behave, or that any
"info(t) measures" reside in consciousness. If information pro-
cessing of any sort occurs in the human brain it is (I would claim)
normally sub- or unconscious, and therefore without inten-
tionality or semantic content. In this view, accounts of inten-
tionality belong to the domain of consciousness (whatever that
is), a domain in which information theory can find no place.

On some specific models of intentional
behavior

Sayre properly emphasizes the importance of environmental
considerations, principled mathematics, and computer simula-
tion for understanding the problem of intentionality. On the
other hand, he places too much faith in communication and
information theory to the exclusion of other approaches to this
problem.
The mathematical theory of communication. Sayre introduces
the mathematical theory of communication (MTC) as a means
of exploring the set of relationships characterizing organism-
environmental interactions. This approach is certainly of great
interest and should result in new insights into the problem of
intentionality. To be sure, MTC is very useful for comparing

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
and contrasting broad classes of different types of relatively
simple communication system models. Still, before any cal-
culations using MTC can be made, a particular probabilistic
model of the relationships between (and within) the organism
and its environment is required. Sayre characterizes this mod-
elling problem as finding the correspondence between info(t)
and info(s). He further suggests that with some knowledge of
evolutionary neurobiology and psychology in conjunction with
certain relationships existing between info(t) and energy it
should be possible to identify the relationship between info(t)
and info(s). I do not believe that the solution to the problem of
intentionality will be this simple.
Before MTC can be applied, one must first grapple with the
practical problem of defining the concept of an "event," because
MTC is based on the assignment of probabilities to specific
events. Exactly what is a psychological event, and what is a
relevant neurophysiological event? Second, one must identify
the nature of the communication channels of interest. If these
channels interact, what probabilistic laws should be assumed to
capture that interaction? Is the channel output at time t a
function of only the channel input at time t and not a function of
the channel input at the set of times preceding t (i.e., is the
channel memoryless)? And, if so, what probabilistic laws are
required to characterize this time-variant system behavior?
Sayre suggests that "it should be possible to conjecture reasona-
bly about the types of info(t) processing that might occur at the
major junctions." Where are these major junctions? How are
they assumed to interact? These questions must be answered
before any calculations can take place. Sayre's discussion of how
MTC might be applied to the visual system does not address
these issues. He does not explicitly motivate why the visual
system can be broken up into roughly four serial processing
stages (i.e., the Retina, Accumulator, Discriminator, and Ab-
stractor stages), what communication channels link these stages,
or even what types of information may flow through these
channels.
Moreover, even if the required probabilistic laws were spec-
ified, the types of statements that can be made by MTC are
rather narrow and limited in scope. For example, although
MTC is quite useful for making general statements about broad
classes of communication system models (e.g., specific bounds
on the system's error rate), it is doubtful that such a theory
would be useful for making more detailed predictions (e.g.,
reaction times). The point is that although MTC is certainly a
useful tool that has not really been fully exploited, other ap-
proaches are required in the formulation of psychological theo-
ries of perception and cognition.
Some additional useful formalisms. Some mathematical tools,
similar in spirit to MTC, are now offered as possible candidates
for exploring some of the issues discussed by Sayre. A mathe-
matical framework that seems to be of exceptional utility is
linear algebra (Luenberger 1979). Using this formalism, specific
patterns of neural events are represented by lists of numbers
called state vectors. A given state vector, therefore, has a unique
correspondence with a specific pattern of neural events (for
additional details, see Anderson & Mozer, 1981). Such a frame-
work nicely captures Sayre's suggestion that "patterns" of neu-
ronal events are "representations of salient features of the
objective environment."
Sayre also suggests that the basis of visual perception is a
matching process between a specific neural pattern of activity
and a set of objective events in the world. The similarity
measure that this matching process is based upon is given
explicitly by the mutual information between some specific set
of objective events in the world and a specific cortical represen-
tation. More formally, the computational problem the organism
must solve is to find that cortical representation that maximizes
the mutual information between that representation and that set
of objective events in the world. Although this approach may
certainly be a useful one, considering our current lack of knowl-
edge, a more general formulation of the problem seems reason-
able. In particular, suppose the computational problem the
organism must solve is to find the cortical representation that is
most probable, given some observed set of objective events in
the world (i.e., a partially specified cortical representation).
This type of problem is referred to as maximizing the a posteri-
ori probability density function (MAP estimation) in the en-
gineering literature. The main advantage of reformulating the
problem in this manner is that a certain amount of generality is
immediately obtained. The basic difficulty with this approach,
however, is that the density function must be identified before it
can be maximized. The relatively new theory of Markov random
fields (Besag 1974) seems very promising as a means of obtaining
useful general forms of such density functions. Assuming now
that a general form of the density function is obtained, its
parameters can be estimated, following Sayre, based upon
knowledge of the effects of evolutionary pressures and past
individual experiences upon the organism.
For example, consider the set of state vectors whose elements
(representing individual neural events) are binary-valued (true,
false) random variables; assume that the organism is capable of
detecting only "pair-wise" neural feature correlations. In-
terestingly enough, in this special case, the resulting form of the
above probability density function is intimately connected with
thermodynamic concepts of both energy and entropy. The
above restrictions upon the class of probability density functions
is of even greater interest when one realizes that a number of
investigators (Ackley, Hinton & Sejnowski 1985; Anderson,
Silverstein, Ritz & Jones 1977; Hopfield 1982) have constructed
some simple algorithms (amenable to neurophysiological in-
terpretation) that maximize this specific probability density
function. That is, these neural network models are provided
with a subset of known state vector element values and effective-
ly generate the most probable configuration of element values
for the unknown state vector elements. It is important to note
that although each of these models is identical at the computa-
tional level (to use Marr's 1982 terminology), they are different
in terms of their behavior at the algorithmic level. That is, each
network model possesses a unique neurophysiological in-
terpretation and a set of unique practical and theoretical difficul-
ties in carrying out the necessary maximization.
Computers and intentionality. Sayre argues that "there is no
purely formal system - automated or otherwise - that is endow-
ed with semantic features independent of interpretation." Since
computers are formal systems, to continue the argument, com-
puter simulations of cognition cannot exhibit "intentional" be-
havior. Sayre, however, does not consider the possibility of
modelling both the organism and its environment on a
computer.
If an organism and its environment are modelled on a comput-
er, then the simulation model of the organism might be said to
exhibit intentional behavior with respect to its model environ-
ment. One argument against this approach might be that model-
ling both organism and environment unnecessarily complicates
matters. I see no other possibility, however, because I am
sympathetic with Sayre's view that intentionality (and meaning)
can exist only with respect to an organism functioning within an
environment. Moreover, note that this solution may become
more tractable when one realizes that the purpose of a model is
to serve as a useful abstraction of a fairly complex situation.
Thus, only those aspects of the environment and organism that
are relevant to the psychological modelling problem of interest
need be considered.
In summary, I commend Sayre for seriously considering
formalisms other than those based upon symbol manipulation,
but I suggest an even more eclectic approach to the problem of
intentionality. MTC, like any other approach, is not sufficiently
strong by itself to provide a foundation for cognitive science.
The foundations of cognitive science will eventually emerge
themselves, if we give them some time.

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
Uncertainty about information
Ian E. Gordon
Department of Psychology, University of Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QG, England
Sayre's interesting attempt to relate two types of information
does not convince. Imagine the following real-life situation: One
is on a hillside when the mist suddenly clears. Ahead is a snow-
capped mountain, not quite where it was expected to be;
nevertheless it is clearly visible.
The question arises as to the informational aspects of this
experience. In terms of the formal information-theoretic cal-
culus (info(t)), what was the prior uncertainty associated with the
mountain as a stimulus object? Several million rays are entering
the eye before and during the first glimpse of the stimulus
object. But is one's uncertainty comparably great? And should
calculations include the admitted uncertainty over the moun-
tain's position, say to the nearest degree? If there are no rules for
applying the informational calculus at this stage, how does one
quantify the stimulus array? Analysis of a picture of the scene in
terms of pixels or similar units won't do because one was seeing
something before the mountain appeared: It is not that the
information in the scene has suddenly increased, it has simply
changed. As Sayre is aware, a neutral measure such as info(t)
does not capture the nature of this qualitative change.
The situation becomes more complex when a companion
points out that one slope of the mountain looks like a human
face. After a few moments one suddenly sees that this is correct.
What was one's uncertainty before and after seeing the face? Is it
to be calculated on the basis of all faces previously experienced,
or only faces formed from rock and snow?
When we consider the causal chain between light from the
object reaching the retina and the eventual formation of a
percept, the application of information theory has some attrac-
tion. Barlow (1985) illustrates the usefulness of this approach in
his speculations concerning the relationship between the
number of neurons involved at different stages in vision and the
proportions of active to inactive cells at each stage. But this is a
quantitative exercise; in Barlow's terms it represents an "infor-
mational balance sheet." Even here, however, information is
calculated in terms of likelihoods of neural firing, infrequent
events being assumed to carry more information. There is no
discussion of how a neurone waiting to receive impulses from
earlier ones in a chain can be said to manifest uncertainty. What
would this mean?
When Sayre suggests that representations at his third stage of
visual perception have no orderly spatial characteristics and that
they function with respect to info(t) features "preserved through
the many channels beginning with the perceptual object," I find
it impossible to conceive how such a scheme would actually
deliver the goods.
Intentionality and the explanation of
behavior
John Heil
Department of Philosophy, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond,
Va. 23284
Sayre believes that we lack at present an account of inten-
tionality of the sort required if we are to understand the behav-
ior of "cognitive organisms." What is needed, he suggests, is a
straightforward description of the mechanism of intentionality,
one that locates intentional content where it belongs: inside the
organism. The latter point is important for Sayre. The computa-
tional paradigm now dominant in cognitive science precisely
fails to do this. It is not that the internal states of a computing
machine lack intentional or semantic properties. The difficulty,
rather, is that they possess these properties, to the extent that
they do, only derivatively: "None of the representations inter-
nal to the machine has meaning, or truth, or external reference,
just in and by itself. . . Of intrinsic intentional proper-
ties . . . these representations are entirely innocent." This,
according to Sayre, is because "the intentionality attaching to
machine representations is not 'intrinsic' but 'observer-rela-
tive,' being entirely dependent upon the 'intrinsic' intentions of
the programmer. " Hence if our aim is to explain intentionality in
a way that will prove useful in explanations of behavior, an
appeal to the internal states of computing machines will be of no
help at all. Computing machines possess intentionality only by
courtesy.
What might it be for something to have intentional properties
intrinsically? Inscriptions on blackboards and in journals clearly
do not. The semantic content of such things is bestowed on them
by inscribers. Human thoughts, however, seem different. The
content of my thought that "p" does not, in any obvious way,
depend on my or anyone else assigning it that content. In this
sense, its intentionality is intrinsic to it. Putting the point this
way, however, may be misleading. If one supposes that an
intrinsic property is, whatever else it is, nonrelational (in the
sense that its possession by some particular does not depend on
some other particular), then it is an open question whether
anything at all intrinsically possesses intentionality (see, e.g.,
Heil, 1981). Although Sayre's discussion may lead one to sup-
pose that he has something like this in mind, the account he
offers makes it clear that he means only to exclude cases in which
a thing's intentional properties are parasitic on the intentional
properties of something else. The intrinsic intentionality of
neural configurations, for instance, does not arise, in his view,
just from features of those configurations "in and of them-
selves," but from a certain relation of neural to external
configurations.
Very roughly, the idea is this. We decide on the semantic
content of the states of an ordinary computing machine by
providing interpretations of its symbolic input and output.
Were such a machine linked, however, via appropriate "trans-
ducers" directly to the world, the content of its internal states
might more plausibly be regarded as intrinsic. In Searle's
(1980a) Chinese-room example, the content of inscriptions pass-
ing through the system is said to be dependent on the inten-
tionality of those outside the room for whom the inscriptions
have meaning. Now imagine a similar room that provides inputs
from the outside world without the mediation of intentional
agents. The room is equipped with a transducer, perhaps, that
converts incoming patterns of energy into inscriptions that are
then manipulated as in the original case and, once processed,
determine symbolic and behavioral outputs. Sticking to some-
thing approximating vision, we may suppose that the transfucer
in question consists of a television camera that produces not
images on a screen but arrays of Chinese characters describing
incoming scenes. Behavioral outputs might then include, in
addition to further Chinese characters, camera adjustments and
the like.
Is a story of this sort a story about intentionality? If the original
Chinese room contained no intrinsic intentionality then I think
this one does not either; not, however, because we have imag-
ined the room as containing Chinese symbols, hence symbols
whose intentionality is derivative. One may substitute any
system or code one pleases, and the point remains. If I am in the
room manipulating items that have certain external origins and
certain "behavioral" effects, I do so without any inkling what-
ever of their semantic content. The latter plays no role at all in
my operation or the room's.
One may be inclined to describe the system - the room,
together with its operator and associated transducer - as intrin-
sically possessing intentionality. There is something to this
suggestion. However, a crucial point emerges: The system
(describable now as one with something approximating non-
derivative intentionality) does not make any use whatever of the
semantic content of its internal symbols. These play no discern-
ible role in its operation. (If one is bothered by the fact that the
envisaged system is "programmed" by cognitive organisms,
146
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
then one may imagine an identical device resulting from a
cosmic accident. Here there can be no question of parasitic
intentionality.)
Cases of this sort suggest, I think, that the prospects of finding
a mechanism of intentionality inside intelligent creatures are
not encouraging. If it is right to regard intentional states as
supervening on ordinary physical states then we will be obliged
to say that their "supervenience base" (Kim 1982; Heil 1983)
includes more than the current internal features of the creatures
possessing those states. It includes, in addition, a hetero-
geneous assortment of goings on - biological, environmental,
historical, and social - external to such creatures. And it is
difficult to see how such things could figure in the sorts of
behavioral explanation that Sayre is after.
Sayre's attempt to explicate intentionality in terms of the
identity of "info(t) structures" raises other questions as well.
Semantic content is thought to emerge when the info(t) of a
certain neural structure, C, is identical to the info(t) of some
structure in the world, O. When C serves to adjust behavior in a
particular way toward O the info(t) at C is converted into info(s)
and perceptual intentionality is born. Consider a pair of difficul-
ties that any such account might face.
First, the lack of a causal component is especially troubling.
MTC (mathematical theory of communication), as Sayre de-
scribes it, does not require causal links between a pair of
structures for one to bear info(t) about the other. Without some
such link, however, it is difficult to see how Sayre's attempt to
derive semantic content from info(t) structures can avoid famil-
iar Twin Earth sorts of counterexample. Smith, an Earthling, is
looking at a banana. On Twin Earth, Smith's Doppelganger,
Smythe, is undergoing identical neural transformations. Does
Smythe see Smith's banana? And if not, why not? Sayre might
wish to reply that Smythe's behavior is not directed on the
appropriate object, namely, the banana confronted by Smith. It
is not merely the identity of info(t) structures that is required for
the emergence of info(s), semantic content, but behavior di-
rected toward external objects as well. It is this that is missing in
the case of Smythe. Such a response, however, misses the
difficulty, for in such cases what determines the appropriate
object? The object on which behavior is directed must be
identical to the object represented in the relevant intentional
state. And there seems to be no independent way of ascertaining
which object is that object. Indeed, this is the problem of
intentionaiity (in one of its many guises).
Second, Sayre's account of info(s) and the emergence of
semantic content from contentless info(t) raises the question
posed earlier: Why should it matter? The system as described by
Sayre seems only to react to and operate on info(t) structures.
When these satisfy certain conditions, they may be described as
having a particular semantic content. This is not something that
plays any obvious role in the operation of the system, however,
at least not if Sayre's discussion is on the right track. (Nor, for all
that, does it seem to matter that certain of its neural configura-
tions happen to be info(t) structures. What matters is just that
they have certain neurophysiological properties.)
The point is not that intentionality - mental content - has no
role to play in the explanation of behavior, only that Sayre's
account, despite its focus on intentional substrata, provides it
with no such role. Not only does that account fall short of its
espoused goal - that of providing a characterization of the
mechanism of intentionality - it undermines as well one impor-
tant motivation for such a characterization.
Information, causality, and intentionality
David Kelley
Cognitive Science Program, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 12601
Sayre uses information theory to construct a very suggestive
hypothesis that does, as he argues, provide an alternative to the
computational approach and would help put theories of cogni-
tion into a wider biological context. If neuroscientists confirm
his hypothesis by finding actual cortical events and patterns that
have the info(t) structures he describes, the result might well be
a comprehensive theory of how the nervous system gives rise to
intentional states. But Sayre makes a stronger claim: "The
relationship of intentionality is quite literally is a relationship of
high mutual information between a set of objective circum-
stances and a representation in the cortex." And this identity
claim runs into a classic problem that arises for causal theories of
perception.
In the case of perception, a theory of intentionality must
explain the relationship between the percept and its intentional
object - for example, the yellow sheet of paper I am seeing at
present. A causal theory, in its crudest form, identifies the
intentional with the causal relationship between percept and
object. The fact that the sheet of paper is the object of my
perception and the fact that the paper caused my experience of it
are the same fact. The problem is that the paper is only one stage
in a causal sequence leading to the perceptual experience. The
other stages - events in the medium of light transmission, in the
retina, in the lateral geniculate nucleus - might equally well be
described as causes of the percept, yet none of them is an
intentional object. I do not see any of them. So causality per se is
not sufficient for intentionality.
To avoid this problem, causal theorists have imposed further
conditions on the causal relation, conditions that will pick out
the physical object and exclude the other stages in the causal
sequence. Sayre specifies those conditions in terms of informa-
tion theory. There must be an identity in info(t) structure
between the set C of cortical events and the set O of "object-
centered" events responsible for the reflection of light. But this
identity in structure is established through the identity each has
with a third, intermediary set (R) of events at the retina. "In
brief, if both channels O-R and R-C are characterized by high
mutual information, then so is the combined channel O-C"
Then why is the structure at O the intentional content of the
cortical events, while the structure at R is not?
The problem here is not avoided by the further conditions
that Sayre says must be satisfied before a relationship of high
mutual information can constitute a relationship of inten-
tionality. (1) The perceptual process must "lock on to" and
"track" the structures in the objective environment. But pre-
sumably it does so by locking on to and tracking the retinal
events that carry information about those external structures.
(2). The relationship of mutual information between O and C
must be maintained by adaptive procedures, making use of a
variable coding format. But once again, the same adaptive
procedures are presumably used to maintain the mutual infor-
mation relation between R and C as well. Finally, (3) the info(t)
coupling between O and C must make a practical difference to
the organism, but of course whenever that is true it will also be
true that the coupling between R and C will also make a practical
difference.
In short, Sayre does not explain why it is the external object,
not the retina or the optic array, that we perceive. The web of
relationships he posits may well turn out to play an important
role in explaining the genesis of intentional states, but so far as I
can see they do not constitute intentionality.

Inference rules + memory

Sayre has proposed an interesting way of looking at how infor-
mation is transformed through the stages of an understanding
system. As Dennett (1983) and others have pointed out, it is

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
often useful to look at problems using a number of diiferent
levels of abstraction, and the one selected by Sayre should be
valuable in examining certain aspects of cognition. However, I
must disagree with his appraisal of symbolic computer models as
having no real semantic content and of "computations on inter-
nal representations" as unable to exhibit intentionality.
As Sayre quite accurately points out, the existence of a
program that transforms input (a scene or natural language,
perhaps) into internal symbols - for example, the phrase "a cat"
into the symbol, "CAT" - does not automatically imply seman-
tic significance for the representation. However, symbolic rep-
resentations in artificial intelligence (AI) systems are more than
just isolated symbols. They are, first and foremost, bundles of
inference rules. The symbol "CAT' might refer to the facts that
such entities walk on four feet, like milk, are mortal Sayre's
example), and dozens or hundreds of other rules. While small
examples make it seem as if this is a trivial aspect of a system, the
rich, interrelated rules in a knowledge base are indeed the
semantic core of symbolic information. We must not be con-
fused by the fact that a few simple rules in a system (or even the
knowledge bases in existing AI programs) clearly do not exhibit
the kinds of complex behavior of biological systems. There has
been no reason yet put forth to make us believe that complex
sets of symbolic rules cannot encompass all aspects of under-
standing. Results to date would indeed lead one to believe the
opposite.
Conceptual dependency (CD), developed by Schank (1972),
is a good example of the true essence of a semantic representa-
tion. Consider a simple action such as "John gave Mary a book."
This action is represented in CD as:
to
object 
â > *MARY*
*JOHN* < = > ATRANS < 
*BOOK*
----< *JOHN*
from
This representation includes some elements that are signifi-
cant semantically and some that are not. Specifically, since CD
was more concerned with representing actions than objects, the
representations of John, Mary, and the book as *JOHN*,
â¢MARY*, and *BOOK*, respectively, have essentially no se-
mantic content - the asterisks simply indicate that a conceptual
representation is needed. ATRANS, a language-independent
primitive that stands for abstract transfer of control, is another
story. This is not the case simply because we use a symbol other
than those in the sample sentence, but rather because the
definition of ATRANS includes a number of inference rules
about transfer of control. For example, a system might have a
rule that the filler of the TO slot of an ATRANS now possesses
the filler of the OBJECT slot, another that the ACTOR of the
ATRANS wanted the filler of the TO slot to have the OBJECT,
and so forth. To the extent that these rules completely describe
the effect of ATRANS in the world, the system has semantic
information about the action.
AI researchers have sometimes confused the issue of what
carries semantic content by using seemingly significant names
for concepts (such as the "IS-A link" used in semantic networks
to represent class membership and allow inheritance of informa-
tion). As was pointed out by McDermott (1981), the only
semantic significance of representations lies with the rules that
they entail. However, these rules do constitute semantically
meaningful information. We can, as McDermott points out, test
the computer implementations of systems by replacing all the
"wishful mnemonics" with arbitrary symbols and convincing
ourselves (and others) that the system exhibits aspects of
understanding.
Recent AI theories and computer systems have added an-
other key component to the semantic meaningfulness of sym-
bolic representations - long-term memory. Programs such as
IPP(Lebowitz 1980; Lebowitz 1983a), CYRUS (Kolodner 1984),
and RESEARCHER (Lebowitz 1983b) take streams of input
(news articles in the cases of IPP and CYRUS and patent
abstracts for RESEARCHER), determine the conceptual con-
tent of the input, and add it to a long-term memory. The
updating of memory involves comparison with earlier examples
for the purpose of generalization. Such systems provide a clear
connection between representations and the outside world.
If we gave RESEARCHER (or perhaps a much more ad-
vanced version of it) rich enough input about cats instead of disk
drives (its current domain), it would build up descriptions of
various kinds of felines. It would notice how the simplest
(primitive) elements of the various representations relate to
each other and would develop higher level concepts. The
generalized concepts could then serve as the basis for later
understanding - in effect, the rules of understanding in a system
of this sort can change in response to inputs received. The
dynamic nature of systems that build up memories from their
input embodies the programs with another important element
of semantic representation.
Having briefly looked at the role of inference rules and
dynamic memory in symbolic representations, we can consider
the relation of such representations to intentionality. Searle, in
describing intentional states, requires that they "be satisfied or
not satisfied depending on whether representative content
actually matches or represents anything in reality" (1980c, p.
48). This important element of intentionality can easily be
captured by symbolic models. Their rules of inference can be
applied to their world (further input) and used to judge the
satisfiability of a given representation. The connection of repre-
sentations to a permanent memory forces such intentionality to
be more than isolated symbol pushing.
We can, it would seem, safely conclude that symbolic repre-
sentations do capture a meaningful part of semantic meaning â
as long as we include attached inference rules and the ability for
these rules to be dynamically changed in response to input.
"CAT" in such systems is not just a meaningless symbol, it is a
semantically significant bundle of rules and memories. By look-
ing at systems' abilities to interpret input, predict the conse-
quences of input, and relate new input to old memories, we can
see all the elements of intentional states. The only way to deny
the intentionality of such symbolic representations is to declare
that the input given to computer systems is somehow less a part
of "reality" than that received by biological organisms. And
there would seem to be no valid reason to do that.

The relationship between information theory,
statistical mechanics, evolutionary theory,
and cognitive Science
Michael Leyton

Sayre's target article puts together a particular relationship
between ideas in at least the four following areas: (1) information
theory, (2) statistical mechanics, (3) evolutionary theory, and (4)
perceptual processing. I will argue that the particular rela-
tionship he puts together is incorrect on both logical and em-
pirical grounds. I will do this by developing a different rela-
tionship between the above areas and showing that this
alternative is logically more consistent and empirically better
supported.
(1) Negentropy and energy flow. After describing his percep-
tual system, Sayre claims that "because of the high level of
I(O;C) sustained by the perceptual process, the perceiving

Intentionality and information processing
organism enjoys the benefits of a highly efficient negentropic
coupling." However, the concept of negentropic coupling is a
highly technical one in nonequilibrium (i.e., irreversible) ther-
modynamics, and Sayre has not substantiated his mention of it.
Briefly, the relationship of negentropic coupling to living sys-
tems is as follows: In order to prevent the decay of a living
system to equilibrium, work has to be performed. However,
because work cannot be performed by an isolated system, a
crucial requirement is that the living system be an intermediate
one between an energy source and an energy sink. The required
work is then accomplished as a result of the energy flow from
source to sink through the living system. That is, energy flow,
not energy itself, is crucial to negentropic coupling. Sayre does
not mention energy flow in describing his perceptual system.
(2) Ecology and the second law of thermodynamics. There is in
fact an important direct relationship between energy flow and
negentropic flexibility. Elton (1927) discovered that an orga-
nism that is higher on a food chain is rarer and has more food
chains converging on it, thus making it more flexible. The classic
paper by Lindeman (1942) provided the following analysis of
these phenomena: A fixed amount of energy enters the eco-
system from the sun via photosynthesis. As it is passed up
successive ecological levels, each transfer across levels, via
feeding, must be less than 100% efficient (in accordance with the
second law of thermodynamics). That is, some energy must be
degraded into a lower potential state such as heat. Thus there is
less and less useful energy available at each successive level.
This forces animals on higher trophic levels to be fewer and
more versatile. The above argument therefore provides the
relationship between negentropic flexibility and the ther-
modynamics of energy flow that is missing from Sayre's article.
(3) The principle of requisite variety. I do agree with Sayre,
however, that Shannon's 10th theorem is an important factor
bridging ecological flexibility and the demands on the cognitive
system. Neither Sayre nor I, however, is at all original in
believing this. We are predated by at least thirty years in a
famous argument by Ashby (1956), who proved a principle,
called the Principle of Requisite Variety, related to Shannon's
theorem. However, where I think Sayre is wrong can be ex-
pressed in the following argument by Ashby: Flexibility neces-
sarily demands vulnerability to external disturbances, in a way
that nonflexibility (e.g., in the form of a hard shell) does not.
One consequence of this is that the organism cannot simply wait
for disturbances. It must actively seek environmental informa-
tion for the general purpose of providing a continual description
of the environment. Such information I will call nonspecific.
The factor of higher nonspecific information is a major one that
seems to violate Sayre's proposal, as follows:
(4) High-level nonspecific 
Information-seeking. 
Although
Sayre is vague on this point, I have a strong sense, from several
aspects of his description of the "perceptual-behavioral" loop,
that perception in his system acts in the service of immediate
ongoing manipulative tasks. For example, (1) he claims that
higher perception "locks onto" or "focuses on" specific objects
in the behavioral loop; and (2) he claims that cortical representa-
tions retain "just those info(t) structures that are important for
the guidance of the organism's current behavior." There is
considerable evidence, however, that flexible biological orga-
nisms seek information purely for the latter's complexity and
novelty, rather than for extrinsic utility. Furthermore, non-
specific information-seeking cannot be consigned to a low level
of the perceptual system, as in Sayre's view. For example, three
types of higher information-seeking phenomena would seem to
cause problems for his view:
(A) Sensory deprivation. A man sitting in solitary confinement
does not require the accomplishment of any tasks; for example,
food and protection is provided without work. Nevertheless he
does report seeing the environment. According to Sayre's view,
that high-level perception retains only information relevant to
specific tasks, he would not see anything.
(B) Information seeking during goal accomplishment: Several
studies show that animals prefer an indirect route rather than a
direct route to a goal if the indirect route is perceptually more
complex (e.g., Krechevsky 1937). In Sayre's system, in which
nontask-oriented information is rejected at higher levels, this
presumably should not happen.
(C) Behavior for perceptual goals. Several studies show that
animals learn to perform tasks in which a neutral percept is the
only reward (e.g., Kish 1955). These studies actually reverse
what Sayre calls the perceptual-behavioral loop in that the
organism behaves in the service of perceiving, rather than
perceiving in the service of behaving.
Furthermore, one could not solve these problems by claiming
that information seeking is just one of those tasks that Sayre's
perceptual system attempts to facilitate, for this would lead to
two irreconcilable demands: (1) According to Sayre, the goal of
high-level perception is to stabilize info(t) structures with re-
spect to current function; and (2) the function of high-level
information seeking is the destabilization of info(t) structures.
In summary, then, the successive stages of my argument have
been: (1) It is energy flow that allows negentropic coupling; (2)
thermodynamic constraints on energy flow drive higher orga-
nisms to flexibility; (3) Ashby's principle forces flexible orga-
nisms to seek high-level nonspecific information; (4) high-level
nonspecific information is incompatible with Sayre's proposals.
Intrinsic versus contrived intentionality
Donald M. MacKay
Department of Communication and Neuroscience, University of Keele,
Staffs. ST5 5BG, England
The impasse from which Dr. Sayre wants to rescue cognitive
science results, I think, from the established practice in artificial
intelligence of taking a nonbiological approach to the internal
representation of the external world, using intrinsically mean-
ingless symbols. I have long argued (MacKay 1951; 1962) that
the key to intrinsically intentional representation is to start by
thinking of the artificial system as primarily a goal-pursuing,
norm-guided, evaluative agent, as we do a biological system.
The environment or field of action can then be thought of as that
which sets constraints (both positive and negative) on the plan-
ning and organization of goal-directed action, which needs to be
represented internally by a matching set of constraints. What is
required is not just that the system should interact freely with its
environment but specifically that it should probe its world in
order to develop a matching state of conditional readiness to
reckon with the cognizable features of that world (MacKay 1956:
1962; 1978; 1981). The crucial ingredient in cognitive agency is
evaluation, computation of the extent to which and the respects
in which the current state of affairs matches or mismatches
current goal-criteria or the current state of conditional read-
iness. Feedback from evaluation drives the agent to seek ac-
tively to maximize "match" or minimize "mismatch."
In a system functioning according to this principle, feeling its
way into developing an internal structure of statistical con-
straints to match those imposed by specific features of its world,
the internal structure naturally functions as an intentional rep-
resentation of those features (MacKay 1956). It is not a represen-
tation in the sense of an array of arbitrary tokens that require a
semantic interpreter to discern their meaning. It is constructed
of elements with a nonarbitrary meaning, which function di-
rectly at the interpretive level. It embodies implicitly some-
thing the agent "knows" about its world, in that setting it up
means ipso facto setting up the relevant implications of the
information it represents where they are needed.
A simple (and ancient) illustration may clarify the point
(MacKay 1963). In a car designed to use feedback or feedforward
from a sense-organ to adapt the setting of its steering wheels
automatically to the curvature of a semicircular drive with the
goal of avoiding collisions with the walls, the steering angle of
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1
149

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
the wheels becomes an implicit representation of the curvature.
It is not a scale model of the drive nor a linguistic description of
it, but it embodies implicitly what the system needs to know
about its shape, with respect to the goal of drive-following. No
further step of interpretation is needed to discern its meaning
for the goal-pursuing system. By the same token, perception of a
change in drive curvature would be represented by the updat-
ing of the steering angle in matching response to sensory signals,
whether of feedback or feedforward. As such, perception would
be qualitatively distinguishable from the reception and analysis
of sensory signals that led up to it. Perception of an abstract
feature of the shape of the drive (say, a regular alternation of left
and right turns) would require the development of appropriate
subroutines to set up a matching conditional readiness to turn
left after turning right and vice versa (MacKay 1956). On this
basis perception would be intentional, in a sense in which
sensory signal-analysis per se is not.
In this context, I am afraid I do not see Sayre's invocation of
(Shannon's) information theory as adding anything helpfully
new. His assertion that the joint capacity Cs of two channels
with capacities C1 and C2 can be increased by making their
inputs interactive depends on an unexplained assumption. Why
should the equivalent number of equiprobable alterna-
tives 2C for the joint output be the sum of those for each
channel 2C' + 2C2, rather than their product 2C' x 2C2? Does
Sayre have in mind some special kind of interaction that would
justify this step in the argument? If so, he should specify it more
explicitly, and qualify his conclusion accordingly. Introducing
redundancy by allowing two input signals to interact would
normally be expected to reduce rather than increase overall
rates of information transfer, though it could of course be used to
increase reliability.
What Sayre calls "info(t)" means simply "unexpectedness." It
seems incoherent to talk of this as becoming info(s), because the
semantic concept of information itself (that which determines
form) is in quite a different category (MacKay 1969). (Inciden-
tally, what I did in 1969 and earlier was to show how Shannon's
theory of unexpectedness could be grafted on to a theory of
meaningful communication, and not vice versa as Sayre suggests
in Section 4, paragraph 3!) Sayre's central emphasis on "con-
straints from a demanding environment" is generally in line
with what I proposed in 1956; but it is not obvious (to me at least)
that taking Shannon's "mutual information" as a measure of the
coherence between a set of objective circumstances and their
cortical representation throws additional light on the basic
philosophical problem Sayre is addressing.
Cognitive science and the pragmatics of
behavior

How much should we expect a theory of mind and behavior to
explain? Consider the following relatively simple and certainly
commonplace event. A man is dressing. His immediate task is to
select a necktie appropriate in color, material, and pattern to
complement his brown gabardine suit. What does an adequate
psychological theory need to account for in the way of the mental
and behavioral processes that ensue? More to the point, how
much of this explication can cognitive science (CS) hope to
accomplish?
CS functions at its best in providing a computational account
of the processes that underlie the man's search procedure: He
scans the rack of ties (serially); one tie after another he compares
both indirectly to a mental prototype of the tie he "desires" and
directly to the brown jacket already donned. Yet, as Sayre
implicitly argues, is there not much more going on? The con-
straints on the man's behavior - or, to put it more accurately,
the constraints on theories to explain the man's behavior - far
transcend, it seems to me, what CS can hope to supply; indeed,
the constraints transcend, I suspect, even CS plus the semantic
content that Sayre offers as a supplement.
Let us ask, what are the factors that shape choices of colors
(leaving out from consideration pattern, material, etc.)? In part,
cultural conventions and personal experiences may combine to
dictate the range from which the man will choose a suitable
color. But some of the constraint in color preference undoubted-
ly arises from visual biology - from the peripheral, receptor-cell
kinetics and subsequent centra] opponent-process mechanisms
of color vision. Such biological constraint makes an orange hue
more similar to a slightly yellowish red than to a good yellow,
despite the greater physical difference between the dominant
wavelengths (or wavenumbers) corresponding to the orange and
yellowish red.
But the biological underpinnings to the man's behavior go far
deeper than the visual physiology of color. For it is clear that the
cognitive processes underlying the man's search for sartorial
appropriateness are neither ends in themselves nor processes
geared to mediate visual preference; rather, these processes
subserve a wide range of activities - many of which can be
characterized as being in the broad sense adaptative. If the
search for a necktie were to precede an important business
meeting, the choice of a particular color might play a modest but
perhaps not insignificant role in an outcome deeply desired. It
takes no great leap of imagination to construe the selection of a
necktie as one small piece of behavior nested within a hier-
archical organization of activities with clear purpose, value, and
biological function - and I mean here biological not just in the
narrow sense of satisfying a short-term physical need but in the
broader, Darwinian sense. Behaviors as (relatively) minor as
selecting a necktie have their niche, play their adaptative role.
More to the point, the underlying cognitive mechanisms - those
mechanisms that CS aims to describe - themselves presumably
evolved as the result of adaptative pressures. If, as Sayre argues,
CS is a theory of the syntactics of mind, lacking a semantics, it
also lacks a pragmatics, an account of mind's functional proper-
ties (encompassing the intentional ones), as these may be
viewed from a broad biological perspective.
Actually, I should clarify my example: The man I have in mind
is not preparing for a business meeting, but rather for dinner
with a woman to whom he is strongly attracted. The tie he finally
chooses has a deep red color that might not be predicted either
on the basis of cultural conventions or from an analysis of visual
mechanisms. Nor is the man aware of any reason underlying his
choice, for he has long forgotten - Freud would say, repressed -
the memory of a time when he was four or so years old; in those
days, his father often wore a necktie of precisely the same color,
and in fact had been wearing it early one particular evening a
short time before the boy had entered his parents'
bedroom. . . .
A total process approach to perception

Sayre has taken seriously the need to explore the technical
nature of the transitions from the quantity of information with
which a system deals to the semantic content of that informa-
tion. Although I think that he has fallen short of clarifying how
nonbiological systems can qualify as intentional systems, Sayre's
work suggests some rather more important and interesting
considerations.
Sayre claims that intentionality arises from the identity of
info(t) structures of retinal events with corresponding structures
in the objective environment. â¢ Unfortunately, Sayre tells us
150
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
more about what he doesn't mean by "identity" than what he
does mean by it. He retreats to a use of identity as "of a sort akin
to the identity of mathematics," which tells us little. He then
states that a system does not necessarily have to be biological to
manifest these characteristics.
Although Sayre distinguishes his theory from Dret-
ske's(1981), it is not clear how his work escapes the criticisms
leveled at Dretske's work, for example, by Churchland and
Churchland (1983). Moreover, Sayre does not explain how these
relations of identity with their functional applications provide us
with a view of info(s) that is more acceptable than the ones
provided by variations of the robot reply discussed by Searle
(1980a, p. 420). Why is Sayre's model not merely reflecting a
greater level of mechanical complexity - a difference in degree
rather than kind?
Can Sayre, or anyone, give us the answer to the question of
whether nonbiological entities can be intentional and have
info(s)? As the debate stands, we must suspect that there is
something misconceived in the enterprise. Regardless of the
complexity of robot behaviors proposed, an objection can always
be raised: "I know that you describe the system in question as
doing X, Y, and Z, but is it really intentional?" Herein lies the
questionable strength of the list of disabilities proposed by
Turing (1950). Thus I conclude that Sayre has not achieved his
main goal - but I am not sure that the goal is achievable as
approached at present.
Sayre's more important contributions arise from the implica-
tions of his application of MTC (mathematical theory of commu-
nication) to studies of the human cognitive system. What we
may need is his basic approach, but done with a much broader
and more adventurous hand. Sayre has still not quite explained
the move from info(t) to info(s) given a biological system. Let me
offer what might be the next step. Following Sayre's lead, and
claiming the same caveats in which Sayre wraps himself, I will
center the discussion on biological systems for the moment.
Like other levels of explanation, such as the neurological or
the behavioral, MTC provides a way of looking at perception
systematically. However, we must keep in mind that to say, for
example, that the goal of the system is "maximizing the efficien-
cy of the negentropic coupling between organism and environ-
ment" is only one way of expressing it. There is an artificiality to
the way in which we keep each level of explanation separate
(Norman 1981), pursuing each to its end and then wondering
where the others connect. A good example of this is demon-
strated by Dennett's (1978) tracing of the subpersonal chart for
pain, which allows no slot for the feeling of pain.
My argument is not against the use of the MTC approach but
against, for the want of a better term, any linear approach to the
explanation of perception. To understand intentionality or se-
mantic information is like the corresponding effort to under-
stand pain. It must be looked at in its totality, not in parts.
Although Sayre grants that intentionality is a dynamic rela-
tionship that includes interaction with the environment, he cuts
his view of this relationship too short too soon. For example, his
discussion of the cascades of information channels may be a
move in the right direction, but he does not go far enough. In
talking about redundancy, he brings up the subject of memory
but then limits his discussion of memory to percept levels.
Elsewhere, as he discusses the Accumulator, he again fails to
explore complex connections to other cognitive areas. He does
mention pattern storage facilities, but why is it useful to try to
see the Abstractor as functioning without resources in higher
levels of cognitive function? Although Sayre mentions that high
levels of mutual information let an organism pursue its interests,
how shall we interpret this?
Information theory as an independent measure of person-
independent signals has been found irrelevant by psychologists,
because information received is dependent on the recipient
(Haber 1983). Linear approaches to understanding a perceptual
system continually fail to account for many factors. The
awareness of an organism of its own states is intimately wound
up in these multifaceted connections. Indeed, it has often been
suggested that the eyes are part of the brain. Visual events do
not happen in isolation, any more than pain events happen in
isolation. Visual perception occurs according to the context of
emotions, experiences, and expectations. A system that cannot
know also cannot see, although it can receive and generate
information (Dretske 1982, p. 153). In an emergency, we don't
notice pain, nor do we "see" what it is not urgent to see. We
would not know what it means to see devoid of thought and
behavioral responses any more than we know what it would
mean to have pain devoid of the complex variety of responses
with which it is commonly associated (Morphis 1980).
How can we isolate the visual perception of a cat from all
associated experiences and still be interacting with the environ-
ment? In an extreme case, I might not even be able to dis-
tinguish a totally new item from other items, but I am not often
in this position. More commonly, I am in only somewhat
unfamiliar circumstances, which allows me to search for applica-
ble parallels, seeking confirmations and completing partial in-
formation through other senses whenever possible. We scan
according to our goals and desires, and also scan what seems
anomalous.
If we are to identify the "aboutness" of semantic information,
it will not be found in one location or series of events any more
than the feeling of pain can be so located. Cognitive science
must develop a clearer model of the extraordinary complexity of
the human perceptual system; the totality of this model will
reveal what we want to know about intentionality. Such a model
may not immediately do anything to help resolve the issue of
whether robots can then be intentional, but one goal at a time.
As the concepts of parallel processing develop, perhaps these
will give further clues about the ways in which multilayered
feedback systems can complete a "total process" model of the
intentionality, with MTC forming one of the parts of that
totality. [See Ballard: "Cortical Connections and Parallel Pro-
cessing" BBS 9(1) 1986.]
Intentionality as internality
Don Perlisa and Rosalie Hallb
'Computer Science Department and bPsychology Department, University
of Maryland, College Park, Md. 20742
Sayre strives valiantly to understand meaning by linking inter-
nal processes to external ones. However, this approach seems in
conflict with his own argument against the so-called official
stance. We suggest that his argument against the official stance
can be put in the following "strong" form: If an entity S (person,
mechanism, etc.) is to be said to attribute a meaning (of its own)
to one of its internal objects (process, token, etc.), then this
attribution of meaning by S must itself occur within S. More-
over, since the removal of entities external to S does not in
general affect whether S is attributing meaning to its tokens,
such an attribution of meaning by S should not depend on
anything outside S, that is, should be determined solely by
phenomena within S. This position we shall call the "internal"
stance.
Sayre's solution focuses on the "relationship of identity in
info(t) structure between O and C" - which he says "is the
intentionality of perception." In fact this identity is external to
the mechanism S embodying the "structure at C" said by Sayre
to be "enjoying this relationship." His "structure at C" does not
have (is ignorant of) O or any relationship between C and O,- at
least as far as Sayre describes it. This relationship is there in the
world for Sayre to observe and report truly to us, but in what
way is it there for S? Sayre is silent on this.
For 0 to carry the meaning of C for S, this meaning must, if
we hold to the internal stance, be something such that it would
make a difference to S were the so-called meaning to be altered.
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1
151

Commentary/Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
But as Dennett (1978) and Stitch (1984) have amply illustrated,
the external contexts can be modified ad nauseam, to the point
that we ourselves are no longer sure how to ascribe meanings or
truths.
Sayre might reply that these criticisms depend on a richer
cognitive setting than that of visual perception. However, if we
restrict ourselves to Sayre's criteria for intentional perception,
our strong argument again suggests why they are not adequate.
For example, it seems very strained to argue that because a
visual mechanism can "track" 3-D mock-ups of roads (as is being
done at the Computer Vision Laboratory at the University of
Maryland) it thereby "intends" to follow a road of which it has no
concept. (More on this mechanism below.) Sayre employs
evocative but question-begging terms: "focused on," "tracks,"
"locks on," and discusses mechanisms that carry out functions
intuitively related to these terms, but he does not seem to get
away from the underlying quandary.
If we accept the internal stance (that whether A means B for S
must depend only on elements that reside wholly within S),
then we can propose a partial solution: that a form of self-
reference occurs within S, so that, at a rough gloss, we might say
"S perceives itself as engaged in a process of focusing on B via
A." Without further elaboration, of course, this would be an idle
and circular notion. We are at present working on a theory of
intentionality along lines suggested by such a gloss and will in
the following discussion try to contrast our approach with that of
Sayre.
In our approach, S's attribution of meaning B to A occurs only
if A and B are entities within S. Any external connection to
entities O outside S are not part of attributions of meaning
properly ascribed to S. (We do grant that external entities may
well be part of what it means [to us] for the meanings within S to
be realistic, much as our seeing in our mind's eye a unicorn is not
realistic although it is certainly meaningful for us.)
For example, with an automatic visual road-follower, it makes
all the difference in the world whether the mechanism has a
token "A" that is its road-concept, to which it compares its road-
image token "B," as well as its self-image "I" comprising tokens
for its effectors and sensors. Only then, it would seem, could it
make sense of such a thing as being "off-track" or "nearly back
on track," etc. Thus, elements of reasoning (in the form of
internal assertions) appear absolutely central to the very pros-
pect of intentionality, even in the restricted domain of visual
perception.
That is, unlike Sayre's O, which is external, the meaning of A
is another token or process within S, call it B, which S represents
as something "tracked" or "focused on" by a perceptual com-
parator A. Figure 1 hints at the unavoidably complex scenario
this requires:
Here O is in fact unknown to S, it cannot be put inside S.
Nonetheless, S can "know" of its tracking efforts by having both
processes (tracked [B] and tracker [A and /]) present in its
tokens, and, by comparing B to A, S can take steps to rectify any
imperfections in B (such as being out of focus). Of course, for this
to work well in a context of external visual inputs such as from O,
the effectors and sensors must be well-tuned. Therefore O is not

sponds to O (see text).
necessarily irrelevant to the overall behavior of S, but it is not
the criterion for the occurrence of intentionality.
We confess that Figure 1 grossly oversimplifies things. There
is more properly no fixed A or B. Rather, a quotation device
should allow fairly unrestricted "reflection" of any element in S
"into" /. Minsky (1968) addresses this issue but seems to think a
hierarchy or network is called for. In Perlis (1985) it is suggested
that this is unnecessary.
Intentionality: No mystery
William T. Powers
1738 Whitfield. Rd., Northbrook. III. 60062
Sayre flirts with the idea that would solve the problem of
intentionality, the concept of control, but his treatment of that
subject is too superficial and uninformed to succeed. Perhaps
this is because, like generations of scientists before him, he
assumes from the beginning that intentionality is only a way of
speaking, an idiom. With that a priori admission of defeat in the
background, it is not surprising that his treatment of inten-
tionality wanders into the underbrush of verbal abstraction
where neither the trees nor the forest are visible.
Sayre's treatment of control might fool a layman, but any
control engineer would find it, to be kind, inadequate. Every
time the discussion of control comes to a thicket, Sayre waves his
arms and presto! we have popped out on the other side. For
example, he speaks of "the ability of a control system to correct
deviations from an optimal mode of operation." The word
"optimal" aside (optimality has almost nothing to do with con-
trol), control systems do indeed have the ability to correct
deviations (from a set-point, whether optimal or not), and this
ability is a strong hint about intentionality. Whether a given
state of the environment constitutes a "deviation" depends on
some criterion for the "right" condition, which in control theory
is physically embodied as a perfectly real physical reference
signal inside the control system. Without a reference signal for
comparison, no perception, no input, implies anything about
the behavior of a control system.
In the section on the "Discriminator," Sayre says "The
behavioral side of the control loop begins with the various stages
of the efferent nervous system, initiating control signals that are
translated into bodily activity undertaken with respect to ob-
jects in the proximate environment." This is, of course, the
problem with the normal input-output model. The "control"
signals (a misnomer) are translated, somehow, into just the
motor actions needed to produce a consistent result in a variable
environment, meaning that they must (and do) change accord-
ing to external disturbances and constraints, even invisible
ones. Discovering how this could possibly occur would solve the
problem of intentionality. But Sayre simply proceeds: "when
the organism is active and its control system [just one?] is
functioning normally, its bodily activity is directed toward, or
with respect to, the same object, or set of objects, that produces
the signals at the input of the perceptual side of the loop."
The phrase "directed toward" again contains the heart of the
issue. How is direction established, and by what? This would be
an opportunity to discuss orienting as a control phenomenon,
but Sayre presses ahead. "The primary function of the control
loop is to enable the organism to adjust its behavior with respect
to those objects in a manner responsive to its needs and in-
terests. " And finally, "For the behavioral side of the control loop
to serve its function adequately with respect to a given object,
the perceptual side must provide an adequate representation of
that object at their cortical interface." Yes, yes, now you've
got it!
But he hasn't got it. He has a perceptual representation of the
object as it is, a behavioral output that can affect the object (and
thus the perceptual representation of it), and the concept that
152
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

Commentary /Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
the behavior must affect the object (and the perception) in a way
"responsive to needs" rather than in other equally possible
ways. But he stops there, within a millimeter of control theory.
Suppose the "need" is another signal, representing not the
actual state but the "needed" state of the object. And suppose
the behavior is driven by the difference between the perception
and this reference signal. The result is a standard arrangement
for a physically realizable control system that varies its actions to
make the "object" approach the "needed" state and remain
there despite disturbances. The signal representing the
"needed" state is identically one intention regarding that ob-
ject. The problem is solved. We could build such a system (and
have done so hundreds of thousands of times over the past 40
years). This is no metaphor.
Having come that close to the answer he seeks, Sayre aban-
dons the chase and starts pursuing info(t) and info(s) and other
creatures of the imagination. Not that I object to them: they may
or may not have usefulness in a working model. But they tell us
nothing about control, and nothing, therefore, about intention.
I do object to Sayre's blithe assumption (like Gibson's) that
anyone's brain can compare a perceptual representation with
the external object it represents and thus determine its ade-
quacy or verisimilitude. "Ojective circumstances" are, literally,
a figment of the imagination. But that is a different subject.
The final proof that Sayre has missed the point is contained in
his assumption (which precedes as well as follows the discussion
of control) that behavior is somehow "guided" by the informa-
tion in perceptual representations. While this interpretation
preserves the traditional input-output model, it imputes to
perception the ability not only to inform the brain about the
state of the environment, but to inform it about the proper or
intended state of the environment. Without control theory, of
course, there is nowhere else one can look for an explanation of
the purposiveness of behavior, but with control theory there is
no need for this most unlikely postulate. Guidance is a term into
which a host of unspoken assumptions are packed. Unpacked, it
becomes simply what a control system does, and it is not
contained in any one signal. The correct way of describing a
control system's behavior is to say that the system varies its
output as required in order to maintain its input signal matching
its reference signal. The output controls the input, not the other
way around. Everyone who really understands control systems
understands this description and can cite experimental methods
for showing that it is correct and the other model is wrong.
Control systems do not control their actions. They control their
perceptions, by acting on the source of those perceptions, the
outside world.
Intentionality: A problem of multiple
reference frames, specificational information,
and extraordinary boundary conditions on
natural law

It is refreshing to see a scholar who is largely sympathetic to the
so-called information processing or representational/ computa-
tional approach to cognitive systems recognizing its fundamen-
tal inadequacies. To be blunt, that approach fails to come to
terms with either information or intentionality. Sayre's re-
sponse to these inadequacies, however, keeps close to the
received view. He assumes that a biologically and psychologi-
cally relevant sense of information can be provided by the
mathematical theory of communication; he assumes that inten-
tionality amounts to representation. These assumptions are
bolstered by the closely cognate beliefs that intentionality is to
be ascribed to some roughly midway state in the classical
afferent-efferent link and that there is a metamorphosis from
meaningless states to meaningful states. To his credit, Sayre
aspires to make the representations genuine. He wants them to
stand for real things. He wants the transition from meaningless
sensory states to meaningful perceptual states to be (mathe-
matically) principled.
From my perspective as a proponent of the ecological ap-
proach to perceiving-acting (see Gibson 1979; Turvey, Shaw,
Reed & Mace 1981), Sayre's sentiments are right but his prem-
ises are wrong. Not surprisingly, I find his treatment of inten-
tionality disappointing. I concur with Sayre's implicit wish for a
concerted effort to naturalize (my word) intentionality, but my
preference is to keep the deliberations very close to natural
science and the search for lawful regularities. Sayre is quite right
in his assessment that an attempt to devise an explanation of
intentionality in the Turing reductionisrn/token physicalism
perspective of cognitive science (which denigrates inten-
tionality to the states of a computational device) does not have a
"ghost of a chance" (Carello, Turvey, Kugler & Shaw 1984;
Turvey et al. 1981). But he is quite wrong, I believe, in
suggesting that pursuing the purer equation of intentionality
with representation (relieved of computational procedures) can
fare any better.
Intentionality is directedness toward objects. Locomoting
terrestrial animals, including humans, direct themselves
through openings and around barriers. They direct their limbs
in certain ways with respect to a brink in a surface'- directing
them one way if the brink is where they can step down and
another way if it must be negotiated by jumping. Gibson (1966;
1979; Reed & Jones 1972) advocated mutually constraining
theories of animals and environments (see Alley in press; Mace
1977; Michaels & Carello 1981) as the basis for an understanding
of perceiving-acting that addressed such mundane intentional
behavior. (This central thesis of the ecological approach, the
duality of animal and environment [Shaw & Turvey 1982],
implies that efforts to ground intentionality only in "environ-
mental constraints" will miss the mark. Duality, by the way, is
not dualism.) Gibson pursued a perceptual theory that was
fundamentally intentional rather than one that is made inten-
tional as an afterthought. With considerable care he identified
how an understanding of intentionality of perceiving poses
challenges for science on several fronts, and how these chal-
lenges might be met. I will describe two of them.
The first challenge is to describe the layout of surfaces with
reference to the animal. This move is continuous with the larger
lesson of relativity theory: All state descriptions are frame
dependent. Reference frames are substantial and are not to be
confused with the coordinate systems that abstractly represent
them. The properties of an animal to which surface layout must
be referred are basically the animal's magnitudes, its mor-
phology, its metabolism. With regard to a brink, the separation
of surfaces is in reference to limb magnitudes. Obviously a given
brink can be referred to multiple, equally real frames. One
frame is the terrestrial frame with distances and durations
measured in arbitrary units. This frame is useful to the physicist
but it is, by definition, animal-neutral. (In the received view it is
mistakenly adopted as the sole objective frame.) Other frames
are individual animals. Consequently, the same brink in the
terrestrial frame is a place negotiable by leg extension in the
frame provided by one (larger) animal not negotiable in this
fashion in the frame provided by another (smaller) animal.
A second challenge is to describe how animals can be in-
formed about these frame-dependent environmental properties
(affordances) to which their activities are directed. There are
two senses in which the term information is used (cf. Turvey &
Kugler 1984). In the indicational/injunctional sense information
consists of symbol strings identifying states of affairs ("the
situation is so-and-so") or things to be done ("do so-and-so
now"). Information in this sense is underconstraining, like a stop
sign. The other sense is the specificational sense of Gibson
(1979). In the case of vision, information is optical structure

153

Commentary/Say re: Intentionality and information processing
lawfully generated by facts â properties of surface layout,
properties of an animal's movements. This structure does not
resemble the facts; rather it is specific to them. The ecological
argument is that information in the specificational sense meets
the above challenge. I will give-some examples shortly but I
wish to preface them by noting what's at issue in the contrast
between the two senses of information.
The indicational/injunctional sense, I believe, fits neatly into
a tradition that takes the primary perceptual activity to be
discriminating among members of a set and the equilibrium
thermodynamics of closed systems as the branch of physics to
which discussions of information can be meaningfully referred.
In such a system the states are enumerable from the outset. To
put it very roughly, the information notion only has to address
their individual probabilities, thereby providing a basis for
discriminating among them. Living things, however, are open
systems. The animal-environment system, in which an animal
participates as one of the two mutually tailored components, is
open. Significantly, the states of an open system need not be
fixed at the outset. Given fluctuations in the microstructure and
nonlinearities, a scaling up in one or more variables discon-
tinuously decreases an open system's symmetry. More con-
straints arise. The system becomes more ordered. New states
come into existence. Consequently, the order principle and
complexions of Boltzman, and the notion of information that
they sustain, are of limited applicability to open physical sys-
tems (e.g., Prigogine 1980), including animal-environment
systems.
Open (evolving, developing) systems motivate a different
notion of information from closed systems (Kugler, Kelso &
Turvey 1982; Kugler & Turvey, in press). Sayre makes an
ofihand remark about the information in the genes and in the
phenotype. Efforts to apply classical information theoretic no-
tions to the genotype-phenotype link, conceived as a commu-
nication channel, have largely been dismissed. In intuitive
terms, the dismissal is based upon a feeling that an information
metric should recognize the greater complexity of the full-
fledged animal (Waddington 1968). Even where the open-
closed distinction is sidestepped, as in Pattee's (1973; 1977)
thoroughgoing and celebrated efforts to detail the problem of a
physical interpretation of "genetic information," the concep-
tions of the mathematical theory of communication have proven
to be of little value.
The specificational sense of information is consistent with the
perspective that takes perceiving the persisting and changing
properties of a thing as primary. For Gibson (1966; 1979) the
fundamental question is how to characterize the information
that supports the perceiving of P; the question of how to
characterize the information that supports distinguishing P from
Q, R, and so on is secondary and derivative. Suppose that P is
the animal itself. In locomoting, a terrestrial animal generates
forces that displace it relative to the surroundings. There are
obvious mechanical regularities to be noted. They are ordinarily
expressed through Newton's laws. But this situation also exhib-
its nonmechanical regularities expressed by non-Newtonian
laws of wide (though not universal) scope. For instance, all the
densely nested optical solid angles, whose bases are the faces
and facets of surfaces and whose apex is the point of observation,
change concurrently. An optical flow field - crudely, a smooth
velocity vector field - is generated. The global form of the flow,
or optical morphology, is specific to the configuration of loco-
motory forces and to the displacements of the animal. Rec-
tilinear forward locomotion, for example, lawfully generates a
dilating parabolic flow; a dilating parabolic flow specifies rec-
tilinear forward locomotion.
This simple but significant example of information in the
specificational sense permits me to make briefly some important
points that can be more carefully developed (e.g., Solomon,
Carello & Turvey 1984; Turvey & Carello 1985; in press; Turvey
et al. 1981). First, optical information in the specificational
sense is optical structure whose macroscopic, qualitative prop-
erties are nomically dependent upon and specific to (under
natural boundary conditions) properties of the animalâenviron-
ment system. Second, optical information in the specificational
sense does not reduce to neural signals in the visual system (see
below). Thinking about optical information as alternative (mac-
roscopic, qualitative) descriptions of the photon light field,
structured by the layout of material surfaces and defined relative
to locations and paths in the transparent medium (air for ter-
restrial animals), is useful. It aids an understanding of optical
information independent of vision and of the kinds of ocular
systems that evolved. Optical information in the specificational
sense is tied to laws at the ecological scale, laws that relate
optical properties to kinetic properties (of the animalâenviron-
ment system). The ecological approach argues that these laws
were the basis for the evolution of, and are the basis for the
everyday realization of, locomotor activity and its directedness
and intentionality.
Let's extend the example a little. Dilation of an optical solid
angle relative to a point of observation specifies the approach of a
substantial surface. The inverse of the relative rate of dilation, T,
specifies when the collision will occur if the current kinetic
conditions persist (Lee 1980). And the rate at which T changes
has a critical point property below which it specifies that the
upcoming collision will be soft and above which it specifies that
the upcoming collision will be hard (Kugler, Turvey, Carello &
Shaw 1985; Lee 1980). The foregoing are not so much quantities
as they are local flowfield morphologies and their changes. They
specify pending states. They make possible the synchronizing of
acts with events - the prospective control of basic behavior.
They are meaningful in a very pragmatic sense of the word.
Speaking in Dennett's (1983) terms, information in the specifi-
cational sense has "intentional features." And to echo Gibson's
(1966, 1979) longstanding gripe, the "meaningless to mean-
ingful" problem with which Sayre struggles is not a problem.
(Coming to terms with the laws at the ecological scale on which
the intentionality of perceiving-acting is founded, and figuring
out how to formulate and systematize them, now that's a
problem!).
Said succinctly, there is a description of optical structure
under which its detection guarantees the intentionality of per-
ceiving. There are other descriptions of optical structure under
which it must be translated or processed or interpreted or
embellished to make perceiving intentional. Sayre is playing
with one such description. In this respect it is important to note
that Gibson (1966, 1979) avidly denied that optical information
in the specificational sense was the sort of thing that could be
"processed." It is bizarre, therefore, for Sayre to claim that Marr
(1982) is on target with his criticism that Gibson underestimated
the complexity of visual information processing. There is a clash
of metaphors here. Marr and Sayre are operating in the
orthodox metaphor of the nervous system as an efficient cause;
for example, it produces percepts. Gibson (1966) sees the
nervous system as functioning vicariously in perceiving. It is a
part (albeit extremely rich) of the supportive basis for the
expression of natural cum ecological laws (cf. Ben-Zeev 1984).
An understanding of the nervous system's role in vision in the
support metaphor will be radically different from the process-
ing/producing understanding subscribed to by Marr and Sayre
(Kugler & Turvey, in press). At all events, in the ecological
view, optical descriptions that invoke processing to render
intentionless inputs into intentional percepts are of the wrong
kind. They beg too many questions and they cast intentionality
as a derivative rather than a primary phenomenon.
The last sentences, of course, are just another way of saying
that intentionality should not be reduced to representation. As I
remarked above, Sayre's goal of disengaging intentionality from
computational procedures is admirable; his insistence on the
intentional-representational equation is not. That equation, as I
have been trying to stress, diverts us from addressing inten-
tionality in a way that reveals its position in the natural order of
things. Consider the following: What are customarily referred to
154
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

Response I Say re: Intentionality and information processing
as an animal's or person's intentional contents (cf. Dennett 1969;
Searle 1983) constitute extraordinary boundary conditions on
natural law (especially those laws that are particularly pertinent
to the ecological scale). A flying animal aiming to collide gently
with a surface will synchronize its deceleration with one value of
T; an acceleration to produce a timely, violent collision will be
generated with respect to another value of T (e.g., Lee &
Reddish 1981; Lee, Young, Reddish, Lough & Clayton 1984;
Wagner 1982). In these simple examples the final conditions -
the animal's intentional content - specify the initial conditions
that a law (relating optical properties to kinetic conditions) must
assume. Examples like this abound, and one of them has been
investigated quite thoroughly (Kugler &Turvey, in press). They
suggest a profound challenge for naturalizing intentionality:
understanding the principles by which intentional contents
harness natural laws.
Author's Response
Intentionality and communication theory
K. M. Sayre
Department of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Ind.

Whether human cognitive capacities are fashioned by
species adaptation (i.e., they are innate) or by adaptation
of individual organisms (learned), or by some of both,
they evolved from noncognitive information-processing
functions. This is the basic assumption behind my ap-
proach. It might, of course, be factually wrong ("cre-
ationists" presumably would take that line). But if it is
even roughly correct, certain methodological conse-
quences follow for the study of cognition - that is, for CS.
First and foremost, it follows that explanations of cogni-
tion in any of its various forms - perception, language,
and reason, to name a few - should be pursued in an
evolutionary setting. This means, for one thing, that an
acceptable explanation of a given cognitive capacity
should make intelligible how that capacity might have
evolved from lower level cognitive or noncognitive func-
tions (for example, visual perception from mere pho-
toreceptivity). It also means that an adequate account of
how a given capacity actually operates might be expected
to allude to mechanisms functioning elsewhere in organic
nature (for example, mechanisms for adjusting negen-
tropic coupling). And it means that there are important
priorities to be observed in our explanatory approaches to
cognition overall, inasmuch as a reasonably secure under-
standing of a given low-level capacity (like perception)
might be a precondition for even a plausible conjecture
regarding the operations of a higher level capacity (like
referential language) that probably evolved from it.
Another assumption behind this approach is that the
distinction between cognitive and noncognitive neuronal
processes is basically a matter of whether info(s) (informa-
tion with semantic content) or info(t) (information in the
technical sense of communication theory) is being pro-
cessed, and that the mark of an info(s)-processing function
is its intentionality - its characteristic of being about some
particular object or state of affairs. A consequence of this
assumption, together with the first, is that MTC (the
mathematical theory of communication) might be ex-
pected to make indispensable contributions to our under-
standing of intentionality - not only because MTC is the
theory of info(t) transactions in general (surely including
those of visual perception), but also because of the unique
help it promises in imparting to CS the mathematical
substance characteristic of successful science.
In the target article, these considerations dictated an
investigation, incorporating relevant principles of MTC,
of the nature of the intentional functions operating in
visual perception, of how they might have evolved from
info(t)-processing functions typical of noncognitive forms
of photoreceptivity, and of the adaptive mechanisms they
might possibly employ. Success in this investigation
would pave the way for a subsequent study of higher
info(s)-processing capacities such as language and reason.
Explaining intentionality? A head-on challenge to this
project overall was posed by Turvey who rejects my
approach (and Marr's [1982] as well) in favor of Gibson's
(1966; 1979) on the grounds that the former casts inten-
tionality in "a derivative rather than a primary" role while
the latter treats perception as "fundamentally inten-
tional." The objection, I take it, is that intentionality is
something that does not admit explanation, being found
in nature as a primitive phenomenon. My disagreement
on this score is too basic to permit any short-order
response other than to say that treating intentionality as
primitive in a theory of perception is on a par with
treating "vital forces" as primitive in biology. From a
properly scientific viewpoint, I am convinced, the
"meaningless to meaningful" problem which Turvey and
Gibson reject is not only a legitimate problem but the
single most important problem in CS today. It was Gib-
son's failure to see this that led to my seconding Marr's
claim that he had underestimated the complexity of visual
information processing. What I find bizarre about
Turvey's commentary, incidentally, is its grouping my
approach with Marr's in this respect. As far as can be told
from his major work, Vision, Marr didn't have an account
of intentionality at all, and this is one of my objections to
his approach. Whichever may be the side of the angels in
this regard, Turvey is the one who appears to be on the
same side as Marr. Both find intentional content present
in systems (biological or mechanical) where it does not
require explanation but is available as it stands for ex-
plaining other phenomena. Needless to say, I take the
other side on that question.
What computers can contribute. This brings us back to
the much belabored issue whether computer states can
possess intentionality (info(s)) that is not "observer rela-
tive." Only one commentator took exception to my argu-
ment that they cannot, which is interesting as a possible
indication that the contrary opinion is finally on the wane.
In his argument for the old orthodoxy, Lebowitz urges
that symbolic representations in AI (artificial intelligence)
systems are more than isolated symbols, being instead
"bundles of inference rules" - that the symbol "CAT," for
instance, might refer to such facts as that cats walk on four
feet, like milk, are mortal, "and dozens or hundreds of
other rules." But surely the degree of complexity in the
"rules" behind a symbol's use does nothing to change the
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1
155

Response/ Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
stubborn fact that if a symbol refers to anything at all it
does so because of the programmer's (or user's) inten-
tions. It may be worth noting that Lebowitz's claim about
"inference rules" appears to make sense in the first place
only because of an equivocation on the term "rule."
There are rules for formal symbol manipulation (which
computers can follow) that, being formal, have nothing to
do with reference at all, and rules for the interpretation of
symbols (which so far only people can follow) that, al-
though clearly having to do with reference, owe their
standing as rules to human intentions. In neither case do
the rules in question provide reference for the symbols by
themselves, regardless of how complex the set of rules
involved may be. This stubborn fact is not changed by the
addition of capacities such as long-term memory to the
system. What might change is the degree of temptation to
describe the capacities of the system thus augmented in
psychological terms (Lebowitz blithely speaks of "devel-
opfing] higher level concepts," determining "conceptual
content of the input," "understanding," and so forth).
"Semantic representation" is just another in the long list
of psychological terms computer scientists have appropri-
ated to describe their art. Yet the ability of a computa-
tional system to deal with what Lebowitz calls "semantic
representations" no more amounts to representation of
the kind my article addresses than its ability to "under-
stand" a given programming language amounts to an
approximation of human understanding in a cognitively
interesting sense.
Golden's thoughtful comments suggest the need to
clarify my argument that computational systems of the
sort with which CS is currently occupied do not exhibit
"intrinsic' intentionality. I have not argued that comput-
er-based systems generally cannot possess intentionality
of the sort my account ascribes to human percipients. In
Section 10 I briefly discuss what properties systems of
that sort might need in order to establish intentional
relationships with the environments supplying their data.
What I had in mind primarily were environments like
those with which human percipients form intentional
relationships, but Golden reminds us that another sys-
temâenvironment arrangement is possible â that the
environment might be simulated as well as the perci-
pient. I agree that a promising initial step toward the
actual construction of an intentional mechanism would be
to model both organism and evnironment on a computer,
provided the data-processing functions involved were
roughly those of the target article. I also agree with
Eskew, however, that the mathematics needed for the
mechanical implementation of these functions may not
currently be available in the forms required.
Another (barely) possible arrangement is pointed out
by Churchland, who mulls over the purported coun-
terexample of a human percipient in an entirely simulat-
ed environment. His elegant treatment of the celebrated
"brain in the vat" predicament probes the position taken
by the target article that intentionality is located in the
relation between percipient and environment. The intent
of the counterexample is to show that the subject-en-
vironment relation can alter radically, and yet the seman-
tic (intentional) content remains the same. Churchland's
thought experiment, however, is not fully enough spec-
ified to constitute a clear counterexample to the position
taken by my article., It is not clear, first, what the semantic
content is supposed to be. According to my account, at
least, it would not be the subject's thinking "he's at a
baseball game," but rather the configuration of info(t)-
bearing events occasioned (under normal conditions) by
the surface features of the baseball, the hot dog, or some
such object or set of objects. In terms of Section 10, the
content is the set of events O at the input of the anterior
channel O-R (and not, we should carefully note, the
actual objects that provide occasion for those events). Nor
is it clear, second, whether the relation between subject
and environment (although certainly different in the
"brain in the vat" case) is different in ways that should
affect the content. All that affects content, as far as the
anterior channel is concerned, is the input O and the
output R, and not the particular causal processes by
which O and R happen to be connected. As long as the
statistical characteristics of the channel O-R remain con-
stant, the causal relation between its termini is irrelevant
to the subject's content.
Now, what exactly is the counterexample? By stipula-
tion, the posterior channel R-C remains unaltered, and so
does the activity of the subject's efferent system. But for
there to be a counterexample at all, the content O must
also remain unchanged. Given the unaltered channel R-
C, this entails that the channel O-R itself remains un-
altered in its statistical characteristics. Because we are
assuming that the efferent system produces control sig-
nals pertaining to O in exactly the same fashion as before,
it follows that everything in the relation between subject
and environment that affects the content O remains
unchanged. All that is changed is the causal processes that
provide the occasion of O; and, extensive as these may be,
they are not essential to the content of the subject's
perception. In brief, given the conditions of "perfect
deception" that the thought experiment imposes, if the
content is the same, then so are all the relevant environ-
mental relationships, and no counterexample to my ac-
count has been produced. Think of it this way. Just as in
Berkeley's theory of perception there is no detectable
difference between a real physical object and a "perfect
illusion," so on my account there is no detectable dif-
ference between the real perceptual environment and a
"perfect computer simulation." The philosopher's notion
of a completely undetectable deception removes the
distinction between "deception" and "reality" beyond
the pale of scientific significance.
How the explanation should proceed. Several commen-
tators, while agreeing with the thrust of my expalnatory
project, raised criticisms about the manner in which it
was pursued. Dennett, for instance, complains that my
account is lacking in detail, being only a "theory sketch"
too much given to "handwaving." Morphis, by contrast,
expresses confidence in my basic approach, but thinks it
should be executed with a "broader and more adven-
turous hand." Leyton believes that there are resources in
ecology and thermodynamics that my article ignores with
baleful consequences, while Powers is mildly scornful of
my failure to see that all the problems could be solved by
control theory exclusively.
In response to Dennett, it should first be said that the
reason I am not confusing the "specs" of a system with its
design is that I am not at present in the business of
building systems at all. (I once was - see Sayre, 1973 -
156

Respon.se/Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
and that presumably is the reason he finds my account of
noise reduction "relatively detailed.") Dennett's delight-
fully whimsical "Vigilator" illustrates once again his con-
siderable skill at what he himself not long ago described as
the exploration of "highly abstract constraints" of psycho-
logical theories, "without worrying about the mechanics
and biochemistry of concrete 'realizations'" - an enter-
prise he hails as "the most promising and exciting work
. . . being done today" in AI, psychology, and philosophy
of mind (Dennett 1979, p. 255). There is something
deliciously droll about being cited by the author of that
job description for having produced only a "sketch" of a
theory that leaves "the question of mechanism
untouched."
But seriously, what I am trying to do in the target
article - to summarize it once again - is to describe a
functionally articulate set of processes that in upshot
would accomplish a directionality upon objects, all of
which can be understood as information-processing pro-
cedures in an explicit and precise sense of the term
"information," and all of which incidentally could be
implemented in both naturally and artifically contrived
systems. The advance I purport to have achieved over
Gibson (1966; 1979) (since Dennett asks) is with regard
both to functional articulateness and to explicitness in
sense of "information" involved. The superiority to be
claimed over Marr (1982) (certainly not a matter of detail)
is in the attempt I make to limit use of the term "informa-
tion" to precisely defined senses, and in my taking se-
riously the problem of explaining how brain states can
represent the properties of objects in the first place.
Dennett notes that the concept of fidelity has been seen
as a necessary component of representation by "everyone
from Gibson to Marr to Fodor to Winograd," who have
not made much of it because they take it for granted. I
agree. My complaint is that they should not have taken it
for granted because it is a very tricky concept. And if, as
Dennett allows, my analysis in terms of high mutual
info(t) "captures this [concept of fidelity] nicely," then
this is certainly a step in the right direction - and just as
certainly an illustration of the usefulness of MTC in
psychological explanation.
A response in the same vein is due Dennett's welcome
remark that there is nothing to quarrel with in my use of
the concepts of negentropic coupling and negentropic
flexibility (pace Leyton). It may be, as he claims, that
there is nothing new here except the language (although I
doubt it); but even if this is so, the language has not been
getting much play in CS, and I would like to think that my
article shows reasons why it deserves more attention. I
also note with pleasure that in Dennett's estimation if we
had a "scaling" defined for negentropic coupling as we do
for mutual information, we might have gained new
powers of description and problem setting. The "scaling"
in question is degree of success in the organism's percep-
tually guided ventures.
Finally, Dennett thinks my proposals "curiously un-
dercut" my criticism of the computational approach.
What I find curious is that he should think so. My
criticism is that CS cannot rely upon the intentionality of
computer states for an explanation of the intentionality of
psychological states in humans, because computer inten-
tionality derives from the human variety. I have at-
tempted to provide an alternative model of intentionality
- one not relying on the assumption of human inten-
tionality in the first place - and the fact that intention
turns out to be "relational" in this model is neither here
nor there. It remains the case that we cannot rely on
computer intentionality to explain the human variety,
because the former still derives from the latter despite
the outcome of my attempt.
What Morphis means by saying that my approach
would be better pursued in a broader and more adven-
turous manner, I take it, is that intentionality (like pain)
involves many interactions with other functions of the
organism and can be fully understood only in a broader
context than my account provides. I believe this is right.
Although a considerably broader context is provided by
Sayre (1969; 1976), a great deal more is required, and
Morphis is to be commended for pointing this out.
I hope Leyton will not find me disingenuous in agree-
ing with most of his factual observations while failing to
see why he thinks they are even slightly damaging to my
account. The term "negentropic coupling" is explicitly
introduced in the target article as a label for the rela-
tionship an organism enjoys with its host environment
that enables it to assimilate negentropy in forms and
amounts needed, and to rid itself of the resulting by-
products. Energy for work is one form of negentropy in
question, and what Leyton calls an "energy sink" is what
absorbs the byproducts figuring in my definition. So
although I am using "negentropic coupling" in a some-
what broader sense than he is, his sense is certainly
included in mine. Nor is it an objection to point out that
there are some features of negentropic flexibility I do not
mention (those having to do with trophic levels on food
chains). Such features may be presumed irrelevant to the
topic of the article. Leyton is right in pointing out that
what he calls "nonspecific information" is important for
understanding the defensive mechanisms of sentient or-
ganisms. (These matters are discussed at length in Sayre,
1976). But since the "information" involved is non-
specific, and hence not focused upon specific objects, it is
of no particular concern for an account of intentionality.
Finally, Leyton cites various types of perceptual phe-
nomena not involved in ongoing manipulative tasks, the
upshot of which is supposed to be that two "irreconcilable
demands" fall upon my account: stabilization (which my
account is claimed to emphasize) and destabilization
(illustrated supposedly by cases in which animals reject
present perceptions - destabilize them? - in search of
others that are more rewarding). But there is no conflict
here that goes beyond Leyton's terminology, because in
the perceptual life of any healthy animal the "stabiliza-
tion" of one percept is at the expense of the "destabiliza-
tion" of its predecessors. In sum, there is no incom-
patibility of any sort between my account and the factors
Leyton cites, and certainly nothing approaching logical
inconsistency as he extravagantly charges. Of all the
commentators Leyton seems to appreciate best the ther-
modynamic dimensions of my approach, and I look for-
ward to opportunities for productive interchange once
these misunderstandings are cleared away.
Powers asserts that discovering how signals introduced
into the efferent system could possibly change according
to external disturbances and constraints would "solve the
problem of intentionality" and then opines that with a
certain amount of "arm waving" I move things "within a

Response I Say re: Intentionality and information processing
millimeter of control theory" which is supposed to pro-
vide all the answers. As he is a control theorist, one might
wonder, why doesn't he rejoice at the progress and take
the final millistep himself? Then we would cordially
congratulate each other for having solved a very difficult
problem. But the reasons for his lack of cordiality soon
appear. He thinks the problem has been solved long ago -
by control theory, of course - and that its solution has
been illustrated "hundreds of thousands of times." Pre-
sumably it is illustrated by any system whose behavior is
driven by the difference between its "perception" of a
particular object and a "reference signal" establishing the
"needed" state of that object. Readers acquainted with
early cybernetic literature may recall that systems of this
description (goal-seeking mechanisms) were at one time
popular as illustrations of "purposive" systems. Now
"intentional" in one of its several senses is roughly syn-
onymous with "purposive." This leads me to suspect that
Powers assumes the target article is about intentional in
the sense of purposive rather than in the sense of being
about an object, which of course it is not. Perhaps my
article is insufficiently clear on this matter, for both
MacKay and Perlis & Hall seem at times to share the
same misapprehension (MacKay in his talk of "meaning
for the goal-pursuing system," and Perlis & Hall in their
discussion of the visual mechanism that "intends" to
follow a road). If so, I apologize to the commentators
concerned. Reasons for being dissatisfied with goal-seek-
ing mechanisms as models of intention in the sense of
purpose, incidentally, may be found in Chapter 3 of Sayre
(1969).
Whether MTC has a role. There are actually two related
issues here: whether communication theory, however
conceived, has a proper role to play in a project like mine;
and, if so, whether in the strict form of MTC or in some
more "relaxed" version. An interesting statistic is that,
whereas three commentaries (Brown, Earle & Lea, Gor-
don, and MacKay â all and only the English commen-
tators) express the opinion that no version of communica-
tion theory is relevant, and six (Heil, Leyton, Marks,
Perlis & Hall, Powers, and Turvey) take no stand on the
issue, the majority remaining all express confidence that
communication theory is relevant in some form or an-
other. And of the latter, all save Dretske - a notable
exception - believe (if I represent them correctly) that
MTC strictly conceived is the version from which help
can be expected. This (to me) is most heartening, because
I would have guessed that before quite recently the
received view was that MTC has little or nothing to offer
in the study of cognition.
The notable exception is Dretske, who probably has
thought as much as anyone else in the world about the
role of communication theory in cognitive studies. Why
do we (he and I), he asks, both look in the same places but
find different things? To be sure, we are not looking in
exactly the same places, for I am looking in the direction
of strict MTC and he is looking toward a distinctly
"relaxed" version (see Sayre 1983; Dretske 1983b). So the
question really is: Why, with this shared goal of develop-
ing an information-theoretic approach to cognition, do
we persist in looking in different directions? Part of the
answer, I am inclined to think, is that I want to stick
strictly to MTC as a mathematical theory, because this is a
necessary condition for using the theorems and principles
of that theory in the study of cognition. For me, at least,
diese are important resources. Especially important are
Shannon's 10th theorem (Section 8) and the formula
defining mutual information (Sections 5, 8, 9, 10, and 11).
(2c- = 2c> + 2C2 also figures briefly in Section 8.) The
answer to MacKay's question - why "assume" the sum
rather than the product in the right hand of the equation?
- is simply that the equation as stated is a theorem, while
the other form would be a falsehood. A proof may be
found in the Solution Book, pp. 51-52, of Gallager (1968),
problem 4.18, p. 525. Another part of the answer may lie
with the fact that I envisage in the very long run a theory
of cognition that is mathematical in roughly the sense of
thermodynamics, while Dretske appears content with
explanations reflecting the categories of folk psychology. I
return to specific issues raised by Dretske's important
commentary in later paragraphs.
Other possible resources. Methodological criticisms of a
different sort concern the emphases of my proposals.
Brown et al., for instance, object to my bringing efferent
processes into the account of intentionality; several other
commentators stress the importance of internal "goal-
criteria" (MacKay), "reference signals" (Powers), or
"concepts" (Perlis & Hall), with reference to which (as
Powers puts it) the efferent output of the intentional
system controls its afferent input. I believe that Brown et
al. are pretty much on the wrong side of this issue. The
notion of "aboutness" they appear to favor, as a feature of
specific representations at the visual input, abstracted
from the functions these representations serve in the
activity of the system overall, is a misconception fostered
by the computational model. My account assumes that
visual representations have an important (but not ex-
clusive) function in the guidance of behavior (could any-
one seriously think otherwise?) and gives this function
due emphasis in its explication of perceptual inten-
tionality. I am basically sympathetic with the suggestion
that an account of intentionality should afford room for
internal "goal" representations with reference to which
the system regularly "evaluates" (MacKay's term) the
course of its perceptual affairs - as long as thinking in
these terms does not lull one into confusing intention in
the sense of purpose with the intentionality of being
about something (to mention that danger once again). In
my account, the role played by established patterns
drawn from Percept Storage (Section 9.3) comes close to
the comparator functions stressed by these several com-
mentators.
Brown et al. are lavish in their criticism, objecting (as
best I can make out) (1) that my account contains more
"free parameters" (functionally independent variables?)
than what it purports to explain, (2) that it uses some-
thing like an "analysis by synthesis" model which has
been tried and found failing, (3) that my account, as an
alternative to Marr's, ignores his distinction among com-
putational, algorithmic, and representational levels of
explanation, and (4) that my account cannot be usefully
extended. Regarding (1), although I agree that it would
be a move in the wrong direction to concoct an explanans
that left more factors unexplained than are present in the
explanandum, I am at a loss as to how Brown et al. have
found out how many "free parameters" are acutally pre-
158
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

sent in the perceptual process. Regarding (2), I confess
that my account derives from earlier models in Sayre
(1965), which (acknowledging indebtedness to Licklider,
1952) used something like an "analysis by synthesis"
approach; but the present approach to problems of in-
tentionality has not been tried before and has not yet
been proven a failure. Regarding (3), although I too
admire the detail achieved in Marr's theory, I have little
confidence in an account that attributes to neu-
rophysiological mechanisms the kind of mathematical
computations Marr performs in his calculations (neu-
rophysiological networks don't compute like people do);
and with my low confidence in this approach goes an
attentuated interest in its threefold distinction among
levels of explanation. Regarding (4), it may suffice to say
that I cannot see why it is an objection to my account
that I don't extend it to the intentionality of action
(which they say psychologists have not found crucial
anyway), and that the syllogism to which I do extend it is
no longer considered paradigmatic of reason (I had not
suggested otherwise). In upshot, the commentary of
Brown et al. seems to illustrate how hard it is to produce
an objective critique of views substantially different from
those one has been brought up on.
I note with interest the other mathematical formalisms
Golden mentions as possibly helpful in the study of
intentionality, particularly the "special case" class of state
vectors that have both thermodynamic and neurophysio-
logical connections. While agreeing that other forms of
mathematics will almost certainly prove useful in this
study, I remain appreciative of Golden's estimation that
my approach through MTC should result in new insights.
Marks s commentary seems best read as a recommen-
dation that CS not overlook the broadly adaptive influ-
ences upon our preferential behavior. This seems legiti-
mate. I find useful Marks's distinction between theories
of syntactics, semantics, and pragmatics in cognitive
studies. In these terms, my account attempts to lay the
basis for a semantic theory by incorporating pragmatics
in some general sense.
I would like to be able to reply at greater length to
Churchland's advocacy of a "network" theory of semantic
content, and to his reading of my argument in Section 3 as
a rejection of this approach. I hope this is a misreading,
because I am in sympathy with a great deal of what
Churchland says (in his commentary and in 1979) in
behalf of this approach. Part of the disparity may be
cleared up by noting that the semantic networks of AI,
which I argue in Section 3 do not illuminate inten-
tionality, are not in the same boat with Churchland's
theory - at least if we give full credit to his observation
that the intentional states of cognitive creatures enjoy
nomic and statistical connections not only with the en-
vironment (my emphasis on his words) but also with an
enormous range of other cognitive states. It seems to me
by and large correct that the semantic content of our
thoughts and language is determined primarily (although
not exhaustively) by the role they play within our respec-
tive "cognitive economies." Churchland and I may differ
in our views of how semantic content is introduced into
these "cognitive economies" in the first place (I say
through percepts, which are promoted to meanings by
being freed from exclusive stimulus control), but there
appears to be considerable overlap between his concept
Response/Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
of a "cognitive economy" or netowrk and mine of a
conceptual linkage (Section 11). (More views of mine on
such matters may be found in Chapters 11 and 12 of
Sayre, 1976). Moreover, I suspect we don't differ funda-
mentally even on the role of perception in such matters,
because I agree entirely with his remark that the network
"retains systematic causal connections with reality, con-
nections, moreover, that carry information about reality"
(Churchland 1979, p. 41).
The quantification problem. One requirement for apply-
ing any mathematical formalism to empirical processes is
a specification of the factors that will stand as values of the
variables in the formalism; in the case of MTC, the
requirement is to specify the empirical events that will
stand as members of the input and output sets of informa-
tion channels. The tack taken by the target article is to
conceive that portion of the overall perceptual cascade O-
C stretching from the retina to the visual cortex (the
channel R-C; Section 10) as consisting of nonindependent
sets of neuronal events (firings, inhibitions, summations,
and so forth; Section 9) and the portion stretching from
object to retina (the channel O-R) consisting, on the R
side, of sets of neuronal events in the retina and, on the O
side, of physical events at the surface of the object - more
exactly, of electromagnetic events resulting from the
interaction of physical features of objective surfaces and
incident light rays. Before my account could be applied
experimentally, it would be necessary to achieve a great
deal more specificity in identifying the physical events
actually involved in the organism's perceptual processes,
and at this point I have little more to contribute toward
that end. Several commentators, however, quite prop-
erly raise questions in this regard, and they deserve the
best response I can muster.
Golden, in a probing analysis, notes that MTC is based
on assigning probabilities to specific events, and that
before calculations of the sort my account postulates can
actually take place it is necessary to identify relevant
neurophysiological events and to characterize the chan-
nels these events constitute. He is right in pointing out
that the target article says less than is needed on these and
related issues for a full-fledged application in the experi-
mental study of perception. What the article perhaps
does not make adequately clear is that the account it
presents, with its crude division into four info(t)-process-
ing stages, is an attempt to get a fighting start on problems
of just this sort. Before we can develop specific charac-
terizations of the channels implicated in perception, we
must have some general ideas about the types of informa-
tion-processing task involved. This is what the target
article has attempted to provide.
One aspect of the problem of specificity is what Gordon
calls the question of quantifying the stimulus array. Al-
lowing for ambiguities in the technical use of the term
"stimulus," this might mean either identifying the info(t)-
bearing events at R or identifying corresponding events at
the source O of the perceptual channel. Gordon's concern
is primarily with the latter, and he raises questions about
the "uncertainty" associated with the view of a mountain
from which the mist has just cleared, which looks some-
what like a human face, and so forth. Although, to be
sure, an adequate theory of visual perception had better
have something to say about large-scale views of distant
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1
159

Response/Say re: Intentionality and information processing
mountains, Gordon's choice of examples makes it difficult
to connect his questions with the target article's discus-
sion of perceptual objects on a much more modest scale.
(However, the issues raised by Gordon are treated in
Chapter 9 of Sayre, 1976). Another thing about Gordon's
remarks that makes responding difficult is that he seems
to be talking about "uncertainty" in the sense roughly of
subjective unexpectedness, whereas MTC (as has been
stressed by all its major expositors, and as is made
reasonably clear in Section 5) is concerned with uncer-
tainty exclusively in the sense of nonsubjective im-
probability. A similar misapprehension underlies the
comments by Eskew, whose main objection to my ac-
count is based on the "fundamental point" (questionably
attributed to Searle, 1980a) that info(t) must be observer-
relative. As carefully stated at the very beginning of
Dretske (1981), info(t) is "an objective commodity, some-
thing whose generation, transmission, and reception do
not require or in any way presuppose interpretive pro-
cesses." Info(t)-processing tasks of the general sort as-
cribed to visual perception in the target article are en-
tirely of this objective sort. These tasks are performed in
the observer's nervous system but in no other sense is
info(t) "in the observer" as Eskew suggests.
Nonetheless, Eskew is to be commended for having
thought carefully about several technical issues raised by
my account, particularly those regarding the importance
of sequential or temporal features in the processes conjec-
tured to take place at various junctures in the perceptual
cascade. At this point I can only say that a more complete
account of those processes would stress (1) the need for
channels in the afferent system with relatively stable
(time independent) conditional probabilities, (2) the se-
quential sampling of states of the Accumulator over real
time, treating that component as a Markov source, and (3)
scanning techniques for testing relative novelty of neu-
ronal activity from sector to sector of the Retina in its real-
time operation (perhaps roughly in the manner of an
electron microscope, with temporal sequence imposed
upon the data as a result of the scanning procedure).
A different type of concern about quantification is
raised by Daugman, which leads him to suspect a "basic
incoherence" in my application of MTC to perception.
This dire consequence is supposed to follow from my
attempting to provide a fidelity analysis of a channel
between a three-dimensional (3D) object and a two-
dimensional (2D) retina or cortex, which can't be done
because the units are incommensurable. But this com-
plaint is misguided on both counts, because (1) I explicitly
reject (Section 9.2) the rather peculiar assumption that
retinal (or cortical) representations are two-dimensional
(the retina is hemispherical), and (2) if Daugman's stric-
tures about dimensional commensurability were credi-
ble, it should be incoherent to talk about the fidelity of an
image of a 3D scene (for example, a sporting event)
conveyed across a one-dimensional telephone line, which
patently it is not. Moreover, while I certainly agree with
Daugman that some sort of "grain structure" would have
to be imposed on the object or image for the measures of
MTC to be applicable, I cannot imagine why he thinks
this would result in making those measures "irrelevant."
Also, although he is quite right in pointing out that the
"input/output" distinction is irrelevant in calculating
mutual information (this is shown by the basic theorem
I(A;B) = I(B;A)), this poses no problem for my account
whatever; the needed asymmetry is instead secured by
the dynamics of the perceptualâbehavioral control loop
(Section 10). Finally, it may fairly be protested that my
account attributes much more to intentionality than mere
maximization of mutual information. The (admittedly
rather "gadgety") stage-wise procedure of Section 9 is
part of an effort to say what more there might be.
Whatever the shortcomings of this breakdown into func-
tions, however, and despite Daugman's charge to the
contrary, it bears no resemblance to the abortive attempt
to explain sleep-inducing power by merely applying a
label meaning "sleep-inducing power."
The identity relationship. Those commentators who
probe the nature of the relationship of identity between O
and C (notably Dretske, Ellerman, and Morphis) go right
to the heart of my account. When a representation at C is
intentionally related to an objective structure O, there is
an identity of info(t) at C and O (when, but not only when
- there are countless identity relationships of this sort in
nature that do not even approximate intentionality). The
nature of the identity here is perhaps clearest in the case
of a noiseless channel, where the probability of a given
event occurring at the input is mathematically the same as
that of an indication of that event at the output. In this
limiting case, the entire amount of info(t) received at the
output is identical to the info(t) entered at the input. In a
channel with noise, on the other hand, not all the info(t) at
the input is transmitted through to the output; but some is
nonetheless, otherwise the input and the output sets
would not constitute an information channel. Indeed, the
terminology of identity is just another way of talking
about mutual information, which any channel must pos-
sess in some degree to be an information channel in the
first place. The amount of info(t) indicated identically at
input and output, of course, varies from channel to
channel, being equivalent to the overlap of what is indi-
cated at the two termini separately (see Abramson, 1963,
Sections 5-7, for details). My proposal, in briefest possi-
ble summary, is that when a representation C is estab-
lished in the cortex that adequately serves the function of
focusing the organism's behavior on a particular objective
structure O at the other end of the perceptual channel O-
C, then the identity of info(t) at the two termini of this
channel constitutes the relationship of intentionality be-
tween C and O. To explain how this relationship between
C and O is established in the perceptual data processing
of an organism is, in Dennett's apt phrase, "to turn the
corner . . . from info(t) to info(s)." Unclear as my "cor-
ner-turning" may be to Dennett and others, this at least is
what it's all about.
Accordingly, I must reject Dretske's gloss in proposing
that what I want to say is that, in the perception of a
yellow flower, the "information that there is a yellow
flower out there " is identically present at the cortex, in
the retina, and "out there" as well. What I mean by
"identity" in this connection has nothing to do with
propositional content (that so and so) and everything to do
with the sameness of info(t) present at these several
junctures in the technical sense of MTC. Although propo-
sitional contents may be very much on the scene in higher
level cognition, I do not think they have much to do with
visual perception as such (seeing a yellow flower is not the
160
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

Response/ Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
same as seeing that the flower is yellow). Ellerman quotes
my summary remark in Section 10 that the intentionality
of perception is the identity of info(t) structure between O
and C (overlooking the essential qualifications that imme-
diately follow) and proceeds to construct an alleged coun-
terexample to what he takes to be the "best possible case"
illustrating that summary remark. The supposed "best
possible case" is a noiseless and deterministic channel in
which all and only Is at the input are indicated by Is at the
output, and all and only 0s by 0s at the output. The
counterexample is a channel with the same characteristics
except that all and only Is at the input are indicated by 0s
at the output, and vice versa for input 0s. The reason this
is supposed to be a counterexample is that, although the
mutual information of the two channels is the same (which
it is), the first channel is such that 1 at the output means 1
at the input to an observer who knows the channel
characteristics, whereas with the second channel a 1 at
the output means a 0 at the input. That is, the mutual
information is the same, but the meanings differ; hence
intentionality cannot be a matter of mutual information.
This argument fails for two reasons (besides overlooking
the qualifications that tell a good share of the story). First,
the presence of an observer who interprets the output
signals is entirely extraneous to my account and indeed
could not be incorporated in it (without circularity) even if
one tried. And second, as far as every channel feature
germane to my account is concerned, Ellerman's two
cases are indistinguishable, differing only in matters of
notation that have nothing to do with channel
specifications.
Morphis is right in detecting the essentially mathe-
matical character of the identity relationship but sees no
advantage in this account over variations of the "robot
reply" discussed in Searle (1980a). Ellerman and Heil
also identify my account as a version of the "robot reply."
Although this account was not intended as a response to
Searle's challenge, I would like to speak briefly to that
issue.
The "robot reply." The argument of Heil against my
account of perceptual intentionality proceeds by (1) tak-
ing it for granted that I propose to locate intentional
content inside the organism, (2) construing my account
as an embellishment of Searle's Chinese-room thought
experiment (specifically, as a version of the "robot reply"
to Searle's argument), (3) generalizing beyond the ma-
nipulation of symbols (like those of the Chinese alpha-
bet) whose intentionality is derivative to any code sys-
tem whatever, and (4) drawing the familiar conclusion
that nowhere in all this is intentionality to be found. This
rendition of my account has the fault of laying it open to
criticism for not providing adequate answers to ques-
tions it never addresses. For one thing, my account of
perceptual intentionality is not a version of the "robot
reply" because I am not coming to the defense of "strong
AI." Indeed, Section 3 should make it quite clear that I
support Searle's side in the controversy. Yet I am urging
that perceptual intentionality arises nonderivatively in a
complex interaction between biological organism and
perceptual environment - an interaction complex
enough to encompass all the environmental, biological,
and social factors Heil cites as germane to an adequate
account. And because there is no apparent reason why
the info(t) processes implicated in my account could not
be performed by entirely mechanical as well as biological
systems, it follows that an artificial system interacting in
these complex ways with the world at large might also be
endowed with perceptual intentionality in the same way
as human percipients.
So why, with that admission, is my account not just
another version of the "robot reply?" For one reason,
because my account is of perceptual intentionality, and
not of understanding (linguistic symbols or whatever),
which is the focus of Searle's discussion. A second and
more important reason is because my account does not
locate intentionality inside the perceiving system in the
first place. The representation possessing intentional
content is inside the system, of course. But its object is
typically outside the system; and if by "intentionality
content" we mean the object, as I propose, then this
content is not inside the system as Heil surmises. From a
perspective like mine that stresses the real-time dynamic
interaction between organism and environment as the
locus of the intentional relationship, the thesis of "strong
AI" seems so implausible that one wonders at the fuss
Searle's argument has occasioned.
One thing my account has in common with the "robot
reply," however, is that it features what certainly appears
to be a causal interaction between organism and environ-
ment. Heil, Morphis, and Ellerman may have consid-
ered this sufficient warrant for grouping it with that
position. Churchland also brings up the matter of causal
interaction. There are issues here that deserve further
discussion.
Causal interaction. In his brief but penetrating commen-
tary, Kelley suggests that if my account is confirmed by
neuroscience the result might be a comprehensive theory
of how the nervous system gives rise to intentional states.
He believes, however, that my "stronger claim" that
intentionality is a relationship of high mutual information
between a cortical representation and a set of objective
circumstances runs afoul of a "classic problem" for causal
theories of perception. In general, causal theories identi-
fy the object of a perception with its cause but have
trouble separating the object proper from other causal
antecedents. By way of solution, causal theorists typically
lay down other conditions to pick out the intentional
object; and my conditions, as Kelley observes, have to do
with an identity of info(t) structure between O and C. But
since R has a share in that identity also, why isn't the
structure at R as much the intentional object as that at O?
This is a good question.
Kelley even knows the answer I want to defend, which
is roughly that the perceptual system "locks on to" and
"tracks" the structure O in the objective environment.
The fuller answer in Section 9 makes use of the concept of
a perceptual-behavioral control loop between C and O,
which enables the organism to direct its behavior with
respect to those objective circumstances. Kelley's objec-
tion to this answer is that the perceptual process per-
sumably does this by locking on to and tracking the retinal
events R as well. But this is not the case at all. The
mediating events at R are only part of a complex series of
info(t) processes by which the perceptual system main-
tains its focus upon O wihtout exceeding the limits of its
information-processing capacities. There is no sense at
THE BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1986) 9:1

Response/Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
all, as far as my account allows, in which the perceptual-
behaviorial control loop maintains a focus on R. Making
sense of this would require the organism to be directing
its behavior toward, or with respect to, events in its retina
instead. Even if the organism were conducting eye sur-
gery on itself, or trying to view its retina in a mirror, the
perceptual object O would consist of events at the surface
of the eye itself and not the neurophysiological events at R
by which its behavior is being partially guided. Very
likely my account requires further development to stand
as a solution to all the "classic" problems, but this one at
least seems not particularly dire.
Heil also raises an interesting problem in connection
with the causal aspects of my account. Observing that the
info(t)-processing channels in my account do not require
any particular causal linkage (strictly, do not require any
causal linkage at all, because informational nad not causal
connections do the work of the theory), he believes this
opens it up to familiar Twin Earth-type counterexam-
ples. If Smith is looking at banana b on Earth, and his
Doppelganger Smythe is undergoing exactly the same
neural transformations on Twin Earth, why is not Smythe
as well as Smith looking at b? Heil claims that the answer I
want to give is unavailable. I want to say, in line with my
previous response to Kelley, that Smith perceives b
because b is the object with respect to which his behavior
is directed through the operation of his perceptual-
behavioral control loop, and that Smythe does not per-
ceive b because his behavior is not so directed. This
seems simple enough, but Heil says it misses the diffi-
culty. As best I can make out, the difficulty is that the
object of perception - Heil's "appropriate object" - must
be specified independently of being identified with the
object toward which behavior is directed. I suspect that
what Heil has in mind here is the familiar requirement
confronting any mind-brain identity thesis that claims
identity between brain state B and mental state M: if the
claim that B = M is to have empirical content (not be
merely tautological), there must be some way of specify-
ing either state independently of the other. But if there is
a requirement of this sort facing my account, it is satisfied
by the facts that (1) the neurophysiological processes are
supposed (as Kelley saw) to be empirically specifiable,
and (2) the mental component â the intentional direction
of C upon O - is specified as a relationship between
factors at opposite ends of the perceptual-behavioral
control loop. If there is an additional requirement that O
be specified independently of this control loop, I confess I
cannot understand it. Perhaps Heil's sense that there is a
problem here could be dispelled by realizing that the only
identity to which my account is committed is the mathe-
matical identity (as Morphis and Ellerman saw) between
info(t) structures at C and O, which is not the sort of
identity ("contingent") involved in mind-brain identity
theses at all.
With these considerations in view, I trust that Eller-
man will conclude that my account does not confuse
meaning and cause as he seems to suspect, and that
Churchland will find further reason to be assured
that there are no causal presuppositions in my account
that would produce tension with his "network" approach
to cognitive phenomena.
Heil raises the further objection that my account does
not give semantic content any role to play in the system,
which I gather means that it does not rely on semantic
content to explain anything else. This is correct. My
account concerns the genesis of such content (as Kelley
clearly saw), with only afterthoughts about the roles
intentional content might play in higher cognitive func-
tions. If the conjectures of Section 11 are even roughly on
the right track, however, there is much for it to explain on
these higher levels. I turn once again to these topics, and
once again only briefly.
Postscript revisited. It would have been preferred by
Dretske that I pay more attention to the higher level
cognitive functions about which he says so much in his
1981 work, and he gently rebukes me for having prefaced
what little I do say about them in Section 11 with the
disclaimer "not intended for critical discussion." What
this disclaimer means is simply that the conjectures of this
section are not developed in enough detail to be defended
as they stand, and that they are unaccompanied by any
discussion of the many issues they raise. Dretske none-
theless chooses to raise some of them for me. I do not
think him unfair for having done so, and I welcome the
chance to say just a bit more on these topics (relying upon
the reader to realize that the bit more I can say in a few
paragraphs is not enough to remove the disclaimer).
What I owe Dretske is (1) a somewhat fuller account of
how the intentionality of perception differs from that of
thought and belief, (2) some thoughts about how mis-
representation is possible on these different cognitive
levels, and (3) a brief explanation of the "casualness" of
the target article with regard to these issues.
(1) To begin with, the intentionality of perception as I
portray it is a matter of being directed upon or about a
specific object, and not of being an attitude toward a
propositional content (because perception as I see it is not
a propositional attitude). As Dretske notes, I certainly
talk this (the former) way at times; indeed, I intended to
talk that way all the time. Being of this character, percep-
tual intentionality involves the perceptual presence of the
object to the perceiving organism and thus clearly differs
from the intentionality of thoughts and beliefs about
objects that are not perceptually present. Perceptual
intentionality, by this account, consists in an adequately
high level of mutual information between C and O under
certain conditions having to do with the perceptual con-
trol of the organism's behavior toward O - where "ade-
quately high" means adequate to maintain perceptual
control under those conditions. No particular difficulty is
posed for this account by Dretske's case of seeing a flower
at a distance and in poor light. If one's behavioral project
were merely to find some flowers to make up a bouquet
for the dinner table, the relatively low level of mutual
information these circumstances provide might well suf-
fice - which it presumably would not in a percpetually
more demanding project, like finding a coreopsis in a field
of wild daisies. (Dretske is right, by the way, in pointing
out that the kind of picking out in question is not a matter
of distinguishing a particular object from all others of its
kind; for him to perceive his cousin Clyde it is clearly not
necessary that he notice details sufficient to distinguish
Clyde from Clyde's twin brother. The picking out in
question is a matter of distinguishing the particular object
with which one currently is occupied from other objects
in one's perceptual field.)

References/Sayre: Intentionality and information processing
Now, if the percept "yellow" gets its intentionality by
picking out perceptually present objects in this fashion,
Dretske asks, how can meanings or concepts manage to
be about yellow when nothing yellow is perceptually
present? Because he thinks the answer I sketch in Section
11 is an evasion, I will try to sketch the outlines of an
equivalent answer in somewhat different strokes. First,
once a stable pattern C has been established in the
percipient's cortex, the object O need not remain percep-
tually present for it to continue to enjoy a relation of high
mutual information with C. Although O must of course be
perceptually present to stand in a relation of perceptual
intentionality with C - that is, it must be perceptually
present in order to be perceived - there are no require-
ments of perceptual presence attached to the relation of
mutual information itself. Although Smythe in Heil's
example is not perceiving'Smith's banana, the events in
Smythe's cortex (being identical to those in Smith's) are
nonetheless characterized with the same mutual informa-
tion with respect to events at the banana's surface. Since
Smythe is on Twin Earth, he cannot see Smith's banana;
but nothing in the imagined facts of the case prevents his
speaking or thinking about it. Second, a well-established
pattern C may retain its capacity for guiding behavior
with respect to an object O even when that object is not
perceptually present. When I am looking for my watch,
for example, my perceptual field is constantly being
tested for fit with a pattern representing that object in
thought, and my behavior is guided by the anticipation of
coming to perceive an object fulfilling the conditions of
fitting that object - conditions to be spelled out in terms
of mutual information. In looking for something, I am not
perceiving it; yet the pattern that once picked out that
object in perception may now pick it out as part of another
cognitive function - in this case, thoughtfully directed (as
distinct from random) searching. Third, when represen-
tations once active exclusively in perception become
associated with other representations in meaning rela-
tionships - which happens when people begin to direct
their cooperative ventures with vocal signals - then the
cooperating individuals begin to form conceptual net-
works like those (I take it) stressed in Churchland's
commentary. For more about how I view these networks,
the interested and patient reader may consult Chapters
11 and 12 of Sayre (1976).
(2) How, given this general view of representation, is
misrepresentation possible? With trepidation, I offer the
following for Dretske to consider. In the case of percepts,
misrepresentation is a matter of bringing an established
pattern to bear (out of Percept Storage; Section 9.3) that
initially shows enough fit with structures currently pre-
sent in the percipient's perceptual field to set up expecta-
tions regarding further encounters with these objective
structures, which expectations are subsequently thwart-
ed. When the initially promising fit is not sustained as
perceptually based dealings with the object unfold, the
initially promising pattern is proved a misfit - that is, a
misrepresentation. Mistake in belief requires a different
story. Since by my lights a belief is not a representation in
the first place, a mistaken belief is not a misrepresenta-
tion. A belief, rather, is a state of mind involving read-
iness to use concepts in any one of multifarious ways, and
a mistaken belief is a readiness to use concepts incor-
rectly. This indicates the direction in which I suspect a
proper answer to the problem of misrepresentation is to
be found, but it contributes little to the answer itself.
(3) How can I be so casual in addressing these issues,
whereas for Dretske misrepresentation is such a central
problem? For him, in fact, the problem is crucial, be-
cause it affects the very cogency of the account of informa-
tional content that stands at the heart of his analyses of
knowledge and belief. For an internal structure (repre-
sentation) to carry the information that s is F (Dretske
1983, p. 57, my emphasis) is for all tokens of that structure
to carry that information, which at least appears to rule
out the possibility that some of those tokens fail to carry
that information as his account of false belief requires (see
my commentary on Dretske, 1983a; Sayre 1983, p. 79).
Dretske's account lands in this predicament, if I read it
correctly, largely because of his conception of information
content as propositional (that s if F). Because information
in my account is not propositional (not even info(s), as far
as perception is concerned), the problem of misrepresen-
tation does not challenge the cogency of the account
overall. It can safely be postponed to another occasion.
