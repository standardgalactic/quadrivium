ETHICAL HACKING CASE STUDIES
USING CHATGPT
ChatGPT demonstrated its ability to analyze
internal communications and detect suspicious
patterns indicative of insider threats.
ChatGPT's real-time analysis of incoming emails
for phishing indicators served as an effective
defense 
mechanism, 
preventing 
multiple
phishing 
attempts 
by 
flagging 
suspicious
messages. 
AI, represented by ChatGPT, was employed to
audit 
smart 
contracts 
on 
a 
blockchain,
identifying vulnerabilities that could have led to
significant financial losses.
