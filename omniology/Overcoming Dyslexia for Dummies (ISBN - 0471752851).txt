About the Author
Tracey Wood was born in England. She went to teachers college in Leeds and
graduated with an honors degree in psychology and education. She taught in
a special school for four years and loved it. But sunnier climes called, and
she left England for a backpacking vacation in Australia. Twelve years later
she was still enjoying the warmth of Australia but had traded her backpack
for a husband and two kids.
In Australia, Tracey earned a diploma in special education and a master’s
degree in education. For several years she ran a high school special educa-
tion unit and then started her own reading clinic. In the 1990s Tracey moved
(with her husband’s job) to the San Francisco Bay area. She ran a reading and
writing clinic; helped in her kids’ school; led two scouting troops; instructed
for the Red Cross; created her Web site, ReadingPains.com; and wrote her
first book, See Johnny Read! The 5 Most Effective Ways To End Your Son’s
Reading Problems.
Still on the move, Tracey relocated to Toronto and wrote her second and
third books, Teaching Kids to Read For Dummies and Teaching Kids to Spell
For Dummies. While writing Overcoming Dyslexia For Dummies, she relocated
again, to Boston.
Tracey is a literacy consultant and public speaker. She writes articles for
magazines like Big Apple Parent and Teachers of Vision, has appeared
on Access Help TV and national radio shows like Parent’s Journal and
The Parent’s Report, and is committed to steering (albeit unsteadily) her
two children through childhood with all their limbs and faculties intact.


Dedication
My gorgeous girls: I know you didn’t get a choice, but thanks anyway for putting
up with the moods that I blame on artistic temperament, the stories that I tell
with artistic license, and my unreliable cooking. Pretty much everything I do
feels better because of you and is dedicated to you (both of you, equally!).
Author’s Acknowledgments
They say it takes a village to raise a child, and in my opinion, much the same
is true of bringing a book into being. My village is small, but the hearts and
talent in it are big:
David Futterman, a university instructor, high school teacher, educational
therapist, and active member of the International Dyslexia Association,
has experience and qualifications galore in dyslexia. He’s also very nice.
Thank you a zillionfold, David, for being my right-hand man with this book.
Hope you enjoyed the view.
As well as answering every one of my questions and finding plenty of my 
mistakes, David introduced me to Kathy Futterman, who took time out of
her busy teaching and parenting schedule to road-test some products for me.
Kathy, I so appreciated your help!
As I wrote this book, several things happened: School vacation came around,
landing me with two noisy, easily bored, and frequently hungry kids; I painted,
plastered, scrubbed, and finally sold a house; and I bought a new house a whole
ten-hour drive away. Over those months, a few stalwart friends painted and
scraped with me, lured me from my computer to party and gamble (now I’ve
exposed you to the world!) and whisked my children off at opportune times
when I didn’t care where or for how long. Valarie Cowton, Kelly Borden, and
Phyllis Perry, you’re the best!
And last but never least, Therese Hughes, Frances Faflik, and Liam O’Connor.
Thanks for always being on the sidelines.

Introduction
You’ve picked up this book because you’re concerned about your child.
He isn’t keeping up in class, hates to read, and makes spelling errors
even in simple words. Is he dyslexic? Should you be asking for an assess-
ment? What can you do to help him at home?
Or maybe you’re flicking through these pages for yourself. When you were at
school, you felt dumb, and now you avoid reading and hate to write. You’re
wondering whether you should call yourself “dyslexic” and, if you do, whether
it will make much difference in your life. I hear you! You need straightforward,
practical, upbeat advice.
I spend my (happy and ever-so-rewarding) working life helping dyslexic chil-
dren and adults. I know I change lives. Sincerely, warmly, and rather proudly,
I offer you this book so you too can make a difference.
About This Book
In this book, I give you all the relevant information and cut the rest. I don’t
bury you under a mound of theories, lose you in terminology, or wear you
out with alternatives. I don’t preach, prattle, or pretend there’s always one
definitive answer. Instead, I give you honest information about the stuff that
matters. And I move you quickly from theory to practice.
You get hands-on activities your child can start straight away, strategies that
are good for his whole lifetime, and handy tips for dealing with daily prob-
lems (like how to help him get organized and keep his b’s and d’s facing the
right way once and for all). For teens and adults, I give the scoop on things
like note taking, applying to college, and succeeding in the workforce. And to
keep you on the ball with current research, you get news about brain map-
ping, dyslexia therapies, and the reading programs most educators prefer.
Whether you’re just beginning to consider the term dyslexia or you’ve already
done some research; whether you’ve got your child’s IEP underway or you’ve
never heard of an IEP; whether you want reassurance, practical strategies, or
legal details made easy, this book is for you. Surf through it or immerse your-
self chapter by chapter, as you need. The chapters in this book let you pick and

choose, but they also follow a logical progression. There’s so much information
in here that you’re sure to get the guidance you’re looking for. And whatever
your needs and interests, you’ll love the Part of Tens, where you get quick
lists, each of ten items, of really handy stuff.
Conventions Used in This Book
To he or not to he? In this book, I clean up that sticky dilemma by using he and
she in alternate chapters. You can be sure this book is for everyone, and once
you’re used to the idea of switching between he and she, you’ll probably end
up thinking all other books should do the same.
In this book, I give you a lot of current prices for materials, therapy, tutoring,
and more. These prices can change over time, so use them as your guide rather
than as set-in-stone facts.
I feature a few other conventions to help you work your way through this book:
 Italic points out defined terms or emphasizes a word.
 Boldface text indicates keywords in bulleted lists and the action part of
numbered steps.
 Monofont highlights Web addresses.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that we haven’t put in
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book,
pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.
And here’s one more fact that you should know before you fully dive into
this book: A lot of the information about testing and all the information on
Individualized Education Programs (see Chapters 6 and 8, respectively)
apply only to public (federally funded) schools.
What You’re Not to Read
A lot of books about dyslexia seem to revel in technical jargon. This book
doesn’t. It gives you the jargon, sparingly, and warns you in advance with
2
Overcoming Dyslexia For Dummies 

the Technical Stuff icon so that you don’t have to read it if you don’t want to.
Don’t let the jargon scare you though; it’s there in case you need to assert
yourself or write smart requests, applications, and other formal stuff. The
Technical Stuff icon also highlights info that’s interesting but not crucial to
your understanding of dyslexia.
As well as bits of jargon, you’re going to see sidebars in this book (they’re in
the shaded gray boxes). Sidebars offer bonus or additional information that
you don’t have to read but may enjoy all the same.
Foolish Assumptions
Because you’re reading this book, I’m assuming the following about you:
 You’d like to help a child, or yourself, better understand dyslexia. You may
be the parent of a child or a young adult who’s having difficulty reading
and may be dyslexic, or you may be a teacher looking for information so
you can help dyslexic students and their parents. You may even be an
adult looking for tips for yourself.
 You need plain-talking, down-to-earth guidance about things like your
rights and the kinds of strategies that can make your life easier.
 You’d like pointers of how to get things right but not reams of jargon.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has six parts, all filled to the brim with information about dyslexia.
Part I: Figuring Out What 
Dyslexia Is All About
In this part, I establish exactly what dyslexia does and doesn’t mean. The
“doesn’t” part is important because, as many educators point out, the term
dyslexia gets so overused that its meaning can be obscured. I also talk about
the causes and types of dyslexia and give you an overview of the symptoms
to watch out for at any age.
3
Introduction

Part II: Determining When 
to Get a Diagnosis
In this part, it’s time to look more closely at the signs of dyslexia. I examine
your child’s behavior in the preschool and school years and show you when
and how to get an assessment.
Part III: Exploring Your Options 
for Schools and Programs
Your child struggles every day in class, but would he do any better in another
class or even another school? How much does private tutoring cost, and are
some learning centers better for your child than others? How can you make
sure that your dyslexic child has a good Individualized Education Program
(IEP), and what can you do to make schoolwork easier for him if he doesn’t
have an IEP? And how can you work effectively with your child’s teacher?
In this part, I answer your big questions.
Part IV: Taking Part in Your 
Child’s Treatment
Most treatment for dyslexia involves structured multisensory and phonics-
based instruction. Not sure what I’m talking about? That’s fine. This part of
the book explains it all in simple, straightforward terms that you can feel
completely comfortable with. I also tell you about methods of memorizing,
visualizing, and rhyming to help your child read more fluently; show you
how to establish a happy reading routine; and give you tips to help your
child accomplish everyday tasks easily.
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years
Anyone who’s been through high school in the last few decades has heard
(at least a little) about stuff like portfolios, community service, and college
entrance exams. In this part I tell you what dyslexics do to make these kinds
of things less formidable during the college application process. I also give
you the lowdown on helping your dyslexic child adjust to the teen years and
show adult dyslexics how to be more successful in the real world.
4
Overcoming Dyslexia For Dummies 

Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is where a whole bunch of useful information gets boiled down
to wonderfully easy lists. Here you get ten tools for making a dyslexic’s life
easier and ten dyslexia treatments and programs.
Part VII: Appendixes
In Part VII, I leave you with a battery of tests so you can determine your child’s
grasp on phonics skills, and I also include a handy reference guide to a variety
of dyslexia resources.
Icons Used in This Book
The following icons highlight noteworthy information throughout the book.
This icon tells you that a piece of advice or an activity is good for adults as
well as (or instead of) younger little beings.
You’ll see this icon when I offer information that’s really worth hanging onto.
Here’s your alert to interesting but nonessential information (such as jargon).
Skip ahead or brace yourself!
This icon means I’m offering a golden nugget of handy advice, probably
learned firsthand.
Here’s something you don’t want to do. This icon warns you of the land mines
that you may encounter.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
If you’re not sure whether your child needs an assessment for dyslexia, you’ve
come to the right place. Go to Chapter 3 to learn about general indicators of
dyslexia, Chapter 4 for specific signs you may see during the preschool and
kindergarten years, or Chapter 5 for signs of dyslexia that surface (or don’t
go away) later in school. Chapter 6 has details on testing.
If your child has already been diagnosed as dyslexic and is eligible for extra
help, or an Individualized Education Program, at school, go to Chapter 8. If you
know that your dyslexic child doesn’t get an IEP and you want to know what
options are left, skip ahead to Chapter 9. To get straight into doing your own
reading activities, open up at Chapter 13.
Not in that much of a rush? Great! You’ll enjoy the traditional journey through
this book, starting at Chapter 1 and working through. Take your time, and
especially mull over points that apply exactly to you. This is your map for
guiding your dyslexic child surely forward.

Figuring Out What
Dyslexia Is 
All About

In this part . . .
T
his book contains a tremendous amount of information,
so in this part I help you get off on the right foot with
some basic but essential facts. First, you find out what
dyslexia really means (and what it doesn’t mean). I cover
its possible causes and the different forms that it takes.
Then, when you’re revving, I show you how dyslexia may
be indicated in your child’s behavior, no matter how old
he is. Got your water and sensible footwear? Off you go!

T
oday in a bookstore, I got held up in the magazines section. The prob-
lem was that I just couldn’t decide what topic appealed to me the most:
“Sixteen foods to make me stronger, happier, sexier, and smarter,” “Ten minutes
to a flatter belly,” or “Eat around the clock.” Wouldn’t it be nice if this book
offered you a similar approach to dyslexia, with topics such as “Sixteen sure-
fire ways to outsmart dyslexia,” “Ten minutes to perfect reading and spelling,”
and “Raising a reader without lifting a finger”?
But in real life, people like to hear the truth. So in this book I give you the
plain and simple truth about dyslexia — not the shortcut answers like you
might find in those magazines I saw. And it all starts in this chapter with an
easy-as-pie outline of what dyslexia really is, a simple sketch of how it shapes
your child’s life, and a lightning tour of the programs and treatments you can
find in and out of the classroom.

Defining Dyslexia in Plain Terms
Plenty of children struggle with reading. Their parents get extra help for them,
and after a few months, they catch up. Sometimes the problem disappears
suddenly without any intervention at all.
Dyslexia isn’t like that. If you’re wondering whether your child has reading
problems or dyslexia, and what the difference is, here’s the simple answer:
A child with dyslexia has enduring and unexpected difficulty with reading and
writing. She’s bright, you give her loads of extra help, but she just doesn’t get
it. A blast of extra help won’t make everything right for her because she needs
a different kind of help over a longer time than just a few months. She’ll prob-
ably learn to read and write at about age 10, but all through her life she’ll need
to read and reread written text several times before she fully comprehends
what she’s read. In addition, when she writes important stuff, she’ll need to
complete several drafts.
Watch out: Misconceptions about dyslexia abound. Here’s what dyslexia isn’t:
 Stupidity
 Laziness
 Retardation
 Brain damage
 Willfulness
 Distractibility
Research about dyslexia provides insight into the possible causes of dyslexia.
For instance, dyslexics use a different part of the brain when they read than
nondyslexics do, and they use more of it. Dyslexia also tends to run in families.
And some psychologists break dyslexia down into several types, including
phonological dyslexia and visual dyslexia.
In Chapter 2, I give you the full scoop about the definition, causes, and types
of dyslexia. I also tell you about different conditions related to (and often mis-
taken for) dyslexia.
Dyslexia shouldn’t prevent your child from achieving her goals or dreams.
Plenty of professors are dyslexic. They have strategies and routines that help
them achieve high standards. Oh, and your child may like to know that famous
folks like Tom Cruise and Orlando Bloom (Hollywood actors) and Steve Jobs
(CEO of Apple Computers) are just three of the many high-flyers who have
dyslexia.
10
Part I: Figuring Out What Dyslexia Is All About 

Zeroing In on the Symptoms of Dyslexia
Here’s the thing about dyslexia. One teacher or psychologist may tell you
your child lacks “automaticity of language,” or perhaps “auditory perceptual
skills,” while another tells you she has “dyslexia.” Some practitioners never
use the term “dyslexia,” but psychologists who do diagnose it look for a fairly
standard bunch of symptoms. Different symptoms reveal themselves at differ-
ent ages.
The kinds of behaviors that indicate dyslexia in a preschooler include the 
following:
 Starts to speak late (no actual speech until after age 2)
 Says muddled-up words (aminal for animal or gabrage for garbage)
 Doesn’t enjoy being read to
 Can’t tell you rhyming words (cat/hat)
 Can’t tell the difference between letters and other symbols or squiggles
The kinds of behaviors that indicate dyslexia in a school-age child include the
following:
 Writes words with letters in the wrong places, like saw instead of was
and vawe instead of wave (called transposing letters)
 Reverses letters and numbers (especially b and d, p and q, and 3 and 5)
 Writes so that her words are barely legible (letters are badly formed and
the wrong size)
 Adds or leaves out small words when reading (which can totally change
the meaning of the text)
 Has trouble retelling a story
For now, the main thing to keep in mind is that dyslexia, unless it runs in your
family, can hit you like a shot out of the blue. Your child seems fine, or even
advanced intellectually, so you just don’t expect her to stumble with reading
and writing. That stumble, from which your child seems unable to recover, is
what dyslexia typically looks like.
In Chapter 3, I give you an overview of dyslexia symptoms at any age. I focus
on symptoms in preschoolers and what to do about them in Chapter 4 and on
symptoms in school-age kids and how to take action in Chapter 5.
11
Chapter 1: Understanding the Basics of Dyslexia

Keep in mind that undiagnosed teenagers and adults also show a few
common signs of dyslexia, including a diehard avoidance of reading
and plenty of diversionary tactics for steering clear of handwriting. See
Chapter 3 for details.
Deciding When to Have 
Your Child Tested
If you’re worried that your child isn’t getting the hang of reading, chances are
your fears are well founded. It’s better to get professional advice than to waste
precious months wondering whether your concerns are valid. If it turns out
that your child has dyslexia, or any other learning difficulty, the sooner you
get a diagnosis the better.
That said, you can’t whisk your child off to a psychologist for a dyslexia assess-
ment much before she turns 5, because dyslexia is mostly about how well she
reads. When she starts school and struggles with the alphabet, speech sounds,
and text, it’s time to quickly have her assessed so you can quickly start the
intervention that can help her most.
The tests that your child can undergo (depending on her age) include the 
following:
 Language tests
 Vision and hearing tests
 Early screening tests
 IQ tests
 Performance tests
 A full test battery
The person who usually runs a full assessment for dyslexia is a psychologist.
Your public school district employs an educational psychologist whose serv-
ices you get for free (after making a written request for assessment). If you
want an outside or second opinion, you can ask the district for a listing of 
private psychologists in your area. If your child attends a private school, she
doesn’t automatically get any of these services. Private schools make their own
autonomous decisions about how they provide assessment and treatment for
dyslexia and, unlike public schools, aren’t legally obligated to provide assess-
ment and an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for children who qualify
for special education.
For full details on testing, including how to prepare your child for an assess-
ment and what to do with the results, check out Chapter 6.
12
Part I: Figuring Out What Dyslexia Is All About 

Exploring Different Schools and 
Programs for Your Child
You (of course) want the best education possible for your child, but finding
the best school for her becomes even more important after she’s diagnosed
as dyslexic. In Chapter 7, I help you figure out whether your child’s current
school is doing a good job and what kinds of help other schools may offer you.
I provide you with a list of questions to consider as you decide what kind of
school you want your child to attend. I also introduce you to the services and
staff members you find at a traditional public school and give you the lowdown
on the following forms of alternative schooling:
 Charter schools
 Magnet schools
 Private schools
 Montessori schools
 Waldorf (Steiner) schools
 Schools for dyslexics
 Home schooling
If your child’s dyslexia diagnosis qualifies her for special education in school,
she receives an Individualized Education Program (IEP). In Chapter 8, I give you
the full scoop on IEPs, including the actual fine print on the IEP document, what
to expect at an IEP meeting, and how to prepare for it. This preparation includes
speaking with your child’s teacher, making lists and gathering important doc-
uments, and making sure that you have supportive folks with you. I also cover
the acts that govern IEPs (the main one is the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act, or IDEA) and let you know your child’s rights under these acts.
In public schools you have the legal right to an IEP if your child is found to
have a learning disability. You don’t get this legal cover in a private school;
each individual private school makes its own autonomous decisions.
What if your child doesn’t receive an IEP? Don’t worry. In Chapter 9, I tell you
how to secure help without one. In school, you can stay in close contact with
your child’s teacher and enroll your child in homework clubs, tutoring pro-
grams, and extracurricular activities that make her feel confident. Outside
school, you have several options for strengthening your child’s reading abilities:
 Dyslexia therapies
 Reading clinics specializing in helping dyslexic folks
 Private, individual tutors
 General learning centers
13
Chapter 1: Understanding the Basics of Dyslexia

Of course, you can also offer your help at home by helping your child manage
her homework and setting her up with lots of handy gizmos (including those
I mention in Chapter 19).
Whether or not your child has an IEP, sometimes you may feel like you have
absolutely no control over what your child does in class. The teacher assigns
work, your child struggles with it, and the process moves on like an avalanche
you can’t avert or escape. Well, ta-da! I’m here with fancy underground sensors
and a helicopter to help you! You really can influence what happens to your
child in school; you just need to know how.
In Chapter 10, I tell you how to team up with your child’s teacher with regular
conferences, make all the accommodations you want seem beneficial to every-
one, and keep a paper trail so your nice manner has some oomph behind it.
Sound easy? Ah ha, maybe you’ve been lucky. At some point in your child’s
schooling you may find yourself worrying that your child is learning more
about frustration than anything else, and that’s where this book comes in
really handy. In these pages, you get step-by-step guidance for avoiding dis-
putes with teachers and pressing your point reasonably, and you get places
to go should you find yourself locked in combat anyway.
Helping Your Child with 
Activities at Home
You’ve probably heard advice that tells you to help your dyslexic child at
home by doing the following:
 Reading a lot of books with her
 Doing a lot of hands-on activities with her
 Telling her all the time how terrific she is
That advice is good. But it’s a bit, well, obvious. And besides, it’s vague. What
kinds of books should she read? Should you think up your own stimulating
activities (in between cooking meals, doing the soccer run, and oh, yes, going
to work)? And what if your child knows you’re telling her she’s great simply
because the parenting books tell you to say so? What do you do then?
In Part IV of this book, you get specific, practical advice on the following
ways that you can take part in your child’s dyslexia treatment.
 You can use great memorizing, visualizing, and rhyming tricks to help
your child learn words fast. I cover these methods in Chapter 11, along
with a list of 220 common sight words that appear frequently in all writ-
ten text.
14
Part I: Figuring Out What Dyslexia Is All About 

 A knowledge of phonics is crucial to reading effectively. In Chapter 12,
I provide you with plenty of activities that will help your child get the
hang of sounding out words.
 Practice makes perfect, especially when it comes to reading. In Chapter 13,
I give a variety of reading methods you can use with your child, including
setting up a reading routine, selecting the right books, and handling your
child’s reading errors kindly.
 Multisensory is a big buzzword in the world of dyslexia, but what
exactly does that mean? In a nutshell, multisensory means “hands-on.”
In Chapter 14, I explain the benefits of doing multisensory activities as
part of your child’s education.
 Even everyday activities such as staying organized, telling time, and fol-
lowing steps can be difficult for a dyslexic child. In Chapter 15, I show
you how to help your child handle everyday tasks with ease and build
her confidence.
Something especially great is that you get road-tested materials in these
chapters. Instead of impractical suggestions and lists of books as long as
your arm — books that the author may or may not have read — you get
doable ideas and a manageable quota of recommendations that I have 
personally tested or had tested by another parent/teacher. How’s that for
really useful! Get your hands on the best books and kits around and, if your
child’s teacher hasn’t seen them yet, give him the heads up!
Helping your dyslexic child with reading and other activities at home has
multiple benefits. The following are just a few.
 Your dyslexic child may not start to read until about age 10. But she’s
smart and good at coverup, so the rest of the world may think she’s
doing okay. That’s where your help at home really counts. You can get
a firsthand, up-close view of what’s going on and clue in the teacher.
If you don’t clue in the teacher, and especially if your child can sound
out simple words and knows a few sight words, her difficulties may not
show up in school until much later (when all of a sudden pretty much
everyone else but your child reads fluently).
 When your child goes through a hear-see-say-do routine (which I explain
in Chapter 14) with new concepts, they stick in her mind better than when
she does any one of those things on its own. The fancy name for this is
multisensory learning, and in dyslexia circles, boy it’s hot! You can do
some multisensory stuff at home simply by getting your child into useful
habits such as saying out loud stuff she wants to remember and words
she’s copying down.
 Social and sporting interests may be especially important for your
dyslexic child because they give her a chance to excel and be popular.
You can help at home by establishing a schedule that’s strict enough for
homework to get done and flexible enough to cope with play-offs and the
occasional dinner of PB & J sandwiches.

Chapter 1: Understanding the Basics of Dyslexia

Watching Your Dyslexic Child Grow
When my kids were little, I thought other people’s bigger kids were, well, big.
To me they looked capable and self-sufficient. How wrong was that! My kids
are now middle-sized, and they need just as much help from me as they ever
did and, in many ways, more. Back then, the issues I faced seemed easy —
how to divide a lump of modeling clay among friends and stop them from
eating it. Now, however, I have trickier issues to settle. Should I force my shy
child into a soccer team for her own good and what should I do, if anything,
about that heinous “other” kid who trashes my cherub’s school locker?
Your dyslexic child needs your help long after she stops eating clay. She has
subject choices to make, examinations to take, and social events to attend.
She needs your guidance, and later of course, she needs you to gradually
hand the reins over to her. In Part V of this book, you get practical advice
for almost all things. And if I have no idea about something, like where your
dyslexic child should study anthropology, I direct you to people who proba-
bly will know.
Chapter 16 is all about dyslexic teenagers. I tell you how to help her foster
her independence, learn to drive, handle school challenges, and develop
essential work skills.
In Chapter 17, I tell you about getting your dyslexic student into college and
the choices you have for paying for it. You find out about building an impres-
sive portfolio, researching the best majors and schools, filling out college
applications, and more.
Chapter 18 is where I deal with the challenges faced by adult dyslexics. I tell
you about great at-home treatments for adults and the rights you have as an
adult dyslexic in the working world.
It’s all here, so what are you waiting for?

Pinpointing What Dyslexia 
Is (And Isn’t)
In This Chapter
 Describing and defining dyslexia
 Delving into the causes of dyslexia
 Looking at dyslexia by type
 Comparing dyslexia to other disorders
R
esearchers have been studying dyslexia for years. They’ve found that
dyslexia is almost certainly a brain issue, and they know how it mani-
fests in your child’s behavior. In this chapter I give you the detailed picture
of what dyslexia means in practical terms, banish misconceptions about it,
check out its causes, and compare it to similar conditions.
Understanding the Real 
Meaning of “Dyslexia”
In the following sections, I provide a straightforward definition of dyslexia,
clear up misconceptions about dyslexia, and explain dyslexia’s classification
as a learning disability.
Looking at the straight facts
Dyslexia has an easy, literal meaning: trouble with words. Your dyslexic child
has trouble with any combination of reading, writing, and spelling. He’s bright,
you read to him, and he has good teachers, but unexpectedly he just doesn’t
get it.

The word dyslexia has Latin and Greek roots. The “dys” part is Latin for “diffi-
culty,” and “lexis” is Greek for “word.”
Your child may have other difficulties too. He may have trouble understand-
ing directional instructions (left/right and up/down), remembering certain
math facts (sequences of numbers and multiplication tables), and recalling
words when he’s speaking. And for you, his difficulties may all come as a bolt
out of the blue!
But that’s my in-a-nutshell description of dyslexia. Here are a few more key
points about the nature of dyslexia.
 Dyslexia is a disorder that affects your child’s ability to read and write.
A dyslexic child typically has trouble recognizing words, sounding them
out, and spelling them.
 A dyslexic child also often lacks other important language skills. He may
have trouble recalling a sequence of spoken words or instructions and
remembering words that he wants to use.
 Dyslexics lack the ability to discriminate sounds within a word (called
phonological processing).
 Dyslexia is a lifelong condition, but with skilled teaching, your dyslexic
child can learn to read (albeit later than other children) and minimize
the impact that dyslexia has on his life.
 The exact cause of dyslexia is still not completely clear, but studies
show definite brain differences between dyslexics and nondyslexics.
See “Weighing up brain research,” later in this chapter, for more details.
 Dyslexia affects your child’s self-image. It’s easy for him to end up feeling
“dumb” and less capable than he is, so your insight and support is espe-
cially important.
You can receive plenty of additional basic information about dyslexia from
the organizations that I list in Appendix B.
Moving away from common 
misconceptions
Children with dyslexia must learn to overcome, or at least get around, their
problems, which includes not just their own limitations but the attitudes and
ignorance of people around them. Of course doing so is hard — very hard —
but if your child knows the devil he’s dealing with, he has every chance of
laying him to rest.

Part I: Figuring Out What Dyslexia Is All About 

Make sure that your child understands that dyslexia is a brain issue (a few of
his brain wires take different paths than other people’s). This disability makes
it hard for him to read, write, spell, and sometimes do other things too, like
telling left from right and retrieving words he’s had stored in his head for
years. (See “Investigating the Causes of Dyslexia,” later in this chapter, for
more details.) But it’s not plenty of other things that people who don’t know
any better believe it to be. It’s not
 Stupidity
 Laziness
 Retardation
 Brain damage
 Willfulness
 Distractibility
And if your child’s certain of what dyslexia is and isn’t, he can let other
people know too!
Classifying dyslexia as a 
“learning disability”
Dyslexia is a “specific learning disability” (SLD). The “specific” part tells you
that dyslexia specifically affects certain aspects of learning (in the case of
dyslexia, reading and writing). Other specific learning disabilities include
speech and articulation disorders, auditory processing disorders, nonverbal
learning disability, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia, all of which can coexist with
dyslexia.
The International Dyslexia Association (IDA) calls dyslexia a specific learning
disability, and many schools talk only about a “learning disability” (LD) or
“specific learning disability,” not dyslexia. Why? Most school districts cur-
rently use the term SLD in their documentation, so teachers in turn use it.
You may find yourself in a strange situation: An independent psychologist
tells you that your child has dyslexia, but all through the school system, you
talk only of SLD.
If you were to insist that the school define your child as having “dyslexia” and
not the “specific learning disability” written into documents (with no option for
“dyslexia”), it can hamper the process of establishing his eligibility for special
education services (which I cover in Chapter 8).
19
Chapter 2: Pinpointing What Dyslexia Is (And Isn’t)

You probably need to use the term SLD in school, but that doesn’t mean you
have to always use it. Maybe you don’t like the “disability” label? Maybe you
feel that “dyslexia” carries less stigma? Maybe you decide that when you’re in
your child’s school, you’ll talk about his “specific learning disability” to keep
people happy, but to keep yourself and your child happy, you’ll use “dyslexia”
everywhere else.
In this bullet list I whiz you quickly through some pros of using both terms:
 Teachers generally use the term SLD.
 Most school districts use SLD.
 Most learning therapists use SLD.
 “Dyslexia” is like a designer-label learning condition; people think it’s
interesting and don’t equate it with “dumb.”
 “Dyslexia” is specific; it delineates your child from kids who are poor
readers for other reasons.
People who don’t like to use either term (dyslexia or SLD) talk about things
like “learning differences,” “learning difficulties,” or “learning style issues.”
Investigating the Causes of Dyslexia
Current studies suggest that about 20 percent of the population has a reading
disability, and of those, most have dyslexia. Dyslexia occurs in people of all
races, backgrounds, and intellectual levels. In the next sections, I walk you,
step by step, through insights that research and experience have given us on
the causes.
Weighing up brain research
The International Dyslexia Association (IDA) makes no bones about the ori-
gins of dyslexia. Umpteen studies show it, and IDA says it outright: Dyslexia is
neurological in origin.
So there you have it. Just about every expert now agrees that even though
brain mapping is a relatively new scientific development, and even though
you can’t say how much of a person’s brain map is a result of heredity and
how much a product of his environment, brain differences definitely show
up between dyslexics and nondyslexics.

Chapter 2: Pinpointing What Dyslexia Is (And Isn’t)
Famous folks with dyslexia
Scores of talented, and of course perseverant,
people have overcome dyslexia. They’ve achieved
it all, including becoming famous writers! Here
are just a few of the dyslexics who sidestepped
the obstacles and became super-successful.
Inventors and scientists
 Thomas Edison: American. Invented the light
bulb. Discovered the “Edison effect,” which
led to the invention of the radio. Also held
over 1,000 patents for devices used in other
inventions.
 Albert Einstein: Originally German but lived
in Switzerland, Britain, and the United States.
Developed special and general theories of
relativity and in 1921 was awarded the Nobel
Prize for Physics.
Business moguls
 Steve Jobs: Founder of Apple Computers.
CEO of Apple and Pixar, the Academy Award–
winning animation studio.
 Charles Schwab: U.S. stockbroker. Estab-
lished one of the leading U.S. brokerages by
offering discount fees and other induce-
ments to small investors. Wrote How to Be
Your Own Stockbroker. Established the
Schwab Foundation for Learning, whose
great Web site you can find at www.
scwablearning.org.
Politicians
 John F. Kennedy: Youngest U.S. president
ever elected. Served exactly 1,000 days before
being assassinated.
 Woodrow Wilson: U.S. president during
World War I even though he campaigned
against it and was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize.
Artists
 Leonardo da Vinci: Italian painter who
painted in the realist style. Famous also for
being a gifted sculptor, inventor, mathemati-
cian, scientist, and architect. Painted the
Mona Lisa.
 Pablo Picasso: Spanish painter famous for
using different styles like expressionism
and cubism. Had a blue period and a rose
period. Painted The Three Dancers.
Movies and music
 John Lennon: What an icon! Just two of his
famous songs with the band the Beatles are
“Strawberry Fields Forever” and “All You
Need Is Love.”
 Steven Spielberg: Produced E.T., Jaws,
Jurassic Park, and many other brilliant
movies.
Sports stars
 Muhammad Ali: Olympic light heavyweight
boxing champion.
 Babe Ruth: Often called the greatest of all
baseball players.
Writers
 Lewis Carroll: British author of Alice’s
Adventures in Wonderland and Through the
Looking Glass. His real name was Charles
Lutwidge Dodgson, and he lectured in math
at Oxford University.
 Ernest Hemingway: Often called the most
influential American writer of the last cen-
tury. Wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls and A
Farewell To Arms. Shot himself after battling
depression.

Here’s what the terrain looks like on a dyslexic person’s brain map:
 When a dyslexic person reads, parts of his right brain hemisphere get
real busy, whereas when a fluent reader reads, he uses mostly his left
hemisphere. The left side of a person’s brain is the side all wired up for
language. When a dyslexic person reads, he uses the less efficient right
side of his brain, so he works harder at reading than a nondyslexic does
and takes a lot longer to read.
Researchers aren’t sure yet of the neurological and chemical specifics
of why this happens, but they know it’s not because of brain damage.
A dyslexic’s brain isn’t missing anything; it just works in a different way
than a nondyslexic’s. There may even be, as some people argue, a good
reason for this. Many people say that dyslexics have accentuated spatial
skills and the “gift” of being able to see things in three dimensions.
 When a dyslexic person improves his reading skills (by being instructed
in phonologic activities — see Chapter 12 for more details), his brain
map starts to look more like that of a nondyslexic.
 Not only do dyslexics use a different part of the brain when they read
than nondyslexics, but they use more of it. In the October 1999 issue of
the American Journal of Neuroradiology, researchers reported that when
dyslexics and nondyslexics performed the same oral language activities,
the dyslexics used nearly five times as much brain area. In effect, their
brains had to work five times harder.
Getting into genetics
A couple of things about the cause of dyslexia are clear:
 Dyslexia runs in families.
 Dyslexics have a different kind of brain map than nondyslexics (see the
previous section).
What’s not so clear is whether you inherit a dyslexic brain or your brain devel-
ops that way as a result of your not being able to read. It’s tricky, and all the
more so because the brain is such a complex organ.
That said, most experts believe there’s a genetic basis to dyslexia, and the
race is on to establish exactly which gene or genes are involved. The next
two bullet points show you a couple of research teams who both claim to be
the first to have found a single dyslexic gene! I, for one, intend to look out for
more research because this is clearly a hard nut to crack.
 In a 1999 issue of the British Journal of Medical Genetics, a team of
researchers said they were first to discover a single dyslexic gene.
They expressed hope that when their research is more developed, it
will lead to children with a family history of dyslexia being genetically

tested when they start school. You can read more at http://news.
bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/440261.stm.
 A gene called “KIAA0319,” which is likely to be one of the causes of
dyslexia in children, was recently discovered in Wales in 2005. Researchers
at Cardiff University said, “This is a major breakthrough and the first
study to identify one gene which contributes to susceptibility to the
common form of dyslexia.” You can read more about this study at
www.cardiff.ac.uk/newsevents/11554.html.

Breaking Down Dyslexia 
into Different Types
Getting people to classify your child as dyslexic can be hard enough, but
sometimes you may face just the opposite problem. You meet a psychologist
or therapist who tells you not only that your child has dyslexia (which you’ve
only recently got a good understanding of) but that he has one of many kinds
of dyslexia!
Just so that you’re one step ahead, here are the subtypes of dyslexia:
 Phonological dyslexia: Also called dysphonetic or auditory dyslexia or
dysphonesia, this kind of dyslexia is the most common. If your child has
phonological dyslexia, he has trouble identifying phonemes (sounds
within words) and matching letters to sounds. He makes wild guesses
and struggles to read nonsense words, and his spelling is all over the
place and may include impossible letter combinations like “sfr.”
Most tests for dyslexia at some point ask your child to read nonsense
words like sluft and prenck. That’s so that your child can’t guess but has
to sound out. This particular exercise can single out that a child has
phonological dyslexia. (See Chapter 6 for more info about testing.)
 Visual dyslexia: This kind of dyslexia is also called dyseidetic or surface
dyslexia or dyseidesia. If your child has visual dyslexia, he can sound out
words, but he has trouble with words that don’t sound out regularly
(such as who and any) and therefore have to be learned largely by sight.
He reads very slowly and spells phonetically (throo, skayt, dorter) with-
out registering that the appearance of his words is wrong. To check for
visual dyslexia, a psychologist asks your child to read a bunch of phonet-
ically regular words (like think, wishing, and testing) and irregular words
(like who, they, and enough) to see whether there’s obvious disparity in
his reading of each kind.
23
Chapter 2: Pinpointing What Dyslexia Is (And Isn’t)

 Mixed dyslexia: Also called dysphoneidetic dyslexia. This term refers to
a combination of phonological and visual dyslexia. Mixed dyslexics tend
to have severe deficits in reading as well as cognitive functions such as
visual motor integration, visual perception, and working memory.
 Dysnomia: Also called semantic dyslexia, anomia, or naming-speed deficits.
When your child is described in any of these terms, he has trouble find-
ing his words. He can’t always remember the right word, even though
he’s learned it before, and instead he says “the thingy” or another less
appropriate or sometimes wholly inappropriate word.
Psychologists test your child for this by giving him a rapid automatic
naming test. That’s a fancy way of saying that they flash pictures of
common objects (and colors, numbers, and letters) at him and see how
fast he names them, if at all.
 Double deficit: Here’s a term that tells you your child has phonological
dyslexia and dysnomia.
 Severe and mild dyslexia or dyslexic symptoms: One last thing to
remember about dyslexia is that whatever kind of dyslexia your child
has, he can have it to a greater or lesser extent. If he has mild dyslexia
or dyslexic symptoms, he may not qualify for special education in school.
(A psychologist can establish the extent of your child’s dyslexia.) In
Chapters 6 and 8, I go into detail about who does and doesn’t qualify
for extra — meaning over and above the usual — help in school.
Looking at Other “Dys” Conditions
Related to Dyslexia
Just when you thought I must’ve exhausted every possible long-winded term,
here I am with a few more! Don’t worry, I’ll be brief, but this little bunch of
conditions in the following sections is worth knowing about. They’re conditions
that are dyslexia-like but not quite dyslexia, if that makes any sense. I guess the
simplest way for me to introduce them is to say that the International Dyslexia
Association calls them “related disorders,” and that’s good enough for me!
Dysgraphia: Difficulty with writing
Dysgraphia means difficulty with handwriting, but — guess what? — there are
three different types:
 Dyslexic dysgraphia: Your child’s writing is illegible, especially when
the text is complex. Your child does badly on oral spelling, but he can
draw and copy written text relatively well and performs fine motor skills
at normal speed. (Psychologists measure fine motor speed by asking
your child to finger-tap.)
24
Part I: Figuring Out What Dyslexia Is All About 

 Motor dysgraphia: Your child’s writing is illegible, and his copied text may
be illegible too. His oral spelling is normal, but his drawing is usually
problematic. His finger-tapping speed is abnormal.
 Spatial dysgraphia: Your child’s writing is illegible and so is his copied
text. His oral spelling is normal. His drawing is terrible, but his finger-
tapping speed is normal.
Dysgraphia is usually classified as a condition separate from dyslexia but often
accompanied by it. A child with dysgraphia has pronounced and enduring
problems with writing. His writing is a real mess all the time, and without
expert help over several months, it stays that way.
Dyscalculia: Difficulty with math
Many dyslexics struggle with certain kinds of math, a condition called dyscal-
culia. It’s conspicuous because your child manages perfectly fine with math
tasks that don’t require him to remember strings of numbers. He struggles
with the following kinds of things:
 Counting accurately
 Reversing numbers
 Memorizing math facts
 Copying math problems and organizing written work
 Jotting down the wrong numbers in calculations
 Retaining math vocabulary and/or concepts
Many dyslexic children also have dyscalculia, but because most children,
dyslexic or not, experience math problems at some point, a psychologist’s
diagnosis is essential.
Dyspraxia: Difficulty with motor skills
Dyspraxia also goes by the name “clumsy child syndrome.” If your child has
dyspraxia, he has trouble planning and coordinating his body movements
and struggles with fine motor tasks like writing, buttoning his clothes, and
tying his shoelaces. He may have difficulty coordinating his facial muscles to
produce sounds, so his speech is garbled. His large motor coordination may
be weak too, so he’s conspicuously clumsy and weak at sports.
Researchers believe that dyspraxia, like dyslexia, isn’t caused by brain damage
but does start in your child’s brain. They think that immature neuron develop-
ment may be the culprit and are pretty certain that dyscalculia can’t be cured
(also like dyslexia).
25
Chapter 2: Pinpointing What Dyslexia Is (And Isn’t)

Comparing Dyslexia to ADD and ADHD
Many children who have dyslexia have other conditions too. If your child
has Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD), his main problem is that he struggles to focus and to
attend to what he’s doing or who’s speaking to him. He’s restless and
fidgety all the time and is likely to wander off when you talk to him. 
He’s hard to keep on track in class and, with his unsettling behavior,
stirs other children up.
ADD and ADHD share some of their symptoms with dyslexia. I give you the
full scoop on these two conditions in the following sections. (Chapter 3 goes
into more detail on the symptoms of dyslexia.)
26
Part I: Figuring Out What Dyslexia Is All About 
Names, names, names
When you talk to other parents whose children
have problems in class, you’re likely to hear
about all kinds of disabilities, big and small, that
you never knew existed. The kicker: A lot of
them may be confused for dyslexia. Here then
are just a few of those numerous names.
 Nonverbal Learning Disability (NLD): Here’s
a disability that looks like the opposite of
dyslexia! Your child has early speech, learns
to read early, and is excellent at spelling. He is
conspicuously weak in motor and social skills
and finds it hard to understand what he reads.
Why do you need to know about NLD when
it’s nothing like dyslexia? Because some of
the symptoms can look the same. A child
with NLD may, for example, have poor read-
ing comprehension and awful handwriting!
 Asperger Syndrome: To all intents and pur-
poses, this syndrome is a mild form of autism.
A child with Asperger Syndrome may have
symptoms of dyslexia, such as not under-
standing what he’s read.
 Semantic Pragmatic Disorder (SPD):Seman-
tic means meaning, and pragmatic means
being practical. Put them together and you
have someone who doesn’t understand
everyday social and practical interactions.
This disorder is like mild autism and is first
identified as a conspicuous delay in speech
and language development. So it’s like dys-
lexia too.
 Hyperlexia: This child is fascinated, at an
early age, with letters, numbers, and pat-
terns. He learns to read, write, and compute
very early and looks like a genius. But social
interaction and oral language are a differ-
ent ball game for this child. He’s conspicu-
ously weak in these areas, but even though
his reading and writing are advanced, he
can be confused with a dyslexic because
some dyslexics learn to read but struggle
later on with moving to higher reading
levels and writing and spelling.

Psychiatrists look for more than just the following lists of symptoms. They
look at your child’s age, pattern of symptoms, and degree of symptomatic
behavior. They look at how long symptoms have persisted. I guess what
I’m saying is that this is only a rough guide for you. Contact your doctor
or psychiatrist for the closer and clearer picture. You can also check out
AD/HD For Dummies by Jeff Strong and Michael O. Flanagan (Wiley).
Even if your child is diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, get a second opinion.
These conditions are notoriously hard to pin down because all children 
display some of them sometimes, and a bored or dyslexic child can have
pretty much all the same symptoms. Many experts warn about overdiagnosis
of ADD and ADHD, so before you accept a diagnosis, be sure that your child is
inattentive even when he really loves what he’s doing and hyper even when
he’s in a big space with fun activities on hand.
And remember: Some children are identified as having the combined type of
ADHD; they have features of both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity.
Examining ADD
The American Psychiatric Association has a complex formula for how your
child should be assessed, but its starting symptoms for Inattention ADHD or
ADD are:
 Your child often misses details and makes careless mistakes in schoolwork.
 Your child has trouble staying on task.
 Your child often doesn’t seem to listen to you even when you speak
directly to him.
 Your child often fails to follow your instructions or finish tasks that he
starts (and it’s not because he’s defiant or hasn’t understood).
 Your child has trouble organizing himself.
 Your child doesn’t want to start tasks that he knows require his concen-
tration over time (like homework!).
 Your child often loses things (he usually can’t find his school assignments,
pencils, or books).
 Most sounds, like small noises and cars passing outside a window, distract
your child.
 Your child is generally forgetful.
27
Chapter 2: Pinpointing What Dyslexia Is (And Isn’t)

Checking out ADHD
If your child has ADHD, he has ADD symptoms with some hyperactivity thrown
in too. He’s always restless. He’s hyper. He’s very hard to manage in a confined,
controlled space like, oh yes, the classroom! To diagnose ADHD, the American
Psychiatric Association starts by looking for symptoms of hyperactivity and
impulsivity. And here they are:
 Hyperactivity:
• Your child fidgets. He flicks his fingers, waves his feet, and squirms
around in his seat.
• Your child finds plenty of reasons for leaving his seat because to
stay in it feels so horribly hard.
• Your child runs when he really should be walking and climbs all
over furniture when he’s supposed to be “behaving.”
• Your child has trouble with quiet play.
• Kind people describe your child as “a live wire.”
• Your child generally talks, and talks, and talks!
 Impulsivity:
• Your child has trouble waiting for his turn to talk. He often blurts
out his answer because he just can’t hold it in.
• Your child has trouble waiting for his turn in pretty much all 
situations.
• Your child is always interrupting or pushing in.

 Understanding the importance of tracking symptoms
 Noting signs in your preschooler
 Keeping an eye on your school-age child
 Taking stock of symptoms in teenagers and adults
 Going back into your family’s history
A
few weeks ago I took my two daughters on a trip. “Pack just one bag,”
I said and went to attend to other things, secure in the knowledge that
my girls know to pack a sweater even in a heat wave (for chilly nights) and
have learned from experience that nothing really replaces a toothbrush.
When the two bags were packed, there was a big bulging one and an impossi-
bly small-looking one. If I’d loaded those bags into the trunk without peeking
inside them, I’d have gotten quite a shock later on when we needed to change
our clothes. My oldest child had jammed the big suitcase with purses and a
virtual makeup booth, while my youngest had filled her bag, more of a pouch
really, with sticks and bottles. All the paraphernalia for strutting your stuff
and training in wizardry.
Watching your child for symptoms of dyslexia is like packing your travel bag.
You need to focus on what’s important and refer to a checklist so you don’t
forget anything. In this chapter, I show you why you should look for signs of
dyslexia at the first hint of reading trouble, and I give you details on the exact
signs to look for at any age.

Understanding Why It’s Important 
to Look for Signs
Educators agree that it’s a great idea for parents to be involved with develop-
ing their children’s reading skills from an early age and that this involvement
is especially important when a child seems to be making a slow start. If you
notice the slightest hint that your child is struggling with reading, it’s crucial
that you continue to look for signs that may indicate a more serious problem.
The following sections explain why.
From the moment you notice your child behaving in ways that you think could
be symptomatic of dyslexia, jot them down. Later you may need to give a
chronology of your observational information (especially to the educational
psychologist who assesses your child — see Chapter 6 for assessment details),
and this way you don’t forget anything.
Appreciating that dyslexia is unexpected
Here’s one important reason why you need to look for signs of dyslexia: Dyslexia
is unexpected. Suppose that your child is bright, capable, and, unless she’s
gone through a lot of failure, willing to try new activities. She’s had all the
opportunities you could put her way. She hasn’t had any particular traumas.
But despite all this, when it comes to reading and writing, she just doesn’t get
it. And you’re taken by surprise, dumbfounded, and horrified. You see other
kids, plenty of whom have barely any of the advantages your child has, surge
forward. You see them start to read pretty easily and quickly progress to
chapter books. But your child stays put. That’s what dyslexia looks like —
just what you really didn’t expect.
But that’s not all. Dyslexia has been described as an “invisible” disability.
Why? Your child may show dyslexic symptoms late in her schooling. She’s
bright and resilient and picks up basic early reading skills, but later on, the
rudimentary skills she has can’t keep pace with the harder work she’s given.
Now you get the really big surprise. Your older child has only a basic grasp of
phonics and only a small repertoire of words she recognizes instantly, and when
she reads lengthy text, she has barely any comprehension. She is dyslexic, and
up until now, no one picked it up. When dyslexia shows up in older kids and
even adults, it’s unexpected — not because the symptoms weren’t always there,
but because your child’s strengths carried her through school and made her
weaknesses virtually invisible.
Dyslexia manifests itself uniquely; each child has her own set of symptoms
(from all the possibilities), and each symptom can vary in severity. Even siblings
with dyslexia may have very different strengths and weaknesses in academic
performance, just as they will in other areas.
30
Part I: Figuring Out What Dyslexia Is All About 

Being savvy about screening tests 
and what one teacher can do
If your child struggles with reading and writing, looking for signs of dyslexia
is important because you may be the only one to spot or at least probe into
them. “But that’s what the school does,” I hear you say. Well, yes and no.
Your child does get screened for reading problems in grades K to 2; these
screening tests screen a large number of children to see which ones may be
at risk for school failure. Those children are given more tests and monitored
closely in class. But suppose that your child
 Does okay in screening tests but starts struggling later on.
 Scrapes through the tests even though she struggles in class.
 Does fine on what the tests measure but has trouble with other skills
that weren’t tested.
All of these things can happen, so it’s in your child’s best interest if you keep
a close watch. And don’t forget that teachers handle struggling kids in differ-
ent ways too. Your child may have a terrific teacher who’s sensitive to her 
difficulties and confident enough to speak up about them, but what if your
child’s teacher
 Mistakes your child’s problems as being within the acceptable range.
 Is busy keeping every child in line and can’t give your child much 
attention.
 Believes that dyslexia is psychobunk for “lazy” (sounds far-fetched but it
happens!).
 Believes (mistakenly!) that your child really will catch up in time.
You definitely need to monitor your child’s progress (or lack of it) and jot down
what you see. You can then go to the teacher with your observations in hand
and ask for help. And if help doesn’t seem to materialize, go right back and ask
again. If you can’t work things out with the teacher, see the guidance officer
and the principal. After that, your next stop is the district office.
If your child isn’t “getting it,” you’re probably right to be concerned. But you
won’t sound convincing to the teacher if you just say, “She isn’t getting it.”
You need to identify a cluster of specific weaknesses because that’s what the
professionals do. Educational psychologists who assess children for dyslexia
refer to a list of symptoms. If your child shows a bunch of them, she may
be dyslexic and need to take a battery of tests to get the definitive answer
(I talk more about tests in Chapter 6). But the starting point is when you see
that she shows dyslexia-like behaviors pretty much all of the time. And you
can spot those behaviors probably better than a psychologist can because
you see a zillion times more of your child than he does.
31
Chapter 3: Being Alert to Symptoms of Dyslexia at Any Age

Avoiding the “wait awhile” trap
You want me to tell you the precise signs of dyslexia, and of course I do that
later in this chapter, but first I have some important advice for you in case
you get cold feet about taking your list of dyslexia-like behaviors to school.
Parents of dyslexic children frequently wait awhile before getting extra help —
and later regret putting it off. Your child makes the quickest gains in learning to
read in grades K to 2. She’s like a sponge at this time, ready and willing to learn
a lot. Later, her first enthusiasm wanes, especially if she’s struggling, and learn-
ing to read takes her much longer than it takes other kids. Don’t wait. If you
feel something’s wrong, trust your judgment, even if someone tells you to wait
awhile and let development take its course. A struggling child doesn’t suddenly
find that everything makes sense after all. She doesn’t catch up. Her problems
just get worse, and then you have a job that’s harder and takes longer.
Noticing Your Preschooler’s 
Late Development
Your child starts talking late. She has trouble naming shapes and colors.
She’s not all that interested in stories and often walks off halfway through
them. Should you worry? Maybe. Should you look for other signs and go 
see a professional? Certainly. If you catch your child’s difficulties when she’s
still a preschooler, you have a great chance of helping her get up to par by
the time it really counts, in grades 1 and 2.
The following list gives you the kinds of behaviors that educational psycho-
logists have in mind when they look for clusters of symptoms that indicate
dyslexia in your preschooler. I cover these symptoms (and what to do if you
see them) in more detail in Chapter 4.
 Starts to speak late (no actual speech until after age 2)
 Says muddled-up words (such as aminal for animal and gabrage for
garbage)
 Doesn’t understand what you say until you repeat it a few times
 Can’t follow more than one direction at a time
 Can’t remember words
 Takes awhile to get words out
 Can’t consistently name the letters of the alphabet
 Doesn’t enjoy being read to
 Enjoys being read to but shows no interest in words or letters
32
Part I: Figuring Out What Dyslexia Is All About 

 Has weak fine motor skills (in activities such as drawing, tying laces, 
cutting, and threading)
 Can’t tell you rhyming words (cat/hat)
 Can’t tell the difference between letters and other symbols or squiggles
 Can’t recognize her own written name
A psychologist assessing your child will also ask you whether your child has,
or has had, a lot of ear infections. Ear infections aren’t a sign of dyslexia but
are a complicating factor that can make dyslexia worse.
Watching Your School-Age Child Fade
Can’t read. Reverses and mixes up the order of letters when she writes words.
Can’t remember the alphabet. These are classic signs of dyslexia in your child
when she’s in elementary school. You may notice the following behaviors in
your child’s cluster of dyslexia symptoms:
 Doesn’t show a dominant handedness until about age 7.
 Has immature speech, saying words like “wed” (red) and “gween” (green).
 Can’t write or tell you the sounds of the alphabet.
 Is bright and verbal but unexpectedly weak at reading.
 Talks with an advanced vocabulary when she can’t recall simpler words,
saying things like “We’re going to the food distributor.”
 Frequently uses words like “umm” and “thingy.”
 Writes words with letters in the wrong places, like saw instead of was
and vawe instead of wave (called transposing letters).
 Reverses letters and numbers (especially b and d, p and q, and 3 and 5).
Letter and number reversals are common in all children, including those
who don’t have dyslexia, up to about age 7. So what’s the difference
between a child making mistakes that are nothing to be concerned about
and mistakes that may indicate dyslexia? A dyslexic child makes mistakes
just as often as she doesn’t, and she continues making them in grade 2
and beyond.
 Writing is barely legible (letters are badly formed and the wrong size).
 Confused about directionality, such as left/right, up/down, and front/back.
 Doesn’t follow through with multiple-step chores.
 Is below grade in reading and/or writing and spelling (as confirmed by
her teacher, school tests, or tests done by an educational consultant or
psychologist).
33
Chapter 3: Being Alert to Symptoms of Dyslexia at Any Age

 Adds or leaves out small words when reading (which can totally change
the meaning of the text).
 Has trouble retelling a story.
 Complains of words moving or running off the paper.
 Complains of dizziness, headache, or stomachache while reading.
 Receives grades that don’t match her intelligence.
To determine whether your child’s grades match her potential, you need
to have her assessed by a psychologist. You may be able to see this pretty
clearly without a test, though, and of course the teacher can let you know
what he thinks.
 Can’t remember facts like multiplication tables, days of the week, dates,
and names.
Your dyslexic child also may show you signs of her dyslexia that have no
direct connection to reading and writing. Her attitude, behavior, and all-
around manner speak volumes. For example, she just figured out what
“apple” group really means, and she feels stupid, not as good as the other
kids, and angry. How would you react? Here are some typical behaviors
you may see:
 Your child looks and acts unhappy.
 Your child seems too quiet; she’s practically invisible.
 Your child stirs up plenty of trouble at home and in school.
 Your child is clearly disorganized.

them), check out Chapter 5.

Part I: Figuring Out What Dyslexia Is All About 
Beware of report card rhetoric
The other day I was with a friend looking
through her photo albums. One album spanned
her dyslexic daughter’s elementary school years,
and in it were old school reports. My friend said,
“Check these out. They all say pretty much the
same thing.” On every report a handful of words
and phrases repeated themselves — struggles,
tries hard, slow, kind, helpful, a pleasure to
teach. “You know, she really did try and try,” my
friend sighed.
Harsher words may proliferate on your child’s
report — words like lazy, inattentive, distractible,
careless, immature, and daydreamer. Don’t let
them get to you. The same bunch of adjectives
find their way onto thousands of dyslexic chil-
dren’s reports, but they don’t mean much, and
they certainly don’t help. The important thing to
do is to remember that your child is doing her best
in the face of adversity and that the teacher’s
words (though unfair and worth calling her to task
on) are very good reason to get an assessment.

For a personal account of a mother discovering that her son has dyslexia, read
Reading David by Lissa Weinstein (Perigee Books). Two aspects of the book
make it unusual: The author is an educational psychologist herself but still
missed (or denied) the signs, and the author’s dyslexic son, David, still in
school now, gives his perspective.
Recognizing Signs of Dyslexia 
at Older Ages
Many adults wonder if their unsuccessful (and maybe unhappy) days at school
were due to undiagnosed dyslexia. Teens can find themselves wondering the
same thing because even though dyslexia is now a recognized disability, chil-
dren who have mild dyslexic symptoms, plenty of other strengths, and good
coverup strategies may still go undiagnosed. In the following sections, I talk
about the specific dyslexic symptoms that crop up in teens and adults.
Seeking out signs in teenagers
If your teenager dislikes school, doesn’t do her homework, and hardly ever
picks up a book, dyslexia may be the reason. Teen dyslexics may go to great
lengths to avoid reading and writing, find ways to cover up their reading fail-
ure, and worry to no end about it. Here is a quick rundown of things you may
see your teenage dyslexic doing.
 She avoids reading and writing.
 When she does read, she guesses at words, skips small words, and has
little comprehension.
 When she writes, she muddles the order of letters inside words or leaves
them out completely.
 She starts to dislike school, even though she seemed to be doing fine
before.
 She doesn’t do homework, and her teachers are concerned or critical.
 She tells you that she’s “dumb” or “couldn’t care less.”
 She is more anxious and self-conscious than before (though you may
have thought that was hardly possible!).
 She is withdrawn and won’t get involved in as many social events
(like birthday parties and sleepovers) as she used to.
 She is aggressive, abusive, or antisocial (and worrisome) in other ways.

college, check out Chapters 16 and 17.

Chapter 3: Being Alert to Symptoms of Dyslexia at Any Age

Acknowledging adult symptoms
Dyslexic adults have learned to live with their difficulties. Whether they’re open
about their dyslexia, or even know they have dyslexia, is a different matter.
Some dyslexic adults tell everyone about their dyslexia, ask for accommoda-
tions at work, and joke about their goof-ups at home. Some hide their dyslexia
and go to great lengths to keep it under wraps. They don’t trust that other
people will understand and don’t want to lose their jobs or be thought of as
mental cases (a term that a dyslexic friend of mine used!). Others don’t know
they’re dyslexic.
The stereotypical dyslexic adult exhibits the following behavior:
 Avoids any reading or writing
 Types letters in the wrong order
 Flip-flops numbers and dates, especially 3s and 5s.
 Can’t fill out forms
 Is adept at hiding her illiteracy by doing things like ordering what
friends eat at restaurants to avoid reading the menu
 Has low self-esteem and/or a bad attitude
 Is a high school dropout
 Holds a job below her potential and/or changes jobs frequently
 Misses minor details at her job
 Can’t play sports due to poor coordination
 Can’t read to her kids
Here are a few ordinary, everyday bits of information that a dyslexic adult
may be unable to read:
 Figures on a salary check
 Instructions on prescription medicine
 Numbers in a telephone directory
 The menu in a restaurant
 Traffic signs, street names, and maps
 Letters, books, and homework that your child brings home from school
 TV schedules
 Instructions for building and using new toys or equipment

Adult dyslexics have to recruit help and work out clever coping strategies
every day of their lives or face being isolated in a reading world. Check out
Chapter 18 for additional signs of dyslexia in adults and tips on succeeding in
the real world.
Referring to Your Family’s History
If there’s a dyslexic in your family, your child is more likely than other kids
to have dyslexia. Dyslexia runs in families. Whether your family is black or
white, well educated or minimally educated, rich or just getting by, it makes
no difference. Dyslexia skips past race, gender, and socioeconomic barriers,
and money and position won’t get you a cure either. There’s no cure.
Here are some interesting snippets about family patterns regarding dyslexia:
 Many studies show the tendency for dyslexia to run in families. If one
of your parents has dyslexia, you have an increased chance of having
dyslexia yourself. Figures on this “increased chance” range from 25 to
75 percent. Because of various factors (like whether a child receives
good instruction and is specifically called “dyslexic”), a more accurate
prediction really isn’t possible.
37
Chapter 3: Being Alert to Symptoms of Dyslexia at Any Age
Dyslexia: A special burden for teens
When you talk to dyslexics and read dyslexic
message boards, you find truckloads of personal
anecdotes and figures about high school pres-
sures. Some folks talk about how terrifying it is
to be asked questions that they feel that they
can never answer; others discuss the humilia-
tion of not feeling bright.
For some teenagers, the humiliation becomes too
much. The strain and frustration of underachiev-
ing can cause dyslexic teens to be reluctant to go
to school, to throw temper tantrums before school,
or to play truant. Cheating, stealing, and experi-
menting with drugs can also result when children
regard themselves as failures. Youngsters with
learning disabilities constitute a disproportion-
ately large percentage of adolescent suicides.
More than 27 percent of children with learning
disabilities drop out of high school, compared to
11 percent of the general student population
(24th Annual Report to Congress on the Implemen-
tation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act, 2002). According to the U.S. Department of
Education, 85 percent of all juvenile offenders
have reading problems.
Your teenager may bury her dyslexia under a
heap of defiant or self-abusive behavior. Don’t
be brought down or diverted by these sec-
ondary behaviors, or fooled into thinking that
your teen is just about adult enough to pull her-
self back on track.

 Because many older dyslexics are unaware that they have dyslexia
(they say things like “I didn’t do well in school,” “I’m not a reader,” and
“I don’t like writing”), you may not realize that dyslexia is in the family.
 Researchers can make predictions about the degree of dyslexia a person
will have by looking at inherited brain differences. Most experts agree
that dyslexics share a certain kind of brain activity (different parts work-
ing better or worse) and that when you map this, certain topographies
suggest more trouble than others!
If you struggled at school or know that you have dyslexia, or if someone else
in your family fits that bill, watch your child for symptoms of dyslexia right
from an early age. If she doesn’t have dyslexia, you’ve lost nothing by watch-
ing her, but if she does have dyslexia, you’ve gained valuable insight and time.
You may even be the only person to spot that your child needs extra help and
then you spare yourself that awful “I should’ve known” kind of hindsight.

but should you request a dyslexia assessment anyway?

A
s any parent knows, there’s nothing as bleak as worrying about your
child — except for worrying about him for a long time. That’s why this
chapter helps you move quickly from concern to action. Here you get a pic-
ture of what your preschool child’s development looks like and what kinds of
behavior may signify a budding problem. Then I give you games and activities
to do at home that strengthen the skills a dyslexic child typically struggles with,
and I cover specific abilities that your child should have before he enters
kindergarten.
Keeping a Close Eye on Early Skills
Your child’s preschool years are a magical time. You get to marvel when
he learns to walk and speak, and just about every day he tucks some new
accomplishment under his belt. Do you need to think about dyslexia now?
If someone in your family has dyslexia, and/or if your child doesn’t seem to
be cruising past typical developmental milestones, you do.
Your child can’t be definitively diagnosed with dyslexia before grade 2 or age
8 because dyslexia is primarily a problem with written words, but he can be
determined to be “at risk” for dyslexia much earlier. Assessors can use tests
like the Dyslexia Early Screening Test (DEST) with kids as young as 4 years old
to look for weaknesses in skills like rhyming, phonemic awareness, immediate
recall, hand-eye coordination, sound discrimination, and shape formation.
A child has to exhibit several of these in severity to be determined at risk.
(See Chapter 6 for testing info.)

What you can definitely do before school starts is be primed for potential prob-
lems, give your child plenty of play that develops his phonemic awareness
(see “Listening up for phonemic awareness,” later in this chapter, for details),
and, if your child needs it, get him some speech therapy.
In the following sections, I give you the lowdown on language, hearing, and
vision difficulties that may signal a bigger problem. I also delve into the fine
motor and pre-reading skills you should monitor in your preschooler.
Talking late and unclearly
Delayed speech is a red flag for dyslexia. If your child isn’t speaking by age 2
or older, you’ll want to be watchful of his progress with reading when he starts
school. Delayed speech doesn’t mean your child will be dyslexic, but it does
alert you to watch for later, more definitive signs (I talk about signs of dyslexia
in older kids in Chapter 5).
Even before school starts, you should have your late talker’s hearing checked
(see the next section), and you may want to consult a speech therapist too
just to make sure that your child’s jaw and mouth muscles are as developed
as they should be (if not, facial exercises can help).
If your child has muddled and unclear speech when he starts to speak, it’s
reason to keep an eye on him. Does he typically say things like “aminal”
for “animal” and “bisghetti” for “spaghetti”? Does he stutter and fumble for
his words? If so, and your child’s turned 3, call your public school district.
You can get free testing and speech therapy before your child starts school
and for the rest of his years in school if you can establish that he needs it to
receive a free and appropriate public education (FAPE). See Chapter 6 for
details on testing and Chapter 8 for more about FAPE.
The following are a few more language problems that may indicate dyslexia
and need the evaluation of a speech therapist:
 Is your child’s receptive speech slightly off the mark? (Receptive speech is
your child’s ability to understand other people’s speech.) Can he under-
stand what’s being said to him without it having to be repeated several
times? Does he have trouble understanding the difference between
“under “and “over,” and “in front” or “behind”? This kind of confusion,
especially over directionality, is another early indicator of dyslexia that
speech therapy can help with.
 Is your child slow to name familiar objects? Many dyslexics struggle all
their life with word retrieval. They know what they want to say but can’t
pluck it from their brains. They end up using sentences like “Can you
pass me the thingy?” much more than other folks do. They also may use
alternative words in sentences, saying strange things like “I’m going to
the meal distributor” instead of “I’m going to the snack bar.”
42
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

 Stammering is an involuntary blockage of normal speech patterns and
not linked to dyslexia. That said, if your child hesitates while trying to
find words and has a sort of stammer because he can’t recall the words
that he needs, it’s a warning sign of dyslexia.
 Poor letter articulation is a possible warning of dyslexia. If your preschool
child says “wed and gween” instead of “red and green,” listen up. It’s not
a big deal now but becomes a red flag if he still talks that way by about
second grade.
Private schools don’t have to follow the special education regulations that
govern public schools, but if your child attends a private school and needs
speech therapy, your school district may have to pay for it. To find out more,
ask your school nurse or district office. If you don’t get much help there, check
out the legal organizations listed in Appendix B. And if you pay for private
speech therapy, check to see if your insurance plan covers all or part of your
costs. The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association at www.asha.org/
public/coverage/ has useful information about insurance and other ways
of having your speech therapy fees reduced.
Battling ear infections
A big dyslexia warning sign to look out for in children under age 5 is recurring
ear infections. Ear infections, in themselves, don’t mean your child will be
dyslexic, but many dyslexic children have a history of ear infections. The infec-
tions don’t cause dyslexia but almost certainly make it worse by impairing your
child’s ability to hear speech sounds at a time when he should be making the
most progress with auditory processing.
43
Chapter 4: Watching Your Child Carefully at a Young Age
Speaking to a speech therapist
Could your child have what speech therapists
call “childhood apraxia of speech” rather than
dyslexia? According to the American Speech-
Language-Hearing Association, a child with
speech apraxia knows what he wants to say but
can’t get his brain to move his lips, jaw, and
tongue in readiness.
The following signs may indicate speech apraxia
in your young child:
 He doesn’t coo or babble in infancy.
 He may have feeding problems in infancy.
 When he says his first words, it takes him a
long time, and some sounds are missing.
 He makes only a few consonant sounds.
 He replaces difficult sounds with easier
ones or leaves out sounds altogether. (All
children do this, but the child with develop-
mental apraxia of speech does it often.)
Find out more (and guard against a possible
misdiagnosis) by logging on to the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association Web
site at www.asha.org/default.htm or
by visiting www.apraxia-kids.org/.

The funny thing about your child’s hearing is that it has what you might call
everything and nothing to do with dyslexia. Experts pretty much agree that
although dyslexia is all about hearing sounds, it’s not a straightforward hear-
ing impairment. A dyslexic child hears sounds okay, but he processes them all
wrong.
Dyslexia is a “phonemic” rather than a hearing disorder. Your child’s ears work
fine, but when he identifies and makes sense of sounds (in his brain), he goes
wrong. He doesn’t distinguish between sounds (or phonemes) inside words
in the same way that other children do. This kind of awareness is called
phonemic awareness, and experts consider the lack of it the number one feature
of dyslexia. A child who lacks phonemic awareness can’t tell the difference
between words like tot and top, cot and cut, and tin and Tim. For more details,
see “Listening up for phonemic awareness,” later in this chapter.
If you have concerns about your preschooler’s hearing, consult your doctor.
Get a referral to an audiologist for a hearing test (your insurance should cover
at least part of the cost). If the test uncovers any problem, you can receive
more private help and/or take the test results to your school district. If the
district finds that your preschooler’s hearing problem impacts his education,
he gets free support (ongoing assessment and treatment) for as long as he
needs it. “Preschool age,” by the way, is age 3 to 5, but you should check
cutoff dates if your child is only just 3 or nearly 6. Also check exactly what
provision you get because variations can exist between school districts. And
when your preschooler starts school, be sure that his file is passed to the
new service provider if indeed a new body takes responsibility for him.
Seeing a range of vision problems
Your child’s vision is another factor (like his hearing, covered in the previous
section) that complicates but doesn’t cause dyslexia. Many dyslexics com-
plain of seeing wobbly, fuzzy, or moving letters, but experts have pretty much
decided that this complaint is something of a red herring because even when
letters are clearly in focus for a dyslexic, he still has trouble matching sounds
to letters. Your dyslexic child may have vision problems (which can usually
be treated with eye exercises or lenses), but his dyslexia is primarily a brain-
based phonemic processing issues.
Many symptoms of vision problems are the very same symptoms that sug-
gest dyslexia, so you need expert help in fathoming out the right diagnosis.
Your child may have dyslexia, vision problems, dyslexia and vision problems,
or perhaps something different again! Your child may have a vision problem if
you notice that he does any of the following:
44
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

 Doesn’t enjoy being read to
 Enjoys being read to but shows no interest in words and letters
 Loses his place along lines of print
 Gets eyestrain or red or watery eyes when he looks at books
 Complains of blurred, double, or moving print
 Squints, frowns, or rubs his eyes while looking at books
 Tilts his head or holds his book too closely when he looks at books
 Covers an eye to look at print
 Has trouble spotting items that are alike and different
 Avoids close-up tasks
 Is easily distracted
 Has a short attention span
 Needs a lot of breaks from paper-and-pen activities
 Tires quickly when he draws and traces
 Has trouble copying and tracing shapes and letters
 Reverses letters and numbers
 Has poor self-esteem
 Complains of headaches
 Has poor hand-eye coordination
 Appears awkward or clumsy
According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, children should have
a complete medical eye exam by their fourth birthday and routine eye exams
about every two years thereafter. A pediatric optometrist can tell you some
sobering statistics:
 About one in every five schoolchildren has an undetected vision problem.
 A school’s vision screening test doesn’t pick up every kind of vision
problem.
 Your child can have 20/20 eyesight (meaning normal distance vision)
and still have problems coordinating both his eyes as a team, tracking
print across a page without losing his place, or adjusting focus when he
looks from near to distant things.
45
Chapter 4: Watching Your Child Carefully at a Young Age

Even though experts are pretty certain that vision problems aren’t the cause of
dyslexia, some dyslexia treatments (such as Davis Dyslexia Correction and the
Irlen Method) pay special attention to correcting your child’s visual tracking
(following words along lines of a page). I talk about these dyslexia treatments
in more detail in Chapter 20.
Having trouble with playing and dressing
Children with dyslexia commonly have poor hand-eye coordination and fine
motor skills. A dyslexic child may have trouble throwing and catching, and
tasks like tying his shoelaces, buttoning his shirts, or threading beads may
throw him into a fury. He may be late to develop a dominant hand too. He may
switch between his right and left hand to write, catch a ball, or do other hand
tasks, and he may not become right- or left-handed until about age 7. Even then,
he may use one hand for writing and the other for catching!
Plenty of children have poor hand-eye coordination and go through a time of
being ambidextrous (able to use both hands), so (as with all the signs I mention
here) these behaviors are only potential indicators of dyslexia. They don’t
indicate dyslexia for sure unless they persist in school and form part of a
cluster of symptoms (see Chapter 5 for dyslexia signs in school-age kids).
46
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 
Looking out for lazy and turned eyes
If your child has an undetected vision problem,
he can develop symptoms that look like those of
dyslexia. If he has dyslexia already, a vision
problem makes things worse. Even when your
child gets regular vision tests, problems can go
undetected, and parents may be so accustomed
to seeing a symptom, like their child having a
slight head tilt when he looks at books, that they
no longer notice it. Here is some information
about two really common eye problems.
 Amblyopia, or lazy eye, is when one of your
child’s eyes doesn’t work as well as the other.
About 3 percent of children under age 6
have amblyopia. Treatment usually includes
eye exercises and an eye patch, but if you
don’t treat it early, your child may have poor
vision into adulthood. If your child squints or
closes one eye to see, has generally poor
vision, and/or complains of eyestrain or
headaches, he may have amblyopia.
 Strabismus, or deviating eyes, is when your
child’s eyes don’t look toward the same
object together. The turn can be constant or
intermittent, and if it’s intermittent, it may be
hard for you to detect.
Early examination is especially important if any
other member of the family has had amblyopia
or strabismus (deviating eyes) before.
For more information and a directory of optom-
etrists, log on to the Optometrists Network at
www.children-special-needs.org/.

Displaying weak pre-reading skills
Certain additional pre-reading problems can be potential symptoms of dyslexia.
If your child struggles with several of the pre-reading behaviors I list here,
right through grade 1, and he’s otherwise bright and responsive (so you’re
surprised by this glitch with language skills), ask for an assessment. I walk
you through the dyslexia (or “learning disabilities”) assessment process in
Chapter 6. You can also try some of the activities I feature in the next section
to help your child strengthen his pre-reading abilities.
 Your child can’t identify sounds inside words. By the time they go to
school, most children can tell you when words sound alike or different.
They can give you a string of “buh” words, like ball, balloon, bench, and
bun, and enjoy alliteration (“an alligator ate Alice”). A child with dyslexia
usually doesn’t understand what the fuss is about. He doesn’t hear the
pattern in the “buh” words or appreciate the fun in alliteration.
 Your child can’t tell you rhyming words. Most children can rhyme by
the time they go to school. They can anticipate rhyming words on the
ends of verses and will happily tell you a few of their favorite nursery
rhymes. A child with dyslexia usually doesn’t do this. Rhyme is some-
thing he just doesn’t get.
 Your child isn’t interested in words or letters. Preschool children usu-
ally enjoy writing letters and their name all over the place. A dyslexic
child usually doesn’t.
 Your child can’t identify letters from squiggles. A dyslexic child takes
longer to get to know letters than other children do. By the time he
starts school, he usually hasn’t learned to identify all the letters and
may confuse letters with each other or letters and random squiggles
with each other.
 Your child can’t retell a simple story. Small children can tell you a
story, albeit in an extended, roundabout way. They’re not succinct or
sophisticated, but they get there. A child with dyslexia usually doesn’t
get there. He finds it hard to recall sequences of events, so retelling a
story is virtually impossible for him.
 Your child isn’t interested in hearing stories. Some dyslexic children
don’t enjoy hearing stories. They don’t follow plots, don’t understand
wordplay, and may walk right off in the middle of a story that other kids
are begging for more of.
 Your child can’t write or recognize his own name. A dyslexic child
may be unable to write or recognize his own name by the time he
starts school.
47
Chapter 4: Watching Your Child Carefully at a Young Age

Engaging in Pre-Reading 
Activities at Home
In the previous section, I touch on a few pre-reading difficulties (like not hear-
ing rhyme or recognizing letters) that can be forerunners of dyslexia. But what
practical strategies can you put to use at home to address them?
Plenty of language activities prepare your child for reading. You can loosely
classify them as activities that build the following skills:
 Print awareness: When your child understands that print runs left to
right and top to bottom, he’s primed for following sentences in pages
of text. Your dyslexic child needs plenty of print awareness because
directionality (left to right) is especially tricky for him.
 Phonemic and phonics skills: Before he can read, your child must get a
few skills under his belt: phonemic awareness (hearing sounds in words)
and phonics (matching letters to those sounds). In preschool and kinder-
garten, you want your child to do a whole bunch of singing, rhyming, and
saying different letter sounds so that he develops phonemic awareness
and, from that, solid phonics skills.
I delve deeper into these areas in the following sections.
Developing print awareness
When some children start school, they have no idea how to hold a book or
follow along the lines and pages in a book. Your child knows which direction
written words run in, how chapters break a book into sections, how books
tell you things, and how they’re written by authors, because you read to him.
Print awareness is a relatively easy thing to help your child with — you simply
read to him and point out the direction of the text, the parts of the book, and
so on — but an important precursor of reading nevertheless.
Zeroing in on phonemic and phonics skills
Your child needs to get on top of phonics, that is, being able to sound out let-
ters and words. To do that, he must develop a bunch of sequential skills that
start with phonemic awareness. People get pretty technical about “phono”
terms, but I of course give you the simple explanation right here!
 Phonemic awareness: Before you give your child any instruction in the
letters of the alphabet, he must be aware that words are made of chunks
of sound. This appreciation of sounds is phonemic awareness.
48
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

 Phonological awareness: When you hear the term “phonological aware-
ness,” it’s about sounds too — only more of them! When your child has
phonological awareness, he has a fairly sophisticated appreciation of
sounds. He can identify many chunks of sound, like prefixes (un-aware,
for example) and rhymes (in word families like make, take, rake, and
sake, the ake part is called a rhyme).
 Phonics: After your child is aware that spoken words are made of
sounds, he needs to discover that written letters and chunks of letters
represent those sounds. This attaching of letters to sounds is phonics.
 Morphological and orthographic awareness: At the same time that
your child gets comfortable with regular, easy-to-sound-out words like
stamp and pink, he has to get to know a few harder words. Words like
who (that don’t sound out) are pretty hard, and so are words like brought
and niece (that have unusual sound-spelling chunks). And then there are
prefixes (like un, dis, and pre), suffixes (like able, tion, and ly), contractions
(like can’t and don’t), and stuff like that to learn! The prefixes and suffixes
kind of learning is called morphological awareness (recognizing the parts of
words that convey meaning), and getting to know which letters typically
come together and look right (like ck but never kc) is called orthographic
awareness. (Chapter 11 has full details on memorizing and rhyming tricks
to help with difficult words.)
Some people also talk about “phonographics” or “graphophonics,” which
are interchangeable terms. The phono part means sounds, and the grapho
part means written appearance, so the whole thing means getting to know
the chunks of sound inside words and how they look.
The following sections focus on skills you can work on with your
preschooler: phonemic awareness and phonics.
Listening up for phonemic awareness
Your preschooler is initially at the phonemic awareness stage, so you need
to help him hear the sounds that words are made of. What’s your best
approach?
The following activities are great for helping to develop your child’s phone-
mic awareness:
 Help your child hear the sounds in songs and rhymes by leaving key
words out when you sing them. Your child provides the words using
the rhyme as his guide.
 Have fun with alliteration (“The dotty dinosaur danced with doves”) and
read rhyming stories. Visit your library to find a good selection and ask
the librarian for suggestions. Even if a librarian can’t answer your ques-
tion off the top of her head, she has lists of award-winning books and
classics that she can print for you.

Chapter 4: Watching Your Child Carefully at a Young Age

 When your child is at the computer, encourage him to play games that
make him listen carefully. For a CD-ROM that’s specially designed to fine-
tune your child’s auditory discrimination and phonemic awareness, check
out the Earobics program. The at-home version for prekindergarten and
kindergarten children, called “Step 1,” is PC and Mac compatible and
costs $59. Find out more by logging on to www.earobics.com or calling
888-328-8199.
If you’re looking for a super fun CD-ROM that helps your child with sounds
and words without him even realizing it, check out “Bailey’s Book House.”
It has seven games, is compatible for a PC or Mac, and has been loved by
parents and teachers for years. Produced by The Learning Company, it’s
available online for $24.99 by logging on to www.learningcompany.com/
and clicking on “4-5 preschool.” It’s worth browsing this site because
plenty more popular educational CD-ROMs are available here.
Acquiring phonics skills
Once your child gets the idea that words have sounds inside them and can
come together in cute rhyming patterns, like “I saw a bear on the stair in his
underwear,” he’s ready to match sounds to letters.
You help your child remember the shapes and sounds of letters by having
him get his hands on them; a dyslexic child learns well when you help him
use all of his senses, not just his vision and hearing. Have him draw letters in
shaving foam, make them from modeling clay, and trace them on your back
with his finger. Help him remember the sound that each single letter of the
alphabet makes by associating the letter to an object or character. (I give more
phonics exercises in Chapter 12 and multisensory exercises in Chapter 14.)
When your child gets to know a letter as a story character, he remembers it
better. For example, the letter a can become Annie Apple who looks like the
letter a with a stalk and leaf attached and takes part in stories and songs.
Annie Apple is part of a program called Letterland, which originated in the
United Kingdom but is used in countries all over the world. It’s an extensive
kit of books, tapes, CDs, CD-ROMs, and flashcards, but you can get plenty of
mileage from the basic soft-cover ABC book ($9.50) and the Alphabet Songs CD
($14.50). Check out Sammy Snake, Eddie Elephant, Clever Cat, and the whole
bunch of products at www.letterland.com. For a Californian program based
on the same principles but using zoo characters, check out Zoo-phonics at
www.zoophonics.com. The basic program for home — video, cards, CD-ROM
(PC version only) and more — costs $145 (get directly to the kit at www.zoo
phonics.com/products.html).
Before you use these products, you may want to check with your child’s school.
If teachers already use Letterland, Zoo-phonics, or any other similar program,
they’ll probably want you to use the same thing too.

Preparing Your Child for Kindergarten
You want your child to be as prepared as he can be for kindergarten. If you
notice him doing things like wandering off when you read him stories, even
really interesting ones, and having no interest in writing his own name, you
especially want to make sure that his other skills are more developed (so you
have less to keep a watch over). The next sections let you know what kinder-
garten teachers hope to see in their new charges (on top of all the pre-reading
stuff I go through in the previous sections).
Stirring up good feelings about school
In a perfect world, your child starts kindergarten by bouncing straight into
the classroom and emerging hours later, radiant, and replete with newly
acquired knowledge! If he doesn’t quite cut that kind of figure, here’s the
basic feeling-good-about-school standards that his teachers hope for:
 Your child knows roughly what routine to expect in class.
 Your child understands that the teacher is there to help him.
 Your child understands that other children want to be his friends.
 Your child is mostly excited to be there.
 Your child has no real separation anxiety.
51
Chapter 4: Watching Your Child Carefully at a Young Age
Telling little kids the honest truth
Your child may show symptoms of dyslexia, like
poor fine motor coordination, before he starts
school. He may understand that he’s not quite
as skilled as friends the same age. And if that’s
the case, it’s likely that he’s more than a little
nervous about starting school. You need to pre-
pare him by giving him accurate information.
When you tell your child about school and take
him to school orientation days, be honest with
him. Saying things like “It’ll be easy” and “You’re
a big boy now” may not be quite what he needs
to hear.
A friend of mine who tried to prepare her son for
catching the school bus by telling him things
about big boys catching buses all by themselves
thought she was doing okay until her son looked
at her in disbelief and said, “Mom, I’m not big,
I’m little. Are you really just going to leave me to
catch a bus all on my own?” My friend managed
to get her son on the school bus without incident
by doing it in increments. First they followed the
bus by car, then her son caught the coming-home
bus only, and by the end of the week, her little
boy was doing the whole thing with ease.

Helping your child with language skills
If you suspect that your preschool or kindergarten child has dyslexia, you’ll
want to look closely at his language skills. Teachers hope for the following
skills, and a dyslexic child typically needs to work on at least three of them:
 Identifying the beginning sound of some words
 Recognizing rhyming sounds
 Identifying some alphabet letters
 Recognizing some common sight words, like “stop”
 Telling you a simple story
 Recognizing his written name
 Trying to write his name
For tips on strengthening basic language skills, see “Engaging in Pre-Reading
Activities at Home,” earlier in this chapter.
Nurturing other academic skills
Some children with dyslexia struggle to remember sequences of numbers and
directional concepts (like under and over). From the list here you can see that
these skills feature fairly prominently in kindergarten, so the more practice
you give your child before he starts school, the better.
 Understanding general times of day: Is it morning or late afternoon?
Most children have trouble with times of day, but a dyslexic child may
be more confused than most. Unless it’s actually dark or he’s just got up,
he can’t tell you whether it’s morning, afternoon, or evening, let alone
what hour. See Chapter 15 for tips on helping your child figure out time.
 Understanding directions such as up, down, in, out, behind, and over:
Behind or in front, left or right — which is which? That’s the kind of ques-
tion that can plague a dyslexic all his life. Many dyslexic adults like doing
practice runs when they leave familiar territory because they know that
they have little hope of following directions for getting safely back. See
Chapter 15 for help with directions.
 Counting up to 10: Many toddlers can count up to ten, and by the time
they start school, nearly all children manage it. A dyslexic child may not.
He can’t keep the sequence in his short-term memory. See Chapter 9 for
tricks on introducing simple math concepts to your child.
52
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

 Recognizing shapes (square, circle, triangle, and rectangle): The fact
that your preschooler can’t tell a circle from a square may be one of the
first things that set your alarm bells ringing. See Chapter 9 for tips on
helping your child pick out shapes.
 Tracing basic shapes: Most small children can trace around shapes soon
after they learn to hold a pencil. A dyslexic child typically draws as much
off the shape as on it.
 Naming colors: Dyslexic children may have trouble naming colors.
Psychologists testing young children for dyslexia usually include a rapid
naming test in which your child is asked to quickly name colors, objects,
numbers, and letters. To help your child remember these classifications,
spend several days on one color, such as red, before introducing others
(one at a time).
 Sorting items by color, shape, and size: If colors and shapes are hard
for your child, sorting pictures by these features is extra hard. Many
children later diagnosed with dyslexia had this kind of problem early on.
 Identifying parts of his body: If your preschooler always has trouble
naming his body parts, it’s reason to watch his progress carefully to see
if other dyslexia signs appear.
Encouraging fine motor skills
Children with dyslexia often have trouble disciplining their pencils. They have
a hard time writing letters, their fingers get all tangled up in scissors, and
threading beads and pasta tubes onto string can be a nightmare.
For a preview of the kinds of small, fiddly hand-movements, otherwise known
as fine motor skills, that teachers love to see in your child, check out this list:
 Your child puts simple puzzles (up to 12 pieces) together.
 Your child uses scissors correctly.
 Your child draws and traces with pencils.
 Your child can fasten buttons and zippers.
 Your child can unscrew lids from child-sized jars of craft materials.
The only way for your preschool child to get better with fine motor skills is to
do more of them. He needs to squeeze clay, pick up beads, fit jigsaw pieces
into place, and get his finger and hand muscles pumping. For a smorgasbord
of things to do with sandpaper, modeling clay, and gloop (a soapy, ooey, gooey
mix you make yourself), flip to Chapter 14.

Showing your child what’s sociable
Dyslexia isn’t a behavioral disorder. Your child won’t behave badly or unusu-
ally because he has dyslexia but might, of course, act up or draw attention to
himself in other ways if he’s frustrated, infuriated, or demoralized as a result
of his dyslexia. Your child’s teacher naturally (and idealistically!) hopes that
all the children in her class have the following basic social skills:
 Your child uses words, not fists.
 Your child speaks clearly.
 Your child plays with other children.
 Your child follows simple directions.
 Your child can tell you what he needs and wants.
 Your child waits his turn.
 Your child goes to the bathroom by himself.
 Your child is inquisitive and asks questions.
 Your child enjoys hearing stories.
 Your child says “please” and “thank you.”
Putting your child in charge 
of his personal information
A dyslexic child might struggle with remembering sequences of numbers, like
telephone numbers. Here are the essential things, telephone number included,
that teachers hope your child knows:
 His full name
 His age
 His address and telephone number
 His family members’ names

 Asking the teacher to help you spot dyslexia signs
W
hen your child goes to school, you can’t help wondering how she
compares to classmates. Is she keeping up? Does she have the same
strengths and weaknesses as her friends? Is she really a little slower to read
than her sister was, or is your memory hazy? In this chapter, I tell you what
does and doesn’t constitute reason for having your school-age child assessed
for dyslexia.
Understanding Why a Quick Response 
to Reading Problems Is Critical
If a teacher tells you that your 5-year-old child isn’t developmentally ready to
read, he may be right. But if he says the same thing when your child is 7, and
you can see that your child has a deep and enduring confusion with words,
he’s wrong. A few children do learn to read later than others (at age 8 or 9),
but they’re children who need motivating and Band-Aid type help, not the
ones whose difficulties go deeper and farther.
Dyslexic children don’t suddenly just “get it” but continue to struggle while
the majority of children overtake them. Their acute difficulty with written text
is obvious at ages 5 to 7, when nearly all the other kids are easily “getting it.”
Without intervention, the learning gap between your dyslexic child and her
classmates just grows and grows.

Dyslexia doesn’t just get better on its own. The quicker you treat your child’s
dyslexia, the quicker and easier it is for her to make headway. On the other
side of that coin, the longer you wait to treat your child’s reading problems,
the more they compound. She misses out on the language extension that read-
ing gives her, she misses out on all the knowledge that classmates are gaining
through their reading, her grades drop, and she dislikes school because every
classroom subject requires at least some reading.
All of this makes sense, and a lot of research supports it. Two major studies
include the Roper Poll Study in 1999 and the “Teaching Children to Read”
report in 2002. From these and other studies on how kids read and what 
happens when they struggle, here’s what we know for sure:
 Parents typically don’t have enough confidence in their own judgment
to act quickly on their child’s reading problems. They often wait over a
year before getting extra help.
 With intensive reading instruction, 95 percent of struggling children age 9
or below can achieve average reading levels.
 A quick response to your child’s reading problems is critical because older
children don’t learn to read as quickly or easily as the under-10 age group.
Only 25 percent of children age 10 and over ever catch up.
 Kindergarten and grade 1 are the best grades of all for reading interven-
tion. With intensive instruction, a kindergartner catches up to her peers
four times more quickly than a fourth grader does.
In some alternative schools, like Waldorf schools (see Chapter 7 for details),
children aren’t formally taught to read until after age 7. This isn’t a problem
for nondyslexics because in earlier grades they learn a lot of pre-reading skills,
so they’re well primed for a quick start. Your dyslexic child won’t make this
quick start and needs extra help.
So what’s the moral of this story? As soon as you see clusters of dyslexia symp-
toms (which I cover in the rest of this chapter), have your child assessed.
I talk at length about tests in Chapter 6.
When you give children extra help with reading, the young ones do best.
Children under 7 make the best progress, and children ages 7 to 10 do well
too. After age 10, however, only 25 percent of children ever catch up to grade
level. Argh, what if your child is 10, 11, 12, or older? Don’t panic. The statistics
sound alarming, but you’re reading this book, so you’re obviously a person
who gets things done. It’s never too late for someone to learn to read, but the
key, as with all things that are worth doing, is to practice consistently and fre-
quently. Your older child needs to work harder and longer than she would
56
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

have if she were starting her remediation at age 5, but she can still achieve
the same end. Chapter 2 has the scoop on symptoms you see in older kids
and teens; when you’ve determined that your older child or teen indeed has
dyslexia, check out Chapter 16 for ways to help her succeed.
Noticing Dyslexic-like Behaviors at Home
If you’re not sure whether your child struggles enough with reading and writing
for it to be something to worry about, she’ll probably provide you with the
answer. Children who struggle in class soon realize that they are low perform-
ers and find ways to internalize or externalize their hurt.
In the next sections I talk about ways in which you can deal with three fairly
typical behaviors your dyslexic child may display at home: unhappiness, 
disorganization, and, of course, the constant struggle with words.
Your own observations of your child’s behavior are just as important as obser-
vations that the teacher makes and test results. Many dyslexic-like behaviors
are things you see at home, and of course, you’re in the best position to see
whether your child is beginning to dislike school. Your child usually puts on
her best face for the teacher, so if you jot down the fact that your child tells
you she’s sick every morning before school, but makes a quick recovery on
weekends, you can confidently let her teacher know. If the teacher says some-
thing like “But she’s so happy in class,” you won’t start doubting your own
memory. Jot down specific incidents and dates so you have a full-color pic-
ture of how your child is doing. Jot down the good things too so you can see
whether certain times in school are better for your child than others.
Struggling with written words
Dyslexic children always struggle with written words. Your dyslexic child
probably dislikes reading, making mistakes like reading was for saw and horse
for house and skipping right past small words like it. When she writes, she
likely puts letters in the wrong order inside words (called transposing), leaves
out letters all together (called omissions), and faces letters like b and d the
wrong way (called reversals). These actions are all typical signs that your child
may have dyslexia. I go into more detail about these and other word-based
signs in the sections “Laboring with reading” and “Writing with difficulty,”
later in this chapter.
57
Chapter 5: Acting Quickly with Your School-Age Child

The information that you probably want most from this book is how to help
your child develop her reading and writing skills. I devote whole chapters to
those answers too (see Part IV), but so that you have an outline of the impor-
tant points, in simple terms, here’s what the research says:
 Your child needs to do plenty of phonemic and phonics activities because
she lacks matching-letters-to-sounds skills. (Phonemic activities teach your
child that words are made of sounds. Phonics instruction shows your child
how to match letters and letter combinations to those sounds.) I give you
a wide variety of phonological activities to try in Chapter 12.
 The best instruction for dyslexic children is structured, systematic, and
explicit instruction in phonics, delivered through multisensory activities
(check out Chapter 14 for more about these activities).
Feeling unhappy
Your child knows she’s at the bottom of the class in reading, doesn’t like
going to school, and dreads getting homework. What can you do about it?
You can tackle her unhappiness by talking it over with her. Let her know that
you realize she feels humiliated because she can’t read like the other kids
(even ones that don’t seem as bright as her), that you know she tries hard,
and that you want to help. Together you can pinpoint her specific difficulties,
do reading and writing exercises to help reduce her problems, and get an
assessment for dyslexia. (I give you more details about building your child’s
self-esteem with positive talk in Chapter 15.)
And, perhaps most immediately helpful to your child, you can tell her about
dyslexia and the many gifted and famous people who have it. Children with
dyslexia nearly always say that when they realized that clever and talented
people have dyslexia, they felt empowered, inspired, and happier! (See Chap-
ter 2 for a list of famous folks with dyslexia.)
Being disorganized
At school your child has a messy notebook, desk, and locker. At home her
whole daily schedule is slightly off course. She has trouble getting ready on
time, turning up where she’s supposed to be, and doing whatever it was you
asked her to do.
58
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

The best advice that parents of dyslexics say they have for helping a child
with her disorganization is to forget about fighting it. Your child is unlikely to
one day wake up with a perfectly organized mind and military-like habits to
match, but she can harness every helping device known to civilized man. In
Chapter 15 I talk at length about understanding clocks and calendars, estab-
lishing and keeping a morning routine, and other organizational issues. For
now, however, you just need to know that, while your child may never be a
virtual Mary Poppins, she can at least be a girl whose pocket organizer and
cell phone pretty much organize her life for her!
Asking Your Child’s Teacher to Look 
for Dyslexic-like Behaviors in Class
You need to be able to talk about dyslexic-like behaviors with your child’s
teacher so that your child’s difficulties don’t get brushed off as her not being
“developmentally ready.” It’s easy to mistake dyslexia for more superficial read-
ing problems, so if you’re at all uncertain, tell the teacher what you’re thinking
(and the dyslexic symptoms you see), so you’re both on the same page.
You want your child’s teacher to help you monitor your child’s behavior and
pinpoint where she needs help. Start by telling him what behaviors you’ve
noticed in your child and how persistent they’ve been. Phrase what you say
in terms of your child (“Jane has trouble reading long worksheets”). Ask the
teacher what he’s observed and what test results and examples of your
child’s work he can show you. Jot down what he tells you, what you tell him,
and what you ask for. The paper trail that you start now will be handy later
on, as a baseline, so date it and make it as much of an at-a-glance document
(with headings and bullet points) as you can.
In the next sections, I take a close look at your child’s reading, writing, and
spelling and then list other symptoms her teacher can look out for in class. If
the teacher is receptive to your comments, you may want to give him a copy
of these symptoms so he can simply check off any that he sees. (I provide more
information on working effectively with your child’s teachers in Chapter 10.)
An indicator of dyslexia that the teacher doesn’t see, but that you can tell
him about, is family history. If someone in your family has dyslexia, your
child’s chances of having it are greatly increased. See Chapter 2 for more
details on the link between dyslexia and family history.
59
Chapter 5: Acting Quickly with Your School-Age Child

Laboring with reading
When you take a close look at the way your child reads, you see that what at
first looks like a big muddle in fact has patterns. A dyslexic child makes par-
ticular kinds of reading errors:
 She reads a word on one page but doesn’t recognize it on the next page
or the next day.
 She reads single words (without story line or other clues) slowly and
inaccurately.
 She misreads words as other words with the same first and last letters
or shape, saying things like “form” instead of “from” or “trial” instead of
“trail.”
 She adds or leaves out letters, saying things like “could” instead of
“cold” or “star” instead of “stair.”
 She reads a word that has the same letters, but in a different sequence,
like “who” instead of “how,” “lots” instead of “lost,” “saw” instead of “was,”
or “girl” instead of “grill.” And when she makes these kinds of mistakes
without pausing or trying to figure out whether what she’s reading makes
sense, it clues you in that she’s not comprehending what she’s reading.
 She confuses look-alike letters like b and d, b and p, n and u, or m and w.
 She substitutes similar-looking words, like “house” for “horse,” even
though they change the meaning of the sentence.
 She substitutes a word that means the same thing but doesn’t look at all
similar, like “trip” for “journey” or “cry” for “weep.”
 She misreads, leaves out, or adds small words like “an,” “a,” “from,” “the,”
“to,” “were,” “are,” and “of.”
 She leaves out or changes suffixes, saying, for example, “need” for
“needed,” “talks” for “talking,” or “soft” for “softly.”
 She reads out loud with a slow, choppy cadence. Her phrases aren’t
smooth, and she often ignores punctuation.
 She may be visibly tired after reading for only a short time.
 Her reading comprehension is poor because she spends so much energy
trying to figure out words. Her listening comprehension is usually heaps
better.
 She may have trouble tracking (following words and lines across pages).
She skips words or whole lines of text.
 She tries to avoid reading or other close-up tasks and has plenty of
excuses on hand for why she can’t read right now.
60
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

 She needs a lot of snacking, bathroom, or resting time between very
short bouts of actual reading.
 She complains of physical problems, like eyestrain, red or watery eyes,
headaches, dizziness, or a stomachache, when she reads.
 She squints, frowns, rubs her eyes, tilts her head, or covers one eye to
read and holds books too closely to her eyes.
 She complains of words moving or running off the paper.
Writing with difficulty
A child with dyslexia usually shows a huge difference between her ability to tell
you something and her ability to write it down. She tends to do the following:
 Avoid writing.
 Write everything as one continuous sentence.
 Not understand punctuation. She doesn’t use capitals or periods or uses
them randomly.
 Not understand the difference between a complete sentence and a frag-
ment of a sentence.
 Misspell many words even when she uses only very simple ones and is
“sure” she knows how to spell them.
 Mixes up b and d, m and n, and other look-alike letters.
Many people think that letter reversals are a sure sign of dyslexia, but
that’s not strictly true. Most dyslexic children do reverse letters when
they write, but this alone doesn’t make a child dyslexic, and many chil-
dren (dyslexic and nondyslexic alike) reverse a few letters in their writing
up to about grade 2.
 Take ages to write.
 Write illegibly.
 Use odd spacing between her words. She may ignore margins completely
and pack sentences tightly on the page instead of spreading them out.
 Use a mix of print and cursive and/or upper- and lowercase.
 Not notice her spelling errors. She reads back what she wanted to say,
not what she actually wrote.
 Use both hands for writing up to about age 7. Most children choose a
dominant hand at about age 5.
61
Chapter 5: Acting Quickly with Your School-Age Child

If your child does many of the things I list here and writing is her conspicuous
Achilles’ heel, she may have dysgraphia (also called a visual-motor integration
problem), a kind of dyslexia characterized by poor, often illegible handwriting.
Chapter 2 had the full scoop on dysgraphia.
Making predictable spelling errors
Typically, a dyslexic child spells far worse than she reads. Her spelling looks
like the “inventive” kind that teachers expect to see in emergent readers in
grades K to 2 even when she’s well past those grades. She has particular diffi-
culty with vowel sounds and often leaves them out. With much effort, she may
be able to memorize Monday’s spelling list long enough to pass the spelling
test on Friday, but she can’t spell the same words two hours later when she
wants to write them in sentences.
A child with dyslexia also does the following:
 Misspells frequently used words, like “they,” “what,” “where,” “does,”
and “because,” despite practicing and practicing
 Misspells words even when she’s copying them from the board or a sheet
 Has erasures, cross outs and undetected errors all through her writing
62
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 
Having the gift of dyslexia
Many talented people have dyslexia, which has
led some folks to regard dyslexia as a gift. They
say that the incidence of dyslexia among gifted
people is higher than it is among nondyslexic
people and that dyslexics tend to have engi-
neering and creative types of talent. I just need to
alert you to the fact that your child can be both
gifted and dyslexic at the same time. Whether
your child’s dyslexia enhances or stymies her
talents is a whole different matter. The dyslexia-
is-a-gift contingency maintains that dyslexic
people do excel in certain areas:
 They are good at hands-on learning and
seem, almost intuitively, to figure out how to
do things.
 They have strong graphical skills and can
visualize objects in a moved or altered state.
 Dyslexic children tend to excel in construct-
ing models, coloring, and drawing.
 At an early age they are extra curious about
how things work and love to tear things apart
and rebuild or fix them.
 They love to invent things and have mechan-
ical talent.
 They have vivid imaginations. They are cre-
ative and known for their musical ability.
 They can view the world from different points
of view. They can process so much infor-
mation that if it’s not filtered, what begins as
a talent ends up being a tangled mass of
confusion.

Coping with other classroom 
tasks and issues
If your child has dyslexia, her teacher should spot many of the reading, writ-
ing and spelling errors I list in the previous sections. Other things may be
conspicuously out of line with your child’s intellect and bright personality:
 Noticeable and unexpected low achievement
 Conspicuous disorganization
 Distractibility or a short attention span
 Hardly any sense of direction
 Persistent left/right confusion
 Difficulty making sense of instructions
 Difficulty remembering words and learning new words
 Immature speech (such as “gween” for “green”)
 Inability to always understand what is said to her
 Difficulty finding appropriate words in telling stories
 Trouble with time, counting, and calculating
 Difficulty sequencing days of the week and months of the year
 Failure to finish work on time
 Appearance of being lazy, unmotivated, or frustrated
 Awkwardness/clumsiness
Behaving unusually
The following sections cover problematic behaviors that a dyslexic child may
display at school.
Acting invisible
Dyslexic children develop all sorts of strategies to cover up their weakness in
reading and writing. Being an obliging, sweet-natured, no-trouble child who
blends into the background in school is one of them. When teachers describe
your child in too-good-to-be-true terms, beware! Many dyslexic children manage
to go through whole grades in school without being noticed. They become
masters of cover-up, and no one realizes what’s going on. This is all fine and
dandy in the short term but has disastrous long-term consequences, such as
when your child fails school tests and you’ve wasted precious time when you
could’ve been giving her extra help.
63
Chapter 5: Acting Quickly with Your School-Age Child

So if you see that your child is learning the art of invisibility in class, help her
learn new things. She needs to develop phonemic awareness (the awareness
that words are made from a limited number of chunks of sound — see Chap-
ter 12 for more details) and asking-for-help strategies.
Making trouble
A bunch of children are sitting outside the principal’s office, and your child is
one of them. She’s in trouble for misbehaving, acting silly, or giving the impres-
sion that even if the president himself is asking her to tow the line, she’s not
going to.
Children commonly react to academic failure by failing in behavior. Why?
Because then all eyes are on your child’s bad behavior and not on her failure in
reading and writing. She’s labeled as unruly, but that’s much easier for her to
bear than being thought of as “dumb.” Watch out for bad behavior. Remember
that bad behavior is a symptom of something deeper. And whatever you do,
don’t take it personally!
It’s really important to pinpoint bad behavior and nip it in the bud before it
gets out of hand or becomes a habit for your child. Does the behavior happen
at certain times, only during some lessons (like reading time), or in reaction
to a certain set of conditions? Don’t focus on the “behavior problem,” but
instead, work as a team with the school to determine the real root of the
behavior.
When your child drives you and everyone else crazy and you feel like she’s
dragging your whole family down, remember that bad behavior masks other
things. Your child is stressed, and her misbehavior is a way of showing it. She
doesn’t really mean to hurt you; it’s just that she’s hurt, angry, and frightened
herself. Try to break the problem down into small bits and tackle one bit at a
time. Look for practical solutions. Don’t blame her — or yourself.

Chapter 6
Testing Your Child for Dyslexia
In This Chapter
 Clarifying when you need a test
 Finding out about different tests and administrators
 Getting your child ready to undergo testing
 Making good use of test results
 Deciding not to test
You’ve watched your child struggle with homework, seen other kids out-
strip him in class, and at times wondered whether his teacher is too busy
to see what’s really going on. Now you want answers:
 What exactly is my child struggling with?
 Does he have dyslexia?
 How do I have him tested?
 If he takes a test, will he get extra help?
In this chapter I give you the answers to these questions and more.
Before you even get started with having your child tested for dyslexia, you
need to be comfortable with the term “dyslexia” and help your child get 
comfortable with it, too. But wait, you’ve heard your school talking about a
“learning disability (LD)” or a “specific learning disability (SLD),” so which
term — dyslexia, LD, or SLD — should you be psyching up for? Probably all of
them! Don’t worry too much about this, but know that different school districts
use different terminology to mean the same thing. LD and SLD are accepted
terms wherever you are, but in many school districts that’s where the classifi-
cation ends. Dyslexia is one type of SLD, but to avoid excessive terminology and
paperwork, and hence get applications for special education moving quickly,
districts may document dyslexia as SLD and teachers may talk about dyslexia
as simply LD.

If your child attends a private school, a whole different set of rules applies.
Or there may be no rules to govern how a learning disability is assessed and
provided for. In public schools you have the legal right to an assessment and
special education if your child is found to have a learning disability. You don’t
get this legal cover in a private school, and each individual school makes its
own autonomous decisions.
Deciding When to Get a Diagnosis
A great reason for having your child diagnosed is to find out exactly what’s
going wrong for him, especially if other people tell you he’s doing okay and
you suspect he’s really not! But that’s just a part of it. Here are a whole bunch
of reasons to head purposefully toward someone with letters after her name
and assessment tools in front her:
 You find out whether your child has dyslexia.
 You find out whether he has other problems, like attention-deficit hyper-
activity disorder (ADHD) or dysgraphia (difficulty with writing).
 You get a baseline from which to gauge your child’s progress.
 If your child qualifies as having an LD, he gets special education. Special
education is the extra help a child gets when he’s diagnosed with an LD.
It usually means he sees the resource teacher a few times each week.
The resource teacher is trained to deliver special education to the children
who are eligible for it. She usually has her own room in school in which
she teaches special programs to small groups of children. (See Chapter 8
for more about this education.)
 Test results help your child’s teacher understand his difficulties and
make accommodations for him.
 You get insight into the best help you can give your child at home.
When your child struggles with reading, you hear a lot of “wait awhile” advice.
You’re told things like your child isn’t “developmentally ready” to read yet or
“he’ll grow out of it” or “plenty of children start reading late.”
Most children start to read between the ages of 5 and 7 and make their quick-
est progress at this time. This time period is a window of opportunity in your
child’s reading development, so if you see that this window isn’t opening up
for him, act quickly. He needs extra help right now. Trust your instincts. If you
think your child is falling behind, he most likely is, even if teachers tell you he’s
doing fine. Don’t get delayed or sidetracked by bad (albeit well-intentioned)
advice. Research shows clearly and unequivocally that for struggling kids the
“wait awhile” notion is just plain wrong.
66
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

Up to age 10, your dyslexic child can still make great progress if he’s given
good help. After age 10, things get harder. He needs more help more often,
and you must be sure that whoever helps him (that person can be you) is
homing in on his weak skills. I talk about the essential skills that dyslexics
lack in Chapters 3, 4, and 5.
It’s never too late to find out whether you or your child has dyslexia. In fact,
the older you get, the easier the testing process becomes. Older children and
adults are experienced and articulate. They can demonstrate their dyslexia
by giving a complete verbal account of their difficulties. A psychologist may
need to give them only one or two formal tests. See Chapter 18 for specific
info on testing adults for dyslexia.
Examining Different Kinds of Tests
Names, names, names. When your child is assessed for dyslexia, you may hear
so many fancy test names that pretty soon you’ll be screaming for mercy.
And figuring out exactly what each test measures can be an uphill slog too.
In this section I make things easy for you. I classify tests according to what
they measure and give you a smattering of those scary, long-winded titles.
Adults are better able to describe their difficulties to a psychologist than chil-
dren are, so adult testing for dyslexia usually entails a bit of talking. An adult
may take a test, such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-Revised,
as a measure of his general ability. In addition, he takes reading and writing
tests similar to the ones that I list here (only they’re adjusted for adults) and
gives a full personal account of his school life and literacy skills.
Looking at language tests for preschoolers
Did you know that your school district can test your child for speech and lan-
guage development even before he starts school? Well, it’s true and worth
looking into if you’re the least bit concerned about your 3- or 4-year-old
(see Chapter 4 to find out more about signs to watch for in your preschooler).
Call your district and keep the number handy. The district is responsible
for any testing you may need in future. Additional options for testing include
colleges (ones that have child health and development courses) and indepen-
dent speech and language centers (log onto www.speechville.com for a
database of services in your state). You can also get great advice from the
American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) at www.asha.org,
phone 800-638-TALK (8255).
67
Chapter 6: Testing Your Child for Dyslexia

When your child is in school, the school district is responsible for testing her
for learning disabilities. If you want a second opinion or can make a case that
the district isn’t sufficiently staffed or resourced to give you proper testing,
then the district must pay for you to get proper assessment elsewhere.
Speech difficulties are not the same thing as dyslexia and can’t result in your
child getting dyslexia (because dyslexia is there from birth). But untreated
speech difficulties can make dyslexia worse, and even if your child doesn’t
have dyslexia, can lead to reading difficulties further down the line.
Preschooler language tests give your child the opportunity to listen and talk,
look and talk, and chat generally about things. You can be fairly sure that at
some point the speech therapist will show your child pictures and ask ques-
tions such as “What is this?” What is happening?” and “How is this different?”
Making sense of vision and hearing tests
If you’re worried that your child rubs his eyes all the time or seems to respond
to you only when you ask him something for the third or fourth time, head
straight to your doctor. Don’t be afraid to get a second opinion either.
Early testing is best. Your child gets routine vision and hearing tests in the
first two years of school, but if you suspect a problem earlier (or later), see
your doctor.
The symptoms in the following list are all possible signs of a vision problem:
 Head tilting
 Squinting
 Rubbing eyes frequently
 Holding books at an unusual angle or distance
 Headaches
 Dizziness
 Tiredness
Here are some possible signs of a hearing problem:
 A lot of ear infections
 Excessive shouting and talking loudly
 Not answering you
 Mishearing words
 Frequently asking you to repeat yourself
68
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (www.
aaaai.org/patients/publicedmat/tips/recurrentinfections.stm),
your child is having too many infections if he gets more than four per year.
There are two types of ear infection: outer and middle ear. Outer ear infections
are most often caused by swimming, but middle ear infections are linked to
all sorts of factors, such as having had a respiratory tract infection or having
been exposed to secondary smoking. For plenty of good information on ear
infections and speech delays, check out www.keepkidshealthy.com/
welcome/infectionsguide/earinfections.html.
Routine eye tests at school detect obvious visible defects in your child’s eyes
(such as cataracts, squints, or crossed eyes) and whether your child can
follow movement in his field of vision (up, down, and side to side) and is not
short- or long-sighted. Secondary-school-age children may also be tested for
color-blindness. Routine hearing tests detect whether your child’s hearing is
within the normal range of volume (loudness) and pitch (high and low sounds).
You need to know that vision and hearing tests may not tell you about visual
and auditory “discrimination” (or “perception” or “awareness”). You may
hear these terms in a dyslexia assessment, and they have nothing to do with
whether your child receives visual and sound information. The terms refer to
how your child processes (or doesn’t process) information.
If vision and hearing tests don’t tell you anything about dyslexia, why have
them done? To rule out vision and hearing problems that look like dyslexia
or to fix up these problems so they don’t make your child’s dyslexia worse.
(If you treat vision and hearing issues and your child still struggles with read-
ing and writing, it could be dyslexia.)
In dyslexia assessment, visual discrimination is your child’s ability to tell the
difference between different letters and different orientations of a letter.
Auditory discrimination is the ability to identify different sounds in words;
it’s often used synonymously with phonological (or phonemic) awareness.
Surveying early screening tests
Schools typically test, or screen, children for reading problems halfway
through kindergarten or in first grade. A 5-year-old child can be tested for
dyslexia (remember that schools usually call it “learning disability”) even
though he can’t yet read because he should still have pre-reading skills.
He should be able to do the following:
 Name the letters, such as ay, bee, see.
 Tell you the letter sounds — “a” (like in apple), “buh,” and “cuh.”
 Play with letter sounds, such as words with similar letters (bat, ball, bench)
or rhyming words (cat, hat, mat).
69
Chapter 6: Testing Your Child for Dyslexia

If your child can’t do these things (whether or not a test picks it up), he needs
extra practice, and you may want more testing. To find out exactly how to give
your child extra practice, flip to Chapter 12.
Understanding IQ tests
An IQ (Intelligence Quotient) test measures your child’s aptitude or what he’s
capable of. (Psychologists don’t always say that IQ tests measure “aptitude.”
They may use the words “potential” or “ability.”) Two tests pretty much dom-
inate the field:
 Wechsler Intelligence Score for Children III (WISC III)
 Stanford Binet IV (SBIV)
Your child must be at least 6 years old to take the WISC III, but children as
young as 2 years old can take the SBIV! Both tests measure a whole bunch
of stuff, like long-term memory (what day comes after Thursday?), practical
knowledge (what should you do when you cut yourself?), and visual discri-
mination (which pictures look the same?).
Comprehensive IQ tests like the WISC III and SBIV are typically part of the
battery of tests used by psychologists to determine whether your child has
dyslexia or any other learning disability. They can be administered only by
psychologists, and from them you get measures of many subskills.
IQ tests have been around for a long time because psychologists have con-
sidered them to be among the most reliable tests of ability that we have.
Theoretically, your child’s IQ score should stay pretty much the same regard-
less of what kind of a day he’s having. Even if he’s nervous, hot, hungry, sick,
or upset, his good old IQ score shouldn’t change all that much.
Some parents find that their child’s test results are very different, depending
on factors like who gives the test. When their child feels uncomfortable, he
scores lower than when he likes the test administrator and feels relaxed.
One huge flaw in IQ testing has been brought before the courts in California.
The IQ test (as part of the testing for LD) was ruled biased against African
Americans because as a group, their scores were unreasonably low and led to
their overrepresentation in special education. As a result, it looks like the IQ
test and the IQ discrepancy way of determining whether a child has a learning
disability will be ditched nationwide. What’s IQ discrepancy all about? If your
child’s IQ is average or above but his performance on language and other per-
formance tests is below average, he has an IQ discrepancy. As a rule of thumb,
if a psychologist finds that your child is performing at a level about two years
below his actual age and has a normal IQ, it shows he needs special education,
and the psychologist must look closer at his tests and identify his disability.
70
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

Because of increasing criticism of the IQ discrepancy way of testing for LD,
a lot of people (who know what they’re talking about!) want a response-to-
instruction way to test for LD. This means that a child is monitored after
being given extra instruction, and if he doesn’t improve (in response to that
instruction), a diagnosis of LD may be made. Using this process, test findings
are more directly tied in to subsequent instruction.
For the time being, in most places, the IQ test is still key in the test battery
used to identify an LD (I talk about the battery later in this chapter). If your
child scores much lower in tests of skills (like reading, writing, and spelling)
than he does on a test of his IQ, it shows that his performance is lower than
you’d expect from his aptitude (his IQ). He officially has an LD.
A psychologist also may find discrepancy within the IQ test because the IQ
test has several parts that measure things like verbal IQ and performance IQ.
Picking out performance tests
An IQ test (covered in the previous section) measures your child’s aptitude —
what he’s capable of regardless of how he performs. Other tests are designed
to measure your child’s performance. You may want to grab yourself a coffee
and a snack because a lot of performance tests are out there! I divide the tests
into four simple groups:
 General skills
 Auditory and visual motor skills
 Phonologic skills
 Oral reading
These tests are part of the battery for assessing dyslexia. Because dyslexia is
mostly about reading problems, your child can’t really get tested before about
age 6, but once he is in grade 1 (or above) and reading just isn’t happening
for him, you can have him tested.
Testing for general skills
Many performance tests give you a big picture of how your child is doing.
They measure things like reading, math, writing, and general knowledge.
The test administrator especially looks for a gap between your child’s written
and oral skills because dyslexics are typically bright and knowledgeable in
most oral tasks but weak at reading and writing tasks (that seem simple to
other people). That’s why parents get mystified. They know that their child is
bright and clever; therefore, they can’t understand why his reading and writ-
ing, and some aspects of his spoken language, make it look the opposite.
71
Chapter 6: Testing Your Child for Dyslexia

Here are some of the popular tests of general skills:
 California Achievement Test (CAT)
 Detroit Test of Learning Aptitude (DTLA-3)
 Peabody Individual Achievement Test-Revised (PIAT-R)
 Wide-Range Achievement Test (WRAT-3)
 Woodcock Johnson Psycho Educational Battery
Testing for auditory and visual motor skills
A test battery for dyslexia typically includes at least one test of auditory
skills and one test of visual motor skills. Here are some you may hear 
about:
 Test of Auditory Perceptual Skills (TAPS): Does your child mishear
directions, say the wrong word (“steps” instead of “ladder”) or leave
words out of his speech altogether? If so, a psychologist may use this
test to measure his auditory perceptual skills, or how he processes the
information he hears (auditory means hearing).
 Lindamood Auditory Conceptualization Test (LAC): Here’s another test
of auditory skills. This one measures how well your child identifies letter
sounds on their own and inside words.
The word “Lindamood” crops up a lot in reading tests and programs
because Ms. Pat Lindamood has written, alone and with colleagues
(Ms. Nanci Bell), reading tests and programs (Lindamood-Bell Program)
that are popular in schools all over the United States.
 Bender-Gestalt Test for Young Children: This is a test of visual-motor
integration, or how well your child draws what he sees. If your child has
a lot of trouble with this kind of task, it means he may have, or be at risk
of having, LD.
 Beery Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration: This test mea-
sures visual-motor integration too. Your psychologist will probably choose
either the Bender-Gestalt or the Beery depending on his familiarity with
either one and what your school district requires.
Testing for phonologic skills
Whether the teacher gives your child a five-minute test or the psychologist
puts him through five hours of testing, someone will look at your child’s
phonologic skills. That’s because dyslexia is a phonologically based condi-
tion. A dyslexic’s problem isn’t that he can’t see or hear letters and words;
it’s that he can’t easily process, in his brain, the letter/sound/word information
(the phonologic stuff) that he hears and sees. A child may be bright and
be able to tell you about complex things but has trouble identifying letters
(and some numbers), reading, spelling words, and sometimes recalling
(from his head) the word he wants to use when he’s talking.
72
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

You really need to understand what these tests do rather than what names
they go by. In plain terms, they ask your child the following kinds of things:
 Can you tell me the name of this picture?
 Can you point to the word that names this picture?
 If you take p off pat and put c there instead, what do you get?
 Can you write stamp? Can you read these funny sounds: isk, eemp, thalep?
Many tests of phonologic skills don’t have “phon” in their names so you have
to figure out for yourself that they’re testing phonologic skills! The tests here
do have “phon” in their names, so it’s easy to see what they’re all about.
 Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing in Reading (CTOPP)
 Phonological Awareness Test (PAT)
 Togesen-Bryant Test of Phonological Awareness (TOPA)
 Yopp-Singer Test of Phoneme Segmentation
Testing oral reading
A dyslexia assessment can test every kind of language and problem-solving
skill you can think of, and math and reasoning, too. Here’s one last test that
you’re really likely to hear about. The Gray Oral Reading Test has been around
a long time. Psychologists like to listen to your child read because when he
hates doing it, is slow, and makes a lot of mistakes, it’s a good sign he’s dyslexic.
The Gray Test measures the number and types of mistake your child makes
with oral reading and is a real favorite.
Charging up for a test battery
When you look into the possibility of having your child tested for dyslexia,
you find people talking about a battery of tests or a test battery. What they
mean is a whole bunch of tests, both IQ and performance, that measure a
whole bunch of skills.
The school or, more specifically, the school district, puts your child through
a battery of tests to decide whether he has a learning disability (LD). To have
this testing done, you must give a written request to your school district or
to the school district via your school principal. The district is legally obliged
to reply to your request (within a set time, usually 60 days) and test your
child, as long as your child is clearly struggling in class. If testing reveals
that your child qualifies as having an LD, he gets special education and an
IEP (Individualized Education Program). You can read more about special
education and the IEP in Chapter 8.
When you decide to file your request for testing, it’s often because a teacher
recommends that you do.
73
Chapter 6: Testing Your Child for Dyslexia

Choosing Your Test Administrator Wisely
You can have your child tested for dyslexia by the school educational psy-
chologist (who works for your school district) or by an outside, independent
educational psychologist (whom you pay). Or you can do both. In the next
sections, I walk you through your options.
Selecting a specialist within 
your child’s school district
The first person you need to go to when you want your child to be assessed
in school is the classroom teacher. The courteous thing to do is to see your
child’s teacher before you see anyone else. Besides, if you skip her in the
chain of command, it can come back to haunt you. You may ask the school
psychologist for help only to find that he sends you right back to the teacher
to start your quest at the right place. But even if that doesn’t happen, you
want your child’s teacher on board from the outset so she knows you’re con-
cerned and ready to push your child’s case. Hopefully, she agrees that your
child should be tested and alerts the right people, and testing happens within
a few weeks. Better still, she preempts you and asks you for your consent to
have your child tested.
74
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 
Taking the do-it-yourself testing route
I’ve been told that I can find anything I want on
the Web, but I haven’t wanted all that much until
now. But now I want online testing that isn’t just
a pile of junk, and guess what, it’s out there! If you
want to test your child yourself (or test yourself!),
you can create a relaxed atmosphere, behave
like a detached but kindly administrator, and see
what you turn up.
Here are some places to start your search for
online tests:
 Worldwide tests that purport to measure
dyslexia: www.dyslexia-test.com.
 British Schonell Reading Test: http://
members.tripod.com/~gleigh/
readtst.htm. This test is alive and well
even though I remember it being popular with
resource teachers, then called “remedial”
teachers, 20 years ago.
 British Burt Reading Test and the Schonell
Spelling Test: Reading Reform Foundation at
www.rrf.org.uk.
 Australian read-aloud tests and spelling tests:
www.literacytesting.com.
Anyone can use these tests (no matter where
you live), but they’re obviously not the same as
personal face-to-face tests, so you may want to
use them just as a starting point.

In either case, you give your written request, it goes to the district, and the
district psychologist has your child take a battery of tests. Other people (like
the resource teacher) can help the psychologist with some of the tests in the
battery, but only he is qualified to administer the IQ test. (If your psycholo-
gist doesn’t use an IQ test, he’ll use another test, like the Woodcock Johnson
Psycho Educational Battery.) The psychologist’s interpretation of test results
is key to the decision your school district makes. Then you’re asked to come
to a meeting at school where you’re told the results and the actions that the
district proposes in response to them.
What are the pros of this option? If your child is tested in school, it’s free.
You have fewer bureaucratic steps to take. You know that the district accepts
the assessment results, the teacher is already in the loop, and your child gets
special education, no questions asked, if test results show he’s dyslexic.
On the con side, you get no choice of who carries out the tests, you can’t
choose the venue, and you get no voice about the testing day. Also, the 
psychologist is sure to be very busy, so you may wonder later (if you’re 
skeptical about the test results) whether he did a thorough job.
Investigating independent testers outside
your child’s school district
Plenty of people can test your child, but typically only a psychologist can give
you test results that are accepted by school districts. In addition, insurance
companies may contribute toward the cost of testing only when it’s given by
a psychologist. Other practitioners, who usually call themselves consultants,
therapists, or tutors, can give you an assessment that helps you (or them)
design a practical program for your child, but they typically don’t give a
dyslexia assessment. (They refer you to a psychologist because they know
about the school district/insurance company thing.)
The title “consultant” or “therapist” implies that the practitioner has more
qualifications than a tutor. It may even mean that the person is qualified 
(usually with a psychologist’s certification) to provide you with a diagnosis
that your school district will recognize. You’ll want to check this out by
asking the therapist what her qualifications are and then running this past
your school district.
Only some practitioners use the term “dyslexia,” so if you want to hear about
dyslexia in a diagnosis, make sure you find out whether a practitioner is look-
ing for it before you hire him. If he doesn’t specifically look for dyslexia, find
someone who does.
75
Chapter 6: Testing Your Child for Dyslexia

What are the pros of using an independent tester? Why do people pay for inde-
pendent testing (which can run into thousands of dollars)? Here are five good
reasons to opt for independency:
 The district won’t test your child. It’s not heartless but feels that your
child definitely won’t qualify for extra help and the money it would cost
to test him should go to needier kids.
It’s unusual for the district to refuse your request for assessment because
if you get your child tested independently and results show that he is eli-
gible for extra help, the district could (legally) be in a tricky spot.
 The district says it will test your child, but you don’t want to wait (usually
for up to 60 days — the time most districts typically specify).
 The district already tested your child, but you’re not in full agreement
with the results. You want a second opinion.
 Your child is embarrassed by his problems. He doesn’t want any kind of
special education and will accept only the most low-key help. You want
to protect his self-esteem (he has a hard enough time as it is) and don’t
see this as a battle you can really win. You can afford to pay for private
services, so you decide to get private practitioners to assess and tutor
your child.
 You place importance on having control over who gives the test (you
want someone who’s nice to your child) and when and where it’s given.
You want confidentiality, too (you may not want the school to know the
test results).
What’s the down side of independent testing? You pay for it. If you want your
child’s school to know the results (which is advisable but still your choice),
you must make a time to see the teacher and then explain the situation. In
that case, you’ll have a lot of photocopying and distributing of information
to do.
For a list of independent educational psychologists, ask your school district.
To find parents, therapists, and dyslexia groups who can advise you, check
out Appendix B. Another resource to call is a nearby university. Education,
psychology, or special education departments often offer courses and summer
classes for children as part of their research into learning disabilities.
Adults use an independent psychologist for assessment unless they’re assessed
through a government-funded vocational rehabilitation (VR) office. Chapter 18
has the details of getting an assessment when you’re an adult.

Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

Preparing Your Child (And Yourself) 
for Testing
Before the school tests your child, give your child’s teacher any paperwork
you’ve saved, like pediatric reports, vision and hearing test results, and a list of
things you’ve observed your child struggling with. She can give the paperwork
to the district psychologist, or alternatively, you can deliver the information
to your district office yourself. If you’re having tests done by someone out-
side of the school system, give him all the same information and your child’s
school reports, too.
Giving the test administrator the information you have well before the test
makes good sense. He needs time to look it over so he can use it as another
piece in his complete diagnosis.
This checklist gives you the material to gather together to make a portfolio
for your child:
 A brief account of when your child started to walk and talk
 A brief account of warning signs you’ve seen (see Chapters 3, 4, and 5
for more about general and specific symptoms)
 A brief account of things your child’s teachers have said about him and
the kinds of reading instruction they’ve given him
 Medical information (especially about eyes and ears)
 Formal tests and reports from school
 Samples of his writing and spelling
 Samples of books (or lists of books) he reads
 Lists of words that are hard for him to read and write
Tests are scary for most people, but for a dyslexic, who’s used to low
scores and embarrassment, they can be much worse. Remember to tell
your child that he’s being tested so he can do better and not feel so bad
in class. Tell him there are no wrong answers or grades. Walk him through
some practice questions too (ask the teacher for some) so that he knows
how to mark his answers (if he has to pencil in boxes or circle the right
answer) and pace himself, and what to do if he doesn’t know the answer 
to a question.
77
Chapter 6: Testing Your Child for Dyslexia

One aspect of testing that you may want to mentally prepare yourself for is
the parent questionnaire. A teacher or psychologist may ask you to fill out
a questionnaire, which you probably won’t like, before your child is tested.
The questions include things like these:
 Was your child delivered normally?
 Is your child often sick?
 Does your child have friends?
 Has anyone in your family had reading problems?
 Do you read to your child at home?
You may feel like you’re on trial, so remind yourself that these tests aren’t
designed purely to make you squirm — even if it feels like it. The psychologist
actually uses this information to get a clear picture of factors (like frequent
school absences) that may have contributed to your child’s reading failure.
Fill out the answers, relax, and roll with the punches. You’re getting a reminder
of how your child feels about being tested and how you need to tell him he’s
not on trial, not dumb, and not being graded.
Receiving Test Results and 
Putting Them to Work
By now you have a good idea of the tests and test administrators that are out
there and which, if any, you need. But are you reminding yourself that, most
of all, test results have to work for your child? Knowing that your child is
dyslexic or trusting that the school will take things from there isn’t enough;
you must steer or dictate what happens next. If your child gets extra help in
school, you need to check that it’s working. If your child isn’t making progress,
you need to pinpoint why and try something else.
You also need to follow up to see whether your child still gets the same amount
of help in a few months. Your child may let slip that he doesn’t see Mrs. Brown
(the school resource teacher) three times a week anymore, but only once, so
you need to keep regular tabs on the help your child is supposed to be get-
ting. If your child goes to a tutor instead of receiving in-school help, you still
need to be watchful because you can’t assume that professionals have every-
thing all sewn up.
Dyslexia is an ongoing condition. Your role as supporter and advocate is ongo-
ing too. Your job is to constantly match tasks to your child rather than have
people force tasks on him. Not everything works for your child, so you both
need to get good at mixing and matching. Your child has individual needs,
78
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

and you know them better than anyone else. But you also need to help your
child do more for himself. The older he gets, the more he needs to speak up
for himself and let teachers know exactly what kinds of activities and learning
aids help him perform on an equal footing with other students.
In the following sections, I tell you the terms you often hear in test results
and how to proceed with your child’s education, whether or not he qualifies
for special education.
Breaking down terminology in test results
When the test administrator explains your child’s test results to you, you’re
bound to hear some terminology you may not be familiar with. Here’s a heads-
up about the meaning of some of the common phrases:
 Age: A test age of 7.2 means your child performed like an average child
aged 7 years and 2 months.
 Auditory access: Can your child pull sound-information (like names of
things and parts of words) from his mind? This is auditory access, which
is often measured by asking a child to quickly name pictures. If your child
can’t quickly name common objects, like a toothbrush, vase, and curtain,
his auditory access is weak.
 Auditory memory: Can your child keep bits of sound-information in
his mind for a short time? This is auditory memory, which is often mea-
sured by asking a child to remember a few words over a few minutes.
If your child can’t recall a sequence of numbers, like 5 3 6 1, right
after being told (and asked to remember) them, he has weak auditory
memory.
 Percentile ranking: If your child gets a percentile ranking of 14, it means
that of 100 average children, he’s 14th from the bottom.
 Phonemic skills: This has to do with phonemes, or the smallest chunks of
sound inside words (like c-a-t and sh-ou-t). Your child’s grasp of phonemes
is tested when he’s asked what sounds he hears inside words.
 Phonologic skills: This refers to general sound, letter, and word skills,
such as being able to rhyme and name letters. If your child can distin-
guish different sounds inside words and words that sound alike, he has
good phonologic skills.
 Standardized: A standardized test has been given to hundreds of children,
so the test administrator has a normal bell curve of scores on which to
plot your child’s score. He knows how kids in general perform on this
test and how your child scores relative to the general population that
the test is for.

Chapter 6: Testing Your Child for Dyslexia

Finding out that your child has an LD
If your child’s tests show that he’s performing far below the level you’d
expect of him, he will be diagnosed as having an LD (learning disability)
and will get special education.
You may be told that your child has a “learning disability,” a “specific learn-
ing disability,” or a “specific language disability.” The terms “specific learning
disability” and “specific language disability” are really just ways of saying
your child has dyslexia. There are other learning disabilities, but dyslexia is
the most common.
Other learning disabilities include dysgraphia (difficulty with writing), dyscal-
culia (difficulty with math), and dyspraxia (difficulty with motor skills) but not
(yet) ADHD, which your dyslexic child can have along with dyslexia.
The following sections give you the details on working with an officially rec-
ognized LD child in school and at home.
Seeing LD at work in class
You’re probably wondering what happens when the paperwork is filed away
and your child gets into class as a newly assessed child with an LD. Specifically,
your child’s teachers must accommodate his needs in class and document
exactly how they do it in his Individualized Education Program (IEP), which is
a written and working document specifically about him. You attend IEP meet-
ings to review how well things are working, but you need to keep in touch with
the teacher and resource teacher because the meetings typically happen only
once a year (ridiculous isn’t it!).
The resource teacher is usually the one who’s ultimately responsible for set-
ting up your child’s IEP and seeing that everyone follows through. She gives
your child what you might think of as remedial instruction, usually in her
room with just a few other students.
Watch your child’s reading and writing. If he’s not making progress, meet his
resource teacher and request some practical changes, like having enlarged
print for your child or allowing him extra time to finish assignments. Bring up
your concerns at your IEP meeting — and keep doing that! Flip to Chapter 8
for complete details on the IEP.
The resource teacher is hopefully a nice, approachable person who has many
strategies at her fingertips to help your child. If you’re lucky, she may also be
trained in one of the reading programs that have evolved in recent years to
regulate what resource teachers do. Here are some popular programs designed
especially to move struggling readers forward (see Chapter 7 for details):
80
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

 Lindamood-Bell: Of the several Lindamood-Bell programs, the Lindamood
Intensive Phonological Sequencing, called LIPS for short, is the most
common. In a LIPS program, children become aware of the actions their
mouths make when they say different sounds.
 Orton-Gillingham (O-G): This program is probably the most common
of all. It’s been around a long time, and most other programs describe
themselves as being influenced by O-G.
 Slingerland: In a Slingerland program your child learns the sounds inside
words and does a lot of writing.
 Spalding: Spalding programs are offshoots of O-G with an emphasis on
writing.
Now when a teacher asks you, “Has your child done Orton-Gillingham?” you
know what she’s talking about. These programs are often named after the
people who wrote them (that’s why they have unusual names), and they’re
structured, phonological, and sequential — just right for a struggling child.
Responding to an LD at home
After you know that your child has an LD, don’t think that you’re not qualified
to help him. No matter what terminology you use, the same basic truth holds
your child struggles in class and needs as much love, support, and assurance
as you can give him because he’s having a tough time. Imagine how it must feel
for him to be constantly lagging behind classmates and trying to hold his own.
Imagine the kind of teasing he puts up with. You’re his greatest ally when it
comes to feeling good about himself, so gear up for the ride! You can help
him out with schoolwork too of course, and be every bit as good at helping
him as the professionals (once you know how).
To look deeper into helping your child out emotionally, flip to Chapter 15 and
for help with at-home activities, check out Chapters 11 to 14.
Discovering that your child won’t 
be recognized as having an LD
School districts have a limited amount of money to go around, so not every-
one can get special education. Even when your teachers see that your child
struggles and you’re certain he needs more help, chances are your child won’t
qualify as having LD. About five children in each class (or about 20 percent)
struggle with reading, but only about half of them, at best, qualify as having a
learning disability (and are therefore entitled to special education).
81
Chapter 6: Testing Your Child for Dyslexia

Test results separate children eligible for special education from those who
aren’t eligible, but in reality benchmarks can be different in different places.
Your child can be eligible in one school district and not in another. Also, a
school or private psychologist may tell you that your child has only mild
dyslexia and therefore isn’t eligible for special education.
What can you do when the school tells you that your child’s test results
(whether they’re from the school or an independent tester) don’t qualify
him for special education? You can take the following steps:
 Dispute the test scores and get private testing done
 Consider Section 504
 Get help from school by being friendly
 Get independent tutoring
 Tutor your child yourself
 Home-school your child
The following sections discuss the details of these options.
Disputing the school’s test results
If you disagree with the school’s evaluation and ask for an independent opin-
ion, called an independent educational evaluation (IEE), the school district
must help you get one and may have to pay your costs. To fight your case, find
someone (who talks in down-to-earth terms) to tell you about your rights.
Luckily, I’ve tracked down great help for you so you can save a bundle of
time and energy. Interested? Check out Appendix B for more information.
When you contact someone for help, be selective about what you say and
stay focused. Off-load and grumble to other parents who have been through
the same things as you, but with a professional, be professional. Jot down a
list of things you want answers to and stick to your point. After someone
tells you your rights and how to proceed, you can then find an independent
tester (I talk about independent testers earlier in this chapter). If the inde-
pendent tester confirms the school’s results, you’ll probably want to end
your search. If the independent tester disagrees with the school’s results,
you can take your new information back to the school. Hopefully you reach
a resolution, but if not, you may be looking at legal proceedings or at least
gathering more evidence. In either case, you can find people to help you by
checking out Appendix B at the back of this book. The legal people and orga-
nizations like the International Dyslexia Association (IDA) know about this
kind of thing.
82
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

Considering Section 504
When your child is assessed as having an LD, he receives special education,
and his rights are spelled out in the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act (IDEA). If your child doesn’t qualify as having an LD, another legal safety
net may apply. It’s called Section 504 (of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973), which
is for children who have conditions like ADHD, which don’t count as learning
disabilities.
Section 504 says that schools must make “reasonable accommodations” for
children who have a “functional impairment” that “substantially limits a
major life activity.” Also, Section 504 says that schools must have a Section
504 official. If you want to look into Section 504, ask your school to give you
its parents’ rights manual and set up a time to see the Section 504 official.
“Accommodations” doesn’t mean that your child gets the same help that a
child with a diagnosed LD gets (unless your school is really nice to you!), but
he can get assistance like having test questions read aloud to him rather than
having to read them for himself. I talk about accommodations in Chapters 9
and 10.
Securing help from school by being friendly
When you worry about your child, your whole world seems darker. You can
find yourself being angry all day, sleepless half the night, and not in the best
state to say productive things to teachers. Try to have an “I’m reasonable
and caring” image upfront even when you have dark thoughts whirling
around out back. Try to believe that teachers really do want to help your
child, and if it doesn’t seem that way, it’s probably because your teacher
is overworked or really does think your child will catch up. Whatever the 
reasons, the important thing for you to do is to focus on your child’s practi-
cal needs.
The best way to make things easier for your child in class is to make it easy
for the teacher to help him. Suggest (politely and reasonably) practical things
that will help your child. Thank the teacher for any effort he makes for you
and offer to help in any way you can.
Be calm, helpful, and friendly to your child’s teacher. Let him know that you
aren’t criticizing him and you respect his competency, but you need help in
making things easier for your child. Convey the belief that if you both work as
a team on your child’s behalf, he can succeed in class. I talk about building a
good relationship with the teacher and asking him to make classroom accom-
modations in Chapter 10.
83
Chapter 6: Testing Your Child for Dyslexia

When teachers often see your face in school and know you help out at fairs,
in the cafeteria, during Library Week, and at other school events, your child
registers higher in their consciousness. They’re more likely to talk about him
and think of him when new things are available.
You may find after-hours school clubs to help your child too. Ask about
homework clubs, volunteer tutoring, and social or athletic groups that can
boost your child’s self-esteem. Also try to befriend people who always know
what’s going on in school. Networking and keeping in the loop can make a big
difference to your child. See Chapter 9 for more details on these options.
Finding independent tutoring
If your child is struggling in class, you may decide to have him privately
tutored whether or not he gets extra help in school. When you look for a
tutor or learning center, consider the following:
 The cost of the lessons
 The distance you must travel
 The tutor’s qualifications and experience
 Whether the tutor gives structured, phonological, and sequential
instruction (remember those buzz words?)
 Whether you can sell the idea to your child
Check out Chapter 9 for more about finding and using a tutor.
Tutoring your child yourself
No matter what happens in school or with an outside tutor, you can help
your child at home. Don’t think that because you’re not a dyslexia-trained
teacher you can’t be effective. Of course the term “dyslexia” brings up scary-
sounding things like “multisensory” teaching and “phonological” skills, but
these terms are really just fancy words for stuff that doesn’t need to be difficult.
You can help your child (just as much as a teacher or tutor can) and save
yourself a lot of money and commuting time.
To get the naked, practical strategies that successful teachers (of dyslexics)
use, flip to Chapters 11 to 14.
Home schooling
Home schooling is getting more and more popular and may be an option you
want to know about. If you home-school, you get to monitor your child’s per-
formance closely and adapt lessons to suit his strengths, and you don’t get
the usual homework strife. The drawback is that your child’s social life takes
a massive cut. In Chapter 7, I tell you why parents choose to home-school,
what they teach, and how successful they are. (You can also check out
Homeschooling For Dummies, by Jennifer Kaufeld, published by Wiley.)
84
Part II: Determining When to Get a Diagnosis 

Looking at Your Options When 
You Decide Not to Test
Should you ever do without testing altogether? Most people get tests done
because they want to know exactly what’s wrong and how to move forward.
They want a starting point as a way to gauge progress. Sometimes, though,
you may consider all the factors (the LD label, the likelihood that you won’t
get special education, and your child’s anxiety) and decide to do without
testing (and move straight to tutoring, asking for small accommodations in
class, and helping more at home).
You should skip testing only when your child’s problems seem mild (see
Chapter 3 for a list of general symptoms) and after you’ve had a discussion
with your child’s teacher. Overall, the solution for diagnosing dyslexia is indeed
testing, so if you have any doubts about what to do, have your child tested.
This list gives you reasons why no testing at all may be an option for you:
 You can’t afford it. If this is the case, don’t think that your child will be
disadvantaged. Big, comprehensive tests are good, but so are small,
quick tests. Sure, you get all the bells and whistles with a test battery,
but the bottom line is that you need to know what practical instruction
your child needs. A good teacher can tell this from quick, inexpensive
commercial tests she has in class or from tests she devises herself. This
kind of test, which measures only your child’s skills without comparing
them against other children’s scores, is called a criterion-referenced test.
If you’d like to try one out, flip to Appendix A at the back of this book.
 You have a great relationship with your child’s teacher and know that
she goes the extra mile for your child even though he’s not formally
identified as having an LD. You pretty much know that your child won’t
qualify for special education anyway because you see other kids in class
struggling just as much as your child and have talked it over with teach-
ers and parents who have been in the same boat.
If your child is struggling in school, the teacher sees it and will most
likely do his best to help your child in class, regardless of whether test
results boost your case.
 You know a good tutor and believe that your child will make progress
with her. She’ll give your child a quick, useful assessment so you save
the stress of two to five hours of testing (which will say the same things
but in fancier words!), save money, and sidestep the LD label in school.
 You read this book, checked out the Web sites listed in the back, and
joined your local branch of IDA. You know your child has weak phono-
logic skills, you know he needs a lot of practice with sounding out, and
you’re helping him yourself or getting a tutor. You don’t feel you need to
fork out a few hundred dollars for someone else to tell you what you
already figured out for yourself. Great, what are you waiting for?
85
Chapter 6: Testing Your Child for Dyslexia

In case you think that doing without testing sounds overconfident, I should
tell you that I talk to plenty of parents who manage to identify and treat their
child’s problems by themselves. They network, work with their child each
night, monitor his progress, and see him move into higher reading groups in
class and score better grades! Two parents I know who took the do-it-yourself
approach are now training to be special education teachers.

Exploring Your
Options for Schools
and Programs

In this part . . .
O
f course you want the best school, the best teacher,
and, naturally, the best reading program for your
child. But in the real world, how much choice do you really
get? Does every alternative school cost a fortune? Is the
best reading program (for dyslexics) already being used
in your child’s school? Can an Individualized Education
Program (IEP) really make that much difference to your
child’s chances in school? This part is crammed with the
answers to all these practical questions — and a lot more
besides.

Chapter 7
Choosing the Best School 
for Your Child
In This Chapter
 Considering general traits to help you decide on a school
 Knowing what traditional public schools provide
 Introducing yourself to public school staff members
 Checking out alternative forms of schooling
Your child needs extra help in class, and naturally you want her educated
in a place where she gets a lot of it. You have a few important decisions
to make when it comes to selecting her school.
If your local public school has a great resource teacher who uses a good pro-
gram with your child and sees her every morning for an hour, you’re on to a
great thing! Assuming that you see your child making steady progress and
know that she’s happy, this is the ideal scenario. And it happens for a lot of
children.
But sometimes your child gets hardly any time with the resource teacher, and
neither of you likes her anyway. Then you have to take a look at the big pic-
ture. Maybe your child is generally happy in school, so a good choice for you
is to send her to a private consultant for the special instruction she misses out
on in school. On the other hand, if you’ve heard of a great school especially for
dyslexics, you may want to put up with the initial stress of changing schools
for the long-term benefits.
In this chapter, I give you a list of traits to consider as you decide on a school for
your child. I also describe the features and staff members of traditional public
schools and explain the alternative schooling options that your child has.

Questioning the Kind of School 
Your Child Needs
Your child needs a lot of support to overcome her dyslexia. She needs to mix
with people who understand her and don’t bring her down. Maybe she has
special talents to be nurtured, too. Here are the questions you need to ask
when you make the crucially important decision about which school to send
your child to:
 How many children are in a class?
 What kind of support will my child get with reading?
 Do the teachers seem happy and sensitive to all the children’s needs?
 Does the school use a reading program like Orton-Gillingham (see
“Homing in on school programs,” later in this chapter)
 How much group work do students do?
 How much homework will my child get?
 Can my child use a computer for most of her assignments?
 Does my child’s prospective teacher use a classroom buddy system?
 Does the school have a homework club?
 What extracurricular activities does the school provide?
 Does my child have friends in the local public school?
 How much are parents involved in the school?
 Does the school have a tutoring program?
 Does the school encourage you to help in class and feel free to drop in
anytime?
 Does my local public school have a good resource teacher?
 Does my local public school look well equipped with things such as new
books and computers?
 Do the teachers at the local public school seem happy and friendly to
the children?
 Is the principal at my local public school approachable?
 Does the local public school welcome my visits?
 Is there a local charter school? (A charter school is an alternative public
school. It must follow the same rules as regular schools in some ways,
but in other ways, it follows its own charter, which is drawn up by staff
and parents.)
90
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

 Are other schools within easy traveling distance for me?
 Do I have special requirements, like wanting a Catholic education for my
child or advanced instruction in violin?
 Can I afford private school?
 Can I afford to send my child to a private tutor or consultant (to aug-
ment her public education)?
After you prioritize your questions, you and your child need to visit the local
public school in the hope that at least many of the things you want are offered
there. Phone the school to arrange a time for your visit. Keep your child in the
loop so she can be mentally prepared (and have her coolest outfit ready!).
When you get there, go through your questions, try to see classes in session
and visit the places that will be important to your child socially, like the lock-
ers and cafeteria. Through this mix of academic and social information, you
should get a feel of what the school is like and can do for your dyslexic child.
The question of whether your child gets special education and an Individualized
Education Program (IEP), which I discuss in Chapter 8, applies only to public
schools. Private schools aren’t bound by the same laws as public schools and
make their own decisions about providing for dyslexic children. Most parents
stick with a public school, so that’s what I focus largely on in this chapter.
91
Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child
Decisions, decisions: Do you have 
a choice of public schools?
Your house sits within a designated school dis-
trict. Within that district, one elementary school
is closer to you than the rest, so it’s your “home”
school. If your house is equidistant between
two schools, your school district decides which
school is your home school. Your child must go
there unless
 The school doesn’t have room for her (in
which case she is wait-listed).
 You can show, or the school acknowledges
right off the bat, that your child’s special
needs can’t be met at that school.
If you show that your child needs to go to a school
with special facilities for her (that your local
home school can’t give), your school district must
cover the costs. You must persuade the district
superintendent though, so you need a clear
case and any supportive documents (like test
results) you can get. The district prefers that
your child attend her home school of course, so
it will aim to accommodate her needs there. You
have to be on the ball when the teachers tell you
(informally if your child doesn’t have an IEP, or
formally during an IEP meeting if she does) what
kind of help your child will get so you can ask
for changes or additions and monitor how the
talk pans out in practice. (In Chapter 10 I talk
more about the kinds of help or accommoda-
tions your child can get in class.) And from the
outset you should be prepared to go to school
often, if need be, to push your child’s case.

Looking at What a Traditional 
Public School Offers
Your local public school has to account for the way it spends its money and
show that it makes appropriate provisions for children with disabilities. In real
terms, this means that as long as you can show that your child needs it, she
gets a few kinds of extra help. In the following sections, I lead you through the
assessments, special instruction, and other services to watch out for and, if
they’re missing, inquire about.
Supplying assessment services
One good thing about your local public school is that it gives your child free
dyslexia assessment. You file a written request with the school district and get
an answer within a set time (usually 30 days). An educational psychologist
runs your child through a battery of tests, and if she’s found to have dyslexia
(or a learning disability), she gets special education. See Chapter 6 for full
details on testing.
You’ll probably hear about your child’s “learning disability” or “specific learning
disability” rather than her “dyslexia.” Dyslexia is one specific kind of learning
disability, but teachers don’t often use the word (because they don’t feel
qualified to do so). Your school psychologist may not use it either, simply
because his mandate is to deal with “learning disabilities.”
Your child may have dyslexia but still not qualify for special education. She
may be struggling, but not enough (about 2 years behind) to qualify for spe-
cial education. If you just depend on the public school for special education
in this instance, you don’t get it until your child’s problems worsen to the
required low level of performance.
Homing in on school programs
If you’re brand-new to special education and reading programs, boy have I
got some alphabet soup for you! At some point during your child’s education,
you’re going to hear weird terms like “Orton-Gillingham” and “Lindamood-Bell.”
These are names of popular reading programs. I run through them here so
that when a teacher tells you your child gets Lindamood-Bell, you can nod
sagely and ask, “Do you prefer it to Orton-Gillingham?”
Ready? In this section I describe 17 programs, any one of which your child
is likely to come into contact with in a public school. A couple of them are
straightforward and inexpensive enough that you might like to try them out

at home. (I feature a few of these reading programs, along with other dyslexia
treatments, in even more detail in Chapter 20.)
Most of the following programs are used predominantly in public schools,
but they may also be featured in private schools and learning centers. For
more about sending your child to a tutor or a learning center, check out
Chapter 9.
 Orton-Gillingham (O-G): Developed by Samuel Orton and Anna Gillingham
in the 1930s, this is the granddaddy of multisensory, phonics and research-
based programs. In real English that means that it engages a few of your
child’s senses while she learns phonics rules and patterns, and it’s backed
by plenty of research. Everyone knows about it, it’s the most popular
program of the bunch, and several other programs are offshoots of it.
Plenty of teachers and tutors are trained in O-G techniques, so you can
find programs in schools and centers, and you can train in it yourself too
if you want. For info, visit www.ortonacademy.org or call 845-373-8919.
 Lindamood-Bell: This is a bunch of programs designed by Ms. Lindamood
and Ms. Bell. The most widely used is Lindamood Intensive Phonological
Sequencing — LIPS for short —for the clever reason that the program
makes children become aware of the actions their mouths make when
they say different sounds. Programs are short and intense. Your child
gets one-on-one help through four to six weeks, four hours a day (yep,
you heard right!). You usually go to a Lindamood-Bell center or a trained
tutor and pay, or your school resource teacher may give your child a
milder variation of the same thing. For info, visit www.lblp.com or call
800-233-1819.
 Project Read: Project Read is most often used in schools, not centers.
There are five curriculum strands (phonology, linguistics, written
expression, and two kinds of reading comprehension), so it can be
used in regular and special classes and with all ages. For info, visit
www.projectread.com or call 800-450-0343.
 Slingerland: This program is designed for classrooms and there are
summer programs too. Children learn the phonetic sounds and do a lot
of writing. For info, visit www.slingerland.org or call 425-453-1190.
 Spalding: This is an adaptation of Orton-Gillingham with an emphasis on
writing. This program is used in schools and learning centers in several
countries, and an online parent course will soon be available. For info,
visit www.spalding.org or call 602-866-7801.
 Corrective Reading: SRA (now joined with McGraw-Hill) has been produc-
ing learning kits or programs for decades. The one you hear most about
in schools and learning centers is Corrective Reading. In a Corrective
Reading program, the teacher reads out instructions from a manual
(word for word) to a small group of students, and all the students read
and fills in their workbooks as instructed, all at the same time. This pro-
gram is also called SRA, Distar, and Direct Instruction (DI). For info, visit
www.sraonline.com or call 888-772-4543.

Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child

 Reading Recovery: This program, which originated in New Zealand but
has spread to schools and learning centers across the globe, is for children
in grade 1 and is an intensive blast of daily instruction for 12 to 20 weeks.
It’s not a program that’s up there with the favorites for teaching dyslexics
because it doesn’t tag itself as phonics-based or multisensory, but it gives
children individual instruction and a lot of reading at their level and
gets good results with most participants. For info, visit www.reading
recovery.com or call 614-310-7323.
 LANGUAGE!: This is a popular program for middle and high school stu-
dents in part because it incorporates all 18 reading and language arts
curriculum strands. It’s also used in some learning centers. For info and
materials, visit www.language-usa.net or call 800-547-6747, ext. 266.
 Wilson: The hallmark of this program is that teachers show students
how to tap out sounds in words to help them remember them. Originally
it was for older students, grade 5 and above, but now it has materials
for younger kids too. You find the Wilson program in schools and some-
times being used by therapists and learning centers. For info, visit www.
wilsonlanguage.com or call 800-782-3766.
 Lexia Herman Method (also called Herman Method): In this program,
students complete 21 levels of instruction, each with a spelling and
handwriting component. Instruction is multisensory and phonics based
(as pretty much all reading programs for dyslexics are) with an emphasis
on comprehension. The Herman Method is used in schools by teachers
who take workshops to learn it but may be used by those teachers out-
side of school too. For more information, go to www.hermanmethod.com.
 Read Naturally: This program is specifically for improving your child’s
reading fluency and is used by schools and by some therapists and
learning centers. Your child does repeat readings of short pieces of text.
She reads the text out loud while listening to it on a tape recording and
times her reading speed for each separate reading. She reads progressively
faster at each reading and gets more confident. For the bigger picture on
Read Naturally, go to www.readnaturally.com.
 Success for All (SFA): This is a school-based reading program for 
disadvantaged or at-risk children in grades pre-K to 6. Schools that
use the program get support (like on-site coaching) from the Success
forAll Foundation, which is funded by donations. The foundation also
produces other programs, like Curiosity Corner and Kinder Corner for
little children and the Reading Edge for adolescents. Check it out at
www.successforall.net.
 Early Intervention in Reading: This is a program with a difference. It’s
for use in schools only and is an easy and relatively inexpensive way to
give regular classroom teachers training in providing struggling readers
with the explicit phonics instruction and guided reading that they need.
Teachers get Internet training and learn how to give struggling children
94
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

20 minutes of daily instruction, in a small group (up to 7 students) within
the class. For more information, visit www.earlyinterventionin
reading.com.
 Davis Learning Strategies: Ron Davis, dyslexic and author of The Gift of
Dyslexia, has built a small dyslexia-busting empire! You can take your
child to a Davis center for assessment and tutoring (which I go into in
Chapter 20), and now teachers can attend Davis workshops and buy
Davis boxes (full of materials for small group instruction) to use in
class with struggling readers. Check it out at www.davislearn.com.
The programs that I list next are smaller, less popular programs than the ones
I just described, but they’re still great and used by plenty of resource and spe-
cial education teachers. You don’t get the training courses and substantive
research that come hand-in-hand with the bigger names, but you can buy
what you need quickly and easily, whoever you are. The publisher for all the
next programs is Educators Publishing Service (EPS books; www.epsbooks.
com), whose Web site you may enjoy browsing because it has masses of great
stuff on offer. Since the programs I list next are readily available to parents, I
give you prices and a quick summary of what you get for your money.
 Alphabetic Phonics: An offshoot of the O-G program, this multisensory
curriculum teaches elementary and high school children to mark sounds
with symbols. You get a teaching manual ($11), workbooks ($12.55 each),
and a lot of other materials if you want them. For info and materials visit
www.epsbooks.com (click on Dyslexia Materials) or call 800-225-5750.
 Recipe for Reading: This program, for children in grades K to 6, is com-
prised of a teacher’s manual, workbooks, storybooks, and other bits
and pieces too. The whole package is straightforward and attractive.
The manual currently sells for $20.75, and the workbooks are around $10
each. For info, visit www.epsbooks.com (click on “dyslexia materials”)
or call 800-225-5750.
 Explode The Code: Here’s a program that consists mostly of simple
sequential workbooks. Each workbook costs about $7, which makes
this program one of the least expensive around.
Just because a program has a good track record doesn’t mean that your child
will succeed in it. Different children like different methods, so don’t think you’ve
come to a dead end if your child hates a program everyone else raves about.
Try another one. Look for a teacher or tutor who has experience with strug-
gling kids. Even if she doesn’t talk about Orton-Gillingham or Lindamood-Bell,
she may still do great phonetic and multisensory activities with your child
(see Chapters 12 and 14 for more about these types of activities). Watch how
your child fares. You don’t need a PhD in reading programs to see whether
she’s getting the hang of sounding out, enjoying the tutoring, and becoming
a better reader.

Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child

Giving help above and 
beyond the classroom
Public schools can do great things for your dyslexic child outside of class.
When enthusiastic teachers and parents come up with ideas and give their
time, all kinds of things, like homework clubs and tutoring clubs, can happen.
Here are some of the clubs and activities you may want to ask about in a
school:
 Buddy system: Your child can be a younger child’s buddy or get taken
under an older child’s wing herself. Either way, this is great stuff! Schools
that put kids to work being friends and helpers for other kids are great
places to be.
 Homework club: If your school runs a homework club, it could be worth
your while to check it out. Older kids often help out in homework clubs,
and if that’s the case in your school, you may be able to commandeer a
kind, interested one to take special care of your child!
 Special responsibilities: Good teachers know that giving a child special
responsibilities, like being lunch monitor or litter patroller, works won-
ders for her self-confidence. If your child isn’t already doing a special
job, put in a good word for her.
 Specialty one-off programs: Sometimes a school offers a short, one-time
program to help kids with things like assertiveness. Keep your ear to the
ground so your child doesn’t miss out. If you can’t volunteer in school,
get friendly with another parent who’s always there so you get to hear
what’s going on.
 Sports and arts: I know that these things are pretty obvious, but I feel
that I have to give it a quick mention anyway. Encourage your child in
any nonacademic activities she enjoys. She needs many ways to feel
happy and successful because happy children are better equipped to
weather the knocks that dyslexia can bring.
 Tutoring for your child: Most schools ask parents to volunteer to listen
to kids read. Often they set up programs in which a parent regularly works
with a child once or twice a week. Listen up for this kind of program
because after a volunteer parent knows how to help your child, great
reading progress can come from this special one-on-one coaching.
 Your child tutoring other children: On the surface, asking a dyslexic child
to tutor another child may seem ridiculous, but it works. As long as the
teacher finds something your child can cope with, like marking spellings
from an answer sheet, your child can feel useful and important (and who
doesn’t need that!) and brush up on her own skills in the process.
96
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Providing sensitivity to your child’s needs
A couple of years ago I asked my child’s teacher if my child could do a slightly
different weekly spelling list than the other kids. I gave my (really great) rea-
sons and offered to provide the list and come to class each week to help
mark it if that would help. The teacher said, “If I let one child do it differently,
they’d all want to.” She also spent a lot of time yelling at the kids and telling
them they were the worst she’d ever taught, but that’s a whole other story!
This teacher was inflexible, which is exactly what you don’t want. It shouldn’t
happen of course, especially if your child has been officially deemed dyslexic
(or learning disabled), but it does. I could start a lengthy tirade about the
awful things I’ve seen happen to dyslexic kids, but instead — because it’s more
productive — I tell you about the great things I’ve seen teachers (who take the
trouble to put themselves in your child’s shoes) do. In schools and classrooms
that are sensitive to a child’s extra needs, you see these kinds of things:
 Small group activities: Your dyslexic child probably enjoys small group
activities because she can talk tasks through with her group and con-
tribute to it in ways that emphasize her strengths and sidestep her
weaknesses (for example, drawing posters or taking photos instead
of writing). In a small group, your child also feels more secure. Fewer
eyes are upon her than when she has to ask or answer questions in the
whole class.
 Partners working together: As long as both partners get along, part-
nerships are a perfect fit inside your dyslexic child’s comfort zone.
An understanding partner may allow your child to dictate words for
her to write, assume responsibility for tasks that take the least writing,
and develop a friendship in the process.
 Creative projects: Here’s where your dyslexic child gets to shine. She
shows her artistic, dramatic, and technological skills and gets better at
thinking of ways to apply these skills to other classroom projects, too.
 A designated classmate that each student can call on when she needs
help: At one time or another, all children forget what they’re supposed
to be doing for homework and need to call a friend. You can pretty much
expect your dyslexic child to stress about homework often, so a friend
on the end of the line (phone or Internet) is a must. Help your child keep
and use a reliable contact list.
 Use of computers and tape recorders: Older dyslexic children can save
themselves a lot of trouble by becoming computer savvy and knowing
how to use a tape recorder. It’s worth trying to keep abreast of technol-
ogy or even just keep pace with your child’s technological know-how if
you can manage it. If not, maybe a friend can help you out.
97
Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child

 Word lists posted on walls: After you show your child how to sound out
the parts of words that sound out easily, and highlight other parts, tape
those words to a bathroom or other much-viewed wall. If you have a whole
list of spellings, try to put them into word families too (like round, sound,
and pound).
 Classroom help from parents: When parents help in class, the teacher
gets more time with students. Your dyslexic child benefits, along with
everyone else.
 Scheduled time with the teacher for every child: One-on-one teaching
is the most effective teaching your dyslexic child can get. Scheduled,
personal time with the teacher is a definite plus.
 Respectful tone of voice in use by everyone, including the teacher:
Your dyslexic child has enough to deal with without having to listen to a
teacher yell at students or other students yelling at each other (or being
rude in other ways). A respectful classroom in which the teacher has
kind but firm control is the ideal.
 Full recess time for everyone (detentions aren’t common): Your dyslexic
child needs her school recess time. In a great classroom, the teacher deals
with issues like noncompletion of assignments in ways that don’t deprive
children of their wind-down (and eating) time.

Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 
A responsible position
Recently my child’s teacher told me he planned
to give my child special responsibilities. “She’ll
rise to the occasion,” he said, “It sounds terrific,”
I said. A few days later, my child came home from
school with this to say:
“Guess what, mom? I’m now officially a very
important person. Mr. Peterson gave me a truly
responsible job. I’m shoe tidier, and if one single
shoe is out of line, I have full permission to go
right in there and fix it. If I do a great job, maybe
I’ll be promoted to hats?”
My daughter, evidently being tongue-in-cheek,
was really telling me she’d seen right through
our plot, but even so, I could tell she was a
teensy bit proud to be shoe tidier. She held her
elevated position for several weeks, and those
shoes hardly knew what had hit them.
A few weeks later I went through much the
same thing with my older daughter. She was
invited to join the after-school art club but pro-
nounced that it was really the after-school dork
club (and she’s dorky enough as it is without
drawing attention to it!). I listened to her com-
plain, and poke fun, but sure enough, she joined
the art club and had new experiences to grumble
(in a typical teen way) about. Any reasonable
responsibilities that you give your dyslexic child
can make her feel more confident. Even if she
grumbles about a job, it still gives her a feeling
of independence and being relied upon. And
your dyslexic child, more than other children,
needs to strengthen her people skills and work
ethics so they can outshine the weak spots in
her literacy skills.

Meeting the Staff in a Traditional 
Public School
When I walk into my kids’ school, it hits me right away — this really is a nice
place (and I think I’m a pretty good judge by now because I’ve worked in sev-
eral schools and sent my kids to several more)! The secretary is nice to me,
kids walk past and say “Hi,” and I don’t see a line of miscreants waiting out-
side the principal’s office. When the principal herself appears, lo, she smiles
at me and sometimes stops to chat!
In the following sections, I introduce you to the main folks at any given public
school. If you get a good feeling after meeting with all of them, you can feel
more comfortable about putting your dyslexic child’s education in their hands.
Familiarizing yourself with 
the classroom teacher
Please, oh Lord, let me have a good teacher. If your child has ever had a really
bad school year, you know (and yards of research substantiates it) that the
teacher is the single most important factor in your child’s success in class. In
the following sections, I explain the qualities of a good teacher for a dyslexic
child and show you how to improve your chances of getting your child happily
paired with one. (For complete details on working productively with teachers,
see Chapter 10.)
Sizing up qualities in a good teacher
A good teacher for your dyslexic child sets up her classroom in the ways I talk
about earlier in the chapter: She fits small group activities into her programs,
matches up buddies, encourages creativity, and maintains a warm but disci-
plined atmosphere in her classroom. She has some special skills too because
your child has a few special needs. She is
 Approachable: Your child can always go to her after class and ask for
extra guidance.
 Flexible: If one strategy doesn’t work for your child, she’s happy to try
another.
 Aware: She understands that when your child can’t do things in the same
way as other kids, it doesn’t mean she can’t do them at all. Your child
shouldn’t be allowed to skip tasks; instead, she needs to try out different
strategies until she finds her fit.
99
Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child

Requesting a specific teacher for your child
Teachers get together at the start (or end) of the school year to decide which
child goes with which teacher. The principal oversees the process, but the
teacher your child just left probably wields most power. It sounds mercenary
to cultivate a friendship with your child’s teacher so you can get preferential
treatment, but of course, that’s exactly how the real world works. Dyslexia
can be taxing enough (for your entire family) without finding out that your
child gets the super-uninspiring, yell-rather-than-talk, teacher from hell.
It hardly seems fair that you don’t get to choose your child’s teacher does it?
Since that’s the case, however, let me outline some things you can do to raise
the odds of your getting a good teacher.
 Fill out the optional information sheet that you get at the end of the
school year, the one that helps teachers place your child next year.
You’re not allowed to say honest things like “I don’t want bad-tempered,
boring Mrs. Kent,” but you can say things like “My child responds best
to quiet, gentle discipline” and hope for the best. If you fill the form out,
at least you have a chance that your voice will be heard.
 Be friendly with your child’s current teacher so you can brazenly ask her
(if you dare) to allocate your child to a specific teacher the following year.
I was once at a school where parents were quietly and dutifully filling out
their information forms when a parent marched straight into the class-
room and said, “Judy, Connor hates Mrs. Raynor, so you have to put him
with Mr. Clark.” And yes, the next year Connor was in Mr. Clark’s class!
 If your child gets special education, talk to her resource teacher. Tell her
which classroom teacher you’d like for your child so she can add her
comments to the selection process. (See the following section for more
about resource teachers.)
 Talk to the teacher you’d like your child to have. Maybe she will remem-
ber you and ask if she can add your child to her list (as long as no one
else has other plans).
 When the new school year begins, if you don’t like your child’s teacher,
go to the principal right away. If you present a good case, the principal
may put your child into another class, but if you wait longer than about
three weeks, she’s likely to tell you it’s too late.
Both parents should see the principal, but make sure that you present a
united front. Be calm, clear, and tactful. Specify what’s going wrong in
concrete terms, but avoid personally criticizing the teacher (“Shelby is
unhappy” rather than “Mrs. Smith is awful”). Be firm and persistent.
100
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

 If your child hates going to school and you don’t know whether to com-
plain or sit a bad year out, remember that your child can fall seriously
behind in the early years. Write down all the incidents and comments
your child tells you about, and date each one. Take this record with you
to the principal and ask, on the basis of your child’s stress or academic
failure, for a change of class. Take someone (preferably someone who’s
good at negotiating) with you if you need to.
No luck? Ask to see the counselor and/or the district superintendent.
Again, keep documenting what you’re concerned about (for example, low
grades, punishments, or snide comments). If you feel that the school,
not just the class, is causing your child to fail or be miserable, and your
record of events shows it, you may even (after a lot of fighting) get your
district to agree to move her to another school within the district. If all
else fails and you’re prepared to take extreme measures, move to another
house so you can send your child to a school you’ve researched and
love the look of.
If it sounds like I’m scaremongering by telling you to march boldly into school
with your issues, it’s because I hear from a lot of parents whose children are
struggling in class. They’re not sure whether their problems are big enough
to warrant serious complaint. They’re not sure whether they should keep
quiet because the school on the whole is nice, their child has friends, and so
on. Here’s what I think is the deciding factor. Your child’s reading problems
don’t get better by themselves; without intervention, they get worse. If your
child doesn’t get good intervention or she gets great help with the resource
teacher but she’s so unhappy in her classroom that she can’t learn, speak up.
Now. Trust your own judgment and don’t wait for someone to give you the
okay. And if your child is seriously unhappy (she cries most days, has bad
dreams, or has started wetting the bed), you’re not overreacting by wanting
to change a class or even school. In fact, you should be making it a priority.
Acquainting yourself with 
the resource teacher
A typical public school has a resource teacher who’s responsible for keeping
your child’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) running smoothly and
productively. Typically, your child goes to the resource room a few times
each week to get small group instruction with the resource teacher. It’s up to
your school, though, to decide exactly what your child gets, and that’s influ-
enced by budget and staffing. (See Chapter 8 for complete IEP details.)
101
Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child

Resource teachers do great work, but just like in any other job, you get good
and not-so-good ones (and even with a great resource teacher, she and your
child may not click). If your resource teacher runs a special dyslexia treatment
program, like the Orton-Gillingham program, you’re likely to be pleased with
what you see. (I cover Orton-Gillingham and other dyslexia treatment pro-
grams in the section “Homing in on school programs,” earlier in this chapter.)
Does a good program always equal good results, though? No. The teacher
factor is still crucial. Your child learns much more from a teacher she likes
than from one she doesn’t like, so ideally you want a good teacher (see the
section “Sizing up qualities in a good teacher,” earlier in this chapter) who
uses a good program.
Ah, but maybe even that isn’t strictly true. Plenty of great resource teachers
use their own eclectic mix of strategies rather than a commercial program.
They (as well as the program users) understand how important phonetic
understanding is for your child, and they’re great at livening up the work, too.
Teachers are under a lot of pressure to train in new programs, but you still
can’t beat experience, empathy, and an open, lively mind. You should be able
to spot these qualities simply by talking to a resource teacher and checking
out her classroom. (See the section “Providing sensitivity to your child’s
needs,” earlier in this chapter.)
Resource teachers and special education teachers deliver special education
to children who are entitled to it. If your school has both kinds of teachers,
the resource teacher usually works with more moderately disabled chil-
dren, and she may teach gifted children too. She is often trained in reading
programs, like Orton-Gillingham, while the special education teacher has
training in things like how to include wheelchair-bound children into
normal school life.
Checking out school specialists
Your child is assessed for dyslexia, or a learning disability (LD), by a 
district-employed psychologist and may meet a few other specialists too.
The psychologist works full time for the school district or is contracted
to do assessments. He is qualified to diagnose your child and is the only
person who can administer some of the tests that your child takes as part
of the whole battery of tests for LD. You can get the specifics on assessment
in Chapter 6. If your child needs other services that aren’t provided by regu-
lar school staff, like speech or physical therapy, and these needs are part of
her IEP, the school district provides them, too. Your child will visit a special-
ist, or the specialist will come to school to visit her. Treatment continues for
as long as the IEP team says it should. I tell you all the ins and outs of IEPs in
Chapter 8.
102
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Paying special attention to the support staff
Here’s a thought: You probably have almost as much contact with the school
secretary as you do with your child’s teacher. You speak to the secretary any
time you make an appointment to see the school psychologist, speech thera-
pist, or other specialist or when your child forgets her lunch, stays home sick,
or has an outside appointment. If you’re nice to the secretary, your life runs
smoother.
Sounds easy, doesn’t it? I’m a (fairly) honest person, however, so I feel com-
pelled to warn you that you may encounter an officious school secretary or
two. Of course, I speak only from my own encounters, but well, some of them
haven’t been pretty. I’ve groveled shamelessly to many a secretary for things
as trivial as use of the school phone (and only for the briefest of local calls too).
All I can say is that when you deal with the school secretary, you’re in the
midst of real power, so tread warily!
Oh, don’t forget to grovel to the janitor, too. He can let your child in the class-
room after hours when no one else can, and you can bet your life you’re
going to need that some time when your child swears someone took her
homework (due tomorrow) from her bag and put it right back in her desk.
Taking note of the principal
In a small elementary school, you may have a lot of contact with the princi-
pal. Especially if he has an interest in children with special needs, he may talk
to you about your initial concerns and attend subsequent IEP meeting that
you go to, but he doesn’t have to, though. Often you deal almost exclusively
with teachers, and in fact you may hope for that because meetings with the
principal may mean you have a problem that you haven’t been able to resolve
at the lower ranks.
Meeting the principal and getting on friendly terms with him is easy when your
child is in a small elementary school. When your child goes to a big middle or
high school, however, it’s much harder. The principal is harder to track down
and has all the responsibility of being at the helm of a big organization. Even if
you schedule a meeting with him, he may not remember you a few weeks later.
Realistically, you can count on not having much to do with the principal of a
big school unless you have serious complaints. Even then, the principal is
near the end of the line of people you need to contact (the classroom teacher,
resource teacher, and guidance officer come earlier in the line). Jot down some
contact details about him (and also about the district superintendent) and
file them away safely, just in case.
103
Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child

Getting the Scoop on Alternative
Schooling
If you think that your child won’t get all the help she needs in your local public
school or you have other reasons for wanting to keep your child out of the
public system, you have a few options. You can choose from schools that
operate by their own unique set of beliefs, schools that meet your religious
needs, and schools that cater specifically to dyslexics. In the following sec-
tions, I give you a quick tour of the whole caboodle.
You can claim tax deductions for your child’s specialized tutoring and school-
ing as long as you can show that a doctor recommended it. Your expenses are
treated as medical, and the basic rule is that you can deduct only amounts
that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income. For the fine details,
read IRS Publication 502 (Medical and Dental Expenses), downloadable from
www.irs.gov/publications/p502/ (click on Forms and Publications and
then on Download Forms and Publications by: Publication Number).
Finding out about charter schools
A charter school is a free public school with more self-regulation than a 
regular public school. It is state funded but writes its own charter that must
comply with some district guidelines but leaves teachers and parents free to
choose methods and curriculums. Forty-one states have charter schools, and
if you have one in your school district, you’re eligible to enroll your child.
What are charter schools like? Unique. Because each one develops its own
charter, I can’t give you shared key features. Here though are a few things
you may find:
 A child-centered, less formal curriculum
 A cooperative setup in which parents must volunteer in class or in other
ways that help the school, for a set number of hours each semester
 Innovative new teaching methods
 Community involvement

Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Feeling the pull of magnet schools
Another type of public school you may want to consider is a magnet school.
Magnet schools originally started out as a way to help schools desegregate.
They offered attractive options to black students (so they’d be drawn as if by
a magnet), and that, without the racial part, is still what they aim to do today.
What kind of options do you have with magnet schools? Each magnet school
has a special focus, like preparing students for musical, scientific, or military
careers. If your dyslexic child has her heart set on a particular career path,
you can see what every magnet school in the country offers and requires from
prospective students by logging on to the Magnet Schools of America Web
site at www.magnet.edu.
If you choose a magnet school, you’ll probably want to include private tutor-
ing in your plans because magnet schools don’t usually offer specialized
treatment for dyslexia. See Chapter 9 for more details about tutoring.
Choosing a private school
If you choose to send your child to a private school, check out the same
kinds of things that you’d look for in a public school (see the section
“Questioning the Kind of School Your Child Needs,” earlier in this chapter,
for a list of considerations).
Technically, Montessori schools, Waldorf schools, and schools for dyslexics
(which I cover in the following sections) are considered private, but when I
talk about “private schools” in general, I’m discussing a wider range of schools
that fit special requirements you may have. Private schools, in this context,
include religious schools and single-gender schools (all boys or all girls).
Just like in any school, you find good and not-so-good teachers, so take extra
care to sit in on a class and talk at length to your child’s prospective teacher.
Is she easy to talk to, and does she seem flexible and accommodating?
Private schools aren’t governed by the same laws as public schools and don’t
have to provide special education to your dyslexic child. You have to ask a
private school what kind of help it will give your child. You also need to under-
stand that whatever help your child does or doesn’t get, you can’t rave about
your rights under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which
I cover in Chapter 8. (Actually, you can rant and rave if you like, but it won’t
get you very far.)
If you don’t want your child to attend a private school full time or you can’t
afford it, ask about summer school. Many schools offer summer classes, and
they’re usually popular (so enroll early!).

Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child

Examining Montessori schools
Montessori schools began in the early 1900s with Maria Montessori, an
Italian physician and educator. Now you can find Montessori schools all over
the world — and not just for little kids. Key features of Montessori include
the following:
 Classes have 20 to 30 students and two or three teachers.
 Students in the classes are mixed ages and start at age 2.
 The alphabet and sounds are introduced at age 2 with materials like
letter blocks and sandpaper cutouts.
 All children get to do a lot of hands-on activities. Children help them-
selves to specially designed materials from low shelves.
 Teachers watch your child and give her new materials when she looks
ready.
 Teachers introduce your child to specific stimuli (like dance and music)
when she’s thought to be at the most receptive age for them.
 Your child learns as an individual and starts doing group work only in
high school.
 Classes are quiet, clean, and orderly, with an emphasis on self-care and
responsibility.
Will your dyslexic child thrive in a Montessori school? Maybe. Montessori
schools introduce your child to phonetics at an early age (before difficulties
set in) and use multisensory and noncompetitive strategies, and that’s all
great. The downside is that your child may not master reading early on, and
then she may need specialized tutoring (even though you’re already paying
big dollars for Montessori!).
If you like the look of a Montessori school near you, do your homework.
What exactly can the school do for your child to help her with her special
needs? For the fine details on Montessori, check out these three Web sites:
www.montessori.com, www.montessori.org, and www.montessori.edu.
Walking the Waldorf (or Steiner) path
Back in 1919, Dr. Rudolph Steiner, an Austrian, started a school that was funded
by a Mr. Waldorf. Now there are more than 600 independent, private Waldorf
(sometimes called Steiner) schools in over 32 countries. Waldorf schools aim
to educate the whole child, “head, heart, and hands,” without competitive
106
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

grading and with protection from the harmful influences of broader society.
Waldorf schools have these key features:
 Letters are only introduced in grade 2, and children learn to read from
their own writing.
 In grades 1 to 8, your child keeps the same “main lesson” teacher.
 In the younger grades, all subjects are introduced through artistic 
mediums.
 All children learn to play the recorder and to knit.
 All children learn a stringed instrument from grade 3 on.
 Children don’t use textbooks until the fifth grade. All children have main
lesson books, which are workbooks that they fill in during the course of
the year.
 At the elementary level, teachers don’t grade children but write a detailed
evaluation at the end of each school year.
 The use of electronic media, particularly television, by young children is
discouraged.
So is Waldorf right for your dyslexic child? Hmm, maybe not. Your child gets
plenty of loving care at a Waldorf school but is taught to read late in her
school career. Also, while teachers can give her extra help, they may not have
the time or expertise to give as much of it (or the right kind) as she needs.
If you like the sound of Waldorf, you need to carefully check what happens
if your child struggles with reading and writing. For all the ins and outs of
Waldorf, check out the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America at
www.awsna.org and also www.waldorfanswers.org.
Deciding on a school for dyslexics
Many private schools cater specifically to children with dyslexia. Some of them
are boarding schools. They all have Web sites and brochures that you can
browse through after you recover from the shock of how much you pay! The big
advantage of these schools is that your child is surrounded by students just like
her and all the teachers are focused on teaching her in a dyslexic-friendly way.
The factors that may put you off are financial and geographic. You have to pay
for these schools, and you may have to travel a long way to take your child
there each day (unless your child boards, which has its own drawbacks). In
addition, even before you get into those issues, you have research to do. Every
school is different, so you have to get a feel for each one individually. For a list
of K to 12 schools and links to their Web sites, go to www.ldresources.org.

Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child

Thinking about home schooling
Home schooling may be an option you don’t want to dismiss out of hand. These
days, you can find many places to turn for help with planning curriculums.
In addition, home schooling may be cheaper for you than private schooling
or tutoring. Here are a few things to ponder:
 Home schooling your dyslexic child can work out cheaper than sending
her to private school and you don’t have to travel long distances.
 Plenty of home-schooling curriculums, online courses, and support groups
are available all over the place. Parents of dyslexic children often say that
being able to pick and choose from curriculums is the biggest benefit of
home schooling. They can find materials that suit their child instead of
trying to push their child through the one-size-fits-all public system.
 Children who are home-schooled generally do well in tests against pub-
licly schooled children.
 Home schooling allows you to respond to your dyslexic child’s academic
needs but also to protect her emotional health (if she was teased or felt
depressed at school).
 You can always send your dyslexic child back into the public system.
Must a home-schooling parent have vast reserves of patience and calm? Not
necessarily. Home-schooling parents say that as long as you’re reasonably
level headed and can get along with your child without too many showdowns,
you may be pleasantly surprised by how stress-free home schooling becomes
once you know the ropes. And of course you can make your own discoveries
about flexible, fun lessons and teaching your child phonics through multisen-
sory techniques.
If you’re considering home-schooling your dyslexic child, plenty of Web
sites and books are available to check out. In fact, all that research can get
overwhelming, so here are just three Web sites that, for my money, get the
“informative but simple” award:
 At www.geocities.com/Athens/8259/special.html, you get a list
of links. It sounds boring, but it’s not, because the list is easy to read and
each site is briefly described.
 At www.homeschool.com, you get straightforward general information
that includes a page about phonics home-teaching packages.
 Ever thought about part-time home schooling? The Illinois Department
of Education has a Web site that explains how it works. The rules are 
different in each state, but at this site, www.illinoisloop.org/
homeschool.html, you at least get the drift.
108
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Almost every state has home schooling networks. Just type “homeschool net-
work” and the name of your state into your Internet search engine. In addition,
check out a home-schooling magazine at www.homeedmag.com.
After you decide to take the home-schooling plunge, you need materials. In the
next sections, I give you suggestions for sets of readers (reading and writing),
workbooks, and other bits and pieces that are super-handy things to have
alongside your abacus and cane. Homeschooling For Dummies by Jennifer
Kaufeld (Wiley) is also a great resource.
If your child goes to regular school (and you’re home-schooling only part time),
check that she doesn’t already use these books in class so you don’t double up.
Reading textbooks
With so many kids’ reading books to choose from, what kinds of texts should
your dyslexic child be using? For all-by-herself reading, your child needs attrac-
tive books with well-spaced text spread comfortably throughout the pages.
Most words should sound-out regularly, and it’s helpful if new and tricky words,
like enough and who, are given in a separate list your child can look at before
she launches off. And so that your child can read several books before having
to search anew, you may want to focus most of your book search on series. In
the next list, I describe book series that you can be sure satisfy all or most of
the good-reading-books-for-dyslexics characteristics I just outlined.
 The Alphabet Series: This is two volumes (1 and 2) of storybooks.
You get color short stories and, at the back of each book, questions to
ask your child and sight words she should learn (so flip to these first).
Published by Educators Publishing Service, the books are available at
www.epsbooks.com (click on Decodable & Leveled Readers). The cost
per set of 13 books is $59.95.
 Bob Books: These are small books in a box with 12 books per box. Boxes
come in Levels A, B, and C with more than one box per level. Bob Books
are great for all kids because they are phonetically leveled and the illustra-
tions are cartoon characters of indiscriminate age. They’re published by
Scholastic and available at all good bookstores at a cost per box of $16.95.
 Dr. Seuss: The easiest books in this classic series are Hop on Pop, Cat in
the Hat, and Green Eggs and Ham. Check out the word families in the back
of Hop on Pop. Published by Random House, the books are available at
most good bookstores for $8.99 each.
 Primary Phonics: In this series, you get five sets of readers with ten books
per set. The text is phonetically controlled, and the illustrations appeal to a
broad readership. You can buy separate workbooks too. They’re published
by Educators Publishing Service and available at www.epsbooks.com
(click on Phonics/Decoding). The cost per set of ten books is $20.95.
109
Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child

 Reading Rainbow Readers: Each book in this series is comprised of short
stories with a theme (like “Silly Stories” and “Pet Stories”). The brief,
phonetically controlled text has story lines. The books are published
by SeaStar Books and available at all good bookstores for $3.99 apiece.
 Real Kids Readers: This series has three levels (1, 2, and 3). The text is
phonetically controlled, and because of the real-life photos, the books
appeal to a wide age range. They’re published by Millbrook Press and
available at all good bookstores for $4.99 each.
Workbooks
Having a few workbooks that your child can write in is a handy starting point
for home schooling. But a lot of workbooks that look nice on the outside and
purport to be straight forward turn out to be confusing for your child to follow.
You need books with simple instructions and a sequential progression of
phonics activities. Here are the ones I like:
 Building Spelling Skills: This series includes a set of six workbooks,
available for grades 1 to 6. Simple, repetitive lessons each focus on a 
different bunch of words. You can obtain these books, published by
Evan-Moor, at www.evan-moor.com (click on Language Arts). Each
book costs $16.99.
 Explode the Code: This series includes 17 books so far. The first three
(preschool) books are Get Ready for the Code (Book A), Get Set for the
Code (Book B), and Go for the Code (Book C). Next are books 1 to 8 with
some half numbers (such as 11⁄2) in case Johnny needs more practice.
Published by Educators Publishing Service and written by Nancy Hall
and Rena Price, the books are available at www.epsbooks.com (click on
Phonics/Decoding) or by calling 800-225-5750. The teachers guide books
cost $7.95, and the workbooks each cost between $6.25 and $7.
 Reading Freedom (Activity Books 1 and 2): Published in Australia, these
books are easy to order online. Use them after Johnny knows the letter
sounds and some sight words. They have a grown-up appearance that
older kids like. Published by Pascal Press of Australia and authored by
Hunter Calder, the books are available at www.pascalpress.com.au.
Activity books cost $16.95 (AU) each, and the teacher resource book is
$39.95 (AU).
 Reading Reflex: This book tells you how to teach your child phono-
graphix, or, in other words, that letters are sound-pictures. You get
instructions for making letter cards and having your child slide them
together to make words, word games, and short stories to read. Published
by Free Press and written by Carmen and Geoffrey McGuinness, the
book is available in all good bookstores and online bookstores for $16.
110
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

 Recipe for Reading: This program, for children in grades K to 6, is com-
prised of a teacher’s manual, workbooks, storybooks and other bits and
pieces. The publisher is Educators Publishing Service, and the authors
are Nina Traub, Frances Bloom, et al. You can obtain the books by visiting
www.epsbooks.com (click on Dyslexia Materials) or calling 800-225-5750.
The manual currently sells for $20.75, and the workbooks are around
$10 each.
 See Johnny Read!: Here’s a book I have a certain fondness for! It’s for
parents of boys who struggle with reading. You get real-life stories and a
SPRint program to use (sight words, phonics, and reading). You’re asked
to give your child 20 to 40 minutes of daily reading and to do a one-hour
lesson with her once or twice each week. Published by McGraw-Hill and
written by yours truly, Tracey Wood, the book is available in all good
bookstores and online bookstores for $12.95.
 Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons: This long-standing, well-
regarded book takes you step by easy step through teaching your child
the basics. It’s good for very beginners. Published by Fireside and writ-
ten by Siegfried Engelmann, et al., this workbook is available in all good
bookstores and online bookstores for $20.
 Toe by Toe: This is a workbook/manual in one. You get one book of exer-
cises and progress charts and are told to tutor your child for 20 minutes
a day. Your child progresses to the next lesson only after passing a mas-
tery test. Published by Keda Publications (United Kingdom) and written
by Keda and Harry Cowling, the books are available at www.toe-by-toe.
co.uk. The cost is $45.27.
Extra materials
Some teaching tools and extra bits and pieces are especially handy for teach-
ing letter sounds and spellings to dyslexic children. In the following list I give
you the inexpensive, portable items that I always like to have among my own
teaching paraphernalia.
 Lowercase letter cards: For a set of inexpensive letter cards or letter
blocks, check out the resources at Creative Teaching Press. You may
want to browse because there’s a smorgasbord of attractive products
here. Buy these products at a school supplies store or online at www.
creativeteaching.com (click on Parents, then Products, and then
Letters). Each set costs about $5.
 Book-sized whiteboards: Kids like writing on a whiteboard. Buy two,
and you can write words and play word games together. You can find
them at any school supplies store for about $7.
111
Chapter 7: Choosing the Best School for Your Child

 Flashcards: Flashcards can help your child practice phonics rules and
patterns she already learned. These three packs, by Frank Schaffer, each
have 100 clearly printed word cards that you can group into families.
And the cards come in sturdy little boxes that you can pack in your car
or bag. You can buy them from school supply stores or online at http://

Chapter 8
Investigating the Individualized
Education Program
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basics of an IEP
 Readying yourself for an IEP meeting
 Scoping out special services under an IEP
 Knowing the legalities of IEPs
O
h my gosh, the Individualized Education Program (IEP) can be intimidat-
ing. An IEP is a detailed written plan of exactly how special education is
to be delivered to your dyslexic child. In this chapter, I walk you through all the
important points: the basics of an IEP meeting and document, how to guaran-
tee a successful IEP meeting, the services your child receives with an IEP, and
the legal issues pertaining to IEPs.
All public schools are legally obliged to provide disabled children — including
dyslexics, because dyslexia is a learning disability — with special education
and an IEP. Private schools do not have to provide special education or an IEP.
Each private school makes its own decisions about providing (or not providing)
for students with disabilities.
Probing into the Basics of an IEP
An IEP keeps everyone honest and on their toes! It’s a binding, written account
of who does what, when, and how in the delivery of your child’s special edu-
cation. It specifies names, times, and dates so individuals are accountable for
carrying out specific actions by specific times. The following sections give you
basics of an IEP meeting and the actual IEP document.

The nuts and bolts of an IEP meeting
The IEP is written in school, in an IEP meeting, by a team you’re on! The IEP
meeting must take place within 30 days after your child is found, from the time
of assessment (see Chapter 6), to be eligible for special education (and there-
fore an IEP). The school must give you ample notice of the meeting time and
place and do its best to schedule it when you can be there. It’s best, of course,
if both parents can attend the meeting, but if that isn’t possible for you, send
in your place a friend or a family member who’s well versed in your child’s
history and education, or an advocate.
If you can possibly avoid it, don’t skip an IEP meeting. You don’t get that many
meetings, so each one is important. At each meeting you have a chance to talk
to all involved parties together in one place and make sure that your voice is
heard and documented.
The school must tell you who will be on the IEP team and give you any docu-
ments you ask for (like your child’s school records, the school’s blank IEP form,
or notes the team members are presenting). People typically on the team are
you, the classroom teacher, the resource teacher, a school district person
who can allocate money, and a district person who translates things into
plain talk for you (such as how Section 504 affects you — see the section
“Recognizing how Section 504 and ADA fit in,” later in this chapter).
You’re allowed to take someone with you to the IEP meeting to morally sup-
port you and help you keep on track. You can also take a professional or other
knowledgeable person with you. Good professionals to take to meetings are
people who call themselves advocates. See the section “Knowing your rights —
and your child’s,” later in this chapter, for details.
Your child also is allowed to be at the IEP meeting. He benefits by this because
he gets practice in speaking up for himself and being clear about his own goals.
Do some role-playing ahead of time to prepare him. Have him practice explain-
ing which school activities in particular cause him strife and what kinds of
ideas he has, if any, for making things easier.
Children younger than about 7 years old may not benefit that much from
attending an IEP meeting because it’s hard for them to define their problems
and ideas. Besides, a grown-up meeting can be boring even for grown-ups!
You may simply want to talk to your younger child at home and take his
ideas to the meeting. If your child is older than 7, you may still want to 
represent him rather than have him attend the meeting. This decision is
based on how much benefit you think there is to be had from having your
child attend.
114
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

If your child comes to the IEP meeting, let the school know in advance. If he’s
there, the conversation will change because teachers may not want to say
things like “Tim bullies other kids” or “Tim talks aggressively.” Team mem-
bers need to phrase their concerns in sensitive, constructive ways, and your
child needs to be assertive but open to suggestion. You may want to include
your child in just the second part of the meeting so you get adult-only time
(and the chance to talk about Tim’s heavy handedness). Usually the coordi-
nator of the meeting sets the stage for your child’s inclusion.
You will spend a few hours at your child’s first IEP meeting, but after that, you
get IEP meetings only annually (unless you ask for more frequent reviews).
Your child gets reassessed for eligibility every three years, and if he’s made
great progress, he may no longer qualify for special education. If he still quali-
fies for special education, his IEP and IEP meetings continue.
For more details about IEP meetings, see the section “Ensuring a Successful
IEP Meeting,” later in this chapter.
The fine print of an IEP document
The IEP is essentially a document of who does what, when, and how. It holds
individuals responsible for actions within a time frame. The IEP must describe
your child’s present performance, unique needs, and the specific and practical
ways in which the school will meet those needs. An IEP document includes
the following information:
 Baseline: The IEP starts with an appraisal of your child’s current educa-
tion level so that you have a baseline from which to chart his progress.
Members of the IEP team share test and observational information about
your child so that everyone’s clear about his here-and-now strengths and
limitations.
 Goals: The IEP team then outlines short- and long-terms goals for your
child and benchmarks to watch for. Goals are stated in specific, measurable
terms so you don’t end up with vague goals like “Johnny will improve his
reading speed.” Instead you see “Johnny will work on Fast ForWord with
Mrs. Jones every morning for 20 minutes. He will take the weekly test
every Friday morning and the ABC test on November 30.”
 Ongoing evaluation: The IEP tells you how the school will keep you
informed of your child’s progress. You can expect regular updates
(by e-mail, mail, phone, or whatever you agree upon) and can ask for a
meeting at any time if your child doesn’t seem to be moving forward.
115
Chapter 8: Investigating the Individualized Education Program

 Accommodations: The IEP explains the special education services and
accommodations provided to address each of your child’s goals/needs.
It also explains the date that the services will begin, their frequency,
and their location. At any time you can ask for changes to the type and
amount of special education your child receives (like time with the
resource teacher), the type and amount of other services he receives
(like speech therapy), and the type and number of goals that are set for
him (like recognizing 100 sight words).
 Transitioning: Transitioning is when your child moves from elementary
to middle school or from middle to high school, and his IEP must pre-
pare him for it. About halfway through the year preceding transition
(sometimes even earlier), your child is shown what to expect in his
new school and gets plenty of dry runs. When he approaches the end of
high school, he gets help with choosing a job or college and grooming
himself in preparation. (Chapter 17 has additional info on applying to
college.)
116
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 
Considering the cons of an IEP
The pros of an IEP are self-evident to a lot of
people, especially those who would love to get
special education for their own child but don’t
qualify, but some folks believe that there are dis-
advantages. These parents worry about the IEP
for the following reasons:
 A stigma is sometimes attached to being a
special education kid.
 The IEP meetings can be harrowing.
 Books and other materials that mainstream
students receive may not be allocated to
special education students, so they miss
out on updated and challenging materials.
 The resource teacher may have a general
special education degree but may not be
trained in specific reading techniques.
I’m not going to whitewash over these concerns
because they’re entirely valid, and the stigma
issue can be particularly worrying for older 
students. Kids who get special education do get
called “dumb” by other kids and must prepare for
that and learn to deal with it. Hopefully your child
gets used to “wearing” his learning disability in
elementary school and can deal with it in later
years. If he can’t bear to be a special education
kid, try to find a compromise (like reducing, but
not eliminating, his hours away from regular
class) before you think of withdrawing him from
special education. Few parents want to give
away this help.
You’ll at times feel worn out by pushing your
child’s case or having to listen to hours of
edubabble as part of the IEP meeting. You’ll tire of
justifying your every request and having to listen
like a hawk to every detail so you’re sure you’re
ending up with the best deal. But, and this is a
considerable but, having extra help in school
and learning to overcome the drawbacks is
better than going without extra help at all.

Ensuring a Successful IEP Meeting
Many parents take whole courses about effectively representing their child
in IEP meetings. They read up on advocacy (at the Web sites of organiza-
tions listed in Appendix B) and contact the Council of Parent Attorneys and
Advocates (www.copaa.org) to sign up for workshops.
That being the case, you certainly want to be prepared for an IEP meeting. In
the following sections, I give you the info you need at that foundational level.
Preparing yourself
Before I tell you about preparing for the IEP meeting, I have an analogy for you
to visualize. Ready? I’m not the kind of cook you can rely on. At times I cook
great things, but often something’s missing, like onion in the curry, butter in
the mashed potato, or meringue on top of the meringue pie. Do you have that
picture?
Now here’s my point. When it comes to something as serious as your child’s
IEP meeting, don’t rush the preparation. Preparation is everything; preparation
is key; preparation is crucial. Why? Because if you don’t have the essential
ingredients of a successful IEP meeting — knowing what you’re entitled to
and the right spiel to use — you may end up getting a poor deal for your
child. The following sections explain the preparatory steps that can help
ensure a successful IEP meeting.
Speaking with the teacher
Before the IEP meeting, you’ll want to have a conversation with your child’s
teacher and ask the following questions:
 Who will attend the meeting and what will be discussed?
 How is my child coping in each of his subjects?
 How good is my child at concentrating, completing tasks, following
instructions, and organizing his work?
You’ll also want to tell the teacher the kinds of things you want to bring up at
the IEP meeting so you (hopefully) form a little alliance with her.
Don’t bypass your child’s teacher unless you really can’t work things out with
her. She can be your best resource. If you get her on your side, you may get
the same kind of help, just by asking, as you would get after weeks of cutting
through red tape. See Chapter 10 for additional info on working with teachers.

Chapter 8: Investigating the Individualized Education Program

Making lists and organizing documents
Making lists and gathering relevant paperwork before the IEP meeting are
important; everyone needs to be prepared to talk about the same issues. You
shouldn’t lose or forget important topics amid the talk and general activity.
As soon as you know you’re going to an IEP meeting, start making a list of
things you want to discuss, including the following:
 A list of specific things you want to tell and ask the IEP team: You can
include such things as how well your child is doing on a new reading
program or that he doesn’t seem to be benefiting from a program at all.
 Your child’s strengths and weaknesses: You may want to mention your
child’s out-of-school behavior or strengths if they impact what he does in
class and his own view of his strengths and weaknesses. This information
is especially useful if your child is the type who’s always obliging and
seemingly happy in school but complains about schoolwork the minute
he steps through the door at home.
 What you expect your child to learn this year, especially in reading
and writing: Be as specific as you can. For example, you can pinpoint
his reading speed, comprehension, or instant recognition of sight words.
 What you envision your child doing when he leaves school: If you
envision your child going to college, his teachers need to know before
he makes high school subject choices. Colleges prefer some subjects
over others; for example, they may ask that all students study a foreign
language (and pass the exam on it).
 Strategies that you know have helped your child: These can include
things such as phonics and strategies for remembering sight words.
In addition to making a list of questions, call the school before the IEP meet-
ing and ask whether a draft of the school’s proposed IEP is available. If it is,
ask for a copy and find out whether you can give, in advance, your reactions
and a list of the issues you want to raise.
If this IEP meeting determines your child’s eligibility or reassessment, tell
the school that you want assessment results in hand before the meeting.
You’ll be better prepared for the meeting and get no surprises. Ask a pro-
fessional or knowledgeable friend to help you interpret the assessments if
needed.
Finally, photocopy documents (like test results from a private tutor) that you
want everyone to see. Put them in a folder and take it with you to the meeting.
No matter what you ask for or discuss at any point during the IEP process,
take notes from your conversations and date them. Keep a notebook for
phone calls, save all e-mails, and put every document into your folder.
118
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Surrounding yourself with supportive folks
Plan for both parents or guardians to be at the IEP meeting. Ask a supportive,
knowledgeable friend to go with you, and let the school know in advance
whom you’re bringing.
Have an experienced advocate go with you (see the section “Knowing your
rights — and your child’s,” later in this chapter for details) and any profes-
sional, such as your child’s previous teacher, whose input can lend support
to your requests. Again, let the school know whom you’re bringing. If a pro-
fessional can’t make the meeting, she can give you a written report to take
with you instead.
Many parents develop good relationships with the people on their IEP team,
go to meetings on their own, and encounter no confrontation, surprises, or
disappointment. But if you’re concerned about what the outcomes might be, or
feel the school professionals aren’t meeting your child’s needs or your requests
are being ignored, don’t go on your own to an IEP meeting. You’ll feel better with
someone you know and trust at your side. If that someone listens carefully
and makes notes, it may make quite an impression on the rest of the team.
You have a witness and notes to refer to if you need to contest an issue later
on, and with those notes in hand, you can later mull things over more slowly.
Another way to keep a careful note of what happens in the IEP meeting is to
tape-record it. Ask in advance whether you can do this.
Making the meeting work for you
If you think people aren’t listening to you, if you feel crowded in by the pro-
fessionals, or if you find it hard to follow what’s being said, the IEP meeting
can be stressful. To help you go in there with a can-do attitude and come out
with the feeling of having achieved something, I provide some pointers in the
following sections.
Asking for straightforward language
The team identifies your child’s current level of performance (or how he did
on his last IEP) by examining his test results and samples of his work. Be sure
you understand the measures. Don’t be too shy to ask teachers to put their
technical jargon into down-to-earth terms. And tell the team about relevant
observations you’ve made (“Part of the reason for Tim’s low score on Rollicking
Reading is that the text is boring”).
Teachers and specialists who know each other and talk the same jargon can
be intimidating. Keep in mind, though, that your knowledge of your child’s
needs is greater than theirs, and you have every right to make sure that your
child’s needs are met. If team members use terms that you don’t understand,
ask them to explain. Be firm and persuasive but not confrontational.
119
Chapter 8: Investigating the Individualized Education Program

Stating a preference for specific goals and clarifying your concerns
The team sets short- and long-terms goals that must be measurable. A teacher
can’t just say something like “I will make Tim a better reader.” She must spec-
ify and quantify: “Tim will read at level A on the Z test by December 1 and at
level C at the end of the year.”
If you don’t like the goals that team members propose, say so. Say what you’d
prefer. You can ask that behavioral goals (like helping him sit still for longer)
be included if you think they’ll have an impact on his learning.
You are an equal member of the team, so go to the meeting and chip in. Make
sure that practical, measurable annual goals, and subgoals toward them, are
written down. You must propose or agree with the goals.
If you don’t agree on something, ask other team members to give explicit,
concrete reasons for their statements and state your concerns clearly and
reasonably. Phrase your comments in terms of your child (such as “Tim fails
on this program”) and avoid personal criticism of teachers (such as “You always
make him . . .” or “You never listen to . . .”). If the meeting is making you feel
frustrated or angry and you need time to cool down, ask for a recess. If you
think you need more time to review what’s been said, request that the meet-
ing be continued at another time.
Don’t be put off by answers like “We don’t have the resources” or “He’ll grow
out of it in time.” Be persistent, because your child is one of many, and that’s
the only way to push his case to the fore. Keep your goals in mind and remem-
ber that your child needs your support. He can’t get help without you, and
every extra day he waits is a day when he falls farther behind.
Don’t sign the IEP if you don’t agree with it. You must be 100 percent happy
with everything written in the IEP, and if you’re not, don’t sign it. If the team
says you must sign just to verify that you were there, write something like
“I do not agree with. . . .” The school has to address your objections because it
can’t implement the parts of the IEP you disagree with.
Because the IEP is a legally binding document, it’s your safety net. Later, if
you think your child isn’t progressing, you can say that X goal isn’t being
achieved so you’d like a review meeting. You can ask for review meetings
throughout the year.
Surveying the Services That Your 
Child Receives with an IEP
The resource teacher at school will probably have the most to do with imple-
menting what’s written in the IEP, and she most likely is specially trained.
Your child sees her to get the special education he is entitled to.
120
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

With the resource teacher, your child gets tailor-made extra help. Examples of
this help include working with a special reading program like Orton-Gillingham
(see Chapter 7 for more about this program and others) and reading books
with limited vocabulary. It may not seem like enough, but it’s way more than
non-IEP kids get!
Your child usually goes to the resource room — a quiet, supportive place —
to work with the resource teacher. The resource room is often equipped with
computers and materials that your child gets easy access to. Your child can
read lower-level books in the resource room, and other kids won’t tease him.
Because the resource teacher sees fewer kids than mainstream classroom
teachers do, you can contact her more easily, and she has a good knowledge
of your child. She can ask other teachers to make allowances for your child,
such as giving him a buddy who reads especially hard text out loud to him,
and allowing him extra time to finish assignments.
Teachers who are experienced with working with children with special needs
have special ways of presenting new information to the class, too. They talk
in short, clear terms and change from one topic to another by saying transi-
tional sentences like “Now I’m going to talk about ch words. After that, you’ll
write some of your own ch words.” They write key words on the board along-
side lengthier text. They establish helpful routines, like having sheets that
summarize topics, and make diagrams available for kids to take home.
Looking at the Legal Nitty-Gritty of IEPs
If the title of this section has your eyelids drooping and your mind lazily float-
ing off to sweeter places, wake up! I promise not to overwhelm you or bore
you to distraction here, so hang around. In the next sections, I give you the
bottom line about your rights and what you should do if you find yourself in
a rift with your child’s school. And face it, that’s handy stuff to know.
Examining the acts governing IEPs
When your child qualifies for special education (because he was assessed
and found to have dyslexia or a learning disability — see Chapter 6 for details
on the assessment process), he must have an IEP. This requirement is laid
down in the law, so there are no ifs, buts, or maybes about it. The following
sections cover the all-important acts pertaining to IEPs.
You probably won’t delve deeply into laws affecting children with disabilities
unless you get into a confrontation at school. Then you can skim through this
chapter and call one of the organizations listed in Appendix B (especially your
local Parent Training and Information Center and Disability Law Center) that
121
Chapter 8: Investigating the Individualized Education Program

can tell you everything you need to know and put you in touch with someone
called an advocate. Advocates are wonderfully helpful people who guide you
through the grievance process and support you at meetings. I talk more about
them in the section “Knowing your rights — and your child’s,” later in this
chapter.
Getting the IDEA
The main law that governs the whole special education process and how
assessments and IEPs must run is the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act, which everyone simply calls the IDEA. The original IDEA was passed
in the 1990s, but it was updated in December 2004 in the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Improvement Act. Its current form regulates pretty
much everything having to do with special education, including how states
receive federal funding for providing for disabled children in school and pre-
cisely what an IEP should include.
The way that each school district enacts the IDEA is different. That’s because
each state has its own laws, and each district interprets federal and state law
its own way, usually in response to how local courts have dealt with individ-
ual cases. Keep in touch with the big organizations (like the International
Dyslexia Association) because its employees take a daily look at court cases
and amendments to the law.
At Wrightslaw (www.wrightslaw.com), you can find a rundown of IDEA 2004
and, if you need more detailed info, a whole book about it (for $14.95).
Recognizing how Section 504 and ADA fit in
If your child qualifies for special education, he also is automatically eligible
for protection under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990.
 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act: This civil rights law protects
people with disabilities who are in federally funded programs or ser-
vices (which, of course, includes public schools). It requires schools to
provide a “free and appropriate education” (known as FAPE) to your
child and specifies the due process you can go through if you have a
serious complaint about your child’s IEP.
 ADA: This civil rights law protects people who have a “physical or
mental impairment that substantially limits one or more life activities.”
It applies to workplaces more than schools but can be useful in adding
force to your case. ADA can be handy for parents of children in private
school; it applies to nonsectarian (but not religious) private schools.
122
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Advocates and attorneys can explain how these laws relate to your specific
case. To get free advice, contact your Parent Training and Information Center
or any of the big organizations like the International Dyslexia Association (IDA)
and the Learning Disabilities Association (LDA) listed in Appendix B.
If you’re told in an official assessment that your child doesn’t have dyslexia
that’s serious enough to qualify him for special education services but has
mild dyslexia or dyslexic tendencies, he may still be eligible for support
(like having test questions read to him or getting extra time on tests) under
Section 504 and under the ADA. A paper trail strengthens your case. After
you gather evidence of your child’s needs and your requests for help, you
may get it under Section 504 and ADA. Start the ball rolling by requesting a
meeting with your teacher and principal.
Knowing your rights — and your child’s
Things that sound great on paper don’t always come out that way in practice.
In real life, your child’s teacher has a lot of things on her plate and a lot of
other children to take care of. Your school’s budget is stretched. The staff at
your child’s school may not be specially trained to help your child. Even if all
parties are doing their best, you can feel shortchanged by what the IEP trans-
lates into in practice. When that happens, you should get the help of a trained
advocate or consider getting training yourself. If you do, you can talk the legal
talk, and you have a much better chance of getting what you want.
Advocates have had guidance from special education attorneys and may have
been through the IEP process themselves with their own children. They have
attended many IEP meetings and workshops (though currently there is no
special certification) and know the kinds of things you should ask for, what
kinds of issues can become sticking points, and the terminology and approach
that you should use to receive the best results. Their fees can run up to $100
an hour (some work for free). You can get all the details at the Council of
Parent Attorneys and Advocates Web Site (www.copaa.org).
So you know the kinds of things that an advocate can help you with, the fol-
lowing sections cover some of the legal hoopla to steel yourself for.

Children with Disabilities at www.nichcy.org and click on A-Z Topics and

123
Chapter 8: Investigating the Individualized Education Program

Receiving a free, appropriate, and inclusive education
Your child is entitled to a “free and appropriate public education,” often
shortened to FAPE. You’re not legally entitled to ask for the “best” education
for your child. If you complain that your child isn’t getting the “best,” your
school can use the language you use against you. In court, the school can
simply say, “This parent is wholly unreasonable. She wants the best!”
If you ask for X, Y, or Z reading program for your child, the school isn’t legally
obliged to give it to you; it only has to give you an “appropriate” program. If
you’re incensed that you can’t specifically ask for, say, Orton-Gillingham for
your child, weigh your options. You can call the school to task for not provid-
ing your child with instruction backed by research if you think that’s really
the case. Or you can save time and energy and focus on getting other goals
instead, like more one-on-one time with the resource teacher.
Your school district won’t pay for private services unless it acknowledges
that it can’t provide them itself. If you decide to pay for private services your-
self, inform the school in writing. Date your letter and explain that you think
your child isn’t getting a FAPE at school. Later, if you get good results from
the private services and poor results from the school, you may have a great
case for claiming reimbursement.
Your child also has the right to be educated in the “least restrictive environ-
ment” for him. Least restrictive is really another way of saying inclusive; your
child must be included in regular classes as much as possible (but he still
wants some time with the resource teacher).
Obtaining records and requesting reviews
You’re entitled to see and get copies of all school records. You also have the
right to get an IEP meeting every year, and you can ask for review meetings
in between. You must get progress reports at least as often as you would get
regular school reports.
The specific act that lays down your access to records rights is the Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act, or FERPA. You can find out all about it
at www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html.
Deserving due process
You have the right to a due process hearing, meaning that if you want to 
contest something or ask for extra, you get to have your case heard by an
independent hearing officer. This is like going to trial. You make your case
against the school, which in turn makes its own case.
Before you get to the due process hearing, you may also be offered media-
tion, a lower level of the dispute process in which a mediator listens to the
case and tries to resolve it before it escalates into a due process hearing.

Chapter 9
Securing Help without an
Individualized Education Program
In This Chapter
 Tapping into school resources
 Choosing private tutors, learning centers, and more
 Helping your child at home
A
n Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a written working plan of
exactly how special education is delivered to an eligible child. The hard
truth about IEPs is that not every child gets one. More importantly, not every
child who seems to be in need of one gets one. In this chapter, I tell you which
direction to go when it’s your child who goes without. I cover resources in and
out of school and methods that you can use to support your child at home.
If your child doesn’t qualify for an IEP, she may still be eligible for extra help
under Section 504. In this chapter I talk about getting help without an IEP
or Section 504, but if you flip to Chapter 8, you can revisit the main points
about both.
Making the Most of Choices in School
If your child struggles in school and you think or know she has dyslexia, even
though she doesn’t qualify for special education (and an IEP), you have options.
You can ease her progress through school in a few ways, including the in-school
choices I list here:
 Be nice to your child’s teacher and keep in contact with him. Without
badgering him, thank him for any extra help he gives your child, and
when your child could use a bit more, tell him. The teacher can do small
things that make a big difference to your child’s happiness and success.

 When your child can’t do her homework or classroom assignments, 
pinpoint where the problem lies. Think of practical ways to help and
propose them (respectfully) to the teacher. He will be more amenable
to your practical suggestions than to your vague complaints.
 Regular parent-teacher conferences come around only two or three
times a year. Don’t be afraid to ask for more. As long as you have useful
information to share with the teacher or legitimate concerns, you can
both benefit by touching base a few times each semester.
 Keep your eyes and ears open for special extracurricular programs in
school. Let the teacher know that you want your child to be considered
for homework clubs, tutoring programs (often manned by parent volun-
teers), and social or sporting clubs that can help her feel confident.
You can read more about extracurricular school programs in Chapter 7. In
Chapter 10 I give you the nitty-gritty on working with your child’s teacher.
Looking for Help Outside School
You’ve likely used private services for your dyslexic child or at least consid-
ered using them. You may have had your child’s hearing and vision tested,
you may have paid for an assessment (see Chapter 6 for assessment details),
and maybe you’ve tried a tutor — or two dozen. Getting outside help can take
a weight off your shoulders, put the spark back in your child’s eye and give
your child’s teacher something to smile about. It can also make a sizeable
hole in your wallet and leave you feeling despondent.
In the next sections, I outline the kinds of private help you can get so you
have an idea of what’s what before you shop around.
By the way, be prepared to shop around because dyslexia isn’t a condition
for which one size fits all. You need to match your child to a specialist that
she clicks with, a program that makes sense to her, and a schedule she can
follow without getting overwhelmed. And you need a Plan B in case, even
after all your careful planning, your choices don’t work out.
Scoping out specialized dyslexia therapies
Some dyslexia programs address what they see as the underlying cause of
dyslexia rather than the symptomatic reading and writing problems. Such
programs include the following:
126
Part III: Exploring Your Options for School and Programs 

 All Kinds of Minds: Your child is shown how to use her best learning
style (because being pushed into using her weakest learning modalities
is the real problem).
 Fast ForWord: Your child learns better listening and quick response skills
(because these attention and response difficulties are the real concern).
 Processing and Cognitive Enhancement (PACE): This program runs your
child through brain exercises (because her problem is underdeveloped
specific brain skills).
You can flip to Chapter 20 to read more about these and other specialized
dyslexia therapies, but upfront you may want to know the price range you
can expect and the broad pros and cons:
 Prices for assessment and treatment in a specialized therapy center 
typically run in the hundreds or thousands of dollars.
 The good thing about these programs is that they’re usually short (lasting
a few weeks) and intensive (a few hours each week), so you get to see
your child improve relatively soon.
 The weakness of these programs is that you can expect your child to
need, in addition to them, at least some specialized reading and writing
instruction.
Considering dyslexia clinics
A local dyslexia clinic can be an attractive option for augmenting your child’s
education in school. So you can get a general idea of how they operate, this
section summarizes what happens at the Dyslexia Institutes of America, whose
ten branches are spread across Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
and Indiana.
Dyslexia Institutes of America clinics provide a multisensory phonics-based
reading program. The program also treats related problems, like poor working
memory, phonemic awareness, visual perception, and visual motor integration.
Your child begins the program by having a screening test to establish
whether she has dyslexia (for $85) followed by a battery of diagnostic tests
(lasting two hours at a cost of $400) to pinpoint her areas of weakness.
Results of the evaluation determine what goes into your child’s personalized
treatment plan.
127
Chapter 9: Securing Help without an Individualized Education Program

Your child receives two-hour weekly sessions with certified teachers, costing
$100 per session (this fee may be reduced if you pay by the month in advance).
The reading component is taught one on one. Sessions are followed up with
home exercises that parents are trained to do. Parents receive weekly reports
on their child’s progress and another assessment every six months.
The clinic director attends one parent/teacher meeting at your child’s school
so that teachers are kept in the loop.
You can find out more at www.dyslexiainstitutes.com or by calling the
home office at 217-235-0045.
Dyslexia Institutes of America also provides treatment to adults with dyslexia.
Another option is 32º Masonic Learning Center. I really should put a Wow! icon
here because here’s something way cool (if that’s still the term for really, really
good)! Your child can get tutoring in Orton-Gillingham, one on one, twice a
week, for free (see Chapter 7 for more about this method), and you can train
in it for free too, if you have a 32º Masonic Learning Center near you. If you
live in Massachusetts, you lucked out because that’s the hub of these cen-
ters. If you don’t live there, visit www.childrenslearningcenters.org
and click on About the Children’s Learning Centers and then on Locations
(or phone toll free 877-861-0528 or 781-862-8518) to see whether these centers
have come to your state.
You can use a search engine like Google or Yahoo! to find a local clinic too.
Just type “dyslexia clinic” or “dyslexia institute” along with the name of your
state, and see what pops up!
Paying an individual tutor
In an ideal world, your child’s much-adored teacher recommends a tutor
who’s sensitive, fun, and qualified to the hilt to teach her the latest dyslexia-
busting methods. Your child visits the tutor for a few idyllic sessions and
emerges a fluent and error-free reader and writer. That’s the ideal world.
In the real world, you may have a hard time finding a tutor, let alone someone
who’s experienced with dyslexia. And even if you do find a tutor who looks
good on paper, you can’t be sure your child will click with her.
So is it worth searching for a tutor? To help you answer that question, here
are the potential benefits that tutoring can have for your child:
128
Part III: Exploring Your Options for School and Programs 

 Tutoring gives your child more personal attention than she can possibly
receive in class (as one of 20 or 30 kids).
 Tutoring can provide your child with challenges to keep her excited
about learning and extra support to strengthen her weak areas.
 Tutoring takes the pressure off parents. Even if you have a perfect rela-
tionship with your child, you probably (like most parents) have trouble
helping her (especially in her teen years) with homework.
 Tutoring can help your child feel privileged.
Are there disadvantages? The term “disadvantages” is probably a bit harsh,
but here are a few things to at least watch out for:
 Your child may describe her tutoring as “good,” which is adequate
enough explanation to her but not much help to you. You may want to
schedule meetings with her classroom teacher so you can see whether
the tutoring is in fact making any difference in class. See Chapter 10 for
more details about having a conference with your child’s teacher.
 Naturally you want good value from tutoring, but you need to be clear
about what counts as good value. Improved grades in class are obvious
indications of success, but your child’s improved confidence and better
attitude in school count, too.
 Tutoring that isn’t enjoyable may do more harm than good, especially to
little children. You want your elementary school child to develop a posi-
tive attitude toward school (after all, she’s going to be there a long time),
so if you have to drag her to tutoring, look for another tutor. The same
thing applies to older children, of course, but they’re a bit better at letting
you know how they’re feeling (and putting up a fight!).
 Paying for tutoring and getting your child there each week can be hard
enough as it is. You don’t want to end up paying cancellation fees, too.
Check out a tutor’s cancellation policy before you start marking your
child’s tutoring sessions on the calendar.
I can’t take you to a bunch of tutors and point out the ones who might be right
for your child, but I can tell you what to look for and where to start your search.
You need a tutor who
 Is nice! You may think that it’s not important that your child’s tutor is nice,
but if you’ve ever had to drag your child to tutoring or had to listen to
her whine and grumble every time she goes to tutoring, you’ll appreciate
why nice is relevant. Especially if you want your child to go the distance
(months or years) with a tutor, nice is something you should look out for.
129
Chapter 9: Securing Help without an Individualized Education Program

 Strikes a chord with your child. Your child should relate to the tutor and
want to please him. As a result of this relationship, she tries hard and
gets better marks for her work.
 Is a trained and experienced reading teacher or special education
teacher with experience in teaching reading. A tutor with a teaching
degree and at least three years’ teaching experience is a great start.
 Can tell you about her phonics-based and multisensory teaching methods.
Phonics is the teaching method in which students are shown how to
match letters (and clusters of letters) to speech sounds (see Chapter 12).
In multisensory activities, your child uses a few of her senses at the
same (or roughly the same) time (see Chapter 14).
 Can measure (in tests), and show you, your child’s progress after a few
weeks of tutoring. But remember: Even with experienced and effective
tutors, your child may take months, rather than weeks, to make progress.
You should, however, be able to see your child gaining confidence within
weeks, provided that she starts to have success with tasks she previously
failed.
 Is within your price range. Tutoring can range in cost from about $15 per
hour for a college student (not the best option for your dyslexic child
unless perhaps the student is training in a reading program like Orton-
Gillingham and/or is dyslexic and full of handy strategies) to about
$150 per hour for an experienced therapist trained in Orton-Gillingham.
Recommendations from trusted friends are great if you can get them. But if
teachers and friends can’t give you any leads, where can you find a tutor?
Check out Appendix B. The Web sites and phone numbers I list there take you
to tutors across the country. Check them out and, if they’re fully booked or
not really for you, ask if they can redirect you.
Tutoring is a great option for adults, too. Tutors trained in reading programs
like Orton-Gillingham are usually happy to work with adults. Your local library
and community college are good places to search for free or low-cost adult
literacy programs.
Opting for a general learning center
A general learning center may offer you more flexibility than an individual
tutor. For example, you may be able to take your child to a center at different
times, including weekends. In addition, your child may enjoy seeing different
tutors, and especially if your child gets small group tutoring rather than one-
on-one, you may end up paying less. That’s the good news.
The bad news is that tutors in centers aren’t usually qualified in special needs.
They don’t have training in remedial reading techniques, like Orton-Gillingham,
and they may not know much about dyslexia.
130
Part III: Exploring Your Options for School and Programs 

If your child’s dyslexia symptoms are mild, if she hates the idea of visiting
a dorky tutor but thinks a center is cool, or if you have a friend whose dys-
lexic child did well at your local center, a center may still suit your needs.
In Appendix B, I give you contact details for the big learning centers that
operate in most towns, and in the following sections, you get a quick sum-
mary of how they operate. There are individual differences among centers,
though, so you’ll probably want to use the details I give here as a guide for
asking the right questions (including info on updated prices).
When someone tells you that your child gets individual instruction, check
what this means. Centers that give small group instruction may still call it
“individualized” because, as they explain, each child follows her individualized
program even though she’s part of a small group. Another piece of terminology
that may catch you out is “certified.” Instructors can be certified teachers and/
or certified in the methods of the center (which means they’re not necessarily
qualified to be classroom teachers).
Huntington Learning Centers
Dr. Raymond and Eileen Huntington opened the first Huntington Learning
Center in 1977, and now there are Huntington centers all across the United
States. Instruction is available for children aged 5 to 17 in reading, writing,
math, and phonics as well as in high school subjects and exam preparation.
All instructors at Huntington Learning Centers are certified teachers. Your 
K-to-3 child gets one-on-one instruction. Grade 4 children and older get small
group instruction except in subject tutoring (like algebra) in which tutoring is
one on one.
Your child gets a diagnostic evaluation that takes three to three and a half
hours and costs $195. Tutoring costs $49 an hour for K-to-3 children, $39 an
hour for standard tutoring for grade 4 and older, $65 for subject tutoring, and
$75 an hour for tutoring in exam preparation (for tests like the ACT, SAT, GED,
and PSAT). For more information, go to www.huntingtonlearning.com or
call 800-226-5327.
Kumon Math and Reading Centers
Toru Kumon, a parent and teacher, started Kumon Math and Reading Centers
50 years ago in Japan. Today there are well over a thousand centers in North
America and centers in 43 other countries. Kumon is for any child preschool
to high school age who needs tutoring in reading and math. Test preparation
isn’t offered, but because Kumon has your child take regular tests and do
self-guided homework, it maintains that its students are well prepared for
taking tests like the SAT.
At Kumon Math and Reading Centers, your child learns by working through
sequential worksheets that are administered and marked by instructors. She
must complete her worksheets, have them marked by the teacher, and com-
plete any corrections before she leaves (in 45 minutes) so that she gets
immediate feedback and the teacher is sure she gets it.
131
Chapter 9: Securing Help without an Individualized Education Program

Students typically attend Kumon twice a week year-round and do brief daily
assignments (about 15 minutes) the other five days. Preschool students
attend at fixed times, but other students can show up anytime during open
hours.
Kumon offers two incentives programs to your child. In the Kumon Cosmic
Club, your child earns points redeemable for prizes. The Advanced Student
Honor Roll recognizes older children performing above their grade level.
Tuition at a Kumon center costs from $80 to $110 per month per subject, with
an initial registration fee of $30 to $50. You get a small discount on the cost of
having your child tutored in a second subject (either reading or math), and
everyone gets an initial assessment at no extra cost. Find more information
and a center near you by visiting www.kumon.com or calling 877-586-6673
(in the United States) or 800-222-6284 (in Canada).
Oxford Learning Centers
A team of educators opened the first Oxford Learning Centers in the 1980s.
Now there are over 100 centers spread across the United States and Canada.
Preschool to high school students can attend sessions at these centers.
Your child can take programs in reading, general skills, test preparation (for
tests like the SAT), and French at Oxford Learning Centers. Oxford teachers
aim to help your child with metacognitive awareness, which roughly means
the awareness of how she learns best. For example, when your child appreci-
ates that she has trouble with auditory processing, she moves from thinking
“I don’t get this” to “I need to sit at the front” and “I do better with visual infor-
mation, so I may need to ask the teacher to write what she said on the board.”
For 3- to 6-year-olds, the centers offers a Little Readers program in which
your child gets two hours of tutoring three, four, or five times a week so she
learns the “84 synthetic phonics sounds.”
Parents get ongoing progress reports. Summer programs are available.
Your child gets an initial two-hour dynamic diagnostic assessment for $195.
Tutoring costs $40 to $50 per hour. Oxford offers scholarship programs for
eligible children. Find out more at www.oxfordlearning.com.
SCORE! Educational Centers
The first SCORE! Center was established in 1992, and now there are more
than 160 centers across the United States.
Your child can drop into a SCORE! Educational Center anytime during open
hours (yes, it’s that flexible), twice a week, for an hour each time. Your child
132
Part III: Exploring Your Options for School and Programs 

can get intensive membership, which means she drops in three or four times
a week (prices increase proportionately). Basic subjects your child can be
tutored in are math, reading, spelling, and writing. Supplemental subjects are
science, problem solving, and keyboarding.
Your child works on a computer, but an instructor monitors and guides what
she does. The computer programs are designed to be fun and high energy.
Academic coaches are college graduates, so they tend to be young (which to
your child may mean “cool”). One-on-one paper-and-pen instruction is some-
times available.
Your 4- to 7-year-old child can take an online interactive reading course
(which is run in partnership with Headsprouts, an organization that offers
online interactive reading lessons for children in grades K-2).
Your child sets goals and keeps a scorecard that she uses to earn prizes such
as art cases, CD holders, baseballs, calculators, shirts, and hats. At the end of
each session, your child gets to take basketball shots too, which sort of ties
in with the name “SCORE!” The centers liken themselves to athletic training
in that they are goal- and coaching-oriented, with an emphasis on helping
kids reach their potential and continue to learn and grow.
Tutoring costs $164 to $189 a month. Find out more at www.escore.com or
by calling 866-65-SCORE.
Sylvan Learning Centers
If you’ve thought about having your child tutored, you’ve probably come
across Sylvan Learning Centers, which were started in 1979. Now more than
1,000 Sylvan centers are located across the United States and Canada, and
Sylvan makes the claim that more parents choose Sylvan than any other tutor.
At a Sylvan Learning Center, your child is taught by certified teachers.
Instruction is in small groups for children in grades K–12, and your child usu-
ally goes once or twice a week at a designated time. In addition to reading and
writing, subjects that your child can be tutored in are math, study skills, and
preparation for tests like the ACT and SAT. Live, online tutoring in reading is
available for children in grades 3 to 9. Live, online tutoring in math is available
for children in grades 3 to 8.
Your child earns tokens (for performance and effort) to spend at the on-site
Sylvan shop, which features typical toys and games that kids love.
Your child gets a two- to four-hour initial assessment that costs $175. Tutoring
costs from $47 to $52 per hour. Sylvan offers a student loan program to help
you make payments.

Chapter 9: Securing Help without an Individualized Education Program

Giving Academic Support at Home
Your child may act as if she hears about half of what you say and goes along
with about a tenth of that, but without realizing it, she absorbs your habits
and beliefs. If she’s having a hard time in school, you can help her. In the next
sections, I focus on home-based ways you can help your dyslexic child.
You may want to go all out with your support at home and decide to home-
school your child. For full details on this education option, see Chapter 7.
Letting your child take the 
lead with homework
When your dyslexic child struggles with homework, it’s easy to get into the habit
of doing things for her. You see her working hard to keep up with classmates,
and you want to help. Do what’s best for your child by giving her practical
help that leads gradually to her helping herself, such as the following:
 Type her projects for her, but also see that she starts training on a
typing program so she’s able to type more and more work for herself.
 Dictate spellings to her, but ask her to proofread her answers before you
check them.
 Discuss books with her, but encourage her to ask relevant questions for
herself.
Anytime you help your child, think about how you can take a supporting
rather than a leading role. Your child must develop independence from you,
and besides, work that she can call her own is always more important to her
than work that someone else did.
The older your child gets, the more self-reliant she must be. Right from the
beginning of school, help her get to know her strengths and weaknesses.
Help her make good choices (like using a video recorder for her class report)
and ask for help when she needs it (like having a classroom buddy to call on).
She may need to find ways around her difficulties all her life, so right now is
the time to prepare her and give her the confidence to do so.
Setting up homework management methods
All children do better homework when they establish an effective homework
routine. This is doubly true for a dyslexic child because she has disadvantages
to contend with. Not only are reading and writing hard for your dyslexic child,
but she also may have trouble focusing on homework and remembering 
134
Part III: Exploring Your Options for School and Programs 

precisely what she’s supposed to be doing. Help her manage the homework
monster by trying out these strategies. (If you’re already on top of them, give
yourself a hearty slap on the back for being a regular smarty-pants.)
 Getting set: In the first week of a new school year, many schools send
your child home with a homework survival list. You’re supposed to buy
everything on the list so that when your child announces that she must
make a mobile using different colors of construction paper, some string,
and several sticks, right now, you at least have everything but the sticks.
Have your child’s survival kit (of construction paper, glue, tape, pens, a
ruler, an eraser, a hole puncher, a stapler, scissors, string, and anything
else you think of) at the ready. Then you’re one step ahead of the home-
work monster (and he’s pretty fast).
 Planning: A daily planner is part of your child’s school equipment. Often
the school has you buy a planner directly from it so that every child has
the same one. The planner is really a diary in which your child is supposed
to jot all homework reminders and which you, the parent, signs each day
to verify that she did indeed complete all the day’s homework.
The reality about your dyslexic child’s planner is that she may write
illegibly in it and you may hastily sign it in the morning worrying more
about whether you get peanut butter on it than whether it’s actually
working. Unless you schedule time for looking properly at your child’s
planner each day, it can feel like a daily burden. Help your child under-
stand that short legible notes are best and that each one gets checked
off after she’s answered it. Try to muster up nice feelings about the plan-
ner so that it really is a link between you and the teacher and a gauge of
how well your child is keeping abreast of her daily obligations.
 Prioritizing: Your dyslexic child can easily become absorbed in her
lizard poster when she should in fact be doing her fractions. Help her
put first things first and establish the habit of referring to her planner
every single day. Which things must be done immediately and which can
wait? Does your child need special supplies (like modeling clay) within
the next few days? Do some assignments warrant more attention than
others because they earn her more credit?
 Setting time limits: Your dyslexic child may take longer with her assign-
ments than you think she needs to. She may spend a long time fussing
and complaining. Setting a time limit for each homework subject can
help. If you link rewards (like TV viewing time) to your child completing
a subject in, say 30 minutes, the system may work even better. Parents
who enforce limits and carry through, even though they feel like army
sergeants during the first few days, may find that this strategy ends up
imposing relative calm on a previously homework-shocked household.
 Studying from a guide: A study guide is an at-a-glance summary of the
main points of a topic or, like in algebra, the techniques. If your child has
trouble figuring out the key concepts in a subject (and for that matter,
you do too), you may find that a study guide helps you sort the wood
from the trees.
135
Chapter 9: Securing Help without an Individualized Education Program

 Using hand-held devices: Spell checkers/dictionaries and reading pens are
low-tech, ultra-simple-to-use gadgets that can make your dyslexic child’s
homework go infinitely smoother. A simple spell checker, for about $25,
looks a bit like a calculator. Your child types in her word, probably spelled
phonetically, and sees the correct spelling displayed on the screen. For
about $60 you can buy a spell checker that displays and speaks the words.
A reading pen, for about $280, performs the same functions as a displaying/
speaking spell checker, only your child just has to run the reading pen over
a word (or sentence) to get it displayed and read out to her. To view a
bunch of these nifty hand-held devices, check out www.franklin.com.
See the next section for more info on technology.
 Using software and online materials: Your dyslexic child can do her home-
work much easier if she has access to a comprehensive encyclopedia.
You can install an encyclopedia on her computer or sign up for online use.
One popular encyclopedia available in both of those options is Encarta.
To buy the CD-ROM or DVD (Windows), go to www.amazon.com/exec/
obidos/tg/detail/-/B00027TJCG/002-2234208-1291230?v=
glance. To subscribe for online use, go to www.encarta.msn.com. For
software in special subjects, like foreign languages, search the “software”
category at an online store like Amazon (www.amazon.com) using words
like “children,” “learn,” and “French.”
 Replacing lost items: At some point your child is going to lose some-
thing that she vows she can’t live without. “I can’t do my homework
without it. I’ve looked everywhere. I’m gonna fail,” she’ll sob. Will you
punish her? If she’s lost a book, will you zip to an online bookstore
(like Amazon at www.amazon.com) and buy her another? Will you
make her buy another from her own money?
The point I’m making here is that you probably need to decide, in advance,
on a strategy before you become exasperated and your child’s home-
work (which she can’t do without her book) mounts up.
Using technology
Kids who adeptly cruise the Internet and tap confidently on a keyboard have
a big advantage over those who don’t. You’d be hard pressed to find a child
who’s completely in the dark in these areas, but still, the more knowledge the
better. You may find it humiliating to run to your 10-year-old every few minutes
for help navigating the Web, but in the big picture, the benefits are worth it
(easy for me to say huh?).
I don’t delve into the benefits of the Internet in the following sections (all that
pretty much speaks for itself), but I look at the simpler forms of technology
(like word processors) that you may not be making full use of with homework
and the alternative kinds of technology (like speech-recognition software) that
you may have only heard of. Chapter 20 has more info on some of these tools.
136
Part III: Exploring Your Options for School and Programs 

All of the gadgets in the following sections can, of course, be useful for adult
dyslexics too.
Word processing programs
Basic word processing know-how is pretty much a necessity for anyone who
has to write stuff. But word processing can be especially beneficial for a dyslexic
child for typing her homework:
 Her work looks legible.
 She can enlarge her letters and choose a clear font so she can more
easily read what she writes.
 Typing can be easier on her hands than writing.
 Especially if she practices keyboarding skills, writing is quicker for her.
 She learns a skill and keeps abreast of current trends (not many kids
use pen and paper for assignments these days, and after about grade 2,
many teachers specify that homework assignments must be typed).
As soon as your child lays her fingers on the keyboard of her computer, have
her use the spell check and thesaurus functions in whatever word processing
program you use. The spell check can iron out a lot of her spelling mistakes,
and the thesaurus can turn her little words into the bigger ones she knows
but can’t pull out of her brain.
The read-back feature that you can get on most computers these days is
a great tool for dyslexics, too. When the computer reads back items your
child has typed, she can hear the words she’s written and any mistakes she’s
made. Your child should also get comfortable with the cut and paste features
so she can jot down her first draft of an assignment, run the spell check and
thesaurus over it, and then give it a final cleanup by rearranging the words if
she wants.
You may not even realize (most people don’t) that you have the text-to-voice
function on your computer. Go to your help menu to find it. You get a mechan-
ical sounding read-back of what you type, but it’s still worth having. To buy
text-to-voice software to install in your computer, check out Natural Reader
at www.naturalreaders.com and Read Please at www.readplease.com.
Natural Reader comes in a professional version for $39.50 and a free down-
loadable version, too. Read Please costs $35 and comes in a huge range of
voices that you pick by gender, language, and accent (like Julia-US-Female).
Both programs are for Windows operating systems.
If you’re really savvy with computers, or have a friend who is, you can search
the Internet and find free downloadable text-to-voice programs, including
programs that read Internet pages out loud to you.

links) at the dyslexia site, www.dyslexia-parent.com/mag31.html.
The organization TopTenReviews evaluates a bunch of kids’ typing software
at http://typing-for-kids-software-review.toptenreviews.com/.
Pocket spell checkers
Ever heard of a pocket spell checker? If not, you may want to visit these two
Web sites: www.schwablearning.org/articles.asp?r=444&g=4 and
www.dyslexia-parent.com/software.html. These nifty little gadgets are
inexpensive and, according to many dyslexic students, particularly useful.
Tape recorders and books on tape
A sturdy tape recorder is a great investment for all kids, but especially for
older kids. Your child can use it to tape lessons (ask the teacher’s permis-
sion first) so she can listen to them later and fill in any gaps in her notes or
understanding.
And don’t forget the benefits of having your child listen to schoolbooks on
tape either. If your child’s panicking because she has to read Charlotte’s Web
in a week, or write a report on a book that has more than 300 pages, no prob-
lem. Get the book on tape. If you’re really on the ball, get, in advance, a list of
all the other books her class will be using over the year or semester so you
can order your books on tape early and avoid being wait-listed.
Here are two options for recorded books:
 For a $65 registration fee and $35 annual membership, you can join
Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic at www.rfbd.org, phone 800-
221-4792. Its lending library has more than 98,000 titles in subjects 
ranging from literature and history to math and the sciences, at all
138
Part III: Exploring Your Options for School and Programs 

levels, from kindergarten through professional. Chances are, if the book
is in your child’s curriculum, it’s in the library. Anyone with a documented
disability (in other words, your child’s dyslexia assessment results) is
eligible.
 Books on Tape at www.booksontape.com doesn’t have a lending option,
only buying. The books can be pretty expensive (ranging from $10 to $100
depending on the age and size of the book and whether you buy tapes
or more expensive CDs), so you may want to think about lobbying your
school to fork out for a school library copy. Books on Tape has lower
rates for schools and libraries.
Photocopying and print-recognition software
People who have dyslexia read things over and over. When everyone else
reads a passage once and gets the drift, someone with dyslexia needs to read
and reread before she gets it. Distinguishing key concepts from secondary
concepts is hard for a dyslexic, so she needs to mull over the text and use a
highlighter pen on it.
Get comfortable with photocopiers and scanners so you can ask your child’s
teacher if you can sometimes photocopy his notes, or pages from books he
refers to, for you and your child to read later on. Then, when your child has
an important report to do, you get a better understanding of what’s required
and can be a bigger help to your child. Your child gets the opportunity to
revisit material that may have escaped her in class.
Fancy print-recognition (or optical character recognition) software lets your
child scan pages into her word processor so she can alter and add to the
text. It may all sound puzzling for the technology scaredy-cats among us, but
if you or someone in your family is good with computers, you may want to
include it among your dyslexia-busting arsenal. It can save a lot of tears when
your child wants to do something like scan her handwritten project into a
Word document instead of rewriting it. TextBridge, published by ScanSoft Inc.,
is one program you may want to check out because it’s available as a free demo
download (for Windows operating systems) from www.softlookup.com/
display.asp?id=5585.
Speech-recognition software
When I first tampered with speech-recognition software (also called speech-to-
text software), which lets you talk into your computer and have your words
appear on the screen, the technology was in its teething stage. Now it’s much
better and can chomp firmly down on bigger words and say them back to you
in a more normal-sounding voice. Speech-to-text software is typically used
139
Chapter 9: Securing Help without an Individualized Education Program

by older kids when they do reports and other lengthy written assignments.
Here’s how it works:
1. Buy the software (called names like Dragon Naturally Speaking,
Kurzweil, and Via Voice) and install it on your computer.
2. Train your computer to recognize your voice by talking to it for
many hours.
In the training process, the computer says words back to you so it can
verify your words.
The training takes a long time, and the playback sounds weird because
the computer doesn’t use the same inflections that you use in regular
speech. After you get all this under your belt, however, you’re set to go.
3. Read out what you want to write.
The computer types it for you.
4. Paste it into a word document for final editing.
Presto! You have a piece of written work anyone would be proud of.
Speech-recognition software has come so far now that a program may also
perform the print-recognition functions that I discuss in the previous section.
And here are the benefits of voice-recognition software:
 All those words you could never get down on paper before are at last
there to show the world that you’re smart after all!
 The vocabulary you have in your head now shows up in your reports,
and you get better grades.
 You have the confidence to do things you’ve never done before — like
send a note to someone you like!
 You may get the feeling that your reading is improving.
 You consider going to college now that you can write well.
Speech-recognition technology overwhelms some people, so it’s not the
answer for everyone. But for those who use it, it’s liberating. It’s an equalizer,
and people rely on it. And therein lies the cause of some controversy. Special
education teachers are catching onto this technology, but regular classroom
teachers can be less enthusiastic. Their concern is that this software prevents
kids from learning for themselves, but so far, research shows the opposite.
Children who use speech-recognition technology seem to be making gains in
reading and spelling, and when you think about what’s happening, you can
140
Part III: Exploring Your Options for School and Programs 

see why. Multisensory techniques (see, hear, say, and do) work, and that’s
what this software gives. Say it, then see it on the screen, and then change
the text (type; cut and paste) if you want. (Check out Chapter 14 for more
about multisensory methods.)
To read an article about tests and comparisons of Dragon Naturally Speaking
and Via Voice, check out the Dyslexic.com Web site at www.dyslexic.com/
dictcomp.htm.
Steering clear of a math meltdown
Dyslexia is primarily a language disability, but it can have an impact on your
child’s performance in math. Your child may have trouble remembering
sequences of numbers, like multiplication tables, and what specialized words
like “product” and “reciprocal” mean. In addition, she may confuse written
symbols, such as the division and multiplication symbols, and struggle with
word problems. And she may have these problems even when she’s a whiz
with harder mathematical processes and concepts.
In the following sections, I cover easy methods for helping your dyslexic
child with math at home.
Introducing simple math concepts
If math is a struggle for your younger child, here are a few simple things you
can do at home to help:
 Use beans, counters, or coins to help your child see the four functions
(adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing) in action.
 Bring fractions to life by cutting up cake, bread, or fruit.
 Demonstrate how your child can work out the area of your floor. Do the
same thing with a tabletop and count the individual squares to check
that the formula (length × width) really works.
 Help your child see small angles by having him open a door and tell you
when she’s made a right angle or a bigger or smaller angle.
 Explain place value with pennies and dimes (because ten pennies equals
a dime and kids have familiarity with these small coins). For more activi-
ties to help your child with place value, check out www.mathcat.com/
grownupcats/ideabankplacevalue.html.
 Help your child keep a home bankbook with deposit and withdrawal
columns and figure out her running balance.
141
Chapter 9: Securing Help without an Individualized Education Program

Tackling word problems
Math word problems can give anyone trouble, so in this section I give you
handy tips that your dyslexic child is bound to find useful either for herself
or when she helps friends with their math!
 Read the question at least twice. This advice is important for any child
but especially for your dyslexic child. She needs to not only identify
which word is key but that she has read it correctly in the first place.
 Highlight key words. For example, in a problem like “David has a discov-
ered a number pattern that starts with 1, 4, 9, 16, 25. What are the next
three numbers in this pattern?” the key words are “pattern” and “next
three numbers.”
 Draw a table. This method is good for questions like “Ashley saved $2 on
Tuesday. Each day after that she saved twice as much as she saved the
day before. If she keeps doing this, how much will she save on Friday?
How much will she save in total?” The following table shows how to get
the answer.
Day
Amount Saved
Tuesday
$2
Wednesday
$4
Thursday
$8
Friday
$16
TOTAL
$30
 Work backwards. This technique is for problems like “Trish walked
from Wakefield to Reading. It took her 1 hour and 25 minutes to walk
from Wakefield to North Reading. Then it took 25 minutes to walk from
North Reading to Reading. She arrived in Reading at 2:45 p.m. At what
time did she leave Wakefield?” Your child needs first to establish what
she needs to find out (what time it was when Trish left) and then that
the way to do it is to subtract times backwards from the time she arrived.
Subtract 25 minutes from 2.45 (giving you 2.20) and then 1 hour and
25 minutes from that (giving you a leaving time of 12:55 p.m.).
 Guess and then verify. This works for a problem like “Jill and Liz sold
12 raffle tickets altogether. Jill sold 2 more tickets than Liz. How many
tickets did each girl sell?” Your child must find two numbers that add
up to make 12, with a difference of 2 between them. Guesses: 8 and 4;
9 and 3; 7 and 5 (bravo!).

Working Productively with 
Your Child’s Teacher
In This Chapter
 Getting ready for a conference
 Ensuring a successful meeting
 Accommodating your child’s needs
 Dealing with grades, tests, and rote learning
Your child’s teacher is your greatest ally in helping your child handle
dyslexia. Being in a partnership with your child’s teacher is better
than being at odds with her. Here’s why:
 When you have a friendly relationship with your child’s teacher, she’s
more likely to stay after class to quickly make sure your child knows
what the homework is, jot you a note to let you know the tricky parts of
the homework, and regularly touch base with you by phone or e-mail.
 When the teacher wants to help you out with stuff like assessments and
therapy, she can make calls to people like psychologists so you get your
scissors moving quicker on the red tape.
 When the teacher is comfortable with you, she can call you or leave a
note in your child’s bag so you get quick information. Otherwise, she
may communicate with you via the school secretary and formal notes.
 When your child’s teacher knows you won’t question her judgment, she
tries out different strategies with your child to make tasks easier for him.
 When you’re on friendly terms with the teacher, she’s likely to tell you
about new books or programs she hears about.
And that’s just the beginning! In this chapter, I tell you how to conduct suc-
cessful meetings with your child’s teacher, plan effective accommodations,
and help your child avoid classroom pitfalls.

With the right instruction and accommodations, dyslexic children get better
at reading (even becoming keen readers) and have pretty much the same
experiences at school as anyone else. So let your child know that!
Requesting and Preparing 
for a Conference
On paper establishing a harmonious relationship with your child’s teacher
sounds easy. And in many cases it is. But when your child struggles in class,
tells you how miserable he is, and cries a lot, you may feel that the teacher
isn’t doing enough to help or isn’t doing the right kinds of things to help.
Even if you’re calm and composed, and even if your child is generally happy
and keeping up in class, you need to schedule a meeting with your child’s
teacher. Talking for a few hasty minutes after class or even writing notes or
e-mails to the teacher isn’t the same as getting scheduled, uninterrupted, 
personal time with her. The following sections give you the lowdown of suc-
cessfully setting up and getting ready for a conference.
Don’t go over the head of the teacher as a first response. Have a discussion
with her first because she will understandably feel slighted if you bypass her,
and you may never make up that lost ground. If she doesn’t respond to your
requests for a conference, is rude to you, or acts problematically in any other
way, then you can justifiably approach the principal.
Asking the teacher to meet
Ask your child’s teacher to meet you before or after school for about half an
hour to discuss your child’s progress. Ask her in person or via a note, an
e-mail, or a phone call. If you can manage it, both parents (or guardians)
should attend.
Parents are usually allotted two or three conferences a year at the time that
report cards are given out. You can have a conference at other times too, so
don’t be afraid to ask. Remember, though, the teacher has a life and won’t be
happy staying after school to talk to you about trivial things. If Johnny always
loses his school-to-home notes or doesn’t want to sit next to Jane, you can
probably work it out via notes. Conferences are for your bigger issues.
144
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Assembling important info
What exactly do you want to happen as a result of the meeting? What points
do you especially want to make? Do you already have practical ideas that you
think may help your child keep up in class? You need to jot all this info down
so you don’t get sidetracked and waste any of your time with the teacher.
Keep a paper trail of everything you ask for or tell the teacher about because
you never know when you might need it. Mistakes happen, and details get
forgotten. If they do, your records and notes allow you to remind teachers
what you explained or planned and bring you quickly back on track.
How does your paper trail relate to a conference? Before you meet with the
teacher, jot down suggestions you have for dealing with general problems
and get to the nitty-gritty of specific problems too. If your child is unhappy,
how exactly do you know it? If his homework plunges him into despair, which
particular assignments cause him the most grief? If a book is beyond him,
what’s its title and how much time does he have to read it? Jot down the
details, including dates and conversations, so the teacher knows you’re a
person she can work with. If your child is going through weeks or months
of being upset, jot down specific incidents and the dates they happened.
If you present this information to the teacher in an I-care way (rather than an
I-blame-you way), you increase your chances of getting a great response from
her. Who wouldn’t want to join forces with a reasonable, organized, and caring
parent (that’s you, by the way!)?
You may want to share your sketched-out plan with the teacher before your
meeting. By having a rough idea of the issues that parents want to address,
teachers can reflect on them in advance and not feel like they’re on the spot
during the meeting. They can also bring work samples, future assignments,
current grades, and so on if they know it would be helpful to you.
Determining whether to bring your child
Before the conference, you’ll also want to decide whether you want your child
to come to the meeting. If you think he can benefit from attending, you need
to invite him to come and tell him what will happen, what kinds of things he
may want to talk about, and how he should jot key points down so the meet-
ing stays succinct and on track. Whether you do or don’t invite your child, let
the teacher know in advance.
145
Chapter 10: Working Productively with Your Child’s Teacher

Advantages of having your child attend the conference include the following:
 He gets practice at speaking up for himself.
 He finds out what happens during conferences so he’s prepared to take a
more active role in them as he gets older.
 He’s heard immediately and, likewise, gets immediate feedback.
Possible disadvantages are that your child may have no interest in attending
(he’s a kid and he wants to play or hang out), and he may find it hard to talk
openly to teachers. He may prefer that you relay his thoughts because he can
tell them to you without feeling shy or disrespectful.
Keeping a Conference on Track 
and Following Up Smartly
You don’t get a whole lot of time in a conference with your child’s teacher, so
you want to be sure of making all your points, sending out “I’m competent,
concerned, and incredibly cool to work with” kinds of vibes, and pinning
down outcomes you expect to see as a result of the conference. I walk you
through all these topics and more in the following sections. For examples of
accommodations that teachers can use in response to your child’s issues, see
the section “Coming Up with Cool Accommodations,” later in this chapter.
Creating a positive mood
So how exactly do you project an I-care and I’m-competent tone during the
meeting with your child’s teacher? The trick is to be concise and positive.
(That’s why you write a list of points to cover — see the section “Assembling
important info,” earlier in this chapter, for details.) You want to focus on practi-
cal solutions, not blame, and your comments must tell the teacher that you’re
willing to collaborate and accept her professional judgment.
Your opening remarks should be positive and open. You should say something
supportive to the teacher, like “I’m so glad to have this chance to talk to you,”
and then quickly ask for her impressions of (and concerns about) your child’s
schoolwork and behavior. You need to hear from her early on for two reasons.
 She feels more at ease. Like everyone else, the teacher likes to talk about
things she’s savvy on, and she likes to be listened to. When you give her
this lead, she feels she’s on safe and familiar ground.
 You get a chance to scope out the territory. You find out what the
teacher believes about your child, and you can adjust your own
146
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

remarks accordingly. For example, suppose that your child cries about
his schoolwork most nights and says he’s miserable in class, but the
teacher seems to have no idea about his feelings. You can say something
like “Johnny may be giving you the impression that everything’s okay”
rather than “I’m sure you know that Johnny’s only barely coping.”
Remember to show your appreciation of the good things, big and little, the
teacher does for your child. The first rule for positive and effective work 
relations is to home in on a person’s contributions so that she’s motivated
to make more.
Emphasizing your child’s needs
The way to make sure that you avoid blaming the teacher for your child’s 
difficulties and instead form an alliance with her is to focus on your child’s
needs (not what the teacher may or may not have done). If you talk in terms
of your child’s needs, you pinpoint his problems — not the teacher’s — and
set the stage for planning practical steps that address them.
Describe your child’s problems in terms of his own learning style and person-
ality traits rather than focusing on the teacher’s actions. Lay out your points,
making sure that your tone stays solutions based. To see exactly what I’m
talking about, check out Table 10-1.

Chapter 10: Working Productively with Your Child’s Teacher

Pushing your points firmly
In real life your conference doesn’t stick to a point-by-point format. You may
want to disagree with the teacher. You may feel that she isn’t doing anything
to adjust classroom requirements to meet your child’s needs. You may feel
like you’re not really being heard.
One strategy that can help is to revisit your list of main points. Stay calm,
keep your voice at a normal tone, and repeat the points you think are
key. As you make those points, have the following goals in the back of
your mind:
 Focus on your child, not the teacher.
 Seek specific solutions, not blame
 Make suggestions, not demands.
 Project an all-around air of collaboration, not confrontation.
In Table 10-2, I give a few examples of how a teacher might respond to your
concerns and how you can stick to your points in reply.

Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Adhering to the teacher’s goals
When you speak with your child’s teacher about solutions to problems, respect
the fact that she’s in charge of the class. Keep her goals in mind so that you’re
more likely to come to an agreement in which the goals that both of you have
are maintained.
Your child’s teacher may have plenty of good ideas for helping your child
keep up with assignments and improve his language skills. If so, help her by
monitoring your child’s behavior at home and augmenting anything done in
class. During your conference, you may want to offer the following:
 Working through a phonics program with your child at home, under the
teacher’s guidance (see Chapter 12 for more about phonics)
 Doing guided reading with your child at home, under the teacher’s guid-
ance (see Chapter 13 for time-tested reading strategies)
 Practicing spelling strategies that the teacher recommends
 Making copies of the teacher’s notes or texts so your child is prepared
for coming projects or can revisit information that was given in class
 Getting book lists from the teacher so you can reserve books on tape at
your library or from programs that offer books for the blind and dyslexic
(check this out in Appendix B)
Stay in the teacher’s good graces by remembering that she’s in charge. Ask for
her help. Say that you may have forgotten this or misunderstood that. You may
feel like you’re eating a generous serving of humble pie, but that approach is
easier than getting into a confrontation (by lashing out with statements like
“You didn’t give me this or properly explain that”). Don’t be eager to second-
guess every move the teacher makes, and don’t immediately challenge the
teacher’s professionalism and skills.
Your child needs to use cooperative and constructive words with his teacher
too. Teachers, like everyone else, prefer to deal with polite rather than impo-
lite folks. By talking the right talk, your child practices the important life skill
of showing respect for authority. Help him use terms like “ It’s better for me
if” and “I like to” rather than “No” and “I won’t.”
Taking action after a conference
Immediately after a conference, update your paper trail with the details of
what was said and promised. If you’re good with computers, you may want to
start a chart or database with headings like “date,” “attendees,” “points dis-
cussed,” “goals,” and “follow-up” (see Figure 10-1). Record everyone’s contact
149
Chapter 10: Working Productively with Your Child’s Teacher

details on your chart and (in point form) all the important things that were
said. Determine the dates when you’ll reassess your child’s progress, and
have some idea of behaviors or scores you’re looking for to show whether
your child is making headway. If your child has an Individualized Education
Program (IEP), these details must be on it (I talk about IEPs in Chapter 8).
Coming Up with Cool Accommodations
By using the word “accommodations,” you sound informed. It’s written into
laws that relate to children with dyslexia (see Chapter 8 for details), and it’s
what teachers and professionals talk about.
What, precisely, are accommodations? They’re the big or small changes you
make to your child’s environment and to the tasks he does that enable him to
perform better. When you and your child’s teacher home in on your child’s

specific difficulties, you can probably think of dozens of accommodations.
For some initial inspiration, take a look at the following sections.
Understanding oral instructions clearly
Your dyslexic child may have trouble understanding oral instructions because
he can’t keep a firm hold on sequences of information. He may forget parts of
the sequences, moving for example from step one straight to step four, or he
may muddle up the order of the steps. The following accommodations can
help your child:
 Let the teacher know that your child sometimes struggles with lists of
verbal instructions and ask her to speak clearly and in small bites of
information to him. Also let her know that your child may sometimes
ask her to reiterate things. The teacher may have a preference about
whether she wants your child to do this in class or after class.
 Help your child have the confidence to speak up for himself, perhaps by
role-playing the actual conversation. Your child may be nervous about
asking for help even though to you it seems like a simple thing. Or he may
want to ask and ask, so you can show him how to behave courteously
and appropriately.
 Have the teacher find your child a buddy he can chat with to clarify
what the teacher said.
 Encourage your child to makes notes and lists. At home, help your child
improve his note-taking skills. I talk about this in detail in Chapter 16.
 Ask the teacher if she will write all assignments on the board, on a hand-
out, on the Internet, or in Johnny’s notebook.
Reading large amounts of text
Reading a lot of text at once usually presents problems for a dyslexic child
because he ends up spending hours and hours on an assignment meant to be
fairly short. You can do your part to help:
 When the teacher assigns books to read, borrow books on tape for your
child. He can listen to the text on tape while following the written version.
 Read through homework text with him a few times (see Chapter 13 for
tips on reading with your child effectively).
151
Chapter 10: Working Productively with Your Child’s Teacher

Comprehending text
A dyslexic child’s text comprehension may not be strong because he loses
the flow and gist of what he’s reading when he takes a long time figuring
words out. You can accommodate his needs in the following ways:
 Encourage your child to draw story maps and mind maps, highlight key
words in text, and talk the text over with other students (maybe a buddy).
(A story map is a pictorial depiction of events in a story, and a mind
map is like a story map, only it depicts whatever it is you’re learning.
Have you ever seen people drawing bubbles that link to other bubbles?
That’s a mind map.)
 Help your child at home by drawing story maps and mind maps for
assigned books and going over text with him until he understands key
concepts and sequences of events.
Writing large amounts of text
Writing can give a dyslexic child trouble because he really has to think about
most of the words he’s jotting down. The following suggestions can help your
child with writing:
 See that your child learns to touch-type. Touch typing is the art of typing
without looking at the keyboard, and your child needs to get at least to
the stage where he uses all his fingers on the keyboard and checks on
them only intermittently.
 Type for your child while he dictates homework assignments to you.
 Buy speech-to-text software for your child and help him learn how to
use it. He gets to dictate stuff to his computer and have it appear in a
word processing document, thus saving him the hard work of writing.
As long as your child understands what he’s dictating, this software
doesn’t make him lazy but helps him compete on an even field with
classmates. In fact, some researchers say that speech-to-text software
actually improves your child’s spelling because he’s saying the words,
then seeing them appear on the screen, so his learning is multisensory.
See Chapter 9 for more info.
152
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Copying from the board with ease
A dyslexic child can have difficulty copying words from the board; by the
time he shifts his eyes from the board to the paper, he’s forgotten the image
he just saw. You can find ways to make copying words easier for your child:
 Ask the teacher to make sure that your child sits close to the board.
 Ask the teacher to underline key words; your child can copy only these.
 Make sure your child has a buddy whose notes he can take home to
copy (or maybe the teacher can photocopy them).
Spelling successfully
Spelling can be rough for your child because he has trouble matching letters
to sounds and may have trouble facing individual letters the right way too.
Consider these ways of accommodating his needs in this area:
 Help your child develop his phonemic and phonics skills when he does
language homework by showing him word families like might, sight, tight,
slight, and right. I talk about this in detail in Chapter 12.
 Help your child group spellings he brings home from class into families.
 Help your child sound out parts of his spelling words and highlight
(to visually memorize) parts that don’t sound out.
 Coach your child on the memorizing strategy: look, cover, write, check.
First, he looks at the word, then covers it with his hand or paper or a
book, writes it from memory, and, finally, checks what he’s written
against the original word and makes corrections. Your dyslexic child
usually needs to write a word out several times before it sticks in his
visual memory, and even then, he should check that it’s still there a
few hours later!
 Help your child to put each spelling word from a list on a small piece of
paper so he can spread and overturn all the words in playing-card fashion.
In Chapter 11 I describe how your child can keep ten words in an enve-
lope and play a few games with them each day (for about five minutes)
to help him remember them.
153
Chapter 10: Working Productively with Your Child’s Teacher

Finishing classroom work 
and homework on time
A dyslexic child’s timing skills may be weak; it takes him longer than other
students to complete tasks, and he may be more disorganized than the aver-
age child too. Here are ways to help your child finish his work on time:
 See that your child has a buddy to help him in ways the teacher speci-
fies, like putting away supplies, so that he has fewer things on his plate
and can focus on the more important tasks at hand.
 Help your child keep a calendar or pocket organizer and follow a time
line to complete assignments.
 See that your child uses speech-to-text software, books on tape, a
laptop, and other time-saving gadgets.
Avoiding Dyslexic Land Mines 
with a Teacher’s Help
For dyslexic children, some things that typically go on in school are virtual
land mines. Your dyslexic child dreads being graded and taking standardized
tests, hates being timed or having to race the clock when he does spellings,
and can never churn out facts and figures, like multiplication tables, that other
children learn by rote in a few weeks. In the next sections, I give you advice
on helping your child skirt around these land mines.
Being graded, tested, and (worst) retained
If your child goes to any school other than some alternative schools (see
Chapter 7 for more on those), his teacher has to grade him. She generally
grades his performance according to a list of given skills and can hold him
back a grade if she feels he’s not coping. Children also take plenty of stan-
dardized tests during their years in school.
Grades can embarrass and stress out your child, but retention (being held
back a grade) is a lot worse. In the following sections, I give you advice on
asking the teacher to be sensitive about grades and tackling standardized
tests, and then give you the latest news on what researchers have found out
about grade retention.
154
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Making the grade
Your child may get Cs, Ds, or worse in his school grades no matter how hard
he tries because grades primarily reflect his ranking (how he compares to
classmates) rather than the effort he makes.
Can anything be done? Absolutely. You can ask for special consideration for
your child, and this is where the good relationship you’ve cultivated with the
teacher really comes in handy! (See the section “Keeping a Conference on Track
and Following Up Smartly,” earlier in this chapter, for details.) Ask your child’s
teacher to tweak her normal grading system to meet your child’s extra needs.
Exactly what kind of tweaking helps? The kind that puts your child’s effort
into the frame. You want your child’s grades to reflect his effort. So that
everyone knows what counts as effort, you may want to collaborate with the
teacher to draw up a bunch of identifiers that influence his grade. For example,
you may want the list to indicate when your child accomplished the following:
 Wrote more than one page
 Answered every question
 Used periods and capital letters
 Wrote his name and the date
 Started each line against the margin
 Included diagrams, lists, or pictures
The teacher should have plenty of ideas about what to include as grading
identifiers, and after the list is drafted, you may want to finalize it with your
child. It’s really his list because from it he can see that any effort he makes
really pays off. He should understand how the system works and, as a result,
feel motivated. Of course, encouraging comments, stars, and smiley faces on
his work may count just as much to him too.
Surviving standardized tests
When all the parents in school are talking about achievement tests, and you
get a note from the school saying that your child will be taking tests for two
whole weeks and that only famine, disease, or pestilence should keep him
from attending school at this important time — the pressure is on! This is the
standardized, high-stakes testing that politicians assure us improves standards
in our schools.
These tests are “standardized” because hundreds of children have taken
them in order to get a norm (what most kids the same age can be expected to
score) and a range (how far either side of that norm the rest of the kids usually
score). Standardized tests have names like the California Achievement Test
(CAT) and the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT).
155
Chapter 10: Working Productively with Your Child’s Teacher

These tests, predictably enough, are hard on your child for a few reasons:
 Your child may have trouble reading the questions.
 He may need more time than other children to answer the questions
(because he reads more slowly).
 He may mark the wrong answer boxes in multiple choice tests because
he confuses b and d or forgets which letter he was thinking of.
 He may be improving in class, but the test results don’t show that.
 He may perform badly on tests because, knowing that he does badly on
them, he’s understandably nervous.
How can you (with the help of your child’s teacher) help your child get
through these tests and come out unscathed or even optimistic?
 If your child has an Individualized Education Program, or IEP (I talk about
IEPs in Chapter 8), you need to use it to plan for tests. Decide how your
child’s teacher will prepare him for tests and what accommodations he
can use during the test. Accommodations such as having extra time or a
reader to read questions out loud to your child can make all the differ-
ence in his score.
 High-stakes testing, in which one test result determines huge things like
whether your child advances to the next grade, is not impossible to get
around. If you run into problems with the outcome of the testing, contact
one of the big organizations I list in Appendix B. The International Dyslexia
Association and the Learning Disabilities Association have experience
with contesting school district decisions. The legal organizations I list
can tell you about other families who have fought their cases in court.
Before getting into battle though, consult the usual chain of command in
your school (teacher, school counselor, principal, and superintendent).
Your school doesn’t really want to get into a dispute with you, and chances
are, you can come to a happy resolution without working up a sweat.
In addition to speaking to your child’s teacher about standardized tests,
you can provide some help at home. Ask your child’s guidance counselor or
resource teacher about summer classes or if they have practice tests you can
use. Your dyslexic child needs plenty of practice runs on these tests. Attack
them in short blasts and have good things to eat. You want to prepare your
child but not exhaust or terrify him.
Also, tutors can help your child prepare for tests and may offer test-preparation
courses specifically for exams like the SAT that older kids take. I talk about
tutoring in more detail in Chapter 9.
156
Part III: Exploring Your Options for Schools and Programs 

Staying back a grade
For the past few years, the trend has been for teachers to keep some children
back a grade, especially in kindergarten and especially with boys. Grade reten-
tion is a real hot potato, however. Many parents and teachers believe that
retention allows a child to mature and get extra practice in class, but many
researchers say that the evidence just doesn’t bear this out.
Based on studies of the way that retained children see themselves and per-
form on class tests, researchers say that retained children
 Feel ashamed or embarrassed in front of other kids because they’re
bigger and older than classmates.
 Get teased by classmates for being “dumb.”
 Feel that their parents forced or misled them into staying back a grade.
 Don’t make appreciable headway in the skills they initially lacked and often
fall back even further (compared to struggling kids who were not retained).
 Are much more likely than nonretained children to drop out of school.
 Often say that being held back was the worst thing that ever happened
to them.
Holding a child back is done with the best intentions, but it can have long-
term dangers. Grade-retained children invariably report that being held back
traumatized them, and some researchers link increased rates of substance
abuse and depression in adolescence with grade retention in earlier years
(for details, check out www.schwablearning.org/articles.asp?r=315).
Grade retention at the time of moving from one school to the next may work
for your child. If, for example, he finds that he’s entering a grade in which all
the students are a year older than him (because he started school earlier in
another place), then the school may give him the choice of whether to join
that grade or start out a grade lower (with same-age children). The lower
grade may be more attractive if your child chooses it himself.
Your child’s teacher has a lot of say in whether your child is retained or pro-
moted, but if you disagree with proposed retention, even if your child has
scored low in tests, you should contest the proposal and say why your child
should be promoted; for example, you can say that he can get private instruc-
tion in his weak areas, and research points to the damaging effects of retention.
There are no hard-and-fast rules for retention, and some parents who have
taken their objection to retention to court have succeeded in having their
children promoted.
157
Chapter 10: Working Productively with Your Child’s Teacher

The best way to address your child’s academic problems is to give him individ-
ualized instruction in his areas of weakness (if he has an IEP, this instruction is
described in it). And if your child has dyslexia, the arguments against retention
are especially pertinent. Research shows that a dyslexic child doesn’t catch up
to his peers by being given more of the same instruction. He catches up through
multisensory instruction that takes him systematically through phonics.
(I cover phonics in Chapter 12 and multisensory activities in Chapter 14.)
Learning in parrot fashion
Rote learning is the process by which your child learns isolated facts (like
multiplication tables, dates of events, and names of cities) by parroting them
out many times. Not many people are great at rote learning because it’s hard
to remember things without using memory joggers (like rhymes) or attaching
meaning to them. But your dyslexic child may find rote learning even harder
because his short-term recall of information is weak even with memory joggers
(see Chapter 11 for more about these items). The added challenge of having
to recite facts at a fast speed, which happens in most classrooms, can cause
him major stress.
Strategies that can help your child join in activities like chanting multiplication
tables include allowing him to use a calculator or a fact sheet. The teacher,
together with your child, should probably explain this accommodation openly
to the class first so that students realize the work isn’t made easier for your
child, just accessible.
Smoothly integrating children with disabilities into a classroom requires good
communication. When other students can walk a few miles in the shoes of
children with disabilities and see that they’re not favored in class but rather
included, integration has every chance of being successful.

In this part . . .
W
hen your child has dyslexia, she struggles with
phonics. In this part of the book, you get every-
thing you need to know about phonics, including how to
help your child sound out tricky words like right and round.
But of course, phonics isn’t the whole picture. Your child
needs to recognize “sight words,” such as who and they,
instantly, and she needs plenty of real reading and multi-
sensory activity. And besides all of that, her dyslexia makes
things, like following sequences of instructions, difficult, so
she also needs help there. In this part, I give you practical
advice on all of these topics.

verybody uses rhymes and memory joggers now and then. “I before e
except after c” is probably etched on millions of minds, and think how
handy “spring forward; fall back” is for helping you set your clock to a new
hour twice a year!
When you’re dealing with dyslexia, rhyming and visualizing can be virtual life-
lines. In this chapter, you get the handiest memory joggers of all for helping
your dyslexic child master many words that start off looking pretty formidable.
Just about all the activities that I describe in this chapter (especially the ones
related to spelling, sight words, sound-alike words, and mnemonics) are good
for anybody, young or less young. After all, a few extra years don’t suddenly
make you want to avoid effective learning strategies, even if they are more
fun than you were expecting!
One by One: Starting with Single Letters
Remembering 26 of anything can be hard, so you need to give your dyslexic
child a lot of practice with the look and sound of each letter of the alphabet
before she can remember all 26 letters.

You can run through the “a is for apple” type of activities and flip through
alphabet books with her, and that’s good, but an even better approach is to
bring each letter alive. Draw sound-associated pictures into them, and make
some of them into quirky characters. I’m beginning to sound ethereal now, so
how about letting me give you practical examples of exactly what I mean in
the following sections?
Drawing pictures into vowels
Looking at apples, alligators, and ants to learn about the letter a is a fairly
complex business. In fact, when you think about it, it’s amazing that children
learn this way because, unless your child already knows the a sound of the
letter a, how does she recall that apple, alligator, and ant are all a words?
A much easier way for a dyslexic child to learn the 26 letter sounds is to learn
just 26 images. Help your child remember the letters by turning them into
visual images or models she can feel.
Vowels are especially tricky for your dyslexic child because each vowel
always has at least two sounds, short and long, and can make other sounds
too (about 44 of them) when grouped together with other letters. In the fol-
lowing vowel activities, you do away with vowel names altogether and focus
wholly on sounds and vowel-specific visual images.
 Help your child remember the sound of short a by having her draw the
letter a from an apple. She holds the apple on paper and draws around it
and then adds the vertical stick to make a. Have her make the a (like in
apple) sound while she’s holding and drawing.
 Help your child remember the sound of short e by having her draw a big
e and nesting an egg (hard boiled!) in the semicircular part of the letter.
Explain that no other letter has that nice shape that fits snuggly into that
semicircular part, so when she sees the letter e, she can think of egg
(the short e sound is like the e in egg).
 Help your child remember i for ink by having her hold down a pen and
draw around it. Have her add the ink blob on top to make i and remem-
ber, i is for ink (say it out loud).
 Help your child remember the sound of short o by having her draw an
octopus’s legs coming off the letter o. Tell her that o is a round, smooth
octopus that has its eight legs tucked under it when you see it as plain o.
Remember to say o for octopus.
 Help your child remember u with a u-handled umbrella. U is for umbrella.
If you don’t have a u-handled umbrella, you can just turn u into a nice
image. Add arrowheads to the two ends of the u (pointing upwards) and
tell your child that u is for up. (She has to say it out loud, of course, to
get the full multisensory complement!)
162
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

You may already have guessed this, but I’m not the first person to think of
turning letters into characters. Many early learning and phonics programs
draw characters into letters to help kids remember them. Two programs that
are well worth looking at are Letterland and Zoo-Phonics. Both programs have
books, flashcards, CD-ROMS, readers, and a whole mega bunch of goods, so if
you want to start your child on letter sounds from scratch, check them out
at www.letterland.com and www.zoophonics.com or flip to Chapter 4,
where I tell you more about these products and give some prices.
Knocking b and d into shape
A dyslexic child typically has trouble facing her letters the right way, and the
letters that cause her the most trouble are b and d. There are two good ways
you can help your child get her b’s and d’s to behave, and they both involve
visualizing cute images.
Batter up!
If your child’s a baseball nut, you’ll like this trick. Tell your child to think
“bat and ball” and hear the b sound. Now have her draw a standing-up 
baseball bat (a cricket bat works too) and next to it, on the ground, a ball.
You’ve made the letter b, and now you just have to remember that d faces
the opposite way.
The one glitch with the bat and ball image is remembering which side to place
the ball. I always tell kids to think of the reading and writing direction, or left
to write. You write from left to right, and that’s the direction to remember
when you draw first the bat and next the ball.
Make your bed!
Here’s a way to remember b and d together in one snuggly image. Take a look
at Figure 11-1 and then read the instructions that follow to see what it’s all
about:
1. Explain to your child that the bed picture can help her remember which
way b and d face.
2. Draw this simple shape: l__l
Have your child do the same.
3. Draw a pillow and blanket on top of yours and have your child do the
same with her picture.
4. Write the word bed in the bed picture, using the sides of the bed as the
vertical lines in your b and d, and sound it out so that your child hears
the b and d sounds. Have her do the same on her picture.
163
Chapter 11: Putting Memorizing, Visualizing, and Rhyming to Good Use

5. Tell her that when she can’t remember b (“buh”) or d (“duh”), she can
just make her bed! Be sure that nothing is sticking out — that’s the big
secret. (If letters face the wrong way, they stick out and someone may
trip over them.)
6. Explain that she’s making a big bouncy bed as a quick way of remember-
ing the orientation of b and d.
You can also show your child how to make her bed with her hands. Figure 11-2
shows you how. Just have your child touch the tips of her thumb and forefin-
ger together on each hand (making a circle), then point her remaining fingers
straight up together (making a b shape with the left hand and a d shape with
the right).

Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Putting P in its place
Some dyslexic kids have trouble distinguishing between the number 9 and
the letter P. Here’s a way to iron it out:
1. Ask your child which direction she reads and writes in. Get the answer
“left to right” from her and have her point to the right.
2. Ask her to tell you a name that begins with P, like Peter, Paul, or Polly.
3. Tell her to draw a face onto the circle part of P, the nose pointing in the
reading and writing direction.
4. Ask your child to add features like hair, a cap, and glasses and write the
person’s name above him.
5. Tell your child that whenever she’s not sure about P, she can draw her
character, facing in the reading and writing direction. You can see a
sample P drawing in Figure 11-3.
Letters Joining Forces: Getting on Top 
of a Few Good Spelling Rules
When letters band together, they can retain their individual sounds but still
blend smoothly together, or they can make new sounds that you just have to
get to know afresh, like ch and ir. Luckily, some of the most common letter
clusters are governed by nifty and easy-to-remember rules. Dyslexic kids espe-
cially need to have a few rules up their sleeves so they can impose order on
letters that otherwise make no sense to them.

Chapter 11: Putting Memorizing, Visualizing, and Rhyming to Good Use

In the next sections, I show you blatantly Bossy e, friendly vowels that conform
to the adage “opposites attract,” and the timeless rhyme “i before e except
after c.”
Get full use from the tables I provide in the following sections by having your
child go through plenty of re-readings, spot spelling rules, and write words out
for herself. This kind of repetition and consolidation (firming up understanding)
is really helpful to dyslexic children, so to make sure you cover it, have your
child do the following:
 Read all the words, first to last.
 Read all the words, last to first.
 Read words in random order as you point to them.
 Read every second or third or fifth word.
 Find words as you call them out.
 Highlight each family (a-e words, e-e words, i-e words, o-e words, and 
u-e words) in a different color.
 Write out words that you dictate.
Blatantly Bossy e
Have you ever noticed the pattern in words like pin and pine, hop and hope,
mad and made? This simple rule explains it: When you add e onto the end of
small words like pin, or to word-parts like lak, the e bosses the earlier vowel
into shouting out its name. Pin becomes pine (hear the change in the vowel
sound), lak becomes lake, and all the while the surreptitiously Bossy e stays
silent itself.
The long sound of a vowel is the same as its name, like in ay, ee, eye, oh, and
you. I say that the vowel shouts its name in response to Bossy e because that
concept tends to be easier for a child to remember than telling her that the
vowel makes its long sound.
The Bossy e rule helps your dyslexic child read and write hundreds of words,
but if you’re the creative type and have a younger child, you may prefer the
Magic e version of the same rule:
Magic e is a special letter. When it sits on the end of a word, it throws its
magic dust out. The dust floats over the neighboring letter but sticks to
the vowel. The vowel feels so special that it shouts out its name.
With this rule, you get to grab some glitter or glitter pens (magic dust) and
draw posters of Magic e doing its thing. It looks cute and helps to plant the
rule firmly in your child’s mind. Wands and cloaks add even more magic.
166
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Now that you know the rule, you’re probably wondering about the hundreds
of words that use it. I said that Bossy e enables your child to read and write
oodles of words, so here, to put the truth to my claim, is Table 11-1, which
lists at least some of those Bossy e words.

Chapter 11: Putting Memorizing, Visualizing, and Rhyming to Good Use

Your child likes to show off to you. Let her read and write words for you and
be appreciative of her effort. Soup up the writing part by providing her with a
book-sized whiteboard and colored markers. Have your own too so you can
write her messages or join in the activity with her.
Extroverted and introverted vowels
All vowels can make a short sound (like in apple, egg, ink, octopus, and up) or
a long sound (which is the same as saying the names of the letters). The rule
that I give you now helps your dyslexic child distinguish which sound (short
or long) a vowel is making in a word. Prepare to smile, because this rule is
such a cute rhyme that it’s easy to remember:
“When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking.”
How does it work? Your child sees four particular pairs of vowels, side by
side in words, time and time again. They’re the buddies, ee, ea, ai, and oa,
and they’re special because when they go walking only the first one does the
talking. The second vowel is the quiet type and says nothing. The first vowel
is the loud type and it shouts, I’m sure you’ll be surprised to hear, its name.
Your child only has to remember the four pairs of friends (each comprised of
an extrovert and an introvert), and like before, hundreds of new words become
clear to her. In Table 11-2, you get plenty to try out. Go through the reading,
finding, highlighting, and writing activities that I gave earlier in this chapter,
and your child will soon be feeling comfortable with the walking vowels.

The groups your child highlights for this rule are ee, ea, ai, and oa words
(the four most common walking partners). Ask your child which groups
are the biggest and smallest so she can see how often ee and ea crop up.
An old favorite: “i before e except after c”
Here’s the old-timer of spelling rules. Just about everyone has heard of it,
including parents and grandparents, and it’s handy because it helps your
dyslexic child tame some pretty ferocious spellings, like receive, perceive,
and receipt, and neighbor and eight too. Here’s the full verse:
“i (‘eye’) before e (‘ee’) except after c (‘see’) unless you hear ‘ay’ 
(like in neighbor and weigh)”
Table 11-3 has some spellings that demonstrate that rule.

I Know You! Having Fun with Sight Words
Some words in our language crop up a lot more often than others. Take, for
example, the word they. You see they time and time again, so it’s a word that
your dyslexic child must get to know early on and thoroughly. Luckily, a guy
named Edward W. Dolch counted the frequency of commonly used words
170
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 
In compliance: Most words follow 
the “i before e” rule
Words like believe and weigh follow the “i
before e except after c unless you hear ay” rule
so nicely that I feel I’m about to spoil the mood.
You see a lot of words don’t follow the rule, lead-
ing people to say downright peevish things like
“Is this rule useful at all?” Well, at the risk of
incurring the wrath of those of you who can
think of half a zillion words that don’t give a hoot
about “i before e,” I have to say I shall remain
a fan.
And what’s more, I just happen to have found
someone who likes counting words and has
investigated just how often, or not, the “i before
e” rule works. At www.usingenglish.
com/weblog/archives/000021.html,
you can find a discussion about the efficacy of
the “i before e” rule that ends by saying that the
rule, when taught properly, works approximately
90 percent of the time. The “properly” part
means that you should tell your child not just “i
before e except after c unless you hear ‘ay’ (like
in neighbor and weigh).” Your child also needs
to know this rule:
“i before e except after c unless you hear
‘ay’ (like in neighbor and weigh) or when cie
makes a ‘shuh’ sound (like in ancient, profi-
cient, and deficient)”
Phew, have I blinded you with science yet? If
not, and you rather enjoy a debate, you can find
a nice discussion of the “this rule is useless”
side of the argument, and a whole bunch of
rule-breakers (which may in fact work if you
follow the “or when cie makes a ‘shuh’ sound”
addition to the rule!) at www.alt-usage-
english.org/I_before_E.html.

back in the 1950s and came up with a list of 220 of the most common words
of all. Ever since then, teachers have used this list, or others like it, to help
children get “sight” recognition of those most common words. You hear
teachers call them “most common” or “frequently used” words, or “sight”
words. I call them “sight” words because I want you to know that the signifi-
cant thing about them is that your child needs to have instant (or sight)
recognition of them.
Your child needs instant recognition of all 220 of the sight words in order to
be a fluent reader. Without this, she is a stop-start, “I’ll get it in a minute” kind
of reader, which is frustrating for her and everyone else.
In Table 11-4, I list Mr. Dolch’s 220 sight words.

The more practice you give your child with sight words, the better she remem-
bers them. That said, the following sections are devoted to simple and fun
activities you can do with your child to really bring those words home.
Ten at a time
The simplest way for your child to learn to read or write a new word is to
read and/or write it plenty of times. Have her do this by running her though
these activities using ten sight words at a time:
1. Write ten sight words on ten pieces of paper. Have your child spread
them out face down and then ask her to turn each word over, read it,
and then, without referring back to it, write it on her paper.
2. Have your child put the ten words into a stack and ask her to turn each
one over, read it, and then write it down.
3. Holding the words in a fan facing you, ask your child to pick a word,
read it, and write it down.
172
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

4. Holding the ten words in a fan facing you, ask her to select but not look at
a word and then take three guesses at which word she’s selected. If she
guesses correctly, she reads it and writes it down. If not, it goes back into
the fan. Keep going until she’s done all ten words.
These activities take only five or ten minutes. Have your child put her ten
words into an envelope and do any or all of the activities every day for a
week (breakfast or bedtime are great times). By the end of a week, she’ll be
right at home with the words. If not, pop any words she still struggles with
back into the envelope to comprise part of her next ten words.
Use fewer than ten words if you think that works better for your dyslexic
child, but don’t use more than ten words. Your child can’t remember more
than ten, and getting a solid grasp of ten words is better than a tenuous
grasp of twenty.
Picture this
Dyslexic children remember graphic images far better than written words, so
it makes perfect sense for them to turn words into images whenever they can
(so they remember them better). Sight words like jump, walk, and eat are ideal
for this. Your child can make letters jump out of jump, add a pair of feet to the
bottom of the k in walk, and put eat on a plate.
For inspiration, check out www.picturemereading.com. Then grab some
markers and a snack and settle down with your child for some cartoon fun.
If your child is a great artist and you’re not, she’ll especially enjoy sympathiz-
ing over your indistinct doodles while being a paragon of modesty about her
own masterpieces.
Bang!
Here’s a noisy game for a few players that provides lots of laughs. Write 32 sight
words on individual pieces of paper and write the word “bang” on 8 pieces
of paper. Place all the pieces of paper into a box or can. Player number one
takes a word and reads it out. If she is correct, she keeps the card, and play
goes to the next player. Players keep taking one card and reading out the
word until a player pulls out a “bang” card. She shouts out “bang” and puts
all her cards back. The winner is the person left holding the most cards.
173
Chapter 11: Putting Memorizing, Visualizing, and Rhyming to Good Use

Word roll
For this group game, you need three pieces of colored paper, a dice, and
three boxes. Cut each piece of colored paper into 20 ticket-sized pieces and
write a different sight word on each ticket. Put each color into a separate
box. Player number one rolls the dice and takes from any box the number of
words that corresponds to the number she rolled. She reads the word, and if
she is correct, play goes to the next player. If she misreads any word, all her
words go back into the box. The winner is the player with the most words
when all the boxes are empty.
Soup this game up by having number 1 on the dice mean “miss a turn” and
number 6 mean “you win an extra roll.”
Five up
This is a card game for two or more players. The size of your card deck depends
on how many people play. For two players, you need a pack of 30 cards com-
prised of 15 pairs of identical sight words.
Deal four cards to each player, face up in a row. Deal five face-up cards in the
middle of the table. Place the remainder of the pack face down in the middle
of the table. Player number one checks her cards against the five center cards
to see if she has a match. If she does, she takes the card or cards that match,
keeps her pairs, and draws cards to rebuild her hand and the five center
cards. Play moves to the next player and so on until all the cards are paired.
The winner is the player with the most pairs.
174
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 
Playing the numbers (and name) game
Dyslexic kids not only have trouble with reading
and spelling words; they can have a hard time
with numbers and names too. You can help your
child remember stuff like who to call and how
with a few handy tips:
 Have your child remember phone numbers in
chunks of numbers rather than in single num-
bers. It’s easier to remember 782-22-33-240
than 7-8-2-2-2-3-3-2-4-0. Even better, attach
meaning to the chunks: “7 ate (munch, munch)
2”; 22 (my aunt’s age); 33 (one digit up from
22); 240 (two was regurgitated, then dou-
bled, and then zeroed out!).
 Have your child remember people’s names by
visualizing them in different poses, clothes,
or whatever, or by remembering who else
has that name. I once had to remember the
name “Verpee” and could only do it by start-
ing off with “verb.” Names like Mr. Hill, Mr.
Mountain, and Mr. Wood (all topographical)
go together nicely, and Tanya can have a tan,
Ashley can smoke, and Kelly can be smelly!

Bingo
Smaller children like playing bingo, and prizes like packets of markers
and candy bars can add incentive. You need bingo-type cards divided into
25 squares (5 rows x 5 rows), a list of 100 sight words, scissors, a pen, and
coins to use as markers.
Write a different arrangement of words from the list of a hundred onto each
bingo card. Have players take a bingo card and a bunch of coins and let one
person be the caller. The caller cuts up the 100 words and put them into a
calling box. The caller pulls words out of the calling box, one at a time, and
calls them out. She jots down each called word too so she can check the
winner’s words at the end of play. Each player places a coin over any called
word she has on her card until someone gets a row of five. That player calls
out “bingo,” and if the caller finds her words were indeed all called out, that
player wins.
Have your child help write the 100 words and the bingo cards. Let the players
take turns at being caller too because all of this practice with words helps a
dyslexic child memorize them.
Do You See the Sea? Distinguishing
between Sound-Alike Words
Plenty of words sound the same but are spelled differently, which may confuse
your dyslexic child to no end. Sound-alike words are called either “homonyms”
or “homophones.” You may hear the word “homographs” too. Here’s a quick
explanation of all three terms:
 Homonyms: A general term for words that are the same in sound but not
in spelling (like son and sun), in spelling but not sound (like bow in your
hair and bow of a ship), or in both spelling and sound (like grave in a
cemetery and grave as in serious). Homographs and homophones are
subsets of the bigger, general term “homonyms.”
 Homophones: These words sound the same but are spelled differently,
such as you are nice and the farmer has a ewe.
 Homographs: Words that are spelled the same but are pronounced dif-
ferently, like bow in your hair and bow to the king.

How can you help your child read and spell the common pairs of sound-alike
words, like seen and scene, that bother even nondyslexics? You can do the
following:
 Help her put words in “families.” A family is a set of words with the same
ending, like in light, bright, tight, sight, and might. Your child remembers
one written pattern and, from it, generates a whole bunch of words.
Anytime you see a family, show it to your child so you give her a quick
hoist up the spelling ladder.
 Be sure she understands what each word in a pair means and, if it’s
appropriate, which word is more common. Pairs of words in which one
176
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

word of the pair is much more commonly used than the other include
seem and seam; where and wear; and not and knot. When your child
learns the common spelling first, she at least knows which situations it
doesn’t apply to. To find the more unusual spelling after that, she can
try a few drafts of possible spellings to see which one looks right.
 Help your child mark parts of words that don’t sound out, or sound out
in unusual ways, so she learns them by their visual appearance. Colored
highlighter pens are good for this, but circling or underlining the letters
works too. The words to have your child mark are words like break
(the ea is unexpected), allowed (two l’s and the ow spelling), and scene
(pronounce it to help remember its spelling). Mark away! Encourage
your child to mark any word in any way that helps her remember the
look of it.
Looking for a great book of word lists? The Reading Teacher’s Book of Lists,
by Edward Fry, PhD (published by Jossey-Bass), has a great collection of
homographs and homophones and all sorts of other great stuff.
The Hard Stuff: Remembering 
Especially Tricky Words
Oh my gosh, how much fun can a person stand? In this section I give you a
whole bunch of cute mnemonics (memory joggers) that teachers (the cool
ones) show their students (especially the dyslexic ones) to help them with
words that always trip people up. You get sayings that help your child do the
following:
 Sort out the cause part of because.
 Choose wisely between stationery and stationary.
 Organize every incarnation of to (to, too, and two).
And that’s only the half of it!
Rhymes and other mnemonics that help you order letters inside a word
are particularly useful for your dyslexic child because poor visual recall
(which letter goes where) can be a big part of her dyslexia. Show your child
any mnemonic you know and help her come up with some of her own, too.
Start with the ones in Table 11-6. Fix them in her mind by singing, saying, and
using them often. If it helps to repeat them ten times straight or write them
down, do that, too.

earth will your dyslexic child remember the order of all those unexpected 
letters? I haven’t come across a really great mnemonic yet, but here are two
that are better than nothing!
“Indian girls have toys.”
“Isabel goes home today.”
I warned you that they weren’t great! Maybe you and your child can think up
something infinitely better, and for that matter, change any of the suggestions
I give you into things you think will stick better.

 Working out difficult vowel sounds
 Taking control of challenging consonants
W
hen you take a look at what happens in dyslexia programs, phonics is
key. Phonics is the teaching method in which you show your child that
single letters and chunks of letters represent the sounds he hears inside words.
Phonics is pretty much the backbone of learning to read (and the thing that
catches dyslexics out the most), so of course it’s important that you lead your
child through it systematically and thoroughly. Luckily, teachers have taught
phonics for decades and figured out great strategies, so all you really have to
do is learn to recognize them and run through a few at home.
In this chapter, I explain how you can make sure your child gets the struc-
tured, sequential instruction in phonics that experts recommend. I show you
how to give your child the scoop on single letters, make sure he’s friendly
with word families, help him with blends and digraphs, and get on top of
tricky vowel and consonant sounds.
You can help your child get a strong handle on letters and spelling with the
use of memorization, visualization, and rhyming tricks. Chapter 11 has the
full scoop. (For more tips about spelling, check out my book Teaching Kids 
to Spell For Dummies, published by Wiley.) To find out just how much your
child already knows, you can run him through the quick tests I provide in
Appendix A.
Emphasizing Single Letters
When you lead your dyslexic child through phonics, start by making sure he
knows the sound of each letter of the alphabet. If he knows the letter names

already, tell him to forget them for the time being and instead talk of “a” (like
in apple), “buh” (like in big) and “cuh” (like in cup). Once your child can sound
out a few consonants and the short sounds of the five vowels, he’s ready for
sliding them together into three-letter words (see the section “Building Three-
Letter Words in Word Families,” later in this chapter).
Cozying up with consonants
A great way to help your child learn the consonant sounds is to draw features
into each letter that turn it into a memorable individual character that behaves
in its own distinctive ways. Great idea, huh? I’d like to take all the credit for it,
but a few people have come up with this idea before me and produced whole
programs based around it. In Chapter 4, I give you details on Letterland and
Zoo-Phonics, two programs that you may want to buy bits and pieces of or at
least get ideas from. For more immediate ideas, here is a list of consonant-
learning activities teachers typically use.
 Teach your child only the “hard” sounds of the consonants c and g
(“cuh” and “guh”) to start with. See the section “Sounding out the soft-
ies,” later in this chapter, to get a few details about the soft “see” and
“jee” sounds that these letters also make.
 Focus on one letter a week and talk every day about things that start
with that letter, like milk, medicine, mud, melon, mops, moss, and mom.
 Get library books (from the picture books or first readers sections) that
focus on your letter and read them together, paying special attention to
your letter sound. If the letter is written on the pages, point it out to
your child and, if it’s written big enough, have him trace over it with his
finger while saying the sound (like “mmmuh”).
 Make posters adorned with pictures or magazine cutouts of items that
start with your letter. Say each picture’s name.
 Eat foods whose names start with your letter and make the letter out 
of breadsticks, pasta, chocolate sauce, and anything else that can be
arranged or squeezed into shape. Say the sound as you go.
 Draw the letter for your child to trace over and glue things onto. Finger-
paint your letter and have your child draw over your letter in rainbow
colors. Draw the letter in chalk on your sidewalk. Make the letter’s sound.
 Sing songs and listen to alphabet tapes and CD-ROMS.
Multisensory learning, which I talk more about in Chapter 14, is a great way
for your dyslexic child to learn. In fact, just about anyone who knows any-
thing about dyslexia says that multisensory learning is the very best way for
a dyslexic child to go. When your child sees a letter, says it, and traces it, he’s
180
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

engaging in multisensory learning — he’s using a few senses at pretty much the
same time, so information comes to him from different angles and therefore
sticks in his memory better. That’s why I’m always encouraging you to have
your child say the sound out loud when he sees or draws a letter or an object
whose name begins with that letter.
Taking a long look at short vowels
Vowels are especially important because there’s a vowel in almost every word
(the exceptions being words like my that have y in them, making a vowel
sound — in this case, long i). Since all vowels make at least two sounds,
they’re especially tricky to learn.
When your child learns the vowel sounds, start by teaching him only the
short sounds: a like in apple, e like in egg, i like in ink, o like in octopus, u like
in up. He learns the long vowel sounds (like in ape, eagle, ice, open, and uni-
form) later, along with other vowel combinations like er and ei. (Check out
the section “Opening up to long vowels,” later in this chapter, for details.)
Show your child the vowel sounds by going through the routines I describe in
the earlier section on consonants. For children younger than about grade 2,
you can also add this next game to your repertoire of activities. It’s fun, so
your child will want to play, and the more practice he gets with vowels, the
better. Here’s how to prepare and play the game:
1. Cut up a sheet (or two) of paper into 20 pieces, each about 1 x 2 inches
in size.
2. Write a vowel on each card (a mixed bunch of vowels), leaving four
cards blank.
3. Draw a smiley face on each of these blanks.
4. Have your child hold the cards in a face-down pack and overturn
them, one at a time, telling you each letter sound as he turns it over.
5. If he turns over a smiley face, he claps three times and runs to the
door and knocks on it.
You can make the smiley face mean any kind of action, depending on the
age of your child and the available space.
Before you start this game with your child, he can pencil drawings (like an
apple in the a, an egg inside the e, an ink spot for the dot on the i, an octopus
in the o, and arrows on top of the vertical lines of the u to signify “up”) into
the letters if it helps him recall the sounds.
181
Chapter 12: Playing with Phonics

Introducing letters by name
What about letter names? Your dyslexic child has probably watched a few
episodes of Sesame Street or other TV shows for preschoolers and young chil-
dren, and that’s good. These shows are jam-packed with instructions about
the alphabet, so chances are your child has learned the names of one or two
letters from them. Songs are another great way of getting letter names into
your child’s memory. Have your child sing the ABC song as often as you can
stand so that the rhythm and sheer fun make letters stick in his mind.
The ABC song is the one you hear all over the place. Your child sings the
letter names to the tune of “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.” Because they’re
catchy, songs, more than just about any other activity, help your child learn
the letter names.
It’s great if your child knows the letter names early on, but it’s much more
important for him to learn the letter sounds. After he establishes a firm grip
on letter sounds and can read words like sat and flat, that are made of single
letter sounds joined together, then he can take a look at letter names. You can
show him that in words like ape and eve the long vowel sound is the same
thing as the vowel name. Ta-da, vowel names now become relevant! (And he’s
probably learned the other letter names along the way anyway.)
Building Three-Letter Words 
in Word Families
The first words your child sounds out by himself are usually short-vowel,
phonetically regular words like hat, hen, hit, hot, and hut that sound out just
the way your child expects them to. But how do you help him move smoothly
from single letter sounds (“a,” “buh,” “cuh”) to reading these complete words?
By starting with the word at and building up from there.
You can start your child off with it or ot if you want, but at is best because it’s
easy to pronounce, it’s a word in itself, and from it your child can build a lot
more new words.
Good readers read words in chunks. They get to know common chunks like at
and read them quickly without laboring over each single letter’s sound. That’s
why teaching your child to read chunks like at, an, and in very early on is a
terrific reading strategy.
In the following sections, I show you how to start your child off with the word
at and from it build the at word family (at, sat, fat, mat, and bat). Then I give
you a few more word families for extra practice.
182
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

A word family is a group of words that follow a spelling and sound pattern.
Using word families early on is a great idea because it’s easier for your child to
recall a group of words that share a pattern than it is for him to recall each
word separately and without the pattern-cue. There are plenty of families (like
fight, light, tight, and sight; round, sound, pound, and found) for him to learn.
Putting together “at”
The best way for your dyslexic child to read at is to physically discover for
himself, by sliding letter cards (or tiles) together, how a and t can be joined.
Find a quiet time to do the activity that I give next and spend a few minutes
on it until your child feels comfortable with at.
In the following game, by sliding a and saying its name, and then sliding on t
and saying its name, your child is doing a multisensory activity. I talk at length
about multisensory learning in Chapter 14.
Take an index card and cut it in half. Write a on one half of the card and t on
the other (calling them “ah” and “tuh”) and give them to your child. Now
here’s what to do:
1. Have him tell you their sounds.
2. Ask him to put down the a (pronounced like in apple) and slide tuh
next to it, saying each sound as he moves it.
3. Have him do this a few times until he hears the word at and gets the
very core of reading — that letters represent the sounds that join
together to make words.
When you make the letter cards in this activity, use lowercase letters. In school,
your child is taught that capitals are only for names and the beginnings of
sentences, so you help him by sticking to those rules at home.
Moving on up with “bat,” 
“cat,” “fat,” and more
After your child is well acquainted with at, he’s ready to meet members of the
whole at word family. The next activity shows you how to have your child build
the eight words — bat, cat, fat, hat, mat, pat, rat, and sat — by joining letters
onto at.
Have at written on one whole index card. Cut four other index cards in half
and write the single letters b, c, f, h, m, p, r, and s, one on each of the eight
halves of card. Give all the cards to your child and ask him to put at down in
183
Chapter 12: Playing with Phonics

front of him. Have him slide each single letter in front of at and read the
words he makes.
Now is a great time to have your child make a set of flashcards. Have him
write each of the at words (bat, cat, fat, hat, mat, pat, rat, and sat) on a sepa-
rate index card and read them to defenseless family members and friends.
Running through additional word families
In Table 12-1 you get more word families, so your child can practice the same
activities he just did in the previous sections (with at words) on a whole new
bunch of words. Show your child the chunks an, ap, ug, in, and ip and then let
him read you the words. He’ll start feeling like this reading thing isn’t so bad
after all!

Mixing It Up with Blended Consonants
After your child reads words like cat and fat, he’s ready to read consonant
blends like st, str, and bl in phonetically regular words like stand, strap, and
blink.
The term blending describes how your child blends letters (like a and t)
together to read whole words (like at), but the consonant blends I’m talking
about here are chunks of two or three consonants, like st and str.
184
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

In the following sections, I cover blended consonants at the start and at the
end of words.
Blends at the beginning
By the time your child has mastered the easier words in Table 12-1 he’s prob-
ably eager to flex his newly developing reading muscles. Table 12-2 gives him
words that look impressive but are in fact fairly easy to sound out. Initially,
your child needs to say and hear the blend in the first column, but that done,
he can whiz through the words in the second column. Your child may want 
to read the table in two or three separate sessions, but if not, he can blast
through them all in one go. Whichever of these options you take, you need to
do plenty of re-reads. An easy routine to use for this and other tables is to
choose whether to use all the table or just a few rows and then have your
child do the following:
 Read out the table words top to bottom.
 Read out the table words bottom to top.
 Read out random words as you point to them.
 Find words that you call out.
 Write ten words that you dictate.
Words like draft, crisp, and trend can be particularly challenging for your child
at first because they have double blends (at the beginning and end). You may
want to write them out larger for your child so he can underline each blend
before tackling them.

Blends at the end
Your child can get to grips with blends at the ends of words in the same ways
that he can master blends at the beginning, except that a couple of ending
blends may need special attention. Walk your child through Table 12-3, taking
extra care over words ending in nk and ng. Sometimes these blends can be
harder to distinguish than other blends. If your child needs extra practice,
grab paper or a whiteboard and have him write the relevant words, underlin-
ing the blends. Reading these words is easier for him when tricky letters are
highlighted so he can give them extra thought.

Delving into Digraphs
Earlier in this chapter I tell you that your child needs to know chunks of
speech sounds and how those chunks are written, or in other words, phon-
ics. I say that he needs to move forward systematically so that he first learns
simple words like hat and then harder words like last.
But here’s the thing. When your child looks at books, he finds that all sorts 
of easy and hard words are in there together. How do you help him deal with
that? Pretty much at the same time as you lead him from easy to harder word
families, you show him (a few at a time) new sounds, like ch, sh, and th. These
sounds are called digraphs.
A digraph is a sound/spelling chunk made by two letters that join to make their
own distinctive sound (that’s not like their two individual sounds blended
together). The consonant digraphs are ch, sh, th, and ph, and wh can be con-
sidered a digraph, too.
In Table 12-4 is a bunch of easy ch, sh, and th words for you to launch your
child straight into. Your child needs to be comfortable with ph and wh, but I
focus on the other consonant digraphs (ch, sh, and th) because ch, sh, and th
words are much more common.
187
Chapter 12: Playing with Phonics

Move through the table, having your child read and say the words, and write
some as you dictate them; then for variety, read out the next quiz questions
and ask your child to write the answers.
1. A turtle and a crab both have this (shell)
2. A board game with a castle, a queen, and a knight in it (chess)
3. Another name for a talk (chat)
4. The bottom front part of your leg (shin)
5. A baby chicken (chick)
6. The part of your face below your mouth (chin)

Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

You may want to tell your child that th has two sounds: one for words like
thank and thin and one for words like this and then.
A number of sight words (words that are so common that they should be
learned to a level of automatic recognition) include digraphs and may be a little
tricky for your dyslexic child to sound out. However, it’s really worth it for your
child to memorize sight words because they’re used so often in the English lan-
guage. For tips on committing sight words to memory, see Chapter 11.
Mastering Tricky Vowel Sounds
Vowels represent two sounds, called short and long sounds, and can join
together with other letters to make a few more sounds besides. Short vowel
sounds are the vowel sounds you hear in apple, egg, ink, octopus, and up; long
vowel sounds are the sounds you hear in ape, eve, ice, open, and uniform. Long
vowel sounds are also the sounds you hear when you say the letter names.
In this section I show you the different ways that long vowels are written and
the simple rules that help your child recognize them. I show you how the
letter y can take the place of a vowel in words like my and by. Finally I show
you how vowels can appear next to other letters to make special new sounds
that can trip up a dyslexic child if he’s not primed to watch out for them.
Opening up to long vowels
Your child needs to hear the different vowel sounds in words like met and
meet so she can read and spell them for herself. A gazillion words (like meet,
pain, road, and cute) have long vowel sounds in them, but luckily two easy
phonics rules apply to most of these.
In Chapter 11, I give you the complete ins and outs of the Bossy e and when-
two-vowels-go-walking rules, but here’s a lightning summary:
 To help your child read and spell words such as bake, like, and cute,
show him the Bossy e rule. When Bossy e sits on the end of short words,
such as cut, or word chunks, such as bak, it bosses the vowel into
making its long sound. Cut becomes cute, and bak becomes bake.
 To help your child read and spell words like meet, road, and rain, show
him the rule that says “when two vowels go walking, the first one does
the talking.” When he sees the vowel pairs ee, ea, oa, and ai, they nearly
always work as a partnership in which the first vowel shouts its name
while the second stays silent.
189
Chapter 12: Playing with Phonics

Hearing “y” sound like a vowel
One special letter you’ll want to point out to your child is y. In words such 
as yellow and yam, y makes its simple alphabet sound, but in words such as
merry, mystery, and my, it makes the sounds usually made by long e, and
short and long i.
The tables in the following sections give you easy words for practicing the y
sounds. Have your child read through them, saying, hearing, and seeing how
y can make long and short e and i sounds.
When “y” acts like a long “e”
On the ends of words with more than one syllable, y usually sounds like long
e. Table 12-5 gives example words that your child can easily read so that this
long e pattern becomes clear. Have your child highlight the y in each word,
saying the “ee” sound as he goes, and then have him mark and say other long
vowels, in creepy, bravely, breezily, and really. Lastly, have him read out the
words, choosing his own order. He can read columns or rows until he has
read all 40 words or he can save some words for another time.
Your dyslexic child can easily become tired or disheartened, so gauge the
amount of work he does, and the time he takes, to make sure he stays moti-
vated and on track. It’s better to have your dyslexic child work slowly on
tasks and repeat them so he gets a firm understanding than it is to let him
move forward more quickly but less surely. He needs frequent short breaks,
too, so he can concentrate better after he’s refreshed (just like the rest of us).

When “y” acts like a short “i”
The letter y turns up in the middle (or near the middle) of quite a few words.
Tell your child to watch out for this. It means that an i sound, short or long
190
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

but more often short, is being made. The best way for your child to work out
what sound y is making is to try out the short i sound first. Table 12-6 gives
you some words to get started on. Have your child mark each y in the words
and then figure out whether the y is on the end (in which case a long “ee”
sound is made), or in the middle (in which case the sound is short or long i).
When y comes after c or g, it makes those letters make their soft (“ss” and “juh”)

When “y” acts like a long “i”
In a few short one-syllable words, y, when it’s the last letter in the word, sounds
like long i. Table 12-7 gives you this small group of fairly common words so
your child can whiz through them a few times and mentally file them under
“got it!”

why
Teaching your child spelling patterns can be an ongoing process. If your child
gets quickly on top of the words in Table 12-7, you may want to show him
another bunch of words that have the same “y acting like long i” pattern, only
with the y in the middle (not the end) of the word. Longer words like style,
type, and python fit into this group, and so do the words cycle and cyclone.
The rule for “cy” words is that when c is followed by y, it makes its soft sound
(“s”), while the y can make either a long i sound (like in cyclist) or a short i
sound (like in cyst). How should your child remember words like style, type,
and python? By taking a good look at them, saying them out loud, and jotting
them down a few times. There are no hard and fast rules for spelling them, but
bunching them together (in the “y acting as short or long i” word family) helps.
191
Chapter 12: Playing with Phonics

A strategy that can help your child remember a group of words like style, type,
and python is to keep a personal dictionary. Your child writes groups of words
in it, adding new group members (like dynamite, typhoon, and hype) as he
comes across them.
Surveying schwa vowels
When your child says words like ago and around, he pronounces the first a as
“uh.” This “uh” sound is called a schwa, and you need to tell your child about
it so that he doesn’t spell the words ugo and uround. You don’t have to men-
tion the technical schwa stuff though; just say that sometimes the letter a has
an indistinct “uh” sound.
Schwa is technically an unstressed vowel sound. It’s easiest to hear in the
vowel a (like in ago, again, above, and about), but other vowels can be schwa
sounds, too (like the o in melon). Because this is a tricky concept, and an
even trickier thing to hear, especially because your dialect affects your pro-
nunciation (and stressing) of vowels, I don’t go into it too deeply. Your child
learns about schwa better in context (and without mention of the technical
term schwa) than in a theoretical explanation.
The best way for your child to read these fuzzy sounds is to pronounce them
phonetically and then correct himself (“a-go,” uh-oh, that’s really “uhgo”).
One good tip though: The names of many countries end with a schwa, includ-
ing Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, China, Cuba, Uganda, and Venezuela.
Names of many U.S. states end with a schwa, too, including Arizona, California,
Georgia, and Pennsylvania.
Singling out sound-alike 
chunks featuring vowels
Reading teachers show your child plenty of sound/spelling chunks. In the fol-
lowing sections, I give you spelling chunks that any teacher worth his salt
shows to his students so they can push forward with harder, livelier text. Here
you get the tricky, but well-worth-knowing, chunks oy/oi, ow/ou, and aw/au.
Take your time showing them to your child and coming up with words of your
own that follow each spelling pattern.
Practice one spelling (like oy) of each sound with your child before telling
him about the second spelling (like oi). He needs a lot of exposure to one
spelling before he can comfortably assimilate the other spelling or he gets
overwhelmed.
192
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

The best way to turn your child off reading and make him think he’ll never get
this nut cracked is to overload him. Anytime you show him a new spelling
chunk, like oy, take a slow and sure approach. Have him read, say, and write
plenty of words that fit the spelling pattern, such as boy, toy, coy, joy, and soy.
Then when he’s really sure of that spelling, slowly introduce a new one, like oi.
Oy and oi
In Table 12-8, I give you some oy and oi words for your child to sink his teeth
into. Make a copy and have your child highlight (or circle or underline) the
oy or oi part of each word, saying the sound as he goes. Point out that oy
shows up on the ends of words (like in toy) or at the end of the first syllable
of a word (like in royal), whereas oi features at the beginning or middle of
words (like in oil and soil). After your child has marked the words and is com-
fortable with the positioning of the two different spellings, have him read the
words in the table out loud to you and then dictate them for him to write.
Warn him of other special spelling features if you want, like the s in noise
(sounds like z but is spelled with s), the two n’s in annoy and the al in royal
(it sounds like it could be al or le, or even another combination a dyslexic
might use, like el, ul, or il).

Ow and ou
The ou sound is my favorite. Show it to your child by explaining that when-
ever he sees either ow, like in cow, or ou, like in out, he needs to make the
sound he would make if you pinched him. After that, have him highlight the
digraphs (ow and ou) in Table 12-9 while he makes the sound, and then have
him read the words to you. Then he can write a few you dictate to him. Ways
to prompt him along include the following:
193
Chapter 12: Playing with Phonics

 Give him several soft and timely pinches when he reads ow and ou!
 Have him jot down the two versions of a word (like brown and broun)
when he’s spelling them, to see if he can spot the right one.
 Tell him which digraph to use when he’s struggling to spell a word.
 Have him draw his own two-column table and randomly dictate words
from Table 12-9 for him to fit into it.

Aw and au
The digraphs aw and au are pretty tricky, so here’s what you can do to show
them to your child in a slow and sure way:
 Show your child the aw spellings first. He’s seen the word saw plenty of
times, so start with that. Have him write and say the word saw five times.
Now ask him to change the s in saw to an l.
 Have him change the s in saw to dr.
 Have him write the three words saw, law, and draw.
194
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

 When he’s happy with saw, law, and draw, show him the words in the aw
column of Table 12-10.
 Have him highlight the aw digraph in each word and then read the words
to you, top to bottom, bottom to top, and then randomly as you point a
pencil at a few words.
 Have him write the aw words as you dictate them.
 When your child has a firm understanding of aw, you can drop the bomb-
shell about there being another aw sound, spelled au, and repeat the same
procedure.

When your child comes across spellings like aunty that have a different au
sound, just explain that words often fall outside a rule. It doesn’t mean that
the rule isn’t useful; it’s just that there are some outsiders or rule breakers
they’ll have to get to know eventually.
195
Chapter 12: Playing with Phonics

Partnering vowels with “r”
If you’ve been skimming through these phonics tips up until now, this may be
a good time to slow down. Your child needs a firm grip on the vowel + r spelling
that I tell you about here because it crops up often and its sound is never the
straightforward blended sound of its two letters.
Quickly tell your child that a vowel + r spelling makes its own new sound and
then have him look at Table 12-11. Ask him to cover the first two columns and
look only at the last three columns, er, ir, and ur. When he reads a few words
(you can help him do this) from each column, what does he notice? Be sure
to have your child discover, or point out to him, that er, ir, and ur all sound
the same. Once your child appreciates the sound that these three digraphs
make, have him highlight the digraphs in each word, sounding them out as
he goes, and then read the words to you (top to bottom and so on like you
did in the previous sections). Have your child write the words out from your
dictation. If he gets stuck writing a word, have him jot down the possibilities
(like her, hir, or hur) to see whether he can spot the right-looking spelling.
If he can’t see the right one, tell him the spelling and have him jot it down a
few more times.

When you dictate a few words to your child, doing so helps him consolidate
what he’s already practiced. Your dyslexic child needs to read, say, and write
words he’s already gone over, so give him as much repetition as you can,
within reasonable boundaries of bribery and coercion!
196
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

After your child feels happy with er, ir, and ur words, you can show him the
or and ar columns of Table 12-11. Go through the reading, marking, and writing
routine that you did with the other columns and then, if you’re both feeling
creative and energetic, have your child jot all the words down on small pieces
of paper and spread them, face down, in front of him. Can he turn over and
read out loud all of the words? Can he spell each one if he turns each card over,
takes a quick peek, and then jots it down? Can he spell each one if you dictate
it and he doesn’t get to take a take a helpful peek? When your child is done
with the word cards, have him keep them. After a few days, have him run
through a shortened version of these activities to see how well he recalls all
the words. Keep any words that slipped through the net. Pin them on a wall
and have your child read them to you and jot them down a few more times
over the next week.
Lopping vowels off the ends of words
Like many children, your dyslexic child may have trouble reading and spelling
words like riding. Should he write rideing or riding, and how can he remember
in future?
The easy rule for sorting out ing words is drop the e (pronounced “ee”) when
you add i-n-g (pronounced “eye-en-gee”). Want practice with it? Check out
Table 12-12.

Chapter 12: Playing with Phonics
Terrific tips for handling any difficult words
As soon as your child starts to read, he comes
across words like they and was that don’t sound
out regularly. How can you help him with these
kinds of words? Where do you start? In addition
to the activities I provide in the rest of this chap-
ter, here are some general strategies that can
make those words seem easier.
 Notice the shape of the word. Draw an out-
line around the word to show tall and short
letters and the length of the whole word.
 Circle, or mark with a highlighter pen, 
the tricky parts of words. In words, for
example, the or is tricky (because it sounds
like “er”).
 Have your child tape words onto walls
where he will often see them. Bathrooms
and bedrooms are good.
 Run your child through the look, say, cover,
write routine: He looks at the word he wants
to learn, says it out loud, covers it over, and
writes it from memory.
 Use the word envelope routine I describe in
Chapter 11. Your child puts up to 10 words,
each one written on a small piece of paper,
in an envelope. Every day for a week he
takes them out of the envelope and plays
games that help him fix the words in his
memory with them.

Show your child how the e gets dropped. Dictate the base words (the ones
without the ing added on) for him to write down. If you need to revise the
“Bossy e” rule that all these words follow, flip to Chapter 11. Have your child
add the ing ending to his base words, saying the “Drop the e when you add 
i-n-g” rule as he goes.
Have your child verbalize what he’s doing because sounding out or saying
rules out loud is a helpful multisensory learning strategy. Seeing, saying, and
writing, just about together, is a more effective way to learn than any of those
three things done alone.

Bringing Consonants under Control
You need to show your child the quirky but common sounds that consonants
can make when they get together with certain other consonants or vowels.
Otherwise, stuff like the z sound that s makes on the end of friends, and the
soft sounds that c and g can make, may throw him into confusion. In the fol-
lowing sections, I deal with those spellings and others that can be similarly
troublesome.
Unmasking consonants in disguise
This is where I talk about innocent-looking letters that make sneaky little
sounds. Here you take a look at s sounding like z in words like dogs and find
out how to deal with the three sounds of ed. The ones you never even noticed
until now!
198
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

When “s” sounds like “z”
A single letter you may want to alert your child to is s. In words like friends,
hands, loves, and dogs, your child hears the sound of z but sees the letter s.
A quick heads up from you may save him from feeling that words are put
together pretty randomly.
In words like foxes, horses, and boxes, your child sees es, but actually hears a
sort of “iz” sound.
When your dyslexic child comes across a word that doesn’t follow the rule,
have him consider it a rogue, pretty much an all-by-itself word, or see whether
he can find a few other words like it and make it into a whole rogue word
family. For example, take the word friend. It doesn’t follow the usual ie pro-
nunciation, like in field, piece, and believe, and there aren’t several common
words like it, so it’s easiest to brand it as a loner renegade word to watch out
for. A word like love however, is a renegade, but not a loner. Show your child
that it breaks the usual “Bossy e” rule but does so in good company. Its word
family includes the words dove, glove, and above.
When “ed” sounds like “t” or “duh”
If your child hopped, skipped, and jumped, he did three things ending with the
“t” sound spelled as ed. Tell your child that the ed ending can sound like “ed”
as in chatted, “duh” like in smiled, or “tuh” like in hopped. And so that he gets
to see this for himself, have him read out loud the words in Table 12-13. As
usual, writing down the words as you dictate them helps him fix the words in
his mind, and reminding him to say the word as he writes it helps too.

Sounding out the softies
When your child learns that c and g make the soft sounds “see” and “jee,” he
may start switching between hard and soft sounds pretty erratically.
199
Chapter 12: Playing with Phonics

Here’s a rule that can help your child. Briefly explain it and then have him
read the words in Table 12-14 so he makes his own hands-on discovery. The
rule is, “Soft c and g are followed by i, y, or e,” as in city, cyst, and cent.
Here are some general help-him-with-reading tips:
 Break words into syllables. It doesn’t much matter whether your child
puts his break in exactly the right spot as long as he hears the distinctly
separate parts of a word. For example, the word city is made from the
two syllables — ci-ty — but your child might choose to break it up into
cit-y. The break that he puts for himself is probably the most useful to
him because he remembers his own creation better than someone else’s.
 Highlight tricky parts. In the word peace, for example, your child might
highlight ea and/or ce (because ea and ce are next to each other, he might
mark them in different colors, or circle one and underline the other).
 Look for spelling rules, like “Bossy e” and “When two vowels go walking,
the first one does the talking,” and in this case, of course, “Soft c and g
are followed by i, y, or e.”
Here are some general help-him-with-writing tips:
 Sound out the word (out loud, not just in your head), from beginning to
end, and in syllables if your word has more than one syllable.
 Jot down possible spellings of a sound (like ase, ayse, ayce, or ace)
before you commit to one.
 Encourage your child to jot down the spelling possibilities he thinks of
even if you know some of them are impossible. His own discoveries stick
better in his mind than your instructions, and the more spelling discov-
eries he makes, the better he gets at making future spelling guesses.
 Exaggerate pronunciation if it helps. For example, you can pronounce
the word bandage as “band-age,” not the usual “band-ige” of normal
people-talk.
 Listen for short and long vowel sounds so you can use spelling rules
(“Bossy e” and “When two vowels go walking the first one does the 
talking”).

Spotting the silent types
Silent letters are a challenge for just about everyone, but for your dyslexic
child, they may be especially tricky. To help your child remember where these
letters pop up, have him read through Table 12-15 and try these strategies:
 Get the right spelling of these words by pronouncing the silent letters.
(For example, it’s okay for your child to say “k-nife” every time he spells
knife, until after plenty of this overpronouncing, he remembers the
spelling without the weird talk!)
 Remember words with silent letters like balm, calm, and palm in their
families (see the section “Building Three-Letter Words in Word Families,”
earlier in this chapter, for details about this concept).
 Devise mnemonics (such as “I get hot toes”) for remembering letter
combinations like ight.
 Sound out the parts of words that can be sounded out and highlight other
silent (or otherwise tricky) parts so you remember the look of them.

Doubling up
When I was a child, I had a lot of trouble spelling written and writing. Should
I use one t or two? Then I learned the rule that I’m about to give you now
(and I got a computer spell checker for all the other words I can’t spell!).
Here’s the rule that helps me with written and writing and can help your child
with words like pinned and pined, hopped and hoped, bitten and biting. When
your child reads or writes a short word with an ending added onto it (like
written and bitten), the rule is “double the letter to keep the vowel short.” The
double letter in words like pinned and hopped prevents you from mistakenly
musing about things you pined and hoped for (like sweethearts or chocolate).
Make a copy of the words in Table 12-16 and have your child read them out
loud to you. Let him use his pen to identify the double letters, and after he’s
marked them all, dictate several for him to write. Have him say each word out
loud as he writes it so he hears that short sound.
The “double the letter to keep the vowel short” rule works on short words
like hop and longer words like drip that have a blend (in this case dr) at the
front. But if there’s a blend at the end of a short word (like in sing), forget this
rule. It doesn’t work on blend-at-the-end words or on blend-on-both-ends
words, like stamp.

 Finding out what good readers do

 Following proven steps to reading success
 Dealing gently with your child’s problems
W
hen you read out loud to your child, she’s a picture of happiness, but
when you ask her to read out loud to you, she dissolves into tears.
That’s the way it is for kids who have dyslexia. This chapter shows you what
your child must learn in order to be a good reader, how you can help her get
those skills under her belt with a reading routine, and which reading strate-
gies really work. I also show you how to gently but effectively handle your
child’s reading errors and difficulties.
See Jane Read: Looking at Reading
Fundamentals
You can read an awful lot of theory about how kids learn to read if you want
to, or you can take it from me (someone who has read a stack of theory and
spent over 20 years helping kids read): In order to read, your child needs to
do the following:
 Automatically recognize the most common words, or sight words, like
the, was, and they (because these words crop up so often).
 Be able to sound out or have phonics under control. “But the English
language is so irregular,” I hear you say. Ah yes, some words definitely

defy sounding out, but more than half, and some people say almost all,
can be sounded out as long as you know which letters, and clusters of
letters, make which sounds. Phonics means matching written letters, and
groups of letters, to their corresponding sounds.
 Get a lot of reading practice by having someone (that’s you!) help her
read books that are at the right level for her. (Too hard is overwhelming,
and too easy is dull.) This reading practice shows your child that all the
work she does on sight words and phonics leads to a great end, gives
her on-the-job practice of sight words and phonics (rather than learning
through isolated practice tasks), and improves her comprehension (the
fancy word for understanding). The more reading she does, the more
familiar she becomes with typical plot elements, style, and grammar, and
if she talks text over with you, even better.
An acronym I use to remember these three reading essentials is SPRint. Help
your child regularly and systematically with the following:
 Sight words
 Phonics
 Reading practice
If you do, you’ll see her SPRint forward! And that, in a nutshell, is what you
need to know about how basic word reading works. I could talk about gram-
mar, tenses, and punctuation if you like, but I’m guessing that if you wanted
that extra jazz, you’d have picked up a book about English usage.
In the rest of this chapter, I discuss the reading (or R) part of SPRint. Before
that, though, I give you the basics on sight words, a lightning rundown of
sounding out, and a quick explanation of what “comprehension” means in the
following sections.
Being quick to recognize sight words
Your dyslexic child won’t be able to read fluently without having instant or
“sight” recognition of sight words because these words are so common that
220 of them comprise about 70 percent of all text. Did I just say “all text”?
That’s right. Pick up a regular book, comic, or flyer, and you see sight words
all through it.
In Chapter 11, I give you the list of 220 sight words and a bunch of nifty ways
to help your child get the instant recognition she needs.
206
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Feeling good about phonics
When your child learns phonics, she learns how letters and bunches of letters
represent the sounds inside words. She starts off by learning single letter
sounds, like “a” (as in “apple”), “buh,” and “cuh”; progresses to sounds like
“st,” “cl,” and “ch”; and much farther down the line, learns about tricky
sounds like “ough.” Particularly for struggling dyslexic readers, mastery of
phonics is, well, huge!
Most people use the words phonetic, phonological, and phonemic interchange-
ably to mean sounding out. You may encounter the odd person (and you 
can interpret “odd” any way you like here) who tells you I’m oversimplifying, 
but we could both be here a long and fairly boring time if I got into the fine
distinctions.
Phonics means matching written letters, and groups of letters, to their corre-
sponding sounds. It’s been around a long time, and teachers know how to do it
well. They know that structured and sequential phonics instruction is best and
that learning letter-sound associations is easier when you group them in word
families or bunches of words that all have the same chunk of sound in them.
In practical terms you need to teach your child the following things, in
roughly this order:
 Each single letter represents a sound and sometimes more than one
sound.
 Vowels always represent at least two sounds (usually called short and
long sounds).
 Every word has a vowel, but y can take the place of a vowel and be a 
pretend vowel (like in my and by).
 You need to know all the common sound-chunks, like “ch,” “ea,” and “ow.”
 The best way to remember sound-chunks is to put them into word fami-
lies, like pain, rain, drain, and brain.
Check out Chapter 12 for more details on dealing with phonics.
Understanding about comprehension
If you worry that your child reads and then has no idea what she’s just read,
this section, all about comprehension, is for you.
207
Chapter 13: Sprinting Ahead with Reading Basics and Practice

Comprehension means understanding. If your child comprehends something,
she gets it. Whatever she reads, she gets the point and understands who did
what and why. If she doesn’t have good comprehension, she just doesn’t get
it, can’t remember who did what, and hasn’t a hope of fathoming why.
Things that cause or signify lack of comprehension include the following:
 Your child reads so slowly that she loses the point along the way. By 
the time she gets to the end of the text, she’s forgotten what the begin-
ning was.
 Your child makes so many mistakes that the meaning of the text is mud-
dled or lost on her.
 Your child doesn’t care what the text says. It’s boring.
 Your child has trouble remembering names and keeping a sequence of
events in its right order.
 Your child doesn’t know some of the vocabulary in the text. She may
have missed or struggled with so much reading in class that she never
got the chance to read and reread new vocabulary.
 Your child misunderstands the inferences and unstated parts of a text.
She grasps only the concrete, openly stated parts, so things like implied
jealousy, love, or scheming are lost on her.
You can take the following steps to improve your child’s reading 
comprehension:
 Bring your child’s recognition of sight words and phonics skills up to par
so she reads more fluently. (I cover this in Chapters 11 and 12.)
 Listen to your child read manageable and fun text often.
 Help your child figure out words by starting at the beginning and moving
forward, chunk by chunk. Children often misread words because they
focus on just one chunk of a word and then guess the rest.
Technically the chunks I talk about are syllables, digraphs, phonemes,
and morphemes.
• A syllable is a word-chunk that has a vowel in it (or vowel equiva-
lent like the y in the single-syllable word my).
• A digraph is two or more letters that together make a common
word chunk, such as ai, oa, ch, and ing.
• A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound in a word, such that it can
be just one letter, like in c-a-t.
• A morpheme is the minimum meaningful element in a word, so it
includes suffixes like tion that make act mean something different
from action.
208
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

There can be overlap with these classifications; for example, action is
made both of two syllables and two morphemes. Your child gets to know
all the chunks inside words, no matter what you call them, through say-
ing, reading, and writing them a lot.
 Aim to read often. Let your child read material she wants to read, includ-
ing comics and joke books, so that she reads more often and gets the
practice she needs. It’s better for your child to willingly read three easy
books than for her to struggle through one harder book and become dis-
heartened and angry. See the section “Choosing the right books,” later in
this chapter, for more about selecting great reading material.
 Teach your child to distinguish between main and secondary points in 
a text. To help her with this task, have her jot down words as she reads
so she ends up with a list of words that roughly describes what she’s
reading.
 Encourage your child to draw diagrams of the book’s plot and jot down
the names of key characters.
 Read some of your child’s homework to her (otherwise, she can’t get
through it all) and explain new vocabulary. Ask her to use new words in
context so she remembers them. Older children who don’t read as much
as classmates can fall a long way behind with subject-specific vocabu-
lary. I cover teen dyslexia issues in more detail in Chapter 16.
 Talk about what’s happening in stories and fiction and ask your child
questions about the plot. What’s openly said and what’s implied? What
feelings, motives, and undercurrents can you detect? Could the reader
face surprises up ahead?
In the Habit: Establishing 
a Happy Reading Routine
You should regularly read with your child. Did I forget that you have other
obligations (such as meal preparation, a job, and a mammoth pile of laun-
dry)? No, but the thing is, I’m compelled to drive you. I have to push the
issue of reading with your child (every day, no rain checks) because right
now, this very day, is the best time to help your child.
The sooner and more often you help your child read, the easier it is on both
of you. Older kids and adults have more catching up to do because all through
school they’ve missed years of reading. The sooner you help your child and
the more help you give her, the better. I cover specific techniques that you
can use in the next section.
209
Chapter 13: Sprinting Ahead with Reading Basics and Practice

Older kids and adults who are dyslexic can always learn to read. It takes a lot
of time and effort, but the feeling of accomplishment is big, too! Don’t be set
back by feeling guilty that you didn’t help your child sooner or never learned
to read yourself; instead, establish a manageable routine of learning a reper-
toire of sight words and phonics and doing some daily reading. Reading out
loud is a useful strategy for any age because the act of looking at words and
saying them out loud helps you get the multisensory learning that works
best. Find out more about multisensory methods in Chapter 14.
What kind of things can ease your way on the path to reading regularly with
your child? Here are some practical tips to help your child enjoy reading and
help you save time and energy (yours, that is — I won’t be asking you to turn
off the heat or lights).
 Choose books that your child wants rather than books you think she
should read. Comics are fine, and so are joke books or any other kind of
book with short blasts of print. Get plenty of easy books rather than one
book that’s too hard, which is likely to turn your child off. See the sec-
tion “Choosing the right books,” later in this chapter, to get started.
 Set a regular time for reading, ideally 20 minutes each day, and stick to
it. Bedtime suits most families, but some early birds like to read at the
breakfast table.
 If you occasionally miss out on a day of reading, it’s okay, but don’t let
those times sneak up on you until you miss more sessions than you make.
 Have a record-keeping system. Your child likes to know how she’s doing.
Just like everyone else, she feels good when she knows she’s making
progress and has checked a few things off her list. Help her keep a record
of the books she reads, something like the one in Figure 13-1.
The chart you use to record books read should include columns with:
• The name of the book
• Categories for bad, average, and good books — just mark the
column that applies to a given book
• The date that your child finished the book
 Establish a reward system. A good reason for rewarding your child is
that she’s doing something she wasn’t keen on in the first place, and
another reason for rewarding her is that she likes rewards!
But maybe rewarding isn’t for you. Older kids can be all rewarded-out,
and besides, you may want to stick with intrinsic rewards. The fact that
your child gets through those books can be reward in itself.
Whether you give extrinsic rewards (like extra TV, extra play, or a later
bedtime on weekends) or not, always give your child your attention. A
simple smile, hug, or “good job” sometimes may work better than all the
other hoopla.
210
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Another way to help encourage your child to look forward to reading as a
pleasurable activity and want to make it part of her daily routine is to let her
see that you and your spouse are avid readers. In that way, you model read-
ing for your child, and she has even more incentive to head to the bookshelf.
Page after Page: Using Special
Strategies for Reading Success
You want your child to read interesting and fun books early on so she can see
what all the fuss is about and feels motivated to keep going. But even with
the best intentions, many parents find great ways to switch their child right
off reading! They ask their children to read books that are too hard for them
or don’t manage to get into a happy reading-out-loud routine. In the following
sections, I show you how to select the best books for your child, and I pro-
vide you with some proven reading strategies.
You can very easily turn your child off when it comes to reading with just a few
impatient words at the wrong time. So no losing your patience, heavy sighing,
or saying things like “You just saw that word already!” If you feel your patience
being tested, take a break, change books (this one may be too hard), and refo-
cus (remind yourself that everyone learns by making mistakes). See the section
“Nice and Gentle: Handling Your Child’s Difficulties with Kindness,” later in this
chapter, for more tips.

Chapter 13: Sprinting Ahead with Reading Basics and Practice

Your child may tell you that reading is boring, stupid, or just not for her. Don’t
believe her. Not everyone loves reading, of course, but everyone at least wants
to be able to do it. It’s normal for struggling dyslexic readers to pretend they
don’t want to read; otherwise, they’d have to admit that they can’t read and
that’s too crushing. Let her whining wash over you, and persevere. With care-
fully chosen books, sensitivity, and commitment, you can help your child (no
matter what age) make progress.
I’m not the only one who makes a big deal out of reading out loud. The 2002
“Teaching Children to Read Report” (U.S. government funded and involving
years of study and heaps of experts) states that guided reading out loud is
one of the most effective strategies you can use to help your child read
better. And you don’t get a much higher source than the government and all
its experts!
Choosing the right books
To make sure that your child can read out loud to you smoothly and with 
just a few errors, you need to carefully choose the books she reads. She can
choose her own books for browsing later on, but you need to select her first
reading-all-by-herself books. To achieve the perfect choice, forget about levels
and about titles with “beginner” in them (I see plenty of so-called beginner
books with words that are too hard in them) and look instead for books that
are phonetically controlled and/or pass the one-hand rule (which I explain
later in this section).
Phonetically controlled books have titles like Fat Cat and Jake and the Snake
and follow two guidelines:
 They are written with a phonetic rule in mind, like using short a, and use
mostly words that follow that rule (“a fat cat sat on a mat”).
 Other words that they use are either words your child learned in earlier
books in the series or newly introduced words that the author lists
in the front or back pages (only a few new words are introduced in
each book).
With phonetically controlled books, you know what you’re getting. You won’t
find words like “enough” and “furious” thrown in with “cat” and “fat,” so you
won’t have to wonder what on earth to do about it. When reading these books,
you show your child the new words (listed at the front or back), remind her
about the phonetic rule (short a), and off you go. (Check out Chapter 12 for
more about phonics.) Ta-da, your child can read the book pretty much all by
herself, and everyone’s happy.
212
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

My shelves are stocked with series of phonetically controlled books, and I
wouldn’t dream of helping a struggling reader without using them. They work.
Even if you think to yourself that they’re boring, your child won’t think that
way. She wants to read by herself, and these kinds of books do the trick.
Leveled books and books with controlled vocabulary aren’t the same thing as
phonetically controlled books.
 Leveling, or controlling the vocabulary in a book, means that a book is
classified (usually as Level 1, 2, 3 or A, B, C) by degree of difficulty based
on how many hard words are in it. The hard words are selected and
counted by using one of several methods (like Reading Recovery or
Guided Reading) that ask things like whether a word is easy to spell and
whether its meaning is clear.
 Phonetically controlled books are classified by difficulty, too, but the
classification is according to the phonological difficulty of the words in
the book.
What this all means in practice is that a leveled or controlled vocabulary
book can have mixed text in it with all kinds of spellings, as long as they’re
within the level. A phonetically controlled book sticks to a phonics rule or
two, so its content is repetitive; for example, all the words may be from the at
word family, with only two or three other words, like the and was.
Flip through the pages of a book before buying. The best books for beginners
are phonetically controlled books that list new words that are hard to sound
out (like the, was, and who) before or after the main text. You can walk your
child through the list of new words and avoid nasty surprises in the middle of
reading, and all other words sound out in a predictable way.
Your child’s comfort level for reading any book is when only 5 percent of
what she reads (5 words in every 100) poses a challenge. To find this just-
right text, give your child a page of 100 words to read (or a few pages that
together make up 100 words) and tell her to close one finger on the same
hand every time she reaches a word she doesn’t know. If she runs out of 
fingers on one hand before she finishes the words, the book is too hard.
That’s the “one-hand rule.”
To find series of phonetically controlled books, head to your library or ask at
school. If you want to buy, check out these series (roughly in order from easy
to more advanced):
 Bob Books: Published by Scholastic. Small books in a box, 12 books per
boxed set. There are three levels — A, B, and C — and more than one
box set per level. Available everywhere in the United States and Canada.
Find out more at www.bobbooks.com.
213
Chapter 13: Sprinting Ahead with Reading Basics and Practice

 Primary Phonics: Published by Educators Publishing Service. In this
series, you get five sets of books with ten books per set. View and buy the
books at www.epsbooks.com or phone 800-435-7728 or 617-547-6706.
 The Alphabet Series: Published by Educators Publishing Service. In this
series, you get two volumes with eighteen books per set. View and buy the
books at www.epsbooks.com or phone 800-435-7728 or 617-547-6706.
 Fitzroy Readers: Distributed by Fitzroy Programs. If you want something
your child has never seen before (unless you live in Australia) and won’t
feel embarrassed using, look at this series. Written by teachers in an
Australian alternative school, these books come in boxed sets and are
easy to buy online. Check them out at www.fitzprog.com.au.
 Read with Ladybird: “Ladybird” makes a great book series, but my
favorite is the Ladybird Learning to Read series. You get small hardback
books with short stories (children often like these better than long sto-
ries) that are perfect after your child has easier books, like Level A Bob
Books, under her belt and needs slightly harder books. Originally a
British product (watch out for words like “mum” and “trousers,” which
means pants), you can now get these books online wherever you live. Go
to www.penguin.com and then search. Book 1, Set 1 is “Happy Family”
by Shirley Jackson.
 Solo books: To edge your child slowly forward from beginning books (like
the Ladybird books), here’s the perfect series. The Solo series contains
44 books, originally published by Scholastic Australia. To see the list of
44 titles, go to www.scholastic.com.au/schools/curriculum/
solo/booklist.asp and then find a description of the books and buy
them at Amazon.com or ask at your local bookstore. Two books to start
your search off are What a Mess, Fang Fang! by Sally Rippin and Smart Dad
by Amanda Graham.
 See More Readers: Published by SeaStar Books. The books in this series,
by author Seymour Simon, aren’t phonetically controlled, but they’re
categorized by reading level, so stick to Level 1. The books feature sci-
ence and nature themes and fantastic photos. You can get them in shops
and online at www.amazon.com. Be sure to check out Incredible Sharks.
 Reading Rainbow Readers: Published by SeaStar Books. These books
aren’t phonetically controlled either, but they don’t go overboard with
tricky words. Each book has a theme and short stories by various
authors. Titles include Family Stories and Friendship Stories, and they’re
available in bookstores and at www.amazon.com.
Don’t make your child stick exclusively with phonetically controlled books
that confine the text to sentences like “Dan can fan” — that’s so boring. Let
her pick plenty of her own books (about things like basketball, ocean life, and
pets) for browsing. That way, she gets to have books she’s really interested in
214
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

(the whole point!), and as long as you have her read phonetically controlled
books, too, it doesn’t matter if the text is beyond her reading skills.
When your child has flipped through plenty of phonetically controlled read-
ing books and is ready to move to harder text (but not too much harder), you
may want to stock up on favorite, but fairly simple, book series. Finding books
in a series is easier than searching randomly, so here are my suggestions for
book series that appeal to nearly all kids:
 Captain Underpants by Dav Pilkey (published by Blue Sky Press).
Available at all good bookstores.
 Magic Tree House by Mary Pope Osborne (published by Random House).
Available at all good bookstores.
 The Secrets of Droon by Tony Abbott (published by Scholastic). Available
at all good bookstores.
 Woodland Mysteries by various authors (published by the Wright Group).
Get these books at www.wrightgroup.com (click on “Wright Group”
and then “Chapter Books/Independent Reading”).
For reading books for adult dyslexics, check out Avanti Books at www.
avantibooks.com.
Reading to your child first
To prime your child (at any age) for reading a book, read it through to her first.
This gives her the sense of the text so that, when she reads alone, she’s better
able to use contextual and grammatical cues to figure words out more easily.
 Contextual cues are indirect clues you get from diagrams, headings, and
a general understanding of the topic. If, for example, you see the word
“horse” in a heading and a diagram of a currycomb, you can guess that
the text is about horse care.
 You get grammatical cues from understanding how words fit together in
sentences. For example, if you read, “they wants to gets swimming,” you
know you’ve misread because the words don’t flow together and the
sentence is grammatically incorrect.
I cover these concepts in more detail in the section “Helping your child find
contextual cues,” later in this chapter.
215
Chapter 13: Sprinting Ahead with Reading Basics and Practice

Pairing up to read
If you leave your dyslexic child alone with a book and expect her to read it,
you’ll be disappointed. Her reading is slow and labored, so she gets no plea-
sure from it — only frustration. The solution is to read along with her. You
can choose from a few great ways to do “paired reading,” and in the next sec-
tions, I take you through them step by step.
Have your child read out loud to you regularly because it’s one of the best
ways to help her become more fluent. Psyche yourself up to do a good job 
of listening to her. She’s a beginner, so she’ll make mistakes and you have to
gently help her through them. The most important thing that your beginning
reader needs to get from reading out loud to you is the feeling that she’s
moving forward and making you happy.
Choral reading
Choral reading means reading out loud with your child, the same text at the
same time. You read together, in unison, and your child gets to hear your
voice, guiding and supporting, all the while. When she’s not sure of a word
she can listen to you. When she’s reading smoothly without having to use
your cues, she still has you right there joining in the fun. Because it’s so easy
to do, choral reading is especially good for re-engaging a child who’s avoided
reading for a long time. As you get in tune with one another, try reading very
slightly after your child says the words. You get to hear her better, and she
still gets to listen to your voice when she needs to.
A nice modification of choral reading, when you really get into the swing of it,
is the tap-or-nudge routine. Decide upon a signal, like a tap or nudge, that
your child gives you when she wants you to stop reading. She taps for you to
stop reading and then taps again when she wants you to read again. The tap
can be on your arm or on the table, and the nudge pretty much speaks for
itself. Try it; after you get a rhythm going, it’s easy. This modification gives
your child more control, which in turn makes her a more confident reader.
Taking turns
Taking turns reading out loud together from the same book is a nice step 
up from choral reading (for when your child is a little more independent), 
but start small. If you tell your child to read a page to you, she may balk, so
ask her to read just a sentence (or even a word) on each page to start with.
Gradually ask her to read more and let her choose the sentence or paragraph
she reads. If she’s reluctant, don’t get annoyed, but don’t give up either. Make
deals. You’ll read an extra three pages if she reads three sentences per page.
216
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

As always, a terrific book does half the work for you. Your child soon gets
hooked into the story (or science or mechanics) and wants to know what
happens next, so she keeps reading.
Interrupted reading
Interrupted reading is a great way to take advantage of engrossing stories. If
you want your child to try reading all by herself, read to her at bedtime and
then stop reading at a crucial point in the story. Excuse yourself by saying
you have to let the dog out, clean the kitchen, or tuck her sister in. Then gra-
ciously allow her a few more minutes of reading time on her own if she wants
it (if she wants it — are you kidding me?). Usually she’ll get several more pages
under her belt.
For interrupted reading to work, you should be well into the book (so your
child is completely familiar with the characters and plot), and your child
should be feeling confident about reading.
Running through multiple readings
Reading a book several times makes your child faster and more fluent at read-
ing it and, as a result, more confident to tackle new books. A lot of reading
programs include repeated readings as one of their regular activities, and
schools buy whole kits of books and charts designed especially for lessons in
repeated reading.
The Read Naturally program is popular among resource teachers who are in
charge of helping dyslexic students. Children read a story, listen to it on tape,
practice reading it to themselves, and then read it again, timed this time. You
can check out the program at www.readnaturally.com, where you can also
find home products for parents.
You can easily do repeated reading at home without spending a lot of money.
All you have to do is get a book that’s not too hard for your child and have
her read a small section of 100 words from it to you three to five times (what-
ever suits you both best) against a stopwatch. Draw a chart or graph to plot
her progress (see Figure 13-2). Record the number of words read correctly
(out of the 100) on one page of a book and the time she takes. She usually
improves with each reading and gets even better on the next book excerpt.
Read about ten successive excerpts like this between the other regular read-
ing you do. Your child gets a quick boost in skill and confidence, and then
before the routine gets boring, it’s over. After a break of a few weeks, start up
another ten-excerpt booster program if you want.

Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

If your child hates being timed, do without the timing part of this activity. You
still get good results, and your child doesn’t get stressed or overwhelmed.
Nice and Gentle: Handling Your Child’s
Difficulties with Kindness
When your child reads out loud to you and makes mistakes, which ones
should you let pass and which should you correct? Do you simply tell her the
word and move on, or should you have her sound out the words? Should you
have her jot down the problem words to look at later? In the next sections I
give you the answers.
Helping children who have dyslexia is all about modifying their environment
and accommodating their needs rather than forcing things upon them. If your
child is struggling with a book, find another book, empathize, and find ways
(like taking breaks and reading out loud with her) to make things easier.
Knowing when to give a quick answer
When your child is reading out loud to you and gets stuck on the word
“through,” give her the answer straight away and continue reading. Hard words
aren’t worth battling. Your child will get to know them by reading them often,
and meanwhile you can help by having her write them down on paper and read
them back to you every day for several days. Post them on your walls too.
Don’t interrupt the flow of your child’s reading to try to get her to figure all
the hard words out. If a word sounds out easily, like “problem,” have her
sound it out, but don’t interrupt her every time she stumbles. She’s likely to
lose the drift if you do. When you let the reading flow, your child has the
chance to understand the text and to feel that she is a reader.
To make headway with reading, your child must feel secure. To appreciate
what it’s like for someone with dyslexia, imagine getting a thing wrong time
and time again. Imagine someone leaning over you and correcting you every
few minutes. You can see why you must limit your interruptions.
219
Chapter 13: Sprinting Ahead with Reading Basics and Practice

Having your child figure a word 
out when the time is right
When you’re reading with your child, here’s when it’s fine to take time out
and have her figure out words she gets stuck on:
 The interruption doesn’t make her forget what’s going on in the text.
 You know she can sound out the word as long as you prompt her. If she’s
stuck on “remain,” you can prompt her if she already learned the “ai”
digraph. A digraph is a two-letter sound/spelling chunk. The two letters
(like ai) make one sound.
 You haven’t stopped to figure out words a dozen times already (in which
case your child is close to burn-out).
 Your child is receptive. If she’s had enough, tell her the words! You can
always have her re-read the text later.
Knowing when to have your child figure out a word for herself is fairly easy,
but what’s the best way to tell her to do it? You want to avoid tears, furious
exits (hers or yours), and damage to her fragile ego with a misplaced word or
insensitive demand, but how exactly? Table 13-1 gives you a few do’s and
don’ts for earning your child’s cooperation.
Table 13-1
Asking Your Child to Figure Out Words
Don’t Say
Do Say
Look at it! You’ve already seen this word!
I think we just saw this word.
That’s not right. Sound it out!
Take this word bit by bit.
That’s wrong.
That doesn’t sound quite right.
No, it can’t say that!
Hmm, does that make sense?
Don’t just guess!
Almost. Try that one more time.
Helping your child find contextual cues
Contextual cues are clues your child gets about the meaning of text and the
words she may expect to find from subheadings, diagrams, and key words.
Here are some suggestions on how you can be sure you’re using all those
helpful cues:
220
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

 Cover blurb: You may use the cover blurb to help you decide what books
you want to read. Make sure your child knows that this material is a way
to find out what’s inside and doesn’t skip it. (You and I think it’s obvious
that the blurb is there to be read first, but it may not be obvious to your
child. Many things look different to your dyslexic child.)
 Table of contents: If your child is about to read a whole book, she should
first check out the table of contents in the front of the book. She usually
can get a rough idea of what’s coming from the chapter headings.
 Introduction: If a book or document has an introduction, have your child
read it. Dyslexics need as much of this kind of priming as they can get
because reading text cold is so hard for them.
 Subtitles: If your child sees words like “boy” or “horse,” she knows the
text is more likely to be about a boy doing stuff with a horse than a
woman getting robbed!
 Pictures and diagrams: Any illustrations your child can find in text are
helpful to her. Help her get into the habit of glancing at these anytime
they appear.
 Key words: When words repeat themselves in text, they’re probably
important. After your child has read factual text for the first time (she
probably needs several readings), have her check for nouns that appear
often. If she gets words like “reflection” and “refraction” in her mind
before she reads through a page about light for the second time, she’s
already won half the comprehension battle.
 Grammar: Your child can use grammatical cues when she’s in the middle
of reading. If she reads something like “They was went to school,” she
can hear that she needs to read the sentence again. It doesn’t sound
right at all — it’s grammatically incorrect — so she must have misread.
I don’t get caught up in grammatical rules in this book, but I do have one
point to make. If you make sure that your child talks properly (saying,
for example, “we were” and not “we was”), you help with her reading.
She knows which words go together and that, if she reads things like
“they is” and “you’d going next,” she needs to reread.
Using contextual cues is a secondary reading skill. If your child relies too
much on contextual cues and forgets to sound out, her reading is all over
the place.

it now. This chapter tells you, in a nutshell, what you must do to be multisen-
sory, why it matters for dyslexics, and how to fit a good supply of multisensory
tools in your house without having to remodel.
Bringing the Term “Multisensory” 
Down to Earth
Fancy terminology can sometimes be more trouble than it’s worth. But the
word “multisensory” is really very handy because once you feel comfortable
using it, you get to cut out a long-winded explanation of what you mean.
Without “multisensory,” you’d have to say something like this:
The stuff good teachers have always done. Putting hands-on practice into
teaching and learning. Adding talk, movement, and touch to reading and
writing. Being an active, engaging instructor rather than a person who
drones on and on and then tells your child to copy things down.
The following sections describe multisensory teaching, explain how it’s differ-
ent from traditional teaching methods, and detail its importance to dyslexics.

Distinguishing multisensory teaching 
from traditional methods
Multisensory teaching (and learning) is pretty much everything that old-
fashioned chalk-and-talk teaching isn’t. What happens in chalk-and-talk 
teaching is simply that the teacher talks about a subject, writes information
on the board, and asks kids to copy it. Every teacher does chalk-and-talk
teaching sometimes (we’re only human), but too much of it is bad news for
dyslexics. Chalk-and-talk teaching requires students to mostly use just two
senses, hearing (or auditory) and vision, and dyslexics happen to be con-
spicuously poor in both.
Dyslexics struggle with auditory memory or processing. They have trouble
recalling words and how they’re pronounced (saying things like “pasghetti”
instead of “spaghetti”) and don’t hear parts of words well (was it a dairy farm
or a dirty farm?). A dyslexic child may also be weak at visual tracking (follow-
ing words one after the other along lines on a page) and visual processing, or
visual discrimination (seeing the difference between different letters and let-
ters facing in different ways). Check out Chapter 3 for more details on signs
of dyslexia.
When you give your child tasks that use just his hearing and vision, without
drawing upon his other senses, you put him at a disadvantage.
Teaching in a multisensory way means helping a child learn through the use
of more than two of his senses. It especially means adding touch (the tactile
sense) and movement (the kinetic sense) to his activities so that his brain
has information that it reads better and so that he has more to hang onto. If
you teach your child things in a multisensory way, he won’t be merely sitting
down copying words — he’ll be doing things like making 3D words from mod-
eling clay and acting out phrases. Adding multisensory teaching will feel less
like a one-way exchange, from you to your child, and more like a cooperative.
It should also be fun.
Researchers know that multisensory learning works because they’ve done
studies that prove it. In rough terms, they know that people learn equally
well by seeing or hearing a thing, they do a bit better when they talk a thing
through, they do better still by doing a thing, and they learn best of all by
seeing, hearing, saying, and doing that thing. So you can take away a couple
of messages from the research:
 Creative play is really important because when your child plays, he does
all this fancy learning quite naturally (and it’s so cute when you see he is
constructing and creating and happily talking to himself all the while too!).
 To maximize your dyslexic child’s learning potential, ask him to see it,
say it, hear it, and do it!
224
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Multisensory learning was started by Dr. Samuel Orton and his colleagues
back in the 1920s at a mobile mental health clinic in Iowa. Orton had children
trace, copy, and write letters while saying their corresponding sounds and
called this method “kinesthetic-tactile reinforcement of visual and auditory
associations.” Now his multisensory method is called the Orton-Gillingham
method (Gillingham was Orton’s colleague), and it’s hugely popular among
educators. Teachers can be specially trained in Orton-Gillingham methods,
and Orton-Gillingham is mentioned in just about every place where people
talk about how to address reading problems.
The notion of visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learning styles is popular these
days. Most people who know anything about dyslexia warn that even though
you hear terms like “a kinesthetic learner” all the time, identifying an individ-
ual in this way is simplistic because people learn from all of their senses,
especially in combo (also known as multisensory). That said, if you’re inter-
ested in taking a free online test to see whether you have a dominant visual,
auditory, or kinesthetic learning style, go to www.ldpride.net. The test is
good for adults, too, and the idea is that if you know your dominant learning
style, you can try to use it most but also get more practice in your weaker
styles so you improve them, too.
Fitting together “multisensory” and
“structured and sequential” teaching
Right now, multisensory learning is hot, so any reading instructor you talk to
uses the word “multisensory” somewhere. When you hear it, chances are you
also hear a whole bunch of stuff about “structured and sequential” learning.
When a teacher puts explicit instruction of phonics rules into a program
(instead of teaching them as they crop up in stories and other text), he has a
structured approach. Teaching those phonics rules in a logical order makes
the teaching also sequential. (Chapter 12 gives you the full scoop on phonics.)
On the subject of using a multisensory and structured, sequential approach,
the International Dyslexia Association says that dyslexic students don’t need
more of the same instruction in class but a different type of instruction. They
need to learn basic language sounds and the letters that make them, starting
from the very beginning and moving forward in a gradual step-by-step, thor-
ough way. And to help pull all of that together through their own discovery,
they must use their eyes, ears, voices, and hands.

Setting the Stage for Multisensory
Success
Before you can start helping your child with multisensory learning, you need
to assume the role of facilitator or partner. When you model activities, replen-
ish dwindling supplies of materials, and join in the fun but take a facilitating
rather than a lead role, your child has ownership and control of a task and
feels more inclined to get right into it (eyes, ears, voice, hands, and all!). Here
are some ways you can let him assume ownership of his own learning so he
can then get multisensory:
 Let your child hold his pen, paper, and book. He should feel that his
work really is his work and not something you want him to do. Small
acts like holding his book or peering over his shoulder make him feel
that you’re taking over, so hands off!
 Have a schedule and remind your child to follow it. Say things like “It’s
5:00 now, time for homework” and calmly turn off the TV if you have to.
Don’t overtalk and get into monologues like “Turn off that TV. You never
turn it off when you’re supposed to. It’s homework time, you know that.
Go get your homework. Where have you put it? Have you got your pens?
Have you been keeping your pencils sharp?”
 Offer your help in small doses as needed. Say things like “I’m here if you
need me” or “Call me if you get stuck.” You probably don’t need to sit
with your child the whole time, but if you do, stop giving your help as
soon as you can and give it again only when it’s needed.
 Have your child take responsibility for the things he is capable of doing,
like putting his books away, sharpening his pencil, and bringing his jour-
nal to you to sign.
 Give your child small responsibilities at home so he can feel valuable
and independent.
 Praise your child for doing what he’s supposed to do and getting on with
things independently.
 Teach your child to ask for help in normal, polite tones. If he whines and
acts rudely, tell him calmly that you’re happy to help and sympathize with
his frustration, but remind him that he needs to ask you courteously.
Helping your child plug into multisensory mode at home is important for two
reasons:
226
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

 He may get a lot of traditional chalk-and-talk instruction at school and
not much hands-on stuff, so you can compensate for this at home.
 Much of what you do rubs off on your child, so taking stock of what you
do makes sense. Are you stepping back and allowing him to try out new
things for himself? Do you typically model a skill and then give him
plenty of practice? Are you more of a doer than an armchair expert?
Making Homework Multisensory
Good teachers help kids apply what they learn in concrete ways. They take
information that seems abstract (like a foreign language) and show students
that it actually does count in the real world (“Here’s a French magazine with
Orlando Bloom in it. See! French is used by kids like you!”). You can help your
child at home by doing the same thing with his homework. In this section I
tell you how to set up and then surge forward.
Setting up a happier homework 
environment
The traditional idea of kids’ doing homework at a desk in a quiet and brightly
lit spot may not be right for your dyslexic child. Experiment with different
ways of doing things and, as always, if something isn’t working, don’t force
it on your child. Instead, try doing it a different way. You may want to give
these simple, practical strategies a whirl.
 Let your child stand or alternate between standing and sitting to do his
work if he wants. He may feel more comfortable switching positions than
sitting for a long time, and in any case, movement helps his wandering
thoughts refocus.
 Let him chew gum or nibble on a snack while he works. Even really small
movements like these can help his mind stay on track.
 Let him sip from a water bottle. Again he gets the benefit of small move-
ment, and of course he’s hydrating, too.
 Many dyslexics are easily distracted by background noise, so you need
to experiment. The same thing applies to light; some dyslexics find that
an open or closed curtain makes a lot of difference in their ability to 
concentrate.
227
Chapter 14: Taking Advantage of Multisensory Methods

 Give him brightly colored highlighter pens and help him mark key
words. Highlighting can be a nice change from writing or keyboarding, it
draws his attention to small bites of important stuff, and it makes his
page look cheerful.
 Give him a bookmark to keep track of how far he has read. Otherwise he
wastes time searching for his place and probably gets irritated in the
process.
 Give him something, like a set of beads or a squishy ball, to manipulate
in his hand. Many dyslexic children have trouble being still, so things
that allow your child some slight movement can be really helpful. You
may even want to ask an occupational therapist about the range of
devices, like squishy seat cushions and wobbly foot rests, you can buy.
 Let him take short breaks. At best, most children have an attention span
of about 20 minutes, and the same goes for adults. Frequent quick
breaks give a person a learning advantage.
 Help him represent information in diagrams and pictures. A few para-
graphs of text can look infinitely clearer when your child summarizes
them in simple bubbles and arrows.
Adult dyslexics need to find their preferred learning environment and routine,
too. Take rest breaks and experiment with background noise, lighting, and
things like gum and squishy hand devices that help you get a little movement.
Helping your child understand 
new information
Back in my schooldays, I had to study Shakespeare’s Henry V. The teacher
had my class read the play word for old-fashioned word, though no one
understood it. The whole course was horribly tedious, and needless to say, I
failed my exam. To this day I’ve never read any original Shakespeare, only
modern kids’ versions.
What I’m getting at here is that you can’t easily learn a thing by starting from
unknown territory. You need familiar ground to get a footing, which in the
case of Henry V would have been a modern-day explanation (Who was that
Henry dude? Who did he argue with? What kind of schoolyard scenario would
be similar?).
To help your child with schoolwork or new information that seems foreign to
him, link it to something he already knows, and do so in a multisensory way.
How exactly? Here are some practical pointers:
228
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

 Put historical information into a current context that he knows
(“Imagine if I made you walk to the gas station. That’s how far the 
children had to walk to get water.”)
 Use new words in a familiar context (“How many fearsome people do you
know?”).
 Act out and discuss new words.
 Make models, pictures, and diagrams when you can (like drawings of
fearsome and tranquil scenes).
Having Practical Stuff for Playing 
at Your Fingertips
It’s time to home in on the materials that teachers use to add the multisen-
sory element to kids’ reading, writing, and spelling activities. You won’t be
surprised to see modeling clay featuring first off, but did you ever see a
teacher use sandpaper as an aid to literacy? In this section I talk about these
and other materials that teachers use to give their students educational, feel-
good (inside and out!) play.
Modeling clay
A lot of people feel that dyslexic children learn to read better if they see 3D
models of letters and words, so modeling clay is a favorite medium. To make
your own soft modeling clay, see the recipe in the nearby sidebar.
Gummy mixtures
If you want to have your dyslexic remember letter shapes through drawing
them in mediums that give him all sorts of soft or tasty sensations, make him
some gluggy, gooey, gummy mixtures to run his fingers through. For delicious
mixes, try chocolate pudding, colored sugar, or whipped cream, or get dirty
with sand, play cement, or good old garden mud. Another option is “gloop,” a
gooey, stretchy mix made from soapy stuff, which always feels nice to kids
(see the recipe for it in the nearby sidebar). Have your child finger-write let-
ters with these concoctions. Hopefully, he’ll lick his fingers only after using
the edible mixes!
229
Chapter 14: Taking Advantage of Multisensory Methods

Sandpaper
When your child uses modeling clay, he gets to squeeze, mold, and pull apart
the nice soft dough, using his whole hands. When he feels sandpaper letters,
his tactile sensations are fine-tuned further down to his fingertips, and
through them he feels, literally, letter shapes. Cut letters out of fine sandpa-
per so your child can run his fingers over them to help fix the shapes in his
brain. In Montessori schools, this activity is regarded so highly that you can
always find it being used somewhere in every classroom. (I talk about
Montessori schools in Chapter 7.)
To create other textured surfaces, have your child glue things on top of let-
ters you write on paper. Use items like dried beans, rice, yarn, buttons, pencil
shavings, and pasta shells.
Laminate
A roll of adhesive, clear book covering is a great investment. Write letters and
words on regular paper and then stick this covering over them. Your child
can trace over the letters with his fingers or use whiteboard pens and then
reuse the sheets after a quick wipe. He gets plenty of hands-on practice of
writing on a nice smooth surface, you can make big and small copies of the
same letter, and erasing and starting over is a breeze. If you want the deluxe
version of the same thing, take your letter sheets to an office supplies store
to be laminated.
230
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 
Mixing up some modeling clay
If you’re like me and have recipes jotted on bits
of paper all over the house, and good intentions
of one day collating them, you’re sure to want
to keep this “recipe” handy as an easy “treat”
for your dyslexic child.
Easy (and edible) modeling clay
You need the following ingredients:
 21⁄2 cups flour

1⁄2 cup salt
 3 tablespoons cooking oil

1⁄4 teaspoon food coloring
 2 cups boiling water
Mix the flour, salt, oil, and food coloring in a
bowl. Add the boiling water. Mix well and then
knead until smooth. (Use the kneading hook on
your food mixer if you have one.) This dough will
keep for several months in a plastic bag, but
don’t freeze it.
No food coloring? Try mixing JELL-O gelatin or
fruit-drink powder into the boiling water instead.

Teach your little child to write in stages with laminate:
1. Have you child practice tracing over the letters of the alphabet
2. Have him write the letters by joining dots (that you already made 
for him.
3. Have him copy the letters, while looking at the originals, on a sepa-
rate sheet of paper.
4. Have him write the letters without any props at all.
Scissors
Scissors are a handy thing for your child to have so he can cut up lists of
words and end up with a pile of single words to move around. By grouping
the words (rain, pain, and main, for example) and using them like flashcards
(see the following section), he gives himself a more interesting way to learn
them than by just studying the list. For more games you can play with cut-out
words, flip to Chapter 12.
Flashcards
Flashcards should come with a warning saying something like “WARNING:
These cards are pointless and tedious unless basic procedures are followed.”
Here’s an incident that happened in my family a few years ago that perfectly
illustrates my point.
231
Chapter 14: Taking Advantage of Multisensory Methods
Gloop, wonderful gloop
Children love to run their hands through 
gloop, which you can make with the following 
ingredients:
 1 cup white glue (Elmer’s works best)
 1 cup water
 Powder paint or food coloring
 11⁄2 teaspoons borax (find this in the deter-
gent aisle at the grocery store)
 1 cup warm water
Mix together the glue, water, and coloring. In a
separate cup, dissolve the borax in 1 cup of
warm water. Add the dissolved borax to the
other ingredients and stir rapidly for about 
2 minutes.

I arrived home from work one day and found my sister, Lyn, helping my
kindergarten child, Lauren, with sight words. Lyn had found a pack of my
flashcards (100 individual sight words) and my willing child, so thought
she’d do a good deed. Now she sat in front of my daughter and held each of
the 100 flashcards in front of her face, one at a time.
“When,” said Lyn, holding up the card.
“When,” repeated Lauren obligingly.
“Come,” said Lyn.
“Come,” repeated Lauren.
“Who.”
“Who.”
“Saw.”
“Saw.”
Was my sister giving Lauren a head start with reading? No. Lauren simply
could not learn 100 words, all at one time, by seeing and reciting each one
after my sister. The task was too enormous, and all she’d probably remember
was the nice experience of having her aunt interact with her.
In the right hands flashcards are a terrific tool for children, especially
dyslexic children, because they give small pieces of clear information that
you can control. For example, you can use just ten cards for a few weeks
before adding more, and you can go as slowly and with as much repetition
as your child needs. But never just buy a pack of 100 words and flash every
one in front of your child in the hope that some of the information will stick.
Exactly how can you get things right for your dyslexic child on your first try?
 Give information in small bites. You should select five to ten cards. Most
of us can retain only between five and ten pieces of new information at
any one time.
 Use only cards that your child’s already primed for (like bug, hut, and
luck and not bug, promise, and treat) and progress to the other cards
only when you’ve shown your child their spelling pattern (like cheese,
peel, and deep).
 Allow your child ownership. So that Lauren feels in charge of her learn-
ing, my sister should invite her to choose the words for herself.
 Have a hands-off policy. Your child should handle the cards herself and
put away the remaining cards herself. When you handle the cards, the
paper, the book, or whatever is in front of your child, you take over.
232
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Offer your help, but don’t touch unless your child asks you to. If you
handle the material, your child immediately feels the work is really
yours.
 Have fun. You should launch yourself, with much enthusiasm, into
making the learning fun. Games and changing tempo do this.
 Give praise and encouragement. Lyn did well on this score. She maintained
a flow of praise for each accomplishment. You should do the same.
 Watch for mastery. Until your child has learned the information you’re
giving, don’t give more. To test for mastery, Lyn might simply have said,
“I can see you’re really good at this. I wonder if you could still tell me the
words if you first turned them over so you can’t see them, and then mixed
them all up. Do you think you could turn each one over and read it?”
When your child learns a new letter pattern (like ai), he can easily learn
dozens of new words that use that pattern (like pain, rain, and main). Put
words into sound families such as the ou family — out, shout, found, around,
and proud. Have your child make his own “sounds” posters or give him a
notebook and have him make a separate page for each new sound he needs.
His pages will have sounds like ee, ea, ing, ou, ai, oa, and ight. But learning
words with no shared pattern is a different matter. So you don’t overload
him, use only up to ten new unalike words at a time. See Chapter 12 for more
details about sound families.
Board games
If you own games like Boggle, Hangman, and Junior Scrabble, don’t let them
stay buried under other games for months on end. They can help your
dyslexic child practice his phonics skills in a supportive, group environment.
Bring them out and have games evenings and championships. How many
other times does your child get to see everyone in the family modeling the
stuff you tell him to do?
Anytime you do the same activity that your child does, you’re modeling the
activity. Modeling is an effective way to teach your child because you give
him a concrete example of what he needs to do. Also, when he sees you or
any other person he admires do something, he wants to do the same. That’s
why it’s important that your child sees you doing good (not bad) things. Like
the adage says, our kids do what we do (even, as in the case of smoking,
when we’d rather they didn’t).
My all-time favorite game is Junior Monopoly. It’s so much better than the
adult version because only a little money counting is required, you finish
within the decade, and it’s easy to see if the banker is corrupt. Your child gets
to practice his reading, by the way, when he grabs the Chance cards and fig-
ures out street names.
233
Chapter 14: Taking Advantage of Multisensory Methods

Computer games
I don’t go into great detail about technology in this book, because I’m not
famous for my computer know-how, but I can safely tell you that computer
play can be productive for your dyslexic child. Good software dishes up
straight reading with plenty of sounds and cool effects so your child gets
reading practice and a fun time. Computer games can limit your child’s social
play and get out of hand, too of course, but these issues are mostly a matter
of using your common sense. Anyway, here are some good computer games
you can buy for your child on CD-ROM:.

Rae, the Brave; Harry and the Haunted House; and The New Kid on the
Block”). Published by Random House/Broderbund Company. Visit www.

to borrow the product from another library for you. For more recommenda-
tions on the newest products, leaf through a few parenting magazines or surf
parenting Web sites such as www.parenting.com.
See Chapter 9 for more tips about using technology.
Other great tools to have on hand
Classrooms in which multisensory learning really rocks have shelves full of
things for children to manipulate and make discoveries with. This active
learning indirectly boosts your dyslexic child’s reading by developing his
handwriting muscles (writing makes him think about building words) and
encouraging him to be inquisitive. Later, when you show him that reading is a
discovery process (what sounds can these letters make?), he’s already com-
fortable with problem solving. The following items all help your child develop
the dexterity and thinking skills that stand him in good stead for reading:
 Bags of buttons
 Blocks and construction sticks
234
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

 Brushes and paints
 Buckets of beads and thread
 Clothespins and rope to put them on
 Dolls and puppets
 Jigsaw puzzles
 Oversized sewing kits
 Paper, scissors, glue, and Popsicle-type sticks
 Plastic building bricks
 Playing cards and commercial word games
 Rock collections
 Shoeboxes full of cut-up sentences in envelopes
 Trains, cars, and model towns
These kinds of kits are fun, and you might say that multisensory learning is
as much about fun as it is about getting the full complement of seeing, hear-
ing, saying, and doing. Gather interesting items that your child can sort
through, construct, or create with, and you can be a multisensory mogul
without even realizing it!
Older kids don’t want to use the same materials as little kids, of course, but
there’s not as much difference as you might think! If you present a doll to
older kids and call it the mascot in a quiz game, they’ll love the doll. If you
make a competition of building things out of modeling clay, they’ll roll up
their sleeves. They can have hours of constructive fun with puppet shows. 
So don’t rule out buttons, blocks, and board games; instead, modify them
according to who’s getting in on the act.
Working Physical Activity 
into Your Child’s Routine
When you do physical exercise, happy hormones (endorphins) race through
your veins and make you feel great. Sure, it may take you a while to push
yourself into going for a walk (or to push yourself into last summer’s shorts
for that matter), but once you’re moving, you feel good.
So you won’t be surprised then to hear that psychologists and educators rec-
ommend exercise for struggling readers and have evidence that children who
get fresh air and do physical activities, like running and skating, focus better
in class and read more books.
235
Chapter 14: Taking Advantage of Multisensory Methods

Children who engage in physical activity every day do better in reading and
writing than kids who don’t. It’s that simple. You don’t have to join every
expensive sports team in the state to help your child get active, but you
should at least throw a ball to him once in a while, take him to the play-
ground often, and fit some walking into your weekly schedule.
If you can manage to get active outdoors every day, that’s a bonus. The great
outdoors is a natural tranquilizer, and a good old-fashioned walk can help
you and your child settle and focus on work afterwards. Natural light, fresh
air, and exercise make a great prelude to a reading session, especially if your
child is restless or hyper (which probably cancels out about one freakishly
demure child in every few dozen).
Experimenting with Alternative
Multisensory Treatments
Some ideas that are a far cry from the usual catch on and eventually become
popular. Here are a few such alternative ways to treat dyslexia. They all
involve the senses, and I, for one, think they’re pretty interesting.
Therapies that claim to cure or rapidly improve dyslexia even though they
have no valid evidence to support these claims are out there in droves. If the
person making these claims cannot cite evidence or actual experience of a
method working, be wary. Before you put your child through treatment or
spend large sums of money, ask for advice from the International Dyslexia
Association or other reputable, professional, nonprofit organizations that
keeps abreast of the research. Flip to Appendix B for contact info.
Coloring pages of text
Some children read a page of text better when you place a transparent, col-
ored overlay over it. They say that the words look clearer and sometimes
that they stop moving. You have to experiment with colors to see which one,
if any, makes a difference, but eye specialists warn that although dyslexics
can benefit from using overlays, you’re not treating the cause of dyslexia.
Colored overlays help with visual tracking problems, often called eye wobble,
but not with the auditory processing problem that dyslexics have. (Other
names you may hear for eye wobble are visual stress and visual dyslexia.
Symptoms range from seeing letters move or fade to feeling nauseous and
getting headaches when you look at words.)
To buy colored overlays and read more about using them, check out these
two commercial Web sites:

 How to learn at www.howtolearn.com/filters.html, phone 800-
469-8653
Other ways to treat poor eye control are to wear eye patches or colored
glasses and/or do eye-tracking exercises (your head stays still but your eyes
follow, or track, an object moving within your field of vision). The best age for
eye-tracking exercises to work is up to age 8. Scientists in Britain say that
dyslexics who wear a different-colored contact lens in each of their eyes can
read up to three times faster.
Reading a new font
In Britain (they seem to do a lot of research into dyslexia there!), a dyslexic
graphic designer has developed a new typeface called Read Regular that’s
being hailed as a breakthrough for dyslexics. What’s special about Read
Regular? It was developed by a dyslexic who says that none of the letters can
be inverted or mirrored to make another letter. Teachers in UK schools
report that students in general prefer it, and dyslexic students report that
Read Regular allows them to read quicker and no longer suffer from blurry
vision and headaches. Chrysalis, a book publisher, has adopted Read Regular
in some of its books but is still in the early days of production. You can find
titles at www.chrysalisbooks.co.uk (click on Children’s) and then buy
the books at www.amazon.com.
Listening to different messages in each ear
Dyslexics find it hard to hear word parts, so plenty of manufacturers have
designed listening products that they say (not surprisingly) give great
results. The products typically include a set of earphones and do things like
the following:
 Play music in one ear and instructions (like “color the ball”) in the other
 Play different music in each ear while your child works on a paper-and-
pen task
 Let your child play games that require him to match a different sound

The theory behind having your child receive a different message in each of
his ears at the same time is that the right ear needs stimulating because it
connects to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls speaking, reading,
and writing. When the right ear becomes dominant, it gives the left hemisphere
a great workout.

Eating fish
When I was a child, my mother tried to persuade me to eat fish by telling me
that it gives you brains. Well, wouldn’t you know it, like so many old wives’
tales, this one turns out to be true. Some researchers are saying that many
dyslexics are deficient in omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids, which keep the
brain cells, especially those involved in reading, healthy. Omega-3s come
from fish oils, so to keep up your omega-3s, eat oily fish (like salmon and sar-
dines) or fish-oil supplements.

W
hen the average person hears the term “dyslexia,” he probably thinks
of reversed letters, word blindness, and sentences jiggling around on
pages. Every dyslexic does indeed struggle with written print, but for many,
that’s only the half of it.
In this chapter, I show you that dyslexia can be a whole lot more than meets
the keyboard. I cover the importance of fostering a positive, independent 
attitude in your child, and I give you tips on how to help your child figure
out space, time, and sequence.
Routine and repetition go a long way toward helping your dyslexic child suc-
ceed in life. To help her master skills and remember concepts, you need to give
her every opportunity to practice. You need to present the same information
to her often, in different guises. All of this takes patience and perseverance
for sure, but don’t think it’s all uphill. The biggest part of overcoming dyslexia
is facing it head on and moving straight into action. After you realize that your
child needs to do more of everything (so she can hold on to what she learns),
you can both simply get on with it!
And when you’re helping your child practice skills, remember to point out
her strengths and interests. Otherwise, all that practice is like you’re saying,
“You’re weak at this, weak, weak, weak; oh and by the way, did I mention that
you’re weak?”

Talking Your Child into Feeling Good
You want your dyslexic child to feel happy, confident, and loved, no matter
what, and ultimately you want her to have her own positive self-talk to rely
on when you’re not there. Your child needs to tell herself that she’s okay,
even though she has dyslexia, and that other people accept her — dyslexia
and all. When she can “wear” her dyslexia, explain it to other people, and ask
for help without embarrassment, she sheds a whole sack of anxiety.
Toward that end, I give you some tips in the following sections on recognizing
your child’s feelings, listening carefully to her, fostering her independence,
and handling her mistakes calmly.
Understanding your child’s feelings
Dyslexia may affect your child’s memory, ability to follow instructions, and
chances of getting where she’s supposed to be going! With all this going on,
it’s not surprising that she can sometimes feel scared and unhappy. Ask a
dyslexic to explain her feelings, and you hear things like this:
 I always knew I was different.
 I felt isolated and jealous. How come all the other kids could easily do
the things I struggled so hard with?
 I just couldn’t get it, no matter how hard I tried. I was frustrated all the
time.
 I couldn’t find the words I wanted and knew I looked dumb because of it.
 I’d find myself at the cupboard not knowing what I’d gone there for.
 The teacher would ask me to do something, but I’d mix it up. I’d bring
her a pen instead of a book or find myself wandering around school not
knowing which class I should be in.
 I forgot people’s names even when I’d known them for years. I knew I
ought to know something that basic and felt so humiliated.
 I could never gauge what time it was and couldn’t understand clocks.
 I was never sure if what I thought I heard someone say really was what
she’d said.
And as if all this weren’t bad enough, check out the kinds of things dyslexics
are told about themselves:
240
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

 You’re lazy.
 You don’t want to learn.
 You never listen.
 Your writing is like a kindergartner’s.
 Follow the words!
 Think!
 You’ll be held back a grade.
 You need to try harder/listen better/concentrate more.
 You’ll have to look for an easy job.
 You won’t be able to go to college.
Children with dyslexia take a lot of knocks. They can easily feel weird or
below par, so a big part of parenting a child with dyslexia must be building,
protecting, and at times repairing her self-esteem. Your child can’t move for-
ward unless she feels valued and productive, so you have to step up your
nurturing skills to meet her needs. Let her know you have a sympathetic ear.
Help her sound out ideas she has for dealing with life’s knocks. Then, when
another child calls her dumb, retarded, or stupid or when an adult calls her
lazy, distracted, or slow, she’s ready to tackle it.
Listening carefully
Most people think of themselves as pretty good listeners, but if you ask their
friends and families, few of them really are (not that friends say this to your
face of course!). I learned this firsthand some years ago when I worked on a
telephone help line. I volunteered my services, thinking I was a natural lis-
tener, but after eight training sessions, I realized how far off the mark I’d been.
You can do several things to be a better listener, and most of them don’t come
naturally to most of us, so we need to learn them. If you follow the tips in this
section, you can improve your chances of steering your child into confiding in
you. When she does, you’re a bigger part of her life, and especially as she gets
older, you’re better equipped to help her out of any trouble she gets into. As a
nice spinoff, you get to be a better friend, teacher, and all-round parent too.
Just reading these tips and nodding sagely won’t do you any good. You have
to consciously decide that your listening skills could use an overhaul. Then,
next time your child (or father, friend, or workmate) talks to you, try out
these tips. And keep doing it! The following tips are, in a nutshell, the fantas-
tic things that my telephone help line trainers taught me.
241
Chapter 15: Handling Everyday Activities and Difficulties

 Listen much more than you talk. Your child really doesn’t want your
opinion unless she asks for it. She wants to be heard. Resist the tempta-
tion to butt in. Pauses are fine. Let her sort through her thoughts, and
put them out there, in her own way and time.
 Don’t judge. Resist the urge to say things like “You did what?” or “That
was silly of you” or “Why did you do that?” Instead (if you think you
need to say anything at all), say things like “That must’ve been hard” or
“That must’ve felt bad.” You’re encouraging your child to open up to
you. If you judge her, she just stops talking and makes a mental note not
to confide in you again.
 Encourage more conversation. Help your child go into more detail by
paraphrasing (saying back to her) what she says. For example, if she
says, “The teacher said I was silly and disruptive in front of the whole
class and Brittany laughed at me,” respond with something like “She
said that?” or “She told the whole class?”
Don’t try to clarify what your child says by asking her probing questions
like “How do you know Brittany was laughing at you?” or “Did the teacher
use the word silly?” Your child will get annoyed at your interference!
 Let your child do her own problem solving. Most of the time she can
come up with her own problem-busting strategies. She knows better
than you how kid world works and feels more capable if she sees she
has control and choices. Most fears come from a feeling of no control, so
you don’t do your child any favors by always ruling over her.
Big kids are, of course, more able to solve their own problems than little
kids, but even your little child can think stuff through if you give her just
a little prompting and probing. Say things like “Can you think of anything
you could do to solve the problem?” “What kinds of things help you out
in class?” or “I expect you have a few ideas of how you might fix this
problem.”
 Try to keep your child talking for ten minutes. When your child feels
really down, ten minutes of talking works wonders. After this time, her
spirits lift a little, her mind clears, and she’s over the worst.
 Follow up with an action. When you end your conversation, steer your
child into saying what she’ll do next. “Do you feel like having a hot
chocolate?” or “What will you do now — maybe a soak in the tub?”
If you’re thinking that your child just isn’t the talking type, you may want to
polish your basketball skills. When you simply hang out with your child,
shooting hoops, playing ball, or doing whatever else your child likes, you pro-
vide just as much therapy as you do when you have a heart-to-heart chat
with your more conversational child. As with everything else about having
dyslexia, it’s a personal thing, different for each child.

Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Empowering your child
One of my kids is a born worrywart. She worries about making friends, hang-
ing onto them, going to the dentist, going anywhere new, and of course,
whether this pair of pants goes with that sweater. Because I’m not blessed
with vast reserves of patience, this sends me into near paroxysms. I want my
child to instantly make friends with everyone, deal stoically with the dentist,
and wear, along with a great big radiant smile, whatever clothes she can put
on quickest.
As you can imagine, I’ve had to curb some pretty unattractive and sometimes
illegal impulses and instead learn to tell my child she’s okay and that she has
some control over what happens to her. At some point your dyslexic child
will need you to do the same. Here then are tips from experts I’ve consulted
along my own bumpy journey:
 Help your child solve her own problems. Instead of providing her with
answers (assuming you have any!), help her come up with her own. She
often knows more about school problems than you do, and besides, her
own solutions are more meaningful to her than any you give her. Your
“answer” may be exactly what your child doesn’t want. For example, you
may want to march to school with a complaint about another child, but
your child may want to keep a low profile. She may simply want to
offload to you, knowing that soon her disagreement will resolve itself.
 Work hard at being a receptive listener so that your child comes to you
with her problems. Take care not to interrupt her or make judgments.
Instead, just listen (see the preceding section) and pass the odd com-
ment like “That must’ve felt bad.” The simple relief of offloading to you
may be all the solution your child needs.
 Help your child role-play behaviors like listening, smiling, and making
positive comments that can help her make and keep friends. If your
child has trouble making friends, she doesn’t want you pointing it out.
She knows what’s happening and feels embarrassed if you put a spotlight
on it. Help her practice positive behaviors without giving the message
that she’s doing everything wrong. Good luck!
 Without making her feel responsible for her problems, help her get out
of unhelpful habits like not sharing or not speaking up for herself, or
wearing a permanent scowl. Notice her every time she does good things,
like sharing and speaking up, and say things like “You look great when
you smile.”
 Help your child explain herself. She needs to ask for help in class, and
outside of class, she needs a standard line for explaining (to friends) any
difficulties she has.
 Have your child do a lot of activities outside of school. Sports and social
clubs are great, but doing fun activities with family builds her confi-
dence too.
243
Chapter 15: Handling Everyday Activities and Difficulties

 Encourage play dates. Make your house a fun place for your child’s
friends to be.
 Help your child deal with bullying. If your child complains of being 
bullied, simply saying “Stand up for yourself” is bad advice. Get good
advice from your school counselor and check out Bullying Online at
www.bullying.co.uk — one of the clearest and most straightforward
sites on this subject. You may want to let your child see this crisis
number too, because even if you’re the best parent in the world, older
kids often prefer talking to a stranger: National Crisis Helpline for youths
and others, 800-999-9999. For help lines in countries outside of the
United States, run an Internet search for “help line.”
Responding calmly to your child’s mistakes
Everyone makes mistakes, but when your child has hardly any sense of space
and time and usually can’t follow a string of directions — all of which I talk
more about in the next section — she makes more. Parents should handle a
dyslexic child’s mistakes as calmly as possible because a stirred-up child
feels agitated, angry, or nervous, none of which helps her fix her mistakes.
Try the following tips:
 Most of the time when you talk to your child, you need to phrase your
comments in personal terms, such as “You did a good job” or “I want
you to come here now.” When you’re bringing up a potentially sticky
issue, however, such as “You didn’t clean your room,” it’s best not to be
personal. Instead, focus on the task. Talk about what you want and not
what your child has or hasn’t done. That way you don’t end up criticiz-
ing and probably waging war with her.
 Before giving your child important directions, make sure that you have
her full attention. She should be looking at you, and ideally, you should
talk to her away from distractions like TV and noisy siblings.
 Phrase directions in short, clear sentences. It can be helpful to have
your child repeat them back to you too, just to be sure she understands
and has sequential points in the right order.
 Use precise wording. Instead of telling your child to do her homework,
tell her to sit at the table after her snack and stay there until every piece
of homework is done. It can also be helpful to specify whether she can
get her own drinks or more snacks or whether she must stay put until
you call her for breaks.
 Create ways for your child to lend you a hand so she can feel valued and
successful. Be very careful, though, to have realistic expectations of
what she can achieve; otherwise, your best intentions can backfire. You
certainly don’t want to end up saying things like “Not that way!” “Why
didn’t you ask me?” and “I only asked you to do one simple thing!”

Table 15-1 shows you the kind of positive talk that dyslexics say makes all the
difference. I know that you already talk sweetly to your child most of the
time. However, when you lapse into moaning and criticizing (what, me?)
because you’re tired, hungry, or just plain old grouchy for no good reason,
you may need a reminder! (I have personal motives for including this table,
too. When I write about positive talk, my kids get two or three days of utter
sweetness from me, and I can feel heroic!)

larly great for parents of dyslexic children because you get clear, explicit
phrases (just the kind your child appreciates) to try out.
Helping Your Child with Space, Time,
and Sequence
Besides struggling with reading and writing, some dyslexics may face difficul-
ties that fall into these three categories:
 Space
 Time
 Sequence
245
Chapter 15: Handling Everyday Activities and Difficulties

Your dyslexic child may struggle in any or all of these categories, in big or
small ways. Dyslexia is different for each child, and that’s why it’s such an
interesting and often contentious disability.
Dyslexics are often said to have strengths in spatial and mechanical skills,
and that’s why I stress that only some dyslexics struggle in these areas. I have
one dyslexic friend who is 100 percent reliable in getting things done (she has
no trouble with strings of instructions) and has a sense of direction that
leaves me for dead. She can drive me anywhere she wants; I know we’re
much more likely to get there, and on time, if she drives. (Did I warn you
never to let me drive you anywhere new, in case you were thinking of it? I’m
almost certain to get both of us lost.)
In the following sections, I provide tips on helping your child figure out
space, time, and sequence in a fun and easy way.
In this chapter I discuss space, time, and sequence as difficulties apart from
reading and writing because I talk a lot about reading and writing in other
chapters. However, all of the home-based activities here still offer wonderful
opportunities for you to build your child’s language and early literacy skills
and organizational skills too.
Spacing out
A dyslexic child can have trouble telling left from right, up from down, and
front from back. But that’s not where the space thing ends. She may also
struggle with hand-eye coordination and be unable to do things like draw a
straight line or copy text and pictures accurately. The next sections explain
more of the practical problems your child may face and what you can do
about them.
Telling the difference between left and right
When I was a child, I wrote an L on the back of my left hand and an R on my
right. I replenished the ink a few times and then learned to do without. The ink
was there for just a few days before left and right became second nature to me.
With a dyslexic child, things are very different, however. Left and right can
stymie her for weeks or forever because she just can’t recall which word (left
or right) is the one to use. She needs things on which to hook the concept of
left and right.
One item that parents use to help their child learn left and right is an analog
watch. The watch kills two birds with one stone because your child can look
at it to be reminded which ways the numbers face and know that it sits on
her left arm. Want to go left? That’s your watch arm. (Check out the section
“Timing is everything,” later in this chapter, for details on helping your child
figure out time.)
246
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Older children can remember left from right by recalling which hand they
write with. The advantage of this method is that they always have their hands
with them (and there’s no frantic searching for watches left in lockers!).
To help your child get into the watch habit, play left-and-right games. Have
your child move toy trucks along carpet roads and find treats you hide on the
left or right side of rooms. And do something you hear me say quite a bit in
this book: Keep doing that!
Distinguishing between under and over and other spatial terms
Your dyslexic child struggles to recall the names of familiar things, and when
it comes to choosing the right word from a bunch of conceptually similar
words, like under and over or before or behind, she may struggle even more.
A good way to help your child with the concepts of in and out, under and
over, and top and bottom is to team up for some routine activities around the
house. First, head to the kitchen, where your child can put the egg in the skil-
let, flip the pancake over, and pour on the syrup. To work off the calories,
head outside with a ball. Throw it into a hoop, roll it under a swing, and lob it
over a trampoline. When you’re back indoors, build cardboard-box forts and
plastic-brick towns and move figures in and out of rooms.
Navigating new places
Because left and right and other directional concepts may get into a muddle
in your dyslexic child’s mind, getting to new places may be a lifelong hurdle
for her. Even adult dyslexics often report that, all grown up or not, they fear
going to unknown locations. They worry that they may never get back out.
When your child starts a new school, you need to help her navigate her way
around it. Explain your situation to the guidance officer or principal and
schedule a few visits to help familiarize your child with the school layout. For
older kids, pocket maps are helpful, but before your child tucks a map in her
pocket, you need to show her how to visualize herself on the map and use
landmarks, like the office, the library, the cafeteria, or the big art mural in the
hallway, for gathering directional facts. For example, she can remember that
her locker is across from the library. The more your child uses this technique
of taking these mental snapshots, the more she will be able to use it in places
beyond school.
If your dyslexic child is very visual, she may want to take photos of these
landmarks (her locker or classroom) from a distance so she can refer to them
in the same way that a hiker refers to mental images of landmarks he passes
so he can find his way back.
247
Chapter 15: Handling Everyday Activities and Difficulties

Putting everything in its place
Remembering what goes where can be a big problem for your dyslexic child.
She may wear mittens on the wrong hands, shoes on the wrong feet, and
sweaters backwards. Her book may turn up in the tool shed, her lunchbox
may disappear altogether, and her pens may make their appearance just
about everywhere.
One thing that dyslexic adults all agree on is that lists of what you need and
color-coded boxes for storing things you need make life easier. Try these tips
for getting as close as possible to having a place for everything and every-
thing in its place:
 Assign each child a different color for identifying his belongings (my
towel, water bottle, and lunchbox are blue, and yours are red).
 Use colors to label things like subject-specific files and books and pic-
tures (rather than words) to label boxes of toys.
 To keep your child wearing clothes facing the way they should, have her
look for labels on the back of garments or pictures on the front.
 Mark the inside soles of each of your child’s shoes with a dot at the
inside edge (the edge that touches the other shoe). Dots go together.
(See the related sidebar, “Putting the shoe on the right foot.”)
 Establish a set-in-stone morning routine! For example, wash and get
dressed before eating breakfast.
 Have your child do a check before she leaves in the morning. Is she
clean? Does she have her lunchbox, books, and shoes? She can touch
each item to be sure she has it. (Or alternatively, she can give you the
“duh” treatment and bolt out with last night’s pizza stuck to her face and
her gym shorts sitting on the hall table.)
Classifying stuff helps your child sort out all the information that her eyes and
ears bring her. Have her categorize and classify objects at home as much as
you can: by type, color, texture, number, size, and so on. You can do this with
groceries, items in the cupboard or closet, or pebbles at the beach (if you’re
lucky enough to get to hit the waves). At school, she can put her classification
know-how to good use on disorganized desks and fully loaded lockers.
Boosting hand-eye coordination during play
When your child starts school, she uses a lot of fine motor skills that require
good hand-eye coordination. Every day she manipulates blocks, beads, and
other small things, and steers her pen and scissors along lines and curves.
Strong hand-eye coordination doesn’t come easily to dyslexics, so prepare
her by having crafts and toys in your house and making sure she uses them.
Get into the action with her. Keep pens, tape and scissors, building blocks,
and Barbie out so you can construct and play, and watch TV at the same
time. If you can, have one parent cook dinner while the other one updates
Barbie’s spring ensemble.
248
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Ever heard the saying “You can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs”? Try
to apply it to your child’s play. If she builds a Barbie village and tapes half
your Tupperware together to do it, look past the mess. The cutting, taping,
and general fiddling that she does is building strength and coordination in
her fingers. And I haven’t even started on the tremendous brain value of cre-
ative play! (I go into full detail in Chapter 14.)
Copying print and pictures
Wow, copying is hard for dyslexics because when her eyes leave the page, her
brain doesn’t seem to hold onto the mental image of what she just saw. Your
dyslexic child may always have trouble copying things from a blackboard (or
from any other place, for that matter), so you need to help her in two ways.
 First, stick with a routine of helping her read so she can identify the
words on the board, which I talk about more in Chapter 13.
 Second, ask her teacher to take her difficulties into consideration and
make simple accommodations for her, such as having her copy only key
words. I talk more about classroom accommodations in Chapter 10.
These suggestions can help your child keep her writing level and centered
when she’s copying:
 Tape her page to the desk (facing at a comfortable angle).
 Put a strip of tape at the bottom of the page to remind her to end there.
 Put a pencil grip on her pencil.
 Put an elastic band above the bare wood part of her pencil to remind her
to grip above it.
249
Chapter 15: Handling Everyday Activities and Difficulties
Putting the shoe on the right foot
In most households, mornings are chaotic
enough without having to worry about your
child putting her shoes on the right feet with the
shoestrings property tied. Here then, to ease the
morning madness, are a few shoe-taming tips:
 Have little kids wear Velcro shoe straps!
 Teach your child to make two loops and
then knot them (rather than going through
the alternative right-over-left-and-under
routine).
 Draw things on the inner sole of each shoe,
up against the edge that touches the part-
ner shoe. Put lips to kiss each other or, for
older kids, tiny dots, so your child knows to
join them together.
 Put different-colored laces in your child’s
shoes. Have the left lace match the color of
her watch (worn on the left wrist).

 Remind her to leave a finger’s width of space between words.
 Have her use lined paper so that she knows to write on the lines.
At about grade 2, handwriting is a big issue in school. Your child will be asked
to practice and practice her handwriting — and then practice some more.
The only trouble is that she may never develop a neat hand or win a penman-
ship award. See your child’s teacher and ask for her consideration. Explain
that you want to ensure that your child doesn’t start to totally dislike school
simply for the sake of a skill that she can never really master and that isn’t, in
the big picture, worth hammering at.
Not taking points off for penmanship is an accommodation you can request
for your child and add to her Individualized Education Program (IEP). I
explain IEPs in Chapter 8.
Timing is everything
Your dyslexic child may have trouble figuring out months of the year, days of
the week, and what time of day it is because she can’t match the word (even if
she can recall it) to the right concept. Even if you tell her, for example, that yes-
terday was Monday, she may not be able to immediately figure out that today is
Tuesday. She may find it hard to put personal stories into a time frame, too. For
example, she won’t know whether Fred lived in his house years ago or a little
while back or lives there still today. In the next sections, I talk about big time —
years, months, and weeks — and smaller time — days and hours — and how to
give your child a lot of practice with each.
Reading routinely to your child offers the opportunity to address space, time,
and sequence difficulties (like when Fred lived in his house). See Chapter 13
for more info on reading with your child.
Understanding a calendar
To make the weeks and months have meaning for your child, you need to pin
her personal information to them. Have your child make a calendar. Most
computers have calendar software, so help her plot birthdays and school
breaks on the months, print them out, and staple them together. Have your
child cross off the days as they pass. And why stop there? Your child may
love finding out about the solar system and how days and years are mea-
sured by it.
Whatever you do to fix calendar information in your child’s mind, the key is
to personalize and attach physical action to it.
250
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Reading a clock
Whenever you can, have your child do hands-on activities to learn things.
Telling the time lends itself nicely to hands-on discovery because you can use
all kinds of timers to get your point across.
Digital clocks make life easy, but your child still needs to understand analog
clocks. Make or buy a clock for her to play with and explain how each hand
on the clock works by itself. The little hand is pretty much the boss because
it tells you the hour, but it has to keep a check on what the big hand’s doing
(so it can gauge its own slower movement). A handy rhyme for remembering
which hand tells minutes and which tells the hour is “The little hand has all
the power, it’s the one that tells the hour.”
Try out these progressive activities to help your child tell time:
 Counting by “One Mississippi”: When you say “Mississippi” after saying
each number up to 60 (like “one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three
Mississippi . . .”), you count an accurate minute. Explain to your child
that there are 60 seconds in a minute and that “one, Mississippi” is a
second while 60 of them get you to a minute. Then have her practice.
Ask her if she can hold her breath for a minute, guess how long a minute
is (by doing the Mississippi counting to herself), and do squat thrusts
for a whole minute. After that, you’re ready to help her grasp the idea of
intervals of five minutes.
 Using an egg timer: Does anyone but me remember using an egg timer,
with real sand in it, to time the cooking of a boiled egg? Nowadays you
see more of the over-easy kind of egg, and timers are electronic. However,
you can still find old-fashioned timers (in fact, one of my kids’ games has
one inside). The sand-filled timer is neat to play with, and if you’re really
smart you can make your own version (rice in two taped-together plastic
bottles). Cook up some eggs (three minutes for soft-boiled, five for hard-
boiled!), let your child get used to waiting for five minutes, and then show
her what five minutes looks like on an analog clock.
 Counting in the kitchen: After your child knows how long 5 minutes is,
she needs to experience 15-, 30-, and 60-minute intervals. A nice way for
her to do this is to roll up her sleeves and head to the kitchen. Help her
rustle up some muffins or pizza and, in the process, use your stovetop
timer. For fun, you can both try guessing the time without using a timer.
Telling time is a complicated skill that requires your child to know other
things, too. For example, she needs to know how to multiply by 5 and must
learn how to tell minutes past and minutes before the hour. Provide your child
with plenty of opportunity to practice and ask her to repeat explanations back
to you. She’ll find her own way to gather and organize her thoughts if you give
her the chance.
251
Chapter 15: Handling Everyday Activities and Difficulties

Teach your child one concept at a time. Begin with the role of the little hand
on an analog clock. Have your child move the little hand and tell you the hour
time as she does it. Do a whole lot of this before adding a new concept. When
your child is comfortable with “o’clock time” (one o’clock, two o’clock, three
o’clock), coach her on how to multiply by 5 and explain how that ties in with
how the big hand moves.
Following a sequence
Dyslexic children often have trouble expressing linear thoughts (this, then
that, then the next thing), following someone else’s line of conversation, and
remembering things such as telephone numbers and lists of instructions.
Remembering strings of numbers and instructions is a skill, called a short-
term memory skill, that’s often used in assessments of dyslexia.
If you know that your child has trouble remembering several things in
sequence, help her by breaking the sequence into small steps. Tell her just
one or two steps at a time and add more only when you’re sure she com-
pletely understands them.
The fancy name that psychologists use to describe the way you can break
tasks into small sequential steps is task analysis. Good teachers do task
analysis naturally. They start at the beginning, work steadily forward, and
have classrooms full of kids who know exactly what’s going on!
It sounds easy, doesn’t it? In practice, however, it’s a state of grace that not
all teachers achieve. To be effective in explaining any given task sequence to
a dyslexic child, try the following:
 Make an analogy or comparison that relates what you’re introducing to
your child to something she already knows. For example, when you
show your child a compass for the first time, you can start by saying
“Does this look a bit like something you already know?”
 Point out large features of a new concept before homing in on the
specifics. For example, ask your child, “A compass fits in your hand and
has a pointer like a watch does. Can you ever tell the time with it?”
 Ask your child to make guesses about a new concept and tell anything
she already knows. For example, “If this compass doesn’t tell you the
time, what do you think it does tell you?”
 Explain the specifics you’re leading up to, in small bites. For example,
“There are four main points on the compass. Can you see them?”
252
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

Asking your child broad questions, having her compare new information to
what she already knows and making her take guesses engages her with the
task. She becomes an active learner. When she tries doing the task for herself,
keep this active learning in motion by stepping back and allowing her to learn
by trial and error. She’ll get more confident and independent if you step in to
correct her only when she can’t move forward without your interruption.
Reminding yourself to physically stop talking and step back is an excellent
teaching strategy!
Doing a thing is better than just talking about it. You need to show and tell
rather than just tell. The story in the nearby sidebar, “Getting comfortable
with a compass,” shows (hopefully) the importance of both task analysis and
modeling a skill for your child.
253
Chapter 15: Handling Everyday Activities and Difficulties
Getting comfortable with a compass
I once went on an outdoor education course for
scout leaders (go scouts!). Along with all the
other parents who came, I got to do a lot of
hands-on things and was fed good barbecued
food too. The trainers really knew their stuff.
One of the skills we all learned that day was
teaching children to use a compass. The train-
ers got right into role, teaching us as if we were
the children we would soon be showing this skill
to. They walked us through the ins and outs of
compasses, and taking one step at a time, we
all got the hang of it.
When it was time to practice what we’d learned,
the trainers put us into pairs. One person in each
pair was to act the part of a child, and the other
was to be the parent. I offered myself to my part-
ner as the child, and without preliminaries, my
partner said to me, “You look at 120 degrees,
and you face that way.”
I could hardly believe my ears. Just like me, she
had heard and experienced the right way to do
this, but even so, she launched straight into
what should have been the last part of the
learning sequence. My partner was just not
used to teaching. Unless you have experience,
you tend to launch into the end stages of a
whole sequence of instructions. You don’t break
up your task. You don’t start at the beginning.
My partner should have started with something
like this:
“This is a compass. We use a compass for find-
ing our way around. It looks a bit like other
things you see, like a stopwatch, but it doesn’t
tell any sort of time; it’s only for finding our 
way around. The way it helps us to find our 
way around is by showing us the four direc-
tion points. Do you see N on your compass?
What does it mean? Can everyone see it? (Help
the person next to you if she can’t see it.) Very
good. Now, what’s the right way to hold the
compass?”
This is how task analysis works. You teach one
concept at a time, building from simple to harder
and letting your child practice at each stage.
Help your child takes things step by step like
this, with plenty of practice, and she won’t
become lost or disheartened.

Maintaining Harmony in the Home
Dyslexia exerts its influence beyond the classroom. While your child’s core
problem is with reading and writing, her whole self-concept is affected by her
dyslexia, and this, together with her academic struggles, affects your whole
household. You may worry about her sadness and frustration and tread
warily trying not to upset her. You may overprotect her or expect too much
of her. Brother and sisters may resent the extra time you spend with your
dyslexic child, and she in turn may resent the greater freedom they have or
the fact that younger siblings outperform her academically. With a dyslexic in
your household, you can easily find yourself managing a big, hot, volatile
boiling pot. In the following sections, I give you tips for keeping the tempera-
ture down and avoiding spills.
Sharing the load
Shared chores and responsibilities help households run smoother. Your
dyslexic child needs to be included in your household’s duty roster, so to
avoid misunderstandings or mistakes, select her responsibilities wisely from
the outset. She probably isn’t the best candidate for remembering to put out
the garbage, but walking the dog (who makes his presence known) may be a
much better choice. Of course, your children all get plenty of homework and
probably fit sports into their evening, too, so you’ll want to make sure that
chores are helpful and not more trouble than they’re really worth. Small
responsibilities, like loading the dishwasher, straightening up the pile of
shoes by the back door, and setting and clearing the table, are enough to give
dyslexic and nondyslexic children alike a sense of responsibility.
Toeing the line
Disciplining a dyslexic child can be a bit different from disciplining other chil-
dren because your dyslexic child may do things that appear intentional when
in fact they’re not. To help you distinguish between genuine infractions and
forgetfulness or distractedness, and choose a measured rather than impul-
sive response, here are some behavior-management guidelines:
 Your dyslexic child easily forgets instructions, misunderstands instruc-
tions, or understands them but gets them in the wrong order. You need
to be quite sure that she hears what you say and understands your
meaning before relying on her to carry through.
254
Part IV: Taking Part in Your Child’s Treatment 

 Punishing your dyslexic child can make her feel resentful or humiliated.
Repeated punishments can desensitize her and make her wonder why
she should bother being good anyway because she can’t see beyond the
here-and-now of the punishment. The best response to misdemeanors is
to find ways for your child to atone. If she breaks or loses something,
she can do an extra chore to pay for it. If she needs to make up home-
work that she failed to do earlier, she can forgo her TV time to do it. If
she fails an assignment because she lost her book, she can spend an
hour organizing her room so she’s less likely to repeat the same mistake
any time soon.
 Your dyslexic child already has a fragile ego because her dyslexia keeps
her from being an academic high flyer. Your understanding can help her
pass through bad times. If she yells and cries for seemingly small rea-
sons, there are underlying bigger ones. Stay calm, encourage your child
to talk about her anger, and then refocus and get active on other things.
 An immediate response to your dyslexic child’s behavior is the best
approach. If your child does something out of line, ask her right away
what’s going on. Is she aware of how her behavior seems to you? What’s
her line of thought? If you save your response for later, your child may
not remember the incident in question. If you say something like “You
can’t go to the movie on Friday,” by the time Friday comes, you may
both see the incident in a less harsh light, and besides, your child may
stew on it in the interim period. She may get more and more resentful, so
now you have another situation on your hands.
 Your responses to misdemeanors should be firm and consistent but
manageable. Clearly and calmly tell your dyslexic child why her behav-
ior is unhelpful. Tell her what your response is. Make your consequences
small and helpful (“Instead of watching TV tonight, you must straighten
your room”), not big and reactionary (“No TV for a month!”).
 Give your child consequences only when you feel calm and with the
intention of solving the problem, not blaming the child.
Strengthening bonds between siblings
I often tell my kids that other people in their lives may come and go but sib-
lings are forever. So they’d better get used to the idea and start being nice to
each other! This isn’t of course my most subtle or insightful approach, so I’ll
move on.
Here are some strategies that psychologists recommend for helping your
children talk respectfully to one another, willingly share their stuff, and
refrain from theft of socks, friends, and best ideas. Dyslexia-specific tips are
peppered throughout.
255
Chapter 15: Handling Everyday Activities and Difficulties

 Make sure that everyone in your family understands what dyslexia is
and that your dyslexic child needs enabling rather than protecting.
 Explain to your other children why your dyslexic child needs extra help
with academics and that all of your children get the help they need
rather than an exactly equal share of all things, including your time. Be
sure to explain that the amount of time you give to your children is not a
measure of how much you love each one but a response to need. So that
your nondyslexic child doesn’t feel resentful, make sure you give her
plenty of attention when you can. Giving all your children a few minutes
of your undivided time for talk and hugs at bedtime can be a great way
to help each one feel noticed and valued.
 In sports and family events in which your dyslexic child’s difficulties
make little or no difference, treat your children the same.
 Listen to your children. You can dissolve a child’s jealousy and resent-
ment by hearing her out. Let her say how she feels, even if that includes
hate, so she can vent and move on. Resist the urge to say things like
“You really don’t feel that way” or “You shouldn’t say things like that”
because then your child bottles up those (natural) feelings and they may
grow. The adage “Better out than in” is really what this kind of nonjudg-
mental listening is all about.

Assisting Dyslexic Teens
In This Chapter
 Building your teen’s life skills
 Helping your teen handle schoolwork on his own
 Strengthening your teen’s work skills
M
y daughter is about to become a teenager, and I’m edgy. At any time, I
could make a remark that my almost-teen interprets as teasing or an
outright insult. There could be tears, breakages, and language that’s not very
nice at all, and my daughter gets pretty upset too. But you didn’t buy this
book to read about my teen-raising traumas, so in this chapter I let you off
that particular hook and instead get right down to teen problems that have
dyslexia at their heart.
Dyslexic teens have more self-esteem issues than other teens do; they have
to learn to speak out about difficulties they’d sooner hide (so they receive
help), and on top of that, they have to work even harder at school than regu-
lar overloaded high school students do. In this chapter, you find out about
these and other issues facing dyslexic teens.
Instilling New Life Skills
Your teenager is surging bumpily forward into adulthood. He’s learning a
mountain of new things fast (like how to speak in monosyllables and grunts
and buy sneakers that look like the rest but cost three times as much) and
can make you feel like you were the only one who didn’t get the memo. Much
as I sympathize, I leave all that in your capable hands, and in the next few
sections confine myself to the big, dyslexia-related questions that relate to
new life skills. How can you help your self-conscious dyslexic teen feel good
when his dyslexia makes him look “dumb”? How can you persuade him to
become more independent? When he feels good, dyslexia and all, where will
you hide your car keys?

Aiming for high self-esteem
Poor self-confidence blocks your child’s learning. I know you’ve heard that to
death, so I won’t keep you long. The list that comes next is a lightning review
of things you need to bear in mind when you can’t see the nice child behind
the surly teen and you feel like throttling or at least avoiding him. It’s a dozen
things he could tell you if only his teenage bravado and paralyzing self-
consciousness would loosen its grip.
1. I can figure out problems in my own way if I have enough time.
2. I have my own system for keeping track of school stuff. (Please don’t
move my things.)
3. I don’t deliberately do things wrong or miss doing them altogether. I just
forget and get muddled.
4. I get frustrated. I wish I could do things perfectly, and when I can’t, I
don’t want to do them at all.
5. I try to listen when you talk, but things (like small noises and back-
ground TV) distract me. (If you have something important to tell me,
please choose a quiet time and write me lists.)
6. When my work looks all over the place, remember that I put in twice as
much time and effort as everyone else (even when you don’t see it).
7. If I mess up, I need you to give me a gentle hint. (Please don’t call me
lazy or lose your temper with me.)
8. When you see me acting tough, it’s a fair bet that I still feel dumb inside.
9. It’s hard enough for me to make friends, so please try not to dismiss out
of hand the ones I have.
10. Telling me how other people do things doesn’t help me. It makes me feel
that you don’t like me for who I really am and that you secretly wish I
were them.
11. I have a sense of humor, and it helps me when we joke good-naturedly
about my mistakes and goof-ups.
12. I really, really want to please you.
So how can you build your dyslexic teen’s esteem right back up? Briefly, you
can do wonders for your teen’s self esteem by
 Keeping a positive and respectful tone with him that tells him that he
determines his own progress and development (but that you can help
out too).
 Having him tutored and helping him learn labor-saving strategies like
efficient note taking so he keeps up in class. See “Taking notes,” later in
this chapter, for more info.
260
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

 Helping him keep abreast of technology that may help him. He’s proba-
bly just as informed as you on gadgets (and maybe more!), but you can
at least check out dyslexia Web sites to see what’s new in the way of
devices like handheld spell checkers and speech-to-text software.
Chapter 9 has additional info on technology.
 Helping him feel more independent by making him responsible for 
certain chores (within reasonable limits, given that he gets a lot of
homework) and encouraging him to belong to clubs. See the next sec-
tion for details.
 Working in time for sports, music, and other nonacademic pleasures
(see “Making time for rest and play,” later in this chapter).
 Maintaining your own social life and outside interests so he has a good
role model.
Fostering more independence at home
A few years ago, my morning routine included following my kids around the
house screaming things like “Have you brushed your teeth?” and “Is your bag
packed?” Then I read a magazine article that advised me to pull myself
together. “Just tell your children, calmly, what time it is,” the article said. 
So I did. Now I yell out only digits and chiefly from the kitchen.
My point is that most self-respecting teens have enough sluggishness and
obstinacy in them to wear down the perkiest of parents. They can make
enslaving yourself to them seem like a good idea at the time, and that’s bad.
Your teen must be responsible for getting to places on time and for pouring
the milk on his own cereal. Buy his milk by all means, but beware of volun-
teering as milk and every other kind of monitor.
The more responsibility you give your teen, the more chance he has to rise to
the occasion. Ask him to help you out with chores, like lawn mowing and
taking out the garbage. Allocate him his own tasks and tell him what a weight
he takes off your shoulders. Let him know that you need and value him so
that he wants to please you by being reliable and thorough. When he feels
proud of himself, he takes pride in the things he does and develops traits that
will stand him in good stead in the workplace (see the section “Encouraging
the Development of Work Skills,” later in this chapter, for more details).
Every now and then, parents of capable teenagers lapse. They pick up their
teen’s dirty laundry, remind him to brush his teeth, and race to school with
the lunch he forgot. It’s okay; parenting tends to be like that. You can’t help
overindulging your kids occasionally, but you may want to make a conscious
note to get serious next time. Allowing a teen to be overly dependent on 
you doesn’t help him in the long run because he stops trying to do stuff 
for himself.
261
Chapter 16: Assisting Dyslexic Teens

Making time for rest and play
Teens do a lot of growing, and that, along with all the preening and worrying
they do (chiefly about who’s looking or not looking at them), can sap their
energy. Add to this the burden of having to re-read everything, listen harder to
everything, and refer to a spell checker pretty constantly, and you can easily
see why you need to make sure your dyslexic teen doesn’t burn too much
midnight oil. He actually needs about nine and a half hours of sleep a night!
And if you can see to it that he fits school sports or other type of exercise into
his life too, all the better. Physical activity helps him look and feel good, beat
boredom before it takes hold, and concentrate better back at his desk.
(Chapter 14 has more info about the benefits of exercise for dyslexic kids.)
All work and no play can make Jack not only a dull boy but a sick one, too.
Studies show that school pressure and boredom (and interestingly, too much
spending money!) are risk factors for stress, and stressed teens do more
drinking, smoking, and drug taking than chilled-out teens.
Getting behind the driver’s wheel
Taking a driving test can be nerve-wracking for anyone. If your dyslexic teen
has trouble with left and right and isn’t so great with hand-eye coordination
either, he may be terrified. Here are some ways that you can help him:
 Help solve the left/right problem by using the terms “driver’s side” and
“passenger’s side” instead. You can also try having him write the words
on his hands, remember that his watch hand is his left, or put stickers
on the car windows. Use whatever trick works for your teen!
 Make sure your teen takes plenty of practice written tests.
 Take your teen out for plenty of practice driving.
 Enroll your teen in traffic school or driver education classes.
 Have your teen start driving early. He usually can get a learner’s permit
at age 15 or 16 and may be able to get a regular license as early as 16 in
some states (state laws may vary).
To find out your state’s requirements, resources, and location of the nearest
DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) office, go to www.dmv.org. You can get
practice tests and training material from just about every office, and most
documents are downloadable too.
262
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

Facing School Challenges Head-On
Your teenager has many school-related things to worry about now. Will he
manage to hand his assignments in on time? Has he chosen the right subjects?
Does his hair spike up at just the right angle? You want him to worry enough
that he’s responsible but not enough that you end up with a nervous wreck on
your hands. In the next sections, I tell you how to help your teen rise to new
school challenges with a healthy balance of optimism and realism.
Moving toward self-reliance 
with schoolwork
When your child is in elementary school, you pretty much organize everything
for him. You anticipate his needs. You ask his teachers to make allowances for
him. You make sure that he gets assessed and that his Individualized Education
Program (IEP), if he has one, runs smoothly. (I talk more about IEPs in Chap-
ter 8.)
When you have a teen to care for, your role changes somewhat. You have to
hand over the academic reins because your teen must prepare for taking tests
and doing assignments completely on his own. And he needs to know his own
needs, speak up for himself, and speak up again if need be. Because he’s self-
conscious enough as it is, even before you take his dyslexia into account, he
has quite a lot on his plate! What can you do to make the hand-over go well?
Give your child frequent (and kind) reminders to do the following:
 Jot down to-do lists so that he stays organized.
 Pinpoint his practical needs (“It may take me an extra two days to do
this assignment, and I should get the book on tape”).
 Use all the available gizmos to help him read and write (for example,
spell checkers, laptops, and speech-to-text software — see Chapter 9 for
the scoop on using technology).
 Ask friends to help him in specific ways, like talking about assignments
and reading text out loud.
 Practice describing his dyslexia so he can easily and without embarrass-
ment tell people that he’s dyslexic.
 Remember that he isn’t sponging off other people, causing a nuisance,
or being dumb. He’s explaining himself and asking for reasonable 
consideration.
 Remember that if someone doesn’t help him, someone else will. (There
will always be people who understand him and other people who just
haven’t had that much to do with dyslexics.)
263
Chapter 16: Assisting Dyslexic Teens

Ownership is key. If you do most of your child’s school projects for him, he
feels like a bad grade really isn’t his responsibility. On the other hand, if you
type exactly what he dictates to you and no more, you genuinely help, and he
feels in charge. The work is his alone: a reflection of himself.
Enforcing order on those files
When your child becomes a teen, he must work out his own system for orga-
nizing his schoolwork and change it if it doesn’t work. For example, he can
color-code his homework binder for himself and retrieve his rulers and pens
from Lego city once and for all. It’s important for him to do such tasks
because a system you think up yourself is always more meaningful to you
than a system someone else gives you. You can lend a hand by doing things
like buying storage baskets and other new supplies, but make sure he directs
you or at least does most of the brainwork. For more info on managing home-
work, see Chapter 9.
And in case you think there’s not much for you to do, remember that you
need a plan to assure that your teen stays organized, like linking his tele-
phone rights to his orderly desk, in case things fall into disarray.
Staying on top of all the 
reading and writing
Dyslexia hits your child hardest when he’s reading and writing. By the time
your child reaches his teen years, he has developed a lot of (hopefully good)
coping mechanisms. Here are some strategies to help with reading and writ-
ten projects:
 Have a quiet, properly equipped study area. It can include items such as
a big working surface, pens, reference books, a computer, and a printer.
 Plan out long-term assignments by setting interim deadlines on a calen-
dar or in an assignments notebook.
 Ask for extra time (as an upfront condition or as necessary) to complete
assignments.
 Read and reread all text. Talk about it with friends so you’re sure you’ve
read it correctly and gotten the gist.
 Find your preferred way of taking notes (in class and as you read home-
work assignments). I talk about this in the next section.
 Get curriculum books on tape (from Recording for the Blind and
Dyslexic at www.rfbd.org, phone 800-221-4792).
264
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

 Mark books and worksheets with highlighting markers or self-stick notes
to make key points prominent (but guard against marking just about the
entire page!).
 Type your assignments whenever you can to cut down the amount of
handwriting you have to do. Check on whether this is okay with all your
teachers at the start of the year so you don’t have to ask about each
assignment further down the track.
 Ask a friend to proofread your writing (handwritten and typewritten).
 Use a spell checker on typewritten assignments.
 Use speech-to-text software to speak (not write) text into your computer,
a graphic organizer to plan out assignments, and any other technology
that makes life easier for you.
A graphic organizer helps your child build flow charts and maps to rep-
resent information diagrammatically. You can download, for free, all
sorts of pie charts, bar graphs, and other diagrams at www.edhelper.
com/teachers/graphic_organizers.htm, or you can get software
that enables your child to design his own creations. One such organizer
is Smart Draw software (available in basic editions for $200 or a suite
edition for $300) at www.smartdraw.com. For software priced at $70 for
the regular CD-ROM and less for palm and pocket versions, check out
another graphic organizer, Inspiration (for grades 6–12), at www.kid
spiration.com. You get a 30-day free trial on all these programs.
If you’re lucky, your teen has developed some good reading and writing
strategies by now. So what strategies are not productive?
 If your child denies having dyslexia or maybe isn’t aware that his prob-
lems are dyslexia (see Chapter 3 for symptoms), that’s not helpful. The
sooner he can tag the word “dyslexia” onto his problems, the sooner he
can let out a sigh of relief (“Now I can prove I’m not just ‘dumb’!”) and
get on with asking for help. If you have a teen who persistently denies
the possibility that he has dyslexia, you can take action in a few ways.
• You can ask him to check out teen information about dyslexia on
the Web; one site to try is www.kidshealth.org/teen. Click on
“Diseases & Conditions.”
• You can ask him to go with you to see a counselor, psychologist, or
dyslexia therapist.
• You can decide to go along with your teen because the stress of a
prolonged argument may outweigh the potential benefits (espe-
cially if your child has only mild symptoms).
 If your child acts up in class or sinks into the background to avoid detec-
tion, that’s not helpful. He needs reassurance that he’s perfectly fine 
but has a problem processing (reading, writing, hearing, and recalling)
words. The problem is manageable, but he needs to learn to ask for help.
265
Chapter 16: Assisting Dyslexic Teens

 If your child avoids reading and writing, he won’t improve. You can 
help him read by doing paired reading with him (see Chapter 13). A com-
puter and good keyboarding skills go a long way toward making him a
happy writer. For learn-to-type software, check out Typing Pal at www.
software.typingpal.com. (Chapter 9 has additional info on the use
of technology.)
 If your child copies answers from other kids and so covers up his prob-
lems (dyslexics are masters of coverup), he won’t improve. He needs
extra help, and you may want to get advice from his teacher about the
best ways to provide it. (Chapter 10 has details on working productively
with your child’s teacher.)
 If your child isn’t getting help with phonemic awareness and phonics, he
won’t improve. (Phonemic awareness is the awareness that words are
made of sounds. Phonics is making sound-letter associations. Dyslexics
learn to read best by being guided systematically through the alphabetic
system — how single letters and clusters of letters represent sounds.)
Arrange for a tutor and/or help your child yourself. In Chapter 12, I give
you practical advice for helping your child with phonics at home.
Taking notes
Your high school student needs to learn to take great notes. He needs to find
out what kind of note taking suits him and what he should and shouldn’t be
jotting down. In the following sections, I talk about the whys, whats, and
hows of getting the main stuff down on paper and leaving out the frills.
Clarifying the importance of note taking
Your teenager needs to be especially good at taking notes for the following
reasons:
 It forces him to listen carefully and test his understanding of the material.
 It forces him to identify key and secondary points.
 Personal notes are easier to remember than text.
 Writing important points down helps him remember them even before
he studies them.
 Note-taking skills are important to master before heading to college.
Narrowing down essential points
High school students often get obvious clues about what they should be jot-
ting down. For example, teachers may give the following signs that something
is important:
266
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

 Words they write on the board
 Words and concepts they repeat
 Concepts they emphasize by their tone or by the amount of time spent
on them
 Concepts they organize with “clue” words such as “first,” “second,” and
“in conclusion”
 Overviews they give at the beginning of a lesson and summaries they
give at the end
Saving time and trouble
If your child’s notes are concise and follow a consistent pattern, he doesn’t
have to rewrite or struggle to figure out what they mean later on. These tips
can help get the note taking just about right the first time:
 Keep it short. Use a phrase instead of a sentence, or a word instead of a
phrase.
 Pick out the meat of the subject and forget the trimmings.
 Think a minute about what you’re going to write instead of taking notes
just to be taking notes.
 Keep related notes in one book, not on scattered pieces of paper.
 Use abbreviations and symbols, but use them consistently. You may
want to keep some sort of master list of symbols to avoid later 
confusion.
 Put most notes, except for facts and formulas, into your own words.
 Indent and number your points.
 If you miss something, just write down a keyword, leave a space for the
details, and fill in the blanks later.
 Leave space around your writing in case you want to add some notes
later.
 Date your notes and number your pages.
 Look over your notes soon after you take them. Add extra information
that you recall as important and rewrite unclear notes.
 Review your notes regularly. You need to hear/see/do several repetitions
of a point before you really remember it.
If your child has severe dyslexic symptoms, he may want to use accommoda-
tions, such as tape-recording lessons (see Chapter 9), having a buddy or a
note taker, or even having a teacher provide a written outline that he can add
to as he listens.

Chapter 16: Assisting Dyslexic Teens

Using a specific method
Want to check out a few methods for note taking? Go to the Student
Academic Services section of the California Polytechnic State University Web
site at www.sas.calpoly.edu/asc/ssl/notetaking.systems.html
and get a rundown of the following techniques:
 Charting method: The charting method is for subjects like science that
lend themselves to column headings (like “animal,” “habitat,” “food,”
and “population”). You jot down headings in advance and then fit brief
phrases into the correct columns.
 Cornell method: Divide your paper into a 2-inch column on the left and a
6-inch column on the right. During class, take notes in the 6-inch column.
When the teacher moves to a new point, skip a few lines. After class, add
more to your notes, and for every significant bit of information, write a
couple of key words in the left margin. To review, cover your notes, leaving
the key words visible. Say the key words out loud and then say as much as
you can of the material beneath the card. Move the card and see if you
were right on most points. The more you can say, the more you know.
 Mapping method: If you like to draw headings with arrows and balloons
branching from them, you’re using the mapping method. This method
helps make text look more attractive and bite-sized, but you need plenty
of practice so your nice balloons don’t get into a nasty tangle when you
add more information.
 Outline method: This method is good for subjects like science in which
you’re given facts that you can classify into headings of different levels
of importance. You create an outline of the material by writing it in head-
ings that get more indented to signify subdivisions.
 Sentence method: If you receive a lot of information in a subject and
don’t have time to figure out main and secondary points, the sentence
method is good. Write down sentences, each one on a separate line. You
end up with a lot of sentences, but they’re more concise than whole
paragraphs, and the gaps help you clearly see and edit your notes later.
Studying the right foreign language
Most high schools (and colleges, for that matter) require a few years of for-
eign language study to graduate. But learning a foreign language is hard for a
dyslexic, so when your child takes French, Spanish, or any other language at
school, he needs extra help and time with assignments. These general tips
may make the learning easier:
 The easiest foreign languages for dyslexics to learn are phonetically reg-
ular languages, like German, and possibly the nonalphabetic languages,
like Chinese and Japanese (although no research is available on this
latter info, just anecdotes).
268
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

German is phonetically regular because it’s a what-you-see-is-what-you-
get language. German words typically have only one pronunciation, so
you don’t have to learn rules like “this letter sounds this way except if
it’s next to this or that letter or has an accent mark above it.” French and
Spanish are more variable. Talk to a language teacher or two to receive
expert advice.
 Many dyslexic students take sign language to fulfill language require-
ments at school. This is a good option because your child gets to use his
visual and motor skills, and there’s no reading and writing involved.
Nearly all states offer American Sign Language (ASL) as a credited for-
eign language course, but you need to find out if your school, and not
just universities or other schools in your state, offers it. For more infor-
mation, check out the Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center at
http://clerccenter.gallaudet.edu/InfoToGo/051ASL.html.
 The best way to help your child read and write in English is to teach him
a structured phonics program through multisensory techniques, and the
same methods work for learning a foreign language. (When your child
uses a few senses, like seeing, hearing, and doing, at the same time, he
learns in a “multisensory” way.) A good foreign language teacher for
your child is one who has kids doing things like naming objects while
they touch them, writing words in the air as they say them, and role-
playing while they read and say their lines. See Chapter 14 for more
about multisensory activities.
One way to find out what the teachers at your teen’s school do is to chat
with other parents. Talk to the teachers too and explain (nicely) that
multisensory teaching is important to you.
 A dyslexic learner needs plenty of reinforcement and consolidation of
information. He needs to practice the same foreign words and phrases
often, in different guises, like in quizzes and role-play, and it helps if the
teacher speaks slowly and clearly in class.
 Dyslexic learners may have trouble with small, tightly spaced print in
any class, but in a foreign language class (where everything’s really
foreign to him!), it’s worse. A sensitive teacher uses a large, plain, 
well-spaced font and plenty of diagrams.
 Computer software is a great tool for foreign language classes. For soft-
ware that tutors your child in a foreign language, check out the Rosetta
Stone programs at www.rosettastone.com, The Level 1 CD-ROM 
costs $195.
For a teenager who’s still struggling with reading and writing in English and is
already years below in reading, learning a foreign language can be a huge
struggle. An exemption from taking a foreign language if the school doesn’t
offer sign language may be an option.
269
Chapter 16: Assisting Dyslexic Teens

Giving great speeches
Some important speech giver once said that there’s no such thing as a clever
speech, one-liner, or witty quip that’s unrehearsed. Whoever that guy was,
I’m willing to believe him. Every year I give a few talks to parents and teach-
ers and know much better than to start cold with no preparation. I practice
what I say and how I link my key points together. I jot down key words, transi-
tioning phrases that get me from one topic to the next, and always, always,
the name of the person I have to thank for inviting me. And even then I’m still
nervous!
So if public speaking makes me nervous, it’s a fair bet that your dyslexic teen
feels even more anxious if he has to talk in front of others. Encourage your
teen to practice giving talks. Help him jot down (on one sheet of paper or a
few cue cards) key words. Have him make marks that remind him where to
pause, change his intonation, and slow down. When he’s nervous, every little
cue or prompt helps.
Giving speeches is an important task for teens because they get asked to give
so many of them in class. Your dyslexic teen may find presentations even
more daunting than other kids do because he has to write and read cue cards
and may have trouble remembering the words he wants to use, especially
when he’s on the spot and has only a few minutes to speak.
Planning for college and jobs
When I was a little girl, I made myself a typewriter (one of those things
people used before they had computers) from an egg box. I turned a card-
board egg box upside down, wrote letters on the pointy bits, and “typed”
contentedly. Years later, when it was time to select my high school subjects, I
chose typing and a bunch of soft subjects with names like Darning for Hubby.
Then a nasty careers counselor snatched my subject sheet right out from
under my nose. She ran her red pen through my selections and asserted,
“You don’t want to be a typist. Be a teacher.” And so I never did learn to type
at school but instead sat through difficult politics and biology classes, and
several years, and many tricky subjects later, I became a teacher.
Your child may set his sights lower than he’s really capable of and may not
have a vigilant careers counselor there to put him on the right track, so you
need to be vigilant just in case. Even if he doesn’t plan to go to college, he
can keep his options open by choosing school subjects that don’t limit him.
And you can help him start thinking about work skills and how to appeal to
employers, too. (I show you how to help your dyslexic teen develop strong
work skills in the next section.)
270
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

Many teens don’t visit the college/career counselor at their school until the
last couple years at high school, if at all. Advise your child to take this step
early on (during freshman year) and let the counselor know about his
dyslexia. The counselor can help your teen start thinking about his future,
whether it’s choosing a career, deciding on a college/university, looking for a
part-time job or volunteer opportunities, finding out about military options,
or exploring trades and vocational education programs. The counselor also
has information on college/career fairs held in your area and when recruiters
will be visiting your school. And more! For additional info on preparing for
(and succeeding in) college, check out Chapter 17.
And if your teen has an IEP, this planning for the future is part of it. Because
this planning is such an important detail, you’ll want to make sure that it’s
really happening. See Chapter 8 for more IEP info.
Encouraging the Development 
of Work Skills
Your teen has huge demands placed on him at this point in his life. He has to
work hard to make good grades in school and also spend time and effort
developing all-important work skills in areas outside school. In high school,
your teen makes subject choices and may be expected to start chalking up
community service hours in order to graduate. You can also encourage him
to participate in extracurricular activities or help him get a part-time job or
other work experience.
Obtaining work skills during the teen years is essential because employers
and college interview panels want to hear that your child has an impressive
work history. I cover options for gaining work skills in the following sections.
Keeping up with extracurricular activities
Have your dyslexic teen keep up with extracurricular activities because sports
and leisure interests keep him happy and healthy and look great on his
resume (see the sidebar “Writing a knockout resume,” later in this chapter).
Additional benefits of participating in these activities include the following:
 Finding an activity that he likes can boost his self-esteem.
 It can lead him toward a future college major or job.
271
Chapter 16: Assisting Dyslexic Teens

 Success in an activity can inspire him to put more effort into schoolwork.
 Extracurricular activities teach skills like teamwork, punctuality, and
self-discipline that are important in the workplace.
Help your child divide his time sensibly between schoolwork and extracurric-
ular activities. Otherwise, he’ll be running from one extracurricular activity
to another and not devoting enough time or energy to his homework.
Doing some good with community service
Community service holds sway with colleges and future employers, and most
schools ask students to complete unpaid community service hours in order
to graduate. What’s in it for your dyslexic child?
 Your teen gets the chance to pick practically any placement he wants
(though his school may help him secure placements if he’s short on 
contacts).
 He builds confidence (especially if he’s doing hands-on work and no
reading or writing).
 He’s treated well. Everyone loves a volunteer!
 He learns job skills under less stressful conditions than if he were get-
ting paid.
 He may be able to use the contacts he makes as references for job 
applications.
 He may decide he wants to find paid work in the same field and can ask
questions more freely than if he were a paid employee (who wants to
keep his job!).
Finding a part-time job
The most straightforward way for a teen to develop work skills and explore
potential careers is to find a part-time job. Dyslexic kids usually enjoy having
weekend and evening jobs, especially if they work with friendly, supportive
people. Help your teen make wise choices, fill out application forms, and do
plenty of mock interviews. To help both of you make a wise choice, here are a
few considerations you’ll want to keep in mind. If they sound like words of cau-
tion, they are, but don’t forget that even though you must protect your child as
much as you can without suffocating him, he receives great experience in paid
work and huge kudos among his friends. And for a teen, how cool is that?
272
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

 Your dyslexic teen may want to steer completely clear of reading and
writing tasks. If this is the case, you need to make sure that he won’t be
required to fill out forms, write reports, or do any other regular pen-and-
paper work.
 Your child’s first paid job is exciting but nerve-racking. His entry into the
workforce may be easier if someone he knows is on site. Ask friends and
neighbors if they can offer your teen a job in their workplaces.
 Money is a sensitive issue. Discuss rates of pay with your child upfront.
What’s the minimum wage? If an employer doesn’t pay your child for his
work, what should he do? If your teen is self-employed and does jobs
like lawn mowing or baby-sitting, what does he charge for his services,
and does he make any exceptions?
If your child is self-employed, you may want to role-play his first conver-
sation with clients. He must learn to tell people his rates and conditions
without embarrassment or delay, and that can be hard for anyone!
 A paid job means that your teen has to be there when he says he’ll be
there, and on time. He needs to carefully plan his entire life! How many
hours are set aside for homework, paid work, sports, and the like? And
has he factored in commuting time?
273
Chapter 16: Assisting Dyslexic Teens
Writing a knockout resume
A resume (pronounced “rez-oo-may”) is one or
two sheets of clear typeface that briefly outlines
your teen’s accomplishments. If your teen
writes one at high school to find a part-time job,
it’s great practice for later resumes and helps
him keep track of all the things he does. Your
teen needs to keep the following things in mind
when he writes his resume:
 It must be typed in see-at-a-glance style 
(a bit like this list).
 It must answer the key question “Will this
applicant add value to my company?”
 It must emphasize your teen’s strengths,
especially the strengths that relate directly
to the job he’s applying for.
 It should include positive personal charac-
teristics, technical and computer skills,
educational accomplishments, and skills
and experience gained from internships
and work, including unpaid work.
 Your teen can show his human side by men-
tioning his hobbies. If they relate to the job
your teen is applying for, all the better.
 Resume design is just as important as con-
tent. Your teen’s resume has about 20 sec-
onds to make the right impression.
To get ideas for resume layout and content, your
teen can go to the library and look at books
specifically written for students. He can use a
computer template, but if he does, his resume
will look just like everyone else’s! You can also
check out Resumes For Dummies by Joyce Lain
Kennedy (Wiley).

 Your child may be so excited to get a job and so eager to please his
employer that he’s an easy target for people who aren’t so honorable.
Explain to him that even though he’s young and expected to show
respect, a good work attitude, and a small measure of servitude (he’s
probably last in the pecking order), he must be treated fairly. And if he’s
not treated fairly, there’s no shame in it, and he must tell you.
At the risk of sounding alarmist, keep a watchful eye on your teen when
he starts a job. Hazing — the practice of making rookies go through abu-
sive initiation rituals — happens in the workplace as well as in schools,
colleges, and the armed forces. If your child happens to be shy and
dyslexic, he may be an easy target for unscrupulous or weird folks.

Heading Off to College
In This Chapter
 Building a portfolio
 Finding facts about majors and schools
 Narrowing your focus to several colleges
 Understanding the application process
 Selecting the right school
 Looking for financing and tips for success
Your dyslexic child knows what it’s like to work harder than other people.
She’s used to spending long hours on homework and never can cruise
through school tests even though she’s bright and diligent. As a result,
maybe her teachers have told her to set her sights low. But you and your
daughter both want her to go to college, so how can you reach that goal?
In this chapter you hear how to help her aim high and do all the things that
good colleges want their prospective students to do. I give you the lowdown
on building a portfolio, researching schools and majors, contacting specific
colleges for info, and going through the application process. I also help you
out with tips on selecting the best school out there, finding financing, and
successfully sending your teen into the college world.
Keeping a Well-Stocked Portfolio
Colleges and universities want to see the following information about your
child:
 Dyslexia assessments
 Academic results
 Community involvement and extracurricular activities

So that your child has all the documentation she needs, help her start a port-
folio early on (during her freshman year of high school). A portfolio is simply
a file or folder full of important documentation. Make sure your child puts
her (still crisp and clean) paperwork into the portfolio as soon as possible
after she obtains them and makes copies just in case. The following sections
cover all three types of documentation in more detail.
Providing proof of dyslexia
Your dyslexic child’s transition from high school to college is different from
that of most kids because she needs to ask the college to make accommoda-
tions for her, such as the following:
 Extra time on tests
 Extra time on essays
 Questions read out loud to her
 Test questions written in large print
 Permission to give oral rather than written answers to test questions
To get accommodations, your child must qualify for disability services by
submitting her dyslexia assessment results to the disability or student ser-
vices office of the school she applies to.
Even if your child has been assessed for dyslexia in school, your documenta-
tion has to be up-to-date. Most colleges want documentation that has been
completed within three years of college entrance, so a test like the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children (taken when the child is 5 to 16 years old) may
be no good. She may need to take a new test, like the WAIS-R (Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale-Revised). Check with the colleges of your teen’s choice to
see whether you need to get adult tests done now.
If your child hasn’t yet been assessed for dyslexia in school, you can still get
an assessment now. Submit a written request for an assessment to your
school administration office. I talk about assessment in detail in Chapter 6.
If you want your child assessed for dyslexia after she’s enrolled in a college,
you typically pay a private psychologist. Colleges can give you (when you
ask) lists of psychologists who test for dyslexia, but colleges don’t help with
payment.
If your child didn’t get special education in high school, she probably won’t
get accommodations in college. Colleges typically ask for dyslexia test results
and a proven history of having received special education services through-
out her school years. Students who don’t receive special education services in
high school (because they attended private schools with informal assistance
276
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

or received private tutoring) may qualify for accommodations in college 
if they have an independent diagnosis of dyslexia with recommended 
accommodations.
For more about the support that dyslexics can receive from colleges, see the
section “Asking about disability programs,” later in this chapter.
Gathering academic results
Just like any other student applying to college, your child must provide the
following paperwork:
 A high school diploma or General Educational Development (GED) 
certificate
 American College Testing (ACT) or Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT)
scores
 Letters of recommendation
Naturally, your child is already working toward her high school diploma. The
good news is that she can get accommodations when she takes the tests, and
you can help her with her letters of recommendation. In the next sections, I
explain exactly how.
Receiving a high school diploma or taking the GED
Getting a high school diploma can be hard for a dyslexic child, but in some
states it’s now especially hard. Why, you ask? Kids must take an exit exam in
order to get their diploma, and your dyslexic child may run into trouble with
the exam. She may, for example, have all the math requirements for her
diploma but fail math on the exit exam because in that test she’s not allowed
to use a calculator.
It’s possible to gain a reprieve from exit exams. A lawsuit filed in 2001 ended
in the San Francisco Superior Court in August 2005 with an agreement that
many dyslexic high school seniors can graduate without passing California’s
exit exam. For details, check out www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.
cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/08/27/MNG9OEEDK41.DTL.
All sorts of things can go wrong, but if they do, your child still has the GED
option. Most colleges accept a GED as the equivalent of a high school diploma.
To take the GED, your child pays a fee (currently $75 for the battery of five
tests: Language Arts Reading, Language Arts Writing, Social Studies, Science,
Mathematics I and II) and then takes the tests at a testing center in your state.

Succeeding on entrance exams
If your child is going to college, she’ll have to take an entrance exam. The two
most popular college entrance exams are the ACT and the SAT. (Some col-
leges also require subject-specific SAT II tests for admission. Your child must
check out the exact requirements of each college she plans to apply to.) So
what’s the difference between the ACT and the SAT?
 The ACT, the most common college entrance test, takes three hours. It
measures what a student has learned in school and has up to five com-
ponents: English, mathematics, reading, science (all multiple-choice
tests), and an optional writing test (which takes an additional 30 min-
utes). If your child gets a low score on the ACT, she can retake it several
times and ask for her highest score to be sent to prospective colleges.
To help prepare for the ACT, check out The ACT For Dummies, by
Michelle Gilman, Veronica Saydak, and Suzee Vlk (published by Wiley).
For official ACT information, go to www.act.org.
 The SAT, which is more of an aptitude test, takes three hours and forty-
five minutes. It tests three components: critical reading, mathematics,
and writing. Each component is split into three parts, including a sepa-
rately timed 25-minute essay. You may hear the SAT called the “new” SAT
because the format was updated in March 2005. You may also hear the
test called the SAT Reasoning Test to distinguish it from additional 
subject-specific SAT tests your child can take.
Just like with the ACT test, your child can retake the SAT several times
and ask for her highest score to be sent to her prospective college. For
help with SAT preparation, see The SAT I For Dummies, by Geraldine
Woods, published by Wiley; www.collegeboard.com; and http://
collegeapps.about.com/od/sat/a/SATformat.htm.
Colleges accept both ACT and SAT tests, according to preference and tradi-
tions. Individual states tend to stick with one or the other, but it’s possible
for your child to take both.
Your child can register to take the ACT or SAT online or by getting the paper
registration from the school guidance counselor. For online ACT registration
and study information, visit www.act.org. For online SAT registration and
study information, visit www.collegeboard.com. Your child must register
278
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

at least six weeks in advance of each test. Students usually register for the
SAT or ACT in their junior year and repeat the test in the senior year. Some
students elect to take both the SAT and ACT.
Your dyslexic teen can receive the following accommodations on both of
these tests:
 Extra time
 Testing by herself
 Extra and/or longer breaks
 Questions read to her
 Large-print text
 Permission to use a computer, tape recorder, or calculator
To get the accommodations in school, enlist the help of the school guidance
counselor about three months before testing (because the processing of your
completed documents takes several weeks). The processes for requesting
accommodations on the ACT and the SAT are similar.
 For accommodations on the ACT, the guidance counselor needs to help
you complete a request form from the national ACT office. You must
decide between two forms:
• The Application for Extended Time National Testing Form, which
enables your child to have more time to complete the ACT
• The Request for ACT Special Testing Form, which gives your child
one-on-one testing with accommodations like having questions
read out loud to her
You fill out part of the form, and the school completes the rest. The guid-
ance counselor sends the form to the national ACT office (together with
evidence that your child has dyslexia), and it goes through a review
process. The board then sends you and the school a letter saying
whether accommodations have been granted. For full details, visit the
national ACT Web site at www.act.org, or call 319-337-1270.
 To apply for accommodations for taking the SAT, the guidance counselor
needs to help you complete a Student Eligibility Form. He gives you two
pages of the Student Eligibility Form to fill out; the school completes the
remaining two pages. The guidance counselor sends the form to the
College Board (together with evidence that your child has dyslexia), and
it goes through a review process that takes seven weeks. The board then
sends you and the school a letter saying whether accommodations have
been granted. For full details, visit the College Board Services for Students
with Disabilities at www.collegeboard.com/ssd/student/index.
html or call 609-771-7137.
279
Chapter 17: Heading Off to College

Your child’s eligibility for accommodations on the SAT expires after one
year. If she retakes the SAT more than one year since she received
approval for accommodations, she must submit another Student
Eligibility Form and go through the application process again.
You must maintain up-to-date evidence of your child’s dyslexia. Without it,
your child could be denied accommodations when she takes ACT and SAT
tests even if she received services at school for years. See the section
“Providing proof of dyslexia,” earlier in this chapter, for more info.
If you get into any disputes about asking for accommodations, ask to see the
school Section 504 officer. (Find out more about Section 504 in Chapter 8.) If
that option doesn’t work, you may want to see your district superintendent
or contact an organization like The International Dyslexia Association (IDA).
It has members who have been through the same kinds of processes, people
who will advocate for you, and connections with disability lawyers. Find
more info about this group in Appendix B.
If your child left school without taking tests and wants to take them now, she
can go to a test center. Test centers located in every state should let your
child have accommodations, but she has to submit a written request and evi-
dence of her dyslexia well in advance and must pay a fee (currently $28 for
the ACT, $42 for the ACT plus the writing exam, and $41.50 for the SAT).
The National Center for Fair and Open Testing lists colleges that don’t ask your
dyslexic child to submit test results but instead weigh other factors, such as
her school record, letters of recommendation, community involvement, special
talents, and application essay. Check it out at www.fairtest.org.
Requesting letters of recommendation
The final documentation your child needs in the academic area is letters of
recommendation. Help your child ask for letters of recommendation from
people like teachers and counselors two or three months before the deadline
for submitting them (teachers don’t like being pestered close to school
break!). Role-play with her so she gets really good at approaching people and
at succinctly and politely stating her case, and help her provide the writer
with the right documentation to support it. Your child needs to provide con-
tact information of the college she’s applying to and details of specific
strengths and achievements she would like mentioned. Later on, she should
send the writer a thank-you note too.
For a checklist of items to have all sewn up before you approach a teacher or
counselor for a recommendation, go to www.iusd.k12.ca.us/uhs/new/
LetterofRec.html. For advice and sample letters, go to www.boxfree
concepts.com/reco.
280
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

Giving evidence of school and 
community involvement
As soon as your child starts high school, she can start filling her portfolio
with evidence of her superhuman community involvement. Community
involvement documents are pamphlets, awards, or letters that show her
involvement in activities that benefit people, like participating in charity
runs, helping at scout meetings, and serving food at soup kitchens.
Remind your child that she’s probably far more involved in the community
than she thinks because every club membership she has or good deed she
does around the neighborhood can count. Have your child grab a pen and
paper and jot down things like the following:
 Participating in organizations like:
• Scouts
• School clubs
• Religious organizations
 Being involved in music groups, such as bands and choirs
 Helping at fairs and festivals
 Dog walking
 Lawn mowing
 Baby-sitting
 Delivering newspapers
Help her ask for brochures and letters to prove what she does (or recently
did) and have her put them into her portfolio in the sections she labels with
names like “Work experience,” “Social interests,” “Sports achievements,” and
“Community service.” Later your child can condense this information into a
concise one- or two-page summary that goes at the front of the portfolio.
When she writes this summary, help her use action words and phrases such
as “achieved,” “implemented,” “organized,” “was responsible for,” “partici-
pated in,” and “developed.” She needs to showcase her achievements, and
sentences such as “I helped with soccer coaching” sound less impressive
than “I instructed 20 elementary schoolchildren in key soccer skills.”
The condensed summary helps your child fill out college applications (see
the section “Completing applications with ease,” later in this chapter) and
provides an introduction sheet for any person reading the portfolio. An index
along with the summary is good too.

Chapter 17: Heading Off to College

Researching Majors and Schools
Your child chooses a major according to her interests. But she also must take
a look at the duration of courses, the costs, and the location. In the following
sections, I give you a closer look at all of these issues.
Deciding on potential fields of interest
What subjects should your child choose to study? To answer that question,
your child must weigh her strengths against the career she’s interested in to
see if they’re a good fit. If they’re not well suited, she should reassess her
choice.
Some people maintain that dyslexics are suited to architecture and engineer-
ing because they have great spatial skills and the ability to visualize things in
three dimensions. Another field generally thought to suit dyslexics is the
arts, but that may be because actors and singers are in the public eye, and
people therefore hear about those celebrities’ dyslexia. Just as many people
in other fields have dyslexia too!
Your child can probably surf the Internet better than you, and she gets career
information from the school guidance counselor, but you have real-life work
experience. Tell her about different jobs and their pros and cons. Go with her
to job fairs, career days, and college nights at her school.
If you have friends in jobs your child is interested in, try to arrange some
work experience. For details about finding a part-time job, see Chapter 16.
Examining different types of colleges
Your child can choose to apply to three main kinds of colleges:
 Two-year college
 Community college
 Four-year college
To get accepted into a four-year college, your child needs better test scores
than she needs for a two-year or community college, and the more desirable
the major or school, the higher the scores she needs. I cover your teen’s col-
lege options in the following sections.
282
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

Students should start researching college options during their sophomore
and junior years of high school. Your child should ask the school guidance
counselor for help with finding good colleges, the qualifications they want,
and the disability services they offer (see the section “Asking about disability
programs,” later in this chapter, for details). She should read college Web
sites too and start gathering brochures. For lists of dyslexia-friendly colleges,
visit the Dyslexic Adult Link Web site at www.dyslexia-adults.com/a16.
html and the LD Resources site at www.ldresources.org. For a list of col-
leges of excellence (determined by a board of experts and students) and
answers to all sorts of college-related questions, visit the Colleges of
Distinction site at www.collegesofdistinction.com.
Two-year colleges
Students go to a two-year college to prepare for further education or to learn
an occupational skill.
 If you study for an Associate of Arts (AA) degree, you can transfer into a
four-year college or university and receive credit for your AA.
 If you study for an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree, it’s usu-
ally occupation-specific (like an automotive technician degree), so you
go straight into a job with it. Sometimes you can transfer to a four-year
college with an AAS.
If your child thinks she may want to go to four-year college later, she needs to
check (by calling your nearest four-year college) that the qualification or
coursework she gets at a two-year college really is transferable. If she wants
to work in a trade such as hairstyling or mechanics, she needs to verify with
someone working in that job (a manager rather than a shop-floor worker) or
with the trade association for that job (search for it on the Web) that the two-
year college degree actually will count.
Another kind of two-year college is a private junior college. Your child pays
hefty fees here (and it may be residential), but she may be able to take a
course that isn’t available at your nearest public college, such as a hairstyling
course with hours that fit in with her current job.
Community colleges
In community colleges, your child can study just about any subject (such as
flower arranging, writing, and word processing) including occupations, like
hotel management, computer programming, or dental assisting. Most com-
munity colleges have remedial or developmental courses to help your child
upgrade her basic academic skills. She can take these courses either before
enrolling in the specialty classes or concurrently. For more info, contact the
student services office of the nearest community college.
283
Chapter 17: Heading Off to College

Four-year colleges
Your child goes to a four-year college to earn a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) or a
Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree. These degrees will enable her to get higher-
level jobs, such as teacher, dentist, doctor, and lawyer (though she’ll have to
go to school longer than four years to qualify for those last three jobs).
You sometimes hear college programs called “undergraduate.” An undergrad-
uate is a person who hasn’t yet earned a bachelor’s degree. After you have a
B.S. or B.A., you can return to college as a graduate student to get a higher
degree called a master’s or, highest of all, a Ph.D. With these pick-of-the crop
degrees, you’re looking at jobs like professor, CEO, and scientist.
Before your child opts to attend a four-year college, she should go through
the pros and cons with the school guidance counselor. He can outline general
issues that all students face and the special issues that your child may face
because of her dyslexia (like extra-long study hours). College student ser-
vices offices can also discuss issues with your child, and she gets a feel for
how helpful each college is.
Focusing on Target Schools
So your dyslexic teen has a few ideas about what she wants to study and
the specific schools she wants to see. What do you do next? In the following
sections, I tell you about visiting the campuses of your teen’s choice and
requesting specific information about disability programs.
Touring campuses
The only way to make a good college match for your child is to narrow down
your search to two or three colleges and visit them. You want to see the acad-
emic facilities and the people who will be helping your child, and your child
should have a few specific questions ready to ask. Do I have to pay extra for
special services? How big are the classes? Is a disability tutor available to
help me with my major subject?
Go to official college information days and spend time walking around
campus. Check out the dormitories, cafeterias, bulletin and public notice
boards, and local shops. When your child narrows down her search to two or
three favorite colleges, visit each campus several times just to hang out and
get the feel and lay of the land. Strike up conversations with students if you
can so you get the unrehearsed version of what’s really “going down.”
284
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

Asking about disability programs
Your child can find out more about how a college of her choice can meet her
needs as a dyslexic by e-mailing, calling, or visiting student/disability services.
Every college campus has something called an office of disability services or
something similar (like student support services or student access office)
that gives the same disability help. Your child needs to know just how strong
a college’s disability support services are.
College is all about independence, and if your child wants services, she must
find out where the office is, walk over there with her documentation, and ask
for them. To save herself legwork, she should first call and ask, “What ser-
vices does your disability program provide?” Here are the types of services
usually offered:
 If a college has a “comprehensive” disability program, it offers your child
a lot of help that probably includes a learning center and several disabil-
ity staff members. Your child can get help doing her assignments, and
the staff may get course requirements modified for her if she needs that.
 If a college offers disability services, it gives your child help but not the
intensive kind she gets in a comprehensive disability program. If she
needs only a little help (such as being able to tape-record lectures), dis-
ability services may be fine for her.
So that your child is clear about how she can get help and what that help may
entail, she should ask the disability services office additional questions like:
 Can I make arrangements for accommodations with each of my 
professors?
 Will disability services help me talk to professors if necessary?
 Do I need to fill out paperwork to receive services?
 Does the school have a writing lab or other helpful facilities?
Handling the Application and 
Interview Process
All students, whether or not they’re dyslexic, want to fill out application
forms competently, write brilliant application essays, and breeze through
interviews with flair and verve. For your dyslexic child, those tasks can take
extra preparation and commitment. In the following sections, I give you prac-
tical advice for helping your teen present herself in the best light.
285
Chapter 17: Heading Off to College

Completing applications with ease
Your child’s college application tells everything about her in succinct but
glowing terms. To be an early decision applicant, she starts on the applica-
tion (both the form and the essay) at the beginning of senior year.
Filling out forms effectively
Help your child read and reread through application forms before she fills
them out. Proofread her answers when she’s done. Fields that your child will
usually see on a form include the following:
 Fee: A fee to apply to a school is usually around $20 to $60.
 High school transcript: The school fills this out this section. Your child
should talk to the guidance counselor about it.
 Admission test scores: Your child writes in her ACT or SAT scores. See
the section “Succeeding on entrance exams,” earlier in this chapter, for
more about these tests.
 Letters of recommendation and essay: Your child includes these items
as part of the application. (I cover essays in the next section. See the
section “Requesting letters of recommendation,” earlier in this chapter,
for details on letters.)
 Interview: Your child is informed that an interview will be necessary. See
the section “Impressing interviewers,” later in this chapter, for details.
Writing a wonderful essay
Essays supplement application forms and give a college a better feel of what
kind of person your child is. Your child should make an early start on essays
so that she leaves herself time for several rounds of edits and for recruiting
the help of a teacher or knowledgeable person for proofreading.
An entrance essay should have a main idea that is clear in the first paragraph
and maintained throughout. That first paragraph is the most important part
of the essay, so your child must write a few versions and be really happy with
the final one. She should have someone read only the first paragraph and tell
her if it actually does tell the reader what the main idea is.
The essay needs to give a sense of what kind of person your teen is. Instead
of cramming the letter with details of her accomplishments, she should
describe herself in warm, witty ways. Check out www.collegeboard.com/
article/0,,5-26-0-9406,00.html for inspiration. Here are a few addi-
tional tips to put to use:
 Write the essay in the active voice. “Mr. Brown, the classroom teacher,
was my guiding force” rather than “There was a great teacher at the
school.”
286
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

 The essay should be something new, not a rehash of stuff already said
elsewhere in the application form.
 Less is more. Your child should keep her writing clear and clean and ask
herself if her essay really does sound interesting and upbeat.
You and your child can find plenty of private essay editing services. Check
out www.essayedge.com for just one option (prices start at $99.95). Even if
your child doesn’t want to buy into this sort of service, she can take a look at
“before” and “after” essays for ideas on polishing her own original words.
Impressing interviewers
When a college is considering accepting your child into one of its programs,
it notifies her about an upcoming interview. She has to prepare. Here are the
kinds of things that college interviewers ask:
 Why do you want to choose this major?
 What can you offer this college?
 Why do you think you’ll be a good caregiver/mechanic/teacher?
 Do you have good study skills?
 Can you tell me more about your work experience/interests/community
service?
 Do you think you’re prepared for college life?
 Do you have any questions?
Dyslexic kids may have an extra-tough time in an interview situation if they’re
prone to forgetting their words. The best way for your dyslexic child to feel
confident about the interview is to jot down answers she might give and role-
play giving them. Here are some things that your child can practice (with
your help) to improve her chances of doing well during the interview:
 Remember key phrases (she can jot them on index cards).
 Talk at a regular speed (nervousness makes her speed up).
 Place her hands loosely on her lap (rather than wringing them together
or flinging them afar).
 Say “I will” rather than “I’ll try to” (it’s more persuasive and go-getter).
 Iron out nervous ticks (like a tapping foot or swinging a crossed-over leg).
 Lose words like “um” and “like” (so she avoids sentences such as “I like
went to scouts and, um, like, had fun and like stayed for, um, like, three
years”).
287
Chapter 17: Heading Off to College

The more practice your teen gets, the more comfortable she feels, so be gen-
erous about going through the role-playing routine with her often. You may
want to talk about interview dress too and courtesies such as waiting to be
offered a seat when she first walks into the interview room and shaking
hands with the interviewers (or main interviewer) when it’s all over. You also
may want to help her prepare questions when the interviewers ask, “Do you
have any questions?” Here are some suggestions:
 Are my classes mostly lectures, tutorials, or labs?
 Are tests usually essays or multiple-choice questions or both?
 What’s the average class size?
 Are there core requirements for the first year?
Unless someone with a special interest in disabilities or a disability staff
member is on the interview panel, it’s probably best for your child to keep
her questions pretty general. She should direct all disability-related questions
to the people in the disability services office. See “Asking about disability
programs,” earlier in this chapter, for details.
Picking the Winning School
Your child may find that one school out of her options feels just right. More
likely, she’ll be torn between a few schools. In the end her choice may boil
right back down to that “feels right” factor that she gets from walking around
campus and reading informational booklets, but in the meantime her decision
should include consideration of the following:
 Course content: Subjects should interest her and test requirements
should seem reasonable. Multiple-choice tests, for example, may hold
more appeal than essays.
 Structure of classes: Small tutorial classes may interest your child more
than lectures given to large audiences.
 Disability support services: Your child should find out if the services
she gets are low key or comprehensive enough for her needs. See the
section “Asking about disability programs,” earlier in this chapter, for
details.
 Dorm and social life: Does your child want to live away from home?
Does she want to get a job to help pay for college? Does she play sports?
She’ll want to answer these questions and may also want to spend time
simply hanging out on campus before committing herself.
288
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

Your child, like all kids, doesn’t really take much notice of a lot of the stuff
she hears about her possible college choices. For example, does she really
know how far away potential colleges are from home? Does she realize how
many hours away the college is by bus, car, or plane? Can she tell you the
cost of a bus or plane ticket? Is she really aware that colleges that are hun-
dreds of miles away can be lonely places? You need to discuss these things
with your teen before you finally decide on a college.
Finding Help with Financing
Most scholarships (and fellowships) are reserved for students with special
academic, athletic, or artistic talent. But scholarships and financial aid pro-
grams are available for dyslexics; you and your child just have to find them.
Checking out all these contacts may sound daunting, but that’s how you find
current and relevant information and save money and stress in the long run.
Here are four good starting points:
 Your local Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) Office can help with just about
anything to do with work, college, and finances. To find your local office,
visit the Vocational Rehabilitation State Offices Web site at www.jan.
wvu.edu/sbses/vocrehab.htm.
 The HEATH Center of George Washington University is a clearinghouse
of postsecondary education information for individuals with disabilities.
Get to its main Web page at www.heath.gwu.edu or phone 800-544-
3284 or 202-973-0904. Click on Financial Aid for a document chock-full of
useful information.
289
Chapter 17: Heading Off to College
Bouncing back from rejection
If a college rejects your child’s application, she
has to learn from the experience. She must
move down through her list of options and
recheck that she’s presenting herself well. For
a child who doesn’t have dyslexia, all this
regrouping can be distressing enough, but a
dyslexic has added concerns. Would it be better
if she hid her learning disability instead of telling
schools about it upfront? Can she cope without
support? Will she make more friends if she goes
undercover?
It’s only natural for your child to have these
doubts, but the problem with forfeiting help is
that unexpected things can happen. Your child
may keep abreast of college work for months
and then find that three papers and two exams
are due in the same week. The best solution is
for your child to register for services even if she
thinks she won’t need them. Otherwise, she may
find herself in a crisis later. You just never know,
so why take chances?
If telling people about her dyslexia is a problem
for her, practice it with her. Let her run through
different ways of saying it. When she can
openly and matter-of-factly explain herself and
ask for help, she avoids subterfuge and the
greater embarrassment of having others find
out about her condition by surprise or accident!

 Octameron Associates, a higher education publishing and consulting
firm, sells small, fairly inexpensive books full of scholarship contacts and
tips for applying. For information, visit the Web site at www.octameron.
com, or call 703-836-5480.
 You and your child may want to check out the info about two scholar-
ships that are available every year. The Marion Huber Learning through
Listening Awards (six awards), which offers assistance of $2,000 or
$6,000, is administered through Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic at
www.rfbd.org, phone 800-221-4792. To qualify, your child has to have
been a member for at least a year; read about the award by clicking on
Success Stories. The Anne Ford Scholarship of $10,000 is administered
through the National Center for Learning Disabilities at www.ld.org/
awards/afscholarinfo.cfm, voice mail 212-545-7510.
Are there other ways to get financial help? Yes. Your child can apply for gov-
ernment aid because of financial need (not dyslexia) and doesn’t have to be
very low income to qualify for at least some help. The U.S. Department of
Education has the application form your child needs, called the Free
Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and once she submits it, her
Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is figured out. If her expected college
costs are more than her EFC, you get subsidized loans. Find out about the
kinds of loans that are available by checking out www.fafsa.ed.gov and
www.studentaid.ed.gov.
For a smorgasbord of information about financial aid that may apply to your
dyslexic child, including aid for families of veterans and students interested
in careers in the military, and aid for people who have given community ser-
vice (like volunteering in AmeriCorps), visit www.finaid.org.
Don’t waste your money on fee-based scholarship matching services. You get
the same information from the free services available on the Web.
290
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 
Dorm life versus living at home
It may make economic sense for your child to
live at home rather than board at college or get
an apartment close to college. If you encourage
her to stay at home, though, consider whether
you’re doing so because it’s best for her or
because you dread having an empty nest. Most
parents dread their child’s flight from the nest
and worry about whether she’ll cope on her
own, but you’re reading this book, so you obvi-
ously support her and teach her well. More than
likely, she’ll thrive. If not, she can always come
back to you to regroup before launching off
anew!

Successfully Keeping Up with Grades
After your dyslexic child suddenly finds herself beyond your radar and inside
teen heaven, you may worry that she won’t study and keep up her grades like
she should. She has to exercise restraint in the midst of all sorts of distrac-
tions, so a few pointers from you before she flies the coop can’t hurt! Here
are some things you might like to casually mention:
 Early on, find a good place to study.
 Sit toward the front of class.
 Study with a friend from class. Discussing ideas reinforces them and
helps you remember.
 Use goal charts to break tasks into smaller steps that you set deadlines
for (see an example in Figure 17-1).
 Use one calendar or personal organizer to keep track of all classes,
assignments, test dates, and so on.
 Ask professors for advance notice of due dates on assignments.
 Well in advance, read course requirements and syllabi to get a sense of
the workload and to help guide your course selections.
 Color-code your subject notes.
 Read and reread, several times if need be, books and important notes.
 Jot down questions you need to ask as soon as you think of them.
 Plan on two or three hours of study (daily rather than in one frantic
block at the end of the course!) per hour of class.
 Take study breaks.
 Ask a class friend to be your sounding board. Tell her what you think the
text means.
 Summarize text in point form.
 Use gadgets (such as a tape recorder, speech-to-text software, and com-
puter thesaurus).
 Give yourself enough time for each assignment (allowing for distractions
and minor catastrophes).
 Head to disability services as soon as you start to struggle. The folks
there can help you revise your goals, may tutor you, and may ask your
professors for extra considerations if needed.
 Ask your professor for extra time on assignments even if you don’t end
up needing it.
 Make sure that the professor understands how dyslexia affects you.
291
Chapter 17: Heading Off to College

After your child has worked hard in and out of school, she deserves a smooth
transition into college. The trouble is, a few things can go wrong. She may
embark on a career she comes to dislike, have trouble getting assignments
finished and handed in on time, or find that she needs to be pushier than
usual to get help. All sorts of things can happen to stress and demoralize
your child, so anticipating problems and nipping them in the bud is key.

Chapter 18
Succeeding with Dyslexia 
in Adulthood
In This Chapter
 Weighing up the pros and cons of getting assessed
 Treating your dyslexia with different methods
 Understanding your rights at work
 Keeping your family and friends in the loop
F
or adults who struggle with written words, the term “dyslexia” can be a
lifeline. It gives them, at last, answers, and tells the world that their strug-
gle has nothing to do with stupidity or laziness. If you’re reading this book
because you’re wondering whether you have the confidence to call yourself
dyslexic, this chapter should encourage you. If you already describe yourself
as dyslexic, this chapter should interest you. If your child has dyslexia and
you’re wondering about his prospects, you can get inspiration here. More and
more people are identifying themselves as dyslexic, and that alone has to be
great news!
In this chapter, I explain why getting a diagnosis and treatment for dyslexia
has advantages even for adults. I tell you why adults should let family and
friends know about (and help with) their dyslexia and describe the rights you
have as a dyslexic adult in the workplace.
Benefiting from a Late Diagnosis
Many people graduate from school without ever knowing they’re dyslexic.
They struggle with reading and spelling, and maybe math and following dir-
ections, but they manage to scrape through. They get jobs and hide their
problems (see Chapter 3 for a list of dyslexia symptoms in adults). Some
even hide the truth from spouses by saying things like “I’m not interested in
books” and “I hate writing.” All the same, when they hear about dyslexia,
they’re intrigued. Is that me? Did I have dyslexia all along? Should I call
myself dyslexic now?

A late diagnosis puts the “Am I or aren’t I?” question to bed. It tells you
what’s been going on with you all these years. And if you don’t have dyslexia,
it may identify any other condition you do have. It clears the fog and lets you
move forward, which could be as simple as calling yourself dyslexic or as
involved as going to adult literacy classes, enrolling in college, or getting
treatment for a totally different condition, like attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). Whether a diagnosis takes you one step or many steps for-
ward, you go forward!
Dyslexia is sometimes confused with ADHD or other disorders, such as
semantic pragmatic disorder (SPD), and a person can have dyslexia and
another disorder. I talk about similar and related disorders in Chapter 2.
Where do you get a diagnosis, and do you have to pay? Here are the usual
options:
 A private educational (or other) psychologist will assess you for a fee.
You usually pay between $500 and $2,000. To find a practitioner, ask
your doctor, look through the Yellow Pages, or ask your local branch 
of the International Dyslexia Association (see Appendix B for contact
information).
 Take a dyslexia assessment by mail, by downloading the material from
Direct Learning at www.dyslexia-test.com/adults.html. It costs
you $199 and is available to anyone in the world. Fill out the test booklet
(by following written and taped instructions) and then mail it to the
address you’re given. You get a full assessment in the mail within a
couple weeks.
If you need assessment results for your workplace or college, verify that
they’ll accept this online assessment before you go ahead with it. Direct
Learning openly acknowledges that many institutions ask you to be
assessed by a qualified, listed psychologist, which Direct Learning is not.
But if you want this information for yourself or if your place of work will
accept it, go ahead.
 If you’re looking for a job, contact your local vocational rehabilitation
(VR) office by going to www.pacer.org (click on Vocational
Rehabilitation and then on Contact Information for State Vocational
Rehabilitation Programs beyond Minnesota). By registering there, you
can be tested by a psychologist for free. You must wait for two or three
months for the test results.
 Contact your local college or university disability services. If they train
psychologists and special education teachers, they may offer you free or
low-cost testing so their students get to see professionals in action. (See
an example of how this works at the University of Florida Dyslexia Clinic,
www.csd.ufl.edu/Dyslexia.)
294
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

To prepare for testing, have a clear idea in your mind of the difficulties you
experience now and those you faced going through school. If you have old
test results or school reports that support the points you intend to make to
the tester, bring them along. Be prepared to talk and look at print. Whatever
tests the psychologist gives you, she will certainly ask you to describe your
difficulties and read words (like snail), parts of words (like sn), and probably
nonsense words, too (like urm).
If you have dyslexia (or if your child has it), you probably relate to many of
the symptoms I list in Chapter 3. And even without a diagnosis, you just know
there’s something wrong. Do you need a diagnosis? Not really. You don’t have
to be diagnosed, but if you do, you’ll probably feel better! At least then you’ll
know for sure and can call yourself “dyslexic” with absolute certainty. And if
you need it, you’ll have the verification to show at work. But if you aren’t
racked with curiosity and you don’t need the diagnosis at work, then save
your money and don’t get an assessment. Still, wouldn’t it be nice to know
once and for all?
Looking at Helpful Programs
and Treatments for Adults
There may never have been a better time for an adult to catch up with read-
ing and writing. Today, plenty of literacy programs for adults are available,
and if you don’t like the sound of that, you have at-home options too.
295
Chapter 18: Succeeding with Dyslexia in Adulthood
Deciding to identify yourself as dyslexic
When you identify yourself as dyslexic, good
things can happen. You now have a “disability”
(though you certainly don’t have to use that
word) rather than a set of vague problems. You
get to educate other people so that they under-
stand what’s going on for you, and your life isn’t
a round of excuses and coverups.
Being openly dyslexic is good, but you have to
tell people not only that you’re dyslexic but
(briefly) what that means, which is stuff like this:
 You can’t always read fast or accurately,
but given enough time, you’ll get through all
the reading.
 You write terrible notes by hand, but you’re
good with e-mail or a word processor.
These are the kinds of practical issues you must
talk about to save confusion and embarrass-
ment later. If you don’t speak up for yourself,
people who don’t know any better, and plenty
who should know better, may assume that
you’re less capable than you are.

Heading to the classroom
If you like the idea of getting away from home and learning alongside other
people who are in the same boat as you, you may like these classroom options:
 If you’ve made it your business to give libraries a wide berth, that’s
understandable. But if you want to learn to read and write better now,
the library is your friend. Go there in person, or call, or make contact via
the Internet. Your library can point you in the direction of adult literacy
programs or at least refer you to someone else who can.
 Your local community college almost certainly runs adult literacy pro-
grams. Check out its course guides by picking one up from the college
itself or from your library (there’s no escape!). Often you get one
dropped in your mail at the start of each session.
 If you contact America’s Literacy Directory, you get directed to local pro-
grams that can help you read and write. Phone 800-228-8813 or log on to
www.nifl.gov/nifl/ld/states and find services such as dyslexia
groups, learning disabilities groups, and recordings for the blind and
dyslexic in your state.
Improving your reading skills at home
A friend wants to help you learn to read, but where do you both start? The
resources that I list next are books or kits that are designed for adult home
use (though they’re not X-rated like I seem to have made them sound!):
 We All Can Read, available in third grade through adult edition, by James
Williams, is a one-book program that costs $36. It has large text and a
mark-the-letters system that may appeal to learners who like to classify
things. You need to know a bit about reading to teach from this book,
and flipping back and forth between the teacher and student pages is
tricky. Check out the book at www.weallcanread.com, but don’t
bother with the optional tapes (they just show the author mouthing the
sounds and are a bit dull).
 The Language Tune-Up Kit is an interactive CD-ROM for PCs that the state
of Georgia’s Department of Education has adopted. The home version
for ages 7 to adult costs $239. You get a small book of flashcards, a user
guide, the CD-ROM of 87 lessons, a placement test, and a reporting
system. The graphics aren’t terrific and the print is a tad small, but you
do get the step-by-step progression, following Orton-Gillingham princi-
ples, that the developers promise. Find out more at www.jwor.com or
by calling 888-431-6310 or 614-784-8710.
Orton-Gillingham is a reputable reading program for dyslexics. Its hall-
marks are that it encourages multisensory (see, hear, say, do) learning of
phonics in systematic, sequential steps.

Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

 The Rush Reading Clinic produces five videos, called Reading Tutors 1, 2,
3, 4, and 5. The videos are for all age groups but are described as being
especially effective with older students because they’re not entertaining
or childish but educational. I can vouch that the tapes certainly aren’t
entertaining, but, yes, they’re straightforward as long as you first learn a
bunch of sounds all by yourself. The developer tells you to learn the
sounds he gives and then come back to the tapes to work through lessons
based on those sounds. You must buy the first two videos as a set for
$79.99 and each subsequent video for $39.99. With the videos you get a
small, simple handbook with lists of words and a progress chart. Check it
out at www.rushreadingclinic.com or call 603-880-0125.
 Alpha-Phonics by Sam Blumenfeld is a simple, attractive, one-book pro-
gram for all ages. I include it here, even though a lot of parents use it with
their children, because the design of this book is basic but not childish.
The book costs $29.95, and people have been buying it for over 20 years.
Now you can also get reading books ($19.95 for ten), a workbook ($14.95),
an oral reading test ($19.95), and a CD-ROM for PCs ($39.95). If you need
help, the publishers promise not just 24/7 assistance but 24/7/365! Check
it out at www.howtotutor.com or call 208-322-4440.
All of the preceding programs are best done with a “teacher” — in other
words, any capable friend you feel comfortable enough to do this with. If you
prefer to go it alone, use the tape or CD-ROM versions of Reading Tutors, The
Language Tune-Up Kit, or Alpha-Phonics.
Knowing Your Workplace Rights 
as a Dyslexic Adult
Some people choose not to disclose their dyslexia in the workplace. Some let
employers know about it in an informal, chatty way because their dyslexia
makes hardly any difference. Others explain their dyslexia upfront before
they even start the job.
However you decide to handle your dyslexia at work, you may be more reas-
sured if you know your legal rights. There are places you can call for in-depth
advice but the basic things you should know are:
 The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the main disabilities-related
act that protects you. This act bans discrimination in employment against
people with disabilities.
 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act protects you too. This section bans
discrimination against people with disabilities in federally funded pro-
grams and activities.
297
Chapter 18: Succeeding with Dyslexia in Adulthood

 Your workplace must provide reasonable accommodations to allow you
to do your job.
 If you can perform essential work functions, you can’t (legally) be dis-
qualified or discriminated against in any way because of your dyslexia.
 Your dyslexia must be kept confidential and must not be disclosed to
fellow workers without your explicit (written) consent.
In the following sections, I go into more detail about accommodations you
can receive in the workplace and steps to take if you believe that your
employer is discriminating against you because of dyslexia.
Making small accommodations 
for big results
The ADA requires that “reasonable accommodations” be provided to individ-
uals with disabilities. Your employer isn’t expected to drain her financial or
personnel resources to help you but has to be “reasonable.” Small changes
(or “reasonable accommodations”) in your work environment, such as the
following, can make your life much easier:
 Having special equipment (such as voice-recognition software). To
check out software that can help you in the workplace (such as voice-
to-text software), visit www.dyslexia-teacher.com/dyslexia_
software.html.
 Getting extra services (such as a secretary who, as one of her tasks,
proofreads your letters).
 Being allowed to do tasks in a way that’s easiest for you (such as typing
rather than handwriting).
 Taking modified tests (such as oral rather than written tests).
 Receiving more or alternative training (such as being allowed to keep a
work manual for longer than usual so you have time to read it).
Use technology whenever you can! If you don’t learn to spell well, a computer
can help correct that problem. If you don’t learn to read all that fast, voice-
to-text software can help with that. If doing mathematics with a pencil and
paper doesn’t become your forte and multiplication tables always slow you
down, a calculator can fix that. (See Chapter 9 for more info on using technol-
ogy.) And for a really low-tech (but still incredibly handy) gadget, buy an
erasable-ink pen.
298
Part V: Moving beyond the Childhood Years 

You may have chosen a job in which your dyslexia is hardly an issue. All you
need is the occasional helping hand. Or perhaps you need quite a bit of help.
In either case, getting workmates on board may be a quick and easy solution
to your difficulties, once you take the plunge and ask. Build friendships in
which you help each other out. I’m sure this is stuff you already know and do,
but maybe you have more bartering power than you think. Most people need
carpool friends, baby-sitters, and emergency contacts, so they’d probably be
more than happy to read over your application or check your time sheet in
exchange.
Receiving reliable advice
For reliable advice about your rights and what to do if you think you’re being
discriminated against, check out the following Web sites or call the numbers
listed:
 For the full rundown of the ADA, visit www.ada.gov or call the toll-free
ADA Information Line at 800-514-0301 (voice) or 800-514-0383 (TTY).
 For free legal advice, find your local Disability Law Center by visiting
www.napas.org (look under Consumers and use the pull-down menu)
or call 202-408-9514.
 For help if you live in the United Kingdom, visit the British Dyslexia
Association at www.bda-dyslexia.org.uk, help line 01-189-668271.
 Log on to www.dyslexia-adults.com and click on In the Workplace.
You get clear information about time management and organization at
work, how to file a complaint under ADA, handy gadgets you may want
to buy to help you at work (such as a reading pen that reads a word out
loud when you run it over a word you can’t read), and more.
Keeping Family and Friends in the Frame
Dyslexic children sometimes get called lazy. Their teachers think they could
read if they only put in more effort, and, of course, if parents believe the
teachers, they may follow suit. As a result, the dyslexic child feels awful, so
he grows up looking forward to leaving school early and never having to try
to read again.
But then, years later, he has children. His wife writes his child’s home-to-
school notes and signs the birthday cards, and he thinks he’s doing fine. But
his daughter wonders why he never signs her cards and thinks he doesn’t
care. “He can’t be bothered,” she thinks. “He can’t even make the effort to
sign his name. He’s lazy and doesn’t really love me all that much.”
299
Chapter 18: Succeeding with Dyslexia in Adulthood

This is just one kind of scenario that happens when a parent keeps his
dyslexia a secret. Another is that one of his children also has dyslexia, but
since no one’s looking out for it, it goes undetected. Another scenario is that
he misses all of his children’s important school events because he can’t bear
to set foot in another school ever again.
Letting your friends and family know what’s going on is better than hiding it.
You risk weakening your relationship with family members if you deceive them,
and besides, if they know about your dyslexia, you may eventually be able to
laugh at your subterfuges and goof-ups with them. People with dyslexia are
resilient and inventive because they have to be. They can be hugely successful,
just like anyone else. They can come to terms with their dyslexia and manage
to chuckle about it. As one man with dyslexia said at the end of a conversation
I had with him:
Did you hear about the dyslexic who called 911? He told the operator,
“My wife’s broken her leg. Can you send an ambulance?” “Where do you
live?” asked the operator. “On Eucalyptus Street,” said the dyslexic. “How
do you spell that?” asked the operator. “Never mind,” said the dyslexic,
“I’m going to drag her over to Elm Street.”

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
f I could limit my kids to ten pairs of socks each and
serve them ten meals they both would eat, I’d probably
exude a kind of Zen calm. Just think, I could even buy them
all the same color socks, and I could fix meals on a rotating
schedule.
Alas, that’s a mere dream, but in this part of the book I at
least get a bit of the ten (if not the Zen) thing. For your
absolute joy and convenience, here are ten useful tools
to make a dyslexic’s life easier and ten dyslexia programs
and treatments to know about.

Chapter 19
Ten Tools for Making a 
Dyslexic’s Life Easier
In This Chapter
 Erasing ink and getting a good pen grip
 Using colors to become (and stay) organized
 Saving time with a wristwatch
 Teaming up with technology
I
n this chapter you get to see what a number of dyslexic people rank as
their most useful gadgets and gizmos for reading, writing, and everyday
activities. Some of the things I list are high-tech, but others are just nifty
ideas that creative folk have come up with that don’t involve ever laying a
finger on a keyboard or electric cord. Chapter 15 has additional info on
making everyday activities easier for a dyslexic child.
A Pencil Grip
Plenty of dyslexic children hold their pencils in a fist grip or way down near
to the lead, which usually leads to messy handwriting, so make use of pencil
grips. Buy a grip from a school supplies store or improvise by wrapping an
elastic band around your child’s pencil an inch from the lead. When she
pushes her fingertips against the band, it keeps them in the place where they
should be (by stopping them from sliding down to the point).
Pens with Erasable Ink
A dyslexic child’s handwriting usually is difficult to read and full of spelling
errors. Buy your child pens with erasable ink, and she can present her
teacher with work that’s decipherable.

Discuss this item with the teacher first because many classes operate on a
keep-mistakes-visible policy. The teacher may want to see your child’s errors,
but if her errors comprise nearly all of her work, her teacher may relent.
Colored Files and Other Handy Items
Dyslexic kids can have an awfully hard time staying organized. To keep your
dyslexic child’s life on track and on schedule, she needs to know exactly
where she should be and when and what color file to take there. Colored files,
towels, pencil cases, water bottles, and anything else available in assorted
colors make life easier for your child. When she can reach for a color rather
than a written label, knowing that blue stuff is always hers, she does stuff
quicker and with minimum fuss.
At the start of each school semester, help your child color code anything that
can, within human reason, be allotted a color. Drawers and files are obvious
things to stick colored labels on, but your child may like to color code other
things, like musical notes (on the page and on the instrument), nouns and
genders (using highlighter pens) in a written foreign language, and topo-
graphical features on maps.
A Wristwatch
If your child remembers that she wears her watch on her left wrist, she saves
herself a lot of embarrassment, potential turmoil, and, oh yes, time! When she
can’t figure out her left from her right, she just has to feel her watch. Simple,
huh? Oh, and should she wear digital or analog? Digital is usually easier for
her to figure out, but analog is helpful if she tends to reverse numbers. When
she’s not sure which way to face 3 and 5, she can discreetly peek at her watch.
A Pocket Spell Checker
When a word processor puts a squiggly red line under your child’s spelling,
she knows she has made a spelling error. She’s comfortable using her computer
spell checker and may even use the thesaurus function on her computer too.
But has she seen a pocket spell checker? If not, you may want to get her one
because they’re inexpensive and, according to many dyslexic students, really
useful. Because they’re small and easy to carry, your child can check her
handwritten spelling in class or anywhere else.
304

and Dyslexia Parents Resource at www.dyslexia-parent.com/software.
html. To go directly to a simple spell checker, see the Franklin Spelling Ace
with Thesaurus, for $14.29 at www.amazon.com.
A Cell Phone and a Personal Organizer
Are you wondering whether your child should have her own cell phone and,
if so, when? Don’t stop musing. I haven’t yet sorted that dilemma out for my
own kids, but I can tell you this: Teenagers and adults who have dyslexia rely
heavily on their phones. They avoid writing lengthy e-mails by talking on the
phone instead and use hand-held gizmos like electronic personal organizers
to make sure they’re in the right place at the right time with the right com-
pany. Fancy phones and organizers can keep the most muddled of us on
track, so for someone with dyslexia, they’re especially awesome!
Books on Tape (Or CD)
Books on tape (from your local library, www.rfbd.org, or www.bookson
tape.com) enable your kids to listen to more advanced or lengthy text than
they would read by themselves. Make taped stories a regular feature in your
house. If you drive long distances, use the time to listen to epic stories. If
your child is in high school, get a list of the books she needs to read for
English class and borrow the taped versions. She can whiz through texts that
may otherwise take her days or weeks (and plenty of midnight oil) to get
through, and especially if she listens and reads the text at the same time,
she’s taking the multisensory route (Chapter 14 has details).
A Photocopier
Even if you’re something of a technoflop, you can use a simple photocopier
to help your child with her schoolwork. Head with your child to a copier
every now and then to make copies of the teacher’s notes, copy summaries
of subject curriculums so you can see what to expect over the whole year,
and copy pages from books your child may want to paraphrase for assign-
ments. You can enlarge the print from good textbooks and then help your
child highlight key parts and rewrite them in her own words.
305
Chapter 19: Ten Tools for Making a Dyslexic’s Life Easier

A Word Processor and the Internet
Plenty of kids are savvier with computers than their parents are, but they may
not be so smooth when it comes to typing. Your dyslexic child needs to type
smoothly so that it’s one less thing she has to worry about. As long as she can
roughly type her ideas into a word processor, she can use the spell checking
feature to fix most spelling errors, proofread, and hand in work that’s legible
and much more accurately spelled than her handwritten version would be.
Typing Pal Junior is a program of progressive, step-by-step animated games
that you can adjust for difficulty according to your child’s scores. It’s for
Windows, and you can buy it for $20 from DeMarque at www.demarque.com,
or phone 888-458-9143.
The Internet also can give your child incentive to read and write. Even if she
uses only e-mail and writes mostly in e-mail abbreviations (RU there? CU
later), she still practices regular writing between abbreviations, and knowing
e-mail abbreviations may be as useful to her as knowing regular spellings.

landing.do?storeName=storefronts&landing=outlet_store
 RecycledGoods.com: www.recycledgoods.com
 Good as New Computers: www.ganc.com
Speech-to-Text Software
Your dyslexic child, especially if she’s in middle or high school and gets
plenty of homework to write, may find speech-to-text software saves her time
and stress. Speech-to-text software enables your child to speak to her com-
puter and have her words appear in a word document. She can scan other
people’s text, like notes from a classmate, into her computer and get her own
copy to edit or save. She may even improve her spelling in the process
because when she says words, sees them appear on her screen, and then
edits them, she’s using a few senses and poring over the same words a few
times (so she gets the repetition that helps her learn).
Speech-to-text software is like having your own personal secretary in your
work or home office. With it installed on your computer, you can dictate let-
ters and notes (to your computer) and have them appear in written form all
ready to print up and go.

Ten Well-Known Dyslexia
Programs and Treatments
In This Chapter
 Perusing phonics-based programs
 Checking out treatments using sounds, vision, and exercise
 Examining programs focused on the mouth and brain
 Considering diet and medication
W
hen you start looking into programs and treatments for dyslexics, you
may find yourself zoning out. Loads of programs are available, and as if
that weren’t bad enough, they can have unusual names like “Orton-Gillingham”
and “Tomatis.” In this chapter I make things easier for you by summarizing ten
well-known programs and treatments that range from the long-standing and
trusted ones to a couple that are unusual and, in some people’s minds, risky.
Chapter 9 also features general info on these treatments.
You can never be sure that your child will thrive on a program or treatment
(otherwise there’d be no competition!), so you may have to shop around.
And before you put your child into someone else’s care and pay money to do
it, contact a reputable organization like the International Dyslexia Association
or the Learning Disabilities Association (I give you all the contact info you
need in Appendix B). The people in these organizations hear the good and
bad of these programs from parents who use them. Your local branch in par-
ticular can give you handy advice.
Orton-Gillingham and Other Phonics-
Based Reading Programs
Your child’s school probably runs a remedial reading program that empha-
sizes phonics (the teaching method in which your child discovers how letters
represent speech sounds — see Chapter 12 for details) and is taught to small

groups of children. The school chose its program because it’s well known and
trusted and/or the school’s teachers have been trained in it.
Some of the more popular programs that schools choose are Orton-Gillingham
(O-G; www.ortonacademy.org), Spalding (www.spalding.org), Slingerland
(www.slingerland.org), Language! (www.language-usa.net), and
Wilson (www.wilsonlanguage.com). If your child is taught in any of these
programs, you can be sure that he’s being given instruction that’s well
thought of and usually gets good results. (Chapter 7 has more info about
school programs in general.)
Private tutoring (in learning centers and from individuals) in the most well-
known methods costs between $25 and $150 an hour. Here’s how to find info
on tutors (who may also call themselves therapists or consultants) in those
methods:
 To find an O-G practitioner, call 845-373-8919.
 To find a Spalding therapist, call 602-866-7801.
 Find a Slingerland tutor on the Web site or by calling 425-453-1190.
 The Language! Web site doesn’t have any tutoring info, but it does offer
training courses for teachers. If you’re confident about tutoring your
child yourself, you can buy a Language! Instructor’s Manual for $64.46
and the student book for $68.49. Call 800-547-6747, ext. 266.
 To hook up with a Wilson tutor, call 800-899-8454. The customer service
rep will send you a list of tutors in your area.
The information you receive here is a good yardstick, but bear in mind that
tutors vary in their qualifications and services. Ask about costs and times
and whether a center can help you claim back costs on your insurance. You
may also want to ask about financial assistance and scholarships.
Treatments That Tune into Sounds
Your dyslexic child has trouble identifying and manipulating speech sounds.
The programs in the following sections treat this by having him listen to
sounds at varying speeds and frequencies.
Berard Auditory Integration Training
(AIT)
In Berard Auditory Integration Training (AIT), a 20-session program, your
child listens to sounds of different pitches through headphones so that he
grows better at responding to relevant speech while filtering out irrelevant
308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

background sounds. Literature about AIT is mostly about treating autism, but
therapists stress that this method also helps dyslexics, especially those who
have heightened sensitivity to sound and other stimuli. People qualified in
AIT come from backgrounds like special education and social work.
Each of the 20 sessions lasts for 30 minutes, and children usually do 2 ses-
sions a day over ten days. The prescreening assessment takes up to 11⁄2 hours
and costs $275. The “in-home” assessment takes 45 minutes over the phone
and costs $175, and you find someone else to do a hearing test.
The in-office program costs $2,000, while the in-home program (you need a
CD player and get numbers to call for help) costs $1,500. Both programs
include four additional assessments.
Therapists can help you apply for insurance coverage (you can get up to 
75 percent of your fees back) and scholarships (their work fits into one of the
eligible categories that your insurance company specifies).
To read more about AIT, visit www.auditoryintegration.net.
Fast ForWord Language
The Fast ForWord Language program is an intense four- to eight-week program
(five days a week, 100 minutes a day) in which your child plays computer
games. Whether your child spends the full eight weeks on the program depends
on how soon he reaches the goals that are set for him at the initial student
assessment session.
Your child starts off by listening and responding to stretched-out sounds like
“c-a-t” and progresses to other listening-and-responding activities like identi-
fying the missing parts of spoken sentences. The program is run in a center
near you, or you have a trainer come to your home. If you’re far from a
center, a trainer can sell you the home products and guide you in using them.
Fast ForWord offers programs in Language, Language to Reading, Reading,
and Middle/High School. You pay $900 plus tax for the program. Your initial
student assessment session, in which your child is matched to a program,
costs an additional $150. You also pay an extra $100 per week for parent feed-
back (by e-mail or phone or in person). For indirect services, like having a
trainer attend a school conference or Individualized Education Program (IEP)
meeting, you pay $70 an hour.

Chapter 20: Ten Well-Known Dyslexia Programs and Treatments

Earobics
The Earobics program is like the Fast ForWord program (see the previous
section) but simpler and less expensive. The three CD-ROMs (for age 4–7,
7–10, adolescents, and adults) for home use (you’re not required to go to a
center) cost $60 each. Push the CD-ROM in (it’s formatted for both Windows
or Macs), and your child can get started pretty much right away with little
need for your help.
Check it out at www.earobics.com.
Tomatis
In a Tomatis program, your child puts on earphones and listens to a different
sound in each ear to help him distinguish between high- and low-pitched fre-
quencies. The program aims to improve your child’s listening skills so that
he’s better able to process the phonemes (sound chunks) in spoken language,
which in turn improves his reading and writing. The in-center program, includ-
ing conferences, phone calls, and all instruction, costs $4,380. Your child starts
the program with a 11⁄2-hour assessment and then gets 31 sessions, each last-
ing 11⁄2 hours, spread over 3 segments.
 His first segment is 15 sessions, usually one session a day, Monday
through Friday, over 3 weeks, followed by a 3-week break or “period of
integration.”
 His second segment is 8 sessions over 2 weeks with a 3-week period of
integration.
 His third segment is 8 sessions over 2 weeks with a 6-week period of
integration.
At the end of each period of integration, your child takes an informal listening
test. At the end of the final six-week period of integration, he takes a full
reassessment. Your child takes about three months to complete the program.
An at-home option is available, but it’s recommended for adults because they
can monitor their own development. You need your own CD player and can
call your center for phone conferencing if you need help.
For more information about the method and centers near you, visit www.
tomatis.com.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Treatments That Focus on Vision
The International Dyslexia Association defines dyslexia as a problem primarily
to do with phonemic awareness (your child’s ability to identify and manipu-
late speech sounds), but dyslexics can have trouble seeing letters, too. Your
dyslexic child may complain that he sees wobbly, fuzzy, or moving letters,
and most likely he writes a few letters in reverse.
The methods I talk about in the following sections pay special attention to
your child’s visual perception.
Davis Dyslexia Correction
At the helm of the ship known as Davis Dyslexia Correction is Ron Davis, a
severe dyslexic himself and author of the book The Gift of Dyslexia (Penguin
Group). Davis has centers around the country in which your child takes a 
30-hour intensive program (one week, Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to
4 p.m.). Davis methods help your child create mental pictures for words and
master a list of words that typically cause children problems.
The Davis program focuses on visual skills, not phonics skills, so it’s espe-
cially good for older learners who haven’t done well with phonics-based
instruction. Parents are instructed in the methods so their child can continue
using them when the program ends. This often means having your child do
physical activities, like modeling clay and throwing balls.
The program costs around $1,700. Included in the cost (and in addition to the
30 hours) is an initial 2-hour assessment, 6 hours of follow-up tutoring, and
unlimited phone consultations.
If you want to practice Davis methods without going to a center, you can do it
by reading The Gift of Dyslexia ($15) and using either a regular kit ($120 to
$140) or a kit of CD-ROMs ($140 for Windows).
For more information on the Davis methods, visit www.dyslexiahelp.com
or call 888-805-7216 or 650-692-7141.
The Irlen Method
The Irlen Method treats a condition that psychologist Helen Irlen calls scotopic
sensitivity syndrome. According to Irlen, your child has scotopic sensitivity
syndrome if he can read print better through a colored tint.
311
Chapter 20: Ten Well-Known Dyslexia Programs and Treatments

An Irlen practitioner called a screener can screen your child for scotopic sen-
sitivity syndrome. The screening, which takes two hours and costs $200,
determines what color overlay your child should use over print.
An Irlen diagnostician can do a screening and a diagnosis, which determines
what tint (mixed from up to 12 colors) your child’s glasses should be. Before
your child gets a diagnosis, he must first get an independent eye exam. After
the diagnosis, which takes four hours and costs $360, your child’s glasses are
sent to a lab for tinting. The lab fee is $100.

nostician, visit www.irlen.com.
Treatments That Get Physical
If your child seems poorly coordinated (sometimes a symptom of dyslexia),
treatment programs are available. Well-known ones are the Balametrics, Brain
Gym, and DORE programs, all of which give your child a bunch of exercises
to practice at home. (See Chapter 14 for more about the benefits of exercise
for dyslexic kids.)
Balametrics
The exercises in the Balametrics program (like balancing on a balance board
and throwing and catching beanbags) work best if your child does them each
day, ideally for two 15-minute sessions. Buy a home kit for $150 to $400 plus
handling (basic and advanced kits are available). In the kit you get beanbags,
a balance board, an activity book, and more. Audiotapes cost $34.95 for four
tapes and $44.95 for five tapes, plus handling. The videotape costs $29.95
plus handling.
Check the whole thing out at www.balametrics.com or by calling 800-894-
3187. Get your questions answered anytime via e-mail (info@biometrics.
com) or over the phone. To become a certified practitioner, you can attend a
training seminar, which, including materials, costs $399. Dates, times, and
centers are posted on the Web site.
Brain Gym
Brain Gym includes 26 targeted activities (like crawling, balancing, and
stretching in moves similar to simple yoga positions) for improving your
child’s balance and concentration and hence his memory, reading, writing,
and more. One hour of private one-on-one Brain Gym instruction costs $60,
312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

and a typical session lasts two hours. Your instructor can tell you how many
sessions are best for your child, but parents report that they see improve-
ment after five sessions.
Your preteen or teen can also take a 24-hour Brain Gym for Teens and
Preteens course stretched over three consecutive days. After taking either
private sessions or the course, your child can do the exercises at home by
herself and, if he wants, take refresher courses later. The Web site lists practi-
tioners, all course dates, times, and centers. You also can buy books, tapes,
videos, CD-ROMs, and DVDs.
For more information, go to www.braingym.org or call 800-356-2109 or
805-658-7942.
The DORE Program
The DORE Program takes roughly 12 months and costs $4,000 (with various
payment plans available). You can find DORE Achievement Centers in
Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, the United Kingdom, and
Australia.
Your child starts the program by completing a screening questionnaire over
the phone, and you must complete a medical questionnaire. After an initial
31⁄2-hour assessment, you meet a physician who runs you through the results
and the exercises your child will do. Your child does his exercises (like balanc-
ing on one leg and throwing a beanbag from hand to hand) for ten minutes,
twice a day.
You visit your center every six weeks so that your child’s progress can be
tracked and his exercises can be updated.
Find out more about the DORE program at www.dorecenters.com or by
calling 866-784-4377.
Lindamood-Bell Learning Processes
Lindamood-Bell centers provide programs in reading/spelling, comprehen-
sion, critical thinking, and math. The most well-known program is the LiPS,
or Lindamood Phonemic Sequencing program. The LiPS program, just like it
sounds, has to do with your child’s mouth. The program teaches your child
to feel the shape that his lips make when he says speech sounds so that he
gets better at identifying and later reading and writing those sounds.
313
Chapter 20: Ten Well-Known Dyslexia Programs and Treatments

You pay $74 per hour for tutoring in LiPS, a one-on-one, short but intensive
therapy that takes four hours a day for four to six weeks or one hour a day
over four to six months. You can teach the LiPS program at home but should
first take a workshop, which you can find out about on the Web site. A three-
day LiPS workshop costs $679.
Lindamood-Bell programs are popular and highly regarded by dyslexia educa-
tors. Research verifies that these programs can be effective, so you can find
plenty of teachers using them in school, and learning centers are in many
states and the United Kingdom too.
Find out more about Lindamood-Bell at www.lblp.com or by calling
800-233-1819.
Audiblox
Designed mostly for home use, Audiblox is a program of “multisensory cogni-
tive enhancement,” or in other words, a system of activities for improving
basic thinking skills like concentration, short-term memory, and classifying.
Children as young as 3 can use Audiblox, and the designer, Dr. Jan Strydom,
says you can expect to see progress within three months.
An Audiblox kit costs $250 and includes a book, a manual, a CD-ROM, a DVD,
a reading book, word cards, and more. Get the ins and outs of Audiblox at
www.audiblox2000.com.
PACE
The Processing and Cognitive Enhancement (PACE) program is a series of
brain exercises (like remembering sequences of letters and classifying, order-
ing, and matching sounds) that you run your child through at home, using
videotapes, audiotapes, a manual, and a few other bits and pieces. For the
program to work best, student and trainer must commit to at least 6 hours
per week for 12 weeks. Your child gets a follow-up test one year after training.
The Brain Skills ToolKit (which includes the training video) costs $497. If you
prefer to have a trainer rather than teach your child yourself, call 866-679-1569.

All Kinds of Minds
At the helm of the All Kinds of Minds program is Dr. Mel Levine, who wrote
the book All Kinds of Minds (Educators Publishing Service) and has appeared
on Oprah! Levine is opposed to the one-size-fits-all kind of teaching that
inevitably goes on in classrooms. He believes that an instructor’s job is to
help a learner identify his unique strengths and aptitudes so he can make the
most of them.
To this end, Levine runs “student success” centers around the country where
you can send your child for an in-depth neurodevelopmental assessment of
his individual style of learning. The assessment is explained to you, and you
get a written report (that’s like your child’s learning map) and up to three
hours of additional clinician time. After that, your child is equipped with his
own learning guide that he continues to refer to in any learning situation. He
knows his strengths and how to make the most of them, as well as his weak-
nesses and how to compensate for them.
Assessment costs $2,850 at the Chapel Hill facility in North Carolina and
$3,450 in the New York City facility. You can get an early payment discount of
$200 and financial assistance if you need it.
To find out more about Mel Levine’s program, visit www.allkindsofminds.
org or call North Carolina at 919-442-1033 or New York at 646-775-6677 (you
get a recorded message with a promise to return your call within 48 hours).
The Feingold Program
The Feingold Program is a well-known (but controversial) program that aims
to find substances in your child’s diet that directly affect his health and behav-
ior as well as his ability to learn. The program is really a test that determines
whether certain foods or food additives are triggering particular symptoms.
It looks at every kind of food your child eats, ranging from fruit to potato
chips, and every kind of possibly connected behavior he displays, ranging
from irritability to hives.
Using the program entails sending for the materials (recipes, food lists, a
shopping guide, and more) and joining an online association so you get
access to a help line, a chat room, and extra information. The program costs
$69 plus handling. You can also buy a companion book, Why Can’t My Child
Behave? for $22 and extra information sheets for $5 each.

Levinson Medical Centers
Here’s a program distinguishable from the rest because of the controversy it
arouses. It’s one of the very few programs in which your child is medicated,
so educators tend to be wary of it.
Dr. Harold Levinson, the author of Smart But Feeling Dumb and The Upside-
Down Kids, believes that your child’s dyslexia results from a fault in his inner
ear that can be treated with medication. The medication Levinson prescribes
is usually a mix of pills for motion sickness and hyperactivity.
If you consider this approach, consult your pediatrician first.
Your two- to four-hour initial personal consultation with Dr. Levinson costs
$1,000. A yearly review, which includes more testing, costs $825. A formal
medical adjustment phone consultation costs $150.

Part VII
Appendixes

In this part . . .
T
his part of the book contains the appendixes. Super-
fluous, dreary add-ons? Not at all! In fact, these two
appendixes are downright exciting.
First, you get a test that’s typical of what resource teach-
ers use in class to pinpoint your child’s phonics skills.
Then you find a whole Aladdin’s cave of useful resource
information and contacts. Now is that handy stuff or what?

Appendix A
An Informal Assessment 
of Phonemic Awareness 
and Phonics Skills
D
yslexia is a reading and writing disability (or, if you prefer, difference)
that results primarily from weak phonemic awareness and phonics
skills. That’s quite a mouthful, so here’s how it translates into practice: Your
child can’t identify speech sounds (like ch and ick) and can’t match them to
the letters that represent them.
Consultants and therapists find out what phonemic awareness and phonics
skills your child needs to practice by having him take tests. Very often they
design their own. In this appendix I give you a bunch that I wrote and use
with the children I help. They’re quick and easy for you to administer, and
they pinpoint your child’s weaknesses. Use them to check out your child’s
skills before you have him professionally assessed for dyslexia (see Chapter 6
for details about assessment) or as a supplement to the other activities in
this book (especially those in Chapter 12).
The tests in this appendix gauge your child’s phonemic awareness and phon-
ics skills at the pre-reading, early reading, and independent reading stages in
his reading development. Before you start, here are the guidelines:
 Move fairly quickly from one question to the next.
 Give your child the answers if he can’t quickly get them for himself.
 Stop testing when your child gets three to five answers (depending on
how long the test is) in any test wrong. He needs more practice at that
skill before he tries again.
 Do all the tests in order, moving on to the next test only when your child
has fewer than three to five mistakes. This formula isn’t a rigid, error-
counting formula; these tests are a diagnosis only of the areas in which
your child struggles rather than the precise extent of his difficulties. A
psychologist can give you an in-depth assessment.

 Be supportive and matter-of-fact. Tell your child not to worry about
giving incorrect answers because you’re just finding which words he
needs to learn so he doesn’t waste time going over old ground.
For additional info about phonics and activities that you can do with your
child, be sure to check out Chapters 4 and 12.
Picking Out Pre-Reading Skills
Before your child can read words and sentences, he must be able to distinguish
one letter from another and hear the sounds that letters make. The following
sections are all about these important pre-reading skills. In an average class-
room, most children develop strong visual and auditory discrimination skills
and phonemic awareness by about age 6.
Visual discrimination
Your child may pass an eye test and still have weak visual discrimination —
the ability to discriminate the shapes and orientation of letters. This weak
visual discrimination can be a pronounced symptom of dyslexia.
Test 1: Make a copy of Table A-1. Have your child look at the letters in
the Find column and circle the corresponding answer in the Answer column.

Part VII: Appendixes 

Remediation: Have your child do lots of looking activities; dot-to-dot, spot
the difference, and Where’s Waldo? activity books are good (Where’s Waldo? is
one of those books that has figures and objects hiding in elaborate scenes for
your child to find). Activity books with a bit of everything in them, including
letter recognition, are even better.
Auditory discrimination
Your child may pass hearing tests but still have weak auditory discrimination
skills — the ability to identify speech sounds. This weak auditory discrimi-
nation is a key feature of dyslexia. In the following sections, I show you
how to test the discrimination of various sounds in words, both separately
and together.
Surveying sounds in the beginning, middle, and end of words
Test 2: Tell your child that he’s going to listen for sounds in words. Explain
that dog begins with the sound “duh.” Tell him that map begins with “muh”
and then ask him what fill begins with and then gum. When he has the idea,
read column one in Table A-2 to him, stopping after each word to let him tell
you the beginning sound. Move to column two but before starting it, practice
with map, fill, and gum again, this time listening for the end sounds. Finish the
second column and then move on to the third column. Practice listening for
the middle sounds in map, fill, and gum and then do the exercise.

Appendix A: An Informal Assessment of Phonemic Awareness

If your child has trouble with map, fill, and gum, you need to leave this test
for later. Meanwhile, practice one sound, like “ss,” at a time with him. Talk
about “ss” words (sock, step, Sue, snail, smelly, sun) until he hears the sound
and then choose a new sound. After plenty of practice with at least six
sounds (a mix of consonants and short vowels), try the test again. If he’s still
uncertain, keep practicing one sound over a few days and then another
sound over a few days until he gets it.
Remediation: Try the following fun activities:
 Play “I spy with my little eye,” saying things like “I spy with my little eye
something beginning with ‘mmm’.”
 Play “I went to the store and bought/saw/found . . .” Every answer must
start with the same sound.
 Play “I went to Aunt Maud’s.” The first player thinks of a sound, like “ay,”
and all players must say they’re taking something with them (to Aunt
Maud’s) that has that sound in it (“I took paint, Raymond, an acorn, an
apron, mail, raisins”).
Pushing sounds together to form words
Test 3: Tell your child that you want him to listen to the sounds you’re going
to say and tell you what word they make (when you push them together).
Practice with m-a-p (pronounced mm-aa-pp), f-i-ll, and g-u-m and then read the
following list of words, pausing after each word so your child can tell you the
answer.
 m-a-n
 d-o-g
 d-u-ck
 p-a-t
 w-i-n
 w-e-ll
 l-a-m-p
 sh-u-t
 s-n-a-p
 c-r-o-ss
 s-a-n-d
 t-w-i-n
322
Part VII: Appendixes 

Remediation: Run through simple words with your child every time you’re in
the car or waiting for the bus or cleaning up after dinner (b-e-l-t; d-i-sh, s-p-oo-n).
Also, if your child sounds out a word like bit as “buh-i-t” and has trouble
losing the extra “uh” sound, show him to blend the beginning consonant with
the vowel, then add the last letter: “bi-t.”
Phonemic awareness
Your child may pass vision and hearing tests but still have weak phonemic
awareness — the ability to identify sounds and move them around (some-
times making new words). This weak phonemic awareness is an extension
of the auditory discrimination I talk about earlier in this appendix; auditory
discrimination is distinguishing sounds, and phonemic awareness is distin-
guishing and being able to move sounds around. Weak phonemic awareness
is a key aspect of dyslexia. In the following sections, I show you how to test
phonemic awareness by rhyming and switching letters in words.
Recognizing rhymes
Test 4: Read the pairs of words in the following bulleted list to your child. Ask
him, “Do they sound the same or different?” Practice by explaining how lay
and may, men and hen, and pig and wig all rhyme, but bed and hut, and leg
and thin, don’t.
 pet and vet
 man and can
 hat and pot
 tree and egg
 log and frog
 mat and cat
 hill and bell
 stamp and ramp
 clock and slip
 belt and dip
Remediation: Play the name-rhyming game, using sentences like this: “I like
Lizzy even though she’s dizzy.” “I like Ben and his big fat hen.” “I saw Brook
reading a book.” When you get to names of more than one syllable, you really
have to think! (“I saw Nicky being very picky.” “I saw Kelly; she was on her
belly.”)
323
Appendix A: An Informal Assessment of Phonemic Awareness

Switching letters in words
Test 5: Say the first key word in Table A-3 to your child and then read out the
instruction that goes with it, pronouncing the letters as sounds (like “puh,”
not “pee,” for p). Wait each time for his answer.
Table A-3
Changing Letters
Key Word

pat
take off p; put c there instead (cat)

pin
take off n; put t there instead (pit)
bill
take off i; put e there instead (bell)
fun
take off u; put a there instead (fan)
bug
take off u; put i there instead (big)
Remediation: Play Alphabet Rhyme. Write the alphabet for your child to see.
Say a small word beginning with a, like an. Your child must give a rhyming
word (like fan). Do the same for every letter of the alphabet (an/fan, be/he,
cut/gut, dog/log, end/send) and see how far you can get. Have your child
cross off the letters as you go.
Examining Early Reading Skills
Early reading skills are the skills your child has when he can read simple
words made of two or more letters. By “simple” I mean the following:
 Words like bat, pin, and nut that have short vowels in them
 Words like spin and plant that have a short vowel and one or two conso-
nant blends (like sp and pl) in them
 Words like chip and shop that have a consonant digraph (ch, sh, th, ph,
or wh) in them
324
Part VII: Appendixes 

I guess that sounds hard for “early” skills, but in practice it’s not. In the fol-
lowing sections, I give you tests of each word group, and you get to see that
they really are a straightforward bunch. In an average classroom, most chil-
dren develop solid early reading skills between ages 5 and 7 and then quickly
jump to independent reading of simple texts (see the section “Testing for
Independent Reading Skills,” later in this appendix, for details).
Knowing single letters
Your child should be able to name and sound out every letter of the alphabet,
uppercase and lowercase.
Test 6: Make a large copy of Table A-4 and have your child read the letters 
to you.
Table A-4 
Single Letters
Uppercase Letters
Lowercase Letters
B C E G K H J N O R S P T 
d c f b g i j k h l n p r t 
U V M W A X Y F Z D Q L I
o s u q w x y a v z e m
Remediation: With magnetic letters that you stick on your refrigerator, letter
tiles, and alphabet puzzles, play sorting and naming with your child. Use just
three or four letters at a time. Can your child name them if you jumble them
up? Can he find and name them if you hide them? Can he straighten them out
if you turn them the wrong way? Take turns doing these activities and then
make letter posters of the letters you used. A letter poster is chock-full of pic-
tures drawn or cut from magazines and glued-on items. Examples of items for
a poster of the letter l include real or pictured leaves, lollipops, lemons, lists,
lice, lettuce, and liver (it’s probably best not to glue on the real thing in some
cases!).
Trying three-letter words with short vowels
Once your child knows the sounds of individual letters, he should soon be
able to read three-letter, short-vowel words. Does he know how to blend let-
ters together? Is he comfortable with common two-letter chunks, like at and
an? Is he eager to show you what he can do? The next test can help you find
answers to these questions.
325
Appendix A: An Informal Assessment of Phonemic Awareness

Test 7: Have your child read out the words in Table A-5. If you’ve helped him
read words in chunks, you may want to encourage him to underline the last
two letters in each word so he remembers to sound out in chunks, like c-at, 
c-ut and t-en, rather than in all single letters.

Remediation: Buy easy workbooks for your child to do. Phonics Vowels in the
Help Your Child Learn Series, published by Frank Schaffer, is good. You can
also play “Change One Letter.” Write a word like bug and make new words by
changing one letter (beg, big, bog, hug). Change the original word or the new
words you make and see if you can make ten words. Sound out as you play
and let your child take charge. He holds the pen and finds all the answers;
you give gentle hints.
Blending letters
After three-letter words, your child should be able to read short-vowel words
with consonant blends. A consonant blend is two or more consonants, like st,
cl, and str, that sound out together, one letter blending into the next. You
teach your child to recognize them as a distinct whole and blend together
their individual sounds.
Test 8: Have your child read out the words in Table A-6. You may want to help
your child underline or highlight blends beforehand.

Part VII: Appendixes 

Remediation: Using words from Table A-6 and other words that rhyme with
them (like drink, pink, stink, link, think, and brink), write a list of 100 words.
Every night for ten nights, have your child read ten words to you from the list,
top to bottom and then bottom to top. Then dictate them for him to write.
Diving into digraphs
After short-vowel words with blends, your child should be able to read short-
vowel words with consonant digraphs (ch, sh, th, ph, and wh). Unlike a blend
(see the previous section), a digraph is a whole new and unique sound, not a
sound made by blending each letter into the next.
Test 9: Have your child read out the words in Table A-7. (Notice that th has
two pronunciations, like in that and think.)
Table A-7

Remediation: Do the same kind of reading and dictation that I describe for
blends in the previous section.
Testing for Independent Reading Skills
After your child has mastered the words I’ve given you in the previous sections,
he has good basic reading skills. Now he needs to master more complex
skills. The following sections show the harder skills he needs, roughly in
order. Have him read the words to you so you can find his areas of weakness.
Most children have basic independent reading skills — in other words, they
read simple text by themselves — at age 7.
Have your child focus on one phonetic rule he’s weak on for a week. Have
him read lists of words, every night. Dictate words to him every night. When
you help your child often like this, in his areas of weakness, he moves forward.
327
Appendix A: An Informal Assessment of Phonemic Awareness

Looking at long and short vowels
Test 10: Can your child read all the long and short vowels mixed in together
in Table A-8? Short vowels sound like the a in apple, the e in egg, the i in ink,
the o in octopus, and the u in up. Long vowels make the same sound you hear
when you say the vowel’s name: a like in ape, e like in eve, i like in ice, o like
in oak, and u like in uniform.
If your child knows the rules of Bossy e and “When two vowels go walking,
the first one does the talking” (which I explain in Chapter 11), he may want to
underline or highlight Bossy e (like in came and fade) and the two vowels
walking (like in stain) before he reads.

Remediation: To fix the rules of Bossy e and “When two vowels go walking,
the first one does the talking” in your child’s mind, teach one rule thoroughly
before starting on the next. In Chapter 11, I provide instructions and plenty of
word lists to help you accomplish this.
Getting the hang of y endings
When your child reads short-vowel words with consonant digraphs, he
should also be able to read simple words with y endings. Words ending in y
can be tricky for dyslexic children because they make either a long i or e
sound, and your child has to choose the right one.
Test 11: Have your child read out the words in Table A-9.

Remediation: Dictate words from Table A-8 for your child to write. To prac-
tice y-ending words more interactively, try this additional activity: Write out
ten simple sentences, such as “The tree is . . .”, “The man was . . .”, and “The
soup is . . .”. Make copies of the sentences for you and your child. Referring
to Table A-8, you and your child fill out answers (they can be silly) and try to
guess each other’s responses.
Sorting out vowel combinations
Test 12: Does your child know the sound-alike spelling chunks like ou and
ow? In Table A-10 he gets ou and ow, oy and oi, and aw and au. Have him
read the words to you so you can see whether he needs practice.

Appendix A: An Informal Assessment of Phonemic Awareness

Remediation: Many speech sounds are spelled a few different ways (like ew
and oo, ee and ea, and ay and ai). To avoid confusing your child, show him
one spelling thoroughly before introducing him to another. If one spelling is
prevalent, like tion from the group tion, sion, and cian, show that one first.
Spotting soft and hard letters
Test 13: Words with soft and hard c and g sounds are mixed in together in
Table A-11. Can your child distinguish between the soft and hard sounds? The
soft sound of c is the sound of s, and the soft sound of g is the sound of j. The
rule for deciding whether you have a soft letter on your hands is “Soft c and g
are followed by i, y, or e,” as in city, cyst, and cent. Have your child read the
words in Table A-11 to you so you can see whether he has this rule firmly
under his belt or needs more practice.
Table A-11
Soft and Hard Letters
pace
pocket
spoke
place
ice
strange
angry
slice
face
dance
past
race
ragged
plunge
wage
germ
fence
rage
lice
lace
glad
cage
locket
last
wedge
Remediation: If your child can’t read the words in Table A-11 or isn’t confi-
dent with them, go over the rule with him and have him read plenty of soft c
and g words. Read a few words each day. When your child has had a lot of
practice, show him Table A-11 again and, if he wants, have him mark the soft-
letter words. If he still can’t read the words, repeat the activity and be sure
that he says the words out loud while looking at the letters. Have him mark
the letters and read again. With plenty of regular practice, he’ll get better at
cracking this pretty hard nut.
Watching out for silent letters
Test 14: Can your child spot and not pronounce silent letters like the k in knot
and the b in climb? Table A-12 helps you find out. It has a mixture of regular
words and words with silent letters in them, so your child is a pretty good
reader if he can read out the whole lot without making errors.

Part VII: Appendixes 

Table A-12

comb
clasp
Remediation: If your child struggles with silent letters, introduce him to one
silent letter at a time. In Chapter 12, I give you several silent-letter families
(like the silent-k family that includes kneel, knife, and knew), so browse
through it and take your time with the activities.
Placing vowels before r
Test 15: When a vowel comes before r, a special sound is made. You can hear
the sound if you say far, star, and bar out loud and then pronounce a (like in
apple) and r (like in rat) separately. Do you hear how the pronunciation of ar
isn’t a straightforward blending of a and r? Good! The same thing applies to
er, ir, and ur, which all sound the same, and to or. Have your child read the
words in Table A-13 to you so you can see whether he know his ar’s from his
er’s or needs more practice. So that he carefully looks and sounds out each
word, I’ve included some easy words that don’t have the vowel + r combina-
tion. You may want to explain this fact and have him highlight the vowel + r
combinations before he reads.
Table A-13
Vowels before r

brim

shirt
grip
thirst

Remediation: Your child may find it easier to read the words in Table A-13 if
he first highlights the vowel + r combinations. If he still struggles after doing
so, flip to Chapter 12. Run through the practice activities at your own pace
and repeat them as often as you need. If you want, come back to Table A-13
for a retest.

Part VII: Appendixes 

Appendix B
Contacts and Resources
T
he great thing about finding information on dyslexia is that every kind of
help and advice you’ll ever need is within reach. I’ve delved deeply into
the Internet and run up a fearsome phone bill to give you exactly the right
contacts. Here they are then, links and numbers that really do work.
If you don’t see a phone number in the resources in this chapter, there isn’t
one. You have to get information (usually including an e-mail address), or
your local phone number, from the Web site.
Getting General Information Online 
or by Voice Mail
The contacts in the following sections give you info on just about everything
you would ever need to know about dyslexia (definitions, advocacy, parent
courses, technology, legislature, local branches, ask the experts, FAQs, and
chat rooms). I tell you what I think are each one’s special strengths.
Five general Web sites to start you off
This appendix is so chock-full of Web sites that you may be wondering where
on earth to start. Start here. The Web sites in this section are easy to navi-
gate, friendly in tone, and really helpful (or I wouldn’t have included them!).
Dyslexia Parents Resource: www.dyslexia-parent.com
This is such a terrific site! It has information for parents in any country, but
especially for those in the United States and the United Kingdom. It includes
sections for teenagers and college students and, well, everything you need, in
attractive, simple terms.
Hello Friend: www.hellofriend.org
Hello Friend is a great feel-good place to start finding stuff out. Funded by
actor Bill Cosby, it’s dedicated to his late son, Ennis, who was dyslexic and is
the home of the nonprofit Hello Friend Foundation that awards grants and
books to classrooms and schools.

LD Online: www.ldonline.com
This nice, easy site features forums, ask the experts, and in-depth informa-
tion or FAQs. Use the top menu bar to navigate and check out “First person
essays” to see what it’s like to be dyslexic. (My favorite essay is “Upside
down in a right sided world” by W. Sumner Davis, Ph.D, on page 1.)
Schwab Learning (part of the Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation):
www.schwablearning.org
Voice mail: 650-655-2410
Charles Schwab, business mogul and dyslexic, funds this site. Easy to use, it
has some of the best, plain-talking articles I’ve read, covers summer camps
and workshops, and includes message boards and everything else.
Smart Kids with Learning Disabilities: www.smartkidswithld.org
Another nice, easy-to-read, uplifting place to start finding stuff out. This site
features, among other stuff, Ask the Experts, Teacher’s Corner, and a Winner’s
Circle of personal accounts from successful adults with learning disabilities.
Five big organizations
For information on just about anything to do with dyslexia, consult the big
shots. The organizations I list here have big reputations, big databases, and
plenty of connections. They’ll have answers for you, and if not, they’ll con-
nect you to someone who does.
International Dyslexia Association: www.interdys.org
The aspect of this site that I like is the network of local branches (see the
next section).
LDA (Learning Disabilities Association of America): www.ldanatl.org
Voice mail: 888-300-6710, 412-341-1515
Call and leave your name and address to get an information package. The site
offers an online parent course on advocacy and IDEA ’97.
NCLD (National Center for Learning Disabilities): www.ld.org
Voice mail: 212-545-7510
Call and leave your name, address, and specific question to get information
sent to you. You can also request info by clicking on your area on the map on
the Web site and filling out the form.
NICHCY (National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities):
www.nichcy.org
Voice mail: 800-695-0285, 202-884-8200
Leave your name and address to get an information package sent to you
334
Part VII: Appendixes 

(allow seven to ten days). The organization offers free downloadable publica-
tions on grants, IDEA, research, and many other subjects, in English or Spanish.
The Dyslexia Institute (United Kingdom): www.dyslexia-inst.org.uk
Voice mail: 01784 2223000
The Web site is easy to navigate (you won’t get lost, I promise) and offers
brief, to-the-point information.
Talking to Someone Directly
Sometimes a Web site isn’t what you want, and a recorded telephone mes-
sage isn’t the answer either. You need to talk to a real live person in the here
and now. You can forgo technology for a while and get that simple human
touch by contacting the groups in this section.
IDA (International Dyslexia Association): Want to talk to someone who isn’t
part of a government organization? Need to unload your concerns or meet
other parents? Check out your local branch of the International Dyslexia
Association. Go to www.interdys.org and click on IDA Branches/Affiliates,
then IDA Branches, and lastly your state. You get phone numbers to call and
if someone doesn’t immediately answer, a person will call you back soon.
I called three branches to see how quickly I got to talk to someone and was
called within the hour by Northern California (wow, David!), within the day by
Massachusetts (well done, Pam!), and the next day by Ontario (go Ontario!)
National Crisis Helpline: For 24/7 telephone contact, call 800-999-9999. To
find help lines outside the United States, do an Internet search for “help line.”
Older dyslexics can use this number in an emergency.
PTI (Parent Training and Information) centers: To talk to someone right
now, call your Parent Training and Information Center. It’s one of a network of
centers all over the United States where you get disability-related advice (on
practically any issue, like testing, finding a therapist, and advocating for your
child in school), referrals, and even legal representation if it turns out you
need it — all for free (it’s federally funded)! When I called, I immediately got a
real-life, cheerful person on the other end, and she called me right back when
my line went crackly.
To find your center, call the Minnesota main office (also called the Parent
Advocacy Coalition for Educational Rights) at 952-838-9000 or 888-248-0822
toll-free nationwide, or go to www.taalliance.org/centers/index.htm
and click on your geographical zone.

Appendix B: Contacts and Resources

Checking Your Child’s Eyes, 
Ears, and Mouth
You want to be sure that your child’s dyslexia isn’t being made worse by
speech, hearing, or vision problems. The Web sites in the following list pro-
vide direction on where you can get this important stuff checked out. See
Chapter 4 for details on the importance of watching for vision, hearing, and
speech problems at an early age.
 Optometrists: For information on vision problems and a directory of
optometrists, log on to the Optometrists Network at www.children-
special-needs.org.
 Overlays and lenses: To read about colored lenses and overlays, check
out the Irlen Syndrome site at www.irlen.com/sss_main.htm and
Howtolearn.com at www.howtolearn.com/filters.html (both are
commercial sites) and Dyslexia Research Trust at www.dyslexic.org.
uk/va_news.htm.
 Speech therapy: For information on language problems and speech 
therapy, log on to Speechville Express at www.speechville.com, the
American Speech-Language-Hearing Association at www.asha.org/

 Treatments via the ears: To read about dyslexia treatments that involve
playing filtered sounds to your child through earphones, visit www.
mozartcenter.com, where you can find out more about “The Sounds
of Wellness,” and Audiblox at www.audiblox2000.com/dyslexia_
dyslexic/dyslexia.htm — both are commercial Web sites.
Surveying Self-Tests
When you have your child assessed for dyslexia, you typically work with a
specialist within the local public school district or an independent tester.
However, if you want to get reading and dyslexia tests for yourself, here are
your connections. You can have your child take tests online, or you can
download a test so she takes it the paper and pen way. Either way, you might
get the basic information you want without paying the high fees that psychol-
ogists charge. See Chapter 6 for full details on the assessment process.
 Burt Reading Test: For the (British) Burt Reading Test, log on to the
Reading Reform Foundation at www.rrf.org.uk.
 Mail-in dyslexia tests: For (worldwide) tests that purport to measure
dyslexia, log on to www.dyslexia-test.com.

 Online Learning Style Tests: Take a free online test to see whether you
have a dominant visual, auditory, or kinesthetic learning style at
www.ldpride.net.
 Read Aloud Tests of Reading: For (Australian) read-aloud tests and
spelling tests, log on to www.literacytesting.com.
 Schonell Tests: For the (British) Schonell Reading Test, log on to

(British) Schonell Spelling Test, log on to the Reading Reform
Foundation at www.rrf.org.uk.
School districts may not accept the results of these self-tests on their own as
reliable indicators that your child needs a dyslexia assessment or special
accommodations in class.
Focusing on Alternative Schooling 
and School Reading Programs
Alternative schools offer programs that you may not find in a public school,
but that doesn’t mean they necessarily provide special help for dyslexic chil-
dren. See Chapter 7 for details on selecting the best school for your child and
then find your nearest schools by visiting the sites listed here. (Chapter 7
also has info on home schooling, including resources and materials.)
Schools
This section lets you search outside the lines. Here you’re put in touch with
private schools that might offer just the kind of curriculum you’re thinking of
for your child.

programs work and whether you can get support materials to use at home.
Orton-Gillingham, Lindamood-Bell, Slingerland, and Spalding are well
respected and widely used programs. They are school-based programs, but
independent therapists and tutors also use these methods. I cover other 
therapists and tutors later in this appendix.

Laying Down the Law
Legal jargon and legal forms are heavy stuff. In this section you get places you
can go for legal advice and advocates you can call on to help you translate all
the legal hoopla and IEP procedure into regular language. See Chapter 8 for
more about your legal rights (and your child’s).
Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates: www.copaa.net
For a list of advocates and attorneys in your state, visit the site and click on
Find an Attorney/Advocate. Advocates can go with you to IEP meetings and
advise you on your rights, and attorneys can tell you the precise letter of the
law if you run into difficulties.
Disability Law Centers: www.protectionandadvocacy.com
Phone: 202-408-9514
E-mail: napas@earthlink.net
Your Disability Law Center (part of a country-wide network) is a terrific place
for getting free legal advice (for both kids and adults) and legal representa-
tion if you need it. The hub of this network is the National Association of
Protection and Advocacy Systems in Washington, D.C. Call to get referred to
your local center.
Wright’s Law: www.wrightslaw.com
Attorney Pete Wright and psychotherapist Pam Wright maintain this com-
prehensive site that offers you everything from advocacy training and legal
representation to tips for working with teachers and principals.
Finding Independent Programs,
Therapists, and Learning Centers
Many of the places in the following sections have phone numbers and some-
one who answers them (not voice mail)! Call, talk, and get local contacts —
as easily as that! When it comes to securing help outside school for your
dyslexic child, your hardest task will be narrowing down your options
(whether to go to a clinic, therapist, or tutor and whether you like the pro-
grams they use) rather than finding them in the first place. Check out
Chapter 9 for additional information about securing independent help.
Dyslexia treatments
Intrigued by what you read about these programs in Chapter 20? Check out
the following independent treatments with a quick call or Web surf. You’ll

probably have to call to get prices (they’re usually not on the Web site), and
even then you may have to persevere. If you’re told, “It’s different for each
child,” hang in there. You’ll get to the cold figures in the end.

Therapists and tutors
The term “therapist” or “consultant” usually signifies that the person
using it is qualified and experienced. A “tutor” is probably a more
modest deal in these areas, but you must check qualifications, experi-
ence, and all-round niceness on an individual basis.

Part VII: Appendixes 

Jobs and other life skills
Here’s a quick section about jobs and cars. If you’re out of work and need
help getting back into the groove, your local vocational rehabilitation (VR)
office can help. If you need a lot of practice for your driving test, you can take
courses and get practice questions. Here are your starting points.
 Advocacy: Client Assistance Program (CAP) offices give you advice and
advocacy (but not direct services). Call your nearest office if you’re having
trouble getting VR services: www.jan.wvu.edu/SBSES/VOCREHAB.HTM.
 Driving: Find your nearest Department of Motor Vehicles office at
www.dmv.org.
 Job training: VR offices give job-training and job-finding services to people
with disabilities. Find your nearest office at www.jan.wvu.edu/sbses/
vocrehab.htm.
At-home dyslexia programs
Adult dyslexics can improve their reading skills at home by working through
any one of the following programs. The best approach is to have a calm and
constructive friend to guide you, but you can choose to work alone if you
prefer or can’t find a willing ally. To make the right choice of program, read
my brief comment and then visit the sites you’re interested in.
Alpha Phonics
Web site: www.howtotutor.com
Phone: 208-322-4440
This attractive, easy book has been around a long time and is inexpensive,
too! The book costs $29.95, and for Windows computer users who wish to
work by themselves, there’s a CD-ROM that costs $39.95. Get a sneak preview
of the first four lessons by using the online demo.
Language Tune-Up Kit
Web site: www.jwor.com
Phone: 888-431-6310 or 614-784-8710
This straightforward CD-ROM (Windows only) has easy-to-follow instructions
(for all-by-yourself use) and a systematic progression of lessons. You get
plenty of chances to practice new skills, and the site includes a progress
chart. The adult’s program, Language Tune-Up At Home, costs $159. (The
Language Tune-Up Kit For Kids costs $69.)
Rush Reading Clinic
Web site: www.rushreadingclinic.com
Phone: 603-880-0125
This set of five videotapes is meant for your unassisted home use. Your first
instruction is to go off and learn a bunch of sound-spellings by yourself.
345
Appendix B: Contacts and Resources

You’re shown the letters and told the sounds, but that’s it; at this stage you
get no explanation of sounding out. After you learn those sounds though, you
get instruction about adding them to other sounds to build whole words. You
are led through a series of phonics skills, and the familiar instruction to go off
and learn new sounds crops up intermittently. Each videotape costs about $40.
We All Can Read
Web site: www.weallcanread.com
Phone: 404-310-2839
This fat book (third grade to adult) of large print exercises is handy if you
have someone to guide you. The lessons progress systematically with plenty
of repetition of new sounds, but you have to flip between student and instruc-
tor pages, and some of the concepts are best understood by someone with
some previous experience in teaching reading. The book costs $33.
