Some of my fondest memories in gaming were 
made when I was playing with someone sitting 
next to me. Whether it’s sticking a pal in Halo 
split-screen multiplayer, or screaming cuss 
words about onions during a particularly difficult 
Overcooked level, local multiplayer is the best. 
That’s why we were so excited to get exclusive 
hands-on access to A Way Out this month. We 
scooted over to Stockholm to visit Hazelight, 
play the game, and chat to its creators—you can 
read all about it on p36. That’s not all, though—
this issue is packed. We’ve also got our Xbox 
GOTY awards (p52), which caused fierce debates 
and a few tantrums in the office, plus all the big 
interviews, previews and reviews you expect.

Do you feel it? That nagging feeling tugging at 
you every time you get frustrated by a lack of 
progression... You could bypass it if you wanted and 
tip the scales in your favor, but at great cost. This is 
the dark side of gaming balance, and it’s completely 
taken over  Star Wars: Battlefront II  with some truly 
fiendish lootboxes that have sparked an industry-
wide discussion. Fiendish ways to convince you 
to spend money on a chance to win something? 
Sounds very close to gambling. We’ve got a full 
breakdown of the controversy and what it means for 
the industry on p10. Elsewhere there’s a whole heap 
of new underwater adventure to be had with the 
newest  Minecraft update  (p14), and there’s been an 
unexpected and very sudden closure of the studio 
behind  Marvel Heroes Omega  (p16). Finally we’ll 
be pointing you in the direction of a new indie game 
that you should very much be putting on your radar, 
the gorgeous-looking  Moonlighter  (p18), which sees 
you manage a shop and go looting in dungeons.

Maul! Even the updated take on Star 
Cards (the in-game collectible that 
improved your loudout with special 
abilities) seemed reinvigorated in their 
sophomore form.
Then the beta trials kicked off in 
October. The game looked stunning 
running on Frostbite engine. Seeing 
all three eras of Star Wars brought 
to life was a fanboyish joy to behold. 
But there was something about 
BFII’s new systems that didn’t feel 
quite right, and it soon emerged that 
EA’s decision to include Star Cards 
in a prospective loot crate system 
could—and importantly, would—affect 
gameplay by giving players with deep 
pockets a distinct advantage.
Soon there wasn’t a discussion 
involving BFII that didn’t include Star 
Cards, loot boxes, and the ability 
to purchase them via crystals (an 
in-game currency you buy with real 
world cash). EA, of course, was quick 
to firefight. “We’re continuing to 
listen to you coming out of Beta,” it 
responded. It was, “working towards 
having the most powerful items in 
the game only earnable via in-game 
achievements.” Soothing words and 
sentiments aside, actively seeing how 
loot crates turned some players into 
virtual gods on the battlefield was an 
image that clung to BFII as the game 
marched towards release.
Changes were then made to the 
game’s progression system in order 
to settle all those raised hackles, 
EA alters 
the deal
Star Wars Battlefront II’s microtransactions 
pulled from the game as EA and DICE face a 
tide of fan backlash and bad press
FANS 
AWAKEN
We all knew DICE’s return to the 
galaxy far, far away was going to be 
big news when it finally dropped out 
of hyperspace—we just didn’t think 
it was going to go supernova for all 
the wrong reasons. Because when 
Star Wars Battlefront II arrived last 
month, people weren’t talking about 
improved matchmaking, long awaited 
single-player campaigns, or finally 
getting to play as Rey. Oh no, loot 
boxes (or Supply Crates, as they’re 
known in-game) were the big topic 
of the month.
Even mainstream press outlets got 
in on the action, and some European 
governments may soon start looking 
into whether loot boxes like those in 
BFII constitute gambling. It got so bad 
that EA pulled the plug on in-game 
purchases mere hours before the 
game’s official launch. It’s a mess of a 
situation, and one that’s far from over, 
but where did things all go wrong for 
a game that should have been a sure-
fire GOTY contender? 
Loot who’s talking
Microtransactions are certainly 
nothing new, but the concept of 
in-game purchases in the full-priced 
Battlefront II first emerged back at 
E3 2017 in June when EA and DICE 
gave the sci-fi shooter and its new 
and improved features a decent 
airing. Everything seemed fine at first. 
New classes! Criterion-enhanced 
flight mechanics! Playable Darth 
It’s not all doom and 
gloom. With 
microtransactions 
pulled from the game 
and hero costs 
slashed there’s never 
been a better time to 
jump to hyperspace 
and have fun. And the 
decision to include 
microtransactions in 
the first place means 
all future maps and 
additional content 
will be released for 
free, as EA and DICE 
wanted to drop the 
traditional season 
pass model, as it 
was fragmenting its 
user base.

hope

and on paper the tweaks seemed to 
be moving BFII in the right direction. 
Star Cards with the highest rarity/
strongest effect were completely 
removed from loot crate drops and 
were instead locked behind in-game 
achievements. The ability to craft 
Star Cards was incrementally locked 
away behind a leveling system and 
weapons and other gear would need 
to be earned through natural play. On 
paper it all sounded rosy, but then the 
reviews started to roll in.
Luke and listen
Come the beginning of November, 
outlets across the industry got their 
hands on BFII, and the uncomfortable 
reality emerged. Loot crates were still 
there, and all the changes EA had 
promised were technically in effect, 
but the brooding shadow of those 
‘pay to win’ fears grew ever larger 
when it appeared you really could buy 
a substantial advantage. The ability 
to craft new cards was also easy 
to circumvent since buying crates 
would often yield a crafting currency 
enabling you to make more cards, in 
turn unlocking more abilities.
When the review embargo lifted five 
days before the official launch of BFII, 
all hell broke loose. Plenty of outlets 
praised the game’s substantial 
improvements to matchmaking, the 
splendor of the game engine, and 
the benefit of having an engaging 
(albeit limited) single-player story, but 
nothing could shake the corrosive 
presence of microtransactions. 
The next wave of problems soon 
arrived when the cost of purchasing 
certain playable icons was revealed 
in greater detail. Unlike the first 
Battlefront, where every hero and villain 
was available to play depending on 
your mode of choice, BFII sealed its 
familiar faces behind another paywall. 
Thankfully, this was wasn’t tied in 
any way to microtransactions, but 
the cost of in-game earnable credits 
proved to be far too high. EA then 
slashed those prices by 75% in hopes 
of putting out some flames.
It didn’t work. In fact, the issue 
had gained so much traction in the 
mainstream media that EA decided to 
pull the ability to purchase loot boxes 
via microtransactions from the game 
mere hours before its official launch. 
“We hear you loud and clear, so we’re 
turning off all in-game purchases,” 
said DICE general manager Oskar 
Gabrielson. “We will now spend 
more time listening, adjusting, 
balancing and tuning. This means 
that the option to purchase crystals 
in the game is now offline, and all 
progression will be earned through 
gameplay. The ability to purchase 
“On paper it all 
sounded rosy, 
but then the 
reviews started 
to role in”
ABOVE The 
ability to 
buy crystals 
has been 
deactivated, but 
how will they 
affect BFII when 
they return?
“The most surprising thing 
for me was that EA decided 
to pull microtransactions 
from the game just hours 
before it went on sale. The 
fact that they could do that 
without it really affecting 
the game’s progression 
system at all is telling.”
 Stephen 
Ashby
“I’m not against the idea of 
loot boxes; when just for 
cosmetic items or extras 
they can be a fun way to 
get something different, 
but when too many 
parts depend on them it 
unbalances a game and 
doesn’t feel fair.”
 Daniella 
Lucas
“We’ve all had a watchful 
eye aimed squarely on the 
world of microtransactions, 
because nobody really 
knew what the boundaries 
were… until now. EA has 
certainly felt the brunt, 
but everyone has learned 
from this.”

SAYS

THE OFFICIAL XBOX MAGAZINE

According to a report by VentureBeat, a 
source close to the game’s development 
reportedly revealed that one of DICE’s 
original plans was to include loot boxes 
skewed towards cosmetic changes rather 
than gameplay effects. Disney apparently 
blocked the idea, almost certainly because 
it’s very protective of its brand (and it 
probably didn’t want players running 
around as a neon pink Darth Vader in a 
glittery top hat), but it’s a setup that’s 
worked wonders for Overwatch, and would 
have helped BFII avoid the maelstrom that’s 
battered it over the last few months.
OVERWATCH 
AND LEARN
Battlefront II reportedly had a very 
different look, feel and loot box system
crystals in-game will become 
available at a later date, only after 
we’ve made changes to the game.”
Darth Disney
It’s a story made all the more bizarre 
by rumors that the final decision to 
pull microtransactions from the game 
wasn’t made by EA, but by Disney 
itself. Little more than a month from 
the release of The Last Jedi, The Wall 
Street Journal posted a story that 
Disney CEO Bob Iger had reportedly 
grown alarmed at the Star Wars brand 
being placed in a negative light so 
openly, and requested the issue be 
nerfed immediately. So, as of writing, 
the ability to buy your way to success 
in BFII is gone. But not forever.
Gabrielson has gone on record 
stating that, “the ability to purchase 
crystals in-game will become 
available at a later date,” so it’s 
only a matter of time before they 
return. The real question is in what 
capacity, and how they’ll affect the 
online experience going forwards? 
Considering EA also tweaked the 
microtransaction system in the recent 
Need For Speed Payback shortly after, 
it’s clear the topic of loot boxes and 
pay to win strategies is far from over. Q

We may have had 
the game-
changing ‘Better 
Together’ update 
that let different 
gaming formats 
play together this 
year, but when it came to adding 
actual new in-game stuff to the 
game, it was a little lacking. 
Thankfully, that’s all going to change 
with a massive content drop called 
the ‘Update Aquatic’ that was 
announced at MineCon Earth, and it 
will be coming to your trusty Xbox One 
early next year.
The update will completely change 
how water and the oceans work, 
bringing both warm and cold sea 
biomes with it, and containing things 
like diverse coral systems, seaweed, 
icebergs and underwater magma, 
which will release bubbles that will 
affect your buoyancy and even pull 
you into deep ravines. You’ll also be 
able to find underwater shipwrecks to 
explore, so learning to swim and 
getting what you need for underwater 
breathing potions will be worth the 
effort when you uncover hidden pirate 
booty. Those physics changes will 
make building underwater easier, too, 
so say hello to the underwater base 
you always dreamed of.
Sinking feeling
It’s not going to be easy to navigate 
down there, though—flippers weren’t 
on the announcement menu at 
MineCon this time around. Luckily, 
there’s help in the form of friendly 
dolphins who will help guide you to 
hidden treasure. But what if you find 
some nasty Guardians while you’re 
exploring? Then you can use a fancy 
new trident weapon that you can 
throw from a distance. There is a 
caveat though—once you throw your 
trident you’ll lose it forever, unless you 
have an enchantment called loyalty 
that will bring it back to you.
The update will also make building 
your own aquarium on land a lot 
easier—all of the fish you can 
normally catch with a rod can now be 
found swimming around, alongside a 
few new ones, and can be caught in 
buckets for easy transport, though it’s 
going to take some serious 
engineering to contain a dolphin for 
your own personal underwater zoo. 
There are also several kinds of coral 
and kelp to decorate with, and which 
will no doubt be used in plenty of new 
crafting recipes.
There’s also one last treat/
nightmare to contend with. During

After only launching at the end of 
June this year on consoles, the Marvel 
character love-in is already shutting 
down, as Disney has sharply pulled its 
backing of the developer Gazillion 
Entertainment. The move saw almost 
all of the studio get laid off the day 
before Thanksgiving, making for some 
particularly harsh timing.
It’s a major blow, as the PC  
version launched back in 2013 to  
a decent amount of success, but  
the console version clearly hasn’t 
been able to turn things around; it’s 
been a serious shock at just how  
fast the process has been, especially 
for such a huge brand like Marvel. 
When the game hit Xbox One we gave 
it a 5/10, noting that it wasn’t 
perfect, but it seemed to have found 
a small but dedicated audience, and 
still had major plans for more updates

Fans of the game have been doubly 
disappointed as many have bought 
in-game items and characters that 
they’ll now no longer be able to see or 
use. Many have demanded refunds, 
but so far there’s been no response. 
It’s a real shame, especially 
considering that players still had to 
pay for items until very close to the 
end. Gazillion originally put out a 
statement announcing that players 
could keep playing until December 31, 
but days later went back on the 
decision, and began shutting down 
the game on November 27.
Usually when a game closes you 
can see the writing on the wall 
months beforehand, but this was 
incredibly sudden. Is it a sign of 
people starting to become bored of 
the Marvel universe now that it’s been 
everywhere for so long? Perhaps the 
entertainment industry feels 
oversaturated with heroes at the 
moment, so perhaps the backlash 
and hunger for something a bit 
different has settled in much sooner 
than expected. Hopefully any further 
casualties won’t be quite as brutal as 
this one has been. Q

This month, Steve tackles the insidious scourge of  loot boxes 
The Fixer
Steve Hogarty is...
B
efore he was bloodily 
threshed to death in an 
as-yet-unexplained farming 
accident, my grandfather 
sat me down to tell me of 
his time in the war. “The 
year was nineteen-forty something,” 
he began, placing a large hand on my 
shoulder as his sonorous baritone rattled 
all of the dinner plates in the house. 
“We landed on the beach as the faintest 
promise of an anaemic dawn traced a cold 
line across the distant horizon. We were 
only boys. Too young in any case, for what 
we were about to do. For what we were to 
have done to us.”
His eyes glazed over like a pair of Krispy 
Kremes. “I had bought ten Allied Credits 
that morning, which I could spend to 
reduce the cooldown period on my 
airstrikes or to add a gnarly flame decal 
to my rifle. The other soldiers in my squad 
were not so lucky, having only scraped 
together three Hitler Bucks and a handful 
of useless Normandy Coins by tediously 
liberating enemy-held beaches over and 
over again.”
He blinked away a tear, before 
moonwalking out the front door and 
towards a thresher. “War is hell,” he 
laughed as he lowered himself into the 
whirring teeth of the machine, in perhaps 
the most absurd sequence of events that 
I’ve ever claimed to have happened for 
the purposes of introducing this column 
about problems in videogames.
The problem
As quickly as it turned on guy who shot 
Cecil the lion, the internet has decided 
that it’s finally had enough of loot crates 
and microtransactions, launching a 
righteous and viciously fought campaign 
triggered by one particularly egregious 
example of the form in Star Wars: 
Battlefront II. 
Whether paying real cash to peek 
inside a virtual crate counts as gambling 
has become a hotly debated topic 
throughout the industry, but regardless 
of the answer, microtransactions will 
always negatively distort a game’s 
economy by mere stint of their inclusion. 
Even at their most benign, loot boxes 
have a gravitational pull on surrounding 
game design, compounding a corrupted 
financial incentive to fiddle with drop 
rates and progression in order to quietly 
rig the game against the unsuspecting 
and easily manipulated player. 
It’s like trying to read a book while a 
very large, naked man sits quietly in the 
corner of the room. Even though you 
might not be interested in touching or 
chatting with the strange nude man, 
his presence alone is detrimental to the 
book reading process, and contrary to 
the experience the author intended you 
to have. (It’s not really like that at all, but 
if you would like to upgrade to a better 
thought-out simile you can do so for just 
15 OXM Crystals).
With pay-to-win loot crates, the 
industry’s most cynical beancounters 
have weaponized our brain’s faulty 
psychology, and lured our predictably 
impulsive minds down dark paths to 
addiction and overdraft fees. Worse still, 
they’ve ruined an otherwise perfectly 
alright game featuring Chewbacca.
The solution
What to do about these loot crates then? 
Well, if you’re not happy with Battlefront 
II, perhaps you could coordinate with 
other disgruntled players to launch a 
widely publicized campaign protesting 
the ethically dubious practice of selling 
advantage-conferring loot crates in a 
full-price game which, when coupled 
with a credible threat to boycott future 
EA games, draws the attention of the 
publisher’s shareholders and of Lucasfilm 
and Disney themselves.
If that doesn’t work, break out the 
big guns and upload a video of yourself 
in a Stormtrooper costume, doing a 
silly dance, and singing, “My name is 
Electronic Farts and I’m the world’s 
biggest idiot”. The publisher’s groveling 
U-turn will follow shortly thereafter. Q
Steve also writes for City A.M to scrape 
together money for rare loot boxes.

read a book while 
a large, naked man 
sits in the corner”

“There’s no sense 
of motivation or 
personality behind 
anyone you meet”
Daniella Lucas is...
The Traveler
Dani makes do with bad company in  Final Fantasy XV 
S
orry guys, I have a confession 
to make. Despite being an 
absolutely huge Final Fantasy 
fan, I really didn’t like XV. I 
could appreciate that it was 
well-made and had some 
interesting parts, but for whatever 
reason it just didn’t click with me. I was 
particularly disappointed because I adore 
the rest of the series, and I really wanted 
to like it—the world of Eos is gorgeous—
but it just wasn’t meant to be for me.  
   However, when I started seeing all of 
the DLC that’s been coming out for it,  
and those beautiful sweeping vistas,  
I decided to try to rekindle my relationship 
with FFXV. With some trepidation, I’m 
climbing back into the Regalia with the 
Chocobros to see if I can make the most 
of our journey together, and I’m hopeful 
that my feelings for it will return.
Everything starts out well. I’d forgotten 
just how handsome this game is and how 
good the combat feels. Maybe I was too 
hasty before and this will work out. I also 
love the roadtrip format and the breaks 
to set up camp with my friends—forcing 
Ignis to cook mouthwatering meals for us. 
FFXV really does capture that sense of 
a friendly camping trip with your mates, 
and does a great job of introducing its 
world to you. Prompto stopping to take 
photos so you can remember your antics 
together is the kind of detail that a 
traveling fan like me loves. When I look 
at the game through that lens, it’s a real 
joy, but the further we go the more that 
sense of doubt creeps back in.
Picture perfect 
Everything is so perfectly posed, even 
the candid mid-battle snaps. It feels 
very much like I’m on a trip with a group 
of Instagram models—beautiful on the 
surface, but behind the scenes those 
photo-worthy moments are few and 
far between. A funny still image caught 
during a spear-thrust attack isn’t 
representative of the feeling you get 
during the original act.
While Prompto, Ignis, Noctis, and 
Gladiolus are fun to hang out with when 
they’re in a group, playing off of each 
other, they’re all kind of soulless on their 
own. Their only defining features are their 
hobbies, reducing them to ‘that photo 
guy’ and ‘the one who likes cooking’. Then 
there are the people you meet along the 
way—Cindy is a cartoon understanding 
of a sexy lady, and everyone else is just a 
succession of differing tropes. 
Wanderbust
There’s no sense of motivation or 
personality behind anyone you meet 
along the journey. This happens really 
early on, too—for example, when you 
first reach Galdin Quay you encounter 
a journalist with an inexplicable New 
York mafia-style accent. It’s the kind of 
voice you’d only ever hear in a film from 
the ‘50s, but here, in this exotic beach 
resort, it’s a stand-in for having an 
actual personality. It makes no sense for 
him, so the character feels like a weird, 
half-developed alien guessing at being 
human, dumped there to send you on a 
nonsense quest. It just doesn’t belong 
so the whole area loses its sense of 
presence as a result—it’s no longer a 
beautiful dining spot where you can take 
in a lovely sunset, it’s just a shack and 
some water where you get a quest. 
His presence cheapens it, and is just 
one example of it happening all over Eos. 
It’s like the world was developed in one 
room, and the NPCs in another without 
anyone ever talking to each other. It looks 
fine when you’re looking at the world in 
snapshots, but when you walk around 
these places it feels weirdly lonely.
I love being in transit with the wind in 
my hair and possibilities for adventure in 
every direction, but as soon as I arrive at 
a destination it’s a little disappointing. 
People give places a certain spark—
they’re what makes a location seem 
real and lively, but with so many flat 
characters it saps the joy out of the 
areas I visited. 
I tried. I really did, but I’m ending this 
journey early and taking a taxi home. 
Sometimes if a relationship isn’t working 
for you, even if everyone else likes them, 
you just need to let it go. Q

THE OFFICIAL XBOX MAGAZINE

2014. That’s when everything started 
for The Last Night. The game was 
originally created at a game jam 
celebrating the brooding, synth-
laced world of cyberpunk, and 
developers Tim and Adrien Soret 
started composing a game that would 
honor and emulate the cinematic 
platformers of days past. The likes of 
Flashback, Another World, and Abe’s 
Oddysee were explicitly mentioned as 
influences for the game, even three 
years ago, in the incubation period of 
The Last Night. 
This game jam, as it turned out, 
would go on to be quite influential for 
the games industry: Another cult hit 
emerged from it, too. VA-11 HALL-A, 
the cyberpunk bartending simulator, 
ended up becoming a darling of the 
PlayStation and PC communities, 
while The Last Night—after winning 
the game jam—split off and found a 
place with Microsoft. 
Aside from being an influential 
starting point for The Last Night,  
that game jam also laid the 
foundations for some of Odd Tales’  
key design philosophies in the game: 
First up, it was here that the brothers 
decided upon the art style they’d  
use to make the game. The Last Night 
has a very specific flavor to it: a neon-
drenched, moody urban backdrop, 
populated by tall characters that 
seem to stalk through the shadows 
of cities that appear to be outgrowing 
themselves. 
This style was not accidental. Tim 
and Adrien Soret looked to other pixel-
art games like Gods Will Be Watching 
and Sword & Sworcery to inspire 
them—the long-limbed characters of 
each game carried an animation style 
that was both flowing and realistic, 
easy to read and impactful on the 
player. That’s where The Last Night 
started to really pull in a personality 
of its own: By incorporating these 
characters that felt like they really 
belonged in this world that seemed to 
dwarf them, The Last Night managed 
to attract a lot of critical attention, 
way before this year’s big E3 re-reveal.
Weird and wonderful
Anchoring the characters in the world 
by making them pair up aesthetically 
with their surroundings seems 
thematically on point for what Odd 
Tales is trying to achieve. The game’s 
writer—DS Wadeson—explained that 
the game’s narrative will be focused 
on the idea of post-cyberpunk, the 
idea of a character “anchored in their 
society rather than adrift in it”. This 
was a statement describing the genre 
originally made by Lawrence Person 
on Slashdot in 1998, and yet it fits the 
game perfectly. 
Look at what we know about it so 
far: It revolves around Charlie, we 
know that Charlie is lower-class, that 
he must work to survive, and that in 
some way he is rebelling against the 
faux-Utopian setup the rest of the 
world seems to be daydreaming in. We 
know that, for some reason, Charlie is 
unable to receive the bionic implants 
and upgrades other humans have 
enhanced themselves with that make 
their lives easier.

Transmigration Of Bodies… but he’s 
not an outcast, or a misfit. Instead, 
he’s given purpose by the world he 
finds himself in, and we as players 
are driven forward in Charlie’s story 
because of the world.
It’s a world inspired by Hong Kong, 
by the backdrops in ’90s fighting 
games like Garou: Mark Of The 
Wolves, by the lingering shots of 
Ghost In The Shell, the panoramas 
of Blade Runner. Odd Tales wants to 
make this world futuristic and inviting, 
as much of a draw to the player as 
any of the main cast or stripped-
back mechanics. 
To do that, the developers have 
done something brave. The studio has 
moved away from the ‘traditional’ way 
of generating pixel-art, instead opting 
for a far more free-form interpretation 
of the style. Odd Tales hasn’t glued 
any character to a grid, and hasn’t 
painted everything onto one plane. 
Instead, the world is brought to life 
with complex parallax layers, dynamic 
lighting, and weather that seems to 
exist outside of the pixel art style.
The result is striking; unlike 
anything we’ve ever seen in a game. 
The game deceives you, makes you 
think its 2D. After all, the animation is 
rotoscoped, everything is built with 
pixels—of course it’s going to be 
2D, right? Wrong. It’s more like 2.5D, 
built entirely in a 3D engine, meaning 
there’s a level of immersion you get 
(paired up with that gorgeous lighting) 
that we’re not used to seeing in other 
pixelart games.
Jumping the shark
Despite citing cinematic platformers 
as the inspiration, the game 
apparently won’t ship with a ‘jump’ 
button, because that wouldn’t be 
true to the realism the developers 
are shooting for. Instead, the game 
is taking on all the elements of the 
genre, but only on a stylistic basis—
after all, a side-on view of this city 
and this world is perfect, and gives 
you the view you need to really get 
inside it and explore the lives of the 
people inhabiting it.
So instead of leaping from ledge 
to ledge, you’re tasked with talking 
to people. Learning more about a 
clandestine life-or-death plot that, 
in some way, has its claws in Charlie. 
Gameplay on the title so far has 
been limited, but we do know that 
depending on the choices you make 
in the narrative and the actions you 
take in the world, different people 
will start reacting differently to you. 
It’s reminiscent of David Cage’s 
Detroit: Become Human, but a far 
more distilled version, and apparently 
without the hammer-and-tongs 
approach to storytelling Quantic 
Dream insists on championing. 
By all accounts, The Last Night 
seems more subtle. It leverages the 
lack of detail inherent in pixel art 
to communicate itself. It relies on 
body language and animation rather 
than hammy dialogue and uncanny 
valley-level facial expressions. It 
uses cinematic techniques—dolly 
cam tracking shots, wide-angle 
establishing shots, lingering focus on 
a seemingly unimportant character or 
object—to speak to the player.
Even if the game’s narrative ends 
up being nebulous and unsatisfying 
(hey, multi-layered stories are always 
at risk of that, right Mass Effect?), The 
Last Night is onto something special 
because of how it’s been made. 
Even the reveal trailer from 2017’s 
E3 showcase follows a certain path, 
designed specifically to entice players 
by throwing this gorgeous world out 
there and saying, ‘Yes, but what about 
the city?’ When we see the city, the 
developers want to introduce us to 
the character, Charlie, and when we 
see him, we want to know where he’s 
going and what he’s doing.
If the rest of The Last Night has 
been composed with the self-
awareness and intent that the even 
the reveal trailer was, we can expect 
something truly unique—and possibly 
significant—to drop from this fledgling 
studio. When describing this post-
cyberpunk world, Wadeson writes 
“We’re not in 1980 anymore. We need 
to move on. Even if you don’t realize 
it, 35 years later, the cyberpunk vision 
established by Blade Runner & William 
Gibson is just too normal.”
He’s right, and this game celebrates 
that: It takes a sobering look around 
this brave new world, hands you the 
controller and says ‘Now what?’ Q
“The result is striking; 
unlike anything we’ve ever 
seen in a game”
When the game 
first entered 
development, 
brothers Tim 
and Adrien Soret 
described the 
intended style of 
the game as “Blade 
Runner + delicious 
pixels”, nodding to 
inspirations from 
other cinematic 
platformers. But the 
developers want 
to push the idea of 
cyberpunk beyond 
what most media 
representation of 
the genre does, 
and present a 
reworked, more 
relevant version 
of the tropes that 
established the 
genre in the  
first place.

The first playable section of 
Psychonauts 2 has finally been shown 
to the world. Some 12 years after the 
first game in the series was released, 
and two years after the game’s formal 
announcement, the team at Double 
Fine has at last revealed the first 
gameplay from the title.
Just like the first game, you’ll 
get to set out on all your mentally 
challenging adventures from a central 
hub world—which this time takes the 
form of a bowl-shaped mountain: 
The game starts here, and you’ll be 
returning frequently, too. 
According to Double Fine project 
lead Zak McClendon, this central 
hub is being used as the testing 
ground for the development team, 
and represents a shift in practise for 
the studio, too. Using this hub, the 
team is trying to achieve end-game 
levels of completion for one section—
representing all of the gameplay 
systems, art, and new mechanics.
The result? The foundation for the 
entire tone of Psychonauts 2: In the 
First Playable build, you get to see 
the trippy visuals, retro platforming 
elements of the game, and you even 
get to taste little pieces of that now-
classic Double Fine humor. 
Tim Schafer—president and CEO of 
Double Fine—even suggests there 
might be an achievement in the final 
build for escorting a goat through 
the whole game using your mental 
levitation powers. Coming from the 
mind behind Monkey Island and Brütal 
Legend, we can’t say we’re surprised 
by that idea. But that’s what makes 
Psychonauts great: The off-the-wall 
humor and unique premise.
Going mental
Psychonauts 2 will return to the 
character Raz and his journeys 
through the mental landscapes 
of other people. Raz goes back to 
Psychonauts HQ after the events 
of PSVR game Rhombus Of Ruin to 
discover all is not what it seems, 
and the psychic research of the 
unit has been retooled to focus on 
necromancy, rather than its previous 
peacekeeping mission.
The game very much exists on two 
planes: The real world, and the mental 
world. So this hub is the game’s 
take on the real world, and offers an 
interesting look at where it could be 
going. The sequel is also going to dive 
deeper into Raz’s personal history: 
The first game introduced the idea 
that he and his family all suffer from a 
mysterious curse—Schafer promises 
to expand upon that in the sequel, too.
From what Schafer and McClendon 
have said, we can expect these 
other mental worlds to be more 
exaggerated than the previous games. 
The first title’s levels set inside other 
people’s heads were interesting 
representations of their psyche, so 
pushing that further in Psychonauts 2  
could mean we see trickier puzzles, 
more realized themes, and maybe 
even some more communicative 
environmental storytelling.
A set of abilities from the first game 
will make a return, too: It’s already 
been confirmed that we’ll get to play 
around with telekinesis, pyrokinesis, 
and levitation, as well as some more, 
newer powers as Raz comes to terms 
with more of his innate power.
One thing’s for sure: This game is 
going to be ‘way, way bigger’ than the 
2005 title; Schafer is certain about 
that. After all, it’s got the new tech of 
the Xbox One to play with—meaning 
that hopefully it’ll be a pleasant 
retread of a platformer that deserves 
the best from Double Fine. Q

Another element 
that this game is 
going to explore is 
Raz’s personal love 
life. The events of 
the first game didn’t 
really leave room 
for the protagonist 
to get his romantic 
affairs in order, 
but according 
to Schafer, the 
sequel will see 
the awkward hero 
‘understand what 
the term “girlfriend”

They say a problem shared is a 
problem halved. Then again, they 
usually need a favor from you when 
they say that, don’t they? In the case 
of Far Cry 5’s, the problem’s probably 
quite a biggie. A fanatical religious 
doomsday cult has taken over an 
entire county of rural America, they’re 
all improbably well-armed, and they’re 
led by a charismatic (aren’t they 
always?) chap who thinks any attempt 
to take him down is the first sign of 
the apocalypse.
Here’s where the favor comes 
in: Two of you can play through the 
entire story in co-op, double-teaming 
every mission, activity, and collectible 
hunt. This is becoming something 
of a Ubisoft calling card after Ghost 
Recon Wildlands’ wide-open co-op 
campaign, and we couldn’t be more 
on board with it. 
What it represents, more than 
simply some VOIP banter and twice 
the firepower, is an exciting evolution 
in co-op gaming. Former kings of the 
realm Borderlands and Left 4 Dead 
were either tedious or impossible to 
play alone, but as solo experiences 
previous Far Cry games were anything 
but dull, reveling in the freedom they 
could lavish on one player and tickling 
that player’s exploration gland (yeah, 
that’s a thing, and no, don’t look it up) 
with every new vista and map marker. 
Everything we’ve seen of Far Cry 5 
so far looks to build well beyond its 
ancestors, so the prospect of sharing 
such a rich world map with a buddy is 
a big deal.
Bro-op
If the very thought of human contact 
makes you wince though, you’ll be 
relieved to know you can bolster your 
crew by hiring one of three ‘Guns 
for Hire’ NPCs, each with their own 
specialties and, inevitably, pithy one-
liners upon killing folks. Sadly though, 
it’s not possible to bring together 
a bigger squad using human and AI 
team-mates—which, since you’re up 
against an entire cult, would have 
been pretty handy.
Here’s how it actually works. Upon 
finishing the tutorial, you’re let loose 
into the world and able to summon a 
friend (only from your friends list mind 
you—there are no random drop-ins in 
this one) whereupon the two of you 
can take the game on in any order you 
see fit. If one of you wanders off too 
far from the other, you’ll be teleported 
back near each other—d’aww. Only 
the session host can begin missions 
and thus power the game forwards, 
but the guest carries over all their 
character progress, upgrades, and 
inventory items from session to 
session. It sounds like an obvious call, 
but in Far Cry 4’s equivalent mode only 
the host got to bank their progress. 
This is definite progress, then, and an 
encouragement to play through the 
whole game with the same partner.
If you haven’t been plotting Far 
Cry 5’s progress from design brief 
to release day yet, it’s shaping up 
to be the most accomplished and 
controversial series entrant to date. 
Set on American soil for the first time 
and releasing at an… interesting 
time in politics, the story’s already 
become a hot button issue long 
before it sees the light of day. It’s 
a big ask of the studio to produce 
an enjoyable shooter about running 
amok in rural idylls while also giving 
its dark and prescient subject matter 
the sensitivity it deserves, but on a 
mechanical level Far Cry 5 is looking 
incredibly accomplished, so we’re 
backing Ubi Montreal to make converts 
out of us in February. Q 
Chief antagonist 
Joseph Seed refers 
to his siblings 
Jacob, John and 
Faith as ‘the 
Heralds’ and his 
favorite pastime is 
bellowing hymns at 
the top of his voice 
while shirtless and 
holding an assault 
rifle. Far Cry’s served 
up many an oddball 
villain before, but 
there’s something 
eerily plausible 
about this one.

Here’s a good news story for you: In 
2016 Evolution Studios closed its 
doors for the last time following PS4 
exclusive Driveclub’s disastrous 
launch and many subsequent months 
of hard work to fix and improve the 
racer. Hold on, that’s not the good  
part yet: Shortly after the Cheshire-
based studio’s closure, Codemasters 
bought it and resurrected the 
considerable talent therein. OnRush  
is the fruit of that investment, headed 
by Driveclub director Paul Rustchynsky 
and developed by several veterans of 
the Motorstorm series (also Sony-
exclusive, but let’s allow bygones  
to be bygones).
Despite that pedigree, OnRush isn’t 
going to be a super-serious sim racer 
full of licensed cars whose fine leather 
seats are stitched 100% accurately. 
Based on its Paris Games Week reveal, 
it looks to summon some of the old 
Motorstorm attitude and throw in 
some Trackmania. In other words, 
large areas hosting freeform racing 
between buggies and dirt bikes, with 
an emphasis on fun and pulling off 
impressive stunts, rather than nailing 
apex after apex and shaving 0.00003s 
off your ghost time.
There’s something quite retro about 
that. Looking back at the biggest 
driving games of 2017—Forza 
Motorsport 7, Project Cars 2, and the 
gang—it’s clear that the genre’s 
defined by bushels of official licenses 
and tickboxes of meticulousness right 
now. The sight of distinctly unlicensed 
4X4 offroad vehicles tumbling through 
the air like gymnasts amidst vast 
canyons calls to mind a different era, 
and it’s perhaps in this misty-eyed 
space that OnRush can find an 
audience. There are plenty of Midtown 
Madness and Burnout veterans out 
there looking for a casual race, after 
all. As if deliberately offering catharsis 
to those who’ve spent the summer 
avoiding contact with online 
opponents in Project Cars 2, the 
racing here looks to encourage 
jostling rather than penalize it. If you 
can nudge a motocross bike off that 
huge ridge, all power to you. If your 
4X4 prevails in a vehicular fistfight 
along the dirt roads of some unknown 
wasteland, it’s a chequered flag 
waiting for you at the end rather than 
a wagging finger.
Ridge racer
In fact, performing actions that would 
null your insurance IRL are actively 
promoted here via the Rush meter 
mechanic. Essentially it’s a speed 
boost that’s activated after filling up a 
bar by doing exciting things, although 
what counts as ‘exciting’ and what’s 
fenced off as ‘a dick move’ has yet to 
be clarified. Game director 
Rustchynsky says the whole team 
grew up playing arcade racers of old 
and wants to reimagine that 
experience for a new audience, and 
that’s evident not just in the tumbling, 
carefree racing, but in the visual style. 
There’s something unmistakable but 
hard to pin down about OnRush’s look 
that gives it a ‘90s quality. Maybe it’s 
all the primary colored vehicles, or the 
rolling hills of Americana that we could 
swear we drove through two decades 
ago in Ultim@e Race Pro… and yep, 
that’s really how it was spelt. 
With the ‘games as a service’ 
argument proving catnip to online 
opinion-havers currently, we wonder 
what kind of long-term appeal this 
deliberately throwback racer can 
enjoy, and whether it needs such a 
thing to be considered a success for 
Codies. Until next summer though, 
we’re routing for OnRush. Q
“The game director says the 
whole team grew up playing 
arcade racers of old”
A word on 
Evolution’s demise: 
PS4 racer Driveclub 
might have been 
borked at launch, 
but by the time its 
developers closed 
they’d successfully 
turned things 
round. It took years 
of post-release 
support, but 
Evolution should 
be remembered 
extremely favorably 
for its commitment 
to that cause.

If levels full of death lasers,  
exploding red barrels, vehicles to 
drive, and red baddies doesn’t sound 
like videogames distilled into its 
purest form, we don’t know what 
does. This puzzle platformer brings 
all of the classics into one place, 
tasks you with saving prisoners and 
collecting crystals, and ties it all 
together with a simple but engaging 
art style. 
We had a chance to play through 
a few levels of the game—which is 
still so early in development that it 
doesn’t really have a proper story at 
the moment—to see how it handles. 
From the main hub area, you can 
access individual levels that pose 
increasingly difficult challenges for 
you to complete. The first will throw  
a couple of obstacles at you;  
perhaps a wall that can be destroyed 
by a red barrel, and a car to maneuver 
onto a switch to open an unbreakable 
door. Later, enemies will be thrown 
into the mix (robots, aliens, and… 
robot aliens all appear), along with 
lasers that can be directed to

way you’ll find survivors that you

crystals that you need to progress 
and unlock more levels. 
The early levels we played really  
just introduced us to the basic 
physics and gameplay elements, but 
they all came together nicely for our 
demo. In some cases there are a few 
different ways to solve a problem—
you can chuck an explosive barrel, or 
you can just drive a car through the 
wall you wanted to open. Punch an 
enemy, or run them over in the bus 
you’ve just found? Up to you.

As you progress you’ll find more 
interesting vehicles (including some 
featuring pointy and/or shooty bits), 
as well as tougher challenges, like 
alien abduction rays and rocket 
turrets. In some cases you can use 
these to your advantage to help you 
solve puzzles and reach the exit—the 
point here is to experiment to find the 
way out in any way you can. 
Each level will also be playable in 
local co-op multiplayer—although  
we didn’t see this in action during  
our playthrough. We were curious 
about how the camera, which follows 
your little guy around, would handle 
two players on the screen at once,  
but the team showing the game 
hadn’t seen multiplayer in action at 
this early stage.
The success of Mugsters will  
come down to its ability to mix things 
up and present new ideas in each 
level. If it can continue along the  
path that we saw it at during our  
early playthrough, things are looking 
good for this neat indie title. Q

YOU’RE FORCED TO WORK TOGETHER IN  A WAY OUT, 
EA’S BIGGEST LITTLE GAME IN YEARS 
IAN DRANSFIELD
Josef Fares performed motion-capture for the game, and his brother Fares plays Leo
osef Fares is looking animated 
but there’s an eyeful of dedication 
behind his words. “It started out with 
me actually wanting to make a game 
I want to play,” he tells us about A 
Way Out, the game that began life 
about three years ago. The brainchild of Fares, worked 
on by those who made up his team on Brothers: A 
Tale Of Two Sons and backed by a few million of EA’s 
development dollars, its reveal at 2017’s E3 was one 
of the best surprises of the show. A refreshing take 
on the co-operative approach, it tells the story of two 
convicts, Leo and Vincent, on the run from the law who 
have to (and we mean have to, this is co-op only) work 
together to succeed and survive.
But it all came from Fares wanting a game 
that didn’t exist. “I’ve always had an urge to play 
something with my friend that wasn’t just a drop-in, 
drop-out,” he says. “I’m not against those games, it’s 
just that I need something that means something to 
me. I want to play a story together with my friend.” Step 
forward… well, nothing. Unless there was something 
hiding in the recesses, there were no story-based, 
co-op only games out there. After Brothers did well, 
EA’s Patrick Söderlund approached Fares with an offer: 
Make us a game. With $3.7 million on the table and full 
creative control under the EA Originals banner, Fares 
decided he and his Hazelight team would make that 
game he wanted.
Working with EA is a process plenty would warn 
against, and that anti-publisher sentiment has been 
stoked further in recent months. But Fares seems 
immune to any and all of this negativity: “Look, this is 
the person I am now, this is the person I’m going to be 
if I make triple-A titles. Nothing will change,” he laughs. 
“The collaboration with EA has been great since day 
one. They haven’t said a word on what we should do or 
not do, no input at all. We’ve had help with production,

and that’s it… I know there’s been a lot of 
talk about EA… people f**k up sometimes, 
people do good stuff sometimes, I’m not 
really into that. For me, I’m a passion-driven 
man, that’s my thing. I have no problem, I can 
only say good stuff about working with EA.”
 CHOICE OR DECISION
In its three years of development, A Way 
Out has remained incredibly faithful to its 
original ideals—Fares proudly showed us his 
early sketches for the game and how they 
compare to the near-finished product. This 
singularity of vision has led to a focused—
linear—experience that plays out like nothing 
else. While there are narrative-based titles 
out there, your Telltale adventure games 
and whatever Quantic Dream wants to work 
on for the PlayStation, A Way Out stands 
apart from them. For one, your decisions 
don’t actually impact the overall narrative 
structure—something Fares was clear about 
being an intentional design choice. It’s not 
about making one choice or another and 
expecting fresh outcomes; it’s about making 
a decision together and playing out the story 
to completion. An important distinction to be 
made, as since its reveal at E3 A Way Out has 
been placed neatly into the same category 
as the aforementioned narrative games.
Fares is bullish about how his game is 
positioned, though, and openly—happily—
says it’s not going to be a game for everyone. 
“I say if you want to shoot the gas station 
cashier right in the head then, you know 
what, go play GTA. This is not your game.” 
Fares explains, “I don’t care. If I lose a couple 
of gamers with that, fine, go, I don’t care. 
For me, it’s not important. If you want to go 
have a run-and-gun game, go play one. This 
is not for you.” This, he explains, is also why 
he recommends those playing A Way Out 
find a co-op partner who is willing to play 
for a story and cinematic experience—the 
real-life chemistry between players is just as 
important as that between Leo and Vincent. 
“If not, then it’s going to spoil for you this 
kind of experience… This is the vision. Trust 
it, go with it, or let it go. Play something else. 
You have a lot of games out there. Stick 
with your vision, that’s what I’m saying.” 
This approach might be making EA’s PR 
uncomfortable, but it’s a refreshing honesty 
we don’t see much of from those making 
games under the behemoth’s banner. In a big 
part, it’s likely down to Fares’ background.
PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT
Born in Lebanon and fleeing civil war with his 
family when he was just 10 years old, Fares’ 
adoptive home of Sweden would be the place 
that molded him into a film director. He was 
accepted as the youngest student ever to 
Sweden’s most prestigious film school at 
the age of 20 and his debut feature film Jalla 
Jalla premiered to rave reviews and box office 
success, before he even graduated. With 
six features now under his belt, he’s a man 
with a wildly different background to that

“I’m passion-driven. I have no 
problem, I can only say good 
stuff about working with EA”
of most game directors—something he was 
able to show with the haunting, melancholic 
Brothers. But that schooling in the world of 
the movies didn’t quite prepare Fares for just 
how hard it would be to make games, and 
the increased ambition behind A Way Out has 
meant the Hazelight team is working long 
hours to get its game finished, polished and 
out in March 2018.
“My background as a filmmaker has 
helped me out with this game,” Fares says. 
“If you look at the cinematics, look at how 
the camera movements are, look at some 
gameplay ideas—how they are played in a 
sense. I have many ideas on how to take that 
even further.” While it’s clear his passion for 
filmmaking is still present and accounted 
for, Fares is genuinely excited when talking 
about the potential for games: “I think the 
games have a really bright future. It’s really 
exciting where we’re going to,” he says, 
“[But] even if it looks amazing, you need

OPPOSITE Each 
player may have 
a different 
perspective 
on what is 
happening, so 
communication 
is key.
Well, that would be by making a 
game taking all the best parts of—
genuine—co-op experiences and 
putting them together in a game. 
Whether you play as Leo or Vincent, 
the options and approaches to 
situations are always changing—we 
saw two methods of playing through 
a gas station robbery, with the hot-
headed Leo storming in and shooting 
holes in the ceiling, while the calmer 
Vincent strolls in and gently warns 
the cashier of his intention to commit 
a felony. Similarly, another level, this 
one during a prison break, offered 
two distinct methods to pass a police 
checkpoint—over or under a bridge. 
A simple, straightforward decision it 
might be, but one that led to vastly 
different journeys, both of which met 
up neatly in the same ending.
1 SLOW IT DOWN 
There are plenty of moments 
in the game where the action 
will pause and give players a 
chance to breathe. You might 
be talking with a loved one, or 
just playing some darts.
2 CHARACTER CONTRAST 
The two characters are very 
different. Leo will fly by the 
seat of his pants, while Vincent 
does things more calmly. 
Choosing which one to play as 
will alter what you can do.
3 UNIQUE GAMEPLAY 
Like Fares’ first game, 
Brothers, A Way Out will feature 
gameplay systems that may 
appear only once in the game. 
There’ll be new things to try 
around every corner.
4 CHOICES, CHOICES 
Making decisions may change 
how things play out in each 
scene, but the start and end 
points are always the same. 
You’re still able to totally mess 
up and get Game Over, though.
That linearity—again calling back to 
Fares’ filmic background—is part of 
the reason why A Way Out is looking 
so special. Yes, every scene starts at 
A and ends at B, regardless of your 
decisions, but while bigger teams 
with larger budgets are able to slap 
together vast, beautiful, ultimately 
rather sparse open worlds, Hazelight 
is putting together a series of 
environments full of interactivity and 
experiences. Chew the gum. Splash 
the water. Chat with that guy, or 
don’t. Every interaction is bespoke; 
it’s all made to react to specific 
situations, to the characters doing 
the interaction. It’s crafted.
LIMITED MEANS
It’s an impressive feat for a title 
made with just a few dozen staff 
and a few million dollars, and Fares 
maintains his good humor when 
talking about the game’s relatively 
small budget: “I think EA is actually 
quite surprised what we have done 
“I think EA is surprised 
what we have done for this 
amount of money”

choices could do 
to the story.
for this amount of money, actually. 
We’re really pushing the limits,” he 
says. “I sometimes joke that we have 
the coffee budget of Naughty Dog!” At 
the same time, the game-film director 
is under no illusion when it comes 
to the relative freedoms afforded by 
less money: “It is possible that we 
take more risks because we’re not 
a high risk,” he explains. “It doesn’t 
mean you can’t take risks with money 
involved. We have to meet in the 
middle. I don’t like when creative 
people go, ‘We want to make art,’ and 
underestimate that we actually have 
a world we’re living in that needs an 
economy to go around. I don’t like 
when the money people say, ‘This [is 
just] about money,’ so there has to be 
a yin-yang effect, they have to meet 
in the middle.”
Those risks he talks about include 
the demand for co-operation—
including an online split-screen 
mode that allows you to see your 
compatriot’s side of things at all 
times, even if they’re in another 
country—and most interestingly of 
all, the Friend Pass. This is a feature 
of A Way Out that allows one player 
who owns the game to play with 
another, anywhere in the world, so 
long as they have an Xbox One and 
a Gold subscription. Not a level, not 
a side mission, not a time-limited 
segment—the whole game, start to 
finish, completely free. It might seem 
crazy generous, especially from a big 
publisher like EA, but to Fares it’s just 
something that had to be done. You 
have to play in co-op. It had to be an 
option. It just makes sense.
As a movie producer, Fares 
thinks differently about 
games. Here are some of the 
titles that may have inspired  
A Way Out
M O V I E 
I N S P I R AT I O N
1 FROM DUSK TILL DAWN 
Two smart-mouthed criminals 
on the run from the law, one 
cool and collected, the other 
a hothead—it’s pretty much 
blow for blow what you get in 
A Way Out. Obviously that’s 
discounting the whole ‘bar full 
of vampires’ thing…
2 OLDBOY 
A Way Out pays fine homage to 
South Korean classic Oldboy. 
One memorable scene sees 
the protagonist fight his way 
through a seemingly endless 
onslaught of attackers in a 
hallway. Now imagine that, in a 
game, with you playing it. Bliss. 
3 THELMA AND LOUISE 
While Leo and Vincent might 
not be the best of friends at 
A Way Out’s opening, there are 
similarities. Trust. Dependency. 
Strength together. And running 
away from cops. If the game 
ends with a car hurtling towards 
the Grand Canyon, well...

It’s so interesting hearing 
about the unique problems 
this kind of game poses 
developers. I’ve never 
thought about how 
interacting with an object in 
a game would have to work 
differently if another player 
was always watching you.

I’ve been intrigued by 
this one since it was first 
announced. At the time the 
focus seemed to be on the 
prison break aspect of the 
game, but now that we’re 
starting to see more of the 
world outside of the clink I 
can’t wait to play it.

This feels a lot like the TV 
series 24 to me, with split-

happening simultaneously 
across multiple locations.

the show, so I’m hoping 
I’ll find a new favorite in A

SAYS
BETTER TOGETHER
Ultimately, that’s what A Way Out 
comes down to: It makes sense. It 
makes sense Leo and Victor would 
want to work together to escape. It 
makes sense when you come upon 
an abandoned fishing camp and 
one of you sets about fashioning a 
fish-spear while the other gathers 
firewood. It makes sense you then 
have to work together to catch said 
fish. None of it from what we played 
felt crowbarred in, or like it was there 
to tick a box—even the weird bits, 
the ambitious bits, the arty bits, it all 
made sense.
“This game is a cinematic 
experience together,” Fares says. “It’s 
not your typical couch co-op game; 
this is one that actually dares to pace 
down, not to have action moments 
all the time, that dares to stop for 
a moment.” It’s a game that sees 
exciting escapes, guns and violence, 
tender family encounters, driving, 
fishing and more. Even with a small 
team, even with limited resources, 
and even though he openly 
acknowledges you’re not getting 
a Need For Speed-level of driving 
physics in A Way Out, Fares maintains 
the importance of this variety.
“For me it’s a personal thing,” he 
explains. “First of all, diversity is very 
important to keep the experience 
fresh all of the time… Even if [the 
driving’s] not perfect, it’s still good 
enough to get you on the road, [same 
for] the shooting or whatever. For 
me, because it’s a cinematic co-op, 
you want it to be fresh and unique 
all the time… I don’t know what you 
feel about this, but I feel that the 
repetitiveness of games gets me 
bored. Especially if you have a lot of 
repetitiveness in a cinematic game, 
it’s even worse I would say.”
And so A Way Out is a game of 
pacing and variety, not just a one-
trick pair of ponies sending you on 
“This is a cinematic 
experience. It’s not your 
typical couch co-op game”

endless quests to tick boxes off a huge, 
sprawling map. “The important thing is the 
totality,” Fares says. “About the pacing down, 
that’s another thing I think is important in a 
story game—that you actually have moments 
where you take your time and go fishing or 
meet a loved one, so you don’t have to have 
these endless high [tension moments]. I 
mean, what movie has that all the time?”
FEAR OF FAILURE
We’re still a few months from A Way Out’s 
release at the time of writing, but ever since 
its E3 reveal it has been a game to be excited 
about. With that excitement, expectations 
are formed—some a little off the mark, it’s 
safe to say, like the seemingly firm belief this 
would be a big-budget triple-A title. Fares 
takes the comparison as a compliment, 
of course, but it heaps the pressure on 
Hazelight’s project. “I think we all are 
surprised and proud of what we have done 
here.” Fares remains philosophical: “We’re so 
close to the finish line, this is where the real 
hell starts, but it’s going to be good.”
Even with the weight of expectation so 
suddenly landing on the team, there’s still an 
air of confidence from the main man—well, 
we say ‘air’, it’s more like a hurricane. “Let’s 
pretend this game came out, everybody 
says it sucked,” he postures. “That wouldn’t 
affect me. It would be like, ‘Okay, I’m going to 
do it even better next time.’ It’s like, what’s 
the problem of failing? I think the problem of 
being afraid that you’re failing, that’s a way 
bigger problem than actually failing, because 
that’s what holds you back.
“When people say hubris or stuff like 
that—no, I have super respect and humility 
towards the actual production staff. When 
we have a problem, I take it super seriously. 
No, I’m not the guy that wants my team to 
work overtime and I go home at three o’clock 
every day. No, I’m here at the office, I’m 
staying here, I’m with them all the time. We’re 
together on this one, you know? We are 
creating this.”
And if, despite all the effort, A Way Out 
is a failure? Well, to Fares at least, there’s 
no chance of that being the case. “I’m a 
passion-driven man,” he says. “This game 
is like... You know when you really are 
passionate about something, when you’re 
crazy passionate about something, when 
you’re insanely passionate about something? 
I’m beyond that. I breathe, live this game. 
Even if a thousand experts came to me now 
and said, ‘This is a shit game,’ I’ll tell them, 
‘You’re wrong. This is a great game.’ This is 
how much I believe in it.
“You can call me delusional, but I just 
know, deep in my heart, what we’re doing 
here is great.” Q
A Way Out will be released on March 23 2018 
for Xbox One.

stuff in the game like baseball, basketball, 
link four in a row—we have arcade games. 
It’s in the ’70s! It’s the small stuff that 
takes a lot of time to do, [and] sometimes 
my team laugh at me like I am nuts, but 
at the end of the day, you want to make a 
great experience. If you look at my original 
drawings [compared to] the final game, some 
things are exactly accurate.
You’ve already said you’re very confident 
about the chances of the game. Are you 
worried at all?
Not at all. Not at all, really not. You’ve seen 
this. I mean, really, to be honest with me, 
you’re a gamer. Do you believe this is a 
bad game?
No.
Exactly, that’s what I’m saying. Even if 
everybody in my environment says it’s the 
worst game ever, that doesn’t convince 
me. That’s how sure I am. Some people say 
delusion. I can’t help it. I also think this is 
going to a philosophical aspect of it, but I 
really don’t see the reason why people are 
so scared of doing stuff. I think we’re missing 
a lot of great stuff because of this thing 
that’s f**king with our mind. 
From a kind of gameplay perspective, you’ve 
obviously got couch co-op in the game, 
but was it a big challenge getting the game 
online in split-screen?
It’s so hard, because first of all it’s the first 
time we’ve worked together with this new 
Unreal Engine 4 because after Brothers I 
had a break, and then we had to restart. We 
have the split-screen even online because 
it’s part of the story, and normally you don’t 
have that—you have the full screen online, 
and you can get away with some lagginess 
and stuff because you don’t see the other 
[player]. But now you see the other player all 
You said that with Leo and Vincent, you’re 
playing as characters with personality, rather 
than just an avatar with stats…
Exactly. They’re very different characters. As 
you saw in the trailers, Leo is more brash, 
cocky, short-tempered, while Vincent is more 
the calm and cool guy who’s more relaxed. In 
the beginning of the game you’ll get a very 
small idea of who they are—just a little bit. 
That’s pretty much when you choose, so 
you’re not choosing like, he can shoot fire 
and he can shoot ice. You choose what kind 
of person fits you best, you know? I would 
hope that people try to talk to the NPCs... we 
put them in as optional only, so if you wanted 
to see how your character reacts to stuff 
you could, but you can skip them all if you 
want. They’re scattered all over the world, 
and they’re unique everywhere and [have a] 
unique reaction for each character. We’ve 
seen some people just go by them and some 
stop and talk to them.
How much has your vision of the game 
changed as you’ve been making it?
It’s actually quite close, I’ve put up some 
pictures on my Twitter, and it’s actually very 
close I would say. Of course you change stuff 
along the way, because you iterate, you go 
back, you do this and that… There’s a lot of 
stuff I want to put in, but it’s not possible. For 
instance, I’ve taken in a lot of fun minigame

the time, which makes this much harder.
We have figured that out at last, and we’ve 
been working our asses off. Also, because 
of the diversity of the gameplay, every single 
[thing] that goes on in the game needs 
unique code.
Has your personal approach changed 
since Brothers?
Not really. This has been me from the first 
day of Brothers. I had to learn a lot of stuff, 
because I didn’t know anything about games. 
It was very hard, because there was new 
mechanics and stuff, so it was a different 
approach, we had to figure out the game. I 
like this kind of challenge—this is what you 
want. Of course you’re getting this probably 
from other games, but we want to push it, 
push it, push it, push it. Don’t be afraid to 
take those risks. Risks are important to take, 
otherwise nothing new will come up.
Do you think your indie approach can be 
emulated in triple-A?
I hope other developers are inspired from 
this. Sometimes people are, some are so 
afraid, like, ‘Oh, the players [won’t get it], no.’ 
Don’t you like it when someone is like, ‘Hey, 
man, play this. What do you think?’ It’s about 
respect, but it’s not about asking ‘What do 
you want? Okay, here, go.’ That doesn’t make 
sense. We see in Hollywood, every movie out 
there with a big budget is just numbers on 
a board. Trust me, that’s how they view it, 
they start writing, ‘Okay, we should have this, 
this, this,’ and that’s why they each look the 
same. I’m not saying it’s bad, I’m not saying 
that we should take that away, I’m not saying 
everybody should do it. I just think that more 
people could be more risky in what they’re 
doing with this big budget stuff.
In doing so, you might bring more people 
to gaming.
Yes, that’s it. Sometimes it can’t only be 
about the money. It has to be that we’re 
working with something creative here. We 
can’t just say, ‘Money is everything,’ no. 
Again, the other way around is not good 
either. You can’t just take risks. There are 
plenty of big companies out there with 
shareholders and blah, blah, blah, and so on. 
I think with the right approach, we definitely 
can make a change.
And with this approach, are you having fun 
making the game?
Yeah. It’s fun, it’s like, we also did something 
called motion matching. What it is, to give 
you a small technical explanation, some 
“Even if everybody in my environment 
says it’s the worst game ever, that doesn’t 
convince me. That’s how sure I am”
games do this if you do an interaction. What 
you want, you normally have the animation 
starting with the character picking it up, 
right? What you do is in some games, they 
do a cut. When you do a cut, as a player, you 
don’t notice it, you just see the cut and you 
take it. What happens is that they pop the 
player to the correct position. We can’t make 
the cut because the other player can see all 
the time. We need to use motion matching, 
which pretty much means every time you 
push the button, the system knows that the 
object is there, so it has to adapt and then 
the animation starts. This motion matching 
stuff, we have to do it for all walk, all crawl, 
all run, all run fast, all jog slow, all the 
crawling, everything.
What you have to do is you stand and 
crouch a bit, then you have to record every 
angle for every side [for the animation]. I did 
this from the morning to the night, and when 
the day was finished, my toenail fell off. It 
was so painful. That’s true. My toenail fell off. 
This is not normal when you walk in a crouch. 
When the user’s controlling a character, 
[crouch-walking]... I see the tears in my eyes. 
My toenail, totally gone, goodbye.
That must be a part of why the team has such 
faith in you.
Yeah! I don’t care: take my foot, my hand, my 
head... Not my head. Q

OX MAGAZINE

A
ssassin’s Creed was starting to look like a 
franchise whose limits had been explored 
and exhausted in September 2013. In 
October of that same year, it was the hottest 
IP around. Black Flag took only the essential 
recognisable elements of the series and 
superimposed them on a piratical fantasy, 
complete with naval battles, which 
reinvigorated the series. In his first credit as 
game director, Ashraf Ismail had tapped into 
AssCreed’s potential as a historical prism 
through which to experience hugely diverse 
experiences, and in his second—Assassin’s 
Creed Origins—has done it all over again. 
How does he do it? Let’s ask him. 
Black Flag is widely considered to be among 
the best Assassin’s Creed games. What is it 
that you think makes it so popular?
I think first we went after a fantasy that 
hasn’t been seen in videogames in a long 
time, at least to the level of realization that 
Assassin’s Creed is able to achieve. So there 
was a novelty to the fantasy of being a 
pirate, the naval combat, exploring the 
Caribbean. For sure there was something 
unique there I think. It was also a game 
where for almost two years it was mostly 
focused on building content, building the 
world, building various gameplay elements. 
So there was a lot in the package at the end 
of the day, and we had time to polish it, to 
really hone that experience, and tweak and 
tune the naval combat until it felt wonderful. 
I think the naval combat itself was one of the 
stars of the show. There was the novelty 
[factor], but at the same time I think there 
was a depth of gameplay there that was very 
unique and new to AC. There was also the 
first steps of an RPG element which was 
inside the naval combat that I think again 
was very new to the series back then, and I 
like to think people appreciated that, and it 
gave them a lot of time to play the game. 
Were you involved in the initial pitch for 
the game?
Yes, absolutely. I joined the project in the 
very early days. I was, I guess you could say, 
the beginning of the design team, so yes I 
was part of the process of pitching the game.
What was the reaction when you suggested 
pirates as a theme?
I think it was quite well-received very early 
on. AC3 was still in production at the time, 
and they had that naval section to the game, 
so the fact that we were trying to leverage a 
technology that was just being brought to 
the table, the fact that we were taking it to 
the next level was appreciated by the 
company. Very early on the pitch was 
accepted, and it opened the door for us to 
delve deep into that experience. 
The game appeared on both Xbox One and 
Xbox 360—what were the challenges 
involved in making such a huge game world 
for the older console? 
Back then when we started the project, of 
course we knew that the newer consoles 
were coming, but we hadn’t received the 
hardware yet, so we were still building the 
game for the previous generation. By the 
time we got the hardware we had dedicated 
engineers, technical artists, who were 
working for each individual platform. The 
idea was that their job was to make sure 
they would push the consoles as much as 
possible, artistically speaking and also 
rendering from the engine side. So we 
started the project on old consoles, and 
then just made sure we had people in place 
to take advantage of the newer hardware. So 
the transition was actually quite smooth.
Sailing and naval combat were popular in 
AC3. You made it better in 4, and it appears 
again in Origins in a different form. Did you 
always plan to bring it back?
Yes, this was something pretty early on that 
we wanted to bring back. We always felt that 
this was a really powerful aspect of history 
and the world that opened the door for us to 
try various settings, so it naturally made 
sense for us to bring it back. The transition 
from Black Flag to Unity was, well, I wouldn’t 
say it’s a brand new engine, but a lot of core 
elements [were redone]. So things like naval 
[gameplay] went away. We felt by bringing it 
back, even for Origins, it was actually 
opening the door to saying, ‘Can we create 
these exotic experiences in the game? Can

we create something that feels really unique 
and novel to AC but at the same time giving 
us a drastically different experience to the 
ground game?’ So yes, from the beginning of 
the project there was an intention to bring 
back naval [gameplay]. Of course in our 
setting we knew that it was going to be more 
of a pace-breaker and an exotic element 
than at the core of the experience as it was 
in Black Flag. 
The sailing mechanics that your team honed 
are now forming the basis of Skull & Bones. 
How do you feel about your work inspiring 
other games like this?
We were super proud of what we achieved 
on Black Flag, and having that be something 
that’s taken forward to a multiplayer context 
is thrilling and exciting. They’re doing some 
really awesome stuff over there. It’s 
gratifying to know that there was such 
enjoyment from the community that allows 
Ubisoft to go further with it and put more 
effort behind it. It’s incredibly gratifying. 
Is that team coming to you for pointers?
Well a lot of the people who worked on Black 
Flag at the Singapore studio are part of that 
team. Of course early on in the project there 
were a lot of conference calls and 
discussions about best practices and 
learning design concepts, for sure. Having 
said that, this is a multiplayer game in a 
very different world, and they’re pushing a 
lot of progression elements, so the game 
has its own… they need to really define a lot 
of their own design. 
In the past you and your team have talked 
about The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker 
and Red Dead Redemption being inspirations 
for Black Flag. Did you have similar specific 
inspirations for Origins?
We’re always looking at what’s out there, 
at the competition. I love what the 
competition’s doing, they’re pushing 
envelopes, so we need to learn from that. 
Having said that, the initial inspiration for 
Origins, which might sound a bit funny, but it 
was really reflecting off Black Flag. We spent 
a lot of time in the early days reflecting on 
how people were consuming Black Flag and 
analysing what we thought allowed the 
greatly increased amount of playtime. One 
thing we noticed compared to other ACs is 
Black Flag had a really large amount of 
playtime. We reflected on that, asked ‘What 
happened? What was it? Was it really the 
naval aspect, was it something else?’ What 
came out of it was actually the RPG element. 
The naval [gameplay], at its core, was 
actually RPG-based and you had this 
challenge that’s really high and difficult, and 
you had this learning curve and this scheme 
of upgrading your ship. So we took that idea 
and said, ‘OK, can we actually take AC there, 
where it’s not just a certain part of the game 
as RPG, but the whole game is that?’ So that 
was the initial reflection, we really took that 
from Black Flag. That was the induction to 
saying ‘Let’s make an action-RPG in terms of 
Assassin’s Creed’. Again, of course we look 
at what’s happening in the industry, in other 
games, but I would say the core of what we 
started was actually trying to understand 
what happened on Black Flag. It had an odd 
increase of playtime that we hadn’t seen in 
the series before, and so we really tried to 
reflect on that and say ‘Can we take that 
and explode it?’
Do you think with that initial goal, you did 
everything you wanted to do with Origins?
Yes, I mean we legitimately took an open-
world action-adventure game and mixed it 
into being an action-RPG. I feel quite 
confident in saying that, and I think so far 
this is the reception we’ve received, how it 
mixes really well together and feels good. 
And the initial results show the sheer 
amount of play time we have, it’s starting to 
pay off. What’s amazing is that it also 
opened the door for us to push the concept 
of gear and equipment. How do we treat this 
stuff? How can we give it value and 
meaning, in a game that’s grounded in 
history? So we don’t make a realistic game 
but we try to make a credible game. So that 
was a big challenge for us: How can we 
maintain that credibility, but have tons of 
weapons and attribute stats and ability 
points. And I’m actually quite proud of what 
we’ve achieved. It was a very difficult 
mandate that we set ourselves, but I think 
we achieved something with it. 
There must have been a sense of deja vu 
when I’m guessing you got a call from 
Microsoft saying they had another new 
console in the works. How did that affect 
development of Origins?
You’re right, it was a bit of deja vu! Actually 
the transition was the smoothest I think 
we’ve ever had. We literally had the build 
running on the first kit we received within 
two days. Microsoft contacted us, we knew 
what the hardware was going to be, we  
kind of had a first version of the specs.  
“We made sure 
we had people 
in place to take 
advantage of the 
new hardware”

CREED ORIGINS
The attention to historical 
detail and sheer scope 
of Origins makes it an 
absolutely unmissable 
RPG – yes, RPG.  
Magic 
Moments
And having gone through this before, we had 
practice. So we have programmers, artists 
and technical artists who are dedicated to 
each platform, making sure that we can 
push it as much as possible for the Xbox One 
or Xbox One X. We received the hardware, we 
tried to put the game on it, and again it was 
almost seamless. It just started working very 
quickly. There was literally no hitch or bump, 
it just moved forward. And then it was a 
matter of saying ‘How can we push the 
visuals, the content, making sure it shines, 
so that it takes advantage of the hardware?’
One consistently interesting part of the 
franchise is the modern era storyline. There 
have been different approaches over the last 
few games—what was your approach this 
time around?
For the modern day, it was: Let’s pay 
attention to what the fans are saying. There 
were a lot of people saying ‘Let’s go back to 
a third-person protagonist.’ So the element 
we wanted was ‘Can we introduce the 
concept of a new hero or heroine in this 
case, and can we bring back this third-
person element in a world that is now 
starting with [something] new and fresh?’ So 
that’s how we started that reflection. And we 
just went from there. So it was trying to look 
at what fans are saying and seeing how we 
can respond to that. 
There is a bit of a split—some fans love the 
modern-day stuff, others just prefer to just 
spend their time exploring history. How do 
you feel about that split and what can you 
do to get the balance right? 
Yeah I think it’s a fair view of the franchise. 
For sure there are people who love it and 
people who don’t. What we try to do is make 
sure the mandatory moments were as 
frictionless as possible, that we didn’t have 
too many of them. But having said that, the 
option to exit the Animus and go to the 
present-day and look for all the optional 
content was available, so that’s sort of the 
balance we tried to make.
What’s next for you in regards to Assassin’s 
Creed? Do you already have a plan for your 
next game? 
No, right now we’re still supporting 
Assassin’s Creed Origins. We see that there’s 
still value in more content, so there’s two 
DLCs for sure, but also freely available 
content that we’re trying to push. So we’re 
still working on that. A lot of us still need to 
take a vacation [laughs], including myself. 
So I think probably after we ship the DLCs, 
that’s probably when we’re gonna start really 
considering what do we do next. Q

Another rough year is over, readers, and once 
again the trusty  Xbox One  has been one of the 
things that has helped us get through it. We’ve 
explored  incredible worlds,  beating huge bosses 
along the way. We’ve shot at and/or punched 
Nazis to  save the world  from total domination.  
We’ve traveled back in time to  discover secrets  
of the ancient world. We’ve donned the capes 
of  heroes.  We’ve swerved and skidded around 
stunningly  realistic landscapes  without a care in 
the world. We’ve faced new,  terrifying  foes, and 
taken out  entire armies  with the flick of a finger. 
That’s right—2017 has actually been brilliant, and 
we’re about to  celebrate the greatest  games the  
 last 12 months  have had to offer.

INJUSTICE 2
HALO WARS 2
Celebrimbor the not-so- 
friendly ghost
Throwing Superman into 
a T-rex’s face? Ace!
My army is bigger 
than your army
We all have that mortal enemy that 
deserves nothing more than a swift 
decapitation. Perhaps it’s the sketchy-
looking guy who once sold you a 
slightly undercooked corndog at your 
local Christmas market, or maybe it’s 
Bolg the Savage, Orc general in the 
army of the Dark Lord Sauron. In one 
of those situations, you might earn an 
achievement—in the other, you’ll probably 
get life behind bars. 
What we’re trying to say is that the 
Nemesis system is one of the things that 
made Shadow Of Mordor so exceptional 
back in 2014, and Shadow Of War takes 
it to new heights, expanding it in every 
direction. The result is a game that feels 
exceptionally personal, and a story that 
you can shape yourself by choosing your 
own generals and having them fight 
against your enemies to win control of 
Middle-earth. Plus, with an expanded 
world, a combat system that makes 
fighting (and yes, beheading) orcs even 
more satisfying, and a campaign that 
expands Tolkien’s world even further, 
there’s a heck of a lot here for acolytes 
of the author, or just people who want 
to chop up baddies. It looks fantastic, 
too—especially the improved textures 
on Xbox One X. 
Dani is the fighting expert in Team OXM, 
both in videogame terms and in her 
physical prowess on the battlefields 
of game journalism. Of all the fighting 
games that appeared this year, Injustice 
2 was her clear favourite—and not just 
because it featured an angry gorilla 
and a version of Deadshot that wasn’t 
played by Will Smith. Along with some 
nuanced mechanics and neat physics, the 
game also provided some truly standout 
moments—namely the Super Moves that 
saw Superman punch someone 35,000ft 
into the air, and The Flash grab his foe 
and run so fast that he travels through 
time and chucks their limp body into a 
past version of their limp body. Yes, it’s as 
confusing as it sounds.
The other surprising highlight was 
the game’s story mode. Thanks to some 
truly exceptional animation and acting, 
the characters look and feel more real 
than any comic book videogame has 
managed. The interactions between 
individual characters are excellent, and 
mid-fight animations and cutscenes look 
terrific, making this the most authentic 
DC universe game we’ve ever played. 
Oh, and if all that didn’t convince you, 
NetherRealm just added the Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles as DLC. Awesome.
Few expected the Halo franchis to spawn 
a real-time strategy spinoff that put you 
in charge of armies instead of a lone 
hero with a deep voice and a computer 
pal. Even fewer were expecting it to be 
good enough to warrant a sequel, but 
here we are, a few years later, chatting 
about whether a Grizzly is more useful 
than a Condor, and discussing those 
exceptionally-animated cut-scenes over 
a steaming mug of coffee.
Halo Wars 2 offers fans of tactical 
action a triple-A experience on Xbox 
One—a console that isn’t typically known 
for its real-time strategy games—and 
does so with aplomb. Whether you’re in 
it for the story, which takes place shortly 
after the events of Halo 5: Guardians, or 
just like blowing up aliens from on high 
like some ultra-violent god/goddess, this 
game offers some outstanding strategic 
play with all the polish you would expect 
from a Halo title. It’s the little things that 
count here; the menus, the music, the 
constant references to the background 
lore of the series… everything adds up 
to a game that feels like an authentic 
Halo experience. In a year without a full 
Halo FPS release, this was the dose of 
Spartans, Warthogs, and Needlers that we 
needed, and it delivers in style.

Warren’s worrying obsession with Destiny 
was just starting to show signs of abating 
this year. The shakes had subsided, he’d 
stopped wearing a cape to work, and he 
no longer referred to Dani and Steve as 
his ‘fireteam’. Then Destiny 2 appeared, and 
now he keeps whispering to his Ghost.
The guy would have gone nuts if 
we hadn’t put this game in our top 10. 
Thankfully, any unpleasant scenes were 
avoided, because—surprise, surprise—
Bungie still knows how to make a damn 
good shooter. Destiny 2 ticks all the right 
boxes. Guns feel meaty and satisfying, 
like a weird, bullet-spewing steak. The 
story is expanded, and features some 
excellent voice acting—you actually 
feel like there is a reason for you to 
be shooting lots of stuff. Oh, and then 
there’s the real reason people play: 
Multiplayer. More DLC, more raids, and 
more shiny purple and gold things to 
collect are always going to make people 
happy. Destiny 2 shows that Bungie 
learned lessons from the first game, and 
the result is an exceptional shooter that 
is sure to keep players coming back for 
months as more content appears. Even if 
that new content makes all the weapons 
you spent hours earning feel like you’re 
throwing watercress at the Flood.
COD has seen a tough couple of years. 
2016 saw the release of Titanfall 2, 
Battlefield 1 and Overwatch, which 
together make one of the most impressive 
trios of shooters in recent memory, 
and this year sequels to Destiny and 
Wolfenstein released around the same 
time as the new COD title. Activision had 
to up its game to survive, and with the 
realse of WWII, it went back to its roots 
and created a classic war story with a 
multiplayer that added something new.
Rhe return to the 1939-1945 setting 
gives new life to the franchise, bringing 
back the gritty realism, frantic action, and 
tight, controlled gunplay that fans of the 
series have been missing for the last few 
years. It also brought back old guns that 
take freaking months to reload. 
Of course, multiplayer is the real meat 
of this series, and it’s where the biggest 
improvements have been made. The new 
Headquarters online hub is a revelation, 
offering players a place to chill, chat, and 
relax outside of the frenetic gunplay, but 
jump into a match, and you’ll be treated 
to well-designed maps and a smart 
class system that helps you play to your 
strengths and get the edge over other 
players in combat. It’s a welcome return to 
form for the series.
Let’s be clear—Forza games always look 
good. They always feature tracks that are 
incredibly realistic, and cars that look so 
good you can almost smell the leather. 
But Forza 7 takes things to new levels of 
realism. If you’re playing this on Xbox One 
X with a 4K TV, your eyes might actually 
fall out and roll across the floor. We’ve 
seen it happen.
We guess that’s one of the advantages 
of being an internal Microsoft studio, 
though. Turn 10 were heavily involved in 
the creation of the console previously 
known as Project Scorpio, allowing them 
to tune the game alongside the console 
to squeeze the most out of its terraflops 
(not a euphamism). The results are 
clear, too—right now, this is the best 
looking game on the new console, with 
astonishing weather and particle effects 
to complement the photorealistic cars.
Of course, it’s also an exceptional racer. 
You’ll find hundreds of cars across dozens 
of disciplines in its digital showrooms, 
so you can create your own garage of 
affordable little hatchbacks that get 
excellent MPG and would be a safe choice 
for a small family, or a collection of highly-
tuned supercars. It’s an outstanding 
racing sim, and a great way to show off 
that new 4K TV you just bought.

+ crockery = brilliance
Fixing history, one 
bullet at a time
We’ve said it before, and we’ll say 
it again—there are few things more 
satisfying that punching a Nazi right in 
the face. Wolfenstein has always excelled 
when it came to providing this simple 
pleasure, and The New Colossus took 
everything we liked about the previous 
Xbox One entries, then added a bunch of 
stuff, moved the action over here, and 
threw in Adolf Hitler for good measure. 
Can you punch him? You’ll have to play it 
and find out.
You won’t regret it, either. The game’s 
story, while absolutely outrageous, is 
extremely well-done, and somehow 
MachineGames manages to go from 
exploding giant Nazi robots one minute 
to a touching, personal cutscene 
involving genuinely interesting characters 
the next. Even better—exploding the giant 
robots feels fantastic thanks to more 
brilliant gunplay and the option to duel-
wield any weapons you want to create 
the killer combination. Add this to the 
atmospheric and oddly Germanic United 
States that MachineGames created, and 
you’ve got a shooter that ticks so many 
boxes its pen has run out. Sure, realism 
goes right out of the window, but that’s 
all part of the fun. If you haven’t played 
through this one yet, it’s time to load up.
When Warren asked whether Steve had 
played Resident Evil 7, his eyes widened, 
his skin paled, and he almost fainted (You 
said you wouldn’t tell anyone about this! 
Jeez.—Ed) Turns out, Steve really doesn’t 
do horror games—so the fact that it’s on 
this list shows just how good the latest 
Resi really is.
Call it a reinvention, call it a 
reimagining… call it ‘mother-f***er!’ as 
you leap out of the chair and drop your 
controller into a cup of coffee. Whatever 
you call it, this first-person adventure 
brought the Resident Evil series bang 
up to date while keeping hold of those 
key aspects that made the originals 
so damn good. Save rooms, herbs, and 
limited ammo supplies meant you could 
never relax, and inventive (and genuinely 
terrifying) bosses meant that every fight 
was packed with thrills. It’s hard to pick 
just one highlight when the game is 
packed with so many memorable and 
petrifying moments, but when Jack 
literally kicked his way through the wall 
next to us as we were running for our life 
during the first section of the game, we 
came worryingly close to needing a new 
pair of pants. There’s no doubt that this 
horror masterpiece deserves a place on 
this list, even if Steve is a big wuss.
Few games have had a longer build-up 
than Cuphead. This was in development 
for almost seven years—from what we 
have been told, that’s older than some 
human children. Turns out, hand-drawing 
every frame of a videogame is actually 
really time-consuming, especially 
when you keep adding extra stuff like 
platforming levels to your game. 
After all that time the pressure was on, 
too. Fans were expecting great things 
from the cartoon side-scroller, and here 
in OXM Towers we had more than one 
conversation that started with a sentence 
like “what if we’ve been waiting all this 
time and Cuphead… isn’t good?” 
We needn’t have worried—StudioMDHR 
delivered a stunning adventure title 
with sumptuous graphics, rock-hard 
bosses, and inventive design choices. 
Few games will challenge you as much as 
Cuphead, but it’s got that magic feature 
that few games manage to capture: You 
always want to have one more go. This 
time. This is the one where you beat the 
giant mummy, the angry stage actress, 
or the mermaid-turned-medusa. Co-op 
somehow makes the game more difficult, 
but jump in with a group of people, and 
this is one of the best local multiplayer 
experiences you can have on Xbox One.

ASSASSIN’S 
CREED ORIGINS
Stab, swim and wall-run
like an Egyptian
There was some serious discussion 
in OXM Towers over our top three. The 
team gathered around the list to discuss 
it, and there was a lot of pointing and 
gesticulating. Mostly, though, we kept 
it civil, and after a quick arena-style 
knife fight in the office, we came to an 
agreement. For the scale, the game world, 
the beauty of the game on Xbox One X, 
and the frankly ridiculous amount of game 
packed in there, Assassin’s Creed Origins 
has topped our list, and taken the title of 
Game Of The Year 2017.
From having a chat to Cleopatra to 
literally punching an elephant to death, 
from digging through lost tombs to 
getting lost in the desert and having 
‘visions’, there is so much to this game 
that it has to be seen to be believed. 
After a year’s break from the usually 
annual releases, the pressure was on for 
Origins to do something different, and 
deliver something new for the series. 
This time around that meant a reworked 
combat system that feels more tactical, 
an expanded RPG system that changes 
the way you progress through the game, 
and a game world so massive, so mind-
bogglingly huge, that we actually felt a 
bit sorry for the Ancient Egyptians who 
had to journey across it without fast 
travel points.
We sometimes use the word ‘stunning’ 
to describe things in OXM, but there’s 
no doubt that seeing the game for the 
first time on Xbox One X will stun you. As 
you peer off into the horizon, or paddle 
through the Nile, you’ll realize this is the 
ultimate historical playground. Now if 
you’ll excuse us, there are a few hidden 
tombs for us to uncover…

Lucky’s ﬁrst game was a VR-exclusive title that launched on the Oculus Rift in 2016
There’s been a lot of controversy surrounding EA’s 
latest offering thanks to the inclusion of loot boxes, 
raising questions for the industry as a whole, but 
how does  Star Wars: Battlefront II  (p62) actually 
feel to play? Check out our in-depth review to see if 
it’s worth taking a dip into space as Luke Skywalker 
and his heroic pals. Not keen on navigating all of 
that space debris and Twitter debate? Then next up 
we’ve got something simpler—a good old racing 
game with  Need For Speed Payback  (p66). With 
car upgrades and personal REP to build up, it also 
has some tough progression issues to navigate, but 
is it up to the challenge? Next we have some good 
news for those who like to play God, with the release 
of  The Sims 4  (p70) on Xbox One—finally. It’s the 
perfect way to make yourself and your potential 
crush live together to see if you’re truly compatible, 
or if they’ll just burn everything they cook and have 
a mishap because they didn’t go to the bathroom 
quickly enough. For the next step, make sure to 
freak out your actual crush by telling them what you 
did—that’s how romance starts, right? We’ve got 
one last adventure this month, and it’s the return of a 
platformer that’s full of bright locations and charming 
characters. So if you’re in the mood for something

This is what 
happens when 
dutiful fan service 
gets conflated with 
good game design. 
For DICE, were the 
focus of this exercise to merely let 
players engage in a little harmless 
interactive nostalgia, then Star Wars 
Battlefront II could be considered 
something of a success.
Much like its predecessor, 
Battlefront II can so often feel like the 
Star Wars experience that you had 
always dreamed of playing. Because 
where else could you revel in the thrill 
of taking ground on Hoth while deftly 
dodging AT-AT fire? Or pushing 
through the dense forests of Endor 
with a lightsaber in hand, slicing away 
at Ewoks? What other developer has 
ever let you bring ruin to the streets of 
locations such as Theed and Tatooine 
with blaster fire, the environments so 
sumptuous in 4K that they look 
positively unreal? And then, when you 
tire of on-the-ground action, the 
game helps you change gears entirely; 
venturing into space, twisting 
delicately through atmospheric 
wreckage from the cockpit of an 
X-Wing—the scream of incoming TIE 
Fighters a taunting assault on the 
senses, your imagination brought to 
life as an extension of your fingertips. 
It’s all very exciting, and it’s all very 
lovely. But, remember! This is how they 
got you last time. 
Keeping it real
Star Wars Battlefront II is a visual and 
audio marvel. DICE has, once again, 
delivered an unprecedented level of 
detail to its sprawling multiplayer 
battles, capturing the sense of place 
and unbridled joy that has helped 
enshrine the Star Wars films in so 
many hearts across the globe. The 
worlds you visit are brilliantly realized, 
and the audio is so exceptional that 
we want to find the sound designers 
and shake them warmly by the hand. 
And all of this comes together nicely, 
all of it works—for a time. The problem 
here is that Battlefront II suffers from 
many of the same problems that also 
plagued 2015’s Star Wars Battlefront. 
While it may indeed remind you of why 
you love the Star Wars franchise, any 
extended time in its presence will 
leave you wanting more—or worse, 
making you question that deep-
seated Star Wars love you hold.
While all of the visual, audio and fan 
service trappings are there to arrest 
your attention, look beyond the 
surface of it all, and you’ll see that 
DICE has failed once again in its 
efforts to bring any substantial depth 
or staying power to the Battlefront 
experience as a whole. The game 
quickly becomes two-dimensional 
once the initial shine of nostalgia-
induced adrenaline wears off, 
revealing stale, languid, gameplay 
staged across some of the most 
gorgeous sets ever created for a 
multiplayer service.

While the content on offer has been 
greatly expanded in almost every 
facet of the game—answering a direct 
criticism levied at the original title—
much of it is either obscured behind 
an obtuse and confrontational 
progression system, or hidden behind 
some simply bewildering system-end 
decisions. Forty years of Star Wars 
magic quickly loses its shine, 
particularly when you realize you can’t 
shoot a Gungan in the face. 
The basic movement and shooting 
mechanics are still light and—
particularly when compared with other 
popular first-person and third-person 
shooters that you could instead 
sacrifice your time to—relatively 
unresponsive. DICE has still failed to 
incentivize objective play, making its 
starring multiplayer mode—Galactic 
Assault—something of a drag. Map 
rotation is a nightmare, forcing you to 
endure the same set-up over and over 
and emptying lobbies as players go 
off in search of lands unseen. Weapon 
unlocks, career progression, and 
customization is also so unwieldy that 
you’ll wonder whether DICE is actively 
trying to push you away from the 
experience by design. 
Battlefront II succeeds in small 
doses, but lacks any real depth or 
nuance where it counts. Was Star 
Wars the right fit for a huge, 
blockbuster multiplayer-focused 
shooter? Given how much of a running 
joke the aiming, accuracy, and 
survivability of Stormtroopers has 
been in the films for decades; given 
how much DICE is clearly struggling to 
build out an experience that feels fit 
for casual play, albeit one with the 
long tail and staying power of one of 
its Battlefield games—we’re inclined 
to say no, no it isn’t.
Extra vision
That’s where we were hoping EA’s new 
studio, Motive, would be able to bring 
more value to DICE’s overall vision. The 
studio was charged with delivering a 
single-player experience to the 
package, of answering the loudest 
and most direct criticism fans could 
muster back in 2015. Kicking off 
during the fall of the Galactic Empire, 
the campaign was supposed to bridge 
the time between Return Of The Jedi 
and The Force Awakens. Created in 
collaboration with Lucasfilm Story 
Group, it tells the story of Iden Versio, 
an elite Imperial Special Forces 
commander that becomes a last line 
of defense as the debris from the 
second Death Star begins to rain 
down across Endor. Part of the official 
Star Wars canon, and a first proper 
opportunity to play as the bad guys, 
it’s been the source of fever-pitch 
levels of excitement for months now. 
Sadly, Motive has delivered a brisk 
five-hour campaign that quickly veers 
from its intended path, impressing in 
small doses but failing to hit the mark 
where it counts (sound familiar?). The 
concept, of following the Empire as it 
seeks to maintain order and enact the 
last orders of its fallen Emperor, are 
quickly discarded for a far more 
predictable and traditional story. An 
incredibly strong start gives way to 
huge leaps in logic and predictable 
twists; the inevitable turn from Empire 
to Republic comes so quickly for 
Versio that you’ll struggle to follow her 
motivations, particularly for any of you 
that have read the tie-in Inferno 
Squad novel. 
It’s a shame, because game writers 
Walt Williams and Mitch Dyer have a 
concise and clear command of the 
Star Wars universe and the characters 
that inhabit it. Versio, played 
fantastically by actor Janina Gavankar, 
is a wonderful addition to the canon 
that we’d love to see more of and 
spend more time with. Sadly, the 
campaign never really gets its pacing 
right, like parts of the story were 
gutted during production. 
Critical scenes and crucial 
emotional beats are MIA, with so much 
of the story seemingly happening off 
screen, told while we are forced to 
endure unwieldy standalone chapters, 
pushed into the shoes of various hero 
characters that feel decidedly 
unheroic to control. It’s a complaint 
that also crosses over into the 
multiplayer, truth be told. Every time

Motive breaks away from Versio’s core 
story it feels like a mistake, like you 
are checking out locations, 
characters, and story-beats that 
someone in a suit insisted went in. 
Where the narrative itself will leave 
you wanting more, the actual 
construction of the campaign fares in 
a similar fashion. You’ll feel as if you 
are simply running through a series of 
increasingly isolated shooting 
galleries. Never do you feel as if you 
are an elite Special Forces group—
Star Wars: Republic Commando this is 
not. Instead, you’ll begin to feel it 
pushing you from location to location, 
an obvious excuse to show off more 
and more of the brilliantly-realized  
arenas the game team has created. 
There’s promise here, but the 
mechanical problems that bring the 
multiplayer down are ultimately a 
blight on the single-player experience 
as well. 
Multiplayer menace
With 14 multiplayer maps and 40 years 
of history to draw from, you’d expect 
to see a little more depth and nuance. 
Battlefront II is certainly an 
improvement over its predecessor, on 
almost every level—but that’s a low 
bar of a quality to clear. It still lives 
and dies on how much you want to be 
inside of Star Wars, and once that 
thrill dies (and trust us, it always does) 
you’ll pretty soon be wondering 
whether your time might be better 
spent elsewhere. 
The responsiveness in control has 
been noticeably improved, although 
even that is tempered by a lack of 
general survivability and a surprising 
lack of feedback—more often than 
not, by the time you realize you are 
being shot at you’ll already be staring 
at the respawn screen. Factor in some 
odd spawn-point placements on the 
larger maps (a hangover from 
Battlefront) and you’ll find nostalgia is 
quickly worn away by frustration. 
Even Criterion Games’ sublime 
Starfighter battles can’t save the 
experience; ships are more 
responsive, the controls a little tighter 
and the battlefields more impressive 
than before, bringing the thrill of the 
dogfights to life in a way we hadn’t 
anticipated. Sadly it suffers in a 
similar fashion to other parts of the 
Battlefront II experience. The thrill 
eventually disappears, and all that 
you’ll be left with is a beautiful, hollow 
exercise in fan service. 
Star Wars: Battlefront II is a true 
technical achievement. The way in 
which DICE, Motive and Criterion have 
been able to accurately capture the 
sights and the sounds of this universe 
is genuinely impressive—everything 
froom the size of the sparks that fly 
from the lightsabers in multiplayer, to 
the intricacies in movement in the 
Stormtroopers throughout the 
campaign, it all seems so right. Sadly, 
the same cannot be said of the 
content and feel of the game itself—
exciting in fits and starts but 
ultimately shallow. The progression 
system is an unwieldy blight on the 
game, while the way in which modes 
are managed will prove to be a 
constant source of frustration. 
Battlefront II is more Rogue One than 
The Empire Strikes Back; you’ll be 
entranced by it initially, because it’s 
Star Wars, but it won’t take long 
before you find yourself wishing for 
that little bit more. Q
At the time of 
writing, EA has 
removed all 
microtransactions 
from Battlefront 
II following a 
consumer backlash. 
The progression 
system, still tied 
to the notion of 
opening loot crates 
to unlock abilities 
and upgrades, is 
still an unwieldy 
mess though. It 
isn’t a satisfying 
method of career 
progression, 
leaving too much 
of the multiplayer 
experience down 
to chance; there’s 
more content here 
than in Battlefront 
II’s predecessor, but 
you won’t likely ever 
get your hands on 
the majority of the 
Star Cards.

It’s beginning to 
feel like the title of 
this series is a cry 
for help rather than 
a statement of the 
game’s motivation. 
Need For Speed Payback is the third 
entry in the series developed by 
EA’s other Swedish studio, Ghost 
Games, and it’s the second time in a 
couple of years we’ve been hit with a 
thoroughly underwhelming—and very 
slow—racing title.
Thrust into the pseudo Las Vegas 
world of Fortune Valley, players 
are tasked with taking control of a 
bunch of insipid individuals and the 
cars they drive, performing heists, 
improving your crew’s reputation, and 
taking on The Man—well, The House, 
as it’s actually called. And yes, very 
early on one character delivers the 
line, entirely free of irony, “The House 
always wins”. This is the level of 
storytelling we’re dealing with here.
Now, it would usually be the  
easiest thing in the world to look past 
said story and get straight into the 
game proper, but Payback doesn’t 
operate on ‘usually’ terms. Instead, 
it’s an area that has to be focused 
on, owing to the fact that the game 
itself pushes the narrative so heavily.  
How anyone involved thought this 
would appeal to those who’ve 
actually seen the—genuinely 
charming—Fast And Furious movies 
is anyone’s guess, but there you go. 
Instead we’re left with a bunch of 
cocky, gurning mannequins with all 
the likeability of an ingrown hair. You 
would actively want the characters 
you play as to lose, were it not for 
the fact you’re up against even more 
mind-numbing figures of authority 
and power.
But enough on that—the game. 
The speed. The cars. Need For Speed 
Payback does throw you into the 
middle of a large, open world ripe  
for cruising around and exploring.  
It’s gorgeous at times, and while  
the geography might be 
questionable—how such vastly 
different natural habitats exist in 
just a few (hundred) square miles 
is uncertain—there’s a nice array of 
desert, mountains, canyons and city 
to explore. Not forgetting a couple of 
truly lovely bridges to just stare at in 
the distance. Wonderful.
When you do veer towards the 
missions and challenges Payback 
offers, you get to take part in a 
mixture of event types with each of 
your three main characters. There’s 
straight-up racing, package delivery, 
drifting, drag, off-road, getaway 
driving, and a few others. It’s a fine, 
varied selection that keeps things 
fresh in the opening few hours, and 
the switch between characters for 
each style of driving is a nice little 
touch—even if it just means you’re 
hearing different inane quips from 
the crew.

Progress is initially straightforward, 
but there’s something pointed out 
to you early on that soon becomes 
vital to getting any further: Your car’s

numerical value, and one that makes 
sense to help indicate a manner of 
progression, but it’s also where the 
grinding sets in, and where loot boxes 
make themselves very much known.
Speed Cards are won for 
completing races, with each random 
drop offering up a reward that can 
improve one of six different aspects 
of your vehicle. If you’re too low a 
spec to win an event—and you will 
be, soon enough—you’re required to 
do one of two things: Replay races to 
win a random Speed Card that might 
not actually improve your ride, or 
look to shipments for the chance to 
unlock better cards. 
The latter approach involves, of 
course, in-game currency—and that 
currency, while earned in-game, is of 
course earned much quicker by just 
buying it with real cash. And there’s 
the rub: Progress isn’t paywalled at 
all, you can get through the game 
without spending an extra penny, but 
it will be slow, it will involve a lot of 
grinding, and it will sap your will to 
continue playing.
Maybe if Payback had a stronger 
core experience to it this would be 
easier to justify, but the simple fact 
is this is a vanilla Need For Speed, 
offering little in the way of thrills, 
and nothing to recommend it over 
contemporaries in the racing genre. 
We have the Forza series on Xbox; 
there is zero need to pick up Payback 
as long as those games exist. Hidden 
‘derelict’ cars might keep you coming 
back to hunt them down, and the 
process of upgrading a car from junk 
to world-beater is always fun. But 
there’s just nothing captivating here: 
It’s formulaic, offers no surprises, and 
is (as was the case with 2015’s Need 
For Speed) surprisingly slow, even at 
hundreds of miles an hour.
A very straight road
If you want a corporate vision of 
anarchy supported by dead-inside 
characters, endless gambling puns 
and an internal logic that allows  
stock police cruisers to easily catch

see every day in 
real driving.
forgive some of Payback’s more 
egregious failings. The fact is, NFSP 
can be enjoyable, and hits some high 
notes with regards to how it looks 
and the game world itself.
Almost everything else ends 
up missing the mark, though, and 
you’re left with a game that seems 
determined to push you out of its 
embrace with boredom, while at 
the same time demanding you put 
in far more time (or money) than 
you otherwise would. It’s a bit of a 
confused mess, and isn’t worth your 
time. Avoid, unless you find it cheaper 
somewhere. Q
It’s not common 
to tell folks they 
should lower the 
difficulty of a game 
to get through 
it—usually it’s a

it’s easy to suggest 
you jump straight

Just a couple of 
months after Sonic 
Mania’s paean to 2D 
was widely hailed 
as a return to form 
for Sega’s veteran 
mascot, here’s a swift regression to 
the bad old days of semi-interactive, 
hands-off 3D Sonic and his godawful 
furry friends.
Countless instantly forgettable 
characters from Sonic’s extended 
family crop up here, cannon fodder in 
an all-out war against the villainous 
Dr Eggman. After Sonic himself falls on 
the battlefield, his pals briefly mourn 
the loss—“I can’t believe he’s really 
gone,” says one, ominously—before 
recruiting yet another character to 
continue his life’s work of running 
really fast and collecting rings.
The newcomer is known as the 
Rookie, and is cobbled together from 
various animal parts by you, the 
player. Once you’ve settled on an 
underlying species, you can dress 
it up in all sorts of cosmetic items 
until it seamlessly blends in with 
the wider Sonicverse. We opted for 
a bird with purple metallic lizard skin 
and the head of a monkey. There are 
endless configurations, and after 
each level you’re showered with yet 
more costumes, should you be having 
second thoughts about your design.
In this post-Sonic world, life goes 
on for the whole bug-eyed menagerie 
until one of them casually mentions 
that their spiny leader isn’t actually 
dead, but has been held prisoner 
for the last few months in Eggman’s 
orbital Death Egg. Surprise! Another 
level passes, and somebody else 
remarks that not only is Sonic alive 
and incarcerated, Eggman has also 
been torturing him for fun. At this 
point they finally decide to mount a 
rescue mission, a daring raid that, like 
most of this short game’s short levels, 
takes about three minutes to do.
Pair up
With Sonic freed, subsequent levels 
alternate between Sonic alone, the 
Rookie alone or the two of them in 
tandem. There isn’t a huge difference 
between them, but Sonic has a lock-
on warp attack while the Rookie gets 
a variety of weapons. With the pair of 
them running together, you can use 
both abilities.
Levels generally have a mixture of 
into-the-screen 3D bits and side-on 
2D sections. It’s always fast, and 
the background graphics are great, 
but it’s remarkably bland to play. The 
parts that look the most exciting are 
generally those where control is taken 
out of your hands in order to show off 
some flashy camerawork. The majority 
of the game involves little more than 
charging mindlessly from left to right, 
watching your character get swept 
around some ‘spectacular’ helter-
skelter sort of thing, then speeding 
across the finish line a little later.
Most enemies can be easily 
avoided, you’ll wind up with the 
maximum 100 rings very quickly, so 
there’s no point seeking out hidden 
stashes of them, and there are 
few surprises beyond a handful of 
brief boss fights. It’s a game that’s 
probably better to watch than it is 
to play, and only by resisting the 
temptation to skip the numerous 
cutscenes will you stretch the 
running time towards the four-hour 
mark. Younger players might find 
it a bit more manageable than the 
considerably more demanding Sonic 
Mania, but Sonic Forces is the kind 
of thing that made fans yearn for a 
return to basics in the first place. Q

After a seven-year 
absence from 
consoles, EA’s 
hugely successful 
virtual dollhouse 
returns to Xbox One 
by way of a belated conversion of the 
best-selling PC game of both 2014 
and 2015.
There are few rules or objectives for 
living in the sandbox world of The Sims 
4. You can micromanage every aspect 
of your residents’ lives or leave them 
to get on with it, but since it’s a shiny, 
happy place of perpetual sunshine, 
populated by over-friendly people 
who can’t stop talking nonsense, we 
thought it might be the perfect place 
to try starting a cult.
So we created Ted, a charismatic 
joker with a dark side, and moved 
him into the largest plot of land in 
the fragmented town. He was going 
to need all that space for his palatial 
living quarters and ‘re-education’ 
dungeon, and we set about building 
something befitting his aspirations.
The building menus offer a huge 
variety of items, from ready-made 
rooms to bare walls that you draw with 
a cursor and furnish from scratch. 
Items are filed in several ways—you 
can click on a picture of a house to 
find parts, or view them sorted by 
function. You can also search by text, 
which isn’t ideal on a console, but is 
still a quicker way of locating some of 
the more obscure items.
Same as it ever was
This is the full-fat PC game, not so 
much adapted for Xbox as ported 
across unchanged. There are no 
larger fonts to make text more visible 
from across the living room, and the 
primary control method is to push a 
cursor around the screen with the 
thumbstick, which is imprecise and 
often frustrating. But you do get 
absolutely everything from the base 
Sims 4 game, which is an enormous 
amount of content.
All of that furniture comes at a 
price, though, and by the time we ran 
out of cash we had a two-room hovel 
that would rent for about a grand a 
week in London but in the pristine 
Sims world was barely fit for a trailer 
park. The cheapest narrow windows 
gave the interior an authentic prison 
cell ambience, and a lack of funds 
to finish the walls meant that the 
kitchen and bathroom became part of 
the main open plan living space. With 
only the toilet as a water source, Ted’s

personal hygiene soon took a turn for 
the unpleasant.
Thinking maybe our grand plan 
for Ted was just a non-starter, we 
decided to forget about him and start 
over with a new SIm on a cheaper 
plot. Sorry Ted, they probably don’t 
even have a cult leader career path 
in the game anyway. But that’s when 
we found we could actually send a 
newly created Sim to move in with 
him, bringing $20K in fresh funds as 
a housewarming gift.
Pretty soon Ted was living in the 
mansion of his dreams. When he felt 
sad because he didn’t have a pool, we 
brought in a couple of new recruits, 
and built him one while he slept. 
When he expressed a passing interest 
in learning to play music, we added 
some more Sims, pocketed the money, 
and built him a concert hall.
We got into a routine of jumping 
into the character creation screen, 
quickly randomizing a new Sim and 
sending it straight round to Ted’s 
place, but this is where we eventually 
fell foul of the game’s lack of 
concessions for console play. We’d 
been leaving the Xbox in sleep mode 
between sessions, in the mistaken 
assumption that major events such 
as a new housemate moving in were 
triggering an autosave. One night 
a dashboard update must have 
happened, because the next day 
the console had restarted and we 
noted with horror that Ted had lost 
five followers, $100,000 and an entire 
wing of the house we’d spent so long 
battling the controls to create.
Sense of closure
Despite it having had over 20 patches 
on PC since launch, criticisms 
from the original version still apply 
here. The lack of an open world is 
particularly disappointing, with the 
town divided into tiny lots separated 
by lengthy loading screens that 
will soon put you off the idea of 
travel. Sims go off to work during 
the day—Ted managed to find a gig 
as a standup comedian—but you 
can’t follow them around town, you 
just have to read about what they’ve 
been up to.
The focus of the game is narrow, 
particularly when compared to The 
Sims 3, and while it took a bit of

eventually building 
them all bedrooms 
grew tiresome. Our 
solution was to hold 
regular ‘going away’ 
parties at the pool. 
We’d invite four or

You only need to 
spend a few minutes 
in the latest LEGO-
based romp from TT 
Games to realize just 
how slick the dev’s 
take on virtual brick building has 
become and how much it loves Marvel. 
Much like LEGO Batman 3: Beyond 
Gotham, LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 
revels in the sheer depth of its source 
material. Sure, you’re getting Thor and 
Hulk in their Ragnarok-style threads 
and Doctor Strange finally rendered in 
minifig form, but you’ll also unleash 
cute mayhem as Gwenpool, leap into 
fan-favorite heaven with Squirrel 
Girl and stretch your body into every 
proportion possible via Miss Marvel. 
Free of the constraints of having to 
fit into a specific film storyline, LMSH2 
delves into Marvel’s back catalogue, 
and creates the most rewarding use 
of a big license yet.
True believer
With the terrifically retro Kang The 
Conqueror on baddie duties, the 
introduction of time travel offers up a 
convenient conceit for navigating the 
annals of comic lore. Not only does 
it bring a new spin on environmental 
puzzles and character abilities (such 
as turning Baby Groot into his regular-
sized version), it also introduces new 
hub world Chronopolis. 
Rather than plumping for a single 
locale (such as the use of New York 
in LEGO Avengers), the new setting is 
made up chunks of familiar locations 
stolen by Kang, and it’s one of the 
strongest features. Being able to 
web-swing through a Spider-Man Noir 
take on Manhattan before emerging 
into the space-set Celestial skull that 
is Knowhere taps perfectly into the 
weird and wonderful DNA of Marvel.  
However, while Peter Serafinowicz 
brings Kang to life with perfect 
cringe, the rest of the cast has far 
less self-awareness. Too many of 
the voices sound totally unsuited 
to the characters, while others end 
up as poor attempts to emulate the 
bigger stars of the MCU. Still, Ian 
Livingstone’s evocative score does 
heal some of those auditory wounds. 
From the myriad mood, tone, and 
aesthetic of Chronopolis, to the jungle 
ruins of Wakanda, every flourish helps 
raise up LMSH2 that little bit more.
But for all its creativity and deft 
use of humor, there’s a real sense 
of mechanical fatigue that sets in 
every time a cutscene ends and you 
return to the game. You’ll explore 
broad, often open-ended levels (both 
in single-player and with a friend in 
local co-op), using each character’s 
unique powers to solve environmental 
puzzles, defeat bosses and smack 
down waves of goons. It works, but 
there just isn’t enough innovation to 
differentiate from a long line of similar 
licensed offerings.
It’s not all familiar territory, 
thankfully. LMSH2 does benefit from 
more unusual level designs (such as 
an underwater section with Captain 
Marvel and Iron-Man, and a later 
aerial dogfight in the boots of Captain 
America and Star-Lord). You’ll certainly 
never get bored playing through the 
extensive campaign and unending 
passion for all things Marvel.
All in all, LMSH2 is energetic combo 
of platforming, lighthearted brawling, 
and irreverent humor that will keep 
you entertained for hours. It’s just a 
shame that behind all those heavy 
nods to fan favorite characters 
lies a game that riffs on past LEGO 
successes without actually bringing 
anything new to the blocky table. Q
WHAT IS IT?
Another slice 
of Danish brick 
building and light-
hearted brawling.
WHAT’S IT LIKE?
It does little to 
break the LEGO 
formula, but it’ll 
make you smile.
WHO’S IT FOR?
Kids of all sizes 
who want to see 
the MCU and the 
comics collide.

You could say “they 
don’t make ‘em like 
this any more” but, 
as Yooka-Laylee 
proved, ’90s-style 
3D platformers are 
making a resurgence. So they actually 
do. Not that we’re complaining. 
Cartoon animals were once rife in the 
industry, providing us with some of 
the greatest game worlds ever seen, 
so it’s refreshing to see another furry 
mammal jumping around on Xbox One. 
This particular cartoon critter is a fox 
named Lucky who gets sucked into a 
magic book, saving his sister in the 
process. It’s up to you to guide him 
through the usual themed worlds, 
collecting lucky clovers, and beating 
the ‘Kitty Litter’—a bunch of bandits 
who want to steal the book for their 
own nefarious plans. 
If it sounds derivative, it absolutely 
is. There’s virtually nothing original 
here whatsoever, which is quite an 
achievement. There are marble-
rolling sections that channel Super 
Monkey Ball, auto-run sections like 
every late 2000s iPhone game, and 
side-scrolling sections reminiscent of 
Castle Of Illusion’s Xbox 360 remake.  
The simple life
Despite (or maybe because of) the 
extreme sense of familiarity, seasoned 
gamers will at least be instantly at 
home and able to enjoy the simple 
pleasure of jumping around these 
colorful levels, knocking cute mice 
off high platforms into the foggy 
abyss, and swooshing your bushy tail 
at anything that moves. Or, indeed, 
anything that doesn’t, as even 
parts of the scenery are interactive 
to some degree, yielding hidden 
coins, diamonds and occasionally 
secret fox-holes that let you delve 
underground into hidden areas. 
Younger gamers may well think Super 
Lucky’s Tale is the best game ever 
made. If it had come out in 1995, it 
probably would have been heralded 
as such. 
But anyway. Where does the 
‘Super’ come into its name? There 
was indeed an original Lucky’s Tale, 
but if you’ve never heard of it, that’s 
not surprising—it’s an Oculus Rift VR 
exclusive. That game’s level design 
was very simplistic, but the team has 
revised that completely, adding layers 
of depth and complexity that make 
this a much more substantial offering.  
The level design is exemplary, with 
neat surprises, chain-attack potential 
and a nicely weighted difficulty curve. 
Levels are locked off behind portals 
in a hub world (yep, never seen that 
before—cough) and, with a bit of 
perseverance, most players should 
be able to collect the main clover 
at the end. But there are actually 
four clovers in each level, so you’ll 
need to accumulate a set number of 
paw coins, five letters spelling out

‘L-U-C-K-Y’, and a secret, ever so 
carefully-hidden extra clover in order 
to clear each stage completely. That 
often means replaying levels and, 
thanks to the fox-like cunning used to 
hide the best bonuses, it rarely feels 
tiresome. Some of the secrets require 
serious skill and observation to 
unearth, so what looks at first glance 
like a throwaway, cutesy platform 
game actually turns out to offer some 
hardcore platform action. The humor 
might raise a smile or three, and there 
are enough clovers (99 of them) to 
ensure several days’ play even for 
seasoned platform veterans.  
Burrowed time
It’s not all good, though. The timed 
alarm clock sequences can frustrate, 
as they demand precise burrowing, 
and you only get one chance at them 
if you fail, which means reloading the 
level to have another go. There are 
also too many ledges and nooks that 
look like deliberate places for secrets, 
but just turn out to be awkward, out-
of-bounds areas. It’s also odd to see 
camera control so restricted—perhaps 
in a holdover from its VR roots, you 
can only glance left and right a little 
with the right stick.   
Lucky’s move list isn’t vast, but 
what’s there works nicely, such as an 
invaluable double-jump that adds a 
little wiggle-room to your aerial antics. 
You can also burrow underground 
using the triggers, which helps 
solve some puzzles and smashes 
some blocks when you charge them 
from below. You’ll likely pick up the 
movement feel very quickly, allowing 
you to focus on the task in hand 
rather than basic navigation. But 
with some iffy collision detection on 
platform edges and slightly sluggish 
controls on a base Xbox One, it’s not 
quite as sharp as it could be. 
You get a lot for your money, 
although it’s probably best treated

your dose of daily cuteness. It feels 
too lightweight to really satisfy, and 
come the last quarter of the game you 
may wonder if you could be playing 
something more worthy of your time. 
That’s never good.
Still, this is a solid, challenging, 
thoughtfully-designed platformer that 
quietly outshines many of its recent 
competitors—and at a very nice price, 
too. Worth checking out, particularly if

up to a full, native,

60fps. But it also 
has a marked effect 
on playability. That 
extra update speed 
makes control 
more responsive 
and the game is far 
better as a result, 
to the point where 
stepping back down 
to the base version 
is quite jarring.

Rockstar’s evocative 
detective sim sure 
ain’t Grand Theft 
Auto: Old Timey 
Los Angeles. This 
sprawling crime 
drama may take place in an open-
world, but Cole Phelps’ slow-burning 
police work couldn’t be further 
removed from Trevor Philips’ chaotic 
carnage if it was arresting GTA V’s 
psycho over parking violations. 
Looking for stereotypical sandbox 
shooting? Then this fascinatingly 
flawed adventure isn’t for you.
LA Noire Remastered is a curious 
beast. When this neo-noir thriller hit 
Xbox 360 in 2011, there was nothing 
quite like it. Six years on, that’s still 
the case. This is a cerebral game that 
rewards the sort of eagle-eyed types 
who pour over the little details, not 
chaos-seeking Just Cause 3 fans. 
A typical hour of LA Noire involves 
slowly picking up and rotating objects 
while looking for clues, then studying 
virtual faces in obsessive detail. 
In that regard, this gently taxing 
sandbox is more like Telltale’s Wolf 
Among Us than GTA. Say what you will 
about its ponderous detective work 
or freaky mo-capped faces: There’s 
no other game that explores the dark, 
oddly mundane aspects of crime-
fighting like LA Noire.
Cole in one
If the original passed under your 
radar, here’s a quick primer on this 
redux. You play Cole Phelps: An 
ambitious, buttoned-up cop working 
in Los Angeles circa 1947. When you 
first step into Phelps’ shoes he’s 
a lowly uniformed patrolman who 
spends his nights hunting down 
nobodies over misdemeanours. 
Before long, Cole cracks a murder 
case, and shortly after you’re 
guiding him up the food chain of 
the LAPD, taking on all manner of 
murders, arson attacks, and criminal 
conspiracies. 
Does LA Noire’s cutting-edge 
face tech still possess the graphical 
voodoo to make you rub your eyes in 
disbelief? Not quite. Nevertheless, 
there’s no question that the game 
remains an exceptionally acted, 
genuinely compelling piece of 
storytelling. That said, the once- 
revolutionary MotionScan system 
really doesn’t hold up too well. The 
textures in this remaster may be 
sharper, but they can’t disguise the 
fact that many of LA Noire’s crooks 
and witnesses look like they’ve 
undergone botched plastic surgery. 
Though the animation is expressive, 
every character’s skin appears to 
have been pulled over their skulls, 
then stuck on with sellotape and 
prayers. It rarely looks natural. 
Where MotionScan continues to 
pay dividends is in the game’s riveting 
interrogations. Every case that hits

360 version, but the basic principle 
remains the same... even if the 
system remains a bit vague. 
In essence, you either choose to 
believe what a person is telling you, 
shout at them because you think 
they’re lying, or flat-out accuse 
them of wrongdoing by linking 
their statements to contradictory 
evidence. It’s here, as you’re trying to 
pick a response, that those uncanny 
valley faces earn their stripes. 
Sometimes perps ham it up 
royally, all nervous eye gestures, 
obvious facial ticks, and shame-
faced gurning. Then there’s the 
sort of suspect who’d clean up on 
poker tours—devious souls who 
give nothing away short of the odd, 
barely visible darting glance. Trying 
to spot tiny visual tells on these 
otherwise placid faces is a real thrill, 
and correctly coaxing a confession 
out of a suspect feels like flooring a 
heavyweight foe in the 12th round.
Face the facts
Sadly, LA Noire’s problems begin to 
pile up when you step outside of 
the interrogation room. It’s here the 
game fumbles its lines. The biggest 
problem? It simply doesn’t feel like 
a Rockstar game. That’s because it 
isn’t. Instead, this remains very much 
a production of the now-defunct 
Team Bondi. The Australian studio 
went bust in controversial style years 
ago, and it’s plain to see they were no 
Rockstar North. GTA V’s sumptuously 
buttery car handling makes way for 
jittery steering, where old clunkers 
sputter along wide, samey roads with 
“A cerebral game 
that rewards the 
eagle-eyed types 
who pour over 
the little details”
RIGHT A homicide 
case takes Cole 
to a Hollywood 
movie set. Are 
those plaster 
elephants?!
the finesse of 70-year-old dodgems. 
Elsewhere, the game’s rare shootouts 
are stiff affairs that display none of 
Max Payne 3’s firefight finesse.
As a nod to neo-noir movies like 
LA Confidential, this glacially paced 
sleuth-‘em-up is a meandering  
yet occasionally delightful curio. 
A sharp script and superb scene-
setting mean you won’t forget 
Cole’s grizzly cases. Just don’t go in 
expecting drive-bys, bank heists and 
biker-stomping sociopaths. Q

(or full-fat 4K if

It’s been a too long since we’ve hauled some goods 
through space in  Elite Dangerous  (p82). We decided 
to dive back in recently to a star system where an 
alien race has been preying upon other wayfarers to 
see if we could find them ourselves. Elsewhere we’re 
celebrating the Final Fantasy series’ 30th birthday 
by taking a look back at the most overlooked FF 
game— Final Fantasy XI  (p86). The first MMO in the 
series and still going today, this slice of history was 
available on Xbox 360 until as recently as the start 
of 2016 before becoming a PC exclusive again. We 
explore the impressive legacy of this less-played 
gem that’s just passed its 15th birthday. Since 
we’re in a happy mood with all of that anniversary 
celebration spirit, let’s talk about the things we love, 
like long walks, roast dinners, and the movement 
mechanics in  Titanfall 2  (p90). We can’t stop talking 
about how graceful we feel prancing around as 
both the pilot and titan. You can’t always be happy, 
though—sometimes you need something moody 
and gritty, which is why we’re also taking a look at  
 10 terrifying dystopias on Xbox  (p92) for all the best 
spots to brood or feel oppressed in gaming. Each 
one is only a little less horrible than one of OXM 
Towers’ infamous party nights—pained screams and 
forced labor make for wonderful background music 
to dance to...

Earlier this year, 
something strange 
started happening 
in the spaceways 
of Elite Dangerous. 
Players were 
being pulled out 
of hyperspace, seemingly at random, 
and attacked by bizarre, semi-
organic starships. These odd craft, a 
mysterious new addition to Frontier’s 
simulated galaxy, were agile, 
powerful, and able to effortlessly 
destroy the ship of any pilot unlucky 
enough to attract their attention. And 
I wanted to meet them.
The problem is, there’s no surefire 
way to encounter these beings. Named 
Thargoids after a warlike insectoid 
race from Elite lore, but still technically 
unidentified, some players will never 
meet them at all. But there are a few 
ways to increase your chances of 
having a close encounter, discovered 
by the game’s dedicated community, 
one of which involves flying to a 
distant star system.
I travel to the fringes of the galaxy, 
to the Pleiades sector, and dock at 
a base in the Maia system. A colony 
has been established here, one of 
the furthest in the galaxy. And it’s 
probably no coincidence that alien 
activity around Pleiades has risen 
sharply since its construction. Some 
pilots think this is alien territory, and 
their sudden aggression is a reaction 
to us creeping into their neighborhood, 
although considering the fact that 
they’ve never communicated with 
anyone and prefer to shoot first, we 
may never know. All we can be certain 
of is that they hate us. 
But they aren’t invincible either. 
Despite their intimidating appearance, 
veteran players in battleships have 
destroyed them. Me? I’ll be happy just 
to see one. My tiny cargo ship wouldn’t 
last a second in a dogfight.
As I fly around the sector, I pick up 
scattered signals from what my ship’s 
computer describes as a ‘non-human’ 
source. I choose one at random and 
investigate, but when I drop out of 
supercruise I don’t find any Thargoids. 
I do, however, see the flaming wrecks 
of some Imperial ships and a green 
substance splattered on their hulls. 
Seems these guys had a close 
encounter of their own.
I try another signal, and find even 
greater devastation: The wreckage of 
a whole Imperial fleet. Burning fires 
and a peculiar green haze hanging 
in the air suggest the Thargoids may 
have ambushed them—and recently. 
But there are no alien wrecks, making 
me wonder if this was a one-sided 
fight. These beings mean business, 
and suddenly the idea of meeting one 
doesn’t sound terribly appealing.
First contact
But it’s too late. I investigate another 
handful of dead-end signal sources 
before finding myself face-to-face 
with a Thargoid ship. I feel a shiver of 
unease when I see the flower-shaped 
craft looming ahead, poking around 
in the wreckage of more destroyed 
Imperial ships. That only increases as 
it slowly turns to face me, lighting up 
and emitting a sickly green light from 
its, er, petals?
A spotlight shoots out of the center 
of the ship. I keep my distance, but it 
appears to be scanning me. I’d read 
about the Thargoids being aggressive, 
but this one seems more curious 
than violent. It moves towards me 
with a ripple of energy in its wake. I hit 
reverse and slowly drift backwards, 
and the ship seems to lose interest, 
returning to the wrecked ships, 
scanning them one by one.
Then it jumps away, leaving a cloud 
of swirling gas and electricity behind it. 
Why have these beings taken such an 
interest in human starships? And why 
didn’t it attack me? Giddy with the thrill 
of having encountered alien life for the 
first time in Elite, I hunt for more non-
human signals in the hope of getting a 
longer and maybe closer look at one of 
those eerie biomechanical ships.

About half an hour later, I get lucky. 
I drop out of supercruise and see 
another Thargoid ship in the distance, 
scanning wrecks. This time, I notice 
that the green light coming from its 
center seems to be a tractor beam 
as well as a scanner. It yanks a cargo 
canister from one of the Imperial 
wrecks and sucks it into its hold, and 
a plan forms in my head. What if I gave 
the Thargoids a present?
I look in my hold and find 
a canister of domestic 
appliances. I’m not sure 
how interested the 
aliens are in microwaves 
and toasters, but it’s all 
I have. I drift close to the 
ship and eject the cargo, 
and I’m amazed to see the 
green beam shift over to it. 
It scans it for a few seconds, but 
doesn’t seem interested in what I have 
to offer, and returns to the derelict 
ships. It’s a diplomatic embarrassment.
Battle stations
So I decide to do what humans do 
best when diplomacy fails: Attack. 
I engage my hardpoints and fire a 
volley of missiles at the Thargoid ship, 
knowing full well that I won’t survive 
the beating that’s to come. The alien 
ship swivels around rapidly to face me 
and glows with a fiery red light, making 
a menacing mechanical shrieking 
sound as it releases a swarm of tiny 
insect-like drones.
The drones swirl around 
the ship in a perfect circle 
formation, then suddenly 
come rushing towards 
me. Within seconds 
my shields are down, 
exposing the hull. Then 
my canopy shatters, 
leaving me exposed to the 
cold vacuum of space. The 
drones continue to pummel 
my ship and my cockpit spits 
sparks and smoke. Then I explode 
in a ball of fire without so much as 
scratching the alien craft.
Well, I don’t know what I was 
expecting. Even commanders with 
kitted-out Anaconda battleships 
struggle to take down a Thargoid, and 
I’m in a low-level industry starship 
with base-level arms. But meeting 
an alien was ultimately worth having 
to cough up the insurance money to 
get a new ship. They’re every bit as 
awe-inspiring and coldly terrifying as 
I thought they would be.
I love how Elite Dangerous  
developer Frontier has remained 
largely tight-lipped about who exactly 
these aliens are and what they want.  
It adds a layer of intrigue and mystery 
to the game it would otherwise lack, 
and makes a chance meeting with 
one of these creepy ships even 
more special. I’m sure we’ll see more 
Thargoids in the Milky Way in the  
next few months, and I’ll be staying 
well away. Q

Considering 
the somber 
atmosphere, the 
squalid conditions, 
and the growing 
trend for headless 
corpses, I really 
shouldn’t be having this much fun. 
“Didn’t you study history at school, 
Dom?” cries the haughty-sounding 
voice of reason inside my head. 
“The French Revolution isn’t meant 
to be fun.” “Sorry, can’t talk,” I cry, 
leaping off Notre-Dame cathedral with 
a massive grin on my face. “Those 
guards down there aren’t going to 
stab themselves.”
I’ll admit it, I’m a big Assassin’s 
Creed fan. Yes, I know, that’s like 
publicly describing yourself as a ‘COD 
fan’, but we’ve all got series that we 
adore, warts and hilarious technical 
glitches ‘n’ all—and the history-
editing, haystack-bothering world of 
AC is mine. (I even quite like COD, too. 
You probably do as well, even if you 
won’t admit it.) As deep as my fandom 
runs—and by deep I mean the amount 
of money I’ve wasted on overpriced 
statuettes despite knowing better—
I’m not blind to entries that just didn’t 
work or were plain broken in places. 
But Assassin’s Creed Unity just isn’t 
one of them. 
Now that Origins is doing 
well, it’s finally become 
cool again to like hiding 
in patches of long 
grass while wearing a 
hood. But back in 2014, 
liking the franchise 
was as faux-pas as 
you could get. First 
impressions saw to Unity’s 
demise—some unfortunate 
technical glitches got the dreaded 
GIF treatment, while a poorly worded 
response from the game’s director 
in response to its lack of female 
characters in co-op, sent Unity’s good 
graces to the guillotine.
But Unity doesn’t deserve that kind 
of legacy. For all its technical issues 
at launch, it paved the way for all the 
games that followed, bravely breaking 
away from the old mechanics that 
typified the games on an older 
generation of consoles. It didn’t 
rely on a mechanic or feature that 
seemingly didn’t fit the series (don’t 
get me wrong, I love Black Flag, but 
it wasn’t really an AC game), instead 
Ubisoft Montreal doubled down on 
the things that mattered—creativity, 
player agency, and stealth.
Paris match
Even now, three years on, 
the ‘black box’ mission 
and level designs blow 
me away. It was the 
first time the series 
finally took a long hard 
look in the direction 
of the ever ingenious 
Hitman series and gave 
us countless ways to 
infiltrate, hunt, and finally slay our 
designated prey. When paired with a 
partner or three—a co-op system that 
proved a worthy addition, despite the 
controversy that was branded upon 
it—Unity’s sense of scale and sheer 
opportunity bloomed.
Creating distractions, dealing with 
guards in synchronized displays 
of bloody bladework, or using 
conveniently placed scenery to 
usher your target’s departure from 
this world, Unity was a playground 
designed to enhance all the things 
that made the first few games 
so vital. The way NPCs could be 
used to create a riot is still… well, 
a riot, but the renewed focus on 
stealth provided more scope for 
those looking to complete jobs with 
less blood spilled on the carpet. 
Even the overhaul of the climbing 
mechanics gave mantling a fresh 
burst of adrenalin. 
So, a few NPCs might get stuck 
in some cobblestones while you’re 
rushing down the bank of the Seine. 
Some might occasionally pop out to 
watch some public beheadings and 
forget to, quite literally, put their face 
on. But that won’t stop Unity from 
proving itself one of the franchise’s 
most underrated gems. Some first 
impressions deserve a second look. Q

A superb sandbox 
that follows an outlaw 
in 1911, as he hunts 
former friends against 
the backdrop of the 
American Frontier’s 
final days. 
Cowboys are 
awesome. If 
anyone tells you 
otherwise, hock 
a dirty wad of 
chewin’ tobacco in 
their face. All right, 
you probably shouldn’t spit at anyone, 
but you most definitely should revisit 
Rockstar’s iconic Western. With Red 
Dead Redemption 2 swiftly galloping 
towards a spring release, now’s the 
perfect time to jump back into the 
saddle with John Marston’s original 
open-world epic. 
Thanks to Xbox One’s exhaustive 
list of backwards-compatible tiles, 
I’ve recently gotten reacquainted with 
Red Dead Redemption. Even though 
this wondrous Wild West smash hit 
is almost seven years old, it remains 
one of the best sandbox games ever 
made. Don’t believe me? Just wait 
until you get to that magic musical 
moment in Mexico. 
Marston’s sweeping frontier 
adventure is so much more than 
its expertly chosen soundtrack, of 
course. José González’s haunting 
“Far Away” may woo your ears, but 
its Red Dead’s mesmerizing Wild 
West world that’ll forever capture 
your heart. Rockstar has since taken 
sandbox scale to new heights with 
Grand Theft Auto V’s masterfully 
varied Blaine County, yet no 
game before or since has 
ever captured the same 
captivating sense of 
time and place quite like 
Red Dead Redemption. 
Made up of two 
fictional American 
states, and a generously 
sized approximation of Mexico, 
Redemption’s map pens a mournful, 
longing love letter to classic Western 
iconography. Even after all these 
years, the Old West playground 
Rockstar San Diego built has the 
power to elicit stunned silence. 
West of all time
This is the same majestic, unshakably 
lonely landscape master moviemakers 
John Ford and Sergio Leone so 
expressively brought to life in The 
Searchers, or Once Upon A Time In 
The West. Solemn, sweeping and ever 
so slightly sad, Red Dead’s yawning 
deserts, claustrophobic canyons 
and jagged mountain ranges offer 
the perfect, disquieting antidote to 
the obnoxiously noisy cities so many 
lesser sandbox games churn out.  
Ride along with the last of the buffalo 
as you drink in the sprawling greenery 
of the Great Plains. Crank your 
cowboy’s virtual neck skywards 
admiring the jutting sandstone 
buttes dotted around 
Alta Cabeza—a faithful 
facsimile of Utah’s iconic 
Monument Valley. Feel 
a pang of sympathy for 
Marston, as the out-of-his-
element outlaw suspiciously 
eyes early 20th-century 
automobiles sputtering around the 
cobbled streets of Blackwater. Red 
Dead Redemption is a poignant tribute 
to the dying days of the Old West; one 
that makes you cherish every moment 
exploring its lonesome landscape.
Nor do lead characters come 
more compelling than John Marston. 
Unlike the constant conveyor belt 
of criminal jerks GTA has rolled out 
since 2001, Redemption’s charismatic 
cowboy is a fundamentally decent 
man. Is he capable of cold-blooded 
acts? No question. Yet even as he 
hunts his former gang while acting 
as a government patsy, the steadfast 
devotion he shows for his family is 
always there. Wonderfully brought 
to grizzled, compassionate life by 
Rob Wiethoff—who sadly no longer 
works in the industry—Marston is 
a conflicted, complicated killer, yet 
ultimately, someone you pull for.
The ravages of time can often erode 
older games’ appeal. That’s just not 
the case with Red Dead. Its crunching, 
somewhat stiff gun battles may have 
been topped by modern sandbox fare, 
but few titles can match Redemption’s 
rapier-sharp script, fascinating lead, 
or that magnificent Western world. 
As Arthur Morgan rides into view 
with Rockstar’s follow-up, it’s hard not 
to daydream about pristine 4K prairies 
on Xbox One X. In the here and now 
though, few lily-livered open-world 
pretenders have ever matched this 
Xbox 360 masterpiece. Q

RETROSPECTIVE
FINAL FANTASY XI

A game that kept players busy on 
its servers for 15 years, a game that 
became the highest-earning Final 
Fantasy of all time, a game that 
somehow managed to mix everything 
players loved about classic Final 
Fantasy with everything that made 
World Of Warcraft great.
Players around the world fell in 
love with Final Fantasy XI’s brave 
amalgamation of SNES-era Final 
Fantasy flavor and unique take on 
the MMO genre. The title wasn’t just 
a repetitive rally of fetch quests, 
populated by towering monsters ruling 
over a barren world—no, instead 
Final Fantasy XI offered players a real 
JRPG-level story, punctuated with 
cutscenes that really grasped the 
tone and aesthetic of the world.
After a pretty awkward launch—
European and American 
players coming late to a 
game Japanese fans had 
been getting to know for 
17 months isn’t the best 
setup for an MMO title—
the game eventually 
settled into place back 
on the Xbox 360. The 
initial offering of content, 
combined with the group play 
aspects, were mind-blowing for 
console players only just starting to 
venture into massively multiplayer 
gaming: Coming from something like 
Halo 2, Final Fantasy XI was a whole 
new world—one which felt wildly 
different, but thanks to its series-long 
history, also remarkably familiar.
Tunes of glory
The game’s music was also in line 
with other Final Fantasy games. It has 
one of the best OSTs in gaming as a 
whole—and would set the scene for 
later iterations and developments 
by Final Fantasy XIV, too. The game 
only leant on veteran Final Fantasy 
composer Nobuo Uematsu for a few 
tracks, making the maestro’s tracks 
feel like cameos—allowing them 
to carry the melodic weight they 
deserved when they swelled up over 
the din of battle. The rest of the game 
was largely worked on by a newer (but 
no less talented) composer Naoshi 
Mizuta, and as such it has a distinct 
aural flavor that allows it to stand 
apart from other FF entries. And rightly 
so, with it being the first MMO.
And because Final Fantasy XI is 
the first MMO in the franchise, it really 
had room to innovate. It innovated 
within the series, and it innovated 
within the genre. From its purely 
functional setup—being an MMO with 
international servers that allowed 
players from all over the world to 
inhabit the same games—to its auto-
translate features that allowed 
communication between 
players, no matter where 
they’re from, the game 
seemed to understand 
the core tenets of 
what makes an 
MMO feel special, 
feel homely.
The game also 
managed to tread 
that fine line between 
being mathematically viable as 
an RPG and pushing players into 
working out mad DPS sums, while also 
knowing that it needed to provide 
players with gear—and lots of it. Final 
Fantasy XI once again set a precedent 
for other MMOs in the series by making 
fashion a large part of the game. Not 
only did you want to present your 
avatar to the world to reflect whatever 
chosen past, race, and class you had, 
but also all of this gear was vitally 
important in battle.
Thanks to an innovative system the 
game introduced allowing you to set 
up macros before specific attacks, 
your character could quickly equip

maximize the damage of every attack, 
round out the benefits of every buff, 
and make the most of every second 
of battle time. It meant that you didn’t 
just need a singular setup to beat 
dungeons—it meant you needed a 
whole damn wardrobe. That really 
appealed to some players, and has 
likely inspired the fashion elements 
of later games, too (see also: Destiny 
and Monster Hunter).
That focus on fashion was 
supported by the game’s other 
innovation: The job system. Anyone 
that had picked up a Final Fantasy 
game decades before knew this is 
largely what the series traded on, but 
Final Fantasy XI pushed this idea into 
new places. There was a freedom in 
XI’s job system that made the grindy 
parts of the MMO experience (and they 
were present) feel less like a chore 
and more like one of those episodes 
in a long TV series dedicated to 
‘characterization’, rather than plot 
progression. It was a remedy to a part 
of the MMO that turned many players 
off, and it was executed extremely well.
Never quit
Think about it: Rival MMOs at the 
time (and even some today) force 
you to quit out of your world, return 
to the title screen and start again 
if you want to play around with 
another class setup or build. Not 
Final Fantasy XI. No, Square Enix’s 
first take on the MMO allowed you to 
effectively hotswap classes, level 
them whenever you like, and return 
to your ‘parent’ build on a 
whim. From Ninja to Blue 
Mage to Bard to Dragoon to 
Dark Knight—all your favorite Final 
Fantasy classes were available to 
try out (at least by the time 
the final expansion was 
released), and each 
one made it feel like you were playing 
a wholly different game.
This varied functionality is perhaps 
down to how well combat handled 
overall: The game was optimized for 
pad play on the Xbox 360, and it’s 
from there that the combat became 
so unique. Where other MMOs at 
the time focused largely on having 
you click around, hotkey, tap icons, 
and get lost in the target lines and 
damage numbers, Final Fantasy XI 
seemed to dial it all back a bit, play 
at a slower pace, rely on strategy, 
timing, focus.
Liaising with your allies to time a 
set of powerful attacks and spells 
together would create a Skillchain or 
a Magic Burst—and seeing the insane 
damage you could do to a boss 
when these tactics were perfectly 
executed generated a thrill that you 
can never replicate in single-player 
games. There’s something about the 
collaboration, the shared goal, the 
shared skill and timing that comes 
with burning health off a boss that 
MMOs seem to celebrate. And thanks 
to the way all the systems in Final 
Fantasy XI came together, it made 
these bits nothing short of magical.
It’s odd that these moments of 
shared jubilance are what many 
players took away from the game as 
its standout moments, because from 
inception, it seems like that’s what 
Square Enix may have planned. The 
game released with no PvP option—
and at the time it was criticized for 
that—but that seems like part of the 
great plan, as far as the developers 
were concerned. The result was a 
distinctively strong community, one 
that is still lauded as one of the most 
inclusive in MMOs today. 
Perhaps it was the way the game 
led players into teaming up, perhaps 
“Final Fantasy XI offered a safer place, 
a more mature place, a place where 
people stood side by side”

it was because of the base game’s 
significant difficulty curve that had 
elder players ‘sherpa-ing’ newer ones, 
or perhaps it was because of the 
generally upbeat and utopian nature 
of the world it was set in… something 
in Final Fantasy XI encouraged players 
to grind away at the evils of Vana’diel 
in unison, and that in itself made the 
game a safe and special place to be. 
At a time where the toxicity of online 
gaming was brewing like borborygmus 
in the bowels of the fledgling MMO 
community, Final Fantasy XI offered 
a safer place, a more mature place, 
a place where people stood side 
by side, healing and buffing, rather 
than standing off against each other, 
cursing and trolling.
All good things…
Despite all this, though, Final Fantasy 
XI’s launch really wasn’t that great. A 
protracted sign-up/sign-in process 
and a slow-burning start—on top 
of the monthly subscription—
prevented many players from picking 
it up on Xbox 360. On PS2, hardware 
requirements and peripherals kept 
players away, too. By the end of its 
launch year, Square Enix had deemed 
the product ‘unsatisfactory’—but 
when the 360 started to mature a 
little and the console attach rate 
started to rise, something wonderful 
happened. It was like Microsoft had 
used a tuft of Phoenix Down on the 
game, and delivered this wonderful 
series anomaly into the hands of a 
hungry new audience.
Back in the golden days of the 
Xbox 360—circa 2006—Final Fantasy 
XI was the sixth most played game 
on Xbox Live. Six years later, Square 
Enix president Yoichi Wada publicly 
announced that the game was the 
most profitable game in the Final 
Fantasy series. Think about it: That 
means the game exceeded the profits 
from even Final Fantasy VII—the 
game that everybody holds up as 
introducing the JRPG to the console-
playing masses of the West.
Final Fantasy XI remains one of 
the few MMOs out there to keep its 
monthly subscription cost. Granted, 
other (bigger) games may have 
usurped the title’s popular status 
since 2006, but the likes of World Of 
Warcraft, Star Wars: The Old Republic 
and many more besides have since 
gone free-to-play in an attempt to 
prevent hemorrhaging players bases. 
Final Fantasy XI has never had to do 
that—and while it’s no longer playable 
on the 360, fans eager to get stuck 
into the game can still launch into the 
game on PC and see what a unique, 
genuinely pleasant experience is on 
offer inside. Q

WHY I LOVE...  
MOBILITY IN 
TITANFALL 2
Respawn raised the bar with its movement systems in Titanfall,

so powerful it will literally knock an 
enemy’s vacuum-sealed helmet off. 
There are no really weak links in 
this regard, either. Leap into a match, 
and you won’t find that every player is 
using the grappling hook and a single, 
all-powerful weapon. The options on 
offer are numerous, but without fail, 
they’re all excellent. With thousands 
of possible combinations, there is 
space for every player to find their 
ideal loadout. You’ll regularly see a 
team representing every different type 
of pilot, whether it’s those that can 
turn temporarily invisible, or those that 
prefer to temporarily phase into 
another dimension every 
now and then. No matter 
the type you choose, 
they all have the same 
basic wall-running, ass-
sliding techniques—but 
some might also have a 
grappling hook instead of 
the invisibility, allowing them 
to move higher and faster.
Titaned up
What does mean for minute-to-minute 
gameplay? First, it forces you to think 
differently about the environment. 
See those two adjacent buildings? 
They don’t just make a narrow alley 
any more—that’s two surfaces to leap 
between to chain your wall-runs. That 
random radio spire? Fire your grapple 
at the top, swing around it and you can 
There are few 
feelings better 
than sprinting 
along a wall while 
spraying bullets 
into the idiots 
below you, before 
grappling to another wall and sticking 
someone with a grenade. No, I’m not 
talking about my daily commute into 
OXM Towers—I’m talking about the 
astonishing mobility tools at your 
disposal in Titanfall 2.
Respawn’s first Titanfall got a 
perfect 10 from OXM back when it was 
first released thanks to its heady mix 
of fantastic gunplay, well-designed 
maps and giant robots that punched 
other giant robots until they exploded. 
But for me, it was the traversal 
techniques that stood out the most. 
Jumping at a wall sent you sprinting 
along it, and you could chain together 
wall-runs to cross huge distances in 
seconds, all while firing an assault 
rifle at grunts and enemy players. 
Double-jumps made sense thanks 
to the rocket packs that the player-
controlled pilots had on their backs, 
giving you huge potential to clamber 
onto the back of the aforementioned 
Titans and fire your gun into the 
electronics inside. And as anyone 
who has watched a sci-fi film knows, 
shooting cables and lights always 
makes something explode. 
Things only got better for the 
sequel—Respawn took the 
best bits of their previous 
engine and expanded 
on it. This time you can 
choose to equip your 
pilot with a grappling 
hook, which will help 
you reach rooftops, or 
fling you hundreds of 
meters across the map 
if you use it like a slingshot. 
You can use your rocket boosters to 
hold your pilot temporarily in the air 
when aiming down the sights of your 
weapon, allowing you to double-jump 
way into the air, then line up a sniper 
shot from across the map while you 
hover over everyone like a peregrine 
falcon wielding a high-powered rifle. 
You can do a cheeky ass-slide after 
you leap from a wall to maintain your 
momentum, then deliver an uppercut 
fly right up to the roof of the nearby 
building. The map design gives you 
clues about surfaces designed to run 
across—if you want, you can cross 
almost every level without touching 
the ground once. 
After a few matches, you’ll start 
to have moments where you feel like 
a gaming god. Shooting while you 
wall-run? Easy. Grappling an opponent, 
pulling them towards you, then kicking 
them in the head? Simple. Phasing 
into an alternate dimension, then 
reappearing inside another player and 
making them explode into red goo? 
Not easy, but very satisfying. There 
are plenty of ways to take out other 
players, and all of them are very cool. 
You’ll be hitting the Home button to 
record a gameclip a lot.
And I mustn’t forget the game’s 
single-player mode. It not only acts 
as an introduction for players new 
to Titanfall that want to learn the 
skills, but it also champions tight 
level design and exceptional 
pacing. It’s one of the most 
considered, well-designed campaigns 
of any Xbox One game, and will 
regularly plaster a smile across your 
face. You can pick up Titanfall 2  
for less than $25 today (enhanced 
for Xbox One X, no less), and  
it’s well worth it— 
few games make 
you feel 
cooler. Q
GUN READY
If you’re lucky, in the 
campaign mission Effect 
And Cause, an alternate 
animation will play when 
you activate your phase 
shifter. A-OK!

probably reach 
it and shoot 
from it, but 
moving quickly 
is key.

positions aren’t 
useful for long.

someone will

MOSCOW 
METRO 2033 
Humanity is forced 
underground after nukes 
fall on Russia, and entire 
communities are forged 
in the tunnels below, 
surviving mostly on a 
diet of tasty mushrooms. 
Meanwhile, Earth’s 
wildlife has become 
wickedly mutated, 
and creatures like 
werewolves will do 
their best to end your 
life when traveling 
between different parts 
of Moscow. Bullets are 
so rare that they’re 
practically currency. 
In 2033’s sequel, Last 
Light, we even meet 
children who have never 
seen the world as it 
once was, before it was 
totally destroyed. Metro’s 
setting is basically the 
opposite of spending two 
weeks in Bora Bora.

DUNWALL DISHONORED
Take your pick with Dunwall’s problems: An excessive 
number of rats all over the place, the fact that whales 
are tortured just to power all the world’s machinery, 
and armed guards seemingly stationed everywhere. 
Aside from the occasional bar or fancy party, there’s 
basically nowhere nice to go, and even in those 
places you’re likely to get betrayed by your allies or 
incapacitated and sold to a pervert respectively. Oh, 
and the queen, who was keeping order in the midst 
of this, has been murdered. Apart from some well-
decorated interiors, this is something of a nightmare 
world, unless you particularly enjoy the company of 
vermin—and don’t mind them trying to eat your legs 
when there are too many of them around.
 08
THE CITY MIRROR’S EDGE 
What if a dystopia was so boring that it made your mouth feel dry? This bold 
question is asked by Mirror’s Edge, which features cutscenes so dull you’d 
be forgiven for thinking that none of the oppressed people in this world even 
deserve the power to express themselves, so wasted would that be on Faith 
and her deeply tedious free-running friends. On the plus side, The City’s clean 
and memorable red-and-white color palette demonstrates that even horrible 
dictatorships can have a bit of taste. An uprising might only spoil the view, so it’s 
probably best to call the whole thing off and just put up with the oppression.

CAR FOOTBALL  
NIGHTMARE WORLD 
ROCKET LEAGUE
In a futuristic world where regular sports no longer 
exist, probably, football must only be played in cars, 
and the ball must be gigantic and explode on impact 
with the net every single time. Meanwhile, the main 
soundtrack to all of this nonsense is a suite of 
terrible dance music tracks that bury deep into your 
brain and refuse to vacate. Who knows what other 
sports alternatives exist in Rocket League’s dark 
vision of the future: Rocket cricket? Rocket polo, in 
which actual cars ride living, put upon horses around 
a big grassy field? Truly, the grimmest of all timelines.

NEW YORK THE DIVISION
The Division’s backdrop is one where shopping mega day Black Friday went 
horribly wrong. Instead of dads wrestling for half-price TVs or aunts punching 
children in the face to get 15% off a wok, a virus spreads via money as it changes 
hands. As part of a special forces unit, you’re sent into Manhattan to check out 
what’s gone wrong and sort it, which apparently involves battling for the best 
armored kneepads possible in a city filled with armed perps in fetching winter 
wear. This is not the snowy Manhattan we know from Home Alone 2, then, but it 
might bring the AirBnB prices down a bit if you’re planning a weekend away there.

WELLINGTON WELLS  
WE HAPPY FEW
In this British dystopia that recalls classic movies 
Brazil and A Clockwork Orange, people are forced to 
take drugs called ‘Joy’ that make them see the world 
as a brighter place. Those who don’t take their pills 
are called wastrels, and see the world as it really 
is, which is one of monologuing crazy people with 
cartoonish British accents—truly, what could be 
worse? That said, like most of the dystopias on this 
list, Wellington Wells looks fantastic, especially when 
you’re high on Joy, with its use of familiar imagery like 
British ‘bobby’ uniforms, bar signs, and phone booths. 
It’s like someone built a British dystopia based 
entirely on ‘70s TV shows.

RAPTURE BIOSHOCK
“I chose... Rapture!” beams Andrew Ryan, creator of 
BioShock’s underwater nightmare world, that was 
supposed to be a haven for artists and thinkers to 
thrive without sensible people telling them what 
to do. Look where it got him: Beaten to death with 
a golf club, by his own son (kind of), while his city 
collapsed into civil war. Devastating, really. That said, 
Ryan had fantastic taste in decor, with a lovely green 
hue lighting up every area of Rapture, and excellent 
art direction on the city’s signage and propaganda. 
Rapture would be a lovely place to live, assuming you 
could cart out all the splicers, Little Sisters, and Big 
Daddies first so it was slightly less terrifying. 
 04
CITY 17 HALF-LIFE 2
This Eastern European city is under the control of the Combine, who love marching 
into people’s houses with guns, and broadcasting propaganda on big television 
screens. Venture out of the surveillance state-y city center, though, and City 17 
looks like it could use a good wash down with chemical cleaning fluid. Barnacles—
Half-Life’s enemy type which grabs onto you with its tongue, pull you towards 
it, then bites you until death—are all over the place. If you haven’t got a crowbar 
handy, the whole thing is rather scary, and you’re better off just staying put in the 
city and trying not to get whacked on the head by an angry Combine guard.

SUPERMAN IS A DICK 
INJUSTICE: GODS 
AMONG US
In the first Injustice, Superman was 
somehow deceived into killing Lois Lane 
by the Joker. Naturally, he was somewhat 
upset about that, and created a regime 
that all had to obey. Batman, who always 
has a solution to everything, decided to 
dip into an alternate reality and call for 
help from that universe’s superheroes, 
which is exactly the sort of science fiction 
nonsense you can pull off when you’re 
a billionaire with too much time on your 
hands. Batman won, of course, but in 
Injustice 2, he let Superman go in order to 
help stop an invasion from Braniac—which 
once again puts the world under threat 
from his regime. Why can’t these guys just 
sit and talk it out over a macchiato and a 
bucket of chicken?

NAZI AMERICA  
WOLFENSTEIN 
2: THE NEW 
COLOSSUS 
There’s no doubting that this is scariest dystopia 
on Xbox, simply because it’s the easiest to imagine: 
What if the Nazis won, and took over the country? 
Would it look exactly like Wolfenstein 2? Well, the 
answer to that is a non-committal ‘maybe’. Whether 
Hitler had plans to unleash robot dogs that breathe 
fire or build a personal headquarters on the planet 
Venus is a matter that’s up for historical debate 
(alternatively, ask your dad and see what he says), 
but this does make you wonder what that world 
would really be like, at least for 30 entire seconds. 
By that point, you’ve already lopped off some 
bastard’s leg with a hatchet, and vowed to sort 
the Nazi problem out yourself with triple-barreled 
shotguns and ludicrous one-liners. If you’re going 
to liberate an entire nation, at least do it with some 
good-looking ultraviolence.

seen huge success, but if you execute it brilliantly 
on such a compelling premise, people will want  
to play it. As Kevin Costner said, if you build it  
(and make it an awesome immersive experience), 
they will come… A series that’s always held a 
special place in my heart has been  Deus Ex  [3], 
with the first game being an incredible adventure 
that really felt like it gave you the choice to play 
how you want. With that in mind,  Deus Ex: Human  
 Revolution  [4] was a genuinely brilliant reinvention, 
bringing what was great about the original to a 
new audience and bringing it up to speed for 
modern tastes. It’s quite an achievement to do this, 
pleasing die-hard and new fans alike. I even quite 
liked the boss battles… Finally,  Rocket League  [5]. 
It’s one of those seemingly simple, but utterly 
brilliant ideas—like PUBG, or even Minecraft—
which you’re really annoyed you didn’t come up 
with yourself. An absolutely brilliant, replayable, 
watchable, accessible, and hilarious game.
