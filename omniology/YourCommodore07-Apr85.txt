FIRST
AID
for your 64
Computers, like people, are fallible. They need the right
combination of code and care to perform effectively in the
business or the home. And that requires ﬁrst hand knowledge
from you to create a healthy operating environment for your
Commodore 64.
Knowledge about machine language, about the lesser known
qualities of the 64, about the disc drives, graphics, and about the
tricks and tips to keep your 64 on line. That's why First Publishing
has now launched in the UK a series of high quality books and
software packages to provide a complete health care kit for your
64. Commodore 64 users throughout Europe have already found it
a tonic. We think you will, too.

FIRST THE GOOD NEWS. IF YOU OWN A
64, software for your machine is not likely
to dry up for some years yet. How do I
know? Just l o o k  a t  t h e  recen t
Commodore launches in the Stales (see
this month's data statements).
The new C128 is compatible with the
64 and can ruin all its software. This alone
should be enough to make the C128 a very
popular machine -a brand new computer
with vast amounts of available software
plus an extra 64K. This in turn will extend
the life of the 64.
Of course, compatability i s  a
fashionable catchword at the moment.
MSX computers have very little else other
than compatability to recommend them -
and even that's not been 100% proved.
They certainly don't offer the latest in up-
to-the minute technology. They're chips
off a very old block - the Z80.
On the other hand, the C128 is a new
and powerful machine (BASIC with over
140 commands, 80 columns, twice the
memory) which, nevertheless does not
deny its roots. Commodore realises that it
is software which holds the key to success.
for a new machine: a computer which can
tap the wealth available for the 64 is
already half-way there.
There is a belief, widely held, that as
soon a s a  computer i s  n o  longer
manufactured, everyone loses interest in
it. That's just not true. We know that at
Your Commodore from the number of
letters we receive from Vic owners asking
for more programs, more articles, more
anything. But you'll have noticed that
software houses are n o  longer as
productive as they once were. You must
let them know that you don't want to be
forgotten. Only when you stop badgering
us will we stop writing about the Vic and
that's a long way off yet.
Plus/4 price slashed
The even better news, if you are planning
to buy a Plus/4, is that Commodore have
announced a 50% price reduction on this
machine. Commenting on this dramatic
decision, Howard Stanworth, boss o f
Commodore UK, said: "At £150, we're
offering the public a really powerful and
versatile computer at a price which, until
now, has only applied t o  machines
designed for ﬁrst time buyers. We think,
at this price, the Plus/4 is head and
shoulders above its rivals". He reckons
that the Plus/4's in-built software and
advanced speciﬁcation put it in the same
bracket as competitive machines costing
about £400.
Why this sudden change in pricing
policy? "We have always been able to
assess and react t o  rapidly changing
situations and the dramatic events of this
week are opening up a gap which we are
moving fast to ﬁll". What dramatic events
could those be? As the saying goes (with,
of course, allowance f o r a  little
journalistic licence...) 'From little Acorn
(ﬁnancial difﬁculties) grow mighty.. .price
reductions'!
So, what's the bad news? Well, I'm just
not convinced that the C16 and the Plus/4
will ever be adequately supported by
commercial software. Now I know that's
not everything. They are both good
machines and if you bought the Plus/4,
for example, for the built-in packages
then you won't be disappointed. On the
other hand if you got a C16 at Christmas
because you hoped it would soon rival the
Spectrum and the 64 in games, then
prepare to ﬁnd other ways of using your
machine to the full. There will be software
- after all, software houses can't ignore
the170,000 C16 owners - but most of it will
be conversions of the popular games from
other machines.
The road ahead
The tide is turning towards more powerful
machines and Commodore are inevitably,
though n o t  unwillingly, being swept
away. The two American machines are
examples but there is also the Com-
modore Amiga which is to be launched
this year.
Commodore haven't got their strategy
worked out yet. It's fairly easy for a
company like Atari which i s  ' re-
launching' t o  release all their new
machines at once, but Commodore have
to ﬁt new models into an existing range.
It all promises to be an interesting
year.

New PC marks Commodore's
return to the business market
COMMODORE'S 16-BIT IBM-COMPAT-
ible PC was ﬁrst shown to a waiting world
of dealers, distributors, businessmen and
press at the Which Computer Show in
January. The new PC isn't actually due for
release until late Spring.
No pricing details on the machine
have yet been released but Commodore
promise that t he PC is  totally I BM
compatible - every test carried out so tar
has been successful.
David Gerrard, Commodore's U K
Marketing manager, believ es  t h a t
Commodore's n e w  assault o n  t h e
business market is  dependent upon
building a strong distribution network.
Although they don't plan to discard their
existing dealers, he says: "We're looking
for both new dealers and distributors to
expand o u r  range o f  outlets into a
distribution network which is second to
none." He hopes to see Commodore hit
the business market with a vengeance
with the new PC and says "This machine
marks the beginning o f  a  carefully-
planned programme for  Commodore
Business Systems, which will take us into
the late '80s".
Commodore's American cousins have
been far more proliﬁc as shown by the
output at the Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas in January.
The n e w  Amer ic an P C  i s  t h e
Commodore 128 which, as the name
suggests, contains 128K of memory. With
an external R A M  Disc O ption, t h e
memory can be expanded to 512K. The
user has a choice o f  three operating
modes - 128,64 and CP/M. The 128 mode
features BASIC 7.0 which includes over
140 commands, statements and functions.
The full 80 column display, along with the
extra memory, makes the C128 a credible
business machine.
Commodore also announced the LCD
portable personal computer. It has 32K of
RAM and %K of ROM and offers eight
built-in programs  s uc h a s  w o r d -
processing, spreadsheet, address book
and calculator. Its major features include
a b u i l t
accompanying communications software
and an 80 column, 16 line, LCD (Liquid
Crystal Display) screen.
Also on display was a range of new
Commodore peripherals. The 1571 Disc
Drive -  a 5
where up to 350K of information can be
stored on a single disc - includes a built-in
microprocessor, 2K RAM, 32K ROM and
transfer rates ranging from 300 cps to
41,360 cps. Other additions were the
Commodore 1902 RGBI/Composite
Colour Monitor, the MP5 802 Printer and
the Commodore Mouse.
But, don't raise your hopes too high.
There are no signs, yet, of these CES
exhibits crossing the Atlantic to set foot in
your local micro stores.

Commodore hope to be top of the class
with their  "Computers f o r  Schools"
sponsorship scheme to enable schools to
purchase s elec ted c omputers  a n d
peripherals at 30% discount.
Although the sponsorship scheme was
initially designed to help schools entering
the 1985 Commodore/BCS Computer
Quiz to buy their own computers, the
scheme is now being offered to all UK
schools to help them beat the education
cuts. Every £7.00 a school raises through
sponsorship, Commodore will match with
£3.00. F or  example, t o  purchase a
Commodore 64, a school would have to
raise 0 3 9 . 0 0  ex c luding V A T  a n d
Commodore would pay the difference on
the recommended retail price of E229.00.
The scheme is valid for the Commodore

for receipt o f  completed sponsorship
forms is 30 April 1985.

venture buffs, we now
hope to satisfy arcade fans
with this new series from the
man with his ﬁnger on the
button, Phil South.
I TRUDGED PAST THE ARCADE THIS
afternoon because I was skint. They've
just got that new game in, tool It's called
I, Robot, and it uses ultra-hi-res 3D
supercomputer graphics, none of that
stupid laser disc caper 
I
 felt really
depressed, so I dashed home to work off a
bit of my frustration on some of my
favourite games. Imagine my surprise
when I was greeted by a parcel of new
games for my scrutiny; yeehoo!!! I can't
help it, you know. I'm an incurable
fanatic. (It all started with electronic ping-
pong, and it's been downhill ever since.)
Having sat down at the keyboard and
powered up my '64, I loaded up the ﬁrst
out of the bag. Space Shuttle (Activision)
is a sort of ﬂight simulator for space-race
junkies. You take off from Cape Canaveral
on a sunny afternoon, and blast off (with
suitable rumblings and vibrations) into
outer space; your mission (should you
decide to accept it) is to 'rendezvous' with
a renegade satellite and bring it back to
the good old USA. !thought this game was
great, although a triﬂe easy once you get
the hang of it; I played it repeatedly until I
got bored. The shuttle movements are
quite limited and, unlike most ordinary
ﬂight simulators, you can't crash the
shuttle back through the atmosphere
until you've got the satellite. The graphics
are a bit chunky, and the sound is never
more than just appropriate, but it's great
fun.
Star item
By far the best of the crop this month is.
predictably, t ha t  mega-media
experience, Ghostbusters (Activision). It's
a fact of life these days, if you make a pop
song, you gotta make a video; if you make
a movie, you gotta make a videogame! I
can't leave this thing alone, and it's
driving me nuts. I wake up in the middle
of the night saying "aha, if I buy the
compact car and capture as many slimers
as I can then I'll get to the end screen". It's
crazy, but I love it. The plot follows the
movie exactly, right down to screaming
—
"Ghostbusters!" a t the appropriate
moments in the soundtrack. The music,
sound effects, graphics and general 'fun-
to-be-had' puts this game head and
shoulders above the rest. Put-downs of
commericalism aside, this is a ﬁrst rate
game and as such gets my 'hot game of the
month' award. Get it or regret it!
If you do well in Ghostbusters, you are
assigned a bank account number, and this
allows you to begin at some other time
with a larger amount of money. As my
special gift to you, no charge, I can supply
you with my own account number for
$UMO!!! First, when it asks you for your
name, type SOUTH then (RETURN), then
my account number 40012500. The
account number is generated from the
name and the ﬁgure, so you must type the
same name as I did. (For the hedonists
among you, there is an account number
which allows you over $67,000. For name
type in (RETURN), and the number is
66455701 (Special thanks to my mate Neil
Davey for that one,)
Other gems
The itinerant Cuthbert in the Tombs of
Doom (Microdeal) is next up, and very
jolly it is too. I never took to old Cuthbert,
I rather thought him a bit of a wally, but I
must say I do like his new game. Perhaps a
touch too much like Quicksilva's Fred:
you know, tramping around 2(0 or so
tombs in the footsteps of Indiana Jones.
picking up treasure and getting murdered
by spooks, bats, devils, sworded spheres,
vicious psycho-saxaphones, etc., but a
nice little arcade adventure when all said
and done. Nothing stunningly different
about thellook and sound of this one, but
it does keep me playing, which must, I
suppose, say something for its addictive
qualities.
Summer Games (Epyx/Quicksilva) is
fantastic. It's one of those Olympic or
decathlon-type thingies, and as such
should be  unremarkable. BUT, the
graphics are superb, the sound is pure
realism and the games are fun and
challenging. It's a hit, and as long as my
joystick holds out I will be skeet shooting,
pole vaulting, swimming, diving, running,
and doing Nadia Komanechi impressions!
In the bin
There had to be some duff ones, and here
they are. Roulette (No Man's Land) is a
real throwback to the all-text games of the
infancy of computer gaming. I've got a
very low boredom threshold, and this
turkey deﬁnitely overstepped it! Magic
Micro Mission (Quicksilva) is supposed to
be for kids, but most of the kids I know
wouldn't give this one a second glance,
TV program tie-in or not. Seeing Orpheus
in the Underworld (Sterling Software) just
goes to prove I know a rip-off of Pitfall
when I see one, and all games with music
in them should have the facility to toggle
it on and off!
Letters department
I have a note here from Chris Charry of Co
Antrim, asking me to list the best versions
of virtually every type of  game in
existence! What I do have space to say is
Flight Simulator II (Sierra), Android 2
(Vortex), Boulderdash (First Star),
Catacombs (Anirog). Midway (PSS), and
literally any text graphic adventure by
Melbourne House. I phoned Ultimate on
your behalf, and they say that they "have
no plans for converting any games at the
moment", which is a bit strange, as I didn't
even tell them which ones I was talking
about. Still, that's their problem. As for
the Ant Attack query, how the dickens did
you manage to burn your instructions
before you played the game? Nice
graphics, shame about the game.
That's all South, get off!
OK, that's enough blabber from me. Turn
to this column again next month for more
up-to-date comment and answers to your
nagging queries; Flippo has the
technology!

You don't have to link up to
Compunet to discover that
Modem magic. Dave Crisp
and Henry Budgett discover
worthy alternatives in the
Protek and Prism moems.
The ﬁrst thing I did was to get the tape-
based software onto disc because, as all
the regular readers know, I have an SX64
and so can't use a tape. Loading the tape is
slow so, if you do have a drive, it would be
worth doing anyway.
The interface p ack (available
eparately) contains the software and also
a lead to connect the user port and the
RS232 socket on the modem.
If you are logging onto Prestel, you
enter your 10 digit ID which is stored. You
are then prompted to dial Prestel. It is
worth noting that, if you have had your
Prestel number for a while and your call
was not a local one, things are rapidly
changing and Prestel now claims that 92%
of people can connect with a local call so
check up as you may be spending more
than you need.
An earpiece plugs into the modem so
you can hear when the Prestel computer
answers. A touch of the 1.3 key and your 10
digit I D  i s  sent t o  t h e computer.
Procedure from then on is like standard
Prestel.
In and out
It is possible to return to the main menu
while still logged on. This is achieved by
pressing the Fl key. From the main Protek
menu you are able to:
1. Sa ve  Frame
You can return to the menu and save the
current frame on tape or disc. This is
particularly useful for things such as
messages and timetables. It is not possible
to overwrite an existing frame with
one of the same name, thus preventing
mistakes.
2. View  Saved Frame
You can view any saved frame without
logging off, as long as you know the
frame's name. If you don't, there is no way
of getting a directory of the disc without
newing the program. This is inconvenient
to say the least. Loading a saved frame is
fast compared to many communications
packages so, if you are looking at a frame
while logged on, you are not burning
pounds.
IT'S FOR
YOU HOO
3. View  Current Frame
The last frame displayed while logged on
is held in RAM even after you have
disconnected and so, if you are looking at
a speciﬁc page, you can disconnect and
study it at leisure with no connection cost.
Of course, if you log off properly via page
90 of Prestel that is the retained frame and
the log-off frame is about as exciting as
watching the bath empty!
4. Ch a n g e  ID
You can change ID without unplugging
and starting again. This is useful as you
only know if you have input the correct ID
when you try to log on. This gives you the
opportunity to change it.
5. Us er  to user
This allows you t o  connect up with
another Protek user in order to transmit
I

software to each other but I will deal with
that separately.
Corruption
Because this is an acoustic modem you are
prone t o  suffer fr om the occasional
corrupt screen. This appears as squiggles
and dots in place of letters, The best way
of doing this is to get people to call your
name or smash cups of coffee onto the
table. To avoid it, I have made a very
simple acoustic box. This consists of a shoe
box covered in foam which I put over the
modem after placing the modem o n
another piece of foam. Crude but very
effective.
You can also get garbage on the screen
from the various buzzes, clicks and bangs
that Telecom seem t o  introduce
themselves, If you ﬁnd you are getting a
lot of corruption listen through the
earpiece and, if you seem to have a
particularly noisy line, it may be worth
disconnecting and trying again.
I have tried a couple of other acoustic
modems in the past and this one does
seem less prone to external noise. The
rubber cups that the phone ﬁt into are
nice and tight and keep out all but the
loudest bang.
So far so good
The modem requires four pencil batteries
which seem to last well despite being left
on overnight on many occasions. It is also
portable. Providing that the place you use
it has a standard telephone handset (not
the trimphone type) you can plug in
anywhere (even a phone box).
It must be said that the modem itself is
uncluttered by  switches. There is the
RS232 socket, an earpiece socket and one
switch all at one end. The switch is a three
position switch which is either (a) off, on,
and in 1200/1200 mode or (b) on, and in
1200/75 mode. A small red LED indicates
whether or not the batteries are up to
scratch. The 1200/75 switch is used for
Prestel and a few other boards and the
1200/1200 is mainly used for user to user.
Some of you may have noticed that
there is  n o  300 option. 300 baud is
favoured b y  many o f  the advertised
bulletin boards. A few do work on 1200/75
but they are in the minority. Due to this I
feel that this is best considered as a cheap
Prestel link.
Bugs
I have grown fond of this modem. Most of
E
too many problems. It does, however,
18 h a v e  the annoying habit of suddenly cut-
ting you off. Why it does I do not know and
will endeavour to ﬁnd out. Usually it
happens when I have typed out a message
for a person and try to refresh the screen
display with *0 0 #  There is a sudden
click, the screen clears, and the line goes
dead. There is no alternative but to re-run
and phone again. Annoying.
Talking of leaving messages, the most
irritating bug is the one that leaves you
wondering what you have said. Let me
expand. If you are leaving a Mailbox for
another Prestel user you type in what you
want to say and the on-screen display
should show what you have typed. Not so.
The cursor leaves behind it a trail of white
squares. This means that you often end up
with spelling mistakes and word ends,
split between t w o  lines. I  feel that
whenever I leave a message for someone I
must tell them about the bug or they think
I am illiterate!
Protek user to user
The software for  user t o  user com-
munication is separate from the main
software and loaded fr om t he main
program. There are two modes transmit
and receive. You are then prompted to
say whether you will transmit (receive)
BASIC or code. After putting in the start
address and the number of bytes to be
transmitted you are prompted to transmit.
If the header becomes corrupt or the ﬁle
becomes corrupt you are informed at the
end and prompted to transmit again. It is
not a bad piece of kit and works well. The
unit is let down by its software but that
should be remedied in the future.
Apparently this  is  due t o  Prestel
echoing the,character you have typed and
confuses the 64 and results in a white
square o r  s ome s uc h blur b. T his
information came from Protek and they
say they are working on it.
Apart from that there is little trouble
with the modem. Its facilities are basic to
say the least but I am sure that, because
most of the problems are software based,
they could be rectiﬁed. If you come up
with any modiﬁcations or improvements
to the software why not let us know at
Your Commodore.
Maybe it would be possible to prepare
messages while logged off and then put it
onto Prestel as a complete page already
typed and checked. That way it would not
matter if it did look like nothing on earth
as you would already have been able to
edit it.
Checking with Protek they are at least
aware of the problems and acknowledge
the bugs. If these things are sorted out I
should think they will have a very popular
product.
Technical speciﬁcation
The input socket in the modem is
standard RS232. The pins are as follows:
PIN 1. GROUND
PIN 2. SERIAL IN
PIN 3. SERIAL OUT
PIN 4. 5 V
PIN 5. ANSWER/ORIGINATE (non
standard use).
By the way if you are a Commodore
user why not mailbox me. My systel
number is 106434851.

Protek 1200 modem
159 (plus t10 for an interface)
Protek Computing Ltd.
la Young Square
Bruceﬁeld Industrial Park
Livingstone SH54 9BX.
Prism
Although C o m m o d o r e  a n d  t h e
Press are making a lot of fuss, and in many
cases rightfully so, about the Compunet
data base system many users might want
to get at other systems lik e Prestel,
Micronet or even a little user to user
communication. Prism, who have long
been involved in bringing modems to the
masses, have put together a rather neat
little package based o n  their  direct
connect Modem 1000 together with a
plug-in cartridge f r o m  O EL whic h
effectively turns the Commodore 64 into a
Viewdata terminal.
Because the modem is a separate unit
designed to work with other computers as
well as the Commodore 64 the overall
appearance of the package isn't terribly
neat although t h e  component parts
themselves are by no means ugly. The
modem is a small (165mm by 50mm by
235mm) black box with three indicator
LEDs and two switches at the front and the
power and 'phone leads to the rear with a
couple of sockets for the serial interface
and telephone handset. The front panel
indicators provide an indication of power
to the unit, carrier detected and whether
the unit is on-line. The on-line switch is
fairly confusing -  should it go down to
connect or up...experimentation reveals
the answer but better instructions in the
manual would help. The only  other
control selects the mode of operation;
Viewdata (1200/75) or 1200bps in either
Receive or Transmit.
Internally t h e  modem is  rather a
disappointment. Constructed on an SRBP
PCB board rather than a ﬁbreglass one,
cost-cutting in the extreme, the circuitry
is not based on the World Chip modem
system but on the Viewdata modem chip
which explains why there's no 300bps
option. The layout is also very generous;
the unit could have been some 30%
smaller with ease. The construction is
solid enough with only the PCB-mounted
sockets likely to cause trouble in the long
term.
Communications pack
The communications pack, a neat 150mm
by 45mm by  115mm, plugs into the
Commodore's cartridge slot. Interestingly
the internal construction of this unit is
much higher than that of the modern yet
they are both made by the same company.
The m o d e m  c o n n e c t s  t o  t h e
communications pack through a special
cable from the serial port. Your telephone
must be unplugged from the wall. If you
don't have the new style plugs you'll have
to get one ﬁtted, and the modem cable
plugged in its place while the phone now
connects to the back of the modem. This
is the only modem I've used which won't
allow t h e  us e o f  a  'two-into-one'
connector, although there is a certain
logic in their method since it means you
don't need to have an extension socket.
You must now try to disentangle the
wires to the rest of the system and actually
get t o  the keyboard in  order to get
connected. The OEL Communications
Pack makes this really easy although the
manuals that come with this and the
modem are really pretty awful. A ﬁrst time
user could get pretty confused by some of
the contents and a re-write wouldn't go
amiss. Nevertheless, once the system is
connected and turned on the whole thing
is menu-driven and very easy to operate.
Running the system
Getting the system up and running is
pretty easy, given that you have a Prestel
account number and password handy.
Unlike Commodore's system there is no
'ﬁngerprint' built into the system and so
any valid password can be used, Hackers
please note that Prestel's security has
been tightened considerably in recent
months! (That's what h e  thinks; see
Data statements - ed.) The legitimate user
will ﬁnd little trouble in registering the
system for use as Prism seem to provide all
the necessary forms as a matter of course
although in our case they let us borrow
their account number -  trusting, aren't
they?
Apart from being able to access any of
the usual Micronet and Prestel pages the
OEL software can cater for downloading
software and storing it onto tape or disc.
Ordinary pages can also be saved in this
way but with the speed problems of both
Commodore's tape and disc systems there
cannot be much advantage unless you
want to view something again and again.
If you've got a  printer attached the
software will also allow you to dump
pages onto paper. Sadly, I wasn't able to
test this feature because my printer isn't
Commodore graphics compatible. But,
given that it supports Prestel-type block
graphics i t  could b e  very useful for
dumping messages and the like. With
messages, the software allows you t o
prepare and edit plain text in an off-line
mode which helps save on connection
time.
Prism user to user
One feature n o t  supported b y  t h e
Compunet system -  at least not in the
usual s e n s e  -  i s  u s e r - t o - u s e r
communication. Compunet users can
place information in the 'Jungle' or send
messages in much the same way as the
Prestel user but owners of the Prism/OH,
system c a n  in d u lg e  i n  r eal- time
c ommunic ations . Ad m it t e d ly  t h e
connection can only be made in one
direction at a time so you do have to
change t h e  modem fr om 'send' t o
'receive' but that seems a small price to
pay for the speed and convenience of the
facility.
As far  as  I  c ould tell fr om t he
documentation there is an error checking
facility provided which works on a block
by block basis to check that what was sent
really got there. Christensen protocol is so
widely supported b y  communications
packages and bulletin boards that i t
would have provided a bonus had this
been offered as well. But, at least OEL
provided s ome f o r m  o f  checking.
Whether the protocol they use is in any
way Christensen compatible I cannot say.
In conclusion
The Prism Modem 1000, in itself, isn't
terribly special. Had it offered a 300bps
full duplex speed as well it could have
been used for bulletin board access and
real user to user communication. Given
that i t  doesn't possess this option, it
performed very well indeed. Possibly the
only item that could do with being tidied
up is the labelling of the on-line switch as
neither the operating manual or the front
panel labelling make clear which way is
'on-line'.
The software package, on the other
hand, is very user friendly and requires
little real effort to understand. Sadly this
too is let down by the documentation but
the screen directions are usually clear
enough t o  get around most o f  the
potential problems.
Overall, i f  y ou are looking for  a
communications system t h a t  offers
Prestel/Micronet access and the chance
of doing some program sharing down the
line the Prism package isn't at all bad. But,
for those determined to have a crack at
Compunet, or who want to hack away at
the real bulletin boards, it is not the best
option by any means.

Mike Hart shows 64 users A I
which reads data statements
to a particular line or data •
statement.
16,
I have written three different types of
Selective Restore each of which restores
the pointer that reads data statements
not to the ﬁrst one but to a particular line
or a particular piece of data. Each is
presented below, together w ith r ef-
erences t o  the program lines in  the
composite program and timings are given
for t h e  technique when 2000 data
statements have to be scanned.
Method 1: Simple (Lines 2000-2070)
In this method you use a very large loop
(i.e. J set to 1,000,000) to locate a data
marker which immediately precedes the
item of data that you wish to access. In this
case, the data marker is the string " * * * "
and the ﬁrst piece of data is the string that
follows, i.e. T h i s  technique is the
longest (nearly 10 seconds) but the easiest
and will sufﬁce when the data items is not
very many. It is very easy to program.
Method 2: BASIC (Lines 3000-3080)
This method requires you to specify your
target line in a variable (which here I have
called IL, i.e. line 2020). LP is used as a line
pointer to step through the program and
should be initialised for Commodore 64/
VICS to 2049 and for PETS to 1025. Again a
very long loop is chosen and the program
'steps through' the line numbers found in
the third and fourth bytes of each line as it
is internally stored in order to ﬁnd the line
required from which to read data. When
found, appropriate values are POKEd into
the zero page pointers which keep track
of data statements. The timing is about
half that of Method 1 (about 5 secs).
NB: For PETS, substitute 63 for 66 and 62
for 65 in line 3050
Method 3: Machine Code (Lines 4000-
4440)
This 'machine code' version is stripped
down to make it as compact as possible. It
is located in the cassette buffer although it
can g o  int o any  area o f  protected
memory. To make the routine as compact
as possible no provision has been made
for the UNDEFINED STATEMENT ERROR
if the sought line does not exist - instead
one may get an OUT OF DATE ERROR.
Notice that the syntax is either:
SYS(Location) targetline OR SYS Location
(targetline)

READY.
The version as it stands is the coding for
the Commodore 64. Lines 4100-4210 indi-
cate the three changes that have to be
made for the routine to work on a VIC.
Lines 4200-4210 give the version for PETS
(BASIC 2) and lines 4400-4410 give the
version for PETS (BASIC 4). Naturally, as
one would expect, this version is the
fastest of all at a mere 0.02 seconds to
search through 2000 data statements.
Preferences
I prefer the ﬁrst version as the number of
programs with 2000 data items in them is
limited and even this case takes less than
10 seconds. But if you like speed at all
costs then the machine code is obviously
unbeatable.

In the ﬁnal part of this series,'
David Rees has compiled an
example game from the
routines used in previougill
instatimpts.
TO CONCLUDE THIS SERIES, I  HAVE
chosen As teroids , t h e  o l d  arc ade
favourite, as my example. The game is a
fast version of the original and includes
full instructions and a high score feature.
It incorporates all the routines used in
previous series apart from the scroll
routine.
There ar e n o  embellishing stars
behind the asteroids (seethe beginning of
part 2) because border characters are used
to stop your laser bolt: extra stars would
detonate y our bolt prematurely. The
score routine is the same as that used in
part 3. The special effects used in the text
pages illustrate good use of Extended
Colour Mode, where only the ﬁrst 64
characters of the set are available.
However, each screen position can
have o n e  o f  4  chosen background
colours. This lets y ou highlight tex t
features and, as you may see from the
display, adds interest to an otherwise
static screen.
Happy zapping - you have a score of
2870 to beat!

karry Marshall assesses Raeto
West's book on 'Programming
the VIC' and Allen and
Stirgaret Webb look at a
selection of other
Commodore books.
Title: 'Programming the VIC'
Author: Raeto West
Publisher: Compute!
Publications
Price: £15.90
IF EVER THERE WAS A BOOK THAT TRIED
to be all things to all VIC users, this is it. It
deals with the architecture of the VIC.
BASIC programming and machine code
programming. Then it takes the reader
beyond VIC-BASIC, shows how BASIC
and machine code can be mixed and
delves into the machine code routines
that are contained in the VIC's ROM.
After this it examines the creation of
sound and graphics before describing the
peripherals that can be attached.
This brief synopsis should serve to
show that there are very few aspects of
using the VIC that are not dealt with. The
book is aimed at all levels of users from
the beginner to the expert, and there are
parts that are aimed at the absolute
beginner as well as programming tips that
will beneﬁt the most advanced expert.
Given its blanket coverage of VIC
programming and its claim to the widest
possible readership, it must be said ﬁrst of
all that the book is a success. It is hard to
imagine that more information on the VIC
could be covered and packed into a single
book. The book does cater for all VIC
owners. There are a few shortcomings,
but they are really rather minor in light of
the book's overall achievement.
To try to be a little more speciﬁc in
assessing the book, w e can start b y
looking a  little more closely a t  its
contents, and then try to see from this
how the treatment is geared to various
classes of VIC users.
The ﬁrst chapter is aimed at the
absolute beginner, and does little more
than describe what you can see when you
look at a VIC. I got the strong impression
that it was included more from a sense of
duty than anything else. The chapter is
needed to give balance to the book, but I
don't think that the author's heart was in
it: he was much more interested in getting
down to the 'nitty gritty' of looking inside
the VIC and stretching its capabilities than
in introducing it. To support this idea,
consider that this chapter has ﬁve pages,
whereas the one that tucks into advanced
BASIC programming has 74.
Preliminaries over, we are plunged
into a BASIC reference guide. This gives a
comprehensive coverage of the rules of
VIC-BASIC, of all its keywords (each of
which is discussed and illustrated with an
example), and of the error messages that
are given when something goes wrong
with a program. This shows one of the
book's strengths, f o r i t  is an  ideal
reference guide for the VIC user. And this
is not only true for BASIC, for later on we
get an equally good and complete guide
to 6502 machine code and a further one to
he routines in the VIC ROM and their
locations. T h e fairly experienced
programmer who writes programs in
BASIC, in machine code, and in a mixture
of both, and who wants to call on the
routines that the VIC contains to save
unnecessarily rewriting what is already
under his nose need look no further for
the perfect source of reference.
After the, BASIC reference guide
comes a n  introduction t o  BASIC
programming. I was a bit uneasy about
this chapter, feeling that the author was
still straining to get to the parts that really
interested him, It isn't clear to me at
whom the chapter is aimed, as it seems to
fall between w hat beginners an d
experienced programmers would need. It
is too general and unstructured for the
former and rather unnecessary for the
latter. It does at least contain plenty of
example programs illustrating most of the
features of BASIC. And, in a nice touch, as
soon as it gets to a program of any length it
introduces a checking program that will
help the inexperienced user to ensure
that programs are typed correctly.
With chapter 5, and by now we are a
hundred pages in, the book really starts to
FERENcE
hum. This is where the author wanted to
start. We can forgive a small 'faux pas' on
its ﬁrst page ('A bit, or binary digit, is a
single, tiny electronic switch which can be
either on or off') as the result of his
enthusiasm to tell us about the VIC's
chips, memory maps, unexpanded and
expanded conﬁgurations, interfaces and
more. The ﬁrst program in this chapter is
particularly impressive in that it allows us
to 'see' the hardware in action. It puts a
machine code routine in the cassette
buffer which, w hen ru n  with t h e
appropriate parameters, shows what is
going on in such places as the input buffer
and the screen memory. This is really
ingenious, and overcomes the problem
that a  great many people have i n
understanding hardware because they
can't see anything happening.
'Beyond VIC-BASIC' successfully
guides us just there. It explains how BASIC
programs are stored. This opens up an
otherwise incomprehensible area b y
allowing us to write programs that can
manipulate and change other programs.
The importance of  this need not b e
doubted for long when you consider that
the interpreters and compilers that are
essential to all high-level programming
do just this. They change programs by
translating them to machine code and, of
course, the programs cannot be run at all
unless this is done. Among other things,
this chapter also presents a number of
programs for very useful toolkit routines
such as the ones for merging programs
and reconﬁguring the VIC for some
special purpose.
The next few chapters deal with
machine code, and after a  general
introduction t o  6502 machine code,
methods speciﬁc t o  t h e  V I C  are
examined. It is a good idea to tackle
machine code i n  a  w ay that takes
advantage of what the VIC can do, and
some very short programs can produce
quite remarkable results. But I did feel
that the treatment shared some of the
shortcomings o f  t h e introduction t o
BASIC in that it fell between the same two
stools in its approach and that it rather
lacked a sense of direction. There are
plenty of examples again, but I felt that
they seemed more like a collection of
isolated effects rather than seeming to
build towards a coherent whole.
Following this there are 82 pages on
graphics and ten on sound. This is a little
unfair to the sound, which is quite as
attractive a feature as graphics, but on the
other hand the treatment of the graphics
is pretty good. Apart from explaining
about scrolling, panning and animation, it
explains how to do something about that

tIBRAlly
funny-sized screen. If you didn't expect to
ﬁnd out how to do something about the
screen from the chapter on graphics, it is
worth mentioning that the book has a
good index, and that this not only makes it
easy t o  trace any of  the information
contained in the book but also increases
its value as a source of reference.
To try and sum up, I would say that the
book could scarcely be bettered as a
reference guide for the VIC, and as an aid
and source of ideas to the more advanced
programmer, whether using BASIC or
machine code. I wouldn't recommend it
to the beginner, though. For anyone in
between the novice and advanced stages
of VIC programming, this is still probably
as good a buy as any single book that is
available. But, to illustrate that there are
problems with it  for the intermediate
user, consider this example from page 94.
The BASIC lines,
100 FOR JL) TO -1 STEP 0
110
120 J=(A=13)
130 NEXT
have the same effect as REPEAT U N T I L
A=B. This is ingenious, and could provide
a useful idea for anyone. But i think that a
great many people might come back a
week later to a program incorporating this
trick and wonder how on earth it works!
I also feel that it is a shame that the
book didn't appear rather earlier.
Title: Machine Language for the
Absolute Beginner
Author: Danny Davis
Publisher: Melbourne House
Mint i i 1
MACHINE LANGUAGE PRESENTS AN
interesting paradox. On the one hand it is
extremely fast, efﬁcient and compact. On
the other hand, it is a language which can
be difﬁcult to learn, particularly in the
absence of good text books. With every
youngster wanting to be an arcade game
writer, it is hardly surprising that a variety
of books have appeared on the subject of
machine code.
This book, published by Melbourne
House, is an A5 size volume of 194 pages
aimed at the absolute beginner. Much to
his credit, the author has identiﬁed the
problem that to make learning machine
code easier, it is vital to have an easy
method of entering and running simple
routines. To this end, a BASIC utility called
ALPHA is included in the book. With this
program y o u  c an assemble c ode,
disassemble, save and load code from
cassette, and r un routines. A  simple
facility is  also included t o  allow the
observation o f  a  speciﬁed memory
location during the execution of your
machine code.
One disappointing aspect of this book
is that only the ﬁrst 100 or so pages are
directly related t o  teaching machine
code. T h e  r emainder  c ontains  1 4
appendices which cover areas such as the
memory map, 6510 instruction codes,
details of the VIC and SID chips and a
listing of ALPHA. Apart from ALPHA most
of t h i s  s eems  t o  b e  p a d d in g .
The for mat o f  eac h c hapter is
interesting in that a summary of what has
been discussed is given at the end. This
helps the revision of the material studied.
These summaries can be used as quick
checks if you have a need to refer to the
book in the future.
The material covered is  muc h as
expected in this sort of book, and doesn't
offer a n y  surprises. T o  assist t h e
conversion from BASIC to machine code,
many short BASIC routines are given to
illustrate points. A comparable number of
example machine code routines are given
for you to input via ALPHA.
Overall this  is  a  competent book
which presents the material in a tolerably
clear manner with a reasonable number
of useful examples. The inclusion of a
simple assembler is a real bonus which
certainly makes this book worth buying.
Title: The Com m odore 6 4

NEXT T O  A  G O O D  Q U A L I T Y
assembler, the most valuable tool in a
serious programmer's armoury is  a
detailed disassembly of the computer's
ROMs and a full list of the important entry
points. The reason for this is simple. Inside
the ROMs is a huge library of useful
routines which can save a lot of time and
irritation if you know how to use them.
Most PET users will remember Nick
Hampshire's excellent volume "The PET
revealed". Now he and his co-workers
have applied themselves to assisting 64
users. This book is up to the same high
standard as his PET volume.
It should be appreciated that there is
more than one ROM disassembly on the
market. So far, all of them have been bare
listings with no labels and no helpful
comments. Whils t being better than
nothing, such documents are difﬁcult to
use a n d  tedious  t o  examine. M r
Hampshire has anticipated this problem
and produced a highly readable work. In
effect, a source code has been recreated
from the object code.
The listing is  fully  annotated with
labelled variables and loops. As far as
possible, Commodore's own labels have
been used. Each important routine is
described i n  REMs and the entry
conditions described. According to the
forward, the code was ﬁnally tested by
reassembling and comparing to the ROM
contents. This, as a side effect, threw up
the changes given in the new ROMs.
Overall t h i s  m u s t  h a v e  b e e n  a
monumental task requiring great
patience.

This is a highly detailed and useful

Ti tl e: S u p e r c h a r g e  Y o u r
Commodore 64

MOST ARCADE GAMES ADVERTS INSIST
on thrusting dow n o u r  throats that
machine code is fast and efﬁcient and
BASIC i s  s low and inefﬁcient. This
certainly holds true for arcade games but
it's not entirely true. For most applications
BASIC will do perfectly well, although
some slow sections may require a byte or
two o f  machine code. This book  is
intended to supply a library of ready made
routines for such a purpose. All routines
are supplied as a BASIC loader, a ﬂow
sheet and the source code. In keeping
with most works of this type, the areas
tackled are graphics, sprites, sound and
utilities. A s  s uc h t her e a r e  s ome
interesting inc lus ions  a n d  s o m e
remarkable exclusions.
First, l e t ' s  l o o k  a t  s o u n d .
Unfortunately, this is the weakest section
in the book. In fact, all you get are seven
sound effect routines. Whilst this will be
welcome to those of you who want to
have a gun shot or  explosion in your
program, it's no use at all if you want to
play a tune. It wouldn't have been beyond
the wit of man to include some useful
commands such as envelope etc.
The sprite routines proved to be both
interesting a n d  irritating. There ar e
routines for turning on sprites, changing
colours (hi-res only) reversing, inverting
and erasing designs. The author, has for
some obscure reason however, ignored
the obvious aspects of sprite positioning,
multicolour mode, expansion, collisions
and priorities.
The routines for high resolution bit
mapping are similarly weak. You can
really clear the screen, turn it on or off,
and move the bit pattern from place to
place. You cannot, however, set a point,
draw a line or do any drawing of any sort.
Finally, what about the utilities? Again
rather a  poor  bunch. A  RENUMBER
routine is  given, for  example, which
ignores all GOTOs and GOSUBS. This
would b e  useless for  renumbering a
BASIC program of any signiﬁcant size.
Probably the most useful routine is the
Random Number generator.
In simple terms, this is a case of a good
idea poorly implemented. I  can only
assume that the author was constrained
by the size of routine included since there
are no programs of any signiﬁcant power
or sophistication. My  advice to anyone
thinking of buying this book is, forget it,
it's a better idea to buy a teach yourself
machine code book and d o  the job
yourself,
Title: T h e  Commodore 64 for
kids of all ages
Author: Tony Noble
Publisher: Sigma Press
Price: 16.95
WITH SO MANY CHILDREN GETTING
computers for  birthdays, Christmas or
simply as a toy for father, it isn't surprising
that books are being published with the
sole intention of teaching kids to write
programs. T his  b o o k  assumes n o
knowledge of the 64 and teaches the
rudiments of programming in easy steps.
To give you something concrete to do
when you've learned all there is to learn,
there are some games to type in at the end
of the book.
To mak e matters simple f o r  t he
student, the author has adopted a neat
and c lear  approac h t o  dis play ing
instructions. Key presses, for example, are
depicted by large graphical represent-
ations of the keys. Rather than give large
chapters containing indigestible lumps of
information, the information is supplied
in small steps each a page or two in length.
Each step tackles a new aspect and gives
detailed instructions on how to enter an
exercise and, above all tells you what to
expect on the screen.
So what material is covered? Well, the
answer is almost everything. The book
starts by getting the user aquainted with
using t h e  keyboard a n d  progresses
through putting information o n  t h e
screen by using print commands. It then
moves on to colour and the standard
graphics.
The remainder of the book moves into
the realms of programming in BASIC and
does s o  i n  t h e  same gentle s mall
increments. Each aspect of programming
is illustrated clearly with practical
examples. Even the more advanced
aspects of sound, sprites, animation and
randomness are dealt with effectively.
Once you've grasped the rudiments of
BASIC, t h e  des ign o f  programs is
discussed with reference to the programs
given in the book. Finally, there is a variety
of programs covering education (spelling
and arithmetic), adventure type games
and logic.
This is an excellent book which tackles
the tricky area of programming in a clear
and entertaining manner. At over 200
pages it presents a  huge volume of
information and represents excellent
value for money. This book is suitable for
children of junior age, say from 7 years
onwards.

Why press several keyi
when one will do?
Faster programming
the goal of this utility
from Les Allan.
1
THIS UTILITY, WHEN COM-
pleted, gives the user the ability
to enter KEY words with just a
single key w hen used i n
association with the SHIFT key.
For example SHIFT-A prints
ASC, SHIFT-B prints STEP.
SHIFT-C prints CHR$ and so on
which will make typing in of
programs much faster. A
second set of keywords is also
available so  that i t  further
increases the ﬂexibility of the
utility.
The program as listed must
be entered as written and saved
prior t o  running in  case a
typing error causes a system
crash. Error trap routines have
been incorporated so as to
minimise that possibility. When
completed insert a blank tape
into t h e cassette, ru n  t h e
program and when prompted
"HAVE Y O U  SAVED THIS
PROGRAM Y/N" press Y. The
machine code ﬁles SINGLE KEY
ENTRY and SINGLE KEY will
now be saved to tape. Provision
has been made in the boot
program such that this utility
can be saved to tape or disc
without any changes.
Upon subsequent u se
simply type LOAD for tape or
30 LOAD"SINGLE KEY ENTRY",81,
for disc and the saved program
will automatically load and set
up the operating tystem to
accept the new commands.

Filing is not always an
exciting task but it's
Ittery often necessary:"
A.P. and D.J.
Stephenson show you
k w  your computer
-
chaos.
IN THIS PART OF THE SERIES
we shall look at storing and
retrieving information, a role
which comes naturally to any
computer. In other words, we
are concerned w i t h  t h e
techniques employed f o r
building a kind of high-tech
ﬁling cabinet. We don't really
need a  computer t o  store
information. In fact, storing is
the easy part just bung every
bit of paper, considered to be
of the slightest use in  the
future, into a  cupboard o r
dressing table drawer. As the
drawer ﬁlls up, start using
another one and so on.
The trouble starts, some
days or weeks later, when you
want to retrieve a particular bit
of paper urgently. The ensuing
scene can be quite frightening
to the casual observer. Papers
are ﬂung into the air to the
accompaniment o f  verbal
obscenities and other sound
effects. T h e  ﬂo o r so o n
becomes covered with gas bills,
pawn tickets, threatening
letters and similar documents
peculiar t o  t h e  modern
suburban dwelling.
It is no streak of fate that the
document you want normally
turns up near the bottom of the
last draw searched. According
to theoretical physics, t h e
cause lies in a mysterious and
malignant f act o r cal l ed
'entropy' which is associated
with disorder and, what is
worse, is always increasing! It
certainly seems to work when
we store papers in drawers. The
disorder appears to increase at
a rate proportional t o  t he
number of times the drawers
are accessed.
Of course, a much better
way to store information is in
ofﬁce type ﬁler- Each ﬁle cover
has a title which describes the
general oature of its contents
while each piece o f  paper
within the ﬁle is kept in place
by a  short t ag  string f o r
maintaining seq u en t ial
integrity -  the most recent
paper on top. Although this is a
vast improvement o n  t h e
drawer method, the system
tends to degenerate after the
enthusiasm for order wears off.
It is all right in an ofﬁce where
someone i s  e m p l o y e d
exclusively to maintain the ﬁles
in order but in the relaxed
atmosphere o f  t h e home
papers soon get pushed into
the w rong ﬁl e  t h e  t ag
threading is soon abandoned
because it is too ﬁddlyi. After a
few months the system is little
more t han a n  up-market
version of the drawer method.
So, i f  you have bought a
computer, why not use it as a
ﬁling system? You will need to
enter the information at the
keyboard and a certain amount
of dedication and discipline is
still needed to maintain the
T• H • E
F•A•C•T•S
ﬁles in good order. Programs
for handling t h e data can
include operations which
would take far too long to
complete by normal methods.
The data can  b e  sorted,
modiﬁed, deleted o r  r e -
arranged in a variety of ways
and, most important o f  all,
individual items within a ﬁle
can b e  extracted almost
immediately.
Cassette data ﬁles
Although the ﬂoppy disc is
the nat ural medium f o r
storing ﬁle information, it is
safe to assume that the majority
of read ers w h o  o w n  a
Commodore machine will stick
with cassette tape units for
some time, Although speed of
access is important in business
ﬁles, t h e comparative slow
speed of  tape units can b e
tolerated in  the home. The
term 'ﬁle' is often used in
rather a  loose w ay. F o r
example, we speak of program
'ﬁles' but all we really mean is
that w e  h ave saved t h e
complete program on tape -
we have called the program
itself a  'ﬁle'. A  data ﬁle is
something quite different. You
can't RUN a data ﬁle because
all it  contains is information
required by a  program. The
program must be loaded ﬁrst
and m u st  co n t ain  lin es
which start reading in the data
ﬁle. Obviously, the data ﬁle
must already be resting in the
cassette unit and rewound to
the correct position.
The OPEN statement
Even i n  conventional ﬁling
systems, you can't put a new
slip of paper in a folder unless
you open it ﬁrst. Similarly, you
must close the folder again
before slipping it back into the
ﬁling cabinet. I t  i s hardly
surprising therefore that BASIC
keywords exist which have
equivalent action. That is to say,

P r o g r a m m i n g

we have the OPEN statement
and the CLOSE statement. The
format of the OPEN statement
for tape ﬁles is a bit frightening
at ﬁrst:
OPEN ﬁle number, device,
number, secondary address,
ﬁle name
The meanings are as follows:
File number: this can be any
number you lik e between 0
and 255. It is just in case you
want t o  distinguish between
two different ﬁles under the
same collective ﬁle name.
Device number: since data ﬁles
are k e p t  o n  p e r ip h e r a l
equipment the computer must
know which one. The tape unit
in the CBM 64 is always device
number 1.
Secondary address: t h is
number informs the computer
what you want the peripheral
to do. ( the term secondary
'address' is a misleading term
because it is not an address at
all in the normal sense.) In the
case of the tape unit, you have
the following choice:
0 = read information from tape
1 = write information to tape
2 = write information to tape
and plac e a n  end-of-tape
marker at the end.
File name: this can b e any
name o f  y our  ow n choice
providing t h e  number  o f
characters does not exceed 16.
All this may seem like a load
of gobbledegook unt il y ou
study the following examples:
Example:
OPEN 1,1,0, "ORGANISMS"
This opens ﬁle number 1 for
reading data from tape.
Example:
OPEN 1,1,1,"PLANETS"
This opens ﬁle number 1 for
writing data to tape.
Example:
OPEN 1,1,2,"WEAPONS"
This opens ﬁle number 1 for
writing data t o  t a p e a n d
appends an end-of-ﬁle marker.
Example:
OPEN 1,1,0,N$
This opens ﬁle number 1 for
reading data from tape. The ﬁle
name has been previously
assigned to the variable
Note that t h e  ﬁrst t w o
parameters are the same in all
the above examples. The ﬁrst
one, the ﬁle number, could
have been any other chosen
number but it is unusual to take
advantage o f  different ﬁle
numbers under the same ﬁle
name so, from now on, we shall
always use 1 as the ﬁle number
- i t  makes life easier. The
second number will always be 1
when using tape so the only
difference i s  i n  t h e  thir d
number and the ﬁle name.
There are several default states
allowed f o r  simplifying a n
OPEN statement but it is a lazy
way o u t  a n d  against t h e
interests of good structure.
The O PEN  f o r ma t  f o r
Commodore machines is a bit
on the weird side, so some
readers may be interested in
the underlying history. It all
began with the ﬁrst machine
which Commodore launched
called the PET 2001. I t  was,
arguably, the ﬁrst machine to
capture public interest in this
country way back in prehistoric
times -the early Seventies, that
is. The designers, rightly or
wrongly, decided t o  use a
special input/output bus which
was achieving some fame as the
new 's tandard'. T his  was
originally proposed b y  t h e
famous ﬁrm of Hewlett Packard
for standardising computer
control of instrumentation. It
later became known as the IEE
488 Bus Protocol. Apart from
the introduction of the terms
'Device address' and 'Secon-
dary address', the important
innovation was the concept of
daisy chaining all peripherals
together on the same bunch
of eight data wires with another
bunch o f  eight for  passing
c ontr ol s ig n a ls ,  d e v i c e
addresses a n d  s ec ondary
addresses. T h e  system was
brilliant but it is a matter of
conjecture whether Commo-
dore was, i n  t h e  original
instance, wise to choose such a
bus system. I t  was  nev er
intended to be employed in
home computer systems -  it
was over sophisticated for such
a purpose. As  events have
turned out, hardly any other
home computer machine used
the I EE 488 bus so Commodore
machines occupy a somewhat
lonely, although n o t  neces-
sarily inferior, position in this
respect.
The CLOSE statement
Once the ﬁle has been opened
and d a t a  transference i s
complete, i t  is  advisable t o
close it immediately, even if
you have to open it again later
on. This is common sense in
ordinary ofﬁce procedure as
well a s  i n  c omputer is ed
versions. The greatest menace
in any ofﬁce is the person who
has a habit of taking a ﬁle out of
the cabinet and leaving it lying
around. The ﬁle has not been
closed properly until i t  has
been returned to the cabinet so
other people can us it again.
The equiv alent ac tion i n
computer terms is the CLOSE
statement. The format is:
CLOSE ﬁle number
CLOSE 1
To emphasise the importance
of closing a ﬁle after you have
ﬁnished tranterring data, you
would d o well to remember
that all tape transfers take place
between a n  area i n  R A M
known as the tape buffer. The
buffer contents are transferred
a block at a time and any bits
left o v e r  a f t e r  t h e  la s t
completed transfer will be left
there unless the ﬁle is CLOSed.
In other  words, until y ou
CLOSE a ﬁle, the data transfer
between computer and tape is
not complete and you will get
read errors when you later try
to retrieve the data.
The PRINT # statement
When a tape ﬁle is OPENed, the
PRINT # statement is normally
used for 'printing' data to tape.
The simpliﬁed format is:
PRINT # ﬁle number,variable
The ﬁle number must be the
same as the ﬁle number used in
the OPEN statement, Since we
have agreeed to always use a
ﬁle n u m b e r  o f  1 ,  s ome
examples would be:
'PRINT # 1,N
'PRINT #1,A$
PRINT # 1,AS(F,R)
1
PRINT #1,FS%:PRINT #1,NF%:
PRINT # 1 "
A word of warning here about
using commas or semicolons to
separate variables: they do not
have the same effect as they
would in an ordinary PRINT
statement. If punctuation is to
be printed to tape, you should
use t h e  appropriate ASCII
characters in s t e a d .  F o r
example, CHRS(44) must be
used to print the comma. The
last of the four examples above
shows a safe way of printing
separate variables t o  tape;
separate PRINT # statements
are used.
Since w e  hav e decided t o
always use 1 as the ﬁle number, T h e  IN PU T  # s t at ement
the statement becomes,
This is  the mirror image o f
PRINT # and is used to read
back characters from a data
tape. Some examples:
!INPUT #1,N
[INPUT # 1,A$
'INPUT #1,AS(F,R)
!INPUT #1,FS%,NF94"
Unlike the PRINT # statement,
commas can be used in the
INPUT # statement to separate
variables.

Simple test programs
To get the feel of data tape
programming. key in Program
7.1 which should print the
numbers 1 to 10 on tape. Don't
RUN it yet.
Program 7.1
100 REM PRINTING NUMBERS
ON TAPE
110 NS="TEST"
120 OPEN 1,1,1,N$
130 FOR N=1 TO 10
140 PRINT#1,N
150 NEXT
160 CLOSE1
RUN it  only after you have
ensured a blank cassette (or
one recorded with data n o
longer required) is in position
and rewound. The program
should then print the numbers
on tape.
Program 7.2 is a  simple
program for reading back the
numbers from tape. Again,
make sure the data tape is
rewound and ready before
running Program 7.2
Program 7.2
100 REM READING NUMBERS
FROM TAPE
100 NS="TEST"
120 OPEN 1,1,0,NS
130 FORN=1 TO 10
140 INPUT 1, N
50 PRINT N
150 NEXT
160 CLOSE1
Once you are satisﬁed that you
can send and retrieve numbers
from tape, run the programs
again but alter the FOR loop in
both of them to read 1 TO 1000,
or even 1 TO 10000. This will
take some time but will provide
a good test for your tape unit -
a worth while exercise before
trusting it with important data.
The slightest read-back error in
a number w ill provoke a
corresponding error message
from the operating system.
Now we have seen how to
incorporate data tapes into
programs, it is time to delve
into some o f  t h e  jargon
employed in computer ﬁling
systems. F o r example, w e
should know  precisely t h e
difference between a  ﬁle, a
record and a  ﬁeld within a
record. We must also know the
difference b et w een  a n
ordinary ﬁeld and a key ﬁeld.
Files
We shall deﬁne a ﬁle as a set of
data items, all relating to the
same subject, which can be
held o n  tape (or disc) and
accessable b y  a  suitable
program. Depending on our
interests (and age) we might
keep ﬁles on Butterﬂies, Birds,
Football teams, Names and
addresses, etc etc.
Records
If, for example, we have a ﬁle
on b i rd s,  t h e n  a l l  t h e
information relating t o  t he
Green Tit will be treated as a
separate record, So the ﬁle
named " B I R D S "  w o u l d
contain separate records for
• each type of bird. It must be
possible, of course, to extract
any individual record from the
ﬁle for examination at any time.
Fields
A record on the Green Tit
would contain separate bits of
information such as colour,
size, habitat, shape of beak and
diet. These are called ﬁelds.
The key ﬁeld is the one
which is used t o  uniquely
identify a record. This, in the
case of our ﬁle on birds, would
be the bird's NAME. It would
be absurd to choose COLOUR
as the keyﬁeld because lots of
different birds have the same
colour but, hopefully, not the
same name. A record is quickly
located w ithin a  ﬁl e  b y
searching f o r t h e required
keyﬁeld.
Field headings
When a ﬁle is initially created,
one of the ﬁrst tasks is to decide
on the heading of each ﬁeld.
This information is an essential
part of the ﬁle and must be
stored together with the actual
information u n d er each
heading. Hgure 7.1 s h o w s
example ﬁeld headings of a ﬁle.
Field length
The number o f  characters
allowed in each ﬁeld is called
the ﬁeld length. The number of
characters allowed can b e
decided when a ﬁle is ﬁrst set
up (created) or, more simply,
ﬁxed at some value, say, 18
characters m axim u m  i f
memory space is at a premium.
Simple ﬁle organisation
There are many ways in which a
ﬁle can be laid out (organised)
but for tape store ﬁles, the main
body of the ﬁle is conveniently
stored in the form of a two-
dimensional (rectangular)
array. That is to say, in the form
of 'horizontal' ro w s an d
'vertical' columns in an array
such as A$(F%,R%). F% is an
integer variable representing a
particular ﬁeld number of a
record and R% represents a
particular record number. The
ﬁelds could b e  numbered
starting from ﬁeld 1 upwards.

[DIET
Figure 7.1. Field headings created
for a  ﬁl e  called "BIRDS".
Remember to store the headings
along with the information stored
under them.
In fact, this would appear to be
the n a t u r a l m e t h o d  o f
numbering. Howev er, this
would be extremely inefﬁcient
because, when a n  array is
DIMensioned, the interpreter
reserves three bytes for each
string descriptor in the array.
(One byte for string length and
two by tes  f o r  t h e  s tr ing
address). Thus, in a ﬁle of 100
records, we could waste 300
bytes by not using the 0 ﬁeld
element. In view of this, the
keyﬁeld should be ﬁeld 0, the
next, ﬁeld 1 and so on.
On the other hand, records
are bes t number ed f r o m
Record 1 onwards because it
leaves t h e  0  s lot f o r  ﬁeld
headings. For example, if each
record is to have three ﬁelds,
the keyﬁeld heading would be
in A$(0,0), the second heading
in AS(1,0) and the third heading
in A$(2,0). Ingure 7.2 s hows
how ﬁelds and records are
related in the array.
File length
The ﬁle length is the number of
records it contains. Because an
array has to be DIMensioned,
an estimate of the maximum
number o f  records must be
made during the creation of a
new ﬁle. As a warning against
greed, we should point out that
for tape, the entire ﬁle must be
capable of ﬁtting into RAM.
We c a n ' t  b r in g  o u t  o n e
particular record from within a
tape ﬁle. In other words, we
can't have random acces t o  a
record unless the whole ﬁle is
loaded into RAM.
Heading information
A tape data ﬁle must contain
certain heading information in
addition t o  t h e  rectangular
array holding the records and
ﬁeld headings. This inform-
ation will include the following
together with some suggested
variable names:
Maximum ﬁle size (FS%). This is
required f o r  DIMensioning

YEHTZEE I S  THE PERFECT
example of a family or party
game -  this is one of a small
number of games which allow
more than one person to play
at once. Up to six players can
participate in this game which
is a welcome change from the
shoorem-up type games of
which t h ere i s  already a
myriad o n  t h e  m a rk e t
nowadays.
The basic idea of the game is
to ﬁll your card by rolling dice
and getting t h e required
sequences. Once one of the
combinations of the dice which
you need turns up, you can
mark it down on your card,
winning t h e  appropriate
points. However, if you cannot
do an yt h in g w i t h  y o u r
sequence, you must strike off
one of the remaining choices
When your card is complete
the computer w i l l  t o t al
up the score and display it
with your players' totals on the
master scoreboard.
Playing the game
When the program is run, you
will be greeted by a title page
and a  question: 'how many
players?'. Wh en  yo u  have
entered the correct number,
the screen will clear and you
must enter the names of all the
players, pressing RETURN after
each one.
The g am e commences
when t h e  playing screen
appears. The name o f  the
player is displayed under the
title and below that are the
various combinations of the
dice which must be sought. The
top half of the card is made up
of the individual numbers, for
example 'threes' where you try
to get as many threes as
possible. This is exactly the
same for the other numbers,
except you must get as many of
that number instead. If the total
of the top half exceeds ﬁfty, a
bonus of thirty points will be
awarded. T h e  lo w er h alf  required dice, by using joystick
or cursor keys, and by pressing
consists of:
Three of a kind :  three dice with the same number
— score 3 x number
Four of a kind :  four dice with the same number
— score 4 x number
Low straight 
:
 A sequence of four e.g. 1,2,3,4
— score 30
Hi Straight 
:
 A sequence of ﬁve e.g. 1,2,3,4,5
— score 40
Full house 
:
 Two of a number & three of another
— score 25
Yehtzee 
:
 All ﬁve dice the same
— score 50 *jackpot*
You are given three throws
before you have to 'use it'. To
stop the dice from spinning
press the ﬁre button on the
joystick or the space bar. After
the ﬁrst or second spin, you
hold the individual dice by
moving the marker under the

down. Pr e s s  s p a c e  o r

ﬁgures before the third spin,
press 'h' and you will miss out

A cursor will now appear
against the 'ones' entry which
you can move to the desired
place on the card by using the
cursor keys o r the joystick.
When this is done, press the
ﬁrebutton o r  space bar t o
enter, or 'h' to 'strike off' an
option. Once struck off, an
option cannot be used again in
the same game.
When all the entries are
complete, the totals will be
displayed on the card. After
pressing t h e spacebar, t h e
master scoreboard w ill b e
shown with all t h e scores
together. Up to six games can
be played in one full match. At
the end, an  order will b e
produced displaying t h e
winner etc. Happy throwing!

/ have been using my VIC 20 (expanded)
with a VIC 1525 printer to run self-written
programs f or m y small business. T o
achieve higher memory, I have recently,
updated to a Commodore 64 which is
advertised to run the VIC 1525 printer.
Whatever 1 do, either in program or direct
mode, I can only achieve a 'device not
present' error message following printing
instructions. The printer handbook does
state 'User deﬁned machine language
!RIR routine should not exceed 10 milli-
seconds. If this is done, the printer may
give 'device not present error'. I can only
think that t h e n ew  64's effectively
introduce an error in this manner but lam
at a loss to know how to get round it.
Please can you help me.
P.D. Horne

Two things to try here. Firstly there is a
switch at the back of your 1525 right next
to the/halal port which selects the listen
address of the printer. II is worth checking
that this switch hasn't been moved when
you plugged the 1525 into your 64.
Secondly • cau se o f  t h e screen
update times on the 64 the serial bus
timing is slightly slower than on the VIC
20. This normally means that the bus may
occasionally 'hang' when VIC 20 devices
are used with a 64, but may also give
device not present. To overcome this the
64 screen must be disabled while using
the serial bus. This is achieved by re-
setting bit 4 of register 17 in the VIC chip.
POKE 1 3 *  4096 +17,PEEK(13*4096+17)
and (255-16)
To re-enable the screen use:
i
E
 or 16
POKE 13*4096+17, PEEK(13*4096+17)
Note all sprites must also be disabled.

f
 both of these give no joy then I suggest
you upgrade your printer for an MPS801
or MPS 802 which both use 64 bus timing.
bought a  Commodore 64 on 26th
November 1983 and have just discovered
a slight problem on the T. display.
Although all the necessary information is
transmitted to the screen, there is a 'wavy
line' appearance which is more apparent
on the background colours, it looks like a
type of interference pattern so I have tried
re-tuning the TV set, disconnecting the
cassette player, moving the computer and
power pack away from one another and
the TV set. The pattern is not apparent on
normal TV reception but appears when a
computer program is being run and when
the computer is ready t o receive a
program. Please could you help me.
Gordon Wake
Northumberland
The Interference you observe is caused by
internal operations of the 64. The only
way around this problem is to use a
monitor or TV that has a Composite Video
input and connect it  directly t o the
video/audio port of your 64. Alternatively
you could use an external RF converter,
(or example a video recorder by using the
video-in socket.
Does a command exist in Commodore 64
BASIC to save machine code? If not please
could you tell me how to save machine
code.
John Milmine
Glasgow
OUTPUT
There is no BASIC command that enables
a machine program to be saved directly.
However by adjusting the pointers to the
start and end of BASIC text the SAVE
routine can be fooled into saving your
machine code. The start position is stored
in locations 43 and 44. The high byte in 44
and the low byte in 43. For example, if
your program starts at $5110 then the high
byte is 511r1611r1 or 81 and the low byte is
1*16+0 or 16. The end address is similarly
stored in locations 45 and 46.
Note that when these locations have
been changed you cannot access any
BASIC variables so all calculations must be
worked out on the screen and not stored
into variables. When all four POKES have
been done the program can be saved as if
it were a normal BASIC program. If you
wish t o  re-use BASIC after saving
locations 43 to 45 must be restored to their
original value, so it's a good idea to note
them down on a piece of paper ﬁrst.
If your machine code program sits
above top of BASIC i.e. $A000 then type
POKE 56, 13*256: dr ﬁrst.
When re-loading the program add an
extra parameter 1 to the load instruction,
e.g.
LOAD "M/C”,1,1
This stops the machine code being re-
located when it is loaded.
couple of weeks ago I changed
ulty VIC 20 for another one. I wrot
ogram on my ﬁrst VIC 20 which u
double sized characters using the address
36883 to drop the bottom of the screen
but the screen will not drop with my
second VIC 20. I  also tried 36867 but
without any luck. Please could you help.
Paul Holiyer
Hampshire
The location 36883 is actually a reﬂection
of the true location 36867 but should still
work on any VIC 20. If bit 0 is set then the
VIC chip uses character matrix of 8*16
pixels. If this does not work on your new
VIC 20 then I suggest you return it to your
supplier as it must have a hardware fault.
I own a Commodore 64 and have recently
bought B C  BASIC which is a  great
improvement to the standard machine.
Unfortunately BC BASIC does not support
the 'paint' or 'ﬁll' function and! cannot ﬁll
the graphic objects with the colour of my
choice.

L e t t e r s
Is a routine available to make a paint or
ﬁll command? If not, how can I get round
this routine in  the BC BASIC or  the
standard 'Pokey' BASIC.
Robert Ca rua na
Malta
A routine to perform ﬁll is too long to
publish here but I  intend shortly to
publish a fast algorithm for ﬂood ﬁlling
objects along with a circle algorithm both
of which will be easily adapted to use the
graphics commands o f  an y BASIC
extensions.
LEGE*
When I move the VIC c h i p  to obtain
extra memory, and move the start o f
BASIC up to location 4096, how do I locate
the sprite pointers, i.e. 2040-2047?
.ISI.Sumner
t
en you move the start of BASIC the
*ion of the sprite pointers do not
change. The sprite pointers only move if
you change the 16K block number that
the VIC II chip accesses by changing the
control lines at location $DDOO and then
they move in steps of 16K along with all
other video RAM locations including the
screen.

I am a  fairly recent owner o f  the
Commodore 64_ The handbook has an
appendix N  -  a  Bibliogr aphy  o f

interest to the Commodore 64 user.
While there is no reference there to the
64 there is frequent mention of PET. How
similar are these two machines?
A, Harkness

The Commodore PET uses an identical
version of Microsoft BASIC to the 64 but
has n o  special hardware features.
Reference books covering the PET will
only help you master standard BASIC
programs but will not help you make the
most of the many features of your 64. I
would therefore strongly recommend
that you read some of the many good
OUTPUT
publications speciﬁcally for the 64. I
would particuarly recommend t h e
Programmers Reference Guide.
I have written a BASIC program for sorting
inputs into alpha-numerical order with a
variety of facilities. One of these is the
ability t o  LO AD ﬁles for  viewing o r
editing. There is a minor problem with
this. When searching for say, the third ﬁle
on the tape (by its name). On a friend's 64,
the screen lights up with each ﬁle found, a
message saying what it has found appears
and the screen blanks out for 5 seconds
before proceeding t o  the nex t ﬁle.
Although my computer searches for and
loads, the correct ﬁle every time, it does
not have the 5 second time delay. The
screen ﬂashes, but does not give enough
time to see what is on the screen during
the 'ﬂash'.
Although it is not absolutely necessary
to see what's happening during a search,
it is a little worrying that, presumably, a
built in function is either missing or going
wrong. I  returned my machine to the
suppliers, but they couldn't ﬁnd anything
wrong and said that the 'ﬂashing' rather
than a  deﬁnite time delay is  normal.
However, I  am not convinced that two
identical machines s hould operate
differently.
also have another problem. I hope to
incorporate scrolling into my program
during the delete option - i.e. to scroll the
existing list in memory upward until the
one to be deleted is on the screen and
then break the scroll with, say, the space
bar.
Page 1 2 9  o f  t h e  Programmers
Reference Guide says that a machine
language routine is needed to shift the
entire screen o n e  character i n  t h e
direction o f  the scroll. However, the
example program on the following page
does not include this machine language
routine or, as far as can see, any clue as to
where to ﬁnd it.
When I include the example program
in my program, the ﬁrst data line on the
screen overprints onto the second onto
the third, etc. for a few milliseconds, thus
making the data difﬁcult to look at. Is this
due to the missing machine code routine
or do I need to get into raster interrupt of
some sort? Any help you can give me
would be greatly appreciated.

Not all 64s have exactly t he same
operating system; minor modiﬁcations
were made with later models. For
example, early 64s when clearing the
screen set the foreground colour of every
character t o  b e  t h e same as t h e
background. But on later models the
foreground colour was set to the current
printing colour thus enabling characters
to be POKEd to the screen without having
to set the colour map ﬁrst. So it is quite
likely that your 64 has a later version of
ROMs that do not display the ﬁlename
found if it is not the name it is looking for
so as to speed up the process of ﬁnding
the correct ﬁle. However your 64 should
display the ﬁlename for 5 seconds if it is
the one requested.
When scrolling upwards there is no
need f or any special machine code
routine for moving the screen as BASIC
automatically scrolls the screen upwards
when printing a carriage return or cursor
down on the bottom line of the screen.
The example program shown in  the
Programmers Reference Guide uses this
feature by printing a carriage return on
the bottom line of the screen in line 30 so
that the screen is scrolled up ready for the
message to be printed in line 50. I typed
the listing in and found it to work with no
modiﬁcations so  i t  must b e  your
implementation of the routine that is at
fault. Make sure that you always position
the cursor on the bottom line of the
screen and print a cursor down before
printing the next line. The easiest way of
doing this is to deﬁne a string which
consists of a home character (CHR$(9))
followed by 25 cursor downs and print this
string immediately before the text you
wish to print.

Windows can add a
professional touch to your
RECENTLY, 'WINDOWS' HAVE BECOME
popular as one of a number of ways of
making computers easier t o  use. The
mouse, of course, is another of them.
Both Digital Research and MicroSoft have
produced software that c an support
windows, and Apple's Lisa and Macintosh
are also capable of maintaining them.
A window is a rectangular region of
the screen in which the output from, and
the results of, a particular computation
can appear quite independently of the
rest of the screen. With the ability to
maintain and manipulate more than one
window at a time, a microcomputer can
appear to be carrying on more than one
application simultaneously. It could, for
example, show t he state o f  a  wor d
processing program in one window, the
results of  the sorting operations of  a
database program in another, and a chart
produced by  a graphics program in a
third.
One of the ways in which windows can
make computers easier t o  use is by
allowing information to be exchanged
between two programs simply by moving
it from the window of one program to that
of the other. In this way, for example,
moving the graph displayed in its window
by a graphics program to the window of a
word p r o c e s s in g  p r o g r a m  w i l l
automatically cause it to be incorporated
as an illustration in the document being
produced. And a complex operation has
been achieved with the greatest of ease.
The Project
This month's programming project is to
write a  p r o g r a m  t o  m a k e  y o u r
Commodore 64 maintain a window on its
screen in which text can be placed and
automatically scrolled when necessary.
One way of programming this is to make
use of the PEEK and POKE instructions.
There are many other  operations
associated with windows that you can
then go on to implement in order to make
a windowing facility that is as ﬂexible and
useable as possible. These include being
able to scroll it  both downwards and
upwards, panning i t  sideways, and
moving it to another location.
When talking of scrolling and panning
a window, it  is usual t o  express any
movement as that of the window over the
text that is being viewed through the
window. This means, for example, that

panning a window to the right should give
the same effect as is caused when a real
window is actually moved to the right.
Confusingly, perhaps, the movement of
the text seen through the window will be
to the left.
The solution
The ﬁrst things that we must decide are
the size of the window and its position
on the screen. We shall place the top left
corner of the window in the row with its
number stored under TR and in  the
column with its number stored under TC.
The window will be W columns wide and
H rows high. This will locate the window
as shown in Figure 1.
We begin the program by clearing the
screen and initialising these variables
with:
10 PRINT "n"
20 TR=15: TC=15: W=5: H=5
Then we set the colour for the characters
that will be displayed in the window by
POKEing the same number into all the
locations in  the colour memory. The
colour memory extends from location
55296 to 56295, and putting a number
from 0 to 15 in these locations determines
the colour in which any character that we
POKE to the screen memory will appear.
The entire colour memory is  POKEd
because the window may b e placed
anywhere on the screen. We shall use 7 to
make t he characters i n  t he window
yellow, and the loop for this is:
30 FOR K=55296 TO 56295
:POKE K,7: NEXT K
It is convenient to use the variable SCR
to hold the address of the location in the
screen memory that is mapped to the
position at the top left corner of the
screen. This is initialised by:
40 SCR=1024
At this stage, we can see the window
by putting an inverted space (a solid
yellow block) in each character position
in the window. This can be done by
POKEing 160 to every location in the area
of screen memory that corresponds to the
window. Note that the c ode for  an
inverted space is 32, the code for a space,
plus 128. As the position at the top left of
the screen is mapped to SCR, the position
in row R and column C is mapped to the
location with address 5CR+40-0r(R-1)+C-1.
Using this formula, we can highlight the
window by:
50 FOR R=TR TO TR-I-H-1:
FOR C=TC TO TC+W-1
60 AD=SCR-1-40CR-1)-I-O-1
70 POKE AD,160
SO NEXT C; NEXT R
Now that we can see the window, we
can think about getting input from the
keyboard and placing it in the window.
We shall hold the position in the window
at which the next character is to be placed
by storing its column under CC and its
row under  CR. These variables ar e
initialised by:
100 CR=TR: CC=TC
We can get a character from the keyboard
and store it under AS by:
110 GET AS: I F  A$=""
THEN 110
It can then be placed at its proper position
in the window by calculating the address
of the location in screen memory to which
its position is mapped (as before), ﬁnding
its code, and then POKEing the code into
that location. The code can be found by
using the function ASC; unfortunately,
this function gives codes that are different
from the ones used by POKE. To obtain
the correct codes to use with POKE for
letters, for instance, it is necessary to
subtract 64 from the ASCII codes given by
ASC. This gives us the lines:
140 I R D = S C R
150 C=ASC(AS): I F  C>64
THEN CC-64
160 POKE ABC
We c an n o w  update t h e  character
position and return t o  get the next
character from the keyboard with:
170 CC=CC+1
180 GOTO 110
1

P r o g r a m m i n g
A gap has been left between lines 110
and 140 because, as you will ﬁnd if you run
the program as it has developed so far, it is
ﬁne until it reaches the edge of the
window; then it runs out of the window
rather than wrapping round to the start of
the next line in the window. We must
place lines in the gap to put this right.
First, we can test for the end of the
window: if the column number of the
next position for a character becomes
bigger than t he last column o f  the
window, then w e should change the
position to that at the beginning of the
next row in the window. This can be done
by:
120 I F CC>TC+W-1 THEN CC=TC:
CR=CR+1
This additional line makes the program
work properly until it reaches the bottom
of the window. Without any further
addition the new characters will extend
the window, at the same width, to the
bottom of the screen. To ascertain when
the window is full we can ﬁnd when the
row of the position for the next character
is bigger than the last row of the window.
When this happens, we must scroll the
window downwards, so that the top line
vanishes and a blank line appears at the
bottom. We must also change the position
for the next character to the beginning of
the bottom row of the window. This
situation is illustrated in Figure 2,
We shall write a subroutine starting at
line 1000 for the scrolling, and so the
instruction we need is:
130 I F CR)TR-I-H-1 THEN
00SUB 1000
The scrolling can be achieved by copying
the second row of the window into the
ﬁrst row, the third row into the second,
and so on until the bottom row has been
copied into the row above it. Then the
bottom row must be ﬁlled with spaces.
The copying is done by PEEKing each
position in a row to ﬁnd the code for the
character there, and then POKEing this
code into the location corresponding to
the same column in  the row above.
Fortunately, PEEK and POKE use the same
codes, and so there is no need to convert
the codes. The subroutine is:
1000 FOR R=TR+1 TO TR-H-I-1
1010 FOR C=TC TO TC+W-1
1020 AD=SCR-I-40*(R-1)+C-1
1030 POKE AD-40/ PEEK(AD)
1040 I F R=TR-4-H-1 THEN POKE

Figure 2 - Window before (bold line) and

We can add extra capabilities to the
window program, as suggested in the
problem section, but how do we call them
up? One common method is to use keys
that are rarely, if ever, used for other
purposes; that is the approach that we
shall adopt. But it must be remembered
that when using the program these keys
cannot be used to position the character
on them in the window. The following
subroutines, that start with the line
numbers 2 0 0 0 ,  3 0 0 0  a n d  4000,
respectively, implement sideways
panning, moving t h e  window an d
reversing I  he f o reg ro u n d  a n d
background colours of the display in a
window. The characters used to invoke
these capabilities are, respectively,
@,#and—.
The subroutines all work in a way that
is similar to a part of the program that has
already been described, so rather than
repeating explanations that have already
been given w e shall just present the
subroutines.
The additions to the program that call
the subroutines that provide the extra
capabilities are:
112 I F  A$="@" THEN OCISUB
2000: 00TO 110
114 I F  FiS="*" THEN GOSUB
3000: 00TO 110
116 I F  AS="4." THEN GOSUB
4000: 00TO 110
The subroutine for panning the window
pans it to the right, but also brings the lost
left-hand column over to the right. It is:
2000 C=TC
2010 FOR R=TR TO TR-I-H-1
2020 AD=3CR+40*(R-1)
2030 B(R-TR-I-1)=PEEK(HD)
2040 NEXT R
2050 FOR C=TC+1 TO TC+W-1
2060 FOR R=TR TO TR-I-H-1
2070 AD=SCR-1-40*(R-1)
2080 POKE AD-1,PEEK(AD)
2090 NEXT R: NEXT C
2100 C=TC-I-W-1
2110 FOR R=TR TO TR+H-1
2120 AD=SCR4-40*(R-1)+C
2130 POKE HD, B(R-TR+1)
2140 NEXT R
2150 RETURN
The subroutine f o r moving t h e
window asks by how much the window is
to be moved. Positive numbers indicate
that it is to be moved to the right and
downwards. Negative numbers indicate 4 7
movement to the left and upwards. This
subroutine assumes that the new position
for the window does not overlap the old
one. It is:
:

P r o g r a m m i n g
3000 INPUT "MOVE BLO(R AND
C)"; NR;NC
3010 M=40*NR+NC
3020 FOR R=TR TO TR-14-1-1
3030 FOR C=TC TO TC+W-1
3040 AD=SCR-#.40*(R-1)+C-1
3050 POKE AD-1-M,PEEK(AD)
3060 NEXT C: NEXT R
3070 RETURN
The subroutine for inverting the window
operates by adding 128 to all the codes for
characters in the window that are less than
128, and subtracting 128 from the others.
It is:
4000 FOR R=TR TO TR-1-H-1
4010 FOR C=TC TO TC4-W-1
4020 AD=SCR+40*(R-1)+C-1
4030 I F  PEEK(AD)<128 THEN
POKE AD;PEEK(AD)-1-128:
GOTO 4050
4040 POKE AD, PEEK(AD)-128
4050 NEXT C
4060 NEXT R
4070 RETURN
Further developments
There are many ways in  which the
facilities provided b y  t h e  program
developed here can be improved. They
include the following:
*The window itself could be highlighted
at all times by showing it with a different
background colour to the rest of the
display.
*  The subroutine for moving a window
could be amended to work properly even
when the new position overlaps the old
one. This would involve copying the
window to a  temporary store before
copying it from there to the new position.
*When a window is moved, perhaps the
old one should b e erased, o r even
replaced by what was there in the ﬁrst
place.
*  Mo re than o n e window can b e
operated at the same time, and any output
must be directed to the window for which
it is intended. The different windows
could display their contents in different
colours.
*  Faster methods o f  scrolling and
panning can be developed.
*  If a window is panned to the right and
then immediately panned to the left again
perhaps it should bring back the original
contents rather than blank spaces.
i o  *  When a window is moved, the new
r
. J o  w indow  could be made the one to which
0
input always goes to the same window
although copies of the current state of the
window can be made all over the screen.

opponent's standard. It is a two player
game which requires thought and a good
memory as  army  strengths ar e n o t
revealed until an army goes into battle
and mergers occur.
The game has been split into 3 parts
because of the memory limitations of the
VIC 20.

Program 2
This program displays a map which is built
up of the river, 5 bridges, huts and trees —
all placed at random. Each player then
locates his armies. The information for the
location of each army, bridge, tree, etc, is
stored in  the unused are of memory
(above the user deﬁned graphics which is
protected by lowering the top of the RAM
in program 1.) This is necessary because
there is no room in program 3 to ﬁt a
routine to input army locations.
Program 3
This contains the game itself (some lines
contain more than 88 characters so care
needs to be taken when typing it in). This
program only just ﬁts into the available
memory and therefore, there is no room
for REM statements. The following gives a
more detailed description o f  th e
program.

P e  1541 disc drive is slow.
All is not lost. Barry Miles
looks at the 1541 Flash 
d
i
THERE I S CONSIDERABLE INTEREST
these days in  speeding u p  the data
transfer achieved by the Commodore
1541 disc drive. A slow serial drive at the
best of times, this machine can be slowed
still further by reading errors caused by
bad alignment. Often the bad alignment
itself is caused by the type of software
which makes the read/write head of the
disc drive bump successively against the
stop thereby knocking it out of alignment.
DOS-protected software has a  lot t o
answer forl
If you drive ﬂashes its red light
frequently when reading discs, this new
device from Supersoft will not solve your
problem. The ﬁrst thing to do is to get
your drive properly aligned by an expert.
However i f  yo u r d isc functions
satisfactorily but slowly because of its
serial nature, you may well be interested
in this new device. 1541 Flash is one of a
number of ways in which producers of
software and hardware are seeking to aid
the frustrated user who ﬁnds the delays
with the 1541 disc drive absolutely
interminable. Methods chosen so far by
various designers include having a
cartridge plugged into the cartridge slot
and connected by a wire into the 64;
saving your program in a special way so
that it loads faster; and now a hardware
system which plugs into both the 1541 and
the 64 to achieve similar results. Which
way you will choose to go will depend on
how much faster you want the 1541 to be,
and also on the depth of your pocket!
Getting started
The manual for this device warns you that
it will take about half an hour to install.
Whether you ﬁnd this estimate correct
depends on the experience which you
already have in removing and replacing
chips in your machine. You will need to
take both the 64 and the 1541 apart, and
will have to remove chips from each and
mount them into special carriers. Finally,
you will have to re-install these carriers in
the machine. This is the sort of action
which will be no hardship for people who
are used to handling chips, but would be
likely to frighten the newcomer to death!
In any case, you should not do such work
yourself if your machines are still in the
warranty period: leave it to a Commodore
dealer. That said, if you are experienced in
handling these devices, it is not a difﬁcult
task a t  a ll t o  make the necessary
connections.
1541 Flash is considerably more than a
fast loader program. It offers a variety of
additional commands including all the
normal DOS or Wedge commands with
which Commodore users, especially old-
timers who have used the PET machines,
are very familiar. In addition to this, there
is a group of "Easy Everyday Commands".
Perhaps the most attractive of these is the
one which allows the program to be
loaded just by pressing SHIFT RUN/STOP.
This is further enhanced by the fact that it
loads machine code programs at their
correct addresses; in  wother words it
substitutes for the rather long-winded
"LOAD"*",8,1". In  order to load the
program ordinarily, you simply type
LOAD" and the name of the program
followed by the RETURN key. Both of
these commands offer real advantages to
the user.
People who wish to list programs to
the printer use OPEN 1:CMD1:LIST and
hit RETURN.
The DOS Support or Wedge program
is started by the "P" sign or the " >",
whichever you ﬁnd the more convenient.
Initialising these commands requires you
to type "SYS 655266", followed b y
RETURN. The switch on the cable card
must b e in  the 1541 Flash position,
(towards the computer) before DOS is
started up. There are eleven standard
DOS commands and three additional
ones added by this program.
One of the major advantages of using
this DOS Support program is that it
remains in  the machine after BASIC
programs have been LOAD and NEWed
one after another.
Thus, you can carry out Renaming,
Scratching, Initialising, Newing and
Copying commands with ease. In addition
you can ﬁnd out why the error light is on.
An interesting additional command is the
one which enables the DOS commands to
be responded to by a device other than
device EL You simply hit "cv" or
followed by " g " then the new device
number. %  followed by the program
name and RETURN will load a program
without re-location or changing the end
links. This enables you to load machine
language or graphics without disturbing
your resident BASIC program.
Editing commands
•
This product adds10 editing commands to
the operating system of the 64. One may
question whether this is a _logical set of
commands to include within a "speedup"
module, but the commands themselves
are undoubtedly convenient. With the aid
of these you can move the CURSOR tothe
bottom of the screen, and tab the cursor
16 spaces from the left side of the screen
(which is useful with some assemblers
and machine code monitors).
You can also escape from the Quote or
Insert mode. You can delete a line, you
can delete a screen from the line on which
=  = I =

H a r d w a r e
the cursor is, and you can put a CHR$(27)
(escape) c ommand w it h in  strings,
enabling you to send control codes to
printers.
If you are to use a 1541 disc drive that
does not have a 1541 ﬂash chips installed,
you can switch your 64 back to normal
operation by  POKE 148,64 followed by
RETURN. This can also b e  done b y
throwing a manual switch on the cable
card. B y  a  somewhat longwinded
command you can tell the 1541 drive to
return t o  its normal slow method o f
transmission. The command is  OPEN
1,8,15 "Z8 slow", followed by RETURN.
Switching the Commdodore 64 back
into high speed mode is accommodated
by POKE 148,0, and you may also switch
the 1541 into the fast mode by OPEN
1,8,15,"Z8 fast" followed by RETURN.
Documentation
The documentation supplied is  quite
good and includes s ome interesting
additional material about as previously
undocumented features of the 1541, for
instance invalid ﬁles with asterisks in their
names can be OPENed. You can APPEND
ﬁles together, other than REL ﬁles, you
can SCRATCH protected ﬁles by setting
bit 6 for the ﬁrst byte, the ﬁle type byte in
the directory entry . Yo u  c a n  als o
CONCATENATE ﬁles (again I thought this
was a standard command). You can also
SCRATCH multiple ﬁles.
Finally, if you open a ﬁle you can use M
as a ﬁle-type function like a wild card, thus
OPEN 2,8,2 "ﬁlename,M,A" will open any
type of ﬁle for appending.
There is  a  section o f  Advanced
Programming Commands which will be of
interest t o  m a c h i n e  l a n g u a g e
programmers. The 1541 can be accessed
from machine language with several new
commands which provide the fastest way
to access the data. For instance, you can
read a speciﬁed sector by  single byte
values and place the data in a buffer.
This command is used in place of a
"Ul" command. Similarly you can write
data to a sector speciﬁed by single byte
values for track and sector with data
coming from a buffer, this is used in place
of U2. You can also send data in  a
particular buffer to the computer at very
high speed. There is a Linked List Loader
whereby you provide the starting track
and sector and the command will then
link through and send all the following
sectors fast.
In using these commands it is possible
to use a special command which enables
you to set up the right speed for your
particular application.
A debugging aid is included in the
system, accessing t h e  Non-Maskable
Interrupt. The manual gives detailed aid
to the machine programmer including
telling you which location will give you
the information that a new 1541 ROM has
been inserted.
Timings
The table shows the timings achieved with
loading and saving various programs
using the 1541 Flash and using exactly the
same disk driv e o n  its  own. This is
important because o f  the substantial
variations i n  s peed f o u n d  w h e n
comparing two different 15415.
Additionally the time taken to read
identical sequential ﬁles using the two
methods is shown. It will be seen that the
acceleration is approximately three times
for program loading, and twic e for
reading sequential ﬁles_
At the moment some games programs
will not load: Flight Simulator II, and some
of t h e  Software Ar ts  products i n
particular. However, Supersoft say that a
new disc ROM is being developed in the
U.S., which should solve this problem.
Conclusions
There is no doubt that this device fulﬁls a
very real need in driving the 1541 at the

sort of speeds to which users of the old
4040 disc drive are accustomed. It appears
to d o  this  w it h  v ery  considerable
reliability, a n d  offer s  s ubs tantial
enhancement such as the DOS Support
System, editing commands and other
advanced programming commands into
the bargain. Users whose only wish is to
speed up their disc drive may feel that
they are paying for rather more than this.
The fact is that the hardware components
make up the larger part of the cost, the
throwing in of additional commands is
not a signiﬁcant issue.
This is an expensive device compared
with others on the market which d o
something similar but less well. You will
have to decide whether it is worth paying
quite a high price to achieve the three
times speed increase, or whether you will
be happier with something which is
cheaper, but which does not do such a
good job.
For those who want the best, at the
time of writing, this is it.

Bilk, bills, bills: those brown
envelopes just keep on
coming. Here is a program by
Ian Rimmer which will help
you keep track of your
household *counts.
THIS PROGRAM MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
reduce your household expenditure but
it will enable you to account for it. The
program is loaded in two parts: when the
ﬁrst part is RUN it loads in the second part
and RUNs it. (The program would most
likely beneﬁt from being compiled.)
The program is  menu and option
driven and is in the main self-explanatory.
It has been exhaustively tested and should
be robust and tolerant irrespective of
entries made by the user.
This is also the ideal program to use
with the Turbo 64 utility listed in the
December issue of Your Commodore: it is
designed to be continually up-dated so
speed in loading would be a great boon.

• If you wish to delete an item from the
bank account because you've made a
mistake, you should ﬁrst consider either
using the error key (if possible) or the
amend key. A deletion will cause the
brought forward balance to change so
ﬁrst of all amend the item to a zero
amount and then delete it.
• The delete key .allows you to remove
items from the bank account and credit
card that appear on the statement.
• In the household accounts and standing
orders you can move from one item to the
next by pressing Return.
• If you make an error when calling up a
function (say you press delete instead of
insert), you will normally be able to cancel
the error by entering a zero. You will then
be given t h e  chance t o  deﬁne the
function required.

Exiting the program
On exit you are again asked whether a
cassette or disc is being used.
If a disc is in use you are presented
with three options:
1. t o  delete a month from the disc.
2. t o  save the month in which case you
are also asked about standing orders as
appropriate.
3. t o  amend the month either to correct
an error or to do another month using the
details held.
If you wish to ﬁnish the program either
deletes or runs itself again, depending on
your choice.
Disc owners
To use on a disc drive the program should
be amended as follows:
Line 220 Delete
line 246 Amend to read "ACCOLINTS1",8
Other options
ERROR restores t o  the position that
existed at the time an account was last
entered

(This is only used in bills records). If it is
not shown as an option it will return you
to the ﬁrst page if used.

information press Return at the end of the
entry. With a ﬂashing cursor all keys work.
With a static cursor you may not enter a

Warning
Some of the lines in the program are
apparently in excess of 80 characters long;
these were entered by using keyword
abbreviations. Take care if  the line is
exactly 80 characters long for the cursor
will drop to the third line (i.e. beyond the
end of the logical line). Unless you cursor
up t o  the ﬁrst or  second line before
pressing Return the line of data you typed
in will not be read into memory.
To check if this has occurred, save the
programs "ACCOUNTS1" and reload it.
Now check values by PEEKing locations 45
and 46 (i.e. -? PEEK (45); PEEK (46)); if they
are not equal to 90 and 86 respectively
the something has been missed.

This is the ﬁrst screen to greet you.
You are asked whether a cassette or
disc drive is being used. This affects
the different ways in which el ﬁle is
read or written. Also, with the disc
option a record of all months on Ilk
is retained and sorted into order.

The Household Book is a typical
exampk of one of the account
options. Amounts of up 09,999.99

more help than this program can
offer.
If only outgoings were really this
small!

Adventures can be created
from literary sources in
Runecaster's book.
ALTHOUGH M A N Y  DEDICAT ED
Commodore 64 adventurers buy and play
this type of software almost exclusively,
some more hardy souls even write their
own. The easy way is to use a program
such as 'The Q uill' by  Gilsoft o r  its
American version 'Adventure Writer'
from the CodeWriter Corporation. Both
of these programs work very well and are
fairly easy to understand and master. A
good number o f  ﬁne adventures are
already o n  the market, having been
written using these utilities.
At present, y ou c an only  design
graphics a r o u n d  t h o s e  gr aphic s
characters accessed by the Commodore
Shift key (the business character set - the
left hand characters shown o n  y our
Commodore 64 keyboard) but Gilsoft
have already bought out an add-on -The
Illustrator -  for their Spectrum Quill, so
let's k eep o u r  ﬁngers crossed f o r
something similar on the Commodore 64.
Even w i t h  t h e  limited graphics
available, I  hav e s een s ome v er y
acceptable results -just plan your pictures
carefully, and before doing anything else,
check o u t  the graphics symbols you
have at your command. There are one or
two useful ones that are shown on the
keyboard.
By the book
The next step down on the convenience
ladder is to copy programs from either
books or magazines. There is one rather
different offering fr om n o w  o n  t h e
market from publishers Addison-VVesley
of Wokingham called "The Secret o f
Arendarvon Castle". This is a 100 odd
page book which costs £5.95 and not only
includes the program to type in but also
some 90 or so pages of history, clues and
suggestions in a very novel form.
The basic storyline is that you follow in
the footsteps o f  a journalist who has
vanished whilst investigating a series of
mysterious events that have taken place at
this rather mystical castle in the far north
west of Scotland. Arendarvon Castle has a
long history stretching back into the
Middle Ages and time and again it has
been link ed n o t  only  w it h  events
recorded in the history books but also a
number of darker 'happenings' where
alchemy and its associated magic seems
not unlikely
The part of the book that introduces,
sets the scene and generally scatters what
might be clues, is good reading and is set
out in a very attractive style. Typefaces
alter throughout the book to simulate the

host of goodies for you to study as you lie
in bed planning your next moves on your 6 9
future sessions with your Commodore 64.
The p r o g r a m  i t s e l f  i s  q u i t e
unintelligible as you type it in? There are
several BASIC programs that enable you
11 
=
'
,

to either create data ﬁles or access this
data once you have ﬁnished typing it all
in. T h e  pr ogr am us es  a  specially
constructed language (?) called ALADIN,
which involves you in typing in copious
amounts of DATA lines.
Typing i n  s uc h vast amounts o f
unassociated numbers and letters is just
asking for trouble , b u t ,  fear not, the
original programmers hav e thought
carefully about this topic and the BASIC
program used to ﬁle away all this data has
an error checking routine built in. This
will draw your attention to the area where
you have made a mistake! Failing that -
you can buy the program on tape from
Addison-Wesley.
Typing in a program of this size mar
well be a daunting task, but again the
book presents us with an attractive (well
acceptable anyway...) system to make this
chore seem easier. The entire program
has been divided into seven steps -  it is
suggested that you start on Monday and
work your way through, using the given
daily schedule! No rest on Sunday here
Each day's input is checked as it is
ﬁnished so all should be set for getting
your game up and running sometime
Sunday afternoon! Assembling the ﬁnal
tape takes a fair bit of time and, when you
eventually RUN your adventure it does
take a long time to load all the data.
I think that, with the care that has gone
into the production of this system, one
additional program might have been
included to enable the loading of not only
the master BASIC operating system but
also that block of memory used to hold all
the games data. This should not be a
difﬁcult task and would probably save
70 o v e r  15 minutes of reading the data from
the sequential ﬁle created on tape.
The game itself is not outstanding but
will k e e p  y o u r  br ain c ells  ac tiv e
for some time, whilst you sort out how to
attempt a solution! 'Arendarvon' is text
only and the response time t o input
commands is a little slow - but still not as
slow as some games on the market. The
program does not specify either screen or
text colours and is displayed in upper case
characters. So before you start, select
colours to suit you and your television/
monitor. Better still, write these lines in at
the beginning of the ﬁnal program. As for
the text, I prefer lower case, but try both
and choose which you prefer.
The game follows a  fairly normal
pattern with verb/noun input and the
usual vocabulary of LOOK, EXAMINE,
INVENTORY, etc.. The input commands
may b e  expanded t o  giv e greater
control a n d  s ome examples giv en
are: c o  TO THE DOOR, OPEN YELLOW
DOOR, PUT FLOWER INTO VASE and
TAKE HOME SPELL. Note the use of TAKE
instead of the more familiar GET also the
s omewhat unus ual., d ir e c t io n a l
commands: G O  LEFT, AHEAD, TURN
RIGHT, etc. I found these a little awkward
to start with, but very quickly got the feel
for them after I had bumped into a few
walls!
There are a number of spells you may
use (Once you have found them!) and
there is also a MEASURE command to
enable you to map out the rooms to see if
there are any secret passages! You may
SAVE your present position within the
castle and RESTORE it at a later date.
All in all, there are quite a few novel
concepts in 'The Secret of Arendarvon
Castle'. I  look  forward to some more
elegant programs from the same source in
the future.
Another magic castle
One of Scott Adams' latest adventures
takes you to a castle in a different realm
altogether. 'The Sorcerer of Claymorgue
Castle', dis tr ibuted b y  Adv entur e
International o f  Bir mingham a n d
available for  the Commodore 64 o n
cassette and disc. It is a text and graphics
adventure a n d  t h e  C o m m o d o r e
'Sorcerer' has been implemented by Brian
Howath of Mysterious Adventures fame.
The name Scott Adams almost guarantees
that you have a game to get your teeth
into and that your brain will have to work
overtime - many of his adventures make
one aware of just how devious 'lateral
thinking' can be when applied to this sort
of product! In brief, Solon the Master
Wizard lost 'the 13 Stars of Power' to
another wizard, Vileroth. This happened a
long time ago and Vileroth was unable to
master the Stars' power. They proved his
downfall but before he died he carefully
hid the Stars. Now, after his destruction.
Solon h a s  s ent h is  faithful y oung
apprentice Beanwick (you) t o try and
recover these valubale artifacts.
The graphics are good and take little
time t o  draw onto the screen. The
location text descriptions are kept to a
minimum and, if you change what would
be seen, a new graphic is produced.
The number of locations which you
can visit initially is fairly limited and you
are, thereby,, forced to ﬁnd out how to use
what you have got with you - namely the
six spells your kindly master, Solon, has
given you. In fact, you cannot get into the
castle without using one of them.
The input command routine is strictly
limited t o  t w o  words -  f o r  normal
purposes, verb-noun. The vocabulary is
not enormous but reasonable synonyms
are accepted. I feel that a certain amount
of guidance should b e  given in  the
instructions - I prefer to get on with the
game than wrestle with using the English
language! A small point is that, when I cast
the Fir,

words; at what?. It took a few frustrating
minutes to learn that the ﬁrst of the two
required words was 'AT' ...simple once
you know!
You may SAVE GAME at any point and
carry on from there and RESTORE to the
saved position on being killed, quitting or
starting afresh. Although the instructions
say you may save your position with a
coded ﬁle name, this too does not appear
to be found in the Commodore 64 tape
version - no matter just make a note of the
tape counter and set the tape position for
the 'restoration' you require!
On ﬁrst RUNning the program, you
are asked: "User Default Colours?" This
needs an input of 'Y' or 'N'. 'N' lets you set
your choice o f  foreground (text) and
background colours -  I  wis h mor e
programs offered this simple but very
useful option.
For all the small frustrations, 'The
Sorcerer o f  Claymorgue Castle' is an
adventure that I ﬁnd I have to return to. As
yet, I have only located three of the Stars
and seem to be baulked at ﬁnding many
additional locations b u t  give me time,
I'll get there!
Evergreen classic
Until recently, I  h a d  n o t  had t h e
opportunity t o  try any o f  what have
become recognised classics in adventure
circles - The Zork Adventures.
Zork has quite a fascinating history and
was originally written to run on a Digital
Corporation PDP 10. It eventually grew to
such a size that it evens stretched the
megabyte capacity of that! All this took
place in the pre-history of  the mk r o
computer as we know it -  back in the
1970's!
Zork -  as it was then -  was shrunk
somewhat to suit the meagre capacity of
the 51/
both the Apple II and the IRS 80 and,
much later, the Commodore 64. Even with
judicious shrinking Zork was too large to
accommodate as one program and was
split i n t o  separate s elf-c ontained
adventures. These ar e link ed b y  a
common theme and Zorks I, II and III are
now marketed under the Commodore
label, although they still come under the
original Infocom copyright.
Zork games are disc based and load in
additional data from disc as the adventure
progresses. Initially, you may wait a few
seconds as it loads this data relevant to
new locations but, data is accessed in
relatively small doses so the occasional
response lag is acceptably short. This
system, of course, means that you have an
adventure that, in size, greatly exceeds
the available memory capacity of your
computer. This in turn allows for the
breadth of descriptive location texts that
have inﬂuenced such British market
leaders as Level Nine,
The marks of the infocom adventure
games of which the Zork trilogy are only a
part (others for the Commodore 64 are
'Suspended', 'Starcross' and 'Deadline' -
all marketed under the Commodore
label) are the highly descriptive prose, at
present text only, and the ability of the
command interpreter to deal with what,
for adventure games, is  a  relatively
complex sentence, for example: DROP
ALL BUT THE KNIFE AND THE LAMP.
Although this undoubtedly makes many
actions easier (TAKE ALL), it also could
add gr eatly  t o  t h e  c hallenge o f
communication! The ﬁrst time I played
Zork I, I had some difﬁculty in passing the
Troll -  mainly because I was trying to be
too clever and overlooked the more
direct approach.
As with most adventures, mapping is
particularly important w ith t h e  Lor k
trilogy, especially in the initial stages in
Zork I as you wander outside a boarded
up white house. This is a maze of sorts
and, although, y ou ar e unlikely t o
become irretrievably lost -  use your
pencil and paper.
These adventures display one attribute
I've never been terribly keen on - what I
call the 'twisty passage syndrome' where
going west after travelling east, all too
often, does not return you to the original
starting place! This trick does sometimes
seem t o be used for confusion's sake
rather than for the game's sake.
If you have never tried Zork - at least
chat up your local computer shop to run it
up for you; it is a classic and the leaﬂet you
can ﬁnd at the ﬁrst location in Zork I is
quite right when it says "Welcome to Zork
- No computer should be without one"!
Zork has a number of commands, such
as VERBOSE -  you get the full literary
treatment with each location description.
Alternatively, you can have BRIEF, which
is the shortened form which you usually
see on returning to a location you have
already visited. Or, if you really want it
short and sweet -  SUPERBRIEF -  where
you just get a one or two word description
of where you are. You may even pose
certain questions by using WHERE IS o r
WHAT IS Y o u  may not always get a
satisfying answer but it's nice to have the
unusual option of being able to ask the
computer something.
You may ﬁght some of the creatures
you meet on your travels although most, if
not all, will ﬁght back if they are able to.
You may DIAGNOSE to check on your
present health and this will also tell you
how many turns you need to return to
perfect ﬁtness if you have been wounded!
Disc versions only for Zork but, if you
have a disc unit, treat it to one of these
it (and you) won't regret it!

and retrieve machine code programs with
surprising ease and efﬁciency.

game from the Epyx Stable. The plot is that

EXMON incorporates all the usual
features, an easy t o  use assembler/di-
assembler, extensive memor y  a n d
internal register editing facilities along
with a host of commands which will make
light work of moving, saving, loading and
verifying large chunks o f  code. A n
impressive array of I/O  commands are
available which will enable simple printer
formatting, reading a n d  wr iting t o
speciﬁc disc blocks along with other
versatile disc and tape management
facilities.
Apart from the usual facilities one
would expect from a good monitor, this
one includes several gems which make it
stand out: for example, there is a 'HUNT'
command w hic h w i l l  search f o r  a
speciﬁed character string displaying its
secret weapon and it is up to you to stop
the station from crumbling any further.
The menu allows you to choose which
game variation you wish your Jumpman to
start at. It also allows you to choose how
many players are going to try to save the
station. It is possible to select the speed
of your Jumpman before you enter a
level. The game levels are split into 3
sets, the beginners, the intermediate, and
the advanced levels. As with one of Epyx's
other games, Breakdance, you can select
the grand loop which will take y ou
through all the 30 levels (if you make it), or
they hav e another category c alled
Randomizer which will randomly choose
memory address w h e n  f o u n d .  A
calculator facility is another nice touch
which will add and subtract hex numbers,
convert hex numbers into decimal or vice
versa, and even calculates hex offset
values f o r  t h e  us e o f  br anc hing
instructions all of which are most useful
for those who, lik e me, have mental
blackouts t r y i n g  t o  m a n ip u la t e

All in all EXMON is a quality piece of
software w hic h has  been designed
primarily to meet the needs and demands
of the serious machine code programmer,
yet retaining the ease of use which will
enable the less experienced programmer
to exercise far greater ﬂexibility and
control when using machine code.

a screen for you to play. If your Jumpman
achieves a high-score, then it is recorded
along with any bonus that you might have
picked up on the way. When playing the
game I found that when I jumped from
one place to another (instead of falling to
my death), if I only touched the corner of
it, I could hold onto the ladder or walkway
by pushing my  joystick up. The other
obstacles to keep in mind are the bullets
which just ﬂoat across the screen until
they are in line with you and on other
screens, robots or vampire bats! I thought
it was an easy game to grasp and the
graphics/sound were good.

Raid on Bungeling Bay
Arioiasoft
E9.95 (cassette); E12.95 (disc)
CBM 64 (joystick)
For those of us not fortunate
enough to be invited to the
launch o f  Ariolasoft at  the
Hippodrome in London, there
still remains the pleasure of
purchasing their games. Raid
on Bungeling Bay falls into the
second category.
The plot you may have
heard before, you are the last
resort etc etc, and must pilot a
powerful and highly manoeuv-
erable helicraft and bomb and
destroy six factories which are
scattered throughout an Island
complex. You start out with 5
Cadcam Warrior
Taskset
0.95 (cassette) 0195 (disc)
CBM 64 + io tick
THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WITH CAD-
cam Warrior was that it took longer to
read the manual than it did to load the
game! Whilst it was loading, (using a
fastloader), the background to the game
was revealed in a short story which was in
the manual. You are Marsh and in control
of an android called MAD-2, The task set
lives plus one aircraft carrier
from which you operate, lose
this and the game becomes
very hard indeed, as you then
have nowhere to repair or re-
arm.
As you eventually destroy
the factories the opposition
hots up, there is only one game
level but as you get better the
game gets tougher. Defending
the enemy positions against
your attack are robot tanks,
anti-aircraft guns, ﬁghter
aircraft and bombers -  and
while you're off bombing and
wreaking havoc the enemy is
secretly building a battle ship
and trying to sink your Aircraft
carrier, all good clean fun!
The main battle area is
spread over 100 screens which
feature wrap around, so if you
ﬂy off the left hand edge you
will re-appear o n  t he right
hand side, with a similar effect
operating north and south. You
view the whole game from
above your helicraft and, to
complete the display, there is
the mandatory radar screen
with the accompanying score
and lives remaining running
across the bottom.
Graphically t h e game is
superb with great detail paid to
everything, brilliant buildings
and airstrips on the islands and
silky smooth scrolling in every
direction. The sound is of the
usual 'zap pow' variety found
in this type of game, nothing
new, just well done.
In play, your helicraft takes
some getting used to but can
be c ontrolled f r o m  either
keyboard or joystick, my own
preference being a combina-
for your droid is to push back into place a
P.C.B. which has become dislodged inside
the Enviro generator. The only problem is
that the internal defence mechanisms are
on guard to stop any unauthorised access
(even by it's own droic1). The only other
obstacle in this game are the 8192 screens
which could be used throughout.
The game is designed in such a way
that if you clear a screen of enemies, a
choice of screens is displayed. The manual
suggests that while playing the game
it is worth making a map. I would also
suggest roping in a stray friend to draw
a map while y ou g o  zapping every
creature. The game is made easier with
tion of both, direction via the
joystick and weapon control
from the keyboard.
So far my best effort is 4
factories destroyed but even
with this I still didn't manage to
catch sight of the high score
table that the blurb tells you
will appear if your score is high
enough, whether this is a bug
or just my poor scoring only
further play will tell.
My review copy arrived on
disc but I'm reliably informed
that a turbo load tape will be
available when the game is
released early in '85, If, like me,
you want more than space
invaders or Manic Miners then
this game has it all, a must for all
wargamers, highly recom-
mended.
the inclusion of a colour coded strip on
the side of every screen. This will indicate
how to get through the particular screen
on which you are operating. As if that is
not enough, on various screens you will
also ﬁnd items which can be picked up;
in some cases these will ﬁnish a screen.
Finally, the graphics on this game are
up to the usual high standard that I have
come to expect from Tasket; the sound is
good and the game content enormous.
But, I  somehow feel that having 8192
different screens is just a little too much.
Still y ou cannot complain about not
getting value for money!

Fig ter Pi ot
Digital integration
£9.95 (cassette)/E14.95 (disc)
CBM 64 (keyboard and/or ioystick)
AFTER A  VERY SLOW START, FLIGHT
simulator programs are appearing thick
and fast for most micros, the Commodore
64 being no exception. One of the latest
to appear is Fighter Pilot from Digital
Integration. The program is claimed to be
a 'real-time simulation of the F-15 Eagle'
offering 'stunning 3 D  graphics, f u ll
aerobatic performance, air to air combat'
and many  other  tempting simulator
characteristics.
This all adds up to quite a claim so does
the program live up to expectations? After
the title page you are given a menu which
gives you six ﬂying options and a pilot
rating. The 'landing practice' option is
particularly useful as reuniting a hairy F-15
with the ground is not something that
comes easily.
The best option though, and this is
what the program is really all about, is the
air-to-air combat option. You commence
your mission from base by blasting off
from the runway with the re-heat turned
on and in no time you are at 30,000 feet
and homing onto your ﬁrst target. This is
no problem as your radar and other
instruments guide you t o  the quarry.
Providing you are within a mile of the
target aircraft and at roughly the same
altitude the enemy will appear in the
cockpit window and then you let him
have it. I felt a slight tinge of remorse as
the enemy aircraft_ looks very much like
the Avro Vulcan, one of my  all-time
favourite aircraft. It's n o  good being
nostalgic though as he packs a hefty
wallop. If you don't get him he'll get you
or go on to bomb all of your airﬁelds so
you will be unable to land again!
The pr oblem w i t h  s ome ﬂight
simulator programs is that the aircraft
response to the keyboard and joystick is
decidedly sluggish. Not so with Fighter
Pilot. The response is immediate and this
adds to the realism of the program. Fine
adjustments to the aircraft's attitude are
easy and instantaneous. This is backed up
by the graphics which really are excellent.
Sound is adequate and is mostly limited to
the sound of the jet engines and your
• cannons ﬁring.
Inevitably, ﬂight simulators demand
the use of a large number of keys for the
various aircraft functions, in addition to
the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT movement
of t h e  joystick. Fighter Pilot is  n o
exception although in ﬂight only two
or three are really needed in addition to
the joystick. However, to get the full
enjoyment from the program, as with all
ﬂight simulator-type programs, some
knowledge o f  the principles o f  ﬂight
would b e  helpful a n d  considerable
practice is needed to master the various
keys and their uses. Therefore, I doubt if
this will appeal to the younger fraternity
who have been weaned on shoot-em-
ups. Nevertheless, it is well worth the
effort in trying to master and it's one you'll
return to more than most. Shame about
the Vulcan though!
I used the disc version which took
about 11/2 minutes to load so, unless the
cassette version is a 'turbo-load', it would
probably take about 15 minutes to run-in
The disc came in a very nice protective
wallet but it does cost 15 more than the

Castle of Terror
Melbourne House

FROM THE SOFTWARE COMPANY THAT
gave us 'The Hobbit' comes this graphical
adventure. Castle of Terror is set in the
1800s, in a village near a large castle -
home o f  a  secretive Count; sounds
familiar?
As you wander around the village,
information concerning the Castle and its
owner can be obtained by talking to the
villagers, i f  y ou talk  t o  them nicely.
Various objects to help you in your quest
can also be found in and around the
village, but they are not always obvious.
The graphics are very good and are
drawn quite quickly, 4 or 5 seconds in
most cases, which is just as well as the
pictures are drawn for each location you
visit, b e  i t  for  the 1st or  21st time.
Throughout the adventure, suitably eerie
music is played, changing to suit the
mood o f  your present location. Many
adventurers may ﬁnd the continuous
music off-putting or monotonous, but
felt that it complemented the game quite
well.
Text input and acceptance is on a par
with 'The Hobbit' and in general is quite
user friendly. A  'help' command is
available but so far I have not found any
real help from this source. Time will tell.
The program loads in 41/4 minutes, but
further sections have to be loaded as you
progress through t h e  adventure, n o
doubt owing to the complexity of the
program. I can heartily recommend this to
new or seasoned adventurers alike.

WHEN YOU'RE NOT SPEND-
ing long hours slaving over a
hot keyboard and joystick, do
any of you out there go to the
cinema? You do remember the
cinema don't you? It used to be
popular before computers. If
you do remember then you
might have seen Death Race
2000; Bur nin Rubber f r o m
Audiogenic is  t h e  veritable
game of the ﬁlm.
According t o  Audiogenic
you're a n  entr ant i n  t h e
Intergalactic f o u r  seasons
death rac e w it h  t h e  s ole
objective of running as many
other cars as possible off the
track, (makes a change from
Pole Position). T her e a r e
various different types of other
entrants, most of which can be
dispensed w i t h  reasonably
easily, a l l  e x c e p t  t h e
indestructible tank cars, these
should be avoided!
To help you add t o  the
carnage and get out of tricky
situations, your super car is
able to ﬂy for a limited period
when speeding in excess o f
100MPI-1_ I needed to do this on
numerous occasions to avoid
the tracks obstructions which
appear fr om time t o  time,
completing a  round enables
you t o pass o n  t o  the next
season. Scoring is by destroying
everybody else on the track,
the bigger the opposition the
higher the score, with a bonus
feature i f  y o u  manage t o
complete a  w h o le  r ound.
There ar e supposedly more
than 32 different tracks to try
out b u t  only  t h e  ﬁrst 1 6
available.from the start.
The graphics ar e g o o d
without being brilliant: t h e
ﬂying car is particularly good.
Sound and music are also done
well with the added advantage
that you can toggle the sound
on and off with the f5 key. The
car is controlled by keyboard
or joystick with the latter being
by far the best bet. A high score
table is included for those who
want to record their efforts, as
is a two player option (one after
another, not simultaneously).
My only  moan with this
game was  t h e  lo n g  w a it
between using the high score
table and starting the next
game, made worse b y  the
terrible addictiveness o f  the
game itself. I reviewed Burnin
Rubber ov er  t h e  Christmas

was still trying to get a higher
score than m y  brother a t
1.30a.m. Boxing day morning.
Deﬁnitely  o n e  f o r  t h e
collection.
ALTHOUGH THE PLAYER IS
instructed t o  follow the o n
screen instructions, I had t o
refer to the manual since there
was a distinct lack of 'on screen
instructions'.
This 'Flight Simulator' has 3
levels. Level 1 is  'Flight #  1
Autosimulator', whereby you
carry out an abbreviated space
mission where most o f  the
operations a r e  c omputer
controlled. Level 2 is 'Flight # 2
Simulator', whereby you have a
little mo r e  control o f  t h e
system and level 3 is 'Flight # 3
STS 101 ', which is a fully ﬂedged
Shuttle Flight.
You are supplied with a'
function key overlay card since
the simulator requires use of
the keyboard as well as the
joystick. The joystick and ﬁre
button control many functions,
including the movement in any
direction i n  s pac e. T h e
keyboard t a k e s  c a r e  o f
functions such as cargo door
operation, l a n d i n g  g e a r
operation, engine cut off etc.
The s i m u l a t i o n  g o e s
through many stages includ-
ing lift off, stabilizing orbit,
satellite docking, de-orbit, re-
entry and landing.
The ﬁrst thing you must do
is to select which simulation
ﬂight you require (1, 2 or 3 as
described above), The display
screen throughout consists of
the dash board controls to the
bottom half of the screen with a
view of the front outside of the
shuttle through the windows
above the controls. On lift off,
the shuttle shakes under the
force of the craft leaving the
gravitational pull of the Earth
and t h e  v iew through t h e
window changes colour until
you have established orbit. In
orbit, the deep blue of space is
speckled with star constellat-
ions (many can be recognised),
whilst t h e  Earth scrolls jus t
under t h e  e d g e  o f  y o u r
window. Space ﬂight can be
left, r ight  (sorry, p o r t  o r
s tar boar d) , u p ,  d o w n , .
backwards or forwards.
When a Satellite is spotted,
you must dock with it as many
times as possible. Throughout
all operations, y ou can see
exactly wher e y o u  a r e  i n
relation to the satellite by way
of reference to the tracking
devices on your control pank
The game was infuriating
since I never managed on ﬂight
3, to dock with the satellite or
land back o n  Earth. I  shall,
however, r e t u r n  t o  t h is
program time and time again
until I  have gained some
degree of skill. As the manual
states
practice t o  c o m p le t e  a
successful mission. But if it was
too easy then I should have got
bored with it from the start.
Overall the program had
good graphics and s ound,
good use of the joystick and
keyboard and a good manual
(which must be studied whilst
you are running the program
for i t  t o  make sense). O ne
useful facility is a pause key
which freezes the program so
that you may refer t o the
manual.

THE INITIAL SCREEN SHOWS
a helicopter waiting at base on
the launc h p a d  w i t h  a n
American ﬂag clearly ﬂapping
in the breeze on top of HQ.
Pressing the ﬁre button starts
the action in which you have 3
lives (clever, because the guys
on 'Airwolf' seem t o  have
hundreds).
Your mission is to rescue
hostages locked in  barracks.
There are 16 hostages for each
hut and a total of 64 hostages in
all. Your chopper can carry a
maximum of 16 men. So, off
you g o  into the wild blue
yonder c o n t r o llin g  y o u r
helicopter in all directions.
The ﬁrst hut has been blown
open for you and, 'as you ﬂy
across t h e  countryside and
allowing four players to join in. There's
also a jostle facility which will turn into a
tile if you use it too much. Did I hear you
ask what a tilt is? Naturally there are loads
of bonus points to be mopped up for
hitting all the right bits and pieces and a
collector in the top of the screen which
hands out bonuses as well as giving you
the chance of a three ball game if you get
three in it. But, let's face it, it's nothing
really grand and not a patch on the real
McCoy. 
K

M
.
over the huts, you can see the
little hostages breaking free,
running in the direction of the
helicopter and waving to you.
You must land and let these
idiots on board as quickly as
possible. They must be idiots,
since whilst you are trying to
land to rescue them, you have
to contend w it h  tanks, je t
ﬁghters and drone air mines (of
the homing variety) and all
these little men can do is run
into the line of ﬁre and get shot
at in  mid wave. The attacks
from each of the enemy are
progressive commencing with
just the tanks, then tanks and
jets and then the drone air
mines as well. These little guys
can certainly sprint t o  y ou
when they want. If t hey are
shot by  the enemy o r  y ou
unfortunately land on them,
they b e c o m e  dec eas ed
hostages.
You can shoot down enemy
aircraft and drone mines in mid
ﬂight, but to bomb the tanks
you must ﬁrst go into tank
mode which is via a medium
press of the joystick ﬁre button.
A short press on this shoots or
drops bombs (when in  tank
mode) whilst a long press turns
your chopper through 180
degrees.
When your helicopter is full
of men, o r  when the need
arises, you can return to HQ to
drop them off so that you may
go back to rescue more men.
The instructions refer to HQ as
the Post Ofﬁce. Perhaps you
are dropping these men off to
buy some stamps or some 'Get
Out Soon' cards for their, as yet
unrescued, pals. O r  is it that
Post Ofﬁces hide a  deeper
secret i n  America than w e
realise?
The game looks simple, but
is not. It is very addictive and
incorporates a random facility
of attack, i.e. you don't know
when or where the enemy are
coming from. The game can be
quite different each time it is
played and there is always that
element o f  surprise against
you. As your whirlbird's blades
rotate, there are accompanying
sound effects. It is very amusing
when you drop men off at HQ
and they wave goodbye to you.
Perhaps the sound effects of a
cheer or two at this stage (if it
were possible) would have had
me rolling about at these ant
like ﬁgures antics,
The 3D type graphics are
simple but extremely colourful
and very good. I  found the
instructions on the packaging
very clear and easy to follow
and the game was a pleasure to
get into. Deﬁnitely for all age
groups. Practice makes perfect
with this game to a certain
extent, together with a small
amount of luck. I did ﬁnd that
each time I played, I became
involved in  the action in as
much as I  was part o f  the
screen. I  was there with the
men being rescued and their
actions wer e realistic: they
seemed to have minds of their
own.

YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM, BOOK, POP
video, LP and T-shirt -  now play the
computer game. Activision have been
able to make the most of the ﬁlm's current
popularity by bringing their Ghostbusters
same out simulataneously with t h e
cinema release, but it would have been
worth waiting for in any case.
The game i s  turbo-loaded i n  a
remarkably short time considering the
amount of data it must require. Once
you've got it in, you're treated to a superb
title screen featuring the Ghostbusters
logo and a  synthesised voice saying
'Ghostbusters', followed by an eerie, evil
cackle of laughter. If you wait instead of
pressing the start key, the program they
plays the entire theme tune, in three
there are some other characters in this
game who are out to stop you. The main
opponent is Killerwatt, who will follow
you around until either he gets you, or
you make him fall off the circuit board by
jumping onto a  teleport pad; he,not
being a very bright spark, will try to
follow you.
There are other characters in this game
such as Nohm and ﬂash who will also do
things to you if you're caught. The board
works in such a way that when you tread
on a square, a piece of circuitry appears.
On the later levels Edison will have to
tread on each square more times to make
more circuits, At the beginning of each
level a short demonstration is shown on
voices, together with scrolling lyrics and a
little singalong bouncing ball. This alone
is almost worth the price of the game.
The actual game presumes that
business is so good, the Ghostbusters are
offering franchises. The bank lends you
[10,000 and you start by spending it on
your Ghostbusting equipment -  choose
carefully because you can't afford
everything. Which is better, a  Ghost
Vacuum or a PK detector, a roomy slow
estate car or a souped-up vehicle that
carries less? How many Ghost traps should
you purchase? Several games should help
you decide the right priorities.
Once you're equipped, you drive
around the city to haunted buildings
attempting to manoeuvre the Slimers into
your Ghost traps with your protom lances.
(See the ﬁlm - it'll all make sense then!)
The faster you catch the ghosts, the more
money you earn and the slower the city's
PK (psychod-kinetic) energy level rises.
Other ghosts are ﬂocking to the Temple
of Zuul, ever faster with rising PK, and
the screen. The facilities supplied with
the game include a level selector (up to
level 6), a pause button, and game options
which allow the selection o f  which
enemies you require. if any.
The graphics are good although the
sprite d et ails co u ld  h a v e  b een
mutlicolour and the sound was a little too
basic. B u t  f o r  m e ,  t h e  positives
outweighed the negatives. It is also worth
noting that there are bonus screens in the
game which will boost your score by 2000
points if you manage to complete them by
connecting one side of the circuit to the
other in as short a time as possible.
towards the end of this phase you need to
use your Ghost bait carefully to prevent
the gian Stay-Puft Marshmallow man
laying waste to city blocks.
If you complete the ﬁrst phase earning
more money than you started the game
with, you pass to phase 2 where you have
to sneak at least two of your men into the
Temple of Zuul past Mr. Stay-Puft. I
haven't managed to do this yet, but I'm
told the ending echoes the ﬁlm fairly
faithfully.
The game is a  lo t  o f  fun, and
impressively programmed (the theme
tune plays throughout, the graphics are
good and there is another piece o f
synthesised speech). Remember that the
realistic-sounding speech is done using
only the basic 64 sound chip ﬁlters: no
additional hardware is required. A round
of applause for the programmers, please.
Recommended, even though you
don't get a free Sigourney Weaver with
every cassette.

IF YOU FANCY PLAYING A  RELAXED
game of cricket during those months of
the year when the weather is doing it's
utmost to re-create the ice age, then this
program is for you. Simulating a 60 Over
Match, it has all the features you would
expect in a real match. Fast, medium and
slow bowlers , scoreboard, bow ling
averages; it's all here. The game can be
played by one or two players, but even at
'Village Green' level the computer proves
to be a worthy opponent - rarely missing
catches and never delivering a no-ball.
You can choose to name your own
teams or play an England v The World
match. Naming your own teams revealed
a bug which prevented the teams having
names longer than one character.
In play, the bowler is moved to left or
right and the speed of his delivery varied.
When he makes his delivery, the screen
scrolls to bring the batsman into view. The
batsman must be positioned to hit the
ball, adjusting his bat to place the shot.
Once the ball is hit (or missed) the view
changes to an overhead picture of the
ﬁeld. The ﬁelding team can freeze the
action while a  convenient ﬁelder is
chosen to intercept the ball.
The graphics are adequate although
sound is virtually non-existent, limited to
a simulation of the hallowed thwack of
wood on leather. The pace of the game is

otherwise they are computer controlled.
Occasionally one of the slabs disappears,

What a silly scenario, and what a

Silicon Warrior is a variant of the well-

Snake Bite

VIC 20 Unnexpanded
SNAKE BITE IS BASED ON ONE OF THE
earliest computer games written. I once
played a version of this on an 8K Pet about
four years ago. Those were the days.
SNAKE BITE
This is a fairly good version of the game
for the VIC. You control a snake which
slithers about the screen eating various
goodies. These come in the form of bugs,
apples and grapes. As you eat, the snake
grows. The longer it becomes, the harder
it is to avoid its own tail. If it hits the tail
the game is over. The game also ends if
you hit a deadly mushroom or the screen
border.
If you manage to clear a screen, more
bugs and fruit appears. Your snake stays
the same size and the game becomes very
hard to play.
The game is not very original but is still
quite playable_ The graphics are clear and
the movement o f  the snake is very
convincing. Sound is fairly ordinary but
adequate.
The most annoying feature of  the
game is having to type in the skill level at
the start of each game. The screen prompt
asks you for a number between one and
ﬁve but only one, three and ﬁve are
accepted,
As I said, it's not a bad version of the
game. However, I've seen quite a few
listings in magazines for this type of game,
typing one in is probably better value than
buying this one. It is a pity software houses
can't think up and produce some new
original games instead of churning out
ancient copies of games like this.

loading, you are treated to a
title page display accompanied
by the tune of Gilbert and
Sullivan's 'A Policemans lot is
not a happy one'. !do not know
what the signiﬁcance of this is,
but it beats staring at a blank
silent screen.
Once t h e  program i s
loaded, you have to select your
game and level of play. There
are 3 levels to this game with
each level having 2 games (i.e. a
choice of 1 player or 2 players).
The display appears to be a
desert with mountains and
moving clouds in the distance
and never alters throughout
suddenly ﬁnd yourself in an oven and this
is where the game begins.
You must pick u p  a  droplet o f
condensation from a pipe at the top of the
screen. Then you have to take it down
towards the ﬂames at the bottom of the
screen and drop it, putting out a ﬂame.
Once all the ﬂames are out you get moved
into a new oven where you have to repeat
this process. There are ten different ovens
in all and you can play any of the ﬁrst ﬁve.
To stop you on your quest for survival
are some strange nasties. These come in
the form of food debris, oven foam and a

the game. The track scrolls
towards you as you move and
may twist and turn in either
direction. The track border is
made up of haystacks and is
quite narrow. You may move
the biker along the track only.
The mountains never get any
closer. A change of scenery or
variation in track layout would
have made this game more
interesting.
At l e v e l  1  y o u  h ave
automatic transmission and no
timer, whilst at level 2 you have
a starter to wave a starting ﬂag
at you, a timer and manual
transmission. Level 3  is the
same as level 2 ,  but with
computer bikes to race against.
You score 1000 points for every
computer b i k e  t h at  yo u
overtake, but lose 250 every
time you are overtaken. The
laps required to complete each
level are 3, 5 and 7 respectively.
Points are scored for every
haystack passed but this varies
depending on the gear you are
in (transmission, not denims or
leathers).
Whilst all this is going on,
your bike's instruments are
displayed at the top of the
screen-speedometer, f u el
gauge etc). I though this was a
nice touch, but was so busy
watching where I was going
that I didn't have time to even
have the occasional glance at
the instruments. I f  I  had, I
wouldn't have been able to
make use of the information, so
it appears obvious that this has
just been put on screen to ﬁll
up space and give a little more
authenticity to the program.
The growl of the motorbike
is good and changes as you
change g e a r .  Ev e n  t h e
computer bikes are noisy and it
is a different growl t o your
bike. Their noise varies as they
pass you and as you pass them.
Obviously a hot dogl
It's not a bad idea for a game but it just
does not seem to work. I found control of
the octupus very difﬁcult. The hazards
were hard to avoid as all movement was
very fast. Probably too fast, well for me
anyway. Graphics are all in multicolour
and frankly, pretty awful. Sound was
nothing much either.
Although there are ten ovens they just
don't seem to be much different. Still they
are quite good for the unexpanded VIC. I
wish Software Projects could have used a
bit more memory and enhanced the game
play. It's a good idea for a game but has
not been written very well. I advise you to
see it before you buy.
P.R.
If you are a  high score
fanatic then this program is for
you since practice will make
perfect, but I found the game
boring.
If you hit a haystack or a
computer biker, you bounce
across the track. You have to
remount a n d  continue.
Perhaps the computer bikers
have stabilizers ﬁtted since
they never fall off even when
you c r a s h  i n t o  t h e m .
Occasionally I  got stuck
behind one of the so called
haystacks and either could not
get back on the track or slipped
about f o r some 2 0  t o  30
seconds. I  found the gear
changing to be poor and at
times non-responsive. The
biker is more like a granny on
a BMX.

This game, I'm afraid, is
neither a gas nor an exciting
one at that. The aim is to pilot
your anti-matt saucer avoiding
passing aircraft and clouds
while annihilating the goodly

their extremely well-trained

It is a pity that the game falls
ﬂat in a number of minor ways
but the inlay card assures us
that the company's policy is
one of constant improvement.
Sticking t o that policy could
make Lunattack a good game.
The sound and graphics are

Use of the joystick, while
optional, i s  preferable t o

if you hope to gain a free toilet

Brian Rushby's machine code
monitor for the Commodore
16 should facilitate the
production and de-bugging
of machine code programs on
Commodorlinew machine
THE COMMODORE 16 INCORPORATES
a powerful single pass assembleridis-
assembler/machine co d e monitor,
designed for the convenient production
and de-bugging of programs written in
6502 (7501) machine code. The only
problem is that, apart from a  short
description on how to enter the monitor
(including a reference to a non-existent
section) the manual does not say how to
take advantage of this very useful facility.
This article will explain the built in
facilities.
TEDMON can b e called either by
typing MONITOR (or M  shift 0) then
RETURN or by pressing the RESET button
whilst holding down the RUN/STOP key.
The monitor commands are listed and
described below in alphabetical order. If
at any time the computer locks just press
the RESET button and you will recover
with your machine code program still
intact.
Entering commands
Commands can be entered immediately
on entering the monitor. Any mistakes
will be highlighted with a question mark.
Standard convention is used in this article
as described below.
14$$ =  hexadecimal address.
nnnn hexadecimal number.
XXXX = decimal number.
< >  = optional information.
<  >  = mandatory information.
The number of digits must be entered as
stated (e.g. nn means two hex digits).
Command explanations
(1) Assemble
Assemble allows t h e entry o f  6502
instructions which are directly translated
into machine code. The monitor detects
syntax errors and any branch out of range
errors. Any mistakes will be highlighted
with a ? and the instruction will not be
E
8 2
line of code the monitor will prompt with
the next available memory address on the
next line (comparable with the AUTO line
numbering in BASIC). All values must be
preceded by a $ sign in the normal way for
TEDMON
hexadecimal notation, also all numeric
values must be preceded by a #
Syntax: A $$$$(coperand)
The operand is essential as outlined
above <  >  (you must state which
instruction to enter at memory location
SSW.
Example: A 2800 IDA # $00
This instruction will enter the start of
your machine code program at memory
location $2800 Hex (10240 decimal). The
screen will then look like this:
A 2800 A9 00 LDA # $00
A 2802
The memory location $2802 is the next
available; just type in the next operand
and continue like this to the end of your
program.
(2) Compare
This command allows the comparison of
two sections of memory. The differences
are reported in the form of memory
location. When the two sections are
identical nothing is reported.
Syntax: C  S U S  $$SS
Example: C 0000 0100 0200
Where,
Address 1= start of 1st section of memory.
(e.g $0000)
Address 2 = end of 1st section of memory.
(e.g $0100)
Address 3  =  start o f  2nd section of
memory_
(e.g $0200)
(3) Disassemble
This command translates existing
machine code back to assembler, the
reverse of assemble. Output will be ??? if
the monitor encounters undeﬁned bytes
(e.g lists o r  tables). Corrections o r
amendments can be entered directly on
top of mnemonics.
Syntax: D ( $ $ $ S i
Example: D 0100
If this example, where only the ﬁrst
parameter is declared, a disassembly will
be provided starting at memory location
$0100 upwards for a  screen full (21
memory locations).
Example: D 0100 0200
This example w ill g ive a  full
disassembly from memory locations $0100
to $0200.

IS U t i l i t y
(4) F ill
This command allows the programmer to
set a complete block of memory to zero or
any other value.
Syntax: F $$$$ $$$$ nn
Example: F 2800 2A00 00
This will set all memory locations between
$2800 and $2A00 to zero.
(5) G o
Used to start execution of machine code
program.
Syntax: G ($$SS)
Example: G
Start execution o f  m/c  program from
memory location already i n  program
CO unter.
Example: G 2A00
Start execution at memory location $2A00
Your machine code program should
always end with a BRK if passing control
From the monitor. This ensures return to
the monitor after execution.
(6) H unt
This command w ill h u n t  through a
speciﬁed bloc k  o f  memory  f o r  a ll
occurrences of speciﬁed bytes, which can
be declared as a string of hexadecimal
numbers or a character string and can be
up to 40 bytes long. Where a match is
made t h e  memory address w ill b e
displayed.
Syntax:- H 
n
n
 (nn nn nn ....)
or 
H
 $ $ 5 4  '<string >
Example: H 0000 FEFF 42 41 53 49 43
A search between t h e  memor y
locations 0000 and FFFF for the string of
numbers shown. These are the ASCII
code numbers that correspond to the
word BASIC.
Example: H 0000 FFFF 'COMMODORE
A search is made for the character string
COMMODORE
(7) Load
Used to load a program from tape or disc,
Syntax: L"Program name",X
Example: L"PROG",1
Loads a program from tape.
Example: L"PROG",8
Loads a program from disc.
(8) Memor y
This command displays the HEX and ASCII
codes of a speciﬁed block of memory. A
reverse full stop is displayed where the
HEX value does not have a corresponding
ASCII character. Memory contents can be
easily changed in this mode by entering
the new values directly over existing
values (use cursor keys to position over
existing value),
Syntax: M ( $ $ $ $ )
Example: M 2800
This will give a display of 12 screen
lines o f  memory starting a t  memory
location $2800.
Example: M 2800 2A00
This will give a continuous display of
memory from $2800 to $2A00_
(9) Registers
This command will display all the current
contents of the CPU internal registers.
Syntax: R
Using this command will provide a display
as below:
PC
S$S$
SR
nn
AC
nn
XR
nn
YR
nn
SF
nn
Where,
PC = Program counter.
SR = Status register.
AC = Accumulator.
XR = X Index register.
YR = Y Index register.
SP = Stack Pointer.
(10) Save
Allows your program to be saved to either
tape or disc.
Syntax: S"PROG",x,$$$$$$$$
Example: 5"Prog",8,2800,2A00
This will save the program contained
in memory block 2800 to 2A00 to disc
under the name PROC. To save to tape
substitute 1 for 8.
(11) Transfer
one block to another.
Syntax: T $$$$ $$$$ $$$$
Example: T 2800 2900 2A00
This w ill transfer the contents o f
memory locations 2800-2900 to the block
of memory starting at 2A00 (and therefore
ending at 2B00). All branch instructions
will be automatically updated, however
any IMP's or ISR's will need to be updated
manually.
(12) e Xit
Used to return control back to BASIC.
Syntax: X
Memory considerations
The Commodore 16 has 12K o f  free
memory (RAM) for use by BASIC. This
memory occupies addresses $1000 t o
$4000 (4096 to 16384 decimal). There is no
free memory for use by machine code, we
therefore need to release some of the
BASIC memory. This is a simple operation,
all we need to do is to limit the memory
available t o  BASIC by  POKing to the
relevant registers.
First we need to decide how to split the
12K available between BASIC a n d
machine code. If, for example, you wish
to have 7K BASIC and therefore 5K m/c
then the limit to BASIC would now need
to be at memory address $2BFF (11263
decimal). The machine code can now be
entered starting a t  memory location
$2C00 (11264 decimal). We then need to
POKE the new value to the limit to BASIC
registers which are memory locations
$0037 and $0030 (55 and 56 in decimal).
these registers are in low byte-high byte
order as is the normal convention.
The required values can be POKEd
into the registers in immediate mode or in
a BASIC program before loading in the
m/c program, therefore it is best to work
in decimal for this operation as BASIC
does not recognise HEX. Calculate the
values to POKE as follows:
Divide the limit to BASIC memory value
by 256.
E.g VBFF=11263
11263/256 = 43 (remainder=255)
Therefore 43 is the value to be poked
into the high byte limit to BASIC memory
register (56). The value to be POKEd into
the low byte limit t o  BASIC memory
register (55) is  the remainder 255 as
follows.
POKE 55,255:POKE56,43

Ttai of the problems covered
this month in Allen Webb's
series on creating your own
adventure games are i l l
interpreters and data storage.
LAST MONTH I DISCUSSED THE DEVIL-
opment of a scenario and offered some
general hints  o n  h o w  t o  create a
convincing atmosphere. This month I
want to get down to some more practical
problems c onc e r ni ng t h e  a c tu a l
programming of the game. Speciﬁcally, I
will deal with interpreters, more aspects
of data storage and moving about.
The Interpreter
The key portion of any adventure is the
interpreter. This section performs two
functions. First it must split up the input
command and extract the relevant words.
This is called parsing. The early programs
used simply t w o  w o r d ,  v e rb/ noun
commands such as TAKE WHIPPET or EAT
PYTHON. Later programs extended the
interpreter t o  a c c e pt f u l l  phrases.
Probably t h e  m o s t  s ophis tic a te d
interpreter about is that used by Infocom.
This a l l o w s  c o m p l e x  c o m m a n d s
including multiple sub-commands.
Once the command has been parsed,
it is necessary to check the words to see if
all a r e  recognised. Thi s  c a n b e  a
particularly slow process i f written i n
BASIC. Listing 1  gives a  combined
machine c ode  interpreter a nd w or d
editor. Using the  word editor you can
enter the words you want the adventure
to use and then save the interpreter plus
word tables f o r  us e  i n  y our  o w n
adventures. You can have a maximum of
64 verbs, 128 nouns and 64 link words in
the tables. That should be enough for
most games.
This interpreter looks for three words
in any command. Speciﬁcally, it looks for
the ﬁrst, second and last. These are called
the v e r b ,  l i n k  w o r d  a n d  n o u n
respectively. The following examples will
show what I mean.

A zero value means that the command
did n o t  contain t h e  ty pe o f  wor d
concerned, eg, if a single word command
such as LOOK is given, then 978 and 979
will contain zero. I f  a  wor d is  not
recognised, you will get the message... "I
don't understand..." followed by  the
word concerned. Location 981 holds an
error ﬂag. I f  a  command is  rejected
because a word is not recognised, this ﬂag
will be set to 255. The ﬂag is set to zero if
the command is accepted. Lines 176 to 189
show how to use the interpreter. When
you call it, you will see a prompt near the
foot of the screen, You can only input
letters a n d  RETURN e n t e r s  t h e
commands. DEL deletes the previous
letter a n d  "  "  erases t h e  w hole
command. Pressing " * "  will re-enter the
previous c ommand. S o  t h a t  y o u
remember y our last command, i t  is
echoed in white below the input line.
The SAVE OBJECT CODE command
will save the interpreter plus the word
tables. These can be loaded in your own
program by the line:
20 C ﬂ: I F  C=1 THEN LOAD "INTER-
PRETER",8,1
If you use this program, you should
not use the area $C000 to $C800. This is
deliberate t o  enable you t o  use the
routines giv en last month w it h  t h e
interpreter in position.
To use the interpreter in your own
games, the following two lines will be
required:
100 SYS 12*4096: IF PEEK (981)=255
THEN 100
110 VM=P(EK1977):PRV.REEK(979):
NO%=PEEK(978)
I discussed last month the use of
parallel execution t o  speed u p  t h e
program. The relevant verb subroutine is
selected by the simple line
120 ON VE% GOSUB 1000,2000,.., 5000
1000 "LOOK"
2000 "TAKE"
5000 "DROP"
Data storage
Last month I touched on the storage of
text behind the BASIC ROM. Clearly
there is a large amount of other data
which must be stored. Probably the key
set of data used in an adventure is the
location index. Using the examples given
last month, this index is either the location
number (small map) or the co-ordinate
(large map). The following discussion is
most relevant to the small map system.
On the whole, the use of variables or
strings f o r  t h e  storage o f  data i s
inadvisable. The reasons are simple:

i) The use and manipulation of strings can
involve garbage collection an d  it s
attendent delays.
ii) An integer variable uses 2 bytes and a
ﬂoating point variable takes 5 bytes.
iii) Variables steal your space for BASIC.
A better approach is to store data as
simple arrays of single or double bytes
POKEd into some safe area of RAM (eg
behind the KERNAL using the routines
given last month). Each value can then be
accessed simply by PEEKing the value
determined by an offset. This approach is
the machine code type approach and may
make life simpler if you choose to move
from BASIC to assembler. So what data
must we have? The normal information is:
i) Location of objects/people
ii) Movement information
iii) Flags indicating the status of doors etc.
It is possible to envisage three sets of
conditions f o r an y objects i n  a n

represented by a single byte:
i) Object non-existent...byte value is 0
ii) Object in your possession...byte value

iii) Object i n  location...byte value is
location number.
Any commands such as TAKE, LOOK,
INVENTORY, EXAMINE etc. need only
refer to and update this table. Imagine
that you have ON objects, each with a
description OBJ$ in a game. The position
of the objects is in a table starting at
address OT and CL is the current location.
The routine between lines 1000 to 1050 in
listing 2 is an example LOOK routine, and
that between lines 2000-2050 performs
TAKE.

The storage ot movement data is a little
more complex. In effect we want to have
access to two sets of data:
i) Which routes are valid for any given
location.
ii) Where does that route take you.
The usual directions used are the four
cardinal points of the compass, the four
half cardinal points and up and down, in
all t en directions. T h e  number  o f
locations with up or down will normally
be small and can usually be dealt with in
the main program logic. That leaves eight
directions which can be represented by
one byte per location. Let us consider
each bit of a byte to be a direction ﬂag
set means you can go that way, zero
means you can't. Additionally let bit 1
represent northeast etc. The following
examples will show my meaning:

The next step is to ensure that the eight
directions occupy the same positions in
the verb and noun tables, so that north is
1, northeast 2 etc. The routine from lines
400 to 530 in listing 2 shows how to test
valid moves. Line 400 traps commands
such as NORTH, WEST etc. Line 410 traps
commands such as GO NORTH, MOVE
WEST etc. Line 500 checks if the route is
open or closed. The routine assumes that
the location number is in LOC and the
direction table starts at address SA.
Line 520 in the listing updates the array
holding the movement data (starts at
address LOCTAB). Each location entry has
ten bytes, one for each direction. Each
byte contains the number of the location
reached if you move in that direction. For
example, if going east from location 5
takes you to location 10, then the third
byte of the entry for location 5 will contain
10.

t
Irom Dave Crisp.
IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS OR SO
printers have gone from an expensive
luxury to a reasonably priced necessity. It
is now possible to get a very good dot-
matrix printer or one of the lower priced
daisy-wheel printers for less than £200
with careful shopping around. Because of
this reduced cost, word processing
software is beginning to catch on. The
quality of word processing software has
also improved dramatically and it is now
quite reasonable for a business to use a
home computer as a dedicated word
processor.
Disadvantage
The selection o f  w ord processors
currently available range in price from
04.95 to around MO. The only problem
with almost all these, which is due to the
machine rather than the software, is that
you have to do your word processing on a
40 rather than an 80 column screen.
Initially, I continued to use my 80% which
has an 80 column screen with the text
editor which is provided with the Silicon
Ofﬁce. That was until I found a word
processor which is so good that I felt it's
worth putting u p  with a  40 column
display.
One man's meat is another man's
poison and this is particularly true with
word processors. Some people like the
way a wordprocessor manipulates text
and the ease with which it can be done,
other people go for features. It really
depends o n  you and your particular
requirements.
Please bear in mind that my use of a
word processor is mainly for typing out
large pieces of text for articles and so I am
inclined to go for something that allows
me to work fast. Your needs may differ.
Micro Wordcraft
Micro Wordcraft from Dataview is the
baby brother o f  a  successful word
processor on the large Commodores.
The manual goes from square one and
presumes yo u  know  nothing. After
loading the program; a start-up menu
appears. This allows you to set up the
particular disc/tape/printer conﬁgura-

tion that are using. Having made your
choice you move Onto the text editing
screen.
My ﬁrst impression of the page was
that it was messy: the line length and
column number, for example, squeezed
in. The page width defaults to 75 char/line
and you are almost ready to type.
In order t o  enter commands e.g.
centre text, move text and so on, you
press the run/stop key. This moves the
cursor up to the top line so that you can
enter the command you require. Pressing
it again puts you back into edit mode.
Apart from the logical use of the run/stop
key, I had a job remembering which key
did which. For instance, to jump around
the screen y o u  h a d  t o  press t h e
Commodore key and P. I would have
found the J easier to remember. To set a
tab, you using the Commodore and 3 key.
This type of key use does not produce fast
text entry.
Printing out
There is no doubt that Micro Wordcraft is
set up to print with virtually any printer
type you have but setting up page widths,
line spacing, control characters could
have been easier.
It is possible to set up headers and
footers which are printed at the top and
bottom of e h  page.
Mail merge
Wordcraft call their mail merge facility
It is fairly easy to 'use. As with all mail
merge facilities, it enables the user to
merge a ﬁle containing text say, a letter-
with another containing a list of items
say, names and addresses -  for mailshot
purposes, for example.
Sounds bad
Wordcraft really isn't as bad as it seems. It
takes practice. My two main complaints
are the way the page scrolls when typing
in (hard t o  describe) and t h e  way
characters are left o n  the screen t o
indicate which parts are to be underlined,
etc..
Still, it is not too bad and I would be
quite happy to use it if I could not use my
favourite.
Easyscript
I will get hung drawn and quartered for
this but this is possibly the worst word
processor I have ever used Its one saving
grace is that you can switch out of editing
mode to view your page. This means
scrolling over the page but at least you get
a good idea o f  how things will look
printed out.
The manual is as exciting as watching
milk curdle. It leaps about from one thing
to the next and leaves you cold. All the
important things are there - word wrap,
justiﬁcation, commands t o  underline,
embolden etc but when you use them,
you can ﬁnd yourself with what appears to
be a  lis t  o f  unc onnec ted w or ds
surrounded by hieroglyphics.
Printing out
There is a built-in software interface for
parallel printers which works with most
leads, and enables you to get at most of
the features o f  a n Epson M O ,  f o r
example. A  little experimentation is
required in order to obtain italics etc but,
if y ou dig into the manual, all t he
information is  there. RS232 users are
catered for as well and so Easyscript does
score in the printout department.
Retrospect
Again, I have appeared to concentrate on
what I do not like as opposed to what I do
like. There are features which make this
fairly good although not for my own use.
The mail merge is  there and is
comprehensive. Find words, replace
words, etc are all there. Nothing drastic is
missing. Before you buy a word processor
try and ﬁnd somebody with Easyscript, it
should not be too hard, and have a look.
You may like what you see.
Vizawrite
This is the one - the best, the easiest, and
the cleanest. It was so good it made an 80
column screen unimportant. It does all
the things I require of a word processor
and it does them in exactly the way
would choose t o  d o  them i f  I  was
designing a word processor for my own
use. The only thing I would really love
now is the cartridge version.
As far as features go it is much the same
as the other two. Everything is so easy you
barely need a manual. If you want to
delete a  block o f  text you press the
Commodore key and delete, then cursor
over what is to go. If you want to insert
text you press the Commodore key and
insert. If you want to move to a tab region
you press the CTRL key and tab. The
function keys have been used to the full
and with Vizawrite I can blast away and
type text as I think about it without having
to worry about formatting.
See all as you type
You can set the line length where you
want it and type so the screen scrolls with
the cursor or you can change to width
mode. This compresses your text into 40
column mode and means you see all you
type. With two key presses you can revert
to how it will print and be sure all still
looks good.
No squiggles
The nice thing with this is that if you input
a format command, y ou don' t  g e t
squiggles and lines indicating it is there.
Most of the marking is done with text
inversion or colour change. Some care
has to be taken with your choice of screen
colours as some marking may not show.
For instance, if you want to delete text, the
text you move over is  highlighted in
white. If you have chosen white text then,
of course, this will not show up. On a
green screen monitor text colour is even
more important but, if you take the advice
in the manual, all will be OK.
Hardcopy
Printing o u t  i s  easy. Pressing t h e
Commodore key and P takes you to the
printout menu. Here you can toggle on
and o f f  things  s uc h a s  lin e  feed,
justiﬁcation, and so on. You can specify
the c olumn t o  start printing all the
important little things. You can set up the
word processor to send speciﬁc escape
codes to get at particular features of your
printer and the method of doing this has
been improved on later versions.
Favourite
This is my personal favourite-lam using it
to type this article. It is certainly well
worth looking at.
Wordprocessor features
To conclude, the following are some
features which I think all word processors
should include: ﬁnd and replace a word,
block mov e, bloc k  delete, headers,
footers, word wrap, justify, page preview,
wide r a n g e  o f  p r i n t  o p t i o n s ,
mailmerge/f ill, underline, embolden
(printer dependent) ease of use at speed,
save paragraph, load paragraph, set page
colours. I hope this helps you in choosing
a word processor to suit your needs.

to the 6510A. We shall assume, from now on, that these are
understood or at least you know where to look them up. There
are still a few more to come but it is time now for consolidation.
Machine code via BASIC
Apart from masochists and members of MENSA, most of us who
buy home computers start off with BASIC. It is an easy language
to learn and only a few weeks pass before the average beginner is
able to cope with most of the common programming tricks. The
question is, whether or not a preliminary apprenticeship in
BASIC prepares you for tackling machine code later on? Some
purists say no - in fact one or two of them preach that previous
familiarity with BASIC can permanently damage the intellect!
Still, purists are good things to have around providing we don't
always take them as seriously as they take themselves. We must
face the fact that, in the real world (the microcomputing part of it
anyway), the newcomer to machine c ode
in BASIC. In other words, he/she will be constantly trying to ﬁnd
some relation between a BASIC routine and a corresponding
machine code equivalent. It sweetens the pill a little if a gentle
transition t o  machine code is made via a series of BASIC
equivalents. In those which follow, we should point out that:
(a) There may be ways, other than those given, for arranging
the equivalent machine code.
(b) Symbolic operands and labels are used. Suitable absolute
addresses must be chosen, or assigned by an assembler if
you want to try them out.
(c) Single byte numbers are assumed. That is to say, numbers
must be kept within the bounds of +127 or -128 if you use
two's complement working or, in unsigned binary, 255.
Remember that numbers may start within the limits but after
a few machine code steps, the limit may be exceeded.
(d) I f  more than one machine code equivalent is given, they will
be numbered 1, 2, etc.

5 of this series, we can handle larger numbers by using two or
more bytes to handle each number. In machine code, this is
awkward and long-winded rather than difﬁcult The following
BASIC equivalents are using two bytes for a number. It is
assumed that in  memory, they occupy a pair of adjacent
locations labelled, for example, NUMBER and NUMBER+1. The
low-byte in NUMBER and the high-byte in NUMBER+1. We can,
of course, use any other pair of symbolic addresses such as Sand
5+1, or K and Kl.
Incrementing a double byte loop counter:
If a loop is to revolve more than 255 times, we must use a double
byte loop counter. This entails knowing how to increment (or
decrement) a double byte number. Study the following few
lines, which should be visualised as the bottom of a processing
loop. The top of the loop will be at the branch destination label
'BACK'.
INC NUMBER
BNE BACK
INC NUMBER+1
BACK
Assume that NUMBER and NUMBER+1 both start at zero. While
the c ount remains less than 255, only  t h e  low-byte is
incremented because of the BNE branch to BACK. On the 256th
revolution, NUMBER goes over the top to zero again. When this
occurs, the BNE branch is not taken and the high-order byte
NUMBER+1 is incremented. The inner loop revolves 256 times
for each revolution of the outer loop. Since the outer loop can
also revolve 256 times, the total number of revolutions possible
by the combined loop is 256x256 = 65,536. However, if the loop
count is to be some lesser value than this maxima, the locations
NUMBER and NUMBER+1 must ﬁrst be loaded with an offset
value instead of zero.
Adding double byte numbers

two-byte number.

Printing characters
Printing characters on the screen is best carried out by making
use of an operating system routine in the Kernal ROM called
CHROUT, the details of which are as follows:
CHROUT
Function: send character to output channel.
Cali address: $FFD2 (65490 decimal).
Parameter register: Accumulator must contain the character
code before calling the routine.
Preparation routine: if  the character is to be sent to any
peripheral other than the screen, preparation is required by
calls to CHKOUT and OPEN.
BASIC
PRINT "A"
Machine code
LDA # 65
ISR SFFD2
Note: although, for simplicity, we have used an absolute address
for calling the subroutine, we should point out that it is bad
practice. The correct way, of course, is to assign it to a symbolic
address at the top of the program.

M.C. Hart shows you how to
save machine code at the en4
of a BASIC program and then
use an internal ROM routine
to locate it.
ONCE A MACHINE CODE ROUTINE HAS
been written it may be loaded back into its
original position (absolute address) with
the command LO AD  "PROGRAM",
devie number, 1. To activate the routine
one must be aware of the entry point of
the machine code and access it with the
relevant SYS call, Even experienced users
of machine code can still forget the entry
points to their routines and the problem is
confounded if a routine has been written
for use by an inexperienced user.
To ov er c ome thes e pr oblems ,
machine code routines could be written
so that they 'sat' at the end of a normal
BASIC program. This is quite easy t o
achieve by altering the pointers to the
end-of-program (=start-of-variables) s o
that they include the machine code as
well as the BASIC program. For the C-64
(as well as the VIC) these pointers are at
52D-$2E (45-46 decimal). T he BASIC
program could then point to another

it is useful t o  exploit it for our own
purposes. It will handle non-overlapping
moves both forwards and backwards with
no problems and will also move code
down (i.e. later) in memory even with
overlap. It fails if the new code location
overlaps with the existing code location
and is before it in memory, so it is best
avoided in these circumstances.
In order to illustrate the principles
involved, t h e  RE L O CAT E / CO UNT
program reads in the machine code for a
program called COUNT into space after
the BASIC program itself. The BASIC
program starts at $0800 and ends at about
S0B77 (depending on how many spaces
are put in the program) so the code read
in b y  lines  10-30 ( into $0D00 and
following) is well clear. Now a second
piece of code is read in (lines 60-80) and
this is the 'RELOCATOR' code itself —it is
read into SOCOO. There is nothing sacred
about this particular location, however,
and it could equally well have gone into
the cassette buffer ($033C= 828 decimal).
Line 100 calls the RELOCATOR routine
which copies the ﬁrst piece of machine
code fr om $0D00-110D23 into $C000-
$CO23. Lines 120-150 prepare the screen
for what is to follow and the relocated
code is called in Line 160.
I have been deliberately vague about
what COUNT actually does as it is a bit of a
surprise and is well worth watching if only
to illustrate the speed of machine code. It
is not original but is adopted from work
previously published b y  Mik e Gross-
Niklaus. The real problem is  how t o
relocate any piece o f  machine code
rather than this particular demo.

After the RELOCATE call you may insert
your own call to 'turn on' your own
routine if required. You could also NEW
your driver program and return to BASIC
is necessary although this is probably
easier from the BASIC driver. Your BASIC
driver can be as primitive as a single SYS
call to the RELOCATOR routine although,
of course, you would have to ensure that
the end- of program pointers wer e
adjusted as previously described. I use the
TRANSFER command in SUPERMON to
put the code from where it normally
resides to the end of a BASIC driver.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start b u t  can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSIICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better,
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPERSOEI products inoude tne
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!) The VICTREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands; or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer.
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STIX. MANX
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders, But We most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by  calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card.
