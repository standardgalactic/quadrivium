About the Authors
Bass Jobsen lives in Orthen in the Netherlands. Bass tries to combine his interests in web
technology with his compassion for a sustainable lifestyle. He therefore not only owns a
web development company, but is also board member at the Energie Cooperatie 073. In his
spare time, he plays tennis and spends a lot of time with his kids Kiki, Dries, Wolf, and
Helena.
Bass has been programming the web since 1995, ranging from C to PHP. He is always
looking for the most accessible interfaces. He has a special interest in the processes between
designer and programmer. Web interfaces should work independently of devices or
browsers in his opinion. He also works on the accessibility of Bootstrap and his JBST
WordPress starters theme.
Delivering readable and maintainable code is important for his daily job so that's why he
loves CSS preprocessors and other tools that stimulate DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding
in web development. Also, Bootstrap helps him to work faster and make his clients and
users more content.
With over 5 years of experience with Bootstrap, Bass has been actively contributing to the
community with his blogs ( h t t p : / / b a s s j o b s e n . w e b l o g s . f m /) and Git repos ( h t t p s : / / g i t
h u b . c o m / b a s s j o b s e n). He has created sites such as h t t p : / / w w w . s t r e e t a r t . c o m / with
Bootstrap. The newest version of JBST for Bootstrap 4 is already available at h t t p s : / / g i t h u
b . c o m / b a s s j o b s e n / j b s t - 4 - s a s s. He released a CLI for Bootstrap 4 in March 2016 ( h t t p s :
/ / g i t h u b . c o m / b a s s j o b s e n / b o o t s t r a p - c l i).
In the summer of 2016, Bass started teaching programming Scratch for primary school kids
using the Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the edX-platform offered by Delft
University of Technology.
He is also the author of, among others, Sass and Compass Designer's Cookbook with Packt
Publishing and some other books on Less (Leaner CSS).
 
I would also like to thank Smeet and Sachin from Packt for their support and feedback. Last
but not least, the critical and useful reviews of Silvio helped me to right a better book.
Without the support of those wonderful people I could not wrote this book!

David Cochran serves as an Associate Professor of Communication at Oklahoma Wesleyan
University. He has been teaching Interactive Design since 2005. A passion for best practices
induced him to avoid shortcuts and hew towards web standards. When Twitter Bootstrap
was first released in August 2011, he recognized it as a tool that would speed up
development while supporting best practices. Thus, he began folding Bootstrap into his
university courses, much to the benefit of his students. In 2012, David produced a Bootstrap
2.0 tutorial series for webdesign.tutsplus.com. He also published a first short book about
Bootstrap, Twitter Bootstrap Web Development How-To, Packt Publishing.
 
 
 
 
Ian Whitley developed a passion for writing and literature at a young age. In 2010, he
developed a deep interest in web development and decided to get involved in it. When the
opportunity to help write a book on web development came up, it seemed like too good of
an offer to pass up. He was one of the early adopters of Twitter Bootstrap when it was first
released in 2011. With the help of David Cochran, he quickly conquered the system and has
used it for many different web projects. Currently, he uses Bootstrap in relation to
WordPress, using both in conjunction to create custom and creative solutions for his client.
Living in the Bartlesville, OK, Ian is the lead developer for BitBrilliant, the company that
David Cochran founded. He is always looking to further his skills—both for the web and in
the many hobbies he pursues, which include leather working and writing.
 

About the Reviewer
Silvio Moreto is a developer with more than 8 years of experience with frontend
technologies and has created many websites and web applications using the Bootstrap
framework. From simple pages to complex ones, he has always used the Bootstrap
framework. Silvio is also the creator of the bootstrap-select plugin ( h t t p : / / s i l v i o m o r e t o .
g i t h u b . i o / b o o t s t r a p - s e l e c t /), which is a very popular plugin among the community. It
is for replacing a selected element by a Bootstrap button drop-down element. Silvio foresaw
that a plugin such as this one was missing in the original framework, and it could be useful
for the community. Silvio is the writer of the book Bootstrap by Example, published by
Packt Publishing as well. Besides this, he is very active in the open source community,
participating in some open source repository and issue communities, such as Stack
Overflow. Also, he finished third in the worldwide Django Dash 2013 challenge.

Preface
Since its debut in August 2011, Twitter Bootstrap, now simply Bootstrap, has become by far
the most popular framework for empowering and enhancing frontend web design.
With over 5 years of experience with Bootstrap, I'm happy to write this book for you and
share my experience with you. Since Bootstrap helps me to implement best practices for
both CSS and HTML. Bootstrap enables me to work faster and deliver stable results.
Bootstrap definitely made me a better web developer.
With version 4, Bootstrap reaches an exciting new milestone, a lean code base optimized for
modern browsers. Bootstrap enables you to build applications and websites that look good
and work well on all types of devices and screen sizes from a single code base.
Bootstrap is open source and released under the MIT license. It's hosted, developed, and
maintained on GitHub.
This book is a hands-on guide to the inner workings of Bootstrap. In an easy-to-follow, step-
by-step format, you'll experience the power of customizing and recompiling Bootstrap's
Sass files and adapting Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins to design professional user interfaces.
At the end of the day, this book is about something bigger than Bootstrap. Bootstrap is but a
tool—a means to an end. By the end of this book, you will become a more adept and
efficient web designer.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap, teaches us how to download Bootstrap, set up a
site template based on the HTML5 boilerplate, and practice compiling Bootstrap's Sass files
to CSS.
Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp, teaches us how to create a build
process for your Bootstrap projects with Gulp. You can reuse the build process for your
newer projects. The build process compiles your Sass code into CSS code, prepares your
JavaScript code, and runs a static web server to test the results.
Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass, enables us to get a grip on Sass.
You now know how to use Sass to customize Bootstrap's components. You will build a web
page for your web log and apply different strategies to style it with Sass.

Preface
[ 2 ]
Chapter 4, Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme, enables us to take the portfolio design and turn
it into a WordPress theme. We'll start with the excellent JBST 4 Starter Theme and
customize template files, Sass, CSS, and JavaScript to suit our needs.
Chapter 5, Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio, helps us to build a basic portfolio site with a full-
width carousel, three columns of text, and social icons provided by Font
Awesome—customizing Bootstrap's Sass files and adding your own in the process.
Chapter 6, Bootstrappin' Business, shows us how to create a complex banner area, add drop-
down menus and utility navigation, build a complex three-column page layout, and add a
four-column footer, and ensures that all these things remain fully responsive.
Chapter 7, Bootstrappin' E-Commerce, guides us through the design of a products page
capable of managing multiple rows of products in a complex responsive grid. While at it,
we will provide a fully responsive design for options to filter products by category, brand,
and so on.
Chapter 8, Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website, gives a detailed outline of how to
design a beautiful one-page scrolling website with a large welcome message, a grid of
product features with large icons, customer testimony in a masonry layout, and a set of
three thoughtfully designed pricing tables.
Chapter 9, Building an Angular 2 App with Bootstrap, enables you to learn how to set up an
Angular 2 app with Bootstrap 4. At the end, you will be introduced to some other tools to
deploy your projects.
What you need for this book
To complete the exercises in this book, you will need the following software:
A modern web browser
A text or code editor
The NodeJS installed on your system
At the time of writing this book, we were referring to the latest and the
most stable Alpha release from Bootstrap: Alpha 4. Any major updates
will be incorporated after the final release of Bootstrap 4.

Preface

Who this book is for
This book is assumed to be good for readers who are comfortable with handcoding HTML
and CSS and are familiar with the fundamentals of valid HTML5 markup and well-
structured style sheets. Basic familiarity with JavaScript is a bonus, as we will be making
use of Bootstrap's jQuery plugins. We will work a great deal with LESS to customize,
compose, and compile style sheets. Those who are familiar with LESS will gain significant
experience working with the details of Bootstrap's LESS files. Those who are new to LESS
will find this book a reasonably thorough primer.
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds
of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions,
pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Mount
the downloaded WebStorm-10*.dmg disk image file as another disk in your system."
A block of code is set as follows:
.btn-tomato {
 color: white;
 background-color: tomato;
 border-color: white;
}
Any command-line input or output is written as follows:
npm install --global gulp-cli
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for
example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "The shortcuts in this book
are based on the Mac OS X 10.5+ scheme."
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.

Getting Started with Bootstrap
Bootstrap's popularity as a front-end web development framework is easy to understand. It
provides a palette of user-friendly, cross-browser, tested solutions for most standard UI
conventions. Its ready-made, community-tested, combination of HTML markup, CSS styles,
and JavaScript plugins greatly accelerates the task of developing a frontend web interface,
and it yields a pleasing result out of the gate. With the fundamental elements quickly in
place, we can customize the design on top of a solid foundation.
Bootstrap uses Grunt for its CSS and JavaScript build system, and Jekyll for the written
documentation. Grunt is a JavaScript task runner for Node.js. Other tools and technologies
can also be used to build Bootstrap. In this book you will get introduced to some alternative
solutions to build Bootstrap.
But not all that is popular, efficient, and effective is good. Too often, a handy tool can
generate and reinforce bad habits; not so with Bootstrap, at least not necessarily so. Those
who have watched it from the beginning know that its first release and early updates have
occasionally favored pragmatic efficiency over best practices. The fact is that some best
practices, right from semantic markup, to mobile-first design, to performance-optimized
assets, require extra time and effort to implement. In this chapter you will get introduced to
Bootstrap and will learn:
Creating a solid HTML5 markup structure with many current best practices baked-in
Setting up a new Bootstrap project with Bootstrap CLI
Building collapsing content into your project pages
Creating a navbar for page navigation
Turning your navbar into a responsive component

Quantity and quality
If handled well, I will suggest that Bootstrap is a boon for the web development community
in terms of quality as well as efficiency. Since developers are attracted to the web 
development framework, they become part of a coding community that draws them
increasingly into current best practices. From the start, Bootstrap has encouraged
implementation of tried, tested, and future-friendly CSS solutions, from Nicholas
Galagher's CSS normalize to CSS3's displacement of image-heavy design elements. It has
also supported (if not always modeled) HTML5 semantic markup.
Improving with age
With the release of v2.0, Bootstrap helped take responsive design into the mainstream,
ensuring that its interface elements could travel well across devices, from desktops, to
tablets, to handhelds.
With the v3.0 release, Bootstrap stepped up its game again by providing the following
features:
The responsive grid was now mobile-first friendly.
Icons now utilize web fonts and thus were mobile and retina-friendly.
With the drop of support for IE7, markup and CSS conventions were now leaner
and more efficient.
Since version 3.2, the autoprefixer was required to build Bootstrap.
This book is about the v4.0 release. This release contains many improvements and
also some new components while other components and plugins are dropped. In
the overview below, you will find the most important improvements and
changes in Bootstrap 4:
Less (Leaner CSS) has been replaced with Sass
Refactoring of CSS code to avoid tag and child selectors
Improved grid system with a new grid tier to better target mobile
devices
Replaced the navbar
Opt-in flexbox support
A new HTML reset module called Reboot. Reboot extends Nicholas Galagher's
CSS normalize and handles the box-sizing: border-box declarations.
jQuery plugins are written in ES6 now and come with UMD support.
Improved auto-placement of tooltips and popovers, thanks to the help of a library
called Tether.

Dropped support for Internet Explorer 8 which enables us to swap pixels with
rem and em units.
Added the Card component, which replaces the Wells, Thumbnails, and Panels in
earlier versions.
Dropped the icons in font format from the Glyphicon Halflings set.
Dropped the Affix plugin, which can be replaced with the position: sticky
polyfill ( h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / f i l a m e n t g r o u p / f i x e d - s t i c k y).
The power of Sass
When working with Bootstrap, there is the power of Sass to consider. Sass is a preprocessor
for CSS. It extends the CSS syntax with variables, mixins, and functions, and helps you in
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) coding your CSS code. Sass was originally written in Ruby.
Nowadays, a fast port of Sass written in C++, called libSass is available. Bootstrap uses the
modern SCSS syntax for Sass instead of the older Sass's indented syntax.
Those who work with CSS in their daily job and have some experience
with functional programming language, won't find learning Sass very
difficult. However, those who want to get more out of Sass should read
my Sass and Compass Designer's Cookbook ( h t t p s : / / w w w . p a c k t p u b . c o m / w e
b - d e v e l o p m e n t / s a s s - a n d - c o m p a s s - d e s i g n e r s - c o o k b o o k) too.
In Bootstrap 4, Sass replaced Less. Less is another preprocessor for CSS. The Bootstrap team
preferred Sass over Less, because of the increasingly large community of Sass developers. If
you are used to Less and have to switch to Sass now, you should realize that Sass is more
like a functional programming language in contrast to the more declarative nature of Less.
In Sass you cannot use variables before declaring them first, so you have to modify your
variables at the beginning of your code. Bootstrap's variables have default values which can
be overwritten by declaring and assigning a new variable with the same name before the
default declaration.
In contrast to Less, Sass does support if-else-then constructs and for and foreach
loops.
When we move beyond merely applying classes to markup and take the next step to dig in
and customize Bootstrap's SCSS files, we gain tremendous power and efficiency. Starting
with a solid basis using Bootstrap's default styles, we can move on to innovate and
customize to our heart's content. In other words, Bootstrap is a powerful resource. I intend
to help you leverage it in exciting and serious ways, working with efficiency, adhering to
best practices, and producing beautiful, user-friendly interfaces.

Downloading the compiled code
On h t t p : / / g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m /, you will find some button links which enable you to
download the compiled code of Bootstrap. These downloads contain the compiled CSS and
JavaScript code ready to use in your projects. The compiled code contains the CSS and
JavaScript code for all of Bootstrap's components and features. Later on, you will learn to
create a custom version of Bootstrap, which includes only those components and features
that you really use.
Instead of the default code, you can also choose to download the Flexbox-enabled or grid-
only versions.
The Flexbox enabled version
On h t t p : / / g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m /, you can also download a compiled version of Bootstrap
with the optional Flexbox support already enabled. Since switching to the Flexbox version
does not require any HTML changes, you will only have to change the CSS source.
The grid only versions
Bootstrap ships with a 12 column, responsive, and mobile first grid. People who only want
to use the grid for their projects can download the grid only version. The grid only version
provides the predefined grid classes and does not require any JavaScript. Those who only
use the grid should add their own HTML reset which includes the box-sizing:
borderbox setting as described in the Box-sizing section of this chapter.
Beside the predefined grid classes, you can also have the option of using Sass variables and
mixins to create custom, semantic, and responsive page layouts.
Running Bootstrap from CDN
Instead of downloading your own copy of Bootstrap, you can also load it from CDN
(Content Delivery Network) inside your projects. CDNs help to distribute bandwidth across
multiple servers and allow users to download static content from a closer source.
Bootstrap can be loaded from h t t p s : / / w w w . b o o t s t r a p c d n . c o m /.
BootstrapCDN is powered by MaxCDN which can be found at h t t p s : / / w
w w . m a x c d n . c o m /.

Subresource Integrity (SRI)
CDN can be quite a risk, because others can get control over the CDN code and may inject
arbitrary malicious content into files. You can prevent this risk by adding the integrity
attribute to the <script> and <link> elements which loads the file from CDN. The
integrity attribute should be set to a string with base64-encoded sha384 hash. You
should also add the crossorigin attribute. The script element to load jQuery into your
project from MaxCDN may look like the following:
<script   src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.3.min.js"
integrity="sha256-a23g1Nt4dtEYOj7bR+vTu7+T8VP13humZFBJNIYoEJo="
crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
You can read more about Subresource Integrity checking at h t t p s : / / w w w .

Downloading Bootstrap's source files
There are many other ways to download Bootstrap, but not all ways of downloading
Bootstrap are equal. For what follows, we must be sure to get the Sass files, as these files
give us the power to customize and innovate upon Bootstrap's underlying style rules. For
this exercise, we'll go straight to the source, that is, h t t p : / / g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m /. You will 
encounter the following screenshot:

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 12 ]
Once there, the large Download source button is your friend. At least as of Version 4.0, this
is the second largest button on the homepage of Bootstrap:
In case something should change, you can always follow the GitHub project link at h t t p s : /
/ g i t h u b . c o m / t w b s / b o o t s t r a p, and once at the GitHub repository, click on the Download
ZIP button. Or run the following command in your console to clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git
The files you'll have
Once you've downloaded the Bootstrap source files, you should see a file structure that is
similar to the following screenshot:
www.ebook3000.com

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 13 ]
The preceding files contain not only Bootstrap's source files, including the SCSS code and
EM6 code for the jQuery plugins, but also the files to set up Bootstrap's build process.
Bootstrap is built with Grunt by default. Admittedly, that's a lot of files, and we don't need
them all. On the plus side, we have everything we want from Bootstrap. Notice that the
source does not contain font files since the Glyphicon Halflings set has been dropped as
described earlier. Bootstrap's default fonts are set by CSS only and do not require a font file.
While the exact contents of the repository will change over time, the main contents will
remain relatively consistent. Most notably, in the scss folder, you will find all the
important Sass files, which are key to every project in this book. Another benefit is that the
js folder contains Bootstrap's individual JavaScript plugins so that these may be selectively
included as needed.
On the other hand, if you want Bootstrap's default, precompiled CSS or JavaScript files
(such as bootstrap.css or bootstrap.min.js), they are still available within the dist
folder. The structure of the precompiled files will look like the following:
The umd folder in the preceding screenshot contains the plugin files ready to require()
this file in a CommonJS environment. These files are UMD ready (Universal Module
Definition). Both CommonJS and AMD are script loaders which ensure that different
JavaScript components load in the right order and play nice together. The universal pattern
of UMD supports both CommonJS and AMD.
As a bonus, you'll find the example HTML templates in the docs/examples folder. In fact,
we'll use one of these examples to set up our first project template folder.

[ 14 ]
Other ways to download and integrate Bootstrap
Instead of directly downloading Bootstrap, you can also use other tool and package
managers to get the files. In the overview below, you will find a list of commands and tools:
Install with npm: npm install bootstrap
Install with Meteor: meteor add twbs:bootstrap
Install with Composer: composer require twbs/bootstrap
Install with Bower: bower install bootstrap
Install with NuGet:
CSS: Install-Package bootstrap -Pre
Sass: Install-Package bootstrap.sass -Pre
Tooling setup
To use the Grunt file and run Bootstrap's documentation locally, you'll need a copy of
Bootstrap's source files, Node, and Grunt. Use the following steps to start working with
Bootstrap's build process:
Install the Grunt command line tools, grunt-cli, with npm install -g
grunt-cli
Navigate to the root /bootstrap directory and run npm install to install our
local dependencies listed in package.json
Install Ruby and install Bundler with gem install bundler, and finally run
bundle install. This will install all Ruby dependencies, such as Jekyll and
plugins
Now you can run the documentation locally by running the following command from the
root /bootstrap directory in your console:
bundle exec jekyll serve
After the preceding step, the documentation and examples are available at
http://localhost:/9010.

[ 15 ]
The HTML starter template
After downloading the Bootstrap source files, you can link the compiled CSS and JavaScript
files from the dist folder to your HTML. You can do this by creating a new HTML
template. Your HTML template should look like the following:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <!-- Required meta tags always come first -->
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1,
shrink-to-fit=no">
        <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">
        <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
        <link rel="stylesheet"
href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.2/css/bootstrap
.min.css">
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <!-- jQuery first, then Bootstrap JS. -->
        <script
src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></sc
ript>
    <script
src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tether/1.1.2/js/tether.min.js">
</script>
        <script
src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.2/js/bootstrap.m
in.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
As seen above, your HTML code should start with the HTML5 doctype: <!DOCTYPE html>
Responsive meta tag
Because of the responsive and mobile first nature of Bootstrap, your HTML code should
also contain a responsive meta tag in the head section which looks like the following:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-
to-fit=no">
The mobile first strategy of Bootstrap means that the code is optimized for mobile devices
first. CSS media queries are used to add more features for larger screen sizes.

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 16 ]
The X-UA-Compatible meta tag
The X-UA-Compatible is another important meta tag which should be added to the head
section of your HTML template. It should look like the following:
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">
The preceding meta tag is forcing Internet Explorer to use its latest rendering mode.
Bootstrap's CSS code
Of course you should also link Bootstrap's CSS code to your HTML document, the example
template above loads the CSS code from CDN. You can replace the CDN URI with your
local copy found in the dist folder as follows:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
The JavaScript files
And finally, you should link the JavaScript files at the end of your HTML code for faster
loading. Bootstrap's JavaScript plugin requires jQuery, so you have to load jQuery before
the plugins. The popover and plugins also require the Tether library which requires jQuery
too. Link Tether after jQuery and before the plugins. Your HTML should look like the
following:
<script
src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></sc
ript>
<script
src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tether/1.1.2/js/tether.min.js">
</script>
<script
src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-alpha.2/js/bootstrap.m
in.js"></script>
Of course you can link local copies of the files instead of the CDN URIs too.

Using Bootstrap CLI
In this book you will be introduced to Bootstrap CLI. Instead of using Bootstrap's bundled
build process, you can also start a new project by running the Bootstrap CLI.
Bootstrap CLI is the command-line interface for Bootstrap 4. It includes some built-in
example projects, but you can also use it to employ and deliver your own projects.
You'll need the following software installed to get started with Bootstrap CLI:
Node.js 0.12+: Use the installer provided on the Node.js website, which can be
found at the follow URL: h t t p s : / / n o d e j s . o r g / e n /
With Node installed, run [sudo] npm install -g grunt bower
Git: Use the installer for your OS
Windows users can also try Git for Windows
Gulp is another task runner for the Node.js system. Notice that when you prefer Gulp over
Grunt, you should install gulp instead of grunt with the following command:
[sudo] npm install -g gulp bower
You can read more about Gulp in Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp.
The Bootstrap CLI is installed through npm by running the following command in your
console:
npm install -g bootstrap-cli
This will add the bootstrap command to your system.
Preparing a new Bootstrap project
After installing Bootstrap CLI, you can create a new Bootstrap project by running the
following command in your console:
  bootstrap new --template empty-bootstrap-project-gulp

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 18 ]
Enter the name of your project for the question: ”What's the project called? (no spaces)“. A
new folder with the project name will be created. After the setup process, the directory and
file structure of your new project folder should look like that shown in the following
screenshot:
The project folder also contains a Gulpfile.js file. In Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build
Process with Gulp, you can read how to set up a Bootstrap project with a Gulp build process
yourself.
Now you can run the bootstrap watch command in your console and start editing the
html/pages/index.html file. The HTML templates are compiled with Panini. Panini is a
flat file compiler which helps you to create HTML pages with consistent layouts and
reusable partials with ease.
You can read more about Panini at h t t p : / / f o u n d a t i o n . z u r b . c o m / s i t e s / d o c s / p a n i n i . h t
m l.
Panini compiles the HTML templates into a single index.html file like the base template
described in the preceding sections.
Setting up major structural elements
We're almost ready for page content. Specifically, we'll create the following:
A banner space with our logo and navigation
A main content space for page content
A footer area for copyright information and social links
www.ebook3000.com

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 19 ]
We'll set this up using current HTML5 best practices with the support of major Accessible
Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) role attributes (with roles such as banner,
navigation, main, and contentinfo).
Run the bootstrap watch command, and your browser should open automatically on
http://localhost:8080/. Then start editing the html/pages/index.html file; you can
use your favorite text editor, and write down the following HTML code into it:
---
layout: default
title: Home
---
<header role="banner">
  <nav role="navigation">
  </nav>
</header>
<main role="main">
  <h1>Main Heading</h1>
  <p>Content specific to this page goes here.</p>
</main>
<footer role="contentinfo">
  <p><small>Copyright &copy; Company Name</small></p>
</footer>
This gives us some basic page structure and content. Let's keep rolling. Notice that the
content you have added to the html/pages/index.html file is compiled into
the html/layout/default.html layout template. The layout template contains the main
HTML structure and links the compiled CSS and JavaScript code.
The JavaScript code has been linked at the end of the HTML code for faster performance.
Notice that Gulp bundles jQuery, Tether, and the Bootstrap jQuery plugins into a single
_site/js/app.jss  file. Loading jQuery on Tether from CDN is an alternative solution.
Providing a navbar markup
The compiled CSS code is already linked to the compiled HTML code and can be found in
the _site/css folder. We'll learn how to customize the CSS with Sass shortly. But first, let's
put at least one Bootstrap-specific element in place, that is, the navbar.

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 20 ]
Initially, we want only Bootstrap's basic navbar (we'll add other details later). I've used the
markup taken from Bootstrap's documentation. This leads to the following result, nested
within our header element:
<header role="banner">
<nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-faded" role="navigation">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="index.html">Navbar</a>
  <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link active" href="#">Home <span class="sr-
only">(current)</span></a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link" href="#">About</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <form class="form-inline pull-xs-right">
    <input class="form-control" type="text" placeholder="Search">
    <button class="btn btn-success-outline" type="submit">Search</button>
  </form>
</nav>
</header>
Save your results, and the browser will automatically refresh. You should now see
Bootstrap's default navigation styles, and you'll also see some typographic enhancements as
shown in the following screenshot. This is Bootstrap CSS at work. Congratulations!
We now have the default Bootstrap styles in place.
www.ebook3000.com

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 21 ]
The CSS classes of the navbar
As you can see in the preceding navbar example, you can construct the navbar with
standard HTML elements, such as the <nav>, <a> and <ul>, and Bootstrap's CSS classes.
First inspect the classes added to the <nav> element in the following snippet:
<nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-faded" role="navigation"></nav>
The .nav class sets the basic styles for the navbar.
The .navbar-light and .navbar-dark classes set the color of the texts and links in the
navbar. You should use the .navbar-light classes when the background color of the
navbar has a light color and the .navbar-dark class for dark colored navbars.
Finally, the .bg-* classes set the background color of the navbar; you can use one of the
following classes to do this: .bg-inverse, .bg-faded, .bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-
info, .bg-warning and .bg-danger. These classes are part of Bootstrap's contextual
backgrounds and can also be used for other elements and components.
The title or heading of the navbar can be an <a> or <span> element with the .navbar-
brand class.
The navbar items are built with an unnumbered list (<url>), wherein each list item (<li>)
gets the .nav-item tag and contains an anchor (<a>) tag with the .navbar-link class.
Active items not only have the .navbar-link class but also the .active class.
Finally, notice the .sr-only class in the following snippet of the navbar HTML code:
<span class="sr-only">(current)</span>
HTML elements with the .sr-only class are only available for screen readers.
More information about this can be found at
http://a11yproject.com/posts/how-to-hide-content/.

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 22 ]
Placement of the navbars
By default, navbars have rounded corners and are statically placed on the page. Special CSS
classes can be used to fix the navbar at the top (.navbar-fixed-top) or bottom (.navbar-
fixed-bottom) of the page or remove the rounded corners and set the z-index of the
navbar (.nav bar-full). Now, let's complete our navbar by making it responsive. As a
bonus, this will test to ensure that Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins are working as they
should.
Adding collapsible content to the navbar
Bootstrap's collapsible plugin allows you to create collapsible content by simply using a <a>
and <button> tag to toggle hidden content. You can add the toggle button to your navbar
too.
First create your collapsible content and wrap it in a <div class="collapse"> with a
unique id as follows:
<div class="collapse" id="collapsiblecontent">
Collapsible content
</div>
Then create the button with .navbar-toggler class and data-toggle and data-target
attributes like that shown in the HTML code shown as follows:
<button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-
target="#collapsiblecontent">
☰;
; </button>
In the above code snippet, the data-toggle attribute should be set to collapse to trigger
the collapse plugin, and the data-target attribute should refer to the unique ID set for
your collapsible content. Notice that the &#9776HTML code defines the so-called hamburger
sign which looks like this:
Now you can bring the preceding codes together and place the button in the navbar. Write
down the following HTML in the html/pages/index.html file and inspect the results in
your browser:
www.ebook3000.com

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 23 ]
<header>
  <div class="collapse" id="collapsiblecontent">
    Collapsible content
  </div>
  <nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-faded" role="navigation">
  <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-
target="#collapsiblecontent">
    ☰
  </button>
 </nav>
</header>
If you are still running the bootstrap watch command, your browser should automatically
reload. The result should look like that shown in the following screenshot:
Click the hamburger and you should find that the collapsible content becomes visible. Now
you can be sure that the collapse plugin works as expected. The collapse plugin is also used
for a responsive navbar as discussed in the next section.
Content wrapped in the .collapse is hidden by default. By clicking the toggle button, the
plugin adds the  .in class which sets the display to visible. The plugin starts with adding a
temporary .collapsing class which sets a CSS animation that ensures the transition goes
ahead smoothly.
Responsive features and breakpoints
Bootstrap has got four breakpoints at 544, 768, 992 and 1200 pixels by default. At these
breakpoints your design may adapt to and target specific devices and viewport sizes.
Bootstrap's mobile-first and responsive grid(s) also use these breakpoints. You can read
more about the grids later on.

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 24 ]
You can use these breakpoints to specify and name the viewport ranges as follows; the extra
small (xs) range for portrait phones with a viewport smaller than 544 pixels, the small (sm)
range for landscape phones with viewports smaller than 768 pixels, the medium (md) range
for tablets with viewports smaller than 992 pixels, the large (lg) range for desktop with 
viewports wider than 992 pixels, and finally the extra large (xl) range for desktops with a
viewport wider than 1200 pixels. The break points are in pixel values as the viewport pixel
size does not depend on the font size and modern browsers have already fixed some
zooming bugs.
Some people claim em values should be preferred.
To learn more about this, have a look at the following link: h t t p : / / z e l l w k
. c o m / b l o g / m e d i a - q u e r y - u n i t s /.
Those who still prefer em values over pixel values can simply change the $grid-
breakpoints variable declaration in the scss/includes/_variables.scss file. To use
em values for media queries, the SCSS code should look like the following:
$grid-breakpoints: (
  // Extra small screen / phone
  xs: 0,
  // Small screen / phone
  sm: 34em, // 544px
  // Medium screen / tablet
  md: 48em, // 768px
  // Large screen / desktop
  lg: 62em, // 992px
  // Extra large screen / wide desktop
  xl: 75em //1200px
);
Notice that you also have to change the $container-max-widths variable declaration.
You should change or modify Bootstrap's variables in the local
scss/includes/_variables.scss file, as explained at h t t p : / / b a s s j o b s e n . w e b l o g s . f m
/ p r e s e r v e _ s e t t i n g s _ a n d _ c u s t o m i z a t i o n s _ w h e n _ u p d a t i n g _ b o o t s t r a p /. This will ensure
that your changes are not overwritten when updating Bootstrap.

Responsive utility classes
Bootstrap contains some predefined utility classes for faster mobile-friendly development.
You can use these classes to show or hide content by device and viewport via media query.
The .hidden-*-up classes, where the asterisks can be replaced with one of the breakpoint
shorthand names, hide everything for viewports wider than the given breakpoint. So for
instance, the .hidden-md-up class hides an element on medium, large, and extra-large
viewports. On the other hand, the .hidden-md-down classes go in the other direction and
hide an element when the viewport is smaller than the breakpoint.
Bootstrap's media query ranges, or breakpoints are also available via Sass mixins. The
media-breakpoint-up() mixin with one of the breakpoint shorthands as an input
parameter sets the min-width value of the media query to hide content for viewports
wider than the breakpoint. The max-width of the media query to hide everything for
viewports smaller than the breakpoint can be set with the media-breakpoint-down()
mixin.
Consider the following SCSS, which can be written down at the end of the
 scss/app.scss file:
p {
font-size: 1.2em;
   @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
     font-size: 1em;
   }
}
The preceding SCSS code compiles into static CSS code as follows:
p {
  font-size: 1.2em;
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  p {
    font-size: 1em;

Completing the responsive navbar
To completely make our navbar take advantage of Bootstrap's responsive navbar solution,
we need to add two new elements, with appropriate classes and data attributes.

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 26 ]
We'll begin by adding the toggle button to the navbar code we have used before. The
HTML code of your button should look like the following:
 <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-md-up pull-xs-right" type="button"
data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsiblecontent">
    ☰
  </button>
As you can see in the preceding HTML code, the button has the same data attributes as
before, from the collapsible content example, since the responsive navbar uses the collapse
plugin too. The button has a .hidden-md-up utility class, as described before, to hide the
button for viewports wider than 768px. The .pull-xs-right class ensures that the button
floats on the right side of the navbar.
Secondly, you have to add the classes of the element which should collapse. We collapse the
<ul> that holds the navigation links. Add the .navbar-toggleable-sm that ensures that
the elements do not collapse on viewports larger than the breakpoint, while the .collapse
class hides the element by default. Finally, set the unique ID specified on the data-target
attribute of the button before. Your HTML code should look like the following now:
 <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-toggleable-sm collapse"
id="collapsiblecontent"></ul>
The complete HTML code of your responsive navbar should look as follows. You can add it
to the html/pages/index.html file to test it in your browser:
<header role="banner">
  <nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-faded" role="navigation">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="index.html">Navbar</a>
   <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-md-up pull-xs-right" type="button"
data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsiblecontent">
    ☰
  </button>
  <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-toggleable-sm collapse"
id="collapsiblecontent">
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link active" href="#">Home <span class="sr-
only">(current)</span></a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">
      <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item">

      <a class="nav-link" href="#">About</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
The tag structure, class names, or data attributes may change with future
versions of Bootstrap. If yours does not work as it should, be sure to check
Bootstrap's own documentation. As a fallback option, you can start with
the starting files provided with the sample code for this book.
The .navbar-brand and .nav-link classes have a float:left set by default. So that
your navigation links should not float for the collapsed version of your navbar, you should
undo the float. You can use the following SCSS code to remove the float for smaller
viewports, and write it down at the end of the scss/app.sccs file:
.navbar {
  @include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {
    .navbar-brand,
    .nav-item {
      float: none;
    }
  }
}
If you run the bootstrap watch command your browser should automatically reload after
saving the HTML or Sass code, if not, run the command again. Your browser should show
the results at http://localhost:8080/. Click on and drag the edge of the browser
window to make the window narrower than 768 pixels.
If all works as it should, you should see a collapsed version of the navbar, as shown in the
following screenshot, with the site name or logo and a toggle button:

This is a good sign! Now click on the toggle button, and it should slide open, as shown in
the following screenshot:
Success! Congratulations!
The new Reboot module and Normalize.css.
When talking about cascade in CSS, there will, no doubt, be a mention of the browser
default settings getting a higher precedence than the author's preferred styling. In other
words, anything that is not defined by the author will be assigned a default styling set by
the browser. The default styling may differ for each browser and this behavior plays a
major role in many cross-browser issues. To prevent these sorts of problems, you can
perform a CSS reset CSS or HTML resets set a default author style for commonly used
HTML elements to make sure that browser default styles do not mess up your pages or
render your HTML elements to be different on other browsers.
Bootstrap uses Normalize.css written by Nicholas Galagher. Normalize.css is a modern,
HTML5-ready alternative to CSS resets and can be downloaded from h t t p : / / n e c o l a s . g i t
h u b . i o / n o r m a l i z e . c s s /. It lets browsers render all elements more consistently and makes
them adhere to modern standards. Together with some other styles, Normalize.css forms
the new Reboot module of Bootstrap.

[ 29 ]
Box-sizing
The Reboot module also sets the globalbox-sizing value from content-box to border-
box. The box-sizing property is the one that sets the CSS-box model used for calculating the
dimensions of an element. In fact, box-sizing is not new in CSS, but nonetheless, switching
your code to box-sizing: border-box will make your work a lot easier. When using the
border-box settings, calculation of the width of an element includes border width and
padding. So, changing the border width or padding of an element won't break your layouts.
Predefined CSS classes
Bootstrap ships with predefined CSS classes for everything. You can build a mobile first
responsive grid for your project by only using div elements and the right grid classes. CSS
classes for styling other elements and components are available too. Consider the styling of
a button in the following HTML code:
<button class="btn btn-warning">Warning!</button>
Now your button will look like that shown in the preceding screenshot:
You should notice that Bootstrap uses two classes to style a single button. The first .btn
class gives the button the general button layout styles. The second .btn-warning class sets
the custom colors of the buttons.
Partial attribute selectors in CSS give us the ability to make partial matches
to attribute values. You can, for instance, match all elements having a class
starting with btn-, so you may wonder why Bootstrap does not use the
[class^='btn-'] attribute selector instead of the .btn class to set the
general button styles. Firstly, Bootstrap avoids partial attribute selectors,
since some people claimed these selectors are slow. Secondly,
[class^='btn-']does not match "not btn-".
You can also use these classes to style a hyperlink (<a>) like a button as follows:
    <a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">Link</a>

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 30 ]
Sass variables and mixins
You can change Bootstrap's default styles by changing the Sass variables in the
scss/_variabels.scss file. Setting the $brand-primary variable to a different color
value will change the look of the buttons with the btn-primary class in the preceding
example.
You can reuse Bootstrap's Sass mixins to extend Bootstrap with your own custom classes.
Sass mixins and variables are available to build your own (semantic) grid, but you can also
create a custom button class by using the following SCSS code:
    .btn-tomato {
      @include button-variant(white, tomato, white);
    }
The preceding SCSS code compiles into the CSS code like the following:
    .btn-tomato {
      color: white;
      background-color: tomato;
      border-color: white;
    }
    .btn-tomato:hover {
      color: white;
      background-color: #ff3814;
      border-color: #e0e0e0;
    }
    .btn-tomato:focus, .btn-tomato.focus {
      color: white;
      background-color: #ff3814;
      border-color: #e0e0e0;
    }
    .btn-tomato:active, .btn-tomato.active,
    .open > .btn-tomato.dropdown-toggle {
      color: white;
      background-color: #ff3814;
      border-color: #e0e0e0;
      background-image: none;
    }
    .btn-tomato:active:hover, .btn-tomato:active:focus, .btn-
tomato:active.focus, .btn-tomato.active:hover, .btn-tomato.active:focus,
.btn-tomato.active.focus,
    .open > .btn-tomato.dropdown-toggle:hover,
    .open > .btn-tomato.dropdown-toggle:focus,
    .open > .btn-tomato.dropdown-toggle.focus {
      color: white;
      background-color: #ef2400;

      border-color: #bfbfbf;
    }
    .btn-tomato.disabled:focus, .btn-tomato.disabled.focus, .btn-
tomato:disabled:focus, .btn-tomato:disabled.focus {
      background-color: tomato;
      border-color: white;
    }
    .btn-tomato.disabled:hover, .btn-tomato:disabled:hover {
      background-color: tomato;
      border-color: white;
    }
Bootstrap's Sass code avoids element and nested selectors; a motivation can be found at
h t t p : / / m a r k d o t t o . c o m / 2 0
 1 5 / 0
 7 / 2 0
 / c s s - n e s t i n g /.
Bootstrap itself also avoids the @extend feature of Sass. The risk of using the @extend
feature is creating complex unused CSS code. See also Hugo Giraudel's article at h t t p s : / / w
w w . s i t e p o i n t . c o m / a v o i d - s a s s - e x t e n d /.
Using selector placeholders may reduce this risk, however Bootstrap does not use
placeholder selectors. This does not forbid you from customizing and extending Bootstrap
by using the
@extend feature. You can, for instance, use the @extend feature to make your images
responsive by default.
Images are not responsive by default in Bootstrap. To make an image responsive, you'll
have to add the .img-fluid class to your <img> element.
You can use the @extend feature to make your images responsive by default by adding the
following SCSS code at the end of the scss/app.scss file:
    img {
      @extend .img-fluid;
    }
Those who think using mixins is better than the @extend feature, should realize that
Bootstrap's Sass code does not contain a mixin for making fluid images at all.

Browser support
As mentioned before, Bootstrap 4 does not support Internet Explorer version 8 and earlier.
For projects that should support this browser I recommend you to use Bootstrap 3 instead.
Bootstrap 4 also comes with optional Flexbox support. Only Internet explorer versions 11
and higher support the CSS3 Flexible Box Layout Module. You can read more about the
pros and cons of the Flexbox module later on, in the Flexible Boxes section of this chapter.
Besides Internet Explorer 8 and earlier, Bootstrap supports all major browsers, including
many mobile browsers.
Vendor prefixes
CSS3 introduced vendor-specific rules, which offer you the possibility of writing some
additional CSS, applicable for only one browser. At first sight, this seems the exact opposite
of what we want. What we want is a set of standards and practicalities that work the same
with every browser and a standard set of HTML and CSS which has the same effect and
interpretation for every browser. These vendor-specific rules are intended to help us reach
this utopia. Vendor-specific rules also provide us with early implementations of standard
properties and alternative syntax. Last but not least, these rules allow browsers to
implement proprietary CSS properties that would otherwise have no working standard
(and may never actually become the standard).
For these reasons, vendor-specific rules play an important role in many new features of
CSS3. For example, animation properties, border-radius, and box-shadow: all did depend
on vendor-specific rules in past years. You can easily see that some properties may evolve
from vendor prefixes to standard, because currently, most browsers support the border-
radius, and box-shadow properties without any prefix.
Vendors use the following prefixes:
WebKit: -webkit
Firefox: -moz
Opera: -o
Internet Explorer: -ms
Consider the following CSS code:
transition: all .2s ease-in-out;
www.ebook3000.com

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 33 ]
For full browser support, or to support at least the browser supported by Bootstrap, we'll
have to write:
  -webkit-transition: all .2s ease-in-out;
  -o-transition: all .2s ease-in-out;
  transition: all .2s ease-in-out;
More information about the transition property and browser support can also be found at
the following URL: h t t p : / / c a n i u s e . c o m / # f e a t = c s s - t r a n s i t i o n s.
Because of different browsers and their different versions, browsers may use different
vendor prefixes to support the same property in writing cross-browser CSS code which can
become very complex.
Bootstrap's Sass code, which compiles into CSS code does not contain any prefixes. Instead
of using prefixes, the PostCSS autoprefixer has been integrated into Bootstrap's build
process. When you create your own build process you should also use the PostCSS
autoprefixer. In Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp, you can read how to
set up a build chain with Gulp.
Flexible boxes
Bootstrap 4 also comes with optional Flexbox support. The Flexbox Layout (also called
flexible boxes) is a new feature of CSS3. It is extremely useful in creating responsive and
flexible layouts. Flexbox provides the ability to dynamically change the layout for different
screen resolutions. It does not use floats and contains margins that do not collapse with
their content. The latest versions of all major browsers now support Flexbox layouts.
Information about browser support can also be found at h t t p : / / c a n i u s e .
c o m / # f e a t = f l e x b o x. Unfortunately, many older browsers do not have
support for Flexbox layouts.
To enable Flexbox support, you will have to set the $enable-flex Sass variable to true
and recompile Bootstrap. You do not have to change your HTML code after enabling
Flexbox support.

The Yeoman workflow
Yeoman helps you to kickstart new projects, and you can use it as an alternative for
Bootstrap CLI.
The Yeoman workflow comprises three types of tools for improving your productivity and
satisfaction when building a web app: the scaffolding tool (yo), the build tool (Grunt, Gulp,
and so on), and the package manager (like Bower and npm).
A Yeoman generator that scaffolds out a front-end Bootstrap 4 web app is available at h t t p s
: / / g i t h u b . c o m / b a s s j o b s e n / g e n e r a t o r - b o o t s t r a p 4. You can install it after installing
Yeoman by running the following commands in your console:
Install: npm install -g generator-bootstrap4
Run: yo bootstrap4
Run grunt for building and grunt serve for preview
The Yeoman generator for Bootstrap enables you to install your code with flexbox support.
The generator can also install the Font Awesome and / or the Octicons icons fonts for direct
usage in your app:
Troubleshooting
If things are not running smoothly, you should ask yourself the following questions:
Is your markup properly structured? Any unclosed, incomplete, or malformed
tags, classes, and so on present?
www.ebook3000.com

Getting Started with Bootstrap
[ 35 ]
You might find it helpful to do the following:
Work back through the preceding steps, double-checking things along the way.
Validate your HTML to ensure it's well formed.
Compare the completed version of the exercise files with your own.
Refer to the Bootstrap documentation for new updates to the relevant tag
structures and attributes.
Place your code in a snippet at h t t p s : / / j s f i d d l e . n e t / or h t t p s : / / c o d e p e n . i o
/, and share it with the good folks at h t t p : / / s t a c k o v e r f l o w . c o m / for help.
When we have so many moving parts to work with, things are bound to happen and these
are some of our best survival methods!
Bootply is a playground for Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery; you can use it to test
your HTML code. You can also add your compiled CSS code, but Bootply cannot compile
your CSS code.
Bootply can be found online at h t t p : / / w w w . b o o t p l y . c o m /.
Our site template is almost complete. Let's pause to take stock before moving on.
Summary
If you've made it this far, you have everything you need ready to do some serious work.
You have learned the basics of a new Bootstrap 4 project. You can easily set up a new
project with Bootstrap CLI now and build a responsive navbar (navigation). The navbar
uses the JavaScript Collapse plugin. You understand how to compile Bootstrap's Sass code
into CSS now and finally got a better understanding of Bootstrap CSS and HTML code,
including browser support.
This may be a good point to save a copy of these files so that they're ready
for other future projects.
In the next chapter, you will learn how to set up your own build process with Gulp and
automatically compile your projects.

Creating Your Own Build
Process with Gulp
In this chapter, you will learn how to set up your own build process for your Bootstrap
project. Bootstrap's CSS is written in Sass, so when you are not using the precompiled CSS
code, you will have to compile the CSS code by yourself. You'll need a Sass compiler to
compile the Sass code into CSS.
Also, Bootstrap JavaScript plugins should be bundled and minified before being taken into
production.
After reading this chapter, you will have learned to:
Set up a build process with Gulp
Create different environments in your build processor
Compile your Sass code into CSS
Automatically add vendor prefixes to your CSS code
Prepare the JavaScript plugin for your project
Run a static web server
Test your code
Use standard Bootstrap components and tweak them to fit your needs
Create a simple one-page marketing website with Bootstrap
Publish your project on GitHub

What are we going to build?
In this chapter, you will create a build process for an example project. The process not only
prepares your CSS and JavaScript code, but also runs a static web server, which
automatically reloads on file changes in browser testing, runs some tests for your code, and
more.
To demonstrate the different steps of the build process, you will create an example project.
The example project is a simple one-page marketing layout powered by Bootstrap. At the
end, you should have created an HTML page, which will look like that shown in the
following screenshot:

[ 38 ]
Requirements
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
Node.js uses an event-driven non-blocking input/output model and is very lightweight and
efficient. To run the example code in this chapter, you should have installed Node.js on
your system. Download the Node.js source code or a pre-built installer for your platform at
h t t p s : / / n o d e j s . o r g / e n / d o w n l o a d /. Node.js is available for Linux, Mac OSX, and
Windows.
npm is the package manager for Node.js, and it is installed automatically when installing
Node.js.
After installing Node.js and npm, you should also install Gulp globally on your system.
You can install Gulp by running the following command in your console:
npm install --global gulp-cli
What is Gulp and why should you use it?
Gulp is a task runner for Node.js. You can use it to create a build system. You can easily
add automating tasks such as modification and copying to the build system. You can also 
use Gulp to create watch events. These events automatically rerun the tasks of the build
system when a file changes. Bootstrap's CSS code is built with Sass, and you can use Gulp
to compile your Sass code into static CSS code. After compiling your Sass code, you can
build a task to post-process your CSS code.
Further on you will read that you can also use Gulp to test your code, run some linters, and
get your code ready for production by minifying and optimizing it. Linting is the process of
running a program that will analyze code for potential errors.
Bootstrap's build process
Bootstrap ships with its own build process. At the time of writing this book, Bootstrap's
build process is written with Grunt. It enables you to compile and prepare a custom version
of Bootstrap and run the documentation locally. Grunt is just like Gulp: it is a task runner
for Node.js. Grunt does not use streams but saves the temporary code in file products.
The tasks for Bootstrap's Grunt build process can be found in the Gruntfile.js file
included in the source files. You can use this file to understand which tasks you will have to
run to get your code ready for testing in production.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 39 ]
In this chapter, we use Gulp instead of Grunt since Gulp is considered to be more intuitive
and much easier to learn. Gulp is newer than Grunt, but its community is growing fast and
new plugins are added every day.
Finally, you should note that task runners that link Gulp and Grunt will make your work
easier but are not required to run your tasks on Node.js.
Installing Gulp in your project
Before we go any further, we must first initiate npm for our project by running the following
command in our console:
    npm init
Answer the questions like those shown in the following screenshot:
The preceding command creates a new package.json file; this file holds various metadata
relevant to the project, and it also contains the dependencies for the project. The Gulp
plugins you will install later on are all (dev) dependencies of your project.

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 40 ]
Now install Gulp in your project, devDependencies, by running the following command
in your console:
npm install --save-dev gulp
The --save-dev flag writes down Gulp as a devDependency into the package.json
file.
Creating the Gulpfile.js which holds your tasks
Create a new file called Gulpfile.js  in your project directory and write down the
following JavaScript code into it:
var gulp = require('gulp');
gulp.task('default', function() {
  // place code for your default task here
});
Later on you will add your Gulp task into this file. You can test it already by running the
following command in your console:
 gulp
The default task will run and do nothing.
Now you're ready to install not only Bootstrap but also the required Gulp plugins for your
build process.
The clean task
Each time the build process runs, the clean task should remove the temporary _site
directory and all of its contents:
// Erases the dist folder
gulp.task('clean', function() {
  rimraf('_site');
});
Notice that you'll have to install rimraf as follows:
    npm install rimraf --save-dev
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 41 ]
Setting up environments for development
and production
Of course, you will need your build process to develop your project, but after that you will
run different tasks to get your code ready for production. In the development stage, you
need CSS code with CSS sourcemaps for easy debugging, and in the production stage, you 
probably will minify the CSS code without CSS sourcemaps.
The gulp-environments plugin makes it convenient to create separate environments,
such as development and production, to run your tasks in. You can install this plugin by
running the following command:
npm install --save-dev gulp-environments
Then add the plugin to your Gulpfile.js file, which should look like this:
 var environments = require('gulp-environments');
Then assign the environments as follows:
var development = environments.development;
var production = environments.production;
Now you can pass a command line flag --env to set the environment:
gulp build --env development
You can also, conditionally assign a variable like:
var source = production() ? "source.min.js" : "source.js";
Or run sub tasks for only one environment:
.pipe(development(sourcemaps.init()))
The full documentation and some examples of the gulp-environments
plugin can be found at: h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / g u n p o w d e r l a b s / g u l p - e n v i
r o n m e n t s.

Installing Bootstrap via Bower
Bower is a package management system for client-side programming. You can use Bower to
install Bootstrap's source code and keep it up to date more easily. Initiate Bower by running
the following command in your console:
bower init
Answer the questions like those shown in the following screenshot:
After the preceding steps, a bower.json file is created. Then run the following command in
your console:
bower install bootstrap#4 --save-dev
The preceding command downloads Bootstrap to the bower_components folder. Notice
that jQuery and Tether are also installed since Bootstrap depends on these libraries.
The --save-dev flag writes down Bootstrap as a devDependency into the bower.json
file.
Creating a local Sass structure 
Before we can start compiling Bootstrap's Sass code into CSS code, we have to create some
local Sass or SCSS files. First, create a new scss subdirectory in your project directory. In
the scss directory, create your main project file called app.scss.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 43 ]
Then create a new subdirectory in the new scss directory called includes. Now you will
have to copy the bootstrap.scss and _variables.scss from the Bootstrap source code
in the bower_components directory to the new scss/includes directory:
cp bower_components/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss
scss/includes/_bootstrap.scss
cp bower_components/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss scss/includes/
Notice that the bootstrap.scss file has been renamed as _bootstrap.scss, starting
with an underscore, and has become a partial file now.
Import the files you have copied in the previous step into the  app.scss file as follows:
@import "includes/variables";
@import "includes/bootstrap";
Then open the  scss/includes/_bootstrap.scss file and change the import part for
the Bootstrap partial files, so that the original code in the  bower_components directory
will be imported here. Notice that we set the include path for the Sass compiler to the
bower_components directory later on. The @import statements should look like that
shown in the following SCSS code:
    // Core variables and mixins
    @import "bootstrap/scss/variables";
    @import "bootstrap/scss/mixins";
    // Reset and dependencies
    @import "bootstrap/scss/normalize";
    .....
You're importing all of Bootstrap's SCSS code in your project now. When preparing your
code for production, you can consider commenting out the partials you do not require for
your project.
Modification of the scss/includes/_variables.scss is not required, but you can
consider removing the !default declarations because the real default values are set in the
original  _variables.scss file which is imported after the local one.
Notice that the local  scss/includes/_variables.scss  file does not have to contain a
copy of all Bootstrap's variables. Having them all makes it easier to modify them for
customization; it also ensures that your default values do not change when updating
Bootstrap.

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 44 ]
Compiling Bootstrap's Sass code into CSS code
Now it's time to start compiling the Sass code into CSS code. Bootstrap's Sass code is written
in the newer SCSS syntax. In this chapter, we do not discuss Sass in great detail. You should
read Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass, to learn more about Sass
itself.
Two Gulp plugins are available to compile Sass into CSS with Gulp. The first plugin is
called gulp-ruby-sass and as its name already tells you, it compiles Sass to CSS with
Ruby Sass. The second gulp-sass plugin uses node-sass to compile your Sass code with
libSass. In this book, a gulp-sass plugin is used. Notice that Compass is not compatible
with libSass.
You can install gulp-sass in your project by running the following command in your
console:
    npm install gulp-sass --save-dev
After installing the plugin, you can add the compile task to your Gulpfile.js as follows:
var sass = require('gulp-sass');
var bowerpath = process.env.BOWER_PATH || 'bower_components/';
var sassOptions = {
  errLogToConsole: true,
  outputStyle: 'expanded',
  includePaths: bowerpath
};
gulp.task('compile-sass', function () {
    return gulp.src('./scss/app.scss')
        .pipe(sass(sassOptions).on('error', sass.logError))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./_site/css/'));
});
Notice that we set the includePaths option to the bowerpath variable as described
previously; and also the development()condition is used to write CSS sourcemaps only in
the development stage. You can read more about CSS sourcemaps in the next section.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 45 ]
CSS sourcemaps for debugging
The Sass compiler merges different Sass files to a single CSS file. This CSS file has been
minified in most cases. When you are inspecting the source of HTML files with the
developer tools of your browser, you cannot relate the style effects to your original Sass
code. CSS Sourcemaps solve this problem by mapping the combined/minified file back to its
unbuilt state.
CSS source maps were introduced to map minified JavaScript to its origin source. Since
version 3 of the CSS source map protocol, it has also support for CSS. The Sass compiler (or
better, the gulp-sourcemap plugin in this case) generates the CSS source map and adds a
reference into the CSS file as follows:
 /*# sourceMappingURL=app.css.map */
In the following screenshot, you will find an example of the style rules pointing to their Sass
file of origin in the browser's developer's tools:
To use CSS sourcemaps, you have to install the gulp-sourcemaps plugin first:
npm install gulp-sourcemaps --save-dev
After that you can add the sourcemaps to your compile-sass task as follows:
gulp.task('compile-sass', function () {
    return gulp.src('./scss/app.scss')

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 46 ]
        .pipe(development(sourcemaps.init()))
        .pipe(sass(sassOptions).on('error', sass.logError))
        .pipe(development(sourcemaps.write()))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./_site/css/'));
});
Notice that the CSS sourcemaps are only generated in the development stage due to the
development()wrapping and the gulp-environments plugin.
The gulp-sourcemaps plugin does also support the gulp-postcss and gulp-cssnano
plugins as described later on. You should call these plugins between the
sourcemaps.init() and sourcemaps.write()calls in the compile-sass task.
Running the postCSS autoprefixer
Since version 3.2, Bootstrap requires the autoprefixer plugin for vendor prefixing your CSS
code. Running the postCSS autoprefixer plugin is easy and fully automated with Gulp.
The  gulp-postcss plugin enables you to run other plugins to post-process your
compiled CSS code.
Bootstrap requires the  postcss autoprefixer which you can run with the  gulp-postcss
plugin. The autoprefixer automatically adds the required vendor prefixes to your CSS code,
and it uses the data of the Can I Use database ( h t t p : / / c a n i u s e . c o m/).
Notice that Bootstrap also requires the mq4-hover-shim, which is a shim for the Media
Queries Level 4 hover @media feature.
See h t t p s : / / w w w . n p m j s . c o m / p a c k a g e / m q 4 - h o v e r - s h i m for more details about this shim.
Perform the following steps to install and configure both the autoprefixer and mq4-
hover-shim. Start by running the following command in your console:
npm install gulp-postcss autoprefixer mq4-hover-shim --save-dev
Now you can declare a variable which contains your processors for the  gulp-
postcss plugin at the Gulpfile.js:
 var processors = [
 mq4HoverShim.postprocessorFor({ hoverSelectorPrefix: '.bs-true-hover ' }),
 autoprefixer({
browsers: [

 'Explorer >= 9',
 'iOS >= 8',
 'Safari >= 8',
 'Android 2.3',

 'Opera >= 12'
 ]
 })
 ];
As you can see, the autoprefixer accepts a hash argument which sets which browser should
be supported. You can copy this hash from the
 bower_components/bootstrap/Grunt.js file of Bootstrap's source files.
After setting your processors you can add the postcss plugin to your sass compile task as
follows. Notice also that the gulp-postcss plugin supports the gulp-sourcemaps plugin:
gulp.task('compile-sass', function () {
    return gulp.src('./scss/app.scss')
        .pipe(development(sourcemaps.init()))
        .pipe(sass(sassOptions).on('error', sass.logError))
        .pipe(postcss(processors))
        .pipe(development(sourcemaps.write()))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./_site/css/'));
});
Getting your CSS code ready for production
In the production stage of your project, you do not need CSS sourcemaps anymore. The
development() wrapping in the  compile-sass task already guarantees that CSS
sourcemaps are not generated when the environment is set to production by the gulp-
environments plugin.
The smaller your compiled CSS code, the faster it will load in your browser. So minifying
the compiled CSS code will allow faster loading. CSSnano runs your CSS code through
many focused optimizations, to ensure that the final result is as small as possible for a
production environment.

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 48 ]
A Gulp plugin for CSS nano is available too; you can install it by running the following
command in your console:
npm install gulp-cssnano --save-dev
After installing the plugin, you can add it to your compile-sass task:
var cssnano = require('gulp-cssnano');
gulp.task('compile-sass', function () {
    return gulp.src('./scss/app.scss')
        .pipe(development(sourcemaps.init()))
        .pipe(sass(sassOptions).on('error', sass.logError))
        .pipe(postcss(processors))
        .pipe(production(cssnano()))
        .pipe(development(sourcemaps.write()))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./_site/css/'));
});
The preceding code makes it clear that cssnano only runs when the environment is set to
production. You can also run cssnano as a processor for the gulp-postcss plugin.
The most common issue for CSS performance is unused CSS code. You can comment out
the CSS components and other code that you do not use in the
scss/includes/_bootstrap.scss file to make your compiled CSS code smaller.
Linting your SCSS code
When you are using Sass to extend and modify Bootstrap's CSS code, it is important that
you keep your code clean and readable. The SCSS-lint tool can help you to write clean and
reusable SCSS code. A Gulp plugin is available for the SCSS-lint tool and you can install it
by running the following command in your console:
npm install gulp-scss-lint --save-dev
Notice that the gulp-scss-lint plugin requires both Ruby and SCSS-lint installed
already.
Now you can add the scss-lint task to your Gulpfile.js:
gulp.task('scss-lint', function() {
  return gulp.src('scss/**/*.scss')
    .pipe(scsslint());
});
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 49 ]
Bootstrap has its own configuration file for the SCSS-lint tool. You can reuse this
configuration for your custom code, and copy the configuration file from the Bootstrap
source code to your local scss directory:
cp bower_components/bootstrap/scss/.scss-lint.yml scss/
Then modify your scss-lint task so that the configuration file is used:
    gulp.task('scss-lint', function() {
      return gulp.src('scss/**/*.scss')
        .pipe(scsslint({'config': 'scss/.scss-lint.yml'}));
    });
When running the linter over the current Sass files in the scss directory, include the local
copies of the _variable.scss and _bootstrap.scss file. You will find that the
comments in the  _bootstrap.scss will give a warning.
In the .scss-lint.yml, you can enable this warning by changing the comments setting as
follows:
      Comment:
        enabled: true
        exclude: ['_bootstrap.scss']
Also in the example code, the following configuration has been changed:
      ColorKeyword:
        enabled: false
Using keywords for colors, for instance orange instead of #ffa500 is mostly considered as
a bad practice. In the example code in this book, color names are preferred because they're
easier to read by humans.
You can read how to configure other settings in Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with
Bootstrap and Sass.
Of course, you can add the  scss-lint task to your default task, but you can also run it
manually when needed. When adding the scss-lint task in the default task, you should
consider using it together with the  gulp-cached plugin to only lint the modified files:
    var scsslint = require('gulp-scss-lint');
    var cache = require('gulp-cached');
    gulp.task('scss-lint', function() {
      return gulp.src('/scss/**/*.scss')
        .pipe(cache('scsslint'))
        .pipe(scsslint());

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 50 ]
    });
You should also use the  gulp-cached plugin as shown in the preceding code when
linting your files via the watch task as described further on in this chapter.
Preparing the JavaScript plugins
Some of Bootstrap's components do not only require CSS but also JavaScript. Bootstrap
comes with jQuery plugins for commonly used components. Similarly, the navbar requires
the collapse plugin and the carousel component has its own plugin too.
Bootstrap's plugins require jQuery and the Tooltips and Popover components also require
the Tether library.
In the build process, you can bundle jQuery, Tether, and the plugins into a single file by
using the gulp-concat plugin.
You can install the gulp-concat plugin by running the following command in your
console:
npm install gulp-concat --save-dev
After that the task that bundles the JavaScript files may look like:
gulp.task('compile-js', function() {
  return gulp.src([bowerpath+ 'jquery/dist/jquery.min.js', bowerpath+
'tether/dist/js/tether.min.js', bowerpath+
'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js','js/main.js'])
    .pipe(concat('app.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./_site/js/'));
});
The preceding compile-js task also bundles a local js/main.js file; you can put the
plugin settings or your custom JavaScript code into this file.
Getting your JavaScript code ready for
production
The preceding  compile-js task only concatenates the JavaScript files which are already
compiled and minified. These files are loaded from the  bower_components directory.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 51 ]
The  bootstrap.min.js file contains all the plugins. You will probably only use some of
these plugins.
To create a smaller JavaScript file, you can only bundle the plugins you need and minify the
code yourself in the build process.
You can minify your code with the  gulp-uglify plugin that can be installed with the
following command:
npm install --save-dev gulp-uglify
Your compile-js task may look like the following when using the gulp-uglify plugin:
gulp.task('compile-js', ['compress']);
After that the task that bundles the JavaScript files may look like this:
var uglify = require('gulp-uglify');
gulp.task('compress', function() {
  return gulp.src([
    bowerpath+ 'jquery/dist/jquery.js',
    bowerpath+ 'tether/dist/js/tether.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/alert.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/button.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/carousel.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/collapse.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/dropdown.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/modal.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/popover.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/scrollspy.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/tab.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/tooltip.js',
    bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/js/src/util.js',
    'js/main.js' // custom JavaScript code
    ])
    .pipe(uglify())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist/js/app.js'));
});
In the preceding code, leave out the JavaScript files you do not need for your project.
The preceding task also bundles the jQuery and Tether libraries, and you can also load
these libraries via CDN. For this project, you can do this by using the following HTML in
the html/includes/footerjavascripts.html template:
     <!-- jQuery first, then Bootstrap JS. -->
    <script

script>
    <script src="{{ root }}js/app.js"></script>
Read more about the HTML templates in the coming sections.
Modularization of your HTML
Although we'll only create a one-page design in this chapter, using a template engine for
your project is not a bad idea. Whenever you decide to extend your project with one or
more other HTML pages, DRY coding your HTML will make your work more efficient and
reusable. Many HTML template languages and engines are available. Bootstrap uses the
Jekyll static site generator to enable you to run its documentation locally. Many templates
for Bootstrap CLI use Nunjucks now. In this chapter, you will meet Panini for Gulp. Panini
is a flat file compiler that uses the concepts of templates, pages, and partials powered by the
Handlebars templating language.
For the marketing example project, you'll have to create the following file and directory
structure, which holds your HTML templates:
In the preceding file and directory structure, the pages directory contains your pages. Each
page has a layout, which can be found in the layouts directory. Both pages and layouts
may include the HTML partials from the includes directory.
You can read more about Panini at h t t p : / / f o u n d a t i o n . z u r b . c o m / s i t e s d o c s / p a n i n i . h t m
l and h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / z u r b / p a n i n i /.

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 53 ]
Installing the Gulp task to compile the Panini
HTML templates
Run the following command to install the Panini compiler in your project:
npm install panini --save-dev
After installing the Panini compiler, add your HTML compile task to your
Gulpfile.js file as follows:
var panini = require('panini');
gulp.task('compile-html', function(cb) {
  gulp.src('html/pages/**/*.html')
    .pipe(panini({
      root: 'html/pages/',
      layouts: 'html/layouts/',
      partials: 'html/includes/',
      helpers: 'html/helpers/',
      data: 'html/data/'
    }))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('_site'));
    cb();
});
Now you can run the Gulp compile-html command in your console.
The compile-html task saves the compiled HTML templates to the _site directory. The
CSS and JavaScript tasks also save their products into this directory.
Validating the compiled HTML code
Bootlint is a tool that checks for several common HTML mistakes in web pages which are
built with Bootstrap. Bootstrap's components and widgets require their parts of the DOM to
conform to certain structures. Bootlint checks the HTML structure of your pages and
ensures that it is correct for these components. Bootlint also checks if the HTML document
contains the required meta tags.
Notice that Bootlint requires a valid HTML5 page in the first place. To ensure your code is
valid HTML we'll run another linter before we run Bootlint. Run the following command in
your console to install the gulp-html plugin:
    npm install gulp-html --save-dev
gulp-html is a Gulp plugin for HTML validation, using vnu.jar.

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 54 ]
Then install the gulp-bootlint plugin:
npm install gulp-bootlint --save-dev
You can easily initiate a html-validate task now, as follows:
var validator = require('gulp-html');
var bootlint  = require('gulp-bootlint');
gulp.task('validate-html', [compile-html], function() {
  gulp.src('_site/**/*.html')
    .pipe(validator())
    .pipe(bootlint());
});
Then the validate-html task should run after the compile-html task has finished. That's
why the second parameter of the validate-html task is set to [compile-html].
Read more about asynchronous task support in Gulp at h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / g u l p j s / g u l p
/ b l o b / m a s t e r / d o c s / A P I . m d # a s y n c - t a s k - s u p p o r t .
You should choose whether or not you run the validators in your build process by yourself.
You can easily remove the validate-html task from the HTML task:
gulp.task('html', ['compile-html','validate-html']);
Creating a static web server
Now that your tasks to compile your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code are ready, it's time to
show and inspect the result in your browser. Browsersync is a module that keeps your
browser in sync when developing your code. Browsersync works by injecting an
asynchronous script tag right after the <body> tag during initial request.
To use Browsersync with Gulp no special plugin is required; you can simply require()
the module.
First install Browsersync by running the following command:
      npm install browser-sync gulp --save-dev
Then create a task in your  Gulpfile.js file which may look like the following:
    var browser = require('browser-sync');
    var port = process.env.SERVER_PORT || 8080;
    // Starts a BrowerSync instance
    gulp.task('server', ['build'], function(){
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 55 ]
      browser.init({server: './_site', port: port});
    });
The server task depends on the build task (second argument ['build'] in the preceding
code) which means that the build task should run before the server task.
The server task starts a static web server running on port 8080 serving the files in the
temporary _site directory. The compiled files from the other tasks are saved in the _site
directory.
Start watching your file changes
When your static webserver is up and running you can add a watch task to your build
process. The watch task should trigger a task on file changes and reload the web browser.
Your watch task may look like the following:
// Watch files for changes
gulp.task('watch', function() {
  gulp.watch('scss/**/*', ['compile-sass', browser.reload]);
  gulp.watch('html/pages/**/*', ['compile-html']);
  gulp.watch(['html/{layouts,includes,helpers,data}/**/*'], ['compile-
html:reset','compile-html']);
});
The watch task watches your Sass files in the scss folder and your HTML templates in the
html folder. The compile-html task calls browser.reload after finishing as follows:
.on ('finish', browser.reload);
Also notice that file changes in the Panini files, except from the pages directory. Run the
compile-html:reset task before the compile-html task. The compile-html:reset
task calls panini.refresh() because Panini loads layouts, partials, helpers, and data files
once on the first run.
Copying and minifying your images
When your project uses images, you should copy them to the _site directory each time
you run the build process, because when you run the build process, the clean task removes
the temporary _site directory.

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 56 ]
You can save the images and all other assets in an asset directory and run the following
task to copy them to the _site directory:
// Copy assets
gulp.task('copy', function() {
  gulp.src(['assets/**/*']).pipe(gulp.dest('_site'));
});
In the case of images, you can consider to not only copy but also minify the images. You can
do this with the gulp-imagemin plugin.
You can read more about this plugin at h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / s i n d r e s o r h u s / g u l p - i m a g e m
i n.:
var gulp = require('gulp');
var imagemin = require('gulp-imagemin');
var pngquant = require('imagemin-pngquant');
gulp.task('default', () => {
    return gulp.src('assets/images/*')
        .pipe(imagemin({
            progressive: true,
            svgoPlugins: [
                {removeViewBox: false},
                {cleanupIDs: false}
            ],
            use: [pngquant()]
        }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('_site/images'));
});
Putting it all together and creating the
default task
At the end of the Gulpfile.js file we'll write down some tasks, including the default task,
which runs a sequence of tasks of the build process. These tasks may look like the
following:
gulp.task('set-development', development.task);
gulp.task('set-production', production.task);
gulp.task('test',['scss-lint','validate-html']);
gulp.task('build', ['clean','copy','compile-js','compile-sass','compile-
html']);
gulp.task('default', ['set-development','server', 'watch']);
gulp.task('deploy', ['set-production','server', 'watch']);
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 57 ]
The default task sets the environment to development by calling the set-development
task first. Then it runs the server task, and starts the watch task after that. Because the
server task depends on the build task, the build task always runs before the server
task (Browsersync) starts. The deploys task does the same as the default task, but sets the
environment to production in the first call.
The test task lints your SCSS code and checks the compiled HTML code. You can run the
test task by running the gulp test command in your console. The result of the test task may
look like the following:
    [00:15:02] Starting 'scss-lint'...
    [00:15:02] Starting 'compile-html'...
    [00:15:12] Finished 'compile-html' after 9.25 s

Now your build process is ready and you can start using it! To start your build process
you'll have to run the following command in your console:
    gulp
The gulp command runs the default tasks. It starts a static webserver and automatically
watches for file changes.

Using the build process to finish your
project
At the start of this chapter, I have shown you a screenshot of a responsive mobile-first one-
page marketing site built with Bootstrap. In the rest of the chapter, I will guide you to build
this site using the Gulp build process you have created in the preceding sections.
You will have to split up the HTML page into different parts in accordance with the HTML
template structure you have already created.
The project will have a single breakpoint at 768 pixels. For viewports wider than 768 pixels,
the navigation menu will become horizontal and other adoptions are made.
The layout template
As already mentioned, you'll use Panini to modularize your HTML code. Panini helps you
to avoid code duplications in your HTML code.
Panini is powered by the Handlebars templating language. I highly recommend you to read
Panini's documentation at the following URL: h t t p : / / f o u n d a t i o n . z u r b . c o m / s i t e s / d o c s /
p a n i n i . h t m l.
The index.html file, our main page, will only contain the following content :
---
layout: default
title: Home
---
{{> features}}
Apart from the includes/features.html page, included with the {{> features}}
snippet, the index.html file loads all other HTML code from the default template
(layouts/default.html). The default template is a common layout that every page in
your design shares.
The code of the default template may look like the following:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags always come first -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1,
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 59 ]
shrink-to-fit=no">
    <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title> Your Company :: {{title}}</title>
    <!--Bootstrap CSS -->
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{root}}css/app.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    {{> header}}
    {{> navigationheader}}
    {{> body}}
    {{> footer}}
    {{> footerjavascripts}}
  </body>
</html>
In this template the {{> body}} snippet includes the HTML code of the index.html file.
The index.html file is the first page of your project. The layout default declaration tells
Panini to use the default template found in the html/layouts/default.html file.
And the {{> header}} snippet includes a HTML partial in your page. The partial included
with the {{> header}} declaration can be found in the html/includes/header.html
file.
In the next section, you'll develop the page header. Before you start, run the gulp
command, which runs the default task, and you will directly see the results of your work in
your browser.
The page header
Resize your browser so that your viewport is smaller than 768px. The page header should
look like that shown in the following screenshot:
Start writing the HTML code for your page header in the
html/includes/header.html file.

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 60 ]
The first version of the HTML code should look like the following:
  <header class="page-header">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12"><h1
class="display-4">Your<span>Company</span></h1></div>
        <div class="col-xs-12">
            <form class="form-inline">
            <input class="form-control" type="text" placeholder="Search">
            <button class="btn btn-outline-success"
type="submit">Search</button>
            </form>
        </div>
        </div>
      </div>
  </header>
The HTML starts with a header element with a page-header class. After the <header>
element follows a <div> element with the container class. Containers are the most basic
layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using the grid system. The responsive
grid system has 12 columns and four breakpoints. The breakpoint defines the five grids: the
extra small grid, the small grid, the medium grid, the large grid and the extra large grid.
Inside the container, we create a row as a <div> element with the row class. Columns inside
the row are set with col-{grid}-* classes. You can read more about Bootstrap grids and
responsive features in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap.
In the row, we create two columns. The first column contains the company name, and the
second column the search form. On small viewports this columns should span 100% of the
viewport and be stacked. We'll use the col-xs-12 class to accomplish that. The naming of
the col-xs-12 class means spanning 12 columns on the extra small (xs) grid. The col-
xs-12 class (although it sets width:100%; and float: left;) equals the default situation
due to the box-sizing: border-box declaration. The box-sizing model is explained in
more detail in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap. In the border-box model, block-level
elements occupy the entire space of its parent element (container). For this reason, the col-
xs-12 class can be considered as optional.
For the company name a <h1> element with a display-3 class has been used. We'll also
use a  <span> element inside the <h1> to enable us to use two colors for the company
name.
For the search form in the second column, a default inline form, set with the  form-
inline class and an outlined button, are used.

Now with your HTML code, you can start creating your custom CSS.
Custom CSS code for the page header
Of course, we'll use Sass to build our custom CSS code. For the page header create a new
scss/includes/_page-header.scss Sass partial. This partial should be imported in the
scss/app.scss file:
    @import "includes/page-header";
Import the partial after Bootstrap so you can reuse Bootstrap mixins and extend the
Bootstrap classes when needed. The SCSS code in the scss/includes/_page-
header.scss file may look like the following:
    .page-header {
      background-color: $page-header-background;
      .display-3 {
        color: $company-primary-color;
        span {
          color: $lightest-color;
        }
      }
      [class^="col-"]:last-child {
        margin-top: $spacer-y * 2;
      }
    }
Instead of the [class^="col-"]:last-child selector in the preceding code, you can also
use a new selector/class, for instance a .search-form-column class, and change your
HTML code according to this new CSS class.
The color variables used in the preceding SCSS are declared in
the scss/includes/_variables.scss  file as follows:
$darkest-color: #000; // black;
$lighest-color: #fff; // white;
$company-primary-color: #f80; //orange;
// Page Header
$page-header-background: $darkest-color;

Fine tuning of your CSS and HTML code
When you resize your browser smaller than 544 pixels you'll find some issues.
First the search button wraps to the next line. Bootstrap's inline-form class only works for
screens wider than 544 pixels. You can overwrite the Bootstrap default behavior and use the
following SCSS code:
.page-header {
  .form-inline .form-control {
    display: inline-block;
    width: auto;
  }
}
Alternatively, you can remove the search button for the smallest screen by adding the
hidden-xs-down class. The hidden-xs-down class makes elements invisible on only the
extra small (xs) grid.
Secondly, you'll possibly find that the font size of the company name is too large to fit the
smallest screens. You can use the media-breakpoint-down()mixins, as already described
in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap, to make the font size smaller for the narrowest
screens:
.page-header {
  @include media-breakpoint-down(xs) {
    .display-3 {
      padding-bottom: $spacer-y;
      font-size: $display4-size;
      text-align: center;
    }
  }
}
Then you should switch to the larger screen, and resize your browser to a screen width
wider than 768 pixels.
The columns should become horizontal with each having 50% (six columns) of the available
space inside the container. On each grid, the container has a fixed width; for screens wider
than 1200 pixels, the container always has a width of 1140 pixels.
You can accomplish this by adding the col-md-6 class twice:
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6"><h1
class="display-3">Your<span>Company</span></h1></div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 63 ]
The search box should float on the right side of the header. The right floating is done with
the pull-md-right class as follows:
<form class="form-inline pull-md-right">
The pull-md-right helper class sets a float: right for the medium grid and up, so the
compiled CSS code looks like this:
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .pull-md-right {
    float: right !important;
  }
}
While building the page header, you have possibly noticed that the company name and
search box may overlap on the medium grid for screen width between 768 and 992 pixels.
You can solve this issue by replacing the col-md-6 classes with the col-lg-6 classes or
alternatively modifying the CSS code so that the font size of the company name is smaller
for a larger range of breakpoints. You can use the SCSS code, in the
scss/includes/_page-header.scss file, as follows, to do this:
   @include media-breakpoint-down(md) {
    .display-3 {
      padding-bottom: $spacer-y;
      font-size: $display4-size;
      text-align: center;
    }
  }
And finally, you can do a last tweak in the scss/includes/_page-header.scss file to
apply the margin-top for the search box that is set only for the larger screens:
  @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    [class^="col-"]:last-child {
      margin-top: $spacer-y * 2;
    }
  }
Styling the navbar and hero unit
The navbar and the hero unit are wrapped in a <section> element, which has the 
background image. The HTML code in the html/includes/navigationheader.html
template looks as follows:

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 64 ]
<section class="nature">
        <header>
        {{> navbar}}
        </header>
        {{> jumbotron}}
</section>
Create a new scss/includes/_navigationheader.scss Sass partial, which contains the
following SCSS code:
// free photo from
https://www.pexels.com/photo/landscape-nature-sunset-trees-479/
.nature {
  background-image:url('/images/landscape-nature-sunset-trees.jpg');
}
Notice that you should save a copy of the landscape-nature-sunset-trees.jpg photo
file in the assets/images/ directory of your project. As already made clear, this image file
is automatically copied to the temporary _site/images directory every time you run the
build process.
For the navbar, we'll create a html/includes/navbar.html HTML template and an
scss/includes/_navbar.scss Sass partial too. In these files, we reuse the code for the
responsive navbar from Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap.
You should change the scss/includes/_navbar.scss file to set the background color of
the navbar:
.navbar {
  //background: transparent;
  background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5);
  //@include gradient-horizontal(green, white);
}
Notice that in the preceding SCSS code two alternative backgrounds are commented out.
You can try the alternative by removing the comment (and commenting out the others). If
you have run the gulp command already you'll see the effects directly in your browser.
Consider saving the background value in a variable and save it in the
scss/includes/_variables.scss file for code that can be more easily reused:
$navbar-background: rgba(255,255,255,0.5);
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 65 ]
There is also nothing wrong with creating a new class for the navbar's background color:
.bg-nature {
 background: $navbar-background;
}
Then your HTML code should appear as follows:
<nav class="navbar navbar-dark bg-nature navbar-full" role="navigation">
For the hero unit, we'll use the HTML code for the Jumbotron component directly from
Bootstrap's documentation. Save the HTML code into the
html/includes/jumbotron.html file. Also now create a
scss/includes/_jumbotron.scss Sass partial.
The HTML code in the html/includes/jumbotron.html file will look like the following:
      <div class="container">
        <div class="jumbotron">
          <h1 class="display-3">Hello, world!</h1>
          <p class="lead">This is a simple hero unit, a simple jumbotron-
style component for calling extra attention to featured content or
information.</p>
          <hr class="m-y-2">
          <p>It uses utility classes for typography and spacing to space
content out within the larger container.</p>
          <p class="lead">
            <a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg" href="#" role="button">Learn
more</a>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
Beside the container, display-* and btn-* classes you'll also find some new Bootstrap
CSS classes. The lead class simply makes a paragraph stand out. The <hr> element has a
 m-y-2 helper class, which sets the horizontal margins to two times the height of the
$spacer-y value. The m-y-2 helper class is an example of Bootstrap's utility classes, which
enable you to set the spacing (padding and margin) of an element.

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 66 ]
These utility classes are named using the format {property}-{sides}-{size}, where
property is either p (padding) or m (margin), sides are l (left), r (right), t (top), b (bottom), x
(left and right), or y (top and bottom), and the size is a value between 0 and 3, including 0
and 3, meaning {size} time $spacing-x or $spacing-y.
Then edit the following SCSS code in the scss/includes/_jumbotron.scss file:
 .jumbotron {
  background-color: transparent;
  color: $lightest-color;
}
On smaller screens the navigation header should look like that shown in the following
screenshot:
Now the navigation and hero units are ready and we can start styling the features as a part
of our design.
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 67 ]
Styling the features
Directly under the hero unit, the design shows three features. A single feature may look like
that shown in the following screenshot. Each feature starts with a rounded image, which
may contain a photo or icon followed by a heading and a text paragraph. At the end, you
will find a button which is a Call to action.
On screens smaller than 768 pixels, the features should display under each other. On wider
screens, the features become horizontal and form three equal width columns like those
shown in the following screenshot:
Again we create two files: the html/includes/features.html HTML template and a
scss/includes/_features.scss Sass partial.

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 68 ]
The structure of the HTML code in the html/includes/features.html HTML template
may look like the following (notice that in the HTML code, the features are left out):
    <div class="container features">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <!-- first feature -->
        </div><!-- /.col-md-4 -->
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <!-- second feature -->
        </div><!-- /.col-md-4 -->
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <!-- third feature -->
        </div><!-- /.col-md-4 -->
      </div><!-- /.row -->
    </div>
As you can see, we'll use the Bootstrap grid again to display the features. You already know
the container and row classes. The col-md-4 class creates a space spanning 4 of 12 grid
columns on the medium (md) grid and up. The optional col-xs-12 classes are left out here.
The HTML code for each feature may look like the following:
          <img class="img-circle"
src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lG...CRAEAOw==" alt="Generic placeholder
image" height="140" width="140">
          <h2>Heading</h2>
          <p>Donec sed odio dui. .....</p>
          <p><a class="btn btn-primary" href="#" role="button">View details
&raquo;</a></p>
The img-circle class automatically creates rounded views of your images. You can
replace the src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lG...CRAEAOw==" image source with
your own images.
Read more about using the data-URIs for your images at h t t p s : / / c s s - t r
i c k s . c o m / d a t a - u r i s /.
Now you'll have to create some CSS code to tweak the features' look and feel. Write down
the following SCSS code in the scss/includes/_features.scss file:
.features {
  padding-top: $spacer-y;
  [class^="col-"] {
www.ebook3000.com

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 69 ]
    text-align: center;
  }
}
Instead of creating some new CSS code you can also consider to use Bootstrap's predefined
CSS classes to accomplish the same.
You can use the utility classes to set the padding-top of the features as follows:
    <div class="container features p-t-1">
And the text-xs-center class can be used to center the content of the features on all
viewports:
    <div class="col-md-4 text-xs-center">
Now the features are ready, too. Time to style the footer and finish your project.
Styling the footer of your page
Last but not least, we'll have to style the footer links to finalize our project. Again create an
HTML template and a Sass partial to do this.
The html/includes/footer.html HTML template should contain HTML like the
following:
<footer class="page-footer">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="pull-xs-right">
            <a href="https://twitter.com/bassjobsen"><i class="fa fa-
twitter fa-lg"></i></a>
            <a href="https://facebook.com/bassjobsen"><i class="fa fa-
facebook fa-lg"></i></a>
            <a href="http://google.com/+bassjobsen"><i class="fa fa-google-

            <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/1596547/bass-jobsen"><i

            <a href="https://github.com/bassjobsen"><i class="fa fa-github

        </div>
        <div>&copy; 2016 Bass Jobsen &middot; <a href="#">Privacy</a>
&middot;<a href="#">Terms</a></div>
      </div>
</footer>

Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp
[ 70 ]
The footer of our page is simple and straightforward. It contains some copyright notes and
a block of social links. The social links are floated on the right side of the footer by the
pull-xs-right class. The icons of the social links are from the Font Awesome icon font.
The fa-* CSS classes are not part of Bootstrap's CSS code.
In Chapter 4, Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio, you can read about how to compile Font
Awesome's CSS code into your local CSS by using Sass. Simply load Font Awesome's CSS
code from CDN by linking it in the html/layouts/default.html HTML template as
follows:
      <link rel="stylesheet"
href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.m
in.css">
All that remains to do is to give the background, links, and icons for the right colors and
add some spacing. You can do this by entering the following SCSS code into the
scss/includes/_ page-footer.scss Sass partial:
.page-footer {
  background-color: $page-footer-background;
  color: $lightest-color;
  a {
    @include plain-hover-focus {
      color: $lightest-color;
    }
  }
  padding: $spacer-y 0;
  margin-top: $spacer-y;
}
The preceding code uses Bootstrap's plain-hover-focus() mixin which sets the plain,
hovered, and focused states at once and uses the Media Queries Level 4 hover @media
feature as discussed previously.
Again notice that the margin and padding can also be set by using Bootstrap's utility
classes. Using p-y-1 and m-t-1 will have the same effect:
<footer class="page-footer p-y-1 m-t-1">
That's all! You did a great job till now!

Running your template with Bootstrap CLI
In this chapter, you have created a build process which builds and compiles your single
page template by running the gulp command. In this book, you'll use Bootstrap CLI to set
up your projects.
Bootstrap CLI enables you to choose your own starter templates. These starter templates
also have a Gulp (or Grunt) build chain. For instance the source code of the Bootstrap 
material design template can be found at h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / b a s s j o b s e n / b o o t s t r a p - m a
t e r i a l - d e s i g n - s t y l e g u i d e. Bootstrap CLI downloads the templates from GitHub and its
commands call npm to run scripts.
To make your build process and template ready for Bootstrap CLI, you simply add the npm
script calls to your package.json file as follows:
  "scripts": {
    "build": "gulp deploy",
    "start": "gulp"
  }
JavaScript task runners are not required
In this chapter, you have learned how to create a build process with Gulp. Both Gulp and
Grunt are JavaScript task runners for Node.js. In the previous section you could see that
Bootstrap CLI calls npm to run your scripts. For the same reason, some people claim that
you can create a build process without Gulp or Grunt too.

/ w h y - w e - s h o u l d - s t o p - u s i n g - g r u n t /.
Publishing your work on GitHub
Since your template is ready to use, you may consider publishing it on GitHub. Other
people may use your work, but on the other hand, they can also help you to improve it.

i t h u b . c o m / i n t r o d u c t i o n / g e t t i n g - y o u r - p r o j e c t - o n - g i t h u b /.
Since you have installed both the Bower packages and the Gulp plugins with the --save-
dev option, your bower.json and package.json files contain an up-to-date list with the
project dependencies. When publishing your project, you do not have to publish the
dependencies too. People can download your project files and then install the dependencies
by running the following commands:
    bower install
    npm install
After the running the install command, they can run your project with the gulp
command; also the bootstrap watch command of Bootstrap CLI should work.
You can create a .gitignore file to ensure that only your project files are uploaded to
GitHub. Your .gitignore file should contain the following lines of paths:
.DS_Store
bower_components
node_modules
npm-debug.log
_site
.sass-cache
Summary
In this chapter, you have learned how to create a build process for your Bootstrap projects
with Gulp. You can reuse the build process for your newer projects. The build process
compiles your Sass code into CSS code, prepares your JavaScript code, and runs a static web
server to test the results. In the end, you built a single page marketing web page with most
of Bootstrap's code and components, and some little tweaks. The build process you have
created before compiles your code and enables you to test it.
Some tweaks require some knowledge about Sass. Hence, in the following chapter we will
discuss Sass in more detail and use it to customize Bootstrap to create a design for your
blog.

Customizing Your Blog with
Bootstrap and Sass
In this chapter, you will study Sass in detail. Sass is a preprocessor for CSS. The Sass team
says:
“Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language
in the world.”
The CSS code of Bootstrap is built with Sass. In this chapter, you will build a simple design
with mostly Bootstrap components. You will use Sass to modify and extend Bootstrap's
code. At the beginning of the chapter, you will read about the features Sass adds to CSS and
how it helps you to code your CSS more efficiently and in a DRY manner.
After reading this chapter, you will:
Understand the power of Sass
Know how to modify Bootstrap's CSS
Know how to extend Bootstrap's CSS code
Know how to reuse Bootstrap's Sass mixin
Expected results and the process
You will deploy a design for your web blog with Bootstrap with the help of this chapter.
The design is built with standard Bootstrap components and some little tweaks. After a
short introduction to Sass, we'll start using Sass to modify and extend Bootstrap's CSS code
to fit your requirements.

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 74 ]
The end result of your efforts should look like that shown in the following screenshot:
The preceding screenshot shows the design for small screens, smaller than 768 pixels wide.
We'll use a single breakpoint at 768 pixels. For screens wider than 768 pixels, the navigation
becomes horizontal and new features will be added. For wider screens, the final result
should look like that shown in the following screenshot:

Setting up your project and requirements
For this project, you'll use Bootstrap CLI again as it helps you to create a setup for your
project comfortably. Bootstrap CLI requires you to have Node.js and Gulp already installed
on your system.
Now create a new project by running the following command in your console:
bootstrap new
Enter the name of your project and choose the An empty new Bootstrap project. Powered by
Panini, Sass and Gulp template. Now your project is ready to start with your design work.
However, before you start, let's first go through the introduction to Sass and the strategies
for customization.

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 76 ]
The power of Sass in your project
Sass is a preprocessor for CSS code and is an extension of CSS3 which adds nested rules,
variables, mixins, functions, selector inheritance, and more. In the following section, you
can read how Sass extends the CSS syntax and helps you to DRY code your CSS.
Nested rules
Nested rules greatly enhance the efficiency of composing styles. For example, writing 
selectors in CSS can be highly repetitive:
.navbar-nav { ... }
.navbar-nav > li { ... }
.navbar-nav > li > a { ... }
.navbar-nav > li > a:hover,
.navbar-nav > li > a:focus { ... }
This same set of selectors and their styles can be written much more easily in Sass, by means
of a simple nesting pattern as shown in the following SCSS code:
.navbar-nav { ...
  > li { ...
    > a { ...
      &:hover,
      &:focus { ... }
    }
  }
}
Once compiled, these rules come out as standard CSS. But, the nesting pattern makes the
Sass styles much easier to write and maintain in some situations. Also notice that in the 
preceding code, the & parent reference has been used. The & parent reference refers to the
parent selector when nesting. Consider the following SCSS code:
.link {
  &:hover {
    color: black;
  }
}
The preceding SCSS code compiles into CSS as follows:
.link:hover {
  color: black;
}
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 77 ]
Without the & parent reference, there will be a space before the :hover selector.
Bootstrap's Sass code avoids child and element selectors. Nesting is mostly only used for
states. When we take the preceding navbar example into account, you'll find that
Bootstrap's SCSS may look similar to the following:
  .navbar-nav {
    .nav-link {
      color: $navbar-dark-color;
      @include hover-focus {
        color: $navbar-dark-hover-color;
      }
    }
  }
The states (:hover and :focus) are set with the hover-focus() mixin. This mixin also
applies the Media Queries Level 4 hover @media feature when the $enable-hover-
media-query variable has been set to true.
Consider the following SCSS code:
$enable-hover-media-query: true;
a {
  @include hover-focus {
    color: green;
  }
}
The preceding code compiles into CSS code as follows:
a:focus {
  color: green; }
@media (hover: hover) {
  a:hover {
    color: green; } }
You can read more about mixins further on in this chapter.
Notice that the hover-focus() mixin also uses the & parent reference to
set the :hover and :focus selectors:

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 78 ]
Variables
Variables make it possible to specify a value once (or revise it), and then use it automatically
(or updated) throughout your entire style sheet. For example, we may use color variables,
such as the following:
@off-white:  #e5e5e5;
@brand-primary:  #890000;
When we update the value of these variables, we can automatically update colors
throughout the site. This is because we have used the variables throughout our SASS files in
rules, such as the following:
a {
  color: @brand-primary;
}
.navbar {
  background-color: @brand-primary;
  .nav-link {
  color: @off-white;
  }
}
Every variable should be declared before using it. The !default declaration enables you to
set default values, for instance:
@off-white:  #e5e5e5 !default;
The preceding code enables us to write Sass code which can be easily modified by changing
the values of the default variables. Consider the following SCSS code:
$dark-color: darkblue;
$dark-color: darkgreen !default;
p {
  color: $dark-color;
}
The preceding CSS code compiles into CSS code as follows:
p {
  color: darkblue;
}
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 79 ]
All of Bootstrap's variables can be found in a single and well documented partial file called
_variables.scss. These variables are all declared with !default. As you have seen, you
can easily overwrite these variables by putting a new declaration before the @import of the
_variables.scss file into the project.
Those who are used to Less instead of Sass should realize that Sass does
not apply lazy loading and the last declaration wins strategy for variables. You
can also not declare variables afterward in Sass.
Mixins
Mixins make it possible to generate an entire set of rules using concise and easy-to-manage
formulations. For example, we can simplify the task of applying the different states to the
<a> tag or other elements.
As an example, I will again show you Bootstrap hover-focus() mixin mentioned
previously. These mixins will look like the following:
@mixin hover-focus {
  @if $enable-hover-media-query {
    &:focus { @content }
    @include hover { @content }
  }
  @else {
    &:focus,
    &:hover {
      @content
    }
  }
}
Then, we can use this mixin wherever needed:
.page-link {
  @include hover-focus() {
    color: tomato;
  }
}

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 80 ]
When compiled, each element will get its essential lines of CSS. The previous compiled CSS
code, with the $enable-hover-media-query variable has been set to false. It will look like
the following:
.page-link:focus, .page-link:hover {
  color: tomato; }
Earlier versions of Bootstrap also had many mixins to add the vendor-prefixes to the
compiled CSS code. This helped people to write single line declarations for properties that
require one or more vendor prefixes for cross-browser support. Due to the usage of mixins
one could also simply remove or add a prefix for a certain property in a single place.
Nowadays vendor prefixes are added automatically as already described in Chapter 2,
Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp.
Operations
Operations make it possible to do math, including math with variables. We can start with
one color, and then lighten or darken it to get variations as follows:
a:hover { darken(@link-color, 15%); }
In the preceding SCSS code, darken() is a built-in color function of Sass. Sass contains
many built-in functions for color, string, number, list, maps, and selector operations which
you can use for your operations. You can even add your own functions to Sass.
An overview of Sass's built-in functions can be found at h t t p : / / s a s s - l a n
g . c o m / d o c u m e n t a t i o n / S a s s / S c r i p t / F u n c t i o n s . h t m l.
We can also calculate padding values for the grid. Thus, the following lines from
Bootstrap's mixins/_grid.scss file sets the container class padding values to the amount
of the $gutter value divided by two:
@mixin make-container($gutter: $grid-gutter-width) {
  margin-left: auto;

The mixins/_grid.scss file in the preceding code is part of Bootstrap's source code and
can be found in the bower_components folder.
Importing files
The Sass compiling process makes it possible to import and combine multiple files into a
single, unified CSS file. We can specify the order of import, and organize the resulting style
sheet precisely as needed for our desired cascade.
Thus, Bootstrap's import file, bootstrap.scss, begins with imports for essential variables
and mixins. Then, it imports a Sass version of normalize.css (in place of a CSS reset),
followed by basic styles for print media. Then, it moves to core styles, including the new
reboot module (_reboot.scss), typographic fundamentals (_type.scss), and more
specific details. Thus, the first several lines of the current bootstrap.scss file are given as
follows:
// Core variables and mixins
@import "variables";
@import "mixins";
// Reset and dependencies
@import "normalize";
@import "print";
The resulting CSS file will be a single, unified whole, with styles cascading down from the
general to the specific, from components to the utilities, just as they should.
The modular file organization
Because of the ability to import distinct files into a unified whole, we may easily organize
our styles in coherent groupings and maintain them in distinct files. This is why Bootstrap
comes with so many Sass files, one dedicated to navbar styles, another to buttons, another
for alerts, one for carousel styles, and so on, all imported using the bootstrap.scss file.
For these reasons and others, Sass and its cousin preprocessors are more than a fad. They
have become part of the standard practice for professional web development. Most
developers agree that they point to the future of CSS.

Using the SCSS-linter for cleaner and more
readable code
In Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp, you can read about how to
integrate the SCSS-lint tool in your build process. You can also use this tool on the
command line to check your code.
The SCSS-lint tool not only checks the syntax and code style but can also help you to write
more reusable code. When you enable the  ColorVariable check in your configuration
file, you'll get a warning when you use hardcoded color values in your code. Assigning
colors to variables is better in most cases because this enables you to reuse the color values
and change them only in a single place.
Notice that you also should choose your variable names with care to write readable and
reusable code.
Some hints can be found at
http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-name-your-sass
-variables-modularly–webdesign-13364 and h t t p : / / s a c h a g r e i f . c o m / s
a s s - c o l o r - v a r i a b l e s /.
Bootstrap itself also uses the two-tier system, with both functional and descriptive variable
names, as suggested by Sacha Greif.
Strategies for customization with Sass
Depending on your own experience and ideas, you can choose different strategies to reuse
Bootstrap's Sass code to create your custom CSS code. Each strategy has its own cons and
pros and depending on your needs you can use one or more of these strategies together to
reach your targets.
In this book, I will demonstrate usages of each strategy and try to show you alternatives if
applicable.
Using variables for customization
As you already know, variables enable you to define commonly used values at a single
place. Bootstrap ships with a long list of variables, found in scss/_variables.scss.
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 83 ]
These variables are well organized and documented. Let's take the $brand-primary
variable as an example; it is used to assign some other variables too. In Bootstrap's
scss/_variables.scss file, you will find:
$link-color:                 $brand-primary !default;
$component-active-bg:        $brand-primary !default;
$btn-primary-bg:             $brand-primary !default;
$pagination-active-bg:       $brand-primary !default;
$pagination-active-border:   $brand-primary !default;
$label-primary-bg:           $brand-primary !default;
$progress-bar-bg:            $brand-primary !default;
And also in some other Sass files, you can find usage of the $brand-primary variable:
scss/_utilities-background.scss: @include bg-variant('.bg-primary', $brand-
primary);
scss/_card.scss:  @include card-variant($brand-primary, $brand-primary);
scss/_utilities.scss: @include text-emphasis-variant('.text-primary',
$brand-primary);
All these variables in the preceding code are used to build Bootstrap's predefined CSS
classes. You can use them to set the colors and styles of the components. You can style, for
instance, the buttons and progress bars with the btn-primary and progress-primary
classes respectively. And the bg-variant() mixin generates a contextual background in
the color of the $brand-primary variable. The HTML code of a button may look like the
following:
<button class="btn btn-primary">Button</button>
If your design is built with components having the *-primary classes set, you can simply
change the look and feel of it by modifying the value of the $brand-primary variable.
In this chapter, we'll declare a new set of variables and keep Bootstrap's default values.
Also, when you add some custom Sass code in the project, you can use Bootstrap's
variables. The $spacer(-*) variables can be used to set margins and paddings. The
following SCSS code will show you how to set the padding-top property using Bootstrap's
variables:
main {
    article {
      padding-top: $spacer-y;
    }
}

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 84 ]
Notice that the SCSS code uses the main selector. Bootstrap's Sass code
avoids element selectors. Instead of the main selector, you can also create a
main class or even a main-article class. Using classes instead of element
selectors will make the CSS code easier to reuse, and on the other hand
you will have to add extra CSS to your HTML.
Extending Bootstrap's predefined CSS classes
Sass has an @extend feature. The @extend feature makes it possible for one selector to
extend the styles from the other one. The following example will show you how the
@extend feature works:
$primary-color-dark:   #303F9F;
.selector1 {
  color: $primary-color-dark;
}
.selector2 {
  @extend .selector1;
}
The SCSS compiles into CSS code as follows:
.selector1, .selector2 {
  color: #303F9F; }
This can be very effective, but also complex when your code is nested. When you only use
the new selector2 class in your HTML, it also will create some unused selectors in your
CSS code.
Placeholder selectors can be used for reusable selectors which do not create unused CSS
code. Placeholders look like normal selectors but start with a % sign and do not output the
compiled CSS code:
$primary-color-dark:   #303F9F;
%selector1 {
  color: $primary-color-dark;
}
.selector2 {
  @extend %selector1;
}
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 85 ]
The preceding SCSS code with the %selector1 compiles into CSS code as follows:
.selector2 {
  color: #303F9F; }
Bootstrap's Sass code avoids the @extend feature and for that reason also
does not contain placeholder selectors.
In Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap, you can read how to make your images
responsive, by default, by extending the fluid-img class.
(Re)Using Bootstrap's mixins
When creating custom CSS code for a project, you can reuse Bootstrap's mixins.
Instead of changing Bootstrap's variables to create a custom button, you can also create a
custom button by using the following SCSS code:
.btn-accent-color {
  @include button-variant(#fff, $accent-color, #fff);
}
Now you can use the following HTML code to create a button in your custom $accent-
color color:
<button class="btn btn-primary">Button</button>
When working with floating elements in your HTML by setting the float property you
will also have to clear the float in some situations. A CSS clearfix enables you to clear the
float(s) without having to use any additional markup.
You can read more about floats at h t t p s : / / c s s - t r i c k s . c o m / a l l - a b o u t -
f l o a t s/.
Bootstrap has its own mixin to provide the clearfix; you can reuse this mixin in your custom
SCSS code too:
.selector {
   @include clearfix();
}

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 86 ]
Later on in this chapter, I will show you how to use Bootstrap's Sass mixins (and variables)
to create a semantic grid yourself.
Bootstrap's mixins enable you to use Bootstrap's CSS in non-Bootstrap projects too. Of
course, you can also use others Sass code in your Bootstrap projects as described in the
following section.
Sass functions
In the preceding sections, you have read about Sass's built-in functions. You can also define
custom functions in Sass. Functions do not set CSS properties such as mixins, but return a
value. The following SCSS code will show you a simple example of a Sass function:
 @function three-times($x) {
  @return 3 * $x;
}
p {
  margin: three-times(4)px;
}
In the preceding SCSS code, the three-times() function returns three times the input
value, so the compiled CSS code will look like this:
 p {
  margin: 12 px; }
Reusing others' code
Many other projects use Sass too. You can easily import files from other non-Bootstrap
projects in your project. The preceding section enables you to use mixins already built by
others in your project. Mixins do not generate output in the compiled CSS unless you call
them.
In this chapter, you will use some mixins found on the Web to generate CSS triangles.
Compass
Compass is a CSS authoring framework that brings you various helpers to write CSS code.
Compass requires Ruby, so to use Compass' helpers in your Bootstrap project, you will
have to replace the gulp-sass plugin with the gulp-ruby-sass plugin in your Gulp
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 87 ]
build process. The gulp-ruby-sass plugin enables you to use Compass' helpers by setting
the compass option to true.
You can read more about the Compass framework at h t t p : / / c o m p a s s - s t
y l e . o r g.
Writing your own custom SCSS code
Now that you know the basics of Sass, you are ready to start your own custom CSS code.
Remember the blog website layout I showed you at the start of this chapter?
As you already have seen in Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp, we do
not only modularize our CSS code but also the HTML code. The HTML templates are
compiled with Panini and can be found in the html folder of our project.
The color scheme
You will start your project with a color scheme. Open the
scss/includes/_variables.scss file. This file contains a copy of Bootstrap's variables.
You can remove these variables since we'll use Bootstrap's defaults with a few exceptions.
Now write the following SCSS code in the scss/includes/_variables.scss file:
$primary-color-dark:   #303f9f;
$primary-color:        #3f51b5;
$primary-color-light:  #c5cae9;
$accent-color:         #ff5722;
$accent-color-light:   #ffab91;
$dark-color:           #000;
$light-color:          #fff;
You can run the gulp or bootstrap watch command in your console to start a browser at
http://localhost:8080 to see your work in progress.
After adding the color scheme, your project is still empty. Time to start your first tweak.
Add the following SCSS code to the end of the file:
$body-bg:    $gray-lighter;
$body-color: $dark-color;
$link-color: $accent-color;

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 88 ]
The $gray-lighter variable in the preceding code is part of Bootstrap's default variables.
You can't use it without copying the default Bootstrap color values to the beginning of the
local _variables.scss file, since the local _variables.scss file is imported before the
original Bootstrap file.
The preceding code overwrites Bootstrap's default color values for the background and font
colors of the <body> element and changes the colors of the hyperlinks.
At the end the content of the scss/includes/_variables.scss file may look like the
following:
// Colors
//
// Grayscale and brand colors for use across Bootstrap.
$gray-dark:                 #373a3c;
$gray:                      #55595c;
$gray-light:                #818a91;
$gray-lighter:              #eceeef;
$gray-lightest:             #f7f7f9;
$brand-primary:             #0275d8;
$brand-success:             #5cb85c;
$brand-info:                #5bc0de;
$brand-warning:             #f0ad4e;
$brand-danger:              #d9534f;
// Theme colors
$primary-color-dark:       #303f9f;
$primary-color:            #3f51b5;
$primary-color-light:      #c5cae9;
$accent-color:             #ff5722;
$accent-color-light:       #ffab91 !default;
$dark-color:               #000 !default;
$light-color:              #fff !default;
$body-bg:    $gray-lighter !default;
$body-color: $dark-color !default;
$link-color: $accent-color !default;
Preparing the HTML templates
Firstly, change the default layout so that it will meet our requirements. Edit the
html/layouts/default.html file and change the <body> section to use some partials.
The <body> section should look like the HTML code shown here:
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 89 ]
  <body>
    {{> page-header}}
    {{> navbar}}
    <div class="main-content container bg-dark">
        <div class="row">
          <main class="col-md-9" role="content">
            {{> body}}
          </main>
          <aside class="col-md-3">
            {{> sidebar}}
          </aside>
        </div>
    </div>
    {{> footer}}
    {{> footerjavascripts}}
  </body>
Then create the page-header.html, navbar.html, sidebar.html and footer.html
templates in the html/includes directory according to the structure in the preceding
HTML code. Since we also modularize our Sass code, you can also create the following Sass
partials in the scss/includes/ directory: _page-header.scss, _navbar.scss,
_sidebar.scss, and _footer.scss.
The {{> body}} snippet in the layout will be replaced with the content of the files in the
html/pages directory. In this example, the html/pages directory only contains an
index.html file. Since we're creating a blog layout, we also create a
scss/includes/_blog.scss partial for the styles of the main content which contains blog
entries.
And last but not least, these new Sass partials should be imported in the scss/app.scss
file:
@import "includes/variables";
@import "includes/bootstrap";
// page elements
@import "includes/page-header";
@import "includes/navbar";
@import "includes/sidebar";
@import "includes/footer";
// pages
@import "includes/blog";
Now your file structure is ready too and you can start styling the page header.

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 90 ]
Styling the page header
The HTML code for the page header, in the html/includes/page-header.html file, may
look like the following:
<header class="container bg-primary-color-dark">
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <h1 class="display-3">Your blog</h1>
      </div>
  </div>
</header>
Apart from the bg-primary-color-dark class, all CSS classes in the preceding HTML
code are predefined Bootstrap CSS classes.
The SCSS code for the the bg-primary-color-dark class in the scss/includes/_page-
header.scss file may simply look like that shown here:
.bg-primary-color-dark {
  color: $light-color;
  background-color: $primary-color-dark;
}
Instead of the custom SCSS code, you can also use Bootstrap's bg-variant() mixin for
contextual backgrounds:
@include bg-variant('.bg-primary-color-dark', $primary-color-dark);
Notice that the bg-variant() mixin sets the font color to white always
and declares the colors with the !important declaration.
The preceding solution requires modifications of the SCSS and HTML because you have to
add the CSS classes to your HTML code. You can accomplish this in the
html/includes/page-header.html file, without any CSS class in the HTML:
<header>
  <div>
      <div>
        <h1>Your blog</h1>
      </div>
  </div>
</header>
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 91 ]
You can use the following SCSS code, in the scss/includes/_page-header.scss file, to
style the preceding HTML code:
body {
    header:first-of-type {
    @include make-container();
    @include make-container-max-widths();
    background-color: $primary-color-dark;
    color: $light-color;
    > div {
      @include make-row();
      > div {
        @include make-col-ready();
         @include make-col(12);
         h1 {
           @extend .display-3;
         }
      }
    }
  }
}
The SCSS has a nesting of four levels deep. When you change the structure of your HTML
code, your CSS code may easily become broken. The preceding also makes your CSS code
less reusable.
You do not generate any CSS classes, which also means you cannot reuse them in your
HTML code.
The @extend .display-3; still generates a .display-3 selector in the compiled CSS code
which is unused forever. But on the other hand, you do not need the precompiled CSS
classes for the grid anymore, due to the usage of Bootstrap's Sass grid mixins. These grid
mixins: make-container(), make-container-max-widths(), make-row(), and make-
col-span(), do not enable you to use only semantic HTML. Bootstrap's CSS solution for
the grid requires containers and rows which do not fit pure semantic code. Even when you
switch to the optional flexbox mode, you still need these wrappers.
When you're using Bootstrap's Sass grid mixins, you can easily compile Bootstrap without
the predefined grid classes. Setting the $enable-grid-classes Sass variable to false,
compiles Bootstrap without these grid classes.
It's not easy to say that the first solution with CSS classes is better than the second more
semantic solution or vice versa. The solution to choose depends on your requirements and
personal favorites. The smallest code is not always the most reusable code and the cleanest
HTML is always the most maintainable code.

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 92 ]
Whatever solution you choose, try to be consistent and do not use different solutions for the
same project.
The page header is ready now and should look like that shown in the following screenshot:
Let's go and style the navbar in the following section.
Styling the navbar
Now it is time to style our navbar. We use the HTML code from the responsive navbar from
Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap. Copy the HTML code into the
html/includes/navbar.html file. The navbar HTML should be wrapped inside a
container with the bg-primary-color class as follows:
<div class="container bg-primary-color">
    <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-md-up pull-xs-right" type="button"
data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsiblecontent">
      ☰
    </button>
  <nav class="navbar navbar-dark navbar-full" role="navigation">
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-toggleable-sm collapse"
id="collapsiblecontent">
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link active" href="#">Home <span class="sr-
only">(current)</span></a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">About</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</div>
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 93 ]
As you can see in the preceding code, we'll have to create a new bg-primary-color class.
Edit the following SCSS code in the scss/include/_navbar.scss file:
 .bg-primary-color {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: $light-color;
}
The navbar should look like that shown in the following screenshot:
When inspecting the results in a browser window smaller than 768 pixels wide, the navbar
should collapse and look like that shown in the following screenshot:
The responsive navbar requires the JavaScript Collapse plugin. In the next step, we'll
justify the navbar links. In the scss/include/_navbar.scss file, you can edit the
following SCSS code to justify the links:
.navbar {
  @include nav-justified;
}
The nav-justified mixin is not part of Bootstrap. You can find this mixin in the
includes/mixins/_nav-justified.scss file. You can also find the latest version of this
mixin at the following URL:
https://github.com/bassjobsen/214792f5543b6b551befaea81178acf7/. More
information can be found at h t t p : / / b a s s j o b s e n . w e b l o g s . f m / b o o t s t r a p - 4 s - r e s p o n s i v e
- n a v b a r s /. The mixin is imported via the includes/_mixins.scss partial. Later on, we'll
import other mixins in the same way.
The nav-justified mixins sets the break point at 768 pixels by default. The preceding
code shows that reusing mixins written by others is a piece of cake.

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 94 ]
Since the links are justified now, you can set the active and hover colors for the nav links
in the scss/include/_navbar.scss file as follows:
.navbar {
  .nav-link {
    &.active,
    &:hover {
      background-color: $accent-color;
    }
  }
}
Inspect the results in your browser. You'll find that your page should look like the
following screenshot:
When you resize your browser window so that the viewport is smaller than 768 pixels,
you'll see that some small tweaks are required.
First the initial nav link overlaps the hamburger button. Clicking the hamburger button
should make the collapsed menu visible, but you cannot click it due to the overlapping. You
can solve this by moving the HTML code of the button to the page header. The HTML code
in your html/includes/page-header-html file should look like the following:
  <header class="container bg-primary-color-dark">
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12 bg-primary-color-dark">
         <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-md-up pull-xs-right"
type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsiblecontent">
           ☰
         </button>
         <h1 class="display-3">Your blog</h1>
      </div>
  </div>
</header>
And finally, add the following SCSS code into the file to set the color of the button to white:
.navbar-toggler {
  color: $light-color;
}
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 95 ]
The nav links, apart from the first one, have a margin-left property set, as can been seen
in the following screenshot:
This left margin is useful on large screens, but on smaller screens we want to remove it. You
can use Bootstrap's media query ranges, as already described in Chapter 1, Getting Started
with Bootstrap, to remove this margin. Edit the following SCSS code in the
scss/includes/_navbar.scss file to remove the margins:
.navbar {
  @include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {
    .nav-item + .nav-item {
      margin-left: 0;
    }
  }
}
After these final tweaks, it is time to resize your browser window again. Make your
viewport wider than 768 pixels. The navbar will become horizontal now.
First add the following SCSS code to accomplish that the links fill the full height of the
navbar:
.navbar {
  padding-top: 0;
  padding-bottom: 0;
}
Now we'll add a CSS triangle under the active navbar link. Bootstrap does not provide a 
mixin for CSS triangles, but these Sass mixins can be found on the Web. In this example,
we'll use the triangle helper mixin from h t t p s : / / c s s - t r i c k s . c o m / s n i p p e t s / s a s s / c s s - t r
i a n g l e - m i x i n /. The triangle helper mixin requires the opposite-direction() mixin by
Hugo Giraudel. You'll find both mixins in the scss/includes/mixins/_triangle.scss
file.

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 96 ]
Again we shall reuse some useful mixins already written and tested by others. Adding the
triangle to the active navbar link is now as simple as editing the following SCSS code into
the file:
  .nav-link {
    position: relative;
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      &.active {
        &::before {
          @include triangle(bottom,$accent-color);
          position: absolute;
          margin-left: -1em;
          left: 50%;
          top: 100%;
        }
      }
    }
  }
Notice that you also have to set position: relative for the nav-link class. Since we only
want to have triangles on the large viewport, the code has been wrapped inside the
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) {} mixin call.
At the end, your navbar should look like that shown in the following screenshot:
Your navbar already will look pretty good now, but as a bonus you're going to add your
photo in the middle of it.
First add the required HTML code to the html/includes/navbar.html template:
      ...
     <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <img class="your-photo img-circle" src="{{root}}images/you.png"
alt="Your photo" height="140" width="140">
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 97 ]
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
      </li>
     ...
Save your photo in the assets/images directory of your project to ensure it is copied to
the temporary _site directory every time you rebuild your project.
The only thing left to do now is coding the SCSS code for the photo. We'll set the display
property to none by default to ensure that the photo is not visible in the small viewports
and use Bootstrap's media query ranges again to show it on larger viewports:
.navbar {
  .your-photo {
    display: none;
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      display: block;
      position: absolute;
      top: -100%;
    }
  }
}
Bootstrap's img-circle class ensures that your photo is displayed as a circle. Also the
navbar is ready now and will look like that shown in the following screenshot:
In the next section, you will style the main part of your blog page, including the side bar.
A navbar without Bootstrap's predefined CSS classes
Due to Bootstrap's predefined CSS classes, you can easily add a navbar to your project.
Your HTML markup is the same for each project and you only have to add the CSS classes
to your HTML to style it.
Of course, you can also remove the CSS classes and use only Sass to style your navbar.

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 98 ]
Instead of the navbar, navbar-dark classes you can also use the following SCSS code:
nav[role="navigation"] {
  @extend .navbar;
  @extend .navbar-dark;
  @include nav-justified;
  padding-top: 0;
  padding-bottom: 0;
}
Your photo does not require the your-photo and img-circle classes. You can also extend
the img-circle class as follows:
nav[role="navigation"] {
 li > img {
    display: none;
    @extend .img-circle;
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      display: block;
      position: absolute;
      top: -100%;
     z-index: 1;
    }
 }
}
Notice that in the SCSS code, the img-cicle class is extended outside the
media query range. Sass does not allow you to extend an outer selector
from within @media. The z-index is set to ensure that the photo is not
overlapped by other content.
In the SCSS, each nav-item selector can be replaced with a nav[role="navigation"] >
ul > li selector and each nav-link selector with a nav[role="navigation"] > ul >
li selector, and so on. Notice that you also have to replace the nav-item and nav-link
selectors in the justify-nav mixin.
The main part of your blog page
On small viewports, the sidebar is under the main content. On large viewports the side bar
floats on the right side of the main content.
On large viewports the main content gets ¾ of the available space, the rest ¼ part is left for
the side bar. We can accomplish this by using the col-md-9 and col-md-3 classes in our
HTML.

The layout columns are set in the default layout template in the
html/layouts/default.html file:
    <div class="main-content container">
        <div class="row">
          <main class="col-md-9" role="content">
            {{> body}}
          </main>
          <aside class="col-md-3">
            {{> sidebar}}
          </aside>
        </div>
    </div>
Again the col-md-* classes are not required. You can accomplish the same by editing the
following SCSS code in the scss/includes/_blog.scss file:
    main[role="content"] {
      @include make-col();
      @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
        @include make-col-span(9);
      }
      + aside {
        @include make-col();
        @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
          @include make-col-span(3);
        }
      }
    }
Or even remove the container and row classes too, as follows:
.main-content {
  @include make-container();
  @include make-container-max-widths();
  > div {
    @include make-row();
    main[role="content"] {
      @include make-col();
      @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
        @include make-col-span(9);
      }
      + aside {
        @include make-col();
        @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
          @include make-col-span(3);
        }
      }

    }
  }
}
You can disable the predefined grid classes with the $enable-grid-classes variable
when using Sass mixins for the grid. Skipping the predefined grid classes and using mixins
instead will make the compiled CSS code smaller. Smaller CSS code will load faster.
Bootstrap's source code also contains a special Sass partial called
bootstrap-grid.scss. You can compile the bootstrap-grid.scss
file instead of the bootstrap.scss file to get the CSS code for the grid
only.
The preceding code enables you to use only Bootstrap's grid for your project without the
overhead of the other components. The grid requires the box-sizing: border-box
setting which is not included in the SCSS code of the bootstrap-grid.scss file.
Styling the blog posts
Your page can contain a list of blog posts, each post starting with a relevant photo. In the
example we'll show only one blog post. The blog post may look like that shown in the
following screenshot:
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 101 ]
The HTML code for each blog post, saved in the html/pages/index.html file, will look
like the following:
            <article>
                <img src="{{root}}images/blog1.png" class="img-fluid">
                <div class="blog-post">
                <header><h1>Blog post 1</h1><time>16:00:00
01/01/2018</time></header>
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing
elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa. Cum sociis natoque
penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Donec
quam felis, ultricies nec, pellentesque eu, pretium quis, sem. Nulla
consequat massa quis enim. Donec pede justo, fringilla vel, aliquet nec,
vulputate eget, arcu. In enim justo, rhoncus ut, imperdiet a, venenatis
vitae, justo. Nullam dictum felis eu pede mollis pretium.</p>
                <p><a href="">Read more ...</a>
                <footer></footer>
                </div>
            </article>
The images have the img-fluid class to make them responsive. Now the blog post will
look like that shown in the following screenshot:

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 102 ]
Edit the SCSS code in the scss/includes/_blog.scss partial. First give the heading tags
the desired color:
 .main-content {
  h1,
  h2,
  h3 {
    color: $primary-color;
  }
}
Alternatively, for the preceding code, we can also set $headings-color: $primary-
color; in the scss/includes/_variables.sccs file. When setting the $heading-color
variable, you'll have to explicitly add the color for the <h1> element in the page header, in
the scss/includes/_page-header.scss file as follows:
.bg-primary-color-dark {
  background-color: $primary-color-dark;
  color: $light-color;
  h1 {
    color: $page-header-heading-color;
  }
}
To use the preceding SCSS, you'll also have to set $page-header-heading-color:
$light-color !default; in the scss/includes/_variables.sccs file.
Then for the finishing touch give each article a padding-top:
main {
    article {
      padding-top: $spacer-y;
    }
}
You can also add the p-t-1 class to your HTML code. The p-t-1 class is one of the new
spacing classes from Bootstrap 4. These utility classes enable you to set the spacing
(padding and margin) of an element. You can read more about them in the Styling of the
navbar and hero unit section of Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp.
And finally, we have to style the blog post itself. For that, first set the background color and
the border of the blog post by editing the following SCSS code into the
scss/includes/_blog.scss file:
.blog-post {
    padding: $spacer-y $spacer-x;
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 103 ]
    margin-top: $spacer-y;
    background-color: $light-color;
    border: 1px solid $gray;
}
Again the padding and margin can also be set by adding the m-t-1 and p-a-1 CSS classes
to your HTML code.
When inspecting the result in your browser, it should look like that shown in the following
screenshot:
In the end, we add a CSS triangle pointing to the photo to the top of our blog post for
aesthetic reasons.
Since we'll need a triangle having a border, we add two triangles. The second triangle,
which is a little smaller, overlays the first one. The dark background color of the first
triangle looks like a border. The SCSS code for the triangles can be edited in the file, and
should look like this:
  .blog-post {
    position: relative;
    &::before {

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 104 ]
      @include triangle(top,$gray,1.1em);
      position: absolute;
      left: 29px;
      bottom: 100%;
    }
    &::after {
      @include triangle(top,$light-color);
      position: absolute;
      left: 30px;
      bottom: 100%;
    }
  }
The triangles look like those shown in the following screenshot:
The blog posts are ready now. Let's go on and style the side bar of our page.
Styling the side bar
The side bar of the blog page is built with a Bootstrap list group and will look like that
shown in the following screenshot:
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 105 ]
You can simply turn a <ul> list into a list group with Bootstrap and the predefined list-
group and list-group-item CSS classes. Now you can see the flexibility and re-usability
of Bootstrap's CSS classes in practice. With ease we can replace the <ul> element with a
<div> element and a list of <a> tags. The HTML code for the side menu in the
html/includes/sidebar.html file may look like the following:
<aside>
  <h2>Archive</h2>
  <!-- list -->
  <div class="list-group">
    <a href="#" class="list-group-item">Cras justo odio</a>
    <a href="#" class="list-group-item">Dapibus ac facilisis in</a>
    <a href="#" class="list-group-item">Morbi leo risus</a>
    <a href="#" class="list-group-item">Porta ac consectetur ac</a>
    <a href="#" class="list-group-item">Vestibulum at eros</a>
  </div>
</aside>
The SCSS code to set the basic styles of the side bar can be edited in the
scss/includes/_sidebar.scss file as follows:
aside {
  margin-top: $spacer-y;
  padding: $spacer-y $spacer-x ($spacer-y / 3) $spacer-x;
  background-color: $light-color;
  border: 1px solid $gray-dark;
}
And finally, set the color accents of the mouse hovers of the list by overwriting Bootstrap's
variables in the local sccs/includes/_variables.scss file as shown in the following
SCSS code:
$list-group-hover-bg: $accent-color;
$list-group-link-hover-color: $light-color;
Your blog page is nearly ready to start blogging. The only thing left to do now is building
the footer for the page.
The page footer
The page footer should look like that shown in the following screenshot:
The page footer has two equal sized columns on the larger viewport. These columns stack
when the viewport become narrower than 768 pixels.

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 106 ]
The main HTML in the html/includes/footer.html HTML template may look like the
following:
      <footer class="container page-footer bg-dark">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <!-- left -->
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <!-- right -->
                </div>
            </div>
      </footer>
The footer is split into two equal sized columns by using the col-md-6 classes. These
columns get 50% (6 of 12 columns) of the space on the medium (md) and larger grids. As
already mentioned, you can also choose to use Bootstrap's Sass mixins to build your grid.
The background and font colors are set with the bg-dark class. The following SCSS code in
the scss/includes/_footer.scss compiles into the bg-dark class:
.bg-dark {
  color: $light-color;
  background-color: $dark-color;
}
The bg-dark class can also be generated with the following mixin call:
@include bg-variant('.bg-dark', $dark-color);
To create the social media button later on we'll also need a bg-accent-color class. To
make the bg-* classes more easy to reuse, you may remove them to a new Sass partial. The
scss/includes/_backgrounds.scss may contain the following SCSS code:
@include bg-variant('.bg-primary-color-dark', $primary-color-dark);
@include bg-variant('.bg-primary-color', $primary-color);
@include bg-variant('.bg-accent-color', $accent-color);
@include bg-variant('.bg-dark', $dark-color);
Now that the background and font colors are set, we'll create some style for the footer itself.
Also the footer gets a CSS triangle pointing upward. You can edit the following SCSS code
into the scss/includes_footer.scss file to set the main styles for the footer:
.page-footer {
  position: relative;
  padding: $spacer;
  margin-top: $spacer-y;
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 107 ]
  &::after {
    @include triangle(top,$dark-color);
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 100%;
    left: 10%;
  }
}
Of course, you can also set the paddings and margin with Bootstrap's m-t-1 and p-x-1
classes.
The left footer column
The left column of the footer contains a small footer text and a row of social media buttons:
                    <p class="page-foooter-text">Lorem ipsum dolor sit
amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor.
Aenean massa. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes,
nascetur ridiculus mus.</p>
                    <div class="social-buttons">
                        <ul>
                            <li>FB</li>
                            <li>TW</li>
                            <li>G+</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
The footer text does not require any additional styles. Use the following SCSS code in the
scss/includes/_footer.scss file to style the social media buttons:
.social-buttons {
  ul {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    list-style: none;
    li {
      padding: 10px;
      border: 1px solid $accent-color-light;
    }
  }
  .page-footer & {
    li {
      float: left;
      @extend .bg-accent-color;
    }
  }

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 108 ]
  @include clearfix();
}
Notice the usage of the & parent reference in the preceding code:
  .page-footer & {
    li {
      @extend .bg-accent-color;
      float: left;
    }
  }
The & parent reference is used to reverse the selector order. The preceding SCSS code will
compile into CSS code as follows:
.page-footer .social-buttons li {
  float: left;
}
This means that the float: left is only set for the .social-buttons li selector when it is a
child of the .page-footer selector. So in our project, the social media buttons will only
have a float: left when they are inside the .page-footer selector. We use this method
to reuse our social media button SCSS code later on to build a fixed list of social media
buttons on the side of our page.
Because of the floating of the list elements in the preceding code, you cannot set the
background color on the <ul> tag. You can solve this with the @extend .bg-accent-
color; declaration.
The right footer column
The right column contains a form to subscribe to your newsletter. The form is built with
Bootstrap's input group component. The HTML code of the form should look like the
following:
                    <h3>Join our Newsletter</h3>
                    <div class="input-group">
                      <input type="text" class="form-control"
placeholder="Your e-mail">
                      <span class="input-group-btn">
                        <button class="btn btn-accent-color"
type="button">Subscribe</button>
                      </span>
                    </div>
www.ebook3000.com

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 109 ]
You can use the following SCSS code to compile the btn-accent-color class:
.btn-accent-color {
  @include button-variant(#fff, $accent-color, #fff);
}
The preceding code for the btn-accent-color class is saved in the
scss/includes/_footer.scss file now. Saving buttons in a separated partial called
_buttons.scss will make your code easier to reuse.
Of course you do not have to create the btn-accent-color class at all. The following SCSS
code will style your button exactly the same:
 .page-footer {
  button {
    @extend .btn;
    @include button-variant(#fff, $accent-color, #fff);
  }
}
And finally, we should give the <h3> element the right color with the following SCSS code:
.page-foter {
  h3 {
    color: $accent-color;
  }
}
Reusing the SCSS code of the social buttons
As a bonus, we'll add a fixed list of social media buttons at the left side of our page, which
will look like that shown in the following screenshot:

Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
[ 110 ]
First add the following HTML snippets at the end of the html/includes/footer.html
file:
     <div class="social-buttons fixed-media bg-accent-color">
    <ul>
        <li>FB</li>
        <li>TW</li>
        <li>G+</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
Notice that the bg-accent-color is added to the wrapping <div> element.
The only SCSS code we have to edit to the scss/includes/_footer.scss is as follows:
.social-buttons {
  &.fixed-media {
    display: none;
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      position: fixed;
      top: 150px;
      display: block;
    }
  }
}
As you can see, Sass enables you to reuse most of the SCSS code you have coded before to
style the social media buttons in the page footer. You can consider saving the social media
buttons code in a separate HTML template and Sass partial for easier reuse.
At the time of writing this book, all modern browsers except Opera Mini support the
position: fixed; declaration from keeping an element in a fixed location regardless of
the scroll position.

Summary
In this chapter, you have got a grip on Sass. You now know how to use Sass to customize
Bootstrap's components. You built a web page for your web log and applied different
strategies to style it with Sass. In further chapters, you can apply your new Sass knowledge
to build amazing web designs with Bootstrap and Sass.
In the next chapter, we'll create a WordPress theme with Bootstrap 4.

Bootstrappin' a WordPress
Theme
WordPress is a very popular Content Management System (CMS) system. It now powers
25 percent of all sites across the web. WordPress is free, open-source, and based on PHP. To
learn more about WordPress, you can also visit Packt's WordPress Tech page at  h t t p s : / / w w
w . p a c k t p u b . c o m / t e c h / w o r d p r e s s.
Now, let's turn our design from the Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and
Sass, into a WordPress theme. There are many Bootstrap-based themes that we could
choose. We've taken care to integrate Bootstrap's powerful Sass styles and JavaScript
plugins with the best practices found for HTML5. It will be to our advantage to use a theme
that does the same. We'll use the JBST4 theme for this exercise. JBST4 is a blank WordPress
theme built with Bootstrap 4.
The JBST 4 theme has established itself as a starter theme that leverages the power of
Bootstrap while hewing to the implementation of best practices at every turn.
In this chapter, we will perform the following:
Install WordPress and the JBST 4 theme
Integrate our customized Sass and JavaScript files with the JBST 4 theme
Customize the theme template files to deliver the markup we need for our design
Configure the Grid and navbar
Build the page header and footer
Customize the side-bar and use the off-canvas menu template

Installing WordPress and other requirements
You will need a (local) web server with PHP and MySQL to run WordPress.
AMPPS is an easy to install software stack of , MySQL, PHP, Perl, Python, and Softaculous
Apache, Mysql, PHP, Perl, Python, and Softaculous auto-installer that can be used on
desktops and office servers. AMPPS is available for free, and you can run it on Linux, Mac
OS X, and Windows. You can download AMPPS at h t t p : / / a m p p s . c o m / d o w n l o a d s.
An app for WordPress is available at h t t p : / / a m p p s . c o m / a p p s / b l o g s / W o r d P r e s s.
Windows users can also use WampServer. WampServer is a Windows web development
environment. It allows you to create web applications with Apache2, PHP, and a MySQL
database. Alongside PhpMyAdmin, WampServer allows you to manage easily your
databases. More information about WampServer can be found at h t t p : / / w w w . w a m p s e r v e r .
c o m / e n /.
Installing WordPress
After installing your web server you can install WordPress. Installation of WordPress is
very easy and takes on average about 5 minutes to complete. If we are already comfortable
with performing such installations, you should try their famous 5-minute install. Detailed
instructions are available too at h t t p s : / / c o d e x . w o r d p r e s s . o r g / I n s t a l l i n g _ W o r d P r e s s.
Node.js, Gulp, and Bower
The JBST 4 WordPress theme is built with Gulp and it's frontend libraries and their
dependencies are managed with Bower. You should install Node.js on your system to run
Gulp. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. More
information about how to install Node.js can be found at h t t p s : / / n o d e j s . o r g / e n /.

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 114 ]
Node.js comes with npm installed. npm is a Node.js package manager. After installing
Node.js, you can simply install both Gulp and Bower by running the following commands
in your console:
npm install --global gulp-cli
npm install --global bower
Read more about Bower at h t t p : / / b o w e r . i o /. In Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build
Process with Gulp, you can read more about Gulp and learn how to set up your own build
process.
Installing the JBST 4 theme
Let's get started by downloading the JBST theme. Navigate to your wordpress/wp-
content/themes/ directory and run the following command in your console:
git clone https://github.com/bassjobsen/jbst-4-sass.git jbst-weblog-theme
Then navigate to the new jbst-weblog-theme directory and run the following command
to confirm everything is working:
npm install
gulp
When all works as expected you can perform the following steps to create a custom theme:
Navigate inside the jbst-weblog-theme directory to the style.css file and
1.
open it in your favorite text editor. Once you've opened the file, you'll notice that
it only contains some basic styles required for WordPress styles. Site styles are
provided by a styles.css style sheet file located inside the assets/css
directory, which is compiled by Bootstrap. We'll follow this approach as well. The
style.css file then serves primarily to name our theme, give appropriate
credits, declare the license, and so on. So, let's do that.
Change the comments to reflect your new theme information. Here's what I've

Save the file.
3.
Now let's add a custom screenshot so that we can recognize the theme in the
4.
WordPress Dashboard. You should replace the screenshot.png file.
Grab a screenshot from our results in Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with
5.
Bootstrap and Sass. The screenshot should accurately show the theme design and
be saved in PNG format. The recommended image size is 1200 x 900 pixels.
Replace the default JBST screenshot with our new custom screenshot.
6.
We now have our own copy of the JBST theme setup.
Let's install it!
Installing the theme
Be prepared. The changes that we made earlier have temporarily severed connections to
Bootstrap styles, JavaScript, and so on. We're going to update these connections in the
following steps. We're simply going to make the process more enjoyable by having the
theme installed and running so that we can test our progress along the way!
From your WordPress Dashboard, navigate to Appearance | Themes and activate the
theme. If you've renamed it and provided the new screenshot (or used the provided theme-
starter files), you'll see something like the following screenshot:

Then click on the Customize button.

In the right-hand side pane, you should see the default Bootstrap navbar, a side

bar, and the first Hello World post installed by default:
Congratulations! You've got the JBST theme installed.
If you do not see the default Bootstrap styles applied to the navbar or text,
you probably have forgotten to run the gulp command first. And you
have to run the bower install npm install commands before you can run the
gulp command.
Let's set up our page components.
Reusing the Sass code
You've already coded the Sass code for our theme in Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with
Bootstrap and Sass. To reuse this code you can copy the Sass files and directory from the
scss/includes directory of Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass into
the folder assets/scss/includes directory of your jbst-weblog-theme theme
directory. You may overwrite the _navbar.scss Sass partial that already exists and
remove the _bootstrap.scss Sass partial. You should end up with a file and directory
structure like that shown in the following image:

Now edit the assets/scss/styles.scss file. First import the
includes/variables.scss file just before the import of the custom variables and import
the other partials at the end of the assets/scss/styles.scss file after the // Import
Customizations comment. After your changes, the SCSS code in the
assets/scss/styles.scss file should look like the following:
/******************************************************************

Here's where the magic happens. Here is where you import
all of your Sass files so they can compile into one

Conflicts between WordPress and Bootstrap
– predefined classes
The HTML pages of WordPress contain a lot of CSS classes to style them by default. Themes
such as JBST 4 can overwrite WordPres's default HTML code and enable you to change the
HTML structure of elements of your WordPress website.
You can read more about the WordPress template hierarchy at h t t p s : / / d e v e l o p e r . w o r d p r
e s s . o r g / t h e m e s / b a s i c s / t e m p l a t e - h i e r a r c h y /. Let's take the search form as an example.
To display a site search form on your website you can call the WordPress
get_search_form() PHP function. This function returns a search form built with the
HTML code as shown in the following:
 <form role="search" method="get" id="searchform"
    class="searchform" action="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/' ) ); ?>">
    <div>
        <label class="screen-reader-text" for="s"><?php _x( 'Search for:',
'label' ); ?></label>
        <input type="text" value="<?php echo get_search_query(); ?>"
name="s" id="s" />
        <input type="submit" id="searchsubmit"
            value="<?php echo esc_attr_x( 'Search', 'submit button' ); ?>"
/>
    </div>
</form>
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 121 ]
Of course, you can write some SCSS code to compile the CSS code to style the preceding
form. Bootstrap's CSS code for the input-group requires a different HTML structure. Instead
of writing SCSS code, you can also create a searchform.php file in your theme directory.
The searchform.php file contains the HTML code for the search form and overwrites
WordPres's default search form. The HTML code in the searchform.php file of the JBST
theme looks as follows:
<form role="search" method="get" class="search-form" action="<?php echo
home_url( '/' ); ?>">
   <div class="input-group">
      <input type="search" class="form-control" placeholder="<?php echo
esc_attr_x( 'Search...', 'search', 'jbst-4' ) ?>" value="<?php echo
get_search_query() ?>" name="s"  />
      <span class="input-group-btn">
        <button class="btn btn-secondary" type="button"><?php echo
esc_attr_x( 'Search', 'search', 'jbst-4' ) ?></button>
      </span>
    </div>
</form>
As you can see, the HTML for the preceding search form already contains the HTML
structure and the required CSS classes for Bootstrap.
You will also have to edit the following SCSS code into the scss/includes_navbar.scss
file:
.navbar {
  .search-form {
    @extend .pull-md-right;
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      .input-group {
        max-width: 300px;
      }
    }
  }
}
Later on, you'll create a WordPress menu for your main navigation and turn it into a
Bootstrap navbar.

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 122 ]
Turn the navigation into a Bootstrap navbar
Item and links in Bootstrap's navbar requires special CSS classes. Because menus are
dynamically created by calling the wp_nav_menu() custom PHP function, adding the right
CSS classes for each menu item is not that simple. The wp_nav_menu() function can be
called with an array of arguments. The walker parameter enables you to assign an instance
of a custom walker class. The walker class provides developers with a means to traverse
tree-like data structures for the purpose of rendering HTML. The menu walker class
enables you to generate a custom menu in combination with the wp_nav_menu() call.
The JBST theme also uses a custom walker PHP class and the HTML code of the menu in
the parts/nav-topbar.php file may look like the following code:
<nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-faded navbar-full" role="navigation">
  <div class="navbar-toggleable-sm collapse"
    id="CollapsingNavbar">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="http://wordpress">
    WordPress Weblog Theme</a>
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a href="http://wordpress" class="nav-link active">Home  <span
class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a href="http://wordpress/?page_id=2" class="nav-link">Sample
Page</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link"><img class="your-photo img-
circle" src="/wp-content/themes/jbst-weblog-theme/assets/images/you.png"
alt="Your photo" height="140" width="140"></a></li>
      <li class="nav-item"><a href="http://wordpress/?page_id=6"
class="nav-link">Page 3</a></li>
      <li class="nav-item"><a href="http://wordpress/?page_id=9"
class="nav-link">Page 4</a></li>
    </ul>
    <form class="form-inline pull-md-right search-form" ac-
tion="http://wordpress/">
      <input class="form-control" type="text" placeholder="Search">
      <button class="btn btn-primary-outline" type="button">Search</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</nav>
www.ebook3000.com

[ 123 ]
So the JBST theme turns WordPress HTML code into standard Bootstrap HTML code
including the required CSS classes. The preceding HTML structure for the navigation
enables us to reuse the SCSS code we created in Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with
Bootstrap and Sass already.
On the other hand, without the PHP walker class, the HTML code of the main navigation
may look like the following:
<div class="menu-main-navigation-container">
<ul id="menu-main-navigation" class="menu">
  <li id="menu-item-4" class="menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-
object-custom menu-item-home menu-item-4">
<a href="http://wordpress">Home</a></li>
  <li id="menu-item-5" class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-
object-page menu-item-5">
<a href="http://wordpress/?page_id=2">Sample Page</a></li>
  <li id="menu-item-12" class="menu-item menu-item-type-custom menu-item-
object-custom menu-item-12">
<a><img class="your-photo img-circle" src="/wp-content/themes/jbst-weblog-
theme/assets/images/you.png" alt="Your photo" height="140"
width="140"></a></li>
  <li id="menu-item-7" class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-
object-page menu-item-7">
<a href="http://wordpress/?page_id=6">Page 3</a></li>
  <li id="menu-item-10" class="menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-
item-object-page menu-item-10">
<a href="http://wordpress/?page_id=9">Page 4</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
You can style the preceding HTML code by adding the following SCSS code at the end of
the scss/includes/_navbar.scss Sass partial:
.menu-main-navigation-container {
  @extend .navbar-toggleable-sm;
  @extend .collapse;
  ul {
    @extend .nav;
    @extend .navbar-nav;
    li {
      @extend .nav-item;
      a {
        @extend .nav-link;
      }
    }
  }
}

With the search form and navbar examples, you've seen that you can apply different
strategies to use WordPress with Bootstrap: You can change the HTML output of
WordPress to fit Bootstrap's coding standards or write SCSS code which extends Bootstrap's
CSS classes with WordPress CSS classes. Both strategies can be useful, but in the case where
you cannot simply extend Bootstrap's CSS classes and have to write new complex SCSS
code to fit WordPress' HTML code you, should probably prefer to change the HTML
output.
About the grid
The default page has a main content area and a side bar. In our original design from
Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass, the side bar has a width of 25%
(col-md-3). The JBST 4 theme has a side bar of 33.3% (col-md-4). And so the design requires
a width of 75% (col-md-9) whilst the theme sets 66.6% (col-md-8) for the main content area.
You can change the CSS grid classes in the index.php, page.php, and sidebar.php pages
in the theme directory to fix this issue.
As already described in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap, you can also accomplish
the same by using Bootstrap's Sass mixins and variables for the grid. For instance, create a
new Sass partial (_grid.scss) and edit the following SCSS code into it:
    main[role="main"] {
      @include make-col();
      @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
        @include make-col-span(9);
      }
      + .sidebar {
        @include make-col();
        @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
          @include make-col-span(3);
        }
      }
    }
The preceding SCSS code will break the full page width layout in the template-full-
width.php file because the main[role="main"] selector is not unique and is used for
different layouts of the JBST 4 theme.

Notice that you also will have to set the $enable-grid-classes Sass
variable to false in the assets/scss/_variables.scss file to compile
Bootstrap without grid classes.
Configuring the navbar
In this section, we'll set up the navbar items for our site pages, and we'll also go ahead and
add the markup for the navbar.
Click on the Customize button on the theme page again. Under Menus create a new menu
called Main navigation, Check both The main menu as location and Automatically add
new top-level pages to this menu under menu options:

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 126 ]
Then add some items under the menu. Select both the Home and Sample Page under the
Pages option:
Now press the Save & Publish button and close the customizer after that.
The main navigation of our example template has four menu links and a photo in the
middle, so we'll have to add two more pages. We'll add the photo later on.
In your WordPress Dashboard, navigate to Pages | Add new and add two new pages.
Finally, the Navigation bar should look like that shown in the following screenshot:
In the next section, you will reuse the HTML and Sass code from Chapter 3, Customizing
Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass.

Updating the HTML code
Now edit the nav-topbar.php file in the parts directory of the theme directory. You can take
the html/includes/navbar.html file from Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with
Bootstrap and Sass, as an example. You should remove both the navbar-brand and the search
form. At the end, the HTML and PHP code should look like this:
<div class="container bg-primary-color">
  <nav class="navbar navbar-dark" role="navigation">
  <div class="nav navbar-nav navbar-toggleable-sm collapse"
id="CollapsingNavbar">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="<?php echo home_url(); ?>"><?php
bloginfo('name'); ?></a>
    <?php jbst4_top_nav(); ?>
  </div>
  </nav>
</div>
In the preceding code, notice that we have wrapped the navbar code inside a <div
class="container bg-primary-color"></div> container. The <nav> tag has got a
navbar and navbar-dark class.
Adding your photo to the middle of the navbar
First copy your photo to the assets/images directory in your theme directory. Then open
the customizer or navigate to Appearance | Menus in your WordPress Dashboard, and add
a new item to the menu:

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 128 ]
Enter the following HTML code in the Navigation label field:
<img class="your-photo img-circle" src="/wp-content/themes/jbst-weblog-
theme/assets/images/you.png" alt="Your photo" height="140" width="140">
field should contain the # sign, you will remove it in the next step to
ensure <a> tag around the image does not have a href attribute.
As you can see, the photo is still wrapped in an <a> tag. The <a> tag does not have a href
attribute, but it still has a mouse hover and changes the position of the image. You can solve
these issues by replacing the styles for your-photo selector in the
assets/styles/scss/includes/_navbar.scss file with the following SCSS code:
The URL field should contain the # sign. You will remove it in the next step to ensure the
<a> tag around the image does not have a href  attribute.
If you have installed WordPress in a sub-directory such as /wordpress/,
you have to change the link to the image. Also, the jbst-weblog-theme
should correspondence with the name of your theme directory.
Save the new menu item by pressing the Add to menu button. Drag the new menu item to
the third and most central position in the menu structure and click the arrow on the right of
the item to configure it. Remove the # sign in the URL field.

Press the Save menu button when you are finished. Navigate to your website and inspect
the results of your efforts.
As you can see, the photo is still wrapped in an <a> tag. The <a> tag does not have a href
attribute, but it still has a mouse hover and changes the position of the image. You can solve
these issues by replacing the styles for your-photo selector in the
assets/styles/scss/includes/_navbar.scss file with the following SCSS code:
  .nav-item:nth-child(3) .nav-link {
    display: none;
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      position: absolute;
      top: -100%;
      z-index: 1;
      display: block;
      &.active,
      &:hover {
        background-color: transparent;
      }
    }
  }
Run the gulp command after you are done with the changes. You will find that your
navbar now looks like that shown in the following screenshot:
Giving your blog a page header
Open and edit the header.php file in the theme directory. Add the following line of PHP
just before the topbar template part including:
<?php get_template_part( 'parts/page', 'header' ); ?>

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 130 ]
In the create a new template part in the parts directory called page-header.php, edit the
following HTML and PHP code into it:
 <header class="container bg-primary-color-dark">
  <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xs-12 bg-primary-color-dark">
         <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-md-up pull-xs-right"
type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#CollapsingNavbar">
           ☰
         </button>
         <h1 class="display-3"><?php bloginfo('name'); ?></h1>
      </div>
  </div>
</header>
The <?php bloginfo('name'); ?> PHP code automatically shows the name of your
blog in the page header. Notice that the hamburger menu to toggle the visibility of the
menu on smaller viewports is also part of the page header.
Don't forget the page footer
Adding the page footer is as simple as adding the page header. Edit the footer.php file in
your theme directory. Again you can take the html/includes/page-footer.html HTML
partial from Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass, as an example.
At the end, the HTML and PHP code in the footer.php file should look as follows:
        <footer class="container page-footer bg-dark">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
              <p class="page-foooter-text">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,

                <nav role="navigation">
                  <?php jbst4_footer_links(); ?>
                </nav>
                <div class="social-buttons">
                  <ul>
                    <li>FB</li>
                    <li>TW</li>
                    <li>G+</li>
                  </ul>

          </div>
        </footer>
        <?php wp_footer(); ?>
    </body>
</html> <!-- end page -->
The additional <nav> element with the <?php jbst4_footer_links(); ?> PHP code
can be used to display a link menu in the footer. Choose the Footer Links menu location
when configuring the menu.
You have to add the SCSS code to style the Footer Links menu to the
assets/scss/includes/_footer.scss file yourself. This SCSS code may look like the
following:
 page-footer {
    nav[role="navigation"] {
      ul {
        list-style: none;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        li {
          float: left;
          padding: 10px;
        }
      }
      @include clearfix;
    }
}

Also notice that we've added an extra grid row to the footer which holds the copyrights
notes:
             <div class="col-xs-12 text-xs-center">
               &copy; <?php echo date('Y'); ?> <?php bloginfo('name'); ?>.
             </div>
The code for the social media link block on the left side of our page is also added to the
footer.php file:
<div class="social-buttons fixed-media bg-accent-color">
  <ul>
    <li>FB</li>
    <li>TW</li>
    <li>G+</li>
  </ul>

Styling your blog posts
First add an image to the hello world blog post. Edit the blog post in the WordPress
Dashboard and add a Featured Image, as shown in the following screenshot:

In the preceding code, the the_post_thumbnail('full'); PHP function call is moved to
the top. This code displays the featured image. A <div class="blog-post"></div>
wrapper is added too. The wrapper adds the blog-post CSS class according the SCSS code
in the scss/includes/_blog.scss file.
The side bar of your blog
The HTML and PHP code for the side bar can be found in the sidebar.php file in your
theme directory. The side bar loads WordPress Widgets. You can manage your widgets in
the WordPress Dashboard. Navigate to Appearance | Widget and configure the widgets.
Each widget has a built-in HTML structure with CSS classes. You can change or modify the
HTML and CSS structure when you register your side bar. The JBST 4 theme's side bars are
registered in the assets/functions/sidebar.php file of the theme as follows:
    register_sidebar(array(
        'id' => 'sidebar1',
        'name' => __('Sidebar 1', 'jbst-4'),

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 134 ]
        'description' => __('The first (primary) sidebar.',
             'jbst-4'),
        'before_widget' => '<div id="%1$s" class="widget %2$s">',
        'after_widget' => '</div>',
        'before_title' => '<h4 class="widgettitle">',
        'after_title' => '</h4>',
    ));

e _ w i d g e t.
When writing the SCSS for the side bar and its widgets, you can choose whether to style the
side bar in one go or to create style rules for each widget.
To style the side bar all at once, you can edit the SCSS code in the
assets/scss/includes/_sidebar.scss as follows:
.sidebar {
  padding: $spacer-y $spacer-x ($spacer-y / 3);
  margin-top: $spacer-y;
  background-color: $light-color;
  border: 1px solid $gray-dark;
}
Notice that we've applied the style rules on the sidebar selector. The sidebar selector is not
unique and is probably also used for other side bases in the theme.
After running the gulp command, your side bar may look like that shown in the following
screenshot:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 135 ]
From here I'll show you how to style the side bar per widget. First change the SCSS code in
the assets/scss/includes/_sidebar.scss file as follows:
.sidebar {
  .widget {
    padding: $spacer-y $spacer-x ($spacer-y / 3);
    margin-top: $spacer-y;
    background-color: $light-color;
    border: 1px solid $gray-dark;
  }
}
After running the gulp command each widget will look like that shown in the following
screenshot:
Now we should turn the lists inside the widget into Bootstrap's list groups. You can do this
by extending Bootstrap's list-group CSS selectors in your SCSS code. Consider the following
SCSS code:
 sidebar {
   widget {
    ul {
      @extend .list-group;
      li {
        @extend .list-group-item;
      }
    }
  }
}

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 136 ]
Run the gulp command again unless you have run the gulp watch command already.
You'll find that the lists are styled like Bootstrap's list groups now. Bootstrap's list groups
do not change the background color on mouse hovers as required by our design. You can
extend the SCSS code to fix the preceding problem. At the end, the SCSS should look like
this:
 sidebar {
   widget {
    ul {
      @extend .list-group;
      li {
        @extend .list-group-item;
        padding: 0;
        a {
          display: block;
          padding: .75rem 1.25rem;
          text-decoration: none;
          @include hover-focus-active {
            color: $list-group-link-hover-color;
            background-color: $list-group-hover-bg;
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
The preceding SCSS code removes the padding from the li selectors and applies it on the a
selectors. The a selectors also got a display: block; declaration to ensure that the links fill the
available space just like other block level elements.
The widgets should look like that shown in the following screenshot:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 137 ]
Notice that the preceding breaks the mark up and styling of the recent comments due to
each list item containing two links (<a> tags). Be prepared to create special style rules for
only the ul.recentcomments selector to fix this issue.
As you have seen, the list group does not handle hovered links by default. The Bootstrap
Navs component does support hovered links. Especially, the Stacked pills variant of the
Navs component seems to fit our requirements. You can use the widget list into stacked
pills Navs components by replacing the SCSS code with the following SCSS code into the
assets/scss/includes/_sidebar.scss file:
.widget {
  padding: $spacer-y $spacer-x ($spacer-y / 3);
  margin-top: $spacer-y;
  background-color: $light-color;
  border: 1px solid $gray-dark;
  ul {
    @extend .nav;
    @extend .nav-pills;
    @extend .nav-stacked;
    li {
      @extend .nav-item;
      // Place the border on the list items and negative margin up for
better styling
      margin-bottom: -$list-group-border-width;
      background-color: $list-group-bg;
      border: $list-group-border-width solid $list-group-border-color;
      a {
        @extend .nav-link;
        border-radius: 0;
        @include hover-focus-active {
          color: $list-group-link-hover-color;
          background-color: $list-group-hover-bg;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Now your widget may look like that shown in the following screenshot:
The off-canvas side bar
On the official Bootstrap website at h t t p : / / v 4 - a l p h a . g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / e x a m p l e s /, you
can find an off-canvas example. The example will show you how to build a toggle able off-
canvas navigation menu for use with Bootstrap. You can use an off-canvas side bar in your
theme too. On the smaller viewports, a page with the off-canvas menu will look like that
shown in the following screenshot:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 139 ]
When you click the Toggle nav button in the preceding page, the page content slides to the
left and the side bar becomes visible.
The off-canvas menu use the template called template-offcanvas.php in the theme
directory/ It should contain the following HTML and PHP code:
<?php
/*
Template Name: Off-canvas Side bar
*/
?>
<?php get_header(); ?>
    <div class="container" id="content">
        <div id="inner-content" class="row row-offcanvas row-offcanvas-
right">
            <main id="main" class="col-xs-12 col-md-8"
                 role="main">
              <p class="pull-xs-right hidden-md-up">
                <button type="button" class=
                     "btn btn-primary btn-sm" data-toggle="offcanvas">
<?php _e('Toggle nav', 'jbst-4') ?>
</button>
              </p>
                <?php if (have_posts()) :
                      while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
                    <?php get_template_part
                         ( 'parts/loop', 'page' ); ?>
                <?php endwhile; endif;
            </main> <!-- end #main -->
            <?php get_sidebar('offcanvas'); ?>
            <div class="clearfix hidden-xs-up"></div>
        </div> <!-- end #inner-content -->
    </div> <!-- end #content -->
<?php get_footer(); ?>

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 140 ]
You should notice that the template-offcanvas.php file is very similar to the page.php
and index.php files. At the beginning of the file, you'll find the templates comments,
including the Template name. The <div id="inner-content"> element got two
additional CSS classes, both the row-offcanvas and row-offcanvas-right classes are
added. The row-offcanvas class sets a CSS transition for the sliding of the content section,
whilst the row-offcanvas-right class sets the position of the content section for the
menu on the right side of the page. The main element gets an optional col-xs-12 CSS
class. And a toggle button is added:
<div class="pull-xs-right hidden-md-up">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" data-
toggle="offcanvas"><?php _e('Toggle nav', 'jbst-4') ?></button>
</div>
The hidden-md-up class guarantees that the button is only visible on the small viewports.
And finally, the side bar is rendered with the <?php get_sidebar('offcanvas'); ?>
PHP call. Due to the offcanvas parameter, not the default sidebar.php template, the
sidebar-offcanvas.php template is loaded.
The sidebar-offcanvas.php template is similar to the sidebar.php template. Its content
should look like the following:
<div class="col-xs-6 col-md-4 sidebar sidebar-offcanvas" id="sidebar">
    <?php if ( is_active_sidebar( 'offcanvas' ) ) : ?>
        <?php dynamic_sidebar( 'offcanvas' ); ?>
    <?php else : ?>
    <!-- This content shows up if there are no widgets defined in the
backend. -->
    <div class="alert help">
    <p><?php _e("Please activate some Widgets.", "jbst-4");  ?>
</p>
    </div>
    <?php endif; ?>
</div>
The preceding HTML and PHP code got an additional col-xs-6 CSS class and loads the
offcanvas side bar.

The HTML code is ready now. Let's evaluate the SCSS and JavaScript code to finish the
offcanvas menu.
The SCSS code can be found in the Sass partial called _offcanvas.scss in the
assests/scss/includes directory. Make sure that the _offcanvas.scss file is
imported into the styles.scss file as follows:
// templates
@import "includes/offcanvas";
The _offcanvas.scss file itself contains the following SCSS code:
html,
body {
  overflow-x: hidden; /* Prevent scroll on narrow devices */
}
/*
 * Off Canvas
 * --------------------------------------------------
 */
@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {
  .row-offcanvas {
    position: relative;
    transition: all .25s ease-out;
  }
  .row-offcanvas-right {
    right: 0;
  }
  .row-offcanvas-left {
    left: 0;
  }
  .row-offcanvas-right
  .sidebar-offcanvas {
    right: -100%; /* 12 columns */
  }
  .row-offcanvas-right.active
  .sidebar-offcanvas {
    right: -50%; /* 6 columns */
  }
  .row-offcanvas-left
  .sidebar-offcanvas {
    left: -100%; /* 12 columns */
  }
  .row-offcanvas-left.active
  .sidebar-offcanvas {
    left: -50%; /* 6 columns */

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 142 ]
  }
  .row-offcanvas-right.active {
    right: 50%; /* 6 columns */
  }
  .row-offcanvas-left.active {
    left: 50%; /* 6 columns */
  }
  .sidebar-offcanvas {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    width: 50%; /* 6 columns */
  }
}
Last, but not least, we require some JavaScript code to handle the toggle button. In the
assets/scripts/wp-jbst.js we find the following lines of JavaScript code, between the
jQuery(document).ready(function() {}); code:
    // offcanvas menu
    jQuery('[data-toggle="offcanvas"]').click(function () {
      jQuery('.row-offcanvas').toggleClass('active');
    });
In the WordPress Dashboard, navigate to Pages and edit a page. Select the new offcanvas
template under templates as shown in the following screenshot:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 143 ]
Save the page and inspect the results in your browser. When resizing your browser window
to a viewport below 768 pixels you will find that the offcanvas menu works and looks like
that shown in the following screenshot:
Now you can navigate to Appearance | Widgets in the WordPress Dashboard and add
some widgets to the off-canvas side menu. Notice that when your menu become taller than
the content, it will overlap the footer due to the position: absolute; declaration for the off-
canvas menu. You can set a z-index property for the off-canvas menu to fix the overlapping
issue.
To use the new off-canvas template for your front page, you'll have to set a static page as
your front page. Navigate to Settings | Reading in the WordPress Dashboard and select
your page. On the selected page, you'll have to select the template as shown before:

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 144 ]
Instead of changing the front page setting you can also copy the template-
offcanvas.php file to a new home.php or front-page.php. Read the h t t p s : / / d e v e l o p e
r . w o r d p r e s s . o r g / t h e m e s / b a s i c s / t e m p l a t e - h i e r a r c h y / page to learn more about
WordPress' template system.
Applying style to the buttons
Our design contains several buttons now: the button in the footer, the search button, the
toggle button for the off-canvas menu, and also the button of the comment form. Let's find a
better solution to style the button of our theme.
Remember that you can apply Bootstrap's btn and btn-* CSS classes on the <button> tag
and also use them on <a> and <input> tags.
First, create a new Sass partial called assets/scss/includes/_buttons.scss and then
move the btn-accent-color selector into it. The
assets/scss/includes/_buttons.scss file should contain the following SCSS code:
.btn-accent-color {
  @include button-variant(#fff, $accent-color, #fff);
}
Again we'll have two strategies to style the buttons of the theme. We can adopt the HTML
code and make sure that every button has the required btn and btn-* CSS classes. Or
alternatively create some generic CSS selectors to style the buttons.
When using generic selectors in the assets/scss/includes/_buttons.scss file, the
SCSS code may look as follows:
button,
input[type="submit"],
.button {
 @extend .btn;
 @include button-variant(#fff, $accent-color, #fff);
}
Although the preceding selectors are generic, do not style the search button nor the toggle
button of the off-canvas menu. Both the search button and the off-canvas have btn-
primary classes with a higher specificity in the HTML code. On the other hand, the selector
does style the toggle button of the navbar.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 145 ]
Compiling the btn-accent-color CSS class and changing the HTML according to it
seems a more firm strategy in this situation.
Edit the searchform.php file to add the required CSS classes for the search button as
follows:
<button class="btn btn-accent-color " type="button"><?php echo esc_attr_x(
'Search', 'search', 'jbst-4' ) ?></button>
The toggle button for the off-canvas menu can be found in the template-offcanvas.php file
file as seen before. And finally, the button for the comment form is found in the
comments.php in the theme directory. Notice that you should use the PHP function call
here to set the CSS classes as follows:
<?php comment_form(array('class_submit'=>'btn btn-accent-color')); ?>
In the next section, we'll look at the comments in more detail. You can read more about
WordPress' comment_form() PHP function at h t t p s : / / c o d e x . w o r d p r e s s . o r g / F u n c t i o n _

Other tweaks in your Sass
When adding more content, pages, and plugins to your WordPress project you'll find more
elements to style. This chapter provides you with the knowledge and strategies to do it
yourself. The following hints to style the pagination and search form button may help you
to understand how to approach this in the right manner.
The pagination
You probably would have found out that the active links of the navigation did not get the
right background color. You can fix this issue by adding the following lines of SCSS code to
the scss/includes/_variables.scss file:
// pagination
$pagination-active-color: $light-color;
$pagination-active-bg: $accent-color;
$pagination-active-border: #ddd; // $pagination-border-color;

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 146 ]
Search form button
You may have also discovered that the border color of the search button in the side bar does
not look good on a white background. You can use the following SCSS code in the
_main.scss file to fix this:
// search form button
.search-form {
  .input-group-btn {
    .btn {
      border: $input-btn-border-width solid $input-group-addon-border-
color;
    }
  }
}
Before the preceding tweak, you should know that the search button looks like that shown
in the following screenshot:
After the tweak, the button looks as follows:
Styling the user comments on your pages
WordPress enables your users to comment on your blogs. The JBST theme uses Bootstraps'
Media object to display the comments. The media object is an abstract element used as the
basis for building more complex and repetitive components. You can use it to style a HTML
list too. HTML lists are useful to display comments threads.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 147 ]
In the JBST 4 theme, the comments.php file in the main theme folder contains the HTML
and PHP code for the comments. The comments.php file is part of WordPress template
system as described before. It contains the following PHP snippet:
<ol class="commentlist">
    <?php wp_list_comments
        ('type=comment&callback=jbst4_comments'); ?>
</ol>
The jbst4_comments callback function to display the comment list can be found in the
assets/functions/comments.php file, it contains the following HTML and PHP code:
<?php
// Comment Layout
function jbst4_comments($comment, $args, $depth) {
   $GLOBALS['comment'] = $comment; ?>
    <li <?php comment_class('media'); ?>>
            <div class="media-left">
                <?php echo get_avatar
                     ( $comment, 75, '', sprintf
                         ( esc_html__( 'Avatar of %s', 'jbst-4' ),
get_comment_author() ),
                              array('class' => 'media-object')); ?>
            </div>
            <div class="media-body">
                <article id="comment-<?php comment_ID(); ?>
" class="clearfix col-lg-12">
                    <header class="comment-author">

                            $bgauthemail = get_comment_author_email();
                        ?>
                        <?php printf(__('%s', 'jbst-4'),
get_comment_author_link()) ?> on
                        <time datetime="<?php echo comment_time('Y-m-j');
?>">
<a href="<?php echo htmlspecialchars
     (  esc_url(get_comment_link( $comment->comment_ID )) ) ?>">
<?php comment_time(__(' F jS, Y - g:ia', 'jbst-4')); ?> </a></time>

                        <div class="alert alert-info">
                            <p>
<?php _e('Your comment is awaiting moderation.', 'jbst-4') ?></p>
                        </div>

                    <?php endif; ?>
                    <section class="comment_content clearfix">
                        <?php comment_text() ?>

                </article>
            </div>
    <!-- </li> is added by WordPress automatically -->
<?php
}
The preceding code will wrap the comments into a HTML list using the Bootstrap Media
object as follows:
<ul class="media-list">
  <li class="media">
    <div class="media-left">
      <!-- avatar -->
    </div>
    <div class="media-body">
        <!-- comment -->
    </div>
  </li>
  ...

By default, the comments in the JBST 4 theme look like that shown in the following
screenshot:
Now let's style the comments to be consistent with our design. First add a black color and
border in accordance with the color scheme. Edit the
assets/scss/includes/_comments.scss file and add the following SCSS code to it:
.comments-area {
  .media-body {
    padding: $spacer-y $spacer-x;
    margin-top: $spacer-y;
    background-color: $light-color;
    border: 1px solid $gray;
  }
}
Secondly, style the date and author name with the following SCSS code:
.comments-area {
  .comment-author {
    font-size: $font-size-sm
    @extend .text-muted;
  }
}
Instead of the preceding SCSS rules, you can also modify the HTML code in the file. The
HTML code may then look as follows:
<small class="text-muted">
  <time datetime="<?php echo comment_time('Y-m-j'); ?>">
    <a href="<?php echo htmlspecialchars(  esc_url(get_comment_link(
$comment->comment_ID )) ) ?>"><?php comment_time(__(' F jS, Y - g:ia',
'jbst-4')); ?> </a>
  </time>
</small>

After that you may style the reply button. You can use the following SCSS code to style the
buttons:
  .comments-area {
  .comment-reply-link {
    @extend .btn;
    @extend .btn-accent-color;
  }
}
Finally, run the gulp command if you haven't run the gulp watch command already, and
inspect the result in your browser. The comments should now look like that shown in the
following screenshot:
Adding a carousel to your page
Bootstrap's Carousel component enables you to create a slideshow for cycling through
images or slides of text. Of course, you can also add a carousel to your theme.
First you should upload your image to the assets/images/slides directory of your
theme. All images should have the same width and height.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 151 ]
As an example, we have added three images into the assets/images/slides directory
called slide1.jpg, slide2.jpg and slide3.jpg. These images are released in the CC0
Public Domain and you can find them on Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/).
In the next section, we'll use PHP to create the desired HTML output of our template files. If
you are not familiar with PHP yet, the official website can be found at the following URL:
http://php.net/. To learn the basics of PHP you can visit Packt's PHP Tech Page at h t t p s : / /
w w w . p a c k t p u b . c o m / t e c h / p h p.
Now you can create a new template in the parts directory. You may call it component-
carousel.php.
In the component-carousel.php, you'll have to link the images in the assets/images
directory in the HTML / PHP code as follows:
  <div class="carousel-inner" role="listbox">
  <?php for ($i=1; $i<=3; $i++){?>
    <div class="carousel-item<?php echo ($i==1) ? ' active' : ''?>">
      <img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri();
?>/assets/images/slides/slide<?php echo $i ?>.jpg" alt="First slide">
    </div>
  <?php } ?>
  </div>
Bootstrap's carousel markup structure can be found in its documentation pages at the
following URL: h t t p : / / g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / c o m p o n e n t s / c a r o u s e l /.
The complete HTML and PHP code should look like this:
<div id="carousel-example-generic" class="carousel slide" data-
ride="carousel">
  <ol class="carousel-indicators">
    <li data-target="#carousel-example-generic" data-slide-to="0"
class="active"></li>
    <li data-target="#carousel-example-generic"
          data-slide-to="1"></li>
    <li data-target="#carousel-example-generic"
          data-slide-to="2"></li>
  </ol>
  <div class="carousel-inner" role="listbox">
  <?php for ($i=1; $i<=3; $i++){?>
    <div class="carousel-item
         <?php echo ($i==1) ? ' active' : ''?>">
      <img src=
          "<?php echo get_template_directory_uri();
            ?>/assets/images/slides/slide

           <?php echo $i ?>.jpg" alt="First slide">
    </div>
  <?php } ?>
  </div>
  <a class="left carousel-control"
        href="#carousel-example-generic" role="button"
        data-slide="prev">
    <span class="icon-prev" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
  </a>
  <a class="right carousel-control"
        href="#carousel-example-generic"
        role="button" data-slide="next">
    <span class="icon-next" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
  </a>
</div>
Finally, you should load the carousel on your front page. Edit the index.php file in the
theme directory and the following PHP snippet to it:
...
<?php if(is_home()){ get_template_part
     ( 'parts/component', 'carousel' ); } ?>
<?php if (have_posts()) : while
      (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
...
The if(is_home()) conditional ensures that the carousal is only displayed on the front
page.
In Chapter 5, Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio, you can read more about marking up the carousel.
You can reuse the SCSS code for the carousel from Chapter 5, Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio,to
style the carousel in the WordPress theme too by simply copying the _carousel.scss
partial into the assets/scss/includes directory and importing it in the styles.scss
file.
As you have seen, the carousel works very well. When you want to use other images in the
slider, you'll have to replace the images in the assets/images/slides directory.
Replacing the images is no problem when you are the maintainer of the project yourself. In
the case that you distribute the website and theme to someone else you probably would
prefer that they could replace the slider images in the Dashboard.

The WordPress' plugin directory contains many useful plugins to extend your Dashboard.
Plugins for Bootstrap's slider are available too. The plugin directory can be found at h t t p s :
/ / w o r d p r e s s . o r g / p l u g i n s /. The plugin at h t t p s : / / w o r d p r e s s . o r g / p l u g i n s / t w i t t e r - b o
o t s t r a p - s l i d e r / can be used to add a Bootstrap carousel to your WordPress project.
Using Font Awesome in your theme
In Chapter 5, Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio, you can read how to compile the Font Awesome
CSS code into your local style sheet with Sass. You can also run Font Awesome from CDN,
as described in Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp.
To run Font Awesome from CDN in your WordPress theme, you can enqueue the CDN
URL. Edit and add the following line of PHP code to activate Font Awesome:
    //enqueues the external font awesome stylesheet
    wp_enqueue_style('font-awesome', '//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-
awesome/4.6.3/css/font-awesome.min.css');
Building the social links with Font Awesome
The theme contains two blocks with social links; one fixed on the left side of the page and
the other one in the footer. The HTML code for both blocks can be found in the
footer.php file. To prevent code duplication you can create a new template called
parts/components-social-links.php. Then edit the following HTML code into the
new parts/components-social-links.php file:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/bassjobsen">
    <i class="fa fa-twitter fa-fs fa-lg"></i></a></li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://facebook.com/bassjobsen">
    <i class="fa  fa-facebook fa-fs fa-lg"></i></a></li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://google.com/+bassjobsen">
    <i class="fa fa-google-plus fa-fs fa-lg"></i></a>
  </li>
</ul>
In the preceding HTML code, the fa-fs CSS class guarantees that each icon gets the same
width and height. Then in the footer.php file replace both the <ul> list with the following
PHP code:

Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme
[ 154 ]
  <?php get_template_part( 'parts/component', 'social-links' ); ?>
Finally, you'll have to make some small change in your SCSS code for the social media
blocks. First move the SCSS code for the social media block from
_includes/_footer.scss to a new file called _includes/_social-button.scss.
Don't forget to import this new file in the styles.scss file by adding the following SCSS code snippet:
// Components
@import "includes/social-buttons";
The SCSS code in the _includes/_social-button.scss file should look like this:
.social-buttons {
  &.fixed-media {
    display: none;
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      position: fixed;
      top: 150px;
      display: block;
    }
  }
  ul {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    list-style: none;
    li {
      padding: 10px;
      border: 1px solid $accent-color-light;
      a {
        color: $light-color;
      }
    }
  }
  .page-footer & {
    li {
      float: left;
      @extend .bg-accent-color;
    }
  }
  @include clearfix();
}
At the end, your social buttons should like that shown in the following screenshot:

Using the masonry template
A masonry grid layout works by placing elements in an optimal position based on available
vertical space, sort of like a mason fitting stones in a wall. The Cards module of Bootstrap
enables you to organize elements (cards) into masonry-like columns with just CSS. The
Card module is a flexible and extensible content container. It replaces the panels,
thumbnails, and wells used in earlier versions of Bootstrap.
The JBST 4 theme already contains a template for you, which organizes your post into
masonry-like columns.
You can test the masonry template on your front page by copying the template-masonry file
to the front-page.php file. Or select a page using this template as your front page.
The CSS code to display the masonry items in the right manner is compiled from the SCSS
in the assets/sccs/includes/_masonry.scss file. The SCSS code in this file looks as
follows:
.masonary {
  .card-columns {
    padding-top: $spacer-y;
  }
}
.mansory-blog-post {
  position: relative;
  padding: $spacer-y $spacer-x;
  background-color: $light-color;
  border: 1px solid $gray;
}
The masonry grid layout is not available in IE9 and below as they have no
support for the column-* CSS properties.
If you're looking for test data for your theme, you can import the
data.xml found in the download section of this chapter. In the
Dashboard, navigate to Tool | Import. Then choose to install the
WordPress importer to import posts, pages, comments, custom fields,
categories, and tags from a WordPress export file. We use import to
import the data.xml file. You do not have to reassign any author, but you
should check the Download and import file attachments option. More
information about testing your WordPress themes can be found at h t t p s :

Child theming
JBST is a start theme and not a framework. WordPress has a structure to build child themes.
The main purpose of child theming is its ability to upgrade the parent theme easily. JBST 4
is intended to be used as a starter theme, not as a parent or theme framework. In almost all
instances, it is recommended you just hack away and customize JBST 4 itself as described in
this chapter.
You can run Bower to keep Bootstrap's code and its dependencies up to date.
Download at GitHub
You can download the newest and updated version of this theme at GitHub too. You will
find it at the following URL: https://github.com/bassjobsen/jbst-weblog-theme.
Summary
In the chapter, you could see that we could easily reuse the SCSS from Chapter 3,
Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass, by using a WordPress Bootstrap theme which
turns WordPress' HTML code into standard Bootstrap code. Both the SCSS code and the
JBST theme use and reuse Bootstrap's predefined CSS classes whenever possible. This
strategy enables us to write clear code which can be easily reused.
In this chapter, we've built a custom WordPress theme with Bootstrap. Because we began
with the excellent JBST 4 theme as our starter theme, we did not have to build from scratch.
We asserted control over the markup structure by customizing the template files and
created some custom template files. After that we styled buttons and comments using
Bootstrap's styles.
And finally we integrated Bootstrap's carousel component to create an image slider on our
front page and build an off-canvas menu and masonry grid layout for the theme.
Congratulations! That's quite an accomplishment.
The process we've used in this chapter can be used to transform any Bootstrap design into a
WordPress theme.
So, let's turn back to designing with Bootstrap. Next, we are going to design a portfolio site.

5
Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
Let's imagine we're ready for a fresh design of our online portfolio. As always, time is
scarce. We need to be efficient, but the portfolio has to look great. And of course, it has to be
responsive. It should work across devices of various form factors, since this is a key selling
point for our prospective clients. This project will enable us to leverage a number of
Bootstrap's built-in features, even as we customize Bootstrap to suit our needs.
What we'll build
We've thrown together a couple of home page mock-ups. Though we have in mind what we
want for large screens, we've begun with a handheld screen size to force ourselves to focus
on the essentials.
You'll notice the following features:
A collapsed responsive navbar with logo
A sliding carousel with four images of featured portfolio items
A single-column layout with three blocks of content, each with a heading, a short
paragraph, and a nice big button with an invitation to read further
A footer with social media links
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 159 ]
Here is the design mock-up as shown in the following screenshot:

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 160 ]
Altogether, this should provide a good introduction to our work. The carousel is tall
enough to give a good amount of visual space to our portfolio images. It is not difficult to
navigate quickly to the content below, where a user can efficiently scan key options for
taking the next step inside. By presenting key links as nice big buttons, we will establish a
helpful visual hierarchy for the key action items, and we will ensure that visitors do not
have problems because of fat fingers.
For ease of maintenance, we've elected to have only two major breakpoints in this design.
We'll use the single-column layout for screen sizes narrower than 768 px. Then, we'll shift to
a three-column layout:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 161 ]
You'll note the following features in the mock-up for tablets and higher versions:
A navigation bar at the top, which is enhanced with icons
A widescreen version of the home page carousel, with images stretching to fill the
full width of the browser
A three-column layout for our textual content blocks
A footer with content at the center
The color scheme is fairly simple: Shades of gray, plus a golden-green color for links and
highlights.
With these design goals in mind, we'll can move on and get our content in place.
Surveying the exercise files
Let's look at the first few files for this exercise. Create a new project by using Bootstrap CLI,
as already described in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap.
You can install Bootstrap CLI by running the following command in your console:
npm install -g bootstrap-cli
Then you can set up your project by running the following command:
bootstrap new
Again, choose a new empty Bootstrap project. When prompted, select Panini, Sass, and
Gulp option.
You'll see files similar to the template we set up in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap:

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 162 ]
There are a few additions you will have to make now:
Create a new assets/images folder.
Copy the files of the img folder to the new assets/images folder. It contains five
images:
One logo image, named logo.png
Four portfolio item images
Add a new task to the Gulpfile.js file:
        // Copy assets
        gulp.task('copy', function() {
            gulp.src(['assets/**/*']).pipe(gulp.dest('_site'));
         });
And finally, add the preceding task to the default task at the end of the file:
         gulp.task('build', ['clean','copy','compile-js','compile
         sass','compile-html']);
The html folder that contains your Panini HTML templates should have the following file
and folder structure:
You can read more about Panini at h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / z u r b / p a n i n i.
Here are some of the details of the files shown in the preceding screenshot:
The html/pages/index.html file contains the following HTML and template
code:

Content blocks, like that shown beneath:
              <h2>Welcome!</h2>
              <p>Suspendisse et a.....</p>
              <p><a href="#">See our portfolio</a></p>
The includes/header.html file, included in layouts/default.html,
contains our navbar and has the following new touches:
Navbar items have been updated to reflect our new site
architecture:
        <header role="banner">
          <nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-faded" role="navigation">
          <a class="navbar-brand" href="index.html">Bootstrappin'</a>
           <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-md-up pull-xs-right"
         type="button" data-toggle="collapse"
        data-target="#collapsiblecontent">
            ☰
          </button>
          <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-toggleable-sm collapse"
         id="collapsiblecontent">
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link active" href="#">Home <span class="sr-
only">
         (current)</span></a>
             </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="#">Portfolio</a>
            </li>
             <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="#">Team</a>
            </li>
            <li class="nav-item">
              <a class="nav-link" href="#">Contact</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </nav>
        </header>

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 164 ]
The includes/footer.html file, included in layouts/default.html,
contains the following items:
A logo in the footer
Social links:
        <footer role="contentinfo">
            <p><a href="{{root}}index.html"><img
                src="{{root}}images/logo.png"
                width="80" alt="Bootstrappin'"></a></p>
            <ul class="social">
              <li><a href="#" >Twitter</a></li>
              <li><a href="#" >Facebook</a></li>
              <li><a href="#" >LinkedIn</a></li>
              <li><a href="#" >Google+</a></li>
              <li><a href="#" >GitHub</a></li>
            </ul>
        </footer>
Other than the navbar, which we set up in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap, no
Bootstrap classes have been added to style the carousel, columns, or icons yet.
Further on, we'll discuss how to use Sass to customize your project. Now you can see that
the app.scss file imports the includes/_navbar.scss file. The SCSS in the file removes
the floats for the navigation links for smaller screens, as already discussed in Chapter 1,
Getting Started with Bootstrap.
Instead of the preceding modifications, you can also start with the files found in the
chapter5/start folder. In this folder, run the npm install and bower install
commands first. After running npm and bower commands, you can run the bootstrap
watch or gulp command to view the results in your browser.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 165 ]
You'll see the navbar, followed by the portfolio images:

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 166 ]
The blocks of text and the footer, with a list of social links, follow after the images:
It's not much to speak of yet. Let the transformation begin.
We'll start by applying the Bootstrap classes, allowing us to quickly and efficiently establish
the fundamentals for our interface elements using Bootstrap's default CSS styles and
JavaScript behaviors.
Marking up the carousel
Let's get started with our carousel, which will rotate between four featured images from our
portfolio.
Bootstrap's carousel markup structure can be found in its documentation pages at h t t p : / / g
e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / c o m p o n e n t s / c a r o u s e l /.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 167 ]
Following the pattern used in the example, we'll begin with this structure to set up the
fundamental element. This will contain all parts of the carousel, followed by the progress
indicators:
<div id="carousel-feature" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
  <ol class="carousel-indicators">
    <li data-target="#carousel-feature" data-slide-to="0"
class="active"></li>
    <li data-target="#carousel-feature" data-slide-to="1"></li>
    <li data-target="#carousel-feature" data-slide-to="2"></li>
  </ol>
</div>
Note that I've used a div tag with an ID (id=“carousel-feature") to establish the
fundamental context of carousel. The carousel class applies the Bootstrap's carousel CSS
to the carousel elements, adding appropriate styles to the carousel indicators, the carousel
items, and the next and previous controls.
The carousel-feature ID must be used in the data-target attributes of the progress
indicators. This signals the JavaScript plugin to update the indicator for the active carousel
item with the active class. We've provided that class for the first indicator to get things
started. From there, the JavaScript takes over. It removes the class, and adds it to the
appropriate indicator as the carousel cycles.
Also, note that the data-slide-to values begin counting from 0. This is the standard
behavior for JavaScript and other programming languages. Just remember: Start counting at
zero, not one.
After the indicators, the element of the class carousel-inner follows. This serves as the
wrapper to contain all of the carousel items—in this case, our images.
The carousel items come within carousel-inner. They are a group of div tags, each with
class="item". Modify the first item to have both the classes item and active, to make it
visible from the outset.
Thus, the markup structure works as follows:
<!-- Wrapper for slides -->
<div class="carousel-inner" role="listbox">
    <div class="carousel-item active">
        <img src="{{root}}images/project1.png" alt="Streetart.com
Homepage">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 168 ]
        <img src="{{root}}images/project2.png" alt="Your bussiness">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
        <img src="{{root}}images/project3.png" alt="Your blog">
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
        <img src="{{root}}images/project4.png" alt="Menstrualcups.eu
Homepage">
    </div>
</div><!-- /.carousel-inner -->
After the carousel items, we need to add the carousel controls. These will provide the next
and previous buttons at the left and right edges of the carousel. After the controls, we'll
close up our entire markup structure with the closing div tag:
<!-- Controls -->
  <a class="left carousel-control" href="#carousel-feature" role="button"
data-slide="prev">
    <span class="icon-prev" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
  </a>
  <a class="right carousel-control" href="#carousel-feature" role="button"
data-slide="next">
    <span class="icon-next" aria-hidden="true"></span>
    <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
  </a>
</div><!-- /#homepage-feature.carousel -->
The carousel controls need to have the ID of the fundamental carousel
element (#carousel-feature) for their href value. The code, then, looks
like this:
<a class="left carousel-control" href="#carousel-feature"
role="button" data-slide="prev">
Now you can write down the complete code for the carousel in the file.
Once this code is in place, run the gulp command if you didn't run the
bootstrap watch already. Bootstrap's styles and JavaScript should start
working. Your images should now work as a sliding carousel!
Notice that the carousel component requires both jQuery and the JavaScript plugin. The
Gulp build process merges jQuery and all plugin code into a single app.js file.
By default, the carousel will slide every 5 seconds. Let's set the interval to 2 seconds to give
our users time to appreciate the full beauty of our work:
Create a new file called js/main.js.
1.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 169 ]
Add the following lines. We'll begin with the jQuery method of checking to
2.
ensure page elements are ready, and then initialize the carousel with an interval
of 2,000 milliseconds:
      $( document ).ready(function() {
        $('.carousel').carousel({
          interval: 2000
        });
      });
Notice that you should automatically copy the js/main.js file from the assets
3.
folder and link it in the file, or add it to the compile-js task in your
Gulpfile.js file:
      gulp.task('compile-js', function() {
        return gulp.src([bowerpath+
       'jquery/dist/jquery.min.js', bowerpath+
       'tether/dist/js/tether.min.js', bowerpath+
       'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js','js/main.js'])
     .pipe(concat('app.js'))
     .pipe(gulp.dest('./_site/js/'));
    });
You should also consider adding the js/main.js file to the Gulp watch
task. You can read more about Gulp and the Gulp tasks in Chapter 2,
Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp.
Save and restart your application. You will see that the interval has increased to 2
4.
seconds.
Instead of passing the options via JavaScript as we did just now, you can also pass them via
data attributes. The interval of the carousel can be set via the data-interval attribute:
<div id="carousel-feature" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel"
data-interval="2000">
For this and other options, see the Bootstrap carousel documentation at h t t p : / / g e t b o o t s t r
a p . c o m / j a v a s c r i p t / # c a r o u s e l.
We'll return to customize the styling of the carousel, its indicators, and its icons later in the
chapter. In the next section, you will learn how to use both JavaScript and CSS (SCSS) to
modify the working of the carousel.

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 170 ]
How does the carousel work?
The jQuery plugin changes the CSS classes of the items of the carousel. When the page
loads, the first item already has the active class; when the interval has passed, the plugin
moves the active class to the next item, and so on. The plugin not only changes the
position of the active class, but also temporally adds the next and left classes. Together
with the CSS3 animations on these classes, the sliding effect is created. You can read more
about CSS3 animations at the following URL:
h t t p s : / / d e v e l o p e r . m o z i l l a . o r g / e n - U S / d o c s / W e b / C S S / C S S _ A n i m a t i o n s / U s i n g _ C S S _ a n
i m a t i o n s.
The transition is set on the carousel-inner class as follows:
transition: transform .6s ease-in-out;
In this declaration, the ease-in-out value sets the transition-timing-function of the
animation (transition effect); for more information, see h t t p s : / / d e v e l o p e r . m o z i l l a . o r g /
e n / d o c s / W e b / C S S / t r a n s i t i o n - t i m i n g - f u n c t i o n. In essence, it lets you establish an
acceleration curve, so that the speed of the transition can vary over its duration. Later on,
we'll see that you can also use keyframes to describe the different states of the transition.
The transformations performed are translate3ds. The translate3d() CSS function moves
the position of the element in the 3D space. More information can be found at
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-
function/translate3d. The carousel moves the carousel items over the X-axis as follows:
      &.next,
      &.active.right {
        left: 0;
        transform: translate3d(100%, 0, 0);
      }
Changing the carousel by adding new animations
When we replace the CSS animation as described in the previous section with another
animation, the carousel's slider effect changes.
The Animate.css project by Daniel Ede contains a lot of CSS animations for you to use in
your projects. You can use these animations for our carousel too. You can find the library at

We can create the new animation with SCSS code. Because our build process already runs
the autoprefixer, you don't need to take the vendor prefixes into account. In our
example, we'll use the flipInX animation of the Animate.css library, which rotates the
images over the x axis.
Now add the following SCSS code at the end of the scss/includes/_carousel.scss file:
@keyframes flipInX {
  from {
    transform: perspective(400px) rotate3d(1, 0, 0, 90deg);
    animation-timing-function: ease-in;
    opacity: 0;

If ran the bootstrap watch or gulp command already, you can inspect the results in the
browser. You'll find that the images rotate over the x-axis now.
JavaScript events of the Carousel plugin
Bootstrap provides custom events for most plugins' unique actions. The Carousel plugin
fires the slide.bs.carousel (at the beginning of the slide transition) and
slid.bs.carousel (at the end of the slide transition) events. You can use these events to
add custom JavaScript code. You can, for instance, change the background color of the body
on the events by adding the following JavaScript into the js/main.js file:
$('.carousel').on('slide.bs.carousel', function () {
  $('body').css('background-
color','#'+(Math.random()*0xFFFFFF<<0).toString(16));
});
Note that the gulp watch task is not set for the js/main.js file, so you have to run the
gulp or bootstrap watch command manually after you are done with the changes.
For more advanced changes to the plugin's behavior, you can overwrite its methods by
using, for instance, the following JavaScript code:
!function($) {
var number = 0;
    var tmp = $.fn.carousel.Constructor.prototype.cycle;
    $.fn.carousel.Constructor.prototype.cycle = function (relatedTarget) {
        // custom JavaScript code here
        number = (number % 4) + 1;
        $('body').css('transform','rotate('+ number * 90 +'deg)');
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio

        tmp.call(this); // call the original function
    };
}(jQuery);
This code sets the transform CSS property without vendor prefixes. The autoprefixer only
prefixes your static CSS code. For full browser compatibility, you should add the vendor
prefixes in the JavaScript code yourself.
Bootstrap exclusively uses CSS3 for its animations, but Internet Explorer 9
doesn't support the necessary CSS properties.
Let's continue leveraging the power of Bootstrap's default styles and set up a responsive
grid for the content below the carousel.
Creating responsive columns
We have three blocks of text, each with a heading, a short paragraph, and a link. In screen
sizes of approximately tablet width or more, we would like this content to be laid out in
three columns. In narrower screen widths, the content will organize itself in one full-width
column.
Take a moment to visit and read the documentation for Bootstrap's mobile-first responsive
grid. You can find it at h t t p : / / g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / c s s / # g r i d.
In short, the grid is based on a 12-column system. The basic class structure allows us to use
a class of col-12 for full width, col-6 for half width, col-4 for one-third width, and so
on.
Thanks to the creative use of media queries, Bootstrap's grid can be very adept at
responding to different screen sizes. Recall that we want our welcome message to have a
single-column layout up for screens to tablet-size, and then adapt a three-column layout at
approximately 768 px for larger screens. Conveniently, Bootstrap has a built-in breakpoint
at 768 px, which is the default value defined in the $grid-breakpoints Sass variable.
Above 768 px is the large range, beginning at 992 px, also defined in the $grid-
breakpoints Sass variable, then the extra-large screen, measured at 1,200 px and higher.
I'll refer to these as Bootstrap's extra-small, small, medium, large, and extra-large
breakpoints.

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 176 ]
With the medium breakpoint, there is a special column class that uses the formulation col-
md-. Because we want three columns after the small breakpoint, we'll use class="col-
md-4". Below the medium breakpoint, the elements will remain full-width. Above it, they
will shift to one-third width and line up side by side. Notice that the navbar also collapses
at 768 px. The full structure is given here, with paragraph contents abbreviated for clarity:
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Suspendisse et arcu felis ...</p>
    <p><a href="#">See our portfolio</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h2>Recent Updates</h2>
    <p>Suspendisse et arcu felis ...</p>
    <p><a href="#">See what's new!</a></p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <p>Suspendisse et arcu felis ...</p>
    <p><a href="#">Meet the team!</a></p>
  </div>
  </div><!-- /.row -->
</div><!-- /.container →
You should edit the preceding code in the html/pages/index.html file.
If you're unfamiliar with the container and row classes, here is what they do:
The container class constrains the width of the content and keeps it centered
within the page
The row class provides the wrapper for our columns, allowing extra left and right
margins for the column gutters
Both the container class and the row class are clearfixed so that they contain
floating elements and clear any previous floating elements

Now, save the file and run the bootstrap watch or gulp command if you have not
already done so. With your browser width above 768 px, you should see the following
three-column layout take shape:
Resize your browser window below 768 px, and you'll see it revert to a single column:
With our responsive grid in place, let's turn those links into clearly visible calls to action by
utilizing Bootstrap's button styles.

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 178 ]
Turning links into buttons
Turning our key content links into visually effective buttons is straightforward. The key
classes we'll employ are as follows:
The btn class will style a link as a button.
The btn-primary class will assign a button the color of our primary brand color.
The pull-xs-right class will float the link to the right, moving it into wider
space to make it a more appealing target. The xs part of the class name means
that it should be applied on every viewport wider than the extra-small
breakpoint of 0 pixels. The pull-md-right class only floats the elements on
viewports wider than 768 px.
Add these classes to the link at the end of each of our three content blocks:
<p><a class="btn btn-primary pull-xs-right" href="#">See our
portfolio</a></p>
Save. You should see the following result:
We've made great progress. Our key elements are taking shape.
With our fundamental markup structure in place, we can start working on the finer details.
Getting there will require some custom CSS. We're going to approach this by leveraging the
power of Bootstrap's Sass files. If you're new to Sass, no worries! I'll walk you through it
step by step and you can also read Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass
for the same.

Understanding the power of Sass
In the following sections, we will be organizing, editing, customizing, and creating SCSS
files in order to generate the desired CSS for our designs.
If you are unfamiliar with Sass and would like to learn more about it, I
would recommend reading my Sass and Compass Designer's Cookbook book
( h t t p s : / / w w w . p a c k t p u b . c o m / w e b - d e v e l o p m e n t / s a s s - a n d - c o m p a s s - d e s
i g n e r s - c o o k b o o k) or the documentation at h t t p s : / / w w w . s a s s - l a n g . c o m
/.
In a nutshell, we may say that generating CSS using the Sass preprocessor is an exciting and
freeing experience. The key benefits of working with Sass are discussed in the following
sections.
Customizing Bootstrap's Sass according to
our needs
As we work with Bootstrap's Sass files, we'll exert considerable control over them by doing
the following:
Organizing our scss folder to give us the flexibility and freedom to accomplish
what we need while making future maintenance easier
Customizing Bootstrap's Sass variables
Creating a few custom Sass files of our own
Incorporating a set of font-based icons in our site assets, providing the icons that
we need for our social media links
In other words, we'll be doing more than merely learning and applying Bootstrap's
conventions. We'll be bending them to our will.

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 180 ]
In this chapter's exercise files, open the scss directory. Inside, you should see the following
structure:
To prepare for what's ahead, I've given you a head start by explaining the new layer of
organization. All of Bootstrap's Sass files are saved in the
bower_components/bootstrap/scss/ folder. You should not modify these files; you
can (re)use them as described in the next sections. Keeping the original files untouched
enables you to update Bootstrap without undoing your modifications.
First, the app.scss file imports two partial files:
@import "includes/variables";
@import "includes/bootstrap";
The file includes/_bootstrap.scss is a modified copy of the original bootstrap.scss
file. This file imports all other original Bootstrap files, and it is used in the compiling
process to create one unified style sheet from all of our imported Sass files. The
includes/_variables.scss file is a modified copy of the original _variables.scss
file. This file contains the declaration of all Bootstrap's Sass variables. Because the
includes/_variables.scss file is imported before the original _variables.scss file,
the variables in it can be used to overwrite Bootstrap's default settings.
Why go through this trouble? Because we'll soon be modifying Bootstrap's default settings
and creating custom Sass files of our own. When we do that, we can leave the Bootstrap
folder and its files as they are while making adjustments in the custom files that we will
create.
Let's begin the customization! We'll start by customizing Bootstrap's variables and adding a
few new variables of our own.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 181 ]
Customizing variables
Next, we'll create a copy of Bootstrap's variables file and customize it to our needs:
Find the includes/_variables.scss file in the scss folder and open it in
1.
your editor.
Scanning through the lines of this file, you'll see the variables used to set the CSS
2.
values for everything from basic colors to the body background, font-families,
navbar height and background, and so on. It's beautiful to behold. It's even more
fun to meddle with. Before we meddle, let's create our own copy of this file,
allowing us to leave Bootstrap's default variables intact in case we ever want to
revert back to them.
Next, let's implement our new color scheme:
In the topmost section of our new includes/_variables.scss file, you'll see
1.
the default Bootstrap variables for grays and brand colors:
      $gray-dark:                 #373a3c;
      $gray:                      #55595c;
      $gray-light:                #818a91;
      $gray-lighter:              #eceeef;
      $gray-lightest:             #f7f7f9;
We have the specific values that we're after. So, let's simply substitute our desired
2.
values (feel free to do the math if you prefer!). Then, we'll add an additional two
variables to encompass the full range that we need. The result is as follows:
      $gray-dark:              #454545;
      $gray:                   #777;
      $gray-light:             #aeaeae;
      $gray-lighter:           #ccc;
      $gray-lightest:          #ededed;
Next, we'll update the $brand-primary variable under Brand colors. We'll
3.
adjust this to our golden hue:
      // Brand colors
      // -------------------------
      $brand-primary:         #c1ba62;

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 182 ]
When you run the bootstrap watch (or gulp) command already, your browser
4.
automatically reloads after saving the includes/_variables.scss file.
If this is successful, the most noticeable changes will be in the link color and buttons with
the btn-primary class, which will both take the new $brand-primary color.
Customizing the navbar
Now, let's edit the variables that set the navbar height, colors, and hover effects.
Let's start by changing the height. The navbar has a padding of $spacer / 2 by default,
and the total height is set by the font size and the vertical padding.
In the local includes/_variables.scss file, search for the $navbar-padding-
vertical variable and update it as follows. This will expand the navbar height:
$navbar-padding-vertical: $spacer;
Now we can set the background color of the navbar. The original HTML code in the
html/includes/headers.html file had a bg-faded class. Because we want a white
background color for our navbar, we can simply remove this class; the body already has a
white background, and not setting the background property for the navbar will color the
navbar white too.
You can also use Sass and Bootstrap's mixins to generate a new bg-white class. Create a
new file scss/includes/_backgrounds.scss and edit the following SCSS into it:
@include bg-variant('.bg-white', #fff);
Note that the bg-variant mixin declares the background-color and color properties
with !important. Because the color property is set to #fff (white) by default, using the
bg-variant mixin does not seem to be the most flexible solution. Setting the background-
color property for the navbar selector in the scss/includes/_navbar.scss file is a
better solution. You can set the background-color property as follows:
.navbar {
 background-color: #fff;
}
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 183 ]
The color of the navbar links is set by the .navbar-light or .navbar-dark classes. You
should use the .navbar-dark class for navbars with a dark background and .navbar-
light for light background. Our navbar in the html/includes/header.html file has got
the .navbar-light class, so in order to change the link colors, you'll have to modify the
$navbar-light-* variables in the includes_variables.scss file as follows:
    $navbar-light-color:            $gray;
    $navbar-light-hover-color:      $link-hover-color;
    $navbar-light-active-color:     $link-hover-color;
    $navbar-light-disabled-color:   $gray-lighter;
Note that we've already changed the $gray and $gray-lighter variables before, and the
$link-hover-color variable has got the same value as the $brand-primary variable
which we have set to the #c1ba62; color value.
If you like having a different background color for the hovered and active links, you can
open the scss/includes/_navbar.scss file with your favorite text editor and perform
the following steps:
First, remove the vertical padding with the following SCSS code:
1.
      .navbar {
        padding-top: 0;
        padding-bottom: 0;
      }
Now apply the padding on the .nav-link selectors and set the background
2.
color for the hover and active states:
        .navbar {
          .nav-link
          {
            padding: $spacer;
            &:hover,
            &.active {
              background-color: $gray-lightest;
            }
          }
        }
Because the .navbar-brand has a larger font size, you will have to correct the
3.
padding for this selector:
      .navbar {
        .navbar-brand {
          padding: ($spacer - ((($font-size-lg - $font-

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 184 ]
            size-base) * $line-height) / 2));
        }
      }
If you did not run the bootstrap watch command already, run it now and you should see
the following new features in your navbar:
It should grow about 16px (2 x 1em) taller
Its background color should turn white
The nav item backgrounds change on hover and active states
Link text should activate our brand-primary color on hover and when active, as
shown in the following screenshot:
Now, let's put our logo image in place.
Adding the logo image
Find the logo.png file in the assets/images folder. You may notice that its dimensions are
large, 900 px wide. In our final design, it will be only 120 px wide. Because the pixels will be
compressed into a smaller space, this is a relatively easy way to ensure that the image will
look good on all devices, including retina displays. Meanwhile, the file size of the image,
which has already been optimized for the Web, is only 19 KB.
So, let's put it in place and constrain its width:
Open the html/includes/header.html file in your text editor.
1.
Search for this line within the navbar markup:
2.
      <a class="navbar-brand"
       href="index.html">Bootstrappin'</a>
Replace the HTML from the previous step with the following image tag,
3.
including its alt and width attributes:
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="index.html"><img src="
      {{root}}/images/logo.png" alt="Bootstrappin'"
        width="120"></a>
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 185 ]
Be sure to include the width attribute, setting its width to 120 px.
Otherwise, it will appear very large on the page.
If you didn't run the bootstrap watch command already, run it now. You should see the
logo in place:
You may notice that the navbar height has expanded, and that its bottom edge no longer
lines up with the bottom edge of the active nav item. This is due to the padding placed
around the bar-brand class earlier. We need to adjust the appropriate padding values. We
can do that in a few quick steps:
Use your text editor to open the scss/includes/_navbar.scss file again.
1.
Change the padding of the bar-brand class as follows:
        padding: ($spacer - ((2.16rem - ($font-size-base * $line-
             height)) / 2));
When resizing the width of the image to 120 px, its height becomes around 34.51
2.
pixels, 34.51 / 16 = 2.16 rem.
The powers of Sass continue to impress. Of course, we should also take care of the collapsed
responsive navigation, so resize your browser to a viewport smaller than 768 px.
The navigation should now look like that shown in the following screenshot:

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 186 ]
You will see that there is not enough padding around the logo and that the toggle button is
not in line with the logo. We will use Sass again to correct these issues. Again, open the
scss/includes/_navbar.scss file. Remember that we set the vertical padding of the
navbar to 0 before. Now wrap this declaration into a CSS media query as follows to only
apply it for the larger viewports:
  @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    padding-top: 0;
    padding-bottom: 0;
  }
As already explained, the media-breakpoint-up mixin is part of Bootstrap's Sass mixin
and can be used to hide or show elements according to Bootstrap's media query ranges. The
SCSS preceding code compiles into CSS as follows:
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .navbar {
    padding-top: 0;
    padding-bottom: 0;
  }
}
To get the logo in line with the toggle button, you will have to change the display
property of the logo image from block to inline-block. You can establish that by editing
the following SCSS code in the scss/includes/_navbar.scss file:
.navbar {
  @include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {
    .navbar-brand,
    .nav-item {
      float: none;
      > img {
        display: inline-block;
      }
    }
  }
}

Finally, inspect the latest version of your scss/includes/_navbar.scss file. In your
browser, the results should look like the following screenshot:
Now, let's add icon powers.
Adding icons
It's time to add icons to our navigation. Glyphicons that come with Bootstrap 3 are dropped
in Bootstrap 4. Here, we'll use the large library of icons offered by Font Awesome. Other 
icon font sets can be found around the Web.
Font Awesome is a font icon set that offers 628 icons at the time of writing this book. Font
Awesome icons are free, open source, and built to play nice with Bootstrap. You can see the 
Font Awesome home page at h t t p : / / f o r t a w e s o m e . g i t h u b . i o / F o n t - A w e s o m e /.
Let's fold Font Awesome into our workflow.
In Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp, you saw to use Font Awesome by
loading it from CDN. Here, we compile the CSS code of Font Awesome into our main
app.css file:
First, install Font Awesome in your project folder by running the following
1.
command in your console:
      bower install font-awesome --save

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 188 ]
After that, you can import Font Awesome's main SCSS file into your
2.
scss/app.scss file:
      @import "includes/variables";
      @import "font-awesome/scss/font-awesome.scss";
      @import "includes/bootstrap";
      @import "includes/navbar";
Last but not least, copy the font files to your assets folder:
3.
      cp bower_components/font-awesome/fonts/*
       assets/fonts/
The Font Awesome scss files include a variable specifying the path to the Font
4.
Awesome web fonts. We need to check to make sure that this variable matches
our folder structure. Ensure that the $fa-font-path variable is set to ../fonts
as follows in our scss/includes/_variables.scss file:
         $fa-font-path:    "../fonts";
This path is relative to the compiled CSS file, which is in our css directory
Now, in the html/includes/header.html file, let's update the icon for the
Team navbar item to use the Font Awesome icon named fa-group. We also
need the standalone fa class: <i class="fa fa-group"></i> Team
Save this change to the html/includes/header.html file, and refresh your
5.
browser.
If all works as it should, you should see the following result:
If you see a strange symbol or nothing, that's a sign that the web fonts are
not coming through. Double-check that your icon classes are correct
(including the fa class), your Font Awesome web font files are in your
fonts directory, and the path is set correctly in the
scss/includes/_variables.scss file.

Now update your icon markup in the html/includes/header.html file to make use of
the desired Font Awesome icons.
The Font Awesome icon page h t t p : / / f o r t a w e s o m e . g i t h u b . i o / F o n t - A w e s o m e / i c o n s /
allows you to scan your options. Our mock-up calls for these icons in the navbar:
<i class="fa fa-home"></i> Home
<i class="fa fa-desktop"></i> Portfolio
<i class="fa fa-group"></i> Team
<i class="fa fa-envelope"></i> Contact
This has the following result:
This completes our nav, or almost completes it. We've inadvertently created a small
problem that we need to fix before moving on.
It's time to move on to the carousel.
Styling the carousel
We're going to take Bootstrap's default carousel styles and apply some significant
customization. Let's create a new _scss/includes/carousel.scss file and import it into
our scss/app.scss file.
Now to begin customizing and making aesthetic enhancements.
Adding top and bottom padding
Let's add some top and bottom padding to the .carousel element itself and add our
@gray-lighter color for a background color:
.carousel {
  padding-top: 4px; // added
  padding-bottom: 28px; // added
  background-color: @gray-lighter; // added
}

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 190 ]
After saving and reloading (run the bootstrap watch or gulp command), you'll see the
light gray background appears in our newly created space above and below the carousel
images. This provides a bit of framing to set them off from the other elements above and
below. In a bit, we'll take advantage of the extra bottom padding to position our carousel
indicators in a way that allows them to stand out much more clearly.
Now to style the carousel indicators.
Repositioning the carousel indicators
The carousel indicators serve to inform the user how many slides are in our carousel, and
highlight the current spot in the rotation. At present, these indicators are barely visible,
languishing near the bottom center edge of our portfolio images:
Note that I have temporarily set the border color to white to make the preceding picture as
follows:
.carousel-indicators li {
  border: 1px solid white;
}
Let's move these indicators into their own space, just below the image:
We want to move the indicators down even closer to the bottom edge, into our
1.
light gray area created by the padding we added previously. So, let's adjust the
bottom positioning. In addition, we need to remove the default bottom margin by
zeroing it out. Write down the following SCSS in the
_scss/includes/carousel.scss file:
      .carousel-indicators {
       position: absolute;
        bottom: 0;
        margin-bottom: 0;
      }
Save the file; if you have run the bootstrap watch command already, your
2.
browser automatically reloads.

This brings our desired result. The indicators now stay positioned in the desired space
across all screen dimensions:
Now let's update their appearance to make them larger and easier to see.
Styling the indicators
We'll make our carousel indicators more visible by using our gray variables. We'll also
increase their size a bit. We can get a start in our scss/includes/_variables.scss file:
In scss/includes/_variables.scss, just after the $carousel-control
1.
variables, you'll find two variables beginning with $carousel-indicator:
         $carousel-indicator-active-bg:          #fff;
         $carousel-indicator-border-color:       #fff;
These are used to provide a white border around the default indicators, and
then fill the active indicator with the background color.
Let's add a default background color variable here, so that we may fill the default
2.
indicators with our $gray-light value:
        $carousel-indicator-bg:          $gray-light;
Then, we'll update the active background color:
3.
        $carousel-indicator-active-bg:    $gray-lightest;
Finally, we'll make the border color transparent:
4.
        @carousel-indicator-border-color: transparent;
Save, compile, and refresh.
5.
At present, this has the effect of making all but the active item invisible:

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 192 ]
Now for some work in the _scss/includes/_carousel.scss file:
In the _scss/includes/_carousel.scss file, move to the first set of rules for
1.
.carousel-indicator where we were previously working:
          .carousel-indicators {
            position: absolute;
Look for the li selector nested under it. Here, let's edit several values.
2.
Specifically, we'll perform the following actions:
Increase the width and height to 16px
Remove the margin
Add background color using our newly created variable $carousel-
indicator-bg
Remove the border line altogether (the transparent value we set for the
border variable is now merely a failsafe)
I've implemented these changes in the following code snippet:
               .carousel-indicators {
               position: absolute;
               bottom: 0;
               margin-bottom: 0;
               li {
               background-color: $carousel-indicator-bg;
               &,
              &.active {
              border: 0;
              height: 16px;
              width: 16px;
              margin: 0;
             }
            }
            }
In Bootstrap's default CSS, the active indicators are a little larger (12 px) than
3.
normal indicators (10 px); because of that, you have to set the new size (16 px) for
both the normal and active indicators. You can accomplish that by using the Sass
and parent reference as in the preceding code snippet. Consider the following
snippet of SCSS code:
       .selector {
        &,
        &.active,
        &.otherstate {
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 193 ]
          property: equal-for-all-states;
        }
      }
This SCSS code compiles in CSS code like the one shown here:
4.
      .selector, .selector.active, .selector.otherstate {
        property: equal-for-all-states;
      }
Save, and check out the result!
Carousel adjustments accomplished! We've learned a lot in the process—a lot about
Bootstrap and perhaps a little about Sass as well.
Let's move on to the next section. What remains is considerably simpler.
Tweaking the columns and their content
Let's fine-tune the blocks of content under the three headings Welcome!, Recent Updates,
and Our Team:
First, let's add the arrow-circle icon to the button in each of these three blocks.
1.
Recall that we're using Font Awesome for our icon selection.

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 194 ]
Visit the Font Awesome documentation at
2.
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/. You'll find the icon that
we're after:
In the html/pages/index.html file, add an i tag with the appropriate classes
3.
inside each link. Here is the first one, which I've spaced out by adding an extra
carriage return between elements:
      <p>
        <a class="btn btn-primary pull-right" href="#">
          See our portfolio  <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-
            right"></i>
        </a>
      </p>
Repeat for each link.
4.
You should now have the desired icon in each of the three buttons:
While we're at it, let's add a bit of vertical padding between the carousel and this section of
text. Right now, it's pretty tight.
The question that comes up at this point is where best to compose the styles that we'll need
for this; adding extra padding around page content sections will likely be a pretty normal
practice for us now and in the future. Let's create a Sass file to hold these and other tweaks
to the ordinary contents of pages (as it happens, we'll need this file for an additional and
more important responsive adjustment, so it seems well justified):
Create a file named scss/includes/_page-contents.scss.
1.
Save it in your scss folder alongside your other custom Sass files:
2.
      <image of the directory scss>
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 195 ]
Comment the file:
3.
      //
      // Page Contents
      // --------------------------
Now, let's create a sensible class for this purpose and add our desired padding,
4.
including some padding for the bottom:
      .page-contents {
        padding-top: 20px;
        padding-bottom: 40px;
      }
Save the file.
5.
Add the scss/includes/_page-contents.scss file to the imports in the
6.
scss/main.scss file. I'll add mine in a new section near the bottom of the file
and include a helpful comment for orientation purposes:
      // Other custom files
      @import "includes/page-contents";
Now let's add the necessary class to our markup. Open the
7.
html/pages/index.html file and add the class page-contents to the div
with the class container, which follows just after the carousel including:
            {{> carousel}}<!-- /#homepage-feature.carousel -->
            <div class="page-contents container">
              <div class="row">
Save, and you should see the padding added.
Next, we need to tidy up the narrow-screen view of these blocks. Note that, when viewed in
single-column layout, the headings do not clear the floated buttons:

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 196 ]
Fixing this is just a little tricky. We might want to add a clear fix to the div containing each
of these three blocks. However, that won't work because we need these blocks to float side
by side once the viewport width is 768 px or higher.
This calls for a media query. Knowing that our three-column view begins at the medium
breakpoint, or 768 px, let's set a rule to clear floats when the window is 1 pixel below this
breakpoint. As seen before, we can use Bootstrap's Sass media query mixin to do this.
While we're at it, let's also add some bottom padding to our columns so that they have a bit
of extra vertical breathing room when stacked.
Inside the media query mixin, we'll add a CSS2 attribute selector to select all elements with
a class that contains col-, so that the same rules will apply to a column of any size:
.page-contents {
  padding-top: 20px;
  padding-bottom: 40px;
  @include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {
    [class*="col-"] {
      clear: both;
      padding-bottom: 40px;
    }
  }
}

Save. The result is much improved!
Much better! Now let's move on to the footer!
Styling the footer
The biggest feature of the footer is our social icons. Font Awesome to the rescue!
Consulting the Font Awesome documentation, we find a slew of available icons under the
category of Brand Icons. Here is the direct link:
h t t p : / / f o r t a w e s o m e . g i t h u b . i o / F o n t - A w e s o m e / i c o n s / # b r a n d
Now we only need to replace the text for each social link in our footer, in the
html/includes/footer.html file, with i elements, using the appropriate classes:
<ul class="social">
  <li><a href="#" ><i class="fa      fa-twitter"></i></a></li>
  <li><a href="#" ><i class="fa      fa-facebook"></i></a></li>
  <li><a href="#" ><i class="fa      fa-linkedin"></i></a></li>
  <li><a href="#" ><i class="fa fa-     google-plus"></i></a></li>
  <li><a href="#" ><i class="fa fa-     github-alt"></i></a></li>
</ul>

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio

This updated markup puts our icons in place:
Now, perform the following steps to lay them out horizontally and align them to the center:
Create a new file, scss/includes/_footer.scss, to manage these styles.
1.
Save the file to the scss directory.
2.
Add an import variable for this file in __main.less:
3.
      // Other custom files
      @import "includes/navbar";
      @import "includes/carousel";
      @import "includes/page-contents";
      @import "includes/footer";
Now we'll write the styles we need. Let me simply lay them out, and then list what they do:
//
// Footer
// --------------------------
ul.social {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
  > li {
    display: inline-block;
    > a {
      display: inline-block;
      font-size: 18px;
      line-height: 30px;
      @include square(30px); // see includes/mixins/_size.scss
      border-radius: 36px;
      background-color: $gray-light;
      color: #fff;
      margin: 0 3px 3px 0;
      &:hover,
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 199 ]
    &:focus    {
        text-decoration: none;
        background-color: $link-hover-color;
      }
    }
  }
}
Because Bootstrap tries to avoid both element and child selectors in Sass, you can consider
rewriting the preceding SCSS code as follows:
.social {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
}
.social-item {
 display: inline-block;
}
.social-link {
  display: inline-block;
  font-size: 18px;
  line-height: 30px;
  @include square(30px);
  // see includes/mixins/_size.scss
  border-radius: 36px;
  background-color: $gray-light;
  color: #fff;
  margin: 0 3px 3px 0;
  @include hover-focus {
    // bootstrap/scss/mixins/_hover.scss
    text-decoration: none;
    background-color: $link-hover-color;
    color: #fff;
  }
}
When you're using the latest SCSS code to compile your CSS code, you also have to modify
your HTML code according to it. Modify the HTML of the footer links in the
html/includes/footer.html file so that it looks like the snippet shown here:
            <ul class="social">
              <li class="social-item"><a href="#" class="social-link" ><i
class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li>
              <li class="social-item"><a href="#" class="social-link" ><i

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio
[ 200 ]
class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li>
              <li class="social-item"><a href="#" class="social-link" ><i
class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li>
              <li class="social-item"><a href="#" class="social-link" ><i
class="fa fa-google-plus"></i></a></li>
              <li class="social-item"><a href="#" class="social-link" ><i
class="fa fa-github-alt"></i></a></li>
            </ul>
Here's what's happening:
The normal margin and padding is stripped away from the ul
It is stretched to 100 percent width
Its content is center aligned
The list items are displayed inline to the block, thereby centering them
The links are displayed inline to block, so that they fill up their available space
The font size and line height are increased
The width and height are set to 30px square, using a custom mixin (note that this
mixin is copied from Bootstrap 3)
To see this mixin, open includes/mixins/_size.scss, and you'll find the
following relevant lines:
// Sizing shortcuts
@mixin size($width, $height) {
  width: $width;
  height: $height;
}
@mixin square($size) {
  @include size($size, $size);
}
The border-radius property is set large enough to make the icons and their
backgrounds appear circular
The background-color, color, and margin properties are set
The underline is removed from the hover and focus states, and the background
color is altered to a lighter gray

With these steps done, let's polish off the footer by adding a healthy bit of top and bottom
padding, and then center aligning the content in order to move our logo to the center, above
the social icons:
footer[role="contentinfo"] {
  padding-top: 24px;
  padding-bottom: 36px;
  text-align: center;
}
The result is as follows:
Recommended next steps
Let me strongly recommend at least one additional step you'll need to take before taking a
project like this to production. It's imperative that you take time to optimize your images,
CSS, and JavaScript. These steps are not difficult:
Compressing images takes just a bit of time, and it addresses the single largest
cause for large page footprints. I've already used the save to web process option of
Photoshop, but chances are you can squeeze a few more bytes out. In Chapter 2,
Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp, you can see how to add an image
compress task to your gulp build process.
In addition, we badly need to remove unneeded Bootstrap Sass files from the
import sequence in the scss/includes/_bootstrap.scss file, and then
compress the resulting main.css file.
Finally, we need to slim down our plugins.js file by replacing Bootstrap's all-
inclusive bootstrap.min.js file with compressed versions of only the three
plugins that we're actually using: carousel.js, collapse.js, and
transitions.js. We then compress the final plugins.js file.

Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio

Combined, these steps can cut the footprint of this website by roughly half. In an age where
speed matters—both for user retention and for SEO ranking—that's a big deal. Also, read
Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp, to learn how to get your code ready
for production.
In addition, there is one other very sensible step you may want to take: We know that users
of touch-enabled devices appreciate the ability to swipe their way forward and back
through a carousel.
But, for the present moment, let's stop and celebrate.
Summary
Let's take stock of what we've accomplished in this chapter. We started a new Bootstrap
project, powered by Panini, Sass, and Gulp, by using Bootstrap CLI. After that, we
leveraged Bootstrap's responsive navbar, carousel, and grid system, and customized several
of Bootstrap's Sass codes and mixins. You also learned how to create your own Sass files
and folded them seamlessly into the project. Last but not least, you folded the Font
Awesome icons into our workflow. At the end, you improved future maintenance of the site
by implementing a thoughtful file organization scheme—all without creating code bloat.
With this experience under your belt, you're equipped to bend Bootstrap to your will, using
its power to speed website development, and then customizing the design to your heart's
content. In future chapters, we'll expand your experience further. First, however, let's take
this design to create a complex business home page.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
We've built our portfolio site. Now, it's time to flesh out our portfolio with some projects
that demonstrate the range of our powers. Let's now turn to designing a complex business
home page.
Take a moment to survey the home pages of successful businesses, such as these:
Zappos ( h t t p : / /www.zappos.com)
Amazon ( h t t p : / /www.amazon.com)
Adobe ( h t t p : / / w w w . a d o b e . c o m /)
HP ( h t t p : / / w w w . h p . c o m)
While each has its own approach, what these sites have in common is that they manage
considerable complexity.
We can get a grasp of some common features by breaking the website down into three
categories, as follows, based on regions of the page:
Banner/masthead: This part contains the logo, main navigation with drop-down
menus, a secondary or utility navigation, and a login or register option
Main content area: This features a complex layout with at least three columns, if
not more
Footer: This is filled with multiple columns of links and information
Let's demonstrate our ability to manage this degree of complexity. To do so, we will take
full advantage of Bootstrap's responsive 12-column grid system.

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 204 ]
Here is the design we'll create, when viewed in medium and wide viewports:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 205 ]
In narrow viewports, it will adapt considerably, as shown in the following screenshot:
After that, we will perform the following steps:
Begin with a set of starter files based on the Portfolio project from Chapter 5,
1.
Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio.
Create a complex banner with the logo above the navbar and a utility navigation
2.
in the top-right corner, in desktop viewports.
For smaller viewports, we'll enable our utility options to appear only as icons
3.
atop the collapsed responsive navbar.
Implement a business-style color scheme.
4.
Make adjustments to both the responsive and desktop versions of the navbar.
5.
Set up complex multicolumn grids for the main content and footer areas.
6.
First things first: let's size up our project starter files.

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 206 ]
Sizing up our beginning files
As with all the projects in this book, the beginning files for this project can be downloaded
from the Packt Publishing website at h t t p : / / w w w . p a c k t p u b . c o m / s u p p o r t. You'll find the
files for this project in the chapter6/start folder.
These files are a copy of our results from Chapter 5, Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio. Thus, we
have the benefit of the following key components:
A complete build process, including the Sass compiler and the Panini template
engine
Bootstrap SCSS and JavaScript files
The Panini HTML templates
In addition to these key assets, we have some of the custom Sass touches we created during
the project in Chapter 5, Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio. They can be found in the following
files, which are present in the scss and scss/includes directories:
_main.scss: This is customized to import Bootstrap's Sass files from the
bower_components/bootstrap/scss directory, as well as Font Awesome font
icons and our custom Sass files
_carousel.scss: This file has custom touches on the carousel padding,
background, and indicators
_footer.scss: This file contains styles for the layout and design of the logo and
social icons
_navbar.scss: This has adjusted padding in the .navbar-brand class to enable
the navbar logo to fit
_page-contents.scss: This contains styles to ensure that columns with floated
buttons clear one another in narrow single-column layouts
_variables.scss: This has custom versions of gray and some adjustments to
variables for the navbar and carousel
Font Awesome font icons include the following:
Icon fonts in the fonts directory
Sass files in the bower_components/font-awesome directory
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business

In order to start using these files, you should run the following commands in
your console:
         bower installing
         npm install
After that, you can run the npm start or bootstrap watch command to compile your
project and start watching your changes in the browser.
Setting up the basics of your design
We start modifying the result of Chapter 5, Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio, and should end up
with the basics, similar to that shown in the following screenshot:
Note the following features:
A complex navbar that has seven main nav items, each with a drop-down menu
The first of the three columns is equipped with a carousel, followed by a heading,
paragraph, and button

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 208 ]
The second and third columns, which have headings, paragraphs, and Read
more -> buttons
A footer that has the logo and social icons
You'll recognize elements we've already worked with in Chapter 5, Bootstrappin' Your
Portfolio. The carousel is now smaller—constrained by its containing column. Otherwise, the
markup is the same.
Adding drop-down menus to our navbar
Bootstrap's JavaScript Dropdown Plugin enables you to create drop-down menus with ease.
You can also add these drop-down menus to your navbar.
Open the html/includes/header.html file in your text editor. Notice that the Gulp build
process uses the Panini HTML compiler to compile our HTML templates into HTML pages.
Panini is powered by the Handlebars template language. In your templates, you can use
helpers, iterations, and custom data. In this example, you'll use the power of Panini to build
the navbar items with drop-down menus.
First, create an html/data/productgroups.yml file that contains the titles of the navbar
items:
- Shoes
- Clothing
- Accessories
- Women
- Men
- Kids
- All Departments
The preceding code is written in the YAML format. YAML is a human-readable data 
serialization language that takes concepts from programming languages and ideas from
XML; you can read more about it at the following URL: http://yaml.org/.
Using the preceding data, you can use the following HTML and template code to build the
navbar items:
  <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-toggleable-sm collapse"
  id="collapsiblecontent">
  {{#each productgroups}}
    <li class="nav-item dropdown {{#ifCond this
'Shoes'}}active{{/ifCond}}">
      <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="#"
      role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 209 ]
      {{ this }}
      </a>
        <div class="dropdown-menu">
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a>
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a>
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a>
          <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Separated link</a>
        </div>
    </li>
  {{/each}}
  </ul>
The preceding code uses a (for) each loop to build the seven navbar items, and each item
gets the same drop-down menu. The Shoes menu gets the active class. Handlebars, and
therefore Panini, does not support conditional comparisons by default. The if statement
can only handle a single value, but you can add a custom helper to enable conditional
comparisons. The custom helper, which enables us to use the ifCond statement, can be
found in the html/helpers/ifCond.js file. Read my How to set up Panini for different
environments blog post, at h t t p : / / b a s s j o b s e n . w e b l o g s . f m / s e t - p a n i n i - d i f f e r e n t - e n v i r

The HTML code for the drop-down menu is in accordance with the code for drop-down
menus described for the Dropdown plugin at
http://getbootstrap.com/components/dropdowns/.
The navbar collapses for smaller screen sizes. By default, the drop-down menus look the
same on all grids:

Setting the bottom border for the page header
Create a new Sass partial file and add the following SCSS code to it to give our page header
a clear boundary:
header[role="banner"] {
  border-bottom: 4px solid $gray-lighter;
}
Adding images with holder.js
One other wrinkle is that I've used the excellent holder.js JavaScript plugin to
dynamically generate placeholder images for our carousel.
You can install the holder.js plugin with Bower by running the following command in your
console:
bower install holderjs --save-dev
After installing the plugin, you can use the compile-js Gulp task in Gulpfile.js to link
it together with your other JavaScript code into the app.js file as follows:
gulp.task('compile-js', function() {
  return gulp.src([
        bowerpath+ 'jquery/dist/jquery.min.js',
        bowerpath+ 'tether/dist/js/tether.min.js',
        bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js',
        bowerpath+ 'holderjs/holder.min.js', // Holder.js for project
        development only
        'js/main.js'])
    .pipe(concat('app.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./_site/js/'));
});
If you examine the markup, you'll see near the bottom of the page that I've included the
holder.js script right before plugins.js, as follows:
<!-- Holder.js for project development only -->
<script src="js/vendor/holder.js"></script>
We won't be using placeholder images in our final production site, so it makes sense to link
it separately with a prominent comment.

With holder.js in place, we can conveniently build image tags that reference holder.js
as their source. The remainder of the pseudo-URL specifies dimensions, color, and filler
text, as follows:
<img src="holder.js/600x480/auto/vine/textmode:literal"    alt="Holder
Image">
For more information about holder.js, consult the documentation at h t t

With these elements in place—and thanks in particular to Bootstrap's ready repertoire of
styles and behaviors—we're starting out in good shape. Let's get to the details.
First, we'll reposition our navbar within a more complex banner design.
Creating a complex banner area
Let's start from the top and create our complex banner area with the following features:
A site logo positioned above the navbar for desktops and larger viewports
A navbar with many menu items, including drop-down menus
A utility navigation area
A login form with username and password
An option to register
Here is the mockup of our desired end goal on a desktop-width viewport:
On a narrow viewport, it will adjust to this:

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 212 ]
We'll start by working on a new arrangement for our top logo.
Placing a logo above the navbar
In this new design, we need a logo in two spots, for two contexts:
For desktop and widescreen viewports, we want the logo to display above the
navbar
For tablet and phone viewports, we want the logo to display within the
responsive navbar
Thanks to Bootstrap's responsive utility classes, we can do both! Here's how:
Open the html/includes/header.html file in your editor.
1.
Move the logo and toggle button outside the nav element and wrap them with
2.
<div class="container">...</div> to constrain it within Bootstrap's
centered grid space.
Remove the width attribute from the img element of the logo.
3.
Then wrap the <ul class="nav navbar-nav"></ul> with <div
4.
class="container">...</div> too.
Move navbar-toggleable-sm and collapse the classes to the second container's
5.
div.
At the end, your HTML code in the html/includes/header.html file should
6.
look as follows:
        <header role="banner">
        <div class="container">
        <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-md-up" type="button"
        data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsiblecontent">
        ☰
        </button>
        <a class="navbar-brand" href="/"><img
src="{{root}}/images/logo.png"
        alt="Bootstrappin'"></a>
        </div>
        <nav class="navbar navbar-full" role="navigation">
        <div class=  "container navbar-toggleable-sm collapse"
        id="collapsiblecontent">
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
        ...
        </ul>
        </div>
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 213 ]
        </nav>
        </header>
After your HTML changes, you can use the power of Sass again to style the logo
7.
depending on the width of the viewport. Edit the following SCSS code in the
scss/includes/_header.scss file:
        header[role="banner"] {
          .navbar-brand {
          > img {
              width: 120px;
              padding-left: $spacer-x;
              @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
                padding-left: 0;
                width: 180px;
              }
            }
          }
        }
In the preceding steps, a couple of predefined Bootstrap classes are used. The hidden-md-
up helper class hides content for the medium viewport and up and so ensures that the
toggle button is only visible on the small viewports. On the other hand, the navbar-
toggleable-sm class only affects small and extra-small viewports.
On narrow viewports, the logo gets a width of 120 pixels. For medium grids and larger, the
left padding of the logo is removed and the width is set to 180 pixels.
Recall that our original logo image is large, about 900 pixels wide. We've
resized it to 120 pixels wide via the width attribute (we could alternatively
use CSS rules) in order to pack its pixels tighter for retina screens.
Save the changes and refresh the page, and you should see these results! In medium and
large viewports, the larger logo will appear:

[ 214 ]
In small and extra-small viewports, a small version of the logo will appear:
Ah, the beauty of Bootstrap!
Now, let's make some adjustments to our navbar.
Reviewing and checking navbar drop-down items
The navbar, with its seven items and submenus, reflects the needs of a large complex
website.
The markup for the drop-down menus is taken directly from the Bootstrap drop-down
documentation at h t t p : / / g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / c o m p o n e n t s / d r o p d o w n s /.
If you look at our resulting markup, you'll notice these special classes and attributes:
class="dropdown" on the parent li
class="dropdown-toggle" on the link
attribute="data-toggle" also on the link
class="dropdown-menu" on the submenu div element
class="dropdown-item" on each drop-down menu item
Here is the resulting markup:
<li class="nav-item dropdown">
  <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="#"
  role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
    Shoes
  </a>
  <div class="dropdown-menu">
    <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a>
    <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a>
    <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a>
    <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
    <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Separated link</a>
  </div>
</li>
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 215 ]
Also note that the small drop-down indicator is a CSS triangle, as already described in
Chapter 3, Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass. Bootstrap uses the following SCSS
code in the bower_components/bootstrap/scss/_ to create these triangles:
.dropdown-toggle {
  // Generate the caret automatically
  &::after {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    margin-right: .25rem;
    margin-left: .25rem;
    vertical-align: middle;
    content: "";
    border-top: $caret-width solid;
    border-right: $caret-width solid transparent;
    border-left: $caret-width solid transparent;
  }
  // Prevent the focus on the dropdown toggle when closing dropdowns
  &:focus {
    outline: 0;
  }
}
When working with plugins and components, make sure that the required
SCSS and JavaScript code is included in your project. Sass partials are
imported into main.scss file. The import
scss/includes/_bootstrap.scss in its turn imports the SCSS code for
Bootstrap's components. The JavaScript plugins are included in the file in
the Gulp task.

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 216 ]
With the Sass, JavaScript, and HTML markup in place, our navbar and its dropdowns
should presently look and work as shown in the following screenshot (note that Bootstrap
dropdowns responds on click):
Now that we're familiar with the HTML markup structure and have ensured everything's
working as it should, let's move the All Departments menu to the right-hand end of the
navbar, setting it apart from the others.
To do this, we need to nest this list item within its own unordered list, as follows:
Before the All Departments list item, close the ul tag for ul class="nav",
1.
which surrounds all previous menu items.
Start a new ul tag with the nav and navbar-nav classes before the All
2.
Departments menu item. Once this opening tag is added, it will nest this list item
in the standard structure for navigation menus.
In addition to the nav and navbar-nav classes, add a third class, pull-right,
3.
which is a convenient Bootstrap utility class, to float an element to the right.
The newly added lines are highlighted in the following snippet—after which I'll include the
original list item and link in context:
  <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
  {{#each productgroups}}
    {{#ifCond this 'All Departments'}}</ul><ul class="nav navbar-nav
    pull-md-right">{{/ifCond}}
    <li class="nav-item dropdown {{#ifCond this
'Shoes'}}active{{/ifCond}}">
      <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" href="#"
      role="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
      {{ this }}
      </a>
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 217 ]
        <div class="dropdown-menu">
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a>
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a>
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a>
          <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Separated link</a>
        </div>
    </li>
  {{/each}}
  </ul>
Notice that we've used the IfCond helper again to make sure that the </ul><ul
class="nav navbar-nav pull-md-right"> snippet is only inserted before the
beginning of the All Departments category.
Save the changes and inspect the results in your browser. If you have not run the
bootstrap watch or gulp command already, you should run it now. You should see the
All Departments drop-down menu item float to the right-hand end of the navbar, as
follows:
Instead of modifying your HTML code, you can also use the following SCSS code to
accomplish the same thing:
.nav-item:last-child {
  float:right;
}
So far so good! Now, let's add our utility navigation.

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 218 ]
Adding utility navigation
This project requires utility navigation to allow users to log in or register and to view their
carts.
On medium, large, and extra-large viewports, we'll place this utility navigation in the very
top-right corner of our banner area, as follows:
On smaller screens, we'll display icons at the far right of the collapsed navbar:
Notice that the collapsed navbar has a different color scheme; we'll discuss how to do this
later on.
Now let's set the navbar changes up.
First, to give the logo a little more space in the the scss/includes/_header.scss file, set
top-padding for only the larger viewports, as follows:
header[role="banner"] {
  .navbar-brand {
    > img {
      width: 120px;
      padding-left: $spacer-x;
      @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
        padding-top: $spacer-y * 3;
        padding-left: 0;
        width: 180px;
      }
    }
  }
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 219 ]
Then, still working in the html/includes/header.html file, we need to add the
markup for our utility navigation within the banner, just after the navbar-brand attribute.
Here is the full markup, beginning with the opening header tag for our banner area. I've
highlighted the new utility-nav markup in the following code snippet:
<header role="banner">
  <div class="container">
   <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-md-up" type="button"
   data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsiblecontent">
    ☰
   </button>
   <a class="navbar-brand" href="/"><img src="{{root}}/images/logo.png"
   alt="Bootstrappin'"></a>
   <div class="utility-nav">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#" ><i class="icon fa
        fa-user fa-lg"></i> Log In or Register</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" ><i class="icon fa fa-shopping-cart
        fa-lg"></i> View Cart</a></li>
      </ul>
   </div>
  </div>
...
</header>
Note a few things about this markup:
The utility-nav class is simply created for our use. It is not a Bootstrap-specific
class and has no specific styles attached.
I've included Font Awesome's user and shopping cart icons and added the class
of fa-lg to increase their size by 33 percent. See Font Awesome's documentation
on this at h t t p : / / f o n t a w e s o m e . i o / e x a m p l e s / # l a r g e r.
Save the changes and inspect the results in your browser, and you should see our new
utility-nav class appear on the right-hand side of the logo, as follows:

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 220 ]
Now, to complete the layout and related adjustments, we need to apply some custom styles.
We need a new file to manage styles for our banner area.
We need to set the position of .utility-nav to absolute, at the top right. We'll specify
header[role="banner"] as the context for these styles. Add the following SCSS code to
the scss/includes/_header.scss file:
header[role="banner"] {
 // Banner Area Styles
 .utility-nav {
   position: absolute;
   top: $spacer-y;
   right: 0;
  }
}
Now, let's refine the details as follows:
Remove bullets from the unordered list.
1.
Float the list items on the left.
2.
Add padding to the link.
3.
Remove underlines from the hover effect.
4.
The following lines will accomplish these goals:
.utility-nav {
  ul {
    list-style: none;
    li {
      float: left;
      a {
        padding: 0 $spacer-x;
        @include hover {
          text-decoration: none;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Save the changes and ensure that it compiles. In the preceding code, we've set the padding
for the anchors to padding: 0 $spacer-x;. We could accomplish this by adding
Bootstrap's utility classes for spacing into the HTML code.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 221 ]
The following HTML code also sets a padding of $spacer-x on the left- and right-hand
sides of the <a> element:
<a href="#"  class="p-1-x">
Then make sure your browser window is at desktop width. You should see your utility-
nav class take its place at the top right of the banner:
That takes care of medium viewports and larger. Now, let's address the needs of the
collapsed responsive navbar.
Making responsive adjustments
On small screens, the elements of our page header may overlap:
We need to move the toggle to the left-hand side of our navbar. This can be done as follows:
Open the scss/includes/_header.scss file in your editor and add the
1.
following SCSS code to it:
          header[role="banner"] {
            .navbar-toggler {
            float: left;
            }
          }
Save and compile these changes, and you'll see the navbar toggle shift to the left
2.
end of the collapsed navbar, as shown in the following screenshot:
So far so good.

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 222 ]
Now to address the problem of crowding by hiding the text for all devices except for screen
readers on the collapsed navbar. In an uncluttered collapsed navbar, the icons will be
enough to communicate the point, especially if we make the icons larger. Let's do that:
In the html/includes/_header.html file, place span tags around the text
1.
within each link of our utility-nav class, as follows:
         <li><a href="#" ><i class="icon fa
         fa-user fa-lg"></i> <span>Log In or    Register</span></a></li>
         <li><a href="#" ><i class="icon fa
         fa-shopping-cart fa-lg"></i> <span>   View Cart</span></a></li>
This will give us a handle for our upcoming style adjustment.
2.
Now, in _headers.scss, we'll add a media query to target these span tags.
3.
Thanks to the power of Sass, we can nest the media query precisely where we
want it to do its work. We'll use Bootstrap's @media-breakpoint-down(sm)
mixin, setting a max-width query to the small breakpoint value minus one, since
at this point our navbar makes the transition from collapsed to expanded. Within
this media query, we'll use the sr-only utility class as a mixin to hide text from
all devices except screen readers. (See the documentation on this class at h t t p : / /
g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / c o m p o n e n t s / u t i l i t i e s / # s c r e e n - r e a d e r s - a n d - k e y b o a r d - u
s e r s.)
Instead of the sr-only mixin, you can also add the sr-only class to your HTML.
4.
The sr-only-focusable mixin and sr-only-focusable CSS class are
available to make content hidden by the the sr-only class visible on focus,
which is useful for keyboard-only users.
Here is the code snippet:
5.
         header[role="banner"] {
           @include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {
             top: 0;
             span {
               @include sr-only;
             }
           }
         }
This will hide the text between our span tags, leaving us only with the icons!
6.
Now, we will increase the size of the icons and add some line height to position
7.
them vertically. We'll do this within the same media query:
        header[role="banner"] {
          @include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 223 ]
            top: 0;
            span {
              @include sr-only;
            }
            .icon {
              font-size: 2em;
              line-height: 1.2;
            }
          }
        }
Save your changes, run the bootstrap watch command if you haven't already done so,
and you should see the following result:
Take a minute to resize your browser window back and forth across the breakpoint. You
should see the entire banner and navbar adjust seamlessly across the breakpoint.
If you're like me, it's hard not to be pleased with a framework that enables us to be this
efficient at building such an adept and responsive interface.
Next up, we need to begin implementing the color scheme.
Implementing the color scheme
We've been provided with a business-friendly palette of blue, red, and gray. Let's work 
these colors into our color variables:
Open scss/includes_variables.scss in your editor. We'll be working at the
1.
beginning of the file, in the color variables.
Let's review the range of grays we have available. If you've begun with the
2.
chapter5/finish files, you'll see we've carried these variables over from
Chapter 5, Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio. They served us well there, and we'll make
use of them again here:
         x`
         // -------------------------
         @gray-darker:            #222; // edited
         @gray-dark:              #454545; // edited
         @gray:                   #777; // edited

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 224 ]
         @gray-light:             #aeaeae; // edited
         @gray-lighter:           #ccc; // edited
         @gray-lightest:          #ededed; // edited
         @off-white:              #fafafa; // edited
Now, below the grays, let's fold in our new brand colors. We'll modify the value
3.
for @brand-primary and create a @brand-feature variable for red:
         @brand-primary:          #3e7dbd; // edited blue
         @brand-feature:          #c60004; // added new red
Now, let's adjust our link-hover color so that it will lighten (rather than darken)
4.
the @brand-primary color, which is already dark:
         // Links
         // -------------------------
         @link-color:            @brand-primary;
         @link-color-hover:      lighten(@link-color, 15%);
Finally, let's define the colors for our navbar. We'll create two sets of variables the
5.
-xs- variables for the small screens and the -md- variables for the larger screens:
        // Navbar
        $navbar-xs-color:             $body-color;
        $navbar-xs-bg:                #fff;
        $navbar-md-color:             $gray-lightest;
        $navbar-md-bg:                $brand-primary;
        // Navbar links
        $navbar-xs-color:                $navbar-xs-color;
        $navbar-xs-hover-color:          $navbar-xs-color;
        $navbar-xs-hover-bg:             darken($navbar-xs-bg, 5%);
        $navbar-xs-active-color:         $navbar-xs-color;
        $navbar-xs-disabled-color:       $navbar-xs-hover-bg;
        $navbar-md-color:                $navbar-md-color;
        $navbar-md-hover-color:          $navbar-md-color;
        $navbar-md-hover-bg:             darken($navbar-md-bg, 5%);
        $navbar-md-active-color:         $navbar-md-color;
        $navbar-md-disabled-color:       $navbar-md-hover-bg;
Having set up these fundamental color variables, we're ready to work on our navbar.

Styling the collapsed navbar
While still in _navbar.less, search for // Navbar, which will take you to the navbar
variables. Note that most of the standard values specified here will affect both the collapsed
responsive navbar for small viewports and the expanded navbar for wider viewports.
We want the background, text, and link colors for the collapsed responsive navbar to
remain largely consistent with the default values but then change to our blue background
and a light text color for medium and larger viewports.
We'll develop a responsive color scheme to accomplish the preceding color changes based
on the viewport.
Open the scss/includes/_navbar.scss file and edit the default values for the small
viewport as follows:
// responsive color scheme
.navbar {
  background-color: $navbar-xs-bg;
  color: $navbar-xs-color;
  .nav-link
  {
    @include hover-focus-active {
      background-color: $navbar-xs-hover-bg;
    }
  }
}
As you can see, we'll use the -xs- variables now. For medium and large viewports—where
our navbar stretches out horizontally below the logo—we want our navbar to take on the
blue color. Using Bootstrap's media query mixins again, we can change the colors for the
larger viewports, as follows:
// responsive color scheme
.navbar {
  background-color: $navbar-xs-bg;
  color: $navbar-xs-color;
  .nav-link
  {
    @include hover-focus-active {
      background-color: $navbar-xs-hover-bg;
    }
  }
  @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    background-color: $navbar-md-bg;
    color: $navbar-md-color;

    .nav-link
    {
      color: $navbar-md-color;
      @include hover-focus-active {
        background-color: $navbar-md-hover-bg;
      }
    }
  }
}
Customizing the drop-down menus
We will use the power of Sass again to customize the drop-down menus for smaller screens.
Edit the following code in the scss/includes/_navbar.scss file:
@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {
  .navbar {
    .nav-item + .nav-item {
      margin-left: 0;
    }
    .dropdown {
      position: initial;
    }
    .dropdown-menu {
      position: initial;
      z-index: initial;
      float: initial;
      border: initial;
      border-radius: initial;
    }
  }
}
In the preceding code, we've used Bootstrap's media query mixins to reset the styles for
screens smaller than 768 pixels. The initial value the initial value of a property to an
element. So the preceding code sets the position to again and removes the float, border, and
border-radius, and the drop-down menu will look like a “normal” list now:

Fantastic! Now we can address the horizontal navbar.
Styling the horizontal navbar
When you move your mouse over the navbar links, you'll find that the hover background
color of the link is smaller than the height of the navbar:
You can solve this issue by applying padding on the links instead of the navbar. Use the
following SCSS code in the file to change the padding:
.navbar {
  @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    padding-top: 0;
    padding-bottom: 0;
  }
  .nav-link
  {
    padding: $spacer;
    @include media-breakpoint-only(md) {
      padding: $spacer-y ($spacer-x / 2);
    }
  }
}

Now your navbar links should look like the following screenshot:
And finally, let's transform the text to upper case, reduce its size a bit, and make it bold. In
_navbar.scss, add these highlighted lines:
  .nav-link
  {
    padding: $spacer;
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
     text-transform: uppercase;
     font-size: 82%;
     font-weight: bold;
    }
  }
This will yield the following result:
Our banner and navbar are complete!
Enabling Flexbox support
As already explained in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap, Bootstrap 4 comes with
optional flexbox support. You can simply enable flexbox support by declaring $enable-
flex: true; in the scss/includes/_variables file. If you do so, you'll have clear the
floats of the container of the navbar because of we've implement flexbox support for it. You
can clear the floats by adding the following SCSS code to the file:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 229 ]
header[role="banner"] {
  // header container do not use the flexbox layout, so floats have to be
cleared
  @if $enable-flex {
    .container {
      @include clearfix();
    }
  }
}
Now it's time to move on to the main content of our page.
Designing a complex responsive layout
Let's imagine we've emerged from client meetings with a plan to organize the home page
content in three tiers, ranked by importance.
In medium and wide viewports, this content will be laid out in three columns, as shown in
the following screenshot:

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 230 ]
In a narrow viewport, these will be laid out one after another, in a single vertical column:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 231 ]
And in a small and medium tablet-width viewport, we'll arrange the content in two side-
by-side columns, with the third tier of content laid out beneath it as a horizontal row, as
shown in the following screenshot:
To get us started, I've provided the basic markup for three equal columns. Let's review what
we have and then adapt it to the needs of this design. We'll begin with the three-column
layout for medium and wide viewports.

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 232 ]
Adjusting the large and extra-large layout
Currently, in large and extra-large viewports, our three columns are equal in width, font
size, button size, and color. As a result, the presentation lacks visual hierarchy, as seen in
the following screenshot:
We can take significant strides by adjusting column width, font size, button size, and color
to establish a clearer hierarchy between these tiers of content. Let's do that. We'll start by
adjusting column widths:
In html/pages/index.html, search for the section tag for the primary
1.
content:
      <section class="content-primary col-md-4">
Note that the col-md-4 class sets the width of this column to one-third of the
2.
width of the parent element, beginning at the small viewport width (768 pixels
and up).
We want to save the three-column layout for the large and extra-large viewports
3.
(992 pixels and up), and we want this first column to be wider than the others.
Edit the col-md-4 class to read col-lg-5, as follows:
4.
        <section class="content-primary col-lg-5">
This will set this column to 5/12 width with the medium viewport and larger.
5.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 233 ]
Now search and find the opening section tags for the next two columns and
6.
adjust the column classes to col-lg-4 and col-lg-3 respectively:
        <section class="content-secondary col-lg-4">
        ...
        <section class="content-tertiary col-lg-3">
Save, refresh, and you'll see the desired visual hierarchy in the width of our columns:
You might have noticed that the headings in the middle of the secondary and tertiary
columns are not clearing the buttons above them. Let's adjust these, as well as our buttons
and font sizes after adjusting the medium layout.
Adjusting the medium layout for tablet-width
viewports
First notice that the navbar is too small for the number of items on the medium layout. The
items render into two rows, as follows:

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 234 ]
To get the items on a single row again, you may reduce the margin and padding of the
navbar items or change the collapsing point of the navbar.
First, try the margin and padding solution; you can use the power of Sass again. Open the
file in your editor and add the following SCSS code:
.navbar {
  @include media-breakpoint-only(md) {
    .nav-item + .nav-item {
      margin-left: 0;
    }
  }
  .nav-link
  {
    padding: $spacer;
    @include media-breakpoint-only(md) {
      padding: $spacer-y ($spacer-x / 2);
    }
  }
}
Notice that I've wrapped the code in the media-breakpoint-only() mixin. The media-
breakpoint-only() mixin works just like the media-breakpoint-up and media-
breakpoint-down mixins you've seen before, but only targets a single grid by setting both
the min-width and max-width for the media query.
Consider the following SCSS code, for example:
@include media-breakpoint-only(md) {
  padding: $spacer-y ($spacer-x / 2);
}
The preceding SCSS code compiles into CSS code similar to the following:
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {
  .navbar .nav-link {
  padding: 1rem 0.5rem;
  }
}
A media-breakpoint-between() mixin is available too. The media-breakpoint-
between() mixin enables you to target a range of grids between two breakpoints. The
@include media-breakpoint-only(sm,md){} call targets both small and medium
grids.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 235 ]
You may have noticed that your file contains a lot of media queries now.
Sass does not merge media queries, so the compiled CSS code contains a
lot of media queries too. Merging the same CSS media query rules into one
media query rule may be a performance improvement for your CSS code.
The css-mqpacker node package can process your CSS code pack's same
CSS media query rules into one media query rule.
You can run the package with the gulp-postcss package just like the
autoprefixer plugin. More information about css-mqpacker and how to
integrate it in your Gulp build process can be found at the following URL:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-mqpacker
A media-breakpoint-between() mixin is available too. The media-
breakpoint-between() mixin enables you to target a range of grids
between two breakpoints. The @include media-breakpoint-
only(sm,md){} call targets both the small and medium grids.
Alternatively, you may change the collapsing point of the navbar. First, open the
html/includes/header.html file and change the appearance of the navbar toggler as follows:
<button class="navbar-toggler hidden-lg-up" type="button"
data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapsiblecontent">
The hidden-lg-up class in the preceding code now shows the toggle button on the
medium screen too. Then, change the breakpoint for the toggleable navbar from navbar-
toggleable-sm to navbar-toggleable-md, as shown in the following HTML snippet:
<div class="container navbar-toggleable-md collapse"
id="collapsiblecontent">
Now you'll find a collapsed navbar on the medium grid too. Notice that we've made some
changes to the navbar items and the submenus for the collapsed navbar before. You should
change the media queries for these changes too. You can change the media queries in the
scss/includes/_navbar.sccs file:
    .navbar {
      @include media-breakpoint-down(md) {
        .navbar-brand,
        .nav-item {
          float: none;
          > img {
            display: inline-block;
          }
        }

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 236 ]
        // dropdown menus
        .nav-item + .nav-item {
          margin-left: 0;
        }
        .dropdown {
          position: initial;
        }
        .dropdown-menu {
          position: initial;
          z-index: initial;
          float: initial;
          border: initial;
          border-radius: initial;
        }
      }
    }
Also change the breakpoint for the navbar class in the scss/includes/_header.scss file:
  .navbar-brand {
    > img {
      width: 120px;
      padding-left: $spacer-x;
      @include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {
        padding-top: $spacer-y * 3;
        padding-left: 0;
        width: 180px;
      }
    }
  }
And finally, in the file, replace the pull-md-right class with the pull-lg-right class for
the last navbar item in the html/includes/header.html file, as shown in the following
HTML template snippet:
{{#ifCond this 'All Departments'}}</ul><ul class="nav navbar-nav pull-lg-
right">{{/ifCond}}
The navbar is ready now for the medium grid. Let's prepare our content columns too. On
the medium grid, we'll move the third column below the other columns and display each
item in a column. See screenshot under section Adjusting the medium layout for tablet-width
viewports.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 237 ]
The first row contains two columns whose combined width is 50% of the container, and the
second row contains three columns stretching one-third of the width of the container.
We can accomplish the layout described previously by using Bootstrap's predefined grid
classes again. First, open the html/pages/index.html file again and add the grid classes
for the medium grid, as follows:
<section class="content-primary col-md-6 col-lg-5">
  ...
</section>
<section class="content-secondary col-md-6 col-lg-4">
  ...
</section>
<section class="content-tertiary col-md-12 col-lg-3">
  ...
</section>
The col-md-* classes in the preceding code only affect the medium, because the col-lg-*
classes overwrites them for the larger grids, according to mobile first coding.
A grid row contains 12 columns; on the medium grid you'll have 24 (2 x md-6 + md-12)
columns now. The columns will automatically split up into two rows. The first row contains
the first two (md-6) columns, and the second row is filled with the md-12 column.
Now you will have to lay out the items of the content-tertiary column on the medium grid.
Bootstrap's grid rows can also be nested. We'll use nesting to split up the second row into
three equal-width columns. To nest your content with the default grid, add a new row class
and set of col-*-* columns within an existing col-*-* column. In your layout, wrap each
column into the following HTML structure:
<article class="col-md-4 col-lg-12">
...
</article>
You'll not only have to add a col-md-4 class, but also a col-lg-12 class to ensure the
nesting does not influence the columns on the large and extra-large grids. Wrap the
columns in a new row and the HTML code of the tertiary column should now look like the
following:
    <section class="content-tertiary col-md-12 col-lg-3">
    <div class="row">
    <article class="col-md-4 col-lg-12">
    <h4>Don't Miss!</h4>

    </article>
    </div>
    </section>
In the browser, the last column should look like that shown in the following screenshot:
Adjusting headings, font sizes, and buttons
Let's begin by adjusting our headings so that they consistently clear the buttons above them,
which have been floated to the right. For this purpose, we'll use the file we previously
created to manage the details of the page contents, _page-contents.scss.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 239 ]
Here's how to do it:
In _page-contents.scss, let's write a selector to select headings h1 through h4
1.
when they're nested inside a Bootstrap column class. We'll use the CSS2 attribute
selector and cover our bases by targeting any element whose classes include the
col- string.
Later in this chapter, we will equip our footer with its own set of
responsive columns. Thus, we need to make sure we nest these rules
within the selector for the main element.
Within this context, we'll select all heading tags we might potentially use and set
2.
them to clear floated elements, with some added padding for separation:
        [class*="col-"] {
          h1, h2, h3, h4 {
            clear: both;
            padding-top: $spacer-y;
          }
        }
This gives the necessary separation between our headings and floated buttons.
3.
But it also creates unneeded padding at the top of the secondary and tertiary
columns.
In the following screenshot, the lower arrows highlight the improvement
4.
accomplished now that our headings clear the floated buttons. Also, the ragged
top edge of our columns, where padding causes a problem:

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 240 ]
Let's remove the margin and padding from the uppermost heading in each
5.
column. We'll use the :first-child selector for these headings, nesting these
lines within our heading selectors. We'll use the & combinator, which in this
formulation allows us to select any first-child instance of these headings:
        &:first-child {
          margin-top: 0;
          padding-top: 0;
        }
This removes the extra margin and padding and evens up the top edge of the
6.
second:
But now there is a problem with the third column. The :first-child selector
7.
matches each h4 element in the third column due to the nesting we added before.
You can solve this issue by creating a new h4 selector in your Sass code, as
follows:
        h4 {
          clear: both;
          padding-top: $spacer-y;
        }
        > article:first-child h4 {
          margin-top: 0;
          padding-top: 0;
        }
However, we only want to remove this top margin and padding in medium,
8.
large, or extra-large viewports, which accommodate multiple columns. Thus, we
need to nest this rule within a media query corresponding with the breakpoint at
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 241 ]
which our layout expands from a narrow single-column layout to a wider multi-
column layout.
Thus, we need to nest what we've just done within a media query for medium
9.
viewports and larger:
        [class*="col-"] {
          h1, h2, h3, h4 {
            clear: both;
            padding-top: $spacer-y;
            @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
              &:first-child {
                margin-top: 0;
                padding-top: 0;
              }
            }
          }
          h4 {
            clear: both;
            padding-top: $spacer-y;
          }
          @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
            > article:first-child h4 {
              margin-top: 0;
              padding-top: 0;
            }
          }
        }
With the preceding media query, we've retained the padding we need between elements in
the single-column layout for narrow viewports, as seen in the following screenshot:

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 242 ]
With this accomplished, we can move on to adjust buttons and font sizes to reflect the
informational hierarchy of our content. Let's begin by enlarging the font size, button size,
and color in our primary content area.
Enhancing the primary column
First, let's increase the font size of our primary column content:
In Bootstrap's _variables.scss file, the $font-size-large variable is set to
1.
the following by default:
        $font-size-lg: 1.25rem !default;
Now, in the scss/includes/_page-contents.scss file, add these lines to use
2.
this font size for our primary content:
        .content-primary {
          font-size: $font-size-lg;
        }
Save these changes, compile the file, and refresh your browser. You should see the font size
increase accordingly!
Now, let's adjust the color of our button to utilize the red $brand-feature color. We'll
utilize the $brand-feature variable we set up in the local
scss/includes/_variables.scss file.
        $brand-feature:        #c60004;
We'll also utilize an excellent button-variant() mixin provided in the Bootstrap
mixins/_buttons.scss file. You may want to take a moment to check it out. Open the
mixins/_buttons.scss in the Bootstrap's source code in the bower_components
directory and search for // Button variants. You'll find a mixin that begins as follows:
@mixin button-variant($color, $background, $border) {
The mixin does the following:
Specifies the button font, background, and border colors (in other words, the
three parameters that the mixin accepts)
Generates hover, focus, active, and disabled states for the button, adjusting font
color, background color, and border
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 243 ]
If you'd like to, you can see how Bootstrap uses this mixin in bootstrap/_buttons.scss
under the // Alternate buttons comment. Here are the lines generating styles for the
default and primary buttons:
//
// Alternate buttons
//
.btn-primary {
  @include button-variant($btn-primary-color, $btn-primary-bg, $btn-
primary-border);
}
.btn-secondary {
  @include button-variant($btn-secondary-color, $btn-secondary-bg, $btn-
secondary-border);
}
.btn-info {
  @include button-variant($btn-info-color, $btn-info-bg, $btn-info-border);
}
You will find the variables beginning with $btn-primary- and $btn-
secondary- in the
bower_components/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss file.
Following this pattern, we can generate our custom feature button in four simple steps:
First, we'll set up a new set of button variables. In the
1.
_scss/includes/_variables.scss file, under // Buttons, make a copy of
the three $btn-primary- variables, and customize them, replacing -primary-
with -feature- and using $brand-feature as the background color:
        $btn-feature-color:              #fff;
        $btn-feature-bg:                 $brand-feature;
        $btn-feature-border:             darken($btn-feature-bg, 5%);

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 244 ]
Next, we can make a file to keep our custom buttons. Create
2.
scss/includes/_buttons.scss and write a mixin based on the .btn-
primary mixin from bootstrap/_buttons.scss, as follows:
        .btn-feature {
          @include button-variant($btn-feature-color, $btn-feature-bg,
          $btn-feature-border);
Save this file and add it to the import sequence in scss/app.scss as follows:
3.
        @import "includes/carousel"; @import "includes/buttons"; // added
Now, in the html/pages/index.html file, change the button class from btn-
4.
primary to btn-feature. While we're at it, we want to make the button large,
so add the btn-lg class:
        <a class="btn btn-feature btn-lg pull-right" href="#">   Learn more
Save your work. Run the bootstrap watch command, and you should see the following
result. The primary column to the left now has a larger font size and a large button with our
brand-feature color:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 245 ]
Meanwhile, the font size and button colors of the secondary (center) column are exactly
what we want. What needs to happen next is this: we need to de-emphasize the tertiary
column content so that it takes its appropriate place in the informational hierarchy.
Adjusting the tertiary column
Our task for the tertiary content is fairly straightforward. We have to reduce the font size
and de-emphasize the buttons. This can be accomplished as follows:
First, we'll adjust the font-size. In Bootstrap's _variables.scss file, the
1.
$font-size-sm variable is set as follows:
        $font-size-sm:               .875rem !default;
Now we need only add these lines to the _scss/includes/_page-
2.
contents.scss file:
        .content-tertiary {
          font-size: $font-size-sm;
        }
If you have run the bootstrap watch command already, you should see the
3.
font size reduce, after saving your changes.
Next, in the html/pages/index.html file, we need to edit our button classes.
4.
We'll change them from btn-primary to btn-secondary, and we'll reduce their
size using the btn-sm class:
        <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm pull-right" href="#">Read more
...
This will reduce the button size and turn the button's background white.
5.

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 246 ]
Let's adjust the background to a light gray and adjust the font color and border as
6.
well. In the _variables.scss file, adjust the values for the three $btn-
secondary- variables as follows:
        $btn-secondary-color:              $gray;
        $btn-secondary-bg:                 $gray-lightest;
        $btn-secondary-border:             darken($btn-secondary-bg, 5%);
Save the changes, compile the file, and refresh your browser.
We now have a clear visual hierarchy, from the primary content (on the left), to the
secondary (center), and tertiary (right):
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 247 ]
Now, take a moment to notice that our adjustments work reasonably well in the narrow
single-column layout as well:

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 248 ]
In narrow viewports, our three columns stretch out vertically, one after the other, with
primary content first, followed by secondary and tertiary.
All that remains is some fine-tuning to make our content even more user friendly across
devices and viewports.
Fine touches for multiple viewports
It's always good to give our content—and our viewers' eyes—some room to breathe. Visual
indicators of section boundaries are good as well. Let's fold these in:
First, we'll add padding above and below our content. Add a bit of top padding
1.
to the main element itself. This padding will serve us well in all viewports, so we
won't need a media query:
        main {
          padding-top: $spacer-y;
          padding-bottom: $spacer-y * 2;
        }
That's it. Our main content layout is ready. Now for the complex footer area.
Laying out a complex footer
In the following steps, we'll create a complex footer built to manage multiple goals,
including three lists of links to key sections of our website, a bit of About Us text, social
icons, and our logo.
Setting up the markup
We will start by creating the footer markup. We want this footer to be as functional and
useful for the user as possible. We'll build the markup as follows:
Start with the footer of the Portfolio project from Chapter 5, Bootstrappin' Your
1.
Portfolio. You'll find the HTML Markup code of the footer in the
html/includes/footer.html file.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 249 ]
Move HTML code for the logo and add it directly under the social links and
2.
create a new include for the additional footer content as follows:
        <footer role="contentinfo">
        {{> footercolumns}}
        <div class="container social-logo">
        <ul class="social">
          <li class="social-item"><a href="#" class="social-link"
          ><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li>
          <li class="social-item"><a href="#" class="social-link"
          ><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li>
          <li class="social-item"><a href="#" class="social-link"
          ><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li>
          <li class="social-item"><a href="#" class="social-link"
          ><i class="fa fa-google-plus"></i></a></li>
          <li class="social-item"><a href="#" class="social-link"
          ><i class="fa fa-github-alt"></i></a></li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="{{root}}index.html"><img src="{{root}}images/logo.png"
         width="80" alt="Bootstrappin'"></a></p>
        </div>
        </footer>
Now create a new HTML partial called html/includes/footercolumns.html.
3.
You can pass the additional footer content into this file.
Before pasting the content, let's prepare to utilize the Bootstrap grid system. To
4.
do this, we'll wrap the area within div class="row", as follows:
        <div class="container">
          <div class="row">
            ...
          </div><!-- /.row -->
        </div><!-- /.container -->
Now, paste the new content in place.
5.
Next, we'll wrap each of the three lists of links, along with their headings, in a
6.
col-lg-2 class div . This way, each list will take one-sixth of the available width
in medium and larger viewports. Together, these three lists will take half the
available viewport width.

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 250 ]
Now, to complete our row, wrap the About Us heading and its paragraph in
7.
col-lg-6 class div so that it takes up the remaining half of the available width:
        <div class="about col-lg-6">
          <h3>About Us</h3>
Be sure to add the necessary closing tags for each new div element.
Save, run the bootstrap watch or gulp command, and check your results.
8.
After performing the preceding steps, you should end up with the following HTML code:
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class=col-lg-2">
      <h3>Categories</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Shoes</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Clothing</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Accessories</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Men</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Women</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Kids</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Pets</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-2">
      <h3>Styles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Athletic</a>  </li>
        <li><a href="#">Casual</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Dress</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Everyday</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Other Days</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Alternative</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Otherwise</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-2">
      <h3>Other</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Link</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Another link</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Link again</a></li>

</div><!-- /.container -->
Due to the Bootstrap grid classes we've added in our HTML in a viewport of 980 pixels and
larger, our columns should organize themselves as follows:
This is the layout we want in large and extra-large viewports. Extra-small screen sizes are
served just fine by the single-column layout. However, for tablet-width screen sizes that fall
within the range of 768 to 980 pixels, our layout can benefit from some adjustments. Let's
address that.

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 252 ]
Adjusting for tablet-width viewports
Test the layout in a viewport that falls between 768 and 980 pixels. Bootstrap refers to this as
the medium breakpoint and col-md- grid classes. At this width, the single-column layout
leaves unnecessary white space. Here is what you'll see:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 253 ]
We can improve this layout by allowing our three lists of links to float next to each other.
Using the Bootstrap col-md-* column classes for Bootstrap's grid, let's set the three lists of 
links to be one-third width, or col-sm-4, and the About Us column to be full width, or
col-sm-12:
<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-2">
...
<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-2">
...
<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-2">
...
<div class="about col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
Save this and try it out in the medium viewport range. You will see the following result:
Much improved! But we're not quite finished. Try clicking on the links in the upper three
columns. Chances are that you won't be able to. Inspect the element and you'll find that the
fourth div element contains the code for the About Us column. This code does not clear the
floated columns above it. Though the About Us heading and its paragraph will appear
below the three floating columns, the div element itself will overlap them.
Adding a targeted responsive clearfix
In a standard Bootstrap layout situation, we would use a div element with the row class to
clear the floating columns. Here, we need a different solution, as we want this block of
content to clear floats only within this specific breakpoint.

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 254 ]
To accomplish this, we could write custom styles in our Sass files. But we can also use a
Bootstrap responsive utility class to provide a targeted clearfix directly in the markup.
Since we've already specified grid classes in our markup, let's use the second option in this
context.
You can find the approach we'll use mentioned in Bootstrap's documentation at h t t p : / / g e t
b o o t s t r a p . c o m / l a y o u t / g r i d / # e x a m p l e - r e s p o n s i v e - c o l u m n - r e s e t s. Following that
method, we'll create a div element with the clearfix class, and add a Bootstrap
responsive utility class to make it visible only on small screens. We'll place this new div
element immediately prior to the About Us column:
<!-- Add the extra clearfix for only the required viewport -->
<div class="clearfix hidden-sm-down hidden-lg-up"></div>
<div class="about col-xs-12 col-lg-6">
The clearfix class will force this element to clear the floats above it. The hidden-sm-
down and hidden-lg-up classes will allow this div to display only within our targeted
breakpoint. At other breakpoints, it will be as if this div does not exist.
Save this, and you should find that the About Us column now clears the floats above it and
that the links are clickable.
Task complete. Now for a few finishing touches.
Refining the details
We have a few final touches we want to implement as we finish our footer. These include
the following:
Refining the presentation of our three lists of links
Adjusting margins and padding
Reversing the color scheme to match our navbar colors
To accomplish these refinements, we'll write some custom styles. Let's tackle this in
cascading fashion, starting with general rules for the footer and moving to the specific rules:
Open _footer.scss, the file for custom footer styles, in your editor.
1.
Here, you'll find some initial rules that are carried over from Chapter 5,
2.
Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio. These include some initial padding for the footer, as
well as styles for the social icons and the footer version of the logo.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 255 ]
Now to add the refinements we need for our new complex footer. Let's start by
3.
reducing the footer font size and inverting the color scheme to correspond with
the inverted navbar—a blue background with light text. I'll begin with those
colors and then darken them slightly. To do this, I'll make use of appropriate
variables from Bootstrap's _variables.scss and the local
scss/includes/_variables.scss files, including $font-size-sm, $navbar-
md-bg, and $navbar-md-color:
        footer[role="contentinfo"] {
          padding-top: 24px;
          padding-bottom: 36px;
          font-size: $font-size-sm;
          background-color: darken($navbar-md-bg, 18%);
          color: darken($navbar-md-color, 18%);
        }
In this and all that follows, we need to nest our new rules within
footer[role="contentinfo"].
Next, we need to adjust our links and buttons to fit the new color scheme. Still
4.
nesting rules within footer[role="contentinfo"], I've done this as follows:
        footer[role="contentinfo"] {
          a {
              color: $navbar-md-color;
              @include hover-focus-active {
                color: $navbar-md-hover-color;
              }
          }
          .btn-secondary {
            color: darken($navbar-md-bg, 18%) !important;
          }
        }
Now to address the four h3 headings. I'll adjust font size, trim the bottom margin,
5.
and convert the text to uppercase:
        footer[role="contentinfo"] {
          h3 {
            font-size: 120%;
            margin-top: $spacer-y;
            margin-bottom: 4px;
            text-transform: uppercase;
          }

Bootstrappin' Business
[ 256 ]
        }
Having done this, we can next remove bullets from our list of links, and adjust
6.
their padding and margin:
          ul {
            list-style: none;
            padding: 0;
            margin: 0;
          }
And we can center the logo and social icons:
7.
footer[role="contentinfo"] {
  .social-logo {
    text-align: center;
  }
}
Finally, let's adjust our social icons. We'll add a bit of top padding and then
8.
adjust their colors to work better with the new color scheme. Since these are Font
Awesome icons, we can do this simply by adjusting the color and background-
color values, as follows:
        .social-link {
          display: inline-block;
          font-size: 18px;
          line-height: 30px;
          @include square(30px); // see includes/mixins/_size.scss
          border-radius: 36px;
          background-color: darken($navbar-md-bg, 27%);
          color: darken($navbar-md-color, 18%);
          margin: 0 3px 3px 0;
          @include hover-focus { // bootstrap/scss/mixins/_hover.scss
          text-decoration: none;
            background-color: darken($navbar-md-bg, 32%);
            color: $navbar-md-hover-color;
          }
        }

Summary
This project has enabled us to beef up our Bootstrappin' skills in a number of ways. We've
designed a responsive layout for the main content of our page, providing an appropriate
visual hierarchy for three tiers of information. At the top of our page we've built a complex
responsive navbar, so that it appears below the logo and banner area in medium, large, and
extra-large viewports and yet collapses into a mobile-friendly navbar on smaller screens.
The footer part of the project effectively manages multiple blocks of links and text across
viewports.
Congratulations! In the next chapter, we'll build on these skills by designing a products
page suitable for an e-commerce section for this website.

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
Having built our business home page, it's time to design our online store.
We'll build on the design from the previous chapter, adding a new page with the following
elements:
A grid of product thumbnails, titles, and descriptions
A left-hand sidebar with options to filter our products by category, brand, and so
on
Breadcrumbs and pagination to ease navigation through our inventory
Take a few moments to visit websites such as Zappos ( h t t p : / / w w w . z a p p o s . c o m) and
Amazon ( h t t p : / / w w w . a m a z o n . c o m). Search or browse for products and you will see
product grids with features similar to what we will be creating in this chapter.

When complete, we want our products page to look like the following screenshot on
medium, large and extra-large screens:

On extra-small screens, we want our products page to adjust to the following single column
layout:
Bootstrap gives us a big head start in accomplishing this design-after which we can use the
power of Sass to refine things to completion.

Surveying the markup for our products page
You'll find this chapter's files prepared and ready in the folder chapter7/start. This
project builds directly on the completed design from Chapter 6, Bootstrappin' Business. If
anything in these files seems strange, you may want to review Chapter 6, Bootstrappin'
Business, before proceeding.
If you've not already downloaded the exercise files, you can find them at h
t t p : / / p a c k t p u b . c o m / s u p p o r t.
Run the bower install and npm install commands in your console before going on
with the next steps! For this chapter, there is one new file in the html/pages directory,
products.html.
Open products.html in your editor to view the markup. Let's survey its contents.
Inside the main role="main" element is where we'll find what's new. Here, you'll find the
following elements in the same order as they appear:
Breadcrumb links marked up as an ordered list
A page title within a h1 heading
A series of options for filtering products
Nine products with thumbnails, titles, descriptions, and a button
An unordered list of pagination links just below the products and before
You can run the bootstrap watch command and point your browser to
http://localhost:8080/products.html to view the file in your browser. You'll see
that much remains to be done. Breadcrumbs do not yet look like breadcrumbs, the filtering
options look like a long series of bulleted lists, the layout of our product items is uneven
(and in places broken), and so on.
Don't let these current imperfections worry you. These are the things that we'll be
addressing in the following steps. Here is what's coming:

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 264 ]
We will apply Bootstrap's built-in styles to the breadcrumbs, page title, and
pagination, and then customize them further
We will improve the layout of the nine product items, innovating the Bootstrap
grid system to maintain a visually well-organized grid across breakpoints
We will style the filtering options by enhancing the layout and then using the
Font Awesome icons to provide checkboxes
Run the bootstrap watch or gulp command in your console and point your browser to
http://localhost:8080/products.html. Your browser will automatically reload now
after saving the Sass or HTML templates.
Now that we have a plan, let's get started!
Styling the breadcrumbs, page title, and
pagination
In the following steps, we'll apply Bootstrap styles to our breadcrumbs, page title, and
pagination, and then customize them to fit our design:
Open products.html in your editor.
1.
Find the ordered list just above the h1 page title, add the "breadcrumb" class to
2.
the ol tag, and then add the "active" class to the last list item, as follows:
    <ol class="breadcrumb">
      <li class="breadcrumb-item"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
      <li class="breadcrumb-item"><a href="#">Parent Category</a></li>
      <li class="breadcrumb-item active">Current Category</li>
    </ol>
These classes correspond with Bootstrap breadcrumb styles, which you will
find documented at h t t p : / / v 4 - a l p h a . g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / c o m p o n e n t s / b r e
a d c r u m b /.
Save and refresh your browser. You should see the result shown in the
following screenshot:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 265 ]
To customize the breadcrumbs for this design, let's remove the light gray
3.
background and the extra padding.
Let's set the padding to 0 and remove the background-color entirely
Create a new Sass partial in the scss/_includes directory called
_breadcrumb.scss and add the following SCSS to it:
.breadcrumb {
padding: 0;
background-color: initial;
}
Do not forget to import the new _breadcrumb.scss partial file into your
4.
app.scss file as follows:
// Components
@import "includes/breadcrumb";
Now for the page title. The page title works by nesting the top-level page heading
5.
within a div tag of the page-header class. The SCSS code for the page-header
class can be edited in a new scss/includes/_page-header.scss partial and
may look as shown here:
// Page header
// -------------------------
.page-header {
  padding-bottom: ($spacer / 2);
  margin: $spacer 0 ($spacer / 2);
  border-bottom: 1px solid $page-header-border-color;
}
Notice that you'll have to declare the $page-header-border-color;
variable in the scss/includes/_varaibels.scss file and of course
also have to import the scss/includes/_page-header.scss partial
in the main app.scss file.
Let's adjust our markup accordingly. For the title, a h1 tag with Bootstrap's
6.
display-* classes will be used. Let's also add some text within a small tag
having Bootstrap's text-muted class to take advantage of the Bootstrap style for
adding the explanatory notes to our headings:
    <div class="page-header">
      <h1 class="display-5">Product Category Name <small class="text-

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 266 ]
muted">with explanatory text</small></h1>
    </div>
That will produce the following result:
You can read more about Bootstrap's typography and heading classes at the
7.
following URL: v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/content/typography/#headings.
Finally, the pagination. Our markup for this is found just a few lines above the
8.
closing main tag (</main>). Above that closing tag, you'll see commented closing
div tags for the .container, .row, and .products-grid:
          </div><!-- /.products-grid -->
        </div><!-- /.row -->
      </div><!-- /.container -->
    </main>
Bootstrap's documentation for pagination styles is found at v4-
alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/pagination.
To apply these styles here, we only need to add class="pagination"
to the ul tag that you will find a few lines above the closing
.products-grid tag:
  <ul class="pagination">
    <li class="page-item">
      <a class="page-link" href="#" aria-label="Previous">
        <span aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-chevron-left"></span>
        <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li class="page-item active">
      <a class="page-link" href="#">1 <span class="sr-
only">(current)</span></a>
    </li>
    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">2</a></li>
    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">3</a></li>
    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">4</a></li>
    <li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="#">5</a></li>
    <li class="page-item">
      <a class="page-link" href="#" aria-label="Next">
        <span aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-chevron-right"></span>
        <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
      </a>
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 267 ]
    </li>
  </ul>
The markup for the navigation links may contain different classes to set
the state of a link. The active CSS class makes clear that the link has an
active state, whilst the disabled CSS class enables you to give some links
a disabled state.
The HTML code for a disabled item may look like the following:
 <li class="page-item disabled">
   <a class="page-link" href="#" tabindex="-1" aria-label="Previous">
     <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>
     <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
   </a>
 </li>
Neither disabled nor active items are clickable. You can add the add
pagination-lg or pagination-sm CSS classes for larger or smaller
pagination as follows:
<ul class="pagination pagination-lg">
  ...
</ul>
Also notice that Bootstrap takes accessibility into account. The navigation contains various
aria-* attributes. Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of special
accessibility attributes that can be added to any markup, but is especially suited to HTML.
You can read more about ARIA in HTML at the website of the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), see h t t p s : / / w w w . w 3 . o r g / T R / h t m l - a r i a /. Elements with Bootstrap's
sr-only class provided additional information for only screen readers.
For the Next and Prev items, I've already provided the span tags for the
Font Awesome icons, fa-chevron-left and -right. This gives us the
result shown in the following screenshot:
Let's center align the pagination below our grid. First, wrap it in a parent div tag.
9.
We'll place the row class on this to ensure it clears the content above it, and then
we'll add an appropriately named Bootstrap class text-xs-center. The xs in
the naming means for the extra small grid and up:

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 268 ]
<nav class="text-xs-center">
<ul class="pagination">
<li> ...
</ul>
</nav>
Adjusting the products grid
Before you start you should notice that the product images, provided by the holder.js image
placeholders as described in Chapter 6, Bootstrappin' Business, are not responsive. Let's
make all images responsive by default by adding the following lines of SCSS code to our
app.scss file:
// make images responsive by default
img {
  @extend .img-fluid;
}
The process of making images responsive by default was described in Chapter 1, Getting
Started with Bootstrap before. It influence all images. The logo in the also becomes responsive
now and ignores the width we've set in the scss/includes/_header.scss file before.
You can solve that by putting the SCSS code for the responsive image before the import of
the _header.scss file in the app.scss file.
You should also inspect the footer logo after making the images responsive by default.
You'll find that the logo does not center anymore. The img-fluid class changes your
images into block level element. Block level elements cannot be centered by the text-align:
center; declaration. You can use the following CSS code in the file to center the logo again:
  .social-logo {
    img {
      margin 0 auto;
    }
  }
Now let's make our products grid look as it should. Before we start, we move the product
grid to its own HTML template file. Create a new HTML partial called

In the html/includes/products.html file, use the following code to include the product
grid:
      <div class="products-grid col-md-9">
        {{> products-grid }}
      </div>
If you inspect the markup for our product items, you'll see that each item has been given a
class of col-sm-4:
<div class="product-item col-sm-4">
While this constrains the width of each of our product items and the grid automatically
wraps the columns into the row, it has failed to produce an effective grid.
The primary problem here is that our items have varying heights. Thus, when trying to float
left, as Bootstrap grid components do, these items bump into one another. This results in a
broken, uneven layout, as shown in the following screenshot:
Currently, in a medium, large, or extra-large viewport, product items 4 to 7 refuse to float
neatly due to their uneven heights. The problem of your columns don't clear quite right as
one is taller than the other can be solved by using an additional div element with a
combination of the clearfix class and the responsive utility classes. You can read more
about the clearfix and the responsive utility classes in the Chapter 1, Getting Started with
Bootstrap chapter.

Now, let's fix our layout problem. We should clearfix the layout after each third item. You
can do this by adding the following HTML snippet after each third item in the
html/pages/products.html file:
<!-- Add the extra clearfix for only the required viewport -->
<div class="clearfix hidden-sm-down"></div>
Then we want our grid to reduce to two products per row for the medium screens, while
large and extra-large viewports will have three items per row. To accomplish this, we need
to find and replace the classes in each of our product items so that they are as follows:
<div class="product-item col-md-6 col-lg-4">
These classes will set each product item to half width within extra-small and small
viewports, and then transition to one-third width for medium and large viewports.
The preceding change also means that we have to replace and extend our responsive
column resets as follows:
After each third item the HTML code should look as follows:
1.
<!-- Add the extra clearfix for only the required viewport -->
<div class="clearfix hidden-md-down"></div>
The hidden-sm-down class in the preceding code has been replaced with the
2.
class hidden-sm-down. And then add the following lines of HTML after each
second item:
<!-- Add the extra clearfix for only the required viewport -->
<div class="clearfix hidden-sm-down hidden-lg-up"></div>
After the sixth item you will get the following HTML code now:
3.
<!-- Add the extra clearfix for only the required viewport -->
<div class="clearfix hidden-md-down"></div>
<!-- Add the extra clearfix for only the required viewport -->
<div class="clearfix hidden-sm-down hidden-lg-up"></div>
The HTML code after the sixth item above should be replaced with this:
4.
<!-- Add the extra clearfix for only the required viewport -->
<div class="clearfix hidden-sm-down">

Product items will now be laid out in two columns on a medium viewport:

Then, our grid will transform to a three-column layout in large and extra-large

viewports:

Let's adjust the styles of our grid items to enhance their visual presentation.
7.
Having done that, we can fix this layout problem.
As we'll be writing custom styles, create and have the
8.
sccs/includes/_products-grid.scss file open in your editor and import it
into the main app.scss file.
Let's write styles to adjust image width, font size, padding, and margins, as

shown in the following lines of code:
.product-item {
  padding-bottom: ($spacer-y * 2);
  h2 {
    font-size: $font-size-lg;
    line-height: $line-height-lg;
    padding: 0;
    margin-top: ($spacer-y / 7);
    margin-bottom: ($spacer-y / 8);
  }
  p {
    font-size: $font-size-sm;
    line-height: $line-height-sm;
    color: $gray;
  }
}
These styles will accomplish the following:
10.
Add bottom padding to each product item.
1.
Reduce the h2 heading font size to the size of our $font-size-lg.
2.
Reduce the p font size to our $font-size-sm value.
3.
Reduce h2 padding by adding !important to override any conflicting
4.
rules .that we've written to apply in the standard pages.
Set the p font color to $gray.

Save these new styles, and run the bootstrap watch or gulp command. Though the
layout will still be broken in places, you should see significant improvement in the styling
of the product items, as shown in the following screenshot:
It's a beautiful thing to behold.
Don't forget the Card module
In the preceding section you used Bootstrap Grid to build to the product grid. You can also
use Bootstrap's new card module to build the product grid. Cards include header, footers,
top and bottom image caps. You've already meet the Card module in Chapter 4,
Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme, when you created the Masonry grid layout for the
WordPress theme.

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 274 ]
First, create a new HTML partial called html/includes/product-grid-cards.html to
rebuild the product grid using the Cards module. The HTML code for each card should
look as follows:
    <div class="card">
      <a href="#"><img data-src="holder.js/300x200?auto=yes"
      alt="sample product" /></a>
      <div class="card-block">
        <h4 class="card-title"><a href="#">Product Title</a></h4>
        <p class="card-text">This text describes the above product a
        little not too much but just enough or maybe a little more</p>
        <a class="btn btn-secondary btn-sm pull-sm-right" href="#">View
        this product <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right"></i></a>
      </div>
    </div>
Bootstrap enables you to organize your cards in Groups or Decks. In this example, you will
use decks. Decks contain a set of equal width and height cards that aren't attached to one
another. The HTML structure of a Deck of Cards will look as follows:
<div class="card-deck-wrapper">
  <div class="card-deck">
    <div class="card product-item">
   ---
    </div>
    <div class="card product-item">
   ---
You'll have to wrap each block of three cards into its own card-deck wrapper.
The Card and Deck groups got a single breakpoint at between the extra small and small
grid at 576 pixels. Below the breakpoint, the cards will stack. For the small grid between 576
and 768 pixels there are three cards in a row too. This cards are very small, so you'll have to
reduce the size of the button for the small grid by using the following SCSS code:
.product-item {
  .btn-sm {
    @include media-breakpoint-only(sm) {
       font-size: $font-size-sm * 0.8;
    }
  }
}

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 275 ]
In the preceding code, we've reduced the size of the button in the small viewport. Now let's 
add some space between the card for the larger viewports.
In scss/includes/_product-grid.scss you can add the following SCSS code to create
some space between the cards:
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
  .card-deck {
      padding-bottom: ($spacer-y * 2);
  }
}
With the Card Deck, your product grid may look like the following screenshot:

Cards with the CSS3 Flexbox layout module
As already explained in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap, has Bootstrap option
flexbox support built in. You can enable flexbox support by setting the $enable-flex Sass
variable to true.
Create a new HTML partial called html/includes/product-grid-cards-
flexbox.html to test the flexbox layout. Don't forget to replace the include statement in
the html/product.html file as follows:
{{> products-grid-cards-flexbox}}
In the scss/includes/_variables.scss file, add the following line of SCSS code:
// Options
//
// Quickly modify global styling by enabling or disabling optional
features.
$enable-flex:           true;
The html/includes/product-grid-cards-flexbox.html file may contain HTML code
similar to the HTML code used in the html/includes/product-grid-cards-
flexbox.html file. The card-deck-wrapper wrapper is not required when the flexbox
support is enabled. You can wrap all Cards into a single card-deck wrapper. The breakpoint
is still set at 576 pixels. For viewports wider than the breakpoint the flexbox is responsive by
default. The more space there is, the more Cards there are on each row. On large and extra-
large viewports there are four cards on each row by default. Use the flex-basis property to
get three cards on each row. The flex-basis property specifies the initial length of a flexible
item. You can use the following SCSS code to set the flex-basis property:
.card-deck .card {
  flex-basis: 30%;
}

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce

On a medium grid you will got two cards in each row. The last row has only one card,
because of we have an odd number of cards. The last card takes 100% of the available space
and will look like that shown in the following screenshot:
You can try to fix this with Sass by setting the max-width for each card as follows:
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
  .card-deck .card {
    max-width: 46%;
  }
}

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 278 ]
Or alternatively, add an empty card that's only visible on the medium grid by using
Bootstrap's responsive utilities classes:
<div class="card hidden-xs-down hidden-lg-up">
   <!-- empty card -->
</div>
If you've not removed the borders and rounded corners of the cards, you should remove
them for the empty card. You can remove the borders and/or rounded corners with Sass.
Use the following SCSS code to remove the borders from the empty card:
@include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
  .card-deck .card {
    &:last-child {
      border: initial; // 0
    }
  }
}
In the preceding code, :last-child is a CSS pseudo-class. CSS pseudo-classes can be added to
selectors that specifies a special state of the element to be selected. The last-child pseudo-
class selects any element that is the last child element of its parent. You can read more about
the last-child pseudo-class at the following URL:
https://developer.mozilla.org/nl/docs/Web/CSS/:last-child.
Notice that the SCSS code with the & parent reference in front of the last-
child pseudo-class compiles into CSS code as follows:
.card-deck .card:last-child 
border: initial; }
You can read more about the & parent reference in Sass in Chapter 3,
Customizing Your Blog with Bootstrap and Sass.

Now the last cards on the medium grid should look as follows:
Of course, you can you can also remove just the rounded corners by using the following
SCSS code:
.card-deck .card {
    border-radius: initial;
}

Next, we'll style the filtering options sidebar.
Styling the options sidebar
Now, let's style our filtering options. These appear just before the markup for our product
items. In small, medium, and large viewports, they appear as a left-hand sidebar.
At the moment, they appear like the following screenshot:
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 281 ]
For our final design, we want to transform the Clearance Sale link into an attractive extra-
large button and arrange the filtering options into two columns with checkboxes rather than
bullets, as shown in the following screenshot:
Let's begin by setting up some basic styles to lay a basic groundwork.
Setting up basic styles
We'll start by adjusting fonts, colors, margins, and padding.
Let's add these rules to a new Sass partial called _grid-options.scss:
.grid-options {
  @extend .card;
  padding-top: 12px;
  padding-bottom: 24px;
  > h2 {
    margin-top: 0;
    font-size: 1.3 * ($font-size-lg);
    line-height: 1.2;
    color: $gray-dark;

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 282 ]
  }
}
The preceding code does the following:
Adds Bootstrap Card styles to our sidebar (see the relevant Bootstrap
documentation at v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/card/)
Adds top and bottom padding to the sidebar so that our new background extends
past the sidebar content
Adjusts font size, line-height, and color for the h2 heading
Notice that you should not forget to import the _grid-options.scss file into your
app.scss file.
Next, we will style the Clearance Sale link.
Styling the Clearance Sale link
We want to transform our Clearance Sale link into an extra-large attractive button.
Let's adjust the markup to do the following:
Turn the linked heading and paragraph into a button.
Add the custom button btn-feature class, which we created in Chapter 6,
Bootstrappin' Business, to give the button our special featured color—red.
Add a Font Awesome icon for a sale tag. We'll make it three times the normal size
by using Font Awesome's built-in icon-3x class.
For more information about Font Awesome's special sizing classes, see the
documentation at h t t p : / / f o n t a w e s o m e . i o / e x a m p l e s / # l a r g e r.
The resulting HTML markup is as follows:
<a class="btn btn-feature choose-clearance" href="#">
  <span class="icon fa fa-tag fa-3x"></span>
  <h3>Clearance Sale</h3>
  <p>View clearance items</p>
</a>
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 283 ]
This immediately gives us a good start towards our desired result as shown in the following
screenshot:
Now to polish it up, perform the following steps:
Display the Clearance Sale button as a block-level element by setting the display
1.
property to block and center it by extending Bootstrap's m-x-auto class. The
m-x-auto class is part of Bootstrap's Utility classes and centers fixed-width block
level content by setting the horizontal margins to auto.
Force its width to fill 92.5 percent of its containing column.
2.
Add top and bottom padding.
3.
Override Bootstrap's white-space:nowrap rule for buttons, so that our text can
4.
wrap as it should (See Bootstrap's white-space rule in
/bootstrap/scss/_buttons.scss. You can learn more about the white-
space property at h t t p : / / c s s - t r i c k s . c o m / a l m a n a c / p r o p e r t i e s / w / w h i t e s p a c
e /.)
Position it relatively so that we can apply absolute positioning to the tag icon.
5.
Adjust font, color, font-size, and margins on our heading and paragraph.
6.
Position the tag icon at the top right.
7.
We can accomplish these goals by adding the following style rules:
.choose-clearance {
  @extend .m-x-auto;
  display: block;
  width: 92.5%;
  padding-top: $spacer-y * 2;
  padding-bottom: $spacer-y;
  font-size: 90%;
  white-space: normal;
  position: relative;
  h3 {
    font-weight: normal;
    color: #fff;

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 284 ]
    padding-top: $spacer-y / 2;
    margin: $spacer / 3;
  }
  p {
    margin: $spacer / 3 $spacer * 2;
    line-height: 1.2;
  }
  .icon {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    right: 2px;
  }
}
Notice that the background-color of the Clearance Sale button is set by the class in the
HTML code in the html/pages/products.html file. The btn-feature class is generated
via the scss/includes/_buttons.scss partial file with the following SCSS code:
.btn-feature {
  @include button-variant($btn-feature-color, $btn-feature-bg,
  $btn-feature-border);
}
At the end, this gives us a pleasing result, as is evident from the following screenshot:
As a bonus, these styles work well across viewport sizes. Take a few moments to test it.
Then of course, as always, feel free to take what we've begun and beautify it further.
Meanwhile, let's move down to the options for filtering our products.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 285 ]
Styling the options list
In this section, we will transform our lists of product filtering options.
If you take a moment to examine the markup of product filtering options in a store such as
Amazon ( h t t p : / / w w w . a m a z o n . c o m) or Zappos ( h t t p : / / w w w . z a p p o s . c o m), you'll find that
they are composed lists of links that have been specially styled to appear like checkboxes.
We will style our links to look like checkboxes, which will appear as checked once selected,
and we'll adjust them to work nicely across devices, such as tablet and phone devices.
On e-commerce websites such as Amazon and Zappos, the filter options
are connected to a content management system, which dynamically
updates the grid of shown products in response to the options selected.
Bootstrap is a frontend design framework, and not a content management
system. Thus, we will not be dynamically filtering our products as a part
of this project. Instead, we will prepare a design that is ready to be used in
the context of a complete content management system.
In the coming section, we'll use the HTML code from the html/pages/products.html
file. The HTML code of an option list may look as follows:
<h3>Brands</h3>
  <ul class="options-list options-brands">
    <li><a href="#">Option 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Option 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Option 3</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Option 4</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Option 5</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Option 6</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Option 7</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Option 8</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Option 9</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Option 10</a></li>
  </ul>
Edit your SCSS code in the scss/includes/_grid-options.scss partial file. We'll start
with the h3 headings for the lists, adjusting their size, line-height, margin, and color:
.grid-options {
  > h3 {
    font-size: $font-size-lg;
    line-height: 1.2;
    margin-top: $spacer-y / 2;
    color: $gray-dark;
  }
}

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 286 ]
We need to use the >h3 child selector since we don't want these rules to
apply to other h3 tags, especially the one within our Clearance Sale
button.
Now, let's turn our attention to the unordered lists. These have a special class of options-
list, which we'll use as our selector to ensure we're targeting only these special lists.
First, let's remove bullets and padding:
.options-list {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding-left: 0;
}
Now we'll style the links. Shortly, we'll also style the list items, so we'll include them in the
sequence of nested selectors.
.options-list {
  list-style-type: none;
  padding-left: 0;
  li {
    a {
       @extend .btn;
       @extend .btn-sm;
       padding-left: 0;
       padding-right: 0;
       color: $gray;
       @include hover-focus-active {
         color: $link-color;
       }
     }
   }
}
The rules we just set accomplish the following:
We'll use the power of Sass' extend feature to pull in the fundamental button
styles associated with the btn class that includes displaying the inline-block
link and the addition of padding.
Since we added no other button class, there is no background color
What we gain from these basic button styles is a convenient way to make our
links user-friendly click targets-including fingers on touch devices
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 287 ]
We then extend the styles associated with the btn-sm class to reduce padding
and for the font-size to be a bit smaller than the standard button (for a refresher
on Bootstrap button classes, go to v4-
alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/buttons/)
We then remove unneeded left and right padding
We change the color of our link text to $gray
Finally, we set the color of hovered, focused, and active links to our $link-
color value
You may want to save, compile, and test the results. The following screenshot depicts the
result we get:
Our option links have gained improved padding and font size and taken our desired colors.
You may be wondering why I've chosen to extend the button styles by
using the .btn and .btn-sm classes in our Sass files rather than adding
the classes directly to the markup. We could do the latter, but given the
number of option links, I think you will agree that it is far more efficient to
apply the styles via CSS as we've done. In the section that follows, I will
continue this pattern and extend it by bringing in Font Awesome icons via
Sass rather than by adding markup.
Now we'll add checkboxes to our option links.
Adding Font Awesome checkboxes to our option
links
In this section, we'll use Font Awesome icons to add an empty checkbox to the left of each
option link. Rather than adding icons in the markup, we will do it here via Sass as it will be
far more efficient. Then we'll push a step further, adding styles to pull in an alternate Font
Awesome icon-for a checked checkbox – to the hovered, focused, and active option links.

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 288 ]
Adding icons via Sass requires extending Font Awesome styles. First, we will take these
fundamental styles from the fa base class, which can be found in the _core.scss file in the
bower_components/font-awesome folder. In this file, you'll find the following key styles:
.#{$fa-css-prefix} {
  display: inline-block;
  font: normal normal normal #{$fa-font-size-base}/#{$fa-line-height-base}
  FontAwesome; // shortening font declaration
  font-size: inherit; // can't have font-size inherit on line above,
  so need to override
  text-rendering: auto; // optimizelegibility throws things off #1094
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}
In the preceding code we've used the .#{$fa-css-prefix} selector,
which is based on Sass' variable interpolation. The Sass compiler uses the
#{} interpolation syntax to compile variables into selectors and property
names. Read more about variable interpolation in Sass at the following
URL: h t t p : / / s a s s - l a n g . c o m / d o c u m e n t a t i o n / f i l e . S A S S _ R E F E R E N C E . h t
m l # i n t e r p o l a t i o n _
These styles establish the fundamental rules for all Font Awesome icons, including the Font
Awesome icon for the font family and then refine the details of its presentation.
For our present purposes, we do not need the selector or the braces but only the rules. We
will take these and apply them to our links. Primarily, we'll use the :before pseudo-
element as it ensures the best results.
For more information about the CSS2.1 :before pseudo-element, go to h t
t p : / / c o d i n g . s m a s h i n g m a g a z i n e . c o m / 2 0 1 1 / 0 7 / 1 3 / l e a r n i n g - t o - u s e - t h
e - b e f o r e - a n d - a f t e r - p s e u d o - e l e m e n t s - i n - c s s /.
So edit the following rules in the _grid-options.scss file, nested as follows:
.options-list {
  li {
    a {
      &:before {
        @extend .#{$fa-css-prefix};
      }
    }
  }
}
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 289 ]
These rules establish the fundamentals. Next, we need to specify which Font Awesome icon
to use. Browsing the options at h t t p : / / f o n t a w e s o m e . i o / i c o n s /, we find the following
open checkbox icon:
The Sass rules for this icon are found in the _icons.scss file inside the font-awesome
folder. By opening that file and searching for the }-square-o string (including the closing
curly brace before -square-o to narrow the results), we can find the following relevant
line:
.#{$fa-css-prefix}-square-o:before { content: $fa-var-square-o; }
From the previous line, we only need content: $fa-var-square-o, which we can copy
and paste in the _grid-options.scss file directly after the preceding rules, which are
applied to our a:before selector or alternatively extend the .fa-square-o:before
selector:
.options-list {
  li {
    a {
      &:before {
        @extend .#{$fa-css-prefix};
           @extend .#{$fa-css-prefix}-square-o:before;
      }
    }
  }
}
Finally, we want to grab Font Awesome styles to give our icons a fixed width and to avoid
any shifting when the icon changes to the checked version. These styles are found in the
_fixed-width.scss file inside the font-awesome folder. Extend the .fa-fw class as
follows:
.options-list {
  li {
    a {
      &:before {
        @extend .#{$fa-css-prefix};
        @extend .#{$fa-css-prefix}-square-o:before;
        @extend .#{$fa-css-prefix}-fw;
      }
    }
  }
}

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 290 ]
After adding these rules, run the bootstrap watch command and inspect the results in your
browser. You should see the checkboxes appear as shown in the following screenshot:
Now, following the same approach, we'll add the following selectors and rules to apply the
checked version of the Font Awesome icon to the hovered, focused, and active states of our
links:
.options-list {
  li {
    a {
      &:before {
        @extend .#{$fa-css-prefix};
        @extend .#{$fa-css-prefix}-square-o:before;
        @extend .#{$fa-css-prefix}-fw;
      }
       @include hover-focus-active {
         color: $link-color;
         &:before {
           content: $fa-var-check-square-o;
         }
      }
    }
  }
}
Bootstrap's hover-focus-active mixin can be found in the
bower_components/bootstrap/scss/mixins/_hover.sccs partial. You can use this
mixin to set the active, hover, and focus states once.
Save the file, and inspect the results in your browser. You'll find that the checked version of
the square icon appears when you hover on one of the links, as shown in the following
screenshot:

As a reminder, it is not currently possible to force one of these links to stay
in the active state as we have no content management system in place.
What we do have is a set of styles ready and waiting to go to work in the
context of such a content management system.
That's it! We've successfully given our links the appearance of checkboxes to provide
desired user feedback.
Next, let's make more efficient use of our space by floating our options side by side.
Using Sass mixins to arrange option links in
columns
In the previous section, we used custom Sass rules to accomplish things that might have
been accomplished by adding markup. Given the number of option links we need to
manage, this has proven significantly more efficient. The same dynamic applies when we
want to arrange our option links into columns.
We might accomplish our desired result by using Bootstrap row and column classes,
adjusting our markup with the following pattern:
<ul class="options-list options-categories row">
     <li class="col-xs-6"><a href="#">Option 1</a></li>
     <li class="col-xs-6"><a href="#">Option 2</a></li>
     ...
In Chapter 6, Bootstrappin' Business, you saw that the Panini template
engine does support loops and iterations. Using loops in your template is
also an alternative for DRY coding and preventing duplicate code.
An example can be found in the html/pages/products.html file. The
code of the first list looks as follows:
{{#each numbers-10}}
<li><a href="#">Option {{this}}</a></li>
{{/each}}
The numbers-10 variable is read from the file, which contains the number 1 through 10 in
YAML format. Using the index of the iteration seem to make more sense, but unfortunately,
Panini does not support this feature of Handlebars. See also h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / z u r b / p a
n i n i / i s s u e s / 6 7.

[ 292 ]
Thanks to the power of Bootstrap's mixins, we can accomplish the same result with a few
lines of Sass, as shown in the following steps:
First, we'll apply the make-row() mixin to the options-list selector, as
1.
follows:
        .options-list {
          @include make-row();
        }
This mixin applies the same styles to our options list that we would have gained
2.
by applying the row class in the markup. In this case, it's simply more efficient to
do it here.
Next, we can use a make-col(6) mixin and set the number of column to six to
3.
apply column rules to our list items as follows:
         .grid-options {
           @include make-row();
           li {
             @include make-col-ready();
             @include make-col(6);
           }
         }
This will apply the same styles to our list items as would be applied if we had
4.
added the col-xs-6 class to each of the relevant li tags. Later on, you will read
how to make the columns responsive.
After adding the preceding lines, save the file, compile to CSS, and refresh your browser.
You should see the option links line up in two columns:
Not bad!
We will now make some adjustments for smaller viewports.

Adjusting the options list layout for tablets and
phones
We need to constrain the width of our options panel so that it does not range too widely in
tablet-width devices.
On the medium grid for tablets, between 768 and 992 pixels, neither the Clearance Sale
button nor the options fit the column, as shown in the following screenshot:
We can fix this issues with the options by using Sass and force the options into a single
column again for the medium grid as follows:
.grid-options {
  @include make-row();
  li {
    @include make-col-ready();
    @include make-col(6);
    @include media-breakpoint-only(md) {
       @include make-col(12);
    }
  }
}

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 294 ]
The preceding SCSS code does not fix the Clearance Sale button for the medium grid. You
may try the reduce the font size to fix it.
Alternatively, you can adopt the main grid the solve the issues on the medium grid. In the
html/pages/products.html file change the grid classes as shown here:
<div class="grid-options col-md-4 col-lg-3">
 ...
</div>
<div class="products-grid col-md-8 col-lg-9">
 ...
</div>
The grid-options area will span four columns on the medium grid now. The problems for
the medium grid are fixed. Let's take on the small grid.
Right now, our Clearance Sale button stretches too wide, and our options list items spread
too far apart on viewports between 480 pixels and 768 pixels wide. Thus, they can end up
appearing like the following screenshot:
This can be easily fixed by setting a max-width property with a value of 480 pixels for the
entire options panel:
.grid-options {
  max-width: 480px;
}
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 295 ]
Now let's adjust our option list items so that they organize themselves in three columns in
small viewports. Using Sass, we can nest a media query within the appropriate selector and
add an adjusted make-col(4) mixin, as shown in the following code snippet:
.grid-options {
  @include make-row();
  li {
    @include make-col();
    @include make-col(6);
    @include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {
       @include make-col(4);
    }
  }
}
After making these adjustments, save the file and test in a narrow viewport. You should see
the result shown in the following screenshot:
Now let's address the next problem facing our single-column layout: we need to hide our
options away until they're needed.

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 296 ]
Collapsing the options panel for phone users
At present, our options take up a considerable amount of vertical space. This creates a
problem in narrow viewports. The single-column layout winds up pushing our grid of
products far down the page.
This is a great deal of vertical space for options that are not needed. The products
themselves are priority items. We need to allow users of phones to find the products more
quickly while still allowing them to access the filtering options when desired.
We'll use Bootstrap's collapse plugin for this. In the following steps, we'll apply the collapse
plugin to the options panel, add a button to expand the panel when desired, and restrict the
behavior to narrow viewports only:
Open your editor with products.html.
1.
Add a new div tag to wrap our Clearance Sale button and three options lists. We
2.
need to give this new div a special class of collapse as well as a distinctive ID so
that we can target it with our JavaScript plugin. For good measure, we'll give it a
matching special class as well:
        <h2>Narrow your selection</h2>
        <div id="options-panel" class="options-panel collapse">
        ...
        </div>
Notice that the collapse class in the previous step hides the content for all
3.
viewports. You can add the navbar-toggleable-sm class to ensure the content
is always visible on larger viewports:
        <h2>Narrow your selection</h2>
        <div id="options-panel" class="options-panel collapse
        navbar-toggleable-sm">
        ...
        </div>
Bootstrap's collapse JavaScript plugin is what powers the collapsible
responsive navbar. It may also be put to other uses, such as the one shown
in the Bootstrap documentation at v4-
alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/collapse/.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 297 ]
Save the file and refresh it in your browser. You should see that the Clearance
4.
Sale button and options lists will now be hidden from view. All that remains of
the options panel content will be the h2 heading Narrow your selection, as
shown in the following screenshot:
Now we need a toggle button to expand our filter options when clicked.
5.
Within the still visible h2 heading that reads Narrow your selection, add a button
6.
element with the following attribute structure:
        <h2 class="clearfix">Narrow your selection
          <button type="button"
            class="options-panel-toggle btn btn-primary pull-right hidden-
md-up"
            data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#options-panel">
            <span class="icon fa fa-cog fa-2x"></span>
          </button>
        </h2>
The following points explain what the preceding markup will do:
7.
The clearfix class will ensure that the h2 heading will contain the
1.
toggle button, which will float to the right due to the pull-right class.
The btn and btn-primary classes will style our new button element
2.
with the Bootstrap's btn styles, which includes our background color
of $brand-primary
The hidden-md-up class hides the button on larger viewports.
3.
Within the button element, we've placed a Font Awesome icon using
4.
the fa-2x class to double its size.
Save this and find the following result in your browser:

In narrow viewports, the options list is collapsed and the toggle button is visible:

In small, medium, and large viewports, the toggle button is hidden, and the 
9.
options list is visible:
Adding a search form to your designing
In the preceding sections we've build a navigation structure. About fifty percent of your
visitors will use this navigation, the other half will prefer to search your content. So a good
ability to search the content and your products must always be represented on your pages.
We can add a search form in the header of our page, which should look as follows:
Edit the following HTML code in the html/includes/header.html file:
   <div class="utility-nav">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#" ><i class="icon fa fa-user
        fa-lg"></i><span> Log In or Register</span></a></li>
        <li><a href="#" ><i class="icon fa fa-shopping-cart

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 300 ]
        fa-lg"></i><span> View Cart</span></a></li>
      </ul>
   </div>
  <form class="search-form form-inline pull-md-right">
    <input class="form-control" type="text" placeholder="Search">
    <button class="btn btn-outline-success hidden-sm-down"
    type="submit">Search</button>
  </form>
  </div>
The following points explain what the preceding markup will do:
The form-inline and form-control classes are Bootstrap classes for inline forms.
You can read more about Bootstrap's inline forms at the following URL: v4-
alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/forms/#inline-forms.
The pull-md-right class will ensure that the form float on the right side of the
header for
The hidden-sm-down class hides the search button on the small viewports; only
the search input is visible in these viewports.
The preceding code overlaps the icons; you can fix this by setting a padding-top using the
following SCSS code in the scss/includes/_header.scss Sass partial:
header[role="banner"] {
  .search-form {
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      padding-top: $spacer-y * 6;
    }
  }
}
The media-breakpoint-up(md) mixin call ensures that the padding is only added for
medium and larger viewports.
Using the Typeahead plugin
Adding an autocomplete function to your search form may improve the usability of search
function. The typeahead plugin from Bootstrap 2 can be used to build an autocomplete
function. More information about this plugin can be found at the following URL: h t t p s : / / g
i t h u b . c o m / b a s s j o b s e n / B o o t s t r a p - 3 - T y p e a h e a d. The plugin is ready to use with
Bootstrap 4.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 301 ]
The following steps describe how to integrate the Typeahead plugin in your project:
First, add the plugin to your bower project dependencies to the bower.json file of
your project, as follows:
   "dependencies": {
    "bootstrap": "4",
    "tether": "^1.1.2",
    "font-awesome": "^4.6.1",
    "bootstrap3-typeahead": "git://github.com/bassjobsen/Bootstrap-3-
    Typeahead.git#master"
  }
Then run the bootstrap update or bower update command in your console.
Then edit the compile-js task in Gruntfile.js to ensure that the plugin is
included in your project:
gulp.task('compile-js', function() {
  return gulp.src([
        bowerpath+ 'jquery/dist/jquery.min.js',
        bowerpath+ 'tether/dist/js/tether.min.js',
        bowerpath+ 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js',
        bowerpath+ 'holderjs/holder.min.js', // Holder.js for project
        development only
        bowerpath+ 'bootstrap3-typeahead/bootstrap3-typeahead.min.js',
        'js/main.js'])
    .pipe(concat('app.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./_site/js/'));
});
Then initiate the plugin and attached it to the search form. Open the js/main.js
and edit the following JavaScript code into it:
 $('.search-form .form-control').typeahead( { items: 4, source:
["Alabama","Alaska","Arizona","Arkansas","California","Colorado","Connectic
ut","Delaware","Florida","Georgia","Hawaii","Idaho","Illinois","Indiana","I
owa","Kansas","Kentucky","Louisiana","Maine","Maryland","Massachusetts","Mi
chigan","Minnesota","Mississippi","Missouri","Montana","Nebraska","Nevada",
"New Hampshire","New Jersey","New Mexico","New York","North Dakota","North
Carolina","Ohio","Oklahoma","Oregon","Pennsylvania","Rhode Island","South
Carolina","South
Dakota","Tennessee","Texas","Utah","Vermont","Virginia","Washington","West
Virginia","Wisconsin","Wyoming"] });

Bootstrappin' E-Commerce
[ 302 ]
And lastly, set the CSS z-index value of the suggestions menu to prevent the
navbar overlapping it. You can set the scss/includes/_header.scss partial
by using the following SCSS code:
header[role="banner"] {
  .search-form {
    @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
      padding-top: $spacer-y * 6;
    }
    .typeahead.dropdown-menu {
      z-index: 2000;
    }
  }
}
Now your search form with autocomplete is ready. Run the Bootstrap watch command and
expect the result in your browser. Type the capital A in the search form and you will find
that a drop-down list with suggestions appears:
The Bootstrap team dropped the typeahead plugin in version 3 in favor of
using typeahead.js; see h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / t w i t t e r / t y p e a h e a d . j s.
To use typeahead.js with Bootstrap 4, some additional CSS code is
required. The required CSS code, include the generation SCSS code, can be
found at the following URL: h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / b a s s j o b s e n / t y p e a h e a
d . j s - b o o t s t r a p 4 - c s s /.
Congratulations! With the search form, we have accomplished our design.

Summary
In this chapter, we have employed Bootstrap styles to quickly set up breadcrumbs, a page
title, and pagination customized according to our needs. Then we created a visually
pleasing grid of product items, all of the same height so as to ensure a regular grid by using
Bootstrap's mobile first and responsive grid styles.
We finished our design by adding a complex Clearance Sale button with a $brand-
feature red background color and a list of filter options that are easily clickable. We also
used Bootstrap column classes with responsive adjustments to arrange our options list
items optimally for multiple viewport widths.
At the end, we also added a search form with an autocomplete function.
Congratulations! We now have an attractive business website with a well-crafted e-
commerce section.
Next, let's take our skills another step forward by rebuilding our project with Angular 2.

Bootstrappin' a One-Page
Marketing Website
We've developed some significant skills with Bootstrap. Now it's time to bring an extra
touch of beauty and creativity to helping our clients achieve their full online marketing
potential. So, let's create a beautiful, one-page, upscale marketing site.
We'll cover the following topics in this chapter:
A large introductory carousel with a customized responsive welcome message
A section for customer reviews with images and captions laid out in the masonry
format
A features list with large Font Awesome icons
A signup section with custom-designed pricing tables
A ScrollSpy navbar with animated scrolling behavior
Overview
We've been approached by a new prospective client. She is stricken by the beauty of one-
pagers websites that scroll vertically, providing a visually stimulating presentation of a
product or message with a clear call to action at the end. She wants one of these.
This client is knowledgeable and discerning. She frequents h t t p : / / o n e p a g e l o v e . c o m and
has a list of her current favorites to hand. Her desired features include:
A clean, modern, aesthetic website.
An introductory welcome message with a visually intriguing background image.
www.ebook3000.com

[ 305 ]
An efficient presentation of the main features of her product, accentuated with
visually appealing icons.
Customer testimony presented in a visually stimulating way.
An easy-to-understand overview of three basic packages that a customer can
choose from. These need to be presented clearly in a way that makes it easy to
choose the right fit and then sign up!
Conversions! Everything should draw the user down the page, making it nearly
impossible to avoid clicking on the Signup button at the end.
To protect the secrecy of her upcoming product launch, our client has chosen not to reveal
the exact nature of her product or service to us. Rather, she has provided mock-ups of the
design she would like us to create by using a dummy copy for placeholders.
The first section will open with an interesting full-width image, a large welcome message,
and an invitation to scroll down the page to learn more, as shown in the following
screenshot:
The second section will list six key features of the product, which are laid out in a three-
column grid, and illustrated by appropriate icons as shown in the following screenshot:

The third section will feature client testimonies with photos and quotations laid out in the
masonry style:

The fourth and final section will feature three available plans, each with a pricing table, and
will have a visual emphasis on the center of the three tables, as shown in the following
screenshot:
Savvy client that she is, she further demands that the design adapt beautifully to tablets and
phones.
A great plan. No problem. Let's get to work.
Surveying the starter files
Let's survey the initial files for this exercise. Create a new project by using Bootstrap CLI, as
already described in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap.
You can install Bootstrap CLI by running the following command in your console:
npm install -g bootstrap-cli

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 308 ]
Then you can set up your project by running the following command:
bootstrap new
Again, choose the An empty new Bootstrap project. Powered by Panini, Sass and Gulp
option when prompted.
You'll see files similar to the template we set up in Chapter 1, Getting Started with Bootstrap:
There are a few additions you will have to make now:
Create a new assets/images folder.
1.
Copy the files in the images folder to the new assets/images folder. It
2.
contains five images:
One logo image, named logo.png.
1.
Two background images for the intro section.
2.
Seven images of happy people for the Impact section.
3.
The images are automatically copied to the _site folder by the copy task in the
3.
Gulpfile.js file:
       // Copy assets
       gulp.task('copy', function() {
         gulp.src(['assets/**/*']).pipe(gulp.dest('_site'));
        });

The html folder, which contains your Panini HTML templates, should have the file and
folder structure shown as follows:
You can read more about Panini at h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / z u r b / p a n i n i.
Instead of the modifications described above, you can also start with the files found in the
chapter8/start folder. In this folder, run the npm install and bower install
commands first. After running the npm and bower commands, you can run the bootstrap
watch or gulp command to view the results in your browser.
Viewing the page content
Run the bootstrap watch command and watch the page in your browser at
http://localhost:8080/. You'll see the following major components in place. Each
component got its own HTML partial. Of course, at present, they will be displayed with
default Bootstrap styles, awaiting the customization that needs to be done:
A fixed top navbar
A jumbotron with a big welcome message
A features section with icons, headings, and text organized in three columns
The Impact section with photos of six happy customers and placeholder content
for their positive testimony
A Sign up now! section with three tables laying out the Basic Plan, Premium
Plan, and Pro Plan packages, with a Sign up now! button under each
A footer logo

To view the markup, open the corresponding Panini HTML partial in your editor. We will
get very familiar with the markup in the steps that follow!
Adding Font Awesome to our project
Font Awesome gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized: size, color,
drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS. In Chapter 5 ,
Bootstrappin' Your Portfolio, you can read how to compile Font Awesome's CSS code into
your local CSS by using Sass.
Here, we simply load Font Awesome's CSS code from CDN by linking it in the
html/layouts/default.html HTML template as follows:
<link rel="stylesheet"
href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.m
in.css">
Adjusting the navbar
This design calls for a fixed top navbar with a significant color shift for hovered and active
links. I've already applied some of these styles by setting appropriate variables. Let me
point those out, and then we'll move on to make some necessary adjustments to the
markup.
The scss/_variables.scss file is based on Bootstrap's variables.scss file. I've
customized the shades of gray in line with previous projects. You'll see these in the topmost
section of the file.
I've further adjusted the following navbar variables, adjusting its height, margin, colors,
and hover colors specifically for this design:
// Navbar
$navbar-bg:                   #fff;
// Navbar links
$navbar-link-color:                $gray;
$navbar-link-bg:                   #fff;
$navbar-link-hover-color:          #fff;
$navbar-link-hover-bg:             $gray;
$navbar-link-active-color:         #fff;
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 311 ]
$navbar-link-active-bg:            $gray-dark;
We'll use the responsive navbar variant as already described in Chapter 1, Getting Started
with Bootstrap. The HTML code for the navbar can be found in the html/includes/page-
header.html file and looks like the following:
<nav class="navbar navbar-fixed-top">
  <div class="container">
  <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-sm-up" type="button" data-
toggle="collapse" data-target="#exCollapsingNavbar2" aria-
controls="exCollapsingNavbar2" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle
navigation">
    ☰
  </button>
  <div class="collapse navbar-toggleable-xs" id="exCollapsingNavbar2">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="index.html"><img
src="{{root}}images/logo.png" alt="Bootstrappin'"></a>
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
      <li class="nav-item active">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Welcome <span class="sr-
only">(current)</span></a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Impact</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Sign up</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  </div>
</nav>
As you can see in the preceding code, the navbar also gets the navbar-fixed-top class,
which fixes the navbar to the top of our page. The navbar-fixed-top class also sets the
border-radius property to 0. The navbar-fixed-top class is one of Bootstrap's
navbar classes determining the placement of the navbar; classes are available for static or
fixed navbars.
Along with the custom variables, I've made a few adjustments to the _navbar.scss file.

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 312 ]
I've customized the list items in the expanded navbar, adding padding, removing the 
spacing between the links, and transforming the text to uppercase:
.navbar {
  background-color: $navbar-bg;
  color: $navbar-link-color;
  padding: 0 1rem;
  .nav-item + .nav-item {
    margin-left: 0;
  }
  .nav-link, .navbar-brand {
    padding: $spacer-y * .75 $spacer-x * 2;
  }
}
.navbar-brand img {
  width: $brand-image-width;
}
.nav-link {
  color: $navbar-link-color;
  line-height: $brand-image-height;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  .active & {
    background-color: $navbar-link-active-bg;
    color: $navbar-link-active-color;
  }
  @include hover {
    background-color: $navbar-link-hover-bg;
    color: $navbar-link-hover-color;
  }
}
Bootstrap's predefined CSS classes also contain some classes for text
transformations. More information about these text capitalization classes
can be found at the following URL: h t t p : / / g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / c o m p o n e n
t s / u t i l i t i e s / # t e x t - t r a n s f o r m.
The original logo image file had these settings: width 900 pixels and height 259 pixels. We
can use these values to calculate the height in Sass when we resize its width to 120 pixels as
follows:
$brand-image-width: 120px;
$brand-image-height: (259 * $brand-image-width / 900);
I use the $brand-image-height variable to set the line-height of the navbar links to
ensure that the brand image and links are in line.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 313 ]
Now the total height of the navbar becomes $brand-image-height + 2 * ($spacer-y
* 0.75). We'll use this value to set the padding-top of the HTML body element, because
the fixed navbar will overlap the body.
The $brand-image-height variable got pixel units, whilst the $spacer-y got rem units.
Sass can't add up these values with different dimensions. You can remove the rem units by
dividing with 1rem. Now the unitless value times $font-size-root will give you the
value in pixels.
First, create a new _page-contents.scss in the main scss/includes folder.
Import it into main.scss just as shown in the following line:
@import "_page-contents";
Then calculating the padding-top value for the HTML body element in scss/app.scss will
look like this:
body {
  padding-top: (2 * ($spacer-y * .75) / 1rem * $font-size-root) + $brand-
image-height;
}
When combined, the adjusted variables and navbar customizations yield these visual
results:
Let's move on to the jumbotron with its big welcome message.
Customizing the jumbotron
The jumbotron is a Bootstrap component highlighting the key message of your website.
More information about the jumbotron and its HTML markup can be found at the following
URL: h t t p : / / v 4 - a l p h a . g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / c o m p o n e n t s / j u m b o t r o n/.
In this section, we'll customize the jumbotron to display our client's big welcome message
with stylistic touches in line with her mockup. This will include adding a large background
image, enlarging the welcome message text, and then adjusting its presentation for multiple
viewports.

In index.html, find the following markup:
    <!-- INTRO SECTION -->
    <section class="jumbotron" id="welcome">
      <div class="container">
      <h1 class="display-3"><strong>Big</strong> Welcome Message</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Ingenious marketing copy. And some <em>more</em> ingenious
marketing copy.<a href="#features" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary pull-xs-
right">Learn more <span class="icon fa fa-arrow-circle-down"></span></a>
      </p>
      </div>
    </section>
Let's start by expanding the height of our jumbotron and putting our desired background
image in place:
Open a new custom Sass partial file, scss/includes/_jumbotron.scss, in
1.
your editor. Don't forget to import it in the scss/app.scss file too.
Now, let's set the height, background color, and font color for the #welcome
2.
section. While we're at it, we'll add some top margin to the button:
     .jumbotron {
       height: 300px;
       background-color: $jumbotron-bg;
       color: $jumbotron-color;
       .btn {
         margin-top: $spacer-y;
  }
}
The background and font color of the jumbotron are set in the
3.
scss/includes/_variable.scss file as follows:
     // Jumbotron
     $jumbotron-bg: #191919;
     $jumbotron-color: contrast($jumbotron-bg);
The contrast() Sass function can be found in the
4.
scss/functions_contrast.scss file. The contrast() function uses the
built-in lightness function of Sass to return a light (white) or dark (black) color
depending on the lightness of the input color.

Using color contrasts in your design may improve the
accessibility of your projects. When your font colors depend on
the background color and change automatically when you change the base
colors of your design, the changes do not influence readability and
accessibility. In this chapter, we'll use a simple contrast() function. Sass
libraries such as Compass have their own contrast function.
Also read Design Accessibly, See Differently: Color Contrast Tips And Tools by
Cathy O' Connor at the following URL: h t t p s : / / w w w . s m a s h i n g m a g a z i n e . c
o m / 2 0
 1 4 / 1 0
 / c o l o r - c o n t r a s t - t i p s - a n d - t o o l s - f o r - a c c e s s i b i l i t y /.
Next, let's use a media query to place our background image for large screens
5.
and up (991px, according to the current default Bootstrap media query
breakpoint values).
If you like, take a few minutes to open and read the documentation about
6.
Bootstrap's responsive breakpoints again. The information can be found at the
following URL: getbootstrap.com/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints.
All media queries are available via Sass mixins.
We can use the power of Sass to nest a media query within the context of the 
7.
jumbotron selector. Within this media query, we'll specify the
subway-906x600.jpg image for the background. This image is scaled to be
large enough for this breakpoint while still loading relatively quickly:
      .jumbotron {
        @include media-breakpoint-down(md) {
         background: url('#{$images-path}subway-906x600.jpg') center center
no-repeat;
       }
     }
Remember that the preceding SCSS code compiles into CSS code as
follows:
@media (max-width: 991px) {
.jumbotron {
background: url("../images/subway-906x600.jpg") center center no-repeat;
}
}

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 316 ]
Save the file, run the bootstrap watch command, and inspect the results in
8.
your browser. You should see the new background image appear – but only
within a window width of 991px or less.
Next, let's expand the height of the jumbotron for tablet-sized viewports. We'll
9.
write a media query only the medium grid, which increases the jumbotron
element's height to 480px within this breakpoint:
        @include media-breakpoint-only(md) {
         height: 480px;
        }
Save the file, run the bootstrap watch command, and watch the results in your
10.
browser. You should see the jumbotron grow to 480px in height for viewports
between 768 px and 991px in width.
Now, for medium and larger (greater than 992px in width) viewports, we'll
11.
increase the height of the jumbotron to 540px. At this width, we'll use the larger
version of the subway-1600x1060.jpg background image. While we're at it,
we'll set the background size to cover:
  @include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {
    height: 540px;
    background: #191919 url('#{$images-path}subway-1600x1060.jpg') center
center no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
  }
With these style rules in place, large viewports will have a 1600px-wide
12.
background image.
Save the file, and test it in your browser. You should find that we have our major
13.
breakpoints nicely covered.

[ 317 ]
After these steps, the Jumbotron should look as shown in the following screenshot:
Notice that we've set a max-width for the small background image by using the @include
media-breakpoint-down(md) mixin call. The preceding may break the mobile-first
approach of Bootstrap. Media queries can be used to conditional-load background images
based on screen size and so reduce load time and bandwidth on mobile phones and tablets.
Read Media Query & Asset Downloading Results by Tim Kadlec for more information
about testing a browser's file requests and media queries. You can find the test result at the
following URL: h t t p s : / / t i m k a d l e c . c o m / 2 0
 1 2 / 0
 4 / m e d i a - q u e r y - a s s e t - d o w n l o a d i n g - r e s
u l t s /.
Next, we can style our big marketing message for maximum impact.
Refining the jumbotron message design
Our client wants the welcome message in the jumbotron to be extra big. Bootstrap's
display-3 styles in the jumbotron increase the font size by 350 % globally. We want to
enhance the results further. We also want to constrain the width of the message on wide
screens and put a dark translucent box behind it.
In our current results, we should reduce the font size for small and extra-small screens. We
can, however, improve the contrast of our text by placing a translucent dark overlay behind
the text. Let's do that here by performing the following steps:

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 318 ]
In index.html, add a new div tag inside the jumbotron container class and
1.
above the h1 heading and paragraph. Give this new div tag a class of welcome-
message:
    <section class="jumbotron">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="welcome-message">
          <h1 class="display-3"><strong>Big</strong> Welcome Message</h1>
          <p class="lead">
             Ingenious marketing copy. And some <em>more</em> ingenious
marketing copy.<a href="#features" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary pull-
right">Learn more <span class="icon fa fa-arrow-circle-down"></span></a>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
Now, to create some styles for this new div, in the 
2.
scss/includes/_jumbotron.sccs file we will perform the following steps:
Give it a translucent dark background using HSLA
Stretch it to fill the full width and height of our jumbotron by positioning it as
absolute and setting its top, bottom, left, and right values to 0
Position the jumbotron itself as relative using the container selector inside
the jumbotron so that it will anchor our absolute-positioned welcome message
Add internal padding to the welcome message
Use the provided strong tag to transform the word Big to uppercase and
increase its font size:
.jumbotron {  .container {    position: relative;    height: 100%;   
.welcome-message {      background-color: hsla(0,0,1%,0.4); // translucent
overlay      position: absolute;       top: 0;      left: 0;      right:
0;      @include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {        right: 50%;      }     
bottom: auto;      padding: 20px 40px;      strong {        font-size:
1.5em;        text-transform: uppercase;      }      @include media-
breakpoint-down(sm) {        .display-3 {          font-size: 1.5em;       
}       }      }  }}
www.ebook3000.com

[ 319 ]
Save the file, run the bootstrap watch command, and inspect the results in your
3.
browser. You should see the background darken and the text stand out more
clearly against it, as shown in the following screenshot:
Finally, let's address the medium and large viewports. We'll constrain the width a
4.
bit more. This can all be done under with Sass media query mixins again:
         .jumbotron {
           .container {
            .welcome-message {
             right: 0;
              @include media-breakpoint-up(lg) {
                right: 50%;
             }
            }
          }
        }
Again, save the file, and take a look in your browser. You should see the
5.
following result in a large viewport:

Mission accomplished!
Our customized jumbotron is finished, providing the large welcome message our client has
asked for, including the ability to adapt to tablet- and phone-sized viewports, which we've
accomplished efficiently with a mobile-first approach.
Now we're ready to move on to the features list.
Beautifying the features list
We need to enlarge the icons, align the text at the center, and iron out the grid layout. Let's
review the markup structure for the features list:
<section id="features">
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Features</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="features-item col-md-4">
        <span class="icon fa fa-cloud"></span>
        <h2>Feature 1</h2>
        <p>Donec id elit non mi porta gravida at eget metus. Fusce
dapibus, tellus ac cursus commodo. </p>
      </div>
   ...
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 321 ]
Each feature with its icon, heading, and paragraph is wrapped in a div tag with two
classes: features-item and col-md-4.
With this in mind, let's write the styles we need:
Create scss/includes/_features.scss, a new Sass partial, and do not forget
1.
to import it in the scss/app.scss file:
        @import "includes/navbar";
        @import "includes/jumbotron";
        @import "includes/features";
With scss/includes/_features.scss opened in your editor, add a new
2.
section with a comment for our #features section:
       // Features Section
       #features {
        }
Now let's focus on the .features-item section by aligning the text at the center,
3.
adding padding, providing a set height to keep the floating items from
interfering with each other, and increasing the .icon font size to 90px:
         #features {
           .features-item {
            text-align: center;
            padding: 20px;
            height: 270px;
            .icon {
               font-size: 90px;
            }
             }
        }
Save the file, and test the results in your browser. Run the bootstrap watch
4.
command first, if you haven't already done so. You should see the following
result in a medium viewport:

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 322 ]
That's a great start! Now let's adapt our features section for small screens.
5.
Currently, our .features-item section includes a class of col-md-4. We can
shift our small-screen layout to two columns, as shown in the following
screenshot, by adding a class of col-sm-6:
And then, of course, they'll arrange themselves in a single column for extra-small
6.
screens.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 323 ]
Unfortunately, at the upper range of extra-small screens, 500px to 767px, the full-
7.
width layout allows the descriptive text to range too wide.
We can fix this by adding a media query within which we set a maximum width
8.
on the .features-item section and center the content by setting the horizontal
margins to auto:
         // Features Section
         #features {
            @include media-breakpoint-only(xs) {
             margin: 0 auto;
             max-width: 320px;
             }
           }
         }
Bootstrap also includes a  m-x-auto class for horizontally centering fixed-width
9.
block level content. The  m-x-auto class replaces the center-block class and mixin
from Bootstrap 3.
With these lines in place, our .features-item elements retain their desired
10.
dimensions across all viewports! On small viewports, our features will look like
this:
At this point, we have satisfied our client's demands for this section of her
11.
website! We're ready to move on to the customer reviews.

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 324 ]
Tackling customer reviews
Our next section, named Impact, presents reviews from happy customers. In this section,
we see smiling faces of happy customers with excerpts from their commentary about our
client's product.
We'll use the Card module for this section again. As already described in Chapter 4,
Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme, the Card module is a flexible and extensible content
container which replaces the panels, thumbnails, and wells used in earlier versions of
Bootstrap.
Another application of the Card module can be found in Chapter 7, Bootstrappin' E-
commerce.
In Chapter 4, Bootstrappin' a WordPress Theme, you used the Card module to create the
masonry grid layout. A masonry grid layout works by placing elements in optimal position
based on available vertical space, sort of like a mason fitting stones in a wall. You'll create a
Masonry grid layout for the Impact section again. The Bootstrap masonry solution uses CSS
only. If you need a JavaScript solution which works in older browsers too, you can use a
JavaScript masonry plugin available at h t t p : / / m a s o n r y . d e s a n d r o . c o m.
The Card columns use the CSS multi-column layout; you can read more about it at the
following URL: h t t p s : / / d e v e l o p e r . m o z i l l a . o r g / e n - U S / d o c s / W e b / C S S / C S S _ C o l u m n s / U s
i n g _ m u l t i - c o l u m n _ l a y o u t s.
The masonry grid layout is not available in IE9 and below as they have no support for the
column-* CSS properties.
So the initial markup starts as follows:
<!-- IMPACT SECTION -->
   <section id="impact">
   <div class="container">
         <h1>Impact</h1>
   <div class="reviews card-columns">
Each review is marked up as follows using the hreview microformat:
Microformats are an extension of HTML to mark up things such as people,
organizations, products, and reviews. Sites using microformats publish a
standard API, which can be consumed by search engines, browsers, and 
other tools. h-review is a simple, open format for publishing reviews on
the Web. More information can be found at the following URL: h t t p : / / m i
c r o f o r m a t s . o r g /.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 325 ]
            <div class="hreview review-item-1 card">
              <img class="card-img img-fluid" src="{{root}}images/smiling1-
by-RomainGuy-600x900.jpg" alt="Customer Photo1">
              <div class="caption card-img-overlay">
                <blockquote class="description card-img-overlayquote">

elit. Proin euismod, nulla pretium commodo ultricies</p>
                  <footer>Smiling Customer1</footer>
                </blockquote>
              </div>
            </div>
Each card image gets the img-fluid class to make the image responsive and fit the cards.
The class turns an image into a card background and overlays the card's text by setting the
position property of the image to absolute and the card's position property to relative.
Each card (having the card class) will be automatically arranged in the grid due to the card-
columns class of the selector.
The card-columns class creates CSS columns for the small grid and up by default. On the
extra-small grid, the grid item will stack. Use the following SCSS code in the
scss/includes/_impact.scss file for two columns on the small grid:
.card-columns {
  column-gap: $card-columns-sm-up-column-gap;
  @include media-breakpoint-up(sm) {
    column-count: 2;
  }
  @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    column-count: 3;
  }
  > .card {
    // see:
https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/18255#issuecomment-237034763
    display: block;
  }
}

Save your modifications and run the bootstrap watch command. You'll find that the
Impact section should now look like the following screenshot:
Both in terms of semantics and presentational starting points, we're off to a good start.
Because we wanted to arrive at a masonry layout, our images are a mixture of portrait and
landscape aspect ratios. We've made them all of equal width in order to provide enough
room for bright faces and textual overlays with short laudatory statements.
Before addressing the layout for larger viewports, let's start by tackling captions.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 327 ]
Positioning and styling captions
Let's begin by positioning our captions as overlays on top of their respective customer
photos:
While editing the scss/includes/_impact.scss file, add a new comment and
1.
selector for the #impact section:
         // Impact Section
         #impact {
         }
Now, we can work on the captions. We'll add a translucent background and
2.
position them as absolute at the bottom of each image:
        .hreview {
          .caption {
            position: absolute;
             top: auto;
             left: 10px;
             right: 10px;
            bottom: 0;
            line-height: 1.1;
            background: hsla(0,0,10%,0.55);
          }
Now we can focus on the review text and specify the margin, border, font family,
3.
font size, and color:
          blockquote {
            margin-top: 4px;
            border: none;
             font-family: @font-family-serif;
             font-size: @font-size-large;
               color: #fff;
          }
Next, specify styles for the reviewer's name, which appears below the review
4.
text:
          .reviewer {
             margin-top: 2px;
             margin-bottom: 4px;
             text-align: right;
            color: $gray-lighter;
           }

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 328 ]
Save the file, run the bootstrap watch command, and check your progress.
5.
You should end up with an Impact section like that shown in the following
6.
screenshot:
Not bad! However, we can do it one step better.
Refining the caption position
Looking carefully at the available open space in the preceding screenshots and examining
the overlap variations at various viewport widths in your responsive grid, you may want to
position each caption in a way that works best for each customer's photo.
This is where the review-item-1, review-item-2, and so on classes become relevant and
helpful, as we may use these specific classes to position each caption in a way that fits best
with its image.
To demonstrate the positions of the caption, I've added the following lines in the
scss/includes/_impact.scss file:
  .hreview:nth-child(2n) .caption {
    top: 0;
    left: 62%;
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 329 ]
    right: 10px;
    bottom: auto;
    .reviewer {
      margin-top: 6px;
      text-align: left;
    }
  }
  .hreview:nth-child(3n) .caption {
    top: 0;
    left: 17%;
    right: 10px;
    bottom: auto;
  }
The preceding markup adjusts the absolute positioning of each second and third caption,
which yields the results shown in the following screenshot:
Instead of using the :nth-child() selectors in the above, you can also write your own
SCSS to position each specific caption.

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 330 ]
Adjusting for tiny screens
On the extra-small grid, the reviews are stacked, and on the small grid we'll arrange them in
two columns.
First, we'll reduce the font size of the captions for the small grid. To reduce the font size,
insert the following SCSS code into the scss/includes/_impact.scss file:
#impact {
  .caption {
    blockquote {
      font-size: $font-size-sm;
      @include media-breakpoint-only(sm) {
        font-size: $font-size-lg;
      }
    }
  }
}
On the small and extra-small grid, we'll only show the first four reviews. Hide the last
reviews by default by using the following SCSS code:
// Impact Section
#impact {
 .hreview:nth-child(5), .hreview:nth-child(6) {
   display: none;
   @include media-breakpoint-only(md) {
     display: block;
   }
 }
}
Save the file and then test the results in your browser.
Voilà! The customer reviews are now performing entirely in line with our client's desires.
Now to take care of the last major item in our client's desired home page design: the pricing
tables.

Creating attention-grabbing pricing tables
Let's revisit the mockup of how our client would like the pricing tables to look on desktop-
sized screens:
Let's see how close we can get to the desired result, and what we can work out for other
viewport sizes.
Setting up the variables, files, and markup
As shown in the preceding screenshot, there are a few tables in this design. We can begin by
adjusting a few fundamental variables for all tables. These are found in Bootstrap's
_variables.scss file. Search for the tables section and adjust the variables for
background, accented rows, and borders as desired. I've made these adjustments as shown
in the following lines of code, and saved them in the local
scss/includes/_variables.scss file:
// Tables
//
// Customizes the `.table` component with basic values, each used across
all table variations.

$table-bg-accent:              hsla(0,0,1%,.1); // for striping
$table-bg-hover:                hsla(0,0,1%,.2);
$table-bg-active:               $table-bg-hover;
$table-border-width:           1px;
$table-border-color:            $gray-lighter;
Save the file, and run the bootstrap watch command to see the result as shown in the
following screenshot:
That's a start. Now we need to write more specific styles.
To carry the custom styles, let's create a new Sass file for these pricing tables:
Create _pricing-tables.scss in the main scss/includes folder.
1.
Import it into main.scss just after the import of the _impact.scss file
2.
as shown in the following line:
    @import "_pricing-tables";
Open _pricing-tables.less in your editor and begin writing your new styles.
3.

[ 333 ]
But before we begin writing styles, let's review the markup that we'll be working with.
We have the following special classes already provided in the markup on the parent
element of each respective table:
package package-basic
package package-premium
package package-pro
Thus, for the first table, you'll see the following markup on its parent div:
<div class="package package-basic col-lg-4">
   <table class="table table-striped">
...
Notice that the table and table-striped classes in the above HTML code are part of
Bootstrap's styles to display content. You can use these styles by just adding the table base
class to any <table> element, Extend the base class with custom styles or by including a
modifier class such as the table-striped class. Read more about tables in Bootstrap at
the following URL: h t t p : / / g e t b o o t s t r a p . c o m / c o n t e n t / t a b l e s / h t t p : / / v 4 - a l p h a . g e t b o
o t s t r a p . c o m / c o n t e n t / t a b l e s /.
Similarly, we'll use package package-premium and package package-pro for the
second and third tables, respectively.
These parent containers obviously also provide basic layout instructions using the col-
md-4 class to set up a three-column layout in medium viewports and up.
Next, we will observe the markup for each table. We see that the basic table and table-
striped classes have been applied:
<table class="table table-striped">
The table uses the <thead> element for its topmost block. Within this, there is <th>
spanning two columns, with an <h2> heading for the package name and <div
class="price"> to mark up the dollar amount:
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">
        <h2>Basic Plan</h2>
        <div class="price">$19</div>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

[ 334 ]
Next is the tfoot tag with the Sign up now! button:
  <tfoot>
    <tr><td colspan="2"><a href="#" class="btn">Sign up
now!</a></td></tr>
  </tfoot>
Then there is the tbody tag with the list of features laid out in a straightforward manner in
rows with two columns:
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Feature</td><td>Name</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Feature</td><td>Name</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Feature</td><td>Name</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Feature</td><td>Name</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Feature</td><td>Name</td></tr>
  </tbody>
And finally, of course, the closing tags for the table and parent div tags:
  </table>
</div><!-- /.package .package-basic -->
Each table repeats this basic structure. This gives us what we need to start work!
Beautifying the table head
To beautify the thead element of all of our tables, we'll do the following:
Align the text at the center
Add a background color; for now, add a gray color that is approximately a
midtone similar to the colors we'll apply to the final version
Turn the font color white
Convert the h2 heading to uppercase
Increase the size of the price table
Add the necessary padding all around the tables
We can apply many of these touches with the following lines of SCSS code. We'll specify the
#signup section as the context for these special table styles:
#signup {
  table {
    border: 1px solid $table-border-color;
    thead th {
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 335 ]
      text-align: center;
      background-color: $gray-light;
      color: #fff;
      padding: 2 * $spacer-y 0;
      h2 {
        text-transform: uppercase;
        font-size: 2em;
      }
    }
  }
}
In short, we've accomplished everything except increasing the size of the price tables. We
can get started on this by adding the following lines of code, which are still nested within
our #signup table selector:
.price {
      font-size: 4em;
      line-height: 1;
}
This yields the following result:
This is close to our desired result, but we need to decrease the size of the dollar sign. We can
nest the first letter within our styles for .price:
  .price {
    font-size: 4em;
    line-height: 1;
    &::first-letter {
      font-size: .5em;
      vertical-align: super;
    }
  }
::first-letter is a pseudo element, which allows you to style the first letter in an
element without needing to stick a <span> tag around that first letter in your HTML. You
can read more about this pseudo element at the following URL: h t t p s : / / c s s - t r i c k s . c o m /
a l m a n a c / s e l e c t o r s / f / f i r s t - l e t t e r /.

[ 336 ]
These lines reduce the dollar sign to half its size and align it at the top. The following
screenshot shows the result:
Styling the table body and foot
Continuing to focus on the styles that apply to all three pricing tables, let's make the
following adjustments:
Add left and right padding to the list of features
Stretch the button to full width
Increase the button size
We can accomplish this by adding the following rules:
#signup {
  table {
    tbody {
      td {
        padding-left: $spacer-x;
        padding-right: $spacer-x;
      }
    }
    a.btn {
      @extend .btn-lg;
      font-size: 1.25em;
      display: block;
      width: 100%;
      background-color: $gray-light;
      color: #fff;
    }
  }
}
In the preceding SCSS code, the @extend feature of Sass has been used to extend the button
with Bootstrap's styles for large buttons. Bootstrap itself avoids the @extend feature, but
you can use it.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 337 ]
Alternatively, you can use Bootsstrap's button-size() mixin to set the
large button styles.
You can read a little more about the @extend feature of Sass in Chapter 1,
Getting Started with Bootstrap.
Notice that I have set font-size: 1.25em; afterward. The button mixin sets
the font size in rem units and we want the font size to scale with its parent.
Save the file, run the bootstrap watch command, and you should see the following
result:
We're now ready to add styles to differentiate our three packages.
Differentiating the packages
Let's begin by giving each package the desired color for the table head and the Sign up
now! button. Our provided mockup uses blue for the Basic, green for the Premium, and red
for the Pro packages. Let's prepare our color scheme by using the chosen color values in
new variables for primary, secondary, and tertiary brand colors, as shown in the following
lines of code:
$brand-primary:             #428bca;
$brand-secondary:           #5cb85c;
$brand-tertiary:            #d9534f;

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 338 ]
Having set up these colors, we can efficiently apply them to the appropriate thead and
button elements. We'll use the distinctive class that we applied earlier to each table's
parent element, that is, package-basic, package-premium, and package-pro:
In the scss/includes/_pricing-tables.scss file, begin a new section with a
1.
comment:
            // Pricing Table Colors
We'll apply the primary brand color to the .package-basic table using the
2.
$brand-primary variable; we'll try it first on the thead th element:
        #signup .package-basic table {
         thead th {
            background-color: $brand-primary;
         }
Then, apply the primary brand color to the thead th element's button. Here,
3.
we'll use the .button-variant() mixin from the bootstrap/mixins.less
file to efficiently apply styles to the :hover and :active states. The mixin takes
three parameters: color, background color, and border color. We'll define them as
follows:
          ...
          .btn {
            @include button-variant(#fff, $brand-primary, darken($brand-
primary, 5%));
          }
         }
When compiled, this concise mixin will generate styles for the button and its
4.
hover and active states!
For a reminder of how the button-variant() mixin works, consult the
bootstrap/scss/mixins/_buttons.scss file, where the mixin is
defined, and then bootstrap/scss/_buttons.scss, where it is used to
define the default Bootstrap button classes.
www.ebook3000.com

[ 339 ]
Now we need to repeat this for our .package-premium table; this time,
5.
however, use the $brand-secondary variable:
         #signup .package-premium table {
          thead th {
            background-color: $brand-secondary;
           }
          .btn {
             @include button-variant(#fff, $brand-secondary, darken($brand-
secondary,
             5%));
           }
         }
Finally, we'll apply the tertiary brand color to the .package-pro table using the
6.
$brand-tertiary variable:
         #signup .package-pro table {
          thead th {
             background-color: $brand-tertiary;
           }
          .btn {
            @include button-variant(#fff, $brand-tertiary, darken($brand-
tertiary,
            5%));
           }
          }
You might have noticed that the preceding steps and code are very repetitive.
7.
Sass can help you to code your CSS code DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself). By
wrapping the names in a Sass map and using an @each loop, you'll have to write
the code only once.
You can also read my Sass and Compass Designer's Cookbook to learn how to

run it. You should see the new colors we applied to our tables:

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 340 ]
Nice!
Now let's check how our tables respond to various viewport widths.
Adjusting for small viewports
Thanks to the attention Bootstrap gives to responsive design, our tables perform quite well
across viewport breakpoints. We've already seen how our tables fare in the medium
breakpoint range. In large screens, the tables expand wider. In narrow viewports, the tables
stack up vertically, quite nicely.
However, there is an awkward range of width approximately between 480px and 768px,
where the tables expand to fill the full width of the screen. Clearly, they become too wide.
Because we have three tables, there is no benefit involved in having a two-column layout at
this dimension. Instead, let's constrain the width of our tables and align them at the center
with auto left and right margins. We'll use the media-breakpoint-down() media query
mixin to set 400px as our maximum width, and set the horizontal margins to auto to keep
our tables at the center of the window:
//
// Constrain width for small screens and under
// ------------------------------------------
@include media-breakpoint-down(sm) {
  #signup .package {
      max-width: 400px;
      margin: 0 auto;
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 341 ]
    }
}
You cannot center the tables by using the @extend feature of Sass to extend the .m-x-auto
class, because you may not @extend an outer selector from within @media.
On the medium grid, the tables are too wide for the grid columns, so we reduce the total
font size for only the medium grid by using the following SCSS code:
#signup {
  font-size: 100%;
  @include media-breakpoint-only(md) {
    font-size: 70%;
  }
}
Save the file, and test the results in your browser. You should see nicely constrained tables
aligned at the center within the window! The following screenshot shows our result:
At this point, our tables are differentiated by color and are responsive. However, one last
step remains. In the medium and large viewport widths, we want the premium plan to
stand out.
Providing a visual hierarchy to our tables
If we look back at the mockup, we see that the design – at least for desktop-sized viewports
– calls for visual emphasis on the central Premium plan by increasing its size and bringing it
visually into the foreground.
This can be accomplished with some adjustments to padding, margins, and font sizes. We'll
do this within a media query for medium viewports and up:
//
// Visually enhance the premium plan
// ------------------------------------------
@include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
}
Our first aim is to bring the tables closer to one another. This can be done by removing the
padding (the gutter of the grid) between the grid columns:

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 342 ]
#signup {
  // Squeeze tables together
  .col-md-4 {
    padding: 0;
  }
}
Then we can enlarge the font size for the price information in the premium block as follows:
#signup {
  .package-premium .price {
    font-size: 7em;
  }
}
Nested within this media query, we can first reduce the widths of our basic and pro tables
(the first and third) and add a little margin to the top to push them down a bit:
  // Size down the basic and pro
  #signup .package-basic {
    padding-left: 4 * $spacer-y;
  }
  #signup .package-pro {
    padding-right: 4 * $spacer-y;
  }
  #signup .package-basic table,
  #signup .package-pro table {
    margin-top: 3 * $spacer-x;
  }
Next, let's enhance the font size of our premium table and add padding to its button:
  // Size up the premium
  #signup .package-premium table {
    thead th {
      h2 {
        font-size: 2.5em;
      }
    }
    a.btn {
      font-size: 2em;
      padding-top: 1.5 * $spacer-x;
      padding-bottom: 1.5 * $spacer-x;
    }
  }

Save the file, and inspect the results in the browser. You should see the following result in
large viewports of 1,200px and above:
That's it! We've accomplished the last major challenge in our client's design. Now let's tidy
things up by applying those little touches that hold it all together.
Adding the final touches
In this section, we will enhance the details that hold our design together. First, we'll
enhance the h1 headings for each of our major sections and add some needed top and
bottom padding to each section. Then, we'll enhance the navigation experience by adding
ScrollSpy to the navbar and using jQuery to animate the scrolling action when triggered by
a click on the navbar item.
Let's begin by enhancing the size and contrast of our major h1 headings for each section and
increasing the top and bottom padding. If you pause to look at these h1 headings, you may
note that they are rather lackluster.

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 344 ]
Enlarging these headings, bringing the contrast down a little, and providing extra padding
will make a big difference. We only want these rules to apply to the Features, Impact, and
Sign up sections. We will select these by ID:
Open the scss/includes/_page-contents.scss file again in your editor.
1.
At the top of the file, after the rule applying top padding to the body, add the
2.
following lines:
      #features, #impact, #signup {
        padding-top: $spacer-y * 2.5;
        padding-bottom: $spacer-y * 3;
        h1 {
          font-size: 5em;
          color: $gray;
          line-height: 1.3;
          padding-bottom: $spacer-y * 1.5;
       }
      }
Here, we've done the following:
3.
Added top and bottom padding to these sections
Significantly increased the size of the h1 heading
Reduced the heavy contrast of that heading
Ensured that the heading has room to breathe by setting the line height and
bottom padding
Save your work and notice the difference in your browser:

This yields a nice result across almost all viewport sizes. For small viewports, the h1 font
size is now a bit large. So, let's adjust this. As we do not want these styles to flow up to
larger viewports, we'll wrap the styles we have already written in a query by limiting them
to larger viewports. Finally, the refactored and mobile-first SCSS code should look like this:
#features, #impact, #signup {
  padding-top: $spacer-y * 1.5;
  padding-bottom: $spacer-y * 1;
  h1 {
    font-size: 3em;
    color: $gray;
    line-height: 1.3;
    padding-bottom: $spacer-y;
  }
  @include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    padding-top: $spacer-y * 2.5;
    padding-bottom: $spacer-y * 3;
    h1 {
      font-size: 5em;
      padding-bottom: $spacer-y * 1.5;
    }
  }
}
The following screenshot shows our result:
This is a much improved result! Now we'll enhance the navigation experience.

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 346 ]
Adding ScrollSpy to the navbar
Let's configure our top navbar to indicate our location on the page. We'll add Bootstrap's
ScrollSpy behavior to the navbar.
Refer to Bootstrap's ScrollSpy plugin documentation at
http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy.
By default, the ScrollSpy plugin requires a Bootstrap nav component. Bootstrap's navbar
contains a nav component already. The relative position is required too. You should set
position:relative; in your CSS for the element you're spying on. In our situation, we'll have
to set the relative position for the body element.
You can easily initiate the ScrollSpy plugin by adding data-attributes in the HTML code.
First add data-spy=”scroll” to the element you want to spy and then add the data-target
attribute with the ID or class of the parent element of any Bootstrap .nav component.
Data-attributes in HTML5 allow use to store extra information into
standard semantic HTML elements. Read more about data-attributes in
HTML5 at the following URL: h t t p s : / / d e v e l o p e r . m o z i l l a . o r g / e n - U S /
d o c s / W e b / G u i d e / H T M L / U s i n g _ d a t a _ a t t r i b u t e s.
ScrollSpy requires a resolvable ID target in our HTML code. We've already added the target
in the preceding steps. For instance, the Intro section had id="welcome" in the section
element as follows:
    <section class="jumbotron" id="welcome">
The above HTML code can be found in the html/includes/intro.html file. The
id="welcome" declaration corresponds with the resolvable id targets in the navbar links,
as can be seen in the html/includes/page-header.html file. The HTML code of the
Welcome should look as follows now:
        <a class="nav-link active" href="#welcome">Welcome <span class="sr-
only">(current)</span></a>
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 347 ]
Now perform the following steps to initiate the ScrollSpy plugin in our project:
Edit the scss/app.scss file to set the relative position of the body element. Add
1.
the following SCSS code at the end of this file:
      body {
        position: relative;
      }
Then open index.html in your editor.
2.
Add these ScrollSpy data-attributes to the body tag:
3.
      <body data-spy="scroll" data-target=".navbar">
Edit the file and set the resolvable ID targets in the navbar links. At the end, your
4.
HTML code should look like this:
    <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link active" href="#welcome">Welcome <span
            class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#features">Features</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#impact">Impact</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#signup">Sign up</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 348 ]
With the resolvable id targets and the new data-attributes in place, save the
file, refresh your browser, and scroll up and down the page. You should see
your main navigation respond as it should, indicating your position on the
page as shown in the following screenshot:
In the preceding step, we used data-attributes to initiate Bootstrap ScrollSpy behavior. You
can also initiate the plugin via JavaScript by performing the following steps:
First add the position: relative; declaration for the body element in your
1.
CSS/SCSS:
      body {
        position: relative;
      }
Then call the ScrollSpy via JavaScript/jQuery as follows:
2.
       $('body').scrollspy({ target: '.navbar' })
Animating the scroll
Now let's animate the page scrolls that will be triggered by clicking on the navbar page
anchors. We'll use jQuery to accomplish this.
www.ebook3000.com

Bootstrappin' a One-Page Marketing Website
[ 349 ]
jQuery is a JavaScript library and provides you with an API for HTML
document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animations.
The jQuery animate() API call lets you create custom animations of
CSS properties. You can read more about jQuery's animations at the
following URL: h t t p : / / a p i . j q u e r y . c o m / a n i m a t e /.
Animating the page scroll requires adding a few lines to our main.js file:
Open js/main.js.
1.
Add the following lines within $(document).ready(function() {:
2.
      $('#nav-main [href^=#]').click(function (e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        var div = $(this).attr('href');
        $("html, body").animate({
        scrollTop: $(div).position().top
       }, "slow");
     });
Save the file and refresh your browser.
3.
What have we done here? We have done the following using the power of jQuery:
Selected the links in our .navbar element that use page anchors as their targets
and set a click event on them:
      $('#nav-main [href^=#]').click(function (e) {}
Prevented the default click behavior as follows:
       e.preventDefault();
Animated the scrolling behavior, setting its duration to slow as shown in the
following snippet:
       $("html, body").animate({
           scrollTop: $(div).position().top
       }, "slow");
Click on one of the nav items and you should see it animate the scroll!

Summary
Take a moment to scroll back and forth through our page, appreciating its details and
resizing it to see how it adjusts to viewport dimensions.
When we consider the variety of features packed into this page – and that they all work
responsively across desktop-, tablet-, and phone-sized viewports – it's not a bad
accomplishment!
To recap, we have given our client a beautiful, one-page marketing site with a large
welcome section using Bootstrap's jumbotron styles, a bold background image, and
responsive customizations, a features list making use of large-sized Font Awesome icons, a
section of customer reviews with images and captions laid out in the masonry format,
which adapts beautifully across viewports. We ended up with a signup section with
custom-designed pricing tables built on Bootstrap styles and enhanced further to provide a
visual hierarchy for medium and large viewports. As a finishing touch, we added a
ScrollSpy-equipped navbar with animated scrolling behavior provided by a bit of extra
jQuery. With this design, we have reached a point where there is nothing we can't do with
Bootstrap.
Across this and previous projects, we have accomplished a great deal. We have learned the
ins and outs of Bootstrap, and folded Bootstrap Sass and JavaScript into our own custom set
of project files. We then used the robust Font Awesome icons. We also tweaked,
customized, and otherwise innovated on Bootstrap styles to arrive the exact results we were
seeking.

Get introduced to some other build tools to deploy your Bootstrap 4 project
Overview
You can use Angular to build single page applications (SPAs) and rich web applications.
Angular implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) in JavaScript and HTML. The
MVC is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical
components: the model, the view, and the controller. Data–binding in Angular apps is the
automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components.

Angular's HTML compiler can attach a specified behavior to a DOM element. An Angular
directive is a marker on a DOM element that tells the compiler what to attach or how to
transform it.
Angular contains a built-in subset of jQuery, called jQuery lite or jqLite, which means that
you should not use jQuery in your Angular apps. Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins require
jQuery and so cannot, or should not, be used in your Angular apps.
Angular directives for Bootstrap can replace Bootstrap's plugins and enable you to use
Bootstrap components in your Angular apps. You can use Bootstrap's CSS code, and even
load it from CDN, together with these directives.
Setting up your first Angular app
Angular 2 is the successor of AngularJS. Those who are already familiar with Angular 2
may possibly skip this section. More information about Angular 2 can be found at the
official website at the following URL: h t t p s : / / a n g u l a r . i o /. On this website, you'll find a
Getting Started section, which includes a 5 MIN QuickStart guidance and a Tour of Heroes
Tutorial!.
As this book is about Bootstrap, I won't discuss Angular 2 in detail,
although I highly recommend you to try the QuickStart and tutorial before
reading further.
We'll reuse the source code of the 5 MIN QuickStart guidance to build our own Angular 2
website with Bootstrap.
You can write Angular 2 apps in TypeScript, Dart, and JavaScript. In this
book, I've used TypeScript.
TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed
and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict superset of JavaScript, and adds
optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the
language. TypeScript compiles to clean, simple JavaScript code which runs
on any browser, in Node.js, or in any JavaScript engine that supports
ECMAScript 3 (or newer).
You can read more about TypeScript at the following URL: h t t p s : / / w w w .
t y p e s c r i p t l a n g . o r g /.
To start, run the following command in your console:
git clone  https://github.com/angular/quickstart start

Git is a version-vcontrol system that is used for software development
and other version control tasks. The source code of the 5 MIN
QuickStart guide is available for free at GitHub. GitHUB is a web-based
Git repository hosting service.
The preceding command copies the source code of the 5 MIN QuickStart guide into a new
folder called start. Navigate into the new folder and run the following command:
npm install && npm start
The preceding command creates a super-simple Angular 2 application in TypeScript. We'll
use this application to create our own project. After running the npm start command, the
TypeScript compiler and lite-server are watch for file changes. They should detect the
change, recompile the TypeScript into JavaScript, and refresh the browser.
Without any modifications, the app should run in your browser at
http://localhost:3000. Your browser screen should look like the following screenshot:
Now we can rebuild the app into a simple website with four pages.
Adding routing to our app
To learn more about routing in Angular 2, and for better understanding of the coming steps,
you can visit the following URL: h t t p s : / / a n g u l a r . i o / d o c s / t s / l a t e s t / t u t o r i a l / t o h - p t
5 . h t m l.
Our simple website has the following pages: Home, Features, Pricing, and About. So we
have to create four new components (views). For the home page, create a file call in
home.component.ts in the app folder. The home.component.ts file should contain the
following TypeScript code:
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
@Component({
  selector: 'home',
  template: '<h3>Home</h3>'
})
export class HomeComponent {
}

Building an Angular 2 App with Bootstrap
[ 354 ]
Repeat the preceding steps for each page, and create the features, component.ts,
pricing.component.ts, and about.component.ts files too.
Then create a new app/app.routes.ts file, which should contain the following
TypeScript code:
import { provideRouter, RouterConfig }  from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home.component';
import { FeaturesComponent } from './features.component';
import { PricingComponent } from './pricing.component';
import { AboutComponent } from './about.component';
const routes: RouterConfig = [
  {
    path: 'home',
    component: HomeComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'features',
    component: FeaturesComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'pricing',
    component: PricingComponent
  },
  {
    path: 'about',
    component: AboutComponent
  },
  {
  path: '',
  redirectTo: '/home',
  pathMatch: 'full'
  }
];
export const appRouterProviders = [
  provideRouter(routes)
];
After the preceding changes, you should also add base tags into the index.html in the
root folder of your application. Open the index.html file in your editor and add the
following HTML code:
<head>
  <base href="/">
Now you can start editing the app/app.component.ts file.

[ 355 ]
Setting up navigation
The original app component (app/app.component.ts) should only handle navigation
now. So edit the app/app.component.ts file so that it contains the following TypeScript
code:
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { ROUTER_DIRECTIVES }  from '@angular/router';
@Component({
    selector: 'my-app',
    template: `<ul>
    <li><a [routerLink]="['/home']" routerLinkActive="active">Home</a></li>
    <li><a [routerLink]="['/features']"
routerLinkActive="active">Features</a></li>
    <li><a [routerLink]="['/pricing']"
routerLinkActive="active">Pricing</a></li>
    <li><a [routerLink]="['/about']"
routerLinkActive="active">About</a></li>
    </ul>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>`,
     directives: [ ROUTER_DIRECTIVES ]
    })
export class AppComponent { }
The router displays each component immediately below the <router-outlet> as we
navigate through the application.
Inspect the result in your browser and you'll find that it look like that shown in the
following screenshot:
You can click the links and will find that a new view is loaded when you do so. Now it's
time to add Bootstrap to our project!

Building an Angular 2 App with Bootstrap
[ 356 ]
Adding Bootstrap's HTML markup code to
your app
Open the app/app.component.ts file in your editor again. Replace the template metadata
with a templateUrl property that points to a new app/app.component.html template
file as follows:
@Component({
    selector: 'my-app',
     templateUrl: 'app/app.component.html',
     directives: [ ROUTER_DIRECTIVES ]
    })
Now we can add Bootstrap HTML markup to the app/app.component.html template file.
We replace the navigation list with a responsive navbar, and we add some containers and
other grid classes. We should end up with HTML code like the following:
    <div class="container">
     <div class="row">
       <h1>{{title}}</h1>
     </div>
    </div>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-light bg-faded">
      <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-sm-up" type="button" aria-
controls="exCollapsingNavbar2" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle
navigation">
        ☰
      </button>
      <div class="navbar-toggleable-xs">
      <div class="container">
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link active" [routerLink]="['/home']"
routerLinkActive="active">Home</a>
          </li>
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" [routerLink]="['/features']"
routerLinkActive="active">Features</a>
          </li>
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" [routerLink]="['/pricing']"
routerLinkActive="active">Pricing</a>
          </li>
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link" [routerLink]="['/about']"
routerLinkActive="active">About</a>

        </div>
    </footer>
You can read more about Bootstrap's navbar markup in Chapter 1, Getting Started with
Bootstrap.
Inspect the result in your browser again. You'll find that it now looks like that shown in the
following screenshot:
As you can see in the preceding screenshot, it does not look well yet. Bootstrap's CSS code is
not loaded into the application, so the HTML is not styled. In the next step, we'll add
Bootstrap's CSS code to the application.

Building an Angular 2 App with Bootstrap
[ 358 ]
Integrating Bootstrap's CSS code into the
application
Now we'll have to add Bootstrap's CSS code to our application. Of course ,we can simply
add a link to the CSS code on CDN in index.html, but doing that does not enable us to
profit from the underlying Sass code.
Each component in our app can have its own styles sheets. The main styles of our app are
loaded via the styles.css file in the root. We'll set up a build system that compiles
Bootstrap's SCSS code and our own modification into the styles.css file.
First, we install Bootstrap's source code via npm by running the following command:
npm install bootstrap --save-dev
Then we set up a similar file structure as we have done already in the preceding chapters of
this book:
scss/styles.scss
scss/includes/_bootstrap.sccs
scss/includes/_variables.sccs
The scss/_includes/_variables.scss file enables us to override Bootstrap's default
values and the scss/_includes/_bootstrap.scss file is a copy of the original
bootstrap.scss file. In the scss/_includes/_bootstrap.scss file each Bootstrap
component of the module is loaded separately, enabling us to comment out the parts we do
not need. Files are loaded from the source code in the node_modules folder, which is
possible by setting the includePath option to the node_modules folder for the Sass
compiler. We will set up the Sass compiler in the next section.
Setting up the Sass compiler
Run the following command in your console to set up the node-sass Sass compiler:
npm install node-sass --save-dev
The node-sass module compiles your Sass code with libSass. Note that Compass is not 
compatible with libSass. More information about the node-sass module can be found at the
following URL: h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / s a s s / n o d e - s a s s.
www.ebook3000.com

Building an Angular 2 App with Bootstrap
[ 359 ]
In Chapter 2, Creating Your Own Build Process with Gulp, you can read how to use node-sass
via gulp-sass in a Gulp build process.
Edit the package.json file of your project after installing node-sass and create a new entry
in the scripts property as follows:
 "compile-scss": "node-sass --output-style expanded --precision 6 --source-
comments false --source-map true --include-path node_modules -o . scss"
Now you can run the following command to compile scss/styles.scss into styles.css:
npm compile-scss
Add the compile-scss command to the start command in the file as follows:
"start": "npm run compile-scss & tsc && concurrently "tsc -w" "lite-server"
",
Now the scss/styles.scss files compiles into the styles.css file when we run the npm
start command. The start command did already run the tsc -w command, which
watches for file changes in the TypeScript files. The web server automatically reloads when
any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file changes. The CSS should also recompile when we change
one or more of the Sass files. We can use the Nodemon module to watch the .scss files.
Nodemon watches for file changes and can restart a program when this happens. You can
install Nodemon by running the following command in your console:
npm install nodemon --save-dev
Change the scripts property in your package.json file after installing Nodemon as follows:
"start": "concurrently "npm run watch-scss" & tsc && concurrently "tsc -w"
"lite-server" ", "watch-scss": "nodemon -e scss -x "npm run compile-scss"",
Notice that node-sass also has a built-in watch option, but we cannot
run the post-processors when using this option. We'll set up the post-
process in the next section.
Test your new commands; first run the npm start command, then
change and save your scss/styles.scss file. After saving the
scss/styles.scss file, the Sass compiler should start and your browser
windows should automatically reload.

Building an Angular 2 App with Bootstrap
[ 360 ]
Adding the post-processors
As you know the postcss autoprefixer post-processor is required to compile
Bootstrap's Sass code into CSS. By default, Bootstrap also runs the postcss-flexbugs-
fixes post processor.
The postcss-flexbugs-fixes post processor tries to fix browser
bugs for the Flexbox Layout. More information can be found at: h t t p s : / /
g i t h u b . c o m / l u i s r u d g e / p o s t c s s - f l e x b u g s - f i x e s.
First we have to install postcss and the post-processors by running the following command
in your console:
npm install postcss-cli autoprefixer postcss-flexbugs-fixes --save-dev
After installing this module, we can simply reuse Bootstrap's post process settings. Add the
following entry to the scripts property of your package.json file:
"postcss": "postcss --config node_modules/bootstrap/grunt/postcss.js --
replace styles.css"
Then we add a new command, which runs the post-processor after the Sass compiler as
follows:
"build:css" : "npm run compile-scss && npm run postcss"
Do not forget to change the watch-scss command too, because nodemon should execute the
build:css command now:
    "watch-scss": "nodemon -e scss -x "npm run build:css""
Finally, the scripts property in the package.json file should look like the following:
  "scripts": {
    "start": "concurrently "npm run watch-scss" & tsc && concurrently "tsc
-w" "lite-server" ",
    "docker-build": "docker build -t ng2-quickstart .",
    "docker": "npm run docker-build && docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -p
3001:3001 ng2-quickstart",
    "pree2e": "npm run webdriver:update",
    "e2e": "tsc && concurrently "http-server -s" "protractor
protractor.config.js" --kill-others --success first",
    "lint": "tslint ./app/**/*.ts -t verbose",
    "lite": "lite-server",
    "postinstall": "typings install",

    "test": "tsc && concurrently "tsc -w" "karma start karma.conf.js"",
    "test-once": "tsc && karma start karma.conf.js --single-run",
    "tsc": "tsc",
    "tsc:w": "tsc -w",
    "typings": "typings",
    "webdriver:update": "webdriver-manager update",
    "build:css": "npm run compile-scss && npm run postcss",

    "compile-scss": "node-sass --output-style expanded --precision 6 --
source-comments false --source-map true --include-path node_modules -o .
scss"
  },
And at the end, the result of your work should look like that shown in the following
screenshot:
Using the ng-bootstrap directives
Resize your browser window and make sure that the width of the viewport becomes
smaller than 768 pixels. You will find that your navbar stacks like that shown in the
following screenshot:
The hamburger menu button, which should open the menu, does not work. The menu button
requires the Bootstrap JavaScript Collapse plugin. As discussed before, we can't use
Bootstrap JavaScript plugins and should replace them with Angular directives.

Building an Angular 2 App with Bootstrap
[ 362 ]
Remember that Angular directives are markers on DOM elements that tell the compiler
what to attach or how to transform it.
We can use the ng-bootstrap directives to replace the Bootstrap jQuery plugins. More
information about the ng-bootstrap directives can be found at the following URL:  h t t p s : / /
n g - b o o t s t r a p . g i t h u b . i o /.
Use the following steps to integrate the ng-bootstrap directives into your project.
First install the ng-bootstrap directives by running the following command in your console:
    npm install @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap --save-dev
Then open the angular-cli-build.js file in the root folder of your project and add the
following lines into it:
      // map tells the System loader where to look for things
      var map = {
        'app':                        'app', // 'dist',
        '@angular':                   'node_modules/@angular',
        'angular2-in-memory-web-api': 'node_modules/angular2-in-memory-web-
api',
        'rxjs':                       'node_modules/rxjs',
       '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap': 'node_modules/@ng-bootstrap/ng-
bootstrap'
      };
      // packages tells the System loader how to load when no filename
and/or no extension
      var packages = {
        'app':                        { main: 'main.js',  defaultExtension:
'js' },
        'rxjs':                       { defaultExtension: 'js' },
        'angular2-in-memory-web-api': { main: 'index.js', defaultExtension:
'js' },
        '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap': { defaultExtension: 'js', main:
'index.js' }
      };
In subsequent steps, we'll change the app component and its HTML template. First edit the
app.components.ts file, so that its TypeScript code looks like that shown here:
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    import { ROUTER_DIRECTIVES }  from '@angular/router';
      import {NGB_COLLAPSE_DIRECTIVES} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';
    @Component({
        selector: 'my-app',
         templateUrl: 'app/app.component.html',
www.ebook3000.com

Building an Angular 2 App with Bootstrap
[ 363 ]
         directives: [ ROUTER_DIRECTIVES, NGB_COLLAPSE_DIRECTIVES]
        })
    export class AppComponent {
      title = 'Your Business';
      private isCollapsed = true;
    }
As you can see, in the above we've made the Collapse directive available for the component.
Now change the HTML code in the app.components.html the file according to this change:
          <button class="navbar-toggler hidden-sm-up" type="button"
(click)="isCollapsed = !isCollapsed"  aria-expanded="false" aria-
label="Toggle navigation">
            ☰
          </button>
          <div class="navbar-toggleable-xs" [ngbCollapse]="isCollapsed">
Run the  npm start command and inspect the result in your browser. You'll find that the
hamburger menu in the small viewports works as expected now.
Now the skeleton for your Angular 2 website is ready. You have learned how to integrate
Bootstrap in an Angular 2 project.
Using other directives
The list of directives at the ng-bootstrap website does not contain a directive for each
Bootstrap component yet. On the other hand, some of the directives are not available as
Bootstrap components, but are only available as ng-bootstrap directives.
The rating component is an example of a component which is only available in ng-
bootstrap. To use the rating component in your project use the following steps.
Open the home.componet.ts in your editor. Add the directive and required HTML code
for the rating, component. Take a look at for some example code. At the end, the TypeScript
code should look like the following:
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    import {NGB_RATING_DIRECTIVES} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';
    @Component({
      selector: 'home',
      template: `<h3>Home</h3>
        <ngb-rating [(rate)]="currentRate"></ngb-rating>
      <hr>
      <pre>Rate: <b>{{currentRate}}</b></pre>`,
      directives: [NGB_RATING_DIRECTIVES]
      })

Building an Angular 2 App with Bootstrap
[ 364 ]
    export class HomeComponent {
      currentRate = 10;
    }
After your changes, the Home view should look like that shown in the following
screenshot:
Using the ng2-bootstrap directives as an alternative
The ng-bootstrap directives are the successor to the Angular UI Bootstrap library and are
maintained by Google's Angular 2 team. There's also the ng2-bootstrap module
maintained by Valor Software. The native Angular 2 directives for Bootstrap work with
both Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4.
To use the ng2-bootstrap directives instead of the ng-bootstrap directives, you can
repeat the step we've used to integrate ng-bootstrap. First install ng2-bootstrap by running
the following command in your console:
npm install ng2-bootstrap --save
After installing the ng2-bootstrap directives, you also have to modify the angular-cli-
build.js, app.components.ts, and app.components.html files. Also read the
instructions at the following URL: h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / v a l o r - s o f t w a r e / n g 2 - b o o t s t r a p

the Angular2 5 min quickstart guide.

The ng2-bootstrap module contains among others a  datepicker and timepicker. The
 datepicker looks like that shown in the following screenshot:

-builder.git yourproject
What about Angular CLI?
Angular CLI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) for Angular 2 applications based on the
ember-cli project. The tool helps you set up and develop an Angular 2 project with more
ease.
You can use the ng-bootstrap and ng2-Bootstrap directives as described in the previous
sections with Angular CLI too. The Angular CLI tool use the webpack module bundler.
Webpack uses plugin loaders to preprocess Sass files. lf you do not load Bootstrap's CSS
code from CDN, you will have to configure webpack to pre- and post-process Bootstrap's
Sass code.
Using React.js with Bootstrap
React is another popular JavaScript library for building user interface (UI) components for
web applications. In contrast to Angular, React uses composable components in instead of
template logic. When using composable components your logic is not in a separate template
file. The technique of not introducing any logic into the template is achieved through a
technique called JSX (JavaScript syntax extension). JSX is an HTML-like syntax that
compiles down to JavaScript.
Probably the easiest way to get started with React is to include the necessary libraries from
a CDN. React supports most popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above.
React's documentation points you to a JSFiddle Hello World example to start hacking React.
You can find this JSFiddle at the following URL: h t t p s : / / j s f i d d l e . n e t / r e a c t j s / 6 9 z 2 w e p
o /. This example only prints "help world".

As this book is about Bootstrap, I cannot discus JSX in detail here. You can learn more about
React and JSX by watching Samer Buna's Learning ReactJS video, which can be found at h t t
p s : / / w w w . p a c k t p u b . c o m / w e b - d e v e l o p m e n t / l e a r n i n g - r e a c t j s - v i d e o. Now it's time to
add Bootstrap to our React application.
Using React Bootstrap 4 components
Reactstrap is a library containing React Bootstrap 4 components that favor composition and
control. The documentation for Reactstrap can be found at the following URL:
https://reactstrap.github.io.
A demo can be found at the following URL: h t t p : / / o u t p u t . j s b i n . c o m / d i m i v e / l a t e s t.
To install Reactstrap on your local system, perform the following steps:
Run the following command in your console:
        git clone https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap.git reactstrap
Then navigate to the new reactstrap folder and run the following commands:
         npm install && npm start
The npm start command starts a webpack develop server at
http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/. Webpack is a module bundler for
JavaScript. When you point your browser to
http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/ it should look like the
following screenshot:

Building an Angular 2 App with Bootstrap
[ 368 ]
Notice that Reactstrap depends on Bootstrap's CSS code but not jQuery or Bootstrap
JavaScript.
Now we can use Reactstrap in the JSFiddle Hello World example too. Let's go to the
following URL again: and create a fork in it.
Then add the following external resources:
h t t p s : / / n p m c d n . c o m / b o o t s t r a p @ 4 . 0
 . 0
 - a l p h a . 3 / d i s t / c s s / b o o t s t r a p . m i n . c s

h t t p s : / / n p m c d n . c o m / r e a c t s t r a p @ 2 / d i s t / r e a c t s t r a p . m i n . j s (the Reactstrap
library)
At the end, the resources should look like those shown in the following screenshot:
After that you may edit the JavaScript code. To show a Bootstrap button in the danger state
use the following JavaScript code:

Other tools for deploying Bootstrap 4
A Brunch skeleton using Bootstrap 4 is available at the following URL: h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o
m / b a s s j o b s e n / b r u n c h - b o o t s t r a p 4. Brunch is a frontend web app build tool. It builds lints,
compiles, concatenates, and shrinks your HTML5 apps.
Read more about Brunch at the official website, which can be found at the following URL: h
t t p : / / b r u n c h . i o /. You can try Brunch by running the following commands in your
console:
npm install -g brunch
brunch new -s https://github.com/bassjobsen/brunch-bootstrap4
Notice that the first command requires administrator rights to run. After installing the tool,
you can run the following command to build your project:
    brunch build

The preceding command creates a new public/index.html file. Open it in your browser.
You'll find that it should look like the following screenshot:
Yeoman
Yeoman is another build tool. It's is a command line utility allowing the creation of projects
utilizing scaffolding templates, called generators. A Yeoman generator that scaffolds out a
frontend Bootstrap 4 web app can be found at the following URL: h t t p s : / / g i t h u b . c o m / b a
s s j o b s e n / g e n e r a t o r - b o o t s t r a p 4.
You can run the Yeoman Bootstrap 4 generator by running the following commands in your
console:
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-bootstrap4
yo bootstrap4grunt serve

Again notice that the first two commands require administrator rights.
The grunt serve command runs a local web server at http://localhost:9000. Point your
browser to that address and you will find that it looks as follows:

Beyond this, there are a plethora of resources available for pushing further with Bootstrap.
The Bootstrap community is an active and exciting one. This is truly an exciting point in the
history of frontend web development. Bootstrap has made its mark on history, and for a
good reason. Check my GitHub pages at h t t p : / / g i t h u b . c o m / b a s s j o b s e n for new projects
