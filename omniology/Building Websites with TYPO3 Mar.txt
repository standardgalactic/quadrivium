Preface
Free, open-source, flexible, and scalable, TYPO3 is one of the most powerful PHP 
content management systems. This book is a fast-paced tutorial to creating a website 
using TYPO3. If you have never used TYPO3, or even any web content management 
system before, then you need not look further than this book as it walks you through 
each step to create your own TYPO3 site. From installation, to initial set up and 
content entry, and on to customization and adding plug-ins, this book will get you a 
stable and working TYPO3-based website fast.
What This Book Covers
Chapter 1 introduces content management systems and TYPO3, along with an 
overview of the TYPO3 community. You will also learn about the sample site that 
will be developed during the course of this book.
Chapter 2 covers setup and installation of TYPO3. We look at the installers bundled 
with TYPO3, and tweak the settings of TYPO3 using the install tool.
In Chapter 3 we explore the many features within the TYPO3 back end.  We learn 
how to create and manage pages and their content, how to use the Rich Text Editor, 
and why we need templates to make our pages work. Additionally, you will 
understand the features of the Task Center by using the TYPO3 Extension Manager.
In Chapter 4 we apply our knowledge of the TYPO3 administration features to create 
our website. This chapter shows you how pages fit together, how to display content, 
and how to customize the design. By the end of this chapter you will know how to 
manage different versions of your website content.
Chapter 5 explores the features available in the TYPO3 front end, in particular the 
front-end editing features. You will see how these features work, what they do, 
and how you can edit and create content for our website directly from the website, 
without needing to navigate through the back end.

Preface
[  ]
In Chapter 6 we explore TYPO3’s user management features. You will set up specific 
user groups and create users to work on your site’s content.
Chapter 7 takes a look at the types of tasks that you must perform regularly to 
manage your TYPO3 site. It walks you through backing up your site and restoring 
it whenever needed. We also cover the powerful Workflow and Workspace features 
and learn how they can be useful to us for collaboration.
In Chapter 8 we look at the TYPO3 extension manager, and install four extensions, set 
them up, and link them to our site.  We extend our site by adding extensions to rate 
pages on our site, and one that allows the administrator to look up the hit statistics of 
his or her site. The message board and shop system extensions let you monetize your 
TYPO3 site by adding in ecommerce functionalities.
What You Need for This Book 
You will need to have a system with a modern CPU running at at least 1 GHz, and 
at least 256 MB of RAM (although more is recommended). You will need a web 
server application such as Apache or IIS, a database such as MySQL (there are many 
different databases supported by TYPO3's Database Abstraction Layer, but MySQL 
is natively supported and is the most stable), and PHP version 4 or above. 
Also, you will need ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick) and GDLib / FreeType, to 
utilize TYPO3's image manipulation capabilities, and the zlib compression library. 
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between 
different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an 
explanation of their meaning.
There are two styles for code. Code words in text are shown as follows: "If we click 
on the publish_dir setting, a variable dialog appears with the correct structure for 
the setting."
Any command-line input and output is written as follows:
cd /home/michaelp/public_html/
New terms and important words are introduced in a bold-type font. Words that you 
see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in our text like this: 
"clicking the Next button moves you to the next screen".

Introduction
Welcome to Building Websites with TYPO3! In the course of this book we are going to 
take a look at TYPO3 and use it to build and manage a website. We will install the 
software, get an overview of its back-end features, set up our website, look at the 
front-end features, manage our website and its users, and also expand our website 
and its features with extensions.
In this chapter we will learn:
What a CMS is
What TYPO3 is
What TYPO3 can do for us
What some of its features are
What other resources are available to TYPO3 users
What is a CMS?
A Content Management System (CMS) is a system that allows users to collaborate 
to create and manage content for their website. These systems can range from 
applications installed on your computer—which link into your website to allow you 
to manage it—to web-based applications, which run on your web server and allow 
all aspects of the website to be managed directly from the website.
Content management systems are one of the common methods for creating and 
managing content on the Internet and on intranets, especially in environments where 
there is more than one person working on the content, or where there is a lot of 
content involved. 
•
•
•
•
•

Introduction
[  ]
These systems generally give users the ability to:
Create content
Manage content
Manage, provide, and restrict access to content and also the editing of content
Modify a design layer independent of the site's content
Collaborate effectively
Manage versions of content
With a CMS, content and design are kept separate, which means that the design of 
a website can completely change and it will have no impact on the content of the 
website. This is quite an important feature as it means that the design need only 
be changed once, and not across each page of the website. This makes it easy for 
websites of any size to easily and quickly change their design. Also, it protects the 
design, as content editors do not need to integrate design into their content, which 
could cause problems, for instance if the content editors do not know HTML.

[  ]
What is TYPO3?
TYPO3 is a free, open-source, enterprise-level content management system originally 
created by Kasper Skårhøj (a developer from Denmark) in 2000. It is a web-based 
application that we can run on a web server of our choice. The features that make up 
TYPO3 are modularized, separating all of the main sections and functions. 
TYPO3's License
TYPO3 is released under the GNU (General Public License). This means that:
We are free to modify the source code of TYPO3 for whatever purpose 
we need.
We save money on software, and so we can focus on customization.
It is open source, so security vulnerabilities are more likely to be spotted and 
quickly patched.
The down side to the license is that the software comes with no warranty. Full 
details on the license can be found here: http://www.fsf.org/licensing/
licenses/gpl.html.
What can TYPO3 Do for Us?
With TYPO3 we can quickly and easily create and manage our website's content. New 
sections can be quickly added and changed easily. Different people can have 
permissions to edit different sections thereby improving productivity and enhancing 
collaboration in an easy-to-use web-based environment. 
We can control what other back-end users can and cannot access, so that content editors 
only get access to the content editing tools, and they can use these tools only on the 
content sections they are allowed to edit. Content changes are versioned, so we can 
see what changes have been made, and revert to a previous version if necessary.
We can have draft versions of pages, so we could work on improving a page or 
amending details, and have the content ready for when it needs to be live on the 
website (when it can be snapped in to replace the existing content at the click of a 
button). In addition to different versions of content, TYPO3 also allows us to manage 
different translations of content, providing our visitors with a seamless multilingual 
site (provided we have editors who can translate our content of course!).
TYPO3 can let us quickly add whole new features to our website using extensions through 
an interface known as the extension manager. This allows us to add features such as 
guest books, support forums, or voting polls at the click of a button, without needing 
to install and manage another software application.
•
•
•

Introduction
[  ]
Content can be managed easily through familiar-looking rich-text editors and TYPO3's 
intuitive user interface. 
We can even manage multiple websites and domains through the same TYPO3 
installation. This is very useful if we have a small business site with different 
domains for different products or services. 
If we are trying to edit the same section or content that someone else is editing, TYPO3 
warns us of this and prevents us overriding content that has not yet been submitted. 
All of this can be going on while visitors are still viewing the website!

Overview of TYPO3 Features
TYPO3 has a huge list of features—too many to fully list here; the full list can be 
found on the TYPO3 website http://typo3.com/Feature_list.1243.0.html.

Chapter 1
[  ]
Content and Its Management
Naturally with TYPO3 being a content management system, this is where most of its 
features lie:
Create, edit, and manage web pages
Create, edit, and manage individual content items
A clipboard to copy pages and elements to, in order to paste into different 
sections later
Versioning to control changes, and multiple changes
Workspace and drafts, to create drafts of pages that don't take effect 
until ready
Time-controlled pages and content, i.e. content and pages that are only active 
between a start date and an end date
Users
Our content can be managed by many people; so TYPO3 also has user 
management features:
Create, edit, and modify users and their details
User permissions that control which sections users can and cannot access
Control over which sections a user can edit and control
Extensions
To expand on the default TYPO3 installation, we have an extension manager, which 
allows us to:
Install new extensions to add new functionality
Remove extensions
Modify some basic elements of extensions
TYPO3 Resources
TYPO3 is a very community-built system. There are a great number of resources 
available to help us, and also, to expand and enhance TYPO3.

Getting Help
The typo3.org website is the main resource for TYPO3 users. On this site we have:
Mailing Lists
Mailing List Archives
The facility to ask developers directly
IRC chat
Documentation
Bug reports 	
Videos
Documentation and Videos
The documentation section of the typo3.org website, http://typo3.org/
documentation/, contains a huge amount of documentation; there are guides to 
installing, getting started, templates, and TypoScript. 
There is also a large number of videos available, mostly created by Kasper, showing 
how to use many of the features of TYPO3: http://typo3.org/documentation/
videos/wmv-format/. These videos are a little old, and in some cases may be using 
slightly older versions of the software, but they are still useful in most cases.
Mailing Lists and Archives
This is an incredibly useful resource on the website. The mailing list archives, 
http://lists.netfielders.de/pipermail/typo3-english, are full of requests, 
questions and support that have already been responded to. If the archives don't 
have what you're looking for, then there are the active lists. There is a list for almost 
every possible aspect of TYPO3, from a community snowboarding tour to extension 
development, or just the English users' mailing list. The lists are available at http://
lists.netfielders.de/pipermail/typo3-english. 
Bug Reports
Occasionally, a feature not working as you expected could be a bug. Searching the 
bug reports may prove useful in confirming if something is in fact a bug, or so that 
you can submit the bug to the developers.

Extensions
TYPO3 is very extensible. Huge features and capabilities can be added at the click 
of a button. These extensions are created by the TYPO3 community members and 
are mostly accessible through the internal extension manager of TYPO3 itself. All 
extensions are available on the extension page, http://typo3.org/extensions/, 
and documentation for individual extensions is available with the extension itself. 
Extensions have a varying degree of stability. Some extensions are completely stable 
and safe to use while others have not been completely tested and may contain bugs, 
such as alpha and beta versions of extensions.
There is also documentation on the website for creating extensions, along with 
coding guidelines and naming conventions. 
Sponsorship of Features and Donations
Although TYPO3 is free, it relies heavily on sponsorship and donations. The 
involvement of Kasper and some of the team depends on if they can afford to focus 
time on the project. A number of large features, such as the Database Abstraction 
Layer, are commercially sponsored. Companies who wish to use TYPO3 and a 
particular undeveloped feature fund its development. Since they will be using it in a 
commercial environment, it seems fair to give something back. 
In a similar respect, the TYPO3 community believes that those who use TYPO3 and 
earn money from such use (such as web developers using TYPO3 to power a client's 
website) should donate a percentage of their profits to TYPO3.

Introduction
[ 12 ]
Our Site
Throughout this book we are going to use our constantly expanding knowledge of 
TYPO3 to create a website of our own. We will create a point-of-presence (POP) site 
for a small business. This will allow us to explore a lot of the features within TYPO3 
and to expand our site later.
Site Scenario
The website that we are going to develop is for a small fictional electronic goods 
shop, 'Durham Electrics'. The site will contain the following:
Basic information about the business
Contact details and an online contact form
Search facilities
List of products and services
A dedicated area for customers, with some generic information for customers 
and support information
Because the shop stocks a large range of products the owners have divided their 
products and services into sections. 
An AV section specializing in MP3 players, stereos, televisions, etc.; a computer 
section specializing in computers, software, and accessories; and a services section, 
providing in-store repairs and service agreements with products sold. 
Each section has a manager who will need to be able to access, edit, and manage 
his or her own section's content. Trainee staff members will need to be able to edit 
content only in their appropriate sections (but they will be able to edit only draft 
versions), and their changes will need to be approved by the section manager.
These are all things that TYPO3 can manage easily. We may decide later to expand 
on our customer area by adding extensions to provide more interactive sections such 
as a discussion forum for customers or customer support or a poll system to suggest 
improvements for the business. 
Summary
In this chapter, we have looked at what a CMS is, what TYPO3 is, and how it can help 
us. We also saw that typo3.org really has all of the resources we could ever need. 
We have decided on a project site to create during the course of this book to help us 
apply our ever growing knowledge of TYPO3. Now it's time to install TYPO3 for 
ourselves and see what it has to offer in action!

Installing TYPO3
Now that we know what TYPO3 is, and what it can do for us, we need to get 
ourselves a copy and install it.
In this chapter, we will cover:
Installing a development platform to run TYPO3 (using the Windows

Configuring TYPO3 using the Install Tool. 
System Requirements
TYPO3 requires our system to meet some specific requirements.
Hardware
We will need to have a system with a modern CPU running at at least 1 GHz, and 
at least 256 MB of RAM (although more is recommended). Since we are working 
(locally) on our own machines, we will also need a keyboard, a mouse, and a screen. 
Software
We will need a web server application such as Apache or IIS, a database such 
as MySQL (there are many different databases supported by TYPO3's Database 
Abstraction Layer, but MySQL is natively supported and is the most stable), and PHP 
version 4 or above.

Installing TYPO3
[ 14 ]
Also, there are some other optional software applications that are recommended: 
ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick) and GDLib / FreeType, to utilize TYPO3's 
image manipulation capabilities, and the zlib compression library. 
Installing a Development Platform 
Depending on the operating system we are using, there are different processes for 
installing a development platform on our machine. We can either run an Installer 
package that will install Apache, MySQL, and PHP, along with TYPO3 (there are 
installers available for Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux), or we can install 
each of these components separately. 
The software included in the installer packages may be 
out of date. You should periodically check for updates to 
Apache, PHP, and MySQL to see if there have been further 
releases that fix any known bugs or security problems.
The Windows Installer Package
The Windows installer will install everything that we need to get started. Firstly, we 
need to download a copy from the TYPO3 website, http://typo3.org/download/
installers/. The Version Target OS column shows the operating system for each 
installer. The installer we want is TYPO3 Winstaller as, at the time of writing, this 
installer had the most recent version of TYPO3 and web server software. 

Chapter 2
[ 15 ]
Once the file has downloaded, we can double-click on it to initiate the installation 
process. It is recommended to close all other (open) applications before doing so.
The first stage is just to provide an overview of the installation. After we have read it, 
we can click on Next. 

Installing TYPO3
[ 16 ]
The following screen requires us to accept the GNU (General Public License). This 
is a license under which the included software programs are released. It must be 
agreed to, for TYPO3 to be installed. Once we have read and accepted the agreement, 
we can click on I Agree. 

Chapter 2
[ 17 ]
Now that we have accepted the agreement, we can choose the components that we 
wish to install. We are going to install TYPO3 4.0.1 (as this includes TYPO3 and all of 
the other required components). The other two options are just shortcuts and we can 
choose not to install them if we wish.

Installing TYPO3
[ 18 ]
The next stage is to choose the location where TYPO3 is to be installed. The default 
location is C:\Program Files\TYPO3_4.0.1. If we are happy with this location, we 
can click on Next. 

Chapter 2
[ 19 ]
Finally, we can select the folder within the Start menu (on the desktop) where we 
want TYPO3 to be available. The default is TYPO3 4.0.1. If we are happy with this, 
we can just click on Install; otherwise, we can change this and then click on Install.

Installing TYPO3
[ 20 ]
The installer will begin the process of actually installing TYPO3 and the other 
components needed to run a local web server. This process may take several minutes. 
Once the installation is complete, there is an option to Run Typo3Winstaller and 
Show read me file (once the installer closes).
Some programs or processes on your computer may be running 
on port 80. If this is the case, the TYPO3 Winstaller program will 
fail when trying to start Apache. For instance, some Internet 
telephony programs such as Skype, default to using port 80. You 
should completely close all such programs when starting the 
installation, even if they are not visibly running.
The Typo3Starter program that is launched once the installation is complete. This 
allows us to start and stop our TYPO3 installation, halting both Apache and MySQL, 
thus allowing us to switch between the three preinstalled TYPO3 packages: Dummy, 
Quickstart, and Testsite. The Quickstart and Testsite packages contain demo sites. 
Later, you may find it useful to try some of these out and see the workings of a pre-
built TYPO3 site. The package that we are going to be using is the Dummy package. 
This is because it provides us with a totally blank front end.
Once we click on the Start TYPO3 button, Apache and MySQL will start and our 
browser will open a default web page, shown in the following screenshot. This page 
can also be accessed via http://localhost/.

Chapter 2
[ 21 ]
This default page offers us an overview of the access information for our newly 
installed TYPO3 and phpMyAdmin (which is a web-based interface for editing our 
MySQL database).
If when trying to access TYPO3 you get a blank screen and an error 
message when accessing phpMyAdmin, this may be a case of files 
remaining from a previous web server setup. To correct this error you 
will need to edit the php.ini file (often installed in C:\Windows or C:\
Program Files\TYPO3_4.0.2\Apache\bin by the Windows installer 
package) and modify the extension_dir line to point to the location of 
your PHP extension folder. Refer to the PHP manual for details.

Installing TYPO3
[ 22 ]
Manually Installing TYPO3
For those of us with Apache, MySQL, and PHP already installed (or manually 
installed) we need to manually install TYPO3. 
Depending on the system, there are different processes for installing 
Apache, PHP, and MySQL manually. With some operating systems, some 
of these components are automatically installed. 
With Linux / Unix-based operating systems, there are often a number 
of commands available that (when entered in the terminal) will install 
these applications for us and set them up to work together. It is easiest, 
however, to use the relevant installer for our particular operating system 
from the ��������������
TYPO3 ��������
website.
In order to install TYPO3 manually, we need to download two packages from the 
TYPO3 website, http://typo3.org/download/packages/, TYPO3 Source and 
TYPO3 Dummy. We need the source package to provide an actual site, and the 
dummy package has the required files for an empty site (for us to build upon).
Once we have downloaded the two packages, we need to extract the contents of 
both the files into the same folder (typo3site) so as to merge their contents. We 
can extract the files (using any particular ZIP-handling program such as WinZip or 
PowerArchiver or a built-in application) and then move the folder to a location that 
our local web server can handle. For example: c:/htdocs/typo3site.
Now that we have our files in a web-accessible directory, we can install TYPO3!
If we try to load the TYPO3 site folder in our web browser now, we will be 
redirected to the Typo3 1-2-3 installer. So, http://localhost/typo3site/ will take 
us to http://localhost/typo3site/typo3/install/index.php?mode=123&step
=1&password=joh316 (which is the 1-2-3 installer) because TYPO3 has not been 
installed yet.
The first stage of the installer, stage one, asks for our database parameters. We need 
to enter our username, password, and the hostname (which is usually localhost) of 
our database server.

Chapter 2
[ 23 ]
Once we have entered our details, we can click on Continue for stage two of the 
installation process.
The notice at the bottom of the page is just to remind us that we are 
using the simple 1-2-3 installer. There is a more advanced installation 
method, which we can access by clicking on the Click here to disable 
link. This link will disable the 1-2-3 installer and take us to the more 
advanced one. This notice is not something we need to worry about.

Installing TYPO3
[ 24 ]
Stage two is to set up the database itself. We can either Select an existing EMPTY 
database or enter the name of a new database for the installer to create for us (Create 
new database). The installer recommends that we create a new database using the 
installer itself, so that is what we will do. Once we have entered the name we 
want our new database to be called, we click on Continue; this is shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 2
[ 25 ]
The final step is to tell the installer which database dump we would like to import.
Because we are running a new install through the dummy package, the only option 
available to us is Create default database tables; so we just need to click on 
Import database.
Our TYPO3 installation is now complete! Although the Install Tool recommends 
that we remove the installation directory, change the MD5 Hash that will provide 
access to it, or password protect it, we should leave it there for the moment to allow 
us to further configure our TYPO3 installation (once we have completely configured 
TYPO3, we can remove it). The third link on the Go page is to Continue to configure 
Typo3, which utilizes this main install folder. We will cover that next.

Installing TYPO3
[ 26 ]
Basic Configuration
We can configure our TYPO3 installation by using the main Install Tool. There is a 
default password set on this system, and you maybe asked to enter it when accessing 
the tool. The default password is joh316.
The main Install Tool has ten sections of configuration options. Each of these 
sections is clearly documented within TYPO3. 
For security reasons, we should change the Install Tool password. The option to do 
this is under section 10: About. 
Once we have entered our new password into both boxes and clicked on Set new 
password, we are presented with a screen that tells us that the configuration file has 
been updated, asking us to Click to continue.
This password that we have just set is only for the Install Tool. It provides no access 
to the administration function of TYPO3. 

Chapter 2
[ 27 ]
Section 5: All Configuration, lists all of the configuration options available to us. 
There are a few particular options in here that will be of use to us. At the moment if 
we were to log in to the TYPO3 back end, our website would be named New TYPO3 
Site (this and other system variables can be found under the [SYS]: heading).
We may also wish to change the date format in this section (as different countries 
format the date and time differently). The format of the date and time is the same 
as that defined in the PHP manual (see http://uk2.php.net/date for more 
information on PHP's date formatting). Personally, I prefer to separate the elements 
in the date with a '/' as opposed to the default separator of '-'. 
Once we have made any changes to this, we need to click on Write to localconf.php. 
We are then asked to Click to continue once the changes have been applied.
Another main area that we may like to configure is TYPO3's image 
processing capabilities. 
TYPO3 can utilize both ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick) and GD2. 
Although neither is required for TYPO3 to function correctly, they add 
some enhancements.
The GD2 image library may need to be enabled within PHP itself. 
To do this, we need to open PHP's ini file (which may be located in 
c:\Windows\php.ini) and ensure that there is no semicolon before 
extension=php_gd2.dll.
For ImageMagick, we will need to know the path to ImageMagick
(php.ini is located in C:\Program Files\TYPO3_4.0.2\Apache\
bin, only if you accepted the default options when installing via the 
Windows installer package).

Installing TYPO3
[ 28 ]
We need to configure the graphics options within the 5: All Configuration option in 
the Install Tool, then we can test the functions in 4: Image Processing section.
Here, we can enable or disable the image processing capabilities, and also change all 
of the image processing options. If we have enabled GD within PHP, we can tick the 
box in here to allow its usage.
GD generally comes with PHP, but needs to be enabled within the php.ini file as 
explained earlier.

Chapter 2
[ 29 ]
The ImageMagick path is set here too (if we are using a Linux system, this path can 
be discovered automatically by the Install Tool).
Once we have configured these settings, we can test them in the 4: Image Processing 
section of the tool. The reference image is the image included normally through 
HTML. The first image is an image processed by the server. This could involve 
including a static image, and applying some special effects to it (or resizing it). If the 
images are being processed correctly, then the two are identical.

Installing TYPO3
[ 30 ]
Summary
We have now successfully installed TYPO3! We started with our computer and 
installed all the components required to install and use TYPO3 on our own systems. 
We have looked at the bundled installers that TYPO3 provides, and we have looked 
at changing some of the settings of TYPO3 using the install tool. Also, we have 
secured the Install Tool by changing the default password to one of our own. 
We are ready to log in to the system and explore the features it has to offer, and to 
start creating our very own website powered by TYPO3!

Administration Overview
We now have TYPO3 installed on our system, so it's time to look through the TYPO3 
back end to see its features and how they work. In this chapter, we will learn:
How to access and log in to our TYPO3 back end
How the TYPO3 back end is structured and organized
What the various modules of TYPO3 are and how to use them
Let's Log In
Firstly, we need to log in to the TYPO3 back end.
The TYPO3 back end is located in the typo3 folder within our main installation. For 
those of us who used the Windows installer, our back-end login will be situated at 
http://localhost/typo3/typo3/.
The default username is typo3, and the default password is also typo3.
•
•
•

Administration Overview
[ 32 ]
If you installed TYPO3 using the 1-2-3 Install tool, the default username is admin and 
the default password is password. Enter those details into their respective boxes and 
click on Log In.
Now that we are logged into TYPO3, we need to familiarize our selves with the 
back end.
The Back-End Layout
The TYPO3 back end is set out into three main sections:
On the left there is the Module Bar, which contains all of the available modules.
In the middle there is the Navigation Area, which generally contains a tree structure 
of the website.
On the right-hand side there is the Details View, which is normally where various 
aspects of pages and settings are changed.
At the bottom of each page, there is a handy Search Box, which allows you to search 
for pages and content, and the Workspace Switcher, which allows you to switch 
between live and draft workspaces. 

Chapter 3
[ 33 ]
TYPO3 Modules
The main section of the TYPO3 back end is broken-up into modules. A module is a 
section of the back end that controls a particular aspect of TYPO3.
We have the Web module ���������������������������������������������������
 for working with our website's content. This will 
be our most frequently used module. 
The File module lets us manage files that we use within our website.
The Doc module lets us easily access pages that we have opened and 
are editing. 
We can view users who access TYPO3 and compare their permissions using 
the User module.
Tools and settings can be accessed from the Tools module.
The Help module gives us quick access to a number of help topics for 
working with TYPO3. 
The Admin Functions module contains some infrequently used 
maintenance-related tasks.
Web
The Web module contains all the tools for creating, maintaining, and managing your 
website and its content. In the next chapter, we will be exploring this module a lot 
more to create our website!
Page
With the Page sub-module, you can create pages, edit pages, manage versions of 
the page in different languages, and manage page content. This sub-module is very 
similar to the Doc sub-module mentioned earlier; however, the Doc sub-module is 
intended for files that are currently being edited or that are already opened by a user.

Administration Overview
[ 34 ]
If we click on the world icon next to our site name, a menu appears. This menu 
allows us to create our first page.
Clicking on the icons will bring up the menu, and clicking 
on the text next to the icons will load new content into the 
details view. The menu does not load immediately because 
of the JavaScript used to generate it. It may take a few 
seconds to display.
The New button brings up a create New record section in the details view:

Chapter 3
[ 35 ]
A new record can be any of the things listed in the screenshot. Because we only want 
to create a page to help us explore TYPO3's features, we can just click on the Create 
a new page link at the bottom. TYPO3 then wants to know where we want the page 
to go within its tree structure (this is particularly useful when displaying menus and 
site maps on our pages).
Because we currently have no pages, the root note button will be appropriate; also 
there are no other pages it could be a sub-page of. Now, we need to give the page a 
name and then save it by clicking on the Save button. Once we have pages within 
our site, we can then properly access the functions of this sub-module.
The other two options shown are Hide page and Type. 
The Hide page option is set if the page will be invisible to 
visitors to the website. The Type refers to what the page 
will be storing. Later, we will look at this in some 
more detail.

Administration Overview
[ 36 ]
If we click on a page from within the tree, we can then edit the page content.
Clicking on the name of the page opens the Pagecontent section in the details view. 
Sometimes when we create pages, the navigation tree may not refresh to reflect the 
new pages we have added. We can force the tree to refresh by clicking on the Reload 
the tree from server link (shown in the above screenshot).

Chapter 3
[ 37 ]
Within this section, we can add various content elements to different sections of the 
page. We can also use the icons at the top to add content, move the page, set when 
the page is visible, edit the properties of the page, and create a new page. The TYPO3 
back end offers a nice menu for each individual page, providing us with an easy 
method to edit a page, its settings, and its properties.
If we click on the icon next to the page's name in the navigation area, or if we click 
on the same corresponding icon when in the detail view, a menu appears (the menu 
does not load immediately and may take a few seconds to display).
From this menu, we can quickly view the page in a new window, edit the page, 
create a new page, view its information, cut or copy the page, alter its versioning 
settings, view more options, change the page's visibility and properties, delete the 
page, and view its history.
Page Content
Now that we have had an overview of the Page sub-module in TYPO3, let us have a 
look at creating and managing page content in our pages.

Administration Overview
[ 38 ]
Depending on the template used, the page is divided into (up to) four sections: LEFT, 
NORMAL, RIGHT, and BORDER. We can add different content elements to each of 
these sections by clicking on the relevant new-record button.
So if we want to add content to the main body of the page, we would add it to the 
NORMAL section. Then, we would choose which type of page content we wish to 
add to this section. There are four main types of content:
Typical page content
Special Elements
Form Elements
Plugins
Typical Page Content
Typical page content is static information that we add to the page such as text, 
images, tables, bullet lists, or a combination.
•
•
•
•

Chapter 3
[ 39 ]
Just clicking on the radio button next to one of these content types will automatically 
take us to the appropriate page.
We can easily change the type of content we are adding using the Type drop-down 
menu. Most of the typical page content elements use the same fields, with a few 
additional fields that are unique to that particular type. The previous picture shows 
the typical fields. We have the Type, which in this case is text with image (Text w/
image); we have a Header field, which is the heading for this content element; and a 
Text area.

Administration Overview
[ 40 ]
By default the text area utilizes a Rich Text Editor that allows us to apply 
formatting to the text and see the changes it makes on the fly (similar to using a 
word-processing application). The buttons above the text area provide us with the 
different formatting features to add to the text. We can add tables, view the content 
as HTML, remove formatting, undo changes, redo changes, get help, manage tables, 
insert symbols, and more (using the relevant buttons).
At the top of the page we have the following toolbar:
With this we can, save, save and then view the page, save and then close the editor, 
close the editor, delete the element, or undo / redo the last change.
Special Elements
Special elements are a little more advanced and dynamic than typical page elements.

Chapter 3
[ 41 ]
Here, we can:
Have a list of files that our visitors can download
Add animation and video
Add an interactive sitemap of the website
Just add some plain old HTML to our page
Each of these elements is created differently from the others, unlike the typical page 
elements that were mostly similar to each other.
Form Elements
Many websites allow for some form of user interaction, and out of the box, TYPO3 
provides a small number of interactive features.
There is a Mail form to allow website visitors to send an email to us using a 
web-based form.
We can create a Search form so they can search our website.
We can add a Login form for protected pages.
Plugins
There are a number of extensions that when installed add additional features and 
functionality that can be accessed via the front end by our visitors. These extensions 
can be added via a plugin.

Administration Overview
[ 42 ]
When we create our website, we may decide that we want to add an extra feature, 
such as a guestbook to collect basic feedback from the visitors. We can install this as 
an extension, which will then provide us with the option to add the guestbook as 
a plugin.
Managing Content Elements
We can manage the content elements on our web pages in a similar way to 
managing the pages themselves. We can edit elements, move them around, toggle 
their individual visibility, delete them, copy them, cut them, and view information 
on them.
Similarly to the pages themselves, we can click on the elements icon, and a 
handy menu appears, providing us with quick access to change and manage our 
content elements.

Chapter 3
[ 43 ]
Other Page Tools 
We have had a brief look at some of the features of the Page sub-module. Many of 
the sections of this sub-module contained the same settings and features. Both pages 
and content elements can be cut, pasted, copied, hidden, and so on. Now we will 
look into these features.
If we have an element in the main body of the document, and we want to move it to 
the left or the right-hand side (provided there is already some existing content in the 
other section), we can cut it from its current location (using the menu available when 
clicking an element's icon), and paste the element in its new location.
To paste it into a new location, we just need to click on the icon of the element above 
which we want to paste, and click on Paste after.
This will then cause a prompt to ask us to confirm if we wish to move the element 
from its current location to the new selected location. We just need to click on OK.
Although when pasting we can only paste below an element, we can then move the 
element around within its column using the move buttons. With the item we have 
just moved to a new column, we need to click on the 'move record up' button. The 
'move up' and 'move down' buttons are displayed under the content element's name, 
as shown in the following screenshot:

Administration Overview
[ 44 ]
As well as being able to simply hide or show a particular page or element, we can 
also change a number of settings relating to its visibility. We can make a page or 
element appear on a certain date, disappear at a certain date, or hide it based on 
access. This may be useful for a time-limited offer, or to hide external advertisements 
from staff or paid customers.
These settings can be accessed via the Visibility settings on the menu that is 
displayed by clicking on the icon of a page or element.

Chapter 3
[ 45 ]
View
The View sub-module will allow us to view our pages from within the TYPO3 back 
end, by opening the page into the details view pane. At present, trying to view any 
pages that we may have created will result in an error. This is because we do not 
have a template defined with any of our pages. We will apply a style to our pages in 
the section Apply the Style in the next chapter.
We can either click on the View sub-module and then select the page that we wish to 
view (from the navigation tree), or we can jump from editing the page (in one of the 
other modules), and click the View sub-module link, which will show us the page 
we were editing or working with. The following image shows how a page would be 
viewed, but since we do not yet have a template set up for any page, we will get an 
error message.

Administration Overview
[ 46 ]
List
The List sub-module provides a more advanced view of a page structure and 
content. Page content is listed down the main section of the page with all of the 
various page editing tools displayed alongside the content's name. The clipboard is 
shown on screen with any pages or content elements that we may have copied to be 
pasted elsewhere, later.
Unlike the Page view, this section does not rely as much on the menu that is accessed 
by clicking an element's icon. This interface is probably something that the more 
experienced of us will find useful.

Chapter 3
[ 47 ]
Info
With the Info sub-module, we can see the history of changes that have been made to 
a particular page. Additionally, this section can be extended to show page visit and 
hit statistics by installing appropriate extensions. These different functions can be 
accessed from the drop-down menu at the top right-hand corner of the page.
Access
The Access sub-module allows us to set editing permissions for a particular page. 
We may have different users to edit different sections. To ensure that each user can 
only edit the section or page that he or she is supposed to, this can be enforced with 
the editing permissions.

Administration Overview
[ 48 ]
The User overview display shows the permissions for our login (i.e. the user whom 
we are currently logged into the back end). The Permissions view shows the 
permissions for a page's owner, group, and everyone.
With these permissions, either individual users can be assigned a particular 
permission to edit pages or sections, or particular groups can be assigned these 
permissions. We will set up some users and permissions and explore this section in 
more detail in Chapter 6. 
Functions
This provides us with some advanced functions in the form of wizards that can make 
our lives as administrators easier by simplifying some common tasks. Out of the box 
this includes two wizards:
Create multiple pages
Sort pages
More wizards and functions can be added by installing relevant extensions.
Versioning
With TYPO3 we can have multiple versions of the same page. This could be so 
that different users could edit different versions, or so that we can revert back to a 
previous version of a page.
The Versioning sub-module only shows information once we have created new 
versions of a page.
At present, there is little to see in this section as we have no versions enabled. Once 
we do enable a version for a page, we will see a table of data displayed beneath the 
WORKSPACE MANAGEMENT heading.
•
•

Chapter 3
[ 49 ]
To create a new version of a page, we need to use the Versioning option from the 
page menu.
This takes us to the versioning center for that particular page, which at the moment 
has only one version. We can create a new version of the page by entering a name 
for the version and clicking on the Create new version button at the very bottom of 
the page.
The live version is indicated by the red triangle in the far left box. A version that's 
not live can be swapped with the live version, by clicking on the button with the 
arrow on it. We can edit and delete versions in the same way as we manage pages, 
and we can edit the content of versions in the same interface as is used in the page 
sub-module. The magnifying glass icon will allow us to view the page or version of 
the page.
Template
Without templates, our website will not display.
This is because TYPO3 combines the content and structure from the database, along 
with any special functions, with a template. A TYPO3 template is a database record 
containing rendering information and configuration for the page design, menus, content 
elements, and plugins. By combining the template with the data, we get a page that can 
then be rendered by our browser (the concept of templates was illustrated by a figure 
in Chapter 1).

Administration Overview
[ 50 ]
To apply a template to a page, we can select the page in the navigation tree and click 
on the Template button.
We can select a predefined template from the drop-down list and then click on 
Create template for a new site. This tells TYPO3 to combine this particular template 
when serving the content for that page.
File
The Filelist module provides us with an interface to manage the files used to create 
a web page in TYPO3. Files that we have uploaded as part of page content are 
stored in here, and we can use this section to upload files directly to the structure. 
We can also directly access these files from the fileadmin folder within our 
TYPO3 installation.
Doc
The Doc module stores all open documents in the TYPO3 back end.

Chapter 3
[ 51 ]
These documents are pages and content elements that we have recently selected to 
edit or manage.
We can quickly switch between documents we are editing using the document 
selector drop-down menu, and also see which records are still open, preventing 
other users from editing them.
User
The User module lets us communicate with other users via the Task center and 
manage user accounts in the Setup section.
Task Center
The Task center module provides an area for users to manage tasks, leave notes for 
themselves and others, and for other communication.

You may be surprised to find that when you click on the 
Task center, you are presented with a page that appears 
to do nothing. We need to install some extensions, via the 
extension manager to add features and functionality to 
this section.
Later in this chapter we will enable some of these features using the extension 
manager. The table shown in the screenshot is currently unused. It is linked to the 
export button shown there, but there is no functionality tied to this button. Once we 
enable some of the features here by installing some extensions, the empty table of 
data will be removed and replaced with a To-Do list.
Setup
The user Setup sub-module is where our users' settings and preferences are. We can 
change our password, personal details, and personal preferences in this section.

Chapter 3
[ 53 ]
We can specify if we will use the rich text editor, we can have the back end take us 
straight to the Task center, change how the back end is displayed for us, change 
our password, and then apply the settings by clicking on Save Configuration. It 
is recommended that we update our personal data with our name, email address, 
enable notification of account logins (for security), and change our password.
If we need to change the settings of another user, we must simulate that user, and 
then change their settings. To do this, we can select their username from the drop-
down menu; and we can then edit their settings and preferences.
Simulating the user tells the TYPO3 back end that we are that user, and that we are 
changing our own settings (and not trying to change the settings of another user). 
Only admin users can simulate other users. 
Workspace
Workspaces allow us to change how we work within TYPO3. We have a LIVE 
workspace, which publishes work in a live format, and we have a Draft workspace 
in which all changes will be made to a new copy of the live content—this is 
something that can be handled in the LIVE workspace using versioning. When using 
the LIVE workspace the workspace manager lists draft documents and their status.
We can also create new workspaces with custom settings to improve our working 
environment from this section, in the Workspace List tab.

Administration Overview
[ 54 ]
Tools
The Tools module provides you with a number of useful tools for configuring and 
enhancing your TYPO3 installation.
User Admin
Users and groups are managed in the User Admin sub-module. We can create users, 
edit users, delete them, compare them, and switch to (or simulate) them here.
When we create or edit a user, we can choose which areas of the TYPO3 back end 
they are allowed access to, select which workspaces they can use (preventing some 
users from making live changes), and select which operations they can perform 
on files.

Chapter 3
[ 55 ]
Extension Manager
We can extend our TYPO3 installation with TYPO3 extensions. These are often 
modules (or sub-modules) created by the community for TYPO3 users. There are 
some extensions that are included with TYPO3 but are not installed, and some 
are installed as default. For example, the rich text editor (which allows us to format 
the content of our web pages easily) is an extension that was enabled when we 
installed TYPO3.
The drop-down menu at the top allows us to select the actions we wish to perform, 
from viewing all extensions, to changing settings, to just viewing extensions that are 
already installed.
For us to install a new extension is simply a case of clicking the '+' icon next to the 
extension's name. It is important for us to note the State of any extensions that 
we wish to install, as Test and Beta extensions may not function correctly. Some 
extensions require the database to be changed when we select to install the extension. 
TYPO3 asks us if we would like to make these changes automatically, and shows us 
exactly what changes it wants to make. We can easily remove extensions by clicking 
the '–' button next to them; however extensions with Rq next to their name cannot be 
removed as they are required for TYPO3 to function correctly.

Administration Overview
[ 56 ]
DB Check
This tool allows us to check the integrity of our database, and view how our website 
is stored within TYPO3 and the database.
Configuration
All of the configurable elements of our TYPO3 installation are stored in here, 
grouped by their categories, including: graphics, system, extension, back end, etc.
Unfortunately we cannot actually edit the settings directly here. Clicking on a setting 
will show us a text box containing the full setting string, which we can change, but to 
actually apply the settings we have to change the value in the configuration file itself.
Install
Provided we have left the Install tool intact after we completed our installation 
of TYPO3, we can still access it from the Tools menu, as a convenient way to edit 
settings without editing the configuration file as the configuration tool requests. We 
have seen this in Chapter 2.
By default the Install tool is password protected to prevent unauthorised access. The 
default password for this is: joh316.
Log
Each user's actions are logged and we can view them in the Log tool. Some of the 
logs even provide us with the option to view the history of changes made to 
some files.

Chapter 3
[ 57 ]
We can view the logs for all users of the system, or a particular user of the system, 
and even particular types of logs, such as setting changes or logins. The icon of a 
page with a clock in it allows us to see the history of that particular record.
The feature to view the history of changes seems problematic under 
Windows.  Initially it would take longer than PHP's allowed execution 
time (which can be changed in the php.ini file, which for Windows 
users is in the C:\Windows directory). I also found a number of instances 
of a non-responding task of cmd.exe, but eventually the page loaded. 
Some issues have been raised regarding this in the TYPO3 bug tracker: 
http://bugs.typo3.org/view.php?id=1984.
The history of a page is displayed on screen as shown in the following screenshot 
listing the various versions and history of the page.

Administration Overview
[ 58 ]
This history allows us to roll back to a particular version or edit of a particular 
element, or to roll back all changes that have been made.
phpMyAdmin
This is a very useful tool to have when working with PHP and MySQL. It is a 
web-based interface to manage your MySQL databases, and is installed along with 
TYPO3 for your convenience.
Help
There is a Help module, which contains a number of help features, available in 
addition to various inline help sections.
Inline Help
The TYPO3 back end contains a lot of inline help buttons in addition to the main 
help area (which we will discuss further on in this chapter). If we find a feature or an 
input box, and we don't understand what it is for or how to use it, we can click on 
the corresponding help icon next to it.
Many menu items and links have tool tips assigned to them. This means that 
when we move our mouse cursor over some parts of the TYPO3 back end, a little 
information box is displayed giving a slightly more descriptive explanation of what 
that section or button does.
About Modules
This page gives us an overview of all the modules in TYPO3 and explains what each 
of them is used for.

Chapter 3
[ 59 ]
About
This is TYPO3's about page, with information on TYPO3's license and 
copyright notices.
Manual
The manual page is an interactive inline help section documenting most of TYPO3's 
features. Accessing the manual in this way allows us to browse through it or view it as 
one document. The inline help prompts (which are displayed by clicking the question 
mark buttons next to features) take the help content from sections of this manual.
Admin Functions
These functions allow us to clear some of TYPO3's cache. Cached content makes it 
quicker to serve pages, as they are not dynamically generated on the fly. We should 
only clear these caches when TYPO3 recommends or suggests we do so, as clearing 
the cache can affect our site's performance for a short while.
The Task Center in Detail
The Task center has a lot of capabilities, which surprisingly are not available when 
we first install TYPO3. These features need to be activated.
Activating the Task Center
We will take a closer look at the extension manager (which we looked at earlier); 
once in the extension manager, we need to ensure we are in the Install Extensions 
section from the drop-down menu at the top.
Under the Backend modules heading we can see a number of extensions related to 
the Task center, which are not installed, and that the center itself is installed.

Administration Overview
[ 60 ]
These tools will give additional functionality to the task center; some allow us to 
record tasks, some allow us to create notes, and some provide other features. We can 
install these by clicking the '+' icon next to their names.
It then asks us to confirm if we wish to make the relevant database changes, so we 
click on the Make updates button to change the database.
The Task Center
Now, when we go to the Task center we should see a working module.
Quick Note
The Quick Note feature gives us each a personal notepad area, where we can leave 
notes for ourselves. We just click on the + button next to quick note, and a pencil icon 
appears for us to click (although it appears obscured by the menu items below). This 
opens up a large notepad space for us.
Recent Pages
Any records or pages that we have recently edited are stored under the Recent 
Pages, so we can quickly access pages that we have been working on recently.

Chapter 3
[ 61 ]
List Module / Root
This provides us with an alternative version of the List sub-module that was under 
the Web module.  
Tasks
Here we can create tasks that need to be completed. The tasks can be intended for 
any user in the system, and are assigned deadlines, descriptions, and workflows.
To-Do �����������������������������������
items are then displayed under the Tasks section; once the item has been 
completed, it is removed from under the Tasks heading, and is only available 
through the Task inbox.
Back-End Warnings
Manual Installs
For those of us who installed TYPO3 manually, without the aid of a bundled installer 
program, we have two extra warning messages waiting for us when we first access 
the TYPO3 back end.

Administration Overview
[ 62 ]
To change our user password, we need to go to the Setup section under the User 
module, and under PERSONAL DATA, enter a new password twice, and then click 
on Save Configuration. To remove the other warning, we need to go to the DB check 
section under Tools and click the option to update the reference index. This is an 
index of data kept by TYPO3.
All Installs
Unless we have changed the password for the Install tool during the installation 
process, we will have an error similar to that for those of us with manual installs, 
telling us that we have the default Install tool password.
We can change this by going to the Install tool under the Tools menu, logging in 
with our default password of joh316 and changing the password on the first page we 
are shown.
Although those of us using the bundled installers won't have an error message 
about our password being the default, we should still change our password to be 
more secure.
Summary
In this chapter we have explored the many features within the TYPO3 back end. We 
have learned how to create and manage pages and their content, how to use the rich 
text editor, and why we need templates to make our pages work. Additionally we 
have enabled some of the features of the Task center by using the TYPO3 extension 
manager and explored the new features that the extension manager has provided us 
with. Finally we have removed the warning notices from the back end.

Setting Up the Site
Now that we know the features and workings of the TYPO3 back end, it's time for us 
to really start using TYPO3 and set-up our website! In this chapter we will learn:
How to apply our knowledge from Chapter 3, in order to build a website
What templates are available to us
How to customize templates
Basic uses of content versioning
We will start with our first page, and then take a step back to look, in detail, at 
the templates available to us, and how to use them. Once we have explored the 
templates, we will return to creating the rest of our site. After we have built our 
website, we will return again to the templates, and customize the template we are 
using, and also look at some of the versioning features.
Our Site
As discussed in Chapter 1, we are going to create a point-of-presence website for a 
small electronics firm, Durham Electrics.
We said in Chapter 1 that the site will contain the following:
Basic information on the business
Contact details and an online contact form
Search facilities
A list of products and services
A dedicated customer-only area with some generic information for customers 
and support information
•

Setting Up the Site
[ 64 ]
Once completed, it will be structured like this:
Creating our First Page
Let's start, with the website's homepage. On this page we will add some information 
about the business, so for now, once we have created the page, we will create a single 
page content element for the text.
Create the Page
Once we are logged in, we create a new page by clicking on the globe icon (from the 
page tree in the Page section of the Web module) and selecting New from the menu 
that pops up.
Don't forget—sometimes the menu takes a few seconds to appear!
We are then asked which type of record we would like to create, and we of course 
want to create a new page; so we can click on the Page (inside) link.

Chapter 4
[ 65 ]
Obviously we want our page to be visible; so we will uncheck the Hide page box. 
This can be a problem sometimes, as it's the first option, and it's a checkbox. It's very 
easy to overlook; so if you have a page that's not displaying, you may want to check 
that it isn't hidden!
Let's just enter Home Page as our Page title and Home as our Subtitle, and then click 
on the save and close button.
Add the Content
Now that we have our first page created, let's add some content to the page. We 
click on Page in the page tree and the page content options are then displayed in the 
details view on the right.
Under the NORMAL heading, we can either click on the small icon with the plus 
symbol, or the Create page content button, as they both do the same thing. The other 
headings of LEFT, RIGHT, and BORDER add content to different sections of the 
page, depending on how the page's template is set out. The NORMAL heading is 
for main content, and that is why there is the additional button labeled Create page 
content under this heading.
We then of course want to add a regular text element to our page, although if at this 
stage your feel comfortable exploring different options and features, you may wish 
to add text with an image—something that we will cover later in the chapter. 
I'm going to add a heading of Welcome to Durham Electrics, and a small description 
of the business for my front page. The built-in WYSIWYG editor (What You See Is 
What You Get) allows us to style our content nicely, without the need for manual 
HTML coding, in a friendly interface similar to many word processors. You may 
wish to try out some of the WYSIWYG's features, by adding a table to the content.

Setting Up the Site
[ 66 ]
View the Page
Right, we now have our first page created, with content! Let's have a look at our work.
If we click on the view-webpage button (the one resembling a magnifying glass) 
from the page that we are presented with after adding our content, our new web 
page is opened in a new window.
Here, we get an error message. This is because our website does not have a 
template applied to it. We need a template to add style to our content as we learned 
in Chapter 3.
Apply the Style
Let us quickly apply a template to the page so we can see it in action, and then take a 
closer look at the templates available.
While we still have the homepage details in the details view, we can click on the 
Template link from the menu on the left.
This opens the Template Tools for the page, and as you can see, we currently have 
no template assigned to our homepage.

Chapter 4
[ 67 ]
We are going to create a new website, with this home page at the root of it. The 
template that we assign here will be applied to all further pages created. The template 
we will use throughout this chapter is the CrCPH template, because it is very simple, 
very easy to modify, and looks quite professional. You may wish to experiment with 
the templates discussed later, or even download or create your own templates.
We just need to select the template from the list and click on Create template for a 
new site. We get a prompt that asks Are you sure you want to do this?, and we are, 
so we click on OK.
The template is then assigned to the website, and we are taken to a page where we 
can edit the parameters of the template—something to which we will come back. For 
now, let's see our website in action at last! 

Setting Up the Site
[ 68 ]
We can of course click on the view web page button (the one with the icon of a 
magnifying glass) or select View from the menu in the page tree.
And there we have it! Our web page in action at last!
Templates
There are quite a number of templates pre-installed in TYPO3, which makes it easy 
to quickly create a new website with a design. Many of the templates have a number 
of settings to change, to help us easily customize the design of our website.
If you also wish to see which template you prefer, when creating a 
New record select the Create new page option. This will create a new 
root page, as opposed to a sub-page, allowing the page to have its own 
template. You can then assign the template to the page just as we did 
with the home page earlier. To add content to the page, you can manage 
the content in the homepage. Click on the icon next to the content's name 
(Welcome to Durham Electrics) and select Copy from the menu. Then 
click on the new page's name from the page tree and select Paste Into to 
add the content, as we discussed in Chapter 3.
What Templates are Available to Me?
The following templates are available when we install TYPO3:

Most templates have constants that can be edited; these are settings that have been 
created in the templates, but can be changed in the template manager. Constants 
allow you to change things like: frame sizes, background colors, heading images 
(complete with an upload function), and other basic design elements of your website. 
The templates that come with TYPO3 are a little old, and don't conform to the the 
latest HTML standards; however, they do work and are useful for creating a test site.
Let's take a closer look at the different default templates available!
Template: Bug
This template has three frames: one at the top, one at the left, and one in the middle. 
A number of the settings of this template are controlled by constants. We can upload 
a heading image, and set background colors and frame sizes. The menu in the side 
frame is generated from the sub-pages and is generated as a collection of images. 
The advantage of having the menu-items generated as images is that we can connect 
uncommon fonts to the menu, using any font we wish, and the visitor will see the 
menu exactly as we intended.

[ 70 ]
Template: MM
This is a very simple, single-column based template. The menu is mapped onto 
the heading image; so the image that you upload as a heading will have the menu 
links generated over it. This sort of template isn't the best for displaying a great deal 
of information, but if you were creating a blog section or something like that, this 
template is ideal.
Template: Business
This template is a more professional one. A small logo can be added to the side, and 
the menu is again generated in the left frame. Colors, fonts, and logos can be added 
through the back end by editing the template's constants.

Chapter 4
[ 71 ]
Template: Candidate
Candidate has two content columns, a main one on the left and a smaller one on the 
right. The menu is text-based and displayed beneath the page heading. Many of the 
colors and images can be set through constants. 
Template: CrCPH
This template works differently from the other pre-installed ones. It is based on an 
HTML file that can be edited in a text editor to change the style. A few of its aspects 
can still be changed by editing the template's constants.

Setting Up the Site
[ 72 ]
Template: First
This is quite a poor template. The content frames are nested within another frame 
that centers the whole page. This template seems to load quite slowly, but as with 
most of the other templates, has a lot of customizable options in the constant editor, 
including logos, images in different frames, background colors, and frame sizes. 
The side frame can be set to take content from a separate page. This template uses a 
graphical menu and a separate general menu in the bottom frame. 
Template: Glueck
Out of the box, this is a very interesting looking template (as you can see from the 
following screenshot). It has a variety of different backgrounds: a page background, 
left frame background, main frame background, content frame background within 
the main frame; and right frame. There are also two places for two different logos, 
and an optional heading image. 

Chapter 4
[ 73 ]
It certainly is very colorful out of the box!
Template: Green
The Green template is a very nice simple template, and unsurprisingly it is green! 
The menu is generated into the header as images. There is a template file containing 
the basics of the page layout that can be edited too. A professional theme with a 
green feel! The text is a little difficult to read, however, as it is black on dark green.

Setting Up the Site
[ 74 ]
Template: Hyper
Hyper is a different style of template from most of the others, consisting of lots 
of grid-like images, and horizontal line images. Both the menu and the page title 
are generated into images and of course a logo can be added to the top left corner. 
This and other settings are again changed through the template's constants. To be 
a useable design it would require a lot of modification. The text color is difficult to 
read as it is black on grey, and the images for background and header clash because 
of their color difference.
Template: Newsletter
The Newsletter template isn't really designed as a template for a whole website, and 
is more suited to something like—a newsletter surprisingly! It has no menu support, 
but it does have a simple HTML template that you can edit, a style sheet file that you 
can edit, a second column for content, a changeable logo, and a changeable copyright 
notice. The template is designed to be used for newsletters in conjunction with the 
Direct Mail module extension to allow you to email out newsletters directly.

Chapter 4
[ 75 ]
Template: RE
This template has a graphically generated menu beneath the header image, with 
options for rollover effects when a user places their mouse cursor over the image. 
There is a left frame taking up the entire height of the window on the left-hand side, 
with adjustable background and content. 

Setting Up the Site
[ 76 ]
Template: TU
The final template we have is TU. This template does not make use of frames, but it 
does make use of tables to layout its content. There is a graphically generated menu 
on the left, and we can change the menu's images at the top and bottom (to give a 
rounded effect), as well as its color. We can add a logo, and change other settings 
through the template's constants.
Editing Templates
Now that we have had a look at the templates available to us, let's have a quick look 
at changing some basic settings in the templates by changing their constants. 
When in the Template section for a page, there is a menu that allows us to select 
different sections of the template, including the Constant Editor. 

Chapter 4
[ 77 ]
When in the Constant Editor, we have two main sections, a Category menu, and the 
actual Constant Editor itself. A constant in this sense, is a setting or variable applied to 
the template. For example, page width could have a constant; we could change this to 
700px and our page would be that wide. The templates link with the constants to get 
settings to change their appearance.
The Category menu lists the different categories that the constants are divided into. 
Generally there is a BASIC category, a MENU category, and a CONTENT category, 
although often there are more.
With constants that relate to something like an image, or menu item, there is often an 
illustrated screenshot to show how the constant relates to the page. For instance, in 
the TU template we have the following:
This shows that constant 4 corresponds to the heading image; constant 5 corresponds 
to the background of the page, and so on. 

Setting Up the Site
[ 78 ]
With the constant editor, we need to select which constants we wish to change before 
we can change them. If we wish to change the logo and background color, we need 
to select them to indicate that we are going to change them, and then click on the 
Update button. 
Once we have clicked on the Update button, we are presented with text boxes and 
upload boxes to allow us to change the constants.
The drop-down box under the Top image heading contains all images previously 
uploaded for this template. If, we change the image later, and wish to change it back 
it is saved for us.
Once changes have been made to the constants, we just click on the Update button 
again, and the changes are saved.
Returning to the Site
Now that we have explored the templates available, let's return to our website. 
Throughout the rest of the chapter, I'm going to focus on the template CrCPH, but if you 
feel up to it, you may wish to try applying a different template and working with that.
The Contact Page
We have our home page completed, so let's create the contact page. This page needs 
to do two functions; firstly it needs to convey the different contact methods available, 
and it also needs to contain an online form that will allow visitors to email us directly 
from the site.

Chapter 4
[ 79 ]
We create the new sub-page by clicking on the Home Page icon, and selecting New. 
Then we want to create a new Page (Inside) to create the sub-page. Once we 
have created the page, and given it a name and saved it, we want to add the two 
content elements.
We can add the main content in the same way that we added the content to the 
homepage earlier on, using a Regular text element. 
After adding the static content details, I've decided to add my contact form to a 
separate page, which will be a sub-page of the contact page. You may, however, 
prefer to add it as a separate content element on the same page, depending on your 
preferences or the template you are using. Since this is a sub-page of the contact 
page, we need to click on the contact page button and select new page, and then click 
on Page (Inside). 

Setting Up the Site
[ 80 ]
Instead of adding a Regular text element to the page, we now want to add a Mail 
form to the page.
The Mail form allows us to create a form that will then send us an email with the 
information users have submitted to the website, and then redirect them to a new 
page. We could create a thank you page to send them to.
The configuration for the form needs to be changed slightly as by default it only asks 
for the user's name, email address, and postal address. It's easy enough to change the 
address details to make it an area for the user to type a message.
I've left my form at that, but you may wish to add more options. There is a forms 
wizard that can help you create and edit the form. It can be accessed by clicking on 
the Forms wizard button next to the configuration box. 
You will need to save the page first, and then return to edit the 
content element to see the Form wizard button!

Chapter 4
[ 81 ]
The wizard has options to allow us to add new field rows, delete existing fields, and 
modify existing fields, as well as change the email address that the contact form 
submission is sent to.
Once our form is saved, we can view the page and see our contact form. 

Setting Up the Site
[ 82 ]
If you have installed TYPO3 locally on your machine, it is most likely that 
this form will not work if you test it. This is because you may not have a 
local mail server installed. If you have it installed on a proper web server 
or some local Linux workstations, then the email should send.
The Search Page
Good navigation and search facilities are key to a useful website. Having content is 
great—so long as people can actually find it. We will create a new sub-page from the 
homepage and call it Search Page. The page content of course will be the Search form.
The only field that we need to complete is the heading, and then we can see the 
search result in action.
The search page provides two search options. We can search page headings and 
keywords (keywords are defined with advanced pages) or search actual page content.
I'm going to type in a search for Nevilles which is a part of the address in one of the 
content elements on the contact page.
Performing the search then displays a list of pages where the word was found as 
well as an excerpt from the page content element.

Chapter 4
[ 83 ]
Products and Services Pages
Following the website structure defined earlier, we should create a page for 
products, and a page for services, each of these having sub-pages for the specific 
services or product groups.
We've been through this process a few times now, so I'll let you create those on your 
own. Once completed, the website structure for these sections should look something 
like this:
Customer-Only Area
Creating a customer-only area is a little trickier than the other sections that we 
have added.
We need to create:
A login form
A protected page
A user group
Some customer user accounts
Creating the User Groups and Customer Accounts
Before we can actually create the user group and customer user names, we need a 
place to store them. We need to create a new page within our website, but instead of 
it being a standard page, we change it to a SysFolder type. 
•
•
•
•

Setting Up the Site
[ 84 ]
A SysFolder is a TYPO3 folder that contains system information, in this case, user 
groups. Other folders contain files and content.
We can then name this folder something like Users and Groups. Because we are 
working with users and groups, we want the folder to contain the Website Users 
plugin. So we select Website Users from the Contains plugin menu.
Once this has been created we need to make a note of its ID number for later. If we 
hover the mouse cursor over the folder in the page tree, we will see the ID number. 
The folder I have created has an ID of 43, as shown below
Now that we have our system folder, we can create our users and groups. To do so, 
we need to click on the folder icon and select New from the menu that pops up. 
The New record screen for the system folder is slightly different from the other New 
record screens that we have seen. This is because we have had to select the Website 
users plugin and it allows us to create a new Website user and Website usergroup.

Chapter 4
[ 85 ]
We need to create a new group, by clicking on the Website usergroup link and 
then entering the name of the group. I have chosen customers as the name of my 
usergroup. Once we have our customer group, we can create a new Website user 
who will have permission to log in to the customer-only section of the website. 
We enter a username and a password, and then select the group from the group list:
Creating a Protected Page
Now that we have our customer group and a user to log in, we can create our 
protected page. When creating a new page for the customer-only section, we can 
specify if we wish the page to be hidden from the menu, as it is possible to get the 
page to display once a user has logged in.

Setting Up the Site
[ 86 ]
The General options provide access restrictions, allowing us to restrict the page to 
members of the customers group.
The other two options here, Hide at login and Show at any login, would allow us to 
hide the content when the user logs in—for instance we could hide a login box when 
the user logs in. We could also set something to show at login, which would display 
regardless of the user's group, when they logged in.
Creating the Login Page
We can either have a separate page for logging in, or we can just add the login form 
as a content element to an existing page. The Login form element is grouped with 
the other Form elements in the New content element page.
The Login form element asks us for a heading, and also for a Send to page: option. If 
we leave the Send to page: option empty, the login form will return us to whichever 
page the login element is on, otherwise it will take us to the page that we specify. To 
specify the page we can click the folder icon to see the pages available.

Chapter 4
[ 87 ]
This opens up a pop-up window with the pages listed within, and so, we can select 
the page from here:
Clicking on the page we wish to be transferred to in here will automatically populate 
the field in the page we were in, creating the login element. We can then save 
the page.

Setting Up the Site
[ 88 ]
One final thing that we need to do here, is to tell the login page where the sysfolder 
containing our users is stored. With the login page still open in the back end, we 
need to click on the Template section from within the Web module, select the 
Constant Editor from the drop-down box at the top right, and select the CONTENT 
category from the drop-down box in the middle of the page. In here, we need to edit 
the PID of user archive option, by ticking the checkbox next to it and then clicking 
on the Update button at the bottom of the page.
The page then reloads, with a text box next to the checkbox. We enter the ID of the 
system folder that we made a note of earlier, before clicking on Update again. Once 
the page has reloaded, we need to scroll to the bottom, and click on the link to clear 
all cache. This will apply the new setting to the page.
Customer-Only Area in Action
I created my login form as part of the homepage, so on the homepage I have 
the form.
And when I log in, I am taken to the customer page: 

Chapter 4
[ 89 ]
Customizing our Template
Now that our website has been created, let's return again to the templates, to tweak 
the design of our website.
The main advantage of the template that we are using is that the bulk of the layout 
can be changed from the template file. In the template manager, we can edit some 
basic settings by changing the constants. The most notable constant for this particular 
template is Template file because it allows us to refresh the template with the 
template file, should we make any changes to it, or to refresh from a copy of the file 
stored elsewhere.
The value of this particular constant is by default: typo3/sysext/cms/tslib/
media/uploads/crcph/main.htm. This is the location in the TYPO3 installation of 
the template file. Let's make a copy of this file to edit with a text editor. 
The text that is wrapped in '###' tags indicates values or sections that are replaced 
dynamically by TYPO3. These are called markers when they appear on their own, 
and subparts when they appear in pairs. We can customize this file as much as we 
wish, but should be careful not to delete any important TYPO3 comments as these 
are required for TYPO3 to process the template.
I'm going to edit the location of the logo (as this template does not have the ability 
for us to upload a new logo from the constant editor), and the copyright notice.
There are one or two links that we need to edit, as they are hard coded into the 
template file and are not correct. The links for the homepage point to a page with an 
ID of 123 and the links for the search page point to a page with an ID of 987, neither 
of which exist for me, nor if they did exist would they be the home and search pages 

Setting Up the Site
[ 90 ]
To find out the ID numbers of the homepage and search page, we can place our 
mouse cursor over the page icon for those pages in the TYPO3 back end, and the ID 
number is displayed. 
The colors and other basic settings can be left as they are, as we can change them 
through the constant editor.
Once changes have been made to the template, we need to reload the template file 
from the constant editor. Tick the box for Template file and click on Update.
We can then either select the file from the list, or upload a copy of the file so that we 
can revert between styles later.

Chapter 4
[ 91 ]
With the logo, copyright notice, and link changes I have made, my website now 
looks like this:
Versioning
The versioning tools can be grouped into two categories, per-user tools (which 
affect the user and how they manage content), and the content itself (you can create 
and manage versions of the content). Here we will look at the tools for the content 
themselves, and we will look at the user-centric content-versioning tools in Chapter 6.
We can use versioning for a number of different things:
Creating new versions of content ready to be swapped into place
Managing content changes
Restricting who can edit live changes, but allowing them to edit a copy of a 
live version—something we will see in Chapter 6
•
•
•

Setting Up the Site
[ 92 ]
If we select versioning from a page's menu, we are taken to the page's versioning 
management section.
The versioning page itself lists the versions of the page and allows us to create new 
versions of either the page and content, all sub-pages, or just the record of the page. 
If we create a new version of the page, we can modify that page, and then bring it 
into effect whenever we wish, by clicking on the SWAP with current button. 
If we create a new revision of the branch, which includes all of the page's sub-pages, 
we can modify each page individually, and then roll out all of the changes in an 
instant with the SWAP with current button. 

Chapter 4
[ 93 ]
Each page, sub-page, and content element is listed with the branch, so we can easily 
select which section of a version we are changing.
Summary
In this chapter we have applied our knowledge of the TYPO3 administration 
features, which we looked at in Chapter 3, to the website scenario we discussed 
in Chapter 1.
We created the website, looking at how the pages fit together, how to get the pages 
to display, how to customize the design and how to manage different versions of 
the content. 
Now that we have toured the administration panel and set up our website, it is time 
to look at the features available for us in the front end to allow us to easily change 
and manage the website and its content.


Front-End Features
We now have our website up and running and we know how to manage the content 
from the website's back end. It is now time for us to look into the various front-end 
features available to us. In this chapter, we will learn:
What front-end tools are available
What front-end tools do
How to edit and publish from the front end
In order to access the front-end tools, we must first log in to the back end of TYPO3. 
Once logged in, we can then return to the front end of the website. From the front 
end we will see that there is an ADMIN PANEL section at the bottom of each 
page; this is a feature, which is enabled by default with our template. Here is our 
ADMIN PANEL:
Front-End Admin Panel Overview
The front-end admin panel is divided into a number of sections:
Preview
Cache
Publish
Editing
TypoScript

Front-End Features
[ 96 ]
We can show and hide different sections of our ADMIN PANEL using the + and 
– buttons displayed next to the relevant titles, as shown in the following screenshot:
Unfortunately, a limitation of the front-end admin panel is that when you 
try to expand or collapse a section of the admin panel (using the + and 
– icons) the page has to be reloaded for the new sections to show or hide 
themselves. I would recommend that you leave frequently used sections 
expanded, and just hide the entire panel when you don't want to use it, as 
showing the panel again will expand all of the sections you had expanded 
previously. These preferences are stored in the TYPO3 database, and only 
need to be set once, not each time you log in using 
another computer.
Once we have opened a particular section of our ADMIN PANEL, an Update 
button will appear at the top of the panel to allow us to save the setting changes we 
have made.
Preview
The preview features allow us to change the conditions, which changes the content 
we can see. The features are as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
[ 97 ]
The conditions that we can change are as follows:
Ability to see hidden pages.
Ability to see hidden content elements, i.e. records.
Time—as some pages are time-sensitive, we can simulate an alternative time 
to see what content would be available to us.
Usergroup—as content can be restricted to specific usergroups, we can 
simulate a different user group and see content that would be available if we 
were logged in as a member of that particular group.
When we change these conditions, the pages that were not accessible to us before 
(i.e., hidden or time-sensitive) are displayed, with a PREVIEW box to inform us that 
we are previewing the page by changing the conditions. This PREVIEW box is also 
displayed when we view a hidden page directly from the back end by clicking View 
Page on a hidden page. Here is the PREVIEW box:
Hidden Pages
Let's take a look at the hidden page setting to view content that is not live. First, let's 
create a page and set the visibility to hidden.
In Chapters 3 and 4 we learned how to create pages and toggle the visibility of the 
pages; so let's apply that knowledge here, by creating a hidden content element on 
the page and by creating a separate page that is also hidden.
Now that we have some hidden content, its time to change the conditions for viewing 
the page. We will set the Show Hidden Pages option, as shown in the screenshot:

Front-End Features
[ 98 ]
Once we have changed the setting and clicked the Update button, the page will 
reload to reflect the changes. Here is the screenshot:
Reminder: Page and Page Content Visibility
When we create a new page, the page is automatically set to be invisible, as the 
check box in the new page is already checked. This is how it appears on our screen:
We can toggle the visibility of a page or page content by clicking on the icon for 
the page or content element and selecting Hide/Unhide. It is shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 5
[ 99 ]
Hidden Records
The hidden records option is similar to the hidden pages option, except that it can 
also show content such as alternative language content, or content that is hidden by 
template settings (TypoScript).
Time-Sensitive Content
We can create content that is time sensitive, which is useful if we want to prepare 
information on a sale or special offer that is only valid for a set period of time.
To see how this feature works, we need to first create some time-sensitive content. 
If we create a new content element in the back end, there are some General options, 
which contain the time-sensitivity options. For example, I'll set the time frame for a 
weekend to inform the visitor that there is a special offer over the weekend. Here is 
the screenshot:
Now that we have some time-sensitive content on the front page, we can simulate 
the time by entering it into the Simulate Time field and clicking the Update button, 
to see the content. We will get a similar screen to this:
With the time now simulated to be within the special offer time frame, we can see the 
content which was hidden:

Front-End Features
[ 100 ]
Usergroup-Sensitive Content
We already have usergroup-sensitive content on our website, as we have a login 
box on the front page, and a special customer service page. If we simulate the 
CUSTOMERS group, we should be able to see this content automatically without 
the need to log in to the website.
We need to select the Simulate User Group option from the list:
Then update the settings with the Update button shown in the following screenshot:
After clicking the Update button, the page will reload. The changes are then reflected 
instantly, as we are logged in (although no username is displayed) and we have the 
Customer Service Page on the menu, which we can access and view now. Here is 
the screenshot:

Chapter 5
[ 101 ]
Cache
The cache settings allow us to change and refresh TYPO3's cache. This cache has 
various settings and data stored temporarily on the server. After major system 
changes, the cache needs to be cleared so that new data or settings can be applied 
correctly. Having a cache decreases the time taken for pages to load, as TYPO3 
processes information such as settings or image functions (especially true with 
image-generated menus in some templates). It then stores the end result in the cache, 
saving the need for the system to process these tasks on each page load. We will get a 
similar screen to this:
We can turn off the cache here, clear the cache for various page levels, and clear 
the cache for the current page. It also details the number of cache entries for the 
current page, and as you can see, with the settings and template we have used in the 
example website, no cache records are created.
Pages are structured in levels; we have our home page, and the other pages are 
sub-pages, which makes them one level below (as you can see from the tree structure 
in the back end). We can select an option just to clear this page, or clear this page and 
all other pages within its level or one level below i.e., all of the other pages we have 
created, as these are sub-pages.
Publishing
The publishing section allows us to publish our TYPO3 pages into static HTML 
pages (we will ������������������������������������������������������������
s�����������������������������������������������������������
et the output directory later). This can have several uses:
We can create pages to be archived or mirrored elsewhere.
We can speed up page generation, as no business logic needs to be processed 
on page load.
•
•

Front-End Features
[ 102 ]
Unfortunately, the links created are as they were on the live site, and do not point to 
the published copies. If we were to publish our website to an archive, or wanted the 
published pages to be used on our live site (as we don't have any dynamic content), 
we would need to change the links and menu manually to reflect the published 
pages. Here is the screenshot:
The publishing options allow us to publish a specific page, or the page and several 
sub-levels below. For example if we select + 1 sublevel from the Publish levels 
drop-down box, this would convert the home page and all of the subpages we have 
created (such as the contact page, and the products and services pages) into static 
HTML files, which are then sent into a designated publish directory.
Setting the Publish Directory
Before we actually publish any of the pages, we need to tell TYPO3 where we wish 
for it to create the static pages. If we go to the back end, and select Configuration 
from the Tools menu, as shown, we can see and change the publish_dir setting:
Within the configuration tool, we can see the publish_dir setting under the FE 
section; this setting currently has no value assigned to it. Here is the screenshot for 
the settings:

Chapter 5
[ 103 ]
Unfortunately, the configuration data cannot actually be set from the TYPO3 back 
end, but it will tell us how we should amend the configuration file. If we click on 
the publish_dir setting, a variable dialog appears with the correct structure for the 
setting, which we can change; but then we must copy the value in its entirety and 
paste it into the configuration file itself. This is shown in the following screenshot:
Note: I have selected '/' as publish_dir because linked resources 
such as images will not be copied; only the pages are copied into a 
static format. This means if we published to a new folder, none of the 
images would appear and we would have to copy them manually to 
our publish directory.
We then copy the code into the localconf.php configuration file, which, 
provided we ran a default install of the TYPO3 Winstaller, should be located at: 
c:\Program Files\Typo3 4.0.2\Apache\typo3_src\typo3conf\.
We can just open this file with a text editor, such as Notepad, and then paste the 
following code in the relevant line of code:
$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['publish_dir'] = '/';
Here is the screenshot showing where to place the code:
Once we have pasted the code, we can save and close the file, and actually use the 
publishing feature of TYPO3.

Front-End Features
[ 104 ]
If we publish our Home Page by clicking the Publish now button from the admin 
panel, the page will reload, and we will get a message telling us that the page has 
been published, as shown in the following screenshot:
We can then visit the static HTML page using the following address: 
http://localhost/typo3/7.0.html, where 7.0.html is the file into which TYPO3 
has written.
Editing
One of the most useful and important features of the TYPO3 front end is that of 
front-end editing. We can edit and create content for our website directly from 
within the website itself, without the need to navigate to the TYPO3 back end. The 
content-editing features available here are the same as in the back end. You may find 
it more useful to use front-end editing if you spot a mistake you wish to amend, or to 
help you visualize where you wish to make changes. The back end is generally more 
useful when performing other tasks at the same time, such as managing users.
This section of the admin panel has a number of options and settings available to let 
us customize our front-end editing, as shown in the following screenshot:
Front-End Editing—Settings
Let's see what the different settings for front-end editing do:
Display Edit Icons: This setting adds small pencil icons to the various 
content elements on the page, which when clicked will allow you to edit 
the element.
Display Edit Panels: This adds other icons, like a tool bar, to the page, which 
gives the ability to move content around on a page and edit the page itself.

Chapter 5
[ 105 ]
Editforms on-page: As opposed to opening in a pop-up window or opening 
an edit form in a new page, this will reload the page with the edit form 
embedded into the current page.
No popup window: If the edit form is not set to be on-page, then a 
pop-up window opens with the edit form in. This option will prevent the 
pop-up window opening, instead reloading the page and replacing it with 
an edit form.
Front-End Editing—Links
In addition to the setting for editing in the admin panel, there are also some links to 
various pages, as shown in the following screenshot:
Going from left to right, these links allow us to do the following:
View the record change history of the page.
Create a new content element.
Move the page.
Create a new page.
Edit page properties.
View the Web|List module.
Beneath the icons, there is a link to take us to the back end.

Front-End Editing
Now that we know what front-end editing features and tools are available, we can 
see some of them in action.
In order to see all of the appropriate options for the content and to prevent 
unnecessary pop-up windows, I've selected all the four options in the editing panel. 
With these settings, there are several editing options that have now appeared on 
the page. There are some page editing options at the top, and then beneath the first 
content element there is the edit button, which will allow us to edit the content itself. 
Beneath that there are options for that particular element, such as delete, move, and 
edit. Here is the screenshot showing all the options:
In order to edit inline text (open the editing pane within the page itself), we need to 
use the edit icon that is grouped with the other properties icons, as the separate edit 
icon will either open a new page or open a pop-up window if that option is 
not selected. 

Chapter 5
[ 107 ]
Here is a screenshot displaying the result:
We can see the content that we are editing, and then we can edit the content in the 
edit section beneath it, and save it. This makes it really easy, especially for users 
who don't edit or use the system frequently—they might browse the site, and see a 
spelling mistake or realize that something is missing, and just click the edit button to 
make the change.

Front-End Features
[ 108 ]
TypoScript
The TYPO3 template engine utilizes advanced features using something called 
TypoScript, TYPO3's built-in configuration mechanism. This is used to generate 
image menus and dynamic content within the templates.
These settings are primarily useful when working with 
complex templates. With the template we have been using, 
these features have little benefit to us.
The following screenshot displays all the options we have:
The various settings change the information that we can see in the following 
screenshot. Tree display will convert the TypoScript table below it (the table with 
TypoScript Key, Value, etc.) to represent a tree structure showing how the various 
TypoScript Keys relate to one another, as shown in the screenshot on the next page:

Chapter 5
[ 109 ]
In this tree, we can see how the page is generated. It outlines various files or 
functions that TYPO3 includes, shows processes and logic that it must perform, and 
gets the data and the templates and then combines the two by rendering the page.
If we have the time display setting, then it will add a time field to the table; so we 
can see how long it takes for various things to be processed. This can be useful if we 
find our page is loading slowly, and if it turns out that we have a complex image 
generation script that is taking up most of the time, we can isolate the problem.
The messages and content rendering options require the tree display to be enabled, 
as they extend the information displayed to us. The results of these options produce 
a huge table, too big to be included here, as the table is too detailed, try the options 
out for yourself to see the information it displays.

Front-End Features
[ 110 ]
Info
Finally, we have the Info section. It displays some general information about the page 
we are viewing. We have the page ID number; we can see that the page is not being 
stored in the TYPO3 cache, and if we were logged in as a front-end user, we would 
see the username and user ID. Finally, we can see how long it has taken TYPO3 to 
generate and display the page. Here is the screenshot displaying the Info section:
Summary
We have looked at the features that are offered by the TYPO3 front end, in particular 
the front-end editing features available. We have learned how these features work, 
what they do, and how we can edit and create content for our website directly from 
the website itself, without navigating through the back end.

User Management
We now have our website up and running, and we know how to manage the content 
from both the front end and the back end of TYPO3. It is now time for us to look 
at user management so that others can work with and manage our website. In this 
chapter, we will learn:
How to create and manage user accounts
How to create usergroups
Setting user permissions
User preferences
User Preferences
Before we go looking into creating and managing other users, let's have a detailed 
look at our user preferences, which we briefly looked at in Chapter 3.
In the TYPO3 back end, our preferences are stored under the Setup section of the 
User module, as shown in the following screenshot:
From here we can:
Simulate another user—which effectively logs us in to the back end as them, 
without disclosing their password and allowing us to quickly swap back
Change our language
Edit our preferences when TYPO3 starts up

User Management
[ 112 ]
Change some advanced file copy and delete preferences
Change our content editing preferences
Change our personal details
Reset preferences to their default values
Simulation and Language
Provided we are logged in as an administrator, the first two options available to 
us are to Simulate backend user and to change our LANGUAGE. The options are 
shown in the following screenshot:
The back-end user simulation allows us to access the back end as if we were logged 
in as another user. There are a number of reasons for this. User passwords are 
stored as MD5 hashes, which is an irreversible one way hashing, and not stored in a 
readable form. So, we cannot see what the password is, which is good for security. If 
we could see the password, it would be very time consuming to log out, log in as the 
other user, then log out and log back in as ourselves.
In order to change the settings of another user, we must actually simulate that user 
and then make the changes, making it more difficult to accidentally change a user's 
preferences or details. This is also useful if the users are complaining that they are 
unable to access or do something in the back end that they should be allowed to do. 
We can then log in as them to investigate the problem properly.
We can also change the back-end language, so all text in the back end is displayed in 
the user's preferred language.

[ 113 ]
Start Up
We can also change how the back end is structured when we log in to it. The 
structure is shown in the following screenshot:
Condensed mode in the back end will load the back end with all of the modules 
having their menu items folded up, so we have to manually open them and then 
select the sub-module within that we want to use. It is useful for users with small 
screens, or if we want to try to reduce the start-up time of the back end (slightly); 
otherwise it is an inconvenience.
The TYPO3 back end has three separate navigation modes; which you use is down to 
personal preference.
Firstly, there is the default and the most commonly used left-frame menu option, as 
shown in the previous screenshot. When we save this configuration and follow the 
instruction given on the same page, we get a similar screen to this:

User Management
[ 114 ]
Then, there is selector box in the top frame, which removes the side menu and adds a 
drop-down selection box next to the TYPO3 logo at the top. Here is the screenshot:
The menu expands to give us all these options:
Then, there are icons in top frame layout, which removes the left menu and places a 
line of icons to the top of the page. To show which sub-module we are viewing, the 
respective icon has a border around it, and each icon has a tool tip to explain what it 
links to. The icons are shown in the screenshot below:

Chapter 6
[ 115 ]
We also have the option to start TYPO3 in the Task center. This will automatically 
take us to the Task center when we log in to TYPO3. This option is useful to check 
for tasks assigned to us or notes we may have left. We could force each user to be 
taken to the Task center, when they enter the back end, with some settings in the 
TSconfig section of the user or group. This will be covered later in the chapter.
If we have the Show Thumbnails by default option enabled, then when we view 
our website in the List mode (see the Web|List sub-module), we can see the attached 
images as inline thumbnails while browsing the list.
We have the Show help text when applicable option, which will automatically put 
help information on some pages to assist with some of the features in the back end.
The final option in the startup section of the user preferences is the Max. Title 
Length that limits the length of titles displayed in page trees. For instance, if we have 
long page titles, they can cramp and obscure our file structure tree by occupying 
several lines. By default this value is set to 30, I have set mine to 10, in order to 
explain the features more thoroughly. Setting this value, we will get a similar screen 
to this:
Here page titles longer than a total of 10 characters are limited only to the first ten 
characters followed by "…", making a much cleaner view and user interface.

User Management
[ 116 ]
Advanced Functions
There are two Advanced Functions. These are preferences that we can change, both 
of which are similar:
Recursive Copy
Recursive Delete
The preferences are shown in the screenshot:
The Recursive Copy setting allows us to set the number of page levels we want to 
copy when we copy a page. If we set this to 1, then this would copy one sublevel too. 
Currently, all of our pages in our website are in a sublevel to the home page. With 
this set to 1, if we were to copy the home page and paste a copy of it alongside it, it 
would also copy all pages in the first sublevel, such as the contact and services pages 
(individual products are set at a level further below and would not be copied).
We can also recursively delete files. With this setting enabled, when we delete a 
page, it will also delete all sub-pages. It is useful if we need to remove a whole 
section of our website frequently.
Edit
There are also a number of preferences that we may change here. These affect editing 
data in TYPO3. The preferences are shown in the screenshot:
If we enable the option to have a Wide document background, the form width will 
be increased by about 50%. This would give us more room to work while editing 
content and data.
•
•

Chapter 6
[ 117 ]
The option Enable Rich Text Editor (if available) is set by default. This gives us a 
What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWIG) style editor, where we see the content's 
format being changed as we make the changes. It means that when we click the bold 
button and then type some more text into the text area, the text will appear as bold in 
the text area.
The file upload option will enable a file upload box on records and allows files to be 
attached. If we disable this option, then the file upload box will still be displayed on 
the relevant pages, but it will not work.
TYPO3 has a large number of built-in help features, which we have looked at in 
earlier chapters; one of the most useful help features is the inline help. This inline 
help has two options: we can either see a help icon (a question mark in a circle), or 
we can see a full text message instead. Personally, I prefer the use of the help icon 
only, as the presence of icon alerts me to the fact that there is help available on a 
particular feature, and clicking the icon will provide me with the help, reducing 
clutter on the screen.
In the web module, we get a special menu when we click on any of the elements in 
the website's tree view, this is known as a Context Menu. This can be disabled if we 
want, using the Disable Popup Context Menus setting.
Personal Data
Finally, we have our personal data, which has a number of uses. The PERSONAL 
DATA setting is shown in the screenshot:
The Your name option is useful when we have lot of users, and need to know what 
they are called. Users can edit their names themselves, so it is useful in the case of a 
spelling mistake or a name change. We can enter our email address, which in turn 
enables us to activate the security setting to send an email when someone logs into 
TYPO3 using our account. This notification is a great security feature, especially if we 
rarely log in to TYPO3 using the main administrator account, as we will get an email 
to tell us someone is using the system.

User Management
[ 118 ]
This is also useful when we use the task center's messaging module, so that messages 
can be emailed directly to the user they are being sent to. The disadvantage of this 
is that if we frequently log in to TYPO3 with this account, then we will get lots of 
emails regarding this.
Once we are happy with the changes, we can click on the Save Configuration option:
 
We have a number of changes to be made, such as the back-end layout options, that 
will take effect only if we log out and then log back in again. If we wish to reset all of 
the values back to their original values, we can check the Reset all Values to default 
box to do this for us.
Creating Usergroups
Back-end users, the users that can access the TYPO3 back end, are grouped together 
into back-end groups. These users can access the front-end editing features, but are 
not front-end users. A group allows us to have specific settings and permissions that 
its users will automatically use, and also allows us to organize our users easily. These 
back-end usergroups are for users who have access to the TYPO3 back end. As we 
are going through this section, you may wish to create a group of your own, such 
as Editors or Product Managers, and think what permissions and settings would be 
appropriate for them.
To create a new usergroup, we need to go to the New record screen, which can be 
done by clicking New from the menu generated when we click the globe icon at the 
top of the list view, as shown:

Chapter 6
[ 119 ]
From the New record screen, we can create a new back-end usergroup by selecting 
the option shown in the following screenshot:
 
This will take us to the form to create a new back-end usergroup, which provides us 
with a number of options:
The first four options are Disable, Grouptitle, Lock to domain, and Include 
Access Lists. 
The Disable option will prevent all users who are part of this usergroup inheriting 
any of the permissions and settings that are defined in the group's settings.
The Grouptitle is mandatory, as denoted by the yellow square containing an 
exclamation mark next to the field. It is just a text description so we know what 
the purpose of the group is. Possible names for groups could be Editors, News 
Writers, etc.

User Management
[ 120 ]
One of the features of TYPO3 is that we can have a number of separate websites 
and/or separate domains running from the same installation of TYPO3. Because of 
this, we may wish to restrict some users to particular websites or domains. The Lock 
to domain option allows us to specify the domain to which a usergroup is restricted 
to. This domain will be the only one that users of this group can log in through, and 
will be the only website they can access and edit. If users are not locked to a domain, 
then they have access to all the domains.
If we select the Include Access Lists option, the page will reload containing a 
number of permission options that are available to the usergroup.
Include Access Lists
The Include Access Lists option gives us eight new areas to configure when creating 
the group. This option is separate, so we can create usergroups where we don't wish 
to set permissions, i.e. we are just grouping users for organizational reasons and 
to reduce the length of the form if we do not need these options. The eight options 
available to us with this option enabled are as follows:
Modules
Tables (listing)
Tables (modify)
Page types
Allowed excludefields
Explicitly allow/deny field values
Limit to language
Custom module options

Chapter 6
[ 121 ]
Modules
The first access permission that we can set is access to the Modules, which are 
the main areas of the back end. The contents of Modules are shown in the 
following screenshot:
We then select the modules that we want to be available to the usergroup.
To select more then one module, hold down the Ctrl key 
while selecting the modules from the list.
If we make a mistake and wish to undo the last changes we have made, we can click 
the revert selection button which is as shown:

User Management
[ 122 ]
Tables (modify)
Although the next access option is Tables (listing), the modify option is more useful. 
It provides some of the settings that we may need for the Tables (listing) section. 
The contents of Tables (modify) are shown in the following screenshot:
The page, page content, website user, website usergroup, domain, alternative page 
languages, internal note, and acronym are stored in separate database tables. This 
setting sets which of these tables we are allowed to modify. Multiple selections and 
reverting selections apply here too.
Tables (listing)
The difference between this and the Tables (modify) option is that the modify option 
restricts which table a user can change, whereas the listing option restricts which 
of these a user may actually see. This section need not be set if a user has modify 
permissions to all of the tables that they are required to view. The contents of Tables 
(listing) are shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 6
[ 123 ]
The help system for TYPO3 regards this as an unimportant option, as it is a rare 
situation in which we would wish for a user to be able to see but not modify 
these options.
Page Types
The Page Types options allow us to specify which type of page a user may create. 
If we have a group who are in charge of managing sponsors and affiliates only, we 
may only wish to grant them permission to create the External URL type of page.
We can use the revert selection button to undo any changes, and use the Ctrl key to 
select multiple options from the list.
Allowed Excludefields
By default, some fields are not available, but we can enable these by setting them 
from the list of excluded fields. The list of Allowed excludefields is displayed in the 
following screenshot:

User Management
[ 124 ]
Explicitly Allow/Deny Field Values
By default, these values are something that users of this group can set, so users of 
any group by default can set headers, text elements, text with images, images, and 
so on. We can explicitly deny users from doing this, so if we do not want our group 
to add image elements, we can tick the [Deny] Text w/image and [Deny] Image 
options to prevent them from being able to add an image to the page. You can see 
the options in this screenshot:
Limit to Language
TYPO3 is a multilingual content management system, which means we can add 
languages and create alternative page content in those languages. As a result of this, 
we can restrict users and groups to a particular language. This could be useful if we 
had a translation team; we could have a group of French translators and a group of 
Spanish translators. Here is the screenshot displaying Limit to languages option:
These translators would then only be able to edit the page content that is in that 
specific language. As we don't have any alternative language setup, we only have the 
Default language option.
Custom Module Options
For us, this section is empty! It is because this section is reserved for any permission 
introduced by any extension, which we may install, that wishes to utilize the 
permission system. Here is the screenshot:

Chapter 6
[ 125 ]
Now we are back to the non-Access Lists settings. We have settings for DB Mounts 
and File Mounts. These are sections that we have not really covered previously, and 
mainly have uses with respect to users and groups.
DB Mounts
A DB Mount is a page in the page tree that will then act as the page root. We could 
set this to be our Home Page for some users, who are working on the main website, 
whereas users that we wish to work on new areas of the website can see the full page 
tree. It appears on screen as:
To actually select a DB Mount, we can click the folder icon next to the DB Mounts 
box and we will get a similar screen to this:

User Management
[ 126 ]
Here the pages in our page tree are listed. If we click on one of the pages, such as the 
products page, this page is then added as the DB Mount on the previous page (the 
one that caused this window to pop up). This will alter their page tree, as shown in 
the following screenshot:
This page tree only contains Our Products and all the sub-pages, while the other 
pages are not included because we set the Home Page as the user's DB Mount.
File Mounts
A File mount allows the user or group to access files stored in the fileadmin folder 
on our server. This could be useful if we have a marketing group that is responsible 
for creating pages for all of our products. We could assign a mount point that is a 
folder we have created on the web server that contains images and information they 
need to access.
The icons on the right-hand side allow us to:
Edit file mounts
Add file mounts
List file mounts
•
•

Chapter 6
[ 127 ]
The options are shown in the following screenshot in the same order:
Workspace Permissions
A workspace allows groups of users to work together to process draft content. The 
Workspace permission are really useful options in TYPO3. They define how users of 
the group can edit and manage content. The options for Workspace permissions are 
shown in the following screenshot:
We have the following options:
Edit Live
Edit Draft
Create new workspace projects
The Edit Live (Online) option will automatically apply changes that users of this 
group make; this permission is ideal for an editors group, whereas the Edit Draft 
(Offline) setting is ideal for users whose work needs prior approval first. We will 
cover workspaces in Chapter 7.
•
•
•

User Management
[ 128 ]
Options for Groups
If we set the Hide in lists option, then we will not see this usergroup in any lists 
that allow us to select groups. This may be useful if we have most members as part 
of multiple groups, one group for their permissions, and another one to reflect their 
staff position in the business, which other users do not need to see as the groups 
have no permissions or features.
We can assign permissions to a group from other groups by adding these as 
subgroups, using the Sub Groups option. We can enter a description of the group 
in the Description box, for instance if we have an editors group, we might have a 
description like "Editors approve content from most users before it goes online." 
These three options are shown in the screenshot:
TSconfig
The final option to us is TSconfig. This is an advanced option that allows us to 
add additional permissions. We enter the configuration in the form of TypoScript, 
which is a configuration mechanism built into TYPO3. There are loads of options 
available that can be controlled by TypoScript. You can follow the following link to 
get documentation for it: http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/
references/doc_core_tsconfig/current/view/.
You can even refer to the book Mastering TypoScript by Daniel Koch 
(ISBN 1-904811-97-3), published by Packt Publishing.

Chapter 6
[ 129 ]
One simple example of using this setting would be to enable the admin panel, which 
is displayed at the bottom of the front end (as this is disabled for regular users), by 
adding the following code into the box:
admPanel.enable = 1
The TSconfig box is shown in the screenshot:
The TS logo at the side of the box opens up a more interactive copy of the 
instructions for TypoScript; however, the online version explains more about 
TypoScript, its features, and its syntax.
To save the usergroup, there is the selection of close buttons to save, save and close, 
or just close without saving, as shown in the screenshot:
Creating Back-End Users
Now that we have created a back-end usergroup, we can create a user to go into 
the group. Similar to creating the back-end usergroup, we select New from the 
context menu in the file tree.
Only instead of selecting new usergroup we select a new back-end user.

User Management
[ 130 ]
User Login Details
The first three options are the user's username, password, and usergroup. The 
Username and Password are the only mandatory fields, as denoted by the yellow 
square containing an exclamation mark next to the fields. I'm going to create a user 
to go in my editors group. While we are going through this section, you may wish 
to think up appropriate values for a user of the group you created earlier, and create 
that user. The login details are shown in the following screenshot:
We can assign the group simply by selecting it from the Items list. These options will 
take us to another page, and we will be reminded that changes to this user will be 
lost if we continue to follow the link.
General Restrictions
The next three options are Lock to domain, Disable IP lock for user, and Admin(!), 
as displayed in the screenshot:

Chapter 6
[ 131 ]
The Lock to domain option allows us to specify the domain to which a usergroup 
is restricted; this domain will be the only one that users of this group can log in 
through, and will be the only website they can access and edit. If we have IP lock 
enabled (via the install tool), then the Disable IP lock for user setting is useful for 
users who access TYPO3 via dial-up connections, otherwise this option has no effect. 
If a user signs in from a dial-up connection that frequently changes the user's IP 
address, then their login will expire as TYPO3 will assume they are someone else 
on another machine. This option will prevent the problem, but is less secure. Enable 
this option only if you believe it is necessary, for instance if you get complaints from 
a dial-up user who is having troubles logging into TYPO3. The Admin option will 
make the user a TYPO3 administrator, giving them full access to the system. Be very 
careful about using this option, it is wise to have only one admin user.
Personal Details
We now need some personal details for our user—name, email address, and 
default language:
The default language setting is a nice touch. If the user only understands a language 
that is not the default language, we can apply it here, saving them the need to 
struggle to find the setting themselves when the instructions are in a foreign 
language to them.

User Management
[ 132 ]
Permissions
Similarly to the usergroups options, we have the module permissions. We can select 
the modules that we are allowing our user to access, and can undo the changes 
using the clock-like icon at the top of the list. Holding down Ctrl while selecting 
the options will allow us to select more than one module. The list of modules is 
displayed in the screenshot:
Workspaces are exactly the same as they were for usergroups.
If we wish to use the DB Mounts and File Mounts options set in the group 
permissions, we set these two options in the Mount from groups section, or we can 
select the mounts from the separate boxes, as shown in the screenshot:

Chapter 6
[ 133 ]
The next set of permission settings is unique to user accounts, and not settable via 
the usergroups. We have various file-operation permissions:
By default, users can upload, copy, move, delete, create new, edit, and unzip files, 
and also can move, delete, rename, and create new directories. There is also the 
option to copy a directory, and the option to recursively delete directories, which 
we looked at in the user preferences. This will allow the user to set how many levels 
they wish to be deleted when they delete a page or a folder.
TSconfig
Again we have the TSconfig option. This is an advanced option, and allows us to 
add additional permissions. We enter the configuration in the form of TypoScript, 
which is a configuration mechanism built into TYPO3. This option is the same as 
with user accounts.
General Options
The final options are to disable the user account, and to set start and stop times for 
the account, as shown in the screenshot:

User Management
[ 134 ]
We may wish to disable an account if we are creating it in advance; we can enable it 
when required. The Disable button allows us to do just that! The Start and Stop date 
settings are really useful here.
Say, we have temporary staff, working over the Christmas season at our Durham 
Electrics store. We can create a number of accounts that start on the first of December 
and end on New Year's Eve (these accounts will operate only during the mentioned 
period). The format of the date is DD-MM-YY; so for our Christmas staff we would 
tick the Start box and set the date to 01-12-2006 and tick the Stop box and set the 
date to 31-12-2006.
Once we have completed the form, we can save it using the save button at the bottom.
Editing Back-End Users
Within the Tools module, we have a User Admin area to manage and edit our 
back-end users, as shown in the screenshot:
This then takes us to the Backend User Administration page. We have a huge list 
of options and these are used if we wish to compare our users. So, we can group the 
users by setting the Main user group option, and the users from each group will be 
listed together. 

Chapter 6
[ 135 ]
This option is shown in the screenshot:
The results of the grouping of the users are listed in the RESULT section; by default, 
users are grouped alphabetically, and all users are displayed. Here is the screenshot:

User Management
[ 136 ]
We can create a new back-end user from here too, by clicking the New record button 
that is placed on the right of the Usernames heading. Going from left to right, the 
icons next to each username are as follows:
Show information
Edit
Disable
Delete
Switch to
Switch back
The Show information button opens a new pop-up window containing useful 
information about the user, as shown in the screenshot:
This is useful if we wish to get a quick overview of the user.
•

Chapter 6
[ 137 ]
The Edit button takes us to the edit screen, which is a replica of the New User screen, 
except that the fields are populated with the data we have already added for this 
user. So, the edit section allows us to change:
Username
Password
Group
Domain lock
IP lock
Admin rights
Personal details (name, email address, and language)
Module permissions
Language permissions
Workspace permissions
DB and File mounts
Fileoperations
TSconfig
General options
If we disable the user, then they are no longer able to log in to TYPO3; this is an 
action that we can undo later. This may be useful if a member of the staff has been 
suspended from work, and is not permitted to alter the website during this time. 
If we delete users, then the only way to allow them to access TYPO3 again is to 
manually recreate the users.
We can see what the TYPO3 back end is like for a particular user, by switching to that 
user account (identical to user simulation mentioned earlier). We can then swap back 
to our original user account using the switch back button.

[ 138 ]
Editing Back-End Usergroups
The easiest way to manage and edit back-end usergroups is via the List view in the 
Web module.
Under the Group option for the user, we have the option to edit the selected group, 
create a new group, or list the groups. If we click the List groups button, we are 
taken to a screen that lists the groups, so we can manage and edit them easily. Here 
is the screenshot:

Chapter 6
[ 139 ]
The groups are listed at the top under back-end usergroups. We can gain an 
overview of which groups have particular values for particular settings, by selecting 
some settings to compare from the list beneath the groups, and clicking Set fields. 
For instance, by selecting Grouptitle, Disable, and Modify options, and then 
clicking the Set fields button, the back-end usergroup table gains these fields to 
compare the different groups. Here is the screenshot:
If we click on a group's icon, we get the context menu, which we often see in the 
page tree view:

User Management
[ 140 ]
From this menu we can create new groups, edit the group, and display information 
on disabling and deleting the group. Unfortunately, the edit button in this menu 
does not appear to work! So to edit a group's properties, we can select the properties 
from the list, click Set Fields, and then click the edit button associated with that field. 
Here is the screenshot displaying the result:
It will then allow us to edit this particular setting for all groups. Here is the screenshot 
displaying our back-end usergroup with specified settings:
Summary
In this chapter, we have explored many of TYPO3's user management features. 
We have set up some usergroups with a specific role; for example, to act as content 
editors or as content approvers. We have created some users who are members of 
these groups and we have looked into how we manage these users and groups.

Site Administration
Now that we have our site up and running, and we have set up our users to manage 
the content for us, it is time to look at keeping our website running. In this chapter, 
we will learn:
Why backing up is important and best practices with backups
How to back up
How to restore
About workflows 
About workspaces
The Importance of Backing Up and Best 
Practices
All web applications and web servers have security vulnerabilities and there is 
every change that our website will be compromized. Most web hosts have their own 
backup procedures in place, but it is not uncommon for a web host to become victim 
to an attack, and have problems with a small percentage of its customer backups. 
Because of this it is very important that we keep backups of our website.
Backing Up: Best Practices
Backing up is very important. We should back up regularly and ensure we take 
proper precautions with our backups.
•
•
•
•
•

Site Administration
[ 142 ]
Back Up Frequency
The frequency with which a website needs backing up really depends on how often 
the website is updated. For a small website that is not updated very often, it should 
be done each week. The backups should be copied to a separate location, so that we 
always have two copies of a backup at any point of time. It is also recommended 
to archive a copy of each backup, so that if we break a section of our website later 
(which we do not notice for a few weeks), we can restore from an archived copy.
Backing Up Your Site
Now that we know why we need to back up our site regularly, it is time to look into 
actually creating a backup of our TYPO3 website.
What Needs Backing Up?
We need to back up:
The TYPO3 files
A copy of the database
These two things make up our TYPO3 installation. We need the database as it 
contains the website's content and records of the website's users. We need the TYPO3 
files as they contain the website's settings in the configuration files, copies of the 
website's design, and copies of data that has been cached by TYPO3.
Backing Up the TYPO3 Files
Depending on the operating system we are using, there are a number of different 
ways in which we can back up the files from TYPO3. Under this section, we will look 
into backing up the files on Windows and on Linux. This is because we looked at 
the Windows Installer for setting up a local copy of TYPO3, and Linux is the most 
popular hosting environment for websites.
Backing Up Our Files on Windows
In Windows, we can easily create a compressed file containing all the TYPO3 files 
(known as a ZIP file), using the Windows Compressed Folder tool, or a program 
such as WinZip.
•
•

Chapter 7
[ 143 ]
Provided we've used the default installation path, TYPO3 will be located in the 
folder C:\Program Files\Typo3_4.0.2\Apache\ and the folder that we want to 
compress is typo3_src. We could just back up the fileadmin, typo3conf, and 
uploads folders. This way, should we lose our entire website, we can simply restore 
the whole thing instead of having to restore TYPO3 and then our extra TYPO3 files.
Now that we have a backup, we should copy it to a separate location (preferably on 
an external disk, or on another computer) for safe keeping.
Backing Up Our Files on Linux or Linux Hosting
We can create a complete backup of our home directory on a Linux hosting 
environment. This home directory contains all of our files on the hosting account. 
Alternatively, we can run a simple command to compress a particular folder.
If we have a web hosting account that provides us with access to the cPanel hosting 
control panel, we can use that to generate a backup of our entire website (except for 
the database—which is done separately via cPanel).
To access the backup utilities, we need to log in to cPanel, which is located at 
www.ourdomain.com/cpanel, and then enter our hosting account's username and 
password. In cPanel, we have the backup option on the main screen, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Site Administration
[ 144 ]
The Backups section has a number of options, but the one that we want is the 
Download a home directory Backup. This will generate a backup of all the files of 
our website and allow us to download it.
In the previous screenshot, there is a warning message. This is because my web 
server does not have the option to back up the entire server, just an individual 
user's webspace.
The backup tool then takes a moment or two of processing, and then prompts us to 
download the backup file.

Chapter 7
[ 145 ]
Command-Line Backup
To create a backup via the command line, we need to have SSH access to the server 
that is hosting our website. SSH is a protocol that allows us to remotely administer 
another machine using the command line.
We can use a program such as Putty to connect to the server. We can download 
Putty from http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/. Putty 
only needs to be downloaded, after which it can be run straight away, and does not 
require to be installed.
When we open the program, we are presented with a screen similar to the one shown 
in the following screenshot. We enter the server's address (i.e. the web address) into 
the Host Name box and then click on Open.

Site Administration
[ 146 ]
Putty will then try to connect to the server, and will prompt us to enter our username 
and password, as shown in the following screenshot:
Once we are connected, we can type two commands to back up our site. The f﻿irst is 
to navigate to the folder that contains our TYPO3 installation. This depends entirely 
on the server's setup and your username, but is generally /home/the first 8 
characters of your web address/public_html (you should contact your web host 
for more information or if you need help). 
Once we are in the correct folder, we can use the tar command to compress our 
TYPO3 folder to a single file named TYPO3.
cd /home/michaelp/public_html/
tar cvzf file.tar.gz typo3
Now that we have our backup created, we can download it from 
www.ourwebaddress.com/file.tar.gz (where we will be prompted to save the 
file). We should then delete this from our server once we have downloaded it.
Backing Up the Database
There are three simple ways to back up the database. We can either use the 
web-based interface, phpMyAdmin, or if we do not have phpMyAdmin and 
are using a Linux hosting environment, we can run a simple command to export 
the database to a file that we can download. The final option is to use the cPanel 
database backup tool on a Linux hosting platform.
Using phpMyAdmin
phpMyAdmin is something that comes installed with the TYPO3 Winstaller and is 
installed on most hosting environments. The installation provided by the TYPO3 
Winstaller is located at http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/.

Chapter 7
[ 147 ]
From here, we can select the database that we want to back up from the left-hand 
side drop-down list, and then select the Export option.
We are then taken to a screen that details the structure of the database, and gives us a 
number of options at the top of the page (as shown in the following screenshot).

Site Administration
[ 148 ]
We want the Export option, as we are going to export the database to a file.
From the Export window, we can select the tables we wish to export. We should 
select all of them, and then select the Save as file option, and then either the zipped 
or gzipped option to save disk space, before pressing the Go button, which will then 
prompt us to download the database export file. The rest of the options should be 
left at their default values. If we are going to create a backup that we want to restore 
on top of an existing installation, we should use the Add DROP TABLE option (to 
remove the existing information from the database).
We can then save the file, and store it in a secure location, preferably on an external 
drive, or on a separate machine.
Using Simple Commands
Again using Putty, we can use some simple commands to export the database to a file. 
Once we have logged in to the server using Putty, we can use the following command:
mysqldump -u username -p databasename > /home/michaelp/public_html/
backup.sql

Chapter 7
[ 149 ]
We need to replace username with the MySQL username and databasename with 
the name of the database. Once we have entered the command and hit the Enter key, 
we will be prompted for our MySQL password.
The command takes the database and exports it to the file backup.sql 
in the public_html folder, so we can then download the file from 
http://www.ourdomain.com/backup.sql. Again, once we have downloaded 
this backup file we should delete it from the server.
Using the cPanel Utility
To access the backup utilities, we need to log in to cPanel, which is located at 
www.ourdomain.com/cpanel, and then enter our hosting account's username and 
password. From here, we have the backup option on the main screen.
The Backups section has a number of options. The one that we want is Download a 
MySQL Database Backup. Beneath that is a list of the available databases.
From the list, we can select the database that we want to download, and then we will 
be prompted to save the file at a secure location.

Restoring Your Site from a Backup
Now that we have learned how to back up our websites, we need to look into 
restoring them; otherwise the backups would be worthless.
Restoring the Files
There are two ways to restore your files: we can unzip them on our computer and 
import the home directory backup using our hosting control panel, or upload the ZIP 
file to our website and run a simple command to unpack the files.
Restoring the Files on Windows
We need to extract the files from our backup to our installation of TYPO3, which is at 
C:\Program Files\Typo3_4.0.1\Apache\typo3. 
Restoring the Files on Linux or Linux Hosting
The easiest method for restoring our files is to restore a complete home directory 
backup that we have made on our hosting account.
Within the Backups section, we want the Restore a Home Directory Backup area, 
where we can browse for our backup file and then click on Upload.

Chapter 7
[ 151 ]
This will then completely erase the content of the website, and replace it with that 
in the backup. It might be worth creating a backup just before we do this in case we 
restore the wrong thing.
The other option for restoring files on our Linux hosting environment is to upload 
the files to our server using FTP and then, using Putty (which we have discussed 
earlier), run a simple command to restore the files. The command is shown below, 
but we need to replace file.tar with the name of the file we have uploaded.
tar -xvf file.tar
Remember, restoring files is only half of the process; we still need to restore 
our database!
Restoring the Database
Similar to backing up the database, we can either use phpMyAdmin or some simple 
commands to restore the database.
Using phpMyAdmin
If we log in to phpMyAdmin, which we have looked at earlier, and select the 
database from the left-hand drop-down list, we have some options at the top. We 
need the Import option shown in the following screenshot:
This takes us to the import page, where we can browse for our backup.
Once we have selected the backup, we can press the Go button. This will then 
upload our backup and execute the commands stored within, restoring our data.

Site Administration
[ 152 ]
Using Simple Commands
If phpMyAdmin is not available, we can upload the SQL file and restore it using a 
simple command (when logged into the server via Putty, which we have looked at 
earlier). The command is shown below:
mysql -u username -p typo3database < /home/michaelp/backup.sql
We need to replace username with our MySQL username, typo3database with the 
name of our TYPO3 database, and the present path with the correct path where we 
have uploaded our backup file.
Using our Hosting Control Panel
The easiest method for restoring our database is to restore a backup using the cPanel 
backup functions.
To access the restore utilities, we need to log in to cPanel, which is located at www.
ourdomain.com/cpanel, and then enter our hosting account's username and 
password. From here, we have the backup option on the main screen, which contains 
the restore features as well as the backup features!
Within this section, we want the Restore a MySQL Database area, where we can 
browse for our backup file and then click on Upload.
This will then upload our file and restore the backup!
Workflows
Workflows allow us to set up tasks that have reviewer users and members assigned 
to them. They also provide the tools for completing the tasks within the workflow 
itself. For example, a workflow to create new pages for new products would be 
assigned to an appropriate member of the staff, with their manager as the reviewer 
user. When the user starts the task, the Create new page option within the product 
page will automatically open. 
The workflow also contains information on what should happen to the task on 
completion. We could set it so that once work for the workflow has been reviewed 
and finalized it is then transferred to a live state.

Chapter 7
[ 153 ]
Creating a Workflow
Let us create a workflow to assign users to add more information to the Service 
Center page of our TYPO3 site.
In this example workflow, we require two back-end user 
groups. The groups Editors and Content Writers have been 
used in this example. You should first create these groups, 
using Chapter 6 as a reference.
To create a new workflow, we need to go to the New record screen. We can do this 
by clicking on the globe in the File tree and then selecting New from the menu that 
pops up underneath.
From here we then click on Workflow to create a new workflow.
This will take you to the screen shown in the following screenshot:

Site Administration
[ 154 ]
Under the General tab, we can select if we wish to activate or deactivate the 
workflow and also enter a title and a description. Note that the Title field is 
mandatory, as indicated by the yellow exclamation mark next to the field. I've 
entered a title to reflect the purpose of this workflow, and a description too; however, 
I have not checked the Deactivated field as we wish to use the workflow.
Under the table tab, we have the options for Table, Draft page, and Existing record. 
The Table list defines which type of record or content the workflow deals with; for 
instance, this could be either a page, page content, or even a website user. To select 
an option, we can either select the option from the drop-down list, or click on the 
appropriate icon from underneath. For our workflow, we wish for content to be 
added to the page, so we select Pagecontent from the table field. 
We are going to save the draft content to the Our Service Center page, and then once 
approved, have the content appear live on the same page. We select that page by 
clicking on the folder icon next to the fields, and choosing the page to add it to the 
Draft page and Existing record options.

Chapter 7
[ 155 ]
The roles tab allows us to assign groups who can assign the workflow to other users 
via the To do list section in the task center. We can also assign which groups are 
allowed to be assigned to this workflow and finally the review users who can review 
the data before it is finalized by the owner. I have selected Editors as the group that 
can assign the workflow to users, and Content Editors as the group who can be 
assigned the workflow.

Site Administration
[ 156 ]
To assign the review user, we need to select them by clicking on the folder icon next 
to the field. If the window that pops up does not list the back-end users, we need to 
click on the text at the root of our page tree. This will refresh the window with the 
users inside it.

Chapter 7
[ 157 ]
The final setting tab for workflows is the misc tab, which allows us to define what 
happens to the data once it is completed, and the permissions for that data. We wish 
for the content to be visible on the website, so we need to select the Unhide when 
finalizing option.
Now that we have entered all of the data, we just need to click on the save button to 
save the workflow.

Site Administration
[ 158 ]
Assigning the Workflow as a Task
Firstly, we need to be logged in as a user who has permissions to assign the 
workflow. Then, to create a task using a workflow, we go to the Task center under 
the User module.
Within the task center, we can create a new task using a workflow. Here, we can 
select our newly created New Service Center content workflow.
This then presents us with the CREATE NEW TO-DO screen to create the item. We 
select the user from the Target user list, which automatically contains only users 
who are a part of the Content Writers group. Then, we can enter a deadline. The 
drop-down box next to the deadline lists items such as Today and Tomorrow to 
automatically generate a date for us. Finally, we should enter a description and click 
on the Create button.

Chapter 7
[ 159 ]
On some of these pages, you may notice some tables of 
system data and error messages along the lines of 'Cannot 
Modify Header Information'. This appears to be from a bug 
within TYPO3; however, the feature functions fully despite 
the error messages.
Completing the Task
If we now log in as the user we assigned the task to, we should see the item in our 
To Do list.
 
Now, if we click on the task, we are taken to the log for that task.

Site Administration
[ 160 ]
Since we are going to start work on this task, we want to apply the Begin task now 
status to it. Alternatively, we could pass it on to another user or group to do, or reject 
the task and not do it.
Next, we select the target user for the task, which in this case should be our reviewer.
Finally, we enter a note into the Status note box such as a note to indicate that we are 
starting the task, and then click on the Add Status button.

Chapter 7
[ 161 ]
Once we have selected the status and clicked on the Add Status button, we are taken 
to a page to actually create the content. This happens because the task was assigned 
through a workflow.
The options at the top allow us to specify the language, which column on the page 
we use, and even the amount of space before and after the content. We can set the 
header to be a link or just a normal heading, and we can display a particular date 
with the heading. The text options are the same as with the rich text editor.
Once we have finished the content and we have saved it, we can then set the task as 
complete and send it to the reviewer.

Site Administration
[ 162 ]
Reviewing the Task
Now that we have completed the task, let us look at reviewing it. We need to first log 
in as a reviewer user. Once we have had a look at the content and are happy with it, 
we can then approve the content.
Once I have saved the content, I am taken to the task center. As I am also the 
reviewer of the task, I can now assign a published status to the content and mark it 
as finalized, as shown in the following screenshot:
Now when we go to the Service Center page, we should see the content we 
have created.
Workflow Review
As you can see, the addition of workflows to the task center allows users to assign 
tasks to users, and actually control the flow of the work done through this task. 
Without the workflow, we would only have a log, and not the physical process tied 
to the log. Of course, there are uses for the To Do list without using the workflow, 
like reminding other users of things such as meetings, events, or tasks that do not 
directly relate to the website.

Chapter 7
[ 163 ]
Workspaces
A workspace allows groups of users to work together to process draft content. There 
is a comprehensive guide to workspaces and versioning on the TYPO3 website, 
http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/core-documentation/
doc_core_inside/current/view/3/7/. 
Here, we will take a brief look at this feature!
Note that there is no relation between a workflow and 
a workspace. These are two separate things entirely; 
however, they can be used in tandem. For instance, we 
could have our workspace containing new pages that are 
not public, and use a workflow to allocate the tasks of 
adding the content to these pages.
Creating a Workspace
Let us create a development workspace, where we will keep pages for a new section 
meant for resellers, who are going to resell the store's stock. We will need a new page 
to head this section, such as 'Resellers', which is not visible to the public.
To create a new workspace, we need to go to the New record screen, which we can 
do by clicking on the globe, the file tree, and then selecting New from the menu that 
pops up underneath.

Site Administration
[ 164 ]
From here, we then click on Workspace to create a new workspace:
This will take you to the screen shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
[ 165 ]
The first four options are for the Title (which is mandatory), a description, owners, 
and members.
Let us call our workspace Resellers and enter an appropriate description. The store 
manager, who is also the administrator, is the owner of the workspace. He has 
delegated the users John and mkpeacock to work on the section.
The Owners can add new Members or reviewers to the workspace, and Members 
are back-end users (or groups) who can use the workspace.

Site Administration
[ 166 ]
Next, we have Reviewers, Status change notification by email, DB Mounts, and 
File Mounts. The Reviewers are users or groups who are allowed to approve work 
from the workspace for publication. The notification setting will email members 
of the workspace when a user has changed some of the content from within the 
workspace. The database and file mounts must be accessible from the user's own 
personal mounts (see previous chapter); otherwise, they will not be available to 
them. We will set the administrator to be a reviewer, request no notification, and use 
a DB mount of the Resellers page.
Finally, we have Publish, Un-publish, Freeze Editing, Allow Live Editing, Disable 
auto-versioning when editing, Swap modes, Disable Versioning Types, and 
Publish Access.

Chapter 7
[ 167 ]
The Publish option allows us to set a time at which the content of the workspace 
will be published, and Un-publish is for a time at which the content will be 
un-published. For instance, if we have a workspace for a team to work on a section 
of the website, set up for the Christmas period, we may want to turn it on at the 
start of December, and turn it off in the New Year. 
Freeze Editing disables editing from within the workspace, protecting its content. 
The live editing option is for records introduced by extensions that do not support 
versioning. Changes to these will be made available in the front end immediately. 
The Swap mode means that, on publication, the workspace is made live and the 
content that was there becomes the workspace content. We can disable the content 
versioning using the Disable Versioning Types option.
Finally, we can set how the content is published: either when the content is in the 
correct stage, or only if the workspace owner approves the content.
Let us set this website to go live on the first of March ready for the store's reseller 
programme. We do not wish to un-publish the content, and so we can leave that.
Using the Workspace
Once a workspace has been created, a user who is a member of the workspace can 
use the workspace by selecting it from the workspace selector in the back end.
When using the workspace, content created will have settings from the 
workspace applied.
Content from the configured DB mount, is the only content available in the workspace. 
The following screenshot shows the page tree when using the new workspace.

Site Administration
[ 168 ]
Users can be locked to workspaces too, via the user settings discussed in the 
previous chapter.
Summary
In this chapter, we have looked at why it is important to back up our data, and how 
we can back up our TYPO3 website. We have also looked at restoring the site with 
the help of these backups, should we ever be in a situation where we needed to do 
this. Finally, we looked at the workflow and workspace features and how they can 
be useful to us.

Extending TYPO3
We have our website set up, we know how to manage and edit the content, we have 
set up users to manage our content, and we have looked at the basics of keeping our 
site running. Now, it is time to look into extending our TYPO3 installation. In this 
chapter, we will learn:
How the TYPO3 extension manager works
How to use the extension manager
About some of the extensions that we may find useful
What is the TYPO3 Extension Manager?
The TYPO3 extension manager provides a central area in which we can install or 
uninstall new features for our TYPO3 installation. The extension manager was added 
to TYPO3 to organize the TYPO3 system core. Now, features that do not make up the 
core system can be plugged into the system as extensions. 
Extensions can be developed by third parties, leaving the core functionality to the 
core developers, thus allowing anyone to add features that are not available out of 
the box.
Accessing the Extension Manager
To access the extension manager, we just need to click on Ext Manager from the 
Tools menu:
•
•
•

Extending TYPO3
[ 170 ]
When we access the extension manager for the first time, we are presented with the 
translation handler. This allows us to manage the translations of labels, in the system, 
and from extensions. To get to the main extension manager interface, we just need to 
select Install extensions from the drop-down menu. We will cover the other options 
seen in this menu, throughout this chapter.
From now on, clicking on the Ext Manager from the main menu will automatically 
take us to the main interface. This will only change if we go to another area of the 
extension manager without returning to the main interface afterwards, as it saves the 
last used section.
Extension Manager Interface
The main TYPO3 extension manager interface is shown in the following screenshot, 
and is accessed by clicking on Ext Manager on the main menu.

Chapter 8
[ 171 ]
This view is grouped by the category, but we can change the grouping using the 
Group by option at the top of the page.
The Show options change the information displayed in the table of extensions. By 
default, we have the details view, which displays the following:
Installed Status
Icon
Title
Extension Key
Version Number
Download Link
Documentation
Type Name
State
There are three different installed statuses: Installed, Not Installed, and Required.
The installed status is a green circle with a minus symbol within; we can click on 
the symbol if we wish to remove the extension. The not installed status is a grey 
symbol with a plus sign within; we can install that particular extension by clicking 
on the symbol. The required symbol is the letters Rq in red. This symbol does not do 
anything as the extensions that are classed as required are required by the system 
and thus cannot be removed.
The icon displayed next to each extension is an icon representing the extension. For 
instance, the Internal notes extension has a logo of a note.
The Title briefly explains the extension in a few words, and the Extension key is a key 
that uniquely identifies an extension. Extension developers must register their extension 
keys with the TYPO3 website. For more information, see the extension key web page on 
the typo3.org website: http://typo3.org/extensions/extension-keys/.
The extension's Version Number allows developers to keep track of versions of their 
extensions; so we can ensure that we have the most recent version installed.

Extending TYPO3
[ 172 ]
The Download link (DL) allows us to download a copy of the extension to our 
computer. If there is the option for us to download a particular extension, then there 
is the icon of a floppy disk in that column of the extensions table. If the extension 
has documentation associated with it, we can download that too, by clicking on the 
document icon.
The type of extension indicates if the extension is a Local, System, or Global 
extension. System extensions are related to the back end and its features, and local 
extensions are related to the front end, or back-end features that add features to the 
front end. 
Finally, the state indicates the state of the software with regards to its development 
and stability. Extensions that are marked as Stable, have been tested and are suitable 
for use in a production environment; other statuses such as Beta indicate that the 
software may contain bugs and may not function correctly.
Be careful if you decide to use an extension that is not Stable, 
as there may be some problems—so use it with caution.
Importing Downloaded Extensions
There are a lot more extensions available than are shown in the main interface. We can 
also download extensions from other websites and then import them into the system.
The typo3.org website has a huge repository of extensions that we can browse at 
http://typo3.org/extensions/.

Chapter 8
[ 173 ]
The extensions available on the website are listed in tables describing them in more 
detail. We can download an extension by clicking on the extension's name, and then 
on the following page, clicking on Download compressed extension .T3X file. 
Once we have an extension downloaded, we can import it from the Import 
extensions section of the extension manager, which can be accessed from the menu 
at the top.
From this area, we can either look up an extension in an online repository (see 
further on in this chapter for details in extension manager settings), or upload a file 
directly to our server.

Extending TYPO3
[ 174 ]
To upload an extension, we just need to select the file from our computer using 
the Browse… button and then click on the Upload extension file button. Once the 
extension has been uploaded, we will be presented with a screen informing us of the 
action that has been taken. If the extension is not successfully uploaded, then we will 
see an error message on this screen.
From this page, we also have the option to install the extension by clicking on the 
Install extension link. The extension is also added to the main extension manager 
interface; so we can install or remove the extension from there at a later date.
Installing an Extension
As we saw earlier, to install an extension, we just need to click on the install icon next 
to the extension. The extensions listed here are the ones already on our server, either 
by default, or ones that we have downloaded.
Most extensions require additional changes to be made to the database, so that the 
data relevant, or necessary to the extension, can be installed. Once we have clicked 
on the install icon, the next page displays database changes that need to be made in 
order for the extension to be installed. The full explanation of the changes that the 
extension will make is shown.

Chapter 8
[ 175 ]
Finally, the extension also requests us to clear the TYPO3 cache in order to function 
correctly. If we were to deselect the checkbox, we would have to manually clear 
the TYPO3 cache later. Once we have reviewed the changes the extension wishes to 
make, and are happy with them, clicking on the Make updates button will complete 
the extension installation.
Different extensions enable different features, some with the back end and some with 
the front end of the system, and are used and accessed in different ways. We will 
have a look at some specific extensions and how to use them, later in the chapter.

Extending TYPO3
[ 176 ]
Uninstalling an Extension
To uninstall an extension, we just need to click on the icon next to the extension's 
name, as we saw earlier.
As was the case when installing an extension, the extension manager needs to update 
the database, and the following confirmation page informs us of this. If we are happy 
to go ahead with the un-installation, we just need to click on Remove extension.
Extension Manager Settings and Repositories
Let us take a look at the extension manager's settings, and information regarding the 
extension repository. To get to the settings page, we need to select Settings from the 
drop-down menu at the top of the extension manager.

Chapter 8
[ 177 ]
The settings page allows us to control which mirror of the extension repository we 
are connecting our extension manager to. When we were looking into importing 
extensions, there was an option to import from a repository. A repository is an online 
collection of extensions that TYPO3 can remotely connect to and access. The first two 
sections of the settings page are user and security settings.
The Security Settings option will allow us to enable extensions that have not been 
reviewed. This option is not enabled, by default, to increase security. It is advised 
that we leave this setting as it is.
The second section is for User Settings. This is used when we are uploading 
extensions to the repository, or if we are accessing a private repository.

Extending TYPO3
[ 178 ]
The final section on the settings page is for mirrors. A mirror is a website that has a 
copy of the extension repository. Mirrors are used to reduce load on a central site, 
and to provide faster connections. The Mirror list URL is a web page that contains 
a list of mirrors, which is by default the typo3.org mirror list. Below that, we have 
a list of mirrors, and the default mirror is set to randomly choose among the list of 
mirrors. This again reduces load on a central mirror, and reduces error if one mirror 
is broken. If there is another repository we would like to access, we can enter it into 
the Repository URL box, to override the use of a mirror.
Extending Our Site
Now that we have had a look at the extension manager, let's look at how we could 
extend our example website for the electrical shop. As I mentioned earlier, different 
extensions are accessed and used in different ways; more information on individual 
extensions can be found in their respective documentation files. Looking at the 
following extensions, however, should provide you with an overview of how to use 
other extensions.

Chapter 8
[ 179 ]
We will install, configure, and use the following extensions:
Shop system
Rating
Message board
Simple hit statistics
Currently, our website only provides information on products. To purchase 
products, a customer has to either visit a branch, or call a branch, to see if he or she 
can purchase by phone. However, there is an extension within TYPO3 providing 
Shop-system functionality.
To provide customers an overview of what other customers thought of a particular 
product or service, we could install a Rating extension.
A customer could tell a friend about a product; for that we could install the Tip-A-
Friend extension. 
We could even install a Message board to act as an online support medium for 
customers to communicate with staff members.
Those new features will make a much better user experience, but there are also 
extensions that benefit us, as TYPO3 Administrators. For instance, we could install 
the simple Hit statistics extension to have some simple statistics of page views, so 
that we could see which products on our website were most popular!
Shop System
Although there is a version of the shop system available for us to install with the 
click of a button (provided we used the Winstaller), this version is out of date. We 
can either download the newer version or use a different extension all together.
The extension we are going to install is called Webformat Shop System, and has 
the extension key extendedshop. We first need to install the extension tt_address, 
which is in the extension manager. Then, we can download the shop extension 
from the TYPO3 repository, http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/
extendedshop/2.0.3/, and import it, as shown earlier in the chapter.

Extending TYPO3
[ 180 ]
Once the import is complete, we can install it directly (from the page informing us 
that the import has been completed), by clicking on the install icon.
If we've used the Winstaller to install this version of TYPO3, then we may get an 
error telling us that the store requires an older version of PHP. The extension will 
still run fine; so we can safely set the option to ignore this, and try again.
Configuring
To actually set up and use our shop system we need to:
1.	 Create a page to list our products
2.	 Create some products
3.	 Create a product-listing on the page
4.	 Create a shopping basket page
5.	 Change some settings
Creating Our Page and a Product
Within our products page, let's create a new page called Buy Online, which will list 
all of the products. From here, we need to click on the page's icon and select New, so 
that we can add the product to the page. If we do not add the product to the page, 
the page will not correctly list the products.

Chapter 8
[ 181 ]
We then select Webformatshop - Products to add the new product.
We will now create a product item for a television set.
We don't want to hide the product; so we leave the Hide option unchecked. If this 
was a seasonal item, we could set when we wanted the product to be available, using 
the Start and Stop fields. We enter an item number in the Itemnumber field, a title 
for the product's name, and a title for the product's page itself.

Extending TYPO3
[ 182 ]
We should enter a short description of the product in the Summary box. After that, 
we have a large Description box, where we can enter a long description of the 
product using the RTE (rich text editor).
Next we can upload an image of the product, set the price before and after tax, and 
set if the product is in stock, and if so, how many items are in stock. The remaining 
options allow us to set different sizes, colors, and sale prices, useful for products 
such as clothing.
Creating the Product Listing
Now that we have a product for our store, we need to tell the Buy Online page to list 
all of the products linked to it. To do this, we add a new page content element. The 
type of content we wish to add is a Webformat Shop System.

Chapter 8
[ 183 ]
We need to enter a heading for the content. The Plugin section will automatically say 
Webformat Shop System, which is the plugin the content element is utilizing, and 
we need to set the View mode to Products list from the drop-down list.
If we now look at the Buy Online page, we have our product listed there.
Clicking on the product's name or ID will take us to a detailed page describing 
the product, providing us with the option to add the product to our (currently 
non-existent) shopping cart.

Extending TYPO3
[ 184 ]
Creating the Shopping Basket
Firstly, we need to create a new page; so let's create a Basket page under our Buy 
Online page. Within this page, we add a new content element, which is of the type 
Webformat Shop System (just like the products listing page), except we set the View 
mode to Basket.
We now have a shopping basket. The only problem is that the products pages don't 
know that the shopping basket exists, and so, won't be able to add products to the 
basket. To do that, we need to change some settings.
Changing the Settings
There are two settings we need to change: the first is the ID number of the shopping 
basket page, and the second is how we will accept payment. For the payment, we 
will use PayPal, although there are other options available.
The Basket page's ID number is the ID shown in the address bar of your web browser. 
The address should contain ?ID=XX, this XX is the ID number.
To enter the ID number, we need to select the product page in the back end, and then 
click on the Template section in the menu, to edit the template settings for the page. 
From here, we need to select Constant editor from the drop-down list at the top right 
of the page. When the page reloads, we select WEBFORMAT SHOP SYSTEM from 
the Category drop-down list.
When the page reloads again, we need to check the box for Pid basket, and then click 
on Update, to reload the page. The page is then reloaded, and we enter the page's ID 
number in the text box that is now displayed next to the Pid basket option. Once we 
have entered this, we then click on Update once again.
Although this has now updated the setting, to update the pages to use the new 
setting, we need to then click on the Clear all cache link at the bottom of the

The payment data is stored in a separate file. We need to open 
c:\Program Files\TYPO3_4.0.2\Apache\typo3_src\typo3conf\ext\
extendedshop\ext_typoscript_setup.txt. On line 157 of this page, the PayPal 
email address is set. We should change this to reflect our PayPal address.
Once we have changed this, we need to clear the cache as we did with the basket ID 
setting. Once we have done that, users will be able to add products to the shopping 
cart, enter their details, and click on the Pay with Paypal link. Orders are then 
managed through the Orders section in the User module.
Rating
The rating extension available in the back end is out of date. So we need to download 
this from the extension repository—the extension key is tt_rating—and then import 
it (as shown previously) before installing it.
Adding to a Page
To add the rating functionality to a page, we need to select a page and then click on 
the option to add a new content element to the page. Under the Plugins section, we 
now have the option to add a Rating to the page.

The only option that we need to change on the add content page, is the Header. This 
will be the heading for the rating section; we should call this something like Rate 
this page.
Front End
Now that we have installed and set up the rating extension for one page, we have a 
rating section on the page!
If the page has not yet been rated by someone, we have the message that the object 
has not been rated, and beneath that we have a drop-down list of rating options.
Message Board
The message board extension that is available in the back end is out of date. So 
we need to download this from the extension repository—the extension key is 
tt_board—and then import it (as shown previously), before installing it.

Adding to a Page
To add the message board to a page, we need to select a page, and then click on the 
option to add a new content element to the page. Under the Plugins section, we now 
have the option to add a Message board or Discussion forum. We should add one to 
our customer-only area for product support.
The settings on the next page are automatically populated. The only thing we need to 
add is a heading, such as DE Support Forum.
With as little work as that, we now have a working discussion forum on the page.

Front End
The visitor can create a topic by completing the form on the page, and either visitors 
or staff members can click on a particular topic and reply to a message. We could 
create a support page for each product, containing technical information, and a 
support forum.
We can manage the forum and the topics within them, from the back end. In the 
section where we can manage the content of a page, we have a section with details 
about the forum.

Clicking on the icon next to a topic brings up a menu, where we can chose to delete 
and manage forum topics.
Simple Hit Statistics
The version of this plugin that is available in the back end is out of date. So we need 
to download it from the extension repository—the extension key is sys_stat—and 
then import it (as shown previously) before installing it.
End Result
Now that we have installed the extension, we can access the statistics of pages from 
the Info module in the back end.
The drop-down menu on the right contains the option for the Hit statistics. If we 
select this option, we are then taken to the statistics section that lists all pages with 
page hits, and the time period in which they were obtained.
The two drop-down lists allow us to view statistics for the selected page, and various 
levels below that, and also change if we are viewing page hits, total hits, or hits in 
main sections.

Summary
We have looked in depth at the TYPO3 extension manager, and installed some 
extensions relevant to our website, set them up, and linked them to our site. We also 
know how to install and use extensions, and can enhance the features of our website 
easily with new powerful features.
