Preface
Security is a paradox. It is often viewed as intrusive, unwanted, a hassle, or some­
thing that limits our personal, if not professional, freedoms. While, at the same time, 
if we need security, we can never have enough. It is the intention of this book to pro­
vide security practitioners with the ability to critically examine their organizational 
environment and provide a mechanism to make it secure while assuming an optimal 
relationship between obtrusion and necessity.
Security management is a very diverse function for which security practitioners 
must plan, manage people, administer budgets, process information, as well as prepare 
for emergencies, violence, and other loss scenarios. This book is written for students 
who would like to become professional security managers, as well as for the security 
manager who wants to be a more effective administrator. Security Management: A 
Critical Thinking Approach provides a disciplined process to look at the security man­
agement functions to better tailor security to any organization.
We present the most accurately balanced picture of security functions by using 
a critical thinking approach to interpret data as a tool for providing more effective 
security management. It is not the intent of this book to attempt to instruct someone 
on how to secure an environment with technical proficiency or to merely impart facts 
pertaining to security management. Although there is commonality in many aspects 
of security and potential loss environments, all situations are going to be unique. 
The premise in this text is to create a practitioner who will completely examine the 
environment and make informed, well-thought-out judgments to tailor a security 
program to fit a specific organization.
The book will enable students to think clearly and critically about the process of 
security management. It emphasizes the ability to articulate the differing aspects 
of business and security management by reasoning through complex problems in 
the changing organizational landscape. We guide students through the stages of the 
critical thinking process to formulate a practical program for security management.
We also emphasize core security management competencies of planning, organiz­
ing, staffing, and leading while providing a process to critically analyze these func­
tions. The book stresses the benefits of using a methodical critical thinking process 
in building a comprehensive safety management system, and specifically addresses 
information security, cyber security, energy-sector security, chemical security, and 
general security management, while utilizing a critical thinking framework.
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach goes farther than other 
available books regarding security management because it not only provides funda­
mental concepts in security, but also creates informed, critical, and creative security 
managers who communicate effectively in their environment.

1 Introduction to 
Security Management
Mankind’s entry into the twenty-first century was met with a blast of insecurity. The 
United States, with the cold war over, domestic terrorism at an all-time low, and a 
thriving economy, achieved a feeling of accomplishment and content. There were 
world problems, namely, struggles in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine, 
adjustment to a global economy, and the economic and ethnic struggles in the new 
governments formed after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. That was “over there.” 
Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups had attacked U.S. people and property over­
seas: the USS Cole in Yemen, soldiers in Somalia, and U.S. Embassy bombings in 
Tanzania and Kenya. Again, that was “over there,” and we felt safe at home in the 
continental United States. On September 11, 2001, that changed. The attacks on the 
World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., as well as 
the hijacked Flight 93 crash in Pennsylvania, signaled to the citizens in the United 
States that they were not safe. Overseas, attacks on Spain and the United Kingdom 
had the effect of creating unrest throughout Europe and the free world.
People want safety at home and in the workplace. The awareness of threats 
against our communities requires us to be proactive in identifying threats. The USA 
Patriot Act (2002) and the reorganization of government under the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS) was an answer to that concern. Facility security, aware­
ness programs, and intelligence gathering and sharing are components of the effort 
to secure the homeland.
Ignoring these dangers and risks is unacceptable. Being proactive directs us to 
look at our individual communities, identify its assets, recognize potential targets, and 
develop a strategy to prioritize and plan against events, whether manmade or natural.
Physical Security is directed toward prevention. Homeland Security Presidential 
Directives established policies to strengthen the preparedness through prevention 
and organized response to terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. 
The Major Preparedness Goal is to establish measurable readiness targets that bal­
ance the threat and magnitude of terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emer­
gencies with the resources to prevent, respond to, and recover from such incidents 
(HSPD, 2011).
While DHS initiatives answer a need for government to be secure and for the 
government to identify potential threats, whether public or private, it does not fully 
answer the need of private industry in securing their facilities and operations. Private 
enterprise implements security measures as a means for maintaining a profit for 
the organization. They see terrorist threats as a loss to profit. In addition to a ter­
rorist threat, losses through internal and external crimes, espionage, fire, and other 
hazards, whether natural or manmade, are of concern to businesses and industry. 

2
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Through risk assessment and management, private enterprise identifies hazards and 
weighs the risk of not providing a level of security against the associated cost should 
an event occur. For example, the decision to purchase an insurance policy to indem­
nify a hazard is weighed against the probability of the event occurring and the con­
sequences of the event.
In addition to direct internal and external criminal threats, employee safety affects 
morale, which, in turn, impacts productivity. Unhappy customers who may attack 
employees or damage property or irate employees who retaliate against the organiza­
tion cause others to feel frightened when they go to work. Employees with domestic 
issues may cause events to flow into the workplace causing fear and loss of produc­
tivity due to stress. Likewise, downtime from workplace evacuations due to bomb 
threats, false alarms, and other disruptions add to elevated stress and low morale.
As the government seeks to protect its citizens and property, there is a need for 
additional support from private security. Private enterprise spends billions of dollars 
on security hardware: locks, alarms, fencing, closed circuit television systems, and 
other equipment in providing for a safe workplace. Governmental laws or regula­
tions, insurance requirements, and partnership agreements may cause an enterprise 
to maintain a level of security, which, in turn, fuels the need for security hardware, 
personnel, and training.
Security is about risk reduction. Whether a government agency or a private 
enterprise, physical security focuses on four main ideas: continuity of operations, 
asset retention, workplace safety, and mitigation of damages through physical loss, 
employee productivity, and lawsuits. When an event affects an operation, the time 
it takes for the organization to return to normal operations affects the ability to 
continue its mission. Loss of assets through internal or external theft, espionage, or 
waste causes loss of profit through replacement costs and increases the cost of goods 
or services to the consumer, or, even, higher taxes in government operations.
Having a workplace where employees feel safe provides them a comfort level 
that allows them to work at peak efficiency without fear. Providing a safe and secure 
facility for occupants leads to increased productivity, which lowers costs and raises 
profits. For example, an apartment or office complex must provide a safe environ­
ment to attract tenants, and a retail store must provide a safe environment to attract 
customers. If tenants or customers do not feel safe, they will take their business else­
where. In addition to these benefits, the risk of loss through lawsuits is lessened. A 
facility that implements and maintains a level of security lowers the risk of lawsuits 
and the amount of a judgment in the event of a lawsuit.
This is where a security manager steps in. The security manager must be good 
at managing and leading. The leader/manager must possess a measure of technical 
knowledge, be able to work with other people, and be able to develop and conceptu­
alize ideas. The degree of each skill varies with the position and role of the security 
manager. First-line supervisors work closely with the line staff and need more tech­
nical skill in their work activity, but less conceptual skill. Conversely, the execu­
tive would spend more time utilizing conceptual skills in moving the organization 
forward than he would his knowledge of technical operations. A midlevel manager 
would possess some technical and some conceptual skill in roughly equal amounts. 
The ability to work with others is a necessity at all levels of management.

Introduction to Security Management
Chart on Skills
We manage things; we lead people. Managing operations focuses on efficient processes and 
process control, while leaders focus on the people and creating the organizational culture.
Leadership is defined as “a process whereby an individual influences a group of indi­
viduals to achieve a common goal” (Northouse, 2006). What makes a good and effective 
leader is the ability to influence others. The leader sets the vision of the organization or 
group. The leader “sells” the vision to the group to inspire and motivate them to achieve 
specific goals. The leader communicates the goals to the group and makes clear the 
expectations in order to achieve the goals. Leaders seek commitment from the group to 
strive for the goals. They empower the group with the authority necessary to complete the 
tasks.
Managers coordinate assignments and provide the resources to allow their staff to 
perform their assignments efficiently and effectively. They provide structure and outline 
processes necessary to maximize productivity and to prevent waste.
Managers establish policy and rules to provide structure for defining work procedures.
Managers are problem solvers. They examine work processes and identify ways to elimi­
nate unnecessary tasks and streamline the workflow.

Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Law and liability, threat and risk assessment, emergency preparedness, and secu­
rity design and crime prevention through environmental design form the beginning 
of identifying a need for security awareness. The basic questions of where we are, 
where do we need to be, and how do we get there identify security needs and form 
our objective for efficient and effective security programs. Risk benefit and cost anal­
ysis round out the formula for determining security needs.
Pulling it all together, the book examines policies and procedures necessary for 
an efficient and effective security program. For all of the security systems to work, 
the overall security policy must address issues of access control: employee, visi­
tor, and package screening, and deliveries. Awareness programs must be developed 
to educate personnel on threats and security procedures. Finally, employee back­
ground checks and visitor access requirements are examined to round out the secu­
rity program.
If you do the little jobs well, the big ones will tend to take care of themselves.
Dale Carnegie
Too many times, we look at the “big picture” and fail to see the little things. We 
are prepared for the terrorist attacks, but ignore incidents we see as minor distrac­
tions or nuisances. The broken window theory teaches us that small items, such as 
broken windows, graffiti, unkempt lawns, etc., invite small crimes like trespassing 
and criminal mischief. Such activity unheeded evolves into larger activity until we 
slide down the slippery slope and find ourselves in a quagmire. Attention to detail in 
handling minor incidents will prevent many major incidents while preparing us for 
the ones we cannot stop (Figure 1.1).

Introduction to Security Management
Why Would I Provide Security?
State/federal/local laws and regulations: For example, 40 U.S. Code § 1315(c)
(1) authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security and the General Services 
Administration to establish regulations to protect government property. An 
example of a regulation would be 41CFR105-62.101, which designates secu­
rity classification categories. Also, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 
establishes a national policy for federal departments and agencies to identify and 
prioritize U.S. critical infrastructure and key resources and to protect them from 
terrorist attacks.
Insurance requirements: Insurance policies may require that certain assets be pro­
tected with a minimum level of security. Many homeowners’ policies provide a 
discount if a security system is installed.
Contract requirements: A lease may dictate a level of security in order to meet con­
tractual obligations.
Customer/supplier relationships: A customer may require that a shipper provide 
additional security when handling packages. Signature required or armored car 
services are examples of providing additional security.
Union agreements may spell out certain requirements to provide for workplace 
safety: A labor agreement may require security patrols in employee parking lots 
or assurances for safety in the workplace against workplace or domestic violence.
EXERCISE
You are assuming a new position of security manager in a relatively new com­
pany and you have never before had a security department job. Although 
some members of management understand the need for a formal security 
department, others do not. Sure, there have been losses in the company, 
but the role of security is not going to be without cost, either. It is your first 
job to meet with the departmental managers and explain to them why their 
organization needs security. Is security management an investment or just 
a requirement?

2 Security Management 
and Critical Thinking
The modern security manager should utilize critical thinking in performing the 
requirements of his/her position. However, the literature of security management 
and critical thinking methodologies is sparse. Purpura (2002) touches on the utili­
zation of critical thinking when saying that “it is not to criticize, but to be applied 
discretely to understand the security environment more adequately.” Critical think­
ing is to move the security manager past personal bias, or biases of others, to provide 
objectivity to situations. Loss prevention practitioners know that security manage­
ment is rooted in methodical processes that serve as a guide for protection. As such, 
many loss prevention processes utilize a homogenized type of critical thinking.
The critical nature of security management tools, such as risk assessments, criti­
cally and vulnerability studies, return on security program investment, and cost ben­
efit analysis, show just a glimpse in the systematic tools of the security manager. The 
risk assessment itself looks at the value of organizational assets, accounting for both 
the criticality and vulnerability of the asset to determine the amount of the security 
investment. In itself, the comprehensive process of risk analysis utilizes a process of 
critical thinking.
The intent of this chapter is to move beyond statistical loss prevention tools and to 
focus on ways the security manager can apply critical thinking skills to improve his/
her everyday performance. We will provide an understanding of the critical thinking 
process as a methodical process that the security manager should cultivate to evalu­
ate the security environment on a daily basis.
For a security manager, there is nothing more practical than a methodical process 
of thinking. For managers, good thinking pays off while poor thinking causes prob­
lems, such as wasting resources and time. Critical thinking allows security managers 
to envision their duties in a logical process while focusing on making decisions and 
solving problems.
Critical thinking should become a natural process for security managers. Schon’s 
(1983) idea of critical thinking involves the relations between theoretical and practi­
cal knowledge as a part of our daily, spontaneous, and intuitive management pro­
cesses, which become a reflection process for the security manager to instinctively 
and critically interpret a situation.
Essential for thinking about how a security manager uses critical reflection is how 
Schon (1983) describes them as a researcher and practitioner who can theorize and 
know his/her actions because of reflection. The security manager experiences revela­
tion, perplexity, or uncertainty in situations that he finds to be unknown or unique. 
The security manager reflects on the situation and on prior understandings that have 
been implicit on his/her behavior. The security manager instinctively carries out an

Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
intuitive, methodical process that serves to generate both a new understanding of the 
phenomena and a change in the situation.
In the reflective process, the security manager does not separate thinking from 
doing when coming to a decision, which he/she must later convert into action. The 
security manager is a practitioner, a researcher, who can engage his/her loss preven­
tion situations by bringing thinking and action together, by interactively and critically 
engaging the relations of means and ends in situations that are unique, difficult, and 
uncertain.
Critical thinking and reflection is much more than a cognitive process of analysis. 
Critical thinking becomes more than a form of technical rationality to a potential 
loss situation. Instead, critical thinking and reflection becomes an artistic process 
(Brookfield, 1987, p. 155). During the performance of their duties, security man­
agers may be faced with unexpected and unfamiliar situations to which they need 
to respond. They need to look at the situation and engage critical thinking so that 
it becomes a part of the collection of experiences they use to build theories and 
responses. Security managers need to observe, research, and reflect on processes 
that impact the workplace. They also need to be able to articulate their reflection-
in-action; otherwise they cannot instill the process in others (Schon, 1983, p. 243). 
All thinking and practices demand a stop-and-think period of time that constitutes 
reflection. The security manager should hone a methodology, bringing critical think­
ing, reflection, and action together, which will lead to a superior daily performance.
BACKGROUND OF CRITICAL THINKING
To arrive at a process of critical thinking that could best serve a security manager, 
examination must be provided for a better understanding of the critical thinking 
processes. Critical thinking has been expressed and defined in several ways. In the 
literature, there are several definitions and ways of conceptualizing critical think­
ing. Chance (1986) defines critical thinking as the ability to analyze facts, generate 
and organize ideas, defend opinions, make comparisons, draw inferences, evaluate 
arguments, and solve problems. Tama (1989) defines it as a way of reasoning that 
demands adequate support for one’s beliefs and an unwillingness to be persuaded 
unless support is forthcoming.
Mayer and Goodchild (1990) say that critical thinking is an active, systematic 
process of understanding and evaluating arguments. An argument provides an asser­
tion about the properties of some object or the relationship between two or more 
objects, and evidence to support or refute the assertion. Critical thinkers recognize 
that there is no one correct way to understand and evaluate influences and that all 
attempts are not successful.
Although critical thinking receives much attention in the higher education envi­
ronment, the idea is not new. John Dewey, the proponent of the progressive educa­
tion movement, is often regarded as the father of the modern critical thinking. In 
How We Think (1910), Dewey calls critical thinking reflective thought and defines 
it as “active, persistent, and careful consideration of a belief or supposed form of 
knowledge in light of the grounds which support it and the further conclusions for 

9
Security Management and Critical Thinking
which it tends” (p. 9). Dewey recognizes that what matters are the reasons we have 
for believing something and the implications of our beliefs (Fisher, 2001).
For Dewey, critical thinking is essentially an active process in which you think 
things through yourself, raise questions yourself, find relevant information your­
self, and solve problems yourself, rather than learning in a largely passive way from 
someone else. Thus, to develop critical thinking skills, individuals must be active 
learners in the learning process and they must be required to identify and solve 
unstructured problems using multiple information sources.
For a security manager, you must be able to deal with the unstructured situa­
tions that arise in the work environment. If every problem or issue that managers 
faced could be dealt with in the same structured response, they would not need to 
“think,” but merely apply their rubric to the situation and then go to the next issue. 
However, the security environment seldom exists in that scenario. While many fac­
ets of security can be addressed through proactive management tools, there is still a 
huge variation of problems the security manager deals with on a daily basis. Dewey 
roots critical thinking in the engagement with a problem (1916).
A century later, contemporary critical thinking researchers promote that by 
using context, elements, and disciplines to gain insight as well as understanding 
the issues in a deep way helps make better decisions in life (Nosich, 2012). For 
Nosich, critical thinking allows individuals to more effectively interpret infor­
mation, keep the important information with us, and actually retain information 
for future use and reference with more ease over time because the skills pro­
vided allow a person to become an active listener rather than a passive recipient 
of information.
Nosich uses an academic approach describing the technical process of critical 
thinking to assist improving individual capabilities through critical thinking. His point 
of view is that, with practicing critical thinking, we will have the following outcomes:
Whether it is in writing or reading, in analysis or evaluation, in the discipline as well 
as in your life outside school, critical thinking creates value. It takes effort, especially 
before you get used to it. But it has clear practical benefits that far exceed the effort. 
It will produce better answers, better grades, in more courses, in more professions, 
with ultimately less work, than any alternative. More than that, it gives insight that can 
make your life richer, by bringing the elements, the standards, and the disciplines into 
learning to think things through (p. 195).
If all parts of critical thinking are understood and utilized, then the security man­
ager should be checking for accuracy, identifying assumptions, drawing relevant 
conclusions, and thinking questions out in terms of the fundamental and powerful 
concepts of the discipline. Critical thinking is reflective. It is different from just 
thinking. It is metacognitive involving thinking about your thinking.
Critical thinking involves standards used as a measure for thinking. Some exam­
ples of standards are accuracy, relevance, and depth. Nosich states that “there are no 
rules that guarantee our thinking will be correct,” so the critical thinker must allow 
for “self-correcting” by evaluating the reasoning. The three parts of critical thinking 
emphasized are “asking questions … that go to the heart of the matter,” “trying to 

10
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
answer those questions by reasoning them out,” and “believing in the results of our 
reasoning” (Nosich, 2012, p. 5).
The elements of reasoning (keeping in mind context and alternatives) are, in no 
particular order because this is a circle, point of view, purpose, question at issue, 
assumptions, implications and consequences, information, concepts, conclusions, 
and interpretations (Nosich, 2012, p. 49–60).
•	 Purpose is having an objective.
•	 Question at issue can be thought of as the problem being addressed.
•	 Assumptions are everything you take for granted when you think 
through something.
•	 Implications and consequences fall into the area beyond the end of criti­
cal thinking.
•	 Information is the data, evidence, observations used during reasoning. 
Reliable information from numerous sources should be used.
•	 Concepts are our understanding of a term or issue and must be made aware.
•	 Conclusions are our decisions.
•	 Point of view is the perspective used to address an issue.
•	 Alternatives are simply other possibilities.
•	 Context is similar to the setting or background of reasoning.
There are seven standards to thinking critically, which are clearness, accuracy, 
importance/relevance, sufficiency, depth, breadth, and precision (Nosich, 2012, 
p. 133–148).
•	 Clear thinking is when you can state your meaning exactly, when you can 
elaborate on it and explain it, when you can give good examples and illus­
trations of it.
•	 Importance occurs when the information is directly relevant to addressing 
the problem at hand.
•	 Sufficiency happens when you have thought about a question until you have 
reasoned it out thoroughly enough for the purpose at hand, when it is adequate 
for what is needed, when you have taken account of all necessary factors.
•	 The goal for depth and breadth is to develop an intuitive feel for when it is 
important to delve more deeply into an issue and when it is important to 
look at it more broadly by taking account of other related issues.
•	 What is precise will always be relative both to the purpose of the reasoning 
and to the context.
Nosich describes the core process as addressing a question or problem, thinking 
it through using the elements of reasoning, reasoning out all aspects of the issue 
through the lens of discipline when appropriate, and monitoring reasoning using the 
critical thinking standards (p. 169). Evaluation, comparing and contrasting, applica­
tion, decision making, action, and living mindfully play into the critical-thinking 
process (p. 172).

Security Management and Critical Thinking
“Critical thinking transfers” (p. xxviii). With “time, practice, and commitment,” 
the reader will be able to use the material supporting how to think critically and criti­
cal thinking’s application to improve not just in school, but in all decision making 
with improved decisions as a result. However, we must take action or this will not 
come to fruition.
Whether it is in writing or reading, in analysis or evaluation, in the discipline 
as well as in your life outside school, critical thinking creates value. It takes effort, 
especially before you get used to it. However, it has clear practical benefits that far 
exceed the effort. It will produce better answers, better grades, in more courses, in 
more professions, with ultimately less work than any alternative. More than that, it 
gives insight that can make your life richer by bringing the elements, the standards, 
and the disciplines into learning to think things through (2012, p. 195). So, the mate­
rial will allow the reader to incorporate critical thinking into daily life experiences 
with improved decision-making results.
Paul and Elder (2005) argue that critical thinking involves the ability to raise vital 
questions and problems; to gather and assess relevant information; to use abstract 
ideas to interpret information effectively; to come to well-reasoned conclusions and 
solutions, testing them against relevant criteria or standards; and to think open-
mindedly within alternative systems of thought, recognizing and assessing their 
assumptions, implications, and practical consequences.
Paul and Elder (2005) further argue that successful thinkers move more or less 
sequentially through a standard process of identifying problems, making reasonable 
assumptions about the nature of the problems, discerning criteria according to which 
information about the problems can be deemed relevant and well understood, mak­
ing inferences from the pertinent data, and organizing these inferences into concepts 
that will help in coming up with a workable solution.
Paul and Elder use these “elements of thought” to create a checklist for students 
to guide them in their analytical thinking. The benefit of this checklist to instruc­
tors and students is that they teach individuals how to analyze a broad range of 
materials from news articles to chapters in textbooks to government reports to 
novels and poems.
Students should regularly use the following checklist for reasoning to improve 
their thinking in any discipline or subject area:
•	 All reasoning has a purpose.
•	 State your purpose clearly.
•	 Distinguish your purpose from related purposes.
•	 Check periodically to be sure you are still on target.
•	 Choose significant and realistic purposes.
•	 All reasoning is an attempt to settle some question, figure something out, 
or solve some problem.
•	 State the question at issue clearly and precisely.
•	 Express the question in several ways to clarify its meaning and scope.
•	 Break the question into subquestions.

12
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
•	 Distinguish questions that have definitive answers from those that are a 
matter of opinion and from those that require consideration of multiple 
viewpoints.
•	 All reasoning is based on data, information, and evidence.
•	 Restrict your claims to those supported by your data.
•	 Search for information that opposes your position and information that 
supports it.
•	 Make sure that all information used is clear, accurate, and relevant to 
the question at issue.
•	 Make sure you have gathered sufficient information.
•	 All reasoning contains inferences or interpretations by which we draw con­
clusions and give meaning to data.
•	 Infer only what the evidence implies.
•	 Check inferences for their consistency with each other.
•	 Identify assumptions that lead you to your inferences.
•	 All reasoning is expressed through, and shaped by, concepts and ideas.
•	 Identify key concepts and explain them clearly.
•	 Consider alternative concepts or alternative definitions of concepts.
•	 Make sure you are using concepts with care and precision.
•	 All reasoning is based on assumptions (beliefs you take for granted).
•	 Clearly identify your assumptions and determine whether they are 
justifiable.
•	 Consider how your assumptions are shaping your point of view.
•	 All reasoning is done from some point of view.
•	 Identify your point of view.
•	 Seek other points of view and identify their strengths and weaknesses.
•	 Strive to be fair-minded in evaluating all points of view.
•	 All reasoning leads somewhere or has implications and consequences.
•	 Trace the implications and consequences that follow from your reasoning.
•	 Search for negative as well as positive implications.
The point of critical thinking and security management is to promote active 
exploration of ideas through exploration. Critical thinking should be developed in 
security managers as they move through the process of identifying problems, gath­
ering facts and data about the problem, making reasonable assumptions about the 
nature of the problems, discerning criteria to analyze the problems, and identifying 
possible solutions to complex problems and their consequences.
Security managers use tools, such as risk assessments, criticality and vulner­
ability studies, return on program investment, and cost benefit analysis, to gain an 
understanding of loss environments. In itself, the comprehensive process of risk 
analysis utilizes a process of critical thinking. However, the intent of this chapter is 
to embrace the formal processes as well as to make critical thinking a reflective part 
of the everyday role of security management.

3 Core Competencies
PLANNING
Every organization, small or large, public or private, must have a road map or guide as 
to where they want to go or believe that they are going. This must start by knowing what 
has happened in the past, what is occurring in the present, and where you want to go in 
the future, and this necessitates having a plan. This is also true for security management.
What is a plan? A plan is selecting and relating facts, and making and using 
assumptions regarding the future in a rational course of action. The planning pro­
cess, related to rational decision making, is when a course or courses of action are 
made. Assumptions generally are accepted as true statements or beliefs without 
proof or demonstration. These assumptions can be considered a bundle of decisions 
concerning what is known about the past and, thus, will be included in planning for 
the future by making decisions now. A plan represents expenditures of thought, time, 
and knowledge for an investment in the future.
The rational selection of a course of action, that is, the making of a rational plan, 
includes basically the same procedures of those of any rational decision. This means 
that most, if not all, courses of action must be identified, the consequences of each 
course (area) must be predicted or known in advance of decision making, and the 
courses (onward movement in a particular direction) have the preferred results or 
consequences, which must or should be selected. In order to achieve these results, the 
planning process should comprise the following five activities:
	
1.	Problem identification or the analysis of the situation
	
2.	Goal setting (desired future state of affairs)
	
3.	Design of courses of action (alternative approaches to goal attainment)
	
4.	Comparative evaluation of consequences (predicting the results of each 
alternative)
	
5.	Final selection of course of action (decision making)
These five activities create a dynamic process that involves a number of courses 
of action or methods for generating plans that provide an organization with guides 
to sustain renewal and change in terms of more effective goal accomplishments. 
Combining these five activities means that progressive actions are performed by per­
sons in the course of moving the organization from one state or situation to another. 
Combining these activities creates or makes a process that allows or requires a flow 
of interrelated events moving toward some goal, purpose, or end. “Flow” implies 
a movement through time in the direction of a consequence. “Interrelated” denotes 
interaction within the process, and events that are highly relevant one to another. 
“Events” are changes or happenings that occur at one point or period of time, and 
may be any of an infinite number of phenomena. “Goals” suggests a human or 

16
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
decision makers’ objective, while “purpose” suggests either human objectives or 
objectives in a nonmaterial sense. “End” implies some conclusion or consequence 
that may not necessarily be sought or planned by the decision maker. This explana­
tion or definition of process may or may not have consequences intended by humans.
It is certainly time that some goals can be achieved with relatively little planning; 
however, today where many tasks have become quite complex, more technology is 
involved, more people want and demand to be informed and participate in what is 
going to be done, and, with the ever-increasing diversity of personnel, products, and 
services, planning has become a necessity.
One may question the relevance of planning or a plan drawn from a major con­
cept of classical management writings. One would have a major argument trying to 
defend not having any plan whatsoever. As for other specific points that it should 
have and that turn on the nature, importance, and condition of organization for which 
the plan is drawn up, there could be a possibility of settling them beforehand and to 
save time and money by utilizing acceptable components of an already known and 
successful organizational plan.
ORGANIZATION
Organization can be defined as the establishing of a system of effective and struc­
tural behavioral or interpersonal relations among individuals with the individuals 
being differentiated in terms of authority, status, and role with the purpose of achiev­
ing some goal or objective. Organizing results in an organizational structure that 
provides a framework whereby human can favorably unite their efforts.
Classical organization theory is built around four primary concepts that were 
formalized from the past successful occurrences. They are the division of labor, the 
scalar and functional processes, structure, and the span of control.
	
1.	The division of labor has been accepted as the cornerstone of the four con­
cepts. From it, the other concepts flow as a natural consequence or effect. 
Growth within the organization requires the scalar and functional processes 
to necessitate specialization and departments of function. Organizational 
structure is always dependent upon the direction that specialization devel­
opment takes. Finally, span of control problems result from the number of 
specialized functions under the authority and supervision of a manager.
	
2.	The scalar and functional processes deal with the vertical and horizontal 
growth of the organization. The scalar process refers to the growth of the 
chain of command, the delegation of authority and responsibility, unity 
of command, and the obligation to report. The division of the organiza­
tion into specialized parts and the regrouping of the parts into compat­
ible units are matters pertaining to the functional process. This process 
focuses on the horizontal evolution of the line and staff in a formal orga­
nization. A strong belief developed from the line-staff relationships that 
staff areas and positions were not to supervise and have authority over 
line processes.

17
Core Competencies
	
3.	Structure is the logical relationship of functions in an organization, arranged 
to accomplish the goals and objectives of the organization efficiently. 
Structure strongly implies system and pattern. Structure is the mechanism 
for introducing logical and consistent relationships among the diverse func­
tions that comprise the organization.
	
4.	The span of control concept relates to the number of subordinates a man­
ager can effectively supervise. Are there numerical limitations to the sub­
ordinates one person can control? The answer is no. Span should refer 
to a number of persons, themselves carrying managerial and supervisory 
responsibilities, for whom the senior leader retains over-embracing respon­
sibility of direction and planning, coordination, motivation, and control. 
Regardless of the interpretation of span of control, a wide span yields a 
flat structure; a short span results in a tall structure. In today’s world, most 
leaders accept a wide span.
MOTIVATION AND CRITICAL ANALYSIS
From the four primary principles of classical management (especially, span of con­
trol), comes the advent of centralization versus decentralization. Frederick Winslow 
Taylor (1856–1915), who had an engineering background and is accepted as the father 
of scientific management, had to deal with one location and one product and how to 
arrange this organization and its component parts in a more efficient and effect man­
ner to make greater profits. Emphasis was placed on arranging the organization in 
ways that would allow the workers to assist it. Under this system of management, the 
organization was primary and the workers were secondary.
In the United States, during the last three decades of the nineteenth century, the 
Industrial Revolution sprung up and products were not produced in one location and 
in one facility. Products, such as oil, steel, gas and oil, paint, chemicals, glass, and 
financial services, were not available only in one location. Automobiles and rail­
roads and other products required numerous component parts. Organizations started 
exploring decentralization along with their centralized control.
For years, the best example of this type of span of control was the late Alfred P. 
Sloan at the General Motors Corporation. Sloan’s vision was to divide GM into as many 
parts as could be done consistently, place in charge of each part the most capable execu­
tive that could be found, and develop a system of coordination so that each part could 
strengthen and support the others. In academic circles, this was labeled “decentral­
ized organization with centralized control.” The units that exercised major control were 
finance, policy, and direct decisions that expanded all parts of the organization. Again, 
this led those in academia to foster a saying that “in any organization, if you don’t con­
trol your budget and your personnel, you don’t control your part of the organization.”
Again in the United Sates, during the 1870s, 1890s, and early 1900s, prior to 
World War I, organizations grew a large number of products that were produced in 
one or more locations with an extremely large number of workers.
The emphasis by these organizations to develop around classical theories and, in 
most cases, disregard the human aspect of the organization, led to the neoclassical 
school of thought. This is a “tall” form of management.

18
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Neoclassical theory embarked on the task of compensating for some of the defi­
ciencies in classical doctrine. The neoclassical approach to management takes the 
postulates of the classical school, regarding the pillars of the organization as a given. 
Neoclassical emphasized that these claims were modified by people, acting indepen­
dently or written in the context of the informed organization: “flat form.”
The neoclassical had the support of the behavioral scientists (and later mathema­
ticians) to assist in conducting studies and analyzing existing data. Studies of the 
repetitive nature of factory work, assembly line (piece) work in time as workers 
completed and is a requirement and emphasis on how the informal organization 
affects these workers.
Without transparency and visible communication in an organization, an informal 
organization likely will develop. Five important aspects of informal organization as 
it operates within the formal organization include:
	
1.	Informal organizations act as agencies (parts) of social control. They gener­
ate a culture based on certain norms of conduct, which, in turn, demands 
conformity from group members. Diversity of personnel assists in reducing 
the effects an informal culture can exert over an organization.
	
2.	The form of human interrelationships in the informal organization requires 
techniques of analysis different from those used to plot the relationship in a 
formal organization.
	
3.	Informal organizations have status and communication systems peculiar to 
themselves, not necessarily derived from the formal organization.
	
4.	Survival of informal organizations requires stable, continuing relationships 
among the people in them. Informal organizations resist change. Change 
may involve learning a new job and developing new people relationships.
	
5.	The last aspect of analysis that appears to be central to the neoclassical 
view of the informal organization is the study of the informal leader. A 
balancing act exists with the informal leader about how to assist and serve 
the informal group and, at the same time, assist and serve the formal orga­
nization. The informal leader and the formal leader must understand that 
this leadership position was not created by the formal organization.
In today’s society, a 40-hour work week, with extended overtime, long vacations 
and sick time from work, 20- to 30-year retirements for life at any age, and health 
and sick benefits fully covered are causing problems for both private enterprise and 
governmental organizations. These areas have and will create problems for future 
organizational leaders.
In regards to motivating employees in any organization, two factors are important 
today and will continue to be important in the future:
	
1.	Communication and transparency are important to all employees. The 
more they know about what is going on in their organizations, the more 
they relate to the organization.

19
Core Competencies
	
2.	The involvement of employees at all levels and parts of the organization 
in organizational decision making will assist in the motivation aspects of 
employees. Authentic employee involvement must be the organizational 
norm. Employees expect that every suggestion they make for improving the 
organization will be considered. They want involvement and suggestions 
to be discussed with them and explanations given as to whether or not they 
will be implemented. Employees are not fools, and they do not want hypoc­
risy from management.
Motivation
Learning theories, as they relate to individual and group behaviors, have evolved and 
developed since World War II. Drastic changes following the war opened up many 
opportunities for social science researchers to publish research work and studies, 
such as the Hawthorne effect study (Hawthorne Works, Chicago, 1924–1932), from 
the years prior to the war, and explore these ideas and even develop new ideas for the 
now fast-paced society.
Two major researchers, A. H. Maslow (1954) and Fredrick Herzberg, during the 
same time period, developed Models of Motivation:
Model of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs
Self-actualization and fulfillment
Esteem and status
Belonging and social needs
Safety and security
Physiological needs
Model of Herzberg’s motivation—maintenance (Herzberg et al., 1959)
Work itself, achievement, possibility of growth responsibility
Achievement, recognition, status
Relations with supervisors, peer relations, relations with subordinates, 
quality of supervision
Organization policy and administration, job security, working conditions
Pay
These two models are cognition (cognitive) theories of motivation that relate to 
the mental process by which knowledge is acquired. The models research how a 
worker obtains this knowledge through perception, reasoning, and intuition. A major 
difficulty with cognitive models of motivation is that they are not subject to precise 
scientific measurement and observation. One must argue that these two models are 
strong starting points if any type of reinforcement to modify behavior by its conse­
quences are in place. One also could argue that most people today have satisfied their 
lesser needs and are looking toward satisfying higher-level needs at work. Satisfying 
higher-level needs can be done in most organizations by decreasing hierarchical con­
trol and overspecialization of roles. Many studies have discovered that decreasing 
hierarchical control leads to a greater self-value, and, hence, a greater degree of 
expectancy of success and value attainment.

Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Critical Analysis
Defining or stating a problem must be the first order of business when analyzing 
a critical problem or potential problem before making a decision. The core or the 
central part of the problem must be stated before an analysis starts and a decision 
is made. After stating the problem, decisions must be made as to what kind of data 
must be collected and, then, set priorities on how a decision will be made.
In social science, we use a number systems for essentially three purposes: (1) 
to classify things, (2) to order things, and (3) to quantify things. Because data are 
measures of such variables, we refer to them as (1) nominal data, (2) ordinal data, (3) 
interval data, and (4) ratio data.
Nominal data is whenever we assign numbers to a set of categories without refer­
ence to direction or magnitude of difference among the alternatives. Nominal per­
tains to, or consists of, a name or names.
An ordinal scale includes the essential property of a nominal scale, plus two more:
	
1.	The categories are mutually exclusive.
	
2.	They are ordered according to the amount of the attribute they represent.
An interval scale is characterized by three basic properties, including the two 
listed above.
	
1.	The categories are mutually exclusive.
	
2.	They are ordered according to the amount of the attribute they represent.
	
3.	Equal differences in the attribute are represented by equal differences in 
the number assigned to the categories.
	
4.	Numbers assigned to the categories are proportional to the amounts of the 
attribute represented by them.
A ratio scale has all of the attributes of an interval scale with the added difference:
	
1.	Both interval and ratio levels are quantitative measurement. The difference 
between an interval and a ratio scale is that the interval scale has an arbi­
trary zero point while the ratio scale has an absolute zero point.
The use of the quantitative and/or qualitative measures is also an important con­
sideration in planning for the data collection phase of critical analysis. Quantitative 
measures are typically numerical, and qualitative measures are textual. Quantitative 
variables are aggregate indicators of the magnitude of concepts, whereas qualitative 
variables show the character or content of concepts. It is important to keep in mind 
that neither one variable is better or worse than the other. The use of either type of 
data should be consistent with the research questions one is asking and not because 
one has a preference for statistical or qualitative analysis.
Three kinds of “averages” are defined from data that have been obtained for 
research questions. The “mean” is the point around which the values in the distribu­
tion balance, and is the mathematical or arithmetic average. In order to calculate a 

21
Core Competencies
mean, internal level data must exist. The median provides information about the 
value of the middle position in the distribution. It is the point in the distribution of 
values at which 50% of the scores fall below and 50% fall above. In order to calculate 
a median, you must have at least an ordinally measured variable. Mode represents 
the most frequent value in distribution. The mode is the simplest measure of averages 
and, therefore, is not viewed as an overly precise or informative measure of average. 
In addition, the mode is the only measure that is appropriate for the nominal learned 
of measurement.
Security organizations, small or large, public or private, must have a road map 
or guide as to where they want to go or believe that they are going. This must start 
by knowing what has happened in the past, what is occurring in the present, and 
where one wants to go in the future. This necessitates having a plan. This chapter 
has shown, through classical studies, how these theoretical principles are true for 
security management as well.
EXERCISES
Maslow’s hierarchy of Needs is a core competency that a security manager 
should understand. It can be used by the manager to understand how 
employees interact in life and also in the work environment. Explain how 
Maslow’s hierarchy can be used to explain internal theft by employees. 
How would this explanation be different from using Maslow’s theory to 
explain theft from outsiders?

4 Developing a Security 
Management System
Security management is a broad field of management related to asset loss prevention, 
physical security, occupational safety, and intangible asset protection functions. It 
entails the identification of an organization’s employees, physical assets, intangible 
assets, and the development, documentation, and implementation of physical mea­
sures, policies, procedures, and guidelines.
Security management is a methodical process that is used to develop mechanisms 
to protect organizational assets. Security management tools, such as risk assessments, 
criticality and vulnerability studies, and cost benefit analysis show just a glimpse of 
the methodical tools of the security manager. The risk assessment itself looks at the 
value of organizational assets, accounting for both the criticality and vulnerability of 
the asset to determine the amount of the security investment. The comprehensive pro­
cess of risk analysis, as well as other security management tools, utilizes a process of 
critical thinking, while providing a basis for a comprehensive security management 
program.
UNDERSTANDING THE ORGANIZATION 
TO ESTABLISH SECURITY PROGRAMS
The role of security management must begin by asking some fundamental questions 
in determining where to begin in the process of protecting organizational assets. 
The findings, provided by a critical thinking framework, are based on the analysis 
of several security-related factors, which serves as the basis for the implementation 
of security measures to develop an optimal level of protection. The desired level of 
protection is the degree of security provided by a particular countermeasure or set of 
countermeasures to protect the asset.
Identify Organizational Assets and Goals
The first step of the security management planning process is to identify organiza­
tional assets and specific overall goals for the organization. This part of the plan­
ning process should include a detailed overview of each organizational asset and 
its relationship to organizational goals, including the reason for its selection and 
the anticipated outcomes of goal-related projects. Where possible, objectives should 
be described in quantitative or qualitative terms. These quantitative and qualitative 
goals should be measurable. Being able to measure needs, as well as outcomes, is 
fundamental to security management as well as to the entire organization.

24
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
The application of security programs shall follow the critical thinking process 
regardless of the type of asset involved. The asset has a direct impact on the applica­
tion of this process and how countermeasure recommendations resulting from the 
process are to be implemented. Application of this security standard ensures a com­
prehensive approach to meeting organizational security needs in the threat environ­
ment, and that the scope of security is commensurate with the risk posed to an asset, 
relative to cost.
Each goal should have financial and human resources considerations associated 
with its achievement. For example, we have an organization that manufactures wid­
gets and if the organization has a goal to increase production and sales by 20%, how 
does that impact the role of security? What aspects of organization assets, risks, and 
vulnerabilities change when the overall goals of the organization change? Maybe 
assets, risks, and vulnerabilities don’t change. However, we do not know that until 
we adequately understand the organizational environment.
Therefore, a primary goal in security management is to identify and evaluate 
organizational assets. For simplicity, we can categorize assets as people, physical, 
and intangible.
People
The people category can range from the line workers providing minimal strategic 
importance to vital individuals holding key roles, whose incapacity or absence will 
affect the business.
Physical Assets
This includes all physical organizational assets, including real estate, buildings, 
facilities, equipment, materials, moneys, supplies, inventories, and all the physical 
resources that allow the organization to operate.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include information, plans, and organizational strategies. It can be 
marketing and sales plans, detailed financial data, trade secrets, personnel informa­
tion, sensitive office correspondence, and minutes of meetings. It also can include 
things such as a positive public perception of an organization. Often these orga­
nizational assets are overlooked at first glance. However, the security manager, as 
well as organizational leadership, should work together to illuminate and assess the 
significance of these assets.
Relationship between Organizational Assets
The security manager must understand the relationship of assets in organizational 
structures and functions. This includes the physical and logical relationships that 
assets have with each other in the organizational environment. It also can relate to 
the impact one asset can have on the other in a loss event. An essential tool for a 
better understanding, the relationship between organizational assets is through the 
configuration of an asset hierarchy. A very simplistic asset hierarchy diagram for our 
widget-making machine may look like Figure 4.1.

25
Developing a Security Management System
From this illustration, we must assume that a loss event impacting XYZ property 
(real estate) may impact the building and, subsequently, the widget-making machine. 
For example, if the property floods, that may result in the building flooding as well, 
which, in turn, may result in loss to the widget-making machine. In another example, 
a loss to the XYZ Manufacturing Building asset, such as a fire, also may have an 
impact on the widget-making machine. Or, in a final situation, an employee could 
misuse the widget-making machine and make it inoperable, which results in a loss 
to the organization. Therefore, from these scenarios, we can see that there can be a 
relationship where one asset loss is attributed and can be related to the hierarchical 
relationship that asset shares with other organizational assets (Figure 4.2).
The point of the asset hierarchy is not as much about making a rigid model of 
what or where the assets resides in the organizational structure, but, rather, to enlist 
the asset hierarchy as a critical thinking tool to better understand the physical and 
logical relationships that assets have with each other in the organizational environ­
ment and the impact that one asset can have on the other in a loss event.

Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
IDENTIFY THE CRITICALITY OF ASSETS IN 
MEETING ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS
One must determine the asset criticality for the organization. This evaluation is 
where the individual assets are linked to the relationship of the organization’s strate­
gic plan. In the organizational environment, Security must understand the value (or 
criticality) of an asset in attaining organizational goals. If the organizational goal is 
to increase widget production by 20% in the following year, what is the role of the 
assets in goal attainment?
A simplistic way to look at the criticality of organizational assets is to place a 
criticality value on that asset to provide a numeric valuation system, which expresses 
the value of the asset to the organization. For example, we could lump assets into 
three general categories: critical, not critical, and no criticality value. From these 
three general views, the security manager also can include redundancy criteria in 
the asset criticality measurement. From this scenario, the security manager can rate 
organizational assets on a scale of 1 to 5 for criticality, with 5 being the most critical 
(with no redundancy) and 1 having no criticality in meeting organizational goals:
5: Critical asset, no redundancy
4: Critical asset with redundancy
3: Not critical asset, no redundancy
2: Not critical asset with redundancy
1: The asset has no criticality to organizational goals
Therefore, an asset that is critical to the operation and has no onsite replacement 
would be given a criticality of 5, one that is critical to the operation and has a replace­
ment onsite would be given a criticality of 4, and so on.
The premise in understanding organizational assets and their relationship in 
meeting organizational goals is crucial because failure to fully understand organiza­
tional assets will result in the over or under protection of those assets. The resulting 
over protection of assets will cost the security manager resources that may be better 
used elsewhere, while the under protection of assets can contribute to greater expo­
sure to risk and subsequent loss.
EXISTING LEVELS OF ASSET PROTECTION
Once all organizational assets are evaluated, the next step is to determine their 
existing level of security protection. Depending on the organization’s requirements, 
assets may be classified into two or more levels of security need. The security man­
ager should be cautious of having too many existing levels of security protection; this 
tends to dilute their importance as well as over complicating security management. 
Having too many security levels proves expensive in terms of employee training, 
security resources, and practices, in that the costs are often greater than the potential 
losses. Keep it simple in providing adequate protection while also minimizing com­
plexity in application.

27
Developing a Security Management System
The security manager can utilize the level of protection concept to gain an under­
standing of security needs by forming needs into three general categories:
	
1.	Existing level of protection: The degree of security provided by counter­
measures to an asset currently being utilized at an organization.
	
2.	Necessary level of protection: The degree of security provided by a set of 
countermeasures identified, which must be implemented and justified by a 
risk assessment group to provide a necessary level of protection.
	
3.	Optimal level of protection: The degree of security needed to completely 
mitigate organizational risks.
The existing level of protection may be determined through site surveys, inter­
views, reviews of policies and procedures, testing, etc., to determine what counter­
measures are currently in place and how effective they are. Current conditions may 
then be matched up against the existing level of protection and then compared to the 
necessary level of protection to determine if it adequately addresses the threat(s) or 
if vulnerabilities need to be addressed.
In determining existing levels of protection, the security manager should define, 
in detail, the following key areas of existing security management:
•	 Existing asset classification practices: Guidelines for specifying security.
•	 Previous risk assessments and organizational understanding of asset’s risk.
•	 Assignment of organizational asset ownership: Is there an assignment of 
roles for handling organizational assets?
•	 Existing asset responsibilities: The tasks and procedures to be followed by 
the entities handling the asset.
•	 Existing policies regarding mishandling of organizational assets: Includes 
how security violations are reported and dealt with.
•	 Existing security awareness practices: Education programs and classifica­
tion of assets.
•	 Existing security audit procedures: Unannounced checks of security mea­
sures put in place to find out whether they are functioning.
If the existing level of protection equates to the necessary level of protection, 
current countermeasures should be maintained and evaluated on a regular basis. 
However, organizational conditions should be monitored for changes that may impact 
the effectiveness of countermeasures or the needed level of protection. Therefore, if 
the existing level of protection does not sufficiently address the risks, shortfalls must 
be identified and countermeasures to address those vulnerabilities must be consid­
ered for implementation.
ANALYZING RISKS TO ORGANIZATIONAL ASSETS
An effective security management system demonstrates a careful evaluation of how 
much security is needed to protect organizational assets. Security managers must real­
ize that too little security means that organizational assets can be easily compromised, 

28
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
while too much security can make assets hard to use or so degraded that performance 
is negatively affected. Security must be inversely proportioned to an asset’s utility. It 
is a given that there is always going to be risk associated with assets and activities. 
The only way to completely eliminate the risk, in many cases, would be to make that 
asset inoperable. Therefore, the role of security management is to find the optimal 
relationship between organizational processes, assets, and functionality. While, the 
risk assessment process will be more deeply analyzed in Chapter 9, it still maintains 
merit to look at the overall role in building a security management program.
If the organizational asset is viewed through the inventory of potential loss events, 
the security manager must recognize that findings are not necessarily all-inclusive. 
For each undesirable event where the assessed risk is either less than or exceeds the 
baseline level of protection, the security manager must identify the countermeasures 
that will provide a level of protection equivalent to the level of risk. For a lower-level 
risk, minimum countermeasures are typically less stringent, but also may be less 
effective in mitigating higher risks, while, at the other extreme, very high counter­
measures are typically more stringent and, generally, more effective.
A minimum level of risk should be alleviated with minimum countermeasures, 
a low level of risk should be lessened with low-level countermeasures, and so on. 
Adjusting from the baseline level of protection by determining which countermea­
sures are applicable to the assessed risks and identifying changes from the baseline 
level of protection, the necessary level of protection can be determined. Once the 
level of protection necessary to meet the risk is identified, an evaluation of current 
conditions must be made to identify the existing countermeasures.
Security managers should understand that some degree of risk is assumed with 
all organizational activities and assets. Having no risk is virtually impossible even 
with unlimited resources. Therefore, identify all risks to organizational assets, then 
determine risks to accept and others to mitigate via security measures. The security 
manager must work with others throughout the organization to understand the effect 
to the business if an asset is lost or compromised. By doing this, you get a good idea 
of how resources should be assigned to protecting the asset.
For security managers, risk management is a fundamental component of their 
position. Risk management is the comprehensive approach to allocating resources 
for the protection of assets to achieve an acceptable relationship between risk and 
protection. Risk management decisions are based on the application of risk assess­
ment, risk mitigation, and risk acceptance. The risk assessment itself looks at the 
value of organizational assets, accounting for both the criticality and vulnerability 
of the asset to determine the amount of the security investment. The comprehensive 
process of risk analysis utilizes critical thinking. The risk assessments will be the 
basis for management of risk through the application of strategies and countermea­
sures to reduce the threat of, vulnerability to, and/or consequences from an undesir­
able event. Risk acceptance is an explicit or implicit assumption that some risk is not 
feasibly possible to mitigate.
The desired levels of protection of assets should be critically determined via a 
risk-based analytical process or risk assessment. The process will focus on risk as 
a measurement of potential harm or loss from an undesirable event. Understanding 
risk means understanding threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. The level of 

29
Developing a Security Management System
risk is the combined measure of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences posed to 
assets from specified loss events.
If the existing level of protection is insufficient, a determination must be made 
as to whether the necessary level of protection can be achieved; specifically, if the 
countermeasure can be physically implemented, and whether the investment is 
cost effective. Cost effectiveness is based on the investment in the countermeasure 
versus the value of the asset. In some cases, investment in an expensive counter­
measure may not be advisable because the life cycle of the asset is almost expired. 
Additionally, consideration should be given to whether other countermeasures may 
take priority for funding. Note that cost-effective is a different determination than 
cost-prohibitive. A countermeasure is cost-prohibitive if its cost exceeds available 
funding. Funding may exist for a countermeasure, but it may not be a sound financial 
decision to expend that money for little gain, making it not cost-effective.
There are a variety of mathematical models available to calculate risk and to 
illustrate the impact of increasing protective measures on organizational assets. For 
the purposes of this example, the assumption is made, at this step of the process, 
that there are no countermeasures in place and complete vulnerability exists. This 
approach is necessary to ensure that all security criteria will be considered as the 
process is completed, and to define the relationship between the level of risk and the 
level of protection. The level of risk must be mitigated by a commensurate level of 
protection. Often a high level of risk must be mitigated by implementing a high level 
of protection.
Risk assessments utilize a form of critical thinking. Glaser’s (1941) premise that 
critical thinking is (1) an attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way 
the problems and subjects that come within the range of one’s experiences, (2) knowl­
edge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, and (3) some skill in applying 
those methods is very applicable in conducting risk assessments.
A very simplistic example of a risk assessment, utilizing critical thinking, could 
be evaluated by taking the asset value multiplied by the criticality of the asset multi­
plied by the vulnerability of the asset to determine an actual risk value. The equation 
is exemplified as AV × C × V = RV. To make this equation operational, the security 
manager can first take an asset and determine its value. Then multiple it by its criti­
cality value, which is represented as a percentage from .0 to 1.0. Next, multiply by 
vulnerability, which is also a percentage expressing the likelihood that a risk event 
will materialize into a loss.
The following is an example of a critical thinking risk assessment: AV × C × V 
= RV:
Asset value (AV): AV considers an asset’s value as the original cost, adjusted 
upward for improvements since the purchase of the asset and downward for 
loss in value related to the aging of the asset (Damodaran, 2012).
Asset Criticality (C): C in the equation represents the value or degree 
of importance of an asset in regards to achieving organizational goals. 
For this value, the security manager can apply asset criticality as a 
percentage.

  25%  or  0.25

  0%  or  0.0
Asset Vulnerability (V): V is the likelihood that a risk/threat event will 
occur to an organizational asset. Vulnerability is based on past loss data, 
which may be self-collected, or historical statistics from the organization’s 
archived data or data from like organizations. The asset vulnerability would 
be defined as a percentage of likelihood that a specific loss event will occur 
in the budget period.
Risk Value (RV): RV is the estimated cost of a risk to an organizational asset 
determined by multiplying the asset value by the assets criticality to the 
organization, multiplied by the likelihood (vulnerability) of the occurrence 
of the risk event, resulting in the valuation of the risk in monetary values.
The following is an example applying the Risk Value Model (RVM) to a scenario 
as an aid to demonstrate risk value to an organizational asset. To simplify it, the 
asset will be our widget-making machine, which costs our organization $10,000. The 
widget-making machine is critical to our organization, but we do have redundancy 
in that we always keep an extra machine on hand. Based on past loss data, the secu­
rity manager knows that twice in the past 10 years the widget-making machine was 
stolen and not recovered.
AV = Our asset value for the widget-making machine considers asset value 
as the original cost, adjusted downward for loss in value, because it is two 
years old and has a life expectancy of 10 years. Therefore, AV = 10,000 × 
.80 (remaining life expectancy or $8,000.
C = The widget-making machine is deemed a critical asset, but we do have 
redundancy. Therefore, 0.75 represents the value or degree of importance of 
the widget-making machine in achieving organizational goals.
V = The likelihood that a theft will occur to the widget-making machine is 20% 
annually. This assumption is based on past loss data, in that the security 
manager knows two of the machines were lost to theft in the past 10 years.
RV = From this exercise, the annual risk value of theft to the widget-making 
machine: $8,000 (AV) × .75(C) × .20(V) = $1,200.
So does that mean we can spend $1,200 annually to prevent the machine from being 
stolen? No, not necessarily. What it does mean is that we have utilized a critical think­
ing framework to give us a better understanding of our loss environment to an orga­
nizational asset. Based on this exercise, we can fiscally justify a system to protect the 
machine against theft. The security system to protect the machine may include bolting 
it to the floor, using measures permanently identifying it a property of XYZ Company, 
assigning unit or staff ownership/responsibility of the machine, or directing policies 
and rules facilitating an increase in security to the widget-making machine.

31
Developing a Security Management System
The idea in the Risk Value Model is to provide the security manager with a criti­
cal thinking tool to protect organizational assets. In practice, various risk assess­
ment methodologies will provide varying outputs, from numbers and percentages 
to qualitative ratings. The security manager must determine what outputs from their 
respective methodologies correlate with the desired level of protection.
In an organization where multiple risk assessments may be conducted, the secu­
rity manager will need to evaluate the comprehensive findings and determine what 
countermeasure recommendations to implement, or if a single risk assessment will 
be accepted for application. In gauging the value of a risk assessment, it should meet 
the following criteria at a minimum:
•	 The methodology must be credible, and assess the threat, consequences, 
and asset vulnerability to a specific loss event.
•	 The methodology must be reproducible, and produce similar or identical 
results when applied by various security professionals.
•	 The methodology must be defensible, and provide sufficient justification for 
deviation from the baseline.
For the security manager, the risk assessment is a fundamental component of 
determining protection efforts. The risk assessment can be a critical thinking tool 
utilized in allocating resources for the protection of assets. For the security manager, 
risk management decisions are based on the application of risk assessment.
COST VERSUS BENEFIT OF SECURITY
Cost considerations can be a primary factor in a decision to implement a countermea­
sure. A cost-benefit analysis is a critical thinking tool used by security managers in 
justifying security measures or programs. Cost-benefit analysis is a cost analysis meth­
odology used to justify security expenditure; however, all costs, including life-cycle 
costs, should be considered in whatever methodology is used. In addition to direct 
project costs, those expenditures associated with indirect impacts (e.g., business inter­
ruption, loss in productivity, or loss in credibility) should be considered. Any decision 
to not secure assets or to defer implementation of security measures due to cost (or 
other factors) must be documented, including the acceptance or transfer of risk.
The cost-benefit analysis is a comparative assessment of the benefits from your 
security measure and the costs to perform it, in relation to the financial impact result­
ing from potential loss to the asset. In a cost-benefit analysis, everything gets a dol­
lar value. The security manager should consider costs for all phases of the security 
project. Costs may be one-time capital or recurring costs, such as personnel time, 
supplies, materials, or maintenance. The determining criteria in a cost-benefit analy­
sis are that the security benefit exceeds the cost. How much the benefit exceeds the 
cost in determining security measure implementation is going to be based on the 
security manager in consultation with organizational leadership. The premise is that 
the cost-benefit analysis is another tool used by security management to critically 
deal with risk to assets.

32
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
IMPLEMENT THE SECURITY PROGRAMS
When the security manager completes the critical analyses via asset criticality and 
vulnerability studies, risk assessments, and cost benefit analysis, then he/she may 
implement the security measures that have been determined to best fit the asset risk. 
Implementation of new security programs are best accomplished in stages to make 
it easier for the organization to adapt to changes in the working environment. The 
security manager and organizational management should understand that there may 
be user resistance to security functions. It is recommended that staged implementa­
tion be performed starting with the most critical or vulnerable assets.
Assignments and Timelines
As the organization implements security measures, it must establish timelines for 
completing the associated tasks. This portion of the security implementation process 
should consider the capability of staff members and the time necessary to realis­
tically complete projects. The amount of preparation required to implement secu­
rity measures may limit its immediate achievability. If the security measure has 
no capital cost, such as policy and procedural changes, or can be incorporated into 
a new project, the countermeasure often can be implemented immediately. When 
countermeasures require advance budgeting or coordination with outside vendors, 
implementation may be delayed.
Monitor for Compliance
Effective security management depends on adequate compliance monitoring. Most 
often violations of security practices, whether intentional or unintentional, become 
more frequent and serious if not detected and acted upon. Compliance monitoring 
has two primary activities: detecting security violations and responding to them.
The security manager should document the response to violations, and follow 
up immediately after noncompliance is detected. The organization should have a 
designated response group to deal with security violations. Members of the response 
group should have access to organizational leadership so that severe situations can 
be dealt with immediately.
A critical part of noncompliance should be the generation of reports for orga­
nizational leadership that discusses security violations. An additional objective of 
monitoring security measures for noncompliance is to identify potential security 
violations before they dilute the effectiveness of the program or before they cause 
serious damage.
REEVALUATE ASSETS AND RISKS
Security management is a discipline that should be dynamic. As changes in the orga­
nization or assets occur, a reassessment of the security measures should occur as 
well. Organizational leadership should keep security management abreast of larger 

33
Developing a Security Management System
changes in the organization so that security operations and measures are prepared to 
meet these challenges.
Even the best-laid plans can sometimes be changed by unanticipated events. A 
security management plan should include contingencies if certain aspects of the 
master plan prove to be unattainable. Alternative courses of action can be incorpo­
rated into each segment of the planning process, or for the plan in its entirety. The 
security manger must continually identify and analyze threats and vulnerabilities to 
assets, recommend and implement, and take appropriate countermeasures.
CONCLUSION
Developing a Security Management Program requires a broad field of knowledge 
in asset loss prevention, physical security, occupational safety, and intangible asset 
protection functions. It requires a comprehensive knowledge of organizational assets 
and the development and implementation of physical measures, policies, procedures, 
and guidelines to protect those assets
Security management requires critical thinking skills in developing mechanisms 
to protect organizational assets. The process of security management utilizes pro­
cesses of critical thinking, which provides a basis for a comprehensive security man­
agement program. The dynamic nature of organizations and environments require 
that the security response also be dynamic.

5 Policies and Procedures
Organizational vision and mission are further defined by policies and procedures. 
The security unit must develop policies and procedures to promote the vision and 
mission while protecting organizational assets. A policy tells us what to do while a 
procedure tells us how to do it.
For this chapter, commonly used definitions include:
Policy: The organization’s guiding or governing principle
Procedure: Tells people how to do something; may comprise several work 
instructions
Protocol: Another name for procedure; associated with specific disciplines
Process: A series of interrelated activities that result in an outcome; comprises 
several procedures
SOP: Standard operating procedure
Work Instruction: Specific steps within a procedure; assumes one person or job 
completes the task from start to finish; can be used for training; usually unit 
contained or job specific
A policy is the organization’s guiding or governing principle. It is a general 
guideline that sets forth parameters for decision making along with the authority for 
implementation. Policy development is a planned process requiring due diligence in 
thought because a policy becomes a strong principle of the organization. Planners 
must look to the desired outcomes while considering the needs of end users. Policy 
justification should reflect problem solving while demonstrating persuasive reason­
ing, clarity, and coherence. How will the policy be enforced? Is there an incentive 
(including negative incentives)? Is there support for the policy from the workforce? Is 
there some overriding need for the policy? The policy should be consistent with the 
organization’s mission, culture, strategy, and vision. It should not overlap or contra­
dict with other policies and procedures.
Clarity is important in writing a policy. The average reader should not have any 
questions about the objective of the policy. When writing, do sufficient research to 
assure you are compliant with other policy and legal requirements. All stakeholders 
should have an opportunity to have input and give feedback about the policy. In a 
large organization, worker committees or teams may be organized to assure feed­
back is received from all levels. When written, policies must be published in a form 
that is easily accessible to those affected by the policy. In general, a policy manual 
should be easy to use with a format that allows for ease of updating.
A policy or procedure should be written (or revised) when there is confusion 
about what appropriate action to take in a given situation, for fairness, consistency, 
and accountability. Sometimes, legislative or regulatory changes require a change 

36
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
in policy or procedure. After some time, a policy or procedure may have so many 
exceptions, exemptions, or waivers that the policy (or procedure) is ineffective. This 
requires a review and either a rewrite or enforcement of the present policy (procedure).
Not all actions require or fall within a written policy. While policy sets out the 
order of business, anomalies occur and are handled on a case-by-case basis. Policy 
makes for efficient work. We may be tempted to write a policy for every possible event 
and become inefficient by spending valuable resources writing nothing but policy, 
and you end up with a policy manual so large it won’t be read. The manual becomes 
an organ to catch people doing wrong rather than direct people on doing right.
The policy should begin with a policy statement, which explains what you are 
doing. Is the policy a standard or a guideline? Standards are specific requirements 
that must be met while guidelines identify best practices. The statement tells when 
the policy should be applied and lists major conditions or restrictions. Next, docu­
ment the reason for the policy and supply a description of the conflict or problem the 
policy is designed to resolve. Have a list of those who should know this policy and 
should follow the policy and accompanying procedures in order to do their job. Also, 
document the resources and contact information at the end of the policy.
Procedures tell us how to do something. They are the steps for getting things 
done. Inside of a procedure are work instructions; specific steps within the proce­
dure. Work instructions usually involve one person accomplishing a task. The aim 
for a procedure is to use one action per step and to assign the action to a person who 
is responsible for the action. Many of the general considerations of procedures occur 
when writing policies. In lieu of repeating material, just keep in mind the ideas pre­
sented above.
A procedure begins with a purpose statement. What are you trying to accom­
plish? Then list the actions and sequence, who does each step to include handing 
off to another person, where and when this must be done, and any standards for 
completing the work.
When a new policy or procedure is adopted, the work staff must be educated as to 
its existence. In the case of a procedure, this may require training. Whether through 
a training session or a briefing, notice should be presented in a formal format, with 
documentation of all persons receiving the new material. New employees should be 
notified of policies and procedures in new employee orientations.
When the policy, or procedure, is in effect, enforcement is usually through dis­
ciplinary action. Discipline must be consistent or the policy (procedure) will lose 
its power. Depending on the severity of a policy violation, progressive discipline 
provides a level of punishment commensurate with the violation. For example, a first 
offense may result in a one-day suspension; a second offense, a one-week suspen­
sion; and a third violation, termination. There are cases where two employees might 
get a different punishment for the same conduct. Discipline may be more severe for 
a seasoned veteran than a new employee. Another consideration may be the seniority 
of employees. Some policy violations are so severe as to warrant immediate ter­
mination. These are usually reserved for those violations that could result in death 
or serious injury to others, or on matters of integrity. Embezzling money from the 
organization may not create a risk of injury, but the nature of the violation would 
warrant dismissal.

37
Policies and Procedures
When a policy (procedure) has not been enforced, or has been selectively 
enforced, reviving the policy (procedure) follows basically the same notifica­
tion process as a new or rewritten policy (procedure). When reviving a policy 
(procedure), personnel are informed that the policy (procedure) had previously 
not been enforced, but that it is still applicable and necessary to the function of 
the organization, and that, forthwith, the policy (procedure) will be enforced. 
Consideration should be given to a graduated disciplinary process in reimple­
menting the policy (procedure).
There are two types of security policies: policies affecting the workforce and 
policies specifically related to the security guard force. Policies affecting the work­
force are as varied as the imagination allows. Some of the most common are policies 
affecting access control, company equipment, visitors to the workplace, and infor­
mation security. Policies affecting the general workforce are often seen as restric­
tive and a hassle. It is important for the policy to state the reason for the policy and 
that the policy is applied throughout the organization. If the chief executive officer 
(CEO) doesn’t have to comply, employees begin to question why they have to comply. 
Executives should set the example by following all policies and directing others to 
do so.
SECURITY POLICIES THAT AFFECT THE GENERAL WORKFORCE
Access Control
A policy on “site access control” (not IT access control) should state reasons for 
buildings and doors to be open or locked, and the time doors will be open or locked.
The administration building doors will be unlocked Monday–Friday from 
7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Access at other times is by key or contact security.
The policy should dictate who is entitled to a key and a log maintained of all keys 
issued. The policy should require Human Resources to withhold final pay until keys 
are returned, e.g.:
Keys are issued to all full time employees for their office. Keys shall not be 
duplicated and are to remain in the possession of the employee at all times. 
Keys shall be returned upon resignation or termination.
Supervisors are authorized a master key for all offices in their area. Master 
keys shall not be loaned out and shall remain in the possession of the super­
visor at all times.
Electronic access control systems should dictate times and days personnel are 
allowed to enter the premises. Access control cards and fobs shall be returned on 
resignation or termination. Employees should be aware that their card may be deac­
tivated for security reasons, e.g.:

38
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Employees are issued access control badges that shall be displayed on the per­
son at all times while on the property. Badges should be visible above the 
waist by hanging on a lanyard around the neck or clipped to a shirt, blouse, 
or jacket. Employees are not to loan the badge to another person … Misuse 
can result in having your badge deactivated.
Visitors
Visitor control policies should state the process for permitting visitors access to the 
facility and who has permission to sponsor a visitor, e.g.:
Any employee may sponsor a visitor to the facility. Visitors must be met at the 
front desk by the employee who will sign for the visitor badge and escort the 
visitor at all times while he/she is in the facility. The employee is respon­
sible for signing out the visitor when he/she leaves the facility.
Visitor policies also may be applied to direct areas where visitors are not allowed 
access, e.g.”
No visitors are allowed in the research lab at any time without the written 
approval of the lab director.
A visitor policy may contain a procedure employees will follow if they find an 
unidentified visitor, e.g.:
Any employee who observes an unescorted visitor or unknown person not dis­
playing an employee badge shall immediately notify security and provide 
a description of the person. The employee is not to approach the unknown 
person. The employee may be asked to watch the person until security 
arrives and to notify security if the person moves to another location.
Company Equipment
A policy for equipment control should state the authorizations needed to remove 
property from the premises, e.g.:
All company equipment is marked with an identification tag and must 
be checked out before leaving the facility. The employee must have the 
approval of a supervisor to remove property from the facility.
Information Security Policy
Information security, whether hardcopy or digital matter, should be secured by users 
and steps taken to guard against theft or compromise, e.g.:

39
Policies and Procedures
All documents shall be secured at the end of the workday by placing all files 
in the workroom. The workroom shall be closed and locked at the normal 
close of business.
Documents shall not be left exposed on any desk or workspace. If you need 
to leave your work area briefly, use a coversheet to protect the documents 
from view.
Computer screens should be positioned to protect against view from passersby. 
When leaving your workstation, computers should be placed on standby 
with a password to reopen.
POLICIES AFFECTING THE SECURITY FORCE
Jurisdiction and Authority
The Security policy should include a policy identifying the jurisdiction and authority 
of the guard force, e.g.:
XYZ, Inc. guards have no authority to arrest. State law [cite statute] authorizes 
guards on premise to detain suspicious persons for law enforcement authorities.
Guards have no authority or jurisdiction to act when off company property.
Code of Ethics
The security force should adopt or develop a code of ethics. All personnel in security 
operations shall receive training on the code of ethics and agree to abide by the code, 
e.g.:
All security personnel will receive [_] hours of ethics training. At the comple­
tion of the training, each employee will sign an agreement to abide by the 
code of ethics.
Use of Force
The decision to allow or not allow force by guards should be stated with details on 
the use of force allowed or authorized by law, e.g.:
Guards are not allowed to use force except to prevent injury to another person. 
The amount of force permissible is dictated by state law [cite statute].
At no time is deadly force authorized to protect property.
When lethal or nonlethal weapons are issued or allowed, the policy should dictate 
the use of the weapon, e.g.:
Firearms are issued for the personal protection of the guard and personnel onsite. 
Deadly force is authorized by most state law in the following instances:
Only under conditions of extreme necessity

40
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
As a last resort
When all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be employed
Pepper spray is issued to guards for personal protection. Pepper spray is 
allowed when […]
If a guard discharges his or her pepper at an assailant, the guard must immedi­
ately inform the assailant that he/she has been exposed to […]
The use of force policy should require a report on any use of force, e.g.:
When guards must resort to force in the performance of their duties, the 
supervisor should be notified immediately. The guard will write a detailed 
account of the event, expressly including all data as well as narratives of the 
event. The security manager should facilitate this process by assuring that 
there is a uniform report that officers use.
Use of Equipment
A directive should govern the use of equipment for official purposes only and only 
in the line of duty, e.g.:
All property issued to the employee is for official use only and is intended to be 
used only in the line of duty when circumstances warrant their use.
Uniform Requirements
A directive should govern the uniform and what may or may not be displayed on the 
uniform, e.g.:
The uniform is for duty use only. Employees are permitted to wear the uniform 
to, from, and while on duty. Only authorized badges and insignias may be 
displayed on the uniform.
Report Writing
A policy on reports should include when a report should be written and what should 
be included in the report, e.g.:
Security reports must be completed when:
There is a violation of a security order or safety rule
Someone reports a crime to security
An alarm is activated
CONCLUSION
A policy is the organization’s guiding or governing principle. It has been the intent 
of this chapter to assure that a general guideline is set forth with parameters for 

41
Policies and Procedures
decision making along with the authority for implementation. Policy development 
should be a planned process requiring due diligence in thought because a policy 
becomes a strong principle of the organization. Policy justification should reflect 
problem solving while demonstrating persuasive reasoning, clarity, and coherence.
EXERCISES
It has come to the attention of security management that your organization 
is having issues with employees leaving work early and having another 
employee clock out for them later. Write a policy that will deal with this 
situation. How will the policy be enforced? Is there an incentive (including 
negative incentives)? Is there support for the policy from the workforce? Is 
there some overriding need for the policy? The policy should be consistent 
with the organization’s mission, culture, strategy, and vision. It should not 
overlap or contradict with other policies and procedures.

6 Staffing the 
Response Force
Security response forces are part of a comprehensive security program (National 
Advisory Commission, 1976). Facilities that operate without a trained response force 
must rely on local law enforcement to respond to an event requested by a management 
group that may or may not have any knowledge or foresight of security procedures or 
needs. A receptionist or clerical employee assumes the task of screening visitors and 
also initiates the first response to a hazardous event. Distractions from their normal 
tasks, and the fact that security is not their forte, means relying on such for security 
is inadequate, if nonexistent. The decision to have an onsite response force takes into 
consideration the volume of employee and visitor traffic, the value or sensitivity of 
the assets and resources being protected, local crime rates, the availability of local 
law enforcement to respond and their response time, and other security measures in 
place (see Chapter 7, Physical Controls).
A TRAINED RESPONSE FORCE
A security force is a deterrent to criminal activity. Uniformed officers send a message 
that the site is guarded and an immediate response is available. Officers can super­
vise access control. They can secure exterior areas by having a guard house located 
away from buildings to verify authority for persons to be on the premises. Employees 
and visitors can be screened and deliveries checked before moving on to buildings. 
At building entrances, guards verify the identity of employees whose access control 
badge may be misread by electronic systems, as well as operating screening equip­
ment, such as magnetometers and x-ray equipment. Extremely secure sites may have 
explosives sniffers and the capability to x-ray vehicles, along with vehicle barricades.
Visitor badges can be issued and controlled as well as have officers escort key 
visitors onsite. The force works with Human Resources to issue identification badges 
or cards and entering this information into electronic access control. They input new 
employees into the system and delete and reissue lost badges. In addition to badge 
and ID control, security monitors access to facilities.
Stationary posts are needed for access control, monitoring of intrusion detection 
systems, which include alarms and closed circuit television (CCTV) monitors. While 
not necessarily a security function, security is used to identify and monitor hazard­
ous conditions, such as a chemical spill or other accident, such as acts of notice.
Security patrols can be used to respond to alarms, fire, or other security or safety 
concerns. Patrols can be dispatched to escort fire or emergency personnel to a loca­
tion. However, security barriers may need moving to allow for equipment to respond. 
In one example, for security purposes, a site had closed off the drive adjacent to the 

44
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
building where the fire was occurring. Portable Jersey barriers (modular concrete 
barriers) were placed at the ends of the drive to prevent vehicles from entering. In 
this fire event, the security personnel brought in a forklift to move the barriers so that 
the fire equipment could have closer access to the building.
Patrols also monitor open doors and unattended equipment. During patrol, guards 
can identify and record security concerns, such as broken windows or locks, or safety 
concerns, such as loose steps, hallways lights out, or emergency exits blocked. More 
intensive patrols can check for open files, computers that are left on, and other issues 
mandated by the security policy.
Patrols can be monitored by Guard Tour Wand Systems. This system records 
when a guard has patrolled the area by having an electronic wand touch a memory 
button fixed to a wall or door at the facility. Placing memory buttons in strategic 
places assures that the patrol passes by and views specific areas on their tour. A wand 
is used to record this activity. Managers download the data to check that patrols are 
being performed correctly and on schedule. An example would be a site with mul­
tiple buildings and perimeter fencing. Policy may dictate that security would patrol 
the site hourly. Memory buttons may be placed in and outside of buildings, gates, and 
fences to monitor patrol progress.
Determining the manpower requirements to operate a private response force 
requires a detailed analysis of the security response requirements. Initial consider­
ations should include how many stationary and patrol posts are needed and whether 
the post will be operational 24/7 or just operational during certain times. For exam­
ple, an employee entrance may require one guard present 24 hours a day, but, at high 
demand times, such as shift changes, other guards may be needed. An employee 
gate may be open during high demand times, then closed during the rest of the day. 
A patrol guard can work the gate for the limited period it is open, then go back on 
patrol. Delivery gates may be opened for a full day, but not at night, necessitating a 
guard for a full shift. The security office, with the alarm and CCTV monitors, can 
be strategically placed so the guard can monitor the controls and assist in other func­
tions during slack hours. The security manager should consider that, when applying 
one person to do multiple jobs, it decreases the efficiency of that person. A guard 
called to monitor cameras while manning the front desk will have his/her atten­
tion diverted when people need assistance, during which time, the monitors will be 
unattended.
A question for your company may be: How many patrols are required? Security 
policy or deterrent requirements help determine the number of patrols needed. A 
large facility requiring hourly building checks will need more patrols than a small 
site with few buildings. Patrols can be adjusted for time just as stationary posts. For 
example, a 24-hour patrol post may fill in at a gate during a 2-hour shift change time. 
Patrols also provide staff break relief for stationary posts. A supervisor generally 
assists on patrol and reliefs as necessary. Because of unanticipated events, the super­
visor should not be assigned to a regular patrol. Other questions arise. How will the 
patrols operate? Will the guard be on foot, in a vehicle, or both? Are there specialty 
vehicles that guards will use, such as a golf cart or bicycle? How many people do 
you need to fill these posts? One post, operational 24/7, requires 4.2 persons. The 
security manager must consider this as well as scheduling to justify the manpower 

45
Staffing the Response Force
needed to fill the posts. While most work will be done by full-time personnel, part-
time people may be used during certain times or days. For example, a site calling 
for one guard may employ four guards, one of whom is the supervisor, working 
four 40-hour shifts, and one part-time guard working one 8-hour shift. Days off, 
sick days, and vacation time must be considered. In extreme circumstances, guards 
may be required to work overtime. Scheduling overtime increases manpower costs. 
Employee efficiency decreases with time, so managers need to be aware of excess 
overtime. Instead of having a guard work a double-shift to cover for a sick co-worker, 
it may be advisable to have one guard stay over for one half of the sick co-worker’s 
shift, and another guard come in early to work the other half of the shift. Another 
consideration is time for training or administrative matters.
Shift changes for the guard force should not conflict with the work force. If the 
day shift arrives at 7:30 a.m. for an 8 start time, you don’t want a shift change at 8. 
You may decide that a 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. shift is best so that you have fresh guards on 
as people arrive for work and there is no confusion as to briefing the oncoming shift 
of special needs and circumstances while the urgency of personnel ingress is hap­
pening. A fresh guard should be rested and ready to work. He/she will not be in such 
a hurry to “get this over with and go home.”
What equipment will the guards need? A guard force should be in uniform, mean­
ing anyone can identify a guard for crime deterrent or in the event of an emergency. 
There are normal needs for a guard force, such as uniform shirt and pants, cold 
weather coats, and raingear. A hat is customary, but not necessary. Most uniforms 
are military/police style to present a show of authority, but some response forces use 
a less aggressive-looking uniform, such as slacks and a blazer. Badges also display 
authority. The joke about security guards often refers to “sew-on badges.” Metal 
badges have a show of authority and gain more respect for the guard.
Safety gear should be provided. If a facility has hazardous chemicals, do the 
guards have protective equipment in the event of a spill or leak? Steel toe shoes or 
hard hats may be required in certain areas. Radios, tour wands, and flashlights may 
fill out the complement of equipment needed for duty. If vehicles are used, the secu­
rity manager should make sure that the guard is capable of operating the vehicle and 
is a properly licensed driver.
While the guards may be required to provide some of their own equipment, policy 
should dictate uniformity. For example, most guards will wear black shoes or boots. 
The type of shoe may be left to the user with limited parameters (e.g., shoes must 
be black) or severely restricted, specifying the type of shoe allowed (black patent 
leather with steel toes).
The organization should develop standard operating procedures for the guard 
force to follow. The duties and responsibilities of the guard force, as well as individ­
ual posts, should be identified and published in a procedures manual. (See Chapter 
5, Policy and Procedures, for more information.)
The decision to provide defensive equipment should be determined by policy. 
Consideration as to nonlethal force should be given the same care and concern as 
deadly force. If the decision is made to allow weapons, training should be provided 
to assure proper use. If the decision is made not to allow weapons, policy and proce­
dures should dictate the protocol for the protection of the guard.

46
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Now that you have determined the personnel and resource needs for your facility, 
you may choose to have either a proprietary or contract guard force. A proprietary 
force is owned and managed by your organization. They are your guards, and your 
organization is responsible for hiring, salary and benefits, training, and equipping 
of the guards. Liability rests solely on your organization for intentional or negligent 
acts of the individual guards. A contract guard force is managed by a contract com­
pany (often a company specializing in guards) for a specified contract price. They 
hire, provide salary and benefits, train, and equip the guards. Your organization will 
have someone who will be the liaison with the contract agency. In some matters, the 
guard company may be liable for intentional or negligent acts of a guard. The liaison 
will be responsible for assuring the contract agency is performing according to the 
specifications in the contract and meeting with agency representatives for routine 
performance reviews.
Guards may be represented by a union and operate under a collective bargain­
ing agreement with management. If you have a proprietary force, that is you. The 
security manager must work with Human Resources and legal counsel to assure that 
discipline, scheduling, and promotions are consistent with the agreement.
Regardless of whether you have a proprietary or contract force, a job assessment 
will identify the needs for the guard force as well as begin the process for writing 
a job description. To write a valid job description, begin with listing all of the tasks 
a guard will perform, such as answering the telephone, writing reports, watching 
monitors, operating machinery. Any movements should be documented to justify 
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The ADA protects 
against discrimination of a person who can perform the job functions, with or with­
out reasonable accommodation. For example, list tasks such as standing, walking, 
negotiating stairs, climbing, crawling, reaching, etc. Vision and hearing require­
ments, as well as the ability to function specific machinery, should be included in 
the list. As you screen applications for employment, those who cannot perform the 
functions, with or without reasonable accommodation, can be excluded from consid­
eration. Is it important to write a thorough job description so potential applicants will 
know the requirements and apply for jobs for which they are qualified.
The job description is also key to training. Training assures that the employee can 
perform job tasks proficiently. It minimizes civil damages in the event of a lawsuit. 
Training may be in the classroom, online, on-the-job (OJT), or a combination of 
methods. Contract agencies provide a level of training for uniformity of their guard 
force. A proprietary guard force may be trained onsite or sent to a school that provides 
a basic level of training. Private corporations and security organizations have ready-
made materials for use in the general training of your guard force. Depending on 
specific needs, other prepared training programs may be helpful and even necessary. 
For example, a guard at a casino where alcohol is served may have required training 
from the state gaming commission as well as the alcohol beverage commission.
Guards should be aware of the policies and procedures, company policies, opera­
tional needs, and priorities. Orientation should include a copy of the policy manual. 
After a reasonable time, have the guard sign a form indicating they have read the 
policy manual.

47
Staffing the Response Force
Training should include general duties applicable to the guard force as well as 
specific duties for each post the individual guard may work. Administrative matters, 
such as paydays, insurance, and time off can be disseminated at this time. Additional 
training should be conducted based on the frequency or criticality of a specific func­
tion. For example, reports that are completed daily have a high frequency, so training 
on report writing would be a reasonable training need. Use of force may not be fre­
quent, but highly critical as the improper use of force can lead to injury and possible 
lawsuits. Training the parameters of force will assure proper conduct of the guards 
and mitigate damages if and when force is used.
Other training needs would entail patrol or station procedures, customer service, 
telephone communications, and other skills not necessarily related specifically to 
the trade, but for events that could impact the organization. For example, when a 
guard answers the telephone or gives instructions to visitors, he/she must sound (and 
appear) professional. Answering the phone with: “Yea, what can I do for you?” is 
quite informal and may present a negative impression of the organization. Proper 
procedures should be identified and taught to all personnel.
Training should include all equipment the guard will use. This includes vehi­
cles, patrol wands, weapons, and safety equipment. Guards are often the first 
responder to a fire, safety, or medical emergency. Knowledge and use of fire 
extinguishers and other firefighting equipment is essential. The guard should 
know when and how to deploy and use safety equipment, such as personal pro­
tective equipment, a fall protection safety harness, or safety barriers. Training 
should include OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) rules that 
apply to the facility and specifically to activities the guard may encounter and 
areas where the guard must patrol. Guards should be familiar with any first aid 
equipment and automated external defibrillators (AED), if available. They should 
have a working knowledge of emergency evacuation and shelter-in-place (tak­
ing immediate shelter) procedures. The guard force should always participate in 
all drills and exercises. Most organizations expect the guard force to coordinate 
emergency activities.

ing on public law enforcement. What are the conditions in which organiza­

7 Physical Controls
Physical controls are the tools and equipment one uses to secure assets. A physical 
security survey and assessment is used to determine the physical controls neces­
sary to secure a facility and protect assets. The survey begins with an asset and risk 
assessment to determine your security needs. Identifying the assets to be protected 
helps justify the expense of the physical controls. You wouldn’t spend thousands of 
dollars in security hardware to protect an asset costing pennies. If one area of your 
facility houses high-risk assets, you wouldn’t necessarily provide the same level of 
protection for the entire facility. High-risk assets are any assets that are expensive or 
hard to replace. It could be anything from diamonds to information.
The risk assessment looks at who would want your assets and their level of knowl­
edge and expertise that you must protect against. The thief wanting to steal the dia­
mond may be low-tech and utilize crude burglary techniques with only a plan for a 
quick getaway. The professional engaging in industrial espionage will have access to 
high-tech gadgetry and extensive knowledge of physical control systems to ply his/
her trade.
With the results of your survey in hand, you begin the process of providing physi­
cal controls to protect your assets. This chapter is an introduction to physical con­
trols and only touches on basic information of each tool. Security managers should 
consider taking additional courses or training on physical security controls to gain 
a working knowledge of the various systems. Physical controls should be planned 
with the objective of preventing entry through force and stealth of unauthorized per­
sons while allowing entry and safety to authorized persons. The controls should 
delay unlawful entry until security forces arrive. Another consideration is attacks 
solely for the purpose of destruction, such as in a terrorist act, or sabotage from, for 
example, disgruntled employees, former or current.
THE SURVEY
A physical security survey begins with presurvey planning. Previous surveys are a 
good starting point. If a prior survey doesn’t exist, begin by getting a map of the site 
showing buildings, utilities, and roads around the site. Determine if there have been 
changes that are not noted on blueprints or site plans. Identify future changes that 
may impact security. Obtain crime statistics from the local police to determine pos­
sible threats or concerns for security and safety of personnel.
Next, identify the assets onsite and the cost of loss, compromise, and ease of 
replacement. The value of a specific item that is stolen or destroyed may have a 
severe economic impact, not only by the loss of the item, but the ability of the item 
to create revenue. An oven for a restaurant may be easily replaced, but it could take 
several days to get a commercial one delivered and the restaurant cannot operate 

50
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
until a new one is installed. However, the “secret” recipes relied on by the restaurant 
can bring everything to a halt in the kitchen as well as the threat of competitors get­
ting your trade secret if they are divulged.
Once the assets are identified, review the present security hardware and policies 
to determine if they are sufficient to deter or prevent the loss or compromise of the 
key assets. Threat decomposition looks at each potential threat and the ability of that 
threat to defeat the security measures in place. For example, a truck yard housing 
trailers loaded with your product is susceptible to theft and/or vandalism. Your threat 
decomposition would include identifying potential persons who may be a threat (auto 
thief or gang) and their ability to accomplish their threat (theft or vandalism).
Site Visit and Adjoining Property: Neighborhood
Layers of Security
All facilities have some level of security, however slight. The 24-hour restaurant 
with no locks on the doors may have a safe and a lock on an interior office door 
where the safe is located. Security managers usually take the facility they have sur­
veyed and examine current security and how specific upgrades will provide adequate 
protection for assets. However, not every facility needs large-scale protection. The 
tendency of security managers is to see physical controls as something high tech and 
intimidating. We forget that the simple key in the knob lock, inadequate for most 
applications, is still physical security.
The security manager should be part of the team when building a new facil­
ity or remodeling or adding on to an existing facility. Crime Prevention Through 
Environmental Design (CPTED) allows architects and security managers to build 
the new facility and remodel existing facilities using techniques with protection built 
in. This is helpful when a facility is located in an area that forbids fortress-looking 
facilities. Organizations don’t want their facilities to look like a fort; security can be 
built into an aesthetic design without looking like security. For example, instead of 
unsightly bollards (short, thick posts) lining the street side of your facility, heavy-
duty planters designed to stop vehicles can protect your facility and, at the same 
time, be filled with colorful, attractive plants.
Perimeter
Begin by examining the facility construction. The building wall is usually the first 
layer of defense. A concrete wall protects more than a metal-sided building. Interior 
walls of sheetrock can be punched through with hand tools, affording little security 
once a perpetrator is inside your facility. Doors and windows should be visible with 
lighting so the burglar will not be concealed while he/she works. Most unlawful 
entries occur through the first floor with the front door being the preferred method of 
entry. This does not reduce the need to secure windows and rear entrances—or the 
roof. Rear doors and windows are especially vulnerable as they are often out of pub­
lic view. All exterior and some interior doors should be secured with locks designed 
to withstand forcible assaults or picking. Emergency regulations often require exit 
doors to open outward, exposing the hinges. Commercial doors are available with 

51
Physical Controls
recessed hinges to thwart such attacks. Doors with exposed hinges should be pinned 
to prevent removal of the hinges and entry from opening the opposite side of the 
door. On interior doors, it doesn’t do any good to have a strong, sturdy door if all the 
perpetrator has to do is break through a thin wall.
Windows can be coated with a safety glazing that reduces shattering. The glaz­
ing holds the glass together on impact, slowing down entry. The glazing often has 
aesthetic properties like reducing glare and energy efficiency. Window locks should 
function. Locks should be tested to determine the difficulty in manipulating them 
open. Weak locks should be replaced or reinforced. In some applications, a window 
may serve as an emergency exit.
Some facilities extend their perimeter by providing landscaping between the build­
ing and parking lot, which provides aesthetics and some protection. Landscaping 
can deter various attacks. Trees, planters, uneven landscaping, and soft ground are 
examples of ways to deter someone driving over the surface. Lighting and shrubbery 
also may deter pedestrian traffic. Someone walking on the grass is an indication he 
or she doesn’t belong, providing more time for the response force to be notified and 
to arrive on the scene. Other sites may have the property enclosed in a fence. Exterior 
alarms, closed circuit television (CCTV), and security patrols help detect perpetra­
tors before they reach the building.
Fencing
Fencing can be standard security materials or composed of attractive, yet useful, 
materials. A standard security fence is 11 gauge chain links with a maximum of 
2-inch mesh openings. The fence should be 7 feet tall above ground with 1 foot 
buried. Contrasting gravel on each side of the fence helps maintenance through good 
drainage. The fence should be topped with an outrigger of barbed wire. Some loca­
tions have a Y post to position barbed wire facing out and in toward the facility. 
Additional measures can be concertina or razor wire arranged in the Y post.
Security fencing should help prevent a vehicle attack. Bollards or security-
designed planters work to slow and stop a moving car or truck. TigerTraps (collaps­
ible sidewalks and planting system) are areas designed to withstand light pedestrian 
traffic, but would collapse under the pressure of a vehicle. A common and effec­
tive means of supplanting a security fence with an antiram system is to secure a 
heavy cable at vehicle height. The old adage, a chain is only as strong as its weakest 
link, applies to fencing. When applying antiram hardware, an upgrade of posts will 
enhance the ability of stopping a vehicle attack. Security fencing is being designed 
with antiram capabilities.
Aesthetics and local codes may prevent security fencing from being used at a 
given site. Fencing materials, such as wrought iron, brick, and combinations of mate­
rials, can deter and delay entry while being attractive. High security applications 
may use smaller mesh, thicker wire, and fencing designed to discourage climbing or 
being attacked with hand tools.
With the need for security in urban areas, sites do not have the luxury of space. If 
fencing is used, keep parking away from the fence. Also keep trees and other objects 
clear of the fence so as to provide a clear view of the fence line and not to give the 
intruder tools with which to climb.

52
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Gates allow entry through perimeter fences. You may need a full gate for remote 
areas, but common entrances may be secured with bollards and a guard. Full gates 
should have an antiram system that links with the fences and their antiram system. 
Entrances with a barrier capable of emergency deployment should keep the barrier 
up and lowered when a vehicle is allowed access. Emergency deployment of the bar­
riers should be used as a last resort, considering that the use of force may be deadly 
and the systems are not designed for continuous rapid deployment.
Access Control: Keyed Locks
A secured site must allow people into the facility to conduct business. Access control 
systems are designed to allow access to the right people while denying access to the 
wrong people. Simple systems use locks with mechanical keys. Users are issued a 
key that will open a door or series of doors. Key control is vital as anyone who pos­
sesses the key can open the door. Management must determine which doors need 
locks and who needs keys to those locks. The best systems use commercial-grade 
locking systems designed to withstand picking and copying. These types of systems 
usually include removable cores for replacing and rekeying locks. A lock should be 
rekeyed when a person leaves the organization or when a key is lost. Commercial 
systems are designed to allow for such changes with a minimum of cost. Although 
lock and key companies work to make this easy, it is a hassle and few companies fol­
low through with changing locks and keys. Persons issued keys should be instructed 
to keep the key in their control and not lend it out or leave it where it can be copied. 
A more effective system is electronic access control.
Electronic access control can use a system where an employee enters a combina­
tion to open a lock. This type of system utilizes unique knowledge: the combination. 
As with the key, anyone who possesses the combination can open the door. A more 
intelligent system uses a fob or card that activates an electronic reader attached to 
the doors. Cards/fobs are issued to individual users and can be programmed to allow 
entry only at specific times. They also track when the user has accessed the lock. 
This creates a record of who opened the door and when it was opened. If a card/fob 
is lost, or the employee’s access to an area is terminated, the card/fob can be decom­
missioned, making it useless for entry.
More secure systems use a combination of unique possession and unique knowl­
edge. For example, a door may require a key and a combination to open. Adding 
multiple layers to the system enhances security. A person may obtain your key or 
card, but wouldn’t know the combination. Extremely secure systems use retina or iris 
scans, hand geometry, and fingerprints to secure entry.
Lighting
Security lighting should be designed to enhance observation as a means of identify­
ing perpetrators and deterring persons from unlawful entry by limiting dark areas 
where a person could be concealed. Continuous lighting is the most common, with 
fixed light sources illuminating a given area during dark or low-light conditions. 
These systems operate on a timer or photocell to turn lights on when needed and off 
when not needed. Standards for lighting vary among industries. The Illuminating 
Engineers Society has a minimum standard for lighting applications that include 

53
Physical Controls
security lighting. Other applications may have a higher standard. Lighting type and 
use should assure safety and security, e.g., parking lots should have a light level to 
afford safety while walking and while illuminating dark areas where an attacker 
could hide. Another consideration for light sources is the type of lighting when 
CCTV is used. A color camera CCTV would require a light source with a broad 
color rendition to be effective.
Security lighting is rated by its efficiency and color rendition. Energy costs for 
lighting vary between sources of lighting. A lumen is the amount of light emit­
ted by a source. A typical incandescent light emits 28 lumens per watt (the least 
efficient) while a low pressure sodium light emits 200 lumens per watt (most effi­
cient). Operational costs would dictate the use of low pressure sodium in energy 
savings alone.
The lifetime of lights must be considered as well. An incandescent light bulb nor­
mally lasts 1,000 hours while low pressure sodium lights last 20,000 hours. Longer 
life means less replacement. Another factor is color rendering. The incandescent 
bulb renders light in a spectrum with a color rendering index (CRI) of 100. This 
means there is a broad spectrum of light emitting from the incandescent bulb with 
colors appearing similar to what you see in daylight. Low pressure sodium is –44, 
which means it emits a low spectrum of light with color limited to yellows and grays. 
Flesh color appears gray and colors dull. While this type of lighting is cost efficient, 
it would not be useful for color camera CCTV operations or at a location where 
color-coded materials are used.
Other lights for security applications are high-pressure sodium, which has a good 
CRI and lifespan; metal halide, which closely replicates daylight, even enhancing 
colors (car lots use metal halide); and LED, recently entering the security lighting 
market. LEDs emit 160–200 lumens per watt and can last up to 50,000 hours with 
excellent CRI. The security manager may consider a combination of light sources: 
low pressure sodium in parking lots with metal halide or LED on wall packs and at 
entrances and where color CCTV is in operation.
Intrusion Detection Systems
Intrusion detection systems (IDS) alert the response force when there is a breach of 
a security zone. A basic system includes a sensor, an annunciator, and a means of 
transmitting information from the sensor to the annunciator. An alarm does nothing 
more than tell you there has been a breach. A response force completes the sys­
tem. The alarm notifies you of the breach, and your perimeter and locks should be 
designed to secure your assets until the response force arrives. The earlier you detect 
an unlawful entry, the faster you can have the response force reacting to the attack. 
Common systems use motion detection sensors that transmit to an audible alarm or 
central station using radio frequencies.
There are interior and exterior systems. Most people are familiar with the interior 
systems. Sensors are placed at entrances or approaches to sensitive areas. Doors and 
windows may have magnetic switches that detect when a door or window is opened. 
Windows may have glass break sensors that detect acoustically or through shock­
waves the breaking of glass. Wall sensors may detect vibration or sound.

54
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Volumetric sensors detect motion by the disruption of an electric field or a light 
beam. Beam sensors direct a light path from a sending unit to a receiving unit, such 
as a garage door safety switch. Beams may be directed with mirrors and filters to 
create an invisible matrix of light that, when broken, sounds an alarm. An infrared 
system, commonly known as passive infrared (PIR) sends out a signal and can detect 
changes in temperature between narrowly designed zones. When a person attempts 
to move through the zone, the heat difference from their body temperature and the 
room temperature disrupts the fields and signals an alarm.
Exterior systems consist of fence sensors, in-ground sensors, and volumetric sen­
sors. Fence sensors send an alarm when there is a disturbance on the fence. A shake 
detector is installed on a fence and uses free-floating contacts that move when the 
fence is moved, typically by climbing, cutting, or lifting. However, strong winds or 
animals striking the fence may set off an alarm. Taut wire senses a change in ten­
sion on the fence. Buried line sensors are similar to the PIR sensors in that there is 
an alarm when there is a change in the electric field. A buried line creates a field of 
energy that is disrupted when someone passes through the field. Microwaves act in a 
similar manner as the beam of light by detecting when there is a disturbance in the 
microwave beam. Seismic detectors sense vibrations that may indicate an intrusion.
Fiber optics are used in IDS applications by two means: speckle pattern and inter­
ferometry. In the speckle pattern, light sent through the fiber optic cable appears on 
a monitor as a pattern of light and dark. The pattern changes when the field is dis­
turbed, indicating a break-in. Interferometry uses a beam splitter to send signals in 
different directions at different wavelengths. A disturbance interferes with the time it 
takes two beams to meet, thus signaling an alarm. Video motion detection is similar 
to the fiber optic in that a CCTV monitor can be programmed to alarm when there 
is a change in pixels on the screen. Adding to this are new biometric systems that 
are accurate in detecting anomalies and individual characteristics. The system can 
be set to alert the response force if a vehicle moves into a specified area or it can be 
programmed to identify normal users and alert the response force if an imposter is 
trying to enter a secure area.
CCTV
Closed circuit television is a means of extending your security surveillance. A system 
uses cameras and monitors for a broader coverage than security patrols. Cameras can 
be placed anywhere. Usually, cameras are located in areas requiring additional secu­
rity or in an area difficult to patrol. Remote locations also benefit from CCTV cover­
age. Software can make your CCTV event-driven, monitoring changes in pixel color 
to alert for possible intruders. Technology can capture images and compare them to a 
database for access control. In addition to monitoring controlled areas and assessing 
a developing situation, digital technology can record events and is accessible over the 
Internet. Internet transmission and the low cost for system hardware make CCTV an 
inexpensive addition to your physical security profile.
Cameras can display black and white or color images. Black and white usually 
has sharper contrast, allowing for better resolution especially in low-light applica­
tions. Color is good when you need to distinguish items, such as a security badge 
or uniform color. Lighting is important with color cameras as enhancement from 

55
Physical Controls
lighting may give off false colors. Cameras may be fixed, meaning they are focused 
on one area and cannot be moved. Other cameras are PTZ, or pan/tilt/zoom, and can 
be moved to observe a specific area. PTZ cameras can be programmed to turn and 
focus on a specific area during an alarm.
Cameras should be focused according to what you are trying to accomplish. 
If your objective is to detect, focus can be broad because you are only trying to 
see a person breaching the area covered by the camera; a closer focus, so you 
can later identify an intruder, shows less area. For example, an exterior camera 
monitoring 500 feet of fence line may only need to detect an object the size of a 
person entering the area while a camera in a bank needs to be able to identify a 
person’s face.
Cameras should be positioned to protect them against vandalism. A popular hous­
ing is darkened so intruders cannot see where a camera is aimed. The housing is also 
inexpensive to replace should an intruder attempt to disable the camera with paint 
or other substance. Exterior camera housings should protect against the elements as 
well.
Monitors come in multiple sizes and can be programmed to put a number of 
frames on one monitor. A guard watching one or several monitors will have his 
or her attention diverted with multiple monitors. Software technology to warn of a 
disturbance helps assure that the guard will observe an event so he/she can dispatch 
security patrols to the scene.

8 Leadership
INTRODUCTION
Leadership motivates people. People design, develop, and implement work pro­
cesses, and leadership motivates them to follow and achieve these process goals. 
Management controls systems by measuring the processes to achieve an efficient 
and effective flow of resources for productivity. Like management, leadership can 
be learned. Most anyone has the potential to be a leader. Training and assessments 
generally focus on the potential leader’s capabilities by examining three core skills: 
(1) conceptual ability to create a vision and mission of the organization, (2) technical 
skill in work processes, and (3) human skill in relationship building.
Vision is key to leadership. Good leaders are compassionate when it comes to 
their visions. They can have a zealous focus on organizational and personal goals. 
Executive-level leaders focus on vision and on moving the organization forward. 
They inspire people by creating an ownership in the vision, and with this shared 
vision, enable people to act. Good leaders are willing to challenge the status quo 
and to innovate, which empowers others to also achieve the organizational goals. 
Technical skill deals with knowledge of a specific work or activity. First-line leaders 
generally have more skill and are focused on mission accomplishment. As the leader 
rises through the organization, less technical skill and more organizational vision is 
needed. Human skill means working with people at all levels. Good leaders should 
lead the way by living the values they expect of all in their group.
Traits of a good leader include intelligence, self-confidence, determination, socia­
bility, and integrity. Sometimes difficult to measure, individuals can enhance these 
traits and skills. Intelligence traits include strong communication skills (verbal and 
written) and the ability to properly notice events and direct an effective response to 
events. Self-assurance and positive self-esteem gauge the leader’s self-confidence. 
Determination measures the leader’s drive to accomplish the mission and tasks. 
Sociability implies the leader must possess good interpersonal skills that create 
cooperative relationships. Integrity is the most important characteristic of a leader, 
because leaders without integrity lead only until their followers lose trust in them. 
Leaders with integrity inspire confidence in those under them. No one cares how 
much you know until he/she knows how much you care.
Leaders must be genuine and real. Their actions must be congruent with their val­
ues. They build strong relationships with others. Social skills are essential for influ­
ence, which is the major characteristic of leadership. The ethics of leaders impact 
the ethical climate of their organizations by taking into account the interests of the 
organizational culture. Ethical theory provides a set of rules or principles that guide 
leaders in making decisions. Ethics is central to leadership because of influence. 
Ethical leaders respect the values and opinions of others. They listen to subordinates 
and are open to opposing viewpoints. Conduct and character are two domains of 

58
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
ethical theory. Ethical leaders are open, tell the truth, and hold themselves and their 
followers accountable. They treat all equally and assure that all treatment is fair.
Good leaders have influence, which may come from the position rather than the 
individual. Weak leaders rely on the authority of their position to compensate for 
the lack of personal leadership traits and skills. Some resort to fear to influence 
others in a negative sense. Highly effective leaders influence with personal power. 
Personal power can be developed by identifying and cultivating key characteristics 
that make for the ability to influence. Influence comes from integrity; leaders must 
have integrity, and must be trustworthy at all times. Virtue-based theories focus on 
the leader’s character. Practicing good values lead to increased virtuousness, which 
lead to a more effective leader.
Charismatic leaders are confident and have a dominant personality. Strong moral 
values and a desire to influence imparts a strong role model and trust in the leader. 
Charismatic leaders express confidence in their followers and articulate their goals 
and vision in a way that is accepted..
TYPES OF LEADERSHIP
Transformational Leadership
More than just charisma is required for transformational leadership. As leadership 
is about influencing others, transformational leadership focuses on the morality of 
the leader and in directing activities in a positive way. Transformational leaders must 
have a clear vision of the future and communicate that vision in an understandable 
language that also is energizing. They are the social engineers of the organization, 
and they shape the culture of the group. They create trust through transparency, i.e., 
making their positions known to all and concentrating on their strengths rather than 
dwelling on their weaknesses. Transformational leaders motivate followers to reach 
their full potential.
Transformational leadership emphasizes influence and inspirational motiva­
tion. The individual is connected to the goal of the leader through emotion and 
logic (Northouse, 2006). Idealized influence describes the role-modeling process 
for followers. Strong moral and ethical standards cause followers to imitate them. 
Inspirational motivation occurs when the leader clearly communicates the vision and 
sets high expectations of the followers. Intellectual stimulation encourages creativ­
ity and innovation. Followers learn to challenge their own beliefs and to recognize 
personal bias that negatively impacts mission goals. Individualized consideration 
focuses on the follower with the leader acting as coach, helping the follower achieve 
his/her full potential.
In servant, or follower-centered, leadership (coined by Robert Greenleaf in The 
Servant as Leader, 1970), leaders strive to serve others. They help others achieve 
their goals, thereby nurturing the follower with the vision of the leader. Their deci­
sions consider the impact on the welfare of all. The servant leader reaches beyond 
his/her aspirations placing the goals of the group above personal goals. The leader 
makes sure the followers have the resources necessary to accomplish their goals.

59
Leadership
Within the various attributes mentioned, leaders’ skills are directed toward 
individual attributes, competencies, and leadership outcomes. Individual attri­
butes of the leader are cognitive ability, motivation, and personality. Competency 
examines subject matter knowledge, problem solving, and social judgment. 
Leadership outcomes observe the ability in problem solving directed toward per­
formance criteria.
Career experiences and environmental factors influence individual skills. Career 
experience looks at hands-on knowledge, the ability to handle challenging assign­
ments, the ability to mentor new employees, and provide appropriate training for 
subordinates. Environmental influences are factors outside the person’s control, such 
as outdated technology.
Situational Leadership
Situational leadership is focused on directive and supportive behaviors. Depending 
on the “situation,” the leader can change his/her style for an ideal fit to the follower’s 
needs. The leader assesses the follower’s competency and commitment to determine 
what style of direction is needed. The leader selects a style to match the follower’s 
development level of behavior:
•	 high directive–low supportive
•	 High directive–high supportive
•	 High supportive–low directive
•	 Low supportive–low directive
Development levels also are broken into four areas
•	 Low competence–high commitment
•	 Some competence–low commitment
•	 Moderate/high competence–varied commitment
•	 High competence–high commitment
Take the example of a new employee. He/she may have low competence, but high 
commitment. The leadership behavior most appropriate would be high directive. 
The new employee needs direction to help him/her become more competent. As 
the employee develops competence, the leader moves to coaching, with the leader 
continuing to give direction and adding high support to the process. Eventually, the 
employee develops high competence and the leader can delegate the tasks totally to 
the employee.
Situational leadership has survived the test of time and proved to be an effective 
means of training leaders within an organization. The system works by having the 
leader apply the proper style to the individual follower. It is easy to understand and 
apply. A concern of the system is that people don’t always fit nicely into one of the cat­
egories. With practice, the leader can learn quickly how to adapt between behaviors.

60
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Contingency Theory
Contingency theory is similar to situational leadership in that the leader’s success 
depends on his/her ability to match his/her style with the situation. Contingency 
theory is supported with research that validates its ability to explain how effec­
tive leadership can be achieved. Like situational leadership, contingency the­
ory is not tied to one “best” way of handling a situation, but rather teaches the 
leader to be flexible in his/her approach. Contingency theory sees leaders as 
either task motivated or relationship motivated. Three factors—leader–member 
relations, task structure, and position power—are key in using the contingency 
theory model. The emphasis of leader–member relations is how work teams get 
along. Task structure examines the specificity of instructions and task require­
ments. Position power is the authority of a leader to reward or punish followers 
(Northouse, 2006).
Path-Goal Theory
The path–goal theory looks at the leader’s style, the characteristics of the subor­
dinate, and the work situation. Path–goal assumes that subordinates are motivated 
when they are capable of performing the work, believe their efforts will result in a 
specific outcome, and feel the reward for the work is worthwhile. Path–goal looks 
at the components of leader behaviors, subordinate characteristics, and task charac­
teristics to determine the leader’s impact on subordinate’s motivation. The theory 
works by having the leader look at the needs of the subordinates, and fitting his/her 
style to fit that need.
Leader behaviors include: directive, supportive, participative, and achievement-
oriented. Directive leaders set clear standards of performance as well as making the 
process rules clear. Supportive leaders are approachable and show concern of the 
subordinates’ needs. Participative leaders invite subordinates to share in the decision 
making. Achievement-oriented leaders challenge subordinates to perform work at 
the highest levels possible. As with situational leadership, the leaders in path–goal 
theory will adapt their behavior to the needs of the subordinates (Northouse, 2006).
Subordinate characteristics include a need for affiliation, preference for structure, 
desire for self-control, and task ability. The leader’s effectiveness depends on how 
he/she responds to subordinates with varying degrees of each characteristic.
Task characteristics provide motivation for subordinates through the task, formal 
authority, and the work group. The focus of the leader is to help subordinates through 
and around obstacles.
Leader–Member Exchange Theory
Leader–member exchange theory looks at leader–follower relations being aimed at 
individuals rather than at a group as a whole. While the workgroup has many mem­
bers, the leader’s success is focused on one follower at a time. Each subordinate 
has different characteristics that require the leader to tailor his/her approach to the 
individual. In a workgroup, subordinates may be seen as being part of the “in” group 

61
Leadership
or part of the “out” group. Personality plays a role in this process as a bond between 
the leader and follower grows or wanes.
The leader–member exchange theory focuses attention on building relationships 
between the leader and followers, and between followers. The theory shows the 
importance of communication in leadership. The “in” group works better together 
and is usually more efficient. Members of the “out” group are less effective. Leaders 
need to be aware of this and strive to nurture those who are “out.”
Team Leadership
The study of leadership examines work teams and explores ways to make teams 
more efficient for the task for which they were created. Sometimes, a work group is 
called a team, but the lack of purpose and community is no more than a collection of 
individuals. Teams are individuals who band together and jointly strive to achieve a 
common goal. The study of team leadership supposes that individuals other than the 
formal leader can perform critical leadership functions.
The leader is basically a medium for processing information. The team comes 
together for the purpose of a unified effort in processing necessary information. 
Characteristics of team effectiveness include a unified commitment, a results-
driven structure, a collaborative climate, and external support. The team leader­
ship model integrates mediation and monitoring concepts to a group rather than to 
an individual.
Effective team performance begins with a mental model of the situation. The 
team leader develops a mental picture of the situation and relates it to the team. The 
team then takes action to solve the problem. The team leader must decide to inter­
vene in the team’s efforts by asking three questions:
	
1.	Should I monitor the team or take action? The leader watches for internal or 
external factors that need attention, then must decide if his/her input is needed.
	
2.	Should I intervene to meet task or relational needs? When the answer to no. 
1 is to take action, the leader focuses on the need to be addressed: Is there a 
problem with the task, a problem with group relations, or both?
	
3.	Should I intervene internally or externally? Internal support is needed at 
times when you must clarify goals, facilitate decision making, and empha­
sizing standards of excellence. External support is when you must work in 
the organization to give the team credibility. External support may be gath­
ering information from other functions so the team can function efficiently.
Psychodynamic Approach
According to the psychodynamic approach, learned patterns of family dynam­
ics influence leadership. The insight into one’s own personality is beneficial. This 
approach is criticized because it is based on the psychology of the abnormal and 
focuses primarily on personalities of leaders and followers. As such, it does not lend 
itself to traditional training.

62
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Transactional analysis maintains that there are three ego states: parent, child, and 
adult. We shift in and out of the states in relationships. Transactions are comple­
mentary when they match the ego state of the other party, e.g., an adult ego state is 
matched by an adult ego. Dr. Sigmund Freud identified three personality types as 
erotic (the desire to be loved), obsessive (requiring order and stability), and narcissis­
tic (takes pride in personal accomplishments). A fourth personality type was added 
by Erich Fromm: marketer (adaptable to change). Carl Jung expressed four dimen­
sions in assessing personality: Extraversion versus introversion, sensing versus intu­
iting, thinking versus feeling, and judging versus perceiving. These can be combined 
into 16 combinations. Leaders should learn their own style; understanding your style 
will help you develop your skills in being effective.
LEADERSHIP AND DECISION MAKING
Leaders are expected to make decisions that further organizational goals. Leaders 
need the right information to make effective decisions. The leader needs to know 
what is going on. The trust gained in leadership encourages others to provide the 
leader with up-to-date information, the right information, and sufficient information 
to make an informed decision about the work process. The leader can assess the 
employees to identify their organizational concerns. Leaders should identify pro­
cesses that need improvement and gather data to support a change or status quo. 
Some issues may be evident but misleading, such as groupthink. The data will show 
if an issue is truly cause for concern and help prioritize multiple issues.
Groupthink is a problem where one or more people make a comment that sud­
denly everyone believes on face value without the support of data. Meetings to 
gather data and discuss options should be open to involved stakeholders with all 
present able to voice concerns, with the understanding that each concern should be 
supported with information before making a change. Brainstorming is a process 
that allows people to come together in such an environment. Participants’ state­
ments are not challenged or supported, but accepted as a means of identifying 
the root cause of a problem. In fact, proper brainstorming techniques encourage 
others to build on previous comments. Another method similar to brainstorming 
is the Delphi technique, where stakeholders submit anonymous suggestions to a 
facilitator or bulletin board for the purpose of eliciting new ideas or solutions to a 
problem. It is used as a consensus builder by having multiple rounds of questions 
to get the parties to agree.
An opposing method for decision making is constructive conflict. This method 
puts opposing views at odds and forces them to prove their position and often dis­
prove or refute the opposing position. The leader acts as judge, weighing the evi­
dence from one side against the other, asking questions to clarify points so as to 
come to a conclusion on the best course of action to take. Regardless of the method 
used, a decision must be made. All decisions should follow certain key values.
The decision must align with the mission and goals of the organization. Ask: 
What are we really trying to accomplish? It may be easy to make a decision with 
short-term consequences, but the leader must make the decision with the organiza­
tional mission and vision in mind. The leader also must align his/her decision with 

63
Leadership
the core values of the organization. While a decision may further the mission, it may 
conflict with a stated core value. In the event that two core values are in opposition, 
the leaders must prioritize the values to assure the highest value takes precedence.
Next, the leader must evaluate the importance of the decision so he/she can 
allocate the appropriate resources and time to the decision. The leader must con­
sider who will be impacted by the decision, both in and outside the organization. 
As the leader progresses with his/her decision, he/she must weigh all options. 
There may be obvious solutions, but new information and technology may prove 
other solutions more viable. This is where the brainstorming or Delphi meth­
ods may help identify stakeholder concerns and the buy-in for the decision from 
affected parties.
Now, make the decision. Not everyone, even with a consensus, will back you 
100%. People fear the consequences of making a bad decision. If you make a bad 
decision, admit it, then make the right decision and move on.
EXERCISES
Expand on the following statement and apply it to a security organization: 
Manager and leader are two completely different roles, although we often 
use the terms interchangeably. Managers are facilitators of their team mem­
bers’ success, while a leader leads based on strengths, not titles. The best 
managers consistently allow different leaders to emerge and inspire their 
teammates to the next level.

9 Risk Assessment for 
the Security Manager
For security managers, risk assessment is an essential component of their voca­
tion. A risk assessment is the primary tool used to allocate security resources in the 
protection of organizational assets. The risk assessment looks at an organization’s 
assets, accounting for both the criticality and vulnerability of the asset to determine 
the security investment. The comprehensive process of risk assessment is a process 
of critical thinking. The risk assessment is a methodical process of evaluating cred­
ible threats, identifying vulnerabilities, and assessing the potential consequences. 
The risk assessments are the basis for protecting organizational assets through the 
application of strategies and countermeasures to reduce the threat of, vulnerability 
to, and/or consequences from a loss event.
OVERVIEW OF RISK ASSESSMENT
The risk assessment is a primary component of the risk management process. The 
objective of the risk assessment is to identify risks to organizational assets so as to 
propose an achievable level of protection that is commensurate with the level of risk, 
without exceeding that level of risk, and be cost effective as well. Risk is a function 
of the values of threat, vulnerability, and the collateral damage via loss occurrences. 
The objective of risk management is to create a level of protection that mitigates 
vulnerabilities to threats and their potential consequences, thereby reducing risk to 
an acceptable level. Ideally, all risk would be eliminated. However, in practicality, 
the elimination of risk is not feasible. (DHS, 2008)
The security manager, in consultation with organizational leadership, plays a crit­
ical role in the security decision-making processes. To make an informed, risk-based 
decision regarding the mitigation or the acceptance of risk, collaboration between 
the security manager and organizational leadership is required. For any counter­
measure that is recommended, the security manager must provide all information 
pertinent to the decision, including the nature of the threat, specific vulnerabilities, 
an understanding of the potential loss consequences, and the costs.
The process of risk assessment will not prevent adverse events from occurring; 
however, it enables the security manager to focus on those things that are likely to 
bring the greatest harm, and employ approaches that are likely to mitigate or prevent 
those incidents. Therefore, the risk assessment is not an end in and of itself, but rather 
part of organizational practices that include planning, preparedness, program evalu­
ation, process improvement, and budget priority development. The value of a risk 
assessment is not in the determination of a particular course of action, but rather in 
the ability to distinguish between various choices within the larger context.

Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
The assessment of risk should not necessitate a comprehensive risk assessment 
for an entire organization. There is not a specific risk assessment methodology that 
transcends all organizational environments. There are going to be differing risk 
assessments for differing organizational environments. However, all risk assess­
ments should be rooted in a critical thinking methodology. Risk assessments should 
employ a reflective reasoning process based on an understanding of the organization 
and its environment. The assessment chosen should adhere to the fundamental prin­
ciples of a sound risk assessment methodology. The methodology should follow the 
premise of critical thinking in that:
	
1.	The methodology must be credible, and assess the threat, consequences, 
and vulnerability to specific loss events.
	
2.	The methodology must be reproducible, and produce similar or identical 
results when applied by various security professionals.
	
3.	The methodology must be defensible, and provide sufficient justification for 
deviation from the baseline.
A risk assessment is not going to be comprehensive to all organizational envi­
ronments. Different environments require differing risk methodologies. In practice, 
various methodologies will provide varying outputs, from numbers and percentages 
to qualitative ratings. The security manager must determine what outputs from their 
respective methodologies correlate with the desired level of protection. In organiza­
tions where multiple risk assessments may be conducted, the security manager will 
need to evaluate the comprehensive findings and determine what countermeasure 
recommendations to implement from multiple risk assessments.
The risk assessment also should document existing levels of protection provided 
by the inherent qualities of risk mitigation, for example, geographical isolation or 
existing safeguards. Levels of risk determined for each undesirable event should be 
considered in terms of inherent mitigation by existing countermeasures that provide 
a commensurate level of protection, meaning the higher the risk, the higher the level 
of protection.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) defines a risk assessment as a prod­
uct or process that collects information and assigns values to risks for the purpose of 
informing priorities, developing or comparing courses of action, and informing deci­
sion making, via the appraisal of the risks facing an entity, asset, system, network, 
geographic area, or other grouping. Simply, the risk assessment can be the resulting 
product created through assessment of the component parts of organizational risk. 
(DHS, 2011b)
A risk assessment is a decision-making tool. The risk assessment serves the secu­
rity manager by identifying and analyzing threats and vulnerabilities, and provides 
the basis for recommending appropriate countermeasures. The decision to imple­
ment those recommendations and mitigate the risk, or to accept risk, is that of the 
security management in consultation with organizational leadership. The security 
manager, in consultation with organizational leadership, is responsible for identify­
ing and implementing the most cost-effective countermeasure appropriate for miti­
gating a vulnerability, thereby reducing the risk to an acceptable level.

67
Risk Assessment for the Security Manager
The risk assessment can be processed in a qualitative or quantitative framework. 
The qualitative risk assessment will be based on methods, principles, or rules for 
assessing risk based on nonnumerical categories or levels. An example would be 
where the security manager assigns categorization of risks as low, medium, or high 
based on known data or assumptions regarding the risk environment.
A quantitative risk assessment will utilize a set of methods, principles, or rules 
for assessing risks based on the use of numbers where the meanings and proportion­
ality of values are maintained inside and outside the context of the assessment. For 
example, a security manager could use a quantitative risk assessment methodology 
to assess the risk of loss based on statistical past loss data. While a semiquantitative 
methodology also involves the use of numbers, only a purely quantitative methodol­
ogy uses numbers in a way that allows for the consistent use of values outside the 
context of the assessment. To make an informed risk-based decision regarding the 
mitigation or the acceptance of risk, collaboration between the security manager and 
organizational leadership is required. For any countermeasure that is recommended, 
the security manager must provide all information pertinent to the decision, such as 
the nature of the threat, the specific vulnerabilities, an understanding of the potential 
consequences, and the costs.
ASSESSING RISK
The security manager and organizational leadership need accurate information in 
order to make effective decisions. Security management must have the authority, 
appropriate clearance, and access to expert resources to gain an understanding of 
risk to render sound decisions. This requires something beyond just an understand­
ing of the security issues. It also requires a knowledge of the mission and priorities 
of organizational leadership and the associated cost implications. This approach pro­
motes comparability and a shared understanding of information and assessment in 
the decision process, and facilitates better structured and informed decision making. 
The risk assessment is a methodical process and it should:
	
1.	Define the organizational asset and its context
	
2.	Identify risks to the organizational asset
	
3.	Determine asset vulnerability to identified risks
	
4.	Develop multiple approaches to deal with organizational risk
	
5.	Decide and implement the optimal approach to deal with asset risk
	
6.	Monitor and evaluate the risk mitigation measure(s)
	
7.	Communication (DHS, 2011a)
Define the Organization and Its Context
To execute a risk assessment, it is critical to define the context that the risk manage­
ment effort will support. The security manager must gain an understanding of the 
environment in which the risks are to be managed, taking into account all organi­
zational concerns and risk tolerance. Defining the context will inform and shape 
successive stages of the risk management cycle.

68
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
To determine the necessary level of protection to adequately mitigate risk, a secu­
rity manager must understand the role assets play in an organization. Variations in 
the nature of mission, location, and physical configuration of an organization may 
create unique risks or risks that are relatively higher or lower in some cases than 
with other organizations. The baseline level of protection may not address these 
risks appropriately. It may provide too little protection leaving an unmitigated risk. 
Or, it may provide more protection than is necessary resulting in the expenditure of 
resources where they are not needed. This might reduce the availability of resources 
that could be applied elsewhere.
This initial step of clearly defining goals and objectives is essential to identifying, 
assessing, and managing the areas that may impact the success of your risk assessment. 
This concerns organizational leadership, the mission, and values of the organization.
This also should take into consideration existing risk management tools, includ­
ing organizational policies and procedures. The security manager must understand 
the decision-making process in the organization and the commitment of organiza­
tional leadership to support the risk assessment process.
Organizational leadership and staff must be invested in the risk assessment to 
assure their support and commitment to the process. The security manager also 
should be sure that organizational leadership grasps the technical aspect of the pro­
cess so they will not only understand, but also buy into the risk assessment process. 
This initial portion of the risk assessment process requires communication between 
the risk manager and all parties involved in the process.
In this initial step of risk assessment, the security manager must identify the staff 
(including their skill levels), resources (financial), and other organizational resources 
available for risk assessment efforts. The security manager must be flexible and exe­
cute a great deal of understanding as he/she moves into the risk assessment process. 
The inability of the security manager to recognize aspects of organizational culture 
and decision makers can have a negative impact on the success of the process.
The security manager also must consider existing security practices and the over­
all culture of security in the organization. He/she should define in detail the follow­
ing key areas of security management:
•	 Current asset classification practices
•	 Existing assignment of roles for organizational ownership of assets
•	 Existing asset responsibilities, including tasks and procedures, to be fol­
lowed by the staff members who work with the asset
•	 Existing policies regarding the securing of organizational assets, including 
how violations are reported and dealt with
•	 Existing security awareness practices, including staff educational and train­
ing programs related to asset security
Identify Risks to the Organizational Asset
Identifying a preliminary list of risks can generally be done from a basic knowledge 
of the asset, its function in the organization, and an understanding of its vulnerabili­
ties. This can be completed by understanding the asset, its function relative to the 

69
Risk Assessment for the Security Manager
organization’s goals and objectives, then determining the risks, hazards, resources, 
and organizational vulnerabilities that impact them, which could result in risk. This 
method will provide a list of potential loss situations to the organizational asset.
Risks to organizational assets come from both internal and external vulnerabili­
ties. Examples of internal risks often surround actions (or inaction) by staff and 
failures in organizational systems. All organizations are vulnerable to internal risks. 
This step of the risk assessment will identify weaknesses in the organization’s inter­
nal systems and processes.
External sources of risk can be caused by many factors. External factors resulting 
in vulnerability can run a gamut: global, political, and societal trends, as well as haz­
ards from natural disasters, terrorism, cyberspace, pandemics, transnational crime, 
and manmade accidents. It is the role of the security manager to think critically and 
recognize all the potential for loss.
Determine Asset Vulnerability to Identified Risks
The purpose of this step is to utilize a methodical framework to objectively deter­
mine asset vulnerability to identified risks, which involves:
•	 Determining a formal risk assessment methodology
•	 Gathering data
•	 Executing the risk assessment methodology
•	 Validating and verifying the data
•	 Analyzing the outputs
Determining a Formal Risk Assessment Methodology
In determining a formal risk assessment methodology, the security manager should 
try to keep it as simple as possible while providing as comprehensive and accurate 
data as possible. The more simplistic any process, the less likely it is for failure or 
misinterpretation. Simplicity and practicality will have an inherit value when you are 
“selling” your security program to organizational stakeholders. This will allow you 
to better explain technical loss data to both laymen and experts.
Risk assessment methodologies can be either qualitative or quantitative, but, 
when well-designed, both types of assessments can provide results for a valid under­
standing of the asset-risk environment. Failure to choose a valid risk assessment can 
result in the process being flawed, if not completely unreliable.
Gathering Data
The security manager should gather enough data to provide practical and valid data 
in the assessment. There are a number of potential sources for risk information. 
Some of the most commonly used include staff interviews, historical data, models, 
simulations, and subject matter experts.
Many pieces of data are not known precisely. When an organization has not expe­
rienced a particular negative event, it may be oblivious to that risk and loss poten­
tial. It is crucial that the security manager follow critical thinking guidelines. The 

70
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
assumptions and uncertainty in the inputs should be considered in each step of the 
assessment’s methodology to determine how they affect the outputs. Uncertainty 
in the outputs should then be communicated to the decision maker as well as the 
assumptions that underpin the analysis. It also is useful to consider the impact of 
the uncertainty and how sensitive the assessment of risk is to particular pieces of 
uncertain data.
Executing the Risk Assessment Methodology
The risk assessment methodology the security manager chooses to use is the frame­
work that guides how the data are processed to provide valid results for decision 
making. There are many different methodical frameworks that can be used to pro­
vide the security manager with an understanding of the risk environment and sub­
sequent methods of protection and control to enhance security. In the process of 
implementing the risk assessment, the security manager should critically evaluate 
the assessment tool to assure its validity in providing the information needed.
As the assessment process is implemented, the security manager should begin 
to gain a justifiable understanding of the risk environment. It is within this process 
that the security should develop and evaluate alternative means of protection as well. 
While approaches for developing and evaluating alternatives are as diverse as the 
problem sets, considerations may include:
•	 Reviewing lessons learned from relevant past incidents
•	 Consulting subject matter experts, best practices, and governmental guidelines
•	 Brainstorming with stakeholders
•	 Organizing risk management actions
•	 Evaluating options for risk reduction and residual risk
Validating and Verifying the Data
The security manager should continually validate and verify the data collected to 
assure its soundness. The importance of validating and verifying data is fundamen­
tal to the risk assessment process because it is the foundation for making decisions 
to protect an asset, among a number of alternatives in an uncertain environment. 
The key moment in the execution of any risk management process is when a deci­
sion maker chooses among alternatives for managing risks and makes the decision to 
implement the selected course of action. This can include making an affirmative deci­
sion to implement a new alternative as well as the decision to maintain the status quo.
Analyzing the Outputs
In analyzing the outputs from the risk assessment, the risk manager should evaluate 
and monitor performance to determine whether the implemented risk management 
options can achieve the goals and objectives of the organization. In addition to assess­
ing performance, organizations should guard against unintended adverse impacts, 
such as creating additional risk or failing to recognize changes in risk characteristics.
The evaluation phase is designed to bring a systematic, disciplined approach 
to assessing and improving the effectiveness of risk management program 

71
Risk Assessment for the Security Manager
implementation. It is not just the implementation that needs to be evaluated and 
improved, it is the actual risk reduction measures themselves. Evaluation should be 
conducted in a way that is commensurate with both the level of risk and the scope 
of the mission.
In practice, the determination of risks to assets rarely occurs linearly. Instead, 
security managers often move back and forth between the tasks, such as refining a 
methodology after some data have been gathered.
Develop Multiple Approaches to Deal with Organizational Risk
The security manager should develop multiple approaches to deal with organiza­
tional risk. The analysis of the risk assessment process is often enhanced by devel­
oping various models and techniques from various loss scenarios. The utilization of 
differing approaches is based on assumptions regarding how potential risks materi­
alize against organizational assets.
The risk assessment process should yield multiple process and protection mea­
sures for enabling timely and relevant mitigation of risks by monitoring predictive 
indicators, escalating information on increased risk exposures, and making risk-
informed decisions in an integrated manner. The security manager also should ana­
lyze the impact of these risk mitigation measures while considering the costs and 
benefits of the alternatives.
Decide and Implement the Optimal Approach to Deal with Asset Risk
Risk management entails making decisions about the best options among a number 
of alternatives in an uncertain environment. The key moment in the execution of any 
risk management process is when the security manager, in cooperation with organi­
zational leadership, chooses among alternatives for managing risks, and makes the 
decision to implement the selected countermeasure(s). This can include making an 
affirmative decision to implement a new alternative as well as the decision to main­
tain existing security measures.
Cost considerations can be a key factor in decisions to implement countermea­
sures. Cost-benefit analysis is a cost analysis methodology used to justify security 
expenditure. The cost-benefit analysis is a comparative assessment of the benefits 
from your security measure and the costs to perform it, in relation to the financial 
impact resulting from potential loss to the asset. The security manager should con­
sider costs for all phases of the security project. They may be one-time capital costs 
or recurring costs. The determining criterion in a cost-benefit analysis is that the 
security benefit exceeds the cost. The amount that benefit exceeds the cost is based 
on the security manager in consultation with organizational leadership.
Monitor and Evaluate the Risk Mitigation Measure(s)
The security manager should be monitoring implemented security measures and 
comparing effects to help influence subsequent risk management alternatives 
and decisions. The risk assessment will identify possible risks and the likelihood 

72
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
of occurrences rated in terms of impact or severity and probability. This enables 
the security manager to have the data to develop response strategies and allocate 
resources appropriately. Security management then ensures that risk assessments 
become an ongoing process, in which objectives, risks, risk mitigation measures, and 
controls are regularly reevaluated.
The security manager should evaluate and monitor performance security mea­
sures to determine whether it is achieving its goals and objectives. In addition to 
assessing performance, the security manager should monitor for unintended adverse 
impacts, such as creating additional risk or failing to recognize changes in risk char­
acteristics as a result of implementation of the security measure(s).
The evaluation phase is designed to bring a systematic, disciplined approach to 
assessing and improving the effectiveness of risk management implementation. It is 
not just the implementation that needs to be evaluated, it is the actual risk reduction 
measures themselves. Evaluation should be conducted in a way that is commensurate 
with both the level of risk and the scope of the organizational mission.
RISK COMMUNICATIONS
The foundation for each element of the risk management process is effective com­
munications with organizational leadership, staff, other stakeholders, and customers. 
Consistent, two-way communication throughout the process helps ensure that all of 
those involved share a common understanding of asset risk and factors involved in 
managing it. Effective communication is an essential element in executing plans and 
countermeasures and in explaining risks and security management decisions. Such 
external communications should occur throughout the security management process 
and should be considered integral to effective risk management.
CONCLUSION
The primary role of a security manager is to organize the countermeasures that 
are generally considered to mitigate the risk from a particular undesirable event. 
Security managers are aided by risk assessments to help them in understanding orga­
nizational risk. A risk assessment identifies a generic set of undesirable events that 
may impact organizational assets, and risk management relates them to the appli­
cable security measures.
By determining the necessary level of protection according to a risk assessment, 
it is possible to ensure that the most cost-effective security program is implemented 
without waste or lingering vulnerability. Further incorporating a cost-benefit assess­
ment will provide additional insight for the security manager. The security manager 
should determine whether the countermeasures adequately mitigate risk in an eco­
nomically acceptable manner.
In all cases, the risk management process should document clearly the reason why 
the security measure(s) are necessary. It is extremely important that the rationale for 
accepting risk be well documented, including alternate strategies that are considered 
or implemented, and opportunities in the future to implement the necessary level 
of protection, with these findings communicated to all stakeholders in the process.

10 Computer and 
Information Security
Many organizations collect large amounts of information. The information can 
range from employee records, operational data, customer databases, trade secrets, 
etc. Organizational information commonly collected may contain administrative 
reports documenting various types of data for day-to-day operations or other supple­
mentary support. The fact is that most organizations retain a lot of information in 
their operational processes.
Information is a vital resource for an organizational staff to utilize in planning 
programs and services, and for scheduling and completing reports for organizational 
stakeholders, if not for local, state, and federal agencies. In emergency situations, 
information must be readily available to make a valid response to a life safety event. 
Organizations must maintain information integrity, accessibility, and confidentially.
Organizational information is a compilation of records, files, documents, and 
other materials that may contain many sensitive pieces of data. Information may be 
kept in a variety of formats including handwritten, printed, digital files, and video or 
audio recordings. Information must be accurate and available to make timely deci­
sions. In emergency situations, accurate and accessible information may play an 
important role in safety. Furthermore, organizations’ obligations could have a legal 
consequence if they fail to safely maintain information.
This chapter has three primary purposes. First, it is to serve as a guide to help 
organizations look at information and give it a value. A risk assessment is a methodi­
cal tool to help practitioners look at information as assets to the organization and 
determine a value of that artifact and, then, understand the threats and vulnerability 
as the basis for protection. Second, we will address legislative requirements outlining 
methods for keeping information safe. Finally, fundamental principles in applying 
policy and procedures in the pursuit of safe keeping of information will be addressed.
SAFEGUARDING INFORMATION
Protecting information requires maintaining confidentiality and integrity, while 
ensuring accessibility and availability of information via security, safety, and ethi­
cal behavior. Confidentiality involves the prevention of disclosure of information to 
unauthorized individuals. Information integrity means that data cannot be modified 
without someone being able to detect its modification. Information availability sug­
gests that it must be accessible when it is needed. The information is made safe by 
providing physical and procedural measures, ensuring that only those with specific 
needs have access to the information, and by promoting an ethical understanding to 
all involved as to the sensitivity of information.

76
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Organizations should develop plans to safeguard information. Developing a 
comprehensive information safety plan requires going through a process to assess 
information value, vulnerability, and risk. This process is called a risk assessment 
or risk analysis. The risk assessment is a continual and dynamic process because 
risk management is an ongoing iterative process. Risk assessment must be repeated 
indefinitely. Any time new technology is introduced or changes are made to informa­
tional processes, the organization’s information environment changes. These changes 
present the possibility of new threats and vulnerabilities impacting the safekeep­
ing of information. Therefore, the risk must be reevaluated. The organization must 
constantly balance countermeasures and controls to manage risk to information. 
Information safety involves balancing productivity, cost effectiveness of the counter­
measure, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information.
An information risk assessment is a variation of a more traditional risk assessment, 
which would focus on identifying assets and looking at the threats and vulnerabili­
ties of each asset to potential loss. In conducting an information risk assessment, the 
first step is to identify information assets and estimate their value to the organization.
Identifying information assets requires investigation and asking questions, such 
as: What type of information does the organization maintain? What is its value to the 
organization? Where is the information stored? Is it stored digitally or in hard copies?
Information includes all of the data maintained by organizations and by other 
parties acting for the organization. Information collected by an organization about 
staff often includes personal information, such as pay data, Social Security number, 
pictures, or a listing of personal data that would have varying degrees of sensitivity, 
such as records pertaining to medical and health information. This also should be 
addressed as sensitive information. The organization will maintain information as 
well that may be of a more sensitive nature. This could include information specifi­
cally related to organizational processes.
The security manager should identify information, and also place a value on it. 
The security manager should calculate the value of each information asset. This 
would require a qualitative or quantitative analysis of information to determine what 
that information is worth to the organization. Questions that should be considered 
include: How can we meet the primary mission of this organizational enterprise in 
the absence of this information? What legal ramifications exist if we do not safely 
maintain this information artifact?
The second step is to conduct a threat assessment to the organization’s informa­
tion. A threat assessment of information is a daunting task for educators. It requires 
the knowledge of all the information maintained by the organization and potential 
threats to that information. Threats can be obvious, such as natural disasters or, more 
ambiguous, such as a computer virus. Information stored in different mediums may 
have completely different characteristics and subsequent threats. The threats to the 
file cabinet in the secretary’s office are much different from organizational informa­
tion stored on the network cloud.
A threat assessment should look at each information asset and then determine its 
liability. Threats can include both accidental and malicious acts originating from 
inside or outside the organization. The threat assessment dictates that each situation 
of concern be viewed and assessed individually. Application of the assessment is 

77
Computer and Information Security
guided by the facts of the specific threat and carried out through an analysis of its 
characteristics. Providing a safe information environment is very different and is 
based on where the information is stored.
Threats to digital information are viruses, malware, exploited vulnerabilities, 
remote access, mobile devices, social networks, and cloud computing. Viruses and 
malware can render information useless. Most active computer users have fallen prey 
to viruses and malware that damage and destroy information. Viruses are malicious 
codes that cause an infected computer to spread the virus to other associated com­
puters via the network or email contact lists. Malware, while maybe destructive or 
disruptive in nature, will not have the inherent ability to spread itself. So, while you 
may get a malware infection by visiting a Web site that hosts the malware, it is not 
actually a virus unless it utilizes your contact list or network directory services to 
propagate itself. Either the malware- or virus-infected machine or network can make 
an organization’s information useless (Data Security, n.d.)
A vulnerability exploit is another threat to an organization’s digital information. 
A vulnerability exploit is where a “hole” is found in applications, or systems soft­
ware, that facilitates unauthorized access to information. It will allow an unauthor­
ized user to access information and data that he/she does not have the legitimate 
right to access. Vulnerability exploits are often utilized by viruses and malware to 
penetrate networked computer systems.
Mobile devices are another threat to information safety. Storing and removing 
sensitive information from an organization on a USB drive and then losing the drive 
poses a threat. Another good example is the laptop computer. Organization-owned 
laptops often house sensitive information. The loss of that information to theft is a 
major cause of the loss of information integrity. When computer information is out­
side the organization’s physical network, its threat changes. Having an organization-
owned laptop (with organizational information embedded) outside the logical and 
physical security of the business poses additional threats from both loss and exploita­
tion, and must be considered in a threat assessment.
Online social networking poses additional threats to information safety. Social 
networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, can pose serious threats to organiza­
tional information both directly and indirectly. Social networking sites are breeding 
grounds for viruses and malware plus other attacks to organizational information 
systems. Social networking sites also can allow organizational staff and stakeholders 
to post sensitive information.
Organizations using cloud-based resources must be aware of threats caused by 
utilizing that resource. The cloud is an Internet-based network that allows anyone to 
access applications on a network platform that is leased or rented to the organization 
similar to a utility or tenement arrangement. The cloud extends the system so staff 
and stakeholders have 24/7 access to not only their email, but also personal files and 
applications software anywhere they have a computer and Internet access. For exam­
ple, digitized information does not have to be installed on the remote computer nor 
does it have to be connected to a local area network to function. The application is 
run from the cloud and data generated is stored on the cloud, which can be accessed 
anytime by anyone with Internet service and proper access credentials.

78
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Staff may unwittingly pose a major threat to organizational information. This 
could range from a desperate and disgruntled employee who was just fired because 
of performance to the careless employee who unknowingly releases sensitive infor­
mation. There is no way to completely eliminate the threat of legitimate insiders, 
but, through good safety policies and procedures, information loss could be greatly 
minimized. Careless and untrained employees could unknowingly release sensitive, 
if not damaging information about an organization. Policies, procedures, training, 
and technical measures can play a major role in reducing an organization’s informa­
tion threats (McCallister, Grance, and Scarfone, 2010)
The threat assessment of information is a huge task. It requires the knowledge and 
skills to address threats to the information maintained by organizations. Regardless 
if a threat is from natural disasters or a computer virus, it must be addressed. And, 
once the threat is addressed, the organization should evaluate the vulnerability of 
information to that loss.
The third step is to conduct a vulnerability assessment to organizational infor­
mation. A vulnerability assessment should calculate the probability that a threat 
to information assets could occur. The vulnerability assessment could be based on 
quantitative or qualitative evaluation of threats to information. The resulting data 
should give you an idea of the likelihood that loss of confidentiality, integrity, or 
access may occur so that measures of information safety could be implemented 
(Data Security, n.d.)
Often the creation of a chart or matrix (Table 10.1) will facilitate professionals in 
determining threats and vulnerabilities to information. Either qualitatively or quan­
titatively staff can value information and the threat vulnerability (Elky, 2006).
For example, for each informational asset, give it a value from low to high. Then, 
for each threat vulnerability to the information, give it a value from low to high. The 
intercept of these characteristics should provide the data to make a decision regard­
ing how the informational asset should be protected from that threat.
An overly simplistic example is the threat of electrical surges to render informa­
tion stored on a computer irretrievable. In some parts of the country, this could be a 
very high threat vulnerability and the information could be very highly valued. In 
these situations, it would be worth spending $20 for a surge protector. However, is 
the value justifiable in buying a $500 surge protection system? From the data in this

scenario, we do not know if we can justify spending more money because this will 
have to be balanced in terms of a comprehensive information safety program and 
organization budgets. The point is that, with the risk assessment, we can make value 
judgments based on more than assumptions.
The data from an accurate risk assessment of information value, threats, and 
vulnerabilities will provide the security manager the ability to identify, select, and 
implement appropriate security measures. This does not require that the security 
manager has to be an expert in safeguarding information, but it does assume he/she 
has knowledge of information and knows when to provide a proportional response, 
even if that requires getting expert assistance in completing the task. The security 
manager should understand productivity, cost effectiveness, and value of the infor­
mational asset and its threats and vulnerabilities and, subsequently, how to go about 
protecting it (Elky, 2006).
Implementing a plan to keep information safe in an organization is a balancing 
act. Security managers must evaluate the effectiveness of measures ensuring security 
without discernible loss of productivity. Providing information security is contingent 
upon the security manager understanding the environment, risks, and vulnerabilities 
of technology. Because of the breadth of the issues and complexity of the environ­
ment, there is no more valid approach to achieving an information-safe environment 
in organizations than to promote secure, safe, and ethically sound informational 
practices by all staff and stakeholders. An organization must have both policies and 
procedures to provide for authentication, firewalls, and virus protection on its com­
puter systems.
Authentication will provide secure login and allow individuals to access only 
the data and applications they require. The firewall also serves as an access control 
device that will limit the user access to unwanted programs and data. Virus protec­
tion programs will protect users from viruses and malware on the network. Each of 
these three areas must be addressed by computer professionals in that environment. 
The best role for the security manager is to be aware of the value of information and 
its associated risks to develop policies and procedures to protect it. For the security 
manager, this means working with a service provider or consultant because they usu­
ally have access to greater levels of expertise (Elky, 2006).
Information security in organizations is extremely necessary because of the lia­
bilities of improperly handling information. In many organizations, federal regula­
tions require that they must make information safe regarding who will interact with 
it and how. Organizations must understand areas of compliance and how to safe­
guard the standards and regulation requirements.
FAMILY EDUCATION RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)
Schools, for example, have comprehensive information security measures mandated 
by the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), which is a fed­
eral law that protects the privacy of student education information. Students have 
specific, protected rights regarding the release of information, and FERPA requires 
that institutions adhere strictly to its guidelines. Therefore, it is imperative that the 

80
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
faculty and staff have a working knowledge of FERPA guidelines before accessing 
organization information.
With FERPA, educational information is put into two broad categories: direc­
tory information and nondirectory information. Each category of educational record 
is afforded different safety protections. Therefore, it is important for faculty and 
staff to know the type of educational record that is being considered for disclosure 
(National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2008).
Directory information is the student’s educational record and is generally not con­
sidered harmful or an invasion of privacy if released. Under FERPA, the organiza­
tion may disclose this type of information without the written consent of the student. 
However, the student (or guardian, until a student is 18 years of age or attends a post­
secondary institution) can restrict the release of directory information by submitting 
a formal request to the school. Directory information includes (National Association 
of Colleges and Employers, 2008):
•	 Name
•	 Address
•	 Phone number and email address
•	 Dates of attendance
•	 Degrees awarded
•	 Enrollment status
•	 Major field of study
Educational organizations should always make students and parents aware that 
such information is considered by the organization to be directory information and, 
as such, may be disclosed to a third party. Organizations, however, should make it 
very clear to students and parents that they can prevent the release of directory infor­
mation (McCallister, Grance, and Scarfone, 2010) by request.
Nondirectory information is any educational record not considered directory 
information. Nondirectory information must not be released to anyone, without con­
sent of the student, parents, or guardian until a student is 18 years of age or attends a 
postsecondary institution, and then at the consent of the student. FERPA insists that 
faculty and staff can access nondirectory information only if they have a legitimate 
academic need to do so. Nondirectory information includes (Federal Register, 2001):
•	 Social security number
•	 Student identification number
•	 Race, ethnicity, and/or nationality
•	 Gender
•	 Transcripts
•	 Grades
Student’s distinct identifiers, such as race, gender, ethnicity, grades, and tran­
scripts are nondirectory information and, therefore, are protected educational records 
under FERPA. Students have a right to privacy regarding information held by the 
school. Organizations must ensure that students have privacy of this information 

81
Computer and Information Security
under FERPA. FERPA also gives a student and parents (if the student is under 18) 
the right to access educational information kept by the school. It also gives the right 
to limit educational information being disclosed, the right to amend educational 
information, and the right to file complaints against the organization for disclosing 
educational information in violation of FERPA (Federal Register, 2001).
Students and parents have a right to know about the purpose, content, and location 
of information kept as a part of their educational records. They also have a right to 
expect that information in their educational records will be kept confidential unless 
they give permission to the organization to disclose such information. Therefore, it 
is important to understand how educational information is defined under FERPA 
(National Association of Colleges and Employers, 2008).
Prior written consent is always required before institutions can legitimately dis­
close nondirectory student information. In many cases, organizations tailor a consent 
form to meet their unique educational needs. However, prior written consent must 
include the following elements (Federal Register, 2001):
•	 Specify the information to be disclosed
•	 State the purpose of the disclosure
•	 Identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure is to be made
•	 The date
•	 The signature of the student, parent, guardian whose record is to be disclosed
•	 The signature of the custodian of the educational record
Prior written consent is not required when disclosure is made directly to the 
student or to other organization officials within the same institution where there 
is a legitimate educational interest. A legitimate educational interest may include 
enrollment or transfer matters, financial aid issues, or information requested 
by regional accrediting organizations (National Association of Colleges and 
Employers, 2008).
Institutions do not need prior written consent to disclose nondirectory informa­
tion where the health and safety of the student is at issue, when complying with a 
judicial order or subpoena, or where, as a result of a crime of violence, a disciplinary 
hearing was conducted by the school, a final decision was recorded, and the alleged 
victim seeks disclosure. In order for institutions to be able to disseminate nondi­
rectory information in these instances, FERPA requires that institutions annually 
publish the policies and procedures that the institutions will follow in order to meet 
FERPA guidelines (McCallister, Grance, and Scarfone, 2010).
The Family Education Rights and Privacy Act was enacted by Congress to protect 
the privacy of student educational information. This privacy right is a right vested in 
the student. Institutions may disclose directory information in the student’s educa­
tional record without the student’s consent. Institutions must have written permission 
from the student in order to release any information from a student’s educational 
record (McCallister, Grance, and Scarfone, 2010).

82
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
OTHER REGULATORY ACTS REGARDING INFORMATION
Information is protected by other agencies and groups in addition to FERPA. The 
Departments of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and Justice defend infor­
mation privacy and apply it to the information in organizations. State and local 
entities may require safeguards for handling information in a safe and secure man­
ner. Professional standards of ethical practice of organization, such as doctors and 
nurses, psychologists, and other professionals, operate, may also establish privacy 
restrictions (McCallister, Grance, and Scarfone, 2010).
Drug and alcohol prevention and treatment services for are covered by confidenti­
ality restrictions administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
Some states have regulations regarding employee rights to seek treatment for certain 
health and mental health conditions, including sexually transmitted diseases, HIV 
testing and treatment, pregnancy, and mental health counseling. Regulations also 
protect information pertaining to HIV confidentiality, medical information, child 
abuse, privileged communications, and state-specific information retention and 
destruction regulations (Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, 2012).
MAKING INFORMATION SAFE
Information can be a compilation of records, files, documents, and other materials 
that contain information maintained by organizations. Likewise, information is a 
vital resource for organizations in planning, operations, and in providing services, 
and organizations can be legally and ethically challenged to maintain information 
integrity, accessibility, and confidentiality. Information may be kept in a variety of 
formats including handwritten, printed, digital files, and video or audio recordings. 
Organizations have an obligation to maintain information integrity, accessibility, 
and confidentiality, and information must be accurate and available to make timely 
decisions. The organization’s obligation could have legal consequence if it fails to 
safely maintain information of students (Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, 2012).
Organizations have an ethical responsibility to keep personal information about 
its students safe. Public organizations are further bound by federal legislation that 
provides mandates regarding information. Therefore, it is imperative that organiza­
tions have a plan regarding information security.
The final part of this chapter addresses the role of the organization in providing a 
secure information environment. Providing information security is contingent upon 
security managers understanding the environment, risks, and vulnerabilities of tech­
nology. This chapter also assumes that most organizational information is digital. 
Because of the breadth of the issues and complexity of the environment, there is no 
more valid approach to achieving a safe information environment in organizations 
than to use a multimode approach, which will promote secure, safe, and ethically 
sound practices. Organizations can make information secure by providing security, 
safety, and awareness of anyone who deals with this information. The most common 
approach is to use layers to protect information. There are specific tools that can be 
utilized at each of these layers.

83
Computer and Information Security
Instituting security will require specific technical information that most orga­
nizational stakeholders will not possess. Because of this, most organizations will 
need an expert to install and configure these applications and appliances. Security 
layers include firewalls and routers. A firewall will stop unwanted applications and 
data from entering an organization’s network. Unwanted applications and data could 
be anything from known viruses to accessing social networking sites. The firewall 
can block all network traffic that is unwanted. If you do not want Facebook to be 
accessed from organizational computing resources, then add it to the blocked list.
The routers must be protected on a network. They are like a train station through 
which all information passes. Routers direct information on where it needs to go. 
The router is like a firewall because you can stop information from being dispersed 
into the network; however, its primary function is to direct network traffic both in 
and out of the local network. From this perspective, a firewall or a router can both 
stop unwanted applications and data, but only the routers and switches show data 
where it needs to go on the network. The router is a very critical link for a network.
Network controls are a third primary layer in addressing information safety. 
Network controls include authentication and file sharing controls. Authentication 
will provide a user name and password authentication system. This means that only 
authorized users have access to the network and its information. The file sharing 
controls set an access level for each authenticated user to access applications and 
information on the network. From this perspective, you only give users the rights 
to information that is necessary for their task. In respect to information, you can 
give users rights to read, write, and modify discriminately for each information item 
stored on the network. The keys for network controls are to have a good password 
system and only give users the rights to what they need.
Software layers of safety will include virus and malware detection/prevention 
systems. Malware and viruses can be one of the biggest problems for digitally stored 
information. The best way to prevent losses from these threats is by maintain­
ing adequate antivirus and malware protection software and keeping all updates 
installed on the organization’s computers. Antivirus and malware software must be 
updated frequently. Often a new virus cannot be stopped until the antivirus soft­
ware has the correct definition to stop or quarantine it. Often times, an update to 
a computer’s operating system and applications software is required because the 
manufacture has found vulnerability in the system that must be addressed through 
updates and patches.
The final layer of information security involves creating informed informa­
tion custodians. Information users should understand the value of information to 
the organization. Through training and continual reinforcement, information will 
be respected and cared for to assure its integrity, accessibility, and confidentiality. 
Everyone using organizational information must adhere to an acceptable use policy 
with consequences for violating it. Instill a sense of information responsibility. The 
best time to begin establishing a culture of information security is now.
It is not the intent of this section to address information security from the view 
of a network administrator, but to make the security manager aware of what is 
needed to create and maintain an information-safe environment in the organization. 
Organizational stakeholders should understand a fundamental process, such as an 

84
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
information risk assessment, to view value, threats, and vulnerability of informa­
tion. An organization should be aware of all federal, state, and local laws regarding 
the use and maintenance of information. And, finally, organizations must have both 
policies and procedures in order to institute safety systems for authentication, fire­
walls, and virus protection of computer systems. Only through these measures can 
organizations adequately address information security.
EXERCISES
Sensitive personal information of 105 Bolder Machine Works employees, 
including names and Social Security numbers, were accidentally emailed to 
several customers Monday. Bolder Machine Works director’s office released 
the information of the employees via an email attachment sent to 26 recipi­
ents. Plant manager Mitch Johnson informed the employees whose infor­
mation was disclosed: “We take the safety of employee information very 
seriously, and we deeply regret this error,” Johnson said. “We are reviewing 
the incident and are taking steps to prevent similar incidents from occur­
ring in the future. This should not have happened, and we apologize for it.”
On further investigation, the manager determined the information was sent to 
a group of customers as an attachment when the intended file attachment 
was accidentally replaced with the employee data file by an administrative 
assistant. It was an honest mistake.

11 Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is a topic that has spawned from the computer security domain since 
the profusion of Internet-based systems. Businesses rely on a vast array of computer 
networks to communicate, plan, provide services, and, literally, run our economy. 
The cyber aspect denotes the ability to remotely, if not virtually, access an organiza­
tions networked computer systems.
Cyber intrusions and attacks on networked computer systems have increased dra­
matically over the past decade, exposing sensitive personal and business information, 
disrupting critical operations, and imposing high costs on the economy (Department 
of Homeland Security, n.d.).
There is an increased vulnerability to network systems that have been clas­
sified as critical infrastructures, such as financial systems, chemical plants, and 
water and electric utilities. The role of security management in dealing with 
these environments often becomes a shared responsibility through various orga­
nizational units. Considering cybersecurity takes a multidimensional approach 
because most organizations have administrative technology systems to retain 
everything from employee data to inventories to process data used in the daily 
operation of the business. And, challengingly, a security manager will have a 
role in facilitating a secure cyber environment because, logistically, cybersecu­
rity extends from the organization’s own local area network to the far-reaching 
network of the Internet.
Computers and cyber technologies enhance organizational performance by engag­
ing, involving, and empowering stakeholders. Further diffusion of Web 2.0 technolo­
gies and smartphones provide another interesting dimension to cybersecurity. Staff, as 
well as organizational leadership, have the ability to access, communicate, and process 
data via a robust network platform that they can hold in their hand or store in their 
pocket. Web 2.0 has made the Internet an instantaneous–participatory–interactive–
community differing from the initial incarnation of the Web as an environment where 
you could gather (or post) information and communicate via asynchronous systems. 
Smartphones, utilizing mobile computer operating systems, provide the user the ability 
to interact via Web 2.0 applications synchronously. Web 2.0, combined with smart­
phones, has provided advanced computing and communication tools to its users and 
an additional challenge to maintain cyber-secure environments.
Organizations are increasingly being challenged to maintain a technological envi­
ronment that is cyber secure for all stakeholders as well as for staff and leadership. 
In addressing the assurance of a cyber-secure environment, the first section of this 
chapter will be viewed from three cyber environments: the Internet, social network­
ing, and smartphones, each with their own purpose, attributes, significance, value, 
and subsequent risks. The second section focuses on creating a cyber-secure envi­
ronment by implementing measures to cultivate secure and ethical cyber practices.

88
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Today’s developing information-age technology has intensified the importance of 
cybersecurity as critical as physical security in protecting many organizations. The 
Energy Sector (Electric, Oil, and Gas) has rapidly responded to the increasing need 
for enterprise-level cybersecurity efforts and business continuity plans. Vulnerability 
assessments have not only improved security, but also have demonstrated organiza­
tional commitment to secure organizational environments through cybersecurity.
It is not the intent of this chapter to provide readers with the ability to develop 
a cyber-secure environment in organizations. Technical aspects, such as firewalls, 
malicious code, and access controls, need to be addressed by network administrators 
who can configure these protection systems properly. However, it is proposed that 
this chapter enlighten security managers with the knowledge base that will allow 
them to understand the various factors that construct the organization’s cyber envi­
ronment, so they can provide an understanding to the approach to reducing an orga­
nization’s cyber risks. Minimizing cyber risks in organizations can be best addressed 
by making staff and stakeholders aware of their role in the process. Because of orga­
nizations’ and educators’ place in the lives of students, it is imperative that cyberse­
curity be a portion of the organizational policy process.
THE INTERNET
The Internet is a worldwide public computer network and was originally founded 
by the Department of Defense in the 1970s using Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to connect computers and networks. Since the inception 
of Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) in the early 1990s, the Internet evolved 
from a text-based communications platform to graphically interfaced Web pages. 
HTML fueled the development of the World Wide Web (WWW) into Web sites that 
would be publicly accessible, hosted via Internet-connected network servers, and 
would allow for other media files rather than mere text to be accessed.
The use of the Internet in organizations grew rapidly after the inception of 
HTML. The Internet has become a paradox to the organization, which is that, while 
the Internet is an environment that is beneficial to modern business systems, it also 
contains many risks and hazards to organizations. The Internet is a great resource, 
full of endless amounts of information and resources. Staff use of email has diffused 
throughout all organizations in the past 20 years. Staff Internet access is not only 
in the organization setting, research shows 82% have broadband Internet access at 
home (Rainie, 2011). While the Internet provides many positive attributes for orga­
nizations, it is easy to find sites that could have a negative impact.
Email
Email in the educational environment is frequently used by staff and other stakehold­
ers for sending and receiving electronic messages. Email allows employees to keep 
in touch with family, friends, peers, as well as for business-related communication.
Potential risks with email relate to the inherent quality of the Internet. It utilizes 
a public network architecture where you can communicate with other email users 
indiscriminately. There is no required validation that users are who they say they are. 

89
Cybersecurity
Furthermore, email users can communicate with others through unsolicited mes­
sages. These unsolicited messages (or spam) can vary from sexually explicit material 
to products for sale to moneymaking schemes or to a host for a malicious program.
Another facet of email involves a substantial movement by organizational sys­
tems to use cloud-based network systems. Cloud-based services allow users to access 
applications on a network platform that is leased or rented to organizations, similar 
to a utility or tenement arrangement. The cloud extends the system so staff have 
24/7 access to not only their email, but also shared files and applications software 
anywhere they have a computer and Internet access. For example, some cloud-based 
applications do not have to be installed on the remote computer nor do they have to 
be connected to a local area network to function. The application is run from the 
cloud and data generated are stored on the cloud, which can be accessed anytime by 
anyone with Internet service and proper access credentials. While many organiza­
tions see these as extended capabilities, it also has increased risk.
Both Microsoft® and Google® are providing organizations with free email, as 
well as online communications, applications, and storage. Many organizations are 
using these services of the cloud-based networks because of low cost and limited 
personnel needed while providing an enhanced service to the organization. There 
are risks associated with movement to cloud-based email systems. While it is easy 
to monitor servers when they are run by internal data centers and under the control 
of the organizations IT department, it is more difficult when there is little control 
over servers that are located somewhere in the cloud. Therefore, it is important to 
measure and analyze not only performance, but also security of hosted information. 
It is very important that organizational leadership understand this and know how to 
respond to risks.
Internet Browsing
Internet browsing provides the means to explore information on worldwide computer 
networks, usually by using a browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google 
Chrome, or Firefox. The browser allows access to rich educational and cultural 
resources (text, sounds, pictures, and video). This also gives users an improved abil­
ity to understand and evaluate information and stay informed by accessing Web sites.
Risks associated with Internet browsing relate to sites with inaccurate, misleading, 
and untrue information. There also is access to sexually explicit images and other 
sites promoting hatred, bigotry, violence, drugs, cults, and other things not appropri­
ate in the organizational setting. The Internet, in general, has no restrictions on mar­
keting. Some Internet sites deceptively collect personal information in order to sell 
products via requests for personal information for contests and surveys. The Internet 
is a relatively wide-open interface to share data without any form of censorship.
Online Chatting
Online chatting is a popular communications tool used by many. Online chatting is 
reading messages from others as they are typing them, usually in a theme- or social 
network-specific interface. The inclusion of chatting in social networking sites has 

90
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
helped to maintain its appeal as a widely used communications medium. Chatting is 
popular because it allows users to communicate with people from around the world 
by synchronous typing of text into a chat interface. Staff connecting to others via 
Web sites or social networking portals, in itself, does provide inherent risk.
Chatting is a risky environment because it provides an interface where people can 
communicate, in real time, with as much anonymity as they desire. Social network­
ing sites add a new dimension to chatting because of the ability to have an online 
profile. Online profiles make searching differing demographic groups easy. Hackers 
will befriend users via social networking sites and gain trust by behaving as an 
understanding and trusted friend. Once trust is gained in the chat environments, staff 
can be susceptible to illicit activities.
Social Media
The rise of Web 2.0 and, most notably, online social media has had a profound effect 
on society and organizations as well. Web 2.0 combined with broadband Internet 
access has changed the way people communicate, process, and store data. The diffu­
sion of Web 2.0 has impacted users across all demographic groups. Its technologies 
include social networking sites, blogs, wikis, video-sharing sites, hosted services, 
Web applications, and tags. For users, these tools, which are typically free or low-cost, 
represent a transition from institutionally provided to freely available technology.
Web 2.0 technologies are possible because of the adaption of programming tools, 
such as asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX). AJAX is a group of interrelated Web 
development tools used to program interactive Web applications. This programming 
aspect, combined with diffusion of residential broadband Internet access, created an 
environment that evolved and migrated users to a very interactive form of the World 
Wide Web that facilitated interactive social networking. This AJAX-infused adapta­
tion of the World Wide Web is simply referred to as Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is the current rendition of the World Wide Web that provided a “social” 
approach to generating and distributing Web content, characterized by open communi­
cation, decentralization of authority, and freedom to share and reuse information (Acar, 
2008; Madge et al., 2009; Subrahmanyam et al., 2008). The socialization through Web 
2.0 interaction is exemplified by photo and video sharing (Photobucket.com, Flicker.
com, and youtube.com), wikis and blogs, (Wikipedia.com, TripAdvisor.com, and 
UrbanSpoon.com) as well social networking sites (Facebook.com and Twitter).
Online networking has proliferated through the Web 2.0 environment because of 
an interactive design attribute that has been further propagated by increased residen­
tial Internet access and bandwidth (Acar, 2008; Madge et al., 2009; Subrahmanyam 
et al., 2008). The World Wide Web today has developed into a network of participa­
tion that typifies online social networking. There are a variety of online social net­
works in existence, the most popular being Facebook and Twitter.
Social networking sites combine common characteristics that allow profile cre­
ation, friends listing, and public viewing of friend lists. Online social networking 
Web sites also allow users to create their unique Web presence referred to as their 
profile. Through the profile, the social network users assume false identities while 
exploring friendships and relationships with other individuals who also have profiles 

91
Cybersecurity
on that Web site. Online social networking does not function entirely in real time, 
like conventional chat rooms and instant messaging, so the interactions that take 
place are not always instantaneous even though most have chat room functionality.
Most social networking profiles are developed from responses to questions that 
request a user to disclose a variety of personal information (Steinfield, Ellison, and 
Lampe, 2008; Mazer, Murphy, and Simonds, 2007; Mitrano, 2008). Personal informa­
tion includes user names or other identifiers, such as sexual preference, organizations, 
geographical location, and the extent of the relationship that the persons are currently 
in or seeking with others. The profile also allows for self expression through personal 
photographs and videos. Persons also can make available their list of friends, member 
groups, as well as create an area where individuals can post remarks or statements from 
others. The individual’s social networking profile has distinct Web addresses that can 
be bookmarked or linked allowing others to use and share that data with third parties.
The most popular online social network is Facebook, an online directory that con­
nects people through social networks. The Web site www.facebook.com (Facebook) 
was initially designed and developed in 2004 by Mark Zuckerburg, a Harvard sopho­
more, and was inspired by a widely known paper version of a college facebook. The 
directory consisted of individuals’ photographs and names, and was distributed at 
the start of the academic year by university administrations with the intention of 
helping employees get to know one another.
Zuckerburg’s initial intention was to create an online Web site to help Harvard co-
eds get to know one another for the purpose of finding roommates (Shier, 2005). It 
is no surprise that the Facebook Web site has grown in popularity among personnel 
because it was initially designed exclusively for personnel.
From its creation in 2004, Facebook has grown from hundreds of users to more 
than 1 billion active users (Facebook, 2011). Facebook was originally designed for 
college staff, but now is open to anyone 13 years of age or older. In 2006, Facebook 
lifted its .edu requisites, where users had to have an email address with an educa­
tion suffix (i.e., an email address ending in .edu). With that development, there was 
a mass movement to Facebook as the social networking portal of choice for most 
social network users (Mazer, Murphy, and Simonds, 2007; 2009).
The Web 2.0 aspect of Facebook provides a tool for friends to keep in touch and 
for individuals to have a presence on the Web without needing to build a Web site. 
Facebook makes it easy to upload pictures and videos, making its use so simple that 
nearly anyone can publish a multimedia profile (Mitrano, 2008). Facebook has made 
it easy to find friends using an email address or to search by name or pull up listings 
based on a variety of demographic variables. With a public profile on Facebook, a 
person can be found by the other 500 million users.
Each Facebook profile has a “wall” where friends can post comments. Because 
the wall is viewable by all the person’s friends, wall postings are basically a public 
conversation. By default, people can write personal messages on friends’ walls or 
send a person a private message that will show up in their private Inbox similar to 
an email message. Facebook offers tools to develop and maintain relationships that 
are of particular importance to those emerging into adulthood. Recently, the use of 
messaging via online social networking has surpassed emails as the primary means 
of communication between staffs (Smith, 2010).

Facebook allows each user to set privacy settings. For example, if a user has not 
added a certain person as a friend, the user can have his/her privacy set so that other 
users will not be able to view the user’s profile. A user can adjust the privacy settings 
to allow other users or peers to view portions or all of the profile. Users also can cre­
ate a limited profile, which allows users to hide certain parts of the profile from a list 
of users that an individual selects.
Another feature of Facebook that users like is the ability to add gaming applica­
tions to a user page. Facebook applications are programs developed specifically for 
Facebook profiles. The most popular of these programs include interactive games, 
such as Farm Town, Mafia Wars, and thousands of other interactive multiuser appli­
cations. Because most game applications save scores or assets, friends can compete 
against each other or against millions of other Facebook users.
Providing a cyber-secure environment in organizations is ever challenging, not 
only because of the dangers inherent in the Internet and social networking, but the 
added dimension of users bringing their personal technology into the organizational 
environment that can access a host of technological resources. Users increasingly 
utilize their personal technology, most notably their smartphones, to access social 
networking sites.
Smartphones
The use of smartphones exceeds the use of traditional computers in accessing the 
Internet (Weintraub, 2011; Albanesius, 2011). A smartphone is a cellular phone 
that combines the functions of a networked computing system and a mobile 
phone. The smartphone hosts a wealth of technology and applications (apps) that 
are as robust as a computer in many situations. In addition to the standard audio 
and text capabilities, smartphones typically serve as a video/still camera, audio 
recorder, media player, and mobile computer. They incorporate apps and brows­
ers that can do a number of things ranging from video conferencing, GPS naviga­
tion, and social networking via Wi-Fi and broadband Internet Protocol network 
access.
A growing issue with cyber life and smartphone usage relates to geo-location 
tools such as Facebook Places. These services have become very popular apps, espe­
cially in the social networking environment. The apps allow users to “check in” to 
locations (neighborhood businesses) via their mobile phone. Their location is then 
sent to their friends and in many cases with a map showing their exact location.
Geo-locating is used primarily as a marketing tool for businesses, giving reduced 
cost or free merchandise for app users who visit their store. However, there are some 
obvious security considerations. Every time someone checks into a location publicly, 
they are telling the world exactly where they are. Location sharing could encourage 
stalking, as well a host of other hazardous issues, because the user is broadcasting 
his/her physical location via the Internet or social media site.
Texting also needs to be considered when looking at smartphones and cyberse­
curity. Technically, texting is not a Web-based technology. However, it has become 
widely diffused and has become synonymous with modern youth in the proliferation 
of cell phone technology.

93
Cybersecurity
As most know, text messaging has become the preferred method of communica­
tion for many. While texting, like other cyber technologies has many positive ben­
efits such as enhanced communication for users, it also can create issues for the 
security manager.
This section has attempted to provide as understanding of cyber use by personnel 
with both positive attributes and consequent risks. Providing a technology-secure envi­
ronment is a very broad topic and includes many aspects of staff life. It also is obvious 
that technology will continue to play a large part in organizational environments and 
in the lives of staff members. Therefore, security managers should understand the 
potential role organizations can have in facilitating a secure cyber environment.
PROVIDING A SECURE CYBER ENVIRONMENT
The second part of this chapter addresses the role of providing a cyber-secure envi­
ronment for staff members. Providing cybersecurity is contingent upon security man­
agers understanding the environment, risks, and vulnerabilities of technology use. 
Because of the breadth of the issues and complexity of the environment, there is no 
more valid approach to achieving a secure cyber environment in organizations than 
to provide policy guidance to organizational stakeholders. This approach will use 
the security manager to facilitate safe, secure, and ethically sound practices by staff.
It is not the intent of this section to address cybersecurity from the view of a 
network administrator, but to make the security manager aware of what is needed to 
make an organization’s cyber environment secure. An organization must have both 
policies and procedures available to provide for authentication, firewalls, and virus 
protection on its computer systems. Authentication will provide secure login and 
allow individuals to access only the data and applications they require. The firewall 
also serves as an access control device that will limit the user access to unwanted 
programs and data. Virus protection programs will protect the organization from 
viruses and malware on the network. Each of these three areas must be addressed by 
computing professionals in that environment. The best application for the security 
manager is to provide stakeholders with information regarding the risks associated 
with the cyber environment and, subsequently, how to make them safe, secure, and 
ethical employees.
The task of cybersecurity is daunting because there are so many aspects of a staff 
member’s cyber life that are out of reach of the organization. Members have technol­
ogy and they use it frequently outside the realm of organizational mentorship. They 
use technology to communicate peer-to-peer and often without knowledge, concern, 
or ethical understanding. Therefore, policies, training, and codes of conduct infused 
with cybersecurity, safety, and ethics are important to provide the company’s per­
sonnel with the ability to make good cyber decisions. Teaching staff members to 
be good cyber citizens will better ensure they do not become cybercrime victims, 
or perpetrators, in the future. Because technology is diffused at all organizational 
levels, cybersecurity should be mandated throughout the organization.
One basic principle of cybersecurity is that staff members should be taught to 
avoid strangers in the cyber world. Staff must understand that people are not always 
who they say they are in cyberspace. If a staff member receives emails or other 

94
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
communications that seem suspicious, he/she should not respond, but make security 
personnel aware of it. Another basic principle that staff should understand is that 
they should not access nonwork-related content on the Internet. Be it audio, video, 
or some other media, it should be stressed in organizational policy that this is not 
allowed. Personnel must understand the concept of organizational cyber citizenship. 
At any level of technological interface, staff should be aware, as an underlying prem­
ise, that they must be good cyber citizens.
CYBERSECURITY IN THE ORGANIZATION
Making staff members into good cyber citizens is a goal for all organizational 
members. Computers and cyber technologies enhance staff performance by engag­
ing, involving, empowering, and having security management address cybersecu­
rity as a part of that relationship is essential. Moreover, it is the responsibility of 
organizations to provide basic cybersecurity for the staff, and ethical skills as 
a portion of their organizational process. Educate staff regarding an acceptable 
use policy and include the consequences for violating it. Instill a sense of cyber 
responsibility. The role of an organization in facilitating cyber citizenship is going 
to be even more challenged in the future. The best time to begin establishing a 
culture of cybersecurity in an organization is the first day you introduce your staff 
to technology.
EXERCISES
Many employees are using smartphones to access social networking sites while 
at work. They are using these forums to tease and taunt other employees, 
This, in effect, has created a disturbance in the organization.
•	 Does the issue of cyber threats differ from other organizational threats?
•	 What factors must be considered in addressing the issue?
•	 How should the security manager address the issue?

12 Security Investigations
Investigation is the process for obtaining facts and information for a better under­
standing of an event or to determine the cause of an event. Security investiga­
tions involve fact finding for the purpose of identifying security breaches, loss, and 
safety concerns. An investigation may expose activity violating company policy, 
criminal laws, and administrative regulations. For example, an employee falsify­
ing company records may be disciplined by the company and be subject to crimi­
nal penalties. The company may face a civil lawsuit or administrative sanctions 
for the activity.
The investigative process may be used to gather evidence in the event of a lawsuit. 
For example, an employee driving a company car to the post office collides with 
another vehicle causing injury to the driver of the other vehicle. The police collision 
report is designed to provide a neutral investigation and identify facts as to which 
party was at fault. The efficacy of the collision report can be biased by a number 
of factors: the officer omits a fact not important to his investigation, evidence may 
have been moved or overlooked, or information may have been incorrectly recorded. 
Investigation by company personnel seeks to preserve evidence, statements, and 
facts for future litigation against the company. As an FBI agent, the author inves­
tigated a fender-bender involving a citizen who was rear-ended by a government 
vehicle. The “severe” injury to the citizen’s neck seemed out of place for the minor 
damage noted to citizen’s vehicle; the government vehicle was not damaged. When 
questioned about his injury, the citizen stated that he would likely have to see his 
brother-in-law, the chiropractor, for the next two years. Realizing the mistake, he 
quickly added that he meant the statement as a joke. Nonetheless, the statement was 
recorded and used in later settlement negotiations.
Investigation may uncover evidence of a criminal nature. As the security inves­
tigation develops, information relating to a criminal act should be reported to the 
police. Some jurisdictions make it a criminal act in itself not to report a serious 
crime. Misprision of a Felony, 18 U.S.C. § 4, makes it a crime not to report a 
federal violation to the authorities. When law enforcement agencies are notified, 
they will take over the investigation … for a legitimate reason. They are respon­
sible for enforcing the laws and must preserve evidence in preparation for criminal 
legal proceedings. Your cooperation with law enforcement will complement the 
investigation; however, it also may expose the company to civil and even criminal 
liability. Legal counsel should be informed of any requests for information, espe­
cially court orders. Failure to cooperate may result in criminal or court sanctions 
for obstruction of justice.

98
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW, AND WHY
Common questions to be answered by who, what, when, where, how, and why include:
Who committed the act? Who reported the event? Who has information on the 
event? Who witnessed the event?
What happened? What proof do we have that the event actually occurred? Is 
what happened a crime? Did what happened violate a policy? Could what 
happened subject us to a lawsuit?
When did the event occur? How do we know when the event occurred?
Where did the event occur? Was the event on property owned, leased, or con­
trolled by the company? Does it matter for the company (for liability) where 
the event occurred?
How did this occur? How can we prevent it from happening again? How did we 
learn about the event? How did we respond to the event?
Why did this occur? Why did they commit the act? Why didn’t they report 
the incident?
Security investigations are similar to, if not exactly like, criminal investigations. 
The basic questions of who, what, where, when, how, and why provide the founda­
tion for solving the event. The more detailed answers to these questions lead to the 
identification of the problem and finding solutions to alleviate future events.
The investigation gathers evidence. Evidence is any object, statement, or thing that 
tends to prove or disprove a material fact. The investigator gathers evidence two ways: 
(1) personal observation and (2) the observation of others. In most cases, an event 
requiring further investigation is brought to the attention of the investigator. Discovery 
may be by security patrols, employees, visitors, anonymous tips, surveillance, etc. The 
event may be observed visually, audibly, or through examination of documents, tests, 
or measuring devices. Have in mind the objective of your investigation: arrest and 
prosecution of the culprit, recovery of goods, discovering the leak, etc. Valuable time 
can be wasted by going in a direction that is of no value to your objective. You may be 
more concerned with the recovery of your company’s stolen goods, while law enforce­
ment resources may be best used in the prosecution of the criminal act.
On discovery of the event, physical evidence should be preserved and protected 
from contamination (intentional or unintentional) from bystanders and other curious 
and interested persons. Security personnel should remain at the event scene to assure 
the integrity of the evidence. Searching and recovery of evidence should be con­
ducted immediately, with photographs taken of each item. A diagram of the scene 
and location of evidence should be completed.
Crime scene diagrams should accurately depict the scene of the event. The room 
or area and locations of furniture, evidence, etc. should be measured and recorded 
to show the relationship of items at a scene. Before any evidence is moved, a photo 
should be taken, first with the item only, then with an identifying number or mark. 
This number should track with the evidence throughout the investigation.
Evidence should be stored in a secure area with a notation of the location, date, 
and who seized the evidence. Examination of evidence should be limited to persons 

99
Security Investigations
necessary for the investigation, and all persons who have handled the evidence 
should be noted. Some evidence may need to be examined by a laboratory or other 
people with specialized experience. For example, financial records on a suspected 
embezzlement should be examined by a Certified Public Accountant with foren­
sic accounting credentials. Evidence that is moved for examination must identify a 
chain of custody, again, to maintain the integrity of the evidence. Each person who 
has “custody” of the item, for any period of time, however brief, should be noted. If 
the need arises for the evidence to be introduced at trial, the chain of custody will 
prove that the item introduced at trial is the same item discovered at the event scene.
Witnesses should be interviewed and asked to submit a written statement. The 
basic who, what, when, where, how, and why should be asked to develop facts and 
generate leads for more information. A search for additional witnesses should fan 
out from the scene. In addition to questioning people, look for monitoring cam­
eras that may have recorded the event and potential approach and escape routes 
from the event. In extreme cases, you may need to post signs or advertise for pos­
sible witnesses to the event. Rewards may encourage witnesses to come forward. 
Anonymous witness information can be effective in an investigation. While the wit­
ness’s credibility cannot be verified, the information given can corroborated with 
known information, thereby adding to its credibility. Anonymous sources require 
further investigation, but can lead to the right person for answers and a solution to 
your event. Anonymous sources may lead you to an event before something occurs, 
allowing you to set up personnel or cameras to capture the culprit in the process of 
his/her corrupt act.
Investigators should be trained in interviewing skills to listen and watch for 
deceptive or revealing behavior from witnesses. It is not uncommon for the perpetra­
tor to be among those who witnessed the event. It is good to have two investigators 
during interviews when possible. One investigator can conduct the interview and 
watch the witness for nonverbal behavior and listen to the words used, while the 
second investigator can focus on taking notes.
Interview notes are taken at the time of the interview. The purpose of the notes is 
to immediately record the witness’s statement, paying attention to key facts that may 
have a bearing on the case. At the scene of an event, investigators work quickly to get 
an idea of what happened. Notes are often sketchy and written in a modified short­
hand or in abbreviations or acronyms only the interviewer will understand when he/
she prepares an interview report.
When a formal statement or report of interview is written, it is possible for inter­
viewer bias that will omit a point that does not support his/her position. If the formal 
statement is challenged, the notes are used to clarify the statement. Since the notes 
were prepared at the time of the interview, which is closer in time to the event than 
when the report of interview was prepared, they are more likely to accurately reflect 
the event.
Interviews of potential subjects should always be conducted with two investi­
gators, primarily for the reasons listed above. Two investigators complement each 
other; one investigator may think of a question the other didn’t think of. Subject 
interviews are usually conducted in an office or interview room. If possible, the 
subject interview should occur in the security office. The room should be free from 

100
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
distractions. A picture on a wall can give the interviewee something on which to 
focus. Chairs should be positioned with no table between the investigators and the 
interviewee. This allows you to watch for body language. (??) liked to place the inter­
viewee in a swivel chair. The chair would telegraph movements, which can indicate 
nervousness, deception, or both.
At the conclusion of the interview, a statement should be prepared by the investiga­
tors for the interviewee to sign, especially when the interviewee confesses to the act or 
makes admissions indicating some culpability in the matter. A confession is an admis­
sion of guilt that accounts for all of the elements of a crime or civil offense. Admissions 
are when a person admits to an act, or part of an act, but not culpability for a crime or 
civil offense. Admissions can be used to prove guilt, e.g., persons may admit they took 
a computer from the supply room, but deny that they stole it.
The investigator should prepare the statement rather than have the interviewee 
write out a personal statement. The interviewee may intentionally or inadvertently 
leave out key information. The interviewee is given the statement and time to read it 
and make corrections before acknowledging the statement as a true reflection of his 
or her comments. Interview notes are always retained.
A polygraph exam may be conducted to assess the veracity of witness or sus­
pect statements. Polygraph exams are administered by trained and licensed exam­
iners who read the results of physiological data collected from the examinee. The 
examiner uses the results to form an opinion on the truthfulness of the examinee. 
The Employee Polygraph Protection Act limits employers’ use of polygraph exams. 
Generally, covered employers cannot require or request that an employee take a poly­
graph exam. Exemptions from the act are government agencies, and some security 
related firms, such as an alarm or guard service.
All evidence, records, and statements should be stored in an investigation file. A 
filing system should be established so files can be found and accessed efficiently. The 
file should identify the location of evidence and list the status of the case. An inves­
tigative report should summarize all of the evidence and list potential witnesses and 
their potential testimony. A complete history of suspects should be included as well.
THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORT
When all of the evidence has been collected and examined, statements taken, and 
reports received, the case file should be reviewed and material prepared and included 
into a report. (See below for a format for investigative reports.) The investigative 
report begins with a statement of the event and persons responsible or liable for the 
event. Provide a synopsis of the matter so that the reader can get the general idea of 
what happened and what action you are proposing. Your action may suggest criminal 
prosecution; civil remedies that may include employee disciplinary action, changes 
to policy, or preparation from civil action against the organization.
A Table of Contents page helps the reader move quickly to key areas in the report. 
The Appendix will contain detailed reports and other documents useful for prosecu­
tion or civil action, or defense from prosecution or civil action. In between the Table 
of Contents and Appendix are summaries listed according to key evidence.

Because this document may go outside the organization and even become public 
in a trial, trade secrets and other proprietary information should be noted, but not 
included in your report. The caution here is not to try and conceal or misinterpret 
evidence. All evidence should be noted, with confidential material being identified 
as such. Attorneys will deal with disclosure in deciding to prosecute a matter.

13 Security Management 
for Chemicals and 
the Chemical Facility 
Antiterrorism Standards
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS
Chemicals pose a great risk to many organizations and a challenge to security man­
agers. The concern of this chapter is not just with organizations that produce or 
store large chemical stockpiles, but also those facilities that use chemicals that are 
secondary to their primary mission. The focus of this chapter is going to be on the 
impact that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has had on the regulation 
and security required by those organizations that use and store chemical inventories. 
This chapter relies heavily on DHS documents to try and simplify the chemical regu­
lation process and the subsequent role for security management. DHS provided its 
Chemical Facility Antiterrorism Standards as a framework for securing chemicals 
from the possibility of harm or theft by terrorist groups. DHS has the authority to 
regulate chemical facilities that present high levels of security risk.
On October 4, 2006, President George W. Bush signed the Department of 
Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007, which provides DHS with the 
authority to regulate the security of chemical facilities. The Chemical Facility 
Antiterrorism Standards (CFATS), 6 CFR Part 27 Interim Final Rule (IFR) was pub­
lished on April 9, 2007 (DHS, 2007a). The purpose of 6 CFR Part 27 is to lower 
the risk posed by certain chemical facilities. CFATS requires chemical facilities to 
provide DHS with information to determine whether they are a covered facility and 
are required to meet certain security performance requirements. In order to identify 
high-risk chemical facilities, DHS has identified chemicals for preliminary screening 
based on the belief that such chemicals, if released, stolen, diverted, and/or contami­
nated have the potential to create significant human health and/or life consequences.
If a facility possesses a chemical that is on the DHS chemicals of interest list in 
6 CFR Part 27, Appendix A, at or above the screening threshold quantity for any 
applicable security issue, the facility must complete and submit a chemical security 
assessment, know as Top-Screen, under DHS 6 CFR § 27.200 of CFATS. This autho­
rizes DHS to collect information from chemical facilities on a broad range of topics 
related to the potential consequences of or vulnerabilities to an attack or incident. 
The CSAT Top-Screen is one method DHS may use to gather such information. The 

104
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Top-Screen is available through CSAT, a secure, Web-based system. After analyzing 
a facility’s Top-Screen information, DHS will make a preliminary determination of 
whether a facility presents a high level of security risk and, therefore, must comply 
with additional requirements of CFATS (see Appendix C at the back of this book).
Organizations that have to adhere to this standard are extensive. DHS has 
attempted to identify facilities covered by its chemical security regulation. Facilities 
that may be required to comply with at least some provisions of the CFATS regula­
tion will largely fall into the following categories:
•	 Chemical manufacturing, storage, and distribution
•	 Energy and utilities
•	 Agriculture and food
•	 Paints and coatings
•	 Explosives
•	 Mining
•	 Electronics
•	 Plastics
•	 Healthcare (DHS, 2007b)
To determine which chemical facilities meet the CFATS criteria for high-risk 
chemical facilities, the department developed the Chemical Security Assessment 
Tool (CSAT) Top-Screen, an easy-to-use, online questionnaire that must be com­
pleted by facilities that possessed any chemicals on the CFATS chemicals of interest 
list at or above the listed quantity for each chemical.
Exemptions to CFATS regulations include:
•	 Facilities regulated pursuant to the Maritime Transportation Safety Act (MTSA)
•	 Public water systems, as defined in the Safe Drinking Water Act
•	 Water treatment facilities, as defined in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
•	 Facilities owned or operated by the Department of Defense or the 
Department of Energy
•	 Facilities subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
(DHS, 2007b)
The Department of Homeland Security does not currently regulate railroad facil­
ities that are used to store large quantities of chemicals or materials in rail cars 
that are on the DHS chemical of interest list and does not request that railroads 
complete the CSAT Top-Screen. Likewise, the department has no intention at this 
time of requiring long-haul natural gas pipelines to complete the CSAT Top-Screen; 
however, chemical facilities otherwise covered by this regulation and with a pipe­
line within their boundaries must identify the pipeline as an asset and address it, as 
appropriate, in the Site Security Plan (DHS, 2007b).
Under CFATS, Congress directed the Department of Homeland Security to iden­
tify and secure those chemical facilities that present the greatest security risk. From 
their definition, security risk is a function of the following:

105
Security Management for Chemicals
•	 The consequence of a successful attack on a facility
•	 The likelihood that an attack on a facility will be successful (vulnerability)
•	 The intent and capability of an adversary in respect to attacking a facil­
ity (threat).
Therefore, Congress and the administration have directed the department to 
ensure the security of specifically high-risk chemical facilities.
Risk-Based Performance Standards
Because each chemical facility faces different security challenges, Congress explic­
itly directed the department to issue regulations establishing risk-based performance 
standards for security chemical facilities. Performance standards are particularly 
appropriate in a security context because they provide individual facilities the flex­
ibility to address their unique security challenges. Using performance standards 
rather than prescriptive standards also helps to increase the overall security of 
the sector by varying the security practices used by different chemical facilities. 
Security measures that differ from facility to facility mean that each presents a new 
and unique problem for an adversary to solve.
Risk-Based Tiering
The department has developed a risk-based tiering structure that will allow it to 
focus resources on the high-risk chemical facilities. To that end, the department will 
assign facilities to one of four risk-based tiers ranging from high (Tier 1) to low (Tier 
4) risk (DHS, 2007b).
Assignment of tiers is based on an assessment of the potential consequences of a 
successful attack on assets associated with chemicals of interest. The Department of 
Homeland Security uses information submitted by facilities through the Top-Screen 
and security vulnerability assessment processes to identify a facility’s risk, which is 
a function of the potential impacts of an attack, the likelihood that an attack on the 
facility would be successful, and the likelihood that such an attack would occur at 
the facility.
Facilities that complete the CSAT Top-Screen and do not meet the consequence 
thresholds do not need to comply with CFATS. DHS recognizes that facilities have 
dedicated and invested time, resources, and capital to identify vulnerabilities and 
improve overall security. Facilities will be able to make use of information from 
these improvements. Facilities also may leverage their existing security measures 
in working toward compliance with CFATS and, specifically, the risk-based perfor­
mance standards.
DHS considers a variety of factors in determining the appropriate tier for each 
high-risk facility, including information about the public health and safety risk, as 
well as the presence of chemicals with a critical impact on the governance mission 
and the economy.
The security measures needed to satisfy the risk-based performance standards 
for each covered facility correspond to the security risks presented by the facility. 

106
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Accordingly, facilities that present a higher risk will be required to meet more rigor­
ous risk-based performance standards.
The Top-Screen Process
The first step for a facility to take in determining whether it is covered under CFATS 
is to review the exemptions. Unless a facility is exempt, it must review to deter­
mine whether it possesses any chemicals of interest at or above the listed screen­
ing threshold quantities. DHS has listed the security issue(s) associated with each 
chemical of interest; each chemical presents at least one security issue, and some 
chemicals present multiple security issues. Where there are multiple security issues 
associated with a chemical, a facility must complete and submit a Top-Screen if 
it meets or exceeds the screening threshold quantities for any of the applicable 
security issues. If a facility determines that it possesses a chemical of interest at 
or above any applicable screening threshold quantities, the facility must register 
with DHS for access to DHS CSAT1 and complete the Top-Screen survey applica­
tion. Using the information submitted via the Top-Screen survey application, DHS 
will make a preliminary determination whether the facility presents a high level of 
security risk.
The CSAT Top-Screen follows a logical, two-step data collection process 
(DHS, 2007c):
	
1.	Step one involves collecting basic facility identification information.
	
2.	Step two involves collecting information about the chemicals a facility pos­
sesses, manufactures, processes, uses, stores, and/or distributes.
Questions cover the following security issues:
•	 Release-toxic, release-flammable, and release-explosive chemicals with the 
potential for impacts within and beyond a facility
•	 Theft of explosive/improvised explosive device precursor (Theft/Diversion-
EXP/IEDP) chemicals, theft of weapon of mass effect (Theft/Diversion-
WME) chemicals, and theft of chemical weapon/chemical weapon 
precursor (Theft/Diversion-CW/CWP) chemicals
•	 Sabotage/contamination chemicals
•	 Chemicals that are critical to Government Mission and National Economy
The Top-Screen also provides additional questions for each of the following facil­
ity types:
•	 Petroleum refining facilities
•	 Liquefied natural gas storage facilities (DHS, 2007c)
Upon completion of the Top-Screen, facilities will be presented with one of two 
outcomes: (1) a preliminary determination that a facility is not high risk or (2) that a 
facility is high risk, and then DHS will notify the facility of:

107
Security Management for Chemicals
•	 Its preliminary status as a high-risk facility.
•	 Its preliminary placement in a risk-based tier.
•	 The specific chemical of interest and related security issues that need fur­
ther analysis.
Security Vulnerability Assessments
If DHS makes a determination that a facility is high risk, they will require the facil­
ity to complete a security vulnerability assessment to identify and assess the security 
of a facility’s critical assets in light of the security issues raised by its possession of 
the subject chemicals.
Following a facility’s submission of the security vulnerability assessment and its 
analysis by DHS, DHS will either confirm that a facility is high risk or inform a facil­
ity that DHS no longer considers the facility to be high risk or subject to further regu­
lation under CFATS. For facilities confirmed to be high risk, DHS will communicate 
the final facility tier determination and the facilities must develop and implement 
site security plans that satisfy the risk-based performance standards enumerated in 
6 CFR § 27.230.
Site Security Plans
The Site Security Plan must meet the following standards:
	
1.	Address each vulnerability identified in the facility’s Security Vulnerability 
Assessment, and identify and describe the security measures to address 
each such vulnerability.
	
2.	Identify and describe how security measures selected by the facility will 
address the applicable risk-based performance standards and potential 
modes of terrorist attack including, as applicable, vehicle-borne explosive 
devices, water-borne explosive devices, ground assault, or other modes or 
potential modes identified by DHS.
	
3.	Identify and describe how security measures selected and utilized by the 
facility will meet or exceed each applicable performance standard for the 
appropriate risk-based tier for the facility.
	
4.	Specify other information the DHS assistant secretary deems necessary 
regarding chemical facility security. Accept that a covered facility must 
complete the Site Security Plan through the CSAT process, or through any 
other methodology or process identified or issued by the assistant secretary. 
Covered facilities must submit a Site Security Plan to the department in 
accordance with the schedule provided in § 27.210. When a covered facility 
updates, revises, or otherwise alters its Security Vulnerability Assessment 
pursuant to § 27.215(d), the covered facility shall make corresponding 
changes to its Site Security Plan. A covered facility also must update and 
revise its Site Security Plan in accordance with the schedule in § 27.210. A 
covered facility must conduct an annual audit of its compliance with its Site 
Security Plan.

108
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
Risk-Based Performance Standards
Covered facilities must satisfy the performance standards identified in this section. 
The assistant secretary will issue guidance on the application of these standards to 
risk-based tiers of covered facilities, and the acceptable layering of measures used to 
meet these standards will vary by risk-based tier. Each covered facility must select, 
develop in their Site Security Plan, and implement appropriately risk-based measures 
designed to satisfy the following performance standards:
	
1.	Restrict Area Perimeter: Secure and monitor the perimeter of the facility.
	
2.	Secure Site Assets: Secure and monitor restricted areas or potentially criti­
cal targets within the facility.
	
3.	Screen and Control Access: Control access to the facility and to restricted 
areas within the facility by screening and/or inspecting individuals and 
vehicles as they enter, including: 
	
a.	 Measures to deter the unauthorized introduction of dangerous sub­
stances and devices that may facilitate an attack or actions having 
serious negative consequences for the population surrounding the 
facility.
	
b.	 Measures implementing a regularly updated identification system that 
checks the identification of facility personnel and other persons seeking 
access to the facility and that discourages abuse through established 
disciplinary measures.
	
4.	Deter, Detect, and Delay: Deter, detect, and delay an attack, creating suf­
ficient time between detection of an attack and the point at which the attack 
becomes successful, including measures to:
	
c.	 Deter vehicles from penetrating the facility perimeter, gaining unau­
thorized access to restricted areas, or otherwise presenting a hazard to 
potentially critical targets.
	
d.	 Deter attacks through visible, professional, well maintained security 
measures and systems, including security personnel, detection systems, 
barriers and barricades, and hardened or reduced value targets.
	
e.	 Detect attacks at early stages, through countersurveillance, frustration 
of opportunity to observe potential targets, surveillance and sensing 
systems, and barriers and barricades.
	
f.	 Delay an attack for a sufficient period of time so to allow appropri­
ate response through onsite security response, barriers and barricades, 
hardened targets, and well-coordinated response planning.
	
5.	Shipping, Receipt, and Storage: Secure and monitor the shipping, receipt, 
and storage of hazardous materials for the facility.
	
6.	Theft and Diversion: Deter theft or diversion of potentially dangerous chemicals.
	
7.	Sabotage: Deter insider sabotage.
	
8.	Cyber: Deter cyber sabotage, including by preventing unauthorized 
onsite or remote access to critical process controls, such as Supervisory 
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control 
Systems (DCS), Process Control Systems (PCS), Industrial Control 

109
Security Management for Chemicals
Systems (ICS), critical business systems, and other sensitive computer­
ized systems.
	
9.	Response: Develop and exercise an emergency plan to respond to secu­
rity incidents internally and with assistance of local law enforcement and 
first responders.
	 10.	Monitoring: Maintain effective monitoring, communications, and warning 
systems, including:
	
g.	 Measures designed to ensure that security systems and equipment are 
in good working order and inspected, tested, calibrated, and otherwise 
maintained.
	
h.	 Measures designed to regularly test security systems, note deficiencies, 
correct for detected deficiencies, and record results so that they are 
available for inspection by the department.
	
i.	 Measures to allow the facility to promptly identify and respond to secu­
rity system and equipment failures or malfunctions.
	 11.	Training: Ensure proper security training, exercises, and drills of facil­
ity personnel.
	 12.	Personnel Surety: Perform appropriate background checks on and ensure 
appropriate credentials for facility personnel, and, as appropriate, for 
unescorted visitors with access to restricted areas or critical assets, 
including:
	
j.	 Measures designed to verify and validate identity.
	
k.	 Measures designed to check criminal history.
	
l.	 Measures designed to verify and validate legal authorization to work.
	
m.	 Measures designed to identify people with terrorist ties.
	 13.	Elevated Threats: Escalate the level of protective measures for periods of 
elevated threat.

gate, report, and maintain records of significant security incidents and sus­
picious activities in or near the site. 
	 17.	Officials and Organization: Establish official(s) and an organization respon­
sible for security and for compliance with these standards.
	 18.	Records: Maintain appropriate records.
	 19.	Address any additional performance standards the assistant secretary may 
specify (DHS, 2007c).
Since 9-11, the security of chemicals have become heavily regulated by the 
DHS. Chemicals pose a great challenge to security managers. The concern of 
this chapter is not just with organizations that produce or store large chemi­
cal stockpiles, but also those facilities that use chemicals that are secondary 
to their primary mission. The impact that the DHS has on the regulation and 

110
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
security required by these organizations that use and store chemicals inventories 
is astounding.
EXERCISE
DHS and the CFATS regulations are concerned with mandatory security 
requirements for organizations that use and store chemicals. As part of this 
process, they must maintain standards of security in protecting these chem­
ical assets. Provide a detailed list of those security requirements.

14 Energy Sector
Security Management
Security for organizations that are in the energy sector are susceptible to great risk 
and challenges for those responsible for maintaining their security. The concern of 
this chapter is not just with organizations that produce or store energy in their pri­
mary mission, but with the impact that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
has had on regulations and security required by these energy sector organizations.
The energy sector represents a very important component of our nation’s critical 
infrastructure. More than 80% of the country’s energy infrastructure is owned by the 
private sector and is integral to growth and production across the nation (DHS, 2011).
The energy infrastructure is divided into three interrelated segments: electricity, 
petroleum, and natural gas. The U.S. electricity segment contains more than 6,413 
power plants, including 3,273 traditional electric utilities and 1,738 nonutility power 
producers. Approximately 48% of electricity is produced by combusting coal, pri­
marily transported by rail, 20% in nuclear power plants, and 22% by combusting 
natural gas (DHS, 2013).
The heavy reliance on pipelines to distribute products across the nation highlights 
the interdependencies between the energy and transportation sectors. The reliance 
of virtually all industries on electric power and fuels means that all sectors have 
some reliance on a secure and stable energy sector. Many energy sector stakeholders 
and security managers have extensive experience with infrastructure protection and, 
more recently, have focused their attention on cybersecurity.
PROTECTING THE ENERGY SECTOR
The energy sector is very vulnerable. In 2008, an analyst in the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) stated publicly that cyber attacks had already been used to disrupt 
electrical power in multiple cities outside the United States (McMillan, 2008). This 
alarming report, and others, fails to describe the extent to which a complex system, 
such as the national electric grid, could be vulnerable to cyber attacks.
Demonstrations of a cyber attack were exemplified against control systems that 
regulate an electric generator in Idaho. In this demonstration, under the code name 
“Aurora,” the Department of Energy Idaho National Laboratory manipulated the 
generator’s controls to exploit system weaknesses that caused the generator to fail. In 
particular, the attack caused extreme vibrations, which, in turn, physically destroyed 
internal components and ultimately caused the generator to catch fire (Meserve, 
2007). This kind of attack, which was demonstrated to show feasibility, is likely 
to be even more effective in much larger generators, such as those in big dams and 
many coal-fired power plants.

112
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
The huge task of protecting the energy sector organizations is much like security 
in other organizations. By using a methodical process, the security manager must 
understand the environment, including its assets, their vulnerabilities, and criticali­
ties to formulate a means for protection.
Identify Organizational Assets and Goals
The first step of the energy sector security management process is to identify assets 
and specific overall goals for the organization. This part of the planning process 
should include a detailed overview of each organizational asset and its relation­
ship to goals. Where possible, objectives should be described in quantitative or 
qualitative terms, and these goals should be measurable. Being able to measure 
needs, as well as outcomes, is fundamental to security management as well as to 
the organization.
The application of energy sector security programs should follow the criti­
cal thinking process regardless of the asset. The asset will have a direct impact 
on the application of the process and how countermeasures are to be implemented. 
Application of this security standard ensures a comprehensive approach to meeting 
organizational security needs in the threat environment, and that the scope of secu­
rity is commensurate with the risk posed to an asset, relative to cost.
The Energy Sector has identified six general asset or system characteristics that 
are important parameters for evaluating the vulnerabilities of its infrastructure and 
developing risk management programs (DHS, 2011):
•	 Physical and location attributes: This relates to the physical location of 
the asset and the role that geographic location plays in the asset’s inherent 
presence.
•	 Cyber Attributes: This considers the impact that cyber systems play in rela­
tionship to the asset.
•	 Volumetric or throughput attributes: This attribute is related to the capacity 
usage of the asset.
•	 Temporal/load profile attributes: This attribute relates, for example, to the 
varying loads the system may utilize based on seasonal energy usage.
•	 Human attributes: This relates to the technical knowledge of the energy sec­
tors workforce in maintaining the sector’s safety, reliability, and security.
•	 Importance of asset or system to the energy network: This relates to the 
interdependency and interrelationships between the larger energy grids.
The security manager must understand the relationship of assets in organizational 
structures and functions. This includes the physical and logical relationships that 
assets have with each other in the organizational environment. It also can relate to 
the impact one asset can have on the other in a loss event. An essential tool for bet­
ter understanding the relationship between organizational assets is through the con­
figuration of an asset hierarchy due to the dependencies with and interdependencies 
among energy sector infrastructures.

113
Energy Sector
Analyzing Risks to Organizational Assets
An effective security management system demonstrates a careful evaluation of how 
much security is needed to protect organizational assets. Security managers must 
realize that too little security means that organizational assets can be easily com­
promised, while too much security can make assets hard to use or so degraded that 
performance is negatively affected. Security must be inversely proportioned to an 
asset’s utility. It is given that there is always going to be risk associated with assets 
and activities. The only way to completely eliminate the risk, in many cases, would 
make that asset inoperable. Therefore, the role of security management is to find 
the optimal relationship between organizational processes, assets, and functional­
ity. While the risk assessment process is more deeply analyzed in Chapter 9, it still 
maintains merit when looking at the overall role in building a security management 
program.
If the organizational asset is viewed through the inventory of potential loss events, 
the security manager must recognize the findings are not necessarily all inclusive. 
For each undesirable event where the assessed risk is either less than or exceeds the 
baseline level of protection, the security manager must identify the countermeasures 
that will provide a level of protection equivalent to the level of risk. For lower-lever 
risk, minimum countermeasures are typically less stringent, but also may be less 
effective in mitigating higher risks, while, at the other extreme, very high counter­
measures are typically more stringent and generally more effective.
As defined in the NIPP (National Infrastructure Protection Plan)-Energy Sector 
(DHS, 2011) base plan, risk is a measure of potential harm that encompasses threat, 
vulnerability, and consequence, i.e., where an asset’s risk is a function of the likely 
consequences (C) of a disruption or successful attack; the likelihood of a disruption 
or attack on the asset, often referred to as the threat (T) to the asset or the asset’s 
attractiveness; and the asset’s vulnerability (V) to a disruption or attack. As dis­
cussed in the sections below, the Energy Sector uses a variety of approaches that 
apply this widely accepted risk management principle to assess risk.
Security and risk managers in the energy sector have extensive experience in 
development and application of methodologies for assessing facility and system risk 
and prioritizing assets to be protected. Such methodologies have been developed 
by a variety of sector security partners, including individual energy companies that 
own and operate Energy Sector assets, professional and trade associations, aca­
demic institutions, research centers, and DOE, as an integral part of meeting its 
longstanding responsibilities for safety and security and implementing its Critical 
Infrastructure Protection (CIP) program for the Energy Sector.
Because of the diversity of assets in the Energy Sector, many risk assessment 
methodologies are used. Some methodologies are tailored to a specific segment of 
the sector (i.e., electricity, oil, natural gas, or their system components), while others 
are used to assess risks at the system or sector level.
The Department of Energy, in cooperation with sector security partners, has 
undertaken programs to assess the risks of key energy infrastructure assets and to 
provide technology, tools, and expertise to other federal, state, and local organiza­
tions and the private sector.

114
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
These programs have involved establishing partnerships with infrastructure own­
ers/operators, state and local governments, and a wide range of industry associations. 
Products include vulnerability and risk assessment-related methodologies, check­
lists, lessons learned, support for policy analysis, and guidelines for various types of 
assets. The Energy Sector also has worked closely with DHS in developing and trans­
ferring risk assessment methodologies. The sector has participated in DHS’s Buffer 
Zone Protection Program (BZPP) and has worked with it to develop Risk Analysis 
and Management for Critical Asset Protection (RAMCAP) modules for petroleum 
refining and LNG (liquefied natural gas) facilities. Given the diversity of facilities in 
the Energy Sector and the wide range of methodologies being used successfully to 
assess risk, a “one size fits all” risk assessment solution is not appropriate.
The Energy Sector will consider such criteria through the Critical Infrastructure 
Protection Advisory Council (CIPAC) as the sector evaluates how best to move 
forward in terms of vulnerability and/or risk assessments that will support DHS’s 
national risk analysis goals and to improve these methodologies.
The desired levels of protection of assets should be critically determined via a 
risk-based analytical process or risk assessment. The process will focus on risk as 
a measurement of potential harm or loss from an undesirable event. Understanding 
risk means understanding threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. The level of 
risk is the combined measure of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences posed to 
assets from specified loss events.
If the existing level of protection is insufficient, a determination must be made 
as to whether the necessary level of protection can be achieved; specifically, if 
the countermeasure can be physically implemented and whether the investment is 
cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness is based on the investment in the countermeasure 
versus the value of the asset. In some cases, investment in an expensive counter­
measure may not be advisable because the life cycle of the asset has almost expired. 
Additionally, consideration should be given to whether other countermeasures may 
take priority for funding. Note that cost-effective is a different determination than 
cost-prohibitive. A countermeasure is cost-prohibitive if its cost exceeds available 
funding. Funding may exist for a countermeasure, but it may not be a sound financial 
decision to expend that money for little gain, making it not cost-effective.
Assessing Consequences
The potential physical and cyber consequences of any incident, including terrorist 
attacks and natural or manmade disasters, is the first factor to be considered in risk 
assessment. In the context of the NIPP base plan, consequence is measured as the 
range of loss or damage that can be expected. The consequences that are consid­
ered for the national-level, comparative-risk assessment are based on the criteria set 
forth in HSPD-7 (Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7). These criteria can be 
divided into four main categories (DHS, 2011):
	
1.	Human Impact: Effect on human life and physical well-being (e.g., fatali­
ties, injuries).

115
Energy Sector
	
2.	Economic Impact: Direct and indirect effects on the economy (e.g., costs 
resulting from disruption of products or services, costs to respond to and 
recover from the disruption, costs to rebuild the asset, and long-term costs 
due to environmental damage).
	
3.	Impact on Public Confidence: Effect on public morale and confidence in 
national economic and political institutions.
	
4.	Impact on Government Capability: Effect on the government’s ability to 
maintain order, deliver minimum essential public services, ensure pub­
lic health and safety, and carry out national security-related missions. 
For example, one DOE Power Marketing Administration (PMA), the 
Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), has used the following screening 
criteria to identify its most critical facilities: economic security, national 
security, public health and safety, generation, and regional and national grid 
reliability.
An assessment of all categories of consequence may be beyond the capabilities 
available for a given risk analysis. Most Energy Sector assets are not associated with 
mass casualties, but may have economic and long-term health and safety implica­
tions if disrupted. However, the redundancy of system-critical facilities and overall 
system resilience minimize the potential for such consequences.
The complexity, diversity, and interconnectedness of the Energy Sector dictate 
the need for assessing consequences at many different levels of detail:
•	 Asset or facility level
•	 System, sector, and urban area level
•	 Regional and/or national level
These interdependencies may have national, regional, state, and/or local implica­
tions and are considered to be an essential element of a comprehensive examination 
of physical and cyber vulnerabilities.
Assessing Threats
The Energy Sector has a broad view of threat analysis, encompassing natural events, 
criminal acts, insider threats, and foreign and domestic terrorism. Natural events are 
typically addressed as part of emergency response and business continuity planning.
In the context of risk assessment, the threat component of risk analysis is calculated 
based on the likelihood that an asset will be disrupted or attacked. Such information 
is essential for conducting meaningful vulnerability and risk assessments. Therefore, 
the Energy Sector strongly believes that relevant and timely threat information must 
be disseminated whenever possible. A number of sector representatives hold national 
security clearances that facilitate the sharing of classified threat information.
The DHS Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk Analysis Center (HITRAC), 
which conducts integrated threat analysis for all CI/KR (critical infrastructure 
and key resource) sectors, will work in partnership with owners and operators and 
other federal, state, and local government agencies to ensure that suitable threat 

116
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
information is made available. Furthermore, the same level of partnership must exist 
within all levels of federal, state, and local law enforcement.
The following types of threat products provided by HITRAC are needed for the 
Energy Sector:
•	 Common Threat Scenarios, which present methods and tactics that could 
be employed in attacks against the U.S. infrastructure.
•	 General Threat Environment Assessments, which are sector-specific 
threat products that include known terrorist threat information and long-
term strategic assessments and trend analyses of the evolving threats to the 
sector’s critical infrastructure.
•	 Specific Threat Information, which is critical infrastructure-specific 
information based on real-time intelligence and will drive short-term mea­
sures to mitigate risk.
More specifically, they help energy facilities, local law enforcement, and others to 
be more aware of potential indicators of terrorist and/or criminal activity.
Assessing Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities are the characteristics of an asset, system, or network’s design, loca­
tion, security posture, process, or operation that render it susceptible to destruction, 
incapacitation, or exploitation by mechanical failures, natural hazards, terrorist 
attacks, or other malicious acts. Vulnerability assessments identify areas of weak­
ness that could result in consequences of concern, taking into account intrinsic struc­
tural weaknesses, protective measures, resiliency, and redundancies.
Historically, the Energy Sector has been proactive in developing and applying vul­
nerability assessment methodologies tailored to its assets and systems. However, no sin­
gle vulnerability tool or assessment methodology is universally applicable. Individual 
energy companies use assessment tools that are developed by professional and trade 
associations, federal organizations, government laboratories, and private sector firms. 
The number of tools in use is large, and the vast majority of significant facilities in the 
Energy Sector have already undergone assessments using one or more of these tools.
PRIORITIZE INFRASTRUCTURE
The Energy Sector is characterized by large networks as opposed to discrete assets. 
These networks are designed to operate with certain levels of reliability, even if por­
tions of them (discrete components or assets) are out of service.
The importance of many of the individual components in the network is highly 
variable, depending upon location, time of day, day of the week, month of the year, 
and many other variables. What might be a critical asset on a Monday morning in 
January may not be critical on a Saturday afternoon in May.
Owners and operators of Energy Sector assets and networks have screening pro­
cesses to identify internal priorities related to business conditions and supply/network 
reliability to help them ensure continuity of operations. From a grid perspective, 

117
Energy Sector
the nation’s oil and natural gas pipeline systems and electricity grid are designed 
and operated with built-in redundancy to ensure a certain degree of reliability and 
resiliency. Industry planning criteria assume that a local grid area can be operated 
even if one asset is out of service. In addition, during unforeseen events, the indus­
try provides mutual aid to assist in emergency response and prompt restoration (see 
Chapter 5).
Regional planning groups for the oil and natural gas industry, and, historically, the 
Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and regional reliability councils for 
the electricity industry, continuously evaluate network reliability. Their functions are 
well developed and understood, and the effectiveness of mutual aid agreements can 
be significantly affected by the nature of an event. Mutual aid partners also could be 
impacted by an event, and a utility might have to go outside the region to obtain aid.
DOE will continue to work in partnership with Energy Sector security partners to 
evaluate and support existing protective programs and to develop and support new 
programs that effectively reduce the vulnerability of critical energy assets. The over­
all strategy will focus on efforts that support the sector’s goals to ensure continuity of 
energy services and business through reliable information sharing, effective physical 
and cybersecurity protection, and coordinated response capabilities.
The cornerstone of the overall strategy is partnership with all key stakeholders in 
the public and private sectors. This approach will continue to take full advantage of 
the extensive experience and expertise of sector partners and will ensure that reper­
cussions of planned activities are carefully considered. Below, we outline the meth­
ods that Energy Sector partners use to assess, select, and implement cost-effective 
infrastructure protective programs, and highlight some of the existing cooperative 
efforts within the Energy Sector.
Develop and Implement Protective Programs
The Sector-Specific Plan identifies long-term technological solutions for protecting 
physical assets, energy control systems, and related cyber systems. Some activities in 
different phases may proceed simultaneously, where feasible, to expedite improve­
ments in CIP.
Throughout the process, DOE will continue to work with security partners within 
the framework of the Energy Sector’s goals that support its vision of a “robust, resil­
ient energy infrastructure in which continuity of business and services is maintained 
through secure and reliable information sharing, effective risk management pro­
grams, coordinated response capabilities, and trusted relationships between public 
and private security partners at all levels of industry and government.”
Implement the Security Programs
When the security manager completes the critical analysis via asset criticality and 
vulnerability studies, risk assessments, and cost benefit analysis, then he/she may 
implement the security measures that have been determined to best fit the asset risk. 
Implementation of new security programs are best accomplished through stages to 
make it easier for the organization to adapt to changes in the working environment. 
The security manager and organizational management should understand that there 

118
Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach
may be user resistance to security functions. It is recommended that staged imple­
mentation be performed starting with the most critical or vulnerable assets.
Assignments and Timelines
As the organization implements security measures, it must establish timelines for 
completing the associated tasks to complete them. This portion of the security 
implementation process should consider the abilities of staff members and the time 
necessary to realistically complete projects. The amount of preparation required to 
implement security measures may limit its immediate achievability. If the security 
measure is no capital cost, such as policy and procedural changes, or can be incorpo­
rated into a new project, the countermeasure often can be implemented immediately. 
When countermeasures require advance budgeting or coordination with outside ven­
dors, implementation may be delayed.
Monitor for Compliance
Effective security management depends on adequate compliance monitoring. Most 
often, violations of security practices, whether intentional or unintentional, become 
more frequent and serious if not detected and acted on. Compliance monitoring is 
two primary activities: detecting security violations and responding to them.
The security manager should document the response to violations, and follow 
up immediately after noncompliance is detected. The organization should have a 
designated response group to deal with security violations. Members of the response 
group should have access to organizational leadership so that severe situations can 
be dealt with when needed.
A critical part of noncompliance should be the generation of reports for orga­
nizational leadership that discusses security violations. An additional objective of 
monitoring security measures for noncompliance is to identify potential security 
violations before they dilute the effectiveness of the program or before they cause 
serious damage.
Reevaluate Assets and Risks
Security management is a discipline that should be dynamic. As changes in the 
organization or assets occur, a reassessment of the security measures also should 
occur. Organizational leadership should keep security management abreast of larger 
changes in the organization so that security operations and measures are prepared 
to meet these challenges. The importance of sector assets is impacted by changing 
threats and continually changing consequences. Prioritization in the Energy Sector 
is dynamic—it changes constantly and goes on continuously. Static prioritization 
of Energy Sector assets could lead to critical decision making based on outdated 
or erroneous asset information in efforts to direct scarce resources to these assets, 
systems, and networks that may be the most critical at any point in time. DOE works 
with DHS to identify gaps in existing energy information and to identify publicly 
available databases or sources that could provide data to support DHS efforts to 
prioritize assets.
Some DHS, DOE, and other government programs need to allocate resources 
based on their prioritization (e.g., DHS’s BZPP), Site Assistance Visits, and 

119
Energy Sector
comprehensive reviews, as well as state and local initiatives). These programs sup­
plement and support industry efforts. State and local efforts under the NIPP will 
be based on some measure of the relative importance, risk consequence, and vul­
nerability of the critical infrastructures within their jurisdictions. This will require 
that they work with the Energy Sectors in their jurisdictions so as to understand the 
importance of critical facilities. In addition, they will need to address policy, regula­
tory, or other barriers to undertake needed measures, and to allow for recovery of 
prudently incurred costs for those utilities subject to rate regulation. In addition DHS 
is providing funding to state and local entities based on risk assessments of critical 
infrastructures. The National Asset Database (NADB) also is organized by criteria 
that may not fully capture the relative importance of energy infrastructure from a 
systems perspective (DHS, 2011).
Developing a Security Management Program requires a broad field of knowledge 
in asset loss prevention, physical security, occupational safety, and intangible asset 
protection functions. It requires a comprehensive knowledge of organizational assets 
and the development and implementation of physical measures, policies, procedures, 
and guidelines to protect those assets.
Security management requires critical thinking skills in developing mechanisms 
to protect organizational assets. The process of security management utilizes pro­
cesses of critical thinking providing a basis for a comprehensive security manage­
ment program. The dynamic nature of organizations and environments require that 
the security response also be dynamic.
EXERCISE
The energy sector is very complex in securing because it has relationships with 
multiple organizations throughout the energy sector. Explain the complex­
ity that is a result of interrelationships, and how losses in one area can affect 
other areas.

15 Post 9/11 Security
The new millennium brought a paradigm shift in the United States that completely 
changed the condition and understanding of the world and, most notably, our secu­
rity. The United States, with the cold war over, domestic terrorism at an all-time 
low, and a thriving economy, achieved a feeling of accomplishment and content. Al 
Qaeda and other terrorist groups had attacked U.S. personnel and property over­
seas; the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, soldiers in Somalia, and U.S. Embassy bombings in 
Tanzania and Kenya, again, was “over there,” and we felt safe at home in this coun­
try. On September 11, 2001, that changed. The attacks on the World Trade Center in 
New York, the Pentagon in Washington, D. C., and the hijacked Flight 93 crash in 
Pennsylvania signaled to the people in the United States that they were not safe. The 
security that we had long maintained was gone.
In the United States, many things happened after 9/11 regarding security. There 
was a new paradigm of Americans to the world and there was a public acceptance, 
if not demand, for increased security in the homeland. In the years following 9/11, 
the awareness of threats against our communities required us to be proactive in iden­
tifying threats. The USA Patriot Act of 2002 and the reorganization of government 
under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was an answer to that concern. 
Facility security, awareness programs, and intelligence gathering and sharing are 
common components of the effort to secure the homeland.*
Under the authority of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7), 
18 critical infrastructure sectors were established. These sectors are recognized as 
areas crucial for the security of the country, and each sector is managed by a Sector-
Specific Agency (SSA) that provides sector-level performance feedback to the DHS. 
In accordance with the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), each SSA 
is responsible for developing and implementing a Sector-Specific Plan (SSP) (DHS, 
2007a).
The U.S. national security critical sectors include:
	
1.	Food and Agriculture
	
2.	Banking and Finance
	
3.	Dams
	
4.	Chemical
	
5.	Communications
	
6.	Commercial facilities
	
7.	Critical Manufacturing
	
8.	Defense Industry Base
*	 Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (CII Act) and the implementing regulations at 6 CFR Part 29 
to critical infrastructure information that is not customarily in the public domain and is voluntarily 
submitted to the DHS.

	 14.	National Monuments and Icons
	 15.	Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste
	 16.	Postal and Shipping
	 17.	Transportation
	 18.	Water
The events of 9/11 brought the recognition that the United States did very little shar­
ing of information in regard to risks and threats, in either public or private organiza­
tions. The DHS recognized that each sector already has considerable data available to 
support a wide range of consequence, risk, and vulnerability assessments. Thus, part 
of the mission of DHS is to facilitate the sharing of data that are collected and used by 
owners, operators, trade associations, and a variety of industry organizations.
Likewise, DHS collects a wide variety of information, principally through the 
authorities of various federal agencies and at the state and local levels. DHS has 
established communication links between federal, state, and local government rep­
resentatives and industry. During times of increased security posture or emergency 
situations, the best information sources are the trusted relationships between govern­
ment and industry.
GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS
Information Sharing
In a joint effort, DHS has partnered with the Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) to 
develop Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN), an Internet-based commu­
nications system that enhances reporting and information sharing and allows industry 
participants to communicate securely with each other, with other industry sectors, 
and with government agencies. HSIN has agreements with both public and private 
sector leadership to share information via a restricted-access network, which is for 
key personnel to exchange information with the department during emergency situa­
tions. The site provides threat awareness and relevant security analyses and presenta­
tions (DHS, 2007b).
Focused Programs
DHS also facilitated the development of endurance and protecting programs with 
both public and private sector organizations in partnership with DHS and other 
appropriate federal agencies. Programs will draw from effective practice already 
in use by industry and from national laboratory efforts. Specific programs will be 
designed to account for the significant interdependencies between them (Presti, 
2012).

123
Post 9/11 Security
Establishing roles and responsibilities for implementation of new resiliency and 
protective measures and programs will present both a challenge and an opportunity. 
For example, in light of increasing cyber threats, DHS calls on both the public and 
the private sectors to work more closely together in arriving at a conclusion that 
would be both equitable and effective. Such an agreement would likely include real-
time information sharing and the development of best practices to protect critical 
infrastructure (Presti, 2012).
Shared Goals for Sector Security
DHS supports sector-specific goals for security. Each of the 18 sectors of the criti­
cal infrastructure is led by various groups, if not by a federal agency designated 
to coordinate goals to enhance security in that area. Goals often relate to response 
planning exercises, and also to facilitate loss plans that incorporate federal, state, 
and local law enforcement. DHS also supports goals to further enhance communi­
cation and coordination across the individual sectors as well as through all sectors. 
These include:
	
1.	Food and Agriculture, which is directed by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) 
Food and Drug Administration.
	
2.	Banking and Finance, which is directed by the Department of the Treasury.
	
3.	Dams, which are directed by the state Dam Safety Offices.
	
4.	Chemicals: Since the majority of Chemical Sector facilities are privately 
owned, they require direct relationship with the Department of Homeland 
Security.
	
5.	Communications: As most are of the private sector, owners and operators 
of the majority of communications infrastructure are the primary entities 
responsible for protecting sector infrastructure and assets.
	
6.	Commercial facilities: The majority of the facilities in this sector are pri­
vately owned and operated, with minimal interaction with the federal gov­
ernment and other regulatory entities.
	
7.	Critical Manufacturing: The majority of the organizations in this sector are 
privately owned and operated, with minimal interaction with the federal 
government and other regulatory entities.
	
8.	Defense Industry Base, which is directed by the Department of Defense.
	
9.	Emergency Services: They have dependencies and interdependencies 
with multiple critical infrastructure sectors and the National Response 
Framework’s Emergency Support Functions, which supply elements for 
both the operation and protection of Emergency Services’ assets.
	 10.	Energy, which is directed by the Department of Energy.
	 11.	Government Facilities is directed by the Federal Protective Service and the 
Department of Education for the education subsector.

124

	 12.	Healthcare and Public Health, which is directed by the Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS).
	 13.	Information Technology: The majority of information technology assets 
are privately owned and require direct relationship with the Department of 
Homeland Security.
	 14.	National Monuments and Icons, which are directed by the Department of the 
Interior.
	 15.	Nuclear Reactors, Materials, and Waste, which are directed by the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission.
	 16.	Postal and Shipping, which is directed by the Postal and Shipping 
Government Coordinating Council.
	 17.	Transportation, which is directed by the Transportation Security 
Administration.
	 18.	Water, which is directed by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Information Sharing and Communication
DHS has improved information sharing. While information sharing still may not 
be optimally utilized, a security manager can get a better understanding of the 
risk environments now than prior to 9/11. Both the public and private sector need 
credible, timely, actionable information to ensure that appropriate security invest­
ments, programs, and decisions are made to protect organizational assets. DHS has 
attempted to build a system of trust in both public and private sector security part­
ners to shared information.
DHS has provided many resources in assisting security managers to better deal 
with risk and subsequent loss. DHS has provided new methods or better explains 
existing methods that are acceptable to all stakeholders for collecting, protecting, 
and, as necessary, sharing sensitive data on the vulnerabilities of assets and the pro­
tective programs to address them. The private sector will be understandably cautious 
in providing information needed for vulnerability assessments and disclosing the 
results of assessments it has conducted, and may be equally cautious about providing 
specifics on ongoing and planned protective programs (DHS, 2007a).
CONCLUSION
The new millennium brought a paradigm shift in the United States affecting our own 
perceptions of security. The security manager is now in a position to have a better 
understanding of the risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and criticalities of assets than 
ever before. For security managers, there is nothing more practical than a methodi­
cal process of thinking. For managers, good thinking pays off while poor thinking 
causes problems, such as wasting resources and time. Critical thinking allows secu­
rity managers to envision their duties in a logical process while focusing on making 
decisions and solving problems. It has been the intent of this chapter to help the 
security manager realize resources available for his/her support in securing organi­
zational assets in the post-9/11 standard.

Post 9/11 Security
EXERCISE
This chapter discusses the various sectors of critical infrastructure in the post 
9/11 world. An underlying premise relates to infrastructure interdependen­
cies and risk considerations involving cross-sector analysis. How could the 
infrastructure linkages across sectors adversely affect the performance of 
other infrastructures in the event of loss to another sector.

EXAMPLE SECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT MEETING HIPAA 
GUIDELINES FOR A SMALL PHYSICIAN PRACTICE
A major security issue in the health care environment is the protection of informa­
tion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly 
known as HIPAA, required privacy rules that regulate the use and disclosure of 
Protected Health Information (PHI) held by “covered entities” generally, health care 
clearinghouses, employer sponsored health plans, health insurers, and medical ser­
vice providers that engage in certain transactions. By regulation, the Department of 
Health and Human Services extended the HIPAA privacy rule to independent con­
tractors of covered entities who fit within the definition of “business associates”.PHI 
is any information held by a covered entity which concerns health status, provision 
of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual. This is 
interpreted rather broadly and includes any part of an individual’s medical record or 
payment history. The follow is an example of a HIPAA compliance risk assessment.

SAMPLE HIPAA SECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT 
FOR A SMALL PHYSICIAN PRACTICE
Administrative, Physical, and Technical Safeguards
Breach Notification Rule
How to Use this Risk Assessment
The following sample risk assessment provides you with a series of sample ques­
tions to help you prioritize the development and implementation of your HIPAA 
Security policies and procedures. While this risk assessment is fairly lengthy, 
remember that the risk assessment is required and it is critical to your compliance 
with the Security Rule. These sample questions cover Administrative, Physical, and 
Technical Safeguards, and the Breach Notification Rule, and are only representative 
of the issues you should address when assessing different aspects of your practice. 

134
Appendix B
Keep your completed risk assessment documents in your HIPAA Security files and 
retain them in compliance with HIPAA document retention requirements.
HIPAA Security requires Covered Entities to protect against any reasonably antic­
ipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of electronic Protected Health 
Information (“ePHI”) and to implement security measures sufficient to reduce risks 
and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level. Assessing risks is only a 
first step. You must use the results of your risk assessment to develop and implement 
appropriate policies and procedures. 
Reproduction and use of this form in a physician’s office by physicians and their 
staff is permitted. Any other use, duplication, or distribution of this form requires 
the prior written approval of the American Physician Association. This form is edu­
cational only, does not constitute legal advice, and covers only federal, not state, law.
Sample Risk Analysis Directions
	
1.	Review each of the following sample questions and rank the level of risk on 
a scale of 1 to 6 (with 1 being the lowest level of risk and 6 being the highest 
level of risk).
	
a.	 “Risk for us” — 5 or 6 on your rating scale. You believe the situation 
or activity could put your practice at risk. For example, if your portable 
computer or smart phone contains scheduling or patient information, 
you have a high risk of exposing patient information if the ePHI it con­
tains is not encryped.
	
b.	 “Could be a risk” — 3 or 4 on your rating scale. For example, a poorly 
maintained inventory of electronic equipment would put you at risk of 
not being able to reconstruct your practice for an insurance claim in the 
event of a disaster.
	
c.	 “Not a risk” — 1 or 2 on your rating scale. For example, the risk of 
flooding is likely to be lower for a physician practice that is located in a 
low flood risk area than for a practice located in a high flood risk area.
	
2.	The following sample questions are designed to illustrate the kinds of ques­
tions that a physician practice should analyze in conducting its HIPAA 
Security Risk Analysis. Similar sample questions may appear in several 
sections because the sample questions correspond with various provisions 
of the Security Rule and are intended to allow you to think through your 
risks in different ways.
	
3.	Identify a Security Official to develop and implement security policies 
and procedures and to oversee and protect confidential health information. 
For example, mobile computers often score a 5-6 risk rating. The Security 
Official should confirm that ePHI stored on such hardware is encrypted, 
and all such hardware is accounted for through either a check-in/check-out 
process or by storage in a locked cabinet at the end of each day.

Security is a paradox. It is often viewed as intrusive, unwanted, a 
hassle, or something that limits personal, if not professional, freedoms. 
However, if we need security, we often feel as if we can never have 
enough. Security Management: A Critical Thinking Approach 
provides security professionals with the ability to critically examine 
their organizational environment and make it secure while creating an 
optimal relationship between obtrusion and necessity. It stresses the 
benefits of using a methodical critical thinking process in building a 
comprehensive safety management system.  
The book provides a mechanism that enables readers to think clearly  
and critically about the process of security management, emphasizing  
the ability to articulate the differing aspects of business and security 
management by reasoning through complex problems in the changing 
organizational landscape. The authors elucidate the core security  
management competencies of planning, organizing, staffing, and leading 
while providing a process to critically analyze those functions. They 
specifically address information security, cyber security, energy-
sector security, chemical security, and general security management 
utilizing a critical thinking framework.  
Going farther than other books available regarding security  
management, this volume not only provides fundamental concepts in 
security, but it also creates informed, critical, and creative security 
managers who communicate effectively in their environment. It helps 
create a practitioner who will completely examine the environment and 
make informed well-thought-out judgments to tailor a security program 
to fit a specific organization.
