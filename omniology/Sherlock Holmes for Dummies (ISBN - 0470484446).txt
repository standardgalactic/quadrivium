About the Authors
Steven Doyle has been a Sherlockian since the age of 14, when his parents 
gave him a copy of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for Christmas. Doyle 
is a member of the Baker Street Irregulars, as well as several other Sherlock 
Holmes societies, including the Illustrious Clients of Indianapolis.
Doyle has also had a long career in Sherlockian publishing. In 1987, Doyle 
founded and edited the quarterly journal The Sherlock Holmes Review. This 
critically acclaimed periodical ran for 10 years. In 1992 he cofounded Wessex 
Press, a high-quality small press specializing in Sherlock Holmes, Arthur 
Conan Doyle, and other topics of related interest. Wessex Press (and its 
imprint, Gasogene Books) is the premier Sherlockian publisher in the world. 
Finally, in 2008, Doyle assumed the role of publisher for The Baker Street 
Journal, the offi cial quarterly publication of the Baker Street Irregulars. Doyle 
has also authored countless essays and articles and edited or co-edited fi ve 
books: The Illustrious Clients Fourth Casebook, The Illustrious Clients Second 
Case-Notes, Holmes in the Heartland: The Illustrious Clients Fifth Casebook, 
Murderland, and G. K. Chesterton’s Sherlock Holmes. He lives in Zionsville, 
Indiana, a suburb of Indianapolis, with his wife, Pamela, and their three cats.
David A. Crowder has authored or coauthored more than 25 books, including 
the bestsellers Building a Web Site For Dummies and CliffsNotes Getting on 
the Internet. His two most recent books were both listed as essential for all 
library collections by the magazine Library Journal.
Dr. Crowder is a professor in the School of Languages at the University of 
Antioquia in Colombia. He is equally at home with high technology or with 
working his way through the backcountry on horseback or in a dugout canoe. 
When he is not writing, he spends his time with his wife, Angela, wandering 
through villages in the Andes or frolicking in the Caribbean surf. 


Dedication
To my parents, who gave their son a Christmas gift that never stopped giving, 
and to my wife, Pamela, who has always allowed Mr. Holmes to share our 
home.
— Steven Doyle

Introduction
O
dds are, if you’re sitting down to read this book, you believe that you 
don’t know much about Sherlock Holmes. But you’re wrong. You know 
he’s a detective, even the most famous detective of them all. You know he’s 
English. You likely know he has a friend named Watson. You probably even 
have a vague idea of what he looks like. But if that’s the extent of your 
knowledge, then you’re definitely ready to read on!
By any measure, Sherlock Holmes is the greatest character ever created in 
literature. Holmes’s popularity extends around the world. His influence on 
popular culture is immense (and shows up in the most surprising places). 
He has inspired a following of enthusiasts and fans that’s unprecedented for 
a fictional character from a work of literature. And the stories that comprise 
his adventures offer endless and fascinating new discoveries to his readers.
Over the past 100 years, enough articles, essays, periodicals, and books have 
been produced about the Great Detective to literally fill a library. Because of 
this, approaching the world of Sherlock Holmes can be daunting. But that’s 
what Sherlock Holmes For Dummies is for. Here you’ll find a general reference 
offering insight and entrance into the fascinating and exciting world of 
Sherlock Holmes.
However, this book isn’t an encyclopedia. (There are actual Sherlock Holmes 
encyclopedias for that.) As in any field of study, some topics covered here 
are simply informational, while others venture into subjects that have been 
debated for decades. Sherlock Holmes For Dummies definitely has opinions, 
but it’s never dogmatic. Half the fun of reading about the character is the 
variety of responses readers have to the stories and the evolving character of 
Holmes himself.
About This Book
When fans start to talk about their favorite detective, newcomers are often 
amazed at the number of topics that can fall under the umbrella of “Sherlock 
Holmes.” You might presume that, because these are mystery stories, most 
conversations would revolve around the tales themselves — sort of like 
what you’d find in a book club, where everyone reads the same volume and 
discusses it. But there’s so much more than that!

2
Sherlock Holmes For Dummies 
In this book, each chapter is devoted to a different area of interest, and 
subsections break down the chapter into more specific topics. The world of 
Sherlock Holmes covers an amazing array of subjects, including
 
✓ The origins of Sherlock Holmes and early detective fiction.
 
✓ The stories, including plots, characters, continuing themes, and 
common threads.
 
✓ The influence of Holmes on detective fiction, from his contemporaries to 
today.
 
✓ The life and work of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock 
Holmes.
 
✓ Holmes’s life outside the stories, including film and TV adaptations, 
pastiche and parody, and fan clubs.
Unlike many of the Sherlock Holmes reference books, handbooks, and 
encyclopedias published over the years, this book is organized so that you 
can dive in anywhere. No chapter is dependent upon any other, so if you see 
something that grabs your attention in the table of contents, just turn to it 
and go. Think of the book as a sort of “random access” publication.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use some conventions in the book that you may not be familiar with. These 
are mostly terms that new Sherlock Holmes readers may not know, such as:
 
✓ Sherlockian is the term for American devotees of Sherlock Holmes. 
British fans are called Holmesians.
 
✓ Sherlockiana means of the Sherlockian universe. So, for instance, a book 
can be called a volume of Sherlockiana.
 
✓ The canon is what Sherlockians call the original 60 Sherlock Holmes 
stories.
 
✓ The Great Detective is another term for Sherlock Holmes himself.
 
✓ The Good Doctor refers to Holmes’s friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.
Beyond the conventions specific to the Holmes stories, here are a few others 
it would help you to know:
 
✓ New words or terms appear in italics.
 
✓ Bold text makes it easy to spot keywords in bulleted lists.
 
✓ Monofont is used for Web addresses.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
This book has lots of great stuff throughout, but none of it needs to be 
read in order, and some of it can be skipped altogether! I’ve organized and 
designed it so that you can quickly identify what the subject is and easily 
understand what it’s saying. Beyond that, I’ve put in a lot of extra stuff that 
may be of interest. This material amplifies or reinforces the main topic of 
the chapter, but it isn’t vital to read it in order to get the major points. This 
optional material includes
 
✓ Sidebars: The shaded boxes that are scattered throughout the book 
contain extra material that I may touch on in the chapter but that isn’t 
crucial to your understanding of the subject.
 
✓ Anything with a Technical Stuff icon: Text next to one of these icons is 
interesting (I hope) supplementary material that, again, isn’t necessary 
to your understanding of the topic at hand.
Foolish Assumptions
If you’re getting ready to plunge into this book, it’s only fair to tell you that I 
made certain assumptions about you when writing it.
 
✓ You’ve heard of Sherlock Holmes. It’s a basic assumption (Holmes would 
call it “elementary”), but that’s where we start.
 
✓ You’re literate, curious, and intrigued by the phenomenon of Holmes’s 
popularity. You’ve had some vague sense that this character was special 
somehow, and now you’ve decided to look into it.
 
✓ You want to get up-to-speed on the subject quickly and easily. You want 
some good, insightful information and commentary, but you don’t want 
to spend a lifetime getting it.
 
✓ You like stuff like this — detective fiction, mysteries, genre movies. You 
think this stuff is cool!
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into five parts to divide the material into broad 
subjects and help you quickly locate a topic on Sherlock Holmes you may be 
interested in.

4
Sherlock Holmes For Dummies 
Part I: Elementary Beginnings 
and Background
This first part is the basic introduction to Sherlock Holmes — the plots of the 
stories and the fascinating history of their publication. In addition, you meet 
Arthur Conan Doyle, the man who created the world’s greatest detective, and 
you find out about Victorian London, the time and place that the Holmes 
stories take place.
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters!
Few stories in literature are populated with as many fascinating characters as 
the tales that make up the Sherlockian canon. In this part you get a detailed 
profile of Sherlock Holmes himself, and you’ll be amazed at the depth of the 
characterization. You also meet his friend, Dr. Watson, as well as other 
characters, including cops, bad guys, victims, and damsels in distress.
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures
In addition to rich characters, the Holmes stories are full of atmosphere and 
history, providing a window into the Victorian age. This part describes the 
“typical” Sherlock Holmes story and takes a detailed look at the most famous 
Holmes novel of them all, The Hound of the Baskervilles. I also examine 
common themes that occur throughout the 60 stories.
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street
The influence of Sherlock Holmes has, from the beginning, spread far beyond 
the original stories, and even beyond the printed page. This part looks at how 
Holmes has inspired thousands of imitators, first in parody and pastiche, 
and then later in new detectives created to resemble the Great Detective. It 
also examines Holmes on the stage and screen and looks at the character’s 
unprecedented fan following.

5
 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
What are the ten unsolved mysteries found in the canon? If I want to visit 
the actual places where the stories happened, where should I go? What are 
the ten most important books about Holmes that I should have on my shelf? 
What are the most memorable quotes of Sherlock Holmes? You can find the 
answers to these burning questions in this part!
I also include an appendix that lists the hundreds of active Sherlockian 
societies in the United States. If you want to find a fan club to join, here’s 
the list!
Icons Used in This Book
In the left margin throughout this book, I use icons to point to information 
that may be fun, interesting, memorable, or useful.
 
This icon points out important information that you want to remember.
 
This icon is next to material that helps reinforce information in the text but 
that isn’t necessary to know. It’s perfectly okay to skip the info that appears 
with this icon if you feel like it.
 
This icon alerts you to topics in the text that have parallels and relevance to 
similar subjects today, showing a continuity between events in the past and 
the present. Again, though not vital to a comprehension of the material, this 
information does add another level of understanding.
 
I use this icon primarily to give readers helpful tips. For instance, Chapter 17 
discusses Sherlockian places to visit, and the Tip icon offers pointers on when 
to go and what to see.

Sherlock Holmes For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized so that you can jump in wherever you want. This 
nonlinear format lets you start wherever your interests take you and proceed 
according to your whims. Do you need a basic introduction to Sherlock 
Holmes? Head to Chapter 1. Perhaps you’re more interested in film and 
television adaptations of the Great Detective. If so, you want to go to 
Chapter 14. For broad categories, turn to the table of contents. For more 
specific topics, check out the index.
If you’re not sure where to start, you can begin at the beginning with Part I. It 
gives you a snapshot of Sherlock Holmes, the background of his creation, and 
the stories.

Part I
Elementary 
Beginnings and 
Background

In this part . . .
T
his first part offers a basic introduction to Sherlock 
Holmes. I give an overview of the character of Holmes 
himself, the plots of the 60 Holmes stories, and the 
fascinating history of their publication. In addition, you 
meet Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the man who created the 
world’s greatest detective. This part also provides 
information about Victorian London — the time and 
place in which the Holmes stories take place.

Chapter 1
A Snapshot of Sherlock Holmes 
and the Stories That Made 
Him Famous
In This Chapter
▶ Debunking the erroneous popular image of Sherlock Holmes
▶ Tracing Holmes the creation and Doyle the creator
▶ Reviewing all the stories that comprise the Holmes canon
▶ Looking at Holmes’s enduring popularity
T
ry this experiment: Ask ten random people if they know who Sherlock 
Holmes is. Odds are they’ll say yes. Then ask what they know about him. 
Chances are they’ll say he’s a detective, he has a friend named Watson, he 
smokes a pipe, and he wears a funny hat. Some will even think he was real. 
What’s even more amazing is that if you were to try this experiment on every 
continent on the planet, you’d likely get the same results, demonstrating the 
grip that Sherlock Holmes has on the popular culture, even to this day.
Sherlock Holmes: Not Who 
You Think He Is
The popular image of Sherlock Holmes is largely made up of clichés that have 
become associated with the Great Detective over the years. Some of these do 
come from the actual character as written in the stories, while others have 
come from the countless adaptations on TV and in the movies. But if you’re 
approaching the Holmes stories for the first time, you may be surprised at 
the person you find. Sherlock Holmes is not who you think he is. (And neither 
is his friend, Dr. Watson!)

10
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
Pop culture portrayal versus 
portrayal in the stories
The common picture of Holmes is of a square-jawed, well-off, middle-aged, 
stuffy do-gooder who lives with an elderly, slightly befuddled roommate in 
a quaint London apartment. Both men while away their time until Scotland 
Yard appears with a particularly baffling case of murder that’s so mysterious 
it has the official police force stumped. (Well, this bit about the official police 
force being stumped does happen a lot in the stories!) Holmes comes off as 
a bit of a prig — stern, cold, scientific, and humorless. And always running 
around in an odd cape and funny hat.
Surprise! That is not Sherlock Holmes.
Who you meet in the stories is a young man (both Holmes and Watson are 
in their 20s when they meet) who’s poor enough to need a roommate and 
untidy and strange enough that he has trouble finding one. Sherlock is 
musical (he plays the violin and loves to attend concerts), occasionally 
funny, and, as becomes clear over time, a loyal friend.
In the fashion department, it’s top hat and frock coat for Sherlock, not a 
checked cape and hunting cap! Holmes has a dark side as well — impatience, 
vanity, depression, drug abuse, and an antisocial streak that keeps him 
from making many friends or forming romantic relationships. These are all 
personality traits that help define the real Sherlock Holmes.
 
In other words, you won’t find the cartoon image of Holmes in the stories. 
Instead, you meet a character with virtues and vices, strengths and weaknesses, 
and professionally, successes and failures. It’s a complex personality that has 
kept fans coming back to his adventures over and over for more than a century.
Why the confusion
As the famous poet T. S. Eliot once said when speaking of Holmes, it’s hard 
“not to slip into the myth of his existence.” And in fact, many people think 
Holmes was a real, living, historical person. So great is the impression he 
made, first on his readers and then on the popular culture, that thinking he 
actually lived is an understandable mistake. Of course, the myth of Sherlock’s 
reality has been helped along by a number of factors.

11
 Chapter 1: A Snapshot of Sherlock Holmes and the Stories That Made Him Famous 
His fans treated him as though he were real
From the moment Sherlock Holmes appeared in his first short story in 1891, 
fans began treating the detective as real. For instance, when readers learned 
that Holmes had died in “The Final Problem,” a public outcry of shock and 
grief ensued that equaled, and even exceeded, that which would occur at the 
death of real-life persons. Young businessmen in London even wore black 
armbands in mourning.
He’s been written about as if he were real
Since the early 1900s, fans and scholars have perpetuated the myth by 
writing about Holmes — his adventures, his methods, his world — as if he 
were real. The best example of this phenomenon is The Baker Street Journal, 
a quarterly publication by the Baker Street Irregulars, the oldest and most 
prestigious Sherlock Holmes society in the world. (For more on the Baker 
Street Irregulars and other Holmes organizations, go to Chapter 15.)
The Baker Street Journal was founded in 1946, and it’s devoted to publishing 
essays, commentary, and research papers that “play the game,” a term 
Sherlockians use for pretending that the stories are factual accounts of real 
persons and events. However, there have been quite literally tens of thousands 
of similar publications: books, articles, journals — the list is endless!
He still inspires the pros
 
To this day, Holmes continues to be held up as a role model in police 
departments around the world. He is cited in countless academic and 
professional articles and journals. College classes in forensic science, logic, 
chemistry, and scientific method, using Holmes as a model, are taught every 
day around the world.
For a fictional character, he gets a lot of kudos!
 
Imagine you’re on vacation in Switzerland and you come to a small village in 
the Alps, and there outside an inn is a life-sized statue of Sherlock Holmes! 
Nearby is a plaque that reads, “At this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished 
Professor Moriarty, on 4 May 1891.” The fact is that Holmes has more plaques, 
statues, and museums erected in his honor than most real-life historical figures!
 
✓ In the Criterion Bar in London’s Piccadilly Circus, a plaque commemorates 
the place where Dr. Watson met his friend Stamford, who went on to 
introduce Watson to Holmes.

12
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
 
✓ A chemical laboratory in London’s St. Bartholomew’s Hospital has a 
plaque identifying it as the location where Holmes and Watson first met.
 
✓ On London’s Baker Street, where Holmes lived, stands a museum 
dedicated to him. The museum not only re-creates his rooms down to 
the smallest detail but also has a blue plaque (see Figure 1-1).
 
 For decades, the actual 221b Baker Street address was occupied by 
Abbey House, a financial institution. Abbey House opened for business on 
this location in 1932 and immediately began to receive letters addressed 
to Sherlock Holmes. Holmes received so much mail that Abbey hired a 
secretary to answer it, and the letters continue to arrive to this day, with 
many people asking for Holmes’s help in solving a mystery!
 
 Blue plaques are historical markers used in many European countries 
that are installed in public places to commemorate a link between the 
location and a famous person or event. It’s believed that Holmes’s 
residence is the only fictional location to receive such an honor.
 
✓ You can find more statues of Sherlock Holmes than of his creator, 
Arthur Conan Doyle! Commemorative statues of the Great Detective 
can be found in London, England (see Figure 1-2); Edinburgh, Scotland; 
Meiringen, Switzerland; Moscow, Russia; and Karuizawa Town, Japan.

Given all these accolades and commemorative markers, what’s a person 
to think?
Though Sherlock Holmes may seem more real to people than many actual 
historical figures, he is, of course, a work of fiction. But as a work of fiction, 
his identity has eclipsed the author of the stories. More people know of the 
creation than the creator. For even more details on Holmes, head to Chapter 2.
Arthur Conan Doyle: Holmes’s Creator
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was born in 1859 in Edinburgh, Scotland. His father 
was Charles Altamont Doyle, an artist and painter. His mother was Mary 
Foley. As a boy, his main interests were sports and storytelling. He attended 
private schools and entered Edinburgh University medical school in 1876. 
He completed work on his doctor’s degree in 1885 and entered into private 
practice.

14
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
In his early career, in order to both pass the considerable time between 
infrequent patients and earn a little extra money, he began writing. He had 
a number of short stories published anonymously and wrote several novels 
of questionable quality. His main interests were in historical fiction and the 
supernatural. He didn’t set out to be a mystery or detective fiction writer. 
When Doyle wrote the first Holmes story, A Study in Scarlet, he had no idea he 
had created the defining character of his career.
 
In medical school, Doyle was influenced and inspired by his professors, 
especially Dr. Joseph Bell. Bell was a master of diagnosis using observation 
and deduction. It was from Bell that Doyle learned the Sherlock Holmes 
method. Doyle’s medical training and career were to be major sources of 
writing inspiration throughout his life, including the Holmes stories. For more 
on Doyle, the Holmes stories, and his other works, head to Chapter 3.
Sherlock Holmes’s debut
In 1887, Doyle got the idea to write a detective story and to model the main 
character after his old medical school professor, Dr. Bell. He gave it the lurid 
title of A Study in Scarlet. This was the first Holmes story, and despite being 
the best thing Doyle had written up to this time, very few publishers were 
interested. Finally, out of desperation, he accepted an offer from Ward, Lock 
& Co. to purchase the copyright for £25. The novel appeared complete in 
1887, in the seasonal publication Beeton’s Christmas Annual. It was a great 
story, but to be honest, it just sort of came and went without a lot of hoopla.
That might have been it for Sherlock, but then, in 1890, Holmes made his 
second appearance in the novel The Sign of the Four. This exciting tale 
was commissioned by the publisher of Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine, an 
American publication. (That’s right, Sherlock Holmes owes his continued 
existence to an American.) The Sign of the Four did a little better than A Study 
in Scarlet, but bigger and better things were right around the corner for both 
Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes.
Changing the way stories were serialized
The Victorian era was a golden age of magazine publishing, especially from 
the 1860s to the first decade of the 1900s. These reasonably priced monthly 
publications appealed to a wide range of readers and featured essays, stories, 
poetry, and serialized novels.
Many famous authors serialized novels over a number of months in a maga-
zine. For example, most of Charles Dickens’s best-known works appeared as 
serialized installments in magazines before they were published in book form. 
The problem with this was that if readers missed an issue, they were lost!

15
 Chapter 1: A Snapshot of Sherlock Holmes and the Stories That Made Him Famous 
 
In 1891, Doyle had an idea that revolutionized the way fiction was published in 
magazines. Instead of having a continuing story appear over numerous issues, 
Doyle decided to have a continuing character appear in a series of short stories. 
If you missed an issue, hey, no big deal — the character would be back the 
next month in a brand new, self-contained adventure. The character Doyle 
chose for this innovation was Sherlock Holmes, and he placed the stories in a 
new monthly called The Strand Magazine.
Holmes was an overnight sensation! Subscriptions to the magazine went 
through the roof. At the end of the first 12 stories, The Strand asked for more. 
Doyle in turn asked for more money and got it. And so it went until Holmes 
made Doyle a very rich man.
It turned out to be a long, profitable relationship. The first story appeared 
in The Strand in 1891, and the last one appeared in 1926. In England, new 
Holmes stories always made their first appearance in The Strand, and the 
detective and magazine are permanently linked.
The Canon of Sherlock Holmes
When Doyle wrote the very first Holmes story, he thought that was it. He 
never dreamed that he’d be writing stories about this character his entire 
life. The detective’s enormous popularity and the love/hate relationship that 
Doyle had with the character (Doyle felt that Sherlock’s popularity obscured 
his more important writing, which goes to show that an artist isn’t always 
the best judge of his own work!) ultimately compelled him to write 60 official 
adventures of Sherlock Holmes. These 60 stories are what fans and scholars 
call the canon.
So, what kind of stories are they?
If you’re unfamiliar with the Holmes adventures, you may think that every 
story finds Holmes and Watson solving a baffling case of murder. This is the 
case for many famous detectives who came in Sherlock’s wake. Let’s face 
it — murder sells.
 
However, this isn’t the case with Holmes. Oh, the canon has plenty of dead 
bodies — in fact, 263 dead bodies and 119 murders! But despite the body 
count, a large percentage of the tales are not murder mysteries. For example, 
only 4 of the 12 stories from The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes have anything 
to do with murder. In fact, many of the tales have, in the end, nothing criminal 
about them at all. They’re often more accurately described as detective stories 
than murder mysteries.

16
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
The Holmes stories can be classified into different categories. Following are 
some of these categories, and many tales actually fall into more than one:
 
✓ The “locked-room” mystery: This is a type of detective story in which 
a murder is committed under impossible conditions, usually in a place 
that the murderer couldn’t have entered or left. Although he isn’t given 
enough credit for it, Doyle was one of the earliest innovators of this 
classic subgenre of crime fiction. Examples of this type include “The 
Speckled Band,” “The Empty House,” and The Valley of Fear. (For more 
on locked-room mysteries, see the nearby sidebar.)
 
✓ Crime prevention: Often, Holmes’s participation in a case results in 
crime prevention instead of crime detection. Whether thwarting a bank 
robbery, preventing a kidnapping and forced marriage, or stopping the 
embezzlement of money, Holmes is up to the task. “The Red-Headed 
League,” “The Solitary Cyclist,” and “The Three Garridebs” are examples 
of this type of tale.
 
✓ Espionage: Several stories find Holmes working on behalf of the British 
government, often recovering stolen state secrets, and in one unique 
instance, actually going undercover as a spy. These tales include “The 
Naval Treaty,” “The Second Stain,” “The Bruce-Partington Plans,” and 
“His Last Bow.”
 
✓ Missing persons: In real life, private detectives are often hired to find 
missing persons. It was the same for Sherlock Holmes. In “A Case of 
Identity,” it was a missing bridegroom. In “The Noble Bachelor,” it was a 
missing bride! Other missing-persons cases include “The Man with the 
Twisted Lip” and “The Priory School.”
 
✓ Weird tales: Some of the stories just defy categorization! They aren’t 
exactly crime stories, and they aren’t really mysteries. Instead, although 
they have elements of adventures and romance, they’re really just weird 
tales. “The Yellow Face,” “The Crooked Man,” and “The Veiled Lodger” 
are clearly in the realm of weird tales.
The long and the short of it
The Sherlock Holmes canon contains 4 novels and 56 short stories. Both 
forms have their strengths and weaknesses, but Doyle generally excelled at 
the short story format. He once explained that it took as much effort to 
concoct the plot of a short story as it did a novel, and it’s clearly easier 
for him to sustain a tale over fewer pages. Three of the four novels have a 
lengthy flashback that explains the back story and motivation of the adventure 
at hand. Of course, there’s an exception to every rule! The greatest of all 
Holmes adventures, The Hound of the Baskervilles, is a novel.

17
 Chapter 1: A Snapshot of Sherlock Holmes and the Stories That Made Him Famous 
A Study in Scarlet
First published in 1887 by Ward, Lock & Co. in Beeton’s Christmas Annual (see 
Figure 1-3), this novel is the first Sherlock Holmes story. In this landmark 
adventure, Dr. John H. Watson is looking for a roommate, and when he’s 
introduced to Sherlock Holmes, their immortal partnership begins. As they 
take up residence together, Watson begins to wonder about the weirdo he 
has moved in with. What’s with the mysterious chemical experiments? The 
endless parade of unusual visitors? What is his line of work? The mystery 
involves a case of revenge, murder, and obsession that dates back 30 years to 
the Mormons in Salt Lake City, Utah. Not a bad start!
The Sign of (the) Four
On August 30, 1889, Joseph M. Stoddart, the managing editor of the American 
publication Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine, held a remarkable dinner party. 
The guests included Oscar Wilde and Arthur Conan Doyle, two British 
authors whom Stoddart greatly admired and wanted to publish in his 
magazine. Wilde went on to contribute The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Doyle 
wrote The Sign of the Four, the second Sherlock Holmes novel.
Masters of the locked-room tale
The “locked-room” mystery is perhaps the 
best-known subgenre of crime fiction. Arthur 
Conan Doyle wasn’t the first author to write this 
style of story, nor was he the last. Some of his 
fellow locked-room authors include
 ✓ Edgar Allan Poe: Poe’s tale “The Murders 
in the Rue Morgue” (1841) is a classic of 
the locked-room style. When a mother 
and daughter are brutally murdered, 
investigators discover that the room is 
locked from the inside and is too high up 
for window access. So who — or what — 
could have come down the chimney?
 ✓ Dorothy Sayers: Mystery writer (and 
Holmesian) Dorothy Sayers introduced a 
locked-room-style mystery into her Lord 
Peter Wimsey series in Have His Carcase 
(1932). When a man is found with his throat 
cut on a rock, which is located in the 
middle of a smooth stretch of sandy beach, 
authorities are baffled!
 ✓ John Dickson Carr: Carr was one of the 
masters of the locked-room story. For 
instance, in “The Case of the Constant 
Suicides” (1941), a dead man is found in a 
Scottish castle at the top of the tower. All 
the evidence indicates that he was alone 
when he died and points away from suicide.
 ✓ Ellery Queen: The great Ellery Queen wrote 
a fair number of locked-room mysteries, 
including The King is Dead (1951). A 
millionaire locked in a room far away from 
his brother is found shot dead. But there’s 
no gun in the room!

In Doyle’s sophomore effort, readers discover Holmes’s drug abuse (“What is 
it today?” asks Watson in disgust. “Morphine, or cocaine?”), meet the Baker 
Street Irregulars (the ragtag group of street urchins Holmes uses as his 
eyes and ears around London), and head off on a treasure hunt featuring 
bloodhounds, savage natives, blowguns, and a boat chase on the Thames. 
Great stuff!
 
The Sign of the Four first appeared in the February 1890 edition of Lippincott’s 
Monthly Magazine. In America it was called The Sign of the Four, but in Britain 
the title was shortened to The Sign of Four. However you title it, it’s a classic.
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
The Adventures collects the first 12 Sherlock Holmes short stories into one 
volume. These tales were originally published serially in The Strand Magazine 
from July 1891 to June 1892. The Adventures was published in book form in 
1892.
The 12 stories in this collection are
 
✓ “A Scandal in Bohemia”: Hired to thwart a public scandal involving the 
king of Bohemia, Holmes encounters the beautiful Irene Adler, who, as 
he puts it, “has a face that a man might die for.”

 Chapter 1: A Snapshot of Sherlock Holmes and the Stories That Made Him Famous 
 
✓ “The Red-Headed League”: This story begins with high comedy but 
ends with a dangerous vigil in a darkened bank vault full of French gold.
 
✓ “A Case of Identity”: Holmes uncovers a heartless deception in a case 
he solves without ever leaving his rooms.
 
✓ “The Boscombe Valley Mystery”: It’s murder! Here Holmes uses his 
powerful forensic crime-scene investigation skills (see Figure 1-4).
 
✓ “The Five Orange Pips”: Not a shining moment for Sherlock as he 
underestimates the power and reach of the Ku Klux Klan.
 
✓ “The Man with the Twisted Lip”: Holmes uses one of his greatest tools — 
his pipe — to work out the solution to this case. It’s a real “three pipe 
problem”!
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle”: The only Christmas-time tale 
in the canon is a tour de force of detection as Holmes traces the journey 
of a stolen jewel from a hotel room to the crop of a Christmas goose.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Speckled Band”: One of the spookiest and 
best-known tales in the canon. What killed Julia Stoner as she lay in bed 
behind her locked bedroom door? What was the mysterious whistle in 
the night? And what did she mean by, “It was the band! The speckled 
band”? This story is one of the canon’s best locked-room mysteries!

Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Engineer’s Thumb”: One of the grisliest Holmes 
stories relates Victor Hatherley’s unfortunate encounter with a meat 
cleaver.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor”: Holmes investigates the case 
of a jilted groom and a missing bride. But is there a crime?
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet”: The theft of a priceless piece 
of jewelry allows Holmes to once again display his amazing crime-scene 
investigation skills.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Copper Beeches”: Definitely a weird tale. Why 
must the new governess obey her employer’s strange rules, like wearing 
a blue dress and cutting her hair? And why must she never go into a 
certain wing of the house?
The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes
This is the second collection of Holmes short stories, originally published in 
1894 in The Strand Magazine.
 
✓ “Silver Blaze”: An investigation into a stolen racehorse and a murdered 
trainer leads to a surprising suspect!
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Cardboard Box”: This story of marital infidelity 
and murder was considered too racy for the American edition of The 
Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes and didn’t appear in book form in America 
until His Last Bow.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Yellow Face”: Another strange tale with little 
detection and no crime. And yet, its surprising conclusion pays off.
 
✓ “The Stockbroker’s Clerk”: Holmes cracks a case of early identity theft 
and narrowly prevents a serious crime.
 
✓ “The Gloria Scott”: The normally secretive Sherlock suddenly opens up 
and tells Watson about his very first case, an adventure that took place 
during college.
 
✓ “The Musgrave Ritual”: Holmes must have been in a chatty mood as he 
follows “The Gloria Scott” with yet another tale of college-age mystery 
solving.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Reigate Squire”: While recovering from a 
nervous breakdown, Holmes investigates a strange burglary that led to 
murder.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Crooked Man”: The mysterious death of Col. 
Barclay unearths a terrible, heartbreaking secret.
 
✓ “The Resident Patient”: Holmes looks into the hanging death of a 
wealthy but paranoid man in another crime-scene investigation tour de 
force.

21
 Chapter 1: A Snapshot of Sherlock Holmes and the Stories That Made Him Famous 
 
✓ “The Greek Interpreter”: This thrilling, horrifying tale of kidnapping 
and murder introduces readers to Holmes’s brother, Mycroft.
 
✓ “The Naval Treaty”: A stolen military treaty shakes the British 
government and afflicts another man with “brain fever.” It also offers a 
surprising glimpse of the religious views of the Great Detective.
 
✓ “The Final Problem”: This tale, which introduces Professor James 
Moriarty, the “Napoleon of crime,” has a shocking conclusion that few 
readers can forget. “It is with a heavy heart” that Watson relates the 
death of Sherlock Holmes.
The Hound of the Baskervilles
 
This supposedly posthumous story is the greatest of all Sherlock Holmes 
adventures. The Hound of the Baskervilles is a Gothic masterpiece of suspense, 
atmosphere, and horror. Originally serialized in The Strand Magazine, it 
appeared in book form in 1902. It tells the tale of the Baskervilles, who live on 
the moor and are haunted by a spectral hound, “the hound from hell.” When 
the current resident of Baskerville Hall dies under mysterious circumstances, 
Watson is sent to protect the new heir from harm. With mysterious neighbors, 
an escaped convict on the loose, and a glowing hellhound, The Hound of the 
Baskervilles is consistently named by fans as their favorite Holmes story of all.
The Return of Sherlock Holmes
When Arthur Conan Doyle killed Sherlock Holmes at the end of “The Final 
Problem,” he immediately felt intense pressure to bring him back to life. He 
held out for ten years, but he finally gave in. The Return of Sherlock Holmes 
is the collected short-story adventures published after the Great Detective’s 
return from the dead. It appeared in 1905.
The stories in this volume include
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Empty House”: Holmes has been dead for three 
years when a lonely Watson becomes interested in the mysterious death 
of the young Ronald Adair. But then this classic locked-room mystery 
becomes secondary to a shocking revelation: Sherlock Holmes lives!
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Norwood Builder”: Unrequited love and revenge 
drive this story of a retired builder who is murdered immediately upon 
making out his will.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Dancing Men”: This story has it all: mysterious 
codes, gangsters, a love triangle, murder, and one of Holmes’s greatest 
crime-scene investigations.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist”: Violet Smith is being followed. 
Having no one to turn to, she appeals to Holmes for advice. This creepy 
story of a young woman being stalked by bicycle on a lonely country 
lane is a classic.

22
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Priory School”: Kidnapping, murder, and 
high society result in a case that ends with Holmes becoming a very 
rich man.
 
✓ “The Adventure of Black Peter”: The solution to one of the grisliest 
murders in the canon (the victim is pinned to the wall with a harpoon!) 
hinges on the location of a blood drop.
 
✓ “The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton”: In an effort to save 
the reputation of an innocent woman, Sherlock resorts to housebreaking 
as he battles the “king of the blackmailers.” Prepare yourself for the 
shocking climax!
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Six Napoleons”: Why is someone smashing 
statues of Napoleon all around London? It looks like madness, but the 
Great Detective sees something else.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Three Students”: While doing research in one 
of England’s “great university towns,” Holmes is asked to look into an 
academic cheating scandal. Which of the three students is guilty?
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez”: When a bedridden scholar’s 
personal assistant is murdered, Holmes solves the case by smoking 
cigarettes and looking into the killer’s dropped eyeglasses.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter”: This missing-persons 
case begins by looking like foul play, but it ends in brokenhearted tragedy.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Abbey Grange”: A husband is dead and his wife 
is tied to a chair. It’s a clear case of home invasion. Or is it?
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Second Stain”: This is one of the greatest cases 
in Sherlock’s career! It has everything — blackmail, stolen state secrets, 
a jealous mistress, and murder. It also has one of the strangest crime-scene 
clues of all time!
The Valley of Fear
The Valley of Fear is the fourth and final Sherlock Holmes novel. Originally 
serialized in The Strand Magazine, it was published in book form in 1915. As 
in A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of the Four, the story is divided into two 
parts. The first part is a classic locked-room mystery. How did someone get 
into John Douglas’s room and blow his head off with a sawed-off shotgun, 
especially when the drawbridge across his moat was up?
The second half reveals the back story, which is based on the real-life 
criminal activities of the Molly Maguires and their downfall at the hands of 
a Pinkerton Agency detective in Pennsylvania. And, oh yeah . . . it also has 
Professor Moriarty.

 Chapter 1: A Snapshot of Sherlock Holmes and the Stories That Made Him Famous 
His Last Bow
Originally published in 1917 during World War I, His Last Bow collects into 
one volume the stories published between 1908 and 1913, plus the title story, 
“His Last Bow,” which was published in 1917. The American edition of the 
book had an additional tale, “The Adventure of the Cardboard Box,” which 
had been suppressed years before.
The seven stories are
 
✓ “The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge”: When Mr. John Scott Eccles 
accepts an invitation from his new friend to visit Wisteria Lodge, little 
does he know what he’s getting himself into. By morning, his host is 
dead, and he’s a wanted man.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Red Circle”: A murderous secret society and a 
young, persecuted couple are at the heart of this story. When a young 
woman spurns the advances of a Mafia chief, her husband takes 
extraordinary action to protect her.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans”: How did the body get 
on the underground tracks, and how did the stolen submarine plans get 
in his pocket? Missing state secrets, murder, espionage, and another 
stint of Holmesian housebreaking can be found in this adventure.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Dying Detective”: Sherlock Holmes is dying! 
Having contracted a deadly infectious disease while working on a 
case, the Great Detective is feverish and delirious. He sends Watson to 
summon the only man in London who can cure him. But will he come?
 
✓ “The Disappearance of Lady Francis Carfax”: “One of the most 
dangerous classes in the world,” says Holmes, “is the drifting and 
friendless woman. She is the inevitable inciter of crime in others.” So it 
is with Lady Francis Carfax.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Devil’s Foot”: When an entire family is driven 
insane, the village priest is sure it’s the work of the devil. Sherlock 
Holmes isn’t so sure.
 
✓ “His Last Bow”: Set in 1914 on the eve of World War I, this case of 
espionage and spying is, chronologically, the very last adventure that 
Holmes and Watson work on together. (Stories that Doyle wrote after 
“His Last Bow” were set in a time period before it.)
The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes
The last volume of Sherlock Holmes adventures was published in June 1927. 
It collects the final 12 short stories, which Arthur Conan Doyle sporadically 
wrote over the last decade of his life. By the time Case-Book was published, 

24
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
Holmes had been appearing for 40 years! The struggle Doyle had in sustaining 
the stories is evident; some of these adventures are a bit strained. But others 
are as good as anything he ever wrote.
The final adventures of Sherlock Holmes are
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone”: This story was adapted from 
a stage play by Doyle called The Crown Diamond. Holmes uses several 
tricks, including a wax dummy and a record player, to extract a confession 
and recover a stolen jewel. It’s definitely the weakest story in the canon.
 
✓ “The Problem of Thor Bridge”: Holmes makes a fine recovery in one of 
the best stories in the canon. It’s another locked-room mystery, except 
this time the room is a bridge over a pond. There’s a body with a bullet 
in the brain, but is it murder? Or suicide? If so, where’s the weapon?
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Creeping Man”: This story has a dash of science 
fiction in it. When an aging professor begins treating himself with a 
mysterious serum, he undergoes a startling transformation!
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire”: When Bob Ferguson finds his 
mysterious South American wife sucking blood from the neck of their 
infant son, he fears he’s married to one of the undead.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Three Garridebs”: What begins as an odd story 
of misdirection ends with terror for Holmes when Watson is shot.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Illustrious Client”: When the daughter of a 
member of high society falls under the spell of the “Austrian murderer” 
Baron Gruner, an “illustrious client” hires Holmes to prevent the 
marriage. This dark tale takes Holmes and Watson into the underbelly 
of London life in a story of violence, sexual abuse, and revenge.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Three Gables”: Mrs. Maberley receives an 
unusual offer to purchase her house (the buyer wants everything). Thus 
begins another adventure of Sherlock Holmes.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier”: James Dodd wasn’t worried 
when he didn’t hear from his friend Godfrey for over six months. But 
when he’s told that Godfrey is taking a cruise around the world, he 
doesn’t buy it, especially when he sees Godfrey looking in his window at 
night! This is the first of two stories told by Holmes instead of Watson.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Lion’s Mane”: In this, the second story told by 
Holmes, he has retired to a cottage on the Sussex Downs near the coast. 
One morning a neighbor staggers up from the beach and dies, crying 
out, “The lion’s mane!” Holmes finds that the man’s back is covered with 
what looks like whip marks. What killed the man, and what do his dying 
words mean?

25
 Chapter 1: A Snapshot of Sherlock Holmes and the Stories That Made Him Famous 
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Retired Colourman”: “Burglary has always been an 
alternative profession, had I cared to adopt it,” remarks Sherlock Holmes. 
It’s a skill he turns to in solving a case of a missing wife and her lover.
 
✓ “The Adventure of the Veiled Lodger”: When summoned by a landlady 
to check out a mysterious tenant who never shows her face, Holmes 
finds himself in the role of confessor instead of detective. “The Veiled 
Lodger” is one of the most tragic tales in the canon.
 
✓ “The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place”: Sir Robert Norberton 
has everything riding on his horse winning a race. Winning will save 
him from financial ruin. But why is he visiting an ancient family crypt 
at night? And how do you explain the human bone in the furnace? 
Sherlock’s love of dogs holds the key to solving this case.
Three Centuries and Counting
 
Sherlock Holmes debuted in 1887. The staying power of this eccentric, moody, 
drug-abusing Victorian bachelor is amazing. Holmes’s popularity now spans 
three centuries. Other famous literary detectives, and even pop culture icons, 
have come and gone, but Holmes is still going strong.
His esteem has never really waned. At times, of course, his light has seemed 
to shine brighter than it normally does, but from the moment Holmes 
debuted in The Strand Magazine to this day, his popularity has manifested 
itself in an astonishing number of ways.
Arthur Conan Doyle’s favorite stories
In 1927, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle made a list for 
The Strand Magazine of what he believed were 
the best Sherlock Holmes short stories.
 ✓ “The Adventure of the Speckled Band”
 ✓ “The Red-Headed League”
 ✓ “The Adventure of the Dancing Men”
 ✓ “The Adventure of the Final Problem”
 ✓ “A Scandal in Bohemia”
 ✓ “The Adventure of the Empty House”
 ✓ “The Five Orange Pips”
 ✓ “The Adventure of the Second Stain”
 ✓ “The Adventure of the Devil’s Foot”
 ✓ “The Adventure of the Priory School”

Foreign translations
Sherlock Holmes is well-known worldwide, so it comes as no surprise that the 
stories have been translated into over 80 languages. These include Arabic, 
Chinese, Czechoslovakian, Egyptian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, 
Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, Sinhalese, Spanish, 
Swedish, and Urdu, as well as more than 60 others. In addition to spoken-
language translations, the canon has also been rendered in Braille, Morse 
code, and Pitman shorthand!
Dramatic adaptations
Almost as soon as the stories appeared in The Strand Magazine, dramatic 
portrayals of the Great Detective began to emerge. Today, Sherlock Holmes is 
one of the most dramatized characters in history. His dramatic exploits have 
appeared in every entertainment medium, be it stage, screen, TV, radio, and 
now even video games!
 
✓ Stage adaptations: The earliest dramatic adaptations of Holmes 
appeared on the stage. The first known play was appropriately titled 
Sherlock Holmes and was written by an enterprising man named Charles 
Rogers. It was 1893, and Arthur Conan Doyle had just killed Sherlock 
Holmes. Rogers realized that a mourning public would love to see its 
hero alive on the stage, and he dashed off his melodrama — the first of 
literally hundreds.
 
✓ Sherlock on the silver screen: Holmes was also there at the dawn of 
the motion picture era. In 1900, the American Mutoscope & Biograph 
Company produced the very first Sherlock Holmes film. Sherlock Holmes 
Baffled had a running time of 30 seconds and was shown in Mutoscope 
machines in arcades. Since then, there have been over 260 motion pictures 
featuring Holmes.
 
✓ Sherlock on TV: In addition to a stellar career on the big screen, Holmes 
was the first fictional character adapted for TV. In 1937, the American 
Radio Relay League broadcast an adaptation of “The Three Garridebs” 
from New York City’s Radio City Music Hall. Since then, Holmes has 
been a TV staple, appearing in both long-running series and made-for-TV 
movies in Canada, Czechoslovakia, England, Poland, Russia, the United 
States, and other countries around the world.
 
✓ Radio: From the golden age of radio up through the modern era, Holmes 
has appeared in over 700 radio adaptations.

 Chapter 1: A Snapshot of Sherlock Holmes and the Stories That Made Him Famous 
Sherlock Holmes societies
Perhaps the most obvious sign of the amazing popularity of Sherlock Holmes 
is the phenomenon of clubs and literary societies devoted to his adventures. 
To date there are over 260 Sherlock Holmes societies around the world, 
including ones in such countries as Australia, Denmark, France, Iraq, Israel, 
Italy, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland!
Continuing adventures
So what happens when you finish the final Holmes story? Well, many people 
read them again! But others turn to the groaning bookshelves of Sherlockian 
pastiche (works that deliberately imitate the style of Doyle’s Holmes stories) 
and parody (works that poke fun at the character and the stories) that make 
up the continuing adventures of Sherlock Holmes. (And some even go on and 
write their own. . . .)
 
No other character in history has appeared in as many stories written by 
other authors as has Sherlock Holmes. This phenomenon started early, with 
the first known parody appearing in 1893. What began as a trickle is now a 
tidal wave, as new stories appear every year, literally by the hundreds.
Whether in the form of pastiche or parody, or maybe somewhere in between, 
devoted followers often need a fix of extra-canonical Sherlock!

The Great Detective and 
His Life in Crime
In This Chapter
▶ Comparing Holmes with other literary detectives
▶ Examining Sherlock’s investigative methods and tools
▶ Looking at Holmes’s quirks and vices
▶ Listing some important cases
M
any readers think that Sherlock Holmes was the first detective in 
fiction. After all, his image is legendary — the curved pipe, the 
deerstalker hat. He has to be the first, right? Well, no, not exactly.
When Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes, he had numerous 
sources of inspiration, both in literature and in real life. This chapter looks 
at where Holmes came from, how Holmes improved the embryonic genre of 
detective fiction, and just what kind of detective Holmes actually was.
Finding Sherlock’s Origins
From the beginning, readers have believed that Sherlock Holmes and his 
biographer, Dr. John H. Watson, were actual living, historical persons, and 
that the stories Holmes appears in were actual historical events. This 
phenomenon dates back almost to the creation of the character in 1887. 
From the time Doyle created Holmes when he was 26 right on up to his death 
in 1930, Doyle felt he always stood in the shadow of the Great Detective.

30
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
When Doyle began his undistinguished medical career in 1881, he had a lot of 
time on his hands. He was new in town, he had very little medical experience, 
and he had no patients. In the early days, it was all he could do to pay the 
gas bill or put food on the table. To make a little extra money and to fill those 
long hours without any patients, he turned to writing. He wrote ghost stories 
and a couple of bad novels, and he wrote a lot of letters to his mother. As a 
doctor, he eventually began to get patients and make a living, and his career 
ended up being moderately successful. But he still had plenty of time — and 
need — to supplement his income by writing.
The more Doyle wrote, the better he got, and he soon found he was able to 
supplement his medical income by placing stories in popular magazines of 
the day. Eventually, he began resenting the appearance of patients because 
they interrupted his creative train of thought. And then one day he decided 
to write a detective story.
Literary inspirations for Holmes
For inspiration, Doyle turned to his predecessors in the field. They were 
Edgar Allan Poe, Émile Gaboriau, and Wilkie Collins. It’s fair to say that Doyle 
borrowed a little from all three of these writers.
 
Traces of nearly everything Doyle ever read usually found its way into the 
Holmes stories — newspaper stories, magazine stories, even advertisements — 
so to find obvious elements of previous detective writers in his writing is no 
surprise.
Edgar Allan Poe
Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849) was a great American writer, poet, and critic 
best known for his Gothic tales of mystery and horror. Both his poetry and 
short stories routinely betray an obsession with death, madness, and guilt 
(“The Raven,” for example), as well as dismemberment and decomposition 
(“The Tell-Tale Heart”). He was a creepy guy! He’s also credited with inventing 
the detective fiction genre.
Doyle was particularly fond of Poe, calling him “the supreme original short 
story writer of all time” — an opinion that’s hard to challenge.
Doyle got numerous bits of inspiration from Poe’s stories:
 
✓ “Murder in the Rue Morgue” (1841): This story was an obvious 
inspiration for the method of Col. Sholto’s death in The Sign of the Four. 
In “Rue Morgue,” an inaccessible room is reached by a murderous 
orangutan. In The Sign of the Four, an inaccessible room is reached by a 
murderous pygmy.

31
 Chapter 2: The Great Detective and His Life in Crime 
 
✓ “The Gold Bug” (1843): This story features cryptograms and encoded 
writing. It’s an obvious inspiration for the famous Dancing Men code in 
“The Dancing Men.”
 
✓ “The Purloined Letter” (1845): This story’s theme of hiding something — 
in this case a letter — in plain site is echoed in “A Scandal in Bohemia,” 
where instead of a letter, the desired object is an incriminating photograph.
Émile Gaboriau
Émile Gaboriau (1832–1873) was a French novelist and early author of 
detective fiction. His best-known books featured an amateur detective named 
Monsieur Lecoq, who was based on a real-life criminal turned police chief, 
Eugène François Vidocq.
From Gaboriau, Doyle got scientific and methodical crime scene investigation 
(the TV show CSI owes a lot to Émile Gaboriau!), the use of disguises, and the 
storytelling device of the flashback, which Doyle employs in three of the four 
Sherlock Holmes novels.
Wilkie Collins
Wilkie Collins (1824–1889) was a very popular English novelist and short 
story writer. His best-known novels are the mysterious The Woman in White 
and the detective story The Moonstone.
From Wilkie Collins came the image of Sherlock Holmes. Below is a description 
of Sergeant Cuff from Collins’s masterpiece The Moonstone:
. . . so lean that he looked as if he had not got an ounce of flesh on his 
bones in any part of him. He was dressed all in decent black, with a white 
cravat round his neck. His face was sharp as a hatchet, and the skin of it 
was yellow and dry and withered as an autumn leaf. His eyes, of a steely 
light grey, had a very disconcerting trick, when they encountered your 
eyes, of looking as if they expected something more from you than you 
yourself were aware.
Compare Collins’s description of Cuff with one of Doyle’s numerous descriptions 
of Holmes:
In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he 
seemed to be much taller. His grey eyes were sharp and piercing, save 
during those intervals of black reaction to which I have alluded; and his 
thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and 
decision.

32
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
The model for Holmes
Doyle had other literary inspirations and influences, but when he was 
directly asked, “Who was your model for Sherlock Holmes?” he didn’t 
mention another writer or a story. Instead, he answered with a real-life 
person: “Dr. Joseph Bell,” shown in Figure 2-1.
Dr. Joseph Bell was one of Doyle’s former medical professors at Edinburgh 
University, where Doyle studied to be a doctor. Bell was (and actually, 
still is) legendary for specializing in accurate diagnoses based on the very 
Sherlockian method of observation and deduction.
Doyle wrote of Bell: “He would sit in his receiving room with a face like a Red 
Indian, and diagnose the people as they came in, before they even opened 
their mouths. He would tell them details of their past life; and hardly would 
he ever make a mistake.”
And again, in his autobiography, Doyle recounted the merging of his literary 
influences with his old medical school teacher:
I felt now that I was capable of something fresher and crisper and more 
workmanlike than many of the detective stories that had been written up 
to that time. Gaboriau had rather attracted me by the neat dovetailing 
of his plots, and Poe’s masterful detective, M. Dupin, had from boyhood 
been one of my heroes. But could I bring an addition of my own? I 
A few other literary inspirations for Sherlock Holmes
You can find elements of the following works in 
various Sherlock Holmes adventures:
 ✓ Confessions of an English Opium-Eater 
(1821): Doyle got the idea for a more 
bohemian Sherlock Holmes and his notorious 
drug addiction from Thomas de Quincey’s 
book.
 ✓ The New Arabian Knights (1882): Robert 
Louis Stevenson’s book influenced the 
surreal, fantastical atmosphere of The Sign 
of the Four, along with its Indian overtones.
 ✓ The Dynamiters (1885): The Mormon 
flashback sequence in A Study in Scarlet 
bears more than a passing resemblance to 
Stevenson’s novel.
 ✓ The Mystery of the Hansom Cab (1886): This 
novel by Fergus Hume, published a year 
before A Study in Scarlet, is a model of the 
urban, late-Victorian crime novel.

33
 Chapter 2: The Great Detective and His Life in Crime 
thought of my old teacher Joe Bell, of his eagle face, of his curious ways, 
of his eerie trick of spotting details. If he were a detective he would surely 
reduce this fascinating business to something nearer an exact science. I 
would try it if I could get this effect. It was surely possible in real life, so 
why should I not make it plausible in fiction?
Doyle wrote a letter to Bell in 1892, after Sherlock Holmes had exploded on 
the scene:
It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes, and though in the 
stories I have the advantage of being able to place [the detective] in all 
sorts of dramatic positions, I do not think that his analytical work is in 
the least an exaggeration of some effects which I have seen you produce 
in the out-patient ward.
Bell wrote back and told Doyle that “you are yourself Sherlock Holmes and 
well you know it.”

Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
A new kind of detective
As I explain in the preceding sections, Sherlock Holmes wasn’t the first 
detective in literature, but he was the first of a new style of detective. Early 
in Doyle’s first published Holmes story, the novel A Study in Scarlet, Holmes 
uses the term “consulting detective” (and in later stories, “private consulting 
detective”) to describe what he does.
The “world’s only private consulting detective”
Victorian London at the time of Sherlock Holmes was full of detectives, and 
these real-life investigators fell into the same categories as the fictional ones. 
As Holmes tells Watson in A Study in Scarlet, “here in London we have lots 
of government detectives [police officers] and lots of private ones.” But as a 
consulting detective, Holmes is a sort of “court of last appeal.” So when one 
of these professional investigators is stuck and can’t solve whatever mystery 
he’s working on, the stumped investigator comes to Holmes and, for a fee, 
Holmes will “put [him] on the right scent.”
 
Though the character of Sherlock Holmes shares traits with his predecessors, 
his professionalism and investigative methods are crucial distinctions. For 
instance, Poe’s detective Dupin isn’t a professional detective but merely a 
gifted amateur who investigates crime for personal amusement. Gaboriau’s 
Monsieur Lecoq is a police officer, as is Collins’s Sergeant Cuff. But Sherlock 
Holmes is clearly different.
 
Some crime fiction authors have debated whether Poe’s detective Dupin is a 
professional or an amateur. It’s true that Dupin receives a fee at the end of his 
stories, but he’s clearly not in the same class as Holmes. For instance, in “The 
Murders in the Rue Morgue,” Dupin takes up the case by saying, “As for these 
murders, let us enter into some examinations for ourselves, before we make 
up an opinion respecting them. An inquiry will afford us amusement” (italics 
mine). William Crisman, in the article “Poe’s Dupin as Professional, the Dupin 
Stories as Serial Text,” argues that Dupin evolves from amateur to professional 
over the course of his stories.
 
Holmes’s status as “the world’s only private consulting detective” was an 
innovation that still sets him apart to this day. It has often been imitated, 
such as in Agatha Christie’s popular detective Hercule Poirot. Christie openly 
acknowledged Holmes as an inspiration when she created her famous Belgian 
detective. The similarities are striking:
 
✓ Just as Holmes has his friend Dr. Watson tell the story, Poirot has 
Captain Arthur Hastings, who also acts as an assistant and storyteller.
 
✓ In the Holmes stories, Inspector Lestrade is the Scotland Yard detective 
whom Holmes both works with and gets the best of. Sure enough, Poirot 
has his own version, a Chief Inspector Japp.

 Chapter 2: The Great Detective and His Life in Crime 
 
✓ Poirot even has a smarter older brother! Sherlock has Mycroft. Hercule 
has Achille!
Like doctor, like detective
Arthur Conan Doyle based the unique model of private consulting detective 
on his knowledge and experience as a medical doctor. Plenty of doctors were 
general practitioners, as Doyle was himself. Then and now, when a patient’s 
illness requires knowledge or skill beyond the general practitioner’s abilities, 
he turns to a specialist. When Doyle applied this model to detective fiction, 
Sherlock Holmes became a specialist in crime. He became the detective the 
other detectives turned to.
This doesn’t mean that Holmes didn’t get cases on his own, just like a doctor 
who specializes in a specific branch of medicine doesn’t only get patients 
through referral from other doctors. But it does mean that Holmes worked 
on a higher professional plane than other detectives, and this special status 
brought him the most interesting, challenging, and often most bizarre cases —
cases that, if he wanted to, he was free to refuse.
 
The best example of a modern private consulting detective is TV’s Adrian 
Monk (from the show Monk). Like Holmes, Monk takes in cases on his own, 
but he’s also the go-to detective when the police find themselves stumped 
(which is a lot of the time!).
Doyle’s experiences and career as a medical doctor greatly influence the 
Holmes stories in both tone and detail. Consider these examples:
 
✓ When Holmes first meets Watson, Holmes is working on a test to detect 
blood stains in a chemical lab in St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, which was 
also a medical school.
 
✓ In the early stories, Holmes struggles to make ends meet, just as Doyle 
did when he first established his own medical practice.
 
✓ As a specialist in crime detection, Holmes has profound scientific 
knowledge in specific areas, just as a doctor who specializes in certain 
diseases would have.
 
✓ For Holmes, the detective/client relationship is very much like the 
doctor/patient relationship. When meeting a client for the first time, for 
example, Holmes inquires into the person’s life and history, just as a 
doctor learns his patient’s history on first meeting. And as in a doctor/
patient relationship, there is the presumption of confidentiality. On 
more than one occasion, Holmes has refused to divulge details of both 
a client’s case and the client’s identity. And in a more indefinable way, 
Holmes often takes on the role of comforter and counselor, just as a 
doctor does when consulting with a patient over a distressing diagnosis.
 
✓ Holmes’s fees and payment structure are modeled after a doctor’s: “My 
professional charges are upon a fixed scale. I do not vary them, save 
when I remit them altogether.”

36
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
 
✓ Holmes’s method of observation and deduction is based on the 
diagnostic technique of Doyle’s medical school teacher, Dr. Joseph Bell 
(refer to the earlier section “The model for Holmes” for details).
 
The influence of Doyle’s medical training and experience gives the Sherlock 
Holmes stories a richness and authenticity that’s often lacking in other works 
of detective fiction, especially everything that came before them.
The Methods of Sherlock Holmes
I have trained myself to see what others overlook.
—Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock Holmes’s methods of detection can be divided into two categories: 
crime scene investigation and deductive reasoning. Many people unfamiliar 
with Sherlock think of him only as a crime scene investigator or as a sort of 
human computer. But to really understand his methods, it’s important to 
look at both sides of his technique.
Victorian CSI: Holmes at 
the scene of the crime
Holmes didn’t invent the detailed crime scene investigation that has become 
familiar through popular TV shows like CSI. But it’s fair to say that Holmes 
not only popularized this relatively new branch of science in detective fiction 
and the public’s mind but also showed real-life law enforcement agencies the 
potential of forensic science.
Throughout the 60 stories, Holmes investigates many crime scenes. His 
method of analysis and evidence collection is detailed and scientific:
 
✓ He pays attention to subtle clues as well as the more obvious ones: He 
examines tobacco ashes and cigar and cigarette butts, and is even 
cognizant of odor, whether it’s a type of perfume or poison on a dead 
man’s lips. Holmes often lectures the Scotland Yarders on the need to 
notice these “trifles.”
 
✓ He meticulously analyzes the evidence he finds: He examines bloodstains, 
uses tracings of footprints (both human and animal), preserves 
impressions with plaster of Paris, has handwriting analyzed, and studies 
bullet holes and firearms.
 
✓ He uses his vast knowledge to recognize clues that others miss: He can 
recognize and distinguish between death by hanging, poison, stabbing, 
gunshot, and blunt force trauma.

37
 Chapter 2: The Great Detective and His Life in Crime 
The meticulous portrayal of Holmes’s investigative and evidence-gathering 
style is still held up as an example by law enforcement agencies.
The “ideal reasoner”
Just as important as Holmes’s scientific method of crime scene investigation 
was his use of observation and deduction. Collecting evidence was one thing; 
being able to reason what it meant was another. His reasoning ability was 
usually the key to solving the mystery or catching the criminal.
As Sherlock says in A Study in Scarlet: “From a drop of water a logician could 
infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard 
of one or the other.”
Holmes’s method, then, is relatively straightforward. He would draw 
inferences based on careful study of the evidence he observed and gathered. 
When several theories were possible, he’d opt for the one that covered 
the most facts in the case until proven wrong. “It is an old maxim of mine,” 
A case study: “The Resident Patient”
Though the Sherlock Holmes stories have many 
examples of Holmes’s investigative and forensic 
ability, none presents a better case study of 
Sherlockian crime scene investigation than 
“The Resident Patient.” It’s a tour-de-force!
Holmes is summoned to the home of Dr. Percy 
Trevelyan, who has a resident patient named 
Blessington who has been found hanged in his 
bedroom. Blessington had a fear of intruders. 
Now he’s dead, hanging by the neck from a 
hook in the center of his ceiling. The police 
detective believes it’s a suicide, but Holmes’s 
examination of the bedroom convinces him 
otherwise. Several clues, including the 
discovery of four cigar ends and tobacco 
ashes, tell him that Blessington was visited by 
three intruders in the middle of the night.
First, Holmes examines Blessington’s cigar 
case, which was in the victim’s coat pocket. 
Inside it he finds a single cigar. It’s a Havana, 
but the other four cigar ends are an unusually 
thin type of cigar imported from East India. 
Holmes therefore knows immediately that 
Blessington didn’t smoke these cigars.
Further examination reveals that two were 
smoked with a holder and two without a holder. 
That means that more than one cigar smoker 
had been present. Holmes then examines the 
room, paying close attention to where the 
ashes of the cigars fell. He’s able to deduce that 
the man with the cigar holder sat in a wicker 
chair, a second man sat in a chair near a chest 
of drawers (he repeatedly knocked his ash off 
against it), and a third man paced up and down 
on the opposite side of the room. This evidence 
also tells Holmes that they had been there 
for a long period of time, and so some kind of 
deliberation must have been going on. 
Ultimately, Blessington was hanged.
“This is no suicide,” said Sherlock Holmes to 
inspector Lanner. “It is a very deeply planned 
and cold-blooded murder.”

38
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
he tells Watson, “that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever 
remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”
Many of the stories begin with a display of Sherlockian deductive reasoning:
 
✓ “A Scandal in Bohemia”: Holmes deduces that Watson had gotten very 
wet lately and that he has a clumsy and careless servant girl. He knows 
this by observing that the inside of Watson’s left shoe is scored by six 
parallel cuts. He deduces that they were made by a careless servant girl 
after Watson was out in bad weather.
 
✓ The Hound of the Baskervilles: The novel begins with an amusing yet 
instructive demonstration of Holmes’s method. By examining the marks 
and inscription on a walking stick that was left behind by a prospective 
client while Holmes and Watson were out, Holmes deduces that the 
owner was “amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded.” He also concludes 
that he has a medium-sized dog. And of course, he’s right!
The canon contains many other outstanding examples of deductive reasoning. 
On several occasions, Holmes is able to state a total stranger’s occupation. In 
A Study in Scarlet, it’s a retired military man. In “The Red-Headed League” it’s 
a ship’s carpenter who is now a pawnbroker. In “The Greek Interpreter,” it’s a 
retired artillery officer.
Holmes also makes astonishing deductions by observing objects and personal 
items including hats, pipes, shoes, and the knees of someone’s pants. From 
the examination of a pocket watch, Holmes discovers that Watson’s late 
brother was an alcoholic gambler.
Holmes was often accused of being insensitive in his pursuit of “that true 
cold reason which I place above all things.” Watson once accused him of 
being “an automaton — a calculating machine,” adding that “there is 
something positively inhuman in you at times.” It’s not that Holmes is 
uncaring. But when a client comes to him with a case, Holmes deliberately 
approaches the person and the situation as a cipher or puzzle to solve. As 
Watson explains, “grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own 
high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in 
a nature such as his.” Sherlock’s rationalism occasionally caused him to be 
insensitive to his client’s feelings.
Stocking his brain attic
In pursuit of his role as the world’s first and only consulting detective, Sherlock 
Holmes embarked upon a unique and specialized course of study. He describes 
his brain as an attic, which he prefers to stock with only the information that 
helps him as a detective. Without taking any formal classes, Holmes becomes 
a first-class chemist. As he says, his studies were “eccentric,” and those who 

39
 Chapter 2: The Great Detective and His Life in Crime 
knew him couldn’t figure out what use he was going to put all that learning to. 
As someone describes him in A Study in Scarlet, “he has amassed a lot of out-of-
the-way knowledge which would astonish his professors.”
This practice of studying subjects that would further his skill as a detective 
is one that Holmes pursues throughout his career. And he draws on this 
knowledge when taking on a case, comparing his current puzzle to thousands 
of prior crimes, looking for similarities and patterns. He tells Scotland Yard 
Inspector Stanley Hopkins that “the most practical thing that you ever did 
in your life would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve 
hours a day at the annals of crime.”
Holmes’s research often leads him to write papers, articles, and monographs 
(treatises), which were usually technical publications that he recommended 
to other detectives. They include:
 
✓ “Upon the Distinction Between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccos”: This 
work describes 140 different tobacco ashes and includes color plates.
 
✓ “The Polyphonic Motets of Lassus”: Holmes printed this work for private 
circulation, said by some experts to be the last word on the subject. 
(We’ll take their word for it!)
 
✓ Two articles on ears in the Anthropological Journal.
 
✓ A monograph on secret writings in which 160 different ciphers are 
analyzed.
 
✓ A monograph on the dating of documents.
 
✓ A contribution to the literature of tattoos.
 
✓ A monograph on the tracing of footsteps.
 
✓ A monograph on the influence of the trade on the form of the hand.
 
✓ “The Book of Life,” a magazine article laying out his theory of observation 
and deduction.
 
✓ “The Practical Handbook of Bee Culture,” on, you guessed it, bee behavior.
Holmes on the “brain attic”
In A Study in Scarlet, Watson confesses 
amazement that Holmes is ignorant of the 
Copernican theory that the planets orbit the 
sun. Holmes goes on to explain his theory of 
brain capacity. “I consider that a man’s brain 
originally is like a little empty attic,” he says, 
“and you have to stock it with such furniture as 
you choose.” After saying only a fool jumbles up 
his brain with useless knowledge, he adds that 
“the skilful workman” will “have nothing but the 
tools which may help him in doing his work, but 
of these he has a large assortment, and all in 
the most perfect order.”

40
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
Over the course of the stories, Holmes demonstrates a wide degree of 
knowledge, but he doesn’t know everything (see the sidebar “Sherlock 
Holmes didn’t know everything” for a list of the limits of Sherlock’s knowledge). 
Most of his knowledge relates to his career as a detective and covers the 
criminal world of London, including such subjects as
 
✓ The details of continental crime
 
✓ Foreign languages, including French, German, and Latin
 
✓ The Bible (but this is a bit “rusty”)
 
✓ Dogs
 
✓ An exact knowledge of the geography of London
 
✓ Newspaper typefaces
Sherlock Holmes didn’t know everything
Shortly after Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson 
begin sharing rooms, Watson finds himself 
fascinated by his strange new friend — his 
peculiar habits, the odd visitors, and most of all, 
what Holmes knows and doesn’t know.
“His ignorance was as remarkable as his 
knowledge,” Watson writes of his roommate. 
“Of contemporary literature, philosophy and 
politics he appeared to know next to nothing. . . . 
My surprise reached a climax, however, when 
I found that he was ignorant of the Copernican 
Theory and of the composition of the Solar 
System.”
Finally, Watson draws up a list of Sherlock’s 
knowledge and entitles it “Sherlock Holmes — 
His Limits.”
 1. Knowledge of Literature — Nil.
 2. Philosophy — Nil.
 3. Astronomy — Nil.
 4. Politics — Feeble.
 5. Botany — Variable. Well up in belladonna, 
opium, and poisons generally. Knows noth-
ing of practical gardening.
 6. Knowledge of Geology — Practical, but 
limited. Tells at a glance different soils from 
each other. After walks has shown me 
splashes upon his trousers, and told me by 
their colour and consistence in what part of 
London he had received them.
 7. Knowledge of Chemistry — Profound.
 8. Anatomy — Accurate, but unsystematic.
 9. Sensational Literature — Immense. He 
appears to know every detail of every 
horror perpetrated in the century.
 10. Plays the violin well.
 11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and 
swordsman.
 12. Has a good practical knowledge of British 
law.

Tools of the trade
While the best tool Sherlock Holmes uses is his great brain, as a detective he 
also uses a variety of objects. Some help him gather evidence, and some are 
for personal defense. Most are legal, but some are decidedly illegal!
Holmes doesn’t carry a crime scene bag like modern detectives, but he does 
have items in his pockets to help him. These include a magnifying glass, a 
tape measure, and an envelope for collecting evidence such as tobacco ash.
For personal protection, Holmes’s weapon of choice is the riding (also known 
as hunting) crop. For instance, Holmes uses it to strike out at the poisonous 
snake in “The Speckled Band,” and he nearly thrashes the heartless stepfather 
in “A Case of Identity.”
He also carries a cane, which he uses as a weapon when needed. He is, 
according to Watson, an expert at “singlestick,” a form of fighting using a 
stick or cane. And on rare occasions, both Holmes and Watson use pistols, 
although Holmes usually prefers that Watson carry the gun. Some have 
speculated that this may mean Holmes isn’t a very good shot!
As a private consulting detective, Holmes was a free agent and therefore 
could employ methods not open to the police — like housebreaking (see 
Figure 2-2)! There are two examples in the stories of Sherlockian burglary: 
In both “The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton” and “The Bruce-
Partington Plans,” Holmes and Watson resort to illegal entry in pursuit of 
justice. When playing burglar instead of detective, the tools of the trade 
included black silk face-coverings, rubber-soled tennis shoes, a glass cutter, a 
jemmy, a dark lantern, and a chisel.
Other skills that come in handy
In addition to possessing obvious detective skills, Sherlock Holmes had other 
talents that came in handy. These gave him an added edge over the average 
official police detective.

42
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
An actor and a rare one
When someone who has never read a Sherlock Holmes story is asked to say 
what they know about the Great Detective, one of the most frequent answers 
is, “He often uses a disguise!” This is one of the best-known characteristics 
of Sherlock Holmes, and it was a powerful and effective tool in his arsenal as 
detective.
Watson describes Holmes as a talented actor. Holmes often goes undercover, 
adopting a disguise to penetrate the criminal’s lair or to gather evidence that 
may not be available under normal circumstances. His skill as an actor and 
at adopting disguises was so remarkable that he was even able to fool his 
close friend Watson. In “A Scandal in Bohemia,” Holmes adopts the identity 
of a drunken groom and is so convincing that Watson has to look three times 
before he’s certain that the groom is actually Sherlock Holmes. “It was not 
merely that Holmes changed his costume,” says Watson. “His expression, his 
manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed.”

 Chapter 2: The Great Detective and His Life in Crime 
Athletic skills
While seldom taking exercise for exercise’s sake, Sherlock Holmes was 
nevertheless a remarkable athlete, and this physical ability was a great aid 
in his chosen career. It allowed him the strength to follow a bloodhound 
through the streets and alleyways of London in The Sign of the Four, to climb 
a tall fireplace mantle in “The Abbey Grange,” and to climb a slippery rock 
wall out of the Reichenbach Falls in “The Empty House.”
It’s at the Reichenbach Falls that Holmes fights Professor Moriarty to the 
death. The climactic battle is won by Holmes, thanks to his knowledge of the 
obscure martial art of bartitsu, or the Japanese system of wrestling, which 
Holmes said had “more than once been very useful to me.”
Holmes is also a formidable boxer, a skill that comes in handy on several 
occasions. The first mention of this talent comes in The Sign of the Four, in 
which it says that Sherlock “fought three rounds” in a benefit fight four years 
earlier. In “The Solitary Cyclist,” Holmes is challenged to a fight in a pub by 
Jack Woodley, the villain of the tale (see Figure 2-3). It isn’t wise to pick a bar 
fight with Sherlock Holmes — Woodley went home in a cart.

Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
A Few (Not So Small) Quirks
 
One of the reasons readers return to the Sherlock Holmes stories over and 
over, even when they know the solution to the mystery, is the character of 
Holmes himself. Holmes seems like a real person, full of contradictions, both 
virtuous and flawed. He’s not a superhero but instead a real character with 
real issues.
Melancholy
Did Holmes suffer from depression? Many readers have wondered. When 
you read Watson say that Sherlock has periods of “excellent spirits” that 
“alternated with fits of the blackest depression,” a pretty clear picture begins 
to emerge. Time and again, Holmes is seen slipping into a funk:
“Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable 
world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across 
the dun-coloured houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and 
material?”
Watson speaks of a “dual nature” and how under the strain of work, Holmes 
has what looks exactly like a nervous breakdown:
His iron constitution, however, had broken down under the strain of an 
investigation which had extended over two months, during which period 
he had never worked less than fifteen hours a day and had more than 
once, as he assured me, kept to his task for five days at a stretch. Even 
the triumphant issue of his labours could not save him from reaction 
after so terrible an exertion, and at a time when Europe was ringing with 
his name and when his room was literally ankle-deep with congratulatory 
telegrams I found him a prey to the blackest depression.
It was while in this state that Holmes often resorted to drugs.
Drug use
“Which is it to-day,” I asked, “morphine or cocaine?”
That Sherlock Holmes is a drug addict in the early years of his detective 
career is undeniable. You find out about this unfortunate habit in The Sign of 
the Four. Watson says that for several months he has witnessed Holmes take 
drugs three times a day:

45
 Chapter 2: The Great Detective and His Life in Crime 
Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantelpiece, 
and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, 
white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle and rolled back 
his left shirtcuff. For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon 
the sinewy forearm and wrist, all dotted and scarred with innumerable 
puncture-marks. Finally, he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down 
the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined armchair with a long 
sigh of satisfaction.
Evidence indicates that Holmes alternated between morphine and cocaine, 
both of which were perfectly legal in Victorian London. Legal or not, Watson 
implored his friend to quit and often lectured him on the damage to his body 
and mind that his drug use was causing.
Holmes explained that drugs were a response to boredom and lack of work. 
Once, when Watson asks Holmes if he currently has a case, Holmes responds 
by saying, “None. Hence the cocaine.”
As his doctor and his friend, Watson is finally able to wean Sherlock from his 
drug addiction. In later years, while Holmes was able to resist the craving for 
drugs, Watson knew a relapse was always possible, especially during slow 
times between cases. It was then that Watson would see a drawn, brooding 
look in his friend’s face and know that the urge “was not dead, but sleeping.”
Smoking
Despite being a fictional character, Holmes is one of the great smokers in 
history. While partial to pipes and cigarettes, he also smokes cigars. He’s 
often portrayed as smoking a large, oversized calabash pipe.
 
The calabash pipe, shown in Figure 2-4, wasn’t a feature in Doyle’s tales. It was 
actually an invention of the actor William Gillette, who portrayed Holmes on 
the stage in the early 20th century. Gillette used the calabash because it was 
easier to deliver his lines while smoking it. The calabash has been associated 
with Sherlock Holmes ever since.
 
Holmes’s pipe tobacco of choice was called “shag.” Shag is not a flavor but a 
method of cutting the tobacco leaves into a very fine, narrow leaf. Doing so 
made it suitable for rolling into cigarettes as well.
Sherlock had several peculiar smoking habits. One was keeping his tobacco 
in the toe-end of a Persian slipper tacked to the mantle of his fireplace, a 
practice that left the tobacco in the hot, dry air near the fire, making it smoke 
hot and fast. Even worse was his disgusting habit of the “plugs and dottles.” 

46
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
Holmes’s first pipe of the morning “consisted of all the plugs and dottles of 
the previous day.” Yuck!
Finally, Holmes smokes a lot! He smokes when he wakes up. He smokes when 
he’s reading or just hanging out at Baker Street. And he really smokes when 
he’s on a case. The smoky atmosphere of the Baker Street rooms and the 
soothing tobacco helps him think and meditate on the problem. A case that’s 
particularly mysterious is called “a three-pipe problem.” Tobacco use was an 
addiction that, unlike drugs, Sherlock Holmes never gave up.

Case Files: A Rundown 
of Significant Cases
Any list of the best or most significant cases of Sherlock Holmes is by necessity 
up for debate. Even Doyle’s own list (see the sidebar “Arthur Conan Doyle’s 
favorite stories” in Chapter 1) is disputed by fans! But some cases are definite 
landmarks. Following is a list of some of Holmes’s more significant cases:

47
 Chapter 2: The Great Detective and His Life in Crime 
 
✓ A Study in Scarlet: This short novel is the first Sherlock Holmes story. 
It’s notable for its account of the first meeting of Holmes and Watson and 
the beginning of their immortal partnership. The book is split into two 
halves. The first half is Watson’s account of the investigation of a strange 
murder in a deserted house. The second half is called “The Country of the 
Saints” and is a flashback that provides motivation and a back story to 
the murder in England. It takes place among the Mormons in the state of 
Utah in the U.S. By the end of the book, the link between the two halves is 
made, and it’s revealed that the motive for the crime is revenge.
 
✓ The Sign of the Four: This novel is the second Holmes story to be 
written and published. The Sign of the Four is a more mature, complicated 
book than A Study in Scarlet and paints a far more bohemian and textured 
picture of the Great Detective. For instance, it’s here that Holmes’s drug 
habit first appears. It’s also in this book that Watson meets his first wife, 
Mary Morstan.
 
 The Sign of the Four was commissioned on August 30, 1889, at a dinner 
party held by the managing editor of Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine, 
Joseph M. Stoddart, at the Langham Hotel in London. This memorable 
meal also had another prospective contributor, Oscar Wilde, who went 
on to write The Picture of Dorian Gray for the magazine.
 
✓ “A Scandal in Bohemia”: This is the first of the 56 Sherlock Holmes 
short stories to be published in The Strand Magazine. Holmes is hired by 
the king of Bohemia to thwart an anticipated blackmail attempt by the 
“adventuress,” Irene Adler. As Watson says in the very first line of the 
tale, “To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard 
him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and 
predominates the whole of her sex.” “A Scandal in Bohemia” has fueled 
endless speculation about a potential romance between Holmes and 
Irene Adler, of “dubious and questionable memory.”
 
✓ “The Speckled Band”: One of the most famous tales in the Sherlockian 
canon, this story of creeping murder has it all: an evil stepfather, an old 
Gothic English manor house, a midnight vigil in the dark, and a thrilling 
climax. Doyle adapted this story into a successful stage play in 1910.
 
✓ “Silver Blaze”: On the eve of an important race, the racehorse Silver 
Blaze has been stolen, and his trainer has been found murdered. It’s up 
to Holmes and Watson to find the killer and recover the horse before 
race day. With its atmospheric portrayal of Dartmoor, this is one of the 
most popular stories in the canon. It’s also the origin of the popular 
reference to “the dog that did nothing in the night-time.”
 
✓ “The Final Problem”: “It is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen to 
write these the last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts 
by which my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes was distinguished.” So begins 
this story, which introduces the greatest villain in all of detective fiction, 
the criminal mastermind Professor James Moriarty. “The Final Problem” 
includes Holmes’s long investigation into Moriarty’s criminal organization, 

48
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
a chilling visit by the professor himself to Holmes’s rooms on Baker 
Street, three murderous attempts on Holmes’s life, and the hair-raising 
flight to the continent to escape. And of course, it has the most shocking 
ending of any story in the canon: “An examination by experts leaves 
little doubt that a personal contest between the two men ended, as it 
could hardly fail to end in such a situation, in their reeling over, locked 
in each other’s arms.”
 
✓ The Hound of the Baskervilles: This novel is a masterpiece of Gothic 
suspense and atmosphere and is often cited as one of, if not the greatest 
mystery story of all time. The Baskerville family of Dartmoor has a 
family legend that says they’re cursed to die violent deaths and be 
haunted by a ghostly hound of hell. When elderly Sir Charles is found 
dead and a ghastly hound is seen on the moor, Holmes and Watson are 
enlisted to protect the young new heir. With its melancholy, gloomy 
atmosphere and supernatural overtones, this story ranks as the all-time 
favorite Sherlock Holmes story.
 
✓ “The Empty House”: Holmes returns from the dead in this tale. His 
surprising reappearance causes his landlady, Mrs. Hudson, to go into 
hysterics, and his friend Watson to faint! Holmes recounts how he 
narrowly escaped death at the Reichenbach Falls, spent three years 
abroad letting criminal London believe he was dead, and returned to 
capture the remaining member of Professor Moriarty’s gang.
 
✓ “The Dying Detective”: Upon learning that his friend Holmes is dying 
from an infectious disease, Watson hurries to his aid. He finds Holmes 
delirious and on death’s door. In between bouts of raving and abuse, 
Watson learns that there is one man in London capable of helping him. 
Can Watson persuade him to come? And why must he hide behind the 
headboard of the bed when he does?
 
✓ “The Illustrious Client”: It’s here that Holmes goes up against one of the 
worst villains in all the stories — Baron Adlebert Gruner, the Austrian 
murderer. This hypnotic womanizer is engaged to a prominent member 
of society’s daughter, and Holmes is persuaded by an “illustrious client” 
to intervene. Despite not having an actual mystery to solve, this story — 
with its overtones of sexual perversion and violence and the thinly-
veiled member of the royal family who hires Holmes — is one of the 
most memorable of the later tales.
 
✓ “His Last Bow”: On the eve of World War I, German spy Von Bork is 
preparing to leave England the intelligence he has gathered. He’s waiting 
for one last piece of crucial information, which is to be delivered by an 
Irish-American spy named Altamont. This story provides a glimpse of 
a 60-year-old Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson called out of retirement 
to foil the German’s plans. It gives us a final glimpse of our old friends. 
“Stand with me here upon the terrace,” Holmes says to Watson, “for it 
may be the last quiet talk that we shall ever have.” (This was intended to 
be the last Sherlock Holmes story ever published, but financial need and 
popular demand forced Doyle to write more stories in later years.)

F
rom childhood, Arthur Conan Doyle was a natural storyteller. At first 
glance, you wouldn’t have taken the tall, athletic boy for someone with 
an artistic nature. But from his earliest days, Doyle spun tales. His first 
audience was his mother, who filled her child’s imagination with stories of 
knights, chivalry, and adventure. Later in school, Doyle regularly kept his 
classmates spellbound with tales of bloodthirsty pirates and scary ghost 
stories. In retrospect, Arthur Conan Doyle was born to be a writer.
The adage “write what you know” certainly fit Doyle’s approach. Much of his 
work contains autobiographical elements. For example, his 1895 novel The 
Stark Munro Letters, the story of a young doctor’s struggle to establish himself 
in medical practice, is clearly autobiographical. Throughout his career, he 
drew on both his personal and professional life for inspiration, writing an 
astonishing number of tales with an English doctor like himself as the 
protagonist. These obviously include the Sherlock Holmes stories.
Doyle’s Early Life and Education
Arthur Conan Doyle, shown in Figure 3-1, was the son of an Irish father who 
was born and raised in England and an Irish mother who lived in Edinburgh, 
Scotland. Arthur was born in Edinburgh in 1859. With his Irish ethnicity, 
his Scottish burr, and his English citizenship, Doyle embodied the United 
Kingdom and was thoroughly British in his outlook.

“Art in the blood”
Doyle once had Sherlock Holmes say that “art in the blood is likely to take 
the strangest of forms.” As usual, he was writing from personal experience. 
Doyle came from an artistic family. His grandfather was John Doyle, a famous 
political cartoonist. Arthur’s uncles were artists, too. One was Henry Doyle, 
who was the director of Ireland’s National Gallery, and the other was Richard 
“Dicky” Doyle, famous for illustrating Punch magazine.
Arthur’s father was Charles Altamont Doyle. Charles also had artistic talent 
but never reached a high level of fame. He was an architectural draftsman in 
the Scottish Office of Works and held this job for 30 years, supplementing his 
meager pay with book and magazine illustrating.
Charles married Mary Foley, and together they had ten children, but only 
seven survived. Arthur inherited his storytelling skills from his mother. Mary 
Doyle often read to her children or made up stories with such skill that, as an 
adult, Arthur would say in his autobiography, “the vivid stories she would tell 
me stand out so clearly that they obscure the real facts of my life.”
Unfortunately, the family was not without its problems. Charles was a 
chronic alcoholic, an affliction that worsened through the years, causing 

51
 Chapter 3: Arthur Conan Doyle: The Doctor Who Created the Detective
emotional and financial hardship for his wife and children. As Charles’s 
alcoholism (and later epilepsy) worsened, the family found its financial 
fortunes in a slow downward spiral. Ultimately, Charles was committed to 
an asylum, and the family was forced to take in lodgers to make ends meet. 
Arthur’s strong, resourceful mother kept the family together and forever 
earned the devotion of her son.
This period had a profound impact on Doyle, and that impact is reflected 
throughout his writing. Young women in financial need, abusive alcoholic 
husbands and fathers, and households with sometimes unsavory lodgers all 
find their way into his fiction, including the Sherlock Holmes stories.
 
You may have heard Arthur referred to as “Conan Doyle” enough that you 
think “Conan Doyle” was a compound last name. However, “Conan” was 
Arthur’s middle name. Shortly after he graduated from high school he began 
using Conan as a sort of surname. But technically, his last name is simply 
“Doyle.”
Boarding school
Throughout most of his childhood, Doyle didn’t live at home. At the age of 
9, he was sent to England to attend a Jesuit preparatory school and then to 
Stonyhurst, a Jesuit secondary school. These weren’t happy times for Doyle. 
The school was very strict, and corporal punishment was common. As Doyle 
characterized himself in his autobiography, he was “wild, full blooded and a 
trifle reckless.” This brought Arthur his fair share of discipline. He graduated 
in 1876 at the age of 17.
 
Coming from a Catholic family, it wasn’t unusual for Arthur to attend a private 
Catholic boarding school (with the help of wealthier relatives). But it was here 
that the young man began to question his faith, heading down a path that 
would land him in a very different spiritual place years later.
During this time, Doyle began writing regular letters to his mother and 
cultivating the lifelong habit of correspondence. He also worked on his 
storytelling skills by entertaining his fellow students with exciting tales he 
would make up.
Medical school
Given his family background, his artistic nature, and his admittedly wild 
adolescence, it’s surprising that Doyle chose to go into medicine. He was 
accepted into the University of Edinburgh to study medicine in 1876. His 
medical training and the impressions left by his instructors laid the foundation 

52
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
for the rest of his life. These experiences trained him in science, fueled his 
literary career, and even helped form his religious and philosophical outlook 
on life. Perhaps the greatest influence came from his instructors, two of 
which memorably show up later in his writing:
 
✓ Professor William Rutherford: With his Assyrian beard, booming voice, 
and bombastic personality, Rutherford was the model for Professor 
George Edward Challenger of Doyle’s landmark science fiction novel The 
Lost World.
 
✓ Dr. Joseph Bell: Bell had, without question, the greatest influence on 
Doyle. He was legendary for his ability to make a diagnosis without the 
patient ever saying a word by using observation and deduction. This 
seemingly magical ability was a lesson Doyle never forgot. (For more 
detail about Bell and his role in the creation of Sherlock Holmes, go to 
Chapter 2.)
Even before he graduated from medical school, Doyle had become a published 
author. His short story “The Mystery of Sasassa Valley” was published in 
Chamber’s Journal. He followed it up with “The American Tale,” which was 
published in London Society.
Writing wasn’t the only way Doyle earned money while in medical school. In 
1880, he took a job as a doctor on the whaling ship Hope. (Whaling was 
considered a normal commercial activity back in those days.) In his auto
biography, he cites this adventure as one of the greatest experiences of his 
life. “I went on board the whaler a big straggling youth,” he later wrote. “I 
came off a powerful well-grown man.”
Upon graduation, Doyle hoped to have another adventure similar to his 
arctic voyage. This time he signed on to the Mayumba as the ship’s surgeon 
and sailed to Africa in 1881. He had many adventures on these voyages, 
ranging from dealing with tropical fevers to battling fire at sea.
Early practice and hard lessons
In 1882, Doyle returned to England and settled in Plymouth, a bustling 
southern port city. Arthur was invited to join the practice of an eccentric 
friend, Dr. George Budd, who had a well-deserved reputation for being 
hot-headed. Budd also had a profitable practice. In fact, it was booming! 
Doyle accepted Budd’s invitation, and it didn’t take long to find the secret 
of Budd’s success: He saw every patient for free but charged heavily for the 
medicines he prescribed. In Budd’s defense, he didn’t prescribe unnecessary 
medicine, and this strange business plan seemed to work.

53
 Chapter 3: Arthur Conan Doyle: The Doctor Who Created the Detective
Then the relationship between the two men went bad. Budd, it turned out, 
was paranoid and had been reading Doyle’s mail. He learned that Doyle and 
his mother had been discussing the practice, and Mary Doyle clearly stated 
her disapproval of Dr. Budd. Even though Doyle had defended Budd in the 
letters, Budd took it badly and ended the partnership, making a promise of 
financial aid so that Doyle could set up his own practice — aid that never 
materialized. Doyle left Plymouth and went to Southsea, Portsmouth, to set 
up his own private practice. At first it wasn’t very profitable, but the young 
doctor’s rather quiet offices would be remembered forever as the place 
where Sherlock Holmes came to life.
Early literary pursuits
Doyle wrote his first story at the age of 6. It was a tale about a man who was 
eaten by a tiger. In his autobiography, Memories and Adventures, he says that 
he never finished the story, because “. . . when the tiger had absorbed him, I 
found myself slightly embarrassed as to how my story was to go on . . . 
It is very easy to get people into scrapes, and very hard to get them out 
again.” Doyle relearned this lesson decades later when, after killing Sherlock 
Holmes, he decided to revive him. (See the section “The Death (And Rebirth) 
of Holmes” for more on that.)
Although Doyle gave up on that first story, he never lost his fascination with 
writing. His early successes came while still in medical school. Some of these 
better known early tales include
 
✓ “The Gully of Blueman’s Dyke” (1881, London Society): In this tale 
set in the Australian gold fields, many men head off to the diggings, but 
none come back. What is it that’s waiting for them in Blueman’s Dyke?
 
✓ “The Captain of the Pole-Star” (1881, Temple Bar): This spooky ghost 
story is one of Doyle’s classics. The crew of the arctic whaler The Pole 
Star find that their captain is a haunted, troubled man. As days turn into 
weeks among the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean, stories about ghosts 
begin to circulate among the crew.
 
✓ “My Friend the Murderer” (1882, London Society): Told in the first-
person, this tale centers on a prison doctor who has an extraordinary 
interview with a notorious killer. The title of this story is one of Doyle’s 
best.
Many of Doyle’s stories were published anonymously, a normal custom for 
Victorian magazines. This practice enabled critically-acclaimed authors to 
write popular romances or adventure fiction for magazines purely for money, 

54
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
and it protected reputations (a key reason why some people choose to 
publish anonymously today!) Doyle, however, concluded that for him, 
publishing anonymously was a dead end. He decided to try writing books 
and make a name for himself.
The Case of the Bored Doctor and 
the Birth of Sherlock Holmes
The year was 1887. With the slow pace of his relatively new medical practice, 
Doyle had spare time on his hands, and so he again turned to writing as a 
way of increasing his income.
 
A popular myth about Doyle is that he was a failure as a doctor. But that’s 
only a myth. Doyle’s practice was very slow for the first six months, but within 
the year he was making a living as a doctor. Records indicate that by the third 
year he was making £300 annually — four times the wage of a skilled craftsman 
like a carpenter or printer. In London, a physician could make as little as £150 
annually, with an average annual wage being £350. He was clearly not a failure.
His powerful imagination strayed to the mesmerizing memory of his old 
medical school professor, Dr. Joseph Bell. Reflecting on his mentor’s uncanny 
ability at observation and deduction, Doyle began to see the outlines of what 
would be his greatest creation: Sherlock Holmes.
Holmes made his debut in the novel A Study in Scarlet in the 1887 issue of 
Beeton’s Christmas Annual, a seasonal publication that featured short stories, 
novellas, and drawing-room plays, usually written by new, relatively unknown 
authors. It came out in November at a price of one shilling. It was a true 
“shilling shocker,” and was usually sold out before Christmas.
If at first you don’t succeed
Beeton’s Christmas Annual wasn’t Doyle’s first choice as publisher. In fact, it 
was his last. Doyle’s luck at finding a home for A Study in Scarlet was so bad 
that Sherlock Holmes almost didn’t happen. He had been regularly submitting 
his previous novel, The Firm of Girdlestone (the story of a family business run 
by an unethical father and son, who try to murder a young woman for her 
inheritance), to a series of publishers and garnering a collection of rejection 
notices in return. But with his new detective novel, he thought he was onto 
something big. In his autobiography, Memories and Adventures, Doyle says,
I knew that the book was as good as I could make it, and I had high 
hopes. When Girdlestone used to come circling back with the precision of 

55
 Chapter 3: Arthur Conan Doyle: The Doctor Who Created the Detective
a homing pigeon, I was grieved but not surprised, for I acquiesced in the 
decision. But when my little Holmes book began also to do the circular 
tour I was hurt, for I knew that it deserved a better fate.
After numerous rejections, he finally received an offer from Ward, Lock & Co., 
the publishers of Beeton’s Christmas Annual.
An (underwhelming) offer 
he couldn’t refuse
The publishers of Beeton’s Christmas Annual obviously didn’t understand the 
huge opportunity that had come to them with A Study in Scarlet. They wrote 
Doyle and said
Dear Sir,
We have read your story A Study in Scarlet, and are pleased with it. We 
could not publish it this year, as the market is flooded at present with 
cheap fiction, but if you do not object to its being held over until next 
year we will give you £25 for the copyright.
Ward, Lock & Co.
As desperate to get published as he was, Doyle still hesitated to accept 
the offer. But in the end, he figured this deal was better than no deal at 
all. “Therefore I accepted,” he admits in his autobiography, “and the book 
became ‘Beeton’s Xmas Annual’ of 1887. I never at any time received another 
penny for it.”
It was here, between the precarious pages of Beeton’s Christmas Annual, that 
the public first met the immortal duo of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, 
whose partnership quite literally changed history.
 
Arthur Conan Doyle didn’t choose Sherlock as the name for his detective right 
away. At first he called him Sherrinford Holmes, and Watson almost got stuck 
with the name of Ormond Sacker! Fortunately, Doyle changed his mind before 
he got too far into A Study in Scarlet.
Catching on with the public
The reception Holmes received upon his debut was less than great. In fact, 
despite a few positive reviews, A Study in Scarlet just sort of came and went. 
When Sherlock made his second bow in The Sign of the Four, the results were 
a little better, but still, that could have been it for the Great Detective. But 
then came The Strand Magazine.

56
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
Holmes’s appearance in The Strand Magazine was an instant sensation. The 
editor, Herbert Greenhough Smith, instantly recognized he was onto something 
special when the first few Sherlock Holmes stories landed on his desk. The 
magazine ended up being the permanent home of every new Holmes story. 
Every time the magazine’s cover boasted a new Holmes tale, circulation 
soared and people stood in lines just to snatch up a copy.
The first batch of stories ran from July 1891 to June 1892 and were then 
published in book form as The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in October 
1892. They were:
 
✓  “A Scandal in Bohemia”
 
✓  “The Red-Headed League”
 
✓  “A Case of Identity”
 
✓  “The Boscombe Valley Mystery”
 
✓  “The Five Orange Pips”
 
✓  “The Man with the Twisted Lip”
 
✓  “The Blue Carbuncle”
 
✓  “The Speckled Band”
 
✓  “The Engineer’s Thumb”
 
✓  “The Noble Bachelor”
 
✓  “The Beryl Coronet”
 
✓  “The Copper Beeches”
The Death (And Rebirth) of Holmes
The public was wildly enthusiastic about Sherlock Holmes, but one man 
didn’t share that feeling. Incredibly, it was Arthur Conan Doyle himself. He 
had greater ambitions in mind as a writer; he believed he’d make his mark in 
literature by writing historical novels (for more on these works, see “Other 
Literary Endeavors” later in this chapter). The public, however, wanted more 
Sherlock Holmes. Doyle began to see the detective as an impediment to his 
work instead of as a part of it.
Economic realities kept Doyle writing about Holmes for a while longer, but 
he soon began to plot a way out. While vacationing in Switzerland, he found a 
way to make sure Sherlock never bothered him again.

57
 Chapter 3: Arthur Conan Doyle: The Doctor Who Created the Detective
“Killed Holmes!”
To kill off Sherlock Holmes, Doyle created another character who was as 
great a villain as Holmes was a hero: Professor Moriarty, the “Napoleon of 
crime,” the most serious threat Holmes would ever face (see Chapter 7 for 
more on Moriarty).
It was on that vacation in Switzerland that Doyle found the crime scene: 
Reichenbach Falls (see Figure 3-2). With its thundering cascade plunging 
over 800 feet and its mist rising out of a fearful chasm far below, it seemed 
a perfectly dramatic place for Holmes to end his career. Upon his return to 
England, Doyle wrote “The Final Problem,” and on the night he finished it, he 
wrote in his diary just two words, “Killed Holmes.”

Doyle never realized how popular Sherlock Holmes was until he killed him. 
“I was amazed at the concern expressed by the public,” he wrote in his 
autobiography. “They say a man is never properly appreciated until he is 
dead, and the general protest against my summary execution of Holmes 
taught me how many and numerous were his friends. ‘You Brute!’ was the 
beginning of the letter which one lady sent me. . . .”

58
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
Over 20,000 people canceled their subscriptions to The Strand Magazine in 
protest. Young men in London took to wearing black mourning bands. Some 
young women wore black. The Prince of Wales expressed dismay, and it was 
rumored that Queen Victoria herself “was not amused.”
In the timeline of the Sherlockian canon, Sherlock Holmes was officially dead 
from 1891 to 1894. In reality, ten years passed before Doyle decided to officially 
reverse the death sentence and bring Holmes back to life.
Doyle moves on, despite a 
few backward glances
In retrospect, it wasn’t long before the first hints of regret at killing off 
Holmes began to show up. While publicly he was firm in his conviction to 
keep Holmes dead, Doyle kept getting ideas for Holmes-like stories. Clearly, 
one can find the ghost of Sherlock Holmes in a series of tales Doyle called 
Round the Fire Stories. Many Holmes scholars believe that two of the stories, 
published in The Strand Magazine, actually include cameos by Holmes himself:
 
✓ “The Story of the Man with the Watches” (July 1898): Holmes fans 
believe that Sherlock Holmes himself appears as the author of a letter 
to the Daily Gazette. The letter’s author is described as “a well-known 
criminal investigator” who writes:
 
 In the absence of data we must abandon the analytic or scientific 
method of investigation, and must approach it in the synthetic 
fashion. In a word, instead of taking known events and deducing 
from them what has occurred, we must build up a fanciful 
explanation if it will only be consistent with known events.
 
 No doubt about it . . . that’s Sherlock Holmes.
 
✓ “The Story of the Lost Special” (August 1898): This tale also has a 
letter-writer, this time to the Times of London. The author comments 
“over the signature of an amateur reasoner of some celebrity” who 
writes:
 
 It is one of the elementary principles of practical reasoning that 
when the impossible has been eliminated the residuum, however 
improbable, must contain the truth.
 
 If you remember Holmes’s famous doctrine, “when you have eliminated 
the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the 
truth,” then you recognize the letter-writer as Holmes.

59
 Chapter 3: Arthur Conan Doyle: The Doctor Who Created the Detective
By 1900, Doyle was working on an eerie novel about a phantom hound that 
haunted a family named Baskerville (see Chapter 9) when he realized that it 
needed something more — it needed a hero. Realizing he had already created 
the perfect central character that could tie the story together, he once again 
turned to Sherlock Holmes. But Sherlock wasn’t back from the dead yet. It 
would be another couple of years before that would happen. No, this would 
be a posthumous adventure, set before Holmes’s fateful encounter with 
Professor Moriarty. Needless to say, the public welcomed this story with 
open arms.
Sherlock Holmes’s unlikely rebirth
By 1903 much had changed for Arthur Conan Doyle. In the 12 years since 
Sherlock Holmes first appeared in The Strand Magazine, the struggling doctor 
with literary aspirations had become a wealthy full-time author. He had taken 
a wife, Louise, and they now had two children (see “His marriages” later in 
the chapter for more on his personal life). The ten years following his decision 
to kill off Holmes had given him the chance to write on an impressive array of 
subjects: ghost stories, adventure stories, nonfiction essays, and the historical 
fiction he so dearly wanted to write.
Age and time had helped soften his feelings toward Sherlock Holmes. It’s 
a common myth that Doyle hated Holmes. This is untrue. He did, after all, 
create the character. What he hated was the level of popularity Holmes 
received, which, in his opinion, obscured his other writing. Now, finding 
himself in a different place in life, he was ready to revisit Sherlock.
Finally, in 1903, after ten years of public pressure, Doyle revealed the 
astounding news that Sherlock Holmes was alive! In “The Empty House,” 
Holmes returns to England in disguise and reveals himself to Dr. Watson. The 
story is set in 1894, three years after his presumed death. Holmes explains 
away the “evidence” Watson found at Reichenbach Falls, tells how he faked 
his death, traveled around the world, and finally returned to London to catch 
the last of Moriarty’s gang.
Some readers may have found Holmes’s explanation a bit farfetched, but no 
one cared. “It was indeed like old times,” wrote Watson, “when, at that hour, 
I found myself seated beside him in a hansom, my revolver in my pocket and 
the thrill of adventure in my heart.”

60
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
Other Literary Endeavors
Doyle was a prolific writer, and the depth and breadth of his writing over his 
lifetime is staggering. He wrote short stories, novels, and plays. He wrote in 
a variety of genres, including romance, science fiction, mystery, horror, and 
adventure. He was a poet and a playwright. He wrote a history of World War 
I (as it was happening). He was a journalist, a propagandist, and an advocate 
for justice. And he continued to write Sherlock Holmes stories. Although a 
complete overview of his work is impossible here, I highlight a few of his best 
non-Sherlockian works in the following sections.
Brigadier Gerard
Following the supposed death of Holmes, Doyle created a new recurring 
character in a series of comic short stories, Etienne Gerard, a soldier in the 
French Army during the Napoleonic Wars. Gerard is very brave, very vain, 
and not always the sharpest tool in the box. This combination puts him 
in some very entertaining situations. (It turns out that Doyle could write 
comedy!)
Originally published in The Strand Magazine, the Brigadier Gerard stories 
appeared between 1894 and 1903 and were later collected into two books, 
The Exploits of Brigadier Gerard (1896) and The Adventures of Gerard (1903). 
A final story was published in 1910, entitled “The Marriage of the Brigadier.”
The Lost World
Even without Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would be remembered 
today for his science fiction masterpiece, The Lost World. The novel tells the 
story of Professor George Challenger, a brilliant but unorthodox scientist 
who claims to have discovered living dinosaurs on an isolated plateau in 
an unexplored region of South America. Fascinated by recent discoveries 
of dinosaur fossils near his home, Doyle placed his story deep within the 
Brazilian rain forest and sent Challenger and a band of fellow explorers up 
the Amazon River in search of this lost world.
Doyle based his characters on several real-life explorers: Everard Im Thurn, 
J. W. Boddam-Whethem, Roger Casement, and P. H. Fawcet, who, during 
expeditions through unexplored Amazonian jungles, reported remote, isolated 
plateaus exactly like Doyle describes in The Lost World. He also relied on 
state-of-the-art Edwardian paleontology, citing a real-life book by scientist 
Edwin Ray Lankester titled Extinct Animals.

61
 Chapter 3: Arthur Conan Doyle: The Doctor Who Created the Detective
Doyle loved the character of Professor Challenger and brought him back in 
two novels (The Poison Belt in 1913 and The Land of Mist in 1926) and two 
short stories (“When the World Screamed” in 1928 and “The Disintegration 
Machine” in 1929). He never tired of his brilliant scientist, as he did with 
Sherlock Holmes. In fact, he loved Challenger enough to convert him to 
spiritualism in The Land of Mist.
 
The influence of The Lost World can’t be overstated. In 1925 the book was 
adapted as a silent movie (it came right at the end of the silent era). The great 
Willis O’Brien did the special stop-motion dinosaur effects. Doyle himself 
loved the effects and the film. O’Brien went on to make King Kong just a few 
years later. It’s clear now that Kong is merely a remake of The Lost World. In 
fact, every living dinosaur movie made in its wake, right up through Jurassic 
Park, owes a nod to The Lost World.
The White Company
Doyle always believed his true calling was writing historical fiction. The 
White Company (1891) is by far his most popular and best-known work in 
this field. It’s set during the Hundred Years’ War. After attending a lecture 
on the Middle Ages, Doyle began detailed research into his tale, which tells 
the exciting story of Alleyne Edricson and his band of knights known as the 
White Company.
Life Outside of Literature
No doubt about it . . . Arthur Conan Doyle will always be remembered 
primarily for Sherlock Holmes. This probably would have both astounded 
and disappointed him. He not only left us with an amazing and varied body 
of writing but also led an amazing and varied life.
His marriages
In 1885, Doyle married Louise Hawkins (nicknamed “Touie”). Their marriage 
produced two children, Mary and Kingsley, and was a happy one until the 
summer of 1893, when Louise was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis 
is an often deadly infectious disease that attacks the lungs and, in a time 
before antibiotics, was usually a death sentence. Arthur was devastated. “I 
am afraid we must reconcile ourselves to the diagnosis,” wrote Doyle in a 
letter to his mother. Louise lived another 13 years, but it was the restricted 
life of a live-in patient.

62
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
During the years of Louise’s illness, Doyle channeled his energy and feelings 
into travel, sports, writing, and any number of other activities, almost 
certainly as a coping mechanism. And then, in March 1897, he met a young, 
strikingly beautiful woman named Jean Leckie and fell madly in love. Despite 
his wife being an invalid, and being in love with another woman, it’s believed 
that Doyle remained faithful to Louise, living a celibate life until her death on 
July 4, 1906.
A little over a year later, on September 18, 1907, Arthur and Jean Leckie 
were married in a large, public wedding. The two remained devoted to each 
other for the rest of their lives. The new Mr. and Mrs. Conan Doyle moved 
to Sussex, to a new home they called Windlesham, and had three children 
together. The first was a boy named Denis, who was born in 1909. Then came 
Adrian in 1910, and finally a girl named Jean in 1912.
Hitting the road
Throughout his life, Doyle loved to travel. Sometimes he traveled for pleasure; 
other times it was to lecture on literature or, later, spiritualism. But whatever 
the reason, his far-flung travels gave him an appreciation for the larger world 
and new raw material for his writing. Some of his more significant journeys 
include
 
✓ Switzerland (1893): Doyle took his family to Switzerland in hopes that 
the air would help his wife’s tuberculosis. While there, he visited the 
Reichenbach Falls and decided that it would be the place he would 
kill off Sherlock Holmes. (For more info, see the earlier section “Killed 
Holmes!”)
 
✓ United States (1894): The now famous author took a lecture tour of 
the United States, visiting many cities, including New York, Cincinnati, 
Indianapolis, and Chicago. While Doyle hoped to lecture on non-Sherlockian 
subjects, he couldn’t escape questions about Sherlock Holmes.
 
✓ Egypt (1895): The Doyle family cruised up the Nile and visited the 
Pyramids. The adventure provided vivid material for one of Doyle’s most 
under-appreciated adventure novels, A Desert Drama, Being the Tragedy 
of the Korosko.
 
✓ South Africa (1900): Doyle volunteered as field doctor during the Boer 
War. (See the next section for more information.)
 
✓ United States and Canada (1914, 1922–1923): By this stage of his life, 
Doyle was the world’s leading advocate of spiritualism. He toured 
extensively promoting his faith.

Patriotism and public service
In 1899, war broke out in South Africa between Britain and Dutch settlers 
(known as Boers) over colonization. It was a long, bloody war, but it appealed 
both to Doyle’s sense of adventure and his patriotism. In 1900, he volunteered 
as a medical doctor behind the lines. During his time in Africa, he saw as 
many soldiers die of infectious disease as war wounds and campaigned for 
better aseptic methods in field hospitals.
Upon his return he wrote an account of the conflict entitled The Great Boer 
War. He also vigorously defended the honor of the British soldier against 
charges of war crimes. The following year, in recognition of his services to 
the Crown during the Boer War, King Edward VII knighted Doyle. The 
creator of Sherlock Holmes was now Sir Arthur. (It was rumored that the 
king was also unofficially thanking Doyle for reviving Holmes. Edward VII 
was a Sherlock Holmes fan.)
He really is Sherlock Holmes!
Dr. Joseph Bell, who taught Doyle the Sherlockian method, once told him, 
“You are yourself Sherlock Holmes and well you know it.” It turns out that 
he was right. On two occasions, Doyle successfully undertook criminal 
investigations to free wrongly accused men. In both cases, he employed the 
methods of Sherlock Holmes.
The George Edalji case
In 1907, Doyle met a young man named George Edalji who had been convicted 
of a series of cattle and horse mutilation incidents in the village of Great 
Wyrley.
Edalji was a Parsee Indian. For years, both George and his family had endured 
hateful and threatening anonymous letters. Then things took a turn for the 
worse. In 1893, farm animals in the area were being mutilated in the middle 
of the night. The animals bled to death from long, shallow cuts to their 
abdomens. Then an anonymous letter to the police named George Edalji as 
the perpetrator. Edalji was arrested and charged not only with the cattle 
mutilations but also with writing the threatening letters to himself! He was 
sentenced to seven years’ hard labor.
Many were convinced that this was a clear miscarriage of justice. When 
10,000 people signed a petition protesting the sentence, Edalji’s sentence was 
reduced to three years. After his early release, Edalji sought to clear his name 

64
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
and contacted Arthur Conan Doyle. Doyle decided to look into the case. What 
he found was overwhelming. He was convinced that Edalji was innocent and 
that racial prejudice had played a part in his conviction.
Upon meeting him, Sir Arthur knew he was innocent. As he reported in his 
book The Case of Mr. George Edalji, the accused man’s eyesight was so bad 
that it would have been impossible for him to have done it:
He had come to my hotel by appointment, but I had been delayed, and 
he was passing the time by reading the paper. I recognized my man by 
his dark face, so I stood and observed him. He held the paper close to his 
eyes and rather sideways, proving not only a high degree of myopia, but 
marked astigmatism. The idea of such a man scouring fields at night and 
assaulting cattle while avoiding the watching police was ludicrous. There, 
in a single physical defect, lay the moral certainty of his innocence.
All the evidence against Edalji fell apart. Blood on razors found in Edalji’s 
home turned out to be rust. Mud on his boots was soil that was different from 
the soil from the field where the mutilations occurred. A handwriting expert 
demonstrated that he wasn’t the author of the anonymous letters. Animal 
mutilations continued after Edalji was arrested! And most of all, George Edalji 
was certainly legally blind.
Doyle outlined the results of his investigation in a series of newspaper 
articles. They caused enough pressure that in the spring of 1907, a judicial 
committee reversed the conviction on the mutilations. (However, they 
maintained his guilt in the letter-writing conviction.)
 
The George Edalji case, a real-life mystery with the creator of Sherlock Holmes 
investigating the crimes, still fascinates. In 2006, award-winning novelist Julian 
Barnes wrote the best-selling novel Arthur and George, which offers a fascinating 
psychological examination of the case.
The Case of Oscar Slater
On the morning of December 21, 1908, in Glasgow, Scotland, an elderly 
woman named Marion Gilchrist was found bludgeoned to death. She was 
discovered by her servant girl, Helen Lambie, who had briefly gone out to 
buy a newspaper. While Lambie was out, a man named Arthur Adams, who 
lived in the apartment below Gilchrist, heard three knocks on his ceiling and, 
knowing his upstairs neighbor was elderly, went to investigate.
The door was locked, but he met Helen Lambie, who had just returned from 
her errand. While outside Gilchrist’s door they noticed a strange man in the 
building’s hallway, but the man left, and they had no reason of suspecting 
him of being anything other than another tenant in the building. Upon entering 
they discovered the body and that a diamond brooch had been stolen.

65
 Chapter 3: Arthur Conan Doyle: The Doctor Who Created the Detective
The police fixed on a petty criminal named Oscar Slater. Two pieces of evidence 
raised a red flag. Slater had recently pawned a diamond brooch and had just 
set sail for America under a false name. When authorities caught up to Slater, 
he was immediately willing to return to Scotland to clear his name.
Once back in Scotland, it was shown that the pawned brooch didn’t match 
the stolen brooch. He also had an alibi for the time of the murder. Despite 
this, the police were convinced he was the culprit, and a trial was held in 
1909. Oscar Slater was found guilty and sentenced to death. Two days before 
his execution, his sentence was commuted to life with hard labor.
When Doyle reviewed the case, he was convinced that Slater was innocent. 
He published The Case of Oscar Slater, which methodically examined the 
evidence. The Case of Oscar Slater sparked demand for a new trial, but the 
fight for Slater’s innocence went on for years. Finally, in 1927, the secretary of 
state issued the following statement:
Oscar Slater has now completed more than eighteen and a half years 
of his life sentence, and I have felt justified in deciding to authorize his 
release on license as soon as suitable arrangements can be made.
Oscar Slater was finally a free man. He was awarded £6,000 and cleared of all 
charges.
The First World War
When World War I started in August 1914, Arthur Conan Doyle, at 55 years 
old, was too old to fight, so instead he decided to write an account of the 
war. The British Campaign in France and Flanders ended up being six volumes 
long and was written while the war was still being waged. During a visit to the 
front lines, he was asked if Sherlock Holmes was fighting. Doyle replied that 
Holmes was retired and too old for military service!
The First World War devastated an entire generation of young men in 
England and France. The Doyle family shared in this loss. Sir Arthur lost his 
oldest son Kingsley, as well as his brother, his two brothers-in-law, and two 
nephews. The grief he felt at these losses helped turn Doyle’s curious interest 
in spiritualism into a passion.
Speaking with the dead
Many have understandably wondered how the man who created the ultimate 
scientific thinker could have come to believe in spiritualism, a religion 

66
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
focused on communication with the spirits of the dead. Spiritualists believe 
that life after death is not only true but also provable, and that the living can 
communicate with those who’ve died. Had Doyle lost his mind?
Spiritualism began in 1848 in Hydesville, New York, when two sisters named 
Maggie and Katie Fox claimed to be communicating with the ghost of a 
murdered man who was buried in their cellar. In less than a decade, nearly 
2 million people had become spiritualists. Between 1900 and 1914, the 
movement’s popularity began to fade, but then, with the horrific number of 
deaths in World War I, millions flocked to the faith as a way to cope with the 
loss of so many loved ones. Arthur Conan Doyle was one of them.
The key to understanding Doyle’s conversion is his analytical mind. That 
may seem strange, because spiritualism deals in mediums, séances, and 
other spooky but seemingly faked elements. But spiritualism appealed to 
Doyle because, to him, it offered proof of life after death. What could be more 
convincing to a man trained in science than to actually communicate with 
the dead? That’s the secret to understanding his passionate adoption of this 
seemingly illogical faith.
When Doyle took up a cause, he did it with all he had, whether it was fighting 
to clear a man’s name, upholding the honor of England against false charges, 
or spreading the word of the “new revelation” of spiritualism. It became the 
defining cause of the last 15 years of his life.
He became a regular participant in séances, joined the British Society for 
Psychical Research, and opened a store called the Psychic Bookshop. He 
wrote numerous books, articles, and essays advancing the cause. He engaged 
in a series of high-profile debates with skeptics (often coming out on top) and 
traveled the world promoting the faith he so strongly believed in.
It wasn’t all clear sailing, however. Occasionally, his zeal blinded him to the 
undeniable fakers and charlatans that were making names for themselves. 
Unfortunately, because Doyle was such a public figure, these blunders often 
became public embarrassments. The two best known examples involve the 
Cottingly fairies and a very public feud with illusionist Harry Houdini.
The Cottingly fairies
In 1920, two young girls from the village of Cottingley took, in the woods near 
their home, photographs that purported to show fairies. A story was published 
in The Strand Magazine about the pictures, and Doyle decided to investigate.
When experts stated that the negatives hadn’t been tampered with and the 
photos were genuine, Doyle very publicly threw his support behind the 
photographs by writing a book, The Coming of the Fairies. He just couldn’t 
believe that children could perpetrate a fraud of this kind. Unfortunately, 
they were indeed capable and admitted the fraud years later, after Doyle’s 
death. Nothing damaged Doyle’s reputation as much as the Cottingly fairies.

67
 Chapter 3: Arthur Conan Doyle: The Doctor Who Created the Detective
Harry Houdini versus Jean Conan Doyle
Harry Houdini, the world’s greatest escape artist, and Arthur Conan Doyle 
were unlikely friends, but they found common ground in an interest in 
spiritualism. After the death of his mother, Houdini hoped to contact her 
using mediums. But he was a magician, and he soon found that the psychics 
he was consulting were frauds. From then on he was on a crusade to expose 
these charlatans.
The Doyle/Houdini friendship ended in 1922, when Doyle’s wife Jean, who 
had adopted spiritualism and who specialized in automatic writing, offered 
to help contact Houdini’s mother. Unfortunately, it didn’t go well. Jean wrote 
down messages she was supposedly receiving from Houdini’s mother, but 
when the writing was in English (she didn’t speak English), made no mention 
that it was his mother’s birthday, and used a Christian cross drawn on the 
top of the page (Houdini was Jewish), Houdini was insulted. The disagreement 
went public and proved to be another embarrassment for Doyle.
 
Spiritualists believe that messages from the spirits of the dead can come 
to us from the other side. One of these forms of communication is “automatic 
writing,” where the writer enters a trance and unconsciously transcribes 
messages from a communicating spirit.
His Last Bow
Doctor, author, sportsman, patriot, journalist, amateur detective, historian, 
scientist, adventurer, husband, father, religious advocate. All these titles, and 
more, are applicable to Arthur Conan Doyle. With this list in mind, he might 
cringe to know that he’ll always be best remembered for the creation of 
Sherlock Holmes. But he should be proud. No other author has ever created 
a character that transcended the boundary of the printed page to become, in 
the mind of the public, a living person. It’s been said that an artist isn’t the 
best judge of his own work, and certainly this is the case with Arthur Conan 
Doyle.
After an amazing life of adventure and accomplishment, Doyle died on 
Monday, July 7, 1930. He is buried at Windlesham, and his tombstone reads, 
“Steel True, Blade Straight.”

▶ The rise of the early detectives
▶ Communication and transportation in Holmes’s time
S
herlock Holmes has been a popular character for well over 100 years. 
His adventures have never been out of print. Radio, film, and television 
adaptations have kept him fresh for each new generation, and yet Holmes 
will always be firmly rooted in Great Britain’s late-Victorian era. Because 
England in the 19th century was, in many ways, quite a different place than 
the modern, 21st-century world, it’s helpful to understand the culture that 
Holmes lived and worked in and how it shaped him.
England, the Center of the World
At its peak, the British Empire was the largest empire the world had ever 
known. It was said that “the sun never sets on the British Empire,” and while 
this statement may sound like bragging, it was true. At the height of its 
power, the British Empire ruled over 450 million people around the globe. 
That worked out to one-quarter of the entire world’s population, and covered 
one-quarter of the planet!
Britain was a world power long before Sherlock Holmes was born (1854). 
But by the time Holmes appeared, the empire’s influence and power were 
so great that many began to take for granted that the empire was not only 
indestructible but also naturally superior.

70
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
The white man’s burden — as they saw it
Take up the White Man’s burden —
The savage wars of peace —
Fill full the mouth of Famine
And bid the sickness cease
Perhaps the best example of how the British understood their empire, 
including its rights and responsibilities, can be found in Rudyard Kipling’s 
poem “The White Man’s Burden.” Written for Queen Victoria in 1899, the 
poem was both a justification for the empire and a statement of its costs. It 
sought to cast the British Empire as a noble cause, as shown in the few lines 
quoted earlier.
To the average Englishman of Arthur Conan Doyle’s time, the empire 
represented the very foundation of civilization itself. The Royal Navy ruled 
the seas, and English commercial vessels plied their trade in all the ports of the 
world. The most powerful factors driving the British Empire, especially in the 
late 19th century, were trade and religion.
Colonization brought trade and fueled a rising tide of prosperity. The rise of 
the empire and the growth of trade went hand in hand. The rapid expansion of 
overseas colonies brought an increased demand for manufactured goods to 
be shipped from England throughout its empire. On the flip side, the opening 
of trade routes from the colonies to England brought back a dizzying array of 
natural resources to England. Sugar, tobacco, rice, rubber, and other materials, 
never before available, now flowed in, fueling a new economy of merchants 
and manufacturers. They then sold their wares at home and exported to the 
far-flung reaches of the empire. It was a symbiotic relationship.
All this required a strong military to preserve and defend these valuable 
assets. The global reach of the empire imposed a long period of relative 
peace. In an age in which Darwin’s theory of survival of the fittest gained 
widespread acceptance, the very fact of the power and reach of the British 
Empire instilled a feeling of cultural superiority among its citizens.
It was also a time when the British public enthusiastically supported 
Christian missionary work around the world. For instance, Anglican churches 
sprang up throughout India, fulfilling what many felt was the proper role of 
the British Empire — the spreading of British culture and religion to India’s 
masses, and proclaiming the Gospel of Christ to the “heathens.” While not 
officially supported by the English government, missionary work was a vital 
component in the spread of the British Empire because it helped to instill 
some degree of uniformity in language and cultural identity.

71
 Chapter 4: Life in the Days of London Fog
 
It’s easy to see colonialism and empire-building as exploitative and oppressive 
enterprises (even some British believed this to be true), and it’s undeniable 
that in some cases, this was so. But that’s a modern understanding. At the 
time, the average Englishman had a much different view; power, wealth, and 
civilization imparted a moral obligation to export their culture to poorer, “less 
civilized” people. Misguided? In many cases, yes. But done with evil intent? 
Not always.
The Sherlock tales: Spanning two eras
The majority of the Sherlock Holmes stories were written in a time that’s 
now known as the Victorian era, which spans the reign of Queen Victoria. 
A brief history of British empire-building
England wasn’t the first European nation to 
embark on the path of empire-building. That 
distinction belongs to Spain and Portugal. It was 
during the 15th and 16th centuries that these 
two powers kicked off the Age of Discovery, 
which led to global exploration, the creation of 
profitable trade routes and overseas colonies, 
and ultimately, large empires.
England was actually rather late to the party. It 
didn’t start down this road until the early 17th 
century. Before then, England was a typical 
European nation that either formed alliances 
with its continental neighbors or fought them 
in wars. But when England (along with France) 
established colonies in America and Asia, it 
also established lucrative trade routes, and a 
global empire began to form. Even the loss of 
the American colonies was only a temporary 
setback, as victory in the Napoleonic Wars with 
France turned Britain toward Africa, India, and 
other areas of the world. As England entered 
the Victorian age, its powerful navy, medical 
advances, and new communication technology 
helped grow the empire even more.
English territory around the world fell into 
several different categories. The British 
government directly controlled some territories, 
and British-run companies controlled others, 
but all fell under the rule of British law:
 ✓ Colonies: These were territories that 
the British government ruled directly. 
Appointed governors who had broad 
powers ran the colonies. These were the 
most common form of foreign territory in 
the British Empire.
 ✓ Company rule: These were regions run by 
private British companies for commercial 
trading.
 ✓ Protectorates: These were territories 
where local government continued ruling 
but gave a degree of allegiance to the 
British government.
 ✓ Dominions: These colonies had a large 
degree of self-rule. Canada, Australia, and 
New Zealand are examples of dominions to 
this day.

72
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
Victoria’s reign was a long one, lasting from 1837 to 1901 — nearly 64 years! 
Her reign saw the British Empire grow, and this brought peace and prosperity 
to Britain. The Industrial Revolution began on her watch as well, creating a 
large, literate middle class — exactly the readership that embraced Holmes 
in The Strand Magazine. The Victorian era is generally cited as the beginning 
of the modern age.
 
Victoria wasn’t only the queen of England; she was also the ruler of Scotland, 
Wales, and Ireland, as well as the Empress of India. Her actual full (and long) 
title was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, and the first Empress 
of India of the British Raj.
Though the Holmes tales began in the late-Victorian era, Doyle was still 
writing them well after Victoria’s reign ended. In 1901, Victoria’s son 
Edward VII succeeded her to the throne. Historians refer to his reign as the 
Edwardian era. Even though Edward died in 1910, the Edwardian era lasted 
until 1914, with the outbreak of World War I.
The Edwardian era was definitely influenced by King Edward himself. His 
mother had been reserved and even a bit repressed, but Edward openly 
enjoyed life, indulging in art, fashion, travel, and many romances. During the 
Edwardian era, the English class system was still in place, but changes in 
both economics and society were afoot. Many social and political movements 
became prominent during this time, including women’s suffrage, socialism, 
and upward mobility within the classes.
It was an age of change — more modern, more progressive, and in some 
cases, more coarse. The Holmes adventures that Doyle wrote during the 
Edwardian era tend to be more violent and often deal with sexual and social 
themes that would have been unheard of back in the 1890s.
London, the Heart of Empire
Watson called London “that great cesspool into which all the loungers and 
idlers of the empire are irresistibly drained.” Holmes called it a place where 
“four million human beings [are] all jostling each other within the space of a 
few square miles.”
To the people of Holmes’s time, London wasn’t a city — London was The City, 
period. If Britannia ruled the waves that washed the shores of the perpetually 
sunlit empire, then London ruled Britannia.
Of course, London was the center of government, but it was much, much 
more than just a bureaucratic or political center — it was the heart of the 
nation. The Thames River flows right through the center of the city, making it 
a commercial center as well, importing and exporting the wares of the world.

73
 Chapter 4: Life in the Days of London Fog
A cosmopolitan environment
Victorian London, the center of global power that was the British Empire, 
was composed of many races, nationalities, religions, and classes. 
Immigrants from around the world gravitated to London from the far-flung 
reaches of the empire. As in modern times, immigrants tended to gather into 
their own ethnic communities. For instance, in east London you would find a 
Jewish ghetto, made up of people who fled the czar’s persecutions in Russia, 
as well as an Irish ghetto. An area called Saffron Hill was mainly Italian.
In London’s kaleidoscope of people you could find Welsh, Germans, Indians, 
Chinese, and Africans, all contributing to the cosmopolitan nature of the 
London of Sherlock Holmes. The canon reflects not only the diversity 
of London, but the British Empire as well:
 
✓ “The Man with the Twisted Lip”: This story begins with Holmes going 
undercover in a Chinese opium den located near the river.
 
✓ “The Greek Interpreter”: The victim in this tale is a Greek immigrant 
who makes his living as an interpreter for the government and for new 
immigrants to London.
 
✓ “The Six Napoleons”: This adventure takes Holmes and Watson deep 
into the Italian immigrant community as they track a stolen pearl.
While undoubtedly a man of his time, Doyle had a more advanced attitude 
than many of his contemporaries when it came to other people and different 
races. For example, in “The Yellow Face,” he has Holmes display a positively 
enlightened attitude toward interracial marriage. At the end of the story, 
when it’s discovered that Holmes’s client has a biracial child from a previous 
marriage to an African American, both Holmes and Watson are charmed by 
the child and cast no judgment on the woman. Her husband proves himself a 
good man as well, but only after ten long minutes of silence.
However, the canon also undoubtedly reflects the cultural tensions of both 
London as a worldwide melting pot and the British Empire. For example, 
numerous stories are tinged with tragedy resulting from England’s rule in 
India. The entire plot of The Sign of the Four is driven by a back story of greed 
and murder during the Indian Mutiny of 1857, a rebellion against Britain’s 
occupation of India. The most tragic tale of them all, “The Creeping Man,” is 
also set against the backdrop of Britain’s military conquest of India. Holmes 
encounters numerous characters who’ve been permanently wounded by 
foreign occupation and war. (Watson himself is permanently scarred in the 
shoulder and leg from his involvement in the Second Afghan War). And don’t 
forget that, in a nation with a long history of political distrust and religious 
discrimination for their Irish neighbors, the greatest criminal of all, Professor 
Moriarty, has an Irish name.

74
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
How classy are you? Social status
Victorian England was an extremely class-conscious society with very 
low social mobility. In early Victorian society, people had little opportunity 
to move up the social ladder. (Moving down was always a possibility, 
should financial disaster strike.) However, by Holmes’s time, increased 
industrialization, capitalists, a growing skilled labor force, trade unions, and 
political pressure from socialists began to put cracks in the class system.
The rungs on the social ladder were as follows:
 
✓ Upper class: This included royalty, as well as the landed aristocracy 
(meaning landowners). The aristocracy were usually born into their 
positions, but when the Industrial Revolution began, many gained 
positions in society through wealth. An example of the aristocracy in 
the canon is Lord Robert St. Simon from “The Noble Bachelor.”
 
✓ Middle class: The Victorian middle class appeared with the growth 
of the economy. Businessmen, manufacturers, small entrepreneurs, 
shopkeepers, and merchants are examples of the middle class. In “The 
Red-Headed League,” pawnbroker Jabez Wilson “bore every mark of 
being an average, commonplace British tradesman” and was a perfect 
example of the middle class.
 
✓ Working class: Members of the working class were physical laborers. 
Men were unskilled, and women were often servants in upper-class 
households. Even children worked, which eventually triggered child 
labor laws to curb abuses and slave-like conditions. Working-class living 
conditions were usually overcrowded, with no gas or sewage systems, 
and few had opportunities for education. A good example of the working 
class in the canon is the cleaning lady from “The Naval Treaty” who is 
suspected of stealing a document.
 
For Sherlock Holmes, the social order is something to be both upheld and 
defied. On one hand, his bohemian nature rebels at class distinction and 
privilege, while on the other hand he takes extreme measures to rescue the 
aristocracy from scandal. Sherlock tends to be more polite to the lower and 
middle class than those in the upper classes. In “The Blue Carbuncle,” Holmes 
shows mercy to James Ryder, a member of the poor working class, even after 
he steals a precious jewel. On the other hand, Holmes treats a king (“A Scandal 
in Bohemia”) with barely concealed contempt, knowing that he has treated a 
woman wrongly. His disdain for wrongdoing knows no class distinction.

75
 Chapter 4: Life in the Days of London Fog
Living conditions
Just like today, the difference between how the rich lived and how the poor 
lived was striking, only the gap was even greater than it is now. The rich 
upper class lived in fashionable west London (the “West End”), in homes with 
servants and gaslight. The canon has numerous examples of the upper class, 
but a particularly good example of their life can be found in “The Empty 
House,” where the young Ronald Adair is murdered in the bedroom of his 
family’s Park Lane home. Holmes’s lifestyle and residence on Baker Street 
was solidly middle class, even after he had prospered financially in later 
years.
The poorest of the poor lived in conditions scarcely imaginable by today’s 
standards. In the East End, poverty, drink, and overcrowding led to disease, 
prostitution, and homelessness. Some unfortunates were so utterly destitute 
that they squeezed out a living combing the mud and muck along the 
riverbank for anything that could be sold or salvaged. Holmes’s Baker Street 
Irregulars are perfect examples of children caught in the cycle of extreme 
poverty. Watson describes them as a dozen barefoot, dirty, “ragged little 
street Arabs.”
The problem with pollution
London was one of the most populous cities of its time — and perhaps the 
single most polluted. In addition to being a government and commercial 
nexus, it was also the home of the vast majority of the nation’s factories. In 
the early days of the industrial society, little if any thought was given to 
pollution control or effects on the environment.
The streets were covered with horse manure. The Thames River was a 
convenient dumping place for everything from raw sewage to manufacturing 
waste to the latest murder victim’s body. The air, fed by the smokestacks of 
countless factories, was so bad that, on a bad day, it was nearly unbreathable. In 
fact, the famous London fog was really nothing more than smog. In modern, 
pollution-conscious London, London fog is a thing of the past.

76
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
Keeping in Touch
Without cell phones, e-mail, Twitter, text messages, or any of the other 
communication methods we take for granted, you may think that Victorian 
Englishmen had real difficulty staying in touch. But in reality, they did pretty 
well, and had a variety of ways to send a message.
 
✓ Personal messengers: The fastest way to send a message for immediate 
delivery was by personal messenger. The messenger often was from 
a delivery service and was known as a commissionaire. Commissionaires 
were usually retired military men who worked as uniformed attendants 
or messengers, or did other duties as needed. Peterson, from “The Blue 
Carbuncle,” is a commissionaire.
 
✓ Postal service: Within London, mailing a letter was actually a pretty fast 
way of sending a message. The Victorian postal system delivered mail an 
astounding seven times a day!
 
✓ Telegrams: The telegraph was the most widely used method for sending 
important messages over large distances in Victorian England. When 
you needed to know something right away, you wouldn’t wait days 
for a letter to be carried to a correspondent, then days for a response 
to arrive. Instead, you paid for a timely delivery and an immediate 
response. Sherlock Holmes, however, used the telegraph even for short 
distances. Watson says that Holmes “never wrote a letter when a 
telegram would suffice.”
 
✓ Telephones: Even though London’s first public telephone exchange 
was opened in 1879, large scale telephone use didn’t happen until the 
early 1900s. Affordable and widespread service across the nation didn’t 
occur until 1912. Holmes wasn’t an early adopter of the telephone, but it 
does start appearing in the canon relatively early. The telephone shows 
up in the 1890 novel The Sign of the Four, when Inspector Athelney 
Jones offers to step across the street and make a call from the public 
phone bank on Baker Street to get a boat. Ironically, he had come to see 
Holmes in response to his telegram! 
 
 The first evidence of Holmes using a telephone doesn’t occur until 1924, 
in the story “The Illustrious Client” (see Figure 4-1). Although he doesn’t 
actually use the phone in the story, he shows Watson a message he has 
received that asks him to confirm an appointment with a telephone call.
 
 Finally, in the 1926 story “The Retired Colourman,” there is definitive 
evidence of 221b Baker Street getting a telephone. “Thanks to the 
telephone and the help of the Yard,” says Holmes, “I can usually get my 
essentials without leaving this room.”

From Peelers to the First Detectives: 
The Rise of Scotland Yard
According to the book A History of Police in England, “at the beginning of the 
nineteenth century . . . in no department were ignorance, corruption, and 
inefficiency so pronounced as in that of [the] police.” Low pay, poor training, 
and the overwhelming nature of crime, particularly in the poorer areas of 
London, made keeping order difficult and made officers vulnerable to 
corruption, bribes, and graft.
Many areas of London were dangerous, especially after dark. (A good 
illustration in the canon is in “The Man with the Twisted Lip,” where the 
respectable, upper-middle-class woman accidentally finds herself in a bad 
neighborhood.) The city took some measures to increase public safety, 
like installing gaslights to make streets safer for walking, but most people 
continued to rely on their own measures to stay safe. Finally, the need for a 
professional police force could no longer be ignored.

78
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
The first modern police department
The Metropolitan Police Force was created in 1829. The creation of the new 
police force took an act of Parliament, which was introduced by Sir Robert 
Peel. Soon afterwards, the newly minted police officers were nicknamed 
peelers or bobbies in his honor. While the term peelers isn’t used much today, 
London police officers are still known as bobbies.
The first police offices were located in a private house on a courtyard called 
the Great Scotland Yard. It didn’t take long for the entire police force to get 
the name Scotland Yard. Over time, Scotland Yard became the prototype for 
modern police departments the world over.
Prior to the advent of Scotland Yard, police in London had been a confusing 
hodgepodge of local officers who gained their authority from a variety of 
sources. Scotland Yard brought them all together into a single administrative 
unit. The only exception was the City of London police, who continued to 
operate as an independent group, the same situation you have in most urban 
areas today.
 
The old building isn’t used anymore. The Metropolitan Police, since 1890, 
have been in a newer one called — you guessed it — New Scotland Yard.
Bobbies, constables, and inspectors: 
A who’s who of crime fighters
All police operating out of Scotland Yard were technically constables — 
meaning that they were government officials who had the power of making an 
arrest — although the term was usually only applied to the uniformed street 
patrols. The inspectors, however, were the elite of the new police force. They 
were the plainclothes detectives who were called upon to use their brains 
rather than their brawn.
Holmes rarely deals with constables, but instead works with the official 
detectives, the inspectors. Inspector Lestrade is Holmes’s most familiar 
Scotland Yard colleague, but he also worked regularly with Inspector Tobias 
Gregson and Inspector Stanley Hopkins.
“The Second Stain” provides good examples of constables on the scene. It 
was Constable Barrett who, while passing along Godolphin Street, observed 
an open door and discovered a dead body. And later in the same story, it was 
Constable MacPherson who was tricked into letting someone see the crime 
scene.

79
 Chapter 4: Life in the Days of London Fog
Early in the canon, the Scotland Yarders are portrayed as incompetent 
buffoons, jealous of Holmes’s success, suspicious or contemptuous of his 
methods, and at times openly hostile. As for Holmes, the contempt was 
mutual. But then, art begins to mirror life. As the years pass, and the real-
life detectives of Scotland Yard gain a reputation as a leading crime-fighting 
force, Holmes and the professionals start sharing a mutual respect for each 
other. The transformation is complete when Lestrade tells Holmes the 
following at the conclusion of “The Six Napoleons”:
“Well, I’ve seen you handle a good many cases, Mr. Holmes, but I don’t 
know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than that. We’re not 
jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are very proud of you, and if 
you come down to-morrow, there’s not a man, from the oldest inspector to 
the youngest constable, who wouldn’t be glad to shake you by the hand.”
Holmes Gets Around
When not moping around his rooms in a funk, Sherlock Holmes can be a 
very active man. Whether he’s on a case, heading out to hear a concert at 
St. James’s Hall, or visiting Cox and Company (his bank) to do a little 
banking, Holmes had to get from one place to another. In Victorian England, 
that usually meant either by horsepower or steam locomotives.
The original taxi: Horses and hansom cabs
Although mechanical forms of transportation were beginning to change the 
face of Victorian society during the time of the Sherlock Holmes stories, 
the horse was still the main source of power for most people. The earliest 
automobiles weren’t much more than very expensive toys (Doyle bought 
himself one) and the British highway system left a great deal to be desired 
when it came to motoring.
Automobiles don’t appear in the stories until “His Last Bow,” which is set 
in 1914. Here Watson chauffeurs Holmes in a small Ford. But otherwise, the 
canon contains a wide variety of horse-drawn vehicles, and Holmes’s fans 
have to wade their way through such odd designations as dogcarts, gigs, 
wagonettes, broughams, and four-wheelers, among others:
 
✓ Dogcart (also known as a gig): This is a light cart, drawn by a single 
horse, with two seats placed back to back. A box under the rear seat 
was used for carrying dogs, giving the vehicle its unique name.

80
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
 
✓ Bus (full name is omnibus): Just like now, this was cheap public 
transportation. A bus is a long-bodied enclosed carriage with seats 
along the sides. It was drawn by two horses and ran on regular routes 
throughout the city, just like city busses do now.
 
✓ Wagonette: This is a four-wheeled open carriage with two seats facing 
each other. It was drawn by two horses.
 
✓ Brougham: Named after a British statesman named Lord Henry 
Brougham, this single-seat carriage was closed and pulled by a single 
horse.
 
✓ Four-wheeler (also known as a growler): This is an enclosed, four-
wheeled cab. It was pulled by a single horse and was primarily used in 
cities, like London. To summon a four-wheeler, a patron would blow one 
blast on a cab whistle.
 
✓ Landau: This is a style of four-wheeled, convertible carriage, often 
drawn by a team of four horses. The landau was a vehicle of luxury, 
with a low body type good for seeing and being seen. In “A Scandal in 
Bohemia,” Holmes tells Watson that he considered sneaking a ride on 
the back of a landau while tracking a suspect.
 
✓ Hansom cab: The most iconic vehicle in all of London was the hansom 
cab, a two-wheeled vehicle pulled by a single horse, shown in Figure 4-2. 
The driver rode high up behind the passengers. To hail a hansom, a 
patron would blow two blasts on his cab whistle.
 
Hansom cabs were a scandalous, shocking thing to the more prudish-minded 
Victorians, because the driver, sitting in back, couldn’t see his passengers. 
This meant that his riders could, heaven forbid, kiss without him knowing 
about it.
The Victorian railway: 
Holmes makes tracks!
For long distance travel, nothing beat the railroad. It was fast (for its day), 
modern, reliable, and you could depend on the schedules when it came to 
getting around. Bradshaw’s Railway Guide published every train schedule 
in Great Britain. If you couldn’t find a suitable train that fit your needs, you 
could — assuming you had money to burn — hire a “special” that would take 
you where you needed when you needed. In “The Final Problem,” Professor 
Moriarty hires a special to pursue Holmes and Watson as they flee to the 
continent.

Although early train travel was a bit primitive, by Sherlock’s time, train 
service was getting to be pretty comfortable. Compartments featured 
armrests, upholstered seats, and oil lamps for light. Most passengers shared 
compartments with other travelers, but first-class travelers could get a 
private compartment.
Train travel was generally fast and safe. But accidents occasionally happened, 
and just like today, mass transportation accidents can have a lot of casualties. 
Even this gets referenced in the canon. In “The Speckled Band,” Helen Stoner 
tells Sherlock Holmes that her mother was killed in a railway accident, forcing 
her and her sister to live with their evil stepfather.
Baker Street and the Underground
London had the world’s first subway system, called the Underground, and 
it was already a quarter of a century old when Holmes came onto the world 
stage in A Study in Scarlet. The Underground (or the Tube, as it’s called 
now) opened to the public on January 10, 1863. In its first year, 9.5 million 
Londoners rode it.

82
Part I: Elementary Beginnings and Background 
The Underground trains were powered by steam, and with all the smoke 
and steam belching out of the engines, keeping a supply of breathable air in 
the tunnels was a big problem. Those tunnels contained a lot of poisonous, 
smoky air!
Finally, “blow holes” were created along the Underground routes. They were 
capped with gratings in the roadways up above. It was common for pedestrians 
or passengers in carriages to be surprised by sudden blasts of steam shooting 
out of them.
The Underground appears more rarely than the aboveground railroads. In 
“The Beryl Coronet,” a client named Alexander Holder takes the Underground 
to Baker Street. In “The Bruce-Partington Plans,” the corpse of a murder 
victim named Cadogan West is found by the tracks of the Underground, and 
the details of its operations form part of the solution to the case.
 
Holmes’s rooms are right down the street from the Baker Street Underground 
station, a fact that’s mentioned several times. Yet, in 60 stories, he and Watson 
only take it once, in “The Red-Headed League,” when they travel on it from 
Baker Street to Aldersgate. But perhaps Holmes took it more often, for he 
speaks of his “experience” in traveling on the Underground.

ew stories in literature can rival the adventures of 
Sherlock Holmes for memorable characters. This part 
provides a detailed profile of Holmes, showing the amazing 
depth of the Great Detective’s characterization. You also

of the secondary and supporting characters, including 
cops, bad guys, victims, and damsels in distress.

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
In This Chapter
▶ Examining Sherlock Holmes’s background and personality
▶ Viewing Watson as Holmes’s partner and biographer
▶ Appreciating the friendship between Holmes and Watson
T
hroughout this book I talk about Arthur Conan Doyle, the Sherlock 
Holmes stories, Victorian history, and lots of other fascinating topics. 
But in this chapter, I discuss the personalities at the center of the whole 
Sherlockian phenomenon — Sherlock Holmes and his friend and biographer, 
Dr. John H. Watson.
So what is known about Holmes and Watson? And where does that knowl-
edge come from? Though numerous biographies of the Great Detective have 
been written (yes, that’s right — more than one), I draw the information in 
this chapter from the stories themselves. By combing the canon and reading 
closely, you can get a pretty good idea of who these guys are, their personal 
histories, and even their virtues and vices. The portraits that emerge, built 
up over time and the 60 stories, really leave the impression that these are 
real, complicated people. So it’s time, as T. S. Eliot put it, to “slip into the 
myth of [their] existence.” It’s time to look at Holmes and Watson as if they 
were real people.
Sherlock Holmes: A Character Study
Everything known about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson comes from their 
own words. This is especially true of Sherlock’s family history, which is still 
shrouded in much secrecy. The fact that Holmes seems reluctant to speak 
much about his family (Watson calls it a “complete suppression of every 
reference to his own people”) has led some to speculate that the Holmes 
family’s past holds a terrible secret, and many articles, essays, and stories 
have been written proposing various theories. All that’s really known is what 
Holmes tells Watson directly and what can be gleaned from other comments 
in the canon.

86
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Family history
Sherlock Holmes was extremely reticent about his family history, but in “The 
Greek Interpreter,” he divulges a treasure-trove of personal information. (In 
fact, this story is the primary source of Sherlockian family history — including 
the introduction of his brother, Mycroft.) The story reveals two direct facts 
about Sherlock’s family history. The first pertains to Sherlock’s bloodline. In 
the story, he tells Watson that his grandmother was the sister of “Vernet, the 
French artist.”
 
Émile Jean-Horace Vernet (1789–1863) was a member of the famous Vernet 
family of French artists and is the most likely candidate for Holmes’s ancestor. 
He was best known as a painter of battles and Arab scenes. His father, Carle 
Vernet, was another famous painter, and Carle’s father, Claude Joseph Vernet, 
was also an artist. Art was the family business! Holmes attributes his own abili-
ties and his nature to this branch of his family tree. “Art in the blood is liable 
to take the strangest forms,” he remarks.
Also in “The Greek Interpreter,” Holmes makes the second direct statement 
about his family history when he tells Watson, “My ancestors were country 
squires, who appear to have led much the same life as is natural to their 
class.” But what is a “country squire,” and what does it mean for our under-
standing of Sherlock Holmes?
A country squire was a gentleman landowner in the country who rented his 
land to tenants instead of using it for farming. A squire lived with his family 
in what’s known as an English country house, which was a local seat of influ-
ence in its county. This is an important bit of information. Sherlock’s casual 
comment indicates that he came from a family with some money and pres-
tige, and you can see the influence of his family background in everything 
from his education to his attitudes about money and the upper classes. You 
also see it in his brother Mycroft.
For instance, Sherlock relates easily to the men who take care of Irene Adler’s 
horse in “A Scandal in Bohemia,” and a familiarity with horses comes with 
country life. But he is equally comfortable moving among the upper class, 
who neither impress nor intimidate him. Surely this comes from his family 
having some degree of social status as country squires.
Then there’s his brother Mycroft (see Figure 5-1), who, as the story “The 
Bruce-Partington Plans” reveals, draws a modest annual salary and remains 
a subordinate in government service. And yet he’s not only a member but a 
founder of a private gentleman’s club, known as the Diogenes Club. Mycroft 
obviously is living on family money.

87
 Chapter 5: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
His education
Because Sherlock’s family were country squires, you can be pretty certain he 
had a good education as a child. Illiteracy was high, especially in the first half 
of the Victorian age, and many children never went to school. Some schools 
were run by churches, which taught poorer children. Middle-class kids usu-
ally went to small, private schools in their local towns. For wealthier families, 
including the Holmeses, there was something else.
Going to public school
The norm for many prominent families was private tutoring by a governess. 
Think of it as the Victorian version of modern home schooling. Privately 
tutored boys, when they reached a certain age, then went off to public 
Brother Mycroft
Poor Watson. There he was, living on Baker 
Street with his friend Sherlock Holmes for five 
years, thinking that his friend was “an orphan 
with no relatives living.” Or, as he put it, “an 
isolated phenomenon.” Then one day, out of 
the blue, Holmes tells him that he has a brother. 
“This was news to me indeed,” says Watson in 
a classic understatement.
Mycroft Holmes is seven years older than 
his more famous brother. Sherlock says that 
Mycroft’s abilities at observation and deduction 
are even greater than Sherlock’s, implying that 
these abilities are some kind of hereditary trait.
And yet, despite having this skill, Mycroft is no 
detective. Unlike his brother, Mycroft is lazy. 
As Sherlock puts it, he “would rather be con-
sidered wrong than take the trouble to prove 
himself right.”
Also unlike his brother, Mycroft is “heavily built 
and massive” but with “a head so masterful 
in its brow, so alert in its steel-gray, deep-set 
eyes, so firm in its lips, and so subtle in its play 
of expression, that after the first glance one 
forgot the gross body and remembered only the 
dominant mind.”
Mycroft holds a position in the British govern-
ment, but it isn’t exactly clear what his position 
is. In “The Bruce-Partington Plans,” Sherlock 
describes his brother as “the central exchange, 
the clearing-house” of government information 
and policy, and calls him “the most indispens-
able man in the country.”
Even the great Sherlock Holmes turns to 
Mycroft when he’s stuck on a case. “Again and 
again I have taken a problem to him, and have 
received an explanation which has afterwards 
proved to be the correct one,” says Sherlock 
in “The Greek Interpreter.” “If the art of the 
detective began and ended in reasoning from 
an armchair, my brother would be the greatest 
criminal agent that ever lived.”
When not in his government office, Mycroft can 
be found in the Diogenes Club, a private club 
founded for “the most unsociable and unclub-
able men in town. No member is permitted to 
take the least notice of any other one.” Mycroft 
was a founding member.

88
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
school. (Girls stayed home, where they were taught more domestic skills, like 
sewing and cooking. They also often learned to read music and to play the 
piano.)
 
The term “public school” in this case is actually misleading. Public schools 
were actually private schools that charged tuition. Life at a Victorian public 
school could be grueling, and the classes were very demanding. The whole 
idea was to get the boys prepared either for a profession or to go on to 
college. The curriculum included lessons in Greek and Latin (and other 
languages) and the classics of literature. You can see the influence of this 
education on Sherlock Holmes, who speaks French, quotes Latin, and often 
references classical literature. He’s clearly the product of a public school 
education.
Daily life at these schools often included physical punishment, and older 
boys tended to bully younger ones. Parents often used the schools to be rid 
of children they didn’t want to care for. It all makes you wonder if Sherlock’s 
lack of friends and general antisocial behavior (see “The antisocial Holmes” 
section later in the chapter) can be traced to his time in public school.

 Chapter 5: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
Attending college
The stories leave no doubt that, after he graduated from public school, 
Sherlock Holmes attended college. In “The Gloria Scott” and “The Musgrave 
Ritual,” Holmes mentions a little about his university life. Evidence in the 
stories indicates that he attended either Oxford or Cambridge, but it’s impos-
sible to know for certain which one was Sherlock’s alma mater.
Holmes didn’t make many friends while in college. In fact, he says that some-
one named Victor Trevor “was the only friend I made during the two years I 
was at college.” (This comment also divulges something else — Holmes never 
graduated.)
Holmes and Trevor (see Figure 5-2) meet when Trevor’s bull terrier bites 
Holmes on the leg! “It was a prosaic way of forming a friendship,” says Holmes, 
“but it was effective.” It’s while visiting Trevor on summer vacation that the 
events of “The Gloria Scott” occur, first giving Holmes the idea that he might 
make a living by using his gift of observation and deduction.
At school, Sherlock did participate in extracurricular activities, including 
fencing and boxing, but he admits that “I was never a very sociable fellow . . . 
always rather fond of moping in my rooms and working out my own little meth-
ods of thought, so that I never mixed much with the men of my year.”

Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
The one other person Sherlock got to know in college was Reginald 
Musgrave, who was in the same college as Holmes. Musgrave was a member 
of one of the oldest families in Britain, with a large manor house in Hurlstone. 
Musgrave was only an “acquaintance,” but like Holmes, he “was not gener-
ally popular among the undergraduates.” Four years after graduation, when a 
mystery occurs at Musgrave’s manor house, he invites Holmes to investigate. 
(For details, read “The Musgrave Ritual.”)
His early professional life
Perhaps it was the events of “The Gloria Scott” that persuaded Holmes to 
leave school early and become the world’s first and only consulting detec-
tive, or, as he tells Reginald Musgrave, “living by my wits.”
As he tells Watson, “When I first came up to London I had rooms in Montague 
Street, just round the corner from the British Museum, and there I waited, 
filling in my too abundant leisure time by studying all those branches of sci-
ence which might make me more efficient.” His early caseload wasn’t over-
whelming. “Now and again cases came in my way, principally through the 
introduction of old fellow-students, for during my last years at the university 
there was a good deal of talk there about myself and my methods.” When he 
wasn’t working on cases, Holmes could be found in the reading room of the 
British Museum, or, as Watson was soon to discover, the chemical lab at St. 
Bartholomew’s Hospital.
Over the next five years, Holmes patiently worked to establish his reputa-
tion, courting police contacts, offering help to Scotland Yard detectives, and 
slowly gaining clients through word of mouth. It was also during these slow 
years that Holmes turned to drugs to relieve his boredom. “I cannot live with-
out brainwork,” he later tells Watson.
By 1881, Holmes had “many acquaintances, and those in the most different 
classes of society.” His professional relationship with Scotland Yard had 
gotten strong enough that Inspector Lestrade was turning to Holmes “three 
or four times in a single week.” Shortly after he and Watson began living 
together, Watson noted that, in one week, his visitors included a young, fash-
ionably dressed girl; an excited, gray-headed, seedy man; a slipshod elderly 
woman; an old, white-haired gentleman; and a railway porter in his velveteen 
uniform — quite a cross section of society!
His first meeting with Watson
In 1881 (or 1882 — it’s difficult to be exactly sure), Sherlock Holmes was look-
ing for a roommate. He had been living near the British Museum, but as his 
detective practice grew, he found he needed better rooms. Unfortunately, 

91
 Chapter 5: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
his bank account hadn’t grown quite as fast, so he needed a roommate to 
share expenses. He had his eye on a suite of rooms on Baker Street, and in A 
Study in Scarlet, he mentions his desire to share them with a man known only 
as “Stamford,” whom he knows from the chemical lab at St. Bartholomew’s 
Hospital.
Later that afternoon, Stamford stops in at the Criterion Bar in Piccadilly 
Circus to meet his old friend, Dr. John H. Watson. It turns out that Watson is 
looking for a roommate, too, and so, after lunch, they go to find Holmes.
There, in St. Bartholomew’s Hospital chemical lab, they find Holmes, who 
has just discovered a revolutionary new test for blood stains. When he calms 
down, Stamford introduces Watson to him.
“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” says Stamford. Holmes shakes hands 
with Watson and immediately demonstrates his extraordinary powers: “You 
have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.”
And the rest is history. Holmes and Watson took the rooms on Baker Street, 
at the address 221b, and forged a partnership that lasted on and off for the 
next 32 years. Along the way, Sherlock Holmes established the model method 
for crime detection.
The ascent to professional prominence
Holmes and Watson became roommates out of financial need. In the early 
days of their partnership when money was tight, Holmes loved getting a 
wealthy client. For instance, when spotting a carriage pull up to the curb out-
side their door in “A Scandal in Bohemia,” Holmes comments, “A nice little 
brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There’s 
money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.”
Over the years, Sherlock’s reputation grew, not only among the police but 
also in high society and the government. Though Holmes never stopped 
seeing the frightened governess or the lowly shopkeeper, his list of cases and 
clients grew to include kings, popes, various European governments, and the 
upper crust of British society.
Several big cases finally put Holmes in a position of financial security. In 
“The Final Problem,” he tells Watson, “Between ourselves, the recent cases 
in which I have been of assistance to the royal family of Scandinavia, and to 
the French republic, have left me in such a position that I could continue to 
live in the quiet fashion which is most congenial to me, and to concentrate 
my attention upon my chemical researches.” Even though he’s still relatively 
young (approximately 37), Sherlock Holmes has begun to think of retirement.

92
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
The retired detective (who can’t 
quite stay retired . . .)
Even as early as 1891, Holmes was thinking of retirement. In “The Final 
Problem,” he tells Watson, “Of late I have been tempted to look into the prob-
lems furnished by nature rather than those more superficial ones to which 
our artificial state of society is responsible.”
Finally, in 1903, Sherlock Holmes retired. Watson had already left 221b Baker 
Street for marriage, and so Holmes packed up and took a cottage on the 
Sussex Downs near the sea. There, he took up beekeeping and agriculture, 
living the life of a hermit, all alone but for a housekeeper named Martha.
He didn’t plan on forgetting about detective work entirely, at one point saying 
he intended to devote his “declining years to the composition of a textbook 
which shall focus the whole art of detection into one volume.” Despite his 
retirement, mystery had a way of finding him.
Three recorded cases take place after Sherlock Holmes retires to the Sussex 
Downs. They are:
 
✓ “The Blanched Soldier”: Holmes investigates the case of a man who’s 
gone missing, even though no one will admit it. This is the first of two 
stories that Holmes narrates, and, after years of criticizing Watson’s 
accounts, Holmes grudgingly admits that Watson knew what he was 
doing!
Sherlock’s lessons in detection
Sherlock Holmes often shared the secrets of 
his detective skills. The canon is littered with 
little Sherlockian lessons in detection. Many of 
these statements are still cited by law enforce-
ment professionals when teaching criminal 
investigation:
 ✓ “You know my method. It is founded upon 
the observation of trifles.”
 ✓ “It is a capital mistake to theorize in advance 
of the facts.”
 ✓ “See the value of imagination . . . We have 
imagined what might have happened, acted 
upon the supposition, and find ourselves 
justified.”
 ✓ “We approach the case, you remember, 
with an absolutely blank mind, which is 
always an advantage. We had formed 
no theories. We were simply there to 
observe and to draw inferences from our 
observations.”
 ✓ “I never guess. It is a shocking habit — 
destructive to the logical faculty.”

93
 Chapter 5: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
 
✓ “The Lion’s Mane”: When a neighbor dies from whip marks after swim-
ming, Holmes decides to investigate. At the start of the story, Holmes 
says that he had given himself up “entirely to that soothing life of 
Nature” which he had often yearned for “during the long years spent 
amid the gloom of London.” He adds, “At this period of my life the good 
Watson had passed almost beyond my ken. An occasional week-end visit 
was the most that I ever saw of him.”
 
✓ “His Last Bow”: When Britain’s foreign minister and premier both visit 
Sherlock in his humble cottage to ask for the Great Detective’s help in 
foiling a German spy ring, the case proves to be too much to resist. The 
request sets Holmes on a three-year odyssey resulting in the capture 
of a German spy on the eve of World War I. This story also reveals how 
Holmes really spent his retirement years. He shows Watson the magnum 
opus of his latter years, a small blue book titled A Practical Handbook of 
Bee Culture, with Some Observations upon the Segregation of the Queen, 
by Sherlock Holmes. “Behold the fruit of pensive nights and laborious 
days when I watched the little working gangs as once I watched the 
criminal world of London!”
His complicated personality
“I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity,” says Watson after he 
moves in with Holmes. The longer he lived with Holmes, the more fascinat-
ing a person the detective became. “My interest in him and my curiosity as 
to his aims in life gradually deepened and increased,” Watson says in A Study 
in Scarlet. Most readers who pick up the canon and start reading will end up 
feeling the same way.
Sherlock’s “racing engine”
Watson once characterized his friend as “the most perfect reasoning and 
observing machine that the world has seen.” Holmes would have agreed. For 
Holmes, mental exercise was life itself.
Idleness or lack of work usually put Holmes into a bad mood. Sometimes it 
made him short-tempered. Other times it sent him into a depression. And still 
other times, when things were particularly slow, Holmes turned to drugs. “My 
mind rebels at stagnation,” he explains to Watson when the doctor objects to 
his cocaine use. “Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse 
cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmo-
sphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants.”
The need for mental stimulation was a common condition of Holmes through-
out the canon. As early as the second story, The Sign of the Four (1890), 
Holmes says, “I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exalta-
tion.” And as late as “The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge” (1908), he exclaims, 
“My mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it is not con-
nected up with the work for which it was built.”

The antisocial Holmes
Sherlock Holmes was not a sociable man. “I do not encourage visitors,” he 
says in “The Five Orange Pips,” following an unexpected knock at the door. 
In “The Noble Bachelor,” when Holmes receives what looks like an invitation 
in the mail, he responds by saying, “This looks like one of those unwelcome 
social summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or lie.” Watson 
says that Holmes “loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian 
soul.”
But why was he like this? Was he just a jerk? Or was there some other, more 
sympathetic reason? For the discerning reader, Holmes’s antisocial nature 
is clearly related to his tendency toward depression. “I get in the dumps at 
times, and don’t open my mouth for days on end,” he tells Watson when they 
first decide to share rooms. “You must not think I am sulky when I do that. 
Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right.”
Sherlock’s brother Mycroft shares his antisocial tendency. Mycroft was a 
founding member of the Diogenes Club, which was created for men who, 
“some from shyness, some from misanthropy, have no wish for the company 
of their fellows.” Holmes tells Watson that “no member is permitted to take 
the least notice of any other one.” He adds that “I have myself found it a very 
soothing atmosphere.”
A touch of drama
Despite being antisocial in his personal life, Holmes did crave recognition. He 
wasn’t shy about his own abilities, once saying, “I cannot agree with those who 
rank modesty among the virtues.” This tendency often led Holmes to withhold 
what he was up to in order to spring an exciting resolution to a case. Watson 
says that Holmes could “never resist the touch of the dramatic.”
In The Valley of Fear, Holmes comments: “Watson insists that I am the dra-
matist in real life. Some touch of the artist wells up within me, and calls 
insistently for a well-staged performance.” Holmes’s flair for the dramatic has 
caused some to wonder if, in his youth, he took acting lessons, or even per-
formed on the stage. For the record, the canon has no mention of a theatrical 
background, but Holmes often spoke in theatrical terms. For instance, toward 
the end of “The Second Stain,” he says, “Come, friend Watson, the curtain 
rings up for the last act.”
Holmes’s ability at disguise and makeup was extraordinary. His disguises 
include everything from a priest to a “drunken groom.” His makeup and per-
formances were so good that they often fooled Watson himself. “The best 
way of successfully acting a part,” says Holmes, “is to be it.”

 Chapter 5: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
His love life (or lack thereof)
Aside from Holmes’s drug abuse, no aspect of his personality has inspired 
more speculation than his feelings for and relationships with women. If 
you’ve only watched Holmes movies, you may think that he had an on-again, 
off-again affair with a notorious woman named Irene Adler. Brace yourself — 
that’s all wrong.
Irene Adler makes her one and only appearance in “A Scandal in Bohemia.” 
She comes to Holmes’s attention when his client accuses her of blackmailing 
him. Adler was an “adventuress,” or what’s nowadays known as a gold digger. 
An American born in New Jersey, Irene was a contralto who performed at La 
Scala and was prima donna of the Imperial Opera of Warsaw until she retired 
from the operatic stage. And at the time of the story, she was engaged to be 
married (but not to Sherlock Holmes!).
“It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler,” Watson says. 
“All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise 
but admirably balanced mind.” No, Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler never 
hooked up.
Despite Watson’s disclaimers, Holmes wasn’t entirely unaware of the effect 
a woman could have on him. For instance, upon seeing Irene, Holmes tells 
Watson that “she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.” 
And decades later, in “The Lion’s Mane,” Sherlock encounters a woman 
named Maud Bellamy. In all the canon, no woman inspires such an honest 
expression of admiration and attraction in Sherlock Holmes as does this 
woman.
“Women have seldom been an attraction to me, for my brain has always gov-
erned my heart,” confesses Holmes, “but I could not look upon her perfect 
clear-cut face, with all the soft freshness of the Downlands in her delicate col-
oring, without realizing that no young man would cross her path unscathed.” 
Or older men either, evidently!
No, the problem wasn’t that Holmes was immune to the charms of a woman. 
But as Watson put it, “Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his 
own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion 
in a nature such as his.” The real issue was that Holmes didn’t trust women.
“The motives of women are so inscrutable,” he explains. “Their most trivial 
action may mean volumes, or their most extraordinary conduct may depend 
upon a hairpin or a curling tongs.” On another occasion he puts it more 
bluntly: “Women are never to be entirely trusted — not the best of them.”

96
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Though he didn’t understand what motivates women and, therefore, as an 
analytical reasoner, couldn’t trust them, Holmes did understand the ways 
of love. When one of his young, female clients is getting unwanted attention 
from a man, Holmes remarks that “it is part of the settled order of nature that 
such a girl should have followers.” He also shows remarkable insight into 
the human heart when he comments in “The Musgrave Ritual” that “a man 
always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman’s love, 
however badly he may have treated her.” Who knows? Perhaps he speaks 
from personal experience.
By his own confession, Holmes admits that “I have never loved.” And yet, 
even with that straightforward statement, it’s hard to get Irene Adler out of 
your mind. Not only is she one of the few opponents who ever bested the 
Great Detective, but also, as Holmes tells Watson, “She is the daintiest thing 
under a bonnet on this planet.” And then there’s the famous conclusion to “A 
Scandal in Bohemia.” Watson’s words will always make readers wonder: “He 
used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him 
do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her pho-
tograph, it is always under the honorable title of the woman.”
His religious beliefs
Despite the influence of Charles Darwin and Karl Marx, late 19th-century 
England identified itself overwhelmingly as a Christian country, with 
Anglicanism being the official church of the state. (That fact hasn’t changed, 
as the queen is still head of the Church of England.) Sherlock Holmes 
reflected his country’s Christian nature in both word and deed.
 
One of Holmes’s most attractive personality traits is his moral character. 
Though he’s not one to indulge in false modesty about his own abilities, 
when faced with real moral and ethical situations, he displays the humility 
of England’s Christian faith. For example, in The Hound of the Baskervilles, 
Dr. Mortimer expresses a belief that the hound may be supernatural. Holmes 
replies by saying, “In my modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the 
Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task.”
This trait, in balance with his great mental ability, gives a moral depth to a 
person who otherwise would be nothing more than a “reasoning machine.” 
On numerous occasions in the canon, Holmes feels compassion for wrong-
doers, essentially telling them to “go and sin no more.” His sense of justice is 
clearly coupled with an instinct for mercy.
So was Sherlock Holmes religious? Did he believe in God? As seen in the fol-
lowing examples, the answer is clearly yes.

97
 Chapter 5: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
 
✓ “God help us!” says Holmes after hearing the murderer’s confession in 
“The Boscombe Valley Mystery.” He goes on to say, “Why does fate play 
such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as 
this that I do not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but for the 
grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.’”
 
✓ At the end of “The Cardboard Box,” when the tragic story of jealousy, 
marital infidelity, and murder is revealed, Holmes asks, “What is the 
meaning of it, Watson? What object is served by this circle of misery and 
violence and fear? It must tend to some end, or else our universe is ruled 
by chance, which is unthinkable.”
 
✓ The most explicit statement of Holmes’s theology comes from “The 
Naval Treaty.” While listening to his client’s story, Holmes picks up a 
rose from a vase on the table and delivers an extraordinary little theo-
logical lecture. “What a lovely thing a rose is!” he says. “Our highest 
assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flow-
ers. All other things, our powers, our desires, our food, are all really nec-
essary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its 
smell and its color are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is 
only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much 
to hope from the flowers.”
 
 Sherlock Holmes was a deep guy!
His life’s purpose: Pursuit 
of the greater good
Armed with the gift of a great mind and fueled by the religious morality of his 
era, Holmes plied his trade in pursuit of the greater good. “I think that I may 
go so far as to say, Watson, that I have not lived wholly in vain.” He adds, 
“The air of London is the sweeter for my presence. In over a thousand cases I 
am not aware that I have ever used my powers upon the wrong side.”
When Holmes writes what he believes is his goodbye letter to Watson in “The 
Final Problem” (just before his fight to the death with Professor Moriarty), 
he pens, “I am pleased to think that I shall be able to free society from any 
further effects of [Moriarty’s] presence, though I fear that it is at a cost which 
will give pain to my friends, and especially, my dear Watson, to you.” Holmes 
takes on a Christ-like aura here, willing to sacrifice himself for his fellow man. 
(He even eventually returns from the dead.) These unconscious motifs add a 
surprising depth to his character.
As he once stated, “It’s every man’s business to see justice done.”

Meet Dr. Watson
Dr. John H. Watson is the friend and biographer of Sherlock Holmes. Readers 
get most of their information about Holmes through Watson’s accounts of 
their adventures together. Of the 60 tales in the canon, Watson wrote at least 
56 of them. (Two were told by Holmes himself, and two others were told in 
the third person, making it impossible to identify who the author is supposed 
to be.)
 
Much speculation has gone into what Watson’s middle name is. The stories 
only say that his middle initial is “H,” but the famous mystery author Dorothy 
Sayers (creator of Lord Peter Wimsey) theorized that the “H” stands for 
“Hamish,” the Scottish version of “James.” She cited as evidence the fact that 
Watson’s wife once called him James instead of John, his first name. Most 
Sherlockians embrace this clever theory and now consider his full name to be 
Dr. John Hamish Watson.
Watson reveals some biographical details right at the start of the first 
novel, A Study in Scarlet. You can glean the rest of what’s known about him 
from reading the stories, as insights and biographical tidbits are sprinkled 
throughout the tales.
A brief biography
Watson mentions that he earned the degree of Doctor of Medicine from the 
University of London in 1878. He then took a course to become a surgeon in 
the British Army.
Working back from that date, it’s believed that he was born sometime in 
1852, making him approximately two years older than Sherlock Holmes. The 
fact that Holmes and Watson are close in age often comes as a shock to new 
readers, who are used to Watson being portrayed in the movies as a much 
older man.
Watson’s early life is a bit sketchy, and you can’t deduce nearly as much 
about him as you’re able to about Holmes. This isn’t surprising, as Watson 
was telling Sherlock’s story, not necessarily his own. But a few things are 
made clear, such as the fact that his parents are dead and that he had an 
older brother who died from alcoholism.
In The Sign of the Four, Watson asks Holmes what he can discover from 
Watson’s old pocket watch. Holmes deduces that it belonged to Watson’s 
older brother, but he doesn’t stop there: “He was a man of untidy habits — 
very untidy and careless. He was left with good prospects, but he threw away 
his chances, lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of 
prosperity, and finally, taking to drink, he died.”

99
 Chapter 5: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
Needless to say, Holmes was right, but you’ll have to read the story to know 
how he figured it out! With the death of his brother, Watson was all alone. At 
the start of A Study in Scarlet he says, “I had neither kith nor kin in England.”
From references and his own statements in the stories, it’s clear that Watson 
had traveled extensively before he met Holmes. He explicitly says that he has 
traveled to “many nations and three separate continents,” and some of these 
locations become apparent in the stories. Among his many travels, Watson 
visited Australia, the United States, the continent of Europe, and Afghanistan.
Watson served in the military during the Afghan war. He was wounded and 
shipped home on a wound pension of “eleven shillings and sixpence a day.” 
He gravitated toward London, “leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, 
and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought.” 
He was nearly out of money and out of luck. And then came the great turn-
ing point in his life, when Dr. John H. Watson was introduced to Sherlock 
Holmes.
His military career
Watson’s military career was short and tragic, but like many military men, his 
experiences in the British Army stayed with him throughout his entire life. 
“I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as assistant sur-
geon,” he says in A Study in Scarlet. His regiment was stationed in India. Upon 
his arrival, the Second Afghan War broke out. He was reassigned to a new 
regiment, the Berkshires, and while he was with them, disaster struck.
His company was caught up in the Battle of Maiwand, one of the main 
battles of the Second Afghan War. Casualties were high, and it was one of 
the few times the British Army was defeated in battle. Over 2,000 Afghan 
warriors were killed, and approximately 1,500 were wounded. On the British 
side, over 900 were killed, and 177 were wounded. Watson was one of them: 
“I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone 
and grazed the subclavian artery.” Laying wounded on the battlefield, 
Watson would surely have died or been killed if not for an orderly named 
Murray, who picked him up, threw him across a packhorse, and brought 
him back to safety.
He was then shipped out, “worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged 
hardships,” to a base hospital at Peshawar. It was there that he had his 
second round of bad luck — he was struck down with “enteric fever,” other-
wise known as typhoid fever, spread by poor sanitation techniques.
Finally, after months of suffering and recovery, Watson found himself on a 
ship bound for England “with my health irretrievably ruined.” Thus ended the 
short, inglorious military career of Dr. John H. Watson.

Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
 
Watson’s war wound can be confusing because it seems to move from story to 
story! In A Study in Scarlet, he says, in technical detail, that “I was struck on the 
shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subcla-
vian artery.” In the very next book, the wound has moved to his leg! “I had had 
a Jezail bullet through it some time before, and though it did not prevent me 
from walking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather.” Did he forget 
where he was wounded? Was he shot twice? Or was it a single “magic bullet,” 
as in the JFK assassination, that was able to turn and pass through his shoul-
der and his leg?
His love life
No doubt about it, Watson was a ladies’ man, once boasting “an experience 
of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents.” 
Wow! But it seems he wasn’t exaggerating. Even Sherlock Holmes acknowl-
edges it, saying, “Watson, the fair sex is your department.”
In the stories, Watson always lingers on the physical descriptions of women, 
greatly appreciating feminine beauty. For instance, he describes his first 
glimpse of one of their clients, Mrs. Neville St. Clair, with much detail:
The door flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad 
in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chif-
fon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure outlined against the 
flood of light, one hand upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, 
her body slightly bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and 
parted lips, a standing question.
Watson must have had a way with women. In “The Retired Colourman,” 
Holmes says, “With your natural advantages, Watson, every lady is your 
helper and accomplice.” But Watson wasn’t always Mr. Smooth with women. 
While riding in a cab with Mary Morstan, whom Watson had fallen in love 
with and who would eventually become his wife, the good doctor gets 
tongue-tied and tells her a “moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into 
my tent at the dead of night, and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at 
it.” Uh, right. . . .
We know for certain that Watson was married twice. His first wife was Mary 
Morstan, whom he meets in The Sign of the Four. They were married in 1882, 
but sadly, by 1892, Watson was a widower.
He stayed single for approximately 20 years, but finally, in “The Blanched 
Soldier,” Holmes says that “the good Watson had deserted me for a wife, the 
only selfish action which I can recall in our association.”

101
 Chapter 5: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
Watson as doctor
Though Watson was indeed a doctor, his heart never seemed to truly be in it. 
Life with Sherlock Holmes had spoiled him. How could treating someone’s gout 
compare to mysterious coded messages or murderous pygmies? How could 
diagnosing a head cold stand up to analyzing a bloody crime scene? It couldn’t, 
and Watson himself admits that “my practice is never very absorbing.”
And yet, for a while after his first marriage, he made a go of it. “Shortly after 
my marriage I had bought a connection in the Paddington district. I had con-
fidence . . . in my own youth and energy and was convinced that in a very few 
years the concern would be as flourishing. . . .” For a time, Watson seemed to 
have the best of both worlds — a happy marriage and career, while still occa-
sionally joining his friend for a thrilling adventure. His wife never begrudged 
his being called away by Holmes, and Watson always had an accommodating 
neighbor who could see his patients for a day or two.
So how good a doctor was Watson? In “The Dying Detective,” in a terrible 
moment of (feigned) delirium, Holmes declares, “Facts are facts, Watson, and, 
after all, you are only a general practitioner with very limited experience and 
mediocre qualifications.” But you can’t take this as an honest appraisal of 
Watson’s medical skills. At the end of the story, Holmes himself explains that 
he had to say those things to convince Watson that he was really sick and out 
of his mind with fever. “Do you imagine that I have no respect for your medi-
cal talents?” Holmes tells his friend.
Actually, despite his lack of enthusiasm, Watson seems to be a pretty good 
physician. He quickly diagnoses an aortic aneurism in A Study in Scarlet, and 
at a glance he recognizes that the murder suspect in “The Boscombe Valley 
Mystery” is “in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.” Evidence even 
exists that he worked at keeping his medical skill current. In “The Resident 
Patient,” he mentions having read a monograph on “obscure nervous 
lesions,” the kind of thing only a curious, interested doctor would read.
Watson as biographer and partner
As a partner in his detective practice, Holmes valued Watson highly. “A 
trusty comrade is always of use,” he once said, “and a chronicler still more 
so.” But how highly did Holmes value Watson as a “chronicler”?
Well, there’s no denying the fact that for most of their association, Holmes 
felt Watson was lacking as his biographer. On one occasion, Holmes says, 
“Your fatal habit of looking at everything from the point of view of a story 
instead of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an 
instructive and even classical series of demonstrations.”

102
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Holmes believed that Watson’s accounts should be “cold and unemotional” 
lessons in scientific detection. “You have attempted to tinge it with romanti-
cism,” he says in another critique of his friend’s writing, “which produces 
much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the 
fifth proposition of Euclid.”
Quite understandably, Watson finds Holmes’s literary criticism irritating. 
“Why don’t you write them yourself?” he asks. And finally, Holmes gives it 
a shot. “For a long time [Watson] has worried me to write an experience of 
my own.” And when he does, Holmes gets a big surprise: “I am compelled 
to admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I do begin to realize that the 
matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader.”
 
The fact is, Watson was a very good storyteller, and his ability to recognize 
what makes a good tale, as opposed to merely a clinical account of observa-
tion and deduction, helped make him Holmes’s superior in the writing depart-
ment. Plus, he was simply a good writer. Even Holmes admits this latter point: 
“I must act as my own chronicler,” he writes in “The Lion’s Mane,” one of the 
few stories Holmes wrote himself. “Ah! had he but been with me, how much 
he might have made of so wonderful a happening and of my eventual triumph 
against every difficulty!”
It may have taken decades for Holmes to appreciate Watson as a writer, but 
he made up for it by recognizing Watson’s value as an investigative part-
ner almost immediately. “I am bound to say that in all the accounts which 
you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have 
habitually underrated your own abilities,” he tells Watson in The Hound of 
the Baskervilles. “It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but you are 
a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remark-
able power of stimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in 
your debt.”
Watson at play
Unlike his friend Sherlock Holmes, who usually moped around his rooms 
when not occupied, Watson was a regular guy who enjoyed a number of fun 
activities. In his youth he must have been athletic, for you find out in “The 
Sussex Vampire” that he at one time played rugby for Blackheath.
 
The game of rugby, a form of English football, was invented in 1823 at 
England’s Rugby School in Warwickshire. In 1830, Blackheath Proprietary 
School opened in Blackheath, England. Blackheath wasn’t a public school (see 
the earlier section “Going to public school”), but it nonetheless set out to pro-
vide an education on par with the best public schools in England. The school 
adopted rugby as its favorite sport, and soon, matches were regularly sched-
ule on its heath.

103
 Chapter 5: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson
When alums of the school founded the Blackheath Football Club in 1858, they 
made it an open club, meaning that membership wasn’t restricted to associa-
tion with the school. It became the first and most prestigious rugby club in 
the world. The fact that Watson played for this club says a lot about his ath-
leticism, and the stories reveal that Watson keeps up on sports.
Another of Watson’s leisure-time pursuits wasn’t so good for him. Watson 
liked to gamble! It’s pretty clear he bet on horse racing. In “The Adventure of 
Shoscombe Old Place,” Holmes asks, “By the way, Watson, you know some-
thing about racing?” Watson answers by saying, “I ought to. I pay for it with 
about half my wound pension.”
Watson also regularly played billiards at his club with a friend named 
Thurston. Knowing Watson, it’s hard to imagine that he didn’t have some-
thing riding on it!
A Study in Friendship
It’s been said that you first read the Sherlock Holmes stories for the myster-
ies and adventures, but you read them again for the portrait of Holmes and 
Watson’s friendship. Much of the pleasure in reading the canon comes not in 
the action or mystery but in the quiet domestic scenes on Baker Street, with 
our two heroes reading, chatting, or just enjoying each other’s company. 
“You have a grand gift of silence,” Holmes once said to his friend. “It makes 
you quite invaluable as a companion.”
They are close enough that they can criticize each other without jeopardizing 
their friendship, compliment each other without embarrassment, and sup-
port each other in times of need. It’s a deep friendship that shines through 
the more formal Victorian manner.
And there are a few moments where the affection in the relationship is obvi-
ous rather than implied. In “The Three Garridebs,” when “Killer” Evans, the 
bad guy, is cornered, he pulls a gun and shoots Watson! Holmes knocks out 
the villain and turns to Watson.
“You’re not hurt, Watson? For God’s sake, say that you are not hurt!”
It was worth a wound — it was worth many wounds — to know the depth 
of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes 
were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one 
and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great 
brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in 
that moment of revelation.
“It’s nothing, Holmes. It’s a mere scratch.”

104
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
It wasn’t serious, but it didn’t stop Holmes from turning once more to the 
man who shot his friend. “By the Lord, it is as well for you. If you had killed 
Watson, you would not have got out of this room alive.”
But no words in the canon speak to the affection and friendship between 
Sherlock Holmes and John H. Watson more than the closing words of “The 
Final Problem.” Watson writes them under the impression that his friend has 
died following the showdown with the arch-criminal Professor Moriarty. He 
simply calls Sherlock Holmes “the best and the wisest man whom I have ever 
known.”

▶ Introducing Mrs. Hudson
▶ Heralding some of Holmes’s little helpers
S
herlock Holmes doesn’t live his life in a vacuum, of course. He’s not 
defined simply by his personal habits, his background, or his work. As 
with everyone, a key factor is the company he keeps. Holmes interacts with 
a variety of people, ranging from the police inspectors with whom he both 
collaborates and competes against to the servants who prepare his break-
fast. He’s in contact with everyone from kings to commoners to homeless 
children. The relationships he forms with those he lives and works with help 
complete the picture of Holmes’s life and world.
The Police
Right out of the gate, Arthur Conan Doyle established the official police force 
as both collaborators with and competitors to Sherlock Holmes. This unique 
relationship accomplishes several things:
 
✓ It sets up Holmes as a “consulting detective.” Holmes is “the court of 
last appeal,” meaning that when a professional investigator is stuck, he 
turns to Holmes, who, for a fee, will “put [him] on the right scent.” (For 
more on Holmes’s unique profession, see Chapter 2.)
 
✓ It juxtaposes Holmes’s skills against Scotland Yard’s abilities. When 
Holmes began his detective practice, police work, especially crime 
detection, was primitive and unscientific. Portraying the official force in 
this manner helps establish the gulf between Holmes and the Scotland 
Yard inspectors.

106
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
 
✓ It highlights Holmes’s revolutionary methods. Logical application of 
observation and deduction, meticulous evidence collection, and scien-
tific forensic analysis, all coupled with a vast knowledge of criminal his-
tory, stand in stark contrast to the standard policing methods used at 
the start of Holmes’s career.
To give credit where credit’s due, the official detective force did in real life 
begin to adopt many methods similar to those of Holmes, and this is reflected 
in the canon. In the stories, Scotland Yard and Holmes are competitors and 
collaborators, but the balance between the two shifts over time. Older, more 
established detectives like Inspector Lestrade come to see Holmes as a col-
league, while younger, less experienced Scotland Yarders haven’t had time to 
reach this understanding.
You can find a classic example of this in “The Naval Treaty.” The Scotland 
Yard detective assigned to this stolen document case is Inspector Forbes, “a 
small, foxy man with a sharp but by no means amiable expression.” Forbes 
is on the case from the night the crime occurs, but in the nine weeks that 
elapse before Holmes is called in, he’s made no progress. Upon meeting him, 
Watson says that Forbes “was decidedly frigid in his manner to us, especially 
when he heard the errand upon which we had come.”
“I’ve heard of your methods before now, Mr. Holmes,” says the younger, less 
experienced inspector. “You are ready enough to use all the information that 
the police can lay at your disposal, and then you try to finish the case your-
self and bring discredit on them.”
Forbes is definitely more in the competitor camp, but Holmes soon sets him 
right.
“On the contrary,” replies Holmes, “out of my last fifty-three cases my name 
has only appeared in four, and the police have had all the credit in forty-nine. 
I don’t blame you for not knowing this, for you are young and inexperienced, 
but if you wish to get on in your new duties you will work with me and not 
against me.”
Working with Holmes instead of against him is a lesson Forbes’s colleagues 
learned a long time ago. As time passes and the stories progress, the relation-
ship between the pros and the gifted amateur becomes more collaborative 
than competitive.
 
In the early days, presenting a crack team of professional inspectors would 
have been historically inaccurate and also would have undermined the image 
of Sherlock Holmes. The portrayal of the official detective force as a bunch of 
bumblers created the environment for someone like Holmes to appear on the 
scene. As a result, while feeling a natural sense of professional competitive-
ness, the police actually end up being some of Holmes’s best customers.

Just as the canonical police changed over time, the real-life Scotland Yard 
evolved throughout most of the 19th century. In 1829, with the passing of the 
Metropolitan Police Act (see Chapter 4), the Metropolitan Police Force stood 
at 1,000 men. By 1890 the force had grown to about 13,000, and the job of 
policeman became a full-time profession. All the modern principles of the 
force originated during this time, including the patrolling of streets by uni-
formed police officers (see Figure 6-1), a centralized command structure, and 
a detective force.

“The pick of a bad lot”: Inspectors 
Gregson and Lestrade
Over the course of the entire Sherlockian canon, you meet 21 different 
Scotland Yard detectives. Taking into account that three of these detectives 
make repeated appearances, Scotland Yard appears in 42 of the 60 stories! 
Sherlock’s professional counterparts are vital, not only to his career as a con-
sulting detective but also to the entire canon.

108
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
The two most famous Scotland Yard detectives — Inspector Tobias Gregson 
and Inspector G. Lestrade — first appear in A Study in Scarlet, Arthur Conan 
Doyle’s first Holmes novel. Although they make numerous other appearances 
in the Holmes stories, Lestrade and Gregson don’t work together again on the 
same case after this first tale. Holmes clearly prefers to work with Inspector 
Lestrade, who appears in three times as many adventures as does Inspector 
Gregson.
Although Holmes is fond of baiting the official police force, often finding 
their efforts at detection lacking, he grudgingly admits that Lestrade isn’t 
a total loss, calling him “the best of the professionals” in The Hound of the 
Baskervilles. In the earlier A Study in Scarlet, however, he said much the same 
thing about Gregson, calling him “the smartest of the Scotland Yarders.” But 
he quickly throws in the qualifier, “he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot.” 
Sherlock Holmes versus the Yard . . . for real!
The tension between Sherlock Holmes, gifted 
amateur, and his Scotland Yard rivals is well 
known. However, you may be surprised to find 
out that this rivalry spilled over into real life! The 
Encyclopedia of Police Science states,
 
 It is well known that the Sherlock Holmes 
series served as the seminal base for many 
of the modern scientific methods used in 
criminal investigations. His use of tobacco, 
dust, plaster casting, and even document 
examinations to identify perpetrators 
prompted Dr. Edmond Locard, a leading 
criminologist of the time, to comment, 
“Sherlock Holmes was the first to realize 
the importance of dust. I merely copied his 
method.” A careful reading of the mysteries 
suggests that Sherlock Holmes also used a 
form of psychological profiling.
Edmond Locard was a pioneer in forensic sci-
ence who became known as “the Sherlock 
Holmes of France” and founded the first foren-
sic police laboratory in France in 1910. He was 
clearly a fan of the Great Detective.
But across the Channel in London, just like in 
the stories, Holmes gets no love from the Yard. 
Sir Basil Thomson led Scotland Yard’s Criminal 
Investigation Division from 1913 to 1921. During 
Thomson’s time in office, Doyle was still writing 
the Holmes stories. Following Thomson’s retire-
ment, he wrote The Story of Scotland Yard and 
became a frequent lecturer on police matters. 
In a 1922 interview he was asked, “Has the sci-
entific detection of crime made much progress 
in England in recent years?” In stark contrast to 
his peers, Sir Basil answered:
 
 It undoubtedly has made remarkable head-
way, but not in the direction of the Sherlock 
Holmes method of working by deduc-
tion. If I had followed such a plan when I 
was at Scotland Yard I should probably 
have landed the Lord Chief Justice or the 
Archbishop of Canterbury in prison before 
I had finished. I take my hat off to Sherlock, 
but I sincerely hope that I shall never meet 
him in the flesh when I am engaged in the 
work of criminal investigation.
Looks like the real-life Scotland Yarders felt a 
lot like their fictional counterparts — he sounds 
exactly like Inspector Lestrade!

109
 Chapter 6: Cops, Landladies, and Others: The Supporting Characters
Holmes’s biggest complaint regarding Lestrade, Gregson, and all of Scotland 
Yard is their inability to appreciate his revolutionary methods and employ 
them themselves. Although Holmes’s opinion of his two regular Scotland 
Yard colleagues’ intelligence and skill does rise over the years, this one com-
plaint never changes.
Early in their careers, Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be in professional 
competition. Considering that A Study in Scarlet takes place in either 1881 or 
1882, and Holmes is still working with both of them in 1902 (Lestrade in “The 
Three Garridebs”; Gregson in “The Red Circle”), both men were young and 
professionally ambitious. When you consider that the average Scotland Yard 
inspector’s income was less than £100 per year (that’s approximately $11,000 
in today’s value), you may have a little more sympathy for their competitive 
natures.
Whatever their motivations are, Holmes seems to enjoy the situation, saying, 
“They have their knives into one another . . . They are as jealous as a pair of 
professional beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both 
put upon the scent.”
Inspector Tobias Gregson
Surprisingly, Holmes calls Gregson “the smartest of the Scotland Yarders.” 
However, given Holmes’s low opinion of the police force at this point in his 
career, this isn’t necessarily high praise.
Gregson reappears in “The Wisteria Lodge” and “The Red Circle,” stories 
that appeared decades after his initial turn in A Study in Scarlet. The rea-
sons for this are unknown, but Holmes clearly preferred to work with 
Inspector Lestrade, Gregson’s professional rival, and so perhaps Gregson 
never quite got over the professional contempt and jealousy that seems to 
characterize Scotland Yard (even in real life — see the “Sherlock Holmes 
versus the Yard . . . for real!” sidebar).
Inspector Lestrade
Inspector G. Lestrade is the Scotland Yarder who makes the most appear-
ances in the canon. Of all the professional policemen in the Holmes stories, 
Lestrade is the one who undergoes the greatest transformation. When he 
and Holmes first meet, they can barely contain their contempt for each 
other, despite the fact that the inspector prevails upon the amateur detec-
tive several times a week. Holmes tells Watson in A Study in Scarlet that “he 
knows that I am his superior . . . but he would cut his tongue out before he 
would own it to any third person.” However, 17 years later, when “The Six 
Napoleons” was published, Inspector Lestrade admits to Holmes that “we’re 
not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are very proud of you.” He 
also tells Holmes, upon seeing him for the first time after his return from the 
dead, “it’s good to see you back in London, sir.”

110
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Holmes’s opinion of Lestrade changes as well. In “The Cardboard Box,” 
although Holmes still finds Lestrade lacking imagination, he goes on to say 
that “he is as tenacious as a bulldog when he once understands what he has 
to do, and, indeed, it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top 
at Scotland Yard.” It’s clear that, in Sherlock’s opinion, though Lestrade will 
never be a perfect detective, what he does know how to do he does very well.
 
Doyle never reveals Lestrade’s first name; the fullest version that appears 
in the stories is “G. Lestrade.” Doyle likely acquired the inspector’s unusual 
name from a medical school acquaintance. Doyle knew a Joseph Alexandre 
Lestrade, who was two years behind him in school from his days at both 
Stonyhurst and the University of Edinburgh.
Their mellowing relationships with Holmes
Although Sherlock Holmes may enjoy yanking Scotland Yard’s chain from 
time to time, he has no genuine bad feelings toward the inspectors. Though 
Gregson and Holmes don’t work together as frequently as Lestrade and 
Holmes do, when they do meet, the greeting is usually a cordial one. In “The 
Adventure of Wisteria Lodge,” Holmes’s client, Scott Eccles, is in the middle 
of telling Holmes his story when a “robust and official-looking” Inspector 
Gregson shows up to arrest the man. Watson describes Gregson as “ener-
getic, gallant, and, within his limitations, a capable officer.” Gregson’s profes-
sional behavior bears this out — he allows Eccles to finish his statement to 
Holmes, but not before adding, “it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles that it 
may be used against him.”
And in “The Red Circle,” when Holmes meets Gregson in a darkened street 
while staking out a house, he exclaims, “Why, Gregson! Journeys end with 
lovers’ meetings.”
Yes, things seemed to have mellowed between the Yard and Sherlock Holmes 
in later years. It’s true, in the early days Holmes ruefully, and even resent-
fully, acknowledges that credit for his work will go to Scotland Yard: “My 
dear fellow, what does it matter to me? Supposing I unravel the whole matter, 
you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all the credit.”
Later, by the time of “The Norwood Builder,” it seems that Holmes’s resent-
fulness has given way to resignation. He actually tells Lestrade to take the 
official credit for solving the case. Patting him on the back, he says:
“Instead of being ruined, my good sir, you will find that your reputa-
tion has been enormously enhanced. Just make a few alterations in that 
report which you were writing, and they will understand how hard it is to 
throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Lestrade.”
“And you don’t want your name to appear?”
“Not at all. The work is its own reward.”

111
 Chapter 6: Cops, Landladies, and Others: The Supporting Characters
This passage, of course, reveals a bit about Holmes — that by this time in 
his career, he had attained such a degree of success that he was no longer 
concerned with publicly getting credit. But it also reveals something about 
Gregson and Lestrade — they don’t mind a bit taking credit they don’t 
deserve.
And yet, again, late in the canon, we get this appreciative paragraph from 
Watson, talking about Inspector Gregson:
Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence, but 
never in that of courage. Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this desper-
ate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike bearing 
with which he would have ascended the official staircase of Scotland 
Yard.
It’s a far more respectful attitude, and it reflects the mutual respect that had 
grown between Scotland Yard and Holmes and Watson.
The rest of the Scotland Yard inspectors
As I mention earlier, Scotland Yard appears in 42 of Holmes’s adventures. But 
the Yard wasn’t alone! As you may expect from a series of detective stories, 
a variety of official policemen and detectives appear throughout the saga. 
Sometimes you find out more about them, sometimes less. But while they may 
take the stage for only a brief moment, many of them are quite memorable.
Inspector Algar: “My friend of the Liverpool force”
In “The Cardboard Box,” Holmes says he sent a telegram to “my friend Algar, 
of the Liverpool force.” Readers never meet Inspector Algar, but this state-
ment shows that Holmes’s connections now stretch to the north of England. 
Additionally, the two must have collaborated enough that Holmes considers 
him “my friend.”
Inspector Bardle: The Sussex Constabulary
Inspector Bardle appears in “The Lion’s Mane,” a story written by Holmes 
himself in retirement. Holmes says that Inspector Bardle is from the Sussex 
Constabulary and is “a steady, solid, bovine man with thoughtful eyes.” When 
a man ends up dead on the beach with terrible, whip-like wounds, the coun-
try constable feels a bit in over his head and turns to his famous neighbor for 
advice. “I know your immense experience, sir,” he says. “This is quite unof-
ficial, of course, and need go no farther. But I am fairly up against it in this 
McPherson case. The question is, shall I make an arrest, or shall I not?” The 
passage seems to show that the more humble an officer’s position, the less 
ego he has regarding working with the Great Detective.

112
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Inspector Barton: Scotland Yard
Inspector Barton is the first of two official detectives named in “The Man with 
the Twisted Lip,” and he doesn’t appear quite as confident as his counter-
part, Inspector Bradstreet. Barton, who has charge of the case, makes a seri-
ous mistake by delaying to arrest the murder suspect, thus allowing him to 
communicate with some of his comrades.
Inspector Baynes: The Surrey Constabulary
Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey Constabulary, makes his one and only bow 
in “The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge.” Despite appearing in only one tale, he 
is one of the few professionals who earns Holmes’s respect. Baynes is the 
only uniformed police officer in all the canon who was a match for Sherlock’s 
investigative skills. The two detectives work along different lines, coming 
together at the end to catch the criminal. Holmes bestows a rare thing on his 
rival — a compliment! — and concludes with the belief that the inspector’s 
detective career is promising.
Inspector Bradstreet: Scotland Yard
Inspector Bradstreet, who Watson describes as “a tall, stout official,” is sta-
tioned in the Bow Street Station. He makes three appearances in the canon, 
first showing up in “The Man with the Twisted Lip.” In “The Blue Carbuncle,” 
a newspaper account of the crime reveals that Inspector Bradstreet belongs 
to B division and was the arresting officer. Finally, in “The Engineer’s 
Thumb,” it was Bradstreet who accompanied Holmes, Watson, and Victor 
Hatherley on a train trip to Berkshire in an attempt to locate the house where 
Hatherley had his thumb chopped off.
Inspector Forrester: Scotland Yard
In “The Reigate Squires,” Holmes is recuperating from a nervous breakdown 
at the home of Watson’s friend in Surry. Inspector Forrester is “a smart, keen-
faced young fellow” on the scene investigating a murder committed during 
a burglary. When the young, ambitious Scotland Yarder hears the Great 
Detective is nearby, he pays a visit. “We thought that perhaps you would care 
to step across, Mr. Holmes.”
Inspector Gregory: Scotland Yard
Inspector Gregory, of “The Adventure of Silver Blaze,” is another official high 
on Holmes’s list. Watson calls him “a man who was rapidly making his name 
in the English detective service,” and Holmes backs him up by later saying 
“Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an extremely 
competent officer.” But, as with many of his official colleagues, there is a 
catch. “Were he but gifted with imagination,” says Holmes, “he might rise to 
great heights in his profession.”

113
 Chapter 6: Cops, Landladies, and Others: The Supporting Characters
He also asks a question that leads to one of the most quoted passages in all 
the canon:
“Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?”
“To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”
“The dog did nothing in the night-time.”
“That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.
Wilson Hargreave: The New York Police Bureau
Wilson Hargreave demonstrates that Holmes’s professional contacts stretch 
beyond England. In “The Dancing Men,” Holmes needs information on an 
American gangster and sends a cable “to my friend, Wilson Hargreave, of the 
New York Police Bureau, who has more than once made use of my knowledge 
of London crime.” Sherlock’s reputation had spread across the Atlantic!
Inspector Stanley Hopkins: Scotland Yard
Inspector Stanley Hopkins appears in four of the Sherlock Holmes stories: 
“The Adventure of Black Peter, “ The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez,” 
“The Adventure of the Missing Three Quarter,” and “The Adventure of the 
Abby Grange.” Hopkins is perhaps the most enthusiastic student of Holmes’s 
methods and frequently consults Holmes for advice.
Watson calls him “an exceedingly alert man, thirty years of age, dressed in 
a quiet tweed suit, but retaining the erect bearing of one who was accus-
tomed to official uniform.” He is a young police inspector, and Holmes has 
high hopes for his future. Hopkins in turn openly confesses admiration and 
respect for his role model.
Inspector Athelney Jones: Scotland Yard
Memorable for both his strange first name and his incompetence, Inspector 
Jones makes his only appearance in The Sign of the Four. Watson describes 
him thus: “A very stout, portly man in a gray suit . . . red-faced, burly, and ple-
thoric, with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from 
between swollen and puffy pouches.” Jones distinguishes himself by deni-
grating Holmes’s methods, coming to a completely wrong conclusion about 
the crime and then arresting the wrong man! His is clearly the least-flattering 
portrait of a Scotland Yard detective in the canon.
Inspector Peter Jones: Scotland Yard
Inspector Peter Jones, found in “The Red-Headed League,” is the perfect 
embodiment of the canon’s image of a Scotland Yard detective. He’s no-
nonsense, practical, brave, and simultaneously admiring and dismissive of 

114
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Holmes and his methods. “You may place considerable confidence in Mr. 
Holmes, sir,” he tells the manager of a bank that is about to be robbed. “He 
has his own little methods, which are, if he won’t mind my saying so, just 
a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective 
in him.”
Inspector Lanner: Scotland Yard
Described as “a smart-looking police-inspector,” Mr. Lanner represents a dif-
ferent kind of Scotland Yard detective, one that wholeheartedly welcomes 
Holmes’s help on a case. In “The Resident Patient,” when Holmes arrives on 
the scene, he exclaims, “Ah, Mr. Holmes, I am delighted to see you.” Not all of 
the Yard’s detectives were as dense as Athelney Jones!
Inspector Alec MacDonald: Scotland Yard
Though Inspector Alec MacDonald only appears in The Valley of Fear, his 
reputation as a detective, both in the eyes of Scotland Yard and Sherlock 
Holmes, is great. When we see him in the story, Watson says it is back “in 
the early days at the end of the ’80s, when Alec MacDonald was far from 
having attained the national fame which he has now achieved.” Evidently, 
MacDonald went far in his chosen profession.
MacDonald is described as having a “tall, bony figure” that “gave promise of 
exceptional physical strength,” with a “great cranium and deep-set, lustrous 
eyes” that told of a “keen intelligence.” Watson goes on to say he “was a 
silent, precise man with a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent.”
That he was a favorite of Holmes is clear: “Twice already in his career had 
Holmes helped him to attain success, his own sole reward being the intellec-
tual joy of the problem.”
The admiration went both ways:
The affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur colleague 
were profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which he con-
sulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows nothing higher than 
itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius, and MacDonald had talent 
enough for his profession to enable him to perceive that there was no 
humiliation in seeking the assistance of one who already stood alone in 
Europe, both in his gifts and in his experience. Holmes was not prone to 
friendship, but he was tolerant of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the 
sight of him.
It’s too bad we don’t see more of Alec MacDonald!

115
 Chapter 6: Cops, Landladies, and Others: The Supporting Characters
Inspector MacKinnon: Scotland Yard
Some things never change. Here, right at the end of the canon in “The Retired 
Colourman,” a Scotland Yarder gets credit for Holmes’s work, just like in the 
early days. At the end of the case, the newspaper reports that the mystery 
was solved because of “the remarkable acumen” of Inspector MacKinnon, 
who is an “example of the intelligence of our professional detectives.”
“Well, well, MacKinnon is a good fellow,” says Holmes with a tolerant smile. 
“You can file it in our archives, Watson. Some day the true story may be told.”
Inspector Martin: The Norfolk Constabulary
Inspector Martin of the Norfolk Constabulary appears in “The Dancing Men.” 
Watson describes the local police inspector as “a dapper little man, with a 
quick, alert manner and a waxed moustache.” The murder of a prominent 
citizen, and the shooting of his wife, is certainly the biggest case Inspector 
Martin has ever had. And then Sherlock Holmes arrives! As Watson puts it, 
“he was considerably astonished when he heard the name of my companion.”
Holmes’s reputation was, by this story, known far and wide, and Martin tells 
the famous detective, “I should be proud to feel that we were acting together, 
Mr. Holmes.”
Inspector Martin proves to be a good partner. As Holmes examines the room, 
“the country inspector’s face had shown his intense amazement at the rapid 
and masterful progress of Holmes’s investigation. At first he had shown some 
disposition to assert his own position, but now he was overcome with admi-
ration, and ready to follow without question wherever Holmes led.”
And when a particularly brilliant deduction is explained to him, Martin 
exclaims, “Capital! Capital!” It’s clear that the local investigator is completely 
dazzled by the world-famous detective.
 
While the police, and especially the Scotland Yard detectives, can and do 
solve crimes on their own, they rarely do it in the Holmes stories. But they 
come to Holmes because they have a particularly strange or difficult case, and 
so they need to call in a specialist. Not every crime has a Professor Moriarty 
behind it, and even the likes of Gregson and Lestrade obviously have some 
degree of success on their own.
Other private detectives
Holmes’s professional acquaintances aren’t limited to the official side of the 
street. As Holmes tells Watson early on in A Study in Scarlet, “Here in London 
we have lots of government detectives and lots of private ones.” Although 
there were indeed lots of private detectives around, the canon doesn’t con-
tain many. But a couple are definitely worth noting.

116
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Mr. Barker: Private detective
In “The Retired Colourman,” Holmes introduces another private detective, 
Mr. Barker, “a stern-looking, impassive man.” Watson goes on to add that he’s 
“a dark man with gray-tinted glasses and a large Masonic pin projecting from 
his tie.” Very ominous sounding!
Holmes calls Barker a friend and “my hated rival upon the Surrey shore.” The 
Surrey shore is the far side of the Thames from the richer and more fashion-
able area north of the river, the heart of the true city, where Holmes’s base 
lies. Holmes may be simply telling Watson innocently where Barker lives, 
but under the circumstances, he seems to intend it as a dig, as if he needs 
to establish his superiority over a professional rival in any way he can. Yet 
it’s abundantly clear that he has a genuine respect for Barker, and the two 
of them, finding themselves working on the same case, decide to work on it 
together, one of the few times Holmes accepts a partner other than Watson.
Holmes then asks a police detective the rhetorical question, “He has several 
good cases to his credit, has he not, Inspector?” to which the policeman 
gives the same kind of answer you would expect Lestrade or Gregson (or any 
of the other police) to give about Holmes: “He has certainly interfered several 
times.” That’s pure Scotland Yard!
Mr. Leverton: The Pinkerton Detective Agency
In “The Red Circle,” Holmes encounters Scotland Yard detective Gregson 
lurking in the shadows outside a house on a stakeout. Gregson is accompa-
nied by a Mr. Leverton, whom he introduces to Holmes by saying, “This is 
Mr. Leverton, of Pinkerton’s American Agency.”
“The hero of the Long Island cave mystery?” Holmes immediately replies. 
“Sir, I am pleased to meet you.”
Leverton is a Pinkerton agent, and Holmes is well aware of that agency’s 
reputation. It wasn’t the first time he had encountered Pinkerton agents. 
Decades earlier, in The Valley of Fear, Holmes had his first brush with this 
legendary organization.
 
Its full name was the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. Founded in 1850 by 
Allan Pinkerton, this private detective agency gained fame when it foiled a plot 
to assassinate President-elect Lincoln on his way to the inauguration. Lincoln 
was impressed enough to then hire Pinkerton agents as security guards during 
the Civil War.
The agency’s second greatest claim to fame came during periods of labor 
unrest, particularly in the Pennsylvania coal fields of the 19th century. Mine 
owners hired Pinkertons to infiltrate the unions, who were resorting to vio-
lence, to gather evidence against them. This was actually the backdrop of The 
Valley of Fear.

117
 Chapter 6: Cops, Landladies, and Others: The Supporting Characters
It comes as no surprise that Leverton is known to Sherlock Holmes. Holmes 
was a student of crime, and his contacts stretched from Europe to the United 
States. It’s a certainty that Holmes and the Pinkertons were well aware of 
each other.
Mrs. Hudson, the Landlady
221b Baker Street’s cozy domesticity is only fully achieved with the pres-
ence of Mrs. Hudson, the landlady of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. The 
Mrs. Hudson of the stories, however, was more than simply a landlady. Sure, 
she did make sure that breakfast was ready on time or the coffeepot was 
polished. But she did a lot more than that. She was also the gatekeeper to 
the shrine of justice, the person who stood between the street and the Great 
Detective. As such, like Watson, Mrs. Hudson is a vital member of Holmes’s 
team.
 
In Victorian England, life was a lot more like living in a hotel than in a modern 
apartment, and both Holmes and Watson lived like Victorian gentlemen, in 
a world where all the drudgery was taken care of behind the scenes by a 
variety of servants. For more information about life during this period, go to 
Chapter 4.
Servants in Victorian England
In an era before such luxuries as dishwashers 
and microwaves, things that we now take as 
minor tasks had to be done by hand and con-
sumed a great deal more time. Those well off 
enough paid other people to deal with the daily 
necessities of life such as cooking and clean-
ing. In the class-conscious society of Victorian 
England, the master-servant relationship 
reflected that of queen and subject.
A long succession of anonymous servants 
underlies the entire canon, faceless and name-
less, constantly answering doors, delivering 
messages, receiving and delivering visiting 
cards, mending clothing, and running other 
errands.
Even when Watson isn’t living at 221b Baker 
Street, he still has servants to tend to his needs: 
his unnamed valet from “The Final Problem,” 
the maid who brings a telegram to him and his 
wife in “The Boscombe Valley Mystery” and 
the other one who gathers up some evidence 
at Holmes’s request in that same story, and a 
maid named Mary Jane who butchers his shoes 
in “A Scandal in Bohemia.”

118
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Mrs. Hudson described
Everybody knows what Mrs. Hudson looks like, right? She’s the matronly, 
white-haired, pleasantly plump landlady . . . the den-mother of Baker Street, 
isn’t she? But to many readers’ great surprise, Mrs. Hudson is never physi-
cally described in the canon. She is, more often than not, presented more 
as a series of actions than as a person. Mrs. Hudson “came up to lower the 
blinds,” “had the good sense to light the fire,” “entered with the tea and 
coffee,” “appeared with a lady’s card upon her salver,” “brought up a mes-
sage,” and so on. The stories say a lot about what she does, but they don’t 
say whether she’s tall or short, young or old, or anything else about what she 
looks like.
But doing a little math, Mrs. Hudson was not an elderly woman when Holmes 
and Watson moved into Baker Street. Remember, Holmes lived there for 
over 20 years. No, it’s more probable that Mrs. Hudson was middle-aged, 
certainly older than Sherlock and Watson (who were in their mid-20s when 
they met). She was a young widow, probably in her late 30s or 40s. If you fix 
a younger Mrs. Hudson in your mind, suddenly, a woman who not only tol-
erates but actually enjoys the adventure and excitement of her mysterious 
lodgers becomes far more likely. No, it wasn’t an elderly grandmother who 
was crawling around on the floor, moving the wax bust that Holmes placed in 
the window as a decoy for Col. Moran’s air gun. It was a younger, and young 
at heart, Mrs. Hudson who enjoyed the adventure of participating in her ten-
ant’s exploits, especially after the loss of her husband.
Her feelings about Holmes
Her feelings toward Holmes also parallel those of Watson; she “stood in the 
deepest awe of him and never dared to interfere with him, however outra-
geous his proceedings might seem.” In other words, she too recognized in 
Sherlock Holmes something above human law.
For instance, she never protested the constant parade of humanity in and 
out of her house — everyone from dirty, homeless children to murderers to 
kings. Well, maybe the dirty children, as you’ll soon see!
Holmes kept strange hours. Occasionally, there was a struggle, accompanied 
by smashed objects and broken windows. Holmes’s unanswered correspon-
dence was transfixed by a jackknife into the very center of his wooden man-
telpiece. Once, the place was set on fire! And the perpetual mess! Watson 
says that “month after month his papers accumulated until every corner of 
the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account 
to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner.”

119
 Chapter 6: Cops, Landladies, and Others: The Supporting Characters
The catalog of abuses was indeed long. Watson characterizes Mrs. Hudson 
by saying she “was a long-suffering woman.” You know Holmes was special in 
some way to her, as Watson says that “Holmes, in one of his queer humours, 
would sit in an armchair with his hair-trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges 
and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patnotic V. R. done in bullet-
pocks.” There can be no doubt that Watson spoke for Mrs. Hudson when he 
deadpanned, “I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance 
of our room was improved by it.”
That Mrs. Hudson put up with such things can be partially explained by the 
“princely” rent on the rooms. Watson says that he has “no doubt that the 
house might have been purchased at the price which Holmes paid for his 
rooms during the years that I was with him.” Yet there’s a bit more to things, 
it appears, for the good doctor also says that “she was fond of him [Holmes], 
too, for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with 
women.” Just as a portrait of a great friendship emerges between Holmes and 
Watson over the course of the stories, it also becomes apparent that there’s 
real affection between Holmes and Mrs. Hudson.
As I mention earlier, in “The Empty House,” Mrs. Hudson gladly risks her life 
to help capture an assassin who is gunning for Holmes, even to the point of 
putting herself in the line of fire. It’s unlikely that she would do so simply 
for money. It seems more than likely that she was willing to risk her life for 
Holmes because her fondness for him was very deep, indeed.
Who’s the landlady?
“A Scandal in Bohemia” contains a passage 
where, as in so many other stories, Holmes and 
Watson are sitting down to eat in their Baker 
Street rooms. Speaking of their current case, 
Holmes says,
 
 “When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray 
I will make it clear to you. Now,” he said as 
he turned hungrily on the simple fare that 
our landlady had provided, “I must discuss 
it while I eat, for I have not much time.”
These few simple lines would pass unnoticed in 
a dozen Sherlock Holmes stories. After all, there 
was usually a good table set at Baker Street. 
There’s just one question: Who is Mrs. Turner? 
There are about as many explanations for this 
odd passage as there are Sherlockians, some 
more reasonable than others. It’s pretty safe to 
assume that Doyle was just being a trifle sloppy 
here, as he was known to be in other instances, 
but perhaps Mrs. Turner is simply a minor char-
acter, a housemaid whose name just happened 
to be mentioned. After all, the passage doesn’t 
actually say that Mrs. Turner is “our landlady” 
but that the landlady was the one who pro-
vided the meal. For other “mysteries” sprinkled 
throughout the canon, go to Chapter 16.

Pageboys and Urchins
In the universe that Sherlock Holmes had constructed for himself, Watson 
and Mrs. Hudson are like family. But others not only provided useful service 
but also did in fact have a relationship with the Great Detective.
Billy the page
A page or pageboy was what we would today call a “gofer” — a young person 
(always male in those days) employed by both private residences and hotels 
and used for errands and light chores. Billy the page first shows up in the 
novel The Valley of Fear and then reappears by name in “The Mazarin Stone.” 
About a dozen other tales have an unnamed page. In addition to running 
errands, the page also shared a portion of Mrs. Hudson’s gatekeeping, such 
as ushering in clients, as he does in “A Case of Identity.” In that tale, he’s 
identified only as “the boy in buttons,” a colorful bit of phrasing that simply 
meant a uniformed pageboy.
Sherlockians have often just sort of assumed that any mention of a page 
refers to Billy, but given the dates these stories appear, it’s unlikely that it’s 
the same boy. The first pageboy appears in 1889. A page makes his appear-
ance in 1903, and this time he’s identified as Billy. Watson says to him, “It all 
seems very unchanged, Billy. You don’t change, either.”
This is, in one sense, a bit of nonsense; if it was the same boy he would 
certainly have grown to be a man by then. In another sense, though, it’s a 
metaphor for the way that the world had changed so much around Holmes. 
By 1903, the time of horse-drawn travel — even land-bound travel, for that 
matter — was drawing to a close and the reliable comforts of the Victorian 
and Edwardian ages were about to be obliterated by the disaster of World 
War I and the horrors of the 20th century (see Chapter 11 for more on this 
transition to a more modern era). In this sense, Billy was a symbol of an ear-
lier, simpler time and his being frozen in time was a pleasant reassurance.
The Baker Street Irregulars
Sherlock Holmes, no matter how good he was, couldn’t be everywhere at 
once. He needed other eyes from time to time that could see things and 
watch people in places and situations that he couldn’t be in himself. Among 
other assistants, he employed a group of “street Arabs” — the contemporary 
phrasing for homeless children — as his eyes and ears. As he explains to 
Watson, they can “go everywhere, see everything, overhear everyone.”

121
 Chapter 6: Cops, Landladies, and Others: The Supporting Characters
Routinely described as “dirty and ragged,” the Baker Street Irregulars 
reflected a real-life fact of Victorian London. Though many homeless, desti-
tute families lived on the streets of the great city, numerous homeless chil-
dren had also been left to fend for themselves at an early age. Others had run 
away from abusive homes. It was estimated that the metropolis of London 
had 30,000 deserted children.
Many of these destitute children lived by stealing, and the reader can surely 
see the street-savvy Baker Street Irregulars helping themselves to food and 
other necessities. To the respectable Mrs. Hudson and Dr. Watson, they 
must have seemed like a pack of wild animals. The good doctor at one point 
describes their departure as if they were vermin who “scampered away 
downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment 
in the street.” And when they later return, Watson writes, almost with a shud-
der, that “the spokesman of the street Arabs” is a young man named Wiggins.
Holmes, however, is amused by the temporary invasion of his home, even 
though it has caused Mrs. Hudson alarm. He has a simple business arrange-
ment in hand: He hires the “street Arabs” because they can go places he 
can’t. However, in deference to his landlady, he tells Wiggins not to bring the 
whole gang again, but to simply report by himself what the others find out.
 
The sad and simple fact is that these urban poor were invisible to their fellow 
Londoners (see Chapter 4 for more on London society). Thus, they’re the per-
fect spies for Holmes to send out into the city. He pays them each a daily wage 
along with incentives for success.
Wiggins and his band of ragamuffins first appear in A Study in Scarlet (1887). 
In The Sign of the Four (1890), they make a reappearance — a reenactment, 
really, the scene differing only in that a dozen instead of half a dozen street 
urchins invade Baker Street, along with their “disreputable little scarecrow” 
of a leader, Wiggins. Once more, Watson is at a loss to understand what’s 
happening as he “could hear Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a 
wail of expostulation and dismay.” The whole situation gets explained again, 
and Holmes once again tells their leader, “In future they can report to you, 
Wiggins, and you to me. I cannot have the house invaded in this way.”
After The Sign of the Four, the Irregulars dropped out of sight for a few years, 
showing up once more in “The Crooked Man” in 1893, then fading from 
the scene forever. In 1893, Wiggins had been replaced by a leader named 
Simpson; what happened to Wiggins is never revealed.
Although they played a relatively small role in the stories, these street 
urchins turned out to be among the most appealing supporting characters in 
all the canon and are forever part of the overall world of Sherlock Holmes.

Chapter 7
Villains, Victims, and 
Damsels in Distress
In This Chapter
▶ Chronicling the life and exploits of Professor James Moriarty
▶ Rounding up some other canonical criminals
▶ Holmes’s clients: Classifying the victims of crime
O
f course, no detective story can get by without a bad guy and a victim. 
Among the 60 Sherlock Holmes adventures, you’ll find plenty of both. 
A survey of villains and victims spanning the entire canon reveals a lot about 
Sherlock’s career, as well as the world in which he lived and worked.
Perpetrators and victims represent two sides of any crime. With a set of 
stories spanning 40 years, Holmes encounters examples from every class of 
society. On the victim side, everyone from kings to shopkeepers petition the 
Great Detective for help. And the criminal side of the equation represents a 
similar gamut, from petty thieves to the head of a mighty criminal 
organization.
Professor Moriarty: The Anti-Holmes
In his unique role as the world’s first (and at that time only) consulting 
detective, most of the problems, mysteries, and crimes that were referred to 
Holmes were outside the commonplace. And usually, that meant a particu-
larly bad criminal. Of all the crooks in the canon, one towers over the rest: 
Professor James Moriarty.
It’s impossible to even think of Sherlock Holmes without thinking of Professor 
Moriarty, whose very name suggests the idea of death. Who is this incredible 
nemesis who, as Holmes says, “pervades London,” and yet “no one has heard 
of”? Who is this “abstract thinker” with “a brain of the first order”? Seriously, 
just who is this evil criminal genius? Even Watson, Holmes’s closest compan-
ion and ally, never heard of the professor.

124
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Holmes’s suspicions
 
For having such an immense reputation, Professor Moriarty appears in only 
three stories. He is introduced to Watson (and hence the reader) in “The Final 
Problem,” which tells of the deadly encounter between him and Sherlock 
Holmes. Readers find out more about what happened at that showdown in 
“The Empty House,” which recounts Holmes’s return from the dead. Moriarty 
also appears in The Valley of Fear, where he is offstage pulling the strings on 
a revenge murder. (This story is set prior to “The Final Problem.”) But it’s 
that first encounter with Moriarty in “The Final Problem” that stays with the 
reader.
After being absent from Baker Street for three months on a case for “the 
French government upon a matter of supreme importance,” Holmes suddenly 
appears, with bleeding knuckles and a morbid fear of air guns. He’s had a day 
of horror, dodging one assassination attempt after another, and now that he’s 
back, he feels it’s time to come clean to Watson.
No one knows the criminal underworld as well as Holmes does. But as his 
career progresses, Holmes begins to see patterns in criminal activity that 
make him suspicious. “For years past I have continually been conscious of 
some power behind the malefactor,” he tells Watson, “some deep organizing 
power which forever stands in the way of the law, and throws its shield over 
the wrong-doer.”
The extent of this power must be immense. After Holmes realizes the reality 
of it, he sees its malign influence everywhere. “Again and again in cases of 
the most varying sorts — forgery cases, robberies, murders — I have felt the 
presence of this force.” Holmes sees it not only in his own cases, but also, as 
he tells his friend, “I have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered 
crimes in which I have not been personally consulted.”
So who’s in charge of this organization? “You have probably never heard of 
Professor Moriarty?” Holmes asks Watson, who replies with “Never.”
“Ay, there’s the genius and the wonder of the thing!” cries Holmes.
The professor’s illustrious early career
Professor James Moriarty began his extraordinary career as a “man of good 
birth and excellent education.” At an early age young James was “endowed 
by nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty.” He was so advanced in 
mathematics that by the age of 21, “he wrote a treatise upon the binomial 
theorem, which has had a European vogue.”

125
 Chapter 7: Villains, Victims, and Damsels in Distress
On the strength of his work with the binomial theorem, Moriarty won the 
mathematical chair at a small university. At some point during this time, he 
scored a second success with a new publication titled The Dynamics of an 
Asteroid — “a book,” says Holmes, “which ascends to such rarefied heights 
of pure mathematics that there was no man in the scientific press capable of 
criticizing it.”
Truly a genius. As Holmes put it, Moriarty had “a most brilliant career before 
him.” But then something changed.
Scandal leading to a career change
The canon doesn’t reveal which university the brilliant young mathemat-
ics prodigy taught at, but wherever it was, something started to go wrong. 
As Holmes put it, “Dark rumors gathered round him in the university town, 
and eventually he was compelled to resign his chair and to come down to 
London.” Because Holmes provides no further information, readers can only 
speculate what the “dark rumors” were about.
In London, Moriarty set up as an army coach, a sort of private tutor. That’s 
quite a comedown for the celebrated, twice-published professor. The life of 
a private tutor isn’t one destined for riches. The Valley of Fear reveals that 
Moriarty made £700 a year as a university professor — not bad, but certainly 
not an extravagant income. As a tutor, his income had to be even less.
And yet, he had something else going on, because he was able to afford a 
painting by Jean-Baptiste Greuze (see the nearby sidebar). Moriarty also had 
enough money to pay his bills with funds held in six different banks.
And even more shockingly, he paid his right-hand man, Colonel Sebastian 
Moran, an astronomical income of £6,000 a year! “It’s more than the Prime 
Minister gets,” comments Holmes. “That gives you an idea of Moriarty’s gains 
and of the scale on which he works.”
The binomial theorem
The binomial theorem is the result that allows the expansion of a binomial
 
 (a + b)5 = a5 + 5a4b + 10a3b2 + 10a2b3 + 5ab4 + b5
where the coefficients ai are called binomial 
coefficients. Got that? No? Me either. But 
Professor Moriarty did — he was an expert at 
it by the age of 21!

126
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
So what were his “works”? What did this professor with an extraordinary 
brain do? What was he up to in the small university town that made people 
suspicious of him? Why did he need to move to London? Holmes can tell us:
“He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organizer of half that is 
evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city. He is a genius, a 
philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits 
motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thou-
sand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. He does 
little himself. He only plans.”
Professor Moriarty’s criminal business
Organization seems to have been the unique strength that Professor Moriarty 
brought to his criminal organization. There were other crime syndicates, 
Mafia families, and all sorts of criminal gangs prior to the professor, but with 
Moriarty’s unique gift, he was able to create an organization unlike his 
predecessors.
Holmes’s investigation gave him insight into how the business worked. “His 
agents are numerous and splendidly organized,” he tells Watson in “The Final 
Problem.” “If there is a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, we will 
say, a house to be rifled, a man to be removed — the word is passed to the 
professor, the matter is organized and carried out.”
So well organized is Moriarty’s organization that, should something go wrong 
and the perpetrator get caught, money is found for his bail and legal defense. 
“But the central power which uses the agent is never caught,” comments 
Holmes, “never so much as suspected.”
Jean-Baptiste Greuze
Professor Moriarty had good taste in art. The 
French painter Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725–
1805) enjoyed a great reputation during most of 
his lifetime. Both critics and the public greatly 
admired his work, and art collectors sought 
many of his paintings. Most of them were por-
traits of heads and faces, and during his life, 
experts associated him with neoclassicism, a 
late-18th-century and 19th-century movement 
that drew upon the classical art and culture of 
Western civilization. However, art historians 
now see his work as unique. So did the public, 
and by the end of the century, his paintings 
were some of the most popular in the Louvre. 
They also saw record prices at auction. For 
Moriarty to own one was indeed remarkable.

127
 Chapter 7: Villains, Victims, and Damsels in Distress
This incredible criminal system prompted Holmes to call Moriarty, in grudg-
ing admiration, “The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every dev-
iltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might have made 
or marred the destiny of nations.” It was a fearsome, ruthless enterprise. As 
Moriarty himself tells Holmes in their first of only two face-to-face meetings 
(the first was at Baker Street; the second on the ledge over Reichenbach 
Falls): “You stand in the way not merely of an individual but of a mighty 
organization, the full extent of which you, with all your cleverness, have been 
unable to realize.”
And as Holmes tells Watson, “This was the organization which I deduced, 
Watson, and which I devoted my whole energy to exposing and breaking up.”
The idea of “bad blood”
When discussing his own background and heredity, Sherlock Holmes com-
ments that “art in the blood is liable to take the strangest forms.” He’s 
referring to his belief that the artistic traits of his famous Vernet relatives 
(see Chapter 5), a family of French painters, account in part for his (and his 
brother Mycroft’s) uncanny ability at observation and deduction.
In Moriarty, Holmes sees a similar phenomenon at work but in an entirely dif-
ferent direction. Of Moriarty he says, “The man had hereditary tendencies of 
the most diabolical kind. A criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of 
being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his 
extraordinary mental powers.”
Sir Francis Galton
Sir Francis Galton (1822–1911) was an 
immensely influential, English Victorian sci-
entist whose fields of interest and research 
included geography, anthropology, eugenics, 
meteorology, statistics, and, perhaps most 
importantly, genetics.
Galton’s cousin was Charles Darwin, author of 
the landmark The Origin of Species, a work that 
had a significant influence on Galton. Using rig-
orous scientific methodology, Galton embarked 
on a study of human abilities and characteris-
tics, carefully measuring and logging them. This 
revolutionary approach spread rapidly through-
out the social and biological sciences.
Galton researched a large number of prominent 
Victorian men and discovered that most had 
prominent, accomplished relatives, leading him 
to conclude that whatever traits lead to social 
and professional success must run in families. 
(Time and research have shown that inheri-
tance is a much more complicated subject 
than Galton could have imagined, dependent 
on genetics, environment, and other factors.) 
He published his research in two volumes, 
Hereditary Genius (1869) and English Men of 
Science (1874). Hereditary Genius was an espe-
cially influential work.

128
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
 
In both Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty, Arthur Conan Doyle is giving 
a reflection of the Victorian scientific understanding of heredity and genetics. 
That understanding was especially influenced by the work of Sir Francis 
Galton (see the nearby sidebar), a Victorian scientist whose research led him 
to the conclusion that, though individual human ability varied greatly, some 
traits could run strongly within families. Holmes’s statement that “art in the 
blood is liable to take the strangest forms” reveals Galton’s influence on 
Arthur Conan Doyle.
Why Moriarty looms so large
 
No doubt about it, the number one criminal in all of detective fiction is 
Professor James Moriarty. No other master criminal even comes close. And 
yet, despite his legendary reputation, the professor is active in only two actual 
tales in the canon:
 
✓ “The Final Problem” (1893): This is the story in which the “Napoleon of 
crime” is first introduced. Holmes says to his friend Watson, “You have 
probably never heard of Professor Moriarty?” And with that introduc-
tion comes the greatest criminal in literature. What ensues is, in the 
words of Moriarty himself, “a duel between you and me, Mr. Holmes.” Its 
horrifying ending finds the “the most dangerous criminal and the fore-
most champion of the law” locked in each other’s arms, plunging into 
the Reichenbach Falls.
 
✓ The Valley of Fear (1914): In this novel of revenge, set before the 
events of “The Final Problem,” Moriarty provides a valuable consulting 
service to an American bent on murder.
In addition to these two turns, Moriarty’s henchman, Col. Sebastian Moran 
(more about him later), is the villain of “The Empty House,” and then, peri-
odically until the end of his career, Sherlock refers to the “late, lamented 
Professor Moriarty.” (It actually sounds like he misses him!) But with such a 
small number of appearances, why does Moriarty loom so large? For two rea-
sons, which I discuss in the following sections.
Absence makes the heart grow (in this case) more fearful
The first reason for Moriarty’s prominence in the Holmes stories is the 
theory of absence. Moriarty’s absence doesn’t diminish his status — it actu-
ally enhances it. The professor is a sort of Sherlockian boogeyman, haunting 
the stories through to the end of the canon. Indeed, his attraction is so great 
that writers and filmmakers simply can’t resist including him.
Think about it: Moriarty is like some kind of ghost, and few but Sherlock 
Holmes himself have ever laid eyes on him. In “The Final Problem,” Moriarty 
pays a visit to Holmes at Baker Street, but readers only get the account of the 
visit secondhand, from Holmes himself.

129
 Chapter 7: Villains, Victims, and Damsels in Distress
Later, when Watson and Holmes are fleeing the professor on the train, 
Watson only sees “a tall man pushing his way furiously through the crowd, 
and waving his hand as if he desired to have the train stopped.” It was 
Watson’s only glimpse of the Napoleon of crime. “It was too late . . . for we 
were rapidly gathering momentum, and an instant later had shot clear of the 
station.”
And then later, the tragic, fatal encounter on the ledge of the Reichenbach 
Falls happens only after Watson has been lured away. When the doctor 
returns, all he finds is Holmes’s walking stick and a note.
In The Valley of Fear, Moriarty’s involvement, as serious and fatal as it is, is 
entirely offstage. He’s there, behind the scenes, pulling the strings on a grisly 
crime.
We often fear most that which we can’t see. That’s why a filmmaker cuts 
away just as the killer strikes. The viewer’s imagination is often worse than 
whatever the filmmaker would show. That fear of what we can’t see is what 
causes us to sleep with the lights on. It also helps explain Moriarty’s towering 
reputation.
 
In Nicholas Meyers’s novel The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (and the movie of the 
same name), Professor Moriarty is treated as an innocent man who had been 
Sherlock Holmes’s math tutor when he was a boy. The title refers to Holmes’s 
preferred dosage of injected cocaine, and the whole confrontation between 
the Great Detective and his arch-nemesis is reduced to a drug-induced halluci-
nation, a self-made prison from which Sigmund Freud frees him (see Chapter 2 
for more on Holmes’s drug use).
The Sherlockian doppelgänger
The second reason for Moriarty’s grip on the imagination is that he’s the 
Sherlockian doppelgänger. A doppelgänger is, in legend, a person’s disturb-
ing, ghostly double. The word is German, meaning “double walker,” and when 
a doppelgänger appears, either to the person it’s mirroring or to his family, 
it’s regarded as a harbinger of bad luck, illness, danger, or even death — 
especially when a person and his doppelgänger come face to face.
Holmes, “the foremost champion of the law,” and Moriarty, the world’s “most 
dangerous criminal,” are mirror opposites, as physically similar as they are 
morally different. Both are tall and thin, with a receding hairline (see Figure 
7-1). Yet Moriarty’s “face protrudes forward and is forever slowly oscillating 
from side to side in a curiously reptilian fashion,” and he is stooped. Holmes 
stands straight.
Whereas Holmes is a consultant to the law, Moriarty is a consultant to the 
underworld of crime. Whereas Holmes breaks the law for the sake of justice, 
Moriarty breaks it for the sake of personal profit. Whereas Holmes brings 
peace and safety to the world, Moriarty fills it with terror and tragedy.

130

Illustration by Sidney Paget, The Strand Magazine.
Holmes himself gives hints throughout the canon that Moriarty is his dop-
pelgänger and that he is Moriarty’s doppelgänger as well. As I mention 
earlier, Holmes does break the law on more than one occasion, and though 
he does it for virtuous ends, he admits to the lure of a life of crime. “I don’t 
mind confessing,” he once told Watson, “that I have always had an idea that 
I would have made a highly efficient criminal.” There’s no doubt, even in his 
own mind, that Holmes would bring the same degree of organization and effi-
ciency to the business that his nemesis does.
 
Doyle built up the character of Moriarty as the opposite of Holmes in “The 
Final Problem” because he wanted to kill off his detective and concentrate on 
other books he was more interested in writing (see Chapter 3). To give the 
Great Detective a fitting sendoff, the agent of his departure from our world 
had to have a certain stature of his own; it just wouldn’t have been plausible 
for Holmes to be killed by a lesser man.
The real-life inspiration for Moriarty
Just as Sherlock Holmes was modeled on one of Doyle’s real-life medical 
school professors, Dr. Joseph Bell (for more on Bell, see Chapter 2), Professor 
Moriarty had real-life inspiration as well. In the case of the Napoleon of crime, 
he seems to have been an amalgamation of several sources.

131
 Chapter 7: Villains, Victims, and Damsels in Distress
Adam Worth
 
There can be no doubt that the German-American criminal Adam Worth was a 
prototype for Moriarty. Worth was actually given the nickname “the Napoleon 
of the criminal world” by Scotland Yard. Furthermore, Arthur Conan Doyle 
himself confirmed it.
Worth was born in 1844 in Prussia. His family was Jewish, and they emigrated 
to America when Worth was 5, landing in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Worth 
left home in 1854 and held a variety of jobs until the Civil War broke out. At 
the age of 17, he enlisted in the Union Army and was eventually promoted 
to sergeant. He was then wounded at Bull Run and sent to a hospital in 
Washington, DC. While recovering from his wounds, he discovered that he 
had been listed as “killed in action.” He immediately left the hospital.
Worth then began a pattern of reenlisting in the army under an assumed 
name, getting paid, and then deserting his new unit. Ultimately, this brought 
him to the attention of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, which the govern-
ment hired to investigate this kind of fraud. Worth fled to New York City 
when the Pinkertons got on his trail.
It was there that Worth embarked on a life of crime in earnest, starting as a 
pickpocket. He became the leader of a gang of pickpockets, which led to even 
more organized crimes, including robberies and burglaries. Eventually, he 
was caught and sent to Sing Sing prison, but he escaped after only a couple of 
weeks!
Worth went into partnership with Fredericka Mandelbaum, a well-known 
criminal organizer. Together they grew the business, expanding into bank 
robberies, but eventually, Worth went out on his own. On November 20, 
1869, he tunneled into the underground vault of a Boston bank, starting from 
the basement of a neighboring store. (This is the exact scenario that the vil-
lains use in “The Red-Headed League,” again showing that Doyle was well 
acquainted with the career of Adam Worth!) When the bank hired the fear-
some Pinkertons to track the criminals, Worth moved to Europe with Charley 
Bullard, a safecracker colleague.
Over the years, Bullard and Worth took various names and identities as they 
moved through Europe robbing, pickpocketing, and pulling heists. They 
eventually landed in Paris, where they opened a restaurant and bar, which 
also featured gambling on an upper floor. Gambling, of course, was illegal, 
but that didn’t deter Worth. Eventually, after numerous raids by the police, 
the place got too hot and Worth moved to London.
Adam Worth worked his way into London society while forming a new crimi-
nal organization devoted to larger, more serious robberies. But Scotland 
Yard took notice of the group’s activities, and a series of bad breaks began to 
undo Worth and his crime syndicate.

132
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Then, in 1876, came a career-defining crime. Worth stole a famous Thomas 
Gainsborough painting, Georgiana Duchess of Devonshire, which had been 
hanging in a prominent London art gallery. However, instead of selling it, 
Worth decided to keep it. With the Pinkertons and Scotland Yard on his trail, 
Worth left England, traveled the world, kept financing himself through theft, 
got married, and had children, all the while keeping the Gainsborough paint-
ing with him. Finally, he returned to New York, painting in hand. Just like 
Moriarty in The Valley of Fear, he had a stolen masterpiece in his possession.
After further criminal adventures, Worth was eventually arrested in Belgium 
after a botched robbery, and he stood trial on March 20, 1893. He was found 
guilty and sent to prison, and he was released in 1897 for good behavior. 
Worth then met William Pinkerton, of the very agency that had pursued him 
for decades. In a strange turn of events, Worth related the story of his col-
orful, crime-filled life, and Pinkerton turned his notes of the account into a 
book.
After meeting with Pinkerton, Worth returned the stolen Duchess of 
Devonshire to the gallery that he had stolen it from years before, but not 
before he received $25,000 for it! Worth then returned to London with his 
children, where he died on January 8, 1902. In an odd twist, Worth’s son later 
went on to become a Pinkerton agent himself!
Jonathan Wild
Doyle compares Moriarty, in The Valley of Fear, to the real-life 18th-century 
criminal mastermind, Jonathan Wild. Wild lived about a century before the 
Holmes stories, and he was quite a colorful character who was written about 
by both Henry Fielding (The History of the Life of the Late Mr. Jonathan Wild 
the Great) and Daniel Defoe (The True and Genuine Account of the Life and 
Actions of the Late Jonathan Wild).
Wild lived in the days before England had a police force, and the government 
relied on civilian bounty hunters, or “thief-takers,” to curb serious crime. 
Wild was the premier thief-taker of his time and earned a handsome living 
while making himself into a public folk hero.
What the public didn’t know, however, was that Wild was himself the mas-
termind behind a great deal of the crime in London. Although he provided 
a variety of services to the criminal community, he specialized in fencing 
stolen goods. He developed the technique of hiring thieves to steal specific 
items and then ransoming those items back to the victims. Those grateful 
souls actually believed him to be a hero akin to Sherlock Holmes, a paladin 
who sniffed out the guilty and recovered his clients’ lost goods from them. 
But his activities as a thief-taker were simply his own way of eliminating the 
competition — he turned in anyone who didn’t work for him and protected 
his hirelings.

133
 Chapter 7: Villains, Victims, and Damsels in Distress
He eventually fell afoul of the law and, after years of successfully living his 
double life, ended on the gallows. Despite his long career as the premier 
crime lord of London, he was convicted only of conspiring to steal £40 worth 
of lace, intending to sell it back to its owner.
In The Valley of Fear, Holmes sums up the identity between the real criminal 
mastermind and the fictional one when he says to Dr. Watson: “Everything 
comes in circles — even Professor Moriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden 
force of the London criminals, to whom he sold his brains and his organiza-
tion on a fifteen per cent commission. The old wheel turns, and the same 
spoke comes up. It’s all been done before, and will be again.”
Other candidates
It’s believed that Doyle used other people in creating Moriarty, and he’s 
known to have used his former school, Stonyhurst College, as inspiration for 
many details of the Holmes series. In the case of Moriarty, Stonyhurst may 
have provided the Reverend Thomas Shay. Shay was the prefect of discipline 
at Stonyhurst, and it’s said that the Stonyhurst priests instantly thought of 
Father Shay when they read the description of Moriarty.
Later, during his life and medical practice in Portsmouth, Doyle made the 
acquaintance of a Rev. James Moriarty, who may have at least lent his name 
to Doyle’s character.
And finally, in 2000, Professor Franco Eugeni, a mathematician from the 
University of Teramo in Italy, discovered an old letter referring to a relatively 
obscure mathematician of Doyle’s time named James Moriarty who did 
some work on the binomial theorem, just as Doyle’s Professor Moriarty did. 
(Interestingly, the real-life James Moriarty had an older brother who was a 
railway employee, much like Doyle’s literary Moriarty, and a younger brother 
who was involved in the London criminal element.)
Moriarty’s minions
The greatest criminal mastermind didn’t exist in a vacuum, of course, any 
more than Holmes himself did (see Chapter 6 for more on Holmes’s support-
ing cast). He had both family and hirelings to help him.
The Moriarty brothers
Professor Moriarty had at least two brothers. In The Valley of Fear, an 
unnamed younger Moriarty brother “is a station master in the west of 
England.” Although the stationmaster is never named, it would be a strange 
career path for a high-ranking army officer to become master of a train sta-
tion, so it’s safe to assume that James is probably the older brother. Then, in 
“The Final Problem,” Moriarty is defended in the press by his other brother, 
Colonel James Moriarty.

134
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
Why two children in the same family should be named James is anyone’s 
guess, but it appears to be a simple slip of the kind that Doyle made through-
out the Holmes stories. When Professor Moriarty is first introduced in “The 
Final Problem,” Doyle provides no first name for him, although his brother is 
called James Moriarty. When “The Empty House” appeared many years later, 
Doyle called the arch-criminal James, too, apparently forgetting that he had 
already used the name James for Moriarty’s sibling. But the reality of the situ-
ation is not nearly as fun as what many Sherlockians prefer to believe — that 
because two of the three brothers are named James, the third must be as well!
Henchmen
Readers are granted only the slightest glimpse of Moriarty’s gang. In “The 
Final Problem,” Holmes relates how, as he “went out about midday to trans-
act some business,” he was nearly run down by a two-horse van that, as he 
puts it, “was furiously driven” and that “whizzed round and was on me like a 
flash.” Holmes “sprang for the foot-path and saved [himself] by the fraction 
of a second.”
Later that same day, as Holmes walked down Vere Street, a brick from the 
roof of one of the houses fell and shattered at his feet. Clearly, Moriarty had 
minions everywhere.
In the story “The Empty House,” Holmes says of one of Moriarty’s lookouts (a 
“sentinel,” actually) that he is “a harmless enough fellow, Parker by name, a 
garroter by trade, and a remarkable performer upon the jew’s-harp.”
 
A garrote is a tool for strangling people, usually made from a rope or chain. It’s 
odd that Holmes should speak of the professional assassin who was expert in 
its use as “harmless,” but undoubtedly, relative to the horrors of the deadly 
air gun, a run-of-the-mill garroter seems harmless!
Beyond this, the only major player is Colonel Sebastian Moran. Moran is a 
key figure in Holmes’s saga and is described as Moriarty’s chief of staff: “I 
happen to know who is the first link in his [Moriarty’s] chain — a chain with 
this Napoleon-gone-wrong at one end, and a hundred broken fighting men, 
pickpockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the other, with every sort of 
crime in between. His chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian Moran, as aloof and 
guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself.”
In short, Doyle sets the colonel up as a nasty villain, “the second most dan-
gerous man in London.” Moran was a hit man and a card cheater, but he was 
never convicted of any of these crimes. In fact, Moran didn’t end up on the 
gallows as Holmes predicted — even after the Great Detective caught him 
red-handed trying to kill him with several police officers as witnesses (one 
assumes that the colonel had a very good lawyer). This skilled assassin is 
referred to in “The Illustrious Client” as still living and “dangerous” eight 
years after he was arrested (see Figure 7-2) for trying to kill Holmes in “The 
Empty House.”

Doyle’s description of Moran is that of a typical shikari, or tiger hunter, in the 
India of the British Empire, “once of Her Majesty’s Indian Army, and the best 
heavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced.” Moran “was 
always a man of iron nerve, and the story is still told in India how he crawled 
down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger.”
So Moran is, on the surface, a pillar of the British Empire. “This is astonish-
ing,” says Watson after reading Moran’s biography in Holmes’s notebook. 
“The man’s career is that of an honorable soldier!” Holmes responds by 
saying that “it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the 
Reichenbach ledge.”
Other Unsavory Characters
Of course, the canon is full of criminals other than Moriarty and his hench-
men. Their crimes run the gamut from running an entire criminal syndicate to 
crimes of passion to justifiable homicide. Here’s just a sampling of canonical 
criminals:

136
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
 
✓ Enoch Drebber, Joseph Stangerson, and Jefferson Hope: Though 
Drebber and Stangerson are both murdered at the hands of Jefferson 
Hope, there’s no doubt that they’re villains. In the flashback of A Study in 
Scarlet, they kidnap Lucy Ferrier, murder her father, and force her into a 
marriage that causes her to die of a broken heart. Right out of the gate, 
Doyle produces a tale in which the guilt of the killer, Jefferson Hope, is 
more ambiguous than it seems at first glance.
 
✓ John Clay: Canonical criminals come from all levels of society. “The 
Red-Headed League” contains one of the most colorful. John Clay, whose 
grandfather was a royal duke, has a fine Eton and Oxford education. 
Upon his arrest, he announces, “I have royal blood in my veins. Have the 
goodness, also, when you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’” 
Despite his upbringing and social advantages, in the end he’s nothing 
more than a forger, a thief, and a con man — or even a murderer as 
necessity demands.
 
✓ James Windibank, a.k.a. Hosmer Angel: Though he doesn’t techni-
cally commit any crimes, James Windibank is one of the most repre-
hensible villains in the canon. In “A Case of Identity,” he schemes with 
his wife, assumes a disguise, and starts dating his stepdaughter, Mary 
Sutherland. Taking the name of Hosmer Angel, he causes the poor, near-
sighted woman to fall in love, only to vanish on their wedding day. Miss 
Sutherland promises to wait for her missing fiancé, all so that the par-
ents can keep control of her money. “The law cannot, as you say, touch 
you,” says Holmes to the unrepentant man, “yet there never was a man 
who deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a 
friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders.” And then Holmes 
nearly did just that!
 
✓ John Turner: In “The Boscombe Valley Mystery,” after an early life of 
crime in Australia, John Turner went to England to lead a quiet life. 
However, once there he endures years of being blackmailed by someone 
who knows his shameful past. Finally, when his tormentor demands that 
Turner’s daughter marry his son, Turner turns to murder. “God help us!” 
says Holmes after hearing the man’s confession. “Why does fate play 
such tricks with poor, helpless worms?”
 
✓ Dr. Grimesby Roylott: “The Speckled Band” features a truly outstanding 
bad guy, Dr. Grimesby Roylott, another evil stepfather. When he’s forced 
to leave India after killing a man, Roylott brings an explosive temper 
home to England, where he terrorizes the neighborhood and begins 
murdering his stepdaughters for their money. “When a doctor does go 
wrong he is the first of criminals,” Holmes tells Watson. “He has nerve 
and he has knowledge.”
 
✓ Wilson Kemp: Torture, starvation, asphyxiation . . . these are the partic-
ular tools of Wilson Kemp, the terrible villain of “The Greek Interpreter.” 
His thick glasses and “nervous, jerky fashion” of speaking, punctuated 
with “little giggling laughs,” makes him even more terrifying.

137
 Chapter 7: Villains, Victims, and Damsels in Distress
 
✓ Biddle, Hayward, Moffat, Sutton, and Tobin: These are the names of 
the Worthingdon bank gang from “The Resident Patient.” When robbing 
the bank, this group of criminals murders a guard in cold blood. There’s 
no honor among thieves, however, as Sutton turns state’s evidence and 
testifies against his fellow crooks, sending them to prison in exchange 
for his own freedom. Unfortunately, his old mates eventually leave him 
dangling from the end of a rope.
 
✓ Jack Stapleton: A true all-star canonical criminal, Jack Stapleton is the 
evil manipulator behind The Hound of the Baskervilles. His sins are many — 
murder, spousal abuse, animal abuse, and even promising marriage in 
order to manipulate a poor, lonely woman to further his plan. But read-
ers should begrudgingly give credit where credit is due — using the 
legend of the hound of the Baskervilles was a stroke of genius!
 
✓ Charles Augustus Milverton: “I’ve had to do with fifty murderers in my 
career, but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which I have 
for this fellow.” So says Holmes of the master blackmailer, Charles 
Augustus Milverton, from the story of the same name. Holmes makes 
it perfectly clear how low he regards Milverton: “I would ask you,” he 
says, “how could one compare the ruffian, who in hot blood bludgeons 
his mate, with this man, who methodically and at his leisure tortures 
the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen 
money-bags?”
 
✓ Abe Slaney: Just as Holmes’s professional ties stretch to the United 
States, so do the criminals he deals with. In “The Dancing Men,” Abe 
Slaney is a Chicago gangster obsessed with regaining an old girlfriend — 
so obsessed that he travels all the way to England to woo her back. Only 
problem is, he doesn’t realize that shooting her husband isn’t a good 
approach.
 
✓ Jack Woodley: Surely one of the most disgusting crooks in all the canon 
is Roaring Jack Woodley, found in “The Solitary Cyclist.” A “coarse, 
puffy-faced, red-moustached young man, with his hair plastered down 
on each side of his forehead,” Woodley was constantly coming on to 
Violet Smith, music teacher to the daughter of Woodley’s friend, Bob 
Carruthers. “Mr. Woodley seemed to me to be a most odious person,” 
she confides to Holmes. Too bad, because she ends up marrying him at 
gunpoint!
 
✓ Boss McGinty and the Scowers: For sheer scope, these guys from The 
Valley of Fear are nearly unrivaled. The Scowers, with their bearded, 
brutal leader Boss McGinty, held an entire region of Pennsylvania in 
their evil grip. Part crime syndicate, part terrorist organization, this 
twisted fraternity had business owners, politicians, and police under 
their thumb. Torture, intimidation, and cold-blooded murder were their 
methods of choice.

138
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
 
✓ Jim Browner: If ever there was a murderer in the canon that evokes 
pity rather than horror, Jim Browner of “The Cardboard Box” is him. 
With an evil, scheming sister-in-law and an unfaithful wife, poor, haunted 
Browner is practically driven to murder. “I have to make a clean breast 
of it all,” he confesses to Holmes. “You can hang me, or do what you like 
with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been punished already. I 
cannot shut my eyes but I see those two faces staring at me . . . I killed 
them quick, but they are killing me slow; and if I have another night of it 
I shall be either mad or dead before morning.” And then, just as Holmes 
prepares to leave, Browner asks, “You won’t put me alone into a cell, 
sir? For pity’s sake don’t, and may you be treated in your day of agony 
as you treat me now.”
 
✓ Von Bork: In “His Last Bow,” Sherlock Holmes’s final case, the arrogant 
German spy Von Bork brags about the dim, hoodwinked English as he 
prepares to return to Germany on the eve of World War I. He’s satisfied 
that he has gained valuable information to help win the war, but little 
does he know that, for two years, Holmes has been working against him. 
Boy, is he in for a big surprise!
An all-star lineup of bad guys
Which villains did Sherlock Holmes believe 
were the standouts of his time? In making a 
“most memorable” list as defined by the Great 
Detective himself, Holmes repeatedly uses the 
device of labeling a character in a very spe-
cific way, with the typical description style 
constructed like this: “The [adjective]-[person 
type] in [location].” For example, Holmes may 
have labeled someone “the most notorious 
burglar in England.” With this in mind, here’s 
a pretty definitive list of who, according to 
Sherlock himself, are the outstanding villains in 
the canon:
 1. Professor Moriarty: “The greatest schemer 
of all time.”
 2. Sir George Burnwell: “One of the most dan-
gerous men in Europe.”
 3. Charles Augustus Milverton: “The most 
dangerous man in London” as well as “the 
worst man in London.”
 4. Col. Sebastian Moran: “The second most 
dangerous man in London.”
 5. Alec Cunningham: “The most accomplished 
swindler in Europe.”
 6. Abe Slaney: “The most dangerous crook in 
Chicago.”
 7. Pietro Venucci: “One of the greatest cut-
throats in London.”
 8. John Clay: “The fourth smartest man in 
London” and “the third most daring man in 
London.”
 9. Baron Adelbert Gruner: “The aristocrat of 
crime.”

139
 Chapter 7: Villains, Victims, and Damsels in Distress
Victorian Victims: The Clients 
of Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock Holmes was the court of last resort for the most perplexed people 
in England. They came to him for a variety of reasons. Perhaps they were the 
victim of a crime, like robbery or fraud, or maybe they had an utterly inex-
plicable experience that left them frightened and confused. Sometimes they 
just needed advice from someone well-known for “knowing things that others 
don’t.” And even, on one or two occasions, they came to him because they 
just needed someone to confess to.
 
The victims of crime in the canon often offer as much insight into the world of 
Sherlock Holmes, the culture of Victorian England, and human nature itself as 
the criminals do. Doyle’s deft touch at character creation infuses them with 
depth and believability.
Holmes’s clients are an eclectic array, coming from every spectrum of 
society. In the early days, Holmes’s clientele came from the mostly lower 
and middle classes and the police, but as his fame and reputation grew, so 
did the status of those who came to Baker Street for help. Throughout the 
stories, Holmes occasionally name-drops the king, the pope, a government 
official, and sometimes even the government itself, which has used his ser-
vices. Wealthier clients often bestow great rewards upon him, but the Great 
Detective doesn’t take these cases for the money. Nor does he turn away a 
poor man or woman.
“I play the game for the game’s own sake,” he says. It’s the problem that 
draws his attention, not the profit. If your problem presents a strange puzzle 
that needs the application of a brilliant mind to solve, then Holmes will take 
your case.
Their dilemmas
 
Though most mystery stories today deal with murder, only around half of 
Holmes’s cases dealt with murder (or attempted murder). The subjects of 
the remainder range from kidnapping to fraud to theft to the occasional 
odd offense such as illegal medical experiments or other offbeat situations. 
Because Sir Arthur took such odd roads, the stories have never failed to cap-
ture their audience. The tales have the ring of truth because they often reflect 
real life. Doyle instinctively knew that the smallest, most unusual circum-
stance can offer the opportunity for mystery.

140
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
For instance, in “A Case of Identity,” Holmes delivers a little speech to 
Watson about the odd dilemmas and situations that life can present, and 
these are undoubtedly Doyle’s own views, spoken by his detective:
“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire 
in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely stranger than anything 
which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the 
things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could 
fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently 
remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the 
strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful 
chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most 
outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and fore-
seen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.”
Despite the stories being set in a much earlier time, with sensibilities that are 
in some cases quite different than today, many of the crimes and the victims 
are timeless. Sometimes, the client has a secret and faces blackmail, as is the 
case in “A Scandal in Bohemia,” a socially devastating possibility then and 
now. Many of the victims can be classified in broad categories. Some of the 
more unusual include the following.
Damsels in distress
This category is particularly rich in the Holmes stories. Doyle’s own sisters 
were forced into work as governesses by dire family finances, making him 
keenly aware of the vulnerability of financially desperate women. Many exam-
ples of this show up in the tales.
 
✓ Violet Hunter: In “The Copper Beeches,” Violet Hunter is in dire finan-
cial circumstances and takes a job as governess to a strange family. 
They offer her a salary far greater than the market rate. She says, “You 
may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer 
seemed almost too good to be true.” It was.
 
✓ Lady Francis Carfax: “One of the most dangerous classes in the world,” 
says Holmes in “The Adventure of Lady Francis Carfax,” is “the drifting 
and friendless woman . . . She is helpless. She is migratory . . . She is a 
stray chicken in a world of foxes.” Lady Francis Carfax is such a woman, 
and just as Holmes says, she becomes prey to a terrible con man.
 
✓ Violet Smith: “The Solitary Cyclist” is a tale of a woman who is stalked 
by a bearded man on a bicycle. The young music teacher Violet Smith 
(again in financial straits and lured by a large paycheck) accepts the job 
and goes to work in an isolated country home. There she falls prey to 
the advances of two unscrupulous criminals, and they decide to force 
her into marriage, with the groom determined by a card game.

141
 Chapter 7: Villains, Victims, and Damsels in Distress
Victims of bad karma
It’s common in the Sherlockian canon to find, when a case is solved, that the 
murder victim gets what’s coming to him. Though the stories don’t exactly 
condone murder, it’s sometimes hard for the reader (and occasionally 
Holmes and Watson as well) to muster much sympathy for the victim.
 
✓ Charles McCarthy: In “The Boscombe Valley Mystery,” Charles 
McCarthy spends decades blackmailing his victim, until one day the 
victim strikes back, killing his tormentor. “I did it, Mr. Holmes,” the killer 
confesses. “I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned, I have led a life 
of martyrdom to atone for it.”
 
✓ Mr. Blessington: One of the best examples of bad karma coming back on 
someone is in “The Resident Patient.” Mr. Blessington thinks he’s gotten 
away with letting his fellow bank robbers take the fall. That is, until he’s 
woken up in the middle of the night by a noose around his neck.
 
✓ Giuseppe Gorgiano: “The Red Circle” offers the story of brutal Mafia 
chief Giuseppe Gorgiano, who sets his sights on a younger man’s wife. 
When the couple flees Italy for London, Gorgiano follows. The message? 
Don’t mess with another man’s wife.
Robbery victims
Even this classic set of victims offers up some oddities. But keep in mind, 
only the strange ones come to Sherlock Holmes. Examples include
 
✓ Alexander Holder: In “The Beryl Coronet,” Mr. Holder, of the banking 
firm of Holder & Stevenson, has taken what sounds like one of the crown 
jewels as collateral on a loan. Uh-oh . . . someone has broken off the 
jewels!
 
✓ The Countess of Morcar: The fabulous jewel known as the blue carbun-
cle already has a sinister history. “There have been two murders, a 
vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies,” says Holmes, 
“brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized 
charcoal.” The current owner is the countess of Morcar — that is, until 
the jewel is stolen from her hotel room, only to be swallowed by a goose!
Victims of fraud
Many of Holmes’s clients come with baffling tales recounting some mysteri-
ous experience they’ve had — something so out of the orbit of their normal 
lives that it’s a true mystery. In the end, it often turns out to be a case of 
fraud. For instance:

142
Part II: What a Bunch of Characters! 
 
✓ Victor Hatherley: In “The Engineer’s Thumb,” Victor Hatherley, a young 
hydraulic engineer, is hired to go in the middle of the night to fix a 
broken hydraulic press. Upon his arrival, he realizes that all is not what 
it seems. Let’s just say he has a hard time thumbing a ride back to the 
city!
 
✓ Hall Pycroft: “The Stockbroker’s Clerk” is the story of Hall Pycroft, 
who accepts an unexpected job offer as the business manager of the 
Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Ltd., “with a hundred and thirty-
four branches in the towns and villages of France, not counting one in 
Brussels and one in San Remo.” It seems too good to be true. And it is.

Part III
Holmes and His 
Adventures

In this part . . .
I
n addition to the many characters found in the 
canon, the Sherlock Holmes stories are rich in both 
atmosphere and history. The tales provide a window into 
the Victorian age, a time of gaslight, fog, and hansom 
cabs. This part looks at the elements that make up the 
“typical” Sherlock Holmes story. I also discuss the most 
famous Holmes novel of them all, The Hound of the 
Baskervilles, and I examine common themes found 
throughout the 60 stories. 

Chapter 8
The “Typical” 
Sherlock Holmes Story
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the common elements of Doyle’s novels
▶ Identifying some of the typical tropes of Doyle’s short stories
▶ Exploring 221b Baker Street
T
he Sherlockian canon consists of two styles of story — the novel and the 
short story. Generally speaking, each is a distinct form of storytelling. 
The novel allows an author to develop his plot over a longer period of time 
and has space for subplots, numerous characters, and intricate plotting. The 
short story, on the other hand, typically provides a tighter-paced, plot-driven 
experience with little time for character development.
At least that’s the conventional wisdom. However, when it comes to Sherlock 
Holmes, things aren’t always what you may expect. Both the Sherlock Holmes 
novels and the short stories often contradict the generalizations that are 
normally associated with the respective forms. For example, novels typi-
cally have subplots woven in the main story, but none of the Holmes novels 
employs this device. And conversely, short stories are generally light on 
character development, but character development is Arthur Conan Doyle’s 
greatest strength as a writer. The result is that the Holmes stories are full of 
deftly drawn characterizations that live and breathe on the page.
 
Doyle’s novels and short stories share a number of characteristics, but each 
form also has elements that are distinctly its own. This isn’t to say that the 
structure and style of Doyle’s novels and stories are without consistency — 
they just have their own set of “typical” elements that, with some exceptions, 
Doyle uses repeatedly.

146
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
The Long of It: The Novels
Sherlock Holmes was intended to be a creature of the detective novel. 
Indeed, the first two Holmes stories make up two of the four novels in the 
Sherlockian canon. It wasn’t until Doyle had the brain wave of magazine pub-
lication that the Great Detective moved to the short story.
 
Most Sherlockians believe that the canonical novels are less successful than 
the short stories, but this isn’t true. They aren’t less successful; they’re just 
different. Each form has its own set of unique virtues and limitations. In addi-
tion to having plots and stories that play out over a greater number of pages, 
the longer-form books introduce vital information that helps readers better 
understand the history and nature of the characters.
A quick rundown of the longer tales
Of the four novels, I can say the following: One is a landmark, one is a perfect 
Sherlock Holmes story, one is an acknowledged masterpiece, and one is an 
underappreciated gem.
 
Although the Holmes adventures first appeared in the form of novels, despite 
their popularity and quality, the reputation and fame of Sherlock Holmes 
exploded when Doyle’s creation debuted in The Strand Magazine in 1891 with 
“A Scandal in Bohemia.”
A Study in Scarlet
Written in 1887 when Doyle was only 27, this is the first recorded adventure 
of Sherlock Holmes. (For more on the history of this novel’s publication, see 
Chapter 2.) It not only introduced Holmes to the reading public and began his 
enduring partnership with his friend and companion, Dr. John H. Watson, but 
also established many of the conventions that appear throughout the entire 
run of the stories.
 
The original title of the book was A Tangled Skein . . . not a bad title, but not as 
good as what Doyle changed it to. At one point early in the book, Holmes tells 
Watson, “there’s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colorless 
skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch 
of it.” Holmes also describes the case of murder they’re investigating as his 
“study in scarlet.”
A Study in Scarlet is really a two-part work. (I discuss this feature in more 
detail in the later section “The novel elements of the novels.”)

147
 Chapter 8: The “Typical” Sherlock Holmes Story
 
✓ The first half is Dr. Watson’s first-person account of his unfortunate mili-
tary experience, his introduction to Sherlock Holmes and how they came 
to share lodgings, and the investigation into the mysterious murder of a 
man in an abandoned house who is found with the word “RACHE” writ-
ten in blood on a nearby wall. It is Watson’s first case with Holmes.
 
✓ Part two of the book is a flashback that gives the back story to the inves-
tigation in London. This flashback takes readers to the U.S. and tells a 
tale set in Mormon Utah during the time of Brigham Young. It provides a 
motive for the London murders and is a thrilling tale in its own right.
Following the flashback, the story returns to London, with Holmes clearing 
up any lingering questions about the mystery and tying the two parts of the 
book together.
A close, honest reading of A Study in Scarlet reveals that, though it’s an enter-
taining, landmark book, Doyle was still maturing as a writer. For instance, it’s 
hard to imagine the writer of The Strand Magazine short stories or The Hound 
of the Baskervilles resorting to the strained plot device of having an actor 
impersonate an old woman right there on Baker Street in order to get back 
Lucy’s ring. Doyle had written himself into a corner, and many readers have 
cringed at his solution for getting out of it. It’s the kind of clumsy moment 
that rarely, if ever, happens in his writing again. When compared with the 
brilliance Doyle would attain in just another year or two with The Sign of the 
Four, his lack of maturation as a writer is easier to see.
The Sign of the Four
Published complete in Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine in February 1890, The 
Sign of the Four was more successful financially than its predecessor. Given 
its unusual origins (it was commissioned by the publisher of Lippincott’s), it 
easily could have been the final adventure of Sherlock Holmes. But then, this 
was before Doyle switched to writing short stories.
The Sign of the Four is a romance as much as a mystery. It has everything: 
swirling fog, a fortune in treasure, a chase, Holmes’s cocaine use, and even 
a damsel in distress. Each year on the anniversary of her father’s death, 
Miss Mary Morstan receives a beautiful pearl in the mail from an anonymous 
sender. One day she is told to come and meet the sender, and being young 
and uncertain, she turns to Holmes and Watson. What follows is a wild chase 
through London, with blowguns, cannibalistic pygmies, a one-legged man, 
and a thrilling boat chase on the Thames. This is followed by a flashback 
to the Indian uprising — the first example in the canon of a tragedy in the 
British Empire coming home to England.
It’s unlikely that Doyle was making a conscious statement about the empire. 
It’s far more likely that he was simply reflecting the sentiment held by most 
of his fellow countrymen — that the farther you travel out into the empire, 
the more dangerous it becomes.

Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
In stories throughout the canon, events in countries in the distant reaches of 
the British Empire often have tragic consequences back in England:
 
✓ Australia: “The Boscombe Valley Mystery” and “The Gloria Scott”
 
✓ India: “The Speckled Band” and “The Crooked Man”
 
✓ South Africa: “The Solitary Cyclist” and “The Blanched Soldier”
 
✓ U.S. (though technically no longer in the British Empire, the U.S. was 
certainly seen as just as wild and untamed, especially the farther west 
a person went): A Study in Scarlet, “Five Orange Pips,” “Yellow Face,” 
“Dancing Men,” and The Valley of Fear
Many other Sherlockian story staples make their first appearance in The Sign 
of the Four: cocaine use, bloodhounds, Watson’s floating wound, the Baker 
Street Irregulars, and Watson’s romantic ability.
Saving Sherlock from obscurity
With two less-than-overwhelming appearances 
in the novels A Study in Scarlet and The Sign 
of the Four, Sherlock could have simply faded 
from his creator’s imagination and the public’s 
memory. But then, in early 1891, Arthur Conan 
Doyle turned to his detective for a continuing 
character to appear in a series of short stories. 
And where would these short stories be pub-
lished? In The Strand Magazine.
The Strand Magazine was published in Britain 
from January 1891 to March 1950 during an 
era of great magazine publication and read-
ership. The magazine itself, even before the 
Holmes stories appeared within its pages, was 
an immediate hit. Right out of the gate, it sold 
300,000 copies. Then, in the spring of 1891, an 
extraordinary gift arrived on the desk of editor 
Herbert Greenhough Smith — the manuscripts 
of the first Sherlock Holmes short stories.
Sometimes the stars just line up, and this was 
one of those moments. First, there was this fresh 
new magazine with an exciting philosophy of “a 
picture on every page.” Then, this exciting new 
character — a “consulting detective” named 
Sherlock Holmes — was added at precisely 
the time when the reading public was primed 
for precisely this product, and the result was a 
runaway hit. For a complete list and discussion 
of all the Holmes stories, refer to Chapter 1.
The novelty of this seemingly simple idea revo-
lutionized periodical publication and set the 
scene for the explosion of Sherlock Holmes 
onto the world stage. Holmes was immedi-
ately popular, and the press run of The Strand 
Magazine rose from an initial run of 300,000 to 
an average of 500,000 copies a month, largely 
on the strength of the Great Detective.
The Strand Magazine was reincarnated in 1998 
as The Strand Mystery Magazine. It regularly 
makes the Great Detective the centerpiece of 
its issues, with frequent essays on Sherlock 
Holmes. Check out www.strandmag.com.

 Chapter 8: The “Typical” Sherlock Holmes Story
The Hound of the Baskervilles
Like most of Holmes tales, this one starts at 221b Baker Street, opening with 
an account of an early 18th-century legend. Holmes’s visitor, Dr. Mortimer, 
reads an old parchment telling how “a hound of hell” has haunted the 
Baskerville family, who live out on the moors. He goes on to relate how the 
latest member of the family died under mysterious circumstances.
The novel is clearly in the Gothic tradition, combining elements of mystery, 
romance, and horror. The tension between the seemingly supernatural evil 
in the story and Holmes’s science and logic helps make The Hound of the 
Baskervilles an acknowledged masterpiece. It’s one of Arthur Conan Doyle’s 
greatest works.
The tale is told entirely in first-person by Watson, who uses narrative, letters, 
and diary extracts. Doyle doesn’t employ a flashback, as he does in other 
Holmes novels.
 
The Hound of the Baskervilles (1901) was published after Doyle killed his hero 
at the Reichenbach Falls in “The Final Problem” (1893). The novel is presented 
as a posthumous Holmes adventure, and when it appeared in The Strand 
Magazine, it was a sensation. (For more on The Hound of the Baskervilles, see 
Chapter 9.)
The Valley of Fear
The Valley of Fear (1914) is undoubtedly the least popular and least read of 
the Sherlock Holmes novels, and that’s too bad, because in plotting, charac-
terization, and sheer thrills, it’s second only to The Hound of the Baskervilles.
The Valley of Fear is really two independent stories that only dovetail at the 
end of the book.
 
✓ Story 1: The first story begins with what seems like a terrible murder 
in an English country home. The owner’s face has been blown off by a 
sawed-off shotgun.
 
✓ Story 2: The second story is a flashback based on the true-life events 
involving the Molly Maguires, an Irish-American labor organization that 
used terror and violence to fight abusive mine owners in Pennsylvania. 
This story (both in real life and in the novel) involves a Pinkerton detec-
tive going undercover to catch the bad guys. Some Sherlockians contend 
that this flashback is so well-written that The Valley of Fear should be 
considered to contain not one but two detective stories.

150
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
The novel elements of the novels
Three of the four Holmes novels are, in general terms, structurally simi-
lar, with common elements, themes, and storytelling devices. A Study in 
Scarlet, The Sign of the Four, and The Valley of Fear were, from their incep-
tion, conceived as Sherlock Holmes adventures, so it comes as no surprise 
that they’re structurally similar. The notable exception is The Hound of the 
Baskervilles, which is completely different in style and wasn’t originally con-
ceived as a Holmes adventure. (For more on The Hound of the Baskervilles, 
see Chapter 9.)
In this section, I discuss the peculiar storytelling conventions that Doyle uses 
in writing the Holmes novels, as well as the common motifs and themes that 
are found in them.
History in the flashbacks
All three flashbacks in the Sherlock Holmes 
novels are based on or rooted in actual histori-
cal events. The flashback to Utah in A Study in 
Scarlet has, as its foundation, the controversy 
and fascination with the Mormon Church in the 
19th century. Utah was in a distant, isolated wil-
derness, and back east in the U.S., as well as 
in England, lurid tales of polygamy, plural mar-
riage, forced marriage, and “avenging angels” 
circulated in the popular press. Doyle’s take on 
Mormonism reflected the popular understand-
ing of the day.
In The Sign of the Four, during Jonathan Small’s 
lengthy account (which is merely a flashback to 
his time in India), he tells his listeners, “sud-
denly, without a note of warning, the great 
mutiny broke upon us.” He’s referring to the 
Indian Rebellion of 1857, when native Indian 
soldiers under the command of the British 
Army mutinied. The violence spread, sparking 
other mutinies and then civilian uprisings. The 
rebellion posed a great threat to the English 
Empire in India until it was finally put down on 
June 20, 1858.
In The Valley of Fear, the flashback toward the 
end of the book is inspired by the secret, real-
life Irish society called the Molly Maguires. The 
Mollies were active in the coal fields and coal 
mining towns of Pennsylvania following the 
Civil War. They organized to resist what they 
believed to be tyrannical rule by the owners 
and management of the coal fields. Some 
historians view them as a sort of labor union, 
others see them as an innocent social frater-
nity, and still others believe they were terror-
ists who resorted to murder and violence to 
achieve their ends. What historians do agree on 
are the approximately 50 unsolved murders in 
this region at this time. Just as in the book, the 
real-life Molly Maguires were infiltrated by a 
Pinkerton detective, who then testified against 
them in order to bring down the organization.

151
 Chapter 8: The “Typical” Sherlock Holmes Story
The flashback
Arthur Conan Doyle’s use of flashback served several functions: It provided 
back story to and motivation for the plot’s crime; it gave him a chance to 
write about an exotic foreign location and time; and it helped to bring his 
books up to novel length.
 
None of the Sherlock Holmes novels is lengthy, and occasionally, you may see 
either of the early novels A Study in Scarlet or The Sign of the Four referred 
to as a novella. A novella is a story that’s too long to be considered a short 
story but not long enough to be considered a novel. A novella is generally con-
sidered to be less than 40,000 words, and though all four Holmes novels are 
longer than this, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of the Four both come in at just 
over 43,000 words.
Exotic foreign influence
With the exception of The Hound of the Baskervilles, the plots of the Sherlock 
Holmes novels are motivated by foreign crime and influence:
 
✓ Mormonism in A Study in Scarlet: In the first published tale, Holmes 
and Watson find themselves investigating the death of two victims from 
the U.S. America was a pretty far-off place in the 1880s, but it turns out 
that the victims were Mormons from the state of Utah. Mormonism, with 
its early history of polygamy and violence, was about as scandalous and 
foreign to the average British citizen as you could get.
 
✓ India and The Sign of the Four: This tale’s back story and plot are 
rooted in mysterious India — then the eastern, subcontinental posses-
sion of the empire — and so is the very spirit of the book. At every turn 
you encounter the intrusion of wild, exotic India into the ordered world 
of London.
 
 For example, upon answering a mysterious summons to Pondicherry 
Lodge, Holmes, Watson, and their client Mary Morstan are ushered into 
a strange, disorienting room: “We were all astonished by the appearance 
of the apartment into which he invited us,” Watson says. “The richest 
and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back 
here and there to expose some richly mounted painting or Oriental 
vase.” As the visitors await their host, they notice “two great tiger-skins” 
on the floor that give a “suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge 
hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a 
silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre 
of the room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic 
odor.” Indeed, the very air of The Sign of the Four reeks with exotic for-
eign overtones.

152
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Revenge and murder
Unlike the short stories, the Holmes novels — even The Hound of the 
Baskervilles — all deal with murder. A Sherlockian short story may also deal 
with murder, but just as often it deals with robbery, espionage, blackmail, 
or occasionally no crime at all. But in the long-form Holmes tales, it’s always 
murder.
In A Study in Scarlet, the plot revolves around death by poison and a double 
homicide. In The Sign of the Four, the plot includes death by a poisonous 
dart! The Hound of the Baskervilles brings death by induced heart attack and 
attempted murder by a vicious dog. Finally, The Valley of Fear has perhaps 
the grisliest murder of them all — death by a sawed-off shotgun blast to the 
face. You have to hand it to Arthur Conan Doyle — he was creative in coming 
up with violent deaths!
Exciting events
Objectively reading the Holmes novels makes it pretty clear that sustaining 
the mystery over an entire book was difficult for Doyle. Because of that he 
uses flashbacks, which take the reader out of the mystery plot by provid-
ing a sort of prequel to the main plot. He also employs much more action 
in the novels — because the longer format has more room and because the 
action helps cover and stretch the plot. Not that this is a bad thing. Some 
of the best sequences in the canon — involving boat chases, bloodhounds, 
spectral dogs, and a return visit from Professor Moriarty — all come from the 
Sherlockian novels.
The Short of It: The Short Stories
Arthur Conan Doyle once wrote that it was as hard for him to concoct the 
plot of a Sherlock Holmes short story as it was to do so for a novel, and judg-
ing from the intricacies of many of the short-story plots, we must take him 
at his word. However, that doesn’t mean that the short stories were like the 
novels, only shorter. True, some of the elements in the long stories — foreign 
influence, revenge, and so on — can occasionally be found in the short ones. 
But those elements are rarely handled in the short story the way they are in 
the novels.
The primary literary device of the novels, the flashback, rarely appears in 
the short stories. The short tales contain only four lengthy, back-story 
flashbacks — in “The Gloria Scott,” “The Crooked Man,” “The Golden 
Pince-Nez,” and “The Veiled Lodger.”

153
 Chapter 8: The “Typical” Sherlock Holmes Story
The short story “formula”
The Sherlockian short stories collectively have a pattern or formula all their 
own. This isn’t to say that Doyle followed some kind of template but that, 
over the course of reading the 56 short tales, common elements become 
apparent.
 
Of course, not every story has every one of these features, but these traits 
happen enough that, despite the variability, you can use them to construct a 
“typical” Sherlock Holmes short story.
The following sections outline how the typical Holmes short story proceeds 
from beginning to end.
No. 1: The opening domestic scene
Often, Watson opens his account in the apartment at 221b Baker Street. It’s 
a scene of cozy, domestic tranquility, with Holmes and Watson engaged 
in some personal pastime before something or someone arrives, bringing 
Writing for the English commuter
The late Victorian era was a golden age for 
magazine publishing. At a time before radio, 
television, and motion pictures, the Victorian 
magazines were the unifying entertainment 
of the popular culture in both England and 
the U.S. They presented serialized novels and 
short fiction by the era’s greatest writers, as 
well as puzzles, profiles of famous celebrities, 
true-life accounts of travels to the empire’s 
far-flung corners, political commentary, and a 
host of other valuable and entertaining items. 
Magazine advertising spread commerce and 
new products to a rising middle-class reader-
ship and helped homogenize the culture. These 
magazines undoubtedly provided many of the 
office “water-cooler” moments that would later 
come from radio and TV.
In addition to The Strand Magazine, some of the 
most popular magazines included Scribner’s 
Magazine, Harper’s Monthly, Leslie’s Magazine, 
McClure’s, Pearson’s Magazine, Harmsworth’s 
Magazine, Century, and Puck Magazine. With 
their short, punchy prose, illustrations, and 
interesting topics, these publications met the 
rising demand of Victorian commuters, who 
wanted to be entertained by exciting short 
stories on short railway journeys to and from 
the office. This was a time when the suburbs 
began to bloom, and many middle-class work-
ers moved out of the city but still worked there. 
Tracks were laid to these new suburbs, and 
commuter trains ran to and fro. This was the 
perfect time for the medium of the magazine, 
and especially for Sherlock Holmes.
It’s interesting to note that the decline of 
Victorian (and then Edwardian) magazines like 
The Strand began with the end of WWI and 
paralleled the decline of the commuter train in 
England.

154
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
a fresh case. Sometimes it’s morning, as in “The Blue Carbuncle,” where 
Holmes is “lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack 
within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evi-
dently newly studied, near at hand.”
On another occasion it may be nighttime. The start of “The Five Orange Pips” 
offers about as evocative an example of an opening scene in 221b Baker 
Street as there is.
“It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in 
with exceptional violence,” says Watson, setting the scene. He describes how 
the storm’s “wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the win-
dows” like “untamed beasts in a cage.” He goes on to say:
As evening drew in, the storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried 
and sobbed like a child in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at 
one side of the fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the 
other was deep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories until the howl of 
the gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of 
the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves.
No. 2: A demonstration of the Sherlockian method
Sherlock Holmes enjoys demonstrating his deductive “method” on Watson, 
who never fails to be amazed. This display usually comes before the arrival of 
a visitor to usher in a new case.
In “A Scandal in Bohemia,” Holmes discovers much information about an 
impending visitor from a letter sent earlier in the day. In “The Dancing Men,” 
Holmes surprises Watson by suddenly saying, “so, Watson, you do not pro-
pose to invest in South African securities?”
“How on earth do you know that?” Watson responds.
With a “gleam of amusement in his deep-set eyes,” Holmes says, “now, 
Watson, confess yourself utterly taken aback.”
“I am.”
“I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect.”
“Why?”
“Because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple.”
And it was, after it was explained!

155
 Chapter 8: The “Typical” Sherlock Holmes Story
No. 3: The introduction of the case
Following all the nice, domestic coziness comes the mystery. It can come via a 
cryptic letter or telegram, as in “The Dancing Men” or “The Sussex Vampire.” 
In the former, Holmes receives a letter with “a number of absurd little figures 
dancing across the paper upon which they are drawn.” In the latter, it’s a 
note from a law firm referring its client to Holmes regarding vampires.
Often the case comes from Scotland Yard, with perhaps Inspector Lestrade 
himself paying a visit to the Great Detective. In “The Six Napoleons,” the 
inspector comes for what seems like a social visit, until Holmes asks him, 
“anything remarkable on hand?”
“Oh, no, Mr. Holmes — nothing very particular.”
“Then tell me about it.”
But often the case arrives with the client himself. These moments are some 
of the most memorable in the canon. For example, in “The Beryl Coronet,” 
Holmes and Watson’s new client Alexander Holder is in such distress that “he 
beat his head against the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him 
and tore him away to the centre of the room.”
In “The Priory School,” Watson says that “we have had some dramatic 
entrances and exits upon our small stage at Baker Street, but I cannot 
recollect anything more sudden and startling than the first appearance of 
Thorneycroft Huxtable, M.A., Ph.D., etc.” This gentleman enters their rooms, 
closes the door, and faints!
There’s often less drama when the new client is a woman. For instance, in 
“The Solitary Cyclist,” the new potential client is Miss Violet Smith. “Her visit 
was, I remember, extremely unwelcome to Holmes,” says Watson, “for he 
was immersed at the moment in a very abstruse and complicated problem.” 
Nonetheless, Holmes helps her out.
The fact is, it’s just as likely for a king or a pawnbroker to pass through the 
door of 221b Baker Street seeking aid from the Great Detective. And each is 
as likely to get it. It all depends on the problem.
No. 4: The client’s problem
After the client has Holmes’s attention, the problem, crime, or mystery is 
presented. Holmes often starts the proceedings by introducing his associate. 
“This is my friend, Dr. Watson,” he explains, “before whom you can speak as 
freely as before myself.”

156
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Then he makes a few deductions about the visitor — perhaps the tattoo on 
his wrist indicates he was a sailor, or the dents on the side of his nose show 
nearsightedness — and then, following a moment where Holmes indicates his 
“fees are on a fixed basis,” they get down to business with an admonition to 
“omit nothing.”
 
Typically, with men, Holmes is much more direct, less sympathetic, and 
even impatient. With women, however, Sherlock adopts an entirely different 
approach, revealing not only Doyle’s own attitudes about women (he once 
slapped his son for referring to a woman as “ugly”) but also Victorian soci-
ety’s. Holmes’s interactions with women add an unexpected dimension that 
makes the character more complicated.
Watson says that, in the case of Violet Hunter (the canon has four Violets), 
“Holmes was favorably impressed by the manner and speech of his new 
client.”
In “The Speckled Band,” when Holmes notices that the young woman who 
has just arrived is shivering, he wonders if she’s cold.
“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” Helen Stoner replies.
“What, then?”
“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.”
And then Holmes comforts and reassures the young woman, soothing her 
fears and making her feel safe. And it works. “My heart is lightened already 
since I have confided my trouble to you,” she says as she leaves.
After the problem is presented, Holmes listens to the facts, the client departs, 
and he and Watson talk it over before heading off to investigate.
No. 5: On-site investigation
Holmes isn’t an “armchair detective” — someone able to solve the case with-
out ever leaving his chair. (That’s more like his brother, Mycroft!) No, Holmes 
isn’t afraid of getting his hands dirty looking into the case himself.
Sometimes he heads out alone, leaving Watson to wait and worry back at 
Baker Street. Sometimes Watson goes on his medical rounds, and other times 
he stays back and passes the time by reading. In “The Boscombe Valley 
Mystery,” he says that “I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a 
yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when 
compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found 
my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact, that I at last 
flung it across the room.” Poor Watson!

157
 Chapter 8: The “Typical” Sherlock Holmes Story
Holmes may return in disguise, as he does in “A Scandal in Bohemia,” where 
he shows up as a “drunken groom.” Following a good day of investigating, he 
may show up as he did in “The Black Peter,” with a harpoon under his arm! 
Or, if things go badly, he may have an entirely different demeanor. In “The 
Norwood Builder,” Watson says, “it was late when my friend returned, and I 
could see, by a glance at his haggard and anxious face, that the high hopes 
with which he had started had not been fulfilled. For an hour he droned away 
upon his violin, endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits.”
But the most common event is for Holmes and Watson to go to the scene 
of the crime and investigate. Time and again the famous duo is on the case 
together, and these scenes are often crowned by an exciting example of 
forensic crime-scene investigation by the Great Detective.
In “The Beryl Coronet,” Holmes deciphers events by reading footprints in 
the snow. “The Speckled Band” has Holmes discovering alterations to his 
client’s bedroom that indicate foul play. In “The Resident Patient,” by examin-
ing cigar ashes, Sherlock learns that what looks like a suicide is really cold-
blooded murder. I could go on and on, but you get the picture!
Eventually, by personally investigating the case, Holmes discovers what hap-
pened and devises a plan to catch the criminal.
No. 6: The vigil
Holmes typically keeps his plans to himself and often prefers to stage-manage 
the climax of the case for dramatic effect. He often uses the device of keeping 
a vigil (sometimes in the dark), lying in wait for the perpetrator to appear and 
thus catching him red-handed.
Notable examples include
 
✓ “The Red-Headed League”: Holmes, Watson, a Scotland Yard detective, 
and a bank manager wait in the total darkness of a bank vault to catch a 
robber.
 
✓ “The Dancing Men”: Holmes says, “I think, gentlemen, that we had 
best take up our position behind the door. Every precaution is neces-
sary when dealing with such a fellow. You will need your handcuffs, 
Inspector. You can leave the talking to me.”
 
 Watson observes: “We waited in silence for a minute — one of those 
minutes which one can never forget. Then the door opened and the man 
stepped in. In an instant Holmes clapped a pistol to his head, and Martin 
slipped the handcuffs over his wrists.”
 
✓ “The Speckled Band”: “We must sit without light,” says Holmes to 
Watson. “Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your 
pistol ready in case we should need it.”

158
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
However Sherlock Holmes manages it, he usually ends up with his man in 
police custody.
No. 7: Summation of the case
Whether it’s back at Baker Street or right there at the crime scene, Holmes 
usually explains how he worked out the solution to the case, highlighting the 
clues he discovered and the deductions he made from them. He may even 
wrap the whole thing up with a quote in Latin!
 
Holmes once quoted Horace, saying, Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo, Ipse 
domi simul ac nummos contemplar in arca. Translated, it means, “The public 
hisses at me, but I applaud myself in my own house, and simultaneously con-
template the money in my chest.”
Arthur Conan Doyle recycles
The strain of plot construction, in part, drove Doyle to kill Holmes at the 
Reichenbach Falls. But the difficult task of devising plots also caused him to 
recycle a few of the better ones. Examples include
 
✓ The too-good-to-be-true diversion plot: In this plot, an unwitting victim 
is presented with a too-good-to-be-true opportunity that requires him 
to be out of his home or workplace. This opportunity is a diversion that 
allows the bad guys access to the victim’s property or position in order 
to commit a crime.
 
 The first appearance of this ingenious plot was in “The Red-Headed 
League.” Pawnbroker Jabez Wilson has a head of vivid red hair, which 
gets him into the League of Red-Headed Men. More important, it gets 
him out of his shop, giving a chance for his criminal assistant to tunnel 
into the neighboring bank vault!
 
 This plot type shows up again in “The Stockbroker’s Clerk.” A young 
stockbroker’s clerk named Pycroft is offered a job at a prestigious firm 
without actually ever being seen in person by the employers. Before 
he can show up for the job, he’s offered another job by a different firm 
for £500 a year (approximately $58,000 in today’s money) — a wage far 
above his entry-level clerk status. What a great opportunity, even if the 
position is up in Birmingham, far from London! But wait . . . why does his 
new employer insist that Pycroft not write and decline the first offer?
 
✓ The hide-the-rare-jewel-in-something-weird-and-look-all-over-town-
for-it plot: This plot shows up in two stories. The first is “The Blue 
Carbuncle,” in which a thief steals a rare jewel. To keep it from being 
found, he forces it down the throat of a goose. But unfortunately for him, 
the goose gets sold, and Holmes ends up tracking him as he tracks the 
lost goose.

159
 Chapter 8: The “Typical” Sherlock Holmes Story
 
 The second is “The Six Napoleons,” in which a thief again steals a rare 
jewel. To keep it from being found, he runs into a plaster statue factory 
and hides it in a bust of Napoleon. But unfortunately for him, that 
bust — along with five others — gets sold, and Holmes ends up track-
ing him as he tracks the lost Napoleon.
 
✓ The put-a-wax-dummy-in-the-window-as-a-decoy plot: In “The Empty 
House,” Holmes puts a wax dummy in the window of Baker Street as a 
decoy to catch Col. Sebastian Moran. He does the same thing in “The 
Mazarin Stone.”
It All Starts on Baker Street
221b Baker Street is the most famous address in all of detective fiction, and 
indeed, one of the best-known in the whole world. Nearly every case either 
starts or ends (or both) on Baker Street. Above all, it’s the home of Sherlock 
Holmes and Dr. Watson.
Exploring the apartment
As you read the Holmes stories, a pretty clear picture of 221b begins to 
emerge (see Figure 8-1). Obviously, Arthur Conan Doyle had the famous flat 
pretty clearly fixed in his mind. But for a couple of minor incongruities, the 
residence of Sherlock Holmes is consistent throughout the tales.
The curious case of the Mazarin stone
‘‘The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone’’ took a 
long, tortured path to existence. It’s an adap-
tation into story form of a short, one-act play 
called “The Crown Diamond.” It’s believed that 
“The Crown Diamond” is, in turn, a dramatic 
adaptation of the Holmes story “The Adventure 
of the Empty House.” From short story, to play, 
to short story, this tale recycles the same 
material several times. It’s also written in the 
third person, reading like a thin, one-act play. 
With its regurgitated story elements, improba-
ble plot points, and a style that comes off almost 
as pastiche (even parody!), “The Mazarin 
Stone” tops most polls as the worst Sherlock 
Holmes story of all time. Give it a read and you’ll 
know why!

First and foremost is the fireplace, which is the centerpiece of the sitting 
room. On either side of the fireplace are two chairs, one for Holmes and the 
other for Watson. Next to the fireplace is a coal scuttle where Holmes keeps 
his cigars. His pipe tobacco is in the toe-end of a Persian slipper hung on 
the wall next to the fireplace. Up on the fireplace mantle, along with criminal 
relics, a collection of pipes, and other debris, you find Holmes’s unanswered 
correspondence transfixed to the mantle with a jackknife.
In one corner of the room would be Holmes’s chemical table. “The Naval 
Treaty” provides a typical description: “Holmes was seated at his side-table 
clad in his dressing-gown and working hard over a chemical investigation. 
A large curved retort was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a Bunsen 
burner, and the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre measure.”
Also found in the room is a desk where Watson wrote his stories, an

wicker chair that was often offered to visitors.

 Chapter 8: The “Typical” Sherlock Holmes Story
Of course, fans of the Sherlock Holmes films have seen a wide variety of 
depictions of the famous rooms. In The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes and 
Murder by Decree, 221b is depicted as a vast labyrinth of spacious rooms, 
all tastefully appointed and decorated with stylish potted plants. This, of 
course, is ridiculous.
The most faithful representations of the Sherlockian digs can be found in the 
1958 The Hound of the Baskervilles starring Peter Cushing, as well as in the 
Granada Television Sherlock Holmes series from the 1980s, starring Jeremy 
Brett as Holmes. Both show the apartment with rather small rooms, cozy if 
not a bit claustrophobic, and untidy.
 
To really experience the rooms, you should visit the Sherlock Holmes Museum 
on London’s Baker Street. Here the rooms are faithfully re-created down to 
the most minute detail! (For more about the Sherlock Holmes Museum, see 
Chapter 17.)
 
A tantalus was a contraption that held two cut-glass liquor bottles and had 
a locking mechanism that came down over the top. It was a popular device 
during an age when homeowners were worried that their servants would help 
themselves to the master’s whiskey. The gasogene was a device used to pro-
duce carbonated water. It had two globes surrounded by a wire mesh or cage. 
It needed the mesh because as it produced carbonation, it was possible for 
the globes to explode under pressure! It used tartaric acid and sodium bicar-
bonate to produce the carbon dioxide needed for carbonation and employed a 
siphon to discharge the mixture of water and gas into a glass.
Where was 221b?
One pastime that Sherlockians have engaged in is trying to locate exactly 
where 221b Baker Street would have been in real life. You may think, “Well, 
this couldn’t be too hard . . . after all, we have the address, right?” Well, it 
isn’t as easy as that.
During the time that the stories were written, Baker Street addresses only 
went to 100. To further complicate things, the middle section of what is now 
Baker Street was, during the time of the stories, actually called York Place. 
The street north of Marylebone Road and up to Regent’s Park was called 
Upper Baker Street. Curiously, in the original manuscript notes for A Study in 
Scarlet, Doyle originally named Holmes’s street “Upper Baker Street,” so per-
haps this was indeed where it was meant to be located. In all this confusion, 
one thing is certain — there was no 221b.

162
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
 
Sometime in the 1930s, the entire place was renamed Baker Street, and all the 
addresses were renumbered. This finally did create a 221 Baker Street, which 
was the home of a financial firm called Abbey National (which for years 
employed a secretary to answer mail for Mr. Sherlock Holmes!).
Sherlockians have proposed several locations for the Great Detective’s home, 
but in the end, all you really need to know for sure is that, in the canon, it 
was at 221b Baker Street.

▶ Tracing the book’s background
T
he Hound of the Baskervilles isn’t just a great read. As Arthur Conan 
Doyle’s magnum opus in the early years of the mystery genre, this novel 
occupies a pivotal role in modern literature. The intricacy of its plot, the 
depth of its characterizations, and the artfully developed mood of the set-
ting combine to produce an extraordinarily powerful work. The novel sweeps 
readers out of the everyday world and into the clash between science and 
the unknown, into that ill-defined gap between rationality and terror, and 
leaves them trapped — for a while, at least — somewhere between heaven 
and hell, out there in the wastelands, all alone in the night.

Chapter 3.
Plot Points: How “The Hound” 
Is More Than Just a Dog’s Tale
At the book’s beginning, as Sherlock Holmes amuses himself with a string of 
deductions based on a walking stick “of the sort which is known as a ‘Penang 
lawyer,’” the would-be client, one Dr. Mortimer, puts in an appearance and 
lays an incredible tale of murder at the detective’s feet, a tale that involves an 
ancient crime and a supernatural beast called the Hound of the Baskervilles.

164
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
It seems that this demonic beast has killed the most recent master of 
Baskerville Hall, just as it did the first one. And it’s probably going to do the 
same thing to the next one unless Holmes can find a way to stop it. As the 
novel progresses, Dr. Watson goes with Sir Henry Baskerville, the new heir 
to the Baskerville estate, into the heart of the eerie moorland in an attempt 
to solve one murder and prevent another while Holmes works behind the 
scenes.
 
The Hound of the Baskervilles isn’t just a story of some supernatural monster. 
From the beginning, Watson is caught up in an uncanny situation, surrounded 
by those who swear the hound is real — and at times, even he thinks it may 
be so. He struggles to uncover the truth in an intricate game of deception and 
violence, compounded by an escaped prisoner, a mysterious stranger, and 
enough shameful secrets and double-crosses to satisfy the most demanding 
reader.
A devilish game is afoot
From the very beginning, the Baskerville case is anything but ordinary. Sure, 
Holmes has real evidence to consider, but it’s always tinged with the fantas-
tic. Consider these examples:
 
✓ The footprint: As Holmes listens to the tale of murder for the first time, 
he’s impressed by Dr. Mortimer’s careful observation of the crime 
scene. When Mortimer speaks of footprints, Holmes asks him, “A man’s 
or a woman’s?” — a natural question for any detective to ask. But the 
answer is anything but natural when Mortimer whispers back, “Mr. 
Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!”
 
✓ The warning: The ancient parchment that tells the tale of the hound 
warns the Baskerville heirs “to forbear from crossing the moor in those 
dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted.” As kind of a series of 
What’s a Penang lawyer?
The Hound of the Baskervilles begins with 
Holmes amusing himself with a string of deduc-
tions based on a walking stick “of the sort 
which is known as a ‘Penang lawyer.’” Penang 
is a part of Malaysia that belonged to the 
British Empire in the days of Sherlock Holmes 
(see Chapter 4). It had a reputation for a rough-
and-tumble lifestyle back then, and Watson 
calls the walking stick with a heavy knob on 
top a “Penang lawyer” as a humorous way of 
saying that it could be used to quickly settle an 
argument.

165
 Chapter 9: Delving into “The Hound of the Baskervilles”
booster shots, this phrase is repeated twice more, about 100 pages 
apart — once by Holmes on the threshold of the gateway, so to speak, 
at the railroad station, and again by Sir Henry, just before the hound 
sounds its chilling cry across the moor.
 
✓ The sounds: From his first night in Baskerville Hall, Watson lives in an 
emotional soundscape. A woman’s sob in the night, the scratch of ivy on 
the wall — and then those shuddering howls from out in the moor. The 
mystery of the moor engages all the characters’ — and vicariously, the 
reader’s — five senses.
As the mystery deepens through each chapter, Doyle manages to both 
steadily build suspense and increase the reader’s suspension of disbelief. 
Each event takes the characters and the reader one more pace away from 
the tale’s relatively safe Baker Street origins to a place much removed from 
security and certainty — and, perhaps in the process, takes them one more 
pace toward the unthinkable. Could the evil of the moor, and the threat of the 
hound from hell, indeed be supernatural?
A word about Holmes’s absence
Sherlock Holmes is physically absent through a large part of The Hound 
of the Baskervilles. Following the initial presentation of the case and some 
early investigation in London, Holmes turns the case over to Watson. Then, 
through the middle of the novel, Watson is the man on the ground, providing 
the eyes and ears for his absent friend. It’s only later that Holmes reappears 
after some solid investigation by Watson. Watson comes with Holmes’s high-
est recommendation. The Great Detective tells Sir Henry, “There is no man 
who is better worth having at your side when you are in a tight place. No one 
can say so more confidently than I.”
 
The absence of Holmes and the actions of Watson are important story ele-
ments for two reasons:
 
✓ They show Watson in a different light than the other Holmes stories. 
In many of the stories, Watson faithfully and bravely works side by 
side with Holmes, often in very dangerous situations, but Doyle pres-
ents a new side of him here. In The Hound of the Baskervilles, Watson 
is an independent, competent investigator. Out on the moor, acting as 
Holmes’s agent, he discreetly and capably discovers vital information.
 
✓ They indicate that the character of Holmes was a bit of a latecomer in 
the novel’s developmental cycle. Holmes’s peripheral involvement and 
Watson’s presence at the center of the action are lingering traces that 
The Hound of the Baskervilles wasn’t originally conceived as a Sherlock 
Holmes story. See the later section “Who Told the Hound Story First?” 
for more on this idea.

166
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Examining Characterization: 
Henry and the Hound
Sir Henry, the foreign heir (he’s Canadian), and the hound, the ancient neme-
sis of his family, define the novel. The impending, seemingly inevitable death 
of the likable Sir Henry under the fangs of the demonic beast establishes a 
sense of urgency from the beginning that carries through until the final con-
frontation between innocence and evil.
The hellhound
The star of the book isn’t Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, or Henry 
Baskerville. No, the star of The Hound of the Baskervilles is the hellhound 
(see Figure 9-1) — kept offstage, only fleetingly glimpsed, haunting the 
moors with his blood-chilling howls and his glowing muzzle. Is the hound 
merely a product of superstitious locals’ fevered imaginations fed by old 
legends and rumor? Or is it something else? Is this hellhound real?

 Chapter 9: Delving into “The Hound of the Baskervilles”
 
The hound in The Hound of the Baskervilles is based on a local myth of a dog 
called the “black dog of Dartmoor,” but the British Isles have no shortage of 
tales about devilish hounds. Legend has it that the entire realm is infested 
with dark beasts roaming through the darkness in a restless quest for their 
next victim. Consider these other canine legends:
 
✓ Whisht hounds: Also called whist hounds or wish hounds, these are 
ghostly versions of normal hounds, accompanying a huntsman in pur-
suit of his prey through the night.
 
✓ Farvann: The book Folk Lore in Lowland Scotland compares this fairy 
hound with Baskerville’s bane, saying that it “moved silently, but for all 
its gliding gait, the print of its paws, as big as a human hand, were found 
on mud or sand or snow. Its voice was sonorous and far reaching, being 
heard even by those sailing on the seas. It paused between each bark 
and at a time gave vent to only three roars. Its baying struck terror into 
the pursued, who was invariably overtaken and destroyed after the third 
bark if he had not hidden himself from his unearthly pursuer.”
Hellhounds have been around for a long time, going way back to Cerberus, 
the three-headed canine guardian of Hades. So the devilish hound in 
The Hound of the Baskervilles is one in a long line of such mythological 
creatures — preternatural dogs dispensing divine justice (or protection) 
and fulfilling ancient curses. In fact, just about every region seems to have a 
similar tale with its own special, local twist.
 
Most of these legends spring from rural or undeveloped locations, places 
where nature is omnipresent and the rhythms of daily life are pretty much set 
by its patterns. At the same time, the less urban the setting, the less light there 
is to push back the night — and consequently, the stronger the tendency to 
populate the unknown with the imaginary. See “A Sense of Place” later in this 
chapter for more on how the setting of The Hound impacts its mood.
The Baskerville heir
Although the story doesn’t begin with Henry Baskerville (he isn’t even the 
one who first asks for Holmes’s help), Henry, shown in Figure 9-2, is a key 
character. The newest Baskerville heir because of the death of Charles 
Baskerville, Henry travels from Canada to see his family’s home.
Poor Henry doesn’t seem to be at home anywhere. From the start, he’s awk-
ward switching from the role of Canadian farmer to English squire. He’s lost 
in a bewildering new world, complaining to Holmes and the others, “It seems 
to me that all you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own 
affairs.” His trip to London, though, is the least of the challenges he faces.

168
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures

As he soon discovers, he has a few problems to contend with — affairs that 
are far more dangerous and complicated than he can imagine. Aside from 
the looming supernatural threat (as heir, the Baskerville curse falls on him), 
human forces are at work. Someone steals his things. Someone follows him 
(and Holmes). Someone sends him a note, although it’s impossible to tell 
whether it’s a threat or a warning. All he can do is put his trust in these strang-
ers called Holmes and Watson and hope that it all turns out right somehow.
 
With the character of Sir Henry Baskerville, Doyle was able to inject a continu-
ing note of strangeness into the story. The Americanized character of Henry 
represented a foreign or exotic element to Doyle’s main audience in the UK. 
Although an Englishman, he had lived in Canada for so long that his customs, 
dress, and outlook were different; fitting into his new role would prove diffi-
cult for him. For more on Doyle’s use of foreign characters, head to Chapter 4.
“The Hound” as Gothic Masterpiece
 
The Hound of the Baskervilles fall squarely in the literary tradition known as 
Gothic fiction. This genre of literature began in the late 1700s and combines ele-
ments of the romance novel and the horror story. Gothic fiction is dependent 
on a brooding, pervasive sense of mounting anxiety and fear — even horror.

169
 Chapter 9: Delving into “The Hound of the Baskervilles”
Scholars and critics have identified common elements of Gothic fiction. As 
you can see, The Hound of the Baskervilles hits every point on the list:
 
✓ A setting with an old castle, mansion, or manor house: This old build-
ing often includes gloomy hallways, mysterious passages, and ruined 
or abandoned wings. The overwhelming feeling of the house is one of 
shadows, darkness, and a sense of entrapment. This fits Baskerville Hall 
to a T.
 
✓ An atmosphere of mystery and suspense: A pervading sense of fear 
and mystery is a hallmark of the Gothic novel. The plot is usually built 
around a mystery involving unknown parentage (parentage and inheri-
tance are vital to the plot of The Hound of the Baskervilles), a disappear-
ance or death, or some strange, uncanny event.
 
✓ An ancient prophecy: This plot element is usually connected to the 
house or its inhabitants. Clearly, the ancient legend of the hound and its 
relationship to the Baskerville family satisfies this requirement.
 
✓ Visions, omens, portents: In Gothic fiction, a character often has a 
disturbing dream or experience that seems to be a portent of coming 
events. In The Hound of the Baskervilles, when Sir Henry hears the howl-
ing of a hound in the middle of the night, it strikes fear into his heart and 
makes him believe the legend may be true.
 
✓ Supernatural or otherwise inexplicable events: Hauntings, voices, 
apparitions, and other supernatural occurrences are common in Gothic 
fiction. In some works, the events are ultimately given a natural explana-
tion, while in others the events are truly supernatural. The Hound of the 
Baskervilles certainly fits this criterion.
 
✓ High, overwrought emotion: Characters in Gothic fiction often betray 
heightened emotion, including sorrow, terror, and impending doom. 
Several characters in The Hound of the Baskervilles fit this description, 
including Mrs. Barrymore, the housekeeper at Baskerville Hall, who is 
prone to creepy crying spells in the middle of the night.
 
✓ Women in distress: Female characters in Gothic fiction are usually 
oppressed and victimized by a tyrannical male figure and are often kept 
in some lonely, isolated location. Gothic women are usually abandoned, 
having no one to protect them. Beryl Stapleton and Laura Lyons are per-
fect examples of this type found in The Hound of the Baskervilles.
A Sense of Place
Doyle set The Hound of the Baskervilles in Dartmoor in the late-19th century. 
Although the story has elements of the supernatural, the setting itself is real. 
Dartmoor, in southwestern England, is an area that was familiar to Doyle’s 
readers. Of course, it wasn’t just a matter of putting a fantastic tale in a 

170
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
familiar setting. Doyle deliberately chose that area because of its wild, unde-
veloped terrain and because, as claimed in a contemporary guidebook, “there 
is a black dog which haunts the waste.” This is precisely the legend that 
inspired what many think is Doyle’s greatest novel.
Baskerville Hall
Inspired by Doyle’s visit to the real-life Cromer Hall, Baskerville Hall is vital 
in establishing the novel’s Gothic credentials. Sir Henry first sees Baskerville 
Hall through a “sombre tunnel” of trees, and he “shuddered as he looked up 
the long, dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the farther 
end.” Inside is no better. The hall is vast, and “the dark bulk of the house” is 
overwhelming as “the door clanged heavily behind us.”
On his first encounter with the interior, Watson feels that it’s the kind of 
place where “one’s voice became hushed and one’s spirit subdued.” Sir 
Henry’s only comment is, “My word, it isn’t a very cheerful place.” Sir Henry 
rouses himself and makes plans to banish the darkness with a touch of sci-
ence: “I’ll have a row of electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you 
won’t know it again, with a thousand-candle power Swan and Edison right 
here in front of the hall door.”
While the hall is a fortress guarding them against the dangers outside in 
the night, it’s also almost a tomb for the living, a sense that Doyle certainly 
intended as part of the overall mood. When Watson first meets Stapleton, 
one of the neighbors, he muses, “It is asking much of a wealthy man to come 
down and bury himself in a place of this kind.”
Although sunshine occasionally pours through the windows, those moments 
are teasing contrasts pitted against the coming fog and rain — perhaps a 
mirror for the hopes of the characters and their fears. The dark confines of 
the hall also mirror the evil forces outside its walls — darkness both inside 
and out.
The lonely moor
Forget Shakespeare and Othello; Dartmoor isn’t that kind of moor. This kind 
of moor is a desolate wasteland where nothing much grows except tangled 
thickets of shrubs called heath or heather (because of this, a moor can also 
be called a heath).
Scattered among the dry spots are peat bogs, perilous swamps in which you 
find decaying vegetable matter (called — you guessed it — peat). Peat is 
gathered, dried, and used as a fuel in lieu of firewood in this area where few 
trees grow.

171
 Chapter 9: Delving into “The Hound of the Baskervilles”
The tors — craggy upthrusts of granite — rise in sharp contrast to the low 
marshland, and the whole scene seems to have been transplanted straight 
from some other planet. Indeed, one of Baskerville’s neighbors has a tele-
scope, watching the moor as if it were akin to the surface of the moon.
The setting is so far outside the experience of the typical Londoner that 
Holmes has to send out for a map.
 
As desolate and unwelcoming as a moor is, why would anyone want to live 
there? Because the area had more than just the moor. This description from 
Devonshire Scenery, an 1884 guidebook, tells the tale:
Fair meadows bathed in sunshine, with the Otter river winding through 
them, lie below; yonder are the red Devon steers grazing up to their dew-
laps in buttercups; beyond them dusky moors melt into purple haze, and 
every here and there you catch a glimpse of the far-off Tors on Dartmoor 
simmering in the mid-day glare.
Yet it was the moor proper that drove the dark, moody sense of The Hound of 
the Baskervilles.
From the time he gets off the train, even before reaching the vicinity of 
Baskerville Hall, Watson finds the setting oppressive — tinged, as he puts it, 
with melancholy: “The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through 
drifts of rotting vegetation — sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to 
throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.”
The wildness of the moors is an important element in creating the forbidding 
and foreboding setting. For more on how the setting informs the story, see 
the later section “From civilized to primitive.”
 
Doyle’s word craft was perfectly matched by Sidney Paget’s illustrations (see 
the nearby sidebar “The accidental artist”). Figure 9-3 shows Paget’s rendering 
of the line, “There, outlined as black as an ebony statue on that shining back-
ground, I saw the figure of a man upon the tor.” His stark renditions and blend 
of dark grays and blacks helped to bring the eerie setting to life.
The accidental artist
Sidney Paget was originally hired by mistake. 
The Strand Magazine intended to engage his 
brother Walter but signed on the wrong Paget.
It was a match made in heaven, though. Paget’s 
illustrations struck a powerful chord with the 
public from the very beginning. His association 
with Sherlock Holmes would stretch from 1891 to 
1904, running to over 500 drawings for both books 
and magazines. Those drawings of Holmes’s 
adventures would influence the public’s image 
of the Great Detective for all time.

Key Themes in the Novel
The contest between science and superstition runs through The Hound in a 
powerful way. Doyle shows how thin the veneer of modern civilization is, art-
fully exposing the primitive that lies within us all. Just hours away from home 
and comfort, just inches beyond the edges of the firelight, all the ancient ter-
rors still lurk in the night.
Going backward in time
The novel has an underlying movement backward through time. This is most 
evident in Sir Henry’s travels:
 
✓ He first sails from the New World of Canada to the Old World of England.
 
✓ When Sir Henry travels from London to Devonshire, he takes the 
train — at that time the fastest, most modern form of transportation in 
existence. Upon his arrival at the railroad station, he switches to a kind 
of carriage called a wagonette, making the backward leap from machine 

173
 Chapter 9: Delving into “The Hound of the Baskervilles”
power to horsepower. When he steps down from the carriage, he is back 
on foot, the most primitive form of transport. When Henry takes the last 
step of his long journey, passing at last through the doors of Baskerville 
Hall, he’s not just arriving from Canada, not just taking possession of the 
Baskerville estate, but, perhaps, settling an ancient curse upon himself 
as well.
 
✓ Finally, on the moor, he walks among the prehistoric huts found scat-
tered over the landscape.
 
All these elements are part of a distancing process. To make the supernatural 
seem real to a sophisticated city audience, Doyle carefully took them away 
from their day-to-day world in both space and time, moving them gradually 
into a strange place where things happen that “are hard to reconcile with the 
settled order of Nature.”
From civilized to primitive
If the transition from London to Baskerville Hall is a step back in time of a few 
centuries, the transition from the hall to the moor is a much longer one. The 
hall, although centuries old, is actually a sign of civilization: a home and even 
a fortress that separates and protects the inhabitants from the wilderness 
beyond. So even though it’s old compared to contemporary London, not to 
mention dark and gloomy, it’s still protective.
The moors, on the other hand, represent an ancient, pagan wildness. The 
desolate land, covered with hedges and Stone Age ruins, traces of a magic 
older than history, constantly calls to the most primitive in the characters, 
challenging them to set aside their science and logic and just listen to the 
cries and howls in the darkness beyond the firelight. Even in the daylight, the 
sense that things aren’t the same is overwhelming, and the prehistoric past 
dominates the landscape. As Watson puts it, once you enter the moor,
. . . you have left all traces of modern England behind you, but on the 
other hand you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of 
the prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the houses of 
these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which are 
supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their grey stone 
huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind you, 
and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door, 
fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel that 
his presence there was more natural than your own.
When a neighbor named Stapleton takes Watson and Sir Henry to see the 
scene of the original hound story, the nattily dressed, so nicely civilized 
people (see Figure 9-4) seem comically overwhelmed by their surroundings, 
dwarfed both individually and as a group. Their scientific outlook seems like 
a helpless child before the ancient magic of the monoliths.

Superstition versus science
If Holmes has a professional definition aside from crime detection, it’s as a 
logician. Watson, despite his writing talents, is essentially a medical man. As 
men of science, their attitudes lean toward the rational approach rather than 
the theological one. In the beginning of The Hound of the Baskervilles, Holmes 
asks the country doctor about his superstitions regarding the legendary hound 
from hell: “And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?”
Watson likewise scoffs, more than once calling the whole idea “nonsense.” Yet 
both of them experience at least a few instants of unreasoning fear before the 
affair is over. Watson writes that “the barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and 
the mystery and urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart.” Later, he lis-
tens to the baying of the hound in the night “with a chill of fear in my heart.”
He even says at one point that his soul “quivered at the vagueness and the 
terror” while waiting for an encounter with a mysterious man in the wilds of 
the moor.

175
 Chapter 9: Delving into “The Hound of the Baskervilles”
Even the staunchly scientific Holmes, once outside of London and in the 
midst of the moor, finds himself affected:
“It does not seem a very cheerful place,” said the detective, with a shiver, 
glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and at the huge lake 
of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire.
When the mystery is finally solved, it’s no surprise to the admirers of the 
rational Sherlock Holmes that the solution is matter-of-fact rather than 
supernatural. Indeed, the crimes could hardly have been committed with-
out the help of scientific knowledge. In the final lines of the story, Sir Henry 
Baskerville is making practical plans to banish superstition from his corner 
of the moor. The reader has to wonder whether he can succeed. Meanwhile, 
Holmes and Watson turn to a healthier form of escapism — namely, music.
Who Told the Hound Story First?
The basic plot idea for The Hound of the Baskervilles was a collaborative 
effort between Sir Arthur and a friend of his. That much is for sure. Beyond 
that, however, a debate has raged for a long time about which one contrib-
uted how much to the book as a whole.
The basic core of the story goes back to the 17th century, when Richard 
Cabell, a local man with an evil reputation, inspired a local legend. Cabell was 
the biggest landowner of Buckfastleigh, a town in Devonshire. Depending on 
who’s telling the story, he either murdered his wife and was killed by her pet 
hound, or he was just so plain wicked that the devil sent a pack of hounds to 
hunt his soul over the moors every night.
Who came up with the story
Sir Arthur, while returning from a visit to South Africa, met Bertram Fletcher 
Robinson, a Devonshire journalist. The two became fast friends and, over 
the course of a few visits, Doyle became fascinated by Robinson’s tales of 
old legends. Two in particular caught his attention: the tale of Richard Cabell 
and another, the one about the dark hound that haunted the moors. The two 
men decided to collaborate on a novel about this eerie combination, one that 
Doyle told his publisher would be “a real creeper.” (Robinson’s coachman, by 
the way, was named Baskerville.)

176
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Occasional odd claims over the years have maintained that Sir Arthur some-
how stole the story from Robinson, taking credit for the whole thing. Yet 
interviews with Doyle and publishing notes indicate that nothing could be 
further from the truth. Not only was Robinson paid, but in negotiations with 
his publisher, Doyle wrote that Robinson “gave me the central idea and the 
local colour.” In addition, the first page of the story in The Strand Magazine 
carried the note:
This story owes its inception to my friend, Mr. Fletcher Robinson, who 
has helped me both in the general plot and in the local details. –A.C.D.
Finally, when the book was published in book form, Sir Arthur once again 
publicly thanked Robinson for his part in the dedication:
MY DEAR ROBINSON,
It was to your account of a West-Country legend that this tale owes its 
inception. For this and for your help in the details all thanks.
Yours most truly,
A. CONAN DOYLE.
As late as 1907, Doyle received a letter asking about the origins of The Hound, 
and he replied:
My story was really based on nothing save a remark of my friend Fletcher 
Robinson’s that there was a legend about a dog on the Moor connected 
with some old family.
Some question has also persisted about how much of the writing is 
Robinson’s and how much is Doyle’s. It’s clear that Doyle meant from the 
beginning to do the actual writing himself, writing to his publisher that the 
story would be “in my own style without dilution.” It’s obvious to anyone 
who knows that style that he did exactly that, from beginning to end.
How the story developed
The Hound of the Baskervilles was originally conceived as a supernatural 
thriller, not as a Sherlock Holmes novel. When Doyle wrote a letter calling 
it “a real creeper” in March 1901, he certainly didn’t mention Holmes, but 
by April he reported that “Robinson and I are exploring the moor over our 
Sherlock Holmes book.”

177
 Chapter 9: Delving into “The Hound of the Baskervilles”
Whatever the original story had been, Doyle made serious changes by bring-
ing in the detective. This was a bit of a feat, given that prior to writing The 
Hound of the Baskervilles, Doyle had killed off his famous detective. In order 
to include Sherlock Holmes in The Hound, Holmes would have to rise from 
the dead — sort of.
Doyle solved this dilemma by making it a posthumous adventure of Sherlock 
Holmes, set before his unfortunate tumble over Reichenbach Falls. So 
although The Hound of the Baskervilles was written after Holmes’s “death,” 
the story itself relates events prior. Note that this wasn’t Holmes’s only 
resurrection. Doyle brought Sherlock back in the flesh, so to speak, in “The 
Adventure of the Empty House,” a story in which readers discover how 
Holmes managed to escape death at Reichenbach Falls. (Check out Chapter 3 
for more on the period during which Holmes was officially dead.)
When the publishers of The Strand Magazine learned that Holmes would 
be resurrected, they leapt at the chance to publish a new Holmes story. 
When Doyle asked for double the normal payment, they didn’t hesitate for 
a second. The public reacted with similar enthusiasm, once again forming 
long lines outside the Strand offices, aching for one more tale of their favorite 
character.

The Gaslight Goes Away: 
The “Modern” Stories
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution and World War I
▶ Tracing the emergence of hard-boiled detective fiction
▶ Exploring the “modern” Sherlock Holmes stories
F
or Sherlockians, one of the most famous quotations about Sherlock 
Holmes comes from a sonnet by Vincent Starrett, who concludes his 
poem about Holmes by writing, “it is always 1895.” This sentiment perfectly 
evokes the popular image of Holmes, who forever lives in a world of gas 
lamps, fog, and hansom cabs. But the fact is, nearly a third of the canon was 
written after the upheaval of World War I.
These “modern” Holmes stories bear the imprint of being written in a world 
coping with the great disillusionment that followed that devastating conflict. 
The three volumes of the canon that fall into this time period are The Valley 
of Fear, His Last Bow, and The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes. (If you want to 
get technical, The Valley of Fear was actually published serially in The Strand 
Magazine from September 1914 [just after the war started] to May 1915.)
Suddenly, It’s No Longer 1895
Sherlock Holmes exploded in popularity during the late Victorian era of 
the 1890s. This era was the height of the British Empire’s power and reach 
(for more on the era in which Holmes was created, refer to Chapter 4). The 
Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, brought massive 
change to all areas of society, including transportation and manufacturing, 
and sparked a period of urbanization throughout the United Kingdom. A 
scientific revolution was also underway, with major advances in astronomy, 
medicine, and natural sciences. Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection 
and evolution sparked not only a scientific revolution in biology but also a 
social revolution.

180
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
These changes weren’t confined to England. In America, this period was 
known as the Gilded Age, a time when immigration was high, supplying 
workers to fuel the creation of great industries and businesses across 
America. “Captains of Industry” in the late 19th century amassed great 
wealth and power while creating new towns, factories, and railroads.
It was an age when the commissioner of the U.S. Office of Patents could say, 
“Everything that can be invented has been invented” and actually mean it. It 
was a world, both in England and America, that was supremely confident and 
secure in itself. This was the world of both Sherlock Holmes and his readers.
But then came the war.
The war to end all wars
It has many names. Early on it was The War in Europe. Some knew it by the 
now-ironic title The War to End All Wars. At the end of the shooting, it had 
become The Great War. And a couple decades down the road we were forced to 
call it World War I. Whatever it was called, the conflict engulfed Europe in a ter-
rible, mechanized, total war, with all the industry and science of the Victorian 
era’s Industrial Revolution behind it. By war’s end, over 15 million people were 
killed, a third of whom were civilians, making it one of the deadliest conflicts 
in history. In England alone, 703,000 young men were killed and 1,663,000 
wounded — nearly an entire generation in such a relatively small country.
The world that existed before August 1914 was gone. In its wake was a world 
that had lost the confidence and optimism of the Victorian era. The Gilded 
Age of possibility was replaced by an age of grim pessimism, as the nations of 
the West coped with the war’s aftermath.
 
The psychological effect of World War I created a sense of distrust in political 
leaders who, after all, had led the world over the abyss. The horror of this 
modern, mechanized warfare — with its tanks, airplanes, machine guns, 
barbed wire, and, worst of all, poison gas — left those who witnessed it 
cynical and hardened. Around the world, in the aftermath of the war, grief and 
disillusionment replaced optimism.
The Roaring Twenties
In some sense, the 1920s can be seen as the inevitable outcome of both the 
repressed, proper Victorian era and the devastation of World War I. Just as 
the baby-boom generation did following World War II, the generation that 
followed the First World War rebelled against society’s morality and mores. 
Social patterns, political ideas, the automobile, mass media, music, and 
entertainment — they all experienced radical changes during this time.

181
 Chapter 10: The Gaslight Goes Away: The “Modern” Stories
The disillusionment that was World War I, which cast its shadow to the end 
of the century, began to fully manifest itself in the 1920s. This shadow fell on 
both sides of the Atlantic. A decade that saw Western prosperity and societal 
freedom also ushered in coarseness and brutality, leaving no doubt that the 
gilded Victorian and Edwardian eras were history.
It was the Jazz Age, an era named after a new form of sexy, risqué (for its 
time) music, in which both technology and social trends seemed to break 
down barriers and speed up the pace of life. In England, the horrors of war 
had made the younger generation old before their time. Trench warfare, horrific 
wounds, shell shock, and wholesale slaughter had instilled a feeling that life 
was short, cheap, and meant to be enjoyed. To add to the general gloom, 
throughout the 1920s, over 2 million people in Britain remained unemployed.
In the United States, it was a time epitomized by the Algonquin Round Table, 
a celebrated group of New York City writers, celebrities, and critics, whose 
wisecracks and comments made at daily lunches at the Algonquin Hotel 
began to be reported in the popular press. There was Prohibition, the Great 
Depression, and the Dust Bowl. More disturbingly, there was lurid and 
high-profile crime, including Sacco and Vanzetti (two Italian immigrants sent 
to the electric chair for murder) and Leopold and Loeb (two thrill-seeking 
University of Chicago students who murdered a 14-year-old out of nothing 
more than a desire to commit the perfect crime). Add in Al Capone and 
Chicago’s organized crime and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, and it’s easy to 
see that the country had definitely entered a new era.
No matter which side of the Atlantic you lived on, after World War I, the 
world got a lot smaller, and England and America shared many of the same 
cultural trends.
 
Crime and crime fiction also underwent radical changes during the 1920s, 
and the Holmes stories reflect this shift. Arthur Conan Doyle wasn’t writing 
historical fiction when he penned an adventure of the Great Detective. The 
Holmes books were never intended to be period pieces. Quite the contrary: 
Doyle was always writing contemporary detective stories and crime fiction. 
For readers who see Holmes only existing in the cozy, gaslit, Victorian age, it 
may come as a shock to learn that the adventures of Sherlock Holmes were 
not immune to the spirit of the age.
Postwar Canonical Crime
In the U.S., into this coarser, postwar era, when everything seemed to be 
changing, came a new age of crime as well. In 1919, government passed 
the 18th amendment to the Constitution, beginning the age of Prohibition. 
From 1919 to 1933, all alcohol sales, manufacturing, and consumption were 
banned. This created an instant black market, and a golden opportunity for 
organized crime.

182
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Battles ensued between rival mobs and between criminals and federal agents. 
In an age that was throwing off the restrictions of the past, Prohibition made 
millions of ordinary citizens lawbreakers, hardening the culture and blurring 
sympathies for criminals. It was in this fevered era of the 1920s that crime 
fiction began to change.
The rise of the hard-boiled detective
 
The decade of the 1920s is seen as the transitional era for crime fiction, 
with the rise of new styles within the genre. Critics regard the golden age of 
detective fiction as beginning in 1920, when Agatha Christie created Hercule 
Poirot and Dorothy L. Sayers gave us Lord Peter Wimsey. But more interestingly 
for this discussion, this period also saw the rise of another literary form, one 
that’s clearly reflected in postwar Sherlock Holmes stories: the hard-boiled 
school of detective fiction.
Pulp fiction: “Black Mask”
The hard-boiled school saw its birth in the pages of Black Mask, a pulp 
magazine launched in April 1920 by publishers H. L. Mencken and George 
Jean Nathan. After only eight issues, Black Mask was sold, and under the 
direction of editor “Cap” Joseph Shaw, the magazine began publishing a new 
school of tough crime writers. Shaw believed that crime fiction could promote 
the ideal of law and order on the increasingly lawless streets of real-life 
America, leading many of the crime fighters in the Black Mask stories to be 
private detectives. This tougher, darker style was unlike earlier detective 
stories, which seemed like fairy tales next to the realistic, gritty adventures 
appearing in Black Mask. To quote writer William Marling, as their popularity 
increased, the stories “grew more violent, the style harder, the dialogue 
blacker, and the wit drier.”
Luminaries of this new literary school included
 
✓ Dashiell Hammett: This ex-Pinkerton agent was the first breakout 
success. He published his first story in Black Mask in December 1922. 
His best know works include The Maltese Falcon, with detective Sam 
Spade, and his series of Thin Man books.
 
✓ Erle Stanley Gardner: Gardner made his hard-boiled debut in Black 
Mask in 1923. Gardner was prolific, writing under at least seven 
pseudonyms in addition to his own name. His most famous creation is 
the crime-solving lawyer, Perry Mason.
 
✓ James M. Cain: Despite a varied writing career, Cain is most strongly 
associated with the hard-boiled school. This gritty, unsentimental 
author’s best-known book is The Postman Always Rings Twice.

183
 Chapter 10: The Gaslight Goes Away: The “Modern” Stories
 
✓ Raymond Chandler: Following his debut in a 1933 edition of Black Mask, 
Chandler went on to write The Big Sleep. Considered his finest work, this 
novel introduces his famous detective, Philip Marlowe.
Hammett and Gardner became Black Mask’s most popular writers. By 1926, 
Black Mask had a circulation of 66,000 and was available on newsstands 
across America.
In the 1920s, during the rise of the Black Mask and its new style of detective 
story, Arthur Conan Doyle and his family repeatedly toured the U.S. on lecture 
tours promoting his belief in spiritualism (refer to Chapter 3 for more on that). 
These tours would typically last months at a time and extended from New York 
to Los Angeles. One can imagine the Doyle boys, or perhaps Arthur himself, 
picking up copies of Black Mask in the train stations of America to entertain 
themselves as they crossed the country on their latest tour. And back home in 
England, a British edition was equally as popular. There’s no doubt that the influ-
ence of the hard-boiled detective and Black Mask was felt across the Atlantic.
Arthur Conan Doyle invents the form
It’s clear that the later Sherlock Holmes stories, which I detail in the following 
sections, reflect the times they were written in. Doyle never intended them 
to be nostalgia (that view of them would come later). Instead, Doyle intended 
the Holmes tales to be contemporary, modern (to that time period) detective 
stories.
Knowing this, it’s no wonder that elements of the emerging hard-boiled detective 
story find their way into the adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes was 
being written contemporaneously with the hard-boiled school. Indeed, some 
even believe Doyle’s connection to the hard-boiled genre is even deeper.
Different schools, common roots
In the 1920s, detective fiction began to split into 
different genres. In England, a host of Sherlock 
Holmes-like detectives appeared on the scene, 
creating a model for the British mystery story 
that’s still valid today. In America, the heroes 
of crime fiction changed from the brilliant, 
amateur detective model found in Holmes to a 
flawed private eye of the hard-boiled school.
American detective stories drew inspiration 
from the changing culture of the post-World 
War I era, as well as from the dime novel. These 
cheap paperbacks included several types 
of stories, detective tales among them. They 
commonly told their tales from the perspective 
of the bad guy. A popular subset of the dime 
novels had tales full of action and violence, set 
in the American West. Much of the spirit of the 
dime novel was inspired by the work of frontier 
authors like James Fenimore Cooper and Brett 
Harte. Interestingly, Doyle cites Harte as one of 
his early literary inspirations.

184
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
 
Few would deny that Doyle revolutionized the infant literary form of the 
detective story with his character Sherlock Holmes. But what most readers 
don’t know is that Doyle pioneered a number of literary trends and genres 
throughout his long writing career. Several writers and historians of mystery 
and detective fiction (including Leslie S. Klinger and Gary Lovisi) believe 
another one should be added to the list: the hard-boiled detective story.
Officially, the first hard-boiled detective story appeared in the early 1920s 
in the pages of Black Mask (see the preceding section). But in reality, the 
tough undercover Pinkerton agent Birdy Edwards, from the flashback half of 
The Valley of Fear, is clearly a hard-boiled detective, and the half of the book 
that’s set in the terrible, mean streets of Vermissa Valley is the world’s first 
hard-boiled detective story. For more on The Valley of Fear, see the upcoming 
section “‘The Valley of Fear’: Doyle Goes Hard-Boiled.”
 
The collection of Holmes stories written during this time, especially the 
ultra-violent The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, is a clear reflection of this 
harder, more violent age. Gone are gas-lit puzzles to entice a consulting 
detective. In its place is a disturbing parade of vitriol-throwing, sexual 
depravity, obsession, psychotic rage, suicide, and disfigurement. In addition 
to these new manifestations, the newer Holmes stories are sometimes violent 
updates on previous Sherlockian motifs. We’re a long way indeed from the 
good old days.
“The Valley of Fear”: Doyle 
Goes Hard-Boiled
Written at the start of this transitional era in crime fiction, The Valley of Fear 
perfectly embodies the fork in the road where hard-boiled split from the 
traditional forms of the Victorian and Edwardian eras. One half of the novel 
is the traditional Sherlock Holmes/British locked-room mystery (refer to 
Chapter 8).
Set in an English manor house, the story features a mysterious (if particularly 
gruesome) murder, with a hinted subplot of possible romantic involvement 
for some of the suspects in the case. Holmes himself is at the top of his 
game, a mature, middle-aged detective in prime form. Many of the standard 
elements are in place: a doubting official police detective, a peculiar clue, a 
foreign influence on the case, and a midnight vigil to catch the perpetrator 
red-handed. Indeed, the English half of this novel is about as perfect a Holmes 
story as you could hope for. But then there’s the other half.

185
 Chapter 10: The Gaslight Goes Away: The “Modern” Stories
The long flashback, set in the gritty, dark coal fields of Pennsylvania, couldn’t 
be more different from the first half of the book. It has private detectives, 
brutal beatings, secret organizations, assassinations, intimidation, and a 
town in the grip of crime. It’s about as dark a story as you can find.
The scenario
Readers of The Valley of Fear undergo the shock of a complete change in 
time, location, and most importantly, tone. The second half of the book 
tells the tale of the terrible secret criminal society known as the Scowrers. 
The members of this organization use terrorism to battle the mine owners 
and murder and intimidation to rule the region and maintain and fund their 
criminal organization. Into this dangerous situation comes the undercover 
Pinkerton detective, Birdy Edwards.
Edwards comes to Vermissa Valley from Chicago, one of the classic cities of 
hard-boiled crime fiction. Using the name of John McMurdo, he comes off as 
a perfect hard-boiled detective. He’s an aggressive, wisecracking, streetwise 
guy who quickly comes to the attention of the Scowrers. Soon, he has infiltrated 
the organization and begins collecting evidence against them. The fact that 
Edwards’s true identity isn’t revealed to the reader until the end of his 
adventure reflects the ambiguous nature of the hard-boiled detective story.
The dialogue
Both the scenario and the dialogue are reminiscent of the hard-boiled 
detective story. At one point, someone asks Edwards why he left Chicago.
“In trouble?”
“Deep.”
Was it a “penitentiary job?”
“And the rest,” he replies.
“Not a killing!”
Edwards/McMurdo responds by saying, “I’ve my own good reasons for 
leaving Chicago, and let that be enough for you. Who are you that you should 
take it on yourself to ask such things?” Doyle adds that the Pinkerton’s gray 
eyes gleamed with “sudden and dangerous anger from behind his glasses.”

186
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
The location
Typically, hard-boiled detectives don’t find themselves in cozy seaside 
villages, or English manor houses. No, if you’re hard-boiled, you’re an urban 
detective, working the dangerous, crime-ridden streets of your city or town. 
With this in mind, there’s no doubt that Vermissa Valley meets the criteria of 
a gritty, dangerous, hard-boiled location.
Doyle describes Edwards’s first view of the town as well as any of his 
successors would a decade later:
The town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and squalor. The broad 
street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible rutted paste of muddy 
snow. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. The numerous gas-lamps 
served only to show more clearly a long line of wooden houses, each with 
its veranda facing the street, unkempt and dirty.
In both style and tone, there’s no doubt that this Pinkerton agent is undercover 
in a city as rough and dangerous as anything described by his hard-boiled 
contemporaries eight years later.
The violence
For readers of The Strand Magazine, whose last encounter with Sherlock 
Holmes was “The Second Stain,” one of the classics of the canon (but nothing 
at all like what they were about to encounter), The Valley of Fear must have 
had them wondering what on earth had happened.
 
Of the four novels, The Valley of Fear has always been ranked last in popularity 
polls. It even ranks pretty low overall. Objectively speaking, it’s an underrated 
masterpiece, a perfect amalgam of classic Holmes with hard-boiled detective 
story, with both halves succeeding. But the sheer shock of this change in tone 
has come at a cost to its popularity.
Part of that shock is in reaction to the book’s violence. The Valley of Fear has 
more violent crime per volume than any other book in the canon. Just a few 
of the more notable examples include attempted strangulation, extortion, 
the shooting of two policemen, a double murder done to repay a “favor,” and 
the brutal beating of the publisher of the local newspaper. The last two are 
described in explicit, gruesome detail.
In describing the double murder, Doyle writes:

187
 Chapter 10: The Gaslight Goes Away: The “Modern” Stories
The manager clapped his two hands to the wound and doubled himself 
up. Then he staggered away; but another of the assassins fired, and 
he went down sidewise, kicking and clawing among a heap of clinkers. 
Menzies, the Scotchman, gave a roar of rage at the sight and rushed with 
an iron spanner at the murderers; but was met by two balls in the face 
which dropped him dead at their very feet.
The beating of the newspaperman (see Figure 10-1) is equally as terrible:
From the room above came a shout, a cry for help, and then the sound 
of trampling feet and of falling chairs. An instant later a gray-haired man 
rushed out on the landing. He was seized before he could get farther, 
and his spectacles came tinkling down to McMurdo’s feet. There was 
a thud and a groan. He was on his face, and half a dozen sticks were 
clattering together as they fell upon him. He writhed, and his long, thin 
limbs quivered under the blows. The others ceased at last; but Baldwin 
[the bad guy], his cruel face set in an infernal smile, was hacking at the 
man’s head, which he vainly endeavored to defend with his arms. His 
white hair was dabbled with patches of blood. Baldwin was still stooping 
over his victim, putting in a short, vicious blow whenever he could see a 
part exposed, when McMurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back.
“You’ll kill the man,” said he. “Drop it!”

188
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
His Last Bow
This short collection of stories, published in 1917, again shows evidence of 
this period of transition. Three of the eight stories are rather conventional 
Sherlock Holmes tales, but five others clearly contain elements reflecting the 
disillusionment following the war, crime’s threat to family and society, and 
the coarsening of the culture in general:
 
✓  “The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge”: In this strange story, many 
commentators detect Doyle hinting at a homosexual liaison between the 
suspect and murder victim — an element that would never have been 
included back in the 1890s. But Doyle — who read of, remembered, and 
often used events from real life — may have had the trial of Oscar Wilde 
in mind.
 
 The celebrated playwright had been caught up in a homosexual scandal, 
went on trial, and was convicted of “gross indecency” and sentenced 
to two years of hard labor in 1895. Doyle knew Wilde, both having 
been guests at a dinner party held by J. M. Stoddard, the publisher of 
Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine. It was at this dinner that each author was 
commissioned to write a story for the magazine. Doyle came out with 
the second Sherlock Holmes novel, The Sign of the Four, and Wilde 
produced The Picture of Dorian Gray.
 
✓ “The Red Circle”: Here’s a second story of secret society and mafia 
involvement in the canon. But unlike the earlier story, “The Six 
Napoleons,” which revolved around a stolen pearl, the motive here is 
driven in part by the unwanted sexual attentions of the head of the 
organization for the wife of a young, married couple whose husband 
is in the gang. Unlike the much earlier “Adventure of the Solitary 
Cyclist,” in which a young unmarried woman is menaced and forced 
into marriage, this story shows crime and predatory behavior now 
having no respect for the boundaries of marriage.
 
✓ “The Dying Detective”: Yes, I know that Holmes is only pretending to 
be sick. And yes, I also know that over the years he’s been rude and 
inconsiderate to his one and only friend, Watson. But in the line of duty 
or not, never before has Holmes been so unutterably mean and heartless 
as he is in this story. Below is one of the most painful passages in the 
canon:
 
 “Holmes,” said I, “you are not yourself. A sick man is but a child, 
and so I will treat you. Whether you like it or not, I will examine 
your symptoms and treat you for them.”
 
 He looked at me with venomous eyes.
 
 “If I am to have a doctor whether I will or not, let me at least have 
someone in whom I have confidence,” said he.
 
 “Then you have none in me?”

189
 Chapter 10: The Gaslight Goes Away: The “Modern” Stories
 
 “In your friendship, certainly. But facts are facts, Watson, and, 
after all, you are only a general practitioner with very limited 
experience and mediocre qualifications. It is painful to have to say 
these things, but you leave me no choice.”
 
 I was bitterly hurt.
 
 That level of cruelty and coldheartedness only appears in these later 
adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
 
✓ “The Cardboard Box”: This story of domestic violence and marital 
infidelity was originally published in The Strand Magazine in 1892. It would 
have been collected into the volume entitled The Memoirs of Sherlock 
Holmes, but Doyle had second thoughts about the appropriateness of the 
tale. Extramarital affairs were just not something you casually wrote 
about for entertainment purposes in 1892, and so it was suppressed 
and left out of the book collection. However, by 1917, things had clearly 
changed, and this story, with its racy themes, felt right at home in this 
collection.
 
✓ “His Last Bow”: Written in 1917 but set on the eve of war (“It was nine 
o’clock at night upon the second of August — the most terrible August 
in the history of the world”), this, the title story of the collection, is 
fraught with the despair and grief that the Great War inflicted on Europe 
and the world. “One might have thought already that God’s curse hung 
heavy over a degenerate world,” writes Doyle in the opening paragraphs 
of the story, perfectly capturing the disillusionment of the new age.
The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes
Things don’t cheer up much in The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, the final 
volume in the Sherlockian canon. In fact, they get worse. The Case-Book is 
replete with shocking motifs and elements unique in all the canon. Brutal 
beatings, disfigurement, paranoia, sexual perversion, suicide — you name it 
and it’s probably in there! It even has, in addition to these new manifestations, 
violent updates on previous Sherlockian motifs. And worst of all, Sherlock 
Holmes writes his own stories.
Just a sampling of the delights to be found in The Case-Book of Sherlock 
Holmes includes:
 
✓ Paranoia, jealousy, and psychotic rage: “Never did I realize till that 
moment how this poor creature hated me,” writes Grace Dunbar, 
governess in the home of millionaire Neil Gibson, of his wife Maria 
Gibson. When Mrs. Gibson detects that her husband wants more than a 
professional relationship with the young governess, it drives the woman 
mad with jealousy and rage. “She was like a mad woman — indeed, I 
think she was a mad woman, subtly mad with the deep power of 

190
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
deception which insane people may have. How else could she have met 
me with unconcern every day and yet had so raging a hatred of me in 
her heart?” How, indeed. Finally, the woman’s hatred drives her to lure 
the young woman to a meeting at Thor Bridge, where she will commit 
suicide, framing her romantic rival for murder. “She poured her whole 
wild fury out in burning and horrible words. I did not even answer — I 
could not. It was dreadful to see her. I put my hands to my ears and 
rushed away. When I left her she was standing, still shrieking out her 
curses at me, in the mouth of the bridge.”
 
✓ Lust-driven science: Some consider “The Creeping Man” to actually 
be a science fiction story. Well, it is fiction, and there is “science,” but 
really, it’s the story of a retirement-age professor’s distasteful desire 
for a woman young enough to be his (at least) daughter. In an effort at 
“rejuvenation,” the professor starts injecting himself with a serum made 
from monkey “glands,” hoping to, as Holmes puts it, “gain his wish by 
turning himself into a younger man.” At the end of the tale, Holmes asks 
the timely question, “What sort of cesspool may not our poor world 
become?”
 
✓ A lonely, self-pitying Holmes: After decades of heaping abuse and 
criticism on Watson’s stories — the very stories that made him rich 
and famous — Sherlock Holmes grudgingly says, “I am compelled to 
admit that, having taken my pen in my hand, I do begin to realize that 
the matter must be presented in such a way as may interest the reader.” 
Gone is the Sherlock who “loathes every form of society with his whole 
bohemian soul.” That was a much younger man. Here is a Holmes who 
says, “The good Watson had at that time deserted me for a wife, the only 
selfish action which I can recall in our association. I was alone.”
 
✓ Savage physical assault and disfigurement: The Case-Book has not one, 
but two facial disfigurements! “The Veiled Lodger” is the terrible story of 
a Mrs. Ronder, a former circus worker who had suffered having her face 
torn off by a lion! Then again, in “The Illustrious Client,” the villain Baron 
Gruner has his face horribly disfigured by a vitriol attack. This story also 
has Holmes being beaten so badly it makes the papers. (For more on 
this story, see the later section “‘The Illustrious Client’ — A canonical 
villain gets really creepy.”)
All in all, the later stories of Sherlock Holmes get progressively rougher as 
they go along. The times had changed, and Holmes had changed with them.

191
 Chapter 10: The Gaslight Goes Away: The “Modern” Stories
The Three Garridebs
By the time the dutiful Sherlockian has read his way deep into the collection 
known as the Case-Book to “The Three Garridebs,” it’s likely that a distinct 
feeling of unease will have set in. Watson makes it clear that most of these 
tales are late in the career of Sherlock Holmes, and supposedly take place 
somewhere in the first decade of the 20th century. And yet, whenever they’re 
supposed to have occurred, there’s no mistaking the fact that these stories 
were penned in the decade known as the Roaring Twenties.
The Valley of Fear may have introduced the hard-boiled detective story to 
readers of The Strand Magazine — and Doyle may have even invented the 
form — but no story brings the spirit of violence and danger home to the 
London of Sherlock Holmes like “The Three Garridebs” does.
A harder, more violent spirit
Many Sherlockian commentators have observed how Doyle recycled the plot 
of “The Red-Headed League” for both “The Stock-Broker’s Clerk” and “The 
Three Garridebs.” Few, however, have noted Doyle’s hard-boiled innovation 
in “The Three Garridebs.” Though the plots are essentially the same, the tone 
of each story couldn’t be more different.
In both “The Red-Headed League” and “The Three Garridebs,” a victim is 
presented with a too-good-to-be-true opportunity that requires him to be out 
of his normal home or workplace. This opportunity is a diversion, allowing 
the criminals access to the victim’s property in order to commit a crime.
What’s vitriol?
Vitriol is another term for sulfuric acid. When 
Baron Gruner got vitriol thrown in his face, he 
undoubtedly suffered the burning of the skin and 
damage to the underlying tissue. Sometimes the 
sulfuric acid can even dissolve the bones of the 
face. If vitriol is thrown in the eyes, it can cause 
blindness. This terrible form of assault did 
actually happen and is still common in many 
Asian countries, where the victims are usually 
female.

192
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
The early passages in “The Red-Headed League” read like comedy. The 
pompous, slow-witted Jabez Wilson’s statement of the case even causes 
Holmes and Watson to burst out laughing! It only gets serious at the end of 
the tale. When the criminal appears he’s quickly apprehended, with any 
gunplay efficiently quashed with a strike from Holmes’s riding crop.
But now, over 30 years later in “The Three Garridebs,” it’s a much different 
scenario. True, a victim is again presented with a too-good-to-be-true 
opportunity that requires him to be out of his normal home or workplace. 
But the story has no comic elements and little sympathy for the object of the 
deception. And unlike “The Red-Headed League,” the story’s climax doesn’t 
end so quickly and cleanly. There is, indeed, gunplay, and it’s Watson who 
is hit:
In an instant he had whisked out a revolver from his breast and had fired 
two shots. I felt a sudden hot sear as if a red-hot iron had been pressed to 
my thigh. There was a crash as Holmes’s pistol came down on the man’s 
head. I had a vision of him sprawling upon the floor with blood running 
down his face. . . .
“The Three Garridebs” was written and published right in the middle of the 
1920s, and shortly after its author had made two extensive tours of America 
promoting spiritualism. These tours took Doyle and his family across the 
length and breadth of the U.S. This lengthy exposure to 1920s America is 
clearly reflected in the Case-Book tales and especially “The Three Garridebs.”
 
“The Three Garridebs” was actually first published in Collier’s Weekly on 
October 25, 1924, fittingly enough in America. Its appearance in The Strand 
Magazine came on January 19, 1925, where it was illustrated by Howard K. 
Elcock.
 
“The Three Garridebs” isn’t merely the reflection of Doyle’s experiences of 
America in the 1920s. It wasn’t the tours through Chicago and Los Angeles 
alone that imparted the harder, more violent spirit to the Case-Book tales in 
general, and “The Three Garridebs” in particular. Instead, this story betrays 
the conscious influence of the hard-boiled detective story.
A change in tone
That traces of Black Mask found their way, consciously or unconsciously, 
into the stories from Case-Book, and especially “The Three Garridebs,” seems 
obvious upon examination. You can almost hear the tough-guy hard-boiled 
detective delivering Watson’s opening lines:

193
 Chapter 10: The Gaslight Goes Away: The “Modern” Stories
It may have been a comedy, or it may have been a tragedy. It cost one 
man his reason, it cost me a blood-letting, and it cost yet another man the 
penalties of the law. Yet there was certainly an element of comedy. Well, 
you shall judge for yourselves.
Then there is the name . . . no, not “Garrideb.” The villain’s name . . . the 
blunt, crude, frightening name of “Killer Evans,” a hardened criminal, “aged 
forty-four. Native of Chicago. Known to have shot three men in the States. 
Escaped from penitentiary through political influence.” No retired colonels, 
professors, or politicians here. Instead, it’s a “very dangerous man, [who] 
usually carries arms and is prepared to use them.”
Elcock’s illustrations for “The Three Garridebs” also reflect this new tone 
(see Figure 10-2 and Figure 10-3). The drawings illustrating the moments just 
before the arrest of Killer Evans show drawn guns, flying chairs, a gunshot 
victim, and the detective pistol-whipping the perpetrator. It’s a moment that 
Holmes punctuates by saying, “If you had killed Watson, you would not have 
got out of this room alive.”

“The Illustrious Client” — A canonical 
villain gets really creepy
“The Illustrious Client” is a very late adventure of Sherlock Holmes, published 
in 1924. As far as Holmes stories go, it stands out for featuring a villain who is 
utterly unique in the canon: Baron Adelbert Gruner, a sexual predator.
Holmes is approached by an anonymous “illustrious client” (it doesn’t take a 
Sherlock Holmes to figure out that this is Edward the VII, King of England) to 
prevent the upcoming wedding of Violet de Merville to Baron Gruner. Miss de 
Merville’s father is a friend of the “illustrious client,” and so as a favor to all 
concerned, Gruner must be warned off.
Holmes, who already is aware of the baron’s reputation, refers to him as “the 
Austrian murderer” and believes he killed his previous wife on a journey 
through the Alps. Holmes takes the case.
Gone are the charming street urchins from the early canon who help out 
the Great Detective when needed. Now Holmes turns to Shinwell Johnson, 
who “made his name first as a very dangerous villain and served two terms 
at Parkhurst,” as Watson says, but then who “repented and allied himself to 
Holmes, acting as his agent in the huge criminal underworld of London.” Yes, 
indeed — things are a bit rougher in the 1920s.

195
 Chapter 10: The Gaslight Goes Away: The “Modern” Stories
Johnson connects Holmes with Kitty Winter, a woman down and out. “What 
I am Adelbert Gruner made me,” she tells Holmes. Gruner, it seems, “collects 
women, and takes a pride in his collection, as some men collect moths or 
butterflies.” Kitty Winter knows all about it, saying, “He had it all in [a] book. 
Snapshot photographs, names, details, everything about them. It was a 
beastly book — a book no man, even if he had come from the gutter, could 
have put together. But it was Adelbert Gruner’s book all the same. ‘Souls I 
have ruined.’”
A villain who “collects women,” who takes photographs and keeps them in 
a book, who “ruins” them and moves on to the next. This is amazing, almost 
unbelievable material for the adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
 
But then, the same can be said about many of the stories found in the later 
part of the canon. In addition to great stories about Holmes and Watson, the 
later stories have increased violence and more mature themes, and some are 
even hard-boiled detective tales, all showing that Sherlock Holmes changed 
with the times. His adventures were written not as Victorian period pieces, 
but as vital, modern crime stories.

Chapter 11
Common Themes and Threads
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at elements of the stories that remain constant
▶ Combining rationalism and religion in the tales
▶ Paying attention to the little things: Holmes’s reliance on trifles
V
illains come and go. Clients come and go. Times change, and so does 
the tone of the canon itself. And yet, within the Sherlock Holmes stories, 
it wasn’t all change all the time. Despite this ever-changing, ever-evolving 
kaleidoscope of characters and events, some things were constant.
In this chapter, I look at those elements — persons, places, and things — that 
were constants throughout the course of the Holmes stories. I also examine 
themes and motifs that characterize not only individual characters but also 
the stories as a whole.
Some Things Never Change
Part of the appeal of the Sherlock Holmes stories has to do with a cozy 
familiarity with certain elements found in the tales. This is particularly true 
for repeat readers. Why would a person come back, over and over again, 
to a set of stories, particularly mystery stories, after the solution has been 
revealed, the stolen jewel recovered, and the murderer apprehended?
 
Elements, ideas, and themes are repeated throughout the canon that draw 
the reader back. For some, it’s like visiting old, familiar friends. For others, 
perhaps the ideals embodied and promoted by the tales (whether overtly 
or subtly) offer reassurance and pleasure. Whatever the reason is, it’s often 
rooted in the enduring elements of the Sherlockian canon, elements that 
appear throughout the stories, offering a sense of continuity to an otherwise 
constantly changing panorama.

198
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Persons
Readers meet a lot of people in the Holmes stories — Arthur Conan Doyle 
introduces at least 300 characters over the course of the canon’s 60 stories. 
Most are story-specific, meaning they show up in an individual story, only to 
vanish from the scene when the adventure is concluded.
Some go on to be remembered, even if they never make an actual personal 
appearance. Holmes remembers and references Professor Moriarty and his 
right-hand man, Col. Sebastian Moran, well past their appearances.
But among the parade of characters that the reader encounters in Watson’s 
accounts of the Great Detective, a handful are, more or less, around from 
beginning to end. For the faithful reader, this core of canonical characters 
forms the nucleus around which the rest of the names orbit.
Sherlock Holmes
Of course, these are the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, so naturally, Holmes 
features in every tale. Holmes springs to life in A Study in Scarlet, and from 
the beginning, he’s a masterful, fully realized character. The power of 
Sherlock Holmes as a character draws readers back time and again to his 
adventures.
As a character, Holmes is moody (maybe even manic at times) and 
unapologetically indulges in several bad habits, including tobacco and 
drugs. He’s eccentric, vain, and susceptible to flattery. He can be petulant 
and rude. And yet, his natural empathy for the victimized and his unfailing 
sense of fair play and justice make him the man to turn to. “I have heard 
of you, Mr. Holmes,” says Violet Hunter from “The Speckled Band.” “I have 
heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore 
need. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too,” she pleads, “and 
at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me?”
 
Sherlock Holmes is so real to his readers that he holds a number of distinctions 
unique in all of literature:
 
✓ He not only lived, but he’s still alive. Despite being a fictional character 
of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, he remains a living person in 
the minds of many. In 2008, a survey in England revealed that 58 percent 
of British citizens believed Sherlock Holmes was a real, historical figure. 
To this day, letters to Holmes arrive at 221b Baker Street (originally the 
home office of the Abbey National Building Society, and now home to the 
Sherlock Holmes Museum). These letters ask for interviews, autographs, 
and, most amazing of all, advice or help in solving a mystery. They 
contain invitations, birthday and Christmas cards, and occasionally 
presents. They arrive from every corner of the world and have been 
doing so for over 50 years.

199
 Chapter 11: Common Themes and Threads
 
✓ The books have never gone out of print. Since their original publication, 
the Sherlock Holmes stories have never been out of print. In addition to 
English-language editions, the canon has been translated into over 65 
languages. Nearly every language on earth — from Afrikaans to Yiddish — 
has produced an edition of the Holmes stories. The canon has even been 
translated into Braille, shorthand, and Latin!
 
✓ Sherlock Holmes is a movie star. More than 260 movies, hundreds 
of television episodes, two musicals, and even a ballet have featured 
the exploits of Sherlock Holmes. (For more on dramatic adaptations of 
Holmes, see Chapter 14.)
John H. Watson, MD
John H. Watson is the loyal companion and stalwart friend of detective 
Sherlock Holmes. Indeed, though Holmes has a wide circle of acquaintances 
because of his profession, when it comes to friends, Watson is it. As Holmes 
characterized his friendship to Watson, “Except yourself I have none.”
 
Despite the popular misconception of Holmes’s sidekick as a dimwitted old 
man, Watson is an intelligent man who plays a vital role in the crime-solving 
partnership. And a partnership it is. Time and again, Watson accompanies 
Holmes on cases, stands in for the detective when needed, acts as a sounding 
board when Sherlock is working out a problem, runs errands, leaves his own 
medical practice at the drop of a hat to assist Holmes in an investigation, and 
even breaks the law with him (all in the name of a good cause). And, most 
important, Watson is Holmes’s biographer — he tells the tales.
The good doctor’s admiration for his friend is frank and unapologetic. In A 
Study in Scarlet, toward the end of the book, after Holmes has successfully 
apprehended the criminal, Watson says, “Your merits should be publicly 
recognized. You should publish an account of the case. If you won’t, I will for 
you.” And when he believes Holmes has died ridding the world of Professor 
Moriarty, he movingly writes he “shall ever regard [Sherlock Holmes] as the 
best and the wisest man whom I have ever known.”
Watson remains remarkably steady throughout the canon. He marries, he 
moves out, he finds himself single again, he moves back in, and all the 
while, like the reader, he finds the lure of Baker Street and Sherlock Holmes 
irresistible. Even when Holmes heaps abuse on Watson’s writing or points 
out all the doctor’s mistakes in trying to use observation and deduction 
as Holmes does, Watson remains loyal. Holmes knows it, too. In their final 
recorded adventure together, “His Last Bow,” Holmes says to his friend, 
“Good old Watson! You are the one fixed point in a changing age.”
Inspector Lestrade
Inspector G. Lestrade is the best-known Scotland Yard detective in the canon. 
In fact, he may be the best-known Scotland Yard detective in either fiction or 
real life.

200
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Lestrade is in the very first story, A Study in Scarlet, where he appears with 
his professional rival, Inspector Gregson. In this early tale, neither of the two 
official officers gets much praise from Sherlock Holmes. Holmes refers to 
them as “the best of a bad lot,” adding that they’re “both quick and energetic, 
but conventional — shockingly so.” But in those early days the relationship 
between the gifted consulting detective and the veteran Scotland Yarder was 
still new.
However, over time, Lestrade grows on Holmes — so much so that Sherlock 
regularly allows Lestrade to take credit for solving cases that Holmes has 
cracked, and he’s often hailed in the papers as one of the best detectives at 
Scotland Yard. By the time of The Hound of the Baskervilles, Holmes openly 
states that Lestrade “is the best of the professionals,” and at another time, 
while decrying his lack of imagination, Holmes acknowledges that the little 
ferret-faced detective is “as tenacious as a bulldog when he once understands 
what he has to do.”
 
Inspector Lestrade has a long, continuing presence in the canon. Indeed, he’s 
one of the fixtures of the Baker Street scene, a continuing character whose 
entry into the story is always welcome, by both readers and Holmes himself. 
And over time, their mutual enmity softens, and the sneering, scoffing, 
professional rival morphs into an admiring, professional colleague.
Mrs. Hudson
The landlady of 221b Baker Street is, as Watson puts it, “a long-suffering 
woman.” The list of grievances is long: “Not only was her first floor flat 
invaded at all hours by throngs of singular and often undesirable characters,” 
elaborates Watson, “but her remarkable lodger showed an eccentricity and 
irregularity in his life which must have sorely tried her patience. His incredible 
untidyness, his addiction to music at all hours, his occasional rifle practice 
within doors, his weird and often malodorous scientific experiments, and the 
atmosphere of violence and danger which hung around him, made him the 
very worst tenant in London.”
With this laundry list of reasons for eviction, why does Mrs. Hudson allow 
Sherlock Holmes to remain at Baker Street? For readers of the canon, the 
answer is simple — Holmes has the same hold on her imagination and affection 
as he does on readers. “The landlady stood in the deepest awe of him,” says 
Watson, who also adds a final, and crucial, element. “She was fond of him, too, 
for he had a remarkable gentleness and courtesy in his dealings with women.”
 
The popular image of Mrs. Hudson is one of a plump, sixtyish woman with a 
Scotch accent who acts as a sort of den mother to the boys of Baker Street. 
But this image is in some respects inaccurate. For instance, about her age — 
she probably isn’t much more than ten years older than Sherlock. And as for 
ruling Baker Street like a den mother, we know from Watson’s ironclad authority 
that Mrs. Hudson “never dared to interfere with him, however outrageous his 
proceedings might seem.”

201
 Chapter 11: Common Themes and Threads
However, there’s no denying that Mrs. Hudson provides a much needed 
touch of domesticity to the very masculine residence of Holmes and Watson. 
She certainly does the cooking and eventually protests when the general 
untidiness of their apartments reaches a critical mass. She’s a true member 
of the Baker Street family: Whether it’s cooking the Christmas goose or 
moving a wax dummy while crawling on the floor to avoid air guns, Mrs. 
Hudson could always be counted on.
Places
The 60 Sherlock Holmes adventures take the reader to many places — 
Dartmoor, the Reichenbach Falls, even the United States. But despite the 
ever-changing locations and scenery, some places are consistent throughout 
the adventures.
221b Baker Street
The residence of Holmes and Watson is perhaps the most unchanging 
element in all the stories. Watson describes the apartment as “consisting 
of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, 
cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows.”
Who is Martha?
The first name of Mrs. Hudson is never stated 
in the canon. However, since the 1930s, 
Sherlockians have presumed that it’s Martha. 
How did the landlady of 221b get this name? 
Blame it on a Sherlockian named Vincent 
Starrett. In 1933, Starrett wrote an essay 
titled “The Singular Adventures of Martha 
Hudson.” This essay first appeared in Baker 
Street Studies, a book of Sherlockiana by H.W. 
Bell, and it was reprinted in a later edition of 
Starrett’s own landmark volume, The Private 
Life of Sherlock Holmes.
In the short story “His Last Bow,” the German 
spy’s English housekeeper is actually an agent 
of Sherlock Holmes, and her name is Martha. 
“Old Martha,” as Holmes refers to her, “has 
played her part to admiration. I got her the 
situation here when first I took the matter up.” 
Starrett, in his essay, assumes that Martha is 
none other than Mrs. Hudson, who Holmes 
takes with him in retirement and then places as 
his own spy in the house of the German agent. 
Thus, Martha Hudson.
Unfortunately, there’s no evidence whatsoever 
that the woman in “His Last Bow” really is 
Mrs. Hudson. It’s true that Mrs. Hudson would 
have been up to the task, but the fact that 
Holmes calls her “Martha” when he never, 
ever addressed his landlady by anything but 
the respectful “Mrs. Hudson” weighs heavily 
against them being the same person. Whoever 
Martha was, she wasn’t Mrs. Hudson.

202
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
 
Throughout the tales, nearly every adventure either begins or ends in 221b. 
And despite the fact that Holmes and Watson live there for nearly 20 years 
(well, Watson keeps moving in and out, depending on his marital status!), 
the apartment remains virtually unchanged from when they move in to the 
last glimpse the reader sees of it decades later. Oh sure, there are some 
modernizations along the way — like Holmes getting a telephone — but in 
nearly every way, 221b Baker Street remains timeless.
London
In “The Red-Headed League,” Holmes remarks to Watson, “It is a hobby of 
mine to have an exact knowledge of London.” For Holmes, London is the 
great city. In it he sees romance, adventure, mystery, and crime continually 
playing out all around him. In “A Case of Identity,” he articulates his feelings 
about London and what it offers:
“If we could fly out of that window hand in hand,” he explains, “hover 
over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer 
things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, 
the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through 
generation, and leading to the most outré results, it would make all 
fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale 
and unprofitable.”
And he’s right. In “The Blue Carbuncle,” when Watson finds Holmes examining 
a battered hat one December morning, he asks if it’s connected to a crime. 
No, explains Holmes. It’s “only one of those whimsical little incidents which 
will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other 
within the space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so 
dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events may be 
expected to take place, and many a little problem will be presented which 
may be striking and bizarre without being criminal.”
 
Sherlock Holmes has always been associated with London. It’s where he 
lived and worked, and it’s the city he loved. In “The Final Problem,” when 
he’s well aware that his battle with Professor Moriarty could end in his death, 
he remarks, “If my record were closed to-night I could still survey it with 
equanimity. The air of London is the sweeter for my presence.”
Things
Certain things — certain objects — are universally associated with Sherlock 
Holmes and appear throughout the stories, offering continuity and familiarity. 
All these items help build up a mental picture of the Great Detective and give 
insight into his habits and surroundings.

203
 Chapter 11: Common Themes and Threads
Violin
One of the most iconic items associated with Holmes is the violin. Holmes 
was an accomplished musician, and right at the very first meeting of Holmes 
and Watson, an anxious Sherlock asks Watson if he minds violin playing.
“It depends on the player,” answers Watson. “A well-played violin is a 
treat for the gods — a badly played one —”
“Oh, that’s all right,” replies Holmes with a laugh, “I think we may 
consider the thing as settled. . . .”
Sherlock wrote articles on music for publication and was an unconventional 
violinist. Watson remarks that Holmes’s powers on the instrument were 
“very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That he 
could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he 
has played me some of Mendelssohn’s Lieder, and other favorites.” But when 
left to his own devices, “he would seldom produce any music or attempt any 
recognized air. Leaning back in his armchair of an evening, he would close 
his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his 
knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally 
they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which 
possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether 
the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy, was more than I could 
determine.”
Just when Watson began to find these strange concerts almost unbearable, 
Holmes “terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of 
my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.”
Dressing gown
Another iconic item associated with Holmes is the dressing gown. Holmes 
was in the habit of wearing his dressing gown at home, even when being 
visited by a client or performing some chemical experiment.
 
A dressing gown was a robe that people wore, especially while dressing or 
resting at home. It was often made of silk, sometimes quilted, and usually 
elegant and expensive. Today, the closest thing to the dressing gown is the 
bathrobe, but they aren’t quite the same thing.
It was a common occurrence for Watson to return to Baker Street to find the 
room full of tobacco smoke, and “Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an 
armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips.”
Sherlockians have debated whether Holmes owned three dressing gowns or 
just one. Over the course of the stories, Holmes’s gown is described as being 

204
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
blue, then purple, and then “mouse-colored.” Some believe this points to 
three separate gowns. Others, however, theorize that Holmes had just one 
gown and it was originally blue, then faded to purple, and finally turned to 
mouse-color with age.
Smoking (pipes, cigars, cigarettes)
Next to the deerstalker cap, which I talk about later in the chapter, no object 
is more associated with Sherlock Holmes than a pipe. Throughout the canon, 
smoking in all its forms is a constant cultural presence. Of the 60 cases, 
only 4 are without some reference to smoking. Tobacco smoke is the very 
atmosphere of Baker Street.
Holmes was a world-class smoker, enjoying pipes, cigars, and cigarettes. 
Smoking was, for him, not only a pleasant pastime but also actually part of 
the intellectual process. In “The Red-Headed League,” when contemplating 
his client’s peculiar case, Holmes says to Watson, “It is quite a three pipe 
problem, and I beg that you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” The 
sedative nature of nicotine must have helped relax and focus his mind. In 
addition to the physical effects, there almost certainly was a psychological 
one as well.
Pipes
Holmes is remembered primarily as a pipe smoker, and pipe smoking shows 
up in over 22 cases. Sherlock smoked a variety of pipes, depending on his 
mood. His favorites include an old black, oily clay pipe, a briar (a pipe made 
from the root of a briar plant), and less frequently, a long-stemmed cherry-
wood. When it came to tobacco, he preferred the strong, smelly version 
called “shag.”
But you may be wondering, “Where is the big curly yellow pipe with the white 
top? Isn’t that what Sherlock Holmes smokes?” That big, distinctive pipe is 
called a calabash. The main body of the calabash pipe is the curving, yellow or 
golden stem of the African calabash gourd. The white bowl, which is on the 
top of the pipe, is where the tobacco goes. It’s usually made of meerschaum, 
which is a soft white mineral. The bowl is inserted into the hollowed-out 
gourd stem.
 
In popular mythology, it’s the Sherlock Holmes pipe. The only problem is, 
Holmes never smoked a calabash pipe. That bit of apocryphal lore comes from 
the actor William Gillette, who became famous playing the Great Detective on 
stage in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The calabash’s low center of 
gravity made it an easy one for the actor to hold in his mouth while on stage. 
To his generation, William Gillette was Sherlock Holmes, and his hundreds of 
performances forever fixed the large, curly calabash as the image of Holmes’s 
pipe.

205
 Chapter 11: Common Themes and Threads
Cigars
Holmes does smoke cigars, but they don’t seem to be his first choice. Unlike 
his choice in pipe tobacco, Holmes’s taste in cigars seems to be a little better. 
For instance, in one scene, Watson joins Holmes at an Italian restaurant 
before heading out on a night of burglary.
As Watson enters, he sees Holmes “at a little round table near the door of the 
garish Italian restaurant.”
“Have you had something to eat? Then join me in a coffee and curacao. 
Try one of the proprietor’s cigars. They are less poisonous than one would 
expect.”
That Holmes commented on the “less-poisonous” quality of the cigars 
indicates that, at least when it comes to cigars, Holmes has standards!
Cigarettes
Sherlock Holmes also smokes cigarettes. Indeed, cigarettes may have been 
his favorite smoke. Holmes’s consumption of cigarettes seems to have been 
as great as his consumption of pipe tobacco. In “The Boscombe Valley 
Mystery,” he tells Lestrade that he has “a caseful of cigarettes here which 
need smoking,” truly the words of a champion smoker.
In “The Golden Pince-Nez,” Holmes uses his love of cigarette smoking to lay 
down a field of ash on the floor in order to detect footprints. This took a lot 
of cigarettes in a very small amount of time, something that a light smoker 
would have done with difficulty. However, Holmes rather enjoys the experience, 
and the pricey imported cigarettes of Professor Coram.
Chemical experiments
According to Watson’s friend, Stamford, Holmes is a “first class chemist,” 
a pursuit he enjoys throughout the canon. According to all the evidence of 
the stories, Stamford is right. Holmes’s use of logic and scientific method 
demonstrates a discipline and skill that he obviously makes good use of in 
the chemical corner of 221b Baker Street. Watson’s own rating of Holmes’s 
chemical abilities is “profound,” and later “eccentric.” But the evidence is 
good that Holmes was a very good chemist.
For instance, in The Sign of the Four, Holmes tells Watson, “I gave my mind 
a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis.” Later, in “The Gloria 
Scott,” Holmes tells how, while in college, he took “the long vacation between 
semesters” and “spent seven weeks working out a few experiments in Organic 
Chemistry.”

Holmes worked on a variety of chemical experiments and challenges. 
Throughout the 60 stories, he plunges into experiments involving acetones, 
coal tar derivatives, the analysis of barium compounds, and, not least of all, a 
radical new blood test.
Finally, the canon has many references to Holmes’s chemical bench in the 
corner of their Baker Street sitting room, and it was not uncommon for 
Watson to come home and find their chambers stinking to high heaven with 
some smelly, noxious chemical experiment that Holmes was running. Poor 
Watson!
The deerstalker cap
Nothing invokes the image of Sherlock Holmes like the famous deerstalker 
hat. The deerstalker’s best-known features are the fore and aft brims, and its 
two side flaps that tie up on the top with a ribbon (see Figure 11-1).
 
Originally created for hunters and outdoorsmen, the cap has dual brims that 
provide protection from the sun on the face and neck. When it’s cold, the 
wearer can tie the side flaps below the chin, helping to keep the ears warmer 
in cold weather and high winds. Otherwise, the side flaps are kept out of the 
way by keeping them tied up over the crown of the hat. Most deerstalkers 
come in a checkered or plaid pattern, and it’s believed that, for hunters, this 
provides camouflage.
About that blood test
Back in Victorian times, it was almost 
impossible to test a stain to determine if it was 
blood, let alone what type of blood it was. This 
was way before DNA analysis and blood typing. 
So being able to tell if a stain on a suspect’s 
clothes was indeed blood and not some other 
stain like ink or rust would be a huge advance 
in the detection of crime. It was in the very first 
book, A Study in Scarlet, that Holmes is at the 
moment of his big breakthrough, when, just as 
Watson enters the room, Holmes shouts out:
“I’ve found it. I’ve found it . . . I have found a 
reagent which is precipitated by haemoglobin 
and by nothing else . . . No doubt you see the 
significance of this discovery of mine?”
Watson, a trained doctor, didn’t get it, saying, 
“It is interesting chemically no doubt, but 
practically —”
Holmes quickly replies, “Why, man, it is the 
most practical medico-legal discovery for 
years. Don’t you see that it gives us an infallible 
test for blood stains?”
Capable of detecting one part in a million, the 
Sherlock Holmes blood test was a revolutionary 
step forward over the guaiacum test, which 
was, at that time, the gold standard of blood 
testing. The guaiacum test was only good for 
one part in one hundred thousand.

This style of hat existed before Sherlock Holmes, but ever since the Great 
Detective was depicted wearing it, the deerstalker has been identified with 
Holmes. But here’s the surprise: Arthur Conan Doyle never actually wrote that 
Sherlock Holmes wore a deerstalker! So, how did this distinctive headgear 
become associated so firmly with Holmes? It all has to do with the original 
illustrator of the stories.
Sidney Paget was the original illustrator of the Holmes stories in The Strand 
Magazine. His brother Walter was also an illustrator and was the artist the 
Strand editors originally intended to hire. However, they accidentally wrote 
to Sidney instead, and the die was cast. It turned out to be a fateful mistake, 
as Sidney (who used his brother Walter as his model) created the popular 
image of the detective — a model that illustrators, actors, and filmmakers 
have been imitating to this day (see Figure 11-2).
 
It was Paget who put first put Holmes in the deerstalker. In several stories, 
Doyle described Holmes as wearing an “ear-flapped travelling cap.” Paget, who 
himself wore a deerstalker at his home in the country, interpreted this as his 
own favorite hat and stuck it on Sherlock’s head. And there it has been ever 
since.

Rationalism and Religion in the 
Canon of Sherlock Holmes
When discussing Sherlock Holmes, many cite the fact that he’s a “scientific” 
detective. Logic, deduction, evidence — these are the hallmarks defining the 
nature of the Great Detective. But this is an incomplete picture. In reality, the 
canon has twin threads running through it. At certain times those threads are 
in harmony, and at other times they seem to conflict. These are the themes of 
rationalism and religion, and both inform the nature of the Holmes stories.
The rational detective
Certainly, the best-known and most obvious theme running through the 
canon is rationalism. Rationalism is a means of knowing the universe that 
appeals to reason as a source of knowledge and understanding. Truth is 
derived by a method (there’s Holmes’s own word: “You know my methods, 
Watson”) of intellectual and deductive reasoning.

209
 Chapter 11: Common Themes and Threads
Holmes’s own method was based on drawing inferences from the careful 
study of evidence. When faced with more than one possible theory, he would 
choose the one that covered the most. “It is an old maxim of mine,” he tells 
Watson, “that when you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, 
however improbable, must be the truth.”
One tenet of rationalism argues that it’s possible to deduce full knowledge on 
a subject by learning a few fundamental principles about it. And sure enough, 
right there in the very first Holmes story, Holmes has written an article in a 
magazine titled “The Book of Life,” in which he writes:
From a drop of water a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic 
or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life 
is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a 
single link of it.
Watson, upon reading this, is skeptical. But after he’s seen Sherlock in action 
and experienced firsthand the results of Holmes’s “method,” he exclaims, 
“you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be 
brought in this world.” In a later story, Holmes tells Watson that “true cold 
reason” is that “which I place above all things.” There’s no doubt Holmes was 
a rationalist when it came to his craft.
Holmes’s rationalism and the supernatural
On three occasions in the canon, cases come to Baker Street that have 
supernatural overtones. These bizarre cases present situations that, at first 
glance, seem to defy Sherlock Holmes’s belief in “cold true logic.” When 
these seemingly supernatural events invade the familiar, known world of 
19th-century England, the implications are terrifying. Fortunately, we have 
Sherlock Holmes on our side.
 
Doyle’s personal belief in spiritualism and psychic phenomenon seems to fly 
in the face of Holmes’s scientific rationalism. In certain stories, which I discuss in 
the following sections, and especially in The Hound of the Baskervilles, Doyle’s 
most famous tale, the reader sees what is surely a reflection of the author’s 
own struggles with the subject — belief in the supernatural colliding with the 
philosophy of rationalism. Doyle found a way to reconcile the two, and he had 
Sherlock Holmes do the same.
The Hound of the Baskervilles
The most famous of all the Holmes stories begins with the presentation of 
the Baskerville curse, preserved on an ancient parchment. Right out of the 
gate, readers are absorbed in not only a tale of Gothic mystery but also a 
creepy, supernatural horror story. After reading the document, Dr. Mortimer, 
a trained man of science, confesses his belief that the hound is supernatural.

210
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Sherlock Holmes is skeptical. When Mortimer wonders whether Sir Henry 
Baskerville, the new heir, will be safe out on the moors of Baskerville Hall, 
Holmes replies by saying, “But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, 
it could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A devil 
with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable a 
thing.”
The Devil’s Foot
In this tale, Holmes and Watson investigate the mysterious and disturbing case 
of an entire family being driven out of their minds (one of them to death). 
The surviving family member, Mr. Mortimer Tregennis, and the local vicar, a 
Mr. Roundhay, come to solicit Holmes’s help. It seems the Tregennis family 
had been playing cards in the evening. When it got late, Mortimer Tregennis 
left, leaving his two brothers and sister around the table. In the morning, he 
found them still at the table, the brothers completely insane, and the sister 
dead.
“I take it that you have no theory yourself which can in any way account for 
them?” asks Holmes.
“It’s devilish, Mr. Holmes, devilish!” replies Mortimer Tregennis. “It is not of 
this world.”
Not quite ready to buy into a supernatural cause, Holmes replies by saying, 
“I fear that if the matter is beyond humanity it is certainly beyond me. Yet we 
must exhaust all natural explanations before we fall back upon such a theory 
as this.”
The Sussex Vampire
When a new client, Robert Ferguson, becomes convinced that his wife is a 
vampire preying on their infant son, he comes to Sherlock Holmes for help. 
He tells Holmes that the baby’s mother has been sucking blood from the 
child’s neck, and he even once caught her in the act, crouching over the baby 
with blood on her lips.
The vampire theory doesn’t get much traction with Holmes. “Rubbish, 
Watson, rubbish! What have we to do with walking corpses who can only be 
held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts? It’s pure lunacy.” 
He goes on to say quite definitively, “Are we to give serious attention to such 
things? This agency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must 
remain. The world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply.”

211
 Chapter 11: Common Themes and Threads
Sherlock Holmes and religion
Much speculation has gone into the religious views and beliefs of Sherlock 
Holmes since he first appeared. Many have pondered what, if any, religious 
faith Holmes held. Did he adopt some form of eastern religion following his 
three-year hiatus? Was he an atheist? Just what were his views? It’s possible 
to understand the true religious philosophy of Holmes — you just need to 
look at what the man himself said on the subject.
 
On the subject of religion, Holmes, like many of his contemporaries, reflects 
the views of William Paley, an English philosopher and theologian from the 
preceding century. Regarding the existence of God, Paley, in his landmark 
work Natural Theology (1802), uses the analogy of a watch. To paraphrase, if a 
man walking across a field finds a watch, based on the intricacy of its design 
and interrelated moving parts, the man would naturally conclude that “the 
watch must have had a maker: that there must have existed, at some time, and 
at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed it for the purpose 
which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, 
and designed its use.” He adds that, as further evidence, the “design of the 
contrivance is beneficial” and the designer “has superadded pleasure to 
animal sensations beyond what was necessary for any other purpose.”
William Paley
Born in Peterborough, England, and educated 
at Christ’s College, University of Cambridge, 
where he later lectured, William Paley was 
ordained in the Church of England in 1767. 
Paley published numerous popular and 
respected books on science and religion over 
the course of his lifetime, but it was in 1802 that 
he published his most important work, Natural 
Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and 
Attributes of the Deity.
Natural Theology is Paley’s attempt to show 
that theistic belief rests on a logical basis of 
observation and reason, and need not be a 
matter of pure faith alone. He argues that an 
examination of nature itself reveals evidence 
of design. Appearing nearly six decades before 
Darwin’s The Origin of Species, Paley’s book 
cast a long shadow on the philosophical, 
religious, and scientific thought of his age. 
Charles Darwin, the giant of late-19th-century 
thought whose theory of natural selection 
and evolution went so far to challenge Paley’s 
argument, admits to having memorized long 
passages of Natural Theology.

212
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
For many familiar with Holmes’s comments on religious matters, Paley’s 
argument sounds familiar. Two excerpts follow illustrating this point. The 
first is Holmes’s remarks at the conclusion of “The Cardboard Box”:
“What is the meaning of it, Watson?” said Holmes solemnly as he laid 
down the paper. “What object is served by this circle of misery and 
violence and fear? It must tend to some end, or else our universe is 
ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. But what end? There is the great 
standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from an 
answer as ever.”
The second is his monologue on the moss rose from “The Naval Treaty”:
“What a lovely thing a rose is!”
He walked past the couch to the open window and held up the drooping 
stalk of a moss-rose, looking down at the dainty blend of crimson and 
green. It was a new phase of his character to me, for I had never before 
seen him show any keen interest in natural objects.
“There is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in religion,” said 
he, leaning with his back against the shutters. “It can be built up as an 
exact science by the reasoner. Our highest assurance of the goodness 
of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. All other things, our 
powers, our desires, our food, are all really necessary for our existence in 
the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are an 
embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only goodness which gives 
extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers.”
Holmes’s deduction from the flowers was not unique to him — in fact, it was 
a commonplace notion widely held by people in the Victorian age. Though 
these are perhaps the most concise expressions of Holmes’s own religious 
feelings, they certainly aren’t the only ones, and they give us a pretty good 
idea of Holmes’s religious philosophy.
 
That Holmes was a theist — that he believed in the divine creation of the 
universe, that he was in some sense religious, that he was in agreement with 
the concept that nature revealed evidence of both the existence and attributes 
of God — is apparent from his own words. And despite the growing influence 
of Darwin and the growing trend of Victorian scientific thought, Holmes’s 
views are also consistent with the majority of his fellow Englishmen at that 
time.
Sherlock Holmes expresses religious sentiment in many instances throughout 
the canon. Some examples include:
 
✓ “The Boscombe Valley Mystery”: Following the pathetic confession of 
John Turner comes the following passage:

213
 Chapter 11: Common Themes and Threads
 
 “God help us!” said Holmes after a long silence. “Why does fate 
play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a 
case as this that I do not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, 
but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.’”
 
✓ “The Empty House”: As Holmes recounts his fateful escape from the 
Reichenbach Falls, he clearly credits his survival:
 
 “[Climbing down] was a hundred times more difficult than getting 
up. But I had no time to think of the danger, for another stone sang 
past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge. Halfway 
down I slipped, but, by the blessing of God, I landed, torn and 
bleeding, upon the path.”
Other theories on Sherlock’s religious views
Though the religious views of Sherlock Holmes 
point to 19th-century Church of England, other 
theories have been put forward over the years. 
Some of them include:
 ✓ Sherlock Holmes was a spiritualist: 
Some commentators attempt to persuade 
readers that Holmes was in fact a 
spiritualist, even in the face of Holmes’s 
blunt declaration from “The Sussex 
Vampire” that “No ghosts need apply!” 
Because Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a 
spiritualist, the argument is that many of 
Doyle’s own beliefs are embedded in his 
detective. Though this is undoubtedly true 
as a generalization, it is false in specifics. 
Doyle himself acknowledged as much, 
once pointing out that the “creation and 
creator are not identical.”
 ✓ Sherlock Holmes was an atheist: Many 
point to Holmes’s recommendation to 
Watson of Winwood Reade’s book, The 
Martyrdom of Man. In The Sign of the Four, 
Holmes refers to The Martyrdom of Man 
as “one of the most remarkable [books] 
ever penned.” Reade believed that the 
destruction of both Christianity and a belief 
in God were essential to the progress of 
man. However, calling a book “remarkable” 
is a far cry from agreeing with it.
 ✓ Sherlock Holmes was a Buddhist: Many 
Sherlockians propose that Holmes, after 
having traveled for two years in Tibet, 
amusing himself by visiting Lhasa and 
spending some days with the head lama, 
went on to convert to Buddhism. At the 
center of Buddhism is the belief that the 
core of human existence is suffering 
caused by ignorance of and attachment to 
material reality. Suffering can be ended by 
overcoming ignorance and attachment 
through morality, wisdom, and concentration. 
At its core, Buddhism is a nontheistic 
religion, and gods aren’t creators of the 
universe or in control of human destiny. 
But some of Holmes’s explicit statements 
are incompatible with Buddhism’s basic 
tenets. As cited earlier in the chapter in his 
comments from “The Cardboard Box,” 
Holmes rules out our fates being determined 
by impersonal chance, and his monologue 
on the moss rose from “The Naval 
Treaty” is a direct argument for a theistic 
understanding of the universe.

214
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
 
Holmes’s stated beliefs are consistent with Christianity, and our best bet is 
that Holmes was raised in the Church of England (Anglican). Whether he 
remained within that denomination is unknown, but he clearly retained a 
Christian worldview in adulthood, right through to the conclusion of his very 
last recorded case.
“There’s an east wind coming, Watson,” said Sherlock Holmes in the last 
quiet talk he ever had with his old friend. “Such a wind as never blew on 
England yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson and a good many of us may 
wither before its blast. But it’s God’s own wind none the less. . . .”
The Importance of Trifles
Throughout the canon, Holmes demonstrates over and over that the little 
things, what he calls the “trifles,” provide the most valuable information in an 
investigation. Whether it’s making deductions about a new client, examining 
evidence, or researching a particular topic of forensic science, Holmes 
always makes note of the little things. For example:
 
✓ In “The Blue Carbuncle,” Holmes uses trifling details to draw a conclusion 
about the goose-seller. “When you see a man with whiskers of that cut 
and the ‘Pink ’un’ protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him 
by a bet.”
 
✓ In “The Copper Beeches,” he tells Violet Hunter, “I am glad of all details, 
whether they seem to you to be relevant or not.”
 
✓ In “A Case of Identity,” it’s clear Holmes has noticed the minute differences 
between typewriters. “I think of writing another little monograph some 
of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime. It is a subject 
to which I have devoted some little attention.”
 
✓ In “The Priory School,” he does the same with bike tires! “I am familiar 
with forty-two different impressions left by tires.”
 
✓ In “The Red-Headed League,” Holmes confesses to Watson, “I hardly 
looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see.”
 
✓ In A Study in Scarlet, Holmes explains to Watson that “they say that 
genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains. It’s a very bad definition, 
but it does apply to detective work. “
 
✓ In “The Yellow Face,” he gives another lesson in trifles: “Pipes are 
occasionally of extraordinary interest. Nothing has more individuality 
save, perhaps, watches and bootlaces.”
 
✓ And again in “The Red-Headed League,” nothing gets past the eagle-eyed 
Sherlock Holmes: “If you wish to preserve your incognito, I suggest that 
you cease to write your name upon the lining of your hat, or else that you 
turn the crown towards the person whom you are addressing.”

Chapter 12
The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes
In This Chapter
▶ Checking out some of the detectives inspired by Sherlock Holmes
▶ Regarding Raffles, an early antihero in the Holmes mold
▶ Noting a few detectives who transcend Sherlock’s influence
W
hen coming clean about his profession as “the world’s only consulting 
detective” in A Study in Scarlet, Sherlock Holmes says to Watson that 
“here in London we have lots of government detectives and lots of private 
ones.” And as usual, Holmes was right. When Holmes exploded onto the 
scene in 1891, Victorian and Edwardian England had dozens of incredibly 
talented, idiosyncratic investigators at work.
In this chapter I look at the many detectives whose creation was inspired 
by Sherlock Holmes, as well as a memorable villain who turned the Sherlock 
Holmes model on its head.
Brand New Detectives, Yet Strangely 
Familiar: Investigating the Rivals
You’ve seen it over and over. Just think of the glut of space opera films and 
TV shows (like the original Battlestar Galactica) that followed the premiere 
of the first Star Wars movie in 1977. Or better yet, the British Invasion that 
followed the meteoric rise of the Beatles in 1964. The same phenomenon was 
in play at the turn of the 20th century, following the incredible popularity 
of Sherlock Holmes. When Holmes hit it big in The Strand Magazine, new 
writers introduced dozens of new detectives to the public. And just as in the 
cases of Star Wars and the Beatles, a public hungry for the original gratefully 
embraced the tag-alongs, but rarely did these followers equal the original.

216
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
In the case of most of these Holmes wannabes, you can easily spot the 
influence of the Great Detective. The common, familiar elements include:
 
✓ The detective not being an official Scotland Yard detective
 
✓ A character similar to Watson
 
✓ The detective having at least one of Sherlock’s abilities (deductive 
reasoning, “scientific” investigation, and so on)
 
✓ An equally brilliant but unique method of investigation
 
✓ Idiosyncratic personal habits or hobbies
 
✓ Lodgings similar to 221b Baker Street
 
Many of the new detectives from this era are clearly created in the image of 
Sherlock Holmes. They either blatantly imitate the style and spirit of Arthur 
Conan Doyle’s creation and storytelling, or they self-consciously react against 
it. They may invert some element of the Holmes canon, or flip the form to 
make the detective the criminal. But even the most successful of these efforts 
(and some were very successful) come from the Sherlock Holmes mold. It 
wasn’t until the hard-boiled detective stories appeared in the 1920s that the 
genre of crime fiction invented a form not rooted in the classic model of the 
Holmes adventures. (For more on the hard-boiled detective style and its 
relationship to Holmes, see Chapter 10.)
So who are these newcomers, these other detectives, these rivals of Sherlock 
Holmes?
Martin Hewitt
None of Sherlock Holmes’s rivals is more clearly an imitation of Holmes than 
the detective Martin Hewitt (shown in Figure 12-1). Created by writer Arthur 
Morrison, Hewitt is, like Holmes, not a Scotland Yard detective; he’s a lawyer 
who, like Sherlock, has an amazing faculty for deduction. Ergo, he decides to 
put his extraordinary ability to use as a private detective.
Just as in the Holmes stories, Hewitt has his own version of 221b. His office is 
on the Strand, near Charing Cross station. The Strand is perhaps the second 
street most identified with Holmes after Baker Street. (The Holmes stories 
were published in The Strand Magazine, after all.)
And just in case the reader were to think that Hewitt was too much of a 
Holmes imitation, author Morrison made his detective a physical and emotional 
opposite. Holmes was tall; Hewitt was of average height. Holmes was lean; 
Hewitt was stout. Whereas Holmes had a prickly, uneasy relationship with 
the police, Hewitt and Scotland Yard got along just fine. And finally, whereas 
Holmes was moody and prone to episodes of depression, Morrison made 
sure that Hewitt was happy and cheerful.

217
 Chapter 12: The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes
Original? Hardly. But to be fair, despite being utterly derivative, the Martin 
Hewitt stories were very popular, and several of them aren’t just good but 
very good.
 
Before he turned to detective stories, Morrison earned a living first as a 
journalist at the Evening Globe and then as an author of novels set in the 
gritty East End of London, where he was born and raised. He began writing his 
Martin Hewitt mysteries shortly after readers learned that Sherlock Holmes 
had died at the Reichenbach Falls. With grief-stricken readers longing for more 
Holmes, the editors of The Strand Magazine jumped on the opportunity to 
publish Morrison’s new detective stories, and the adventures of Martin Hewitt 
soon appeared in the same pages as Holmes’s adventures.

Dr. Thorndyke
If Arthur Morrison glommed onto Holmes’s celebrated deductive ability in 
creating his own detective, Martin Hewitt, R. Austin Freeman did something 
similar with his detective, Dr. John Evelyn Thorndyke. Beginning with the 
novel The Red Thumb Mark in 1907, Freeman’s detective appeared in 21 
novels and 38 short stories — almost as many tales as Sherlock Holmes.

218
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
One of the pioneering aspects of Holmes’s approach was the use of science 
and forensic crime scene analysis when investigating a mystery. This was 
the angle Freeman seized upon, and ultimately amplified, with Thorndyke. 
Some commentators on the mystery genre refer to Thorndyke as the “first 
real scientific detective.” This is, of course, nonsense, as Thorndyke wouldn’t 
have existed without Holmes. But what they’re getting at is how Freeman 
elevated this single aspect of the Holmes character to a new level. Indeed, Dr. 
Thorndyke often reads like a textbook of forensic science.
Freeman describes Thorndyke, shown in Figure 12-2, as “a medical 
jurispractitioner,” meaning a doctor who is trained in both medicine and 
law and who uses this training to solve crimes. Freeman himself was a doctor 
who served in West Africa with the Colonial Office, and his training shows. 
It’s true that, compared to Holmes, Thorndyke’s forensic methods are 
explained in much greater technical detail. For instance, Freeman gives his 
detective a portable crime scene laboratory that he always carries with him 
and that holds everything he could need.
Despite the technical improvements in this single aspect, Thorndyke is 
clearly a derivative of Sherlock Holmes. Like Holmes, Thorndyke has his 
Watson — in this case his devoted assistant, Dr. Jervis (who also usually 
acts as narrator). He also has his own version of Lestrade, in this case named 
Superintendent Miller. And like Holmes, Thorndyke has an oft-emphasized 
residence — his being at 5A King’s Bench Walk, Inner Temple. Thorndyke’s 
relationship with the police is on better terms than Holmes’s, but, as with 
Holmes, Thorndyke usually proves the official police wrong.
The “medical jurispractitioner” is, like Holmes, tall, naturally athletic, and 
a committed bachelor. And like Holmes, Thorndyke has an encyclopedic 
knowledge in an astonishing array of topics. Finally, the Thorndyke stories 
follow a loose pattern, just as the Holmes stories do. A crime is brought to 
the attention of Thorndyke at 5A King’s Bench Walk, and he hears the details 
over cigars. He then seizes on some thread to follow in the tale, concocts a 
scientific investigation, and lays out his results.
 
One innovation that’s clearly original is Freeman’s creation of the “inverted” 
detective story. In this form, the first half of the story outlines the actual 
commission of the crime, including who the criminal is. The second half of the 
tale is the detailed investigation by Thorndyke.
All in all, though enjoyable and in one or two instances innovative, the 
Thorndyke stories are a bit bloodless and clinical. This isn’t to say that they 
aren’t entertaining, but they sure aren’t Sherlock Holmes.

Dixon Druce
After The Strand Magazine lost Sherlock Holmes at the Reichenbach Falls, 
the editors churned through a number of imitative replacements. One of the 
more popular Holmes stand-ins was detective Dixon Druce, distinguished not 
so much by his originality (the character didn’t have much of that) but by the 
fact that he was created by one of the few successful women mystery writers 
working at the time, L. T. Meade.
Of course, just a few decades later, women mystery writers became 
commonplace and eventually began to dominate the field. (For example, 
there’s Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot and Dorothy Sayers’s Lord Peter 
Wimsey, both admittedly inspired by Sherlock Holmes.) But to her credit, L. 
T. Meade was a prolific author of crime fiction all the way back in the 1890s. 
After appearing serially in The Strand Magazine, the adventures of Dixon 
Druce were published in a volume entitled The Sorceress of the Strand.

220
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Dixon Druce was the manager of Werner’s Agency, “the Solveney Inquiry 
Agency for all British Trade.” Like Holmes, he was unmarried and had his 
own personal Watson in the form of Eric Vandeleur, old friend and police 
surgeon for the Westminster district. However, unlike Watson, Vandeleur 
isn’t the author of the stories, as Dixon Druce narrates in the first person.
Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen
Perhaps no character in all of detective fiction has a longer name than 
Professor Augustus S. F. X. Van Dusen, PhD, LLD, FRS, MD, otherwise known 
as the “thinking machine.” Created by the writer Jacques Futrelle, Van Dusen 
has the distinction of being the only American in this roster of Sherlockian 
rivals. Futrelle was born in Georgia and began as a sportswriter for the 
Atlanta Journal. He worked his way through a number of newspapers in the 
ensuing years, and in 1905, while he was at the Boston American, he created 
Van Dusen. The first story was “The Problem of Cell 13.”
Don’t let Futrelle’s American citizenship fool you into believing his detective 
doesn’t belong in this discussion. Professor Van Dusen’s main claim to fame 
is his relentless use of logic to solve a mystery. And of course, he has his own 
Watson, in the person of his good friend Hutchinson Hatch.
 
Jacques Futrelle also holds a special place in history beyond his literary 
creation. While in Europe, Futrelle booked passage home on the maiden 
voyage of the RMS Titanic. Despite being a first-class passenger, Futrelle, 
after getting his wife into a lifeboat, stayed behind, perishing when the 
ill-fated ship sank.
Max Carrados
It was 1914 and author Ernest Bramah had decided to write his own detective 
stories. Holmes was still appearing in The Strand Magazine (in fact, The Valley 
of Fear was enjoying its run that year), and the big question for Bramah was 
how to distinguish his detective from the detective, Sherlock Holmes. As I 
mention previously, other authors chose to emphasize certain aspects of 
Holmes’s character, such as deduction or forensic science. Bramah chose to 
go the route of the peculiar quirk — in his case, he chose to make his detective 
blind!
Despite this seemingly debilitating condition (for a detective, at least), Max 
Carrados, Bramah’s creation, still betrays the influence of Holmes on his 
creator. As usual, Carrados has a sidekick/collaborator in the Watson role. In 
these stories, it’s Carlyle, an ex-lawyer who now runs their detective agency.

221
 Chapter 12: The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes
And Bramah’s detective has his own set of amazing abilities. His remaining 
senses are so developed that many times, others don’t even realize he’s 
blind. For instance, Carrados’s sense of touch is so refined that he can read 
print by touch and has mastered the typewriter. And like Holmes, he’s a 
smoker (for him, it’s fine cigars).
While Holmes uses his powers of observation and deduction, Carrados 
employs his powers of perception. Just as Holmes repeatedly admonishes 
Watson that anyone could, with practice, develop similar abilities, Carrados 
uses information gathered through his heightened senses.
The adventures of Max Carrados were collected into four volumes, spanning 
1914 to 1934. They show how far authors were beginning to push the Sherlock 
Holmes model in creating their own detectives.
Carnacki the ghost finder
You can find another example of stretching the form in English fantasy writer 
William Hope Hodgson’s detective, Thomas Carnacki. Carnacki, a detective 
of supernatural phenomenon, starred in six short stories that appeared in 
The Idler magazine and The New Magazine beginning in 1910. They were 
later collected as a book under the title Carnacki the Ghost-Finder, published 
in 1913.
Like the Holmes stories, the Carnacki stories include a Watson figure, and 
author Hodgson gave him the sound-alike name of Dodgson. Dodgson, like 
Watson, narrates the stories of his remarkable friend. And in keeping with the 
form, Carnacki has his own version of 221b, his being a flat in Cheyne Walk, 
Chelsea.
Though it may seem weird to equate a ghost-hunting detective with the 
ultra-rational Sherlock Holmes (who flatly stated, “No ghosts need apply!”), 
Carnacki is simply going a few steps beyond where the canon occasionally 
went. In several stories, it appears that Holmes and Watson have stumbled 
into a supernatural situation. “The Devil’s Foot,” “The Sussex Vampire,” 
and The Hound of the Baskervilles are fraught with what seems to be 
paranormal evil. For some readers, that the solutions to these stories always 
end up being explained by earthly causes may have been a disappointment. 
Hodgson’s ghost-detecting Carnacki takes the whole concept one step 
further.

222
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
The old man in the corner
In “The Greek Interpreter,” Holmes reveals to Watson that he has a brother 
named Mycroft Holmes. In broaching the subject of his brother, Sherlock 
explains that Mycroft’s gifts of observation and deduction are even greater 
than his own. When Watson asks why he isn’t an even greater detective than 
Sherlock, Holmes explains that Mycroft has no ambition and no energy — 
that for Mycroft it’s just a mental exercise. His brother is just too lazy to run 
around looking for clues or to track down suspects. He sums up Mycroft’s 
ambition by saying, “If the art of the detective began and ended in reasoning 
from an armchair, my brother would be the greatest criminal agent that ever 
lived.” And thus was born the concept of the “armchair detective.”
Baroness Emmuska Orczy, the British author and playwright better 
known for her immortal character, the Scarlet Pimpernel, created her own 
version of the armchair detective known as “the old man in the corner” 
(see Figure 12-3).
Sitting endlessly in the corner of a London tea shop, the old man in the 
corner pushes the Mycroft Holmes model to its limit. By relying on the 
gruesome and sensationalized crime accounts in the newspapers, the old 
man uses Holmes-like deduction to deduce the solutions to a variety of 
crimes, ranging from blackmail to murder.
Though the old man is more Mycroft than Sherlock, the stories have a (sort 
of) Watson character in the person of Miss Polly Burton. The first six stories 
(published in 1901 in the Royal Magazine) were narrated in the third person. 
Polly is a female journalist who just happens to frequent the old man’s tea 
shop. She and the old man usually discuss a crime, and in the course of their 
conversation, the old man solves the mystery. But in the next seven stories, 
published a year later, Polly is the narrator of the stories, stepping into a 
more Watson-like role. Additionally, the tea shop serves as a pseudo-221b, 
offering a familiar and regular venue in which the characters live and act.
Though all this is pretty derivative, Orczy’s one true innovation is that no vil-
lain is ever found guilty or brought to justice, an occurrence that only 
happens occasionally in the Holmes adventures.
The experiences of Loveday 
Brooke, lady detective
A host of imitators and rivals swept into the void that Holmes’s supposed 
death in 1893 left behind. The Great Detective, even in death, cast a long 
shadow, and his successors were, for decades, merely offering up variations 
on Sherlock’s theme. One of the earliest rivals to appear was also, at least on 
the surface, one of the most different. But first impressions can be deceiving.

223
 Chapter 12: The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes
 
Figure 12-3: 
The old man 
in the 
corner.
 
Loveday Brooke, lady detective, was the creation of British author Catherine 
Louisa Pirkis. Pirkis had authored both short stories and novels prior to 
1894, but it’s Loveday Brooke that she’s remembered for to this day.
The seven stories featuring this early female detective began in February 
1893, ten months before the death of Sherlock Holmes. They were published 
in The Ludgate Monthly magazine. The following year, they were collected into 
book form as The Experiences of Loveday Brooke, Lady Detective.
Other female detectives were around at this time, but most of them relied on 
good looks and “feminine intuition,” and most are entirely forgotten. Loveday 
Brooke was different. When investigating a crime, Loveday relies on logic and 
observation, just like her famous male colleague, Sherlock Holmes.
While maintaining a youthful appearance, Loveday Brooke is past 30, unmarried, 
and considered by Victorian standards to be a spinster. But this maturity and 
life experience give her tools to be a good detective: “For five or six years 
she had drudged away patiently in the lower walks of her profession; then 
chance, or to speak more precisely, an intricate criminal case, had introduced 
her to the notice of the experienced head of the flourishing detective agency 
in Lynch court. He quickly found out the stuff she was made of, and threw her 
in the way of better class work.”

224
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Loveday is described as rather plain in appearance. “She was not tall, she 
was not short; she was not dark, she was not fair; she was neither handsome 
nor ugly. Her features were altogether non-descript,” giving her a sort of 
invisibility in society that she uses as a detective. Like Holmes, she often 
used disguises, passing herself off as a nurse, a governess, or some other 
anonymous role, allowing her to gain the confidence of household servants 
and to gather vital clues. She’s described by her employer, Mr. Ebenezer 
Dyer, as “the most sensible and practical woman I ever met.” He goes on to 
say that “she has a clear, shrewd brain, unhampered by any hard-and-fast 
theories.” Finally, and in his opinion most importantly, “she has so much 
common sense that it amounts to genius — positively to genius.”
And like Holmes, she makes deductions based on careful observation of clues 
and crime scenes. Her Sherlockian influence is seen in her examination of 
furniture, impressions in the grass, and ashes in the fireplace, as well as her 
frequent disagreements with the official police’s evidence interpretation.
 
Loveday Brooke was indeed a female variation of the Sherlockian detective 
model, but she was more than that. Brooke paved the way for other women 
detectives over the years, including the next one on our list, Lady Molly of 
Scotland Yard.
Lady Molly of Scotland Yard
The old man in the corner, which I describe earlier, wasn’t the only detective 
created by the Baroness Orczy. In addition to her armchair detective, the 
baroness also created Molly Robertson-Kirk, better known as Lady Molly of 
Scotland Yard.
Orczy’s heroine first appeared in 1910 in the book Lady Molly of Scotland 
Yard and was contemporaneous with the ongoing adventures of Sherlock 
Holmes. And like her predecessor, Loveday Brooke, Lady Molly relied on 
her intelligence and deductive ability. However, she is perhaps the least 
successful of the Holmes rivals. Like most of her fictional feminine 
contemporaries, she usually solved the case because she was able recognize 
evidence of a domestic nature that was alien to the men of that era. Despite 
acting independently and successfully as a detective, at the end of the book, 
when her case is complete, she leaves Scotland Yard for marriage.

225
 Chapter 12: The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes
One of the First Antiheroes: A. J. Raffles
J. Raffles, the “amateur cracksman,” was the creation of Ernest William 
(“Willie”) Hornung (1866–1921). Hornung is perhaps best known to the 
followers of Sherlock Holmes as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s brother-in-law, 
having married Doyle’s sister. Before becoming a professional author, 
Hornung was a journalist with a worldly personality and dapper manner. 
Hornung’s relationship with his brother-in-law was a turbulent one. 
Nevertheless, Hornung acknowledges Doyle’s detective as the inspiration 
for his own literary creation in the dedication in the first Raffles book, The 
Amateur Cracksman. The dedication reads, “To A.C.D. This Form of Flattery.”
 
The three collections of Raffles short stories are The Amateur Cracksman, The 
Black Mask (sometimes known simply as Raffles), and A Thief in the Night. 
Later, Hornung added a final Raffles novel, Mr. Justice Raffles. As a testament 
to the character’s enduring popularity, just like the Holmes tales, the Raffles 
stories have remained in print since their original publication.
 
The adventures of A. J. Raffles, the amateur cracksman, are an important set 
of crime and mystery stories not only for their fine writing and high adventure 
but also for their undeniable link to Sherlock Holmes, amateur detective. By 
taking the Sherlockian model and turning it on its head, Hornung created a 
dark mirror of the Great Detective, as well as his most memorable rival.
The amateur cracksman: Standing 
the Holmes stories on their head
Hornung’s stories turn the Sherlock Holmes detective stories on their head 
by taking the form and utterly inverting it. Instead of a gifted detective, the 
protagonist is a master thief. Just as Doyle took pains to distinguish Holmes 
from his fellow detectives (both official and private) by referring to him as a 
“consulting detective,” Raffles is called the “amateur cracksman” (see Figure 
12-4), setting him apart from lower-class professional criminals.
 
In Victorian and Edwardian society, it was better to be an amateur. If your 
pursuit, whatever it was, was an avocation rather than a vocation, it showed 
you were wealthy enough to do it by choice rather than necessity. Thus, 
Raffles is the upper crust of burglars.

226
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Just as Holmes marked a major shift in crime fiction, in his own inverted way, 
so did Raffles. Living an upper-class life, being a well-known cricket player 
(amateur, of course), and having a public school background gave a com-
pletely different perspective to the portrayal of crime in fiction. Crime was 
rampant in Victorian and Edwardian London, and it was this criminality that 
helped give rise to the popularity of the crime fiction genre. It felt good to 
read stories where the thieves and burglars and murderers got caught. But 
with Hornung’s character, suddenly readers found themselves rooting for a 
crook. Raffles is one of modern literature’s first antiheroes.
Raffles has been described by crime fiction historians Chris Steinbrunner 
and Otto Penzler as “the greatest of all fictional thieves,” and The Armchair 
Detective magazine described Raffles as “unquestionably the greatest rogue 
in detective fiction.”
 
Figure 12-4: 
A. J. Raffles, 
the amateur 
cracksman.
 
Just as the Holmes stories first appeared in The Strand Magazine prior to 
publication in book form, the adventures of Raffles were originally serialized 
in Cassell’s Magazine, with the first set of stories running between June and 
November of 1898. The series ran under the title In the Chains of Crime. Given 
the moral climate of late-Victorian England, the magazine felt it needed to 
present the stories as examples of the evil of crime.

227
 Chapter 12: The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes
They weren’t the only ones conflicted about the tales. Doyle himself felt that 
Hornung’s stories set a bad example for young readers and that the gentleman 
burglar was an unsatisfactory role model. As Holmes and Watson often 
reflect the character of Doyle, Raffles, to some degree, reflects his creator as 
well. This isn’t to say that Hornung was a criminal, but just as Raffles is the 
mirror image of Holmes, Hornung was in many ways the opposite of Doyle in 
personality.
 
Some modern-day authors have written new adventures of Raffles in which 
they’ve reformed the character, making him commit criminal acts only when a 
greater good is at stake. However, as originally conceived by Hornung, Raffles 
is undoubtedly a criminal who’s in it purely for the money, or sometimes just 
for the thrill of it. Even modern writers feel guilty enjoying the adventures of 
the amateur cracksman, seduced by his charisma and personality. Raffles’s 
partner, Harry “Bunny” Manders, describes him as having “the subtle power 
of making himself irresistible at will. He was beyond comparison the most 
masterful man whom I have ever known.” It sounds like Watson describing 
Sherlock Holmes!
Raffles’s popularity
Many readers will be astonished to know that, at his height, Raffles was as 
popular as Sherlock Holmes. But if you read the stories you’ll understand 
why. Though they’re clearly imitative of the Sherlockian canon, the stories 
themselves are exceptionally well written.
The concept of the amateur cracksman or gentleman burglar became a 
well-known one in Victorian and Edwardian England. During this time, crime 
was rampant, and the growing middle-class felt that society was under siege 
by social disorder.
 
The popular magazines of the day were full of both true-life and fictional 
accounts of crime and punishment. For example, in 1894, The Strand Magazine 
ran a four-part series titled Crimes and Criminals. The second installment, 
“Burglars and Burgling,” gave a fully illustrated survey of burgling tools and 
techniques (see Figure 12-5), as well as a list of the most famous burglars 
in London history. Raffles would have been right at home. Later, The Strand 
contained an article titled “Does Raffles Exist? or The Myth of the Gentleman 
Burglar.” It was written by real-life detective M. Alphonse Bertillon, who 
pioneered the use of fingerprints in crime detection. It goes to show that, at 
least for the years Hornung was writing his stories, the idea of Raffles was as 
strong as Sherlock Holmes.

The detective versus the cracksman
A. J. Raffles and Bunny Manders are clearly modeled on Sherlock Holmes 
and Dr. Watson. Despite being on opposite sides of the law, the similarities 
between the Sherlockian canon and the Raffles stories (which number only 
27 tales), as well as the characters of Holmes and Raffles, are so striking that 
it’s instructive to compare their similarities and differences.
Individual traits
Raffles and Holmes have individual traits that are strikingly similar. One of 
the most obvious is Raffles’s use of tobacco. The aristocratic, cricket-playing 
amateur cracksman has a preference for Sullivan cigarettes. Like Holmes, 
Raffles is an enthusiastic user of tobacco. In the story “The Ides of March,” to 
calm a nearly hysterical Bunny, Raffles pushes him into a chair and says, “Sit 
down, my good fellow, and have a cigarette to sooth your nerves.” Raffles, 
like Holmes, often smoked while deep in thought, working out his latest “case.”
Also like Holmes, Raffles is a master of disguise, has a knack for deductive 
reasoning, frequents Turkish baths, has a fondness for using telegrams, and 
is alternately patronizing and rude or affectionate and kind to his friend.
Arch enemies and sidekicks
Just like Holmes, Raffles has his own enemy on the opposite side of the law 
(in his case a police detective) who pursues him relentlessly after he sets his 
mind to it.
And, as Holmes is assisted by Watson, Raffles is helped in his cases by his 
faithful biographer Bunny Manders. Both Manders and Watson are the 

229
 Chapter 12: The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes
intellectual inferiors to their partners; however, whatever they lack in 
brains, they make up for in loyalty and companionship. Manders, like 
Watson, narrates their adventures in the first person.
The residence
As any good Sherlock-inspired creation does, Raffles has a residence 
clearly identified and described, standing in as his version of 221b Baker 
Street. Raffles’s rooms are in the Albany, a building of fashionable bachelor 
apartments in London. Manders describes the rooms as having “the right 
amount of negligence and the right amount of taste,” having “a carved 
bookcase, with every shelf in a litter.” He adds that he found reproductions of 
famous paintings on the walls, leading him to conclude that “the man might 
have been a minor poet.” Although the address is more socially upscale, the 
rooms at the Albany are used precisely as they are in the Holmes stories — 
to begin and end the adventure in familiar surroundings, to see glimpses of 
the protagonists in a comfortable setting, and to give a subconscious base 
from which the characters operate. The Albany has the same kind of familiar, 
welcoming atmosphere as Baker Street.
 
The Albany is a real place, and over the years, it has had such famous residents 
as the poet Lord Byron and Prime Minister William Gladstone.
The big picture: Similar story arcs
 
Not only do Raffles and Bunny mirror Holmes and Watson, but the entire cycle 
of the Raffles stories is also an imitation of the Holmes saga. The following 
points apply to both sets of stories:
 
✓ Desperate financial circumstances bring the two partners together in the 
first story.
 
✓ It is the biographer’s (Watson/Bunny) first experience of this kind, while 
the subject of the stories (Holmes/Raffles) is obviously experienced at 
the sort of adventure that follows. As the stories progress, a natural 
partnership, as well as a friendship, develops.
 
✓ The first round of stories end with the hero’s nemesis pursuing them to 
the continent. The series supposedly ends when the hero plunges into a 
body of water and is presumed dead.
 
✓ After a period of mourning, the biographer (Watson/Bunny) discovers 
that the hero (Holmes/Raffles) is really alive and in hiding, after the hero 
appears in disguise before dramatically revealing himself to his friend.
 
✓ They resume their partnership, and the series continues, with the later 
stories being told well after the hero has discontinued his adventures.
 
✓ The last recorded adventure has the hero serving his country nobly 
during a time of war.

230
Part III: Holmes and His Adventures 
Holmes’s Enduring Influence
Of course, Arthur Conan Doyle’s creation continued to inspire imitations 
well after the Sherlock Holmes canon was closed. In fact, it’s been suggested 
that every fictional detective owes something to Holmes. Although they’re 
entertaining, none of the rivals I mention in this chapter ever really achieved 
true greatness, undoubtedly because of the fact that they really were, in the 
end, just imitations.
Others came along later in the 1920s that transcended the inspiration of 
Holmes to become legends of the genre in their own right. In the following 
sections I discuss some of these detectives.
Lord Peter Wimsey
His full name is Lord Peter Death Bredon Wimsey. He’s the hero of Dorothy 
L. Sayers’s series of novels and short stories in which an upper-class amateur 
takes up detection as a hobby. Wimsey is, in the first few novels, a sort 
of high-society clown (at least on the surface), but over the course of the 
novels, both the character and the plots evolve into something far more 
mature and compelling.
Of course, Wimsey has his Watson. Early on it’s his manservant, Bunter. 
Later, after he falls in love with detective writer Harriet Vane, Harriet begins 
to take on the role. Ultimately, Harriet herself begins to operate independently 
as a crime investigator.
 
Dorothy Sayers is on record as having been inspired by Sherlock Holmes. In 
fact, she’s famous as a Sherlockian, having deduced that John H. Watson’s 
middle name is “Hamish” (Scottish for James).
Father Brown
G. K. Chesterton, the English novelist, journalist, and Catholic apologist, 
is also the creator of the fictional detective Father Brown. Chesterton, like 
Sayers, was a Sherlockian and admirer of the detective story. Among his 
countless essays and articles, Chesterton wrote several on Sherlock Holmes.

231
 Chapter 12: The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes
Father Brown is a short, rather featureless Catholic priest whose dumpy 
clothes and umbrella mask an amazing ability to look into the human heart. 
And though Holmes couldn’t, on the surface, be further from a priest, the two 
detectives have similarities (refer to Chapter 11 for a discussion of Holmes’s 
religious views). Like Holmes, Father Brown has his own master criminal 
to deal with and has his own unique methods of solving crime. But while 
Holmes’s method is based on observation and deduction, Father Brown’s is 
clearly intuitive.
Hercule Poirot
Poirot is the first of the great mystery writer Agatha Christie’s legendary 
detectives (the second is Miss Marple). Poirot starred in an astounding 33 
novels and 51 short stories that Christie wrote between 1920 and 1975. Poirot 
remains enormously popular to this day — so much so that, like the Holmes 
adventures, the Poirot stories have been adapted into plays, feature films, 
and TV shows many, many times.
Christie is on record admitting that Sherlock Holmes was an inspiration for 
Hercule Poirot, saying in her autobiography that, in the early days, when 
she invented the little Belgian detective, “I was still writing in the Sherlock 
Holmes tradition — eccentric detective, stooge assistant, with a Lestrade-type 
Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Japp.” However, Poirot, like Wimsey and 
Father Brown, outgrew the Holmes tradition and went on to become his own 
detective.

Part IV
Beyond Baker 
Street

In this part . . .
F
rom the beginning, Sherlock Holmes has cast a large 
shadow, and his influence has been felt far beyond 
the original stories, and even beyond the printed page. In 
this part, you see how Holmes has inspired thousands of 
imitators, both in parody and pastiche. I look at the 
influence of Holmes on other mystery writers, who created 
entirely new detectives that resemble Sherlock. I also 
examine Sherlock Holmes on the stage and screen and 
look at the character’s unprecedented fan following.

Chapter 13
The Sincerest Form of Flattery
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the difference between pastiche and parody
▶ Looking at styles and examples of Sherlockian pastiche
▶ Rounding up the great Sherlockian parodies
T
he charisma and popularity of Sherlock Holmes spawned a host of 
detectives stamped out of the Holmes model. These “rival” detectives 
began showing up even before Holmes “died” at the Reichenbach Falls, but 
after Holmes was believed dead, his imitators really took off. Most of these 
new detectives were enjoyable but forgettable, but others went on to become 
classics of the genre in their own right. (For more on the rivals of Sherlock 
Holmes, see Chapter 12.)
But running parallel to the creation of new, look-alike detectives was an even 
stranger, more surprising occurrence — writers began penning their own 
Sherlock Holmes adventures. This urge for authors to write their own Holmes 
stories was, like so many other aspects of Sherlock Holmes, an amazing and 
nearly unprecedented phenomenon, and it’s more prominent now than ever 
before.
In this chapter, I look at the two types of these new Holmes stories — 
pastiche and parody — and discuss the characteristics unique to each form. 
Get ready — it’s a strange subject!
Two Types of New Tales: 
Pastiche and Parody
When an author takes pen in hand to write a Sherlock Holmes adventure of 
his own, this new, unofficial, extra-canonical Sherlockian adventure falls into 
one of two broad categories: parody and pastiche.

236
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
 
✓ In literature, a parody is a work in which the characteristics of another 
author’s writing are imitated, mocked, or made to seem ridiculous, 
especially by applying them to absurd or inappropriate subjects.
 
✓ A pastiche, on the other hand, is a work — whether literary, artistic, 
musical, or architectural — that imitates the styles of previous work.
Within five years of Holmes appearing in The Strand Magazine, both 
Sherlockian parody and pastiche began showing up in newspapers, magazines, 
and even books. With the death of Arthur Conan Doyle in 1930 and the 
subsequent realization that there would be no further official adventures of 
Sherlock Holmes, authors began churning out their own versions of Holmes 
in earnest. Ever since then, new adventures of Holmes have been appearing — 
beginning as a trickle in the 1890s and growing to a tidal wave by the 21st 
century.
 
The Sherlock Holmes pastiche and parody works pioneered the modern 
phenomenon known as “fan fiction,” which, in the 21st century, is a thriving 
genre most commonly associated with (but certainly not limited to) science 
fiction and fantasy. Even within this broader genre, Holmes is one of the most 
popular characters.
Holmes’s identifying characteristics proved to be irresistible to both pastiche 
writers and parodists. In literature, the sheer quantity of this body of writing 
is utterly unique. Philip K. Jones, a researcher and scholar of the phenomenon of 
Sherlockian pastiche, has identified approximately 8,000 examples of Holmes 
parody and pastiche, with more appearing, quite literally, every month.
Whether parody or pastiche, this urge to extend the canon beyond the 
original 60 stories stems from a simple desire for more Sherlock Holmes 
stories. Thousands of people — from rank amateurs to established, bestselling 
authors — have written their own versions of the Great Detective. Sometimes 
these new tales are wonderful. More often than not, they’re terrible! But good 
or bad, the genre itself remains popular.
Sherlockian Pastiche: The Continuing 
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
When a pastiche author decides to write his own Holmes tale, he can follow 
two possible paths: relate one of the many untold tales that Watson refers to 
within the canon but chose not to write himself, or construct a wholly new 
tale.

237
 Chapter 13: The Sincerest Form of Flattery
 
✓ The untold tales: Doyle built into the canon itself a motivation and 
opportunity for Sherlockian pastiche. Watson says that “somewhere in 
the vaults of the bank of Cox and Co., at Charing Cross, there is a 
travel-worn and battered tin dispatch-box with my name, John H. 
Watson, M. D., Late Indian Army, painted upon the lid. It is crammed 
with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the 
curious problems which Mr. Sherlock Holmes had at various times to 
examine.”
 
 This treasure trove of a dispatch box has become legendary. Over the 
course of the stories, Watson refers to over 100 cases of Holmes that, 
for one reason or another, Watson chose not to write about. Though 
Watson may have passed on these adventures, the bottomless dispatch 
box has offered opportunities for writers wanting to take a crack at 
these untold tales.
 
✓ The brand new stories: The second option is to simply write a 
completely original Sherlock Holmes adventure. Since 1893, hundreds, 
if not thousands, of writers have done exactly that. Over time, the 
style of these new tales has evolved beyond strict pastiche to explore 
plots, locations, eras, and even other genres of fiction that Doyle never 
dreamed of.
The many forms of pastiche
Five basic categories, more or less, fall under the umbrella of Sherlockian 
pastiche. The following sections have them covered.
The classic Watsonian style
Within this first category are works that adhere to a strict interpretation, 
meaning a Holmes story written in the style of the originals. The stories are 
set in the proper Victorian (or Edwardian) time period, and Watson is the 
narrator. Although some pastiche efforts are novels, generally, the most 
successful examples of the classic pastiche are short stories, which happens 
to be the case with the original canon as well.
 
You can find countless examples of new Holmes stories written in this fashion, 
but perhaps the best examples are by Denis O. Smith. His short story “The 
Purple Hand” is nearly perfect. Look for it in The Further Adventures of Sherlock 
Holmes, edited by Richard Lancelyn Green (Penguin).

238
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
Holmes meets history
Beginning in the mid-1970s, following the tremendous success of the 
bestselling pastiche novel The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, a new trend in 
Sherlockian pastiche appeared. The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, by Nicholas 
Meyer, told an alternative version of “The Final Problem” which has the 
fictional Sherlock Holmes joining forces with the very real, historical Sigmund 
Freud (you find out more about this landmark work in the later section 
“The Sherlockian pastiche hall of fame”). Meyer’s plot device was a unique 
innovation, and in a short time other authors were pairing Holmes with 
other contemporary historical characters. It wasn’t long before what was an 
innovation had turned into a gimmick, as a parade of historical characters 
encountered the Great Detective.
In this now large body of stories, Holmes has encountered Teddy Roosevelt, 
Harry Houdini, Jacques Futrelle, Rasputin, Lillie Langtry, Benjamin Disraeli, 
Albert Einstein, Jack the Ripper, Bram Stoker, Gilbert and Sullivan, and 
virtually every member of royalty and every major British politician. And 
that’s merely the tip of the iceberg.
Ten rules for writing Sherlockian pastiche
In 1976, historian and scholar Jacques Barzun 
offered ten rules for writing serious Sherlock 
Holmes pastiches. For all you budding authors 
out there, ignore them at your peril!
 1. No shilly-shallying between pastiche and 
parody.
 2. Whether in pastiche or parody, no fancy 
writing; plain language is safest.
 3. No recourse merely to the well-known 
tricks of speech and action in the original.
 4. No incessant effort to squeeze comedy out 
of every remark or incident.
 5. No gross or grotesque proper names.
 6. No expressions of recent coinage, high or 
low (that is, no anachronisms).
 7. No technical terms thrown about 
needlessly.
 8. No pastiche without the Holmes touch (for 
example, remarks such as, “My charges 
are upon a fixed scale; I do not alter them 
save when I remit them altogether.”).
 9. No pastiche that degrades Holmes through 
any piece of feeble or patently false 
reasoning.
 10. No pastiche without at least one 
Sherlockismus, the equivalent of one truffle 
in each pâté de foie gras. (Sherlockismus: 
Any of several kinds of memorable quotes 
or phrases attributed to, or characteristic 
of, Sherlock Holmes.)

 Chapter 13: The Sincerest Form of Flattery
Sherlock Holmes versus the Ripper
In the alternative universe of Sherlockian 
pastiche, Sherlock Holmes, the world’s great-
est detective, and Jack the Ripper, the most 
famous serial killer of them all, have squared 
off against each other many times. Perhaps it’s 
only natural — if Holmes really had been work-
ing in Victorian London during that autumn 
of terror, surely he would have brought the 
Whitechapel killer to justice. That’s certainly 
the belief of pastiche authors over the last 50 
years, for Holmes and the Ripper have been 
paired many, many times. Some of the more 
notable examples include
 ✓ Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street, by 
William S. Baring-Gould (1962). This biog-
raphy of Holmes offers one of the earliest 
accounts of Sherlock’s involvement with 
the Ripper.
 ✓ A Study in Terror, by Ellery Queen (1966). 
This is actually the novelization of the film 
by the same name.
 ✓ The Return of Moriarty, by John Gardner 
(1974). Jack the Ripper features into the 
plot of this novel centered on Professor 
Moriarty.
 ✓ The Last Sherlock Holmes Story, by 
Michael Dibdin (1978). This disturbing book 
chronicles the investigation by Holmes and 
Watson into the Ripper crimes. You won’t 
believe the ending of this one!
 ✓ An East Wind Coming: Sherlock Holmes and 
Jack the Ripper, by Arthur Byron (1979). The 
advertising blurb says it all in this science-
fiction adventure: “An immortal Sherlock 
Holmes. A deathless Jack the Ripper! In a 
fantasy duel through the corridors of time.” 
Hmm. . . .
 ✓ The Mycroft Memoranda, by Ray Walsh 
(1984). This novel sets out to solve two of 
the most perplexing riddles of the Victorian 
era. First, who was Jack the Ripper? And 
second, why didn’t Sherlock Holmes hunt 
down the killer?
 ✓ The Whitechapel Horrors, by Edward B. 
Hanna (1993). This book blends Holmes and 
Watson into a very detailed, factually accu-
rate account of the Ripper murders.
 ✓ Bloodguilty, by Raymond Thor (1997). A 
modern-day writer is transported back to 
the London of Jack the Ripper in 1888. This 
book gives details of the Ripper crimes and 
posits that Holmes actually existed.
 ✓ Chapel Noir: A Novel of Suspense Featuring 
Sherlock Holmes, Irene Adler, and Jack the 
Ripper, by Carole Nelson Douglas (2002). 
When Irene Adler (the woman from “A 
Scandal in Bohemia”) investigates a brutal 
murder in Paris, she comes to believe it’s 
the work of London’s Ripper. She also finds 
that she’s in competition with Holmes. 
Carole Nelson Douglas followed this with 
a sequel in 2003, Castle Rouge: A Novel of 
Suspense Featuring Sherlock Holmes, Irene 
Adler, and Jack the Ripper. Altogether, 
Douglas’s Irene Adler series numbers eight 
volumes.
 ✓ Sherlock Holmes: The Unauthorized 
Biography, by Nick Rennison (2005). 
Another Holmes biography revealing 
Sherlock’s contact with Jack the Ripper.
 ✓ The Shadow of Reichenbach Falls, by 
John R. King (2008). In this story, Professor 
Moriarty’s wife is a victim of Jack the 
Ripper.
(continued)

Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
In addition to having Holmes encounter historic characters, writers also 
began concocting plots placing Holmes at major historical events. Holmes 
became sort of a literary version of Woody Allen’s film character, Zelig, 
showing up in an amazing number of historical situations. A fan of the 
Sherlockian pastiche discovers Holmes’s involvement in the notorious Lizzie 
Borden murder case in Fall River, Massachusetts; the investigation of the 
John F. Kennedy assassination (yeah, I know — the timeline is all wrong!); the 
sinking of the Titanic (where he and Watson supposedly went down with the 
ship); and the overthrow of the czar by the Communists, to name just a few 
of the dozens of examples.
 
Zelig is a character from the 1983 Woody Allen film of the same name. Leonard 
Zelig is known as “the human chameleon” because of his ability to blend into 
whatever social situation he finds himself in. In the film, Zelig shows up in a 
variety of situations, from a party at the home of F. Scott Fitzgerald to sitting 
behind Adolf Hitler at a rally in Nazi Germany. Wherever you looked, there 
was Leonard Zelig in the background.
Variations on this category also brought a number of books featuring Arthur 
Conan Doyle himself as a character, as well as adventures placing the Great 
Detective in improbable places such as Minnesota and Mexico!
Sherlock Holmes saves London/the British 
Empire/the world . . . take your pick!
A number of Sherlockian novels don’t concern themselves with cases as 
mundane as stolen jewels or murder. No, in these adventures, Holmes’s 
investigations have much larger consequences.
(continued)
 ✓ Dust and Shadow: An Account of the Ripper 
Killings, by Lyndsay Faye (2009). One of the 
best Holmes/Ripper pairings is an account 
of Sherlock’s attempt to hunt down the 
Ripper. Faye’s Sherlock Holmes uses a 
Whitechapel streetwalker as an assistant 
and relies on Watson after surviving a 
terrible attack by none other than Jack the 
Ripper himself!
Beyond this list, over 30 additional novels and 
short stories connect the canon to Jack the 
Ripper, as well as 6 Sherlockian parodies. 
Additionally, Sherlock Holmes has investigated 
the Whitechapel murders twice on the big 
screen, in A Study in Terror (1965) and Murder 
by Decree (1979). (For more about these films, 
see Chapter 14.)
The pairing of the legendary detective and 
the legendary serial killer seems irresistible 
to would-be Watsons, guaranteeing repeated 
rematches in the years ahead.

241
 Chapter 13: The Sincerest Form of Flattery
Perhaps no better example falls into this category than The Earthquake 
Machine by Austin Mitchelson and Nicholas Utechin, published in 1976. 
Holmes and Watson are directed by Mycroft to infiltrate a group of 
revolutionaries. The trail lands them in the court of the tsar of Russia, 
where they discover the existence of an atomic bomb! When the inventor 
(guess who) threatens to use it on London, Holmes races to evacuate the city 
and disarm the bomb. This story has so many features found in Sherlockian 
pastiche that it’s almost a category-buster! It has historical figures (Karl 
Marx, Winston Churchill), a science-fiction slant with the atom bomb, and, 
most important for this category, Holmes saving London, the British Empire, 
heck . . . maybe even the world!
The supernatural/sci-fi Sherlock
Though Holmes himself declared, “This agency stands flat-footed upon the 
ground, and there it must remain . . . no ghosts need apply,” this hasn’t 
stopped the many pastiche writers from giving Holmes cases supernatural or 
science-fiction overtones.
One of the most popular and compelling scenarios pits Sherlock Holmes 
against Count Dracula. The count and the detective have been brought 
together at least a dozen times in short stories and novels, and that doesn’t 
even include comic books. The most noteworthy examples include
 
✓ The Holmes-Dracula File, by Fred Saberhagen (1978). Who knew that the 
untold tale of the giant rat of Sumatra had anything to do with Dracula?
 
✓ Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula: The Adventure of the Sanguinary Count, by 
Loren D. Estleman (1978). Despite the lurid title, this is one of the best 
examples in this category, seamlessly blending the canon with Bram 
Stoker’s novel.
 
✓ The Dracula Caper, by Simon Hawke (1988). Here you get both science 
fiction and the supernatural! Arthur Conan Doyle joins forces with Bram 
Stoker and H. G. Wells, battling not only Dracula but also vampires from 
the future.
 
✓ Anno Dracula, by Kim Newman (1992). In this mesmerizing, supernatural, 
alternative history novel, Queen Victoria is married to Count Dracula. 
Vampires have become high society, and vampirism is fashionable. And 
Sherlock Holmes has been sent to a concentration camp.
 
✓ Séance for a Vampire, by Fred Saberhagen (1994). When Holmes vanishes 
after attending a séance, a desperate Dr. Watson appeals to Count 
Dracula for help in finding his friend.
 
✓ The Tangled Skein, by David Stuart Davies (1995). After a series of 
mysterious murders, the trail leads to a battle between Holmes and 
Dracula.

242
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
Another popular supernatural and science-fiction encounter occurs when 
Holmes is paired with the work of American horror, fantasy, and science 
fiction author H. P. Lovecraft. Lovecraft wrote in the early part of the 20th 
century, and his weird tales have inspired many writers of the macabre. 
Lovecraft has a longstanding cult following.
In Pulptime, published in 1984, novelist P. H. Cannon tells a story that brings 
Holmes into contact with Lovecraft as he investigates the case of a missing 
gangster. The novel is set in 1925 New York, and Harry Houdini makes an 
appearance as well.
But it’s Shadows Over Baker Street: New Tales of Terror (published in 2003) 
that showcases the full marriage of Holmes and Lovecraft. This anthology, 
edited by Michael Reaves and John Pelan, includes 14 short stories by 
modern horror writers who all blend the Lovecraft mythos with the 
Sherlockian canon.
Finally, no discussion of science fiction-tinged pastiche can leave out Sherlock 
Holmes’s War of the Worlds by Manly Wade Wellman and Wade Wellman, 
published in 1975. Written as a sequel to H. G. Wells’s The War of the Worlds, 
this story teams Holmes and Watson with another of Doyle’s great characters, 
Professor George Challenger, hero of The Lost World. Here, the two great 
intellects work together to defeat the Martian invasion.
Sherlockian by association
 
As the term pastiche has, at least in the Sherlockian universe, become more 
elastic, more and more variations have appeared. One of the most interesting 
includes works of fiction that don’t feature Sherlock Holmes himself but are, 
in plot or character, loaded with the spirit of Baker Street. Holmes looms large 
in the following stories, which feature everyone from Harry Houdini to Orson 
Welles to an autistic boy to turn-of-the-century cowboys:
 
✓ The War of the Worlds Mystery, by Philip Shreffler (Wessex Press, 1998). 
In this fine novel (as well as in its sequel, The Twentieth Century Limited 
Mystery), the fans of Sherlock Holmes solve a crime and get the same 
treatment as Holmes does — real-life, historic characters and events 
used as a launching pad for a mystery story. Members of the legendary 
Sherlock Holmes literary society, the Baker Street Irregulars, get caught 
up in a perplexing case of murder amid the famous cast of Orson 
Welles’s famous 1938 radio broadcast. (For more on the Baker Street 
Irregulars and other Holmes societies, see Chapter 15.)
 
✓ The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, by Mark Haddon 
(Doubleday, 2003). With its title taken from a quote by Holmes in the 
story “Silver Blaze,” this award-winning novel tells the story of a 
15-year-old boy with autism who is fascinated with Sherlock Holmes and 

243
 Chapter 13: The Sincerest Form of Flattery
The Hound of the Baskervilles. When someone kills a neighborhood dog, 
the boy sets out to solve the mystery of who did it, and along the way he 
discovers the secret to his dysfunctional family. It’s a fine book, and it 
shows just how the Sherlockian motif can be adapted beyond traditional 
boundaries.
 
✓ The Man from Beyond, by Gabriel Brownstein (W. W. Norton, 2005). 
Inspired by the true-life yet contentious friendship between Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini, this award-winning novel reimagines 
the consequences of an actual séance held by Doyle and his wife for the 
celebrated magician. In 1922, Doyle, the world’s most famous spiritualist, 
and his wife Jean, delivered a message from beyond to Houdini. The 
message was from his late mother. Houdini didn’t believe it was true, 
and the subsequent falling out between the author and the magician 
caused a fascinating series of events, both in real life and in this novel.
 
✓ Holmes on the Range, by Steve Hockensmith (Thorndike Press, 2006). 
Set in 1892, this novel introduces detective cowboys Gustav “Old Red” 
Amlingmeyer and his younger brother, Otto “Big Red” Amlingmeyer. 
Old Red is obsessed with Sherlock Holmes, having discovered his hero 
through copies of The Strand Magazine. The two brothers act as cowboy 
versions of Holmes and Watson when they take up “deducifyin.” Holmes 
on the Range was nominated for an Edgar Award and is the first in a 
series of novels featuring the Sherlock-loving Amlingmeyer brothers.
The Sherlockian pastiche hall of fame
Literally thousands upon thousands of new adventures of Sherlock Holmes 
have been written. And though many, if not most, are forgettable except as 
examples of the phenomenon in general, a number have stood the test of 
time by being both historically significant and well written. Though no list 
could be comprehensive (the sheer volume of Sherlockian pastiche makes it 
impossible to be comprehensive — entire books have been devoted to the 
subject), I discuss a number of the most important in the following sections.
The Unique Hamlet: A Hitherto Unchronicled 
Adventure of Mr. Sherlock Holmes
Vincent Starrett was a distinguished newspaperman, literary critic, poet, 
mystery writer, and book collector. Starrett is also one of the most important 
Sherlockians of all time, best-known for his 1933 book The Private Life of Sherlock 
Holmes. This volume helped jump-start the amazing, unprecedented 
phenomenon of Holmes societies and inspired the unending body of 
Sherlockian scholarship enjoyed by fans around the world. Starrett was a 
charter member of the famous Holmes society, the Baker Street Irregulars.

244
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
But The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes wasn’t Starrett’s first published 
Sherlockian effort. In 1920, Starrett wrote The Unique Hamlet: A Hitherto 
Unchronicled Adventure of Mr. Sherlock Holmes and had it privately printed. 
The plot deals with Holmes and Watson investigating a missing 1604 edition 
of Shakespeare’s play, which includes an inscription by Shakespeare himself. 
Many Sherlockians regard The Unique Hamlet as the finest pastiche ever 
written.
The Solar Pons books
When Wisconsin teenager August Derleth learned in 1928 that there would 
be no further Sherlock Holmes stories, he decided to do something about 
it. Derleth sat down and created Solar Pons, the “Sherlock Holmes of Praed 
Street.” Pons’s resemblance to Holmes is no accident — like Holmes, he 
smokes a pipe, wears an Inverness cape and deerstalker hat, and is a master 
of observation and deduction. He’s aided by his friend, Dr. Parker, who 
shares rooms with him at 7B Praed Street. They even have a long-suffering 
landlady named Mrs. Johnson. The Solar Pons adventures are set in the late 
1920s and number 70 stories published over a number of volumes, including 
one novel.
The spirit of Baker Street lives in Derleth’s affectionate stories, and indeed, 
so successful is he that Pons has gone on to gather his own body of devoted 
followers, the Praed Street Irregulars.
The Misadventures of Sherlock
By 1944, enough Sherlockian parodies and pastiches had been written that 
it was time to publish a best-of collection. This brainwave came to Ellery 
Queen, who put together what is still one of the best collections of this type 
of Sherlockian writing. Queen titled the book The Misadventures of Sherlock 
Holmes (Little, Brown and Company), and the contributors are a who’s who 
of famous names, including John Kendrick Bangs, Robert Barr, James M. 
Barrie, Anthony Berkeley, Anthony Boucher, Agatha Christie, August Derleth, 
Bret Harte, O. Henry, Maurice Leblanc, R. C. Lehmann, Stuart Palmer, Ellery 
Queen, Vincent Starrett, Mark Twain, Manly Wade Wellman, Carolyn Wells, 
and many others.
Unfortunately, Doyle’s estate didn’t see the book as the tribute to their late 
father that it was intended to be. Viewing it instead as a copyright infringe-
ment, the estate had the book suppressed, but not before some copies made 
it out. It isn’t impossible to find a copy, and reading The Misadventures of 
Sherlock Holmes shows how good Sherlockian parody and pastiche can be.
 
Ellery Queen is the pseudonym of Frederic Dannay and Manfred Bennington 
Lee, two American cousins who are giants in the genre of detective and crime 
fiction. Dannay and Lee also used the name for their own fictional detective.

 Chapter 13: The Sincerest Form of Flattery
The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes
For well over a decade after Doyle’s death, the Doyle estate (which was 
managed by Doyle’s sons Dennis and Adrian Conan Doyle) resisted the idea 
of any writer presuming to author Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1944 the sons 
successfully quashed the release of Ellery Queen’s The Misadventures of 
Sherlock Holmes, but ten years later the financial lure of Holmes and a market 
for officially sanctioned Holmes stories had them rethink their position. Thus 
came The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes (Random House), written by Adrian 
Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr (a famous author of detective fiction).
Doyle and Carr had already worked together when Adrian commissioned the 
mystery author to write the official biography of Sir Arthur. The result was 
a serviceable biography that, thanks to the heavy hand of Adrian, bordered 
on hagiography. Nonetheless, the book sold well, and so now it was time for 
them to officially cowrite a new set of Sherlockian pastiche.
The 12 short stories that comprise The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes were first 
serialized in Collier’s magazine and then collected and issued in book form in 
1954. Among Sherlockians, the reputation of the stories is only so-so, 
primarily because of animosity between the Doyle estate and the Baker Street 
Irregulars. But as pastiches go, The Exploits of Sherlock Holmes isn’t bad.
The Seven-Per-Cent Solution: Being a Reprint from 
the Reminiscences of John H. Watson, MD
 
No Sherlockian pastiche is more important, and more influential, than 
Nicholas Meyer’s 1974 novel, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (E. P. Dutton). You 
could also argue that no Sherlockian pastiche is better. This landmark title 
landed at the top of the New York Times Best Seller list and stayed there for 
nearly a year. Virtually every Sherlock Holmes pastiche published since 1974 
owes something to The Seven-Per-Cent Solution.
The Seven-Per-Cent Solution established many conventions of modern Holmes 
pastiche that are taken for granted today. However, they were fresh and new 
in 1974. For instance, the novel begins by explaining that what follows is a 
lost manuscript of Dr. John H. Watson. Watson is even credited as author. 
Virtually every pastiche since has come with an explanation of the story’s 
origin, usually mimicking the lost-manuscript-recently-found convention of 
The Seven-Per-Cent Solution.
It was the first major pastiche to wholeheartedly indulge in revisionism, 
stating that The Seven-Per-Cent Solution is the true story of what happened in 
Holmes’s deadly encounter with Professor Moriarty. Moriarty himself is cast 
in an entirely different light as well. According to Meyer, “The Final Problem” 
and “The Empty House” were fabrications by Watson to cover what really 
happened.

246
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
It was also the first Sherlockian pastiche to face head-on Holmes’s addiction to 
cocaine (a cold dash of reality that didn’t sit well with old-line Sherlockians, 
who were always in a bit of denial over Holmes’s bad habit). Nowadays, 
Sherlock’s drug abuse is a favorite idiosyncrasy that probably gets too much 
attention, thanks to the path blazed by The Seven-Per-Cent Solution.
For all the aforementioned elements, and for the mystery that’s woven into 
the story, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution really takes off with its final innovation. 
Prior to Meyer’s book, the idea of pairing Holmes with real-life characters 
hardly went further than Jack the Ripper. But here, Holmes is brought 
together with Dr. Sigmund Freud, the revolutionary psychoanalyst who, in 
the 1890s, was curing cocaine addiction with hypnosis. Meyer’s novel has 
Freud helping Holmes beat his addiction to the deadly drug, and along the 
way the book provides insight into what makes the eccentric, brilliant 
detective tick. Ever since The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, authors have sent 
an unending (and increasingly improbable) parade of eminent Victorians 
through Baker Street.
The Seven-Per-Cent Solution was made into a successful Hollywood film in 
1976 (for more on this film, see Chapter 14) and was followed by two sequels, 
The West End Horror and The Canary Trainer. But it was The Seven-Per-Cent 
Solution that not only set a new standard for Sherlockian pastiche but also in 
many ways resuscitated the popularity of Sherlock Holmes.
The Mary Russell novels
Mary Russell is the heroine in a mystery series by award-winning author 
Laurie R. King. Set in the first two decades of the 20th century, King’s series 
recounts the adventures of Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes.
The first novel in the series, The Beekeeper’s Apprentice, appeared in 1994. It 
tells of a teenage Mary Russell meeting Holmes on the Sussex Downs, where 
he now lives in retirement. As the middle-aged Sherlock and the teenage 
Mary get to know each other, he comes to believe that she has what it takes 
to make a good detective and starts to teach her his methods. Naturally, they 
eventually find themselves investigating a mystery together.
In the first few books, Holmes is a mentor to the girl, but later in the series, 
the elderly Holmes actually takes the young Mary Russell as his bride.
Despite the improbability of the romance, or perhaps because of it, King’s 
books have attracted a legion of fans who now write their own pastiches of 
the series.

247
 Chapter 13: The Sincerest Form of Flattery
Spoofing the Great Detective: 
The Parodies
Only a very small number of fictional detectives have invited parodying like 
Sherlock Holmes has. Hard-boiled detectives Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade 
come to mind, but this probably has more to do with their portrayals in 
film by Humphrey Bogart than the actual literary works themselves. Agatha 
Christie’s Hercule Poirot (“Haircurler Poirot,” “Hercules Popeau”) has also 
been spoofed, but Christie’s little Belgian detective is almost a parody in his 
own right. And of course, Ian Fleming’s James Bond 007 has been copied and 
satirized, again mostly due to his long film career (the Matt Helm series of 
books and movies, and, more recently, the Austin Powers films.) But you can 
count these examples on one hand. Not so with Sherlock Holmes.
So what is it about Holmes that inspires writers to keep authoring his 
continuing adventures, whether serious or comical? The answer is found in 
the specific traits of both the canon and Holmes’s character. Holmes’s
methods of observation and deduction, his personal habits (smoking, drug 
use, violin playing, and so on), his cold, aloof manner — all these are powerful 
lures for aspiring authors and the perfect opportunity for lampooning.
And surely the name “Sherlock Holmes” itself is an inspiration. The peculiar 
construction of that name has conjured up an astonishing — and seemingly 
endless — number of variations! Picklock Holes, Hemlock Jones, Ham Hock 
Bones . . . these names both invoke the spirit of the Great Detective and 
simultaneously poke fun at him.
 
While taking the conventions of the Holmes canon and the character of 
Holmes himself and making it all look ridiculous, the vast majority of these 
works are done out of admiration and love of the character. Only an aficio-
nado with an intimate and thorough knowledge of the stories is able to pull it 
off successfully.
Classic Sherlock short story parodies
Sherlock Holmes has been a favorite target of spoofers, and understandably so. 
In the very early days of Sherlock’s popularity, many of these authors were 
anonymous. And of course, some were better at it than others. Following is a 
small sample of some of the most memorable to appear over the years. You 
may be surprised at a few of the names who’ve taken on the Great Detective.

Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
The crazy pseudonyms of Sherlock Holmes
The name “Sherlock Holmes” offers a seem-
ingly endless array of ways to spoof it. Twisting 
the name is high sport for Sherlockian parody, 
and you could undoubtedly come up with a few 
variants yourself. Following is a (not even close 
to being complete) list of the various takes on 
the Sherlockian name that authors have come 
up with over the past century, along with the

The Adventure of the Eleven Cuff-Buttons
James Francis Thierry’s The Adventure of the Eleven Cuff-Buttons claims to 
hold the distinction of being the very first full-length Holmes parody ever 
published. The short novel highlights the exploits of Hemlock Holmes. 
What’s unusual about The Adventure of the Eleven Cuff-Buttons is the name 
of Hemlock’s sidekick. He’s named Dr. Watson. That’s right . . . no ridiculous 
variation, but just good old Dr. Watson. The Adventure of the Eleven Cuff-
Buttons was published in 1918.

Sherlock Holmes meets the Beatles
You’re likely to encounter Sherlock Holmes in the most unlikely places. In the 
massive Beatles Anthology volume, there is mentioned, almost in passing, a 
reference to a Holmes parody written by John Lennon. In 1964, Lennon 
published his first book, In His Own Write, a collection of James Joyce-like 
verse, Thurberesque cartoons, and silly short stories. The book was a 
bestseller, and so he followed it up with a similar volume called A Spaniard 
in the Works. It was for Spaniard that Lennon penned “The Singularge 
Experience of Miss Anne Duffield.” Lennon wrote it while on a boating holiday 
in Tahiti. “I read one or two Conan Doyle books when I was younger,” he 
writes, “but on the boat that we’d hired there was a set of them.” He tells 
how, despite the allure of “Tahiti and all those islands,” he still preferred 
to read the book on the boat. “There just happened to be a big volume of 
Sherlock Holmes, a sort of madman’s Sherlock Holmes where you get all the 
stories in one; and I realized that every story was the same. They’re all pretty 
similar; and that’s what I was doing, writing them all into one. So I wrote 
Shamrock Wolmbs after three weeks of Sherlock Holmes in Tahiti.”
Peter Pan parodies Sherlock Holmes
One of the best Holmes parodies of all time was written by James Barrie, 
friend and collaborator of Arthur Conan Doyle. It was 1893, still 16 years 
before Barrie conceived his classic Peter Pan. Nonetheless, Barrie was 
already a well-known author, but he aspired to be a playwright. He had 
written a few early plays, but they had met with only moderate success. 
Finally, Barrie pitched his play Jane Annie or The Good Conduct Prize to the 
famous Richard D’oyly Carte, of the D’oyly Carte Opera Company. This was 
the opera company that made its name by producing the operettas of Gilbert 
and Sullivan. D’oyly Carte agreed to produce the play, but shortly after Barrie 
began work, Carte suffered a nervous breakdown. Desperately needing to get 
the play written, Barrie turned to Doyle.
Doyle, who had just killed his famous detective, agreed to collaborate on 
Jane Annie. Unfortunately, the experiment was not a success. Barrie’s notes 
on the story were confusing, and the storyline was a point of contention 
between the two friends. When it finally reached the stage it was a disaster 
and a box-office bomb.

251
 Chapter 13: The Sincerest Form of Flattery
Fortunately, Barrie and Doyle remained friends throughout the ordeal, and 
as a token of his gratitude, Barrie presented Doyle with a copy of his book 
A Window in Thrums. Inside, on the flyleaf, Barrie had written a Sherlockian 
parody, “The Adventure of the Two Collaborators.” It wasn’t until 1924 that 
the story was finally published, appearing in Doyle’s autobiography Memories 
and Adventures. “The Adventure of the Two Collaborators” is a reflection 
of the ill-fated partnership of the creator of Sherlock Holmes and the future 
creator of Peter Pan. It’s considered to be one of the best examples of 
Sherlockian parody ever written. (You can read “The Adventure of the Two 
Collaborators” in the sidebar at the end of this chapter.)
Schlock Homes
Robert L. Fish was a 47-year-old civil engineer when he sat down to create 
his own take on the Great Detective, “Schlock Homes.” How good is his 
homage to Holmes? Good enough for his parodies to win three Edgar Allan 
Poe Awards from the Mystery Writers of America. Fish’s detective lives on 
Bagel Street and is joined by his friend and partner, Dr. Watney; Inspector 
Balustrade of Scotland Yard; and bad guys Professor Marty and Colonel 
Moron. Fish wrote his Bagel Street saga from 1959 to 1981, with the whole 
Schlock Homes canon numbering 32 stories.
The Adventures of Turlock Loams
John Ruyle’s The Adventures of Turlock Loams is a series of 24 pastiches 
featuring his Holmes-parodying detective. Turlock Loams books were 
published by Pequod Press, Ruyle’s own private press. All the books are 
Arthur Conan Doyle’s own Sherlockian spoof
Even Arthur Conan Doyle himself indulged 
in Sherlockian parody! Well aware of the 
fun authors (and readers) were having at the 
expense of his detective, Doyle finally got in 
on the act. When in 1923, as a tribute to Queen 
Mary, wife of King George V, a dollhouse dem-
onstrating British skill and craftsmanship was 
created, books were needed for its library. 
Well-known authors of the day were commis-
sioned to write original works to be put into 
miniature books on the room’s shelves. Doyle’s 
contribution was a parody of his own creation 
titled “How Watson Learned the Trick,” which 
was later published in a full-size book, The 
Book of the Queen’s Dolls’ House. In “How 
Watson Learned the Trick,” Watson tries to 
show Sherlock how he’s “learned the trick” of 
making incredible deductions from seemingly 
trifling evidence. Alas for poor old Watson — 
he fails miserably!

252
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
hand-set, printed letter press, and hand-bound in limited editions, with the 
maximum press run being 252 copies. These books are highly collectible by 
Sherlockians and book collectors. Turlock Loams stories all employ puns of 
actual canonical titles for their own titles. Examples include “The Adventure 
of the Five Buffalo Chips,” “The Adventure of the Frying Detective,” and “The 
Adventure of the Cardboard Lox.”
Other parodies
Sherlockian parody isn’t confined to short stories. Some of the very best 
examples are found in comic strips (see Figures 13-1 and 13-2), cartoons, TV 
comedy skits, and even feature films like The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes’ 
Smarter Brother and Without a Clue. (For more about Sherlockian film and 
TV, see Chapter 14.) Even advertising offers opportunity to spoof the iconic 
elements of the Sherlockian mythos. Sherlock Holmes has been used to sell 
everything from chewing gum to washing machines, all the while parodying 
the iconography, methods, and spirit of Holmes and the Sherlockian canon.

“The Adventure of the Two Collaborators,” 
by James M. Barrie
In bringing to a close the adventures of my 
friend Sherlock Holmes I am perforce reminded 
that he never, save on the occasion which, as 
you will now hear, brought his singular career 
to an end, consented to act in any mystery 
which was concerned with persons who made 
a livelihood by their pen.
“I am not particular about the people I mix 
among for business purposes,” he would say, 
“but at literary characters I draw the line.”
We were in our rooms in Baker Street one eve-
ning. I was (I remember) by the centre table 
writing out “The Adventure of the Man without 
a Cork Leg” (which had so puzzled the Royal 
Society and all the other scientific bodies of 
Europe), and Holmes was amusing himself with 
a little revolver practice. It was his custom of 
a summer evening to fire round my head, just 
shaving my face, until he had made a photo-
graph of me on the opposite wall, and it is a 
slight proof of his skill that many of these por-
traits in pistol shots are considered admirable 
likenesses.
I happened to look out of the window, and, per-
ceiving two gentlemen advancing rapidly along 
Baker Street, asked him who they were. He 
immediately lit his pipe, and, twisting himself on 
a chair into the figure 8, replied:
(continued)

254
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
(continued)
“They are two collaborators in comic opera, 
and their play has not been a triumph.”
I sprang from my chair to the ceiling in amaze-
ment, and he then explained:
“My dear Watson, they are obviously men who 
follow some low calling. That much even you 
should be able to read in their faces. Those little 
pieces of blue paper which they fling angrily 
from them are Durrant’s Press Notices. Of 
these they have obviously hundreds about their 
person (see how their pockets bulge). They 
would not dance on them if they were pleasant 
reading.”
I again sprang to the ceiling (which is much 
dented), and shouted: “Amazing! but they may 
be mere authors.”
“No,” said Holmes, “for mere authors only get 
one press notice a week. Only criminals, dra-
matists and actors get them by the hundred.”
“Then they may be actors.”
“No, actors would come in a carriage.”
“Can you tell me anything else about them?”
“A great deal. From the mud on the boots of the 
tall one I perceive that he comes from South 
Norwood. The other is as obviously a Scotch 
author.”
“How can you tell that?”
“He is carrying in his pocket a book called (I 
clearly see) Auld Licht Something. Would any 
one but the author be likely to carry about a 
book with such a title?”
I had to confess that this was improbable.
It was now evident that the two men (if such 
they can be called) were seeking our lodgings. 
I have said (often) that my friend Holmes seldom 
gave way to emotion of any kind, but he now 
turned livid with passion. Presently this gave 
place to a strange look of triumph.
“Watson,” he said, “that big fellow has for 
years taken the credit for my most remarkable 
doings, but at last I have him — at last!”
Up I went to the ceiling, and when I returned the 
strangers were in the room.
“I perceive, gentlemen,” said Mr. Sherlock 
Holmes, “that you are at present afflicted by an 
extraordinary novelty.”
The handsomer of our visitors asked in amaze-
ment how he knew this, but the big one only 
scowled.
“You forget that you wear a ring on your fourth 
finger,” replied Mr. Holmes calmly.
I was about to jump to the ceiling when the big 
brute interposed.
“That Tommy-rot is all very well for the public, 
Holmes,” said he, “but you can drop it before 
me. And, Watson, if you go up to the ceiling 
again I shall make you stay there.”
Here I observed a curious phenomenon. My 
friend Sherlock Holmes shrank. He became 
small before my eyes. I looked longingly at the 
ceiling, but dared not.
“Let us cut the first four pages,” said the big 
man, “and proceed to business. I want to know 
why — ”
“Allow me,” said Mr. Holmes, with some of his 
old courage. “You want to know why the public 
does not go to your opera.”
“Exactly,” said the other ironically, “as you per-
ceive by my shirt stud.” He added more gravely, 
“And as you can only find out in one way I must 
insist on your witnessing an entire performance 
of the piece.”
It was an anxious moment for me. I shuddered, 
for I knew that if Holmes went I should have to 
go with him. But my friend had a heart of gold.
“Never,” he cried fiercely, “I will do anything 
for you save that.”

255
 Chapter 13: The Sincerest Form of Flattery
“Your continued existence depends on it,” said 
the big man menacingly.
“I would rather melt into air,” replied Holmes, 
proudly taking another chair. “But I can tell you 
why the public don’t go to your piece without 
sitting the thing out myself.”
“Why?”
“Because,” replied Holmes calmly, “they prefer 
to stay away.”
A dead silence followed that extraordinary 
remark. For a moment the two intruders gazed 
with awe upon the man who had unravelled 
their mystery so wonderfully. Then drawing 
their knives —
Holmes grew less and less, until nothing was 
left save a ring of smoke which slowly circled 
to the ceiling.
The last words of great men are often note-
worthy. These were the last words of Sherlock 
Holmes: “Fool, fool! I have kept you in luxury for 
years. By my help you have ridden extensively 
in cabs, where no author was ever seen before. 
Henceforth you will ride in buses!”
The brute sunk into a chair aghast.
The other author did not turn a hair.

Chapter 14
Adapting Holmes for Stage 
and Screen
In This Chapter
▶ The dramatic Sherlock Holmes adaptations
▶ The Great Detective on the big screen
▶ The televised history of Sherlock Holmes
S
hortly after he first rose to prominence in the pages of The Strand 
Magazine, Sherlock Holmes became a favorite of dramatists. His public 
career in front of an audience closely tracks every form of drama and 
performance over the 20th century.
 
✓ The stage: Sherlock Holmes trod the boards with the best of them.
 
✓ Motion pictures: Within a decade after the invention of the motion 
picture camera, the first Holmes film was made.
 
✓ Radio: Sherlock was a staple of the wireless well into the 1950s, 
appearing hundreds of times.
 
✓ TV: Holmes was there at the beginning. A Sherlock Holmes story was the 
first drama broadcast in the U.S.
Indeed, since the closing of the canon, Sherlockian drama — be it stage or 
screen — has proved almost as popular as the written adventures.
 
Though it’s common for fictional characters to be adapted for the stage or 
screen, Arthur Conan Doyle’s detective, Sherlock Holmes, holds the unique 
position of being the world’s most adapted literary character in history.

258
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
Sherlock Holmes on the Stage
When Holmes was presumed dead at the Reichenbach Falls, the doors 
opened to adapting him for the stage. Stage adaptations were part of 
the same phenomenon as Sherlockian parody and new, look-alike rival 
detectives — they all were created to fill the void left by Holmes and to meet 
the public’s desire for more Holmes adventures.
In retrospect, it’s obvious — Sherlock Holmes is the perfect vehicle for 
adapting to the stage. With an endless supply of colorful characters (including 
Sherlock himself), the tight plots of the short stories, and the canon’s great 
dialogue, bringing Holmes to life on the stage is a natural. Just a few of the 
more notable examples of early Sherlockian plays include Under the Clock (1893), 
Sherlock Holmes (1893), and Sherlock Holmes: A Drama in Four Acts (1899).
 
Curiously, it was that last play, Sherlock Holmes: A Drama in Four Acts, that 
may have contributed to a few decades of Holmes being absent from the 
stage. The play, written by and starring William Gillette, was so popular that 
producers and the public were more interested in repeated revivals of it than 
new adaptations. That fact, combined with Sherlock’s success on the big 
screen, led to a few decades of little Sherlockian activity in the theater.
But eventually, Holmes did return, and since then, he has appeared in dozens 
of adaptations, the most important of which include Baker Street: The Musical 
(1965), The Crucifer of Blood (1978), Sherlock’s Last Case (1987), and Sherlock 
Holmes: The Final Adventure (2007).
Today, the Great Detective remains a popular source of inspiration and 
adaptation for playwrights.
Under the Clock (1893)
Written by Seymour Hicks, Under the Clock was billed as an “extravaganza” in 
one act. It starred Charles H. E. Brookfield, who gets credit as the first actor 
to portray Sherlock Holmes on the stage, and Hicks himself played Watson. 
Under the Clock premiered on November 25, 1893, at the Royal Court Theatre 
in London. Little else is known about the production.
Sherlock Holmes (1893)
The first known drama featuring Holmes was written by Charles Rogers, a 
rather pedestrian author of standard Victorian melodrama. His play, Sherlock 
Holmes, was exactly that. Rogers filled the plot with a series of exciting, if 

259
 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
improbable, incidents, and, as many have done since then, he took liberties 
with characters. In his story, Watson is married to a woman named Amy. But 
more shocking is Rogers’s innovation that Holmes was in love with Watson’s 
wife! The story features a Jack the Ripper-like killer who kidnaps Watson, an 
arrest of Holmes for Watson’s murder, Holmes’s escape from prison, and a 
whole slew of other outlandish plot twists. One reviewer wrote, “Nervous 
people should not go to see Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock Holmes: A Drama 
in Four Acts (1899)
Hands down, the most famous stage production of Sherlock Holmes was this 
play written and performed by William Gillette (see Figure 14-1). Sherlock 
Holmes debuted on Broadway at the Garrick Theater on November 6, 1899. It 
was a smashing success, lasting over seven months in its first run.
The creation of the play
When Doyle “killed” Holmes in “The Final Problem,” he knew dramatic 
productions starring his detective would be lucrative, so he decided to take 
his character to the stage. After completing the play, his literary agent, A. 
P. Watt, sent the script to producer Charles Frohman. Frohman, who found 
Doyle’s original draft to be a bit dry, felt that it would benefit from a professional 
playwright’s input. Thus, Frohman suggested giving the project to William 
Gillette. Doyle agreed, and Gillette, who was in San Francisco touring with his 
play, Secret Service, began adapting Doyle’s script. Ultimately, Gillette sent 
Doyle a telegram asking, “May I marry Holmes?” Doyle’s famous answer was, 
“You can marry him, or murder him, or anything you want.”
Not much is known about Doyle’s original version before Gillette worked 
on it. No known copy of the play survives. Gillette’s adaption is believed, 
however, to be extensive, combining “A Scandal in Bohemia” and “The Final 
Problem,” as well as several other tales. He also added entirely new elements 
and characters. Rather than making the heroine Irene Adler, for example, 
Gillette invented Alice Faulkner who, by play’s end, falls in love with Holmes.
 
While Gillette was staying in San Francisco’s Baldwin Hotel, the hotel caught 
fire and burned down, incinerating Gillette’s script, as well as Doyle’s original 
version. Undaunted, Gillette went back to work, rewriting the entire play in a 
few weeks.
Following its run on Broadway, the play toured across America, and then 
Gillette took it for a brief stay in Australia. When the play debuted in London, 
it was a triumph. The original 12-week scheduled was extended, and touring 
companies were sent out across England with the play.

260
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
 
It has been estimated that Gillette performed as Holmes approximately 1,300 
times over the next 30 years. The (for that time) unprecedented notoriety 
from the play, along with the promotional material that went with it, cemented 
Gillette as the image of Sherlock Holmes, and in many ways, his influence is 
felt to this day.

What Sherlock Holmes did for Gillette
Well before Sherlock Holmes, Gillette was famous both as an actor and a 
playwright in the U.S. In addition, he helped bring live drama into the modern 
era by using realistic sets, sound effects, and revolutionary lighting, particularly 
for scene changes. He also introduced a more realistic acting technique. In 
his productions, he abandoned the traditional, but hokey, bombastic style 
for a more natural, realistic one, having his characters walk, talk, and act like 
real-life people.
Despite his large body of work prior to Sherlock Holmes, because of the play’s 
popularity, Gillette became identified with the role in the mind of the public. 
He was the first actor to be known as the “Sherlock Holmes of his generation.” 
In addition to his theater work, Gillette starred as the Great Detective in a 
silent movie and twice on the radio.

261
 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
What Gillette gave Sherlock Holmes
The impact that Gillette’s play had on the popular perception of Sherlock 
Holmes — indeed, the popularity of Holmes — can’t be overstated. Many of 
the iconic elements that conjure the image of the Great Detective in the 
public’s consciousness were either popularized or invented by Gillette. 
These include
 
✓ The deerstalker cap: Despite Sidney Paget’s illustrations showing 
Holmes wearing the deerstalker, it was Gillette’s adoption of the 
distinctive headgear that forever identified it with Holmes.
 
✓ The calabash pipe: Doyle never described Holmes using this odd, 
curved pipe. Neither the briarwood or cherry pipe was described as 
curved, and clay pipes are straight-stemmed. It was Gillette who 
introduced the curved calabash, the style of which made it easier to 
say his lines and kept the pipe from being out in front of his face.
 
✓ Romance: The overwhelming popularity of Sherlock Holmes: A Drama 
in Four Acts opened the door to the public’s acceptance of Holmes 
falling in love. For strict Sherlockians, this is anathema to Doyle’s image 
of Holmes. However, Doyle gave the go-ahead, and dramatists and 
pastiche writers have been pairing Holmes up with women (usually 
Irene Adler) ever since.
 
✓ The American image of Sherlock Holmes: When the stories were 
originally published in the U.S., they were illustrated by an artist named 
Frederic Dorr Steele. Steele used Gillette as his model, thus amplifying 
the image of Gillette as Sherlock Holmes.
Arsène Lupin versus Sherlock 
Holmes (1910)
French playwrights Victor Darlay and Henri de Gorsse produced this early 
pairing of Arsène Lupin, France’s popular “gentleman burglar,” created 
by Maurice Leblanc, and Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes. In this freely adapted 
work, Holmes’s partner isn’t Watson but instead the Great Detective’s 
son, “Frederick.” Arsène Lupin versus Sherlock Holmes is half mystery, half 
comedy, with Holmes out to recover the sultan diamond, which has been 
stolen by Lupin. The outcome is, of course, a draw. Holmes does manage to 
arrest Lupin and recover the diamond. But once in custody, he escapes!

262
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
The Adventure of the Speckled 
Band (1910)
Based on his short story of the same name, The Adventure of the Speckled 
Band was written by Sir Arthur himself. Originally titled The Stonor Case, 
Doyle’s adaptation elaborates on and takes liberty with some elements in 
the original tale. (For instance, the spelling of both Helen Stoner’s last name 
and Dr. Roylott’s last name are slightly different.) One of the more interesting 
features of the play was the use of a live snake at the production’s climax! 
Unfortunately, the real snake looked fake, and so to make it look real, they 
ended up using a fake!
It took Doyle two weeks to write the play, and on June 4, 1910, The Speckled 
Band came to life at the Adelphi Theater in London. An anxious and excited 
audience held its breath as the house lights fell and Sherlock Holmes walked 
onto the stage. Holmes and Watson were recognizably themselves, but as the 
story unfolded, the Great Detective was nearly overshadowed, in both stage 
presence and popularity, by the memorable villain, Dr. Grimesby Rylott. Not 
only did the character scene-steal from Holmes, but at the opening night 
curtain call, Doyle himself was upstaged when the villain, sporting the 
speckled band itself around his neck, made his appearance!
The actors
So . . . who played Holmes? The detective was played by H. A. Saintsbury, 
a very popular Sherlock Holmes of the day, starring in productions of 
William Gillette’s Sherlock Holmes play before taking on The Speckled Band. 
Scholars believe he portrayed the Great Detective over 1,400 times. Based on 
Saintsbury’s popularity in the role, Doyle gave him the lead in The Speckled 
Band.
And who played Rylott? The evil stepfather was played by Lyn Harding. It was 
a stroke of genius to cast the popular Shakespearian actor as the evil doctor. 
At first, Doyle and Harding disagreed on the character’s interpretation. Sir 
Arthur envisioned Rylott as he had written him in the story. Harding, on the 
other hand, clearly was taking the role over the top, and there was real 
tension between the author and the actor. Finally, mutual theatrical friend J. 
M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan, arbitrated the dispute. Before rendering a 
verdict, Barrie attended a pre-opening performance of the play. Upon its 
conclusion he turned to Doyle and said, “Let Harding have it his own way.” 
Doyle took his advice. On opening night, as Harding received over a dozen 
curtain calls, Doyle sent him a congratulatory note.
 
The villain of the play version of The Speckled Band spells his name differently 
from his counterpart in the original story. In the written story, his last name 
is Roylott. However, in the play, Arthur Conan Doyle changed the spelling to 
Rylott. Why? Nobody knows, but the name change has been causing confusion 
ever since!

263
 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
The reviews
The play was a huge hit, and the fortunes of Doyle and his lease on the 
Adelphi Theater were saved. It’s arguable that, had Doyle gotten his way and 
reigned in Lyn Harding, the fortunes of The Speckled Band may well have 
been different. Deferring to the veteran actor’s instincts most certainly saved 
the day.
Harding’s portrayal of Dr. Rylott made such an impression on the public that 
he was tapped to reprise the role in the 1931 film version of the play, starring 
opposite Raymond Massey as Holmes. But his canonical villainy didn’t end 
there — he graduated from Grimesby Rylott to Professor Moriarty in two 
later films starring Arthur Wontner as Holmes. He deserves special 
recognition in the pantheon of Sherlockian dramatics for giving a performance 
that upstaged not only Sherlock Holmes but also Doyle himself.
Baker Street: The Musical (1965)
Baker Street: The Musical is based on the story “A Scandal in Bohemia.” It was 
written by Jerome Coopersmith, with music by Marian Grudeff and Raymond 
Jessel. The early previews had mixed reviews, compelling the producers to 
have new songs written by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock, who composed 
the music for Fiddler on the Roof.
The plot diverges from the original story when Irene Adler becomes an 
assistant of Sherlock Holmes. Naturally, as often happens in Sherlockian 
drama, a romance blossoms between them. Holmes was played by Fritz 
Weaver, and Inga Swenson was Irene Adler.
Rodney Stone
The Speckled Band wasn’t Arthur Conan 
Doyle’s first foray into the theatrical world. In 
1909, Doyle adapted his prizefighting novel, 
Rodney Stone, for the stage. Renaming it The 
House of Temperly: A Melodrama of the Ring, 
the author took out a six-month lease on the 
Adelphi Theater to house his boxing drama. 
At that time boxing was illegal in England. The 
play opened on February 11, 1910, and from the 
start, attendance was poor. Despite the fact 
that the play featured real boxing on stage — 
or perhaps because of it — the play did very 
poorly at the box office. Given that few women 
enjoy boxing, perhaps a stage play centered on 
prizefighting wasn’t such a good idea. To add to 
the play’s difficulties, King Edward the VII died 
during the run, and all theaters closed in mourn-
ing. Facing utter ruin, Sir Arthur did what many 
people in dire circumstances did — he turned 
to Sherlock Holmes for help, and the result was 
the stage adaptation of one of the greatest 
Holmes tales of them all.

264
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
The Crucifer of Blood (1978)
The Crucifer of Blood, by Paul Giovanni, is an adaptation of The Sign of the 
Four. Tinkering with the plot, Giovanni’s play includes a woman named Irene 
St. Claire, who hires Holmes to investigate the events that resulted from 
a cursed treasure chest her father and his three cohorts stole during the 
Indian Rebellion of 1857. The play opened on Broadway and starred Paxton 
Whitehead as Holmes and Glenn Close as Irene St. Claire. The Crucifer of 
Blood won four Tony Awards.
Sherlock’s Last Case (1987)
Debuting on Broadway to scathing reviews, Sherlock’s Last Case nonetheless 
remains a popular Sherlockian play. The original production starred 
Frank Langella, fresh off his turn in Dracula, as Holmes. Written by Charles 
Marowitz, Sherlock’s Last Case is described as a black comedy and centers 
on a death threat against Holmes by the son of Professor Moriarty. After 
many plot twists, Holmes finds himself imprisoned not by Moriarty’s son but 
instead by Dr. Watson! It seems that Watson has had it with being Holmes’s 
flunky. Mixing humor and mystery, the play concludes with a stunning 
ending.
Sherlock Holmes: The Final 
Adventure (2007)
Adapted by Steven Dietz and based on the play by William Gillette, Sherlock 
Holmes: The Final Adventure is a conflation of the stories “A Scandal in 
Bohemia” and “The Final Problem.” The king of Bohemia hires Holmes to 
recover a scandalous photograph from Irene Adler and keep it out of the 
hands of Professor Moriarty. Along the way, Holmes falls in love with Miss 
Adler before the play climaxes at the Reichenbach Falls. Sherlock Holmes: The 
Final Adventure won the 2007 Edgar Award for best mystery play.
Sherlock Holmes at the Movies
The history of Sherlock Holmes films is almost as long as the history of 
Sherlock Holmes. Within a decade of the invention of motion pictures, the 
very first Holmes film had been shot. Sherlock Holmes Baffled was produced 
in 1900 by the American Mutoscope & Biograph Company. It ran all of 30 
seconds and was made to show in arcades on Mutoscope machines.

265
 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
The cinematographer for Sherlock Holmes Baffled was a man named Arthur 
Marvin, but no record exists that reveals who played the first cinematic 
Sherlock. The plot, such as it is, has Holmes trying to catch a criminal, who 
keeps disappearing and reappearing, using the camera trick of stopping and 
starting the camera.
 
The Mutoscope was an early device made for viewing motion pictures. The 
individual frames were black-and-white photographs on cards. These cards 
were attached to a circular drum, which was turned by a crank. The viewer 
saw the movie through a lens enclosed by a hood. Only one viewer could 
watch at a time.
As crude as Sherlock Holmes Baffled was, it wasn’t long before motion picture 
technology matured, bringing us silent movies, then sound and color. And 
Sherlock Holmes was there every step of the way.
The silent era
Sherlock Holmes had a thriving motion picture career in the era of silent 
films. In fact, some of the most important installments of Sherlockian cinema 
came before the movies learned to talk.
Sherlock Holmes (1922)
A lot of great actors have donned the deerstalker over the last century. The 
first great film actor to do so was the legendary John Barrymore, who starred 
in the 1922 film Sherlock Holmes. Barrymore, who made his fame on the stage 
in Shakespeare’s Hamlet, was at the height of his fame when he was cast as 
the Great Detective. Roland Young was his Dr. Watson. Barrymore’s film was, 
by the standards of the day, ambitious, with some scenes being filmed on 
location in London.
The movie starts with Holmes and Watson as college students, where they 
first meet Moriarty, setting up the deadly clash with the professor years later. 
Even as silent films go, this one is slow and the plot is clumsy. Barrymore is 
a pretty good Sherlock, but he can’t overcome the deficiencies of the script. 
The film was thought to be lost for decades, but with the discovery of a 
print, it has been restored and is available to a new generation of Sherlockian 
cinema buffs.
The films of Eille Norwood (1921–1923)
The 1920s are considered the golden age of silent movies. In that decade, 
this new medium was maturing — filmmakers had discovered the potential 
of the motion picture, and technology was making it possible to tell ever 
more sophisticated stories. It was also during this decade that the first great 

266
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
Sherlock Holmes of film appeared. English actor Eille Norwood was 60 when 
he first stepped before the cameras as the Great Detective. Norwood starred 
in a staggering 47 Holmes films from 1921 to 1923 — a feat that was not to be 
equaled until Jeremy Brett played Holmes on TV over 60 years later.
His real name was Anthony Edward Brett, but he took his stage name by 
combining his girlfriend’s first name, Eileen, with the town of Norwood, in 
southern England. Of his understated (for silent movies) performance, he 
said, “My idea of Holmes is that he is absolutely quiet. Nothing ruffles him.” 
Norwood studied the canon, learned to play the violin, and shaved the 
temples of his hairline to more closely approximate the illustrations of Sidney 
Paget. His approach paid off. Even Arthur Conan Doyle was bowled over. “He 
has that rare quality which can be described as glamour,” said Sir Arthur, 
“which compels you to watch the actor eagerly when he is doing nothing. He 
has a brooding eye which excites expectation and he has a quite unrivalled 
power of disguise. His impersonation of Holmes amazes me.”
 
Norwood starred in three film series for the British company Stoll Picture 
Productions. Founded in 1918, Stoll was a major player of the silent era. It was 
a prolific company, too — between 1918 and 1921, when it began its Holmes 
films, Stoll had cranked out over 175 motion pictures!
Each Norwood series had 15 films. The first series appeared in 1921, The 
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. It was followed the next year by The Further 
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and then finally, in 1923, The Last Adventures 
of Sherlock Holmes. In addition, Norwood starred in Stoll’s version of The 
Hound of the Baskervilles and The Sign of the Four. Unfortunately, very few 
of Norwood’s films survive. But if you can find a copy, you won’t be 
disappointed. Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes is a revelation.
The 1930s: The talkies
The first feature-length movie with sound was 1927’s The Jazz Singer. It was 
a sensation, and by the 1930s, sound films had come of age. For fans of the 
Great Detective, that meant that Sherlock Holmes had found his voice.
The Speckled Band (1931)
With Doyle’s 1910 stage play of “The Speckled Band” being such a success 
(see the earlier section “The Adventure of the Speckled Band”), it was a 
no-brainer to eventually produce a film version. As in the original story and 
the play, the movie has all the familiar elements — the dying sister who, 
with her last breath, cries, “It was the Speckled Band!”; the weird animals on 
the estate; Helen Stoner being forced to sleep in the dead sister’s room; and 
especially, the evil stepfather, Dr. Grimesby Rylott. As in the play, the film 
features Lyn Harding as the sinister Dr. Rylott. Instead of H. A. Saintsbury, 
who played Holmes on the stage, the film version has Raymond Massey as 

267
 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
Holmes. This was the third film role for Massey (and his first talkie), who 
went on to a very successful career, first in Hollwood and later on TV. His 
Holmes is serviceable but undermined by the filmmaker’s decision to turn 
221b into an honest-to-goodness detective agency, with secretaries and other 
modern innovations.
A Study in Scarlet (1933)
Despite the title, this film has nothing in common with the first Sherlock 
Holmes novel. Holmes is played by Reginald Owen, a popular Hollywood 
character actor. Owen had played Dr. Watson in a previous production 
and wanted to begin his own series with himself as the Great Detective. 
Unfortunately for Owen, he was horribly miscast — rather tubby, let’s face 
it, and a bit boring. Owens’s Sherlockian feature film debut was also his swan 
song.
The films of Arthur Wontner (1931–1937)
The second great Sherlock Holmes of the screen, Arthur Wontner, stepped 
before the cameras in 1931, just after the dawn of the sound era in movies. 
Wontner was already in his mid-50s when he took on the role. Both he and 
Norwood contributed to the still popular impression of Sherlock being much 
older than he is in the canon.
Wontner’s Holmes films are
 
✓ The Sleeping Cardinal (1931): Retitled Sherlock Holmes’ Fatal Hour in 
the U.S., this is an original story, although it borrows elements from the 
stories “The Empty House” and “The Final Problem.” Holmes is hired 
by the sister of Ronald Adair to investigate why her brother is gambling 
so much. Along the way is a plot involving counterfeit money, foreign 
intrigue, and a suicide. And let’s not forget Professor Moriarty.
 
✓ The Missing Rembrandt (1932): When the evil Baron von Guntermann, 
known as “the worst man in London,” decorates his home with a 
recently stolen Rembrandt, Holmes takes up the case. He does so after 
an American detective hits a dead end. The baron is a blackmailer who 
has become wealthy and powerful through his evil trade. Based on 
the original story “The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton,” The 
Missing Rembrandt has plenty of plot twists. Unfortunately, the film is 
lost, with no known print in existence.
 
✓ The Sign of the Four (1932): Though this movie isn’t a completely faithful 
adaptation, the source material is still recognizable, despite being 
updated to the 1930s. Holmes and Watson set out to protect Mary 
Morstan, who is being menaced by an escaped murderer looking for a 
stolen treasure. The plot goes through familiar scenes, as well as some 
surprising new ones, including a strange carnival. When Miss Morstan is 
kidnapped, Holmes and Watson must work quickly to save her.

268
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
 
✓ The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes (1935): This adaptation of the novel The 
Valley of Fear opens with Holmes in retirement. His peace is interrupted 
when a country squire named John Douglas is murdered. Holmes’s 
investigation reveals the involvement of a murderous American secret 
society, and worse, the intervention of Professor Moriarty.
 
✓ Silver Blaze (1937): Though this film, retitled Murder at the Baskervilles 
in the U.S., is primarily an adaptation of the original story “Silver Blaze,” 
the screenwriters threw in the character of Henry Baskerville (and his 
daughter!) and mixed in, yet again, Professor Moriarty. While on 
vacation visiting Sir Henry, Holmes ends up investigating a double-
murder, a stolen racehorse, and Moriarty’s illegal betting scheme.
Wontner was a favorite of early Sherlockians. Vincent Starrett, author of 
The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, wrote, “No better Sherlock Holmes 
than Wontner is likely to be seen and heard in pictures, in our time. 
Sentimentalized, as is imperative, his detective is the veritable fathomer of 
Baker Street in person. The keen, worn, kindly face and quiet, prescient smile 
are out of the very pages of the book.”
 
Arthur Wontner had two Watsons over the years. Ian Fleming (no relation to 
the creator of James Bond) played Watson in all the films except The Sign of 
the Four. In that film, Watson was played by Ian Hunter.
Just who was Basil Rathbone?
Philip St. John Basil Rathbone was born in 
Johannesburg, South Africa. His parents were 
English, and when Basil was 3, the family 
returned to England. Rathbone enlisted in the 
army in 1916 during World War I, eventually 
retiring with the rank of captain.
His acting career started before the war. In 
1911, Rathbone made his first stage appearance 
in a production of The Taming of the Shrew. 
Throughout the ensuing years, before and after 
the war, Rathbone had steady, and steadily 
better, acting roles on the stage. In 1923, he was 
able to tour America with his theater company, 
and from then on he was frequently working in 
the U.S.
Leading up to Sherlock Holmes, Rathbone 
built a memorable film career. Among the 
titles he appeared in are The Bishop Murder 
Case, David Copperfield (in a harrowing role 
as the abusive stepfather Mr. Murdstone), 
Anna Karenina, Captain Blood, A Tale of Two 
Cities, The Adventures of Robin Hood (play-
ing the villainous Sheriff of Nottingham), The 
Mark of Zorro, Tower of London, and the 
underappreciated Son of Frankenstein. 
Rathbone excelled as a villain and was known 
for his skill as a swordsman.

The 1940s: Basil Rathbone and the first 
golden age of Sherlockian cinema
By the late 1930s and into the 1940s, moviemaking had grown up. The 
technical difficulties of first shooting moving pictures and then adding 
sound had been mastered. The end of the decade gave viewers arguably the 
greatest single year of film releases in history. Among the many landmark 
films released in 1939 were Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Mr. Smith 
Goes to Washington, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and 
The Hound of the Baskervilles. And as seen in that last title listed, it was the 
dawn of the first golden age of Sherlockian cinema. This was the era of Basil 
Rathbone, shown in Figure 14-2, as Sherlock Holmes.
 
Figure 14-2: 
Nigel Bruce 
as Watson 
and Basil 
Rathbone 
as Sherlock 
Holmes.
 
 
Despite an outstanding credit list that includes such films as Anna Karenina 
and The Adventures of Robin Hood, Rathbone is best remembered for his 
portrayal of the Great Detective. Between 1939 and 1946, he starred in 14 
Holmes films with his friend Nigel Bruce, who played Dr. Watson. With his 
angled face and crisp vocal delivery, Rathbone looked as if he had been torn 
from the pages of The Strand Magazine. To the moviegoing public, with his 
14 Holmes films (and hundreds of Holmes radio shows), Basil Rathbone and 
Sherlock Holmes were one.

270
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
Here’s a list of Rathbone’s Holmes films, the first two of which were 
produced by 20th Century Fox and the rest by Universal Studios:
 
✓ The Hound of the Baskervilles (1939): This is still arguably the best adaptation 
of this famous Sherlock Holmes story. The Hound was never intended to 
kick off a new film series, but when it became a surprise hit, the studio 
decided to make a sequel. It’s set in the proper Victorian time period.
 
✓ The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1939): Also set in the proper 
Victorian time period, Adventures combines plot elements from several 
Holmes stories. It claims to be based on William Gillette’s play, but 
it bears absolutely no resemblance. It is, however, a great Sherlock 
Holmes film.
 
✓ Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror (1942): This film marks the point 
where the series left 20th Century Fox for Universal Studios. The change 
was drastic. No more big-budget productions were planned. Instead, 
the series was moved to the modern-day 1940s, and starting with Voice 
of Terror, Holmes and Watson became propagandists for the war effort. 
Here Holmes is brought in to foil a Nazi radio broadcast used to spread 
war propaganda and demoralize Britain.
 
✓ Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon (1943): Holmes leads the race 
to secure the plans for a revolutionary new bomb sight. Who will get it 
first, the British or the Nazis?
 
✓ Sherlock Holmes in Washington (1943): Holmes’s investigation into the 
kidnapping of a British government courier brings him to Washington, DC.
 
✓ Sherlock Holmes Faces Death (1943): Watson volunteers to help out at a 
convalescent home during the war, but when people start to get
 murdered, he calls for help from his friend, Sherlock Holmes.
 
✓ The Spider Woman (1944): Britain is still at war when the nation’s 
attention focuses on a series of suicides. Dubbed the “pyjama suicides” 
by the press, these baffling deaths draw the attention of Holmes.
 
✓ The Scarlet Claw (1944): When Holmes and Watson travel to Canada to 
attend the meeting of the Royal Canadian Occult Society, they find 
themselves investigating the murder of their host’s wife. Was her killer 
the glowing, throat-slashing phantom the nearby villagers fear? With 
similarities to The Hound of the Baskervilles, this is the best of the 
Universal Studios films.
 
✓ The Pearl of Death (1944): When a valuable pearl is stolen from a 
museum, right out from under Holmes’s nose, he sets out to recover it. 
Toss in a string of brutal murders and a menacing killer known as the 
Creeper, and you have a nice, scary Sherlock Holmes movie.

271
 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
 
✓ The House of Fear (1945): When the “good comrades” gather together 
in a gloomy castle, one by one they start to drop dead. Just before they 
die, an envelope of orange pips is delivered to the next victim. Holmes 
investigates this case, which is clearly inspired by Agatha Christie’s 
classic, Ten Little Indians.
 
✓ The Woman in Green (1945): When it appears that a serial killer is loose in 
London, Holmes is called in by Scotland Yard for help. The investigation 
leads to a mysterious woman, an evil hypnotist, and ultimately, 
Professor Moriarty.
 
✓ Pursuit to Algiers (1945): In what is, hands down, the weakest film in the 
series, Holmes and Watson get mixed up in the plot to assassinate Nikolas, 
an heir to a foreign throne, who they are escorting on an ocean liner.
 
✓ Terror by Night (1946): The series bounces back with this low-budget 
but highly effective entry. While taking the overnight train to Edinburgh, 
Scotland, Holmes and Watson escort Roland Carstairs and his mother, 
owners of the famed diamond known as the Star of Rhodesia. When the 
diamond is stolen and Carstairs is murdered, Holmes sets out to catch 
the killer.
 
✓ Dressed to Kill (1946): The series draws to a close with Dressed to Kill. 
When the purchasers of a certain type of music box end up murdered, 
Holmes and Watson set out to discover the link between the victims and 
the motive for their deaths.
Rathbone’s Watson problem
Basil Rathbone didn’t get typecast and 
permanently identified with his character all 
alone. No — his Watson did, too, much to the 
consternation of Sherlockians. Nigel Bruce’s 
portrayal of Dr. Watson was about as far from 
the literary original as you could get. Doyle’s 
Watson is a practical, practicing doctor, 
about the same age as Holmes, attractive to 
women, and of average intelligence. Bruce, 
however, depicts Watson as an old, doddering, 
absent-minded buffoon. One insightful critic 
characterized his portrayal as “Boobus 
Britannicus.” Many more have asked the 
obvious question, “Why would someone like 
Holmes hang around with this idiot?”
But Bruce’s performance has to be evaluated 
in another way. To understand it only in 
comparison to the written Watson is to see it 
as an obvious failure. But these were popular 
movies, and Bruce’s screen Watson was pure 
entertainment, offering comic relief in times of 
tension and fear. And besides, he and Rathbone 
had terrific chemistry — their real-life friendship 
comes through on the screen. It’s no wonder 
that the public loved both of them. For the 
Sherlockian purists, however, Bruce’s 
inauthentic portrayal stamped Watson as an 
old fool for decades.

272
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
Despite the great popularity of Rathbone’s Holmes series, by Dressed to Kill, 
he had grown sick of Sherlock. He had become so permanently identified 
with the character (much as Nigel Bruce had with Watson) that in the minds 
of the public, he was Sherlock Holmes. Rathbone found himself typecast as 
the Great Detective, and his film career, which had burned so bright before 
playing Holmes, was a mere shadow of itself to the end of his life. Eventually, 
he reconciled himself to Holmes and even embraced the character again in 
later years. He should have been proud. He created a role that to this day is, 
for many, the greatest screen Sherlock of all time.
The 1950s and 1960s: Holmes gets color
In the two decades following the end of the Basil Rathbone film series, only 
two major Sherlock Holmes films were made. This undoubtedly had to do 
with Rathbone’s image of Holmes being so overwhelming in the public’s 
consciousness. But it also had to do with the onset of the TV age. Starting 
in the 1950s, Sherlock Holmes became a fixture on TV. Nonetheless, the two 
films that were produced are important in the history of Sherlockian cinema.
The Hound of the Baskervilles (1958)
Leave it to Britain’s Hammer Film Productions to produce the first color 
Sherlock Holmes movie. The studio is best-known for a series of lurid, 
Gothic horror films made from the mid-1950s into the 1970s. When 
Hammer decided to add Holmes to its roster, it turned to The Hound of the 
Baskervilles, producing the first big-screen Holmes film since Basil Rathbone 
had retired from the role 13 years earlier. Peter Cushing, a Hammer regular, 
was tapped to play Sherlock. Opposite him, as an intelligent, competent Dr. 
Watson, was Andre Morell. Hammer sensationalized the horror elements in 
The Hound and added a few of their own, including human sacrifices and a 
tarantula — but the spirit of the novel remains. One of its strongest moments 
comes in telling the story of Sir Hugo Baskerville and the origins of the 
hound. Hammer’s take on Sherlock Holmes comes highly recommended.
A Study in Terror (1965)
Despite an advertising campaign influenced by the campy hit TV show 
Batman (“He’s the original Caped Crusader! He’s Batman with brains!”), A 
Study in Terror is the first time that Sherlock Holmes was injected into a 
real-life, historical story. Starring John Neville as a rather refined Sherlock 
and Donald Houston as a Nigel Bruce-like Watson, the film centers on the 
Jack the Ripper crimes. What seems like a cliché now was utterly original in 
1965, as the film follows Holmes on his investigation into the seedy underworld 
of Whitechapel. Though the victims of the Ripper seem a bit too pretty, 
and their hair and makeup is of a mid-1960s vintage, A Study in Terror has 
its creepy moments. And of course, Holmes gets his man, all in glorious 
Technicolor.

273
 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
The 1970s: The second golden 
age of Sherlockian cinema
Though Sherlock Holmes appeared regularly on TV during the 1950s and 
1960s, his popularity seemed to have dimmed. This is reflected in his lack 
of big-screen appearances. Hollywood is a perfect barometer for measuring 
popular culture — when something, somewhere gets popular, Hollywood 
makes movies about it. So when Holmes became a hot property again in the 
1970s (triggered by the success of Nicholas Meyer’s novel The Seven-Per-
Cent-Solution; refer to Chapter 13), Hollywood jumped on the bandwagon, 
ushering in the second golden age of Sherlockian cinema.
The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970)
Over the years, Sherlock Holmes films have drawn many famous actors to the 
role. The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes showed that Holmes can land famous 
directors as well. Private Life is Billy Wilder’s melancholy, controversial, 
landmark study of the Great Detective. Holmes is played by Robert Stephens, 
a star of the British stage. Colin Blakely provides an entertaining, intelligent 
Dr. Watson, and the two have the best screen chemistry since Rathbone and 
Bruce.
The plot is entirely original. Private Life begins with a set piece involving a 
Russian ballerina who wants Holmes to father her child, and then it moves 
on to investigating the disappearance of a woman’s husband. The woman 
is played by Genevieve Page, and the romantic sparks between Holmes and 
his client fly as the investigation takes them to Scotland, where Mycroft, the 
Loch Ness Monster, and a German spy plot all figure into the story. Let’s just 
say it isn’t a happy ending for either Holmes or his leading lady.
The film wasn’t well received on release by either critics or moviegoers. 
The movie’s failure distressed Wilder so greatly that for decades he refused 
to talk about it. However, its reputation has only grown with time, and for 
Sherlockians and film aficionados alike, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is 
now seen as a near-masterpiece.
They Might Be Giants (1971)
Starring George C. Scott as a mentally ill man who believes he’s Sherlock 
Holmes and Joanne Woodward as a modern-day psychiatrist named Dr. 
Watson, They Might Be Giants explores the boundary between myth and 
reality. When Woodward’s Watson finds herself drawn into Scott’s delusion 
and into a real-life mystery as well, she and the viewer wonder just what is 
reality. Released just six months after The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, They 
Might Be Giants continues and extends the exploration of the Holmes charac-
ter. Where Private Life looked at Holmes in ways never before done on screen, 
Giants looked at Holmes as an icon, presenting an odd yet entertaining film.

274
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes’ Smarter Brother (1975)
Hot on the heels of Young Frankenstein came The Adventure of Sherlock 
Holmes’ Smarter Brother, which attempted to do for Sherlock Holmes what 
Young Frankenstein did for, well, Frankenstein. Gene Wilder, a confessed 
Sherlockian, plays Sigerson Holmes, the jealous, not-quite-as-talented 
younger brother of Sherlock. Resentful at living in his famous brother’s 
shadow, Sigerson sets up his own detective agency. When Sherlock sends 
a case to his brother, Sigerson teams up with Scotland Yard detective Sgt. 
Orville Stanley Sacker, played by the scene-stealing Marty Feldman. Together 
(and with the secret help of Sherlock), they set out to solve the case of their 
beautiful client, played by Madeline Kahn. Chock-full of Sherlockian references, 
The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes’ Smarter Brother is clearly made by, and for, 
fans of the Great Detective.
The Seven-Per-Cent-Solution (1976)
Based on the bestselling novel, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution pairs Sherlock 
Holmes with Dr. Sigmund Freud in a mystery that rewrites Sherlockian 
history and answers questions about Holmes’s personality. The film’s script 
was written by Nicholas Meyer, author of the novel. The film adaptation 
tweaks some of the story’s plot points and offers up a lavish, full-blown 
Hollywood extravaganza. Nicol Williamson stars as a wonderfully eccentric 
Sherlock Holmes, Alan Arkin is Freud, a terrific Robert Duvall plays Watson, 
Vanessa Redgrave is the beautiful damsel in distress, and none other than Sir 
Laurence Olivier plays Professor Moriarty. Shot on location in Vienna, this 
big-budget film is a romp and one of the favorites in all of Sherlockian cinema.
The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as We Know It (1977)
By 1977, the cycle of Sherlockian cinema had come full circle. Cinematic 
spoofs and parodies were common in the earliest, crude silent films, and 
now they were popular again. The Strange Case of the End of Civilization as 
We Know It was the second big-screen farce in three years. John Cleese plays 
Arthur Sherlock Holmes, the grandson of the great Sherlock. When the 
grandson of Professor Moriarty announces that the world will come to an end 
in five days, the president summons Arthur Sherlock Holmes to help. Nothing 
deep here — just plain Sherlockian fun.
The Hound of the Baskervilles (1978)
This comic adaption of The Hound of the Baskervilles, the third Holmes 
spoof of the decade, is best remembered as one of the biggest misfires in 
Sherlockian filmmaking history. Peter Cook, the great English satirist, writer, 
and comedian, plays Sherlock Holmes. Dudley Moore is Dr. Watson. Cook 
was legendary in Britain as a comedian in the 1960s, but this joint effort with 
Moore resulted in a sophomoric, self-indulgent mess. Some say the blame 
belongs to director Paul Morrissey, who denied Cook and Moore the creative 
control they wanted. But given the fact that Cook’s and Moore’s names are all 
over it, from the script to the score to the acting, they own it.

275
 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
Murder by Decree (1979)
Think of this as the post-Watergate Sherlock Holmes film. Murder by Decree 
stars the great Christopher Plummer as Holmes and James Mason as a 
steady, believable Watson. Once again, Holmes finds himself on the trail 
of Jack the Ripper. However, unlike in A Study in Terror, the trail is darker, 
and the mystery of the Whitechapel killer even deeper, as Holmes uncovers 
a government conspiracy to cover up the crimes and shield the killer. Rife 
with political intrigue, Murder by Decree offers a 1970s, blow-dried, sensitive 
Sherlock. But don’t be put off by that — it’s also a creepy, effective mystery.
The 1980s: The golden age continues
Although the 1980s didn’t produce the quantity (or the quality) of Sherlock 
Holmes films as the preceding decade, Hollywood still cranked out films 
about the Great Detective. This is remarkable, given that Holmes had been 
migrating from the big screen to TV. Here are three major examples of 
Sherlockian cinema from the 1980s:
 
✓ Young Sherlock Holmes (1985): When producer Steven Spielberg asked, 
“What if Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson met in boarding school?” 
the answer was Young Sherlock Holmes. In the Chris Columbus-written 
script, Holmes, famous among his peers for his deductive methods, 
battles an evil Egyptian cult. Along the way there’s a primitive flying 
machine, hallucinatory drugs, and stained-glass knights. Critics claimed 
that the film, directed by Barry Levinson, was a bit too Indiana Jones-
like. It clearly was intended to be the start of a franchise, but given its 
disappointing reception, Young Sherlock Holmes was a one-off effort.
 
✓ The Great Mouse Detective (1986): Based on the books by Eve Titus, 
The Great Mouse Detective is the Disney version of Basil of Baker Street. 
Basil is the detective mouse that lives within the walls of 221b Baker 
Street. Basil is enlisted to help find a girl mouse friend’s missing father, 
uncovering a larger plot along the way. At one point, the voice of Basil 
Rathbone makes a cameo as the off-screen Sherlock Holmes, making this 
his last turn as Holmes.
 
✓ Without a Clue (1988): The last big-screen Holmes film for over 20 years 
stars Michael Caine as Sherlock and Ben Kingsley as Watson. Without a 
Clue, however, turns the entire canon on its head by portraying Watson 
as the brilliant crime solver and Holmes as a drunken lout who only 
portrays the Great Detective in public. 
And so ended the last golden age of Sherlockian cinema, with Holmes and 
Watson as boys, a cartoon mouse, and Holmes as a drunken idiot. Perhaps it 
was time for a retreat after all.

276
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
 
But maybe another golden age of Sherlockian cinema in just around the 
corner. After 21 years, Holmes finally returned to the big screen in Sherlock 
Holmes, the action-packed blockbuster from 2009. Emphasizing the more 
physical aspects of Holmes’s character (sword fighting, martial arts, boxing, 
and so on), this film stars Robert Downey, Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as 
Dr. Watson. Director Guy Ritchie brings a fresh interpretation of Holmes and 
Watson to a new generation of fans.
Sherlock Holmes on TV
The Great Detective holds an honored place in TV history. Though you may 
know that the character has been the star of a number of well-known TV 
series produced over the decades, you may be surprised to discover that 
Holmes was instrumental in the early development of TV broadcasting in 
America, which is where Sherlock Holmes launched his TV career.
 
TV technology began to be seriously developed in the 1920s, close on 
the heels of wireless radio communication. The first truly successful TV 
technologies were invented by the Russian-born American physicist Vladimir 
Kosma Zworykin in 1923 and by the American radio engineer Philo Taylor 
Farnsworth shortly thereafter. TV broadcasting on a regular basis began in 
England in 1936 and in the U.S. in 1939, but these regularly scheduled broadcasts 
were interrupted by World War II.
 
The National Broadcasting Company began trial TV broadcasts in New York 
City in 1937. On November 27 of that year, NBC aired the very first “teleplay,” 
a production of the Sherlock Holmes short story “The Three Garridebs.” Prior 
to this, TV broadcasts were news, or merely technical tests. This was the very 
first production of a TV drama. Holmes was chosen as a subject because of 
his popularity, and “The Three Garridebs” was selected because it had an 
American angle. There are no records of how many people actually saw it.
NBC’s production starred Louis Hector as Holmes and William Podmore as 
Watson. One of the members of the small audience was a reporter for The 
New York Times, who the next day described it as “an ambitious experiment 
in teleshowmanship.” He went on to add, “The presentation revealed how a 
skillful TV producer may make use of the best of two mediums, how viewers 
may witness the realism of flesh and blood acting allied with the more 
spectacular scenic effects achieved by the screen.” Though the picture was a 
little fuzzy and crude, The Three Garridebs was a success.
Holmes next appeared on TV on March 12, 1948, in a production titled Tea 
Time for Baker Street, which aired on WWJ-TV in Detroit. It was created and 
produced by a well-known Sherlockian named Russell McLaughlin, founder 
of the Detroit Holmes club called the Amateur Mendicant Society. Tea Time 
for Baker Street is an adventure in which Holmes and Watson are out on a 
case. The main character is Mrs. Hudson, who, with the aid of her friend 

277
 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
Mrs. Wiggins, solves a crime in their absence. The entire cast was made up 
of members of the Amateur Mendicant Society. The second-ever Sherlockian-
themed telecast was written, produced, and acted by Sherlockians.
Since these early productions, Sherlock Holmes has been featured in numerous 
TV series. I discuss the four most important in the following sections.
The New Adventures of Sherlock 
Holmes (1954–1955)
Although Sherlock Holmes had popped up a few times in the early days of 
TV, it was producer Sheldon Reynolds who first set out to create an entire 
TV series for Sherlock. Ronald Howard, the son of actor Leslie Howard, was 
cast as Holmes. His Watson was played by H. Marion Crawford, a familiar 
character actor in British TV, film, and radio drama. The series lasted for an 
impressive 39 episodes. Reynolds chose to shoot the show in France, where 
it was cheaper to produce. Often you’ll see French actors in bit parts struggling 
to hold onto their English accents. But it wasn’t the production values that 
hurt the show — it was the writing. Many of the episodes were adaptations of 
the canonical tales, but many more were original stories that played Holmes 
and Watson for camp or comedy. When you see a title like “The Case of the 
Baker Street Bachelors,” you know you’re in trouble!
Howard’s portrayal of Holmes emphasized his youth and sincerity and 
downplayed the mood swings, drug abuse, and rudeness found in the 
character. Crawford’s Watson swings wildly from the traditional blustering 
sidekick in some episodes to a steady, reliable partner in others. But overall, 
The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is an entertaining, if often eyebrow-
raising, early Sherlock Holmes TV series.
Sherlock Holmes (1964–65)
In 1964, the BBC decided to bring Sherlock Holmes back to the small screen 
in a regular series. One of its promises was that it would be as true to the 
spirit of the canon as possible, including the sexual undertones and violence 
that do, indeed, happen in the tales. In their promotion of the show, the 
BBC announced that late-Victorian and early-Edwardian London would be 
accurately reproduced, making this the most accurate adaptation ever. The 
producers cast Douglas Wilmer as Holmes and Nigel Stock as Dr. Watson.
Wilmer, who was a fan of Holmes, is an excellent Sherlock, often portraying 
the many sides of the detective’s complicated personality — even his 
unflattering ones. Stock gives a fine performance as Watson, helping with 
the long rehabilitation of the character after Nigel Bruce’s bumbling duffer 
opposite Basil Rathbone.

278
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
Wilmer starred in 13 episodes of the series but declined to reprise the role 
when the series was renewed. It was then that the BBC turned to another 
actor familiar with the role of Holmes, Peter Cushing, when the series was 
revived in 1968.
Sherlock Holmes (1968)
When Douglas Wilmer bowed out of the BBC’s Holmes series after one 
season, the BBC turned to an actor who had already played Sherlock on the 
big screen — Peter Cushing. It was a good choice. Cushing had risen to fame 
in a long string of horror movies produced by Hammer Studios. Best-known 
for playing Baron Frankenstein and Dr. Van Helsing, Cushing donned the 
deerstalker in the 1958 Hammer version of The Hound of the Baskervilles. (Of 
course, to later generations, Cushing would be remembered as Grand Moff 
Tarkin, commander of the Death Star in Star Wars.)
If anything, Cushing was an even greater fan of Holmes than Wilmer was, 
often changing the script to conform to the text of the canon. In later interviews, 
Cushing claims the short shooting schedule, coupled with personal concerns 
(his wife was extremely ill at the time), resulted in only mediocre performances 
on his part. But he’s wrong. Cushing is terrific in the role, and his 16-episode 
series is one of the best adaptations of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
The Granada Television “Sherlock Holmes” 
series (1984–1995)
At the beginning of the 1980s, Michael Cox of Britain’s Granada Television 
set out to do what no one had done before — produce the most faithful, 
accurate adaptation of Sherlock Holmes ever brought to screen. To do this, 
Cox assembled the cream of British TV talent — writers, directors, and 
cinematographers with credits and experience on some of Britain’s most 
famous productions.
Cox took a significant first step when his team compiled The Baker Street File: 
A Guide to the Appearance and Habits of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Using 
the original 60 stories, they compiled a list of character traits, descriptions of 
persons and places, and other details. This became the “bible” that scriptwrit-
ers, actors, and the production team used to maintain authenticity. Whenever 
a question arose about a set or a character’s clothing or personality, the team 
could find the answer in The Baker Street File. It also allowed them to build 
believable interior sets for 221b Baker Street, and further research resulted in 
an amazing block-long exterior reconstruction of Baker Street itself.

279
 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
Despite this unprecedented effort, it would have all been in vain without 
the final piece of the puzzle — actors who would play Sherlock Holmes, Dr. 
Watson, and the other regular characters.
The cast and the chemistry
In the role of Sherlock Holmes, Cox and company cast Jeremy Brett (see 
Figure 14-3), a classically trained actor perhaps best-known for playing Freddy 
Eynsford-Hill, Audrey Hepburn’s lovesick suitor from My Fair Lady. Brett’s 
performance came like a thunderclap to viewers used to the traditional 
interpretation of Holmes. Whereas previous Sherlocks tended to fix on indi-
vidual characteristics of Holmes’s complex personality, Brett presented the 
full character, warts and all. Not only did Brett’s performance finally replace 
Rathbone’s as Sherlock Holmes in the public’s mind, but it also changed 
the public’s understanding of Holmes. No longer was Sherlock a stuffy, old-
fashioned straight arrow, saying, “Elementary, my dear Watson,” while being 
followed around by a doddering old duffer. No, Brett’s Holmes was mesmeriz-
ing, brilliant, moody, drug-abusing, and, to be honest, a bit scary.
No other actor struggled with the role of Sherlock Holmes as much as Brett 
did. In a 1987 interview for The Sherlock Holmes Review, Brett spoke about 
his thoughts on playing the Great Detective. “I was never really turned on to 
Sherlock,” said Brett. “I find him a cold fish. It’s only later, when I was offered 
the part and started to read the stories again, that I began to find lots of 
chinks in the armor which made it more human to play.” Brett immersed 
himself in the role, and by the end of the series, the line between the actor 
and the role had, for actor and viewer alike, become a bit blurred. His 
interpretation has colored the performance of every actor who has portrayed 
the Great Detective in his wake.
As important to Cox as getting Holmes right was the rehabilitation of Dr. 
Watson. Gone was Nigel Bruce’s entertaining but moronic portrayal. Instead, 
Cox cast David Burke, who gave an utterly believable portrayal of the good 
Doctor. Burke made viewers believe that the Watson on screen could have 
actually written the stories and was the kind of man who could forge a 
friendship with the Great Detective. After the first 13 installments, Burke left 
the show, and Cox hit another home run by casting Edward Hardwicke as 
Granada’s second Dr. John Watson. Hardwicke was up to the task and 
continued to redefine the character. Watson was elevated from the bumbling 
comic-relief character familiar to generations and was rightfully reinstated as 
Doyle’s original vision from the canon.
With Holmes and Watson cast, the final piece of the puzzle fell into place. 
Brett and Burke, and then Brett and Hardwicke, got the relationship — the 
friendship — right. It’s this friendship that drives the entire canon and keeps 
readers (and viewers) coming back to the stories again and again. Granada 
got it right.

The results
The first episode of this landmark series debuted in Britain on April 24, 
1984, and in the U.S. on May 14, 1985. Over the next ten years, Granada 
adapted 41 of the 60 canonical adventures for the small screen, with many 
memorable episodes. Perhaps your favorite is “A Scandal in Bohemia” (the 
first adventure to air), with the beautiful Gayle Hunnicutt as Irene Adler. Or 
is it “The Final Problem,” the first to actually shoot the climactic meeting 
between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty where it happened at the 
Reichenbach Falls? Who can forget the horror and grief of Watson as he calls 
to his friend down in that fearful chasm? Or maybe, as many fans of the show 
will tell you, it’s impossible to pick a favorite, so great is the quality of this 
series.
 
Granada’s series is not only the best Sherlock Holmes TV series produced to 
date but also one of the most successful historical TV series ever produced. 
Seen in over 50 countries around the world, it stands as a shining example of 
how a faithful adaptation of a literary classic can work wonders on the screen.

 Chapter 14: Adapting Holmes for Stage and Screen
The made-for-TV movies
The 1970s were a golden age of Sherlockian cinema, with seven major Holmes 
films appearing on the big screen during the decade. But that wasn’t the 
only screen that Holmes appeared on at that time. The decade that gave us 
Jimmy Carter, the pet rock, and disco also gave us a long run of made-for-TV 
Sherlock Holmes movies. Film and TV producers like nothing better than a 
trend, and in the 1970s, Holmes was hot. In fact, the made-for-TV Sherlock 
Holmes movie phenomenon continued right through the next three decades, 
into the new millennium. Following are some of the highlights.
Sherlock Holmes in New York (1976)
With the big-budget theatrical release of The Seven-Per-Cent-Solution set for 
October 24, 1976, 20th Century Fox Television had to work fast to cash in. 
Their efforts paid off — Sherlock Holmes in New York aired on October 18, 
1976, exactly six days before The Seven-Per-Cent-Solution hit theater screens. 
For a TV movie, Sherlock Holmes in New York looks great.
By having a first-rate cast of real, Hollywood actors, as well as reusing the 
sets from the film Hello Dolly!, this quickie TV movie looks like a theatrical 
film. Roger Moore, the James Bond of the 1970s and early 1980s, is a bit stiff 
in the role of Sherlock (and he might sport the worst hair in any Holmes 
film, ever). Opposite is Patrick Macnee, who is a serviceable, if forgettable, 
Watson. John Huston, the great film director, steals every scene he’s in as 
Professor Moriarty, shamelessly (and entertainingly) chewing the scenery. 
But the plot is the weak link. With a Machiavellian plan by Moriarty to steal 
gold in New York City and a romance between Irene Adler and Holmes, 
Sherlock Holmes in New York is a combination of camp, melodrama, and 
clever mystery plotting.
The Return of the World’s Greatest Detective (1976)
This made-for-TV movie borrows the premise of the theatrical They Might 
Be Giants and gives it a more lighthearted spin. In The Return of the World’s 
Greatest Detective, the pre-Dallas Larry Hagman stars as the bumbling LAPD 
motorcycle officer Sherman Holmes. Sherman, who loves Sherlock Holmes, 
has his motorcycle fall on his head while he’s reading the canon. After getting 
knocked on the head, he believes he is Sherlock Holmes. The injury has 
somehow given him Holmes’s abilities of observation and deduction, as well 
as a British accent!
As in They Might Be Giants, Sherman/Sherlock is assigned a police psychiatrist 
named Dr. Watson (played by Jenny O’Hara), and before too long, Holmes 
and Watson are on a real murder case. The Return of the World’s Greatest 
Detective was a pilot for an intended series. Unfortunately for Sherlockians, 
Hagman got another job — the character of J. R. Ewing on Dallas — and the 
show never materialized.

282
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
The Hound of the Baskervilles/The Sign of the Four (1983)
In the early 1980s, Sy Weintraub, an American producer, began working on a 
series of six Sherlock Holmes TV movies. These programs were to be faithful 
adaptations of original canonical stories. Casting was complete, with the 
outstanding Ian Richardson set to play Holmes, and production had begun. 
Unfortunately, Weintraub wasn’t the only one with the idea — it turned out 
that Granada Television was beginning work on their own Holmes series, 
starring Jeremy Brett. After a long, contentious legal battle, a settlement was 
reached, with Granada going on to produce its series and Weintraub settling 
for just his version of The Sign of the Four and The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Looking remarkably like Basil Rathbone, Richardson strikes a good balance 
between Holmes the moody eccentric and Holmes the brilliant, single-minded 
detective. Even though Richardson never played Holmes again, he went on 
to play the inspiration for Holmes, Dr. Joseph Bell in the 1999 series The 
Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes. It’s a shame that more installments in 
this series weren’t made, as Richardson is an outstanding Sherlock, and both 
these made-for-TV films are solid, entertaining productions.
The Masks of Death (1984)
Nearly 20 years after Peter Cushing last played Sherlock Holmes on TV, 
he donned the deerstalker one last time in The Masks of Death. The movie 
starts with Holmes in retirement, until, that is, he is visited by Inspector 
MacDonald. It seems there’s a case that’s crying out for assistance from 
Sherlock Holmes. Holmes agrees to MacDonald’s request to come out of 
retirement, and the game is afoot! A string of mysterious murders, with no 
detectable way for the victims to have died, has Scotland Yard stumped. 
As Holmes and Watson get to work, things get complicated as the detective 
searches for a missing prince, and Germany and England find themselves on 
the brink of war.
The Crucifer of Blood (1999)
This made-for-TV version of the stage play starred Charlton Heston — yes, 
that’s right, Charlton Heston — as Sherlock Holmes. Heston, better known 
for The Ten Commandments and Planet of the Apes, wasn’t a stranger to 
the Great Detective, having played the part on stage 11 years earlier in 
Los Angeles’s acclaimed Ahmanson Theatre production of The Crucifer of 
Blood. Coincidentally, it was in that play that Jeremy Brett, who went on to 
play Holmes in the Granada Television series, played Dr. Watson to Heston’s 
Holmes. The TV movie of The Crucifer of Blood was adapted, directed, and 
produced by Heston’s son Fraser.

F
rom the moment his popularity exploded with his first appearance in 
The Strand Magazine, Sherlock Holmes has commanded an enthusiastic 
following. As early as 1902, the term Sherlockian was used in print to describe 
those Holmes fans afflicted with a devotion to the world’s greatest detective. 
This devotion has engendered an unprecedented phenomenon of literary 
societies, fan clubs, and publications about Sherlock that span the globe. It 
all began in the 1930s with a single, and singular, organization — the Baker 
Street Irregulars — and the game was afoot!
In this chapter, I look at Sherlock Holmes’s devoted following, from its start 
back in the 1930s up into the 21st century.
The Baker Street Irregulars
 
Any look at the phenomenal following of Sherlock Holmes must start with the 
Baker Street Irregulars, the premier Holmes society in the world. Membership 
numbers just a few hundred worldwide and is by invitation only.
Christopher Morley, the group’s founder
Any look at the Baker Street Irregulars must begin with the point man of the 
entire Sherlockian movement: Christopher Morley.

284
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
Christopher Morley was born May 5, 1890, in Haverford, Pennsylvania. He 
was among that fortunate generation of children who were raised on the 
Sherlock Holmes stories as they were being published. In adulthood, Morley 
was one of the most popular writers of the early 20th century — a best-selling 
author, book reviewer, poet, playwright, literary columnist, and, later in life, a 
television game-show panelist.
Morley wrote a long list of popular novels and was a columnist for newspapers 
and magazines. He had a regular column in several publications, including 
The Saturday Review of Literature and The Evening Post, both of which featured 
a great deal of Sherlockian commentary, before and after the Baker Street 
Irregulars had been established. In his Saturday Review of Literature column 
of January 7, 1933, Morley wrote a piece speculating when the birthday of 
Sherlock Holmes was. (Morley proposed January 6, a date that Sherlockians 
have largely accepted.) Readers immediately began responding, and many of 
these correspondents later became members of the Baker Street Irregulars.
 
So it was Christopher Morley’s regular injection of Sherlockiana into his 
magazine columns that helped light the fuse for the creation of the first, and 
most famous, Sherlock Holmes society.
Christopher Morley’s many clubs
Christopher Morley had many friends and 
acquaintances, and one of his favorite 
pastimes was starting clubs. Most were 
short-lived, meeting only once or twice, but 
two of his groups ended up being direct 
precursors to the Baker Street Irregulars. 
The first was the Grillparzer Morals-Police 
Association (named after a secondhand book 
he had just purchased), and the second was 
the Three Hours for Lunch Club. The latter 
society’s rationale was “to be truant from one’s 
workplace with agreeable friends doing agree-
able things: lunching, drinking, sightseeing, 
book shopping.” The membership of these two 
clubs was largely intertwined, and none of his 
clubs had regular schedules, instead meeting 
only when the spirit moved Morley to call 
up his friends. Recounting the adventures of 
the Three Hours for Lunch Club in Morley’s 
“Bowling Green” column became a regular 
feature and was a favorite of his readership. 
Both the Grillparzer Morals-Police Association 
and the Three Hours for Lunch Club had 
members who were also in the first ranks of 
Baker Street Irregulars membership.

285
 Chapter 15: Communities of Sherlockians
The members
According to the history of the Baker Street Irregulars (or BSI), the group’s first 
official meeting was held on January 6, 1934, at the Hotel Duane in Manhattan. 
Though it was a memorable affair for those who attended, it really wasn’t much 
more than a cocktail party celebrating the birthday of Sherlock Holmes. It 
wasn’t until December 7, 1934, that the Irregulars held their first annual dinner 
at Christ Cella restaurant. Eighteen members were present.
By the end of the 1940s, the Sherlockian movement had spawned local chap-
ters all across the country, and eventually, all around the world, and the 
Sherlockian universe had been established. Since 1946, the Irregulars have 
published a quarterly journal, The Baker Street Journal, that contains articles 
analyzing and commenting on the Holmes stories as if they were real, historic 
events. Sherlockians call this “playing the game.”
 
You can subscribe to The Baker Street Journal at www.bakerstreet
journal.com.
For decades, membership in the BSI was male-only, but in 1991, the Irregulars 
went coeducational (see the sidebar “The Adventuresses of Sherlock Holmes” 
for details). Over the years, the BSI membership has included many famous 
authors — Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, August Derleth, Neil Gaiman, John 
Gardner, Howard Haycraft, Ellery Queen, Rex Stout — as well as publishers, jour-
nalists, book dealers, politicians, businessmen, and actors. The BSI have even 
included two U.S. presidents (Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman).
The Adventuresses of Sherlock Holmes
The decade of the 1960s was an era of social 
revolution, and these winds of change were felt 
even in the world of Sherlock Holmes. When the 
(at that time) all-male Baker Street Irregulars 
refused to admit women, a small group of 
female college students picketed the annual 
dinner of the BSI, urging a change in policy. 
When the demands of these young women, 
all from Albertus Magnus College (a small, 
private, liberal arts college in New Haven, 
Connecticut), fell on deaf ears, they responded 
by founding the Adventuresses of Sherlock 
Holmes (ASH), a women-only alternative, with 
membership granted by invitation. For 25 years, 
ASH held a dinner meeting on the same night 
as the BSI, somewhere across Manhattan. The 
Adventuresses’ dinner, however, was open to 
both men and women. Finally, when the BSI 
opened its doors to women in 1991, four men 
were in turn made special members of ASH. It 
wasn’t until 2008, however, that ASH became 
fully coeducational. The Adventuresses con-
tinue on today, with annual spring and autumn 
dinners and lunches throughout the year. In 
addition, they publish their own quarterly jour-
nal, The Serpentine Muse, and have issued a 
two-volume anthology of Sherlockian essays. 
You can find out more about ASH at www.
ash-nyc.com.

286
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
The meetings
The BSI meet every January in New York City for their annual dinner 
celebrating the birthday of Sherlock Holmes. The one-night affair has grown 
over the years, as other events have been added and other Sherlockian 
organizations have scheduled meetings and dinners around the BSI’s. From 
Christopher Morley’s modest beginnings has grown a prestigious society 
devoted to keeping green the memory of Sherlock Holmes.
The Scion Societies
Shortly after the Baker Street Irregulars began, local chapters started 
springing up across the country. These small groups quickly became known 
as scion societies. The dictionary defines the word scion as “a descendant of 
a wealthy, aristocratic, or influential family,” and that was, especially in the 
early days, a good way to understand the relationship between the BSI and 
the local organizations. When local Sherlockians founded their own Holmes 
club, they petitioned the parent organization for official recognition as a 
scion society of the Baker Street Irregulars.
Being affiliated with the BSI imposed no requirements, rules, or criteria 
upon the scion society. (Every Sherlock Holmes club is free to engage in 
Sherlockian pursuits according to its own lights.) What it did, and still does, 
is unite the local club in spirit with the legendary group that started it all.
Many Sherlock Holmes clubs remain independent of the BSI. Indeed, sometimes 
fans of Holmes come together and form a club with no knowledge of this 
network of Holmes societies, living in a sort of Sherlockian Galapagos 
Islands, without any contact with the larger world of Sherlock Holmes. Other 
clubs remain independent by choice. There’s even a new phenomenon of 
Sherlockian organizations being formed in ways, and for motivations, not 
seen in the past. Consider these examples:
 
✓ Some Sherlock Holmes clubs have been formed specifically around the 
Granada Television Sherlock Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett.
 
✓ A considerable group of fans have little interest in the original canon but 
are instead organized around the Sherlock Holmes/Mary Russell novels 
of Laurie King. (Local chapters are called hives.)
 
✓ Some science fiction fans cross over, forming clubs blending the worlds 
of Holmes and Star Trek, again with little interest in the original canon or 
the traditional Holmes clubs.
The great thing is that the Sherlockian universe is big enough for everyone.

287
 Chapter 15: Communities of Sherlockians
How scion societies start
There are as many ways to start a Sherlock Holmes club as there are 
Sherlock Holmes clubs. One often starts when a couple of Sherlockians meet 
and discover their mutual love of the canon. A poster in the public library 
or local mystery bookstore can be the key to discovering a number of 
like-minded people with an interest in the Great Detective. Sending notices of 
the new group’s first meeting to your town’s community event calendars in 
the newspaper and on the radio can bring you members as well. Any method 
of getting the word out to the public about a new Sherlock Holmes club often 
does the trick — Sherlockians are everywhere!
When it comes to Sherlockian groups, new members are often pleasantly 
surprised that most scion societies have a huge social component to them. 
Spending time with fellow Sherlockians is almost as much fun as reading the 
stories themselves.
 
John Bennett Shaw was a popular and revered member of the Baker Street 
Irregulars. Shaw’s minimum criteria for starting your own scion society was 
“two Sherlockians, a copy of the canon, and a bottle. In a pinch you can 
dispense with one of the Sherlockians.”
What’s in a name?
To the outsider, the cryptic names that Sherlock Holmes societies adopt 
for themselves seem strange. But in reality, most of the names are drawn 
from the canon. Some of the best examples of the whimsical phenomenon of 
Sherlockian scion society names include
 
✓ The Goose Club of the Alpha Inn: This California club takes its name 
from the organization that Henry Baker purchased his goose from in 
“The Blue Carbuncle.”
 
✓ The Double-Barrelled Tiger Cubs: Based in Urbana, Illinois, this club’s 
name is inspired by Watson’s tongue-tied storytelling (in an effort to 
impress Mary Morstan) in The Sign of the Four.
 
✓ The Amateur Mendicant Society: This scion society, based in the 
Detroit area, has adopted the name of a mysterious organization 
mentioned in one of Watson’s untold tales.
 
✓ The Giant Rats of Sumatra: One of the best-known untold tales also 
provides this Memphis, Tennessee, club with its picturesque name.
 
✓ The Cornish Horrors: This Scotch Plains, New Jersey, group was 
inspired by Holmes’s name for the case recorded in “The Devil’s Foot.”

288
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
 
Most Sherlock Holmes organizations take their name from something in the 
canon — either the name of a story (for instance, the Illustrious Clients of 
Indianapolis, the group your author belongs to), a character, or an event. 
Some have names that seem to indicate a numerically limited membership, 
but this usually isn’t the case. For instance:
 
✓ Three Garridebs of Westchester, New York, have way more than three 
members.
 
✓ The Scion of the Four, in Morgantown, West Virginia. Only four members? 
Nope . . . way more than four!
 
✓ The Six Napoleons of Baltimore, Maryland . . . likewise.
 
✓ The 140 Varieties of Tobacco Ash have a long way to go before they 
reach 140 members. Current membership is a canonical 17 (as in the 17 
steps up to Holmes’s rooms at 221b Baker Street).
Where and when and what?
Okay, so you want to start a Sherlock Holmes club, and you know how to 
promote it. But newcomers to the Sherlockian universe often wonder about 
some nuts-and-bolts questions, which I cover in the following sections.
Where do these groups meet?
The rule of thumb is whatever works for your group is where you should 
meet. Many clubs meet in members’ homes, particularly if the group is small 
enough. Others regularly gather in a restaurant, holding a dinner meeting in 
the tradition of the Baker Street Irregulars’ annual dinner. Others convene in 
private clubs, meeting rooms of the public library, or their local bookstore.
What do Sherlockians do at meetings?
Most Sherlockians will agree that one of the favorite activities of a 
Sherlockian scion society is simply socializing with your friends and fellow 
Holmes fans. However, most clubs do indeed do more than that. Some of the 
most common activities include
 
✓ Presenting scholarly papers: Researching and writing essays and 
articles about Sherlock Holmes, whether it’s mock-scholarship or 
serious research, is one of the longstanding traditions of Sherlockiana. 
Many Sherlockians will, at one time or another, find some aspect of the 
canon that intrigues them, look into it, and write it up. These works 
often find their way into journals, books, and other publications, but 
many also debut as presentations at a local meeting.

289
 Chapter 15: Communities of Sherlockians
 
✓ Taking the Sherlockian quiz: Another favorite activity is a brief quiz 
challenging the knowledge and ingenuity of the group’s members. This 
quiz is often on a story that’s up for discussion or some other topic, like 
Sherlockian cinema, characters from the canon, or story titles. The 
subjects for composing a Sherlockian quiz are endless.
 
✓ Discussing a story: Often, scion societies will select a story from the 
canon in advance for discussion at the meeting. This allows the members 
to debate the finer points of the story, as well as the numerous 
inconsistencies and ongoing mysteries the tales present.
 
✓ Presenting skits, plays, or reader’s theater: Many Sherlockians are 
moved to present dramatic enactments of the adventures of Sherlock 
Holmes. Brief comic skits, full-length plays, and group readings of a story 
are all activities that have occurred in Sherlockian scion societies.
 
✓ Showing and telling: One common activity is sharing newly discovered 
Sherlockiana with your fellow enthusiasts. Sherlock Holmes is perennially 
popular, and new books of pastiche adventures of scholarship and 
commentary regularly appear. Keeping up can be difficult, so sharing 
the news is a great idea! In addition, many Sherlockians are collectors, 
and showing off a recent acquisition of rare, collectible Sherlockiana is 
always appreciated.
 
✓ Viewing Sherlockian movies or TV: Of course, gathering to watch a 
Sherlock Holmes movie as a group is great fun, and many Holmes 
societies hold annual Sherlockian film meetings.
 
✓ Engaging in other unusual pursuits: Sherlockians rarely have an 
interest in only Sherlock Holmes. Those with other hobbies and interests 
often find ways of combining their love of Sherlock with other pursuits. 
For instance, some scions are organized around professions, including 
librarians, undertakers, and geologists! Other clubs combine a passion 
for Holmes with such interests as magic and magicians, the music of 
Gilbert and Sullivan, the stories of P. G. Wodehouse, or the appreciation 
of fine cigars. There’s even a Sherlock Holmes society for members of

The Sherlock Holmes Society of London
In England, the preeminent Sherlock Holmes society is, well . . . the Sherlock 
Holmes Society of London, which was founded in 1951. (There had once been 
a Sherlock Holmes Society back in the 1930s, but the onset of World War II 
ended the small group’s short existence.) Unlike the Baker Street Irregulars, 
the SHSL’s membership is open to any interested Sherlockian (or, as they say 
in England, “Holmesian”).

Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
In May 1951, to celebrate the Great Exhibition, London hosted an event called 
the Festival of Britain. It was only a few years after the end of World War II, 
and London was still recovering from the bombing and devastation of the 
war. It was felt that this exhibition could instill a feeling of progress, spur 
recovery, and lift the morale of the nation. Events and exhibitions happened 
at various sites around London and nearby.
The St. Marylebone Borough Council decided that an exhibition devoted to 
Sherlock Holmes should be installed. Marylebone was the neighborhood of 
Baker Street and Sherlock Holmes, so what could be more appropriate? After 
the decision was made, a group of local Holmesians in charge of planning 
the exhibition decided to re-create the sitting room at 221b Baker Street. 
Combing the canon for information, they gathered all the material mentioned 
in the stories — everything from the jackknife on the fireplace mantel to the 
wax dummy with a bullet hole in its head. The exhibit was installed in the 
Abbey National headquarters, which stood on the site of 221b Baker Street. 
(Abbey National was a British bank and building company at the time.) The 
exhibition was a smash hit, drawing more than 50,000 people.
The excitement generated by the Festival of Britain inspired those 
Holmesians who worked on it to start a new group, and shortly thereafter, 
the Sherlock Holmes Society of London was born. Within a very short time, 
the SHSL began publishing its own journal (The Sherlock Holmes Journal, 
which appears twice a year), and the group established an annual dinner in 
January, often on the same weekend as the Baker Street Irregulars. It was 
common for congratulatory telegrams to be exchanged between the groups 
on the evening of their festivities. The organization started with 100 members. 
Today, the membership list tops 1,000!
Over the course of the society’s history, pilgrimages have been made to 
Sherlockian locations on the continent, especially to Switzerland to see the 
Reichenbach Falls, site of the deadly encounter between Sherlock Holmes 
and Professor Moriarty.
In addition to an annual meeting, the SHSL holds dinner meetings featuring 
papers or other presentations and plenty of socializing. And once a year, the 
SHSL holds a Sherlock Holmes film evening devoted to the cinematic adventures 
of the Great Detective.

 Chapter 15: Communities of Sherlockians
A Web of Intrigue: Virtual 
Sherlock Holmes Societies
Though Sherlock Holmes appeared way back in the 1880s, his popularity is as 
strong as ever, lasting well into the 21st century. As technology and society 
both evolve, Holmes — and his fans — evolve as well. With the explosion of 
Internet usage, Sherlockians have found ways to share their enthusiasm for 
Holmes over the Web.
The Hounds of the Internet
The earliest manifestation of Web-based Sherlockian organizations belongs 
to the Hounds of the Internet. The Hounds is an online discussion group 
devoted to the study and enjoyment of Sherlock Holmes. Founded in 1992, 
right at the dawn of the Internet age, the group formed with a mere six 
members. Today, membership is in the hundreds, and the Hounds of 
the Internet is recognized as an official scion society of the Baker Street 
Irregulars. (For more information, see www.sherlockian.net/hounds/.)
Yahoo! Sherlock Holmes group listings
Other Sherlockian Internet discussion groups, fan clubs, and Web-based 
societies have appeared since the founding of the Hounds of the Internet. 
On the Web portal Yahoo!, you can find over 40 Sherlock Holmes groups, 
including
 
✓ sherlockholmesclub: This group has over 260 members and is open to 
all fans of Sherlock Holmes. Its aim is to invite comments and opinions 
on the canon, reflect on various Sherlockian issues, and bring noteworthy 
pastiches to the attention of club members.
 
✓ WelcomeHolmes: This popular online group boasts over 600 active 
members and makes a point to say that, while following the adventures 
of Sherlock Holmes, the members also “honor Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 
author and ‘teller of tales.’”

292
Part IV: Beyond Baker Street 
 
✓ Brett Rathbone Sherlock Holmes Baker Street Club: It’s pretty clear 
from this group’s title what its focus is. In addition to the canon itself, 
the group, which has over 180 members, places a heavy emphasis on 
the actors who’ve portrayed Holmes and Watson throughout the history 
of the motion picture.
 
✓ Sherlock Everywhere: This group stands at over 40 members, and the 
site is a “news exchange for collectors of all things Sherlockian.” It offers 
a place to report on new Sherlockiana and discuss “discoveries of both 
new Holmes items and old, publications currently arriving in Sherlockian 
mailboxes, and other news for the collector.”
 
✓ Baker Street: With over 75 members, this site offers a place to share 
your Sherlockian Web links, discuss theories about the stories, post 
essays, and, for collectors, advertise want lists and items for sale or 
trade.
 
✓ sherlockholmessittingroom: At 130 members, this site attempts to 
create a Sherlockian club room where members “can come in, sit a 
while, talk with some friends, leave messages, read others.”
The Sherlock Holmes Social Network
The Sherlock Holmes Social Network is a Facebook-like service hosted on 
ning, an online site that allows users to create their own social networks. The 
Sherlock Holmes Social Network (http://sherlockholmes.ning.com/) 
describes itself as “part discussion group, part social network,” adding that 
it exists “for one reason: Sherlock Holmes.” The site urges users to “bring up 
topics of interest to you, start discussions, share media files, start your own 
groups, make blog posts, etc.”
On the network, you can find even more Holmes groups, including the Jeremy 
Brett Fan Club (devoted to Brett and his interpretation of Sherlock Holmes), 
and Art in the Blood, an online Sherlockian gallery that allows artists to post 
drawings, paintings, sculpture, costumes, and other items of Sherlockian 
artwork.
As seems pretty clear, Sherlock Holmes is here to stay, and his admirers 
continue to get together and celebrate the Great Detective in ways both 
traditional and modern. Perhaps it’s time for you to start your own Sherlock 
Holmes society!

many readers will have in mind. These include: What 
are the ten unsolved mysteries found in the canon? Where 
would you go if you wanted to visit the actual places 
where the stories happened? What are the ten most 
important books about Sherlock Holmes that you should 
have on your shelf? And what are some of the most

I also include an appendix in this part that lists the active 
Sherlockian societies in the United States. 

Chapter 16
Ten Unsolved Mysteries
In This Chapter
▶ Wayward dogs and wandering wounds
▶ Multiple wives and missing years
▶ Curious canonical relationships
W
hen it came to Sherlock Holmes, Arthur Conan Doyle worked almost 
solely within the limits of the short story (remember, only 4 of the 60 
tales were novels). The demanding schedule of cranking out short stories for 
monthly publication required Sir Arthur to write quickly and often away from 
his writing desk at home. He once complained that cooking up plots for short 
stories was just as difficult as it was for the novels. He also considered the 
Holmes stories to be lesser works — merely adventure tales he knocked off 
between his more serious writing.
All of this adds up to Doyle boldly writing away without double-checking 
his earlier writings, thereby creating quite a few situations that you might 
call “gaps in continuity” today. Hashing out the details Doyle did provide 
and trying to reconcile the contradictions are favorite hobbies of fans and 
scholars alike.
The Missing Pup
Doyle seemed to forget that in A Study in Scarlet, Watson told Holmes that 
he had a dog. When they first meet, the two tell each other a bit about 
themselves to see if they’ll be good potential roommates. In addition to 
specifying various annoying habits, Watson says, “I keep a bull pup.” 
However, on moving-in day, the dog is gone, never to be seen. Ever. He’s 
not mentioned again in any story, not even by the most tenuously stretched 
reference.

296
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Some Sherlockians have suggested that by “bull pup,” Watson wasn’t referring 
to a dog but to a firearm of that name. However, Watson likely wouldn’t have 
been referring to a gun under the circumstances. Not only would it be more 
appropriate for him to “own” or “carry” a weapon than to “keep” one, but 
also, Holmes had no problem with weapons.
In “The Musgrave Ritual,” Watson speaks of the one time when his roommate 
Holmes fired a gun indoors:
I have always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an 
open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer humours, would 
sit in an armchair with his hair-trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges 
and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V. R. [Victoria 
Regina, or Queen Victoria] done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that 
neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved 
by it.
This is hardly the attitude of a man who would warn his roommate that he 
liked to fire his gun in the apartment, yet anyone who has raised a puppy 
knows how it can disrupt the routines of daily life. I believe Watson decided 
to find a new home for his dog when he remembered his friend Stamford 
saying of Holmes, “I could imagine [Holmes] giving a friend a little pinch 
of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, 
but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the 
effects.”
Watson’s Wound
In the opening lines of A Study in Scarlet, the reader finds out that Watson 
had been wounded in battle in Afghanistan, where he was “struck on the 
shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian 
artery.” In the later novel The Sign of the Four, however, he describes himself 
as “nursing my wounded leg. I had had a Jezail bullet through it some time 
before, and though it did not prevent me from walking it ached wearily at 
every change of the weather.” Later, in “The Noble Bachelor,” Doyle, perhaps 
realizing the inconsistency he had introduced, vaguely alludes to the Jezail 
bullet as being “in one of his limbs.”
So, what was it? This question has been hotly debated for decades! My 
personal favorite explanation is that both places are right. It happened like 
this — Watson must have been shot while he was bending over a wounded 
soldier during the battle. That way, the bullet passed clean through his upper 
leg and lodged in his shoulder. Voilà! One bullet, two distinct wounds.

297
 Chapter 16: Ten Unsolved Mysteries
The Great Hiatus
Following the fateful showdown between Sherlock Holmes and Professor 
Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls in 1891, Holmes disappeared for three 
years. The period of time between “The Final Problem,” in which Holmes 
presumably died, and “The Empty House,” which relates the details of his 
disappearance, is known by Sherlockians as “The Great Hiatus.”
What Holmes did to occupy those missing three years has led to unending 
debate and continued research in Sherlockian circles. Holmes’s own version 
is as follows:
I traveled for two years in Tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting 
Lhasa, and spending some days with the head lama. You may have read 
of the remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am 
sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your 
friend. I then passed through Persia, looked in at Mecca, and paid a short 
but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum, the results of which I 
have communicated to the Foreign Office. Returning to France, I spent 
some months in a research into the coal-tar derivatives, which I conducted 
in a laboratory at Montpellier, in the south of France.
Uh . . . right. Somehow this account just hasn’t rung true with Sherlockians, 
and some writers have come up with alternative explanations for this hiatus. 
In Nicholas Meyer’s novel The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, the hiatus is depicted 
as a private sabbatical following Holmes’s treatment for cocaine addiction 
at the hands of Sigmund Freud. Other fantastical, alternative explanations 
have been offered, and these missing years have a hold on the imagination of 
countless Sherlockians. Come on, Holmes . . . what were you really doing?
The Good Doctor’s Wives
It’s never been clear exactly how many wives Dr. Watson had during the 
course of his life. At the end of The Sign of the Four, he’s engaged to be married 
to Mary Marston, but readers never actually read about him marrying her. 
It’s a reasonable assumption that he did, because he’s married at the beginning 
of the next story, “A Scandal in Bohemia,” the first story in the collection The 
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.
One of the only things that appears definite is that Mary Marston seems to 
have died in 1894 during the three-year period when Holmes was presumed 
dead. Even this is little more than supposition, as Holmes simply expresses 

298
Part V: The Part of Tens 
condolences to Watson for his “bereavement” in the story “The Empty 
House.” Nowhere is it actually said that it was Watson’s wife who had died, 
and some writers have interpreted “bereavement” to mean something other 
than death — perhaps merely marital separation.
However, in “The Blanched Soldier,” set in 1903, Holmes is chagrined when 
Watson marries, so it seems clear that something had happened to Mary 
Marston by at least the early 1900s, and thus Dr. Watson had at least two 
wives during the course of his life.
Beyond that, Doyle’s careless continuity within the stories has led scholars 
to deduce that there were more than two Mrs. Watsons. Some of these theories 
are based on what story happened when. Others are dependent on even 
more tenuous clues. Part of the confusion regarding Watson’s wives is that 
he never once mentioned any of them by name, and all this has led some to 
claim that there were up to half a dozen Watsonian marriages!
Sherlock and Irene: Did 
Holmes Fall in Love?
Despite Watson’s firm denial, many readers just can’t help it. There’s 
something about the mysterious Irene Adler that they just can’t let go of. 
Something tells them that Holmes fell for her.
Right at the beginning of “A Scandal in Bohemia,” Watson says, “It was not 
that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that 
one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced 
mind.” But most readers don’t buy it. Watson works hard to convince them, 
saying, “Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-
power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a 
nature such as his.” But even the Good Doctor has doubts. He quickly adds, 
“And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene 
Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.”
Sherlockian scholars, pastiche writers, and moviemakers have romantically 
paired the Great Detective with the beautiful, iron-willed, resourceful 
“adventuress” over and over again. But don’t blame them; blame Watson. 
Despite his claims to the contrary, it’s clear that he knew something was 
up between the two. He mentions a secret about Sherlock — that he keeps 
Irene’s picture locked in his desk drawer. “And when he speaks of Irene 
Adler,” he adds, “or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the 
honourable title of the woman.”
Oh, yeah . . . he fell for her.

299
 Chapter 16: Ten Unsolved Mysteries
The Moriarty Brothers
How many Moriarty brothers were there? And what were their names? As 
trivial as this may sound, the question has vexed Sherlockians for decades. 
It all stems, once again, from sloppy continuity on the part of Arthur Conan 
Doyle.
In “The Final Problem,” Watson tells of how he’s moved to write the story 
because of “the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the 
memory of his brother.” Then, in “The Empty House,” the professor’s first 
name is finally revealed — it’s James, just like his aforementioned brother!
And finally, in The Valley of Fear, Holmes says that the professor “is unmarried. 
His younger brother is a stationmaster in the west of England.” So, there were 
three Moriarty brothers, and at least two of them had the first name of James. 
But is this so? The question of how many Moriarty brothers there were, and 
how many of them were called James (the favorite theory is that they were 
all named James!), has provided much amusement for Sherlock Holmes fans 
in the years since the stories were first published.
Canonical Chronology
Almost from when the Holmes stories were first being written, readers and 
commentators began trying to determine when the stories took place, and 
in what order they actually happened. Of course, such inquiry depends on 
treating the stories as accounts of real events and real people. This intellectual 
game has been a hallmark of Sherlockian fandom from the beginning, and one 
of its earliest manifestations was working out the canonical chronology.
Since the publication of the final Sherlock Holmes story, at least 17 full 
canonical chronologies have been completed. Each one tries to date all 60 
stories by day, month, and year. You would think this would be pretty easy, 
right? Just read the stories, make a note of when Watson says they took 
place, and by the final story, you’ll have a chronology.
If only it were that easy. Doyle’s internal inconsistencies and Watson’s 
admission to fudging dates, facts, and names to protect the identities of 
those involved have led to a wide disagreement among the chronologists, 
who concur on only about 40 percent of the stories.
Two Sherlockians who’ve actually studied the various canonical chronologies, 
Andrew J. Peck and Leslie S. Klinger, list the elements that most chronologists 
use to make their list. These include

300
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ References to newspapers, letters, and real-life publications like 
Whitaker’s Almanack
 
✓ Statements by Holmes or Watson that are backed up by evidence from 
other places in the canon
 
✓ Claims by any character that can be confirmed by independent sources
 
✓ Unverifiable, uncorroborated statements
In the end, does it matter? Not really, but once the notion of treating the 
Sherlock Holmes stories as reality takes root, the puzzle of what happened 
when becomes almost addictive.  
What Color Was Holmes’s 
Dressing Gown?
Most people know the iconography that immediately calls to mind Sherlock 
Holmes — deerstalker hat; big, curvy calabash pipe; magnifying glass. Right 
behind these items is Sherlock’s favorite around-the-house wardrobe article, 
the dressing gown. Throughout the canon, Holmes is portrayed wearing it 
over his clothes. He wears it while doing chemical experiments, smoking 
during a “three-pipe problem,” working on updating his scrapbooks, and 
even interviewing new clients. Holmes wore it not only for comfort but also, 
undoubtedly, to keep away the chill of his 19th-century flat.
But what color was it? At various times his dressing gown has been described 
as being blue, purple, and “mouse,” which most people agree is a grey/brown 
color. As trivial as it may seem, even this question has taxed the minds of 
Sherlockian scholars. Were there three separate gowns, or is the theory of 
Christopher Morley, the founder of the Baker Street Irregulars, correct? His 
theory is that there was only one gown, which began life as blue, faded over 
time to purple, and then finally ended up being “mouse.”
 
The official colors of the Baker Street Irregulars’ club tie are blue, purple, and 
grey, reflecting the different shades of Holmes’s dressing gown.

301
 Chapter 16: Ten Unsolved Mysteries
The Knighthood Question: Why 
French and Not English?
At the beginning of “The Three Garridebs,” Doyle writes that Holmes had 
been offered knighthood for his services to the country over the years. To 
the reader’s shock, however, Holmes refused the honor, and Doyle offers no 
explanation for why Holmes turned it down.
Some Sherlockians have speculated that Holmes’s rejection of the honor shows 
his contempt for authority. Others have proposed that public honors such as 
knighthood went against his more private nature. The question becomes more 
difficult when you consider that earlier, in “The Golden Pince-Nez,” Watson 
says that Holmes accepted the highest honor the French government can 
bestow, the legendary Legion d’honneur. Which begs the question: Why accept 
such an honor from France and not from your own country?
Perhaps something happened during those eight years that altered his 
perspective on such things. And after all, Holmes’s grandmother was French, 
which may have been a factor in his acceptance of the Legion of Honor. In 
real life, when Doyle himself was offered knighthood, his first inclination was 
to turn it down. However, his mother was shocked that her son would insult 
the king of England in such a way, and she insisted that he accept. And so he 
did. But evidently, his mother’s influence couldn’t keep Doyle from having 
Sherlock turn it down! Surely, Holmes’s refusal of knighthood is a projection 
of Doyle’s own feelings about the award.
Where Was 221b Baker Street?
Originally, 221b Baker Street existed only in the world of Sir Arthur’s imagination. 
When Doyle first worked up the location of Holmes’s rooms, he mentioned in 
his notes the area of “Upper Baker Street.” At that time, however, no such 
number as 221 (with or without a letter) really existed on that street; it was just 
something he made up.
Through an odd series of coincidences over the decades, Baker Street 
underwent some alterations that resulted in the appearance of a real 221b — 
in the area that was called “Upper Baker Street.” Thus, Holmes finally came 
home to where he had been all along.

Ten Sherlockian Places to Visit
In This Chapter
▶ Visiting the most famous Sherlockian address
▶ Checking out other Holmesian sites in London
▶ Seeing a U.S. location that figures in the canon’s beginnings
I
n this chapter, you find a potpourri of Sherlockian sites — actual physical 
locations to visit that are mentioned in various Holmes stories. Not 
surprisingly, most are located in London, where Sherlock Holmes lived and 
worked. However, there are canonical sites all over England and Europe and, 
as you’ll see in this list, even in the United States!
You may find it astonishing how much of Sherlockian London still exists. For 
the Holmesian, visiting these places makes the stories come alive.
The Baker Street Tube Station
The number one location on most Sherlockians’ list of places to visit is Baker 
Street. The mere mention of this commercial thoroughfare conjures a magical 
image of gas lamps and hansom cabs, deadly villains and desperate clients, 
and, of course, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. When traveling to Baker 
Street, most pilgrims take the Underground (the London subway), arriving at 
the Baker Street Tube station.
The station is located at the intersection of Baker Street and Marylebone 
Road and is one of the original stations of the Underground system. It was 
built in 1863, back when the Underground was known as the Metropolitan 
Railway.
Upon arrival, you’ll see that the station embraces its association with 
Sherlock Holmes. The walls of the platforms are decorated with ceramic tile 
images of the Great Detective’s profile (see Figure 17-1).

When you exit the station, you’ll notice the large statue of Holmes, 
commemorating the station’s famous neighbor. A few doors east of the 
station, on Marylebone Road, is Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, which 
has an exhibit featuring Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes.
The Sherlock Holmes Museum, 
221b Baker Street
 
If you visit only one place in your Sherlock Holmes quest, it has to be the most 
famous Sherlockian address — 221b Baker Street, London, England.
Despite the amount of time that has passed since the Great Detective lived 
there (fictional or not, he seems real to his fans), the rooms where he and 
Watson spent so much time together have been meticulously kept by the 
careful — one might even say worshipful — curators of the Sherlock Holmes 
Museum (see Figure 17-2). The location was actually a boardinghouse back 
when Holmes and Watson were busy solving crimes, and it was acquired by 
the Sherlock Holmes International Society, which took a lot of care to make it 
seem real.

305
 Chapter 17: Ten Sherlockian Places to Visit
 
And it does seem real. Here, you can step back in time to that wonderful era 
when anxious supplicants were escorted by Mrs. Hudson up the 17 steps (yes, 
there really are 17, just like in the stories) to appeal for help from the world’s 
first consulting detective. You can see the acid-stained table where Holmes 
pursued his chemical experiments, marvel at the odd souvenirs of his life that 
line the walls and shelves, and get a real sense of what Holmes’s Victorian 
living quarters were like — from the size of the rooms to the floor plan and 
layout. It’s as if Holmes and Watson had just stepped out on a case before you 
arrived.
And after you’ve toured the rooms, the ground floor gift shop will satisfy 
your need for Sherlockian souvenirs!
 
The museum is open from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily except Christmas. 
Admission is £6 for adults and £4 for children under 16 (roughly $8.58 and 
$5.72 at the time of publication). If you can’t make it in person, you can see a 
video tour by going to www.sherlock-holmes.co.uk/video.html.
 
Technically, the museum’s address, by modern numbering standards, should 
be 239 Baker Street, but the government allows it to use the real number out 
of respect for its most famous resident.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
The Strand
Next to Baker Street, the street most associated with Sherlock Holmes is 
the Strand, running from Trafalgar Square east for three-quarters of a mile, 
where it intersects with Fleet Street. This famous street is mentioned in 8 of 
the 60 stories. For instance, in A Study in Scarlet, Watson says that, when he 
returned to London after being discharged from the army, he lived for a while 
in a hotel in the Strand. Henry Baskerville purchased new boots in a shoe 
shop in the Strand. Simpson’s, Sherlock Holmes’s favorite restaurant, is still 
in business, located in the Strand. And in “The Resident Patient,” Holmes and 
Watson take a stroll through London, watching the ebb and flow of life as it 
moves through the Strand. Obviously, this area was a favorite of Holmes’s.
And of course, the Holmes stories were published in The Strand Magazine, 
whose offices were just one block off the Strand on Burleigh Street. An 
illustration of the famous street, showing St. Mary le Strand Church in the 
distance, was on the magazine’s cover. To walk down the Strand today is, for 
the Sherlockian, like walking into the cover of The Strand Magazine itself, so 
similar is the streetscape (see Figure 17-3).

The Lyceum Theatre
On Wellington Street, near the Strand, is the Lyceum Theatre, a location with 
strong Sherlockian associations. It’s here that Holmes, Watson, and Mary 
Morstan had their fateful rendezvous with Thaddeus Sholto in The Sign of the 
Four. Sholto instructed Miss Morstan to “be at the third pillar from the left 
outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o’clock. If you are distrustful 
bring two friends.” She was distrustful, and therefore, she brought Holmes 
and Watson. The third pillar from the left is still there, as is the theater itself.
The Lyceum (see Figure 17-4) is also famous for having been the venue of 
William Gillette’s play, Sherlock Holmes, during its run in London. The theater 
is still a working venue, so if you’re visiting London you can take in a show at 
this famous location.

The Sherlock Holmes Pub
Located at 10-11 Northumberland Street, the Sherlock Holmes Pub is a 
mandatory pilgrimage site for all Sherlockians. Back in Holmes’s day, it 
was known as the Northumberland Arms and was the hotel that Sir Henry 
Baskerville stayed in while in London. It was here that his boot was stolen, 
and Holmes himself visited Sir Henry here while investigating the case. This 
hotel is also where Holmes tracked down the mysterious stranger from the 
short story “The Noble Bachelors.” It’s a true Sherlockian landmark, but its 
history doesn’t end there.
In 1957, the Sherlock Holmes exhibit from the Festival of Britain was installed 
on the second floor of the building, and the name was changed to the 
Sherlock Holmes Pub. (See Chapter 15 for more on the Festival of Britain and 
this exhibit.) The entire pub became Sherlockian-themed, with memorabilia 
throughout the ground floor and the world’s first replica of the 221b sitting 
room visible to diners through a large glass window (see Figure 17-5). Stop in 
for lunch and a pint!

While you’re there, step outside and look to the building next door. This is 
the location of Neville’s Turkish Bath (see Figure 17-6), which Holmes and 
Watson patronized at the beginning of “The Illustrious Client.”
 
A Turkish bath is a style of bathing imported from the East. The bather is 
exposed to heat and steam to induce perspiration. This is followed by washing, 
massaging, and drying in a drying room. It was known to leave patrons 
extremely relaxed and seems to have been a favorite experience of both 
Holmes and Watson.

St. Bartholomew’s Hospital
This famous hospital — popularly known as “St. Bart’s” — is another prime 
Sherlockian location (in the Smithfield area of London). When Holmes and 
Watson first met, the Great Detective was studying chemistry there, and the 
doctor naturally assumed that the eager young man performing an experiment 
on human blood was a medical student.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
St. Bart’s (see Figure 17-7) dates all the way back to the 12th century, and 
the fact that Holmes studied there implies that he was the recipient of the 
totality of British biochemical research over long centuries of time.
Although the hospital itself is off-limits to tourists, as it’s still an actual 
working medical facility, researchers have identified a small room that was 
the site of Holmes and Watson’s fateful first meeting. Years ago, a plaque 
commemorating the occasion was installed in the room, but it has now been 
moved to the hospital’s museum.
 
You can visit the museum and see the plaque (see Figure 17-8) Tuesday 
through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., except on holidays (admission is free). 
In the museum, you can see the kinds of medical equipment that Dr. Watson 
would have used in his medical practice and the chemical apparatus that 
Holmes trained on.

The Langham Hotel
One of the grandest hotels of Victorian London is still one of London’s finest. 
Built at a cost of £300,000 (that’s over $31 million in today’s money), the 
Langham (see Figure 17-9) was the most luxurious, modern hotel in the city. 
Its opening ceremony was conducted by the Prince of Wales. It was, indeed, 
fit for a king. That’s why Arthur Conan Doyle had the king of Bohemia reside 
at the Langham during “A Scandal in Bohemia,” and the famous hotel is also 
featured in The Sign of the Four.
Doyle knew the hotel firsthand. It was at the Langham that the author 
attended a famous dinner party hosted by the publisher of Lippincott’s 
Monthly Magazine and was commissioned (along with Oscar Wilde) to write 
for the magazine. Doyle wrote The Sign of the Four, and Wilde wrote The 
Picture of Dorian Gray.

The Criterion Bar
Located in Piccadilly Circus, the Criterion Bar is the fateful place where the 
entire canon got started. Watson says in A Study in Scarlet that “I was stand-
ing at the Criterion Bar, when someone tapped me on the shoulder, and turn-
ing round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at 
Bart’s.” Watson tells his old friend that he’s looking for a roommate to save 
money, and Stamford replies that he knows someone else who is looking for 
a roommate, and he’ll introduce him to Watson. That someone is Sherlock 
Holmes.
 
The Criterion Bar (see Figures 17-10 and 17-11) is still there, and you can go 
inside and have a drink at the bar, just as Watson did so many years ago.

The British Museum
When the young Sherlock Holmes first came to London, determined to 
become a detective, he rented an apartment near one of that city’s great 
centers of knowledge. In “The Musgrave Ritual,” he tells Watson, “I had 
rooms in Montague Street, just round the corner from the British Museum, 
and there I waited, filling in my too abundant leisure time by studying all 
those branches of science which might make me more efficient.”
The British Museum (see Figure 17-12) had been open to the public for 
around a century before England’s most famous sleuth took up his studies 
in its storied halls. Happily, the museum has no general admission charge 
(although some special exhibits do have a fee). Located on Great Russell 
Street, its hours are 10 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Thursday and Friday and 10 a.m. 
to 5:30 p.m. every other day of the week. For more information, see www.
britishmuseum.org/.

After you finish your visit to the museum, head across the street to the 
Museum Tavern (see Figure 17-13). Sherlockian scholars have identified this 
location as the best candidate for the Alpha Inn, the favorite bar of Henry 
Baker of “The Blue Carbuncle.” This spot was where the famous goose with 
the jewel in its crop came from and where Holmes and Watson questioned the 
landlord about his goose club.

Salt Lake City, Utah
When Doyle wrote A Study in Scarlet, the novel that introduced Sherlock 
Holmes, he was relying on secondhand information about the history behind 
the founding of Salt Lake City, the famous Mormon city in the American 
desert. Nonetheless, and despite the 19th-century prejudices that permeate 
that novel, any Sherlockian worth his or her salt should pay a visit to the 
area that inspired Doyle to give Sherlock Holmes to the world.

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
While you’re there, you may want to drop in on the Joseph Smith Memorial 
Building on Main Street and South Temple. Back in Sir Arthur’s day, this was 
the Hotel Utah, where Doyle stayed when he visited on a speaking tour in 
1923. Doyle was invited to speak at the Salt Lake Tabernacle then, and it’s 
another must-see site. The invitation and its acceptance were undertaken in 
the spirit of putting to rest the enmity that A Study in Scarlet had generated in 
Utah.
 
For a real idea of what the Mormon part of the story was like, don’t miss This 
Is The Place Heritage Park at 2601 E. Sunnyside Avenue (see Figure 17-14), 
which re-creates early Mormon settlements dating from the time of A Study 
in Scarlet.

Ten Books Every Sherlockian 
Should Have
In This Chapter
▶ An indispensable journal
▶ The entire canon in one volume
▶ Various reference works on Sherlock Holmes
I
f you’re a die-hard Sherlock Holmes fan, or even if you’re just curious to 
dig a little bit deeper into the world he lived in, this chapter lists some 
books you’ve just got to have in your library. Some of these books are rare, 
older classics of Sherlockiana, and others are more modern.
 
The older books may cost you a fortune at a rare bookshop, but many of the 
old classic titles have been reissued in new editions over the years. I provide 
links to online copies wherever possible to save you both money and trouble.
The Baker Street Journal
Okay, so this first one isn’t a book. Nonetheless, The Baker Street Journal is a 
publication every Sherlockian should have. The Baker Street Journal (or BSJ) 
is the official publication of the Baker Street Irregulars and the premier 
publication of scholarship about Sherlock Holmes. The Baker Street Irregulars 
have been publishing The Baker Street Journal, billed as an “irregular 
quarterly of Sherlockiana,” since 1946. With both serious scholarship and 
articles that play the game that Holmes was real, the Journal is essential 
reading for anyone interested in Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 
and a world where it’s always 1895.
 
The Baker Street Journal is published quarterly, with a bonus Baker Street 
Journal Christmas Annual published in December. A subscription to the BSJ is 
$37.50 in the United States and $47.50 everywhere else in the world. You can 
subscribe by going to this Web site: www.bakerstreetjournal.com/.

The Complete Sherlock Holmes
Although you can pick up copies of the individual Holmes books, such as The 
Adventures of Sherlock Holmes or The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, there’s 
nothing like having the whole shebang all rolled together into one neat 
package. Like the title says, you get every single story that Arthur Conan 
Doyle wrote about the Great Detective in one volume. Originally published 
by Doubleday in 1930 after Doyle’s death, The Complete Sherlock Holmes has 
now been issued in various volumes by a number of publishers. You should 
have no problem getting a copy. The one-volume edition is really handy!
The Sherlock Holmes Reference Library/
The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes
William S. Baring-Gould, who wrote The Annotated Sherlock Holmes in 1967, 
may have been the quintessential Holmes scholar of his time, but new times 
generate new ways of looking at things and new values to explore. Leslie 
Klinger has annotated not one, but two editions of the Sherlock Holmes 
canon.
The first is The Sherlock Holmes Reference Library, a staggering, ten-volume, 
3,000-page set that features over 9,000 annotations, as well as charts, 
illustrations, and appendixes. Aimed at the hard-core Sherlockian, it’s 
the most complete collection of canonical scholarship and commentary 
ever assembled. You can purchase it on the publisher’s Web site: www.
wessexpress.com.
Klinger’s second annotated edition is The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes, 
published in 2004. This 3-book set (with 2 volumes covering the 56 short 
stories and another covering the 4 novels) takes much of the material from 
The Sherlock Holmes Reference Library and refocuses it for a more general 
audience. In doing so, Klinger adds new material on Victorian customs and 
history, providing context and background. Upon publication, The New 
Annotated Sherlock Holmes was an instant classic to a new generation of 
readers and writers, and it has gone on to win several awards.
You can find this more modern look at Holmes and Watson in most retail 
bookstores or online at Amazon.com.

 Chapter 18: Ten Books Every Sherlockian Should Have
The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes
Julian Wolff, the legendary leader of the Baker Street Irregulars, called 
Vincent Starrett’s landmark book, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, 
“the greatest book about Sherlock Holmes that has ever been written!” 
Its publication in 1933 inspired and motivated those kindred spirits to 
come together as the Baker Street Irregulars. As one of the first books of 
Sherlockiana, Private Life encouraged fans of Holmes to indulge in the 
intellectual game of Sherlockian studies. It has remained a beloved favorite 
and cornerstone work in any Holmes collection, and nearly everything 
written about the Great Detective since its publication owes something to it. 
Over the years, several editions have been issued, but most are expensive 
and difficult to find.
 
A magnificent 75th anniversary facsimile edition is now available at 
www.wessexpress.com.
The Baker Street Reader: Cornerstone 
Writings about Sherlock Holmes
This anthology of Sherlockian writing, compiled and edited by Philip A. 
Shreffler, is one of the best collections on the subject ever assembled. It 
covers all the burning topics in the Sherlockian universe — When was 
Holmes born? Where did he go to school? Where is 221b Baker Street? What’s 
up with Watson’s wounds? And what about Sherlock’s cocaine use? — and 
on and on. You’ll be surprised at some of the authors, too, which include 
Edmund Wilson, T. S. Eliot, and other recognizable names.
The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes
This collection of parodies and pastiche published by Ellery Queen is the 
first anthology of its kind.
 
The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes immediately had its own misadventure 
when it was published in 1944: Doyle’s estate (at that time run by his two 
sons, Denis and Adrian Conan Doyle) felt that this book somehow infringed 
upon the rights of the estate, and through a threat of litigation, the estate had 
the publisher pull and suppress the volume. But not before a good number of 
them got out.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Thank goodness they did, because The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes is a 
classic! You’ll pay a premium for a good copy from a used book dealer, but if 
you’re building a cornerstone collection, it’s a must-have.
The Seven-Per-Cent Solution
When Nicholas Meyer’s The Seven-Per-Cent Solution hit the bookstores in 
1974, it exploded as a bestseller and kicked off a Sherlockian golden age that 
lasted for a decade. The book itself spent the better part of the year on The 
New York Times Best Seller List.
The Seven-Per-Cent Solution is a pastiche presented as a recently recovered 
lost manuscript of Dr. John H. Watson. (This gimmick has been imitated by 
pastiche authors so often that it’s now a cliché, but Meyer was the first to 
use it, and in his novel, the idea is still fresh.) The Seven-Per-Cent Solution 
tells of Holmes’s heroic fight to kick his addiction to cocaine by seeking the 
help of Sigmund Freud. Along the way he solves a kidnapping and prevents a 
European war. The book was so popular that it was adapted into a successful 
Hollywood film (see Chapter 14). If you include only one Sherlockian pastiche 
on your bookshelf, make it The Seven-Per-Cent Solution.
The Life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
This official biography by the great mystery author John Dickson Carr is still 
one of the best of the many Doyle biographies. Despite being over 60 years 
old, it’s still an exciting read. Doyle is given a sympathetic treatment by a 
fellow mystery author who provides a fair overview of Sir Arthur’s life, taking 
into account both his foibles and his strengths and making it easy for the 
modern reader to understand Doyle’s drives, obsessions, triumphs, and 
tragedies. Carr’s work traces Doyle’s life from his sometimes turbulent 
childhood through his medical training and into his literary success, and it 
portrays its subject as a many-sided individual shaped by complex forces.

321
 Chapter 18: Ten Books Every Sherlockian Should Have
The Encyclopaedia Sherlockiana
Its full title is The Encyclopaedia Sherlockiana; or, A Universal Dictionary of 
the State of Knowledge of Sherlock Holmes and His Biographer, John H. Watson, 
M.D. Although there have been numerous Sherlockian handbooks and 
encyclopedias, Jack Tracy’s volume takes a unique approach by using the 
idea that the book was written during the Victorian era. Thus, from A to 
Z, all the information between the covers is state-of-the-art circa 1895. For 
those who value the smallest of details in the Holmes stories, this book has 
remained a cornerstone for over 30 years.
Starring Sherlock Holmes
No Sherlockian library is complete without at least one book on the films of 
Sherlock Holmes. In Starring Sherlock Holmes, British cinephile David Stuart 
Davies serves up a big, lavishly illustrated survey of the film and TV portrayals of 
Holmes. Full of interesting nuggets of Sherlockian cinematic trivia, the book 
presents the full sweep of this large subject — from Sherlock Holmes Baffled 
up through the TV series starring Jeremy Brett, and beyond. As much fun to 
look at as it is to read, Starring Sherlock Holmes comes highly recommended.

Ten Notable Quotes and Passages
In This Chapter
▶ A few famous quotes
▶ Several revealing passages
▶ One undying myth
Y
ou could easily fill a book with memorable quotations and passages 
from the Sherlock Holmes stories. I don’t have that much space, though, 
so you’ll have to settle for a handful of the best ones. Some are just so 
Holmesian that they simply can’t be left out, while others give you a revealing 
glimpse inside our good friends Holmes and Watson.
Holmes’s Literary Game
One of the most famous moments in the canon appears in “The Abbey 
Grange,” when Holmes rouses Watson from a sound sleep, crying, “Come, 
Watson, come! The game is afoot. Not a word! Into your clothes and come!”
“The game is afoot” — “game” in this case meaning the hunting of an 
animal — isn’t an original saying by the detective, however. It’s actually 
one of Holmes’s many allusions to Shakespeare. This quote comes from 
Henry V, Act 3, Scene I, when King Henry rouses his troops to battle:
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start. The game’s afoot:
Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
Cry ‘God for Harry, England, and Saint George!’

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The Dog That Didn’t Bark
In one adventure, everyone else is trying to figure out what happened, but 
Holmes solves the mystery by noticing what didn’t happen. In “Silver Blaze,” 
a police inspector asks Holmes, “Is there any other point to which you would 
wish to draw my attention?” Then the following exchange occurs:
“To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”
“The dog did nothing in the night-time.”
“That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.
This is one of the greatest passages in mystery literature, its very brevity 
making it so eminently quotable. As Holmes explains in greater detail 
later on,
“ . . . I had grasped the significance of the silence of the dog, for one true 
inference invariably suggests others. The Simpson incident had shown 
me that a dog was kept in the stables, and yet, though someone had been 
in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the 
two lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was someone whom 
the dog knew well.”
The Impossible and the Improbable
One of Holmes’s basic investigative principles is that you absolutely have to 
face the facts whether you like them or not. He expresses this idea over and 
over again, but his favorite way of putting it is: “When you have eliminated all 
which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be 
the truth.”
That particular phrasing comes from “The Blanched Soldier,” but he said 
the same thing nearly verbatim in “The Beryl Coronet” and in The Sign of 
the Four as well.
 
In the movie Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, the half-human Mr. Spock, 
no slouch himself when it comes to logic, attributes this saying to one of his 
ancestors. This claim of Spock’s is a bit outside the canon because Holmes 
never married nor had children, so it would be impossible for him to be 
anyone’s ancestor, Vulcan or not.

325
 Chapter 19: Ten Notable Quotes and Passages
Keeping an Uncluttered Brain
While most scholars try to cram their heads with as many facts as possible, 
Holmes expresses a different view of the workings of the human mind — 
namely, that unnecessary knowledge (sorry, trivia fans) not only clutters the 
brain but also crowds out more important information. When they first meet 
in A Study in Scarlet, Watson expresses his horror at how ignorant Holmes is 
of the science of astronomy, and the Great Detective replies:
“I consider that a man’s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you 
have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the 
lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which 
might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a 
lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. 
Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into 
his brain attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in 
doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most 
perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls 
and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when 
for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew 
before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts 
elbowing out the useful ones.”
Holmes was just at the beginning of his career at the time he said this and 
seems to have decided to expand his horizons along the way, eventually 
acquiring expertise on such topics as warships of the future and “the causes 
of the obliquity in the ecliptic” (the latter much to Watson’s relief, no doubt).
Proves or Disproves?
You just gotta love Holmes for getting this one right. In The Sign of the 
Four, the Great Detective observes, “I never make exceptions. An exception 
disproves the rule.”
Almost anyone else would have spoken of “the exception that proves the 
rule,” a reversal of meaning whose enduring popularity — despite its obvious 
self-contradiction — is amazing. The Great Detective knew that a rule is only 
a rule if it’s always true.
 
Dr. Gregory House, TV’s modern version of Sherlock Holmes from the show 
House, addresses this issue when one of his subordinates says that “there’s an 
exception to every rule.” He replies, “Actually, there isn’t. That’s what makes it 
a rule.”

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
A Look in the Mirror
Holmes’s self-confident ego is apparent in many cases, a fact that he freely 
acknowledges to his friend Watson. From “The Greek Interpreter”:
“My dear Watson,” said he, “I cannot agree with those who rank modesty 
among the virtues. To the logician all things should be seen exactly as 
they are, and to underestimate one’s self is as much a departure from 
truth as to exaggerate one’s own powers.”
 
Although Holmes is not given to false modesty, he’s rarely the one through 
whom readers discover his remarkable powers of perception. Instead, readers 
normally see Holmes’s greatness through Watson’s eyes. As the narrator of 
most of the tales, one of Watson’s roles is to reveal Holmes’s extraordinary 
abilities in a way that Holmes himself can’t — at least not without sounding 
arrogant and unlikable.
The First Handshake
Holmes sets the pattern for his relationship with Watson the very instant 
they first meet. In A Study in Scarlet, when Stamford, an old acquaintance of 
Watson’s, somewhat hesitantly introduces the two, Holmes asks Watson, 
“How are you?” as they shake hands. He then casually adds, “You have been 
in Afghanistan, I perceive.”
“How on earth did you know that?” I [Watson] asked in astonishment.
“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. . . .
Throughout the stories, Watson asks Holmes essentially the same question — 
how does Holmes know what he knows? — and it’s a question that many 
readers want to know the answer to as well. This setup enables Holmes to 
share his reasoning and reveal the clues that matter to him when solving 
mysteries.
In this case, it’s obvious to Holmes that Watson has been involved in the 
British Army’s recent troubles at the battle of Maiwand, because he perceives 
that Watson is:
“. . . a gentleman of the medical type, but with the air of a military man. 
Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his 
face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are 
fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says 
clearly. His left arm has been injured: He holds it in a stiff and unnatural 
manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen 
much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.”

327
 Chapter 19: Ten Notable Quotes and Passages
The Obvious Facts
Watson often tries to imitate his friend’s amazing knack for seeing what’s 
in front of his eyes. Holmes encourages the good doctor in this pastime. In 
“The Red-Headed League,” Watson’s careful observation of a client doesn’t 
give him much information. In the end, all he can really say is that the man is 
pretty average except that he has bright red hair and looks unhappy.
Holmes takes his turn next, seeming to toy a bit with his friend as he reels 
off a long list of things that are obvious to him, followed by a questionably 
modest disclaimer: “Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done 
manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been 
in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can 
deduce nothing else.”
Knowledge Is My Business
When Holmes meets a distraught man in “The Blue Carbuncle,” he says 
to him, “I think that I could be of assistance to you,” leading to the classic 
exchange:
“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”
“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other 
people don’t know.”
Elementary, My Dear Watson
 
This is the most enduring Holmes quotation, the one that everybody knows. 
The only problem is, Holmes never said it. Well, not in Doyle’s novels, anyway, 
and not in any of his short stories, either.
The Great Detective was rather fond of the word “elementary,” however, and 
this faux signature phrase isn’t really so out of place. Even in the canonical 
stories, you find an occasional scene like this one from “The Crooked Man,” 
in which Holmes has once again amazed Watson with some keen observation:
“I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson,” said he. 
“When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long one you 
use a hansom. As I perceive that your boots, although used, are by no 
means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy enough to 
justify the hansom.”
“Excellent!” I cried.

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
“Elementary,” said he. “It is one of those instances where the reasoner 
can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbour, 
because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of 
the deduction.”
