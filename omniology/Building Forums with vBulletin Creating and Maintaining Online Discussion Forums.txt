Preface 
 
Conventions 
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds  
of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning. 
There are three styles for code. Code words in text are shown as follows: "On most installations 
the database server is located on the same computer as the web server, in which case the address 
should be set to localhost." 
A block of code will be set as follows:  
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache" /> 
 
<!-- end no cache headers --> 
 
<title><phrase 1="$vboptions[bbtitle]">$vbphrase 
[x_powered_by_vbulletin]</phrase></title> 
 
$headinclude 
When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or 
items will be made bold: 
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache" /> 
 
<!-- end no cache headers --> 
 
<title><phrase 1="$vboptions[bbtitle]">$vbphrase 
[x_powered_by_vbulletin]</phrase></title> 
 
$headinclude 
Any command-line input and output is written as follows: 
GRANT ALL ON vb_database.* TO vb_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 
 
New terms and important words are introduced in a bold-type font. Words that you see on the 
screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in our text like this: "clicking the Next 
button moves you to the next screen".  
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this. 
Tips and tricks appear like this.

Introduction to the  
vBulletin Board 
Before we see how to install vBulletin, and how to customize and hack the board, let's take a little 
time to look at the board, the company behind it, and a little of its history. We will also show you 
what other people have accomplished with this most versatile and powerful board. 
What is vBulletin? 
This is a good place to start! 
vBulletin is software that is loaded onto a web server to allow you to create and manage online 
forums or discussion boards. It is designed and developed by Jelsoft Enterprises Limited. 
If you have spent a little time on the Web, you will undoubtedly have come across a variety of 
discussion areas on websites that allow visitors to interact with each other. These discussion areas  
are generally known as 'forums', 'boards', or 'communities', and they are becoming very popular. 
Why Have a Discussion Board? 
But why have a discussion board? Well one good reason is that there is a tendency for a website to 
seem like a one-sided conversation with the webmaster talking to the visitors, but by adding a 
discussion area the webmaster can bring the benefits of two-way discussion to the website and in 
doing so create a community. 
By spending the time, effort, and money needed to give this foundation to a community, the 
webmaster can make visitors to the website feel that they are part of something bigger. As a 
consequence they will visit the site more often, spending more time there, promoting it by word of 
mouth, and sharing links on their own websites, blog entries, and signature lines on other forums. 
Online communities take on a life of their own, and they can bring a whole new level of life and 
energy to an otherwise static, slowly evolving website. 
All of this means the website has an advantage over similar sites that don't have a discussion area. 

Introduction to the vBulletin Board

Benefits of a Discussion Board 
Here are just a few of the advantages of having a discussion forum on your site: 
• 
A relatively quiet forum generates a steady stream of new content on your site—this 
means that people visit your site more regularly in order to read the new content. 
You can find out interests and preferences directly from your website visitors, 
enabling you to target content more specifically to their needs. 
• 
A discussion forum allows people to become more than just passive observers of 
your site. It allows visitors to pose a question, post a comment or share a review. 
When someone posts something, they come back to see whether there's been an 
answer or comment posted in response. This is how a community begins and is a 
path to site growth. 
• 
A discussion board quickly creates a pool of knowledge on your site, especially if 
you have a website that is devoted to a particular subject or topic. 
• 
Due to the diverse nature of discussion forum posts, you end up with a lot on your 
website. This means that you get entries in search engines for a wide variety of 
topics and search criteria, which will very effectively improve your overall ranking. 
• 
Each member on your forum is a pair of eyes—you can sell advertising space on 
popular forums based on good membership levels and revisiting statistics. The 
bigger the forum, the more you can charge! 
• 
A forum is a great way to build a circle of friends with similar interests. 
• 
A forum is a great way to support a commercial product or service—you find that 
other members answer questions for you! It's also a low cost solution, and you 
quickly develop a handy knowledge base of information. 
Why vBulletin? 
Let's be clear from the start—vBulletin does far more than build a discussion area. vBulletin is a 
complete solution to the community needs of website owners. It's a commercial product (as 
opposed to a free product), which perhaps rules it out for the smaller, more low-key websites. 
(Although if they have an eye to future growth, then they might do well in choosing a product that 
will grow with them right from the start.)   
The commercial advantage 
One great feature of vBulletin is the exceptional level of support that the developers 
provide—if you run into trouble, you can expect to receive support in a matter of a few 
hours (sometimes minutes). 
Another big feature of vBulletin is that because of its popularity there are a huge number of 
add-ons and modifications available, some commercial but many available free. This means that 
you need not be stuck with a discussion board that looks, feels, and behaves like all the other 
discussion boards on the Web. 

Chapter 1 
History 
vBulletin has been a success story right from the start.   
The vBulletin discussion board software was developed and marketed by Jelsoft Ltd., a UK-based 
new media company specializing in developing low-cost, high-performance web applications. 
Jelsoft has over six years experience in the online communities business and has been working 
with community-driven websites since the birth of the Internet as we know it today. 
vBulletin is its flagship product—it is a product that has been designed with speed, security, and 
flexibility in mind. Jelsoft's goal with vBulletin was to create a product that would both give the 
site administrators the tools that they need to get the job done, and give the end user effective 
communication and an enjoyable experience. The end users have a variety of tools at their disposal 
that allow them to communicate effectively with others, while administrators and moderators have 
powerful tools that allow them to move, edit, or delete posts, threads, and users, as well as a 
powerful control panel to control the look, feel, and function of the discussion board. 
Development 
In over six years of development a lot has changed in vBulletin, but at the same time a lot has 
stayed the same—speed, flexibility, and security have always been at the core of vBulletin.   
vBulletin was originally developed and built to power the VB-World.net community forums, 
which were some of the world's largest and busiest communities of Microsoft Visual Basic 
programmers. At the time many products were tested, but none could be scaled up to meet the 
demands of these communities, so vBulletin had an instant niche. vBulletin has now attracted a 
large and diverse list of clients from small, special interest sites to big, broad discussion groups. 
Another feature important to the vBulletin developers is stability and performance under load. 
Jelsoft is proud to have been able to test vBulletin under huge loads with over 1000 users taking 
part in discussions on the board at once. With vBulletin the site owner doesn't need worry about 
too many posts slowing the board down, as vBulletin has been tested and proved to run smoothly 
with over 30 million posts held in the database.   
Big boards 
Of course, the bigger the discussion board you have, the more power it will need. Big 
boards will require semi-dedicated or even dedicated servers (don't expect to run a 
popular board on cheap shared hosting), but you can be sure that, if you choose vBulletin, 
no matter how big your forum gets, you will be able to deal with it. 
The vBulletin Advantage 
What are the key benefits from choosing and running vBulletin? Here are the top reasons to base 
your community on vBulletin.

Introduction to the vBulletin Board

Versatile 
vBulletin is designed to be versatile and can be run on a variety of platforms. 
• 
vBulletin is written in PHP, making it fast, efficient, and capable of running on a 
broad range of hosting platforms. Shared hosting provides the cheapest option, while 
semi-dedicated hosting solutions offer more power for a higher price. Fully 
dedicated servers offer the greatest speed, power, and flexibility, but at a 
substantially increased cost.  
• 
vBulletin uses a MySQL database for storing data and settings. Avatars and CSS 
stylesheets (controlling the formatting of the discussion board) can be stored either in 
the database or in the file system. Similarly, attachments can be uploaded and stored 
in either the database or the server file system. 
• 
vBulletin is fully scalable. For the ultimate in power and flexibility the database 
server and the web server can reside on separate computers. 
• 
vBulletin can be run on any system that can support PHP and MySQL (which 
means that you have a wide choice, ranging from Linux and Windows to Solaris, 
BSD, and Macintosh). 
• 
All client-side code is XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant, giving consistent and 
dependable results in almost all modern web browsers. 
• 
The import facility allows data from another forum to be converted into vBulletin 
format. This includes users, posts, avatars and private messages. The import facility 
supports, among others, the following boards: Infopop's Ultimate Bulletin Board, 
Invision, UBBThreads, OpenTopic, ezboard, phpBB, and Ikonboard. 
Performance 
No matter whether you site is big or small, you don't want to be waiting around for things to 
happen. vBulletin is designed with speed in mind, so you and your users, whether on a dial-up 
modem or a broadband connection, won't be stuck waiting for pages to load. 
vBulletin offers: 
• 
Fast page loading 
• 
Responsive interface 
• 
Speedy searches (thanks to effective indexing of the content) 
• 
New/edited posts available instantly—no delays! 
Customizable 
vBulletin is easy and fast to customize. Thanks to a variety of in-built tools the interface can be 
changed with the minimum knowledge of web programming languages. 
vBulletin offers: 
• 
A templated system—all the code for the interface is conveniently stored as separate 
templates. Users can also pick and choose the style they want. 

Chapter 1 
• 
A built-in template editing interface—no need to mess about with text editors and FTP. 
• 
Full access to all the board settings through a custom interface. 
• 
Most built-in text is stored as phrases, which makes customizing or adding 
multi-lingual support easy. 
• 
The ability to create and store multiple styles, which can be applied to different 
forums and users. 
• 
Conditionals are supported in all templates. This allows you to write powerful and 
versatile code. 
Easy to Maintain 
Even the most stable discussion board needs maintenance every so often to keep it running 
properly. Also, since it is the data stored in the discussion board that forms the backbone of the 
community, data backup and restoration is vital.   
Features offered by vBulletin include: 
• 
Built-in database backups, style backup, and table repair functions. 
• 
A Task Scheduler to allow the automated running of many administrative tools. 
• 
Extensive board statistics (numbers of users, new users, new posts, new threads, and 
much more). 
• 
Automatic post pruning to keep database size manageable. 
• 
Extensive server settings and optimization options. 
Other Features 
vBulletin offers a whole host of other features for both the end users and the forum administrators 
and moderators. Over the course of the book we will be looking at a number of them. 
Here are some of the best and most compelling features: 
• 
Private messaging feature 
• 
Comprehensive smilies and avatars 
• 
Separate and feature-rich administrator, moderator, and user control panels 
• 
Printer-friendly versions of threads and posts 
• 
Linear, threaded, and hybrid display views available for threads 
• 
Built-in calendar 
• 
Comprehensive permission system, based on user, usergroup, or forums 
• 
Moderation queues for user registration and posting 
• 
Attachments, complete with preview thumbnails 
• 
Private forums 
• 
User ranking and notes 
•

vBulletin Licensing Options 
vBulletin is a commercial product, and you must therefore buy a license before you can use it. To 
offer site owners the greatest possible flexibility there are two licensing options to choose from: 
• 
Leased license 
• 
Owned license 
Leased License 
Purchasing a leased license will allow you to run vBulletin on your server for one year. During 
this period you will be entitled to technical support and software upgrades. 
After this period you will either need to purchase another license or discontinue using the software. 
Currently a leased license cost $85 a year. At the end of the lease period you can either renew the 
lease for another year or purchase an owned license. 
Second chance 
If you choose a leased license option, you will be given a short opportunity to upgrade 
your license to a fully owned license with no additional financial penalty—you just pay 
the difference in price between the two license types! 
Owned License 
Purchasing an owned license will allow you to run a copy of vBulletin on your server for an 
unlimited amount of time and allows access to all updates released for one year. After the year you 
can purchase a renewal of this access.   
Currently an owned license costs $160, with yearly support and new version download access 
costing $30 for subsequent years.   
Choosing a License 
Choose carefully between the two—making the wrong choice can end up costing you money in 
the long run. 

Chapter 1 
If you want a short-term forum or you want to try vBulletin out for size, then a leased license is 
the way to go. However, three years of running vBulletin at leased license prices costs more than 
an owned license with yearly support and upgrade options would have cost you (and you still 
won't own the software). 
Leased versus owned 
As a general rule, unless you are pretty sure that you aren't going to be running vBulletin 
for a third year, upgrade to a full license at the end of the first year.

Example vBulletin Sites 
By now, if you're not already using vBulletin, you're probably ready to see it in action! If you are 
reading this book because you're looking to be persuaded to purchase vBulletin or you're getting 
ready to buy a copy for a project soon, then in the meantime there are a number of good examples 
of vBulletin discussion boards in action on the Web. Here are a few of the most popular:
• 
http://www.vbulletin.com—Official vBulletin site. The support and discussion 
forums here use, not surprisingly, vBulletin. This site gives you a very good idea of 
what vBulletin looks like pretty much 'out of the box' from the end-user perspective. 
If you want to see and test-drive vBulletin from an administrator's perspective, then 
there is an 'Admin demo' available at http://www.vbulletin.com/admindemo.php. 
• 
http://www.vbulletin.org—This is the main site for information on hacks and 
tweaks for vBulletin. This site is an excellent example of some of the things that it is 
possible to accomplish through modifying and tweaking (collectively known as 
hacking) the vBulletin code. 
• 
http://forums.offtopic.com—This is a massive forum and serves as testament to 
just how big you can make a vBulletin forum. This forum is made up of nearly 2 
million threads, which are made up of well over 30 million posts. As of present it has 
nearly 150,000 members (this is regularly pruned to keep it manageable) and usually 
has over 1000 members on the boards at any one time. This is a truly massive forum! 
• 
http://www.photopost.com—This is a commercial add-on for vBulletin that adds a 
photo gallery to the forum. 
• 
http://www.vbadvanced.com—On this site you will find a free product that adds a 
CMPS (Content Management and Portal System) to vBulletin. This will allow you to 
quickly and easily include different options from your vBulletin discussion board on 
your site's homepage. It also allows you to easily create and manage new pages in 
which you can use settings other than the default.

More vBulletin boards 
If you want to see more vBulletin boards, then use your favorite search engine to search 
for vbulletin—you will find literally thousands of examples! Some will be basic while 
others will be highly customized. 
Summary 
This chapter has been a quick tour outlining some of the benefits of using the vBulletin discussion 
board software as well as providing the background to its development. For the many readers who 
are already making use of vBulletin or who have seen it in action, we have provided a brief 
glimpse of the  hidden power of this widespread and popular software. 
In the next chapter we're going to be shifting our focus to the installation and configuration of vBulletin. 

2 
Installing and Configuring 
vBulletin 
In this chapter we begin at the point where most people begin with vBulletin—with a copy of the 
software and somewhere to upload it to. If you have both of those, then you are probably eager to 
get going with the installation! 
We will look at: 
• 
The requirements of vBulletin 
• 
How to install the files 
• 
How to create the database 
• 
How to troubleshoot installation problems 
• 
How to configure vBulletin 
• 
How to administer the default usergroups 
• 
How to secure vBulletin 
• 
How to get help and support 
Requirements 
The requirements to run vBulletin are pretty straightforward, and even the basic shared hosting 
available nowadays for a few dollars a month should allow you to upload, install, configure, and 
run vBulletin. 
Basic requirements are: 
• 
MySQL database support 
• 
PHP support 
If your host claims to support these, then you have a good chance of being able to run vBulletin. 
Now you need to look in a little more detail at what your host offers. 

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
 
14 
Detailed requirements for vBulletin are: 
• 
PHP 4.0.6 (latest version recommended to reduce security loopholes, improve 
performance, and maintain best compatibility with future upgrades) 
• 
MySQL 3.23.33 minimum (4.0.16 or later recommended) 
• 
Operating system: BSD, Solaris, Linux, Windows 
Disk Space 
Disk space is an important consideration. By 'disk space' I mean the amount of space you are 
given on the server to host your site and the associated databases. 
Disk space is a requirement that is harder to predict. Initially, you will be able to get away with a 
small amount of space, say 50 Mb. However, over time, the posts in your forum will add 
significantly to this. All you can do is estimate how busy your forum will be and judge how much 
space you need from that. 
For example, if you think that your forum will generate about 100 posts a day, then that's 36,500 
posts a year. On average, this number of posts will take up about 75 Mb of room. If you think that 
your discussion board will generate 200 posts a day, then you'll need at least 150 Mb of space. 400 
posts a day means 146,000 posts a year and an approximate disk consumption of around 300 Mb.   
Points to note about disk space 
Remember that these figures are average figures. If your site regularly has large posts (in 
terms of text content) or users are able to attach a lot of attachments to posts, then these 
figures could rise significantly. 
Another point to note is that posts are stored in the database. Different hosts handle disk 
space versus database space differently, so make sure you know in advance how much 
disk space and database space you have. 
Bandwidth 
Bandwidth is the amount of data transfer that your site has. Each time a page is called up by  
a browser, data extracted from a database or an image retrieved, this adds to your site's 
bandwidth usage.   
For convenience, almost all hosts measure bandwidth over a period of a month in megabytes or 
gigabytes, so one hosting plan might give you 100 Mb of monthly bandwidth while another might 
give you 50 Gb. The more bandwidth you have, the more you usually pay and the more room your 
site has to expand. 
Judging how much bandwidth a discussion board will need is tricky for a number of reasons. Yes, 
it depends on the number of users and the number of posts made, but it also depends on other, 
harder-to-measure factors. These include: 

Chapter 2 
• 
How often posts are read. (Remember, a post can be read once or many times by the 
same person.)   
• 
How often a post is re-read. (Re-reading a post contributes to the bandwidth used.) 
• 
How many posts are displayed on a page.   
• 
How many graphics are on the site.   
• 
How often people carry out searches. 
Even a small a forum can generate a lot of activity and therefore consume a lot of bandwidth. 
Shop around and you'll find some good deals.   
As a general rule, it's probably better that you don't go for any plan that offers you less that 20 Gb 
a month. If you go over your allocated bandwidth, you'll end up paying over the odds for 
additional bandwidth, so it pays to have more than you need.   
Many hosts also allow you to roll over unused bandwidth, which means that what you don't use 
this month you have available the next month. 
Flexibility 
Try to find a host that is flexible—you might not know how your forum will develop over 
a year or two, so try to find a host that will allow you to upgrade in mid-contract. 
System Resources 
The bigger your discussion board is, the more system resources it is going to need from the server 
that it is being hosted on. (By big, we mean how busy it is, which can be measured by how many 
people are on it at any one time and how many posts are being made over a period of time.) 
There are three types of hosting solution available to you. 
Shared Hosting 
Shared hosting is sometimes called virtual hosting. 
If your board is small (say under 200 posts a day and about 20 people online simultaneously), then 
you should find that this forum could be run on hosting known as shared hosting, where your 
website lives on a computer with many other websites.   
Shared hosting facts 
On a shared hosting plan you can be sharing the server with over 200 other sites. This 
means that the server power available to you is only a fraction of what the server has to 
offer. If your site is big and busy, then this can affect others on the server.  This is why 
shared hosting is only viable for small discussion boards. 
 
15

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
 
16 
Shared hosting is by far the cheapest option open to you because you share the cost of the server 
with others, but be aware that you get what you pay for. Don't expect a shared server solution that 
costs $100 a year to offer you the same power and flexibility as a hosting solution costing $100 a 
month would offer you. 
Semi-Dedicated Hosting 
One rung up from shared hosting comes semi-dedicated hosting. This is similar to shared 
hosting, but you share the server with fewer other sites. This means that more server power is 
available to you and your site. The more power that you have, the more users can use your site at 
any given time and the faster your site appears to them (although ultimately the speed of their 
Internet connection also plays a big part). 
There are benefits to semi-dedicated hosting—the main one being a lot more power for only a 
little more money—but be careful and make sure that you are clear about what you are getting. 
Find out up-front how many people will be sharing the server and what is the maximum allowed 
on a single semi-dedicated server. A good host will give you this information freely. If they don't, 
look elsewhere. 
Not all semi-dedicated servers were made equal 
It's all in the numbers. Some hosting companies only allow a semi-dedicated server to 
host 4 or 5 sites, while others will allow 20 or more. What you are looking for is the best 
deal based on your budget. 
Dedicated Hosting 
A dedicated hosting solution is where you get a server all to yourself. This gives you the best in 
terms of power and flexibility, but at a price. Remember too that dedicated hosting is a term not a 
standard—a package (or packages) offered by one company is likely to be different from what's on 
offer from another company.   
There are many variables when it comes to dedicated hosting—connection speed, server 
specification, support packages, add-ons. Be careful and shop around for the best deals. 
Get advice! 
If you are unsure about what you want, then you can get good advice, recommendations 
and feedback on good deals on the vBulletin community forums: 
http://www.vbulletin.com/forum
Also, you need to factor in issues like support and downtime. Check out the guarantees offered by 
the host. 

Chapter 2 
Other Options 
There are other options open to you. These include running your own server from your home over 
a leased line and collocation (where you lease space for your own server at the hosting company's 
server location). They are both similar to the dedicated hosting solution outlined above. 
Both these are expensive solutions but allow you the very best in terms of performance and power. 
Choosing a collocation solution normally only makes sense if you want complete data privacy or 
want to handle your technical support and upgrades yourself. 
Again, however, bear in mind that these terms aren't standards and that what one company offers 
you will differ from what another one will be offering. You will need to shop around to get the 
best deals. 
Note of caution 
Leaping straight into an expensive solution is folly—it will probably have far more 
power than most discussion forums will ever need.   
Be careful about unnecessarily lumbering yourself and your community with a lot of 
expensive and ongoing bills to pay! 
Installing vBulletin 
Let's now look at how to install vBulletin. The process is pretty straightforward and installation 
should only take you about an hour the first time you do it. (Once you get used to it, it's an easy 
job, one that you can accomplish in a few minutes.)   
Make sure you have your customer number handy! 
You will need this number to carry out the installation of vBulletin, so make sure you 
have it handy. (You should have been sent this when you purchased vBulletin.) You 
won't be able to proceed with the installation without it. 
Let's begin by looking at the tools you will need to install vBulletin. 
Tools 
There are a few tools that you need to have, but these you should be able to pick up for free. 
• 
Unzip tools: You will need one of these to expand the vBulletin installation files. 
You can choose to download a .zip zipped version or a .tar.gz tarball version of 
the vBulletin installation files. If you choose the zipped archive, you can download 
the Free Zip Wizard from http://www.coffeecup.com. 
 
17

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
• 
Text editor: You will need one of these to make changes to some key vBulletin files. 
Windows WordPad, among others, is ideal for this. Be careful not to use a word 
processor (such as Word or Open Office), because these applications might try to 
reformat the code files and damage them. For power editing of text files (something 
that you will undoubtedly be doing if you plan on making modifications to your 
vBulletin board), we recommend the commercial editor UltraEdit, available from 
http://www.ultraedit.com. 
• 
FTP program: To upload the vBulletin files, we will be using WS-FTP, but there are 
many other good (and free) FTP programs available. A good one is CoffeeCup Free 
FTP available from http://www.coffeecup.com. 
Notepad problems 
Oddly enough, Windows Notepad is not recommended for editing vBulletin files because it 
has difficulties handling line breaks in some files and can cause significant text corruption. 
 
Notepad problems 
 
This is all you need to get started. 
Downloading the Installation Files 
When you purchased vBulletin, you will have received an email giving you details of how to log 
into the member area on the vBulletin website. In this password protected area on the vBulletin 
site you will find your license details along with the latest vBulletin download files. 
 
18 

Chapter 2 
Follow the instructions on the site to download the latest version of vBulletin to your computer. 
File Extraction 
Using a suitable unzip tool, extract these files into a working folder on your system—your desktop 
is convenient for uploading later. For simplicity, we've called the folder vb 3.0.6 because we will 
be installing version 3.5.2 (which, at the time of writing, isn't the latest version, but we will show 
you how to upgrade later). 
Inside this working folder you'll find another folder. The name of this folder follows the following 
convention: 
xxxxxxxx.yyy 
Where xxxxxxxx is your license number for vBulletin and yyy indicates the version number, in 
this case 352. 
Inside this folder are two more folders and a few files (a readme file and license agreements). It 
might sound like we're hammering home the folders here, but you don't want to upload the wrong 
files to the Web! 
 
More folders! 
There's a folder called upload and one called do_not_upload. The files you want to upload are in  
the folder called upload. The other folder contains tools that we don't need to worry about right now. 
Upload Preparation 
If you have chosen what to call the folder that you want to upload vBulletin to, you can rename the 
folder to that name now. 
 
Renaming the upload folder 
Root installation 
If you are planning on installing vBulletin in the root of your website, then you don't need 
to do this—you will only need to upload the contents of the upload folder to the root 
directory of your website. 
 
19

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
The next thing you need to do is to find a file called config.php.new that resides inside the 
includes folder inside the upload folder (the folder we just renamed vb). Rename this file 
config.php. 
 
Renaming config.php.new as config.php 
Before you upload the vBulletin files to the web server, you will need to make some changes to 
the vBulletin configuration file includes/config.php. 
File paths 
From now on we will define the names and locations of vBulletin files relative to the 
vBulletin root folder, so includes/config.php means config.php in the includes folder. 
Open this file up in a text editor. (We are using UltraEdit.)  
If you plan on keeping your installation of vBulletin as close to 'out of the box' as possible and 
don't plan on making many customizations, then editing the config.php file is one of the few 
times where you will need to edit raw PHP code. Don't worry if you are unfamiliar with PHP as 
this file is heavily commented in order to help you fill in the necessary information. 
Of the many settings in this file, only the first few need concern you, and very little of the file 
needs to be edited in order to create a working vBulletin configuration file.  
Creating the Database 
Before you move to this stage, you need either to have a database already created on your web 
server or to create a new one. vBulletin can safely share a database with other software you might 
be running on your server, so if your host only allows you to have one database and you're already 
using that, you're still in luck! 
Two of the easiest ways of creating a database are either via cPanel or using the command-line 
via SSH (Alternatively, you may be able to use Telnet access to your server—but not all hosts 
allow this.)  
 
20 

Chapter 2 
Command-Line Database Creation 
If your web host allows you to have root access to your web server, you can set up a new database 
for vBulletin to use via the MySQL command line. 
1. Begin by logging in to your server via SSH or Telnet as the root user (or some other 
user with permission to control MySQL at the root level). Not all web hosts allow 
this, so check before trying. 
2. Next, you need to start the MySQL command-line utility. This is done by typing the 
following (although the path you use might differ; again, if your host allows you to 
have access like this, then they will be able to provide you with the necessary details): 
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -uroot –p 
 
You will now be asked for the MySQL root password (usually your web server  
logon password). 
3. Once logged in you should see the following prompt: 
mysql>
4. To see the list of databases that already exist, type the following command: 
SHOW DATABASES;
5. If you want to add a new database then the name you give that one must be different 
from all existing databases. 
To create a database called vb_database type the following: 
CREATE DATABASE vb_database 
6. Once you have created the database, you need to create a MySQL user account with 
permission to access the new database. Doing this is a security precaution as you 
should never have PHP scripts communicating to MySQL with root privileges. In 
this example, we will name our new user vb_user and give the account a password 
of password.  Replace those values as appropriate when you type the following: 
GRANT ALL ON vb_database.* TO vb_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 
7. Job done! 
cPanel Database Creation 
The interface you are presented with in cPanel will vary a lot from host to host, so the following 
should only be used as a guide. 
1. First, click on the MySQL Databases icon. 
2. From here you can create a new MySQL database. Here we are creating one called 
vb_database. 
 
Creating a new MySQL database 
 
21

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
3. Next, you need to create a new user for the database and assign a password for them. 
 
Creating a new user 
Prefixes 
Some hosts have configured cPanel and phpMyAdmin to add a prefix to the database 
name and username. 
4. Now you have to add the user to the database so they can have access and control. 
Give the user ALL permission privileges. (Not doing this is a common source of 
errors when installing vBulletin.) 
 
User permissions 
5. Job done! 
Using phpMyAdmin 
For information on using phpMyAdmin consult your web host or visit the phpMyAdmin 
site at http://www.phpmyadmin.net. Different hosts use different methods, but if the 
above methods don't seem to be available, then you can also create new databases 
through phpMyAdmin by accessing the main screen and clicking Create new database, 
and then filling in the name of the database, username, and password text boxes. 
 
22 

Chapter 2 
File Editing 
You can now make the necessary changes to the config.php file. 
The settings that need editing are (add the values into the '' after the equals sumbol on the 
appropriate lines): 
• 
$config['MasterServer']['servername']—This sets the address of your database 
server. On most installations of vBulletin the database server is located on the same 
computer as the web server, in which case the address should be set to localhost. If 
this isn't the case, then you will need to use the address of the database server as 
supplied by your web host. 
• 
$config['MasterServer']['username']—This is the username that was assigned 
to connect to the database on your web server. If you created a database yourself 
using phpMyAdmin, then use the username that you assigned there. Otherwise 
contact your web host. In our example this is vb_user. 
• 
$config['MasterServer']['password']—This is the password that was assigned 
to connect to the database on your web server. In our example this is password. 
• 
$config['Database']['dbname']—This is the name of the database that you want 
vBulletin to use. In our example this is vb_user. 
• 
$config['Database']['technicalemail']—Here you need to enter an email address. 
All database error messages that are generated will be forwarded to this address.   
• 
$config['Database']['tableprefix']—Here you need to enter a prefix for the 
tables that vBulletin will use.    In our example this is vb. 
Uploading the vBulletin Files 
You are now ready to upload the files to the web server. Connect to your web server with your 
FTP program and upload the files and folders. 
Images 
Some of the screenshots that follow show an earlier version of vBulletin (for example, 
it might show 3.0.6 as a version number)—this is purely a cosmetic difference and  can 
be ignored. 
 
23

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
 
 
Uploading the vBulletin files 
Most FTP client applications will handle the file transfers automatically, but if for some reason 
your application does not, you should make a note of the following: 
• 
Transfer all text files in ASCII mode. 
All files containing plain text from the vBulletin installation package should be 
transferred in ASCII mode. 
Text file types you will find in vBulletin are: .html, .php, .js, .xml, and .css.  
• 
Transfer all non-text files in Binary mode 
The remaining files, which are mostly images, should be transferred to your web server  
in Binary mode. 
Binary file types used in vBulletin include: .gif, .png, .jpg, and .ico. 
Upload of the files will take several minutes, even with a fast connection. 
Once all the files are uploaded, you are ready for the next stage of the installation. 
Running the vBulletin Installation Script 
Once all the vBulletin files have been successfully uploaded to your web server, you will need to 
run the vBulletin Installation Script in order to prepare your database to work with vBulletin. 
The Installer runs as a PHP script using your web browser. To start the installation process, open 
your browser and type the http address of your forum's directory, followed by /install/ 
install.php, then hit the Enter key to begin the running of the script. For example, 
http://www.example.com/vb/install/install.php. 
 
24 

Chapter 2 
Before you can continue with the installation, you need to enter your customer number. (You will 
have been provided with this when you purchased vBulletin.)  
 
Running the Installation Script 
After successfully entering your customer number, you are ready to proceed with the installation. 
 
Installation continues 
 
25

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
Step 1 of the installation only verifies that the configuration file is present and readable. 
 
Configuration files OK 
Step 2 connects the script to the database, which ensures that the username and password you 
enter is correct. At this stage you are also given the option to empty the database of any data. Here 
we are installing vBulletin into a database that contains the data for other applications running on 
the server, in which case we want to retain the information. Otherwise we could empty the 
database (but remember that this is one way and unrecoverable unless you have a backup). 
 
Connecting to the database 
 
26 

Chapter 2 
In step 3 vBulletin creates the tables that it requires to function. 
 
Creating database tables 
If you want these tables to be distinguishable from other tables in your database, you can assign 
them a table prefix in the includes/config.php file. In this case we have chosen not to do this to 
keep things 'standard', but  this doesn't conflict with either the Wordpress blog software or phpBB 
discussion board software that we have installed into the same database that vBulletin will be 
using. In fact, vBulletin is quite happy to share a database with other applications and doesn't, as 
some people think, require a database to itself. (However, as the bulletin board gets bigger and 
busier, a dedicated database may become desirable, and you will be able to see to this when the 
need arises.)  
To ensure that you don't have conflicts if you are sharing a database, it isn't a bad idea to assign a 
table prefix. 
 
27

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
 
 
Assigning a database table prefix 
Step 4 makes some necessary table configurations. 
Step 5 inserts default data into the tables. This data is used as the default settings for the vBulletin 
installation. At this stage you don't need to do anything—only click the buttons to proceed from 
one installation screen to the next! 
Step 6 configures the language settings for the discussion forum. 
Step 7 imports the necessary style information into the vBulletin installation. 
 
 
Importing style information 
 
28 

Chapter 2 
Step 8 installs the admin help files for the discussion board. 
Step 9 asks you for some basic information about the discussion board you are setting up—title, name, 
contact details, and so on. If you are only running the one discussion board on your web site, then you 
can also leave the Cookie Path as /. The Cookie Domain settings box allows you to change the scope of 
the cookies on your site—as a rule you can leave this blank. Installation of other cookie-dependent 
software might mean that you have to revisit these settings and make changes later. 
 
Entering basic forum information 
Step 10 confirms that the settings have been successfully stored.  
 
Confirmations that the settings have been successfully saved 
 
29

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
Step 11 asks you to enter the login details of the administrator of the forum. Make a careful note 
of these settings—you don't want to forget them! 
Make sure that the password is a good one too. A poor password will mean that others might be able 
to guess it and gain access to the site. Make sure that the password is at least eight characters long 
and contains both upper and lower case characters and a few numbers thrown in for good measure. 
 
Administrator login details 
Step 12 confirms that the administrator details have been successfully saved. 
 
Confirmation that the administrator details have been saved

Chapter 2 
Step 13 tells you to do something important—and that is to delete the install/install.php file 
from the web server. This is required because others could use it to alter your site or delete the 
data from the database. 
 
Important security advice

Installing and Configuring vBulletin

Troubleshooting 
If you have managed to get this far without problems, then that's great. Chances are that you won't 
have any problems at all because vBulletin has been designed to make installation quick and easy. 
However, it would be unwise to discount the possibility that things could go wrong. 
Here are some of the most commonly occurring problems that you might encounter during the 
installation of vBulletin 
Database Access Issues 
This is the commonest issue that you are likely to encounter and isn't really a vBulletin problem—
it just means that you haven't made all the necessary configuration changes. 
If vBulletin cannot access the database, check the following:  
• 
You are using the correct database username. (Remember that a prefix may have 
been added automatically.) 
• 
The password is correct.  
• 
The database name is correct. (Again, a prefix may have been added automatically to 
the database name.) 
• 
You have granted the database user full privileges for the database. 
If problems still persist, then the problem may be that your FTP client didn't upload the files 
properly (especially the text files, which are uploaded as ASCII). Upload all the files again and try 
to run the installation script again. 
Images/Styling Not Showing 
This is another common problem, and it can make the site look very odd—no graphics will show, 
and the text will be unformatted. 
The problem here is that your web server is sensitive to capitalization but your FTP program 
uploaded the files all lowercase. 
To solve this problem navigate to the cpstyles folder and rename the following folders: 
vbulletin_3_default    ->   vBulletin_3_Default 
vbulletin_3_frontend   ->   vBulletin_3_Frontend 
vbulletin_3_manual     ->   vBulletin_3_Manual 
vbulletin_3_silver     ->   vBulletin_3_Silver 
vbulletin_2_default    ->   vBulletin_2_Default 
PHP Errors 
The most common reason for a PHP error is having white space at the end of a PHP file after the 
closing ?> tag. Check for this in any of the files that you have recently edited and remove it. Then 
resave the file, upload it and try again. 
If the problems continue, then upload all the files again and try to run the installation script once more. 

Chapter 2 
The vBulletin Control Panel 
Now that you have come this far, you are probably eager to access the Control Panel and get started. 
Click on the link on the Step 13 page to access the Control Panel. (You will need to have deleted 
the install/install.php file before being able to continue.)  
After clicking on the link you will then need to enter the username and password you assigned to 
the administrator during the installation of vBulletin. 
 
Logging into the control panel 
Once you log into the Control Panel, you are faced with a lot of information! Don't worry 
though—it is well organized, and you will quickly learn where everything is.

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
 
36 
In the right-hand pane you get information about the version—notice how we are being told that 
there is a newer version of vBulletin available. That's a really handy feature, and later on we'll 
show you how to upgrade the forum software quickly and easily. 
We suggest that you spend some going through the menus and familiarizing yourself with the 
options and settings available—especially if this is your first installation of vBulletin. We will 
pick up the tour of the vBulletin Control Panel in Chapter 3. Now we need to go and look at 
importing data from another discussion board into vBulletin. 
Importing Data into vBulletin 
If you are moving to vBulletin from another type of discussion board, then there is a good chance 
that you won't want to lose all the posts that you already have and start again with nothing. And 
it's not just the posts that are important—what about all your member information—usernames, 
passwords, profile data? You don't want to lose all that and start with a blank forum! 
To make migration easier, the vBulletin development team has created a Import/Export script 
(called the ImpEx script).  
Downloading the ImpEx Script 
The ImpEx script is available from the Member Area on the vBulletin site. This means that you 
need a valid license to be able to download it. 
After downloading the script, you will need to extract the files into a convenient location (just as 
you did with the vBulletin installation files).

The following boards are supported in the ImpEx script: 
•

Preparing for Upload 
When the unzipping progress is complete, you will find that the process has created a new folder 
called xxxxxxxx.impex (where xxxxxxxx is the license number of your vBulletin license). 
Within this folder you will find another folder called upload. This folder contains the ImpEx files 
that need to be uploaded to your web server. 
Editing the Configuration File 
However, you're not ready to upload just yet. First you must make some changes to the ImpEx 
configuration file. This file is located in the impex subfolder of the upload folder and is called 
ImpExConfig.php.new. 
As before, the first thing you must do is rename this file from ImpExConfig.php.new to 
ImpExConfig.php (removing the .new extension). This step is in place to make sure that you 
remember to edit the file! 
To edit the ImpExConfig.php file, you will need to open the file in a text editor such as Windows 
WordPad. (Again, the use of Windows Notepad is not recommended, as Notepad has problems 
displaying line breaks.) 
The settings in this file need to be edited in order to get the script working.   
The settings that require editing are divided into two groups.  
• 
Target database 
• 
Source database 
Target Database Settings 
The target database is the database that will be having data imported into it by the script. 
• 
targetdatabasetype—Enter the type of database here. This is usually mysql. 
• 
targetserver—This sets the address of your database server. On most installations 
the database server is located on the same computer as the web server, in which case 
the address should be set to localhost, otherwise use the address of the database 
server as supplied by your web host. 
• 
targetuser—This contains the username to connect to your target database. 

Chapter 2 
• 
targetpassword—This is the password to connect to the target database. 
• 
targetdatabase—This is the name of the database that contains your vBulletin. 
• 
targettableprefix—If your vBulletin installation uses a prefix on the tables, then 
set this value here. 
Source Database Settings 
The source database is the database that the script will be extracting the data from. 
• 
sourceexists—If the system that is being imported from uses a database, enter the 
details for it here and set sourceexists to TRUE. If the source data is not contained in 
a database, set sourceexists to FALSE.  
• 
sourcedatabasetype—Enter the type of database here. This is usually mysql. 
• 
sourceserver—This sets the address of your database server. On most installations 
the database server is located on the same computer as the web server, in which case 
the address should be set to localhost. Otherwise use the address of the database 
server as supplied by your web host.  
• 
sourceuser—This contains the username to connect to your source database. 
• 
sourcepassword—This is the password to connect to the source database. 
• 
sourcedatabase—Change this value to state the name of the database that contains 
your other forum software data on the database server.  
• 
sourcetableprefix—If the source database uses a prefix for the tables, set that here. 
Upload the ImpEx Script 
When you have finished editing the ImpExConfig.php file, you should save it and you are then 
ready to upload the ImpEx script to your web server.   
Remember only to upload the contents of the upload folder. 
Connect your web server with your FTP program and upload the files and folders. 
As we saw earlier in this chapter, FTP client applications usually handle the file transfers 
automatically, but if this does not happen, then all text files (.html, .php, .js, .xml, and .css) 
will need to be transferred in ASCII mode, and all non-text files (.gif, .png, .jpg, and .ico) will 
need to be transferred in Binary mode.  
Once all the files are uploaded, you are ready for the next stage of the installation. 
Running the ImpEx Script 
From your Admin Control Panel select Import & Maintenance, then Import / Export, and select the 
system you wish to import from the list.   
Version issues 
Note that the ImpEx script has been written for version 3.0.1 and higher of vBulletin. 
 
39

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
The script will then run automatically, and all you need to do is run each module by clicking on 
the appropriate button. Make sure that you work through each module in turn and don't be tempted 
to skip steps or rush things—the ImpEx script can take a lot of time. 
If you receive an error message, make a note of it and carry out a search for it on the vBulletin forum.  
If you cannot find a resolution, contact support—importing data is a complex procedure, but the 
vBulletin support team is likely to be able to help you with any problems that you might have. 
Check usergroups 
After each import, check all options for every usergroup that was imported into vBulletin 
using the ImpEx script, and make sure that all the usergroup permissions are set correctly.   
We will be covering usergroup management in Chapter 5. 
Default Usergroups 
Every member on a vBulletin discussion board must belong to at least one usergroup. These 
usergroups allow you to control who has access to what and later on (Chapter 5) we will be taking 
a closer look at the usergroups. However, vBulletin comes pre-installed with default usergroups, 
which can be used to get the forum up and running quickly. 
There are eight default usergroups: 
 
Default usergroups 
 
40 

Chapter 2 
For the moment you only need to be concerned with three of the usergroups: 
• 
Administrators—These are the users with the most power, and membership should 
usually be restricted to forum owners. Administrators have control over almost all 
features of the discussion board. 
• 
Moderators—These are members with more powers than regular members but less 
than administrators. These are normally the people who look after the forum—
moving posts that are in the wrong place, deleting inappropriate posts. Choose 
trusted people for this role. 
• 
Registered Users—Almost everyone else! These are the people who sign up to 
participate on the forum. 
Banned users! 
Handling banned users is something that we will come to in Chapter 5. 
These are the main vBulletin usergroups, and most members will belong to these (unless you have 
made some significant changes to the way your forum works). 
Securing vBulletin 
vBulletin is a very robust and secure application, but it still needs you to take care of some things 
for it to remain totally secure. 
• 
It is passwords that secure vBulletin—make sure that all your passwords are good 
passwords (eight characters or greater, containing upper- and lowercase characters 
and numbers). Change your passwords every so often (at least 4 times a year). 
• 
Remember too that it's not just forum access that you need to be mindful of—anyone 
who has access to the web server or MySQL also has access to the data the forum 
contains. Make sure that the passwords protecting these are robust, and if you need 
to give someone access (such as support personnel), change them afterwards. 
• 
Make regular backups of your forum data (files and database), and keep these safe 
just in case of a future problem. 
• 
Carry out software upgrades regularly. 
Help & Support 
The installation and initial setup of vBulletin is quite simple and straightforward, thanks mainly to 
the thought put into the software and also the easy–to-follow wizard-style setup interface.   
If, however, you run into serious problems, then your first port of call should be the vBulletin 
community forum—here you will find years of vBulletin information in one place. Chances are 
that a few searches will turn up a solution to your problems. 
 
41

Installing and Configuring vBulletin 
 
42 
If that's not enough, then you can fall back on vBulletin support for help—you will need to fill in a 
trouble ticket and then wait for a response. This is usually fast and you should get an initial 
response in a few hours. 
In order that you receive the best support, make sure you pass on the following information: 
• 
vBulletin version 
• 
PHP and MySQL version (Ask your host if unsure.) 
• 
Exact error message 
• 
Description of what causes the error 
• 
Is the error repeatable? 
The more information you provide, the easier it is for the vBulletin support team to be able to 
quickly and accurately deal with your problems.  
Summary 
We've looked at a lot in this chapter and covered everything you need to know to install and carry 
out the initial configuration of the vBulletin software.   
If you are installing the vBulletin software for the first time, then take your time, especially when 
editing the configuration files. (Keep a backup in case you make a mistake!) It can be annoying to 
get to the installation wizard stage only to find that you made some simple mistakes early on. 
If you are upgrading from another discussion board, then be extra careful and take extra 
precautions—you want to make sure that everything goes back properly and that members can't do 
or see more than they should! 
Also, once you have vBulletin up and running, take time to familiarize yourself with the software. 
A book like this is very useful, but it can only go so far. Work your way through the menus and 
options. Don't feel that you need to make changes—just seeing what's available and getting to 
grips with the defaults can be educational. 
Finally, if things do go wrong, then remember that along with purchasing software you also 
bought support that you can always fall back on if you get stuck or if the worst happens.

A Tour of vBulletin 
In the previous chapter we looked at the vBulletin installation process. This process involved 
downloading the installation files, making edits to the configuration files, creating or preparing a 
database for vBulletin, uploading the installation files, and finally going through the vBulletin 
installation wizard. We also looked at how to import posts and settings from another discussion 
board into vBulletin. 
Now that you have a working vBulletin board, the next thing that you need to do is familiarize 
yourself with it.  That's what we are going to be doing in this chapter. 
We will look at: 
• 
How a vBulletin discussion board is experienced by both unregistered users  
and members 
• 
How a user can become a member by registering 
• 
The administrator's experience of a vBulletin discussion board 
• 
The Administrator Control Panel 
• 
Forum management 
• 
Branding and changing the logo for a discussion board 
The vBulletin User Experience 
Before we look at vBulletin in detail from the perspective of the administrator, let's take a look at 
it from the user perspective. 
In the last chapter we got vBulletin working, and the discussion board that we set up is open and 
ready for visitors. 

A Tour of vBulletin

How to Get to the Board? 
First question that people have is "Where is the board?" The answer to this depends on where it 
was installed. 
If you installed it into the root of your website, then accessing the site is all you need to do. 
So, for example, if your site is at www.example.com and you installed vBulletin into the root 
folder, then just typing http://www.example.com into the browser will take you to it (the main 
'page' of vBulletin is a file called index.php). Similarly, if you typed http://www.example.com/ 
index.php, you would get to the main page of the forum. 
If, on the other hand, you installed the vBulletin software into a folder on the server, then you 
would need to access that folder. We installed it into a folder called vb, so to access this, we would 
use http://www.example.com/vb to get to the main page of the forum (or, if we wanted to type 
more, http://www.example.com/vb/index.php). 
Getting to the AdminCP (Admin Control Panel) requires you to go to a different URL. Using  
the examples above the AdminCP would be at http://www.example.com/admincp or 
http://www.example.com/vb/admincp (again the main 'page' here is index.php). 
There is also a ModCP (Moderator Control Panel). Getting to this requires you to go to yet another 
URL. Using the examples above, the ModCP would be at http://www.example.com/modcp or 
http://www/example.com/vb/modcp (once again the main 'page' here is index.php). 
What the End Users See 
OK, you know where to go, but what do people see? Well, this is what a visitor to your vBulletin 
site sees if they are new and aren't already logged in: 

Chapter 3 
 
 
 
45

A Tour of vBulletin 
Site Logo 
At the top left of the page is the logo for the discussion board. By default this is the vBulletin logo, 
but it is easy to change. (We'll show you how later.) 
 
Forum Title, Login Box, and Navbar 
Below that, you have the forum title and login box. The 
 
Remember Me? box is checked by 
default, and when members log in, their details are saved to a cookie so that they can access the 
site at a later time without logging in again.  
 
Below that, we come to the navigation bar, also known as the navbar. The job of the navbar is to 
put tools and functions within easy reach of the user.  
 
The navbar makes use of expanding and collapsing panes in order to save on precious screen 
space. Clicking on some of the links (marked by a downward pointing arrow) causes the panes to 
open, while moving off them causes them to close. The contents of the navbar changes dependent 
on whether the user is logged in or not. 
Welcome Banner 
Below that, are the forum welcome banner, the introduction to the discussion board and the 
forums themselves. The welcome banner and introductory message are only shown to unregistered 
users (or members who have not logged in). 
Main Body of the Forum 
Below this, comes the main body of the discussion board. This is where the forums appear. To get 
you started, there's one already created. 
 
46 

Chapter 3 
 
 
What's Going On 
Below the discussion forums, is the 
 
What's Going On? box. This give information about the 
discussion board, including the number of members, the number of post, the latest member and 
current board users. 
 
Footer 
Finally, there's the footer of the page, which contains a key to some of the graphics used and the 
current time. Below that, are a small footer menu and the copyright notice.
 
Touring the Main Forum—Unregistered Users 
Even as an unregistered user, you can click on the link to the Main Forum, which then takes you 
from the forum view into the thread view. (This is default behavior—all the permissions can be 
changed, as you will see in Chapter 5.) 
 
47

A Tour of vBulletin 
 
 
There are no threads to show because there have been no posts in the last 30 days. (This is the 
default view—this can be changed too.) In fact, there are no posts at all. 
 
48 

Chapter 3 
No "New Threads" for Unregistered Users 
Notice the New Thread button. If an unregistered user clicks on this, they are taken to a screen 
asking them to log in or register. This screen also contains a password reset option, handy for 
people who have forgotten their passwords. This sends them a new password. 
A word about passwords 
vBulletin doesn't store passwords as plain text in the database. Instead it uses an 
algorithm called MD5 to create a one-way hash of the password, and this is stored 
instead. A one-way hash means that passwords entered can be easily converted into the 
hash but the plain text password can't be recovered from this hash. The password 
password is transformed by the MD5 into 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99, and 
this is stored in the database instead. 
When a member logs in to the forum, the password they enter is converted to the one-
way hash, and this is compared to the hash stored in the database—if the hashes are the 
same, the member is let in, otherwise they are rejected. 
Registering on a vBulletin Board 
Let's now take a look at the registration process for new users. We can begin this process by 
clicking on the register link. Clicking on this link brings up a page outlining the forum rules. There 
are default rules in place, but you can customize these. 
 
 
49

A Tour of vBulletin 
Anyone registering on a vBulletin discussion board has to agree to the rules of the forum by 
checking the box, before clicking on the Register button. These rules are customizable, but a 
generic set of rules is pre-installed. 
The next step is the registration screen. Here you have to enter basic information such as desired 
username (give this some thought—many people end up stuck with a silly username because they 
didn't give it enough thought!), a password (six to eight characters—letters and numbers are best), 
and an email address. 
 
 
50 

Chapter 3 
Clicking on Complete 
 completes the process, and a confirmation page is displayed. 
Registration
Touring the Forum—Members 
A member, also known as a "registered user", will see a number of changes in the way that the 
forum looks and behaves, and they will have a lot more options and customizations open to them. 
New Threads 
To begin with, they can create new threads for others to read by clicking on the New Thread 
button and filling in a short form. 
The main components of the form are: 
• 
Title—the title of the thread 
• 
Message—the main text of the message 
• 
Post Icons—icons that appear next to the post title 
These three fields will need to be filled in before a new thread can be posted.

Finally you click on the

can also use emoticons (also called smilies—those little smiling-face graphics) to add character to 
a post. Also, files can be attached to the posts and made available to other members. 
 
At this stage, you might be thinking that this seems like a lot of power for an ordinary member, 
and you might not be sure that they should have this power. Don't worry—when we look at the 
discussion board from the point of view of the administrator, you will find that you actually have a 
lot of power at your disposal to control what members can and can't do—just because they can do 
something by default, it doesn't mean that you can't take that power away from them later! 
Replying 
Posting a reply is similar to starting a new thread. All you need to do is click on the Post 
Reply button, and you are taken to a short form similar to the one you saw when you created 
the new thread. 
The main difference between posting a new thread and a reply is that a reply does not require  
a new title.

Editing a Message 
Editing a message (say to remove typos or to add something) is an ability that most users will 
want at some point or other. And vBulletin makes this easy. 
All you need to do is click on the Edit button. This loads the current message into a form like the 
one used to post it.   
You then can edit the post, or delete it.   
Controls on editing 
Different user permissions can be set for editing posts, and many forums utilize rules 
where a message cannot be edited after a fixed period of time (a few hours usually). 
There are several good reasons for this. The first is that edited messages don't show up as 
new messages, and this makes it hard for the administrators and moderators to moderate 
comments. Secondly, editing old messages places an additional load on the server 
(because current messages are cached while old ones are not).

Chapter 3 
Private Messages 
Communication is the cornerstone of a good discussion board. One facility that vBulletin offers is 
the ability to send a message to another user without that message appearing on the board. There 
are a number of easy ways to send a private message (also known as a PM) in vBulletin. (We're 
not going to list them all here.) One of the easiest is the following: 
 in the navbar. 
• 
Click on UserCP
 
• 
Click on Send New Message in the Private 
 section of the left-hand menu. 
Messages
 
• 
This brings up the Send New Private 
 page. 
Message
• 
Fill in the form. 
 
• 
Click Submit Message. 
This form is similar to the form used to create new threads and new posts or replies. 
The main components of the form are: 
 
• 
Recipient Username(s)—This is where you enter the username of the recipient (or 
recipients—by default a user can send one message to as many as 5 users 
simultaneously). Make sure that the username is typed in correctly. Entering an 
incorrect username can mean that the message is not delivered or delivered to someone 
else! (An error message is generated if you enter a username that doesn't exist.) 
• 
Title—Here you enter the title of the message. This is similar to the subject line on  
an email. 
This is for the main body of the message. 
• 
Message—
Filling in all three of these is mandatory.   
BB Code  
BB Code
 
 is short for Bulletin Board Code. BB Code is a safe alternative to allowing users to use 
HTML to format their messages. 
So, what is BB Code? BB Code is a set of codes that users can place in their posts. These  
codes are translated by the board when the post is submitted so that they are substituted with 
pre-approved HTML code. 
 
55

A Tour of vBulletin 
 
56 
Why HTML is dangerous 
A long time ago it was decided that allowing everyone the ability to post HTML into a 
web forum was a really bad idea.   
Think about it. Your discussion board is controlled by a combination of HTML, PHP and 
MySQL queries. Giving others the ability to place code into a post could allow them to 
do all sorts of things. Now, most people would probably do no worse than format their 
posts using weird color and font schemes, making them difficult to read. However, you 
want a lot of people to come to your board, and eventually (the Web being what it is) 
there would be someone who would think it was a great idea to use HTML, PHP, or 
script to cause damage to the board. And believe it, they could! 
vBulletin does allow you the option of activating HTML on the discussion board, but this 
is not recommended! 
What Does BB Code Look Like? 
If you've formatted a message for posting onto a vBulletin board, then you will have seen BB 
Code in action. 
Take a look at this short section of text formatted with BB Code: 
[B]Bold[/B] text goes here.   
This is [I]italics[/I].   
This is [U]underlined[/U].   
[LEFT]Left aligned.[/LEFT] 
[CENTER]Centered.[/CENTER] 
[RIGHT]Right aligned.[/RIGHT] 
[INDENT]Indented![/INDENT] 
[list=a] 
[*]Bullet - text 
[/list] [list=1] 
[*]Bullet - numbered 
[/list] 

Chapter 3 
This text looks like this when it is submitted for posting: 
 
BB Code looks a lot like HTML—there are opening tags and closing tags around text. However, 
one key difference is that the tags have square brackets as opposed to the angled brackets in 
HTML. For example: 
 and 
• 
In BB Code, the opening and closing tags for bold are [B]
[/B]. 
• 
In HTML, the opening and closing tags for bold are <B> and </B>. 
Using BB Code  
Using BB Code (especially the in-built codes) is easy because most of the commonly required 
codes are available from the toolbar in the message posting interface. 
 
The AdminCP allows the administrator to add new codes to the forum. However, care is needed to 
ensure that these don't cause security problems. 
User Tools 
The user has a set of tools at their disposal:  
 
—These allow the user to work with the thread. 
• 
Thread Tools
 
 
57

A Tour of vBulletin 
 
58 
• 
Search this 
—This tool allows the user to search the current thread for keywords. 
Thread
 
• 
Rate Thread—This allows the user to rate the thread by giving it a rating from 5-star 
(excellent) to 1-star (terrible). 
 
—This allows the user to change the way they view a thread. 
• 
Display Mode
 
Display Modes 
There are four possible display modes: 
• 
Linear mode (oldest first)—In this mode, the posts are displayed chronologically 
from oldest to newest. Posts are shown in what is known as flat mode so that many 
posts can be viewed at the same time. 

Chapter 3 
• 
Linear mode (newest first)—This is the same as linear mode, except that posts are in 
the opposite order.   
• 
Threaded mode—In this mode, a tree view is shown along with every post in a thread. 
This view allows the reader to see the relationship between the posts, in terms of who 
responded to which post. In this display mode, only one post is shown at a time.  
 
• 
Hybrid mode—This mode is a mixture of the linear and threaded modes. The post 
tree is displayed as in the threaded mode, but multiple posts are displayed 
simultaneously as in the linear modes.

Navbar Changes for Members 
The navbar is also different for the member (or registered user), as it has several significant and 
useful additions. 
The first is a User CP (User Control Panel). After all, moderators and administrators both have 
their own CP, so why not users? In the User CP, the user can change their default settings, 
passwords, and email addresses, they can post signatures (default text that appears at the end of 
their posts) and avatars (images that appear next to their posts), and they can send private 
messages (messages sent to other users) and attachments. 
 
60 

Chapter 3 
 
 
Another useful feature is the 
 
 navbar menu. 
Quick Links
 
 
61

A Tour of vBulletin 
The 
 
Quick Links menu provides the user with links to often-used features of vBulletin. (Many of 
these features can be accessed from within the User CP.)   
The vBulletin Administrator Experience 
What are the differences for an administrator compared to a regular member? Well, there are quite 
a few. We'll take a look at some of the more important ones now. 
Forum and Thread Tools 
The first differences are the forum and thread tools. Forum tools allow the administrator to view 
the posts and attachments that are in the moderator queue. (These are the posts and attachments 
that need to be approved before being made visible.) The administrator tools also allow threads to 
be moved and pruned and allow a moderator to be assigned to the forum. 
 
The thread tools give the administrator the ability to close, move, copy, edit, and delete threads, 
as well as merge threads with other threads, split threads into multiple threads, delete posts,  
and remove redirects. (Redirects are left in place by default when a thread is moved to a 
different location.)  
 
62 

Chapter 3 
 
 
If an administrator clicks on the Edit button of a post, they get the ability to delete a message 
(which makes it unavailable to regular users but visible to moderators and administrators) or to 
remove a message. A reason can also be given for the deletion. Also, an administrator can edit a 
post (again, leaving a reason if they wish). Other options include closing a thread (so that users 
can no longer post to it) and making the thread sticky (so that it stays at the top).

Chapter 3 
 
The AdminCP 
The tools described in the last section are powerful and allow you 
to work with forums and threads, but the real power for the 
administrator of a vBulletin discussion board is in the Administrator 
Control Panel (AdminCP). You've already had a glimpse at this in 
the previous chapter, but now we'll take a closer look at it. 
When you enter the AdminCP, you will find a navigation menu  
on the left-hand side. This expands and collapses as you click on  
the entries. 
 
 
 
65

A Tour of vBulletin 
 
Control Panel Home 
On the right, is a screen called 
 
 
66 
 
Control Panel 
Home, which has some basic information 
about the forum and some useful tools and 
utilities. 
This has four key components. 
Latest Version Information 
First it has a box that tells you whether you are 
running the latest version of vBulletin. If you 
aren't, it gives you a link to the member area, 
where you can download the latest version (if 
you have a valid and up-to-date license). 
Administrator Notes 
Below that, is the 
 
Administrator Notes box, 
where you can type notes. These notes will stay 
there until you delete them and are very handy 
if there is more than one administrator! 
Quick Administrator Links 
Below the 
 
Administrator Notes box is the 
 
Quick
 
Administrator Links box. This makes available a 
set of tools that administrators often need. 
These include a 
 
 
Quick User Finder box that 
allows administrators to see user profiles, a 
quick PHP function, and MySQL language 
lookup search boxes that allow you to search 
for PHP and MySQL terms. Below that is a 
useful set of links. 
vBulletin Contributors and 
Developers 
Finally on the Control Panel Home screen, is a 
list of vBulletin contributors and developers, 
with links to their profiles on the vBulletin site. 
 

Chapter 3 
vBulletin Options 
If you click on vBulletin Options on the left-hand side menu, you will uncover another option, also 
called 
 
. 
vBulletin Options
 
Clicking on this uncovers a powerful array of options. From here, you can choose an option and 
click on 
 
 (Alternatively, just double-click on the option you want.) 
Edit Settings
 
vBulletin Option Tools 
Let's take a look at some of the important options available here (we'll cover other options later): 
• 
Turn 
 
Your vBulletin On 
 
and Off—This allows you to switch the forum off to regular 
users.  Administrators can still access the forums but everyone else is faced with a 
customizable message saying that the forum is off. 
 
This can be a very handy tool—it allows you to work on the discussion board 
without interruptions from users and without your changes being visible to them. 
 
67

• 
Site Name  / URL  
 
/ Contact Details—This allows you to change the forum name and 
URL, the homepage name and URL, contact options, and copyright notices. 

Chapter 3 
 
  
 
69

• 
General Settings—This allows you to control features such as the meta-tag information 
in the page headers. (This information is used by search engines to catalog the site.) 
 

Chapter 3 
 
 
 
 
• 
Server Settings and Optimization Options—You can leave most of these settings 
alone until you have more experience with the board. However, one setting that you 
might want to change sooner is called the *NIX 
 
 
Server Load Limit. vBulletin has 
access to the overall load of the server on certain *NIX setups (including Linux), and 
you can set a value that, if exceeded, results in vBulletin turning away users and 
giving them a 
 
Server Too Busy message.   
If you do not want to use this option, set it to 0. Otherwise a typical level would be 5.00 
for a reasonable warning level.     
If you make use of shared hosting, then setting this level conservatively can limit the 
effect that your board has on the many other users on the server. On a server of your own, 
you can set this limit higher or even remove it altogether. 
 
• 
Forums Home 
 
Page Options—This page controls the many items that you see on the 
forum home page. You can use it to rename the main forum page (index.php by 
default), display user information on the forum (hide the information, display it 
sorted alphabetically, or display it randomly, which take up less processing power), 
display birthdays, and display the calendar, holidays, and upcoming events. 
• 
Forum Listings Display Options—This page contains the settings for how forums and 
sub-forums are displayed on the page. 
• 
Forum Display Options (forumdisplay)—This page has settings related to how posts 
are displayed on the page. You can alter these settings according to how busy your 
forum is and how you want new posts or busy threads to be displayed. 
• 
Thread Display Options (showthread)—This page contains the settings for thread 
display. These settings include how many posts to display and how text should 
be wrapped. 
• 
Search Engine Friendly Archive—vBulletin contains many features that make it 
particularly friendly to search engines. (vBulletin discussion boards get good 
coverage in search engines such as Google and AltaVista.) In this page you can 
control basic settings for the archive.

Paid Subscriptions—This page allows you to set up a paid subscription system for 
your forum. Currently the PayPal, NOCHEX, WorldPay and, Authorize.Net payment 
systems are supported. 
 
Forum Management 
You've seen that any member can create new threads or post replies to threads, but you might be 
wondering how new forums are created within the discussion area? 
Be default, one forum exists. This is called Main Forum, and it has the imaginative description of 
Main Forum 
. This is within a category called 
Description
Main Category, which again has an 
imaginative description: 
 
Main Forum 
. 
Description

Chapter 3 
 
 
These names are of course placeholders, and you are expected to change them (although you do 
see the occasional forum using these names!)   
Editing and Adding Forums 
Once the board is set up, you need to give people a place to go to so that the talking (or typing!) 
can happen. The placeholder forum is there just to show you where the forums appear on the 
page—the developers expect you to create your own! 
To create discussion areas, you have two options open to you: 
• 
Edit existing forums 
• 
Add new forums 
 
You can make these changes in the AdminCP. In the left-hand menu, click on Forums and 
 and then click on 
Moderators
Forum 
. 
Manager
 
Clicking here brings up the Forum Manager screen in the right-hand pane. This screen allows  
you to work with the forums and categories of your discussion board. 
 
75

A Tour of vBulletin 
 
 
The controls here allow you to make a number of changes to the categories and forums displayed. 
You can go straight to viewing the contents of the forum, edit it, delete it, add a child forum (that 
is a forum that appears beneath a forum), add a moderator, and add announcements, as well as 
viewing the permissions. 
 
Editing Existing Forums 
We can edit the main category, and give it a more meaningful name and description by using 
these tools. 
Editing the forum gives the administrator power over six areas.   
Firstly, they can change the name and description of the forum, and give it a more meaningful title 
and description. Another interesting and useful feature is Forum Link. If you enter a URL there, 
anyone clicking the forum link will be redirected to that URL. The Display Order setting controls 
the order forums are displayed in, wherever they are shown (including the Admin CP). If you set 
this to 0, then a forum will not show up anywhere to the end user. It can, however, still be 
accessed if the user types in the direct URL to the forum.   
 
76 

Chapter 3 
Make sure that you click on Update Display Order if you have changed any of them. You also 
have control over the default view age for the threads (although users can change this manually), 
as well as changing the parent forum of the forum (which essentially moves it from one spot to 
another in your board). 
 
Moderation Options 
Below that are the moderator options for the forum. You can set these on a forum-by-forum basis,  
so you have total control over how each forum is moderated and how the content posted is handled. 
There are a number of settings that you can control. You can: 
• 
Enter an email address to be notified when a new thread or post is made 
• 
Require that threads and posts are validated before a post is displayed publicly 
• 
Moderate all attachments before displaying 
• 
Allow members to report posts to moderators and administrators

Forum Styling 
vBulletin has an option that allows you to give the forum a style different from the default. You 
can also let users override your choice of style. 
 
In Chapter 7 you will see how to create new styles for your vBulletin installation that will 
customize the way that it looks. 
Access Control Options 
You may want to control who has access to certain parts of the discussion board. This is easily 
done in vBulletin, as there is an option that allows you to set a password for access to particular 
forums. This is useful for creating private forums or for restricting access to certain members. 
 
78 

Chapter 3 
 
 
Forum Posting Options 
Not all forums are the same. There are a number of settings that come under the section 
Posting 
.   
Options
For example, this section allows you to control whether the forum can be posted to or whether it is 
a category below which other forums will appear.   
You can also control whether the forum is active or not, open or closed, or whether it should  
be searchable. (It can be useful to have some areas not searchable. This improves search speeds 
and reduces the database size, as the search index is stored in the database along with the rest of 
the data.) 
 
Enable/Disable Features 
Finally come the 
 
Enable/Disable Features options. If you are creating or modifying a category, 
then BB 
, 
Code [IMG] 
,

 are not needed. 
Thread Ratings
Note that it is not recommended that you enable HTML code anywhere within your forum.

The options for a forum rather than a category post would include all these options apart from 
 
80 
Allow HTML enabled by default. 
When you have finished making changes, click the Save button to save the changes or Reset to go 
back to the previous options. 
Here is what the forum looks like after a few small modifications. 
 
Branding 
One thing that's important to the growth and success of a forum is branding. For a community to 
grow it needs to have a place that it feels is special and unique to it. vBulletin is a great discussion 
board tool because it is highly customizable, but forum owners can feel a little out of their depth at 
the beginning. Because vBulletin is so customizable, it can seem like there's an awful lot to do! 
However, this doesn't have to be the case. You can start small and build from there. A good place 
to begin to establish your own brand and feel is to have your own logo on your forum! 

Chapter 3 
Changing the Logo 
As we saw earlier in this chapter, the default logo for a vBulletin discussion board is the vBulletin 
logo.  Changing this logo is easy, but you have to know where to find it! First of all, make sure 
that you've uploaded your logo to the web server and that you know the location for it. You will 
need this later! To change the default logo follow these steps.  
First, create or modify a logo suited to your needs. This can be the hardest part as it can be 
difficult to make a logo that fits in with the rest of the color scheme. (In Chapter 7 we will look at 
how to customize the look of the discussion board.) Eventually, you are bound to move away from 
the default look and feel, but for now let's just think about changing the logo—bigger changes can 
come later. 
Go into the AdminCP and click on 
 
Styles & Templates in the menu on the left to expand it. This 
will open a new page in the right-hand window. In this click on the option marked Style 
. 
Manager
 
This will now take you to the style manager screen. At first this screen can appear confusing to 
some, as it crams a lot of power into a small space. For now don't worry about all the options, just 
click the button marked Go, which takes you to All Style Options selected by default in the drop-
down menu. 
 
This will now take you to a screen that is huge and seems even more bewildering at first than the 
style manager page—and that's probably because it is! All Style Options is just that—all the style 
options for vBulletin displayed in one place! We're not even going to attempt to show it in a 
screenshot here as it's massive and contains hundreds of options—all of which you can change! 
Scroll down to a section labeled 
 
Image Paths (you don't need to scroll too far to reach this), and 
there you will find an option marked Title 
. 
Image
 
81

A Tour of vBulletin 
 
 
Once you find this you can change it to point to your logo. Just type the URL in the box (either 
the full URL that begins with http:// or a relative one with respect to the installation folder  
of vBulletin). 
 
Once you've done this, you need to scroll all the way down to the bottom on the screen (a long 
way!) and then click on the button marked Save. You can then view the changes in the forum. 
Undoing the Change 
Now we come to another powerful and immensely useful feature of vBulletin. Let's say you're not 
happy with the change you made and want to go back and either change it to point to another logo 
or perhaps even go back to what it was before. This is a lot easier with vBulletin than with other 
discussion boards. If you now go back to the 
 
82 
All Style Options page and make your way down to 
the section labeled 
 
 you'll find something different about the 
Image Paths
Title Image section. The 
text in the box is now red, and there is a checkbox beside it marked Revert. Also the setting is 
marked as (Customized in this 
. 
Style)
 
This makes finding changes that you have made a lot easier (although the more changes you have 
made the harder it becomes to find the last one!) The Revert checkbox is also handy, because if 
you check this and then save the settings, this option will revert back to what it was originally. 
This should give you the confidence to make changes, certain in the knowledge that, if something 
goes wrong, you can quickly and easily roll specific changes back to the default. 

Chapter 3 
Summary 
In this chapter we've tried to give you a whistle-stop tour of vBulletin from both the end user's 
perspective and the administrator's point of view. By now it's probably clear to you just how big, 
powerful, and customizable vBulletin is. The more you dig, the more options and settings you end 
up finding! Once you get comfortable with using vBulletin, this is great, but in the beginning it 
can make it seem like a huge learning curve. What we've tried to do with this chapter is give you a 
fast track up that learning curve to a base camp at a point where you have a working forum and are 
in a position to begin making a few basic changes to it. 
At this stage we recommend that you take a break from reading and spend some time with your 
vBulletin installation again (a few hours if possible)—work through the options outlined here and get 
a feel for what's on offer and how it's presented by the interface. If you feel confident enough, then 
make some small changes to your installation, and see what implications they have—if you don't like 
them, undo the changes. By having some hands-on time with your forum, you'll gain the confidence 
you need to perform the bigger, more complex tasks we'll be looking at in later chapters.

Customizing Your vBulletin 
Board 
Most of the best discussion boards on the Web have been customized in one way or another. Some 
have only basic customizations to give the place a specific look and feel, while others have been 
heavily modified and customized to look, feel, and work exactly how the owners want them to.   
At this stage you probably want something in the middle—you want a certain level of customization 
but don't want to take on too much too soon, right? That's fine—the great thing about customizing 
vBulletin is that you can start small and keep on adding to it until you get what you want. 
In this chapter we will look at:  
• 
Modifying CSS stylesheets 
• 
Editing the default text on the board 
• 
Modifying templates 
• 
Changing the board's PHP code 
• 
Hacks 
Warning—make sure you have a backup!!! 
Remember that anything you do can have consequences that you might not expect! If you 
make a change to something, then there are things that can (and sometimes will) go wrong. 
Usually just undoing the changes will fix the problem, but this isn't always the case. 
The data is the most important thing on your website, so make sure you take care of it! 
Most web hosts allow you to do this easily though the control panel. 
Also, don't just have a backup—have up-to-date backups. If your site is important, try to 
make a backup at least once a week. If your site is very important, then do it daily, and 
make sure you keep at least the last three backups in case the most recent carries the 
problem you are trying to fix. This way, if something does go wrong, you just reload the 
backup, and you are away again in minutes rather than days. 

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
In the next chapter we will cover in detail how to recover your site from a disaster, but 
for now just be aware that it's a good idea to have a backup of both your website and the 
database—just in case! 
Types of Customization  
By now you're probably well aware of the fact that vBulletin is very versatile, and in keeping  
with this, you won't be surprised to learn that there are several different ways you can customize  
a vBulletin installation. In fact, there are five different types of change you can make.   
These are: 
• 
CSS stylesheets—CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a technology that 
enables web developers to decide how their web pages are displayed. This style 
information is stored in a stylesheet, which controls the way that things look on the 
final page outputted to the browser (and other devices such as printers). 
• 
Phrases—Nearly all the default text strings that are displayed by vBulletin are stored 
in the database as distinct phrases. 
• 
Templates—Templates control the layout and structure of almost every different 
page that vBulletin can show the end user. 
• 
PHP code—You can edit and add to the underlying PHP code of the vBulletin 
installation. 
• 
Hacks—Finally, you can modify the board using a 'hack'. 
Sometimes you will find yourself only needing to make a change in one area. Other times you will 
want to make several changes in order to accomplish what you desire. Either way, the power is 
there for you to use. 
Let's take a look at how to modify your forum using each of these. 
CSS Modifications 
Let's look at how to make a few forum changes. Specifically let's look at how to make the table title 
text bigger and tweak the color a little bit. The original table title is shown in the image below: 
 
Changing the Table Title Text 
Practice makes perfect, and it also gives you the confidence to make bigger changes later, so we 
suggest that you work through this quick exercise with us. (You can easily revert the changes back 
to the default at the end.)

To do this, first enter the vBulletin AdminCP. From here, click on Styles & Templates to expand 
that menu, and then click on Style Manager as shown below: 
 
Now click on the button in the right-hand window marked Go (shown below). This brings up the 
All Style Options page. 
 
This loads up a massive page with a large number of options. Note how all the sections are clearly 
labeled as to what settings they control. At the top you have the settings for the Common 
Templates, including the generic page headers and footers. Below that you have the section that 
controls Sizes and Dimensions of elements within the forum (shown below): 
 
To change the table header, scroll down to the section marked Table Header.  
 
This is the section that controls the CSS settings relating to all the table headers that are marked 
within the code with the CSS selector thead and displayed within the vBulletin forum. The 
appropriate selector is shown at the bottom of the relevant section as overleaf. 
 
87

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
 
 
In the code of the page a selector is shown as follows: 
<tr><td class="thead">Quick Links</td></tr> Any table header containing this CSS selector 
will be affected by the changes we are going to make. 
OK, we are going to change the font size and tweak the color a little. This is controlled by the 
settings stored in the Standard CSS Attributes section.   
Settings available for change here are: 
• 
Background 
• 
Font Color 
• 
Font Style 
• 
Font Size 
• 
Font Family 
 
To tweak the font size, just change the value in the textbox labeled Font Size. Don't remove the px 
at the end, as this refers to the unit of size (px is short for pixel). To make the text bigger enter a 
bigger number; to make the text smaller, enter a smaller number. In the screenshot below we have 
changed this to 16px. 
 
Let's also tweak the color a little. The colors are entered as hexadecimal RGB values with FFFFFF 
being white and 000000 being black. The font color is currently set to white. Notice how these 
values are prefixed by the hash character #. 
 
88 

Chapter 4 
Hexadecimal color primer 
Once you know how hexadecimal colors work, it becomes a lot easier. White is represented 
as FFFFFF, but this is in turn a shorthand way of representing how much red, green, and 
blue are in the final color. Values range from 00 (hexadecimal for 0) to FF (hexadecimal for 
255). The first two hexadecimal numbers represents the amount of red in the color, the third 
and fourth the amount of green, and the final two the amount of blue. Red, green, and blue 
are all set to maximum for white, while they are all at zero for black.   
Red alone would be FF0000, green would be 00FF00, and blue would be represented  
by 0000FF. 
Remember to prefix this with the hash character (#) otherwise things might not work properly.  
Let's change the font to a silver color. This color is represented in hexadecimal as C0C0C0, and so 
what you need is to change the FFFFFF to C0C0C0, remembering to use the # prefix. 
Did you notice? 
The colors used are shown in the color tile next to the setting. This feature can be very 
handy indeed, as it lets you see instantly what you have chosen. Clicking on the color tile 
opens up a color chart so that you can choose the color you want from a range of palettes.  
 
To save the settings that you have changed, scroll down to the bottom of the screen (it's a long 
way down to the bottom!), and click on the button marked Save as shown below. Alternatively, 
click on Reset to revert the settings back to what they were and cancel any changes.

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
Viewing Changes 
Once you save the changes, the All Style Options page will be reloaded. A quick and easy way to 
get back to the forum is to click on the Forum Home Page link at the top of the browser window 
that is at the top of every page in the AdminCP and ModCP. 
 
This takes you to the forum, where you will see the changes you made to the table headers. 
 
These changes aren't just present on the front page. A quick look around will show you 
everywhere that uses the thead CSS selector, such as the example below, which shows the tops of 
posts made in the forum. 
 
Because of this widespread use of specific CSS selectors, you should examine the forum 
thoroughly after making changes to ensure that only the changes you want appear. When we look 
at making changes to the templates themselves, you will see how you can control this and make 
much more specific changes to the way the forum looks. 
 
90 

Chapter 4 
Undoing the Changes 
If you scroll down to the location where you made the changes in the All Style Options page, you 
will notice that the attributes you changed are highlighted in red as shown below: 
 
This allows you to find the changes easily so that you can re-tweak the settings you made. If, 
however, you don't like the changes and want to reverse the changes you made to a section, then 
there is a quick way to do this. At the bottom of each section that's been changed, there is a 
checkbox as shown below. 
 
Reversing the changes made to a section is done by checking the box and clicking the Save button 
at the bottom of the page. 
Phrase Modifications 
There is very little built-in text in the forum. By "built-in text" we mean text that is hard-coded 
into pages and can only be changed by making changes to the source files. In fact, almost all the 
text that you see (apart from forum text and titles and such) is stored as phrases, and there is a 
great deal of logic behind separating the code of the forum from the text. 
To begin with, it makes it easy to create language packs for the forum that customize the base 
language of the forum. There are in fact a number of language packs that have been created  
for vBulletin, including French, Spanish, Arabic, and Hebrew. Links to a number of these  
can be found on the official vBulletin site at http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/ 
showthread.php?t=99151. 
Another major advantage is that, in order to make a change to the text in the forum, an 
administrator does not need to change critical files containing PHP code, where a single error 
could bring down the forum. It is far safer and easier to have the text separated from the code (just 
as the code is separated from the CSS styling information as we saw above). 
Making changes to phrases is easy—there's an interface that handles the searching for the right 
phrase to change, making the change, and also reverting any changes back to the original phrase. 
 
91

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
Let's examine how to make changes to phrases by looking at how to change the forum rules page 
(shown below) that is shown to all new members who sign up for registered status on the forum. 
 
Follow along with us as we show you how to make changes to the forum rules phrase in vBulletin.  
Feel free to make different changes to those we make—it's not the change that you make that's 
important, but the concept. 
Searching for Phrases 
Begin again in the AdminCP, and choose Languages & Phrases in the left-hand menu to expand 
it. From there you can click on Phrase Manager and look for the phrase you want to change, but 
there are a lot of phrases, so you may prefer to search for a phrase using Search in Phrases (shown 
below). As you get more experience with vBulletin, you will eventually get a feel for where 
phrases are, but for now use the search feature. 
 
This will bring up the search interface, which contains a number of options.   
 
92 

Chapter 4 
 
 
This interface gives us the option to search for: 
• 
Text in the phrases 
• 
Variable names (we'll come to these in a moment) 
• 
Text and variable names 
We can now take a small portion of the text from the rules and use this as a search parameter, and 
then click on Find. We will use "Registration to this forum is free" and search for phrase text only 
(detailed in the image below).  
 
vBulletin then searches through all the phrases for the appropriate string and displays all phrases 
that contain it. In this case there is only the one, as you can see in the image below. To aid you in 
spotting the search string, it is underlined and displayed in yellow. 
 
93

Chapter 4 
Search tips 
You might not always find the phrase you are looking for on your first search. The main 
reason for this is that the phrases can contain HTML formatting tags (such as <p> and <p/>) 
which form part of the phrase but you might not notice them otherwise. For example, if we 
had searched for the string "Forum Rules Registration to this forum is free" we wouldn't 
have had a match because the actual HTML is "Forum Rules</strong></p> 
<p>Registration to this forum is free" (as you can see in the image opposite). 
The old saying is as relevant today as ever—if at first you don't succeed, try, try, and 
try again! 
Making Changes 
Now that you've found the phrase that you want, you can go about editing it. To get the ball 
rolling, click on the Edit button that appears next to the phrase. 
 
 
95

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
This will bring up the phrase editing page allowing you to make changes to the text (shown below). 
 
This screen contains a lot of information and features, so let's take a moment to familiarize 
ourselves with the information. 
At the top, is the phrase description and title (shown below). This is a standard phrase (that is, it 
appears in the standard phrase category), and has the title forum_rules_description.   
 
 
96 

Chapter 4 
Below that, is the variable name assigned to the phrase (see below). Here this is 
$vbphrase[forum_rules_description]. Knowing the variable name for a particular phrase is 
really useful, because it allows you to have control over which phrases are displayed. If this is 
placed into a vBulletin template then the text of the phrase will be shown in that location. Don't 
worry if this doesn't make any sense right now—it will shortly! Similarly, if you remove the 
phrase variable from the code, then the text is removed from the displayed page. 
 
Finding phrases 
Navigating the code by phrases can be a good way to work through the vBulletin code. If 
you can find a bit of text in the code, you can then search for the phrase that contains that 
text. Later we'll show you how to search through the templates for phrase variables. 
Below this, appears the existing phrase text, as you can see in the image below. This is there  
as a safeguard so that you know for sure what you are editing as well as the current wording  
of the phrase. 
Below this, comes the box that does the work—this is where we enter new text. This can be 
confusing for newcomers to vBulletin, because the edit box is labeled as Translations. However, 
this is the right way to go about editing the phrases. 
You can also choose to copy the existing text into the edit box by clicking on the Copy Default Text 
button, which means that you don't have to bother retyping it or messing around with cut and paste. 
We just want to make some small changes to the rules, so we'll copy the existing phrase by using 
the Copy Default Text button. The existing text is then placed in the edit box ready for editing as 
shown below: 
 
Let's just make the small change to the text shown in the image below: 
 
We can customize this a little further if you want. Take a look through the text of the phrase, and 
you will find the following lines: 
If you would like to cancel the registration, click <a href="{1}">here</a> 
 
97

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
and  
<p>Although the administrators and moderators of {2} will attempt to 
and 
All messages express the views of the author, and neither the owners of {2}, 
and 
<p>The owners of {2} reserve the right to remove, 
See the instances of {1} and {2} in the phrase. If you take a look at the rules page, you will see 
that {1} corresponds to the URL of the forum, while {2} is the forum name, both of which are 
shown below: 
 
 
Using these variables we can customize the addition we made to the rules. 
<p>The decisions of the admin or moderators of {2} are final!</p> 
 
We're now done making the changes to the phrase, so we click on the button marked Save at  
the bottom. 
Viewing the Changes 
Now view the change. Go to the front page of the forum as an unregistered/unsigned in member 
(clicking on Log Out at the top of the AdminCP screen or on the navbar will allow you to do 
this), and you can start the registration process and take a look at the updated phrase, which is 
shown below: 
 
Undoing Changes 
Be careful when making changes to phrases, as there is no automatic undo or revert feature 
available. The best thing to do is to keep a backup of any of the text that you change in case you 
change your mind and want to go back to the original wording. 
 
98 

Chapter 4 
Recovering phrases 
If you didn't keep a backup of the phrases that you changed, all is not lost. They are all 
stored in the file \install\vbulletin-language.xml. If you search this file, you'll find 
all the phrases that vBulletin uses. 
Template Modifications 
So far we've looked at how to modify CSS stylesheet information, which controls how vBulletin 
looks, and the phrases, which control the text. Both of these modifications allow you to radically 
change how your vBulletin board looks and feels. Template modifications allow you to do a lot 
more and to make much more radical changes to your vBulletin installation. In fact, templates 
control nearly every aspect of a vBulletin board. Each page that the end user sees is the result of 
one or more templates coming together and displaying information.   
Let's take a closer look at templates in vBulletin. 
Templates are powerful yet complicated 
Just a note about templates though, before we go further. Templates are quite 
complicated, and you need a good knowledge of how HTML works to make small 
changes. To make bigger changes you need to have an understanding of how the 
templates work. Work methodically and make notes of the changes you make. That way, 
if something goes wrong, you can undo it. If things go drastically wrong, you can always 
reverse all the changes made. 
Accessing Templates 
To access the templates, first click on Styles & Templates in the left-hand navigation pane to 
expand the menu. From there, click on Style Manager as shown below. 
It's the next stage that many people find confusing—finding the templates! The way to get the 
right-hand frame to display the templates is to click on the 'expand templates' button on the right 
of the screen. It looks like << >> (shown below). 
 
This now displays some of the templates used by vBulletin, some of which are shown below. Most  
of the pages that you see when using a vBulletin board are made up of one or more of these templates. 
(Generally, a page is made of three: a header, a footer, and the main body.)  
 
99

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
Here, templates are grouped. Headings are in blue, and template names are in white. As you will 
see later, edited templates appear in red text to make finding them easier. 
 
To display all the templates, you have to click on another button, again marked << >>, to expand 
all the template groups.

You will now see a full listing of the vBulletin templates available. There are a significant number, 
and they are grouped into 34 categories:

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
Exploring a Template 
Let's take a close-up look at a template. We're going to examine the FORUMHOME template, 
which is the main template that controls the look and operation of the forum homepage. To find 
this template, scroll down the Forum Home Templates section and double-click on FORUMHOME 
to open it. The template opens in vBulletin's template editor as shown below: 
 
In-built template editing 
By now you're probably noticing how little you have to use any external editors when 
working with vBulletin—most features can be edited through vBulletin's own editing 
interface. This saves the administrator a lot of time and effort, as well as reducing the 
time it take to make changes—the changes are done directly to the data on the server, and 
no FTP program is required! 
You might not believe it, but the code shown is the code that underlies the main vBulletin forum 
page that you see when viewing the forum. 
 
102 

Chapter 4 
Template Structure 
Let's take a quick look at the structure of the FORUMHOME template before we go on to make 
some changes to it. 
Right at the top of the template is the beginning of the HTML code for the actual page displayed 
in the browser. 
$stylevar[htmldoctype] 
<html dir="$stylevar[textdirection]" lang="$stylevar[languagecode]"> 
<head> 
 
<!-- no cache headers --> 
 
<meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache" /> 
 
<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="-1" /> 
 
<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache" /> 
 
<!-- end no cache headers --> 
 
<title><phrase 1="$vboptions[bbtitle]">$vbphrase 
[x_powered_by_vbulletin]</phrase></title> 
 
$headinclude 
</head> 
There are a number of vBulletin variables in this small section of code. Variables can be easily 
spotted because they are all prefixed with the $ character. Some of these variables refer to  
phrases that we looked at earlier while others control the running for the forum. For example, 
$vbphrase[x_powered_by_vbulletin] refers to a phrase in vBulletin—this is the phrase that adds 
the—powered by vBulletin to the menu bar of the browser, while the $vboptions[bbtitle] variable 
extracts the forum title from the vBulletin options settings and displays it. Both of these are shown 
below. All the templates follow this format—HTML combined with vBulletin-specific variables. 
 
The other variables, such as $stylevar[htmldoctype] and $stylevar[languagecode], control 
settings outputted to the HTML header, shown below:   
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> 
<html dir="ltr" lang="en"> 
<head> 
  <!-- no cache headers --> 
  <meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache" /> 
..<meta http-equiv="Expires" content="-1" /> 
..<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache" /> 
..<!-- end no cache headers --> 
..<title>The Example Forums Forum - powered by vBulletin</title> 
..<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1" /> 
<meta name="generator" content="vBulletin 3.5.2" /> 
<meta name="keywords"  
  content="vbulletin,forum,bbs,discussion,jelsoft,bulletinboard" /> 
<meta name="description" content="This is a discussion forum powered by  
vBulletin. To find out about vBulletin, go to http://www.vbulletin.com/ ." /> 
These settings are stored and edited through the vBulletin Style Manager.  
Further along in the code, you will find other variables, and you might be able to guess at what 
some of them do—for example, $navbar. The code that controls the display of the navbar is stored 
in a separate template, which is inserted into the main page. This allows different parts of the 
forum to be stored (and edited) separately. Because the navbar is used extensively in vBulletin 
discussion boards, it makes sense to store that code in one place—this results in less code overall  
 103

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
 
104 
and also means that, if you want to make a change to the navbar, you need do so only once. So, 
when the FORUMHOME template is used to display the front page of the forum, all the variables 
are processed at the server, and the final page outputted to the browser for display. 
Similarities to PHP and ASP includes 
If you are used to using PHP or ASP, you will more than likely be familiar with the concept 
of includes—this is where one section of code is inserted into another so that they are 
combined server-side before being displayed. This is exactly what is happening here. 
If you carry on looking at this template (or any other template), you will see a combination of HTML 
and variables coming together to create a forum page. Sometimes the relationship between the two is 
clear, other times it's not so clear, and you might need to experiment with the code before figuring it 
out. (We will get a clearer understanding of working with templates in Chapter 8.)  
Adding a FORUMHOME Sidebar 
Now you've had a chance to get acquainted with the FORUMHOME template, let's look at how we 
can make changes to it, by adding a sidebar to the forum. A sidebar is a place where you can add 
your own content to be displayed on the front page of your forum. This is a change that vBulletin 
administrators often want to make because it gives them a place to make specific additions to the 
forum, such as important announcements, links, or advertisements. 
Making changes to templates generally requires you to have at least a basic understanding of 
HTML. The more HTML you know, the more easily you will be able to make changes and 
customizations to your forum. 
All the changes here are going to be to the FORUMHOME template, but don't worry about 
damaging your forum—if things go wrong, you can always undo the changes later. However, if 
you follow these instructions, then things will be fine. 
Two Changes 
You only need to make two changes to the FORUMHOME template. These two changes involve 
the addition to two sections of HTML code. 
Firstly, scroll down the FORUMHOME template to the section of code shown below: 
<body> 
$header 
$navbar 
 
<!-- main --> 
Between the $navbar variable and the <!-- main --> comment tag, add a couple of hard returns 
to make space for the code you want to add. 
<body> 
$header 
$navbar 
 
<!-- main --> 

Chapter 4 
Now, when you make modifications to a template, you might need to find these changers later in 
order to edit or delete them. If you just add modifications directly to the code, then it's easy for 
them to get lost. We suggest that you add some comment tags and place your changes within 
these. To the comment tags, we usually add a description of the change we're making and the date. 
Also, if we know how many changes we are going to make, we add that information too. These 
comments will also be very useful to you later on when upgrading to a new version of vBulletin 
because it makes your modifications easy to spot. 
<body> 
$header 
$navbar 
 
<!-- Start sidebar code / Jan 06 / change 1 of 2 --> 
 
 
<!-- End sidebar code / Jan 06 / change 1 of 2 --> 
 
<!-- main --> 
Now we can add the code. Here this is the beginning of an HTML table. The table will be 150 
pixels wide. 
<body> 
$header 
$navbar 
 
<!-- Start sidebar code / Apr 05 / change 1 of 2 --> 
<table width="$stylevar[outertablewidth]" border="0" 
cellpadding="$stylevar[cellpadding]" cellspacing="0" align="center"> 
 
<tr> 
 
 
<td width="150" valign="top"> 
 
 
ADD CONTENT HERE 
 
</td> 
 
 
<td valign="top"> 
<!-- End sidebar code / Apr 05 / change 1 of 2 --> 
 
<!-- main --> 
These are all the changes we need to make at the top for now. Now scroll to near the bottom of the 
FORUMHOME template to the point shown below: 
</table> 
<!-- / icons and login code --> 
 
$footer 
</body> 
Now again add a few returns between the <!-- / icons and login code --> comment tag and 
the $footer variable. 
</table> 
<!-- / icons and login code --> 
 
 
 
$footer 
</body> 
 105

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
Next, add the comment tags that will later allow you to find the change you made. 
</table> 
<!-- / icons and login code --> 
<!-- Start sidebar code / Jan 06 / change 2 of 2 --> 
 
<!-- End sidebar code / Jan 06 / change 2 of 2 --> 
 
$footer 
</body> 
Now it's time to add the code. This is simply the HTML code that closes the table we opened above. 
</table> 
<!-- / icons and login code --> 
<!-- Start sidebar code / Jan 06 / change 2 of 2 --> 
 
</td> 
 
 
</tr> 
</table> 
<!-- End sidebar code / Jan 06 / change 2 of 2 --> 
 
$footer 
</body> 
With the final change made, all that is left to do is to save the template by clicking on the Save 
button at the bottom (or Save & Reload, which combines saving the template with reloading it  
into the editor). 
Having done that, you can view the changes you made to the forum in a browser. The result is 
shown below: 
 
 
106 

Chapter 4 
If you were doing this for real, you could now go back to the FORUMHOME template and add the 
content you want to appear in the sidebar. If you return to the Style Manager, you will notice that 
the entry for FORUMHOME is highlighted in red and that beside it appear the details of when the 
change was made and who made it. We've shown this below for the FORUMHOME template that 
we have just modified. 
 
In the image above, you will see two buttons that are very useful once you have templates that 
have been modified. These are the View Original button and the Revert button. Clicking on the 
View Original button allows you to view the original template without any of the modifications 
added. Viewing the original template does not alter the content of the altered template—both are 
stored separately. 
 
 107

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
 
108 
The Revert button does exactly what you'd expect. It reverts the template back to original and 
eliminates any changes made. Use this with care, as there is no undo feature and your changes  
will be lost! 
PHP Code Modifications 
The final kind of modification that can be made to a vBulletin installation is direct modification to 
the underlying PHP code of the forum. There is no direct access to the PHP code from within the 
vBulletin, so all of this has to be done using a text editor and an FTP program to upload the file. 
Words of caution 
Be careful when making changes to the PHP code that lies behind your vBulletin 
forum—it is very easy to damage or destroy your forum if you make incorrect changes. 
Also, if you do have problems, don't expect to receive support, as this is not covered. 
(You will be advised to reload the forum software or fall back to a backup to solve the 
problem.) So take care! 
Be careful when making changes—always make a note of the changes you make and 
keep backups of any files that you alter. 
PayPal Modification 
Let's look at making a very simple PHP modification to a vBulletin forum.   
This modification revolves around the PayPal subscription system that allows paid subscriptions 
to a vBulletin forum. Generally, the PayPal subscription is treated as a non-shipping transaction 
(services only), and the address of the person subscribing isn't transmitted to the administrator 
when a subscription is made. Usually this is fine, but there are times when a forum subscription 
might include a gift or a hard copy magazine or newsletter. A simple modification to the PHP 
code allows PayPal to treat a subscription as a goods transaction and provides the subscriber's 
address to the administrator of the forum. (The subscriber can change this if they want.)  
File Modification 
This modification only involves one file. This is includes\functions_subscriptions.php. To 
begin this modification process, either download a copy of this file from the server using FTP, or 
go to your original installation files and retrieve a copy of it. (Remember to keep an unaltered 
original just in case you want to revert the changes.)  
Open the file in a text editor. (Do not use Notepad, as this can have problems—instead use 
WordPad or another editor such as UltraEdit.) Now, in this file we scroll down to line 381. This is 
the line that we need to change for the modification to work. The change is simple, but effective. 

Chapter 4 
Change this: 
 
 
 
<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"no_shipping\" value=\"1\" /> 
to this: 
 
 
 
<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"no_shipping\" value=\"0\" /> 
All that needs to be done is to change value=\"1\" to value=\"0\". 
Once this is done, save the file. In particular, take care not to add any spaces or carriage returns at 
the end of the file, as these can cause problems. Now upload it into the appropriate folder back on 
the server.   
That's it! Job done! 
Hacks 
So far we've talked about making modifications to a vBulletin installation, and we've looked at 
four different ways to modify the installation. So far we've called the changes 'modifications', but 
the term that you are more likely to see used on the web is 'hacks'. Whenever a board is modified, 
it is said to be hacked (not to be confused with 'hacked' as in the security being compromised by a 
hacker), and modifications are known as hacks as in "hacks to a board". Basically, any change 
that alters the underlying code of the forum is looked upon as a hack. Changing the CSS and style 
settings through the interface is not generally thought of as a hack because these are expected and 
they don't change the underlying functionality of the board. However, making changes to the 
templates and the PHP code is definitely considered to be hacking the board. Making changes to 
the phrases that control the board is considered by many to be hacking too, though some just look 
at this as part of the customization process, similar to changing the stylesheet. 
A hack can be one change or a hack can be many changes. So far we've looked at some very 
simple hacks, but in later chapters we'll go much deeper. However, before we do that, let's look at 
the pros and cons of hacking a board. 
Pros and Cons of Hacking a vBulletin Board 
As with everything in life, there are pros and cons when it comes to hacking a vBulletin board. 
When you are considering a hack, you have to decide whether or not it is worth the potential 
downsides. There are a number of pros to carrying out hacks on your vBulletin installation.   
Below are a few positive points to consider: 
• 
Hacking the board can make your board unique and different from other 
installations, and enable you to personalize your discussion board. 
• 
Hacking can add much-needed functionality. 
Hacking can also remove unwanted functionality. There are, in fact, more cons to hacking than 
pros. However, you have to balance things out—a hack that adds a spellchecker or allows you to 
display advertisements in the forum is quite a powerful pro point. Against these pros you balance 
out the cons.

Typical cons include: 
• 
Hacks can take time to install—this can mean downtime for your members. 
• 
Hacking the code can damage the forum and cause downtime if things go wrong. 
• 
Support for hacked boards can be limited to reinstallation of the software. 
• 
A hacked board is harder to upgrade than a board left in a standard state. 
As a forum administrator, you must balance out these cons against the benefits. However, if you 
take care when carrying out a hack (by, for example, documenting your changes and ensuring you 
have a recent forum backup in case things go wrong), you should be fine. 
Finding a Hack  
So, where does the typical forum administrator find hacks? There are a few options: 
• 
You can develop your own hacks. This is an option for the experienced administrator 
and for people who have been working with vBulletin for some time, but it is not 
recommended for a beginner with no experience of PHP and MySQL. 
• 
You can download hacks. There are a number of forums and websites dedicated to 
vBulletin hacks. The most popular is http://www.vbulletin.org. A search here 
will generally yield a number of hacks. 
• 
You can get a hack made. On many of the vBulletin forums (including 
http://www.vbulletin.org), you can ask for a hack to be made. This might not be 
cheap, and you might have to be specific about what you want, but this is another 
option open to vBulletin administrators. 
Installing a Hack 
Once you have found a hack, you have to install it. However, there's no one single way to install a 
hack. In fact, there is almost as many ways of installing a hack as there are hacks!   
Generally a hack consists of code and installation instructions. Instructions are generally quite 
clear and straight forward following the following format: 
1. Open file xyz.php. 
2. At line xx add the following code: … 
3. Save the file and upload. 
4. Open up template yyy. 
5. Find the following code: … 
6. Add the following code: … 
7. Save the template. 
These instructions are usually detailed, but it is recommended that you work through the 
instructions before making any actual changes to the files—this way, if there are any ambiguities 
in the instructions, you have a chance of spotting them first.   

Chapter 4 
Be on the lookout for problems. If the instructions ask you to find some particular code or 
highlight a line of code that you cannot find, then first make sure that you are looking in the 
correct file. If you still cannot find the code, then there may be a problem somewhere. For 
example, you might have already made changes to that file, or perhaps a later version of vBulletin 
has removed the line referenced in the instructions. Either way, don't make guesses at where the 
code should go, as this could be disastrous. Check for an updated version of the hack, or get in 
touch with the author of the hack. (If you found the hack on a forum, this should be easy.) 
Installing a hack is easier if it contains an install script—you just upload the files to the 
appropriate location on the server (usually specified in the instructions) and then run the install 
script, which will make all the changes for you. When done, you normally delete the installation 
file to prevent it being rerun by some other, unauthorized person. 
Don't be lulled into a false sense of security by a hack that has an installation script—things can 
nonetheless go wrong, so make sure that you have an up-to-date backup of the forum and of the 
database just in case things don't go according to plan. 
After installation, test the hack thoroughly. Since each hack is different, it's impossible to offer 
detailed advice on how to do this, but if you've installed a spellchecker, then test that it works; if 
you've installed a hack that makes moderating easier, then test this. Work methodically, and be on 
the lookout for problems. Don't tolerate error messages—if you see any, find out what the problem 
is. Don't ignore them—they will only get worse! 
Backing Up a Hack  
There are two levels of backup for hacks. 
1. First, if it's a hack you have installed on your forum, keep a copy of the hack and  
the installation instructions in case you ever need to install it again. It's always 
recommended that you check for an updated version of the hack if you have to 
reinstall it, but there are always a few that you end up not being able to find again. 
2. Back up the whole forum using FTP, and keep a copy of the database. This way, you 
have a copy of the installed hack, and if anything goes wrong with your forum, it 
should take you only minutes or hours to recover from (depending on the size of 
your forum and database, and the speed of your Internet connection).   
Commercial Hacks 
So far, I've just mentioned free hacks or hacks specially created for someone. There are also a 
number of commercial hacks available. Sometimes it may be disputed whether they are hacks at 
all, but if they integrate into a vBulletin installation and add features, then they are hacks, albeit 
generally bigger and packing much more functionality. 
Support 
Another element to commercial hacks is support—when you buy software, you normally 
get support, and this can be very useful indeed. You can generally get good support all 
the way from installation to troubleshooting. 
 111

Customizing Your vBulletin Board 
 
112 
There are a number of commercial hacks available for vBulletin—far too many to list them all 
here. However, here are a few of the more popular ones:  
• 
PhotoPost PHP Pro—http://www.photopost.com—photo gallery software 
• 
PhotoPost Classifieds—http://www.photopost.com/class—classified 
advertisement system 
• 
ReviewPost PHP Pro—http://www.reviewpost.com—product review software 
• 
vbAdvanced—http://www.vbadvanced.com—content management system  
(The main content management system software is free, but there are commercial 
add-ons available.) 
• 
VirtuaNews—http://www.virtuanews.com—website creation tool  
(This integrates with vBulletin.) 
Treat commercial hacks in the same way as free hacks:   
• 
Always make a backup of the forum and database before installation. 
• 
Always keep an unedited copy of all the files you update. 
• 
Do a dry run before the actual installation to make sure that the instructions are clear 
and unambiguous before you begin. 
• 
Test the hack thoroughly after installation. 
• 
Keep a backup of the hack.

(http://www.vbulletin.com). 
Summary 
This chapter has been all about making modifications and customizations to your vBulletin 
installation. We've tried to cover a broad range of modifications in this chapter, from simply 
changing a few stylesheet settings to making modifications to the vBulletin templates and PHP files. 
The purpose of this chapter is to show you what's possible—no one is saying you must hack your 
board, and there are many good communities out there that are running on boards that have 
minimal customizations.  However, many administrators do feel that their boards need a certain 
level of customization and modification. 
If you're just starting to set up a vBulletin board, then you probably feel that you have enough to 
do right now, but over time, as you get everything in place and you have more time on your hands, 
you will find your mind wandering to changes that would be useful. This is when you can really 
start to put what you've learned in this chapter to good use!

Administering Your Forum 
There's a lot to do as a forum administrator. It's not just about participating in the discussions, 
facilitating new discussion, and making the tough decisions as to who should be moderated or 
banned. There's a lot to do behind the scenes—the day-to-day care of the forum as well as routine 
maintenance. You will also run into problems from time to time, and then you will need to carry 
out emergency repairs to get your forum going again. 
This chapter is about the most common tasks an administrator performs, some of which will be 
mundane while others will be vital to your forum's survival! 
We will be looking at: 
• 
How to create a forum 
• 
How permissions can be used to restrict access to a forum 
• 
Super administrators 
• 
Some useful changes that can be made to the config.php file 
• 
Backing up, repairing, and optimizing the database 
• 
Some changes to the counters in the database that may be necessary from time to time 
• 
How smilies and avatars can be used to give a human feel to a forum 
Setting Up a Forum 
As administrator you will create several forums within your discussion board so that members can 
find the right place for the topics they want to discuss. For example, you might divide a discussion 
group related to computers into two different forums called Hardware and Software. 
However, these forums may become crowded so that you would find it useful to break down these 
topics into subtopics as follows: 
• 
Hardware—PCs, CPUs, Hard drives, Video adapters, Memory  
• 
Software—Windows, Linux  
Of course, these topics could be subdivided even further. 

Administering Your Forum 
By now, you probably get the picture on how this works. But there's a deeper level that you can take 
this to. First thing's first. A forum doesn't appear from nowhere. It takes planning and preparation.  
Your discussion board will probably have moderators who will take care of moving posts and 
deleting unacceptable comments, as well as hosting discussions within the forums. You might also 
have other administrators. It would be good to have a place where you can come together with 
these other contributors and discuss the running of and future plans for the forum. One solution 
would be to set up a forum for administrators and moderators, and this what we will do.   
Creating the Forum 
Let's walk through the setup process for setting up a specific area on a board for administrators 
and moderators. For this we will continue to use our generic board, because the fewer distractions 
there are, the better—you might want to work through this on your main forum or on a test forum. 
vBulletin test forum 
If you have a valid license for vBulletin, you are entitled to set up an additional test 
forum so that you can test any code, template, and database modifications. To make this 
clear to vBulletin and its license verification system, you should place this installation in 
a directory called testvb and password protect it. This installation must not be accessible 
by the general public. 
We recommend that you take vBulletin up on this. Having a test forum allows you to roll 
out changes there and test their impact on the board without letting members see the 
result. It also allows you a safe way to experiment with the vBulletin source code without 
any risk of bringing down your main active installation. 
Start off by accessing your discussion board's AdminCP. Expand the left-hand menu by clicking 
on 
 
 
114 
Forums & 
, and then click on 
Moderators
Add New Forum.  
This brings up the Forum 
 screen on the right. 
Manager
This is where you can enter all the details for the new forum. We only need to concern ourselves 
with a few of these options:  
• 
Title. Enter the title of the forum here. We will choose something clear and 
descriptive—
 
Admins and 
 
Moderators Only!. 
 
• 
Description. Enter some text to back up the name given to the forum. 
 

Chapter 5 
 
• 
Parent Forum. Set this to No one (the default), as we want it to appear as a top-
level forum. 
 
• 
Forum  
is Active. Set this to No for now, as you don't want it to appear to others until 
you have it set up properly. 
 
• 
Forum  
. Set this to 
is Open
No for now too. Until you've got the forum set up 
properly, you don't want any posts made there. 
 
• 
When all this is done, click on the Save button. 
The forum will be created with the settings you prescribed. 
 
Finally, we'll move the new forum so that it appears at the top of the forum listing. To do this, 
change the display order to 0, and click on Save Display Order. This will move the new forum to 
the top of the list of forums (as you can see from the first screenshot in the next section). 
 115

Administering Your Forum 
You have now set up your forum for administrators and moderators, but there is a potential 
drawback—you would have to discuss your plans in view of the other members. Fortunately, you 
can make this forum private so that only administrators and moderators will have access to it. You 
do this by setting up permissions. 
Forum Permissions 
In vBulletin permissions enable you to set up forums within your discussion board that can be 
used only by the members you want. 
We will now make some changes to the access permissions for the new forum. To begin this 
process, click on the drop-down box next to the 
 
 
116 
Admins and 
 
Moderators Only! link, choose 
View 
, and click on 
Permissions
Go. 
 
This now brings up the Forum 
 
 page.   
Permissions Manager
We are concerned with the section of this page that deals with the forum that we just created.   
 
At the moment everyone has access to this area, but we can change this easily. There are  
two options: 
• 
We can click on Deny All and then specifically allow access to the Administrators and 
 user groups.  
Moderators
 and 
.  
• 
We can deny access specifically to all groups except Administrators
Moderators
It is always safer to deny access to all and then allow in the user groups that you want, so this is 
what we are going to do now. (The other way is prone to leaving out a group by accident.) 

Chapter 5 
To begin the process, click on the Deny All link. 
 
This changes all the usergroup permissions for this forum, denying them all access. The page 
then reloads, and all the usergroups are now displayed in red showing that they have been 
customized manually. 
Yellow alert 
If the names of usergroups appear in yellow, then they are inheriting permissions from a 
parent forum. In the example forum, this would happen if we changed the permissions on 
the Main 
 
Discussion Forum, which is the parent forum of both the Big Boards! and Small 
Boards! forums. 
Right now, no one can access the forum! Let's change that. 
Click on the 
 link next to 
. 
Edit
Administrators
 
The page that is displayed now can be used to customize the forum permissions for administrators. 
 117

Administering Your Forum 
 
 
 
118 

Chapter 5 
The next part is the tricky part, and you need to take care. To reset the permissions to standard 
administrator privileges, you need to set all the options to 
apart from
 
 
 
Yes
Always Moderate This  
 
Group's Posts (unless you want all administrator posts to be moderated by moderators, which  
is unlikely). 
apart
However, clicking the button marked All Yes changes all the options to Yes 
 from 
  
Always
 
Moderate This 
 
Group's Posts. This is a little-known feature, and users of vBulletin are often 
unaware of it.  
 
Scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click on Save. You can now repeat the process for the 
 usergroup. 
Moderators
Viewing Permissions 
We will now look at two features of the Forum Permissions Manager page that will make your life 
a lot easier. 
Firstly, there is the color coding. The name of each usergroup is displayed in one of three different 
colors according to that group's permissions as follows: 
• 
Standard: These are displayed in white. These usergroups have default usergroup 
permissions.  
: These are displayed in red. These usergroups have custom permissions.  
• 
Customized
• 
Inherited: These are displayed in yellow. These usergroups have custom permissions 
inherited from a parent forum. 
But it's not just the colors that help you navigate the forum permissions page. If you take a look to the 
left of the usergroup names, you will see solid dots and open circles in either red, yellow, or white. 
 
 119

Administering Your Forum 
The solid dots represent usergroups who can view the forum in question, while open circles 
represent those who cannot. 
Browser-specific feature 
The solid dots and open circles only apply if you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer 
4+, Netscape 6+ or Firefox browsers. This effect also works in Opera, but the dots are 
much smaller and can be harder to see. 
Opening the Forum 
We have nearly finished. Remember how we initially chose not to set the new forum active and 
open. Well, setting it to open is the final step that we need to take. 
In the 
 
120 
Forum 
 page, scroll down to 
Manager
Posting Options, and change both Forum  
is Active  
and Forum  
 to 
. 
is Open
Yes
 
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on Save. 
The new forum is now visible and available to all members of the administrator and 
moderator usergroups. 
Helping hand 
By now you're probably noticing the question mark icon next to items in the AdminCP 
(and the ModCP). These are the help buttons—clicking on them will bring up help 
screens on the topic they appear next to. 
Super Administrators 
If you own the forum or run the forum, then you are probably a member of the Administrator 
usergroup. But are you a super administrator? Probably not! Want to find out how to set yourself 
up as a super administrator? Read on! 
You need to be a super administrator to have control over other administrators and to change their 
permissions. For example, suppose that you have another administrator who is your 'second in 
command' and that you want to change this administrator's permissions on the forum. To do this  

Chapter 5 
you click on 
 in the left-hand menu and then click on 
 
Usergroups
Administrator Permissions. 
However, you come up against a message telling you that you don't have permission. 
 
This message also tells you how to make the changes that will enable you to carry out this action. 
You do, however, require access to the server to carry out these changes. 
Creating a Super Administrator 
To create a super administrator, you need to make a change to the includes/config.php file. The 
easiest way to edit this file is to download it using FTP and edit it locally. 
 121

Administering Your Forum 
Local edit versus server edit 
Some web hosts might allow you to edit files through a built-in file manager application, 
but this isn't recommended. By downloading the file, you can keep an unchanged copy of 
it in case your edits go wrong. 
Once you have downloaded the config.php file, you can open it. You may remember that you 
edited this file to provide vBulletin with the information needed to connect to the database when 
you first set up the discussion board. 
Scroll down to the section market 
 
122 
****** SUPER ADMINISTRATORS ****** as shown below (line 
number 83). 
 
You need to change this line of code: 
$superadministrators = ''; 
To make an administrator into a super administrator, you add their user ID number inside the single 
quotes. As the holder of the first account in the vBulletin database, your user ID should be 1. 
$superadministrators = '1'; 
If you want to add more than one super administrator, separate each user ID with a comma, like this: 
$superadministrators = '1,2,42'; 

Chapter 5 
Finding the user ID of a member is easy. The AdminCP home page has a feature, called the 
 
Quick
 
, that allows you to look up users' IDs. 
User Finder
 
Type the user name in here, and click 
 
Exact Match. This takes you to the 
 
User Manager page, and 
at the top of this screen, you will find the user ID for that user. 
 
Finally, save the file and upload it back to the server (making sure it overwrites the old file). The 
change is instant, and you can now access the 
 
 page. 
Administrator Permissions
 
Other Changes to the config.php File 
There are several other changes that you can make to the includes/config.php file in addition to 
creating a super administrator. We will look at four of these changes. 
 123

Administering Your Forum 
Admin Log Viewing Permission 
The Admin log keeps track of all the changes and edits that the administrators have carried out. To 
view this, click on 
 
 
124 
Statistics & 
 in the left-hand menu, and then click on 
Logs
Control 
 
.  
Panel Log
 
This gives you access to the Admin log.  
 
By default, only the first administrator account has access to this. (This is the account, with user 
ID 1, that was created during the setup of the vBulletin board.) To give this power to more 
administrators (or take it away), you should make a change to the section of code in the 
includes/config.php file labeled ****** USERS WITH ADMIN LOG VIEWING 
 
PERMISSIONS ******.  

Chapter 5 
 
 
Make the change to this line of code: 
$canviewadminlog = '1'; 
Remember to separate each user ID with a comma. 
Save the file, and upload it to make the changes active. 
Admin Log Pruning Permission 
As well as controlling who can view the Admin log, you can control who can prune it (in other 
words, delete stuff from it). 
Add the user IDs of all Administrators you want to have this power here: 
$canpruneadminlog = '1'; 
User ID 1 is there by default. 
Query Running Permission 
This is a powerful permission that you should grant with care. Giving someone the power to run 
queries allows them to interact with the actual database that holds the vBulletin data. We've not 
looked at this yet and won't until Chapter 9. For now, let's just look at how to give this power to or 
take it away from administrators. 
The line of code you need to edit is this: 
$canrunqueries = ''; 
 125

Administering Your Forum 
Add the user IDs inside the single quotes. Separate multiple user IDs with a comma. 
With great power, comes great responsibility 
Be very careful with this. The ability to run queries is a very powerful tool that we will 
come to later. Running queries can easily damage or destroy your discussion board and 
any other data in the database. For the safety and security of your board, you may want to 
remove all user IDs from this list and allow queries to be run only through phpMyAdmin 
or through a shell. 
Undeletable and Unalterable Users 
You might want your administrators (or other members) to be undeletable and unalterable. (This 
refers to the profile settings.) This setting can be handy, because it prevents you from deleting or 
demoting administrators (including yourself!) by accident. 
The line of code you will need to edit is this: 
$undeletableusers = ''; 
Maintaining the Database 
Without the data, your community is gone. Not only will you lose all the forums that have been set 
up (along with any customizations and changes you made), but you will also lose all the people. 
By this, I mean you will lose all the members—lose the database and their accounts. Usernames, 
passwords, everything will be lost. 
Running a forum without taking care of the database is asking for trouble. Not only might you run 
into problems and difficulties when you make a change to the forum (such as adding new features 
or upgrading vBulletin), but also your data is vulnerable to damage if the server hosting your 
community encounters problems. Small database problems can quickly grow into major issues, 
and the best defense against problems is to keep a backup. 
vBulletin has a lot of features to allow you to protect your precious data from damage, corruptions, and 
loss. These tools can be accessed through the 
 
126 
Import & Maintenance menu on the left of the AdminCP. 
 

Chapter 5 
Backing Up the Database 
vBulletin makes this job quite easy as long as your database isn't too big. How big is too big 
depends on a variety of factors, but if your database is under 250 Mb, you should be able to use 
this feature just fine. 
Back to basics 
For large databases, saving the database via the command line is recommended. This is 
done using the following command: 
shell> mysqldump --tab=/path/to/some/dir --opt db_name 
The backup interface is easy to use. It shows you all the tables that are available in the database 
that contains vBulletin (including non-vBulletin tables). 
You should choose the tables you want to back up (it's probably best to choose all the tables initially) 
and then select at the bottom of the screen the location to save the backup to. This has to be a folder 
on the server that vBulletin can write to, so its chmod permission should be set to 777. 
 
After you have done this, click on Save. The backup will then be carried out. 
You can also back up single database tables into a CSV (comma separated variable) file, which is 
handy if you plan on making changes to the database. 
 127

Administering Your Forum 
 
 
Restoration of this database is carried out through the phpMyAdmin interface. 
Command-line recovery 
Recovery of a database through the command line is a two-step process. First, create a 
database to receive the data. 
$ mysql -h localhost -u XXXXXX -p YYYYYY 
Here 
 
128 
XXXXXX is the username of the database and YYYYYY is the password. 
Then move the data to the new database: 
$ mysql -h localhost -u XXXXXX -p YYYYYY restored < db_name 
Repairing and Optimizing the Database 
Again, this process gives you access to all the tables in the database, not just the tables relating to 
vBulletin. You can choose to repair and optimize some of the tables, or you can repair and 
optimize all the tables.  
At the bottom of the page choose whether you want to optimize the tables, repair the tables, or 
carry out both operations. 
 
When you have selected the required options, click on 
  
Continue.

Chapter 5 
Backup first! 
Make sure that you have an up-to-date backup before carrying out the repair/optimize process. 
 
It is recommended that you run the repair/optimize process twice to make sure all problems are fixed. 
Some Maintenance Issues 
The Update 
 page enables you to change many of the counters in the database.  
Counters
Take your time 
This process can take a lot of time—there is no way to rush it, so it's best to start it and 
leave it to finish on its own. 
These counters are important for the smooth running of the database, but they may require updating 
following a change to the database. These are some of the changes that you may need to make: 
Update
• 
 the forums
 
  
This feature will update the information for each forum including last post 
information, thread count, and post count. This operation can be carried out after a 
mass moving or pruning of threads and posts.  
 129

Administering Your Forum 
 
130 
• 
Update user titles  
This will go through every user on the forums and determine their correct user title.  
• 
Update user names  
This will update user names everywhere they occur on your forums. This operation 
may need to be done after changing a user's name in the AdminCP. 
• 
Update post counts  
This will update the post count for each user by counting how many posts they have  
in the database. If someone has artificially inflated or deflated post counts by editing 
profiles in the AdminCP, then this procedure will reset the post counts to their  
true values. 
• 
Fix broken user profiles  
This will fix any broken user profiles. 
• 
Rebuild forum information  
This will update the forum counters (post counts) and also check for orphan moderators. 
You may need to do this after merging or deleting threads or posts in your forums. 
• 
Rebuild thread information  
This will update the thread counters including last post information, reply count, and 
view count. You may need to do this after moving or pruning threads or posts. 
• 
Rebuild similar threads  
This will search the forums for threads that are similar to each other. To show similar 
threads you need to enable the option in the vBulletin options. If you want your 
forums to search for similar threads when a new thread is posted (rather than having 
to update this counter later), then you need to enable the option on this page. 
• 
Rebuild search index  
This will need to be done after changing the max/min search word length in the 
vBulletin options. 
• 
Rebuild statistics  
This will rebuild the information that is displayed on the vBulletin Statistics page. 
• 
Rebuild post cache  
vBulletin doesn't parse vB code in posts each time they are displayed. Instead the 
parsed posts are saved in the post_parsed table. This reduces the processing time 
needed to display a post. Updating this counter will rebuild the parsed posts. This 
needs to be done after changing vB codes or posting allowances.  
• 
Delete duplicate threads  
Sometimes duplicate threads are created during the posting process. Updating this 
counter will remove those duplicates. 
• 
Rebuild styles  
Updating this counter will rebuild the style structure. 
• 
Rebuild attachment thumbnails  
Rebuilding thumbnails is necessary after changing the thumbnail settings in the 
vBulletin options.

Rebuild user reputation
 
 
  
You will need to update this counter if you change the default reputation value in the 
vBulletin options.

This will delete any threads that belong to forums that no longer exist.

This will delete any posts that belong to threads that no longer exist.  
Smilies 
Because a forum relies on text-based communication, anything that helps someone get their 
message across is a good thing. That's where smilies come in. They are little graphics that have a 
variety of faces displaying different emotions. 
 
Smilies are controlled through the control panel. If you click on Smilies in the left-hand menu, 
then three options will be made available. 
 
Clicking on 
 
Smilie Manager will take you to a window where you can edit, move, delete, or view 
smilie categories. By default, there is one smilie category called 
 
.  
Generic Smilies
 
 131

Administering Your Forum 
If you now click on View, you will be taken to another screen that shows you all the smilies in 
that category. 
 
You have a number of options when working with smilies. These include editing a smilie, adding 
a smilie to a category, and uploading a smilie. 
Editing a Smilie 
Clicking on 
 allows you to change a number of the smilie's parameters. These include: 
Edit
Title 
This is the title or name of the smilie displayed. 
• 
Text to replace with a smilie
 
 
 
  
 
This is the text that, when entered into a post, will be replaced by the smilie. This can 
be changed to suit. Don't make this a real word as this might cause sentences to have 
random smilies placed in them. The preferred format is 
• 
:name:. 
Smilie file path
 
132 
• 
 
 
 (on server)
 
 
This is the path to the smilie image on the server. 
Smilie category
 
 
This is the category where the smilie is stored. 
• 
Display order
 
 
This is the order in which the smilies are displayed to the end user when previewed. 
The smilies with lower numbers are displayed before those with higher numbers. 
• 
 

Chapter 5 
 
 
Adding a New Smilie 
If a smilie is already on the server, then you can add it to one of the categories. To do this, you fill 
in the details for the smilie and click on Add Smilies. The smilie will then be added to the list 
available to users. 
 
 133

Administering Your Forum 
Uploading a Smilie 
This is very similar to adding a new smilie to a category—if you click on the Browse... button, you 
will be able to upload smilies direct to the server from your computer. The file path specified will 
need to have a 
 
134 
chmod permission of 777 set in order to allow file uploads. 
 
Creating Your Own Smilies 
You can make your own smilies if you are good with graphics—they are just standard GIF format 
files. However, there are literally thousands of smilies and smilie packs to be found on the Web 
for you to use. 
Avatars 
An avatar is a small picture that can be set to appear next to a username to give the user a visual 
identity. Users can choose from a set of preloaded avatars, or the administrator can allow custom 
avatars to be uploaded. 
To control avatars, click on 
 in the AdminCP to expand the options, and then click on 
Avatars
 
.  
Avatar Manager
 
You will then be able to use the avatar manager to control avatars, in much the same way that you 
use the smilie manager to control smilies.  

Chapter 5 
 
 
We will now see how to add and store avatars. 
Adding Avatars 
Just as with smilies, there are two ways to add avatars—use avatars already on the server or 
upload new avatars. You can either add avatars singly or in batches, depending on what 
information you provide. 
  
The only difference with this process compared to the smilie upload process is that you have to 
provide a number for the 
 
Minimum Posts field. This is to control who has access to which avatar. 
So, for example, if you supplied an avatar and you only wanted people with 250 posts or more to 
be able to use it, you would enter 250 into the minimum posts field. 
 135

Administering Your Forum 
 
 
Storing Avatars 
There are two places in which avatars can be stored: either in the file system or in the database. 
• 
The advantage of storing avatars in the database is that the storage system is more 
efficient and they are easier to back up (because you just have to backup the database 
and not individual files). However, storing them in the database can add a 
considerable amount of data to the database, making it grow in size dramatically. It 
also adds a greater load onto the database in terms of data access. 
 
 
 
136 
You can change where the avatars are stored using the Avatar Storage Type screen. 
 
Before moving the avatars from the database (where they are stored by default), you will need to 
set the chmod permission of the folders receiving the avatars to 777 and make sure that there is 
enough space on the server for all the files. If you fail to do this, then the process will fail and the 
avatars will remain in the database. 
If you change your mind later, you can move the avatars back into the database by reversing 
this process. 

Chapter 5 
Summary 
In this chapter we've looked at the critical role the administrators play in keeping a forum working. 
Some of the tasks that we've looked at (such as updating the counters) are just general housekeeping, 
while others (such as backing up the database) are critical tasks that can make all the difference to 
the long term health of your forum. 
We've also looked at two items that add fun and individuality to your forum—smilies and avatars. 
The message here is a simple one—take care of your vBulletin discussion board, and it will take 
care of your members.

Upgrading vBulletin 
Nothing stays the same. Life is a constantly moving forward, and software moves forward faster 
than most things. vBulletin is constantly changing as new versions are released. Sometimes these 
are big changes (such as from version 2 to version 3), and other times they are just bug fixes and 
security updates (such as 3.5.2 to 3.5.4). 
The updates to vBulletin generally contain security fixes rather than cosmetic tweaks, so it is 
important to install them in a timely fashion so as to eliminate security vulnerabilities in your 
discussion board. 
License issues 
Purchasing a license for vBulletin (either leased or owned) entitles you to a year's worth 
of updates. After this, you will need either to renew your license (if you leased the 
license) or to pay a nominal fee for updates (if you bought an owned license). 
In this chapter, we're going to look at how to upgrade a vBulletin discussion board from version 
3.5.2 to 3.5.5. In particular, we will look at: 
• 
How vBulletin automatically tells you when to upgrade 
• 
What preparations are necessary before you upgrade 
• 
Migrating the changes that you have made to your bulletin board 
• 
How to upload the files to your server 
• 
Testing the upgraded version of your board 
• 
Getting the upgraded version up and running 
When to Upgrade 
vBulletin will tell you when it needs upgrading. When you access the AdminCP, you will see 
messages telling you whether a new version is available. This happens automatically and requires 
no input on the part of the administrator. 

Upgrading vBulletin 
 
 
This has two advantages: 
• 
It spreads the word about updates quickly and easily. 
• 
It encourages people to upgrade licenses! 
Clicking on the link takes you to the members' download area. (You will need your customer 
number and password to access this area.) From there, you'll be able to download the latest 
vBulletin installation package (in the form of a compressed Zip file about 1.5Mb in size). 
Preparing for Upgrade 
Before you upgrade anything, you need to backup your database with the data for the forum. We 
saw how to do this in Chapter 5. 
As well as a database backup, make an up-to-date copy of the files on the server—preferably a full 
server backup of all files and folders, just in case something goes wrong or you upload the files to 
the wrong location and overwrite non-vBulletin files. 
Backup motto 
It's better to have made a backup and not need it than not to have made one and find that 
you do! 
The next stage is to extract the files from the compressed archive that you downloaded. Extract 
them to a separate folder on your system. 
Once you have done this, locate the folder called upload, and rename it to match the name of the 
existing vBulletin folder on your server (in our case vb). 
Migrating Changes 
Before you upload the files to the server, stop and think for a moment. Have you carried out any 
changes to the core PHP files of vBulletin? (We saw how to customize a bulletin board in Chapter 
4.) If you have made any changes, uploading the new files will obliterate these changes. Most  
 
140 

Chapter 6 
people want to keep any changes they made to their vBulletin installation, and this often keeps 
them from carrying out upgrades. 
If there is only one change, then it may be easier just to make the same change again after the 
upgrade. However, if there are many changes, repeating them will be much more complicated and 
will need a lot more time and effort, and of course, there will always be scope to get things wrong. 
What you want is a file compare utility that highlights the differences between two files. 
In Chapter 4, we saw how to modify the PHP code so that PayPal treats a subscription as a goods 
transaction. We will use this example to show how a file compare utility can be used to easily 
migrate changes to a new version of your bulletin board. 
File Compare Utilities 
There are a variety of such file compare utilities available. Two of the best are UltraCompare by 
the makers of UltraEdit (http://www.ultracompare.com) and DiffDog by Altova 
(http://www.altova.com). These are both commercial applications, and they do an excellent job 
of comparing files and highlighting the differences. 
Another option is taking the free route—an application called WinMerge is available for free from 
http://winmerge.sourceforge.net. 
 
We can now run WinMerge on both versions of the file that was hacked (includes/ 
functions_subscriptions.php). This will highlight the differences between the two files.  
Some differences are to be expected while others are hacks. 
 141

Upgrading vBulletin 
In WinMerge open the two files (the new version and the old version that we hacked). 
 
When you open the two files, the lines that contain differences are highlighted. Also, on the 
left-hand side, there is a location pane that shows a schematic of the documents and places lines  
in them to show where there are differences. 
When a new version of vBulletin is released, not all the files will have been changed. In fact, only 
a few of the files will contain actual code changes. However, there will be changes in the headers 
and footers of all the files. In the header, the version number will have been changed, in this case 
from version 3.5.2 to 3.5.4. In the footer, the changes will be to the date that the package was 
downloaded and, if the file has been updated, to the version number. 
 
 
142 

Chapter 6 
The only other change to the code represents that hack that we installed earlier. Migrating this 
hack is simply a case of using the buttons on the menu to copy the change from the left-hand 
window (the original file) to the right-hand window (containing the new file). 
 
To make this hack easier to spot in the future, you can add a comment to the code, explaining what 
the hack does. 
 143

Upgrading vBulletin 
 
 
Save the file with the changes, and repeat the file compare process for any other files that have 
been changed. 
If your forum has a lot of hacked files, you might need to go through each file and compare it with 
the file on the server. However, to make life easier, the vBulletin development team releases a change 
list detailing the files that have been changed—this makes the job of finding updated files easier. 
We're now ready to move on to the next phase of the update process. 
Uploading the Files 
The next stage of the upgrade is to upload the files. There are two options open to you: 
• 
Overwriting all the files that were previously uploaded to the web server 
• 
Deleting all the old files and folders, and then uploading the new files 
It's easier to overwrite the old files, so that's what we'll do here. 
Before you do this though, one thing—close the forum! This prevents users from logging in and 
allows you to work in peace. It also means that you and only you see the errors if things go wrong. 
 
144 
Log into the AdminCP, expand vBulletin 
 in the left-hand menu, and click on 
Options
vBulletin Options. 
In the right-hand pane, double-click on Turn 
 
Your vBulletin On 
 
and Off. Change Forum Active to 
No, and click on Save. Now only Administrators can access the forum. 

Chapter 6 
 
 
Once that is done, take your FTP program and upload the new files over the old files. When 
asked if you want to overwrite, remember to choose Yes (or whatever option your FTP 
application gives you). 
Remember that the same rules apply here as when installing the forum (see Chapter 2): 
• 
Transfer all text files in ASCII mode. 
• 
Transfer all non-text files in Binary mode. 
 145

Upgrading vBulletin 
Consult your FTP program for details of how to do this. Usually, transferring the files in auto 
mode will work fine. 
It is important that you upload all the files from the latest vBulletin package to the web server. 
This includes the entire contents of the install folder. Failure to do this can result in the upgrade 
script being unable to complete the upgrade process. 
When all the files have been uploaded, you are ready to move on to the next phase of the upgrade. 
Running the Upgrade Script 
With the newest vBulletin files uploaded to your web server, you are now ready to run the 
upgrade script. 
This is the simple part of the upgrade, so it's all plain sailing from here. 
To run the script point your web browser at http://www.example.com/vb/install/upgrade.php, 
remembering to replace www.example.com/vb with the correct path to your own vBulletin installation. 
To proceed with the upgrade, you'll need your vBulletin Customer Number. 
The installation wizard will then begin. 
This screen confirms that the files have been properly uploaded, and we are ready to begin,  
so click on the 
 
 
146 
Next Step button to continue. 
 

Chapter 6 
Step 1 imports the latest vBulletin options into the database. 
 
In step 2, the updated help files are loaded. 
 
 147

Upgrading vBulletin 
The next step updates the master language files. 
 
Next the updated vBulletin styles are loaded. 
 
148 

Chapter 6 
 
 
Finally, the vBulletin version number is updated. Click on the 
 button to finish. 
Proceed
 
 149

Upgrading vBulletin 
The final page is an important one—there is a reminder to delete the install/install.php file. 
This prevents others from running the install script, which may damage your forum. 
 
Delete the 
 
150 
install.php file via FTP, click on Go 
, and then click on 
Back
Proceed once again. 
You will then be taken to the log-on screen for the AdminCP, where the change of version 
numbers along with the absence of a screen telling you to upgrade are sure signs that things have 
worked out fine. 
Testing the Upgrade 
Once the upgrade is done, test the forum. Nothing elaborate. Just see if things are working. If you 
have a lot of hacks installed, then it might be a good idea to see whether they all work. This is a lot 
easier to do if you have more than one administrator on the site! 
You can spend as much (or as little) time as you want doing this. As a bare minimum, check that 
you can still log in, post messages, and read messages. If you have a busy forum rest assured that 
the members will soon let you know if other things aren't working! 
Unveiling the Upgrade 
The final step is to unveil the upgrade to the members. Access the vBulletin Options page, and 
switch the forum back on. This will allow your members to log in again, to post and read 
messages, and to interact normally.  
Be on the lookout for things that don't work, and take all reports of problems seriously. If you 
think that there are problems, follow these simple steps: 
• 
Shut the forum down. 
• 
Test to see whether you can recreate the problem. (Remember to test the forum using 
a registered user's account as well as an administrator's account, as some problems 
may only show up to members.) 

Chapter 6 
• 
Carry out the upgrade again. This time pay special attention to migrating the hacks 
and uploading the files properly. 
• 
Test again. 
If problems persist, then it could be that one of your hacks is incompatible with the new version. If 
you think that this is the case, then install a hack-free version and add the hacks manually to find 
out which one is causing the problem. If you are making use of a popular hack, then it is likely 
that others will also have the problem and will be talking about it on the vBulletin forums over on 
http://www.vbulletin.com or http://www.vbulletin.org—check these out for information! 
Summary 
This chapter has dealt exclusively with upgrading a vBulletin discussion board. This is a process that 
you will probably need to carry out a few times a year to keep up to date with the latest releases. 
On paper, this looks like a long process, but in reality it's quite easy—upgrading a basic board 
with just a few hacks (or no hacks at all) takes only minutes. With practice, it is possible to 
upgrade an extensively hacked board in less than an hour. After one or two upgrades, you will 
start to get a feel for how it works and where things are (for example, which files you've hacked 
and what other changes you've made). You'll then find that it is a lot faster and a lot easier.

Changing the Look of vBulletin 
In this chapter we're going to examine ways to change how your vBulletin installation looks to the 
outside world. 
The sky's pretty much the limit with what you can do with vBulletin, and there's no point going 
through the process of building a custom style here, because what you will want to do will be 
different to what we will do. So, instead, we'll offer you some hints, tips, and insights into style 
manipulation and creation for vBulletin. 
In this chapter we will look at: 
• 
The role of styles and templates in vBulletin 
• 
How to modify the default style 
• 
How to add and edit a new style 
• 
How to distribute a style that you have created 
• 
How to upload a new style to your server and install it 
Styling vBulletin 
There are two ways that styles get created for vBulletin:  
• 
Modification of the default style 
• 
Creation of Custom styles  
By far the most common method of creating styles for vBulletin is to start off with the default 
style (the blue and white style that you've seen so far in this book) and to make modifications to 
this style. You can think of this as a sort of 'feature-creep' or 'style-creep' of the original. This 
method is much easier and more straightforward than creating a style completely from scratch, and 
by using the default style as a starting point, you are making certain you haven't forgotten 
something or left something important out of the template.  

Changing the Look of vBulletin 
 
154 
Buy your way out of work! 
You don't have to bother about creating templates for yourself. If you fire up your 
browser and search for "vBulletin styles" or "vBulletin templates", you will find literally 
thousands of examples. Most of these are commercial so that you have to buy them, but 
there are quite a number of templates freely available for download—check out the 
vBulletin discussion forum for more details. 
Template Lifecycles 
A discussion board can go through one of two distinct template lifecycles. Which one it follows 
depends a lot on the administrator of the forum and what they are trying to achieve with it. 
Lifecycle 1—Constant Change 
This lifecycle is probably the more common of the two and probably accounts for many of the 
customized vBulletin boards you've come across. 
This is where the administrator installs their copy of vBulletin and gets their forum going as 
quickly as possible. So, in order to minimize any delay between getting the discussion board 
installed and getting it working, they simply open up the forums for discussion using of the default 
style (or download and use another style that they fancy). 
Then, with the board open and operational, the administrator sets about making incremental 
changes to the discussion board. They start off small, perhaps adding their logo, or changing a font 
color or table background.  Then they start to make bigger, more significant changes. Then, at 
some point they probably install a hack or two onto the board. 
By now the board is looking significantly different from the default that they installed maybe only 
a few weeks earlier. The cycle of development continues until one of three things happen: 
• 
A new version breaks the customized template. 
• 
The administrator wants to completely change the look of the site. 
• 
The administrator is happy with the end result. (Hmmm, don't think that ever happens!) 

Chapter 7 
Lifecycle 2—Working Behind the Scenes 
This is where the administrator installs the forum and then either opens it with a default skin or 
keeps it closed while they work on a brand new skin for the site. This is a little bit like the 
magician's trick where they pull away the curtain. Tada—a dramatic unveiling. 
There are several drawbacks associated with this method. The first, and most significant, is the 
forum downtime involved. If you only planning a few small tweaks to the default style, then you 
could be up and running in a reasonable period of time, ranging from a few minutes (for quick 
hacks and tweaks) to a few days (for something more involved). 
Prolonged, unnecessary downtime is bad for a discussion board—old members start to look for 
somewhere new to go, new members can't sign up, and your ranking in the search engine listings 
start to drop. Keep downtime to an absolute minimum. 
Editing the Default Style 
You've seen what you start with, so let's take a look at how to make some serious changes to the 
default style for the vBulletin template. 
To carry out these modifications, click on Styles & Templates in the left-hand menu, and then click 
on Style Manager. This brings up the Style Manager window, which we first met in Chapter 3. 
 
As we saw in Chapter 3, if you click on the Go button, then you are taken to a very large window called 
All Style Options window. (In Chapter 3 we saw how to use this page to change your board's logo.) 
 155

Changing the Look of vBulletin 
Changing Image Paths 
There are a lot more images in a vBulletin installation than just the main logo. There are, in fact, 
over 200 images contained in 13 folders within the main images folder. 
 
You can change the default location of eight of these folders: 
• 
images/buttons  
This folder contains all the button images. 
• 
images/statusicon  
This folder contains all the icons that are used to represent the status of forums, 
threads, and posts. 
• 
images/attach  
This folder contains the various icons that are used to represent different 
attachment file types. 
• 
images/misc  
This folder contains miscellaneous images. 
 
156 

Chapter 7 
• 
images/editor  
This folder contains the button and interface images for the vBulletin editor. 
• 
images/polls  
This folder contains the images used to build the bars in the poll voting results page. 
• 
images/rating  
This folder contains the images used to illustrate the rating applied to a thread. 
• 
images/reputation  
This folder contains the small images used to display a user's current reputation. 
Upload the new images to new folders on the web server. You can move forward some of the 
defaults if you've not made an entire set of new images. However, if your new images are 
dramatically different from the old ones, you should make an effort to change all the images—odd 
styling of images can be confusing for the user. 
Once the new images are uploaded, change the paths, and click on Save. The new images will 
immediately appear on the board. 
Other Editable Elements 
Much of the default style can be edited through the All Style Options page. Here are the categories 
that the different sections have been grouped into: 
• 
Common Templates  
• 
Sizes and Dimensions  
• 
Image Paths  
• 
Miscellaneous  
• 
Body  
• 
Page Background  
• 
<td>, <th>, <p>, <li>  
• 
Table Border  
• 
Category Strips  
• 
Table Header  
•

• 
Input Fields  
• 
Buttons  
• 
<select> Menus  
• 
Small Font  
 157

• 
Forum Jump Menu  
• 
Additional CSS Definitions  
• 
Text Editor Control Styles  
• 
Toolbar Menu Options  
Each one of these categories is home to several changes and tweaks that you can make to the 
styling of your board.  
For example, let's change the background color of the body of the forum page. In the Body section, 
type #aa0016 (a dark red) into the Background box. You'll see the color of the tile change when 
you do this. Then click Save CSS for the Body section. (Alternatively, you can click Save at the 
very bottom of the Style Manager page to save changes to multiple sections). Notice that the text 
you entered for the background attribute is now shown in red—indicating that you've made a 
customization to that style. To undo the change, you can either type the original value in the box, 
or you can use the revert option at the bottom of the Body section. 
 
You can change further elements of the page by editing the CSS attributes for those sections of the 
board.  (You can also use the CSS selector at the bottom left of each section of the Style Manager 
page and then use a CSS editor to locate that section in the HTML source code.)

Chapter 7 
Some Tips about Editing Styles 
When you are making changes to a style, two things are paramount: 
• 
That the changes you think you've made are actually carried out 
• 
That the changes you've made to the style haven't been detrimental to the discussion 
board as a whole 
In order to make sure that things work smoothly, it's recommended that you follow these simple rules: 
• 
Make a note of any changes you make. Keep a text file open and list the changes there. 
• 
Make the minimal number of changes needed at any one time. Making lots of 
changes at once makes undoing a specific change tricky. 
• 
Browser crashes, losing Internet connectivity, or power outages can cause you to lose 
any unsaved changes you've made. So, to prevent such losses, save your changes often. 
• 
Check the effect that your changes have had on the discussion board. Are the 
changes what you expected them to be? Are you getting nearer to your goals or 
further away? 
• 
If you make changes that have an adverse effect on the discussion board, stop what 
you are doing immediately, and check the changes you made—did you make a 
mistake, or is something unexpected happening? If you can't solve the problem 
quickly, then undo the changes using the revert option for that section in the style 
manager, and try again. 
• 
The best place to experiment with changes and modifications to your discussion 
board is on your test installation—you can then migrate the changes to the live 
discussion board. 
Adding a New Style 
So far, we've looked at modifying the existing default style, but what about creating a whole 
new style? 
Easy! 
Again, start off at the All Style Options page. Take a look at what's below the buttons. Do you see 
the link marked Add New Style? 
It's amazing how many people miss that altogether and simply cannot find a way to make a new 
style. (Many people resort to using the Add Child Style option in the drop-down box instead.)

Click on the Add New Style link. This takes you to the Add New Style page shown below: 
 
You can now fill in the following details of the new stylesheet:

This allows you to choose whether the new style has a parent style or is itself a 
parent style. (A parent style has child styles based upon it.) 
• 
Title  
This is the name of the new style. 
• 
Allow User Selection  
This determines whether the new stylesheet is selectable by the board users from the 
main forum page and the UserCP. Set this to No initially if you don't want others to 
see your 'work in progress'. 
• 
Display Order  
This lets you choose the display order of the styles as displayed in Style Manager and 
the Quick Style Chooser in the forum. 
The Add New Style window should now look like this: 
 
160 

Chapter 7 
 
 
In case you are wondering, the radio buttons just below the style name indicate whether it is 
selectable by the end users. 
OK, now you have your new style, it's time to do something with it! 
Editing the Style 
The Style Manager window now looks a little different with two styles in there waiting to be edited. 
 
Another interesting feature is that, when you hover the cursor over the name of one of the styles, it 
gives you the ability to view the discussion board using that particular style. 
This is done using a carefully crafted hyperlink: 
http://www.example.com/vb/index.php?s=&styleid=4 
You can now edit the new style in the same way that you edited the old one. What you will notice 
initially is that your new style is in fact the old style—it's just a rendition of the default style. 
However, this allows you to work on the style and keep the changes separate from the style in use 
on the discussion board. 
Fonts 
Be careful about making too many changes to the fonts used—remember that fonts need 
to be installed on the user's computer too. By default, a number of fonts are specified, and 
if the first one is unavailable, another is used. Font types are also specified to cover a 
broad range of different fonts. 
Be careful with fonts—if the font you specify is not available and you don't specify 
alternatives, your forum can end up looking very strange indeed!

Changing the Look of vBulletin 
Save Often! 
Remember, save your changes often! 
Saving the Style 
Right, you've made some changes to your new style. The next thing you need to do is back up the 
changes just in case something goes wrong. You don't believe that things can go wrong? You think 
your forum is safe on the server? Think again! A whole host of things can, and do, go wrong: 
• 
A cataclysmic failure of the server 
• 
A vanishing web host 
• 
A corrupted database 
• 
A hacker attack 
• 
Accidental deletion 
• 
Wipe-out by installing a new version 
• 
The unexpected—fire, flood, aliens … 
The best place to keep a backup is not on the server but on your PC or an external storage 
medium, so make a copy and keep it safe (perhaps on a USB flash memory device or a CD). 
Downloading the Style 
The Style Manager page is the place to go when you want to download your style. In the drop-
down box next to the style you want to download, you'll find Download.  
You will then be presented with a message box like this: 
 
If you click on Cancel, then a file that contains all the changes to the style will be downloaded. 
If you click OK to access the advanced options, you get the ability to change the name of the file 
and what is downloaded. 
 
162 

Chapter 7 
 
 
The XML file contains all the changes that have been made to the style. Here's a small sample of 
an XML file:

Changing the Look of vBulletin 
Making the New Style into the Default 
OK, you've created a new style, and you want to make it available as the default. How do you do this? 
Easy! You may have noticed some checkboxes at the top left of the Style Manager window. 
 
The style currently in use is checked. To change the style in use, just swap the check marks 
around, and click on the button marked Save Display Order. 
 
The new style will now be available, and the old style won't be available. If you want to make both 
styles available, check both options and click on Save Display Order. 
 
This will now make both styles available to the users of the board, and they can choose which one 
they want to use. 
Distributing a Style 
You've made a great style, and you think that others might like to use it. You can choose to make 
it available for free, or you could decide to sell it. (Remember though that selling a style usually 
means having to provide the buyer with installation support.) 
 
164 

Chapter 7 
But how do you package it? 
A style consists of the following elements: 
• 
An XML file containing the changes 
• 
All the custom images that go with it 
To create a distribution package for a style, first take the custom XML file that you created and 
place it in a folder. (Call the folder the same name as the style.) 
Then, download all the folders that contain custom images for the style from the web server. Make 
sure that you get the folders and the images. So, for our earlier example, we'd need to download 
the following folders: 
• 
images/custom/buttons  
• 
images/custom/statusicon  
• 
images/custom/attach  
• 
images/custom/misc  
• 
images/custom/editor  
• 
images/custom/polls  
• 
images/custom/rating  
• 
images/custom/reputation  
Place these folders and their contents into the folder containing the XML file and you're done. You 
can package up the whole thing into a zip file for convenience if you want—it also helps to keep 
all the files together in one place. 
Installing a New Style 
Installing a new style is simple. Follow these simple steps: 
• 
First, find the style that you want to use. 
• 
If the style has been packaged, extract the contents of the zip file. 
• 
Upload the folders containing images into the images folder on the web server. Do 
not upload the XML file. 
• 
Next, click on Styles & Templates in the left-hand menu, and then click on 
Download/Upload Styles. 
• 
This takes you to the interface that you saw earlier when downloading the XML file. 
This time, we're interested in uploading it. 
 165

Changing the Look of vBulletin 
 
 
• 
Click on the Browse… button, and go in search of the XML file. 
• 
Make sure that (Create New Style) is selected in the Merge Into Style drop-down box. 
• 
Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on Import. 
• 
The import process will run and import the style into vBulletin. 
 
And that's all there is to it! 
Summary 
In this chapter we've looked at how to style a vBulletin installation. If you're like most people, this 
is something you're likely to want to take your time over and work on to get right. It's a good idea 
not to rush things and to work methodically, checking often that the changes result in the look that 
you expect. 
Also, remember to save regularly and make regular backups—don't rely on the web host to do this for 
you. If you've spent time making modifications and changes. then take the time to keep them safe! 
Finally, you might also want to consider making your style available to others—this is both quick 
and simple with vBulletin. 
Happy styling!

Developing a Hack 
In this chapter we'll be looking at how you go about developing a hack for a vBulletin installation. 
Being based on the PHP language and on MySQL database infrastructure makes vBulletin very 
versatile, so we're going to have to limit our scope. Almost anything that you would want to do 
with vBulletin is possible if you know how to leverage PHP and MySQL! 
In particular we will look at: 
• 
How to hack a discussion board by changing one of the template files 
• 
How to distribute a hack by giving other programmers clear instructions about the 
code changes 
Hacking vBulletin 
Let's take a look at how to create a vBulletin hack. The hack we're going to be developing here is 
one that allows you to control how vBulletin handles private message receipts. As we saw in 
Chapter 3, private messages, known as PMs, are messages that one member can send to another 
member of the board. 
 

Developing a Hack 
The member types a message into the private message window and then clicks on the 
 
 button. 
Submit Message
The recipient can collect the message the next time they log in (or, if they are already logged in, 
the next time they request a new page from the board). 
But there's one feature that seems to annoy some members (especially if it's a popular board where 
the members make a lot of use of the PM facility). This is the read receipt feature. When a PM is 
submitted, a message box is displayed asking the sender whether they want to request a read receipt. 
 
Read receipts are a useful feature, but the problem is the message box displayed—people find it 
gets in the way and often they won't want to send a read receipt with every message. You as the 
administrator can do something about this—you can hack your vBulletin installation to give your 
members greater control over how read receipts are handled. 
You have the power … 
… to disable private messaging read receipts altogether. In the left-hand menu in the 
AdminCP, click on 
 followed by 
 
168 
Usergroups
Usergroup Manager. Then for each 
usergroup you don't want to have this feature, click on 
 
Edit Usergroup and set 
 
Can Use Message 
 and 
 
Tracking
Can Deny Private 
 
 
Message Read Receipt 
 to 
Request
No. 
Doing this, however, will remove the ability for members to request a read receipt. It 
would be much better to simply change how the request works. 

Chapter 8 
Making the Changes 
Let's now work through how to make this hack possible. There are a few code changes you need to 
make to a vBulletin template. If things go wrong, you already know how to revert templates back 
to their original state. As long as you take care and follow the code here carefully, everything will 
work out fine. But always keep a backup just in case! 
Locating the Template 
In the left-hand menu of the AdminCP, click on 
 
Styles & Templates to expand it, and then click on 
Style 
. 
Manager
 
This brings up the Style 
 page in the right-hand side screen. Click on the button marked 
Manager
<< >> to expand the template window. 
 
You now need to click on the new button marked << >> lower down on the page to expand all the 
templates so as to find the one you are looking for. 
 
 169

Developing a Hack 
In the scrolling window, work your way down until you get to a template called pm_newpm. 
Double-click on the link to open the template. 
 
Hacking the pm_newpm Template 
You can now make a few changes to this template. These changes involve removing the existing 
code that causes the prompt to appear and adding new code that provides a checkbox so that the 
sender can request a read receipt if they want one. 
The first thing you need to do is locate the following segment of JavaScript code in the template: 
    else if (formname.dopreview != true) 
    { 
        <if condition="$show['trackpm']"> 
            if (confirm("$vbphrase[request_receipt_for_message]")) 
            { 
                formname.receipt.value = 1; 
            } 
        </if> 
    } 
You need to remove this section of code. Rather than delete it outright it's much better to just 
comment out the code by adding // and a space to the beginning of each line of the script: 
    // else if (formname.dopreview != true) 
    // { 
and so on. 
While you're doing this, it's a good idea to add a note so that later you will be reminded later why 
you commented it out! 
 
// Begin PM read receipt hack 
 
// else if (formname.dopreview != true) 
 
// { 
 
170 

Chapter 8 
 
// } 
 
// End PM read receipt hack 
Next, within the same template, find this segment of code: 
<input type="hidden" name="receipt" value="0" /> 
(This will be on one long line, so it may be rather hard to find.) Comment this out too. Since this is 
HTML, we comment it out by placing <!-- and --> around the line. Again, it's wise to add 
comments to the code to remind you why you removed the line: 
<!-- Begin PM read receipt hack --> 
<!-- line removed --> 
<!-- <input type="hidden" name="receipt" value="0" /> --> 
<!-- End PM read receipt hack --> 
Next, look for the following segment of code: 
<div> 
    <label for="cb_parseurl"> 
        <input type="checkbox" name="parseurl" value="1" id="cb_parseurl" 
                tabindex="1" $checked[parseurl] /> 
        $vbphrase[automatically_parse_links_in_text] 
    </label> 
</div> 
When you locate it, you need to add below it as follows (again remembering to add the comments): 
<!-- Begin PM read receipt hack --> 
<!-- line added --> 
<div> 
    <label for="cb_receipt"> 
        <input type="checkbox" name="receipt" id="cb_receipt" value="1" /> 
         Request Read Receipt? 
    </label> 
</div> 
<!-- End PM read receipt hack --> 
Now that you've made the modifications to the code, you can save it by clicking on the Save button. 
Testing the Hack 
Testing is simple—try sending a PM! When you are in the private message window, you will see 
the new checkbox enabling you to specify that you want a read receipt for the message you send. 
Try a couple of tests, one with a read receipt request and another one without, just to make sure it 
all works.

Hack Distribution 
So now you have a hack and you want to make it available to other people. The question is, how  
do you do this? The license agreement prevents you from distributing whole templates, and 
anyway, you're only making small changes to the template so it's silly to get people to replace 
code that is unchanged. 
The best way to distribute hacks is in the form of clear instructions that others can easily follow. There 
are many ways to do this but the following is an example of one way that is clear and straightforward. 
MODIFICATION – PM READ RECEIPT CHECKBOX Version 1.0.2 
----------------------------------------------------- 
 
Open TEMPLATE pm_newpm 
 
Find and DELETE/COMMENT OUT: 
 
    else if (formname.dopreview != true) 
    { 
        <if condition="$show['trackpm']"> 
            if (confirm("$vbphrase[request_receipt_for_message]")) 
            { 
                formname.receipt.value = 1; 
            } 
        </if> 
    } 
 
Find and DELETE/COMMENT OUT: 
 
    <input type="hidden" name="receipt" value="0" /> 
 
Find: 
 
    <div> 
        <label for="cb_parseurl"> 
            <input type="checkbox" name="parseurl" value="1"  
                    id="cb_parseurl" tabindex="1" $checked[parseurl] /> 
            $vbphrase[automatically_parse_links_in_text] 
        </label> 
    </div> 
 
Below code ADD: 
 
    <div> 
        <label for="cb_receipt"> 
            <input type="checkbox" name="receipt" id="cb_receipt" value="1" /> 
            Request Read Receipt? 
        </label> 
    </div> 
 
SAVE pm_newpm and CLOSE. 
 
Test modification. 
 
END OF MODIFICATION 
------------------- 
With this hack we needed only to modify templates, but there are times when you need to 
document edits to settings or even to actual PHP files. Settings changes can be documented by 
specifying the menu navigation and the final setting change. 

Chapter 8 
Admin CP -> Usergroups -> Usergroup Manager -> Edit Usergroup 
Set "Can Use Message Tracking"  
and "Can Deny Private Message Read Receipt Request" to "No". 
The PHP file modification that we saw in Chapter 4 can also be documented in this way: 
PAYPAL MODIFICATION Version 1.0.2 
--------------------------------- 
 
Open includes\functions_subscriptions.php 
 
Find: 
 
            <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"no_shipping\" value=\"1\" /> 
 
Replace with: 
 
            <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"no_shipping\" value=\"0\" /> 
 
SAVE and UPLOAD 
 
Test modification. 
 
END OF MODIFICATION 
------------------- 
Tips for Hack Distribution 
Here are a few tips that make code distribution easier for both you and the person following 
the instructions: 
1. Test hacks thoroughly. If possible, try them out on a test installation of vBulletin 
before making changes to your active board. 
2. Be specific as to which file or template requires modification. 
3. Replace whole lines of code—don't mess about trying to explain which bit of the line 
needs changing. 
4. Feel free to add comments to the code you include. This will make life easier for the 
person using the instructions—but will also bulk out your code. 
5. Be clear as to what code you want the user to find and what they should then do with it 
(e.g. replace it with different code or add something above or below it). Be careful to 
check that the code you want the user to search for isn't duplicated elsewhere in the 
file. If this is the case, then be more specific and display more than one line of code. 
6. Don't use line numbers—these can change with updates to the software. Also, any code 
changes (or other hacks) above the line will cause the line numbers to be wrong. 
7. Make sure that you give the proper name for the template or PHP file you want 
editing. In the case of PHP files, include the path within the vBulletin installation. 
8. Keep version numbers updated. If you make a small change to the code (to fix a typo 
say or make a small modification), then change the minor version number (say from 
1.0.2 to 1.0.3). For big changes or alterations that allow the code to work for a new 
version of vBulletin, change the major version number (say from 1.0.4 to 2.0.0).  
 173

Developing a Hack 
Plugins and Products 
One of the new features available in vBulletin 3.5 is plugins and products. Plugins and products 
are a new and easy way to add new features to a vBulletin installation.   
 
There are some differences between a plugin and a product. A plugin allows new features to be 
added to a core vBuletin installation. In other words, it is a code snippet imported into vBulletin 
and executed by specific hooks. This is an easy way to extend functionality without making 
changes to the underlying PHP files of vBulletin. 
A product is a downloadable package that contains notonly plugins but also templates, options, 
phrases, help files, and control panel entries.  This means that these are a bigger, more integrated 
types of plugins. 
Hooks are what drives plugins. These are locations within the PHP code of vBulletin that trigger 
events. These events can be used to run code contained in plugins. You can view these hooks from 
the AdminCP by clicking on 
 followed by 
, and then clicking on the 
Plugin System
Add New Plugin
Hook Location drop-down box. 
 
Getting Plugins and Products 
Plenty of plugins and products that are designed to carry out a multitude of tasks are available for 
download. In fact, many hacks and board modifications have been converted to plugins and 
products because of the ease of installation. 
The best place to begin your search for plugins is http://www.vbulletin.org. 
 
174 

Chapter 8 
Adding a Product 
After you have downloaded a product (which will be an XML file), access AdminCP and click on 
 followed by 
. From here click on 
Plugin System
Manage Products
Add/Import Product: 
 
This will take you to the Import Product screen:   
 
Using this, you can choose to import the plugin either from your computer (by uploading it to the 
server) or import the XML file from your server. One you have found the file, click Import. This 
will import the plugin into vBulletin and activate it and make it ready for use.   
After you have installed the plugin, make sure to follow any additional installation instructions 
provided with the plugin. 
Adding a Plugin 
Adding a plugin to a vBulletin installation is much easier. From the AdminCP, click on Plugin 
System followed by 
.  
Add New Plugin
 175

Developing a Hack 
 
 
In this screen you can cut and paste the code from the instructions you have, and choose the 
necessary hook to execute the plugin.   
After making all the changes, click on Save, and the plugin will be added to vBulletin and be 
ready to use. 
What If Things Go Wrong? 
Whenever you add any new code to a vBulletin installation, there is a chance that things may go 
wrong. The worst-case scenario is that you bring down the whole vBulletin board and make it 
totally inaccessible. 
Fortunately, there's a global way to disable plugins, and it doesn't require access to the vBulleting 
interface, only FTP access to the server. 
All you need to do is find the includes/config.php file and add the following code: 
Define('DISABLE_HOOKS', true); 
Save the file and upload it to the server. Now vBulletin will run without plugins, and this gives 
you a chance to remove the offending product or plugin using Manage Products or Manage 
Plugins from the AdminCP. 
Once you have removed the offending plugin, you can reactivate the plugin system by removing 
that line of code from includes/config.php. 
 
176 

Chapter 8 
Summary 
In this chapter we've looked at another code modification, but this time instead of concentrating on 
the hack itself we paid attention to the process of making a hack to the code of a vBulletin board. 
You are likely to want to carry out a number of hacks to your board, and with each one you will 
increase your knowledge and understanding of how the board works. With time you will get an 
understanding of how the different templates and PHP files interact, and this is when you are most 
likely to start to think about creating your own hacks. 
Take your time when creating your own hacks—don't rush it. Take advantage of the vBulletin 
licensing policy, and work on a test-bed installation of the discussion board—that way, if things 
go badly wrong, you don't bring your whole forum down!

Cookie check 
• 
Back up database 
• 
Download the vBulletin installation 
• 
Transfer to new server 
• 
Restore database 
• 
Back online! 
Cookie Check 
The first thing to do is check on the current cookie settings. Setting a specific cookie domain and 
cookie paths can cause problems for you when moving servers or even changing the URL of the 
discussion board. To prevent these problems, reset your cookie path to / and remove any cookie 
domain value that might be present before carrying out the server move.  
A warning about cookies! 
An incorrectly set cookie domain or path can prevent you from accessing your control panel! 
Back up Database 
The next step is to back up the database. Refer to Chapter 5 for full details on how to do this. 
Make sure that you use an up-to-date backup and that you've locked the forum prior to carrying 
out the backup so that there can be no changes made to the data. 
Download the vBulletin Files 
Using an FTP program, download your current vBulletin installation to your PC. You could 
reinstall vBulletin onto the new server, but you will lose any changes you made. 
Transfer to New Server 
The quickest and easiest way to transfer the database to a new server is using SSH or Telnet.   

Chapter 9 
New Host Tips 
Make sure that your new host allows you to have such shell access. (They might not 
allow it as standard, but check to see if they will allow it temporarily to allow you to 
carry out the move.) 
Follow this simple transfer process. 
1. Telnet into your existing server. 
2. Type the following: 
 
ftp NEWSERVER  
 
Where NEWSERVER is the hostname or IP address of your new server. You will be 
prompted for a username and password to login. 
3. Next, type: 
 
bin  
cd /PATH/TO/NEW/DIRECTORY  
put /PATH/TO/DATABASE/DUMP.SQL  
 
replacing /PATH/TO/NEW/DIRECTORY by the path to the directory where you want to 
place the database backup and /PATH/TO/DATABASE/DUMP.SQL by the path to the 
database dump. If you omit this step, the backup will be put into the root of the server. 
4. This process will now transfer the database. 
5. When completed, type: 
 
close  
quit  
6. Verify that the database has been transferred. 
Database Restoration 
1. On the new server, create the database in which your vBulletin data will be installed. 
2. Telnet/SSH into the new server. 
3. Type: 
 
mysql -USERNAME -p NEWDATABASENAME < PATH/TO/DUMP.SQL  
 
replacing USERNAME by the username to access the database, NEWDATABASENAME by the 
name of the new database, and /PATH/TO/DUMP.SQL by the path to the database 
backup file. 
Back Online 
Upload your vBulletin files (the ones you downloaded earlier) remembering first to edit the 
includes/config.php file. Edit $servername, $dbusername, $dbpassword, and $dbname with the 
values that correspond with the new server.

Finally, log into the forum. Everything should be working as normal. 
If, during the server change, you changed the URL used to access the community, then you'll also 
need to change BB URL value. Log in to the administrator control panel, go to the vBulletin Options 
section, and change you BB URL to correspond to the new URL. 
Graphics 
The graphics that you see in a standard vBulletin installation are not standard graphics. They 
started life as 3D objects and scenes created in an application called Lightwave 3D. The resulting 
rendered images were then post-processed using Adobe Photoshop. 
3D graphics work differently from normal graphics—the edges of the images do not end in a 
sharply defined pixel border. Instead they are matted to a specific background color. If you use the 
default background colors in vBulletin, then everything will be fine. However, if you change the 
background colors of the page, then you may need to do some work on the graphics. To make this 
easy the vBulletin developers have made available two versions of the Graphics Developer Kit. 
(You can download them from the vBulletin Members' Area.) The first kit contains fully prepared 
images, and all you need to do is choose the matte color and save the images. The second kit 
contains much larger layered images that allow you to make numerous changes to the look of the 
graphics before saving them. 
Lightwave 3D and Adobe Photoshop 
For more details on Lightwave 3D visit http://www.newtek.com/lightwave, and for 
more details on Adobe Photoshop visit http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop. 
Be aware, neither of these applications is cheap! 
Global Post Text Find and Replace 
This is something that many board administrators want to do but aren't sure how—messing with 
the database directly seems dangerous to many. It is quite simple though, and you can do it all 
through the AdminCP. 
Log into the AdminCP, and in the left-hand menu click on Import & Maintenance followed by 
Execute SQL Query. If you are greeted with a message that says:  
You are not authorized to execute SQL queries  
you will need to add your user ID number to the line: 
$canrunqueries = '';  
in the includes/config.php file. For example, if your user ID is 1, this line will become:  
$canrunqueries = '1';  
Now you can run queries. To carry out a find and replace on all the post data in your board, you 
will need to run an SQL query like this:  
UPDATE post SET 
T pagetext = REPLACE  
(pagetext,'Vbulletin','vBulletin') WHERE pagetext LIKE '% Vbulletin%';  

Chapter 9 
This SQL query looks through the posts for instances of Vbulletin and replaces them with vBulletin. 
The WHERE clause is used to optimize the find and replace as this allows MySQL to take 
advantages of indexes, which speeds things up. 
If you get an error running this query then check to see if you are using a table prefix in the 
database for the tables (such as vb_) and add this to the query.  This would change the query to the 
following: 
UPDATE vb_post SET pagetext = REPLACE  
(pagetext,'Vbulletin','vBulletin') WHERE pagetext LIKE '% Vbulletin%';  
If you wanted to carry out a similar find and replace within PMs, you'd use the following query:  
UPDATE pmtext SET message = REPLACE  
(message,'Vbulletin','vBulletin') WHERE message LIKE '%Vbulletin%';  
By using MySQL queries you are taking total control over the data held in the database. We don't 
have the time or scope here to cover MySQL queries in detail, so for more information visit 
http://dev.mysql.com. Alternatively, you can read Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective MySQL 
Management by Marc Delisle, published by Packt Publishing (ISBN 1-904811-03-5). 
Programming Standards 
Good programming is clear, unambiguous programming. Let's run through a few tips to help make 
your code more readable, easier to debug, and easier to make changes to later on. 
Braces 
For clarity each brace should be placed on its own line in the code: 
if ($condition) 
{ 
    // code goes here 
} 
Don't be tempted to condense code like this: 
if ($condition) 
{    // code goes here } 
Indenting 
Indent code between braces: 
if ($condition) 
{ 
    // code goes here 
} 
Code between braces within braces should have deeper indenting: 
if ($condition) 
{ 
    if ($condition2) 
    { 
        // code goes here 
    } 
    // some more code goes here 
} 
 201

Programmer's Reference 
 
202 
Give Operators Space 
All operators (except -- and ++) should have a space either side. 
    $a = $b + $c;  
String Quoting 
All strings should be quoted with single quotes when they don't contain variables or control 
characters. Otherwise always use double quotes: 
$a = 'Hello, World!'; 
$b = "Hello,\nWorld!"; 
$c = "$hello,\nWorld!"; 
Return Values 
Use only lower-case true and false for return values. Upper-case should be reserved for 
custom constants. 
if ($condition) 
{ 
    return true; 
} 
else 
{ 
    return false; 
} 
AND and OR 
Always use AND rather than and or &&, and OR rather than or or || in your code. 
if ($num1 AND $num2 OR $num3) 
AS 
Similarly, AS in foreach statements should be capitalized. 
foreach ($array AS $num => $var) 
{ 
    // code goes here 
} 
SQL Queries 
Under all circumstances, make sure that you double quote all SQL queries. 
$DB_site->query("SELECT field FROM " . TABLE_PREFIX . "table ORDER BY field"); 
It may be better to write long queries on more than one line.  

Chapter 9

Summary 
This chapter has been a rundown of information that will be of use to those who plan to do more 
with their vBulletin installation than just install it and leave it be. While really only scratching the 
surface of vBulletin, we're presented the information people request most often. 
Happy hacking!

vBulletin Directory Structure 
Being able to navigate the vBulletin directory structure makes installation, customization, updating, 
and upgrading vBulletin much quicker, easier, and safer. In this appendix we will take a brief tour of 
the directory structure as it appears on your web server after uploading the vBulletin applications. 
Version control 
Here we are examining the directory structure of the 3.5.3 version. However, few 
differences exist between different versions.

Notes 
• 
There is a total of 598 files in 33 directories (including the root directory). 
• 
The standard entry point for end users into vBulletin in the index.php file in the 
root directory. 
• 
After uploading all the files and folders using a suitable FTP program, the program is 
installed by running install/install.php. 
• 
The file install.php in the install folder must be deleted for security reasons after 
installation of the software or an upgrade. (This prevents others from carrying out a 
reinstallation using different parameters.) 
• 
The administrator control panel (AdminCP) is accessible from admincp/index.php. 
Access is based on usergroup and permissions. 
• 
The moderator control panel (ModCP) is accessible from modcp/index.php. Access 
is based on usergroup and permissions. 
• 
If you are migrating to vBulletin from a different discussion board, then you will 
need to download the ImpEx Import System, available from the vBulletin members' 
area. After the import process is completed, this can be safely deleted. 
• 
Always make a backup of the file structure and keep copies of any files you make 
changes to.

This appendix consists of a web resource list for vBulletin. We've broken it down into general 
categories, although there is quite some crossover on certain sites. We recommend that you visit as 
many of these sites as possible—they contain a wealth of information about using, customizing, 
and modifying vBulletin. 
While some of these sites will be providing information, software, and code for free, others are 
commercial enterprises and sell products and services. You may also like to check out our own 
website http://www.kingsley-hughes.com/books for further information and updates.
