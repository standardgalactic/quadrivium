licensing deal. Yep, Thomas the Tank Engine has signed away his
pixelation rights, and he'll appear on a computer near you soon. The
Fat Controller will have to go on a diet though, as there may not be
enough room in the memory to contain his ﬂabby sprite.
Thomas will be yours for good for the paltry sum of £2.99.

It'll hove everything that an

Er... I think this says it all really?
"It's the World Cup this summer, ain't it?". Yeh, let's do a
totally original game to coincide with it!". "What's that
then?". 'Death Bike Ninjas with a bad case of Piles!". "Noh,
never work. I've got a better idea, let's release a
FOOTBALL game!". "Yeh, let's!".
The above is a rough estimation of what may have
been said during a Virgin Games meering nor too long
ago. So in order to follow the rest of the pock, Virgin has its
pending release, World Cup Soccer '90.
Being a conversion of the arcade game with the same
name. it'll be ready (with nasal hairs crossed) by May, and
released around then Does it feature anything different
from rhe rest of them? Nati, not really!
By the way., you all know that Virgin is also developing

Domark is on the brink of being so funky that its staff will
explode. Escape From the Planet of the Robot Monsters and
Klax ore two completely radical games on the Tengen label
that are to come our way so soon that they may arrived before
you hove been born_
As we all know, the Tengen label is devoted to conversions
of Atari coin-ops, and Escape From the Planet of the Robot
Monsters is no exception. It's almost as ludicrous as its title as you
run around on the surface of Planet X blasting all sorts of robots,
who are controlled by the evil (with a capital Eve) Reptilons. The
Reptilons hove but one task, to destroy Earth (blimey, crikes!).
You must stop them in a simultaneous two player kind of like
game.
Klax is not as stupid as its name suggests, being a rather
more serious puzzling type of game. It is being released at the
same time as irs arcade counterpart (a ﬁrst as far as we know)
and it has been described as a sort-of Terris with chunky bits.
Both games will retail for around E,9_99 Coss, £14.99 Disk,

hove? Bugger All!
One company Thar is working like complete buggery is Accolade who
has a lorro lorra releases on the way (nor all of them ore sound).
The Cycles is about something or other that! can't quite remember
at the moment, but we're assured that there's lots of speed, fumes,
and girls involved - sounds like a warehouse party to me, Hardball II is
the sequel to, wait for it, Hardball and is mostly more of the same sort
of basebolly type of thong, although with better graphics and exten-
sions and things.
Powerboat USA is a simulation of high speed Superboot racing. Can
you zip through the waves in order to win a race? Would you want to
bother? Would you throw your guts up over the side?
But the piece de resistance is certainly Bar Games, a simulation of
the sorts of things that grown-ups like to do in pubs? Like hell, c'mon
who goes to a pub to play liar's dice, beer sliding, or ride a mechani-
cal bull? Nor me matey, I'm off on a lager frenzieeeelll (The wet T-shirt
contest sounds good though).
There's a new IR infrared
joystick in town and it's big
and chunky!
Spectravideo has
launched the latest in a
line of joysticks that no
longer require a wire to
keep it moving. You can
wave it in the air and
even act like Stone Roses.
Ar the price of f,39•95 it

Virgin Mastettranic - YC Feb
No Pokes I'm afraid, just a mop
and a few rips. The ﬁrst level is
wrap-around so keep track of
where you are. To complete the
game you will need six idols, when
you hove the sixth idol go to The
Chamber (you cannot enter here
until you have all six), and take the
last idol. To ﬁnish the game (make
sure you have 7 idols). go to the
starting screen and gasp in awe at
the end-of-game message.
THUGS
These are no problem, Iwo high
kicks or throwing stars will kill them,
KARAKETAS
Be very careful with these guys,
their energy goes down very
slowly. The best way to deal with
these nasties is to throw all your
stars at them and if possible pick
them up again and throw them
back, if you can't do that a couple
of ﬂying kicks will do.

NINJAS
Nagy, very nasty. Whatever you do
do not throw stars at them as they
will only throw them back at you. A
ﬂying kick is the best way to
dispatch any Ninja.
TUSKER
System 3
A very handy little cheat this,
although I hove not had the
chance to try it our. At the start of
any level walk right to the next
screen position yourself at the
bottom of the screen, whip a
joystick in port 1 and press ﬁre. You
should now appear on the last
screen of that level with all the
objects you need!

SUPER
WONDERBOY
Activision
Yes, I know we pulled this game to
bits last issue but I've found a nice
little cheat. Locate the door that
hides the end of level nasty (using
last month's deﬁnitive description)
and stand in front of it, release a
bomb, ﬁreball or whatever and hit
the SPACE BAR. Once inside, the
nasty will die leaving you free to
collect the spondoolics.
MONTY ON THE

Kixx
This game is a classic, re-released
for under a ﬁver. If you don't have
it, get it now! If you do and get a
high score, enter your name as I

mode. Easy!

There are. as I'm sure you've
noticed, quite a few reset pokes this
month. Anyone our there who has
not got a reset switch but likes to
take a chance con use the
following method to reset the
humble C64.
First, you'll need a paper clip,
got that? Good, now look at the
bock of the computer for the USER
PORT, Inside is a PCB numbered 1-
12 (see diagram), you need to
touch pins 1 & 3 (at the some
time), with rhe paperclip. This will
reset the C64. This is done however

as your own risk. YC will not be

or crispy hair-dos. You hove been
warned. If you muck it up and kill
the 64 you could try giving it a new

weird game. A very
weird game indeed.
To really get into the spirit
you'll have to read the
novella that comes with it.
The stay is as follows. You
are Steve, the victim of a
prank. This is no ordinary
prank though. A Daemon,
in the shape of Emily, a
girl at your work, has
given you a mind
inﬂuencing drug_ She then
establishes a mind contact
with you, and the result is
a series of frightening
dreams.
But this Daeomonic
activity has nor gone
unnoticed. There are
powers that rule over
these actions. The
guardians as they are
known have been

monitoring Emily's
progress and have tracked
her down. Now she has
taken possession of your
mind entirely. just as you
have gone under the
surgeon's knife for
exploratory brain surgery!
You hove gone back into
dream sleep. By
negotiating your dreams,
you can save your sanity
and your life. This is a
refreshingly detailed
scenario, which makes a
change from two-
paragraph cereal box
rype write ups.
Anyhow. the game
involves Steve's efforts to
escape brain death. Being
set in a dream world,
you'd expect the game to
be a little on the strange
side to soy the least. And
it is. To start with, you've
been shrunk to a size
equivalent to a tin of
Spam. The game starts
with you at a fairground.
Not on a ride, or at a

ooh, I've gone
wobbly or the knees,
there are more
games in this package
than there are ways to
carve spam with a
chainsow. Fifty games on
a cassette for less than the
price of a disk game
sounds like a bargain to
me and it is.
As you may suspect,
the quaky of these
games leaves something
to be desired but all are
playable ono' mostly
good fun. Even if you
hate each and every
game it is going to take
you a couple of days to
play all the games on the
tape. Many players will
recognise the genre as
that of the magazine
24 1 VC
listing. The programs may
be short with poor sound
and graphics but some
are real gems and others
are so bad they ore
classic.
The adventure begins
with Torpedo Run. We all
remember this game and
its •variants (basically space
invaders without the
falling bombs or the
invaders). Move your sub
from side to side
launching your torpedo at
the ships which soil in
rhree rows above you, No
fancy effects or graphics
but back to basics with a
simple blast.
Arcade Baseball is a
prime example of how to
do something
complicated in a bizarre
but simple way. From the
central pitcher's box a ball
descends the length of th
screen. By hitting the
space bar the blob or the
bottom of the screen
begins its horizontal
journey. If the boll
connects with the blob ir
bounces its way to the pits
or the top of the screen.
Alternating pits indicate
how rillany bases the
player manages to steal
while others indicate the
shot was our of bounds.
Hit the ball bock up the
centre of the screen and
the pitch ﬂashes 05 you hit
a home run.
The average gamer is
less than ﬁt (too many
hours spent slumped over

the P47 was the
principle American
ﬁghter during World War
II. The game fails
abysmally to live up to
the history of the plane
though. The storyline goes
like this: there isn't one.
You hove to pilot your
P47 through the various
levels of the game,
blasting anything you
meet with4your guns. The
enemy contingent is wide
ranging and deadly.
Small planes shoot bullets
at you. Large planes shoot
bullets at you. Small
ground turrets shoot bullets
at you.
Some of the end level
death machines are so
big that ifs doubtful
whether they would ﬁr on
the continent that they're
supposed to inhabit. Arc
whilst you're shooting
them there's no indication
of any damage you
cause. The sprites ﬂicker
and jerk as they shift
uneasily around the
screen.
The game itself is
actually fairly playable, if
a little too easy for my
liking. The fact that you
keep your extra weapons
after death is surprising
411111111
and makes the game
y
even easier. The
backgrounds are indistinct
and uninteresting and the
whole game seems a bit
anaemic.
I can't imagine how
anyone, let alone a
company of Firebird's
reputation, could release
a game which is so
blatantly bad. This w
surely destined for the
dustbin before it was
written. Perhaps a budget
house could have been
sold it. Ar twelve quid on
disk (or 31 tins of Spam in
a can), it's bloody awful
value for money. Buy the
Spam instead, cook an
exceptionally large fritter
with it and throw it around
the room making
machine gun noises. It's
bound to be more
entertaining (and easier
to eat). You're less likely
to be sick as well.

YOU this chance,
because through
misfortune and a sorry
twist of fate you have
got probs so large
that they could be
strung together
and used as

Since your
return from
Vietnam, things
for you have not
so much gone down hill,
more plummeted from a
stonkingly large mountain,
for one of your greatest
rivals in the army is now
rhe chief of the local
police force, and a doctor
friend of yours and his
niece have been
kidnapped by a large
terrorist group. The doctor
hod invented o rather
mean. lean weapons
system which could be
used to very ill effects.
With muscles
pumping. gun strapped to
bock, and customary
combat pants ﬂapping in
the wind., your task to
rescue them begins.
Unfortunately YOU are
suspected of the
kidnap (a way of
getting at you by
your Viet Cong
'friend') and the
police hove been
instructed ro bring
you in, with
excessive force if
necessary. So not
only ore you after
the terrorisrs, the
police are after you. and
the terrorists ore
after world supremacy
(and small, square
minry things ore after

•
adventure game series
Lost Ninja's 1 and 2., and
the 3D games system
which they both use.
Vendetta uses this system
too, although it is rather
more extensive than ever
before.
It is also only half of
the game as there ore
many levels and each
alternate level is one of
two separate styles of
gameplay. The second
comes into play when you
have found a ferrori and
the ignition keys during
the adventury part of the
game. Yep. you guessed
it, the second game style
used is a driving game.

thus mixing the best (and
most popular) of both
worlds.
This is no average
driving game though, as it
could be described as a
Chose HQ variant,
although iris for for berter
rhon the ofﬁcial licensed
version. It is probably rhe
best that could ever be
done on a C64, and this is
only part of the game.
Getting bock to the
3D section, this is where
you realise that Vendetta
is extra special. Nor only is
there more than the
average amount of
mopping. object
collecting. and room
searching ro be done, but
unbelievable quantities of
terrorists ore just begging
ro be given hot leaden
suppositories, thus
pleasing the shoot-them-
'til-they're-mush brigade_
And although the
game is multilood, this is
absolutely no bother
whatsoever and only
helps to allow the
programmers to make
the game absolutely
ENORMOUS. There is also
the added bonus for your
pennies of o free limited
edition watch with the ﬁrst
10.000 copies so you'd
have to hurry to grab one.
The graphics are
absolutely perfect.. and
the sonics are superb, the
bundle is linked with pure
gloss that'helps shineover
any small minor
inadequacies_ Vendetta is
nor just the best arcade
adventure ever, it invents
a new meaning for the

suppositry for the quaterbackl
ro have to take on the
be5t and beat them,
offensively and
defensively outwitting
them to score points. The
basic idea is the some as
American Football. Using
your offensive team, you
have to carry rhe ball
over the line into the
endzane. Your
defensive ream then
have to prevent the
opposition from
doing the same
thing in return_
Nothing is ever
as easy as it sounds,

\  T  ere are
,
lots of subtle
and solutions ro those
problems. The ﬁrst
problem is rhe explosive
ball. The ball starts off
totolly cool; repeated
droppings of it or failed
ploys will make it hear up.
Once the ball reaches
critical level it will explode
on violent contact, and
this will take our one of
your robots if he's got it.
It's nor all bad news
though, There are lines on
ﬁeld which will defuse the
ball and take it back to
cool status. Passing
through these is the best
tactic, gradually
approaching rhe
endzone.
At the start of each _
play you ore given
several options to
use against the

of American Football

dangerous that injuries
had ro be treated by a
totally innovotive form of
medicine_ Robotic limb
replacements solved the
problem of the severest
injuries. Unfortunately, the
ruling bodies of the sport
decreed that players who
hod robotic limbs hod a
distinct advantage over
the others on the ﬁeld,
and so the robotically
treated players were
banned_
But as more and
more players suffered
crippling injuries, the
public consensus was
towards allowing the
robotics on ﬁeld. Clearly a
compromise had to be
found, and so Cyberball
was-formed. The game
did away with the players
altogether and replaced
them with robots. This
nulliﬁed the dangers of
the sport: any damaged
robots increased greatly
and so did irs popularity_

there's only three each

con of course cotch it as
well, so the pass will need
ﬁne timing. Running ploys
ler your running backs
carry the boll as far as
possible before being
tackled. An option ploy
odds a touch of the
unexpected to your
offence, letting you try
something a little
different. Once play is lost
by your team, or you
score a touchdown, the
ball switches posession
and you must defend.
You have the choice of
either long, medium or
short ploys. You must then
select the defence you
think wi prevent the
opposi a m  from
success.
All of the options ore
selected from o useful ,e

choice is mode, and then
you are given four options

game for translation to

the real sport the ploy
gets a bit indistinct or
times but this is no
problem. Ployability is
deﬁnitely Cyberball's
strongest point. The
incentive of increasing
ream funds to spend on
the players' abilities (and
to amass a high score)
keeps you striving for
perfection in your play.
There are a nice
number of different ploy
options, all of which are
dearly drawn our on
screen. Thus. newcomers
to the game won't be put
off because they don't
know what's going on!
The play moves just about
as fast as possible on the
64. The colours are a little
on the dull side but the
robots are nearly
animated and do what
you want them to, more
r less. Overall, the game
orks very well indeed_

price tag (unthinkable
quantities of Spam), you'd
be advised ro check the
game out before parting
with the readies. Certainly
a game worthy of the
otrention of budding
detectives. After playing
for a while I felt fairly
conﬁdent that I could
ascertain the whereabouts
of Rik Henderson., missing

5  ystern 3 claims to have
created a new ero in
home and personal
computer entertainment
software. They don't
mention whether thi
policy starts with M
nor. Which is. in this case,
just as well, or their new
policy would hove got off
to an unfortunate start,
The scenario would
have us believe thor the
world is ruled by ancient
gods. These guys, whilst
normally mellow, drinking
herbal tea and eating
Spam fritters, are in a bit
of a ﬂap. Darneron. the
big nasty evil ambitious
god with the cute smile,
has decided to eradicate
mankind. To interfere with
mon directly is against the
rules so he's gone
through a loophole by
* g o i n g  back in time and
' altering history.
This is seriously bad
news for archeologists,
whose lives' work will
doubtless be rendered
worthless. It's also even
worse news for the rest
the Human Race, be-
cause they're going to
die. However, Dameron's
vil acts haven't gone
unnoticed. The other gods
hove been searching for a
true believer in them.
Only this person could
take on Domeron and
destroy his evil work. So it
was a tad fortunate that
they just happened to ﬁnd
such a boy. Guess who
gets to play him (no, not
with him, get your eyes
tested!).
Yes, that's you. The
unter, the mug, the
•person who parts with t A
cash. whoever. You'd 
,
better have had your
rhree shredded Spam this
morning because this
game is anything but
easy. You hove to negoti-
ate the time zones and
set right what has been
wronged by Domeron. To
o this you'll have to beat
e living Spam out of the
various monsters that rush
around the levels that
make up each screen.
As you begin to
explore you'll ﬁnd that
you ore not alone. On
virtually every level
skeletons open up from
the ground and slosh at
you with swords. This
depletes some of your
precious energy. Your
man can perform two
different leaps, kick and
punch, and use the
weapons which he comes
across. There are Gar-
goyles ﬂying around which
leave blue ﬁreballs when
killed. These con be shot
or the monsters.
Each level is guarded
by a huge Demonic nasty.
These mutants ore deadly
and ﬁre off round after
round of lethal bolts of
energy. Killing these off ir
the big problem with this
game. The delay be-
tween selecting the
special weapon and
actually ﬁring is too long...
This makes the game
really limited because
there's nowhere else you
can explore.
Ir's a shame because
rhe game has a certain
appeal. However, unless
you're a superhuman
Spam addict with six arms.
or know the cheat mode,
you won't get very far,
Never mind, perhaps the
policy for a new era of
entertainment software
will begin with the next
game.

A
unstifﬁest awards in the
industry, voted by you scruffy
lot (so if you don't agree with
the outcome, it's YOUR fault). I'd
just like to thank you for the tons of
entries that ﬂooded our ofﬁce, my
mum, my sister, my dad, the
woman at home who cooks my
meals, my dog, and the man in
the newsagents because he's nice!
GAME OF THE

Winner: STUNT CAR RACER
(Microprose)
Runner up: TURBO OUTRUN (US
Gold)
To be honest, this came as no
surprise, although one may have
Thought that the honours would
have been vice versa, Stunt Car

though, so you.must like it.

Runner Up: TURBO OUTRUN (US

A repeat of the Game of the Year
award, although I'm not sure that
Turbo Outrun is reolly classiﬁed as a
'simulation', Honourable mentions
go to Fighter Bomber and War in
Middle Earth (Heaven only knows
why).

ADVENTURE OF
THE YEAR
Winner: SCAPEGHOST (Level 9)
Runner Up: INDIANA JONES AND
THE LAST CRUSADE (US Gold)
Last year wasn't a very good one
for C64 adventurers. Scopeghost
won by the highest majority I've
ever seen (91%), and Indy (the
adventure version naturally) swept
up rhe rest of the votes_

This was was the closest fought award of
them all. with Ocean winning 36%
of the votes and US Gold winning
34%. Activision was very unlucky
not to be in the top two, winning
31%.
PROGRAMMER(S)
OF THE YEAR
Winner: GEOFF CRAMMOND
Runner Up. PROBE SOFTWARE
Geoff was a very popular choice,
no doubt. for this Stunt Car Racer,
and the Probe team ( for Turbo

march him. As a consolarion for
them though, nobody else got

games don't grow on trees.
They come from shops. But how
do they get there? Who makes
sure that they're not full of bugs?
Who masterminds the adverts an
who decides what to put in the
box? To ﬁnd out what really goes
on behind the scenes we rook
look at the production of one
game - US Gold's conversion of the
Sega coin-op, Crackdown - and
spoke ro some of the people
involved.
THE COIN-OP
From little arcade machines multi-
format arcade conversions grow_ In
this case, a licensing deal between
Sego and US Gold gets the show on
the road. The coin-op is a huge
A The arcade machine.
Two-player job, big enough for you
and a mare to stand in front of
without once getting elbowed in
the ribs_ What's more, it's one of
Sego's brond new system 24
machines. In other words it's got a

stereo FM digital sound, nardware
scrolling a  huge monitor and a
specially designed hard disk drive.
The scenario's oil about ma mega-
cool service agents - Ben Breaker
and Andy Attacker. They're out to
stop the evil Dr K by laying mines
oil over his evil fortress and killing
any biogenetically engineered
androids they meet on the way. All
this and more has to be squeezed
4
months..
THE MAN WITH
THE WHIP -
David Baxter's the name,
development's his game. Once the
deal is struck, it's up to Dove to
:
NP- programmers who con ﬁnish the
i t ,  project within the rime ond budget
allocated. Development houses
like Software Creations (Bionic
Commandos, LED Storm), Tiertex
• end the Assembly Line ,
ore all on his contacts list. Which
one he picks usually has something
to do with the kind of Software
they've produced before.
Obviously if someone's just churned
our ﬁve arcade conversions you
don suddenly go mad and give
-hem a vector graphics game.
Occasionally a licence is put out
to tender - the best game-design
usually wins the contract - but that
wasn't the case with Crackdown. A
bleory-eyed Arc Developments
were just putting cursor to pixel for
the very lost rime on their previous
project, Forgotten Worlds. They
needed something new to convert
and Crackdown was the obvious
choice.
Once the ink on the contract
has dried it's up to Dave and his
ream of Project Managers to make

sure that everything s running to
schedule. If the graphics aren't up
to scratch or there's some vital
feature missing from the gameplay
ir's up to them to spot it_ Ultimately
Ws the Project Managers that have •
overoll artistic control. 'We can go
back or any rime and say, "We
don't like that. I don't care how you
do it, I don't care if you've got no
more memory,. it's got to be
changet
Obviously things do go wrong.
Projects don't always run to
schedule - Ghouls and Ghosts, for
example took 11 months to
complete - and some occasionally
get abandoned mid-game. Luckily
there's a contingency piaci: 'If a
programmer dies of runs off we just
throw it at a company coiled the
Code Monkeys and they ﬁnish it
off.'
From System 24 to C64. The boys
with the broins hove been working,
as Arc Developments for no more
than a year. Before that they were
coding together just down the road
in another part of Brummy, or Elite.
Arcade conversions are what they
like doing best, preferably all
formats at exactly the some time.
Byron Nilsson is the man in
charge and it's up to rum to co-
ordinate the team. Not that there's
too much organising to do in the
A Arc Developments.
very early stages t o  familiarise
themselves with the arcade
machine they just hod to play it
over and over and over again. 'We
didn't even have a pause mode so
if we wanted to see the ﬁnal level
-  Level 16 - we just had to play
right through to Level 15 and ﬁnish
that ﬁrst,' Paul Walker, graphics
artist, ended p sitting in front of the
machine and copying everything
he could straight into Deluxe Paint
The ﬁrst step was deciding who
was going to do each machine
a f t
conversion. Chris Coupe (not Sam
Coupe? - Fd), got the 64. To avoid
a mad lost-minute rush, work was
organised according to strict
schedules worked out with Byron.
Apart from having to settle for
burst scrolling (pixel scrolling proved
just too slow) most of the 64 game-
play has stayed essentially the
some. The coin-op's elaborate
presentation sequences had to be
cut out but the screen display and
oil the levels are still intact.
Arc develop on PCs and convert
their code to the target machine
via PDS using their own specially
designed routines. The graphics are
only drawn from scratch once, on
the Amigo. Arc's home-mode
routines mean that they can be
converted ro Spectrum, Amstrad,
64 and Sr in a matter of hours. Any
necessary adoptions are usually
minimal.

The history
In AD 5150 the search
began to ﬁnd other worlds
for human colonisation.
Eventually a small planet
named Krouze was
selected.
The Earth-like surface
of the new world was
littered with the crumbling
evidence of a long dead
race: Ruined cities, giant
monuments and
fragmented records were
all that remained of rhe
savage, brutal semi-
human creatures. A Race
of Deviants...
100,000 years
before, the Deviants hod
conquered their
neighbouring planets, but
the Deviant warlords were
hungry for power and a
bloody civil war erupted.
This almost wiped out the
race, only a handful
esCaped.
Recently the colony
has been under attack
from a source tracked
down to be one of the
star system's many
asteroids.
The deviants hod
awakened and were
rapidly turning their
asteroids into a massive
bottle station.
A crack squad of
'Starworrior' commandos
were dispatched to
destroy the Deviant's
base. They managed to
plant a number of nuclear
explosive devices, but
failed to prime the timing
mechanisms.
As the lost Starwarrior,
you must complete the
mission and uphold the
honour of your fallen
comrades.

The Story
Mr_ Megafat lives half a
mile from a beach and
loves to go swimming in
the summer holidays.
However, the road to
the beach is usually
occupied by hostile
creatures going in the
opposite direction.
That's no immediate
problem for him, as he
has invented a new sort of
bicycle called "Velocipede
S.T_A.” (Simple to
Assemble), which is
equipped with a plasma
cannon to blow the
creatures to pieces, and
powerful springs to make
the bike jump_ But
nobody is perfect and it
takes skill to get Mr.
Kegafat to the beach
without crashing into the
creatures and losing a life.
(Don't worry about the
bike, it's easy to re-
assemble). If you get to
the beach, that's good,
but the next time the
creatures will have
become DEADLIER AND
NASTIER. So don't lose
your concentration -  Mr
Megafat's life depends on
you
The Rules
Before playing, the player
can choose the speed,
lives, level and volume.
Speed 1 is slow. 2  is
medium and 3 is fast.
Lives could be set to a
maximum of 9. There are
5 levels and the player
con start on the ﬁrst four.
Volume controls the
game tune and sound
effects.
While playing, the
player can move bock
and forth across the
screen, jump (joystick up)
and ﬁre (ﬁre button).
The counter, a
yellow stripe in the
middle of the screen,
will tell you how much
longer you'll have to go,
When you hove crashed,
or when you have
completed a level, you
will ger a bonus score
for how for you have
gone. You also get 100
points for every creature
you shoot, (some of them
can't be shot) but there's
usually more than one
way ro avoid them...

By S. Wickham
Options! Options!
So just exactly what can this
cartridge do? What ore the features
thor make it so special. Does it
match up to the current marker of
available cartridges. If the number
of options is anything ro go by,

then Super Snapshot V5 must surely
be the ultimate. Just rake a look or
this list of facilities:
Disk Copier(s)
File Copier
Parameter Copies
DOS Support
Boot Sector Support
Turbo DOS
Screen Copy (with Sprites)
Games Monitor
Machine Code Monitor
Track and Sector Editor
Drive Monitor
Video RAM Monitor
REU Monitor
Sound Sample Monitor
Character Set Monitor
File Reader
Extra Basic Keywords

BB5 Support
Cartridge RAM Expansion
Even the most sceptica, amongst us
has ro agree that this is one heck of
a list. It is fair to say
that some of these
facilities ore
accessible f r o m  the supporting
system disk. However,
unlike the other products
available, you do not have to
program Super Snapshot V5 before
you con use it.

has to be its ability to monitor what
is happening inside the computer's
memory. Not only to monitor it, bur
to alter and amend it as you so
desire. To this end Super Snapshot
V5 must be streets ahead of
anything else. You hove a Monitor

Monitor for Characters,. Monitor for

can be Monitored as con the REU
(Ram Expansion Unit) and Video

I have to confess that my
favourite option has always been
the MIL Monitor. no matter what
utility or cartridge I am Using. The
built in, transparent monitor on the
cartridge is excellent. Teaching
machine code is nor the intention
of the review. therefore 1 will nor
attempt it. Sufﬁce to soy that if you
examine the following table you
will be impressed by the

The Drive Monitor is essentially
the some as the above. All one
needs to do to access it is to put a
*n (where 'n' signiﬁes device
number) in front of the command.
The drive monitor is obviously very
useful for transferring the contents of
the buffers into the computer's
memory, where you can examine,
modify and then replace them
back into the drive's memory.
Graphically Speaking
Sprite designing, like Character
designing has always been a
laboriously long job, even for those
of us that think we are OK or it. No
matter how proﬁcient you are,
there are no real quick methods.
There are, however, ways of
making the tasks a little easier. One
of these is of course to 'pinch'
someone else's ideas. (Don't
forget, you connot pinch the design
and incorporate them in your own
commercially available programs).
The Sprite and Character Monitors
come to your aid. With these
facilities you con examine, modify.
odd-to and generally play around
with any Spire or Character you
like. The on-screen representation
of the creations you are working
on. is clear and full of the necessary
information.
Sounds Great!
What surely must be a ﬁrst from LMS
Technologies is the Sample Monitor.
I hove to admit that I haven't come
across one before. I also have to
admit that if there is one ﬁeld of
computer useoge I fall down in. it's
Sound and Music. I know absolutely
nothing at all on the subject. So
what exactly is the Sample Monitor.
A sound sample is a way of
recording any sound as a series of
numbers. It is the same method
used in synthesisers and CDs. With
the Sample Monitor you con cap-
ture these sounds ond by using the
PLAYER module on the system disk,
you can incorporate them into your
own programs.
The instructions in the manual
make the job of capturing a
sample, then saving it for later use
in your own programs, relatively
easy.
Picture This
One of the nicer facilities offered by
Super Snapshot V5, is rhe ability to
freeze a screen and save it our to
disk as a picture ﬁle. Various for-
mats are catered for here including
Koala. Run Hires, Doodle, Blazing
Paddles.
Another good feature is that
you can also save the sprites_ Once
you have the screen you desire in
memory, you simply press the
button on the cartridge and you
enter a sub-menu. The screen type
is displayed which includes one of
ﬁve types:

then loaded into Dpoint ill and
converted them to brushes. From
here I completely redesigned the
original screen and repositioned the
sprites. Finally. I resaved the
changed screen and converted it
back to a C64 picture ﬁle. I then
obtained a colour print out of my
modiﬁed screen. All in all, a very
satisfactory and rewording aspect of
this cartridge.
Round up Time
1
A lot of you will be disappointed
that I haven't mentioned the
Copiers, Nibblers, Parameter Utilities
and Back-up programs available.
The question of the morality and
ethics of these options is one which
will always be strongly debated
upon. Sufﬁce to soy that if you do
want to make PERSONAL backups,
then the facilities offered by Super
Snapshot V5 are excellent,
In conclusion, I will soy this. If
you ore thinking of buying a Car-
tridge to update your collection, or
if you want to buy one for the ﬁrst
time, then Super Snapshot V5 offers
excellent value for money. I would
go so far as to soy that if a C128
switching facility had been incorpo-
rated, similar to the Warp25, then
you would never need to remove
this cartridge from the back of your
machine,

a Sunday evening hangover,

we couldn't get rickets for the

Bur what's that
comics? Well, nothing except the
fact that Alex and his droogs still
keep popping up as minor villains
in American comics, adding a
spurious and twenty years out of •
dote street cred to their comics. (I
con only assume British writers are
too smart, or still too embarrassed
at teenage memories of wearing
white boiler suits, bowler hats and I
attitudes of ultro violence to use
them.)
For the proper. 'gritty, realistic'
stuff, American comics are relying:
on a growing cost of British writers.
First to follow Alan Moore with his
own regular title was Jamie
Dleano. He was given John
Constantine, the Christ like ﬁgure
from Swamp Thing. The resulting
title, Heliblazer, is modern horror ._,rf
set ﬁrmly in what Delano sees as •
the terror of The Thatcher Decade.
There hove been some great
villains in this, The Yuppies From
Hell; the three skinheads who ore
melted together by a passing
demon. And some great
supporting characters; my favourites
being those from the harassed and
now illegal Peace Convoy. (Yes
folks, it is now illegal to travel in a
convoy of more than six vehicles ill
this country.)
Neil Gaiman's Sondmon (DC).

and thrills, except his targets are
taken more from the nightmares of

The American Dream needs a

Grant Morrison who along with
Dove McKean, gave the world 'the
biggesr grossing comic book of all
rime with Arkham Asylum, is
scripting two regular DC riﬂes,
Doom Patrol and Animal Mon. The
Doom Patrol, a team of
superheroes, were originally
revived a couple of years ago to
crashing public indifference and
were about to be cancelled when
Morrison said he'd have a go or
them.
In a gesture that is rypicol of the
writer of 2000 AD's Zenith, he had
half of them killed in his ﬁrst issue.
Then he had them face a set of
villains calling rhemselves The

Animal Man is more traditional
superhero fare, he has the ability to
absorb the powers of any known
animal. A loving, family man who
ﬁghts for Animal rights and green
issues. After ﬁfteen episodes,
Morrison kills off the entire family.
The subsequent revenge being
played our is both shocking and
powerful.

You all remember rhe Console
Revolution, don't you? Everyone
was meant to ditch their computers
and go for Segos. It never
happened and, looking or the
publicity blurb which tells us that
Matt Goss, Ian Botham and Paul
McCartney all like playing with their
Ninrendos, is it any wonder why?
Now, though, there's something
to be interested about. The "Power
Glove" allows people with
Nintendos (and with some shrewd
licensing and wheeler-dealing why
not people with 64s?) to use their
hand (in a glove) to guide their
characters.
With their "Mike Tyson's Punch-
Out" game you could, like,
reeeally punch. Apparently it works
with other games as well and
should be available around
Summer. Still, you lot don't own
Nintendos. do you?

decency, I didn't visit the Singing
Machine stand which was showing
their new Koroake product (sing-
along top pop runes played
without vocals). Remember kids,

Nor only did this stand have some
of the funkiest hats around but,
after ﬂicking through a pile of
deﬂated helium balloons, the
stand-owner found something
appropriate. So it was decided to
kill two birds with one stone and
model both of them in the same
shot. Well wouldn't you?

there were loads of them because

Later on this year, you'll also be in
for Edd costumes for your Edd

It's difﬁcult to say whether the
