T
he 20th century brought us the dawn of the digital informa­
tion age and unprecedented changes in information technology. 
In fact, the rate of change is clearly increasing. As we begin the 
21st century, computer literacy is undoubtedly becoming a prerequisite 
in whatever career you choose.
The goal of Computing Essentials is to provide you with the basis for 
understanding the concepts necessary for success. Computing Essentials 
also endeavors to instill an appreciation for the effect of information 
technology on people, privacy, ethics, and our environment and to 
give you a basis for building the necessary skill set to succeed in the 
21st century.
Times are changing, technology is changing, and this text is changing 
too. As students of today, you are different from those of yesterday. You 
put much effort toward the things that interest you and the things that 
are relevant to you. Your efforts directed at learning application pro­
grams and exploring the web seem, at times, limitless. On the other 
hand, it is sometimes difficult to engage in other equally important 
­topics such as personal privacy and technological advances.
At the beginning of each chapter, we carefully layout why and how the 
chapter’s content is relevant to your life today and critical to your future. 
Within each chapter,  we present practical tips related to key concepts 
through the demonstration of interesting applications that are relevant 
to your lives. Topics presented focus first on outputs rather than pro­
cesses. Then, we discuss the concepts and processes.
Motivation and relevance are the keys. This text has several features 
specifically designed to engage and demonstrate the relevance of tech­
nology in your lives. These elements are combined with a thorough 
­coverage of the concepts and sound pedagogical devices.

INTERNET AND WEB
Internet
Launched in 1969 with ARPANET, the Internet consists 
of the actual physical network.
Web
Introduced in 1991 the web (World Wide Web, WWW) 
provides a multimedia interface to Internet resources. Three 
generations: Web 1.0 (existing information), Web 2.0 (con-
tent creation and social interaction), and Web 3.0 (automatic 
personalized content).
Common Uses
The most common uses of the Internet and the web 
include
 • Communication—the most popular Internet activity.
 • Shopping—one of the fastest-growing Internet 
activities.
 • Searching—access libraries and local, national, and 
international news.
 • Education—e-learning or taking online courses.
 • Entertainment—music, movies, magazines, and com-
puter games.
VISUAL SUMMARY
The Internet, the Web, and Electronic Commerce
INTERNET ACCESS
Once connected to the Internet, your computer seemingly 
becomes an extension of a giant computer that branches 
all over the world.
providers
Internet service providers are connected to the Internet, 
providing a path for individuals to access the Internet. 
Connection technologies include DSL, cable, and wire-
less modems.
browsers
Browsers provide access to web resources. Some related 
terms are
 • URLs—locations or addresses to web resources; two 
parts are protocol and domain name; top-level domain 
(TLD) or web suffix identifies type of organization.
 • HTML—commands to display web pages; hyperlinks 
(links) are connections.
Technologies providing interactive, animated websites 
include cascading style sheets, or CSS (to control the 
appearance of web pages); JavaScript (to trigger interac-
tive features); AJAX (to create quick response interactive 
websites; and applets (to display graphics, provide inter-
active games, and more).
Mobile browsers run on portable devices.
 
ThE InTErnET, ThE WEb, And ELECTrOnIC COmmErCE  
51
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be aware of resources available on the Internet and web, to be 
able to access these resources, to effectively communicate electronically, to efficiently locate information, to understand 
electronic commerce, and to use web utilities.
WEB UTILITIES
Web utilities are specialized utility programs that make 
using the Internet and the web easier and safer.
plug-ins
Plug-ins are automatically loaded and operate as part of a 
browser. Many websites require specific plug-ins to fully 
experience their content. Some plug-ins are included in 
many of today’s browsers; others must be installed.
Filters
Filters are used by parents and organizations to block cer-
tain sites and to monitor use of the Internet and the web.
File Transfer Utilities
File transfer utilities copy files to (downloading) and from 
(uploading) your computer. There are three types:
 • File transfer protocol (FTP) and secure file transfer 
protocol (SFTP) allow you to efficiently copy files 
across the Internet.
 • BitTorrent distributes file transfers across many differ-
ent computers.
 • Web-based file transfer services make use of a web 
browser to upload and download files.
Internet Security Suite
An Internet security suite is a collection of utility pro-
grams designed to protect your privacy and security on 
the Internet.
COMMUNICATION
E-mail
E-mail (electronic mail) is the transmission of electronic 
messages. There are two basic types of e-mail systems:
 • Client-based e-mail systems use e-mail clients 
installed on your computer.
 • Web-based e-mail systems use webmail clients located 
on the e-mail provider’s computer. This is known as 
webmail.
A typical e-mail has three basic elements: header 
(including address, subject, and perhaps attachment), 
message, and signature.
Spam is unwanted and unsolicited e-mail that may 
include a computer virus or destructive programs often 
attached to unsolicited e-mail. Spam blockers, also known as 
spam  filters, are programs that identify and eliminate spam.
messaging
While e-mail is the most widely used, there are two other 
messaging systems:
 • Text messaging, also known as texting and SMS (short 
message service), is a process of sending short electronic 
messages typically less than 160 characters. Texting while 
driving is very dangerous and illegal in several states.
 • Instant messaging (IM)—supports live communication 
between friends. Most instant messaging programs 
also include videoconferencing features, file sharing, 
and remote assistance.

networking card plugs into a slot on the system board to provide a connection to a 
local area network.
 • Connecting lines called bus lines provide pathways that support communication 
among the various electronic components that are either located on the system 
board or attached to the system board.
Generally, the system board found on a desktop is larger than that found on a lap-
top, and much larger than one found on a tablet, smartphone, or wearable computer. 
Although these system boards vary in size, they nevertheless all perform the same 
function of communicating between the components of the personal computer.

What is the system board, and what does it do?
Define and describe sockets, slots, and bus lines.
What are chips? How are chips attached to the system board?
Microprocessor
In most personal computer systems, the central processing unit (CPU) or processor 
is contained on a single chip called the microprocessor. The microprocessor is the 
“brains” of the computer system. It has two basic components: the control unit and the 
arithmetic-logic unit.
 • Control unit: The control unit tells the rest of the computer system how to carry 
out a program’s instructions. It directs the movement of electronic signals between 
memory, which temporarily holds data, instructions, and processed information, 
and the arithmetic-logic unit. It also directs these control signals between the CPU 
and input and output devices.
 • Arithmetic-logic unit: The arithmetic-logic unit, usually called the ALU, performs 
two types of operations: arithmetic and logical. Arithmetic operations are the 
fundamental math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Logical operations consist of comparisons such as whether one item is equal to 
(=), less than (<), or greater than (>) the other.
ethics
Because labor costs are 
much lower in China, many 
computers and peripherals are 
manufactured there. While this 
has resulted in the loss of jobs 
elsewhere, it has improved the 
standard of living for millions 
of Chinese. Unfortunately, 
their working conditions are 
considered to be very poor. Do 
you think consumers have an 
ethical responsibility regarding 
where and/or how products are 
manufactured?
privacy
Did you know that one type of 
specialty processor is devoted 
exclusively to protecting your 
privacy? Called cryptoproces-
sors, these microchips perform 
encoding and decoding of data 
faster and more securely than 
a CPU. These specialized chips 
exist in ATMs, TV set-top boxes, 
and smartcards.
Making IT work for you
FREE ANTIVIRUS PROGRAM
Have you or someone you know had a slower computing experience due to a spyware infection? Even 
worse, perhaps a malicious piece of software stole crucial, personal information or caused a total system 
failure. Most of these problems can be averted by having an up-to-date antivirus program running in your 
computer’s memory at all times. This exercise shows you how to download and install a free antivirus pro-
gram if your computer does not yet have one. (Please note that the web is continually changing, and some 
of the specifics presented below may have changed.)
getting Started First, make sure your computer does not have an antivirus or security suite running. If it does, be sure to 
completely uninstall that program, even if the subscription is expired. Now, follow these steps to install AVG, a popular, free 
antivirus program:
 1 • Visit http://free.avg.com and click the Download button. You will be asked to confirm that you want the free 
edition and then redirected to a download site.
 2 • run the installation file and follow the prompts.
 3 • Select basic protection if you are asked which product you would like to install.
using AVg Generally speaking, your antivirus program watches your system for malware and updates itself automatically. 
However, you can always download updates manually, set a schedule for full-system scans, and change basic settings for vari-
ous components of the software.
 1 • click Scan now to run a full scan on 
your computer.
 2 • Just to the right of that, click the 
button with the white cog to see the 
scan options where you can set a 
schedule for automated scans.
 3 • click the back arrow to reach the 
main screen, where you can click 
various elements of the program to 
configure them. for example, clicking 
Web will allow you to turn on a 
feature that detects cookies that may 
be used to track your online activity.

The Future of Information Technology
 • File servers—dedicated computers with very large storage capacities that provide 
users access to fast storage and retrieval of data.
 • Network attached storage (NAS)—a type of file server designed for homes and 
small businesses. NAS is less expensive, easier to set up, and easier to manage 
than most file servers. However, it does not include powerful management tools 
and features found in many large-scale file servers.
 • RAID systems—larger versions of the specialized devices discussed earlier in this 
chapter that enhance organizational security by constantly making backup copies 
of files moving across the organization’s networks.
 • Organizational cloud storage—high-speed Internet connection to a dedicated 
remote storage facility. These facilities contain banks of file servers to offer enor-
mous amounts of storage.
Storage Area network
A recent mass storage development is storage area network (SAN) systems. SAN is 
an architecture to link remote computer storage devices, such as enterprise storage 
systems, to computers such that the devices are as available as locally attached drives. 
In a SAN system, the user’s computer provides the file system for storing data, but the 
SAN provides the disk space for data.
The key to a SAN is a high-speed network, connecting individual computers to 
mass storage devices. Special file systems prevent simultaneous users from interfering 
with each other. SANs provide the ability to house data in remote locations and still 
allow efficient and secure access.

Careers in IT
Disaster recovery specialists are responsible for recovering systems and 
data after a disaster strikes an organization. In addition, they often cre-
ate plans to prevent and prepare for such disasters. A crucial part of 
that plan is to use storage devices and media in order to ensure that all 
company data is backed up and, in some cases, stored off-site.
Employers typically look for candidates with a bachelor’s or associ-
ate’s degree in information systems or computer science. Experience 
in this field is usually required, and additional skills in the areas of net-
working, security, and database administration are desirable. Disaster 
recovery specialists should possess good communication skills and be 
able to handle high-stress situations.
Disaster recovery specialists can expect to earn an annual salary of 
$70,000 to $88,000. Opportunities for advancement typically include 
upper-management positions. With so many types of threats facing 
organizations, demand for these types of specialists is expected to grow.
now that you’ve learned about secondary 
storage, let me tell you a little bit about my 
career as a disaster recovery specialist.

Some of the fastest-growing career opportunities are in 
information technology. Each chapter highlights one of 
the most promising careers in IT by presenting job titles, 
responsibilities, educational requirements, and ­salary 
ranges. Among the careers covered are webmaster, soft­
ware engineer, and database administrator. You will learn 
how the material you are studying relates directly to a 
potential career path.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Your Car’s dashboard as a powerful,  
Internet-Connected Computing device
Do you often wish that you could shop online or make din-
ner plans while your car drove itself? Would you like your 
car to use the Internet to suggest a better route, or stream 
a music list tailored to your likes? A computer located within 
the vehicle already governs many of your car’s functions. That 
computer is responsible for various safety and diagnostic fea-
tures. Recently, cars have begun offering Internet access for 
driving directions, streaming audio, and cell phone connectiv-
ity. In the future, cars will drive themselves and seamlessly 
integrate into our digital lives. Technology has been making 
better cars, and will continue to evolve to improve our lives as 
we look to the future.
Apple and Google have cre-
ated partnerships with auto-
mobile manufacturers to place 
iPad or Android devices into 
the center of a vehicle’s main 
console. Cars can connect to 
Wi-Fi access points or 4G net-
works to reach the Internet as  
the modern smartphone does. 
These developments allow your 
vehicle to provide many ser-
vices that normally require a 
smartphone but in a safer and 
more integrated manner.
One of the immediate benefits involves quick access 
to information. Drivers get real-time traffic data, weather, 
store hours, and much more. Also available is access to all 
the apps that you expect to have. One example is the Pan-
dora service, which allows you to stream free, ad-supported 
music from stations you create yourself. Why pay for satel-
lite radio or listen to stations that you don’t enjoy when you 
can access your favorite online music services right from 
your dashboard? Another benefit is the entertainment of 
your passengers or children. Some vehicles include screens 
that face the back seats, allowing parents to play DVDs for 
their children. Internet-connected vehicles allow individuals 
already paying for an online streaming video service to give 
their children access to this enormous library of cartoons 
and movies right in the vehicle. In fact, with a tabletlike inter-
face, your child can choose from a preset selection of mov-
ies or educational games, depending on his or her mood.
Now, such a tool at your fingertips has the risk of becom-
ing a distraction while you’re driving. There is no question 
that safety features must be built in to prevent accidents 
from occurring. Luckily, there is already a piece of technol-
ogy that prevents the driver from ever having to touch the 
dashboard: voice recognition. 
In the same way that Apple’s “Siri” has revolutionized the 
way individuals interact with their iPhones, similar systems are 
installed in the new dashboards. Drivers simply speak their 
commands to get the informa-
tion they need and to use the 
vehicle’s controls.  Furthermore, 
this computer system uses exist-
ing technologies that recognize 
and speak English to the user. 
This will allow the driver to hear 
e-mail messages, social network 
updates, and today’s news and 
weather while driving to work.
Some companies have already 
taken steps in implementing this  
technology. Ford uses voice rec-
ognition in some of its vehicles 
with a feature called Sync with MyFord Touch. Audi has 
added 3G connectivity in its new A7 model. However, the 
real breakthroughs will come when you can drive in safety 
while being as productive as when you are on your laptop. 
Advances in dictation software will one day allow users to 
easily dictate e-mail responses. Changes in sensors and 
automated driving will allow users to devote less attention 
to driving and more to getting things done. Google and Mer-
cedes are currently testing self-driving cars, and they may 
be available in the next ten years. When it does, do you see 
yourself paying for this upgrade in your next car? Would 
you be comfortable allowing a car to drive itself while you 
worked on your laptop or tablet?
Each chapter concludes with a brief discussion of 
a recent technological advancement related to the 
chapter material, reinforcing the importance of stay­
ing informed.

Tim and Linda O’Leary live in the American Southwest 
and spend much of their time engaging instructors and 
students in conversation about learning. In fact, they have 
been talking about learning for over 25 years. Something in 
those early conversations convinced them to write a book, 
to bring their interest in the learning process to the printed 
page. Now, they are joined by their son Dan O’Leary as a 
coauthor. Dan has recently completed  his PhD in Electri­
cal Engineering with significant experience in teaching and 
consulting in information technology.
The O’Leary’s form a unique team blending experience and youth. Tim has 
taught courses at Stark Technical College in Canton, Ohio, and at Roches­
ter Institute of Technology in upstate New York, and is currently a professor 
emeritus at Arizona State University. Linda offered her expertise at ASU for 
several years as an academic advisor. She also presented and developed mate­
rials for major corporations such as Motorola, Intel, Honeywell, and AT&T, 
as well as various community colleges in the Phoenix area. Dan has taught 
at the University of California at Santa Cruz, developed energy-related labs 
at NASA, and worked as a database administrator and as a consultant in 
information systems.
Tim, Linda, and Dan have talked to and taught numerous students, all of 
them with a desire to learn something about computers and applications that 
make their lives easier, more interesting, and more productive.
Each new edition of an O’Leary text, supplement, or learning aid has ben­
efited from these students and their instructors who daily stand in front of 
them (or over their shoulders).

Information Systems
When you think of a personal computer, perhaps you think of just the equipment 
itself. That is, you think of the screen or the keyboard. Yet, there is more to it than 
that. The way to think about a personal computer is as part of an information system. 
An information system has several parts: people, procedures, software, hardware, data, 
and the Internet. (See Figure 1-1.)
 • People: It is easy to overlook people as one of the parts of an information system. 
Yet this is what personal computers are all about—making people, end users like 
you, more productive.
 • Procedures: The rules or guidelines for people to follow when using software, 
hardware, and data are procedures. These procedures are typically documented 
in manuals written by computer specialists. Software and hardware manufactur­
ers provide manuals with their products. These manuals are provided in either 
printed or electronic form.
 • Software: A program consists of the step-by-step instructions that tell the com­
puter how to do its work. Software is another name for a program or programs. 
The purpose of software is to convert data (unprocessed facts) into information 
(processed facts). For example, a payroll program would instruct the computer to 
take the number of hours you worked in a week (data) and multiply it by your pay 
rate (data) to determine how much you are paid for the week (information).
 • Hardware: The equipment that processes the data to create information is called 
hardware. It includes smartphones, tablets, keyboards, mice, displays, system 
units, and other devices. Hardware is controlled by software.
 • Data: The raw, unprocessed facts, including text, numbers, images, and sounds, 
are called data. Processed data yields information. Using the previous example of 
a payroll program, the data (number of hours worked and pay rate) is processed 
(multiplied) to yield information (weekly pay).
 • Internet: Almost all information systems provide a way to connect to other people 
and computers, typically using the Internet. This connectivity greatly expands the 
capability and usefulness of information systems.
Introduction
The purpose of this book is to help you become a highly 
efficient and effective computer user. This includes 
how to use (1) apps and application software; (2) all 
types of computer hardware including mobile devices 
like smartphones, tablets, and laptops; and (3) the Inter­
net. Becoming a highly efficient and effective computer 
user also requires a full understanding of the potential 
impact of technology on privacy and the environment as 
well as the role of personal and organizational ethics.
To effectively and efficiently use computers, you need 
to know the parts of an information system: people, pro­
cedures, software, hardware, data, and the Internet. You 
also need to understand the wireless revolution, the 
mobile Internet, and the web and to recognize the role 
of information technology in your personal and profes­
sional life.
Welcome to Computing Essentials. I’m Alan and I work in informa­
tion technology. On the following pages, we’ll be discussing some 
of the most exciting new developments in computer technology 
including smartphones, tablet computers, and cloud computing. 
Let me begin in this chapter by giving you an overview of the book 
and showing you some of its special features.

Did you know that over 10 
million tons of material was 
diverted from landfills last year 
alone as a result of recycling 
efforts? This success is largely 
due to voluntary participation 
of people across the country, 
who have made “reduce, 
reuse, and recycle” a personal 
commitment. This includes 
recycling old computers, cell 
phones, printers, and displays. 
Your participation in recycling 
means fewer one-use products, 
cleaner water, and cleaner air. 
But recycling may someday pay 
off financially too. Many now 
see waste as a resource, and 
one that we shouldn’t squander 
by filling up the garbage can 
instead of the recycling bin. 
Imagine a future where the 
garbage collector drops off a 
check for your contributions to 
going green.

People
People are surely the most important part of any information system. Our lives are 
touched every day by computers and information systems. Many times the contact 
is direct and obvious, 
such as when we create 
documents using a word 
processing program or 
when we connect to the 
Internet. (See Figure 1-2.) 
Other times, the contact 
is not as obvious.
Throughout this book 
you will find a variety of fea­

Software
Software, as we mentioned, is another name for programs. Programs are the 
instructions that tell the computer how to process data into the form you want. 
In most cases, the words software and programs are interchangeable. There are two 
major kinds of software: system software and application software. You can think of 
application software as the kind you use. Think of system software as the kind the 
­computer uses.
System Software
The user interacts primarily with application software. System software enables the 
application software to interact with the computer hardware. System software is 
“background” software that helps the computer manage its own internal resources.

chapter 1
System software is not a single program. Rather, it is a collection of programs, 
including the following:
 • Operating systems are programs that coordinate computer resources, provide an 
interface between users and the computer, and run applications. Smartphones, 
tablets, and many other mobile devices use embedded operating systems, also 
known as real-time operating systems (RTOS). Desktop computers use stand-
alone operating systems like Windows 10 or Mac OS. (See Figures 1-5 and 1-6.) 
Networks use network operating systems (NOS).
 • Utilities perform specific tasks related to managing computer resources. One of the 
most essential utility programs that every computer system should have is an antivirus 
program. These programs protect your computer system from viruses or malicious 
programs that are all too often deposited onto your computer from the Internet. These 
programs can damage software and hardware, as well as ­compromise the security and 
privacy of your personal data. If your computer does not have an antivirus program 
installed on it, you need to get one. To see how you can install a free antivirus program 
on your computer, see Making IT Work for You: Free Antivirus Program on page 9.
Application Software
Application software might be described as end user software. Three types of applica­
tion software are general-purpose, specialized, and apps.
General-purpose applications are widely used in nearly all career areas. They are 
the kinds of programs you have to know to be considered an efficient and effective 
end user. Some of the best known are presented in Figure 1-7.
Specialized applications include thousands of other programs that are more nar­
rowly focused on specific disciplines and occupations. Two of the best known are 
graphics and web authoring programs.
Mobile apps, also known as mobile applications or simply apps, are small pro­
grams primarily designed for mobile devices such as smartphones and for tablet com­
puters. There are over half a million apps. The most popular mobile apps are for social 
networking, playing games, and downloading music and videos.

FREE ANTIVIRUS PROGRAM
Have you or someone you know had a slower computing experience due to a spyware infection? Even 
worse, perhaps a malicious piece of software stole crucial, personal information or caused a total system 
failure. Most of these problems can be averted by having an up-to-date antivirus program running in your 
computer’s memory at all times. This exercise shows you how to download and install a free antivirus pro­
gram if your computer does not yet have one. (Please note that the web is continually changing, and some 
of the specifics presented below may have changed.)
Getting Started  First, make sure your computer does not have an antivirus or security suite running. If it does, be sure to 
completely uninstall that program, even if the subscription is expired. Now, follow these steps to install AVG, a popular, free 
antivirus program:
	1	 •	 Visit http://free.avg.com and click the Download button. You will be asked to confirm that you want the free 
edition and then redirected to a download site.
	2	 •	 Run the installation file and follow the prompts.
	3	 •	 Select basic protection if you are asked which product you would like to install.
Using AVG  Generally speaking, your antivirus program watches your system for malware and updates itself automatically. 
However, you can always download updates manually, set a schedule for full-system scans, and change basic settings for vari­
ous components of the software.
	1	 •	 Click Scan now to run a full scan on 
your computer.
	2	 •	 Just to the right of that, click the 
button with the white cog to see the 
scan options where you can set a 
schedule for automated scans.
	3	 •	 Click the back arrow to reach the 
main screen, where you can click 
various elements of the program to 
configure them. For example, clicking 
Web will allow you to turn on a 
feature that detects cookies that may 
be used to track your online activity.

Figure 1-8  Supercomputer
Hardware
Computers are electronic devices that can follow instructions to accept input, process 
that input, and produce information. This book focuses principally on personal com­
puters. However, it is almost certain that you will come in contact, at least indirectly, 
with other types of computers.
Types of Computers
There are four types of computers: supercomputers, mainframe computers, midrange 
computers, and personal computers.
 • Supercomputers are the most powerful type of computer. These machines are spe­
cial, high-capacity computers used by very large organizations. Supercomputers 
are typically used to process massive amounts of data. For example, they are used 
to analyze and predict worldwide weather patterns. IBM’s Blue Gene supercom­
puter is one of the fastest computers in the world. (See Figure 1-8.)
 • Mainframe computers occupy specially wired, air-conditioned rooms. Although 
not nearly as powerful as supercomputers, mainframe computers are capable of 
great processing speeds and data storage. For example, insurance companies use 
mainframes to process information about millions of policyholders.
 • Midrange computers, also referred to as servers, are computers with processing 
capabilities less powerful than a mainframe computer yet more powerful than a 

	
Information Technology, the Internet, and You	
11
personal computer. Originally used by medium-size companies or departments of 
large companies to support their processing needs, today midrange computers are 
most widely used to support or serve end users for such specific needs as retriev­
ing data from a database or supplying access to application software.
 • Personal computers, also known as PCs, are the least powerful, yet the most widely 
used and fastest-growing type of computer. There are five types of personal com­
puters: desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and wearables. Desktop ­computers are 
small enough to fit on top of or alongside a desk yet are too big to carry around. 
(See Figure 1-9.) Laptop computers, also known as ­notebook ­computers, are por­
table and lightweight and fit into most briefcases. (See Figure 1-10.) Tablets, also 
known as tablet computers, are smaller, lighter, and generally less powerful than 
laptops. Like a laptop, tablets have a flat screen but typically do not have a stan­
dard keyboard. (See Figure 1-11.) Instead, tablets typically use a virtual keyboard 
that appears on the screen and is touch-sensitive.
	
	
Smartphones are the most widely used handheld computers. Smartphones are 
cell phones with wireless connections to the Internet and processing capabilities. 
(See ­Figure 1-12.) Other mobile computers include wearable devices like Apple’s 
watch. (See Figure 1-13.)
Personal Computer Hardware
Hardware for a personal computer system consists of a variety of different devices. 
This physical equipment falls into four basic categories: system unit, input/output, 
secondary storage, and communication. Because we discuss hardware in detail later 
in this book, here we will present just a quick overview of the four basic categories.
 • System unit: The system unit is a container that houses most of the electronic 
components that make up a computer system. Two important components of the 
system unit are microprocessors and memory. (See Figure 1-14.) The microprocessor 
controls and manipulates data to produce information. Memory is a holding area 
for data, instructions, and information. One type, random-access memory (RAM), 
holds the program and data that is currently being processed. This type of mem­
ory is sometimes referred to as temporary storage because its contents will typically 
be lost if the electric power to the computer is disrupted.
 • Input/output: Input devices translate data and programs that humans can under­
stand into a form that the computer can process. The most common input devices 
are the keyboard and the mouse. Output devices translate the processed informa­
tion from the computer into a form that humans can understand. The most com­
mon output device is the display, also known as a monitor.

chapter 1
 • Secondary storage: Unlike memory, secondary storage holds data and programs 
even after electric power to the computer system has been turned off. The most 
important kinds of secondary media are hard disks, solid-state storage, and optical discs.
Hard disks are typically used to store programs and very large data files. Using 
rigid metallic platters and read/write heads that move across the platters, data and 
information are stored using magnetic charges on the disk’s surface. In contrast, 
solid-state storage does not have any moving parts, is more reliable, and requires 
less power. It saves data and information electronically similar to RAM except that 
it is not volatile. (See Figure 1-15.) Optical discs use laser technology to store data 
and programs. Three types of optical discs are compact discs (CDs), digital versa­
tile (or video) discs (DVDs), and Blu-ray discs (BD).
 • Communication: At one time, it was uncommon for a personal computer system to 
communicate with other computer systems. Now, using communication devices, a 
personal computer routinely communicates with other computer systems located as 
near as the next office or as far away as halfway around the world, using the Inter­
net. A modem is a widely used communication device that modifies audio, video, 
and other types of data into a form that can be transmitted across the Internet.

Data
Data is raw, unprocessed facts, including text, numbers, images, and sounds. As we 
mentioned earlier, processed data becomes information. When stored electronically in 
files, data can be used directly as input for the system unit.
Four common types of files (see Figure 1-16) are
 • Document files, created by word processors to save documents such as memos, 
term papers, and letters.
 • Worksheet files, created by electronic spreadsheets to analyze things like budgets 
and to predict sales.
 • Database files, typically created by database management programs to contain 
highly structured and organized data. For example, an employee database file 
might contain all the workers’ names, Social Security numbers, job titles, and 
other related pieces of information.
 • Presentation files, created by presentation graphics programs to save presentation 
materials. For example, a file might contain audience handouts, speaker notes, 
and electronic slides.

Connectivity and the Mobile Internet
Connectivity is the capability of your personal computer to share information with 
other computers. Central to the concept of connectivity is the network. A network 
is a communications system connecting two or more computers. The largest network 
in the world is the Internet. It is like a giant highway that connects you to millions 
of other people and organizations located throughout the world. The web provides a 
multimedia interface to the numerous resources available on the Internet.
The Internet has driven the evolution of computers and their impact on our daily 
lives. In fact, the rate of technological change is accelerating at an ever faster pace. 
Along with the Internet, three things that are driving the impact of technology on our 
lives are cloud computing, wireless communication, and the Internet of Things.
Figure 1-17  Wireless communication devices

	
Information Technology, the Internet, and You	
15
 • Cloud computing uses the Internet and the web to shift many computer activities 
from a user’s computer to computers on the Internet. Rather than relying solely on 
their computer, users can now use the Internet to connect to the cloud and access 
more powerful computers, software, and storage.
 • Wireless communication has changed the way we communicate with one another. 
The rapid development and widespread use of wireless communication devices like 
tablets, smartphones, and wearable devices has led many experts to predict that 
wireless applications are just the beginning of the wireless revolution, a revolution 
that will dramatically affect the way we communicate and use computer technology.
 • The Internet of Things (IoT) is the continuing development of the Internet that 
allows everyday objects embedded with electronic devices to send and receive 
data over the Internet. It promises to connect all types of devices from computers 
to smartphones to watches to any number of everyday devices.
Wireless communication, cloud computing, and IoT are driving the mobile Internet. 
They promise to continue to dramatically affect the entire computer industry and how 
you and I will interact with computers and other devices. Each will be discussed in 
detail in the following chapters. For just a few of these mobile devices, see Figure 1-17.

purchase of a computer, an appendix—The Computer Buy­
er’s Guide—is provided at the end of this book. This guide 
provides a very concise comparison of desktops, laptops, 
tablets, and smartphones.
Privacy, Security, and Ethics
What about people? Experts agree that we as a society must 
be careful about the potential of technology to negatively 
affect our lives. Specifically, we need to be aware of how 
technology can impact our personal privacy and our environ­
ment. Also, we need to understand the role and the impor­
tance of organizational and personal ethics. These critical 
issues are integrated in every chapter of this book as well as 
extensively covered in Chapter 9.
Organizations
Almost all organizations rely on the 
quality and flexibility of their infor­
mation systems to stay competitive. 
As a member or employee of an 
organization, you will undoubtedly 
be involved in these information sys­
tems. In order to use, develop, mod­
ify, and maintain these systems, you 
need to understand the basic con­
cepts of information systems and 
know how to safely, efficiently, and 
effectively use computers. These 
concepts are covered throughout 
this book.
Changing Times
Are the times changing any faster now than they ever 
have? Almost everyone thinks so. Whatever the answer, 
it is clear we live in a fast-paced age. The Evolution of the 
Computer Age section presented at the end of this book 
tracks the major developments since computers were first 
introduced.
After reading this book, you will be in a very favorable 
position compared with many other people in industry today. 
You will learn not only the basics of hardware, software, con­
nectivity, the Internet, and the web but also the most cur­
rent technology. You will be able to use these tools to your 
advantage.
Using and Understanding Information 
Technology
The purpose of this book is to help you use and understand 
information technology. We want to help you become profi­
cient and to provide you with a foundation of knowledge so 
that you can understand how technology is being used today 
and anticipate how technology will be used in the future. 
This will enable you to benefit from six important information 
technology developments.
The Internet and the Web
The Internet and the web are considered to be the two most impor­
tant technologies for the 21st century. Understanding how to effi­
ciently and effectively use the Internet

People are the most important part of an information sys­
tem. This book contains several features to demonstrate 
how people just like you use computers. These features 
include the following:
 • Making IT Work for You presents several interesting 
and practical applications. Topics include using digital 
video editing and locating job opportunities.
 • Tips offer a variety of suggestions on such practical 
matters as how to improve slow computer perfor­
mance and how to protect your privacy while on the 
web.
 • Privacy marginal boxes discuss threats to your per­
sonal privacy and suggest ways to protect yourself.

environmental issues. The impact of computers and 
other technologies is more critical today than ever 
before.
 • Ethics boxes pose a variety of different ethical/unethi­
cal situations for your consideration.
 • Careers in IT presents job descriptions, employment 
demands, educational requirements, salary ranges, 
and advancement opportunities.
PEOPLE
The way to think about a personal computer is to realize 
that it is one part of an information system. There are sev­
eral parts of an information system:
 • People are an essential part of the system. The pur­
pose of information systems is to make people, or end 
users like you, more productive.
 • Procedures are rules or guidelines to follow when 
using software, hardware, and data. They are typi­
cally documented in manuals written by computer 
professionals.
 • Software (programs) provides step-by-step instruc­
tions to control the computer to convert data into 
information.
 • Hardware consists of the physical equipment. It is 
controlled by software and processes data to create 
information.
 • Data consists of unprocessed facts including text, 
numbers, images, and sound. Information is data that 
has been processed by the computer.
 • The Internet allows computers to connect and share 
information.
To efficiently and effectively use the computer, you need 
to understand information technology (IT), including 
software, hardware, data, and connectivity.

chapter 1
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the basic parts of an information system: people, 
procedures, software, hardware, data, and connectivity. You also need to understand the Internet and the web and to 
recognize the role of technology in your professional and personal life.
SOFTWARE
HARDWARE
Software, or programs, consists of system and application 
software.
System Software
System software enables application software to interact 
with computer hardware.
 • Operating systems coordinate resources, provide 
an interface, and run applications. Three types are 
embedded (real-time, RTOS), stand-alone, and 
network (NOS).
 • Utilities perform specific tasks to manage computer 
resources.
Application Software
Application software includes general-purpose, special­
ized, and mobile applications.
 • General purpose—widely used in nearly all career 
areas; programs include browsers, word processors, 
spreadsheets, database management systems, and pre­
sentation graphics.
 • Specialized—focus more on specific disciplines and 
occupations; programs include graphics and web 
authoring.
 • Apps (mobile apps, mobile applications)—designed 
for mobile devices; most popular are for text mes­
saging, Internet browsing, and connecting to social 
networks.
Hardware consists of electronic devices that can follow 
instructions to accept input, process the input, and pro­
duce information.
Types of Computers
Supercomputer, mainframe, midrange (server), and personal 
computers (PCs) are four types of computers. Personal com­
puters can be desktop, laptop (notebook computer), tablet, 
smartphone, and wearable.
Personal Computer Hardware
There are four basic categories of hardware devices.
 • System unit contains electronic circuitry, including 
microprocessors and memory. Random-access 
memory (RAM) holds the program and data currently 
being processed.
 • Input/output devices are translators between humans 
and computers. Input devices include the keyboard 
and mouse. The most common output device is the 
computer display (monitor).
 • Secondary storage holds data and programs. Typical 
media include hard disks, solid-state storage, and 
optical discs (CD, DVD, and Blu-ray).
 • Communication devices allow personal computers to 
communicate with other computer systems. Modems 
modify audio, video, and other types of data for trans­
mission across the Internet.

DATA
Data is the raw unprocessed facts about something. Com­
mon file types include
 • Document files created by word processors.
CONNECTIVITY AND MOBILE 
INTERNET
Connectivity describes the ability of end users to use 
resources well beyond their desktops. Central to the 
concept of connectivity is the network or communication 
system connecting two or more computers. The Internet 
is the world’s largest computer network. The web 
provides a multimedia interface to resources available on 
the Internet.
Along with the Internet, three other things are driving 
the impact of technology:
 • Cloud computing uses the Internet and the web to 
shift many computer activities from a user’s computer 
to computers on the Internet.
 • Wireless revolution has changed the way we commu­
nicate and use computer technology. Wireless devices 
include tablets, smartphones, and watches.
 • The Internet of Things (IoT) is the continuing devel­
opment of the Internet that allows everyday objects 
embedded with electronic devices to send and receive 
data over the Internet.

chapter 2
The Internet and the Web
The Internet was launched in 1969 when the United States funded a project that 
developed a national computer network called Advanced Research Project Agency 
Network (ARPANET). The Internet is a large network that connects together smaller 
networks all over the globe. The web, also known as the World Wide Web or WWW, 
was introduced in 1991. Prior to the web, the Internet was all text—no graphics, ani­
mations, sound, or video. The web made it possible to include these elements. It pro­
vided a multimedia interface to resources available on the Internet.
The first generation of the web, known as Web 1.0, focused on linking exist­
ing information. In this generation search programs, like Google Search, were cre­
ated to provide links to websites containing specific words or phrases. In 2001, the 
second generation, Web 2.0, evolved to support more dynamic content creation 
and social interaction. Facebook is one of the best-known Web 2.0 applications. 
Web 3.0 is the current generation. It focuses on applications that automatically 
prepare personalized content for users. For example, Google Now uses data from 
the web (e.g., an individual’s calendar of planned activities, weather reports, traf­
fic reports, etc.), searches for interrelationships among the data (e.g., the effect of 
weather and traffic on an individual’s planned daily commute to work), and auto­
matically presents relevant information to the user (e.g., sends an early morning 
message to the individual’s smartphone regarding expected bad weather and/or 
traffic delays). See Figure 2-1.
It is easy to get the Internet and the web confused, but they are not the same thing. 
The Internet is the physical network. It is made up of wires, cables, satellites, and 
rules for exchanging information between computers connected to the network. Being 
connected to this network is often described as being online. The Internet connects 
millions of computers and resources throughout the world. The web is a multimedia 
interface to the resources available on the Internet. Every day over a billion users from 
Introduction
Want to communicate with a friend across town, in another state, or 
even in another country? Searching for a long-lost friend? Looking for 
travel or entertainment information? Perhaps you’re researching a term 
paper or exploring different career paths. Where do you start? For these 
and other information-related activities, most people use the Internet and 
the web.
The Internet is an interconnected mesh of computers and data lines 
that connects millions of people and organizations. It is the foundation of 
the digital revolution and allows people around the world to share words, 
images, and any digital file almost instantaneously. The web provides an 
easy-to-use interface to Internet resources. It has become an everyday tool 
for all of us to use.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be aware of the 
resources available on the Internet and the web. Additionally, you need to 
know how to access these resources, to effectively communicate electroni­
cally, to efficiently locate information, to understand electronic commerce, 
and to use web utilities.
Hi, I’m Sue, and I’m a webmaster. I’d like to 
talk with you about the Internet, the web, 
and electronic commerce, things that touch 
our lives every day. I’d also like to talk with 
you about the role the Internet plays with 
­Facebook, Google+, Linkedln, Twitter, and 
cloud computing.

nearly every country in the world use the Internet and the web. What are they doing? 
The most common uses are the following:
 • Communicating is by far the most popular Internet activity. You can exchange 
e-mail, photos, and videos with your family and friends from almost anywhere in 
the world. You can locate old friends and make new friends. You can join and lis­
ten to discussions and debates on a wide variety of special-interest topics.
 • Shopping is one of the fastest-growing Internet applications. You can window 
shop, look for the latest fashions, search for bargains, and make purchases.
 • Searching for information has never been more convenient. You can access some 
of the world’s largest libraries directly from your home computer. You can find the 
latest local, national, and international news.
 • Education or e-learning is another rapidly emerging web application. You can take 
classes on almost any subject. There are courses just for fun, and there are courses 
for high school, college, and graduate school credit. Some cost nothing to take and 
others cost a lot.
 • Entertainment options are nearly endless. You can find music, movies, magazines, 
and computer games. You will find live concerts, movie previews, book clubs, and 
interactive live games. To learn more about online entertainment, see Making IT 
Work for You: Online Entertainment on pages 30–31.
The first step to using the Internet and the web is to get connected, or to gain access 
to the Internet.

Making IT work for you
ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT
Are you one of the millions of people who regularly use their computers to watch their favorite television 
­programs, movies, and other video content? Many have “cut the cord” from their cable or satellite TV providers 
and have turned to online content. It’s easy and convenient. Typically, the content is provided by a subscription or a 
pay-as-you-go service. Users watch the content on their TVs or their computers (including tablets and smartphones).
Subscription Services  These services provide access to their library of videos for a fee. You can select and view as many of 
these videos as you want. Three of the most popular subscription services are Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime.
	1	 •	 Hulu and Amazon Prime offer 
streaming access to their online 
movie and TV video libraries. Hulu 
is the only subscription streaming 
service that offers current season 
programming. Netflix offers the 
largest library of movies and TV 
programs for a low monthly fee. 
Amazon Prime, a newer service, 
provides similar content for an 
annual fee.
	2	 •	 CNN, CBS News, and NBC offer 
live television content streamed 
directly to your computer for free.

31
	3	 •	 Spotify and Pandora offer online 
access to large music libraries. 
These services offer free versions 
for desktop and laptop computers 
that include advertisements. 
For a small monthly fee, other 
versions are available that 
eliminate advertisements and 
provide additional access to 
smartphones and tablets.
Pay-As-You-Go Services  These services pro­
vide online access to specific titles in their 
libraries for a charge. Amazon, iTunes, and 
Vudu are just a few of the companies that let 
you rent or purchase movies and TV programs. 
Movie rentals cost only a few dollars and can 
be viewed several times over a 24-hour period. 
The price can increase by one or two dollars 
for HD quality.
Viewing Video Content  Many people own 
Internet-ready TVs that will directly accept con­
tent from the Internet. Most Blu-ray disc play­
ers and many gaming consoles also provide 
this access. You can also purchase specialized 
devices like Roku, which will connect TVs to 
many of the services listed above.
Many viewers use their computer and a browser to display the video content. Also, 
many services provide apps for tablet and smartphone viewing.

32	
chapter 2
Internet Access
The Internet and the telephone system are similar—you can 
connect a computer to the Internet much like you connect a 
phone to the telephone system. Once you are on the Internet, 
your computer becomes an extension of what seems like a 
giant computer—a computer that branches all over the world. 
When provided with a connection to the Internet, you can use 
a browser program to search the web.
Providers
The most common way to access the Internet is through an 
Internet service provider (ISP). The providers are already con­
nected to the Internet and provide a path or connection for 
individuals to access the Internet.
The most widely used commercial Internet service providers 
use telephone lines, cable, and/or wireless connections. Some 
of the best-known providers in the United States are AT&T, 
Comcast, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon.
As we will discuss in Chapter 8, users connect to ISPs using 
one of a variety of connection technologies including DSL, 
cable, and wireless modems.
Browsers
Browsers are programs that provide access to web resources. This 
software connects you to remote computers; opens and trans­
fers files; displays text, images, and multimedia; and provides 
in one tool an uncomplicated interface to the Internet and web 
documents. Four well-known browsers are Apple Safari, Google 
Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. (See Figure 2-2.)
Figure 2-2  Browser
Are you getting the most out of your web browser? 
Here are a few suggestions to make you faster and 
more efficient.
		
Bookmarks/Favorites Bar: Most browsers have a 
bookmarks or favorites bar just below the address 
bar. Add your top 5 or 10 most-often-visited websites 
here. The next time you want to visit one of these 
sites, select it from the bookmarks/favorites list rather 
than entering the site’s URL.
		
Shortcuts: Keyboard shortcuts are often faster than 
using a mouse. Use the following: F5 (refresh); Alt + left 
arrow (back); Ctrl + T (new tab); Ctrl + W (close tab); 
Ctrl + Enter (adds “www” and “.com” to any domain 
name you type in the address bar).
		
Extensions/Add-Ons: Many browsers, such as Chrome 
and Firefox, allow users to install small, third-party 
programs that extend, or add to, the capabilities of the 
browser. These programs can perform a variety of tasks, 
from providing easy access to your cloud services to 
making it easier to capture information on a web page.
		
Configure Settings: All browsers have a settings or 
options page that provides many time-saving options. 
For example, you can set all the web pages that 
should open when you start your browser, or you 
can configure autocomplete options that help you to 
quickly fill out web forms.

For browsers to connect to resources, the location or address 
of the resources must be specified. These addresses are called 
uniform resource locators (URLs). All URLs have at least two 
basic parts.
 • The first part presents the protocol used to connect to the 
resource. As we will discuss in Chapter 8, protocols are 
rules for exchanging data between computers. The protocol 
https is used for web traffic and is one of the most widely 
used Internet protocols.
 • The second part presents the domain name. It indicates the specific address where 
the resource is located. In Figure 2-3 the domain is identified as www.mtv.com. 
The last part of the domain name following the dot (.) is the top-level domain 
(TLD). Also known as the web suffix, it typically identifies the type of organiza­
tion. For example, .com indicates a commercial site. (See Figure 2-4.)
Once the browser has connected to the website, a document file is sent back to your 
computer. This document typically contains Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), 
a markup language for displaying web pages. The browser interprets the HTML for­
matting instructions and displays the document as a web page. For example, when 
your browser first connects to the Internet, it opens up to a web page specified in 
the browser settings. Web pages present information about the site along with refer­
ences and hyperlinks or links that connect to other documents containing related 
­information—text files, graphic images, audio, and video clips.
There are various technologies used to provide highly interactive and animated 
websites. These technologies include
 • Cascading style sheets (CSS) are separate files referenced by or lines inserted into 
an HTML document that control the appearance of a web page. CSS help ensure 
that related web pages have a consistent presentation or look. Netflix uses CSS to 
visually connect all its web pages.
 • JavaScript is a language often used within HTML documents to trigger interac­
tive features, such as opening new browser windows and checking information 
entered in online forms. The Microsoft search engine Bing.com uses JavaScript 
to make its website more interactive and to assist its users by auto-filling search 
requests as they type content into the search box.
 • AJAX, an advanced use of JavaScript, is used to create interactive websites 
that respond quickly. Google Maps uses AJAX to make the maps fast loading, 
dynamic, and interactive.
 • Applets are programs that can be downloaded quickly and run by most browsers. 
They are used to display graphics, provide interactive games, and much more. For 
example, many of the online games at Yahoo! Games are JAVA applets.
Today it is common to access the Internet from a variety of mobile devices like 
smartphones and tablets. Special browsers called mobile browsers are designed to 
run on these portable devices. Unlike a traditional web browser that is typically dis­
played on a large screen, a mobile browser is displayed on a very small screen, and 
special navigational tools are required to conveniently view web content. The Apple 
iPhone, for example, enables you to “pinch” or “stretch” the screen with two fingers 
to zoom web content in and out. (See Figure 2-5.)

Web Utilities
Utilities are programs that make computing easier. Web utilities are specialized utility 
programs that make using the Internet and the web easier and safer. Some of these utili­
ties are browser-related programs that either become part of your browser or are executed 
from your browser. Others are designed to protect children from dangerous and inappro­
priate website material. File transfer utilities allow you to efficiently copy files to and from 
your computer across the Internet. Internet security suites enhance security and privacy.
Plug-ins
Plug-ins are programs that are automatically started and operate as a part of your 
browser. Many websites require you to have one or more plug-ins to fully experience 
their content. Some widely used plug-ins include
 • Acrobat Reader from Adobe—for viewing and printing a variety of standard forms 
and other documents saved in a special format called PDF.
Figure 2-6  QuickTime movie

 • Flash Player from Adobe—for viewing videos, animations, and other 
media.
 • QuickTime from Apple—for playing audio and video files. (See Figure 2-6.)
 • Windows Media Player from Microsoft—for playing audio files, video 
files, and much more.
Some of these utilities are included in many of today’s browsers and 
operating systems. Others must be installed before they can be used by 
your browser. To learn more about plug-ins and how to download them, 
visit some of the sites listed in Figure 2‑7.

particular, are concerned about children roaming unrestricted 
across the Internet. Filter programs allow parents as well as 
organizations to block out selected sites and set time limits. 
(See Figure  2-8.) Additionally, these programs can monitor 
use and generate reports detailing the total time spent on the 
Internet and the time spent at individual websites. For a list of 
some of the best-known filters, see Figure 2-9.
File Transfer Utilities
Using file transfer utility software, you can copy files to your 
computer from specially configured servers. This is called 
downloading. You also can use file transfer utility software to copy files from your 
computer to another computer on the Internet. This is called uploading. Three popu­
lar types of file transfer are FTP, web-based, and BitTorrent.
 • File transfer protocol (FTP) and secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) allow you 
to efficiently copy files to and from your computer across the Internet, and are 
frequently used for uploading changes to a website hosted by an Internet service 
provider. FTP has been used for decades and still remains one of the most popular 
methods of file transfer.
 • Web-based file transfer services make use of a web browser to upload and down­
load files. This eliminates the need for any custom software to be installed. A 
popular web-based file transfer service is Dropbox.com.
 • BitTorrent distributes file transfers across many different computers for more efficient 
downloads, unlike other transfer technologies whereby a file is copied from one com­
puter on the Internet to another. A single file might be located on dozens of individ­
ual computers. When you download the file, each computer sends you a tiny piece of 
the larger file, making BitTorrent well suited for transferring very large files. Unfortu­
nately, BitTorrent technology often has been used for distributing unauthorized cop­
ies of copyrighted music and video. For a summary of web utilities, see Figure 2-10.

ethics
Most agree that it is ethical and 
prudent to shield young children 
from violent or sexual Internet 
content by using software that 
filters such content. Some 
parents of older children have 
installed computer monitoring 
software that records all their 
children’s Internet activity. 
They believe this is warranted 
because they need to know 
what their kids are doing online. 
Do you believe it is ethical of 
parents to do this?

Internet Security Suites
An Internet security suite is a collection of utility programs designed to maintain your 
security and privacy while you are on the web. These programs control spam, protect 
against computer viruses, provide filters, and much more. You could buy each pro­
gram separately; however, the cost of the suite is typically much less. Two of the best-
known Internet security suites are McAfee’s Internet Security and Symantec’s Norton 
Internet Security. (See Figure 2-11.)

Communication
As previously mentioned, communication is the most popular Internet activity, and its 
impact cannot be overestimated. At a personal level, friends and family can stay in con­
tact with one another even when separated by thousands of miles. At a business level, 
electronic communication has become a standard way to stay in touch with suppliers, 
employees, and customers. Some popular types of Internet communication are e-mail, 
messaging, social networking, blogs, microblogs, webcasts, podcasts, and wikis.
E-mail
E-mail or electronic mail is the transmission of electronic messages over the Internet. A 
typical e-mail message has three basic elements: header, message, and signature. (See 
Figure 2-12.) The header appears first and typically includes the following information:
 • Addresses: E-mail messages typically display the addresses of the person or 
persons to whom the e-mail is sent. The e-mail message in Figure 2-12 is to 
dcoats@usc.edu, with a copy sent to aboyd@sdu.edu. E-mail 
addresses have two basic parts. (See Figure 2-13.) The first 
part is the user’s name and the second part is the domain 
name, which includes the top-level domain. In our example 
e-mail, dcoats is Dan’s user name. The server providing e-mail 
service for Dan is usc.edu. The top-level domain indicates that 
the provider is an educational institution.
 • Subject: A one-line description, used to present the topic of 
the message. Subject lines typically are displayed when a person checks his or her 
mailbox.
 • Attachments: Many e-mail programs allow you to attach files such as documents 
and images. If a message has an attachment, the file name typically appears on the 
attachment line.
The letter or message comes next. Finally, the signature identifies the sender. This 
information may include the sender’s name, address, and telephone number. For 
many business communications, the signature also includes the sender’s company 
name, address, and telephone number.

Did you know that using e-mail 
is good for the environment? 
Writing letters and attaching 
files using e-mail reduce the 
amount of paper sent via postal 
mail. In addition, managing your 
financial and utilities accounts 
on the web is also healthy for 
the environment as it reduces 
the amount of paper bills you 
receive at home.

chapter 2
There are two basic types of e-mail systems: client-based and web-based.
 • Client-based e-mail systems require a special program known as an e-mail client 
to be installed on your computer. Before you can begin e-mailing, you need to run 
the e-mail client from your computer, which communicates with the e-mail service 
provider. Two of the most widely used e-mail clients are Apple’s Mail and Micro­
soft’s Outlook.
 • Web-based e-mail systems do not require an e-mail program to be installed on 
your computer. Once your computer’s browser connects to an e-mail service pro­
vider, a special program called a webmail client is run on the e-mail provider’s 
computer and then you can begin e-mailing. This is known as webmail. Most 
Internet service providers offer webmail services. Three free webmail service pro­
viders are Google’s Gmail, Microsoft’s Hotmail, and Yahoo!’s Yahoo!Mail.
For individual use, webmail is more widely used because it frees the user from 
installing and maintaining an e-mail client on every computer used to access e-mail. 
With webmail, you can access your e-mail from any computer anywhere that has Inter­
net access.
E-mail can be a valuable asset in your personal and professional life. However, like 
many other valuable technologies, there are drawbacks too. Americans receive billions 
of unwanted and unsolicited e-mails every year. This unwelcome mail is called spam. 
While spam is indeed a distraction and nuisance, it also can be dangerous. For exam­
ple, computer viruses or destructive programs are often attached to unsolicited e-mail. 
Computer viruses and ways to protect against them will be discussed in Chapter 4.
In an attempt to control spam, antispam laws have been added to our legal sys­
tem. For example, CAN-SPAM requires that every marketing-related e-mail provide 
an opt-out option. When the option is selected, the recipient’s e-mail address is to 
be removed from future mailing lists. 
Failure to do so results in heavy fines. 
This approach, however, has had mini­
mal impact since over 50 percent of all 
spam originates from servers outside the 
United States. A more effective approach 
to controlling spam has been the devel­
opment and use of spam blockers, also 
known as spam filters. Most e-mail pro­
grams provide limited spam-blocking 
capabilities. Additionally, powerful spe­
cialized spam-blocking programs are 
available. Many of these programs are 
free, including SPAMfighter and Intego 
Personal Antispam for Mac.
Messaging
While e-mail was one of the first and is one of the most popular electronic messaging 
systems, other messaging systems have followed. Two of the best known are text mes­
saging and instant messaging.
 • Text messaging, also known as texting or SMS (short message service), is the 
process of sending a short electronic message, typically less than 160 characters, 
using a wireless network to another person, who views the message on a mobile 
device such as a smartphone. Today, billions of people send text messages every 
day. It has become one of the most widely used ways to send very short messages 
from one individual to another. While text messaging was originally limited to 
characters, you can now send images, video, and sound using a variation of SMS 
known as MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service). Although popular and conve­
nient, there are downsides to using this technology in the wrong context. A great 
Are you tired of sorting through an inbox full of spam? Here are 
a few spam-reducing suggestions:
		
Keep a low profile. Many spammers collect e-mail addresses from personal web 
pages, social networking sites, and message boards. Be cautious when posting 
your address.
		
Use caution when giving out your address. Many companies collect and sell 
e-mail addresses to spammers. Be sure to read the privacy policy of a site 
before providing your address.
		
Don’t ever respond to spam. Many are a trick to validate active e-mail 
addresses. These addresses are worth more to spammers, who then sell the 
addresses to other spammers.
		
Use antispam and filter options. Most e-mail programs and web-based e-mail 
services have antispam and filter options that can be configured. Use them.

deal of attention has been directed toward texting while driving. A study by Car 
and Driver concluded that texting while driving had a greater negative impact on 
driver safety than being drunk. Several states have passed laws prohibiting texting 
while driving.
 • Instant messaging (IM) allows two or more people to contact each other via direct, 
live communication. (See Figure 2-14.) To use instant messaging, you register with 
an instant messaging service, such as Facebook or Google+, and then specify a 
list of friends. Whenever you connect to the Internet, your IM service is notified. 
It then notifies you of all your friends who are available to chat and notifies your 
friends who are online that you are available. You can then send messages directly 
back and forth to one another. Most instant messaging programs also include 
video conferencing features, file sharing, and remote assistance. Many businesses 
routinely use these instant messaging features. Two of the most popular instant 
messaging services are Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts.
Figure 2-14  Instant messaging
Social Networking
Social networking is one of the fastest-growing and most significant Web 2.0 applica­
tions. Social networking sites focus on connecting people and organizations that share 
a common interest or activity. These sites typically provide a wide array of tools that 
facilitate meeting, communicating, and sharing. There are hundreds of social network­
ing sites. Three of the best known are Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn.
 • Facebook was initially launched by a student at Harvard University for college 
students in 2004. By 2008 it was the most widely used social networking site. It 
now has a billion users worldwide. Facebook provides a wide array of features and 
applications including instant messaging, photo and video sharing, games, and 
much more.

chapter 2
There are three basic categories of Facebook users: individuals, businesses, and 
communities.
Individuals create Facebook Profiles, which may include photos, lists of per­
sonal interests, contact information, and other personal information. (See Fig­
ure 2-15.) In general, these profiles are available to friends, family members, and 
others who may be searching for old friends, lost relatives, or people who share a 
common interest. Facebook profiles are easy to create and to update.
Businesses create Facebook Pages to promote products and services. Public fig­
ures such as politicians and entertainers frequently use Facebook Pages to connect 
to their constituents and fans. Facebook Pages have become a standard way for 
promoters, musicians, and other celebrities to promote themselves.
Communities of individuals who share a common interest often create 
­Facebook groups. These groups allow a number of people to come together online 
to share information and discuss specific subjects. Typically, groups are organized 
around topics, events, or ideas. Facebook Pages are widely used by clubs and polit­
ical organizations to coordinate activities and share information.
 • Google+ also known as Google Plus, was launched in 2011. It is a combination 
of some of Google Inc.’s previously existing services with some new services. 
These new services include Circles for grouping individuals according to com­
mon interests or other criteria and Hangouts for communicating with up to 
10 people at a time.
Facebook and Google+ offer similar services. Facebook has been around lon­
ger and has many more users. Google+, however, offers integration with other 
Google services including Google Docs, Chat, and Calendar.
 • LinkedIn started in 2003 and has become the premier business-oriented social 
networking site. Although not nearly as large as Facebook or Google+, it is the 
largest social networking site focusing on business professionals. It has well over 
100 million users. LinkedIn provides tools to maintain business contacts, develop 
extended business networks, research individual businesses, search for job oppor­
tunities, and more.
There are many social networking sites, each with its own unique features and interac­
tions. For a list of some of the most popular sites, see Figure 2-16.
privacy
Have you ever seen one of 
those funny or not-so-funny 
embarrassing personal videos 
on the Internet? Unless you are 
careful, you could be starring 
in one of those videos. Without 
privacy settings, images and 
videos posted to these sites 
can be viewed and potentially 
reposted for all to see. If a 
social networking friend were 
to post an embarrassing video 
of you to Facebook, would all 
your friends be able to see it?

or potential employers? To

Blogs, Microblogs, Webcasts, Podcasts, and Wikis
In addition to social networking sites, there are other Web 2.0 applications 
that help ordinary people communicate across the web including blogs, micro­
blogs, webcasts, podcasts, and wikis. These communication alternatives offer 
greater flexibility and security; however, they are often more complex to set up 
and maintain.
Many individuals create personal websites, called blogs or web logs, to keep 
in touch with friends and family. Blog postings are time-stamped and arranged 
with the newest item first. Often, readers of these sites are allowed to comment. 
Some blogs are like online diaries with personal information; others focus on 
information about a hobby or theme, such as knitting, electronic devices, or 
good books. Although most are written by individual bloggers, there are also 
group blogs with multiple contributors. Some businesses and newspapers also 
have started blogging as a quick publishing method. Several sites provide tools 
to create blogs. Two of the most widely used are Blogger and WordPress. (See 
Figure 2-17.)
A microblog publishes short sentences that take only a few seconds to write, 
rather than long stories or posts like a traditional blog. Microblogs are designed 
to keep friends and other contacts up to date on your interests and activities. The 
most popular microblogging site, Twitter, enables you to add new content from your 
browser, instant messaging application, or even a mobile phone. Over 250 active 
users send over 500 million Twitter messages, also known as tweets, each day.
Both webcasts and podcasts deliver media content such as music and movies over 
the Internet to your computer. Webcasts use streaming technology in which audio 
and video files are continuously downloaded to your computer while you are listen­
ing to and/or viewing the file content. After a webcast has been completed, there are 
no files remaining on your computer. Webcasts typically broadcast live events. For

example, the popular website YouTube.com as well as other sites routinely webcast 
live movie premiers and sporting events.
Podcasts do not use streaming technology. Before a podcast can be run, the media 
files have to be downloaded and saved to your computer. Once downloaded, the files 
can be run to listen to music or watch a movie as often as you would like. The media 
files can also be transferred from your computer to a media player such as an iPod. 
Podcasts are widely used to download music, tutorials, and educational training.
A wiki is a website specially designed to allow visitors to use their browser to add, 
edit, or delete the site’s content. “Wiki” comes from the Hawaiian word for fast, which 
describes the simplicity of editing and publishing through wiki software. Wikis sup­
port collaborative writing in which there isn’t a single expert author, but rather a 
community of interested people that builds knowledge over time. Perhaps the most 
famous example is Wikipedia, an online encyclopedia, written and edited by any­
one who wants to contribute, that has millions of entries in over 20 languages. (See 
Figure 2-18.)
Creating blogs and wikis are examples of web authoring. We will discuss web 
authoring software in detail in Chapter 3.

Search Tools
The web can be an incredible resource, providing information on nearly any topic 
imaginable. Are you interested in music? Writing a paper on the environment? Look­
ing for a movie review? Trying to locate a long-lost friend? Information sources related 
to these questions, and much, much more, are available on the web.
With over 20 billion pages and more being added daily, the web is a massive col­
lection of interrelated pages. With so much available information, locating the precise 
information you need can be difficult. Fortunately, a number of organizations called 
search services operate websites that can help you locate the information you need.
Search services maintain huge databases relating to information provided on the 
web and the Internet. The information stored at these databases includes addresses, 
content descriptions or classifications, and keywords appearing on web pages and 
other Internet informational resources. Special programs called spiders continu­
ally look for new information and update the search services’ databases. Addition­
ally, search services provide special programs called search engines that you can use to 
locate specific information on the web.
Search Engines
Search engines are specialized programs that assist you in locating information 
on the web and the Internet. To find information, you go to a search service’s 
website and use its search engine. See Figure 2-19 for a list of commonly used 
search engines.
To use a search website, you enter a keyword or phrase reflecting the informa­
tion you want. The search engine compares your entry against its database and 
returns a list of hits, or sites that contain the keywords. Each hit includes a link to 
the referenced web page (or other resource) along with a brief discussion of the 
information contained at that location. Many searches result in a large number of 
hits. For example, if you were to enter the keyword music, you would get billions 
of hits. Search engines order the hits according to those sites that most likely contain the 
information requested and present the list to you in that order, usually in groups of 10.
Since each search service maintains its own database, the hits returned by one 
search engine will not necessarily be the same hits returned by another search engine. 
Therefore, when researching a topic, it is best to use more than one search engine.
Specialized Search Engines
Specialized search engines focus on subject-specific websites. Specialized sites 
can potentially save you time by narrowing your search. For a list of just a few 
selected specialized search engines, see Figure 2-20. For example, let’s say you 
are researching a paper about the environment. You could begin with a general 
search engine like Google. Or you could go to a search engine that specializes 
specifically on the environment, such as www.ecoearth.info.
To locate other specialized search engines, use a search service and enter 
the topic area followed by specialized search engine. For example, entering 
sports specialized search engine will return several search engines dedicated spe­
cifically to sports information.
Content Evaluation
Search engines are excellent tools to locate information on the web. Be careful, 
however, how you use the information you find. Unlike most published material found 
in newspapers, journals, and textbooks, not all the information you find on the web 
has been subjected to strict guidelines to ensure accuracy. In fact, anyone can publish 
content on the web. Many sites, such as Wikipedia.org, allow anyone to post new 
material, sometimes anonymously and without critical evaluation.

To evaluate the accuracy of information you find on the web, consider the following:
 • Authority. Is the author an expert in the subject area? Is the site an official site for 
the information presented, or is the site an individual’s personal website?
 • Accuracy. Has the information been critically reviewed for correctness prior to 
posting on the web? Does the website provide a method to report inaccurate infor­
mation to the author?
 • Objectivity. Is the information factually reported, or does the author have a bias? 
Does the author appear to have a personal agenda aimed at convincing or chang­
ing the reader’s opinion?
 • Currency. Is the information up to date? Does the site specify the date when the 
site was updated? Are the site’s links operational? If not, the site is most likely not 
being actively maintained.

Electronic commerce, also known as e-commerce, is the buying and selling of goods 
over the Internet. Electronic commerce is fast-growing and widely used in part 
because it provides incentives for both buyers and sellers. From the buyer’s perspec­
tive, goods and services can be purchased at any time of day or night from any location 
that has an Internet connection. From the seller’s perspective, the costs associated 
with owning and operating a retail outlet can be eliminated. Another advantage is 
reduced inventory. Traditional stores maintain an inventory of goods in their stores 
and periodically replenish this inventory from warehouses. With e-commerce, there is 
no in-store inventory and products are shipped directly from warehouses.
While there are numerous advantages to e-commerce, there are disadvantages as 
well. Some of these disadvantages include the inability to provide immediate delivery 
of goods, the inability to “try on” prospective purchases, and questions relating to 
the security of online payments. Although these issues are being addressed, very few 
observers suggest that e-commerce will replace bricks-and-mortar businesses entirely. 
It is clear that both will coexist and that e-commerce will continue to grow.
Just like any other type of commerce, electronic commerce involves two parties: 
businesses and consumers. There are three basic types of electronic commerce:
 • Business-to-consumer (B2C) commerce involves the sale of a product or service 
to the general public or end users. It is the fastest-growing type of e-commerce. 
Whether large or small, nearly every existing corporation in the United States 
provides some type of B2C support as another means to connect to customers. 
Because extensive investments are not required to create traditional retail outlets 
and to maintain large marketing and sales staffs, e-commerce allows start-up com­
panies to compete with larger established firms. The three most widely used B2C 
applications are for online banking, financial trading, and shopping. Amazon.com 
is one of the most widely used B2C sites.
 • Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) commerce involves individuals selling to individuals. 
C2C often takes the form of an electronic version of the classified ads or an auction. 
Web auctions are similar to traditional auctions except that buyers and sellers seldom, 
if ever, meet face to face. Sellers post descriptions of products at a website, and buyers

submit bids electronically. Like traditional auctions, sometimes the bidding becomes 
highly competitive and enthusiastic. One of the most widely used auction sites is 
eBay.com. For a list of some of the most popular web auction sites, see Figure 2-21.
 • Business-to-business (B2B) commerce involves the sale of a product or service 
from one business to another. This is typically a manufacturer-supplier relation­
ship. For example, a furniture manufacturer requires raw materials such as wood, 
paint, and varnish.

Security
The two greatest challenges for e-commerce are (1) developing fast, secure, and reli­
able payment methods for purchased goods and (2) providing convenient ways to sub­
mit required information such as mailing addresses and credit card information.
The two basic payment options are by credit card and by digital cash:
 • Credit card purchases are faster and more convenient than check purchases. Credit 
card fraud, however, is a major concern for both buyers and sellers. We will discuss 
this and other privacy and security issues related to the Internet in Chapter 9.
 • Digital cash is the Internet’s equivalent to traditional cash. Buyers purchase digital 
cash from a third party (a bank that specializes in electronic currency) and use it to 
purchase goods. (See Figure 2-22.) Sellers convert the digital cash to traditional cur­
rency through the third party. Although not as convenient as credit card purchases, 
digital cash is more secure. For a list of digital cash providers, see Figure 2-23.

Cloud Computing
Typically, application programs are owned by individuals or organizations and stored 
on their computer system’s hard disks. As discussed in Chapter 1, cloud computing 
uses the Internet and the web to shift many of these computer activities from the 
user’s computer to other computers on the Internet.
While some suggest that cloud computing is merely a marketing term designed to 
promote new products, many others see cloud computing as a new model for com­
puting that frees users from owning, maintaining, and storing software and data. It 
provides access to these services from anywhere through an Internet connection. Sev­
eral prominent firms are aggressively pursuing this new concept. These firms include 
Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft to name just a few.
The basic components of cloud computing are clients, the Internet, and service 
providers. (See Figure 2-24.)
 • Clients are corporations and end users who want access to data, programs, and 
storage. This access is to be available anywhere and anytime that a connection to 
the Internet is available. End users do not need to buy, install, and maintain appli­
cation programs and data.

 • The Internet provides the connection between the 
clients and the providers. Two of the most critical fac-
tors determining the efficiency of cloud computing are 
(1) the speed and reliability of the user’s access to the 
Internet and (2) the Internet’s capability to provide safe 
and reliable transmission of data and programs.
 • Service providers are organizations with computers 
connected to the Internet that are willing to provide 
access to software, data, and storage. These provid-
ers may charge a fee or may be free. For example, 
Google Drive Apps provide free access to programs 
with capabilities similar to Microsoft’s Word, Excel, 
and PowerPoint. (See Figure 2-25.)
In the following chapters, you will learn more about 
the services provided through cloud computing. You 
will also learn about security and privacy challenges 
associated with cloud computing.

The Internet of Things
The Internet is becoming more and more a part of our lives. As discussed in Chapter 1, the 
Internet of Things (IoT) is the continuing development of the Internet that allows every-
day objects embedded with electronic devices to send and receive data over the Internet. 
These everyday objects include smartphones, wearable devices, and even coffeemakers. 
For example, the Fitbit is a bracelet that monitors health 
data and sends that data to your smartphone or personal 
web page. (See Figure 2-26.)
A Web 3.0 application can (1) access the Fitbit data, 
(2) combine that data with other data on the web,  
(3) process the data, and (4) send information back 
to another device. For example, Apple’s Health App, 
a Web 3.0 application, can access your Fitbit data, 
combine it with other related health data, analyze the 
data, and report back to you through your smartphone. 
These reports provide information about your health 
including your heart rate, steps taken each day, and an 
estimate of daily calories burned. (See Figure 2-27.)

Careers in IT
Webmasters develop and maintain websites and resources. The job may 
include backup of the company website, updating resources, or devel­
opment of new resources. Webmasters are often involved in the design 
and development of the website. Some webmasters monitor traffic on 
the site and take steps to encourage users to visit the site. Webmasters 
also may work with marketing personnel to increase site traffic and may 
be involved in development of web promotions.
Employers look for candidates with a bachelor’s or associate’s degree 
in computer science or information systems and knowledge of common 
programming languages and web development software. Knowledge of 
HTML and CSS is considered essential. Those with experience using 
web authoring software and programs like Adobe Illustrator and Adobe 
Flash are often preferred. Good communication and organizational 
skills are vital in this position.
Webmasters can expect to earn an annual salary of $59,000 to 
$82,000. This position is relatively new in many corporations and tends 
to have fluid responsibilities. With technological advances and increas­
ing corporate emphasis on a web presence, experience in this field 
could lead to managerial opportunities.
Now that you’ve learned about the Internet, 
the web, and electronic commerce, I’d like to 
tell you about my career as a webmaster.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Your Car’s Dashboard as a Powerful, 
Internet-Connected Computing Device
Do you often wish that you could shop online or make din­
ner plans while your car drove itself? Would you like your 
car to use the Internet to suggest a better route, or stream 
a music list tailored to your likes? A computer located within 
the vehicle already governs many of your car’s functions. That 
computer is responsible for various safety and diagnostic fea­
tures. Recently, cars have begun offering Internet access for 
driving directions, streaming audio, and cell phone connectiv­
ity. In the future, cars will drive themselves and seamlessly 
integrate into our digital lives. Technology has been making 
better cars, and will continue 
to evolve to improve our lives 
as we look to the future.
Apple and Google have 
created partnerships with 
automobile manufacturers to 
place iPad or Android devices 
into the center of a vehicle’s 
main console. Cars can con­
nect to Wi-Fi access points 
or 4G networks to reach the 
Internet as the modern smart­
phone does. These develop­
ments allow your vehicle to 
provide many services that 
normally require a smart­
phone but in a safer and more 
integrated manner.
One of the immediate 
benefits 
involves 
quick 
access to information. Drivers get real-time traffic data, 
weather, store hours, and much more. Also available is 
access to all the apps that you expect to have. One exam­
ple is the Pandora service, which allows you to stream 
free, ad-supported music from stations you create your­
self. Why pay for satellite radio or listen to stations that 
you don’t enjoy when you can access your favorite online 
music services right from your dashboard? Another ben­
efit is the entertainment of your passengers or children. 
Some vehicles include screens that face the back seats, 
allowing parents to play DVDs for their children. Internet-
connected vehicles allow individuals already paying for an 
online streaming video service to give their children access 
to this enormous library of cartoons and movies right in the 
vehicle. In fact, with a tabletlike interface, your child can 
choose from a preset selection of movies or educational 
games, depending on his or her mood.
Now, such a tool at your fingertips has the risk of becom­
ing a distraction while you’re driving. There is no question 
that safety features must be built in to prevent accidents 
from occurring. Luckily, there is already a piece of technol­
ogy that prevents the driver from ever having to touch the 
dashboard: voice recognition. 
In the same way that Apple’s “Siri” has revolutionized the 
way individuals interact with their iPhones, similar systems 
are installed in the new dash­
boards. Drivers simply speak 
their commands to get the 
information they need and 
to use the vehicle’s controls. 
­Furthermore, this computer 
system uses existing tech­
nologies that recognize and 
speak English to the user. 
This will allow the driver to 
hear e-mail messages, social 
network updates, and today’s 
news and weather while driv­
ing to work.
Some 
companies 
have 
already taken steps in imple­
menting this technology. Ford 
uses voice recognition in 
some of its vehicles with a fea­
ture called Sync with MyFord 
Touch. Audi has added 3G connectivity in its new A7 model. 
However, the real breakthroughs will come when you can drive 
in safety while being as productive as when you are on your 
laptop. Advances in dictation software will one day allow users 
to easily dictate e-mail responses. Changes in sensors and 
automated driving will allow users to devote less attention to 
driving and more to getting things done. Google and Mercedes 
are currently testing self-driving cars, and they may be avail­
able in the next ten years. When it does, do you see yourself 
paying for this upgrade in your next car? Would you be com­
fortable allowing a car to drive itself while you worked on your 
laptop or tablet?

INTERNET AND WEB
Internet
Launched in 1969 with ARPANET, the Internet consists 
of the actual physical network.
Web
Introduced in 1991, the web (World Wide Web, WWW) 
provides a multimedia interface to Internet resources. Three 
generations: Web 1.0 (existing information), Web 2.0 (con­
tent creation and social interaction), and Web 3.0 (automatic 
personalized content).
Common Uses
The most common uses of the Internet and the web 
include
 • Communication—the most popular Internet activity.
 • Shopping—one of the fastest-growing Internet 
activities.
 • Searching—access libraries and local, national, and 
international news.
 • Education—e-learning or taking online courses.
 • Entertainment—music, movies, magazines, and com­
puter games.
VISUAL SUMMARY
The Internet, the Web, and Electronic Commerce
INTERNET ACCESS
Once connected to the Internet, your computer seemingly 
becomes an extension of a giant computer that branches 
all over the world.
Providers
Internet service providers are connected to the Internet, 
providing a path for individuals to access the Internet. 
Connection technologies include DSL, cable, and wire­
less modems.
Browsers
Browsers provide access to web resources. Some related 
terms are
 • URLs—locations or addresses to web resources; two 
parts are protocol and domain name; top-level domain 
(TLD) or web suffix identifies type of organization.
 • HTML—commands to display web pages; hyperlinks 
(links) are connections.
Technologies providing interactive, animated websites 
include cascading style sheets, or CSS (to control the 
appearance of web pages); JavaScript (to trigger interac­
tive features); AJAX (to create quick response interactive 
websites; and applets (to display graphics, provide inter­
active games, and more).
Mobile browsers run on portable devices.

	
The Internet, the Web, and Electronic Commerce 	
51
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be aware of resources available on the Internet and web, to be 
able to access these resources, to effectively communicate electronically, to efficiently locate information, to understand 
electronic commerce, and to use web utilities.
WEB UTILITIES
Web utilities are specialized utility programs that make 
using the Internet and the web easier and safer.
Plug-ins
Plug-ins are automatically loaded and operate as part of a 
browser. Many websites require specific plug-ins to fully 
experience their content. Some plug-ins are included in 
many of today’s browsers; others must be installed.
Filters
Filters are used by parents and organizations to block cer­
tain sites and to monitor use of the Internet and the web.
File Transfer Utilities
File transfer utilities copy files to (downloading) and from 
(uploading) your computer. There are three types:
 • File transfer protocol (FTP) and secure file transfer 
protocol (SFTP) allow you to efficiently copy files 
across the Internet.
 • BitTorrent distributes file transfers across many differ­
ent computers.
 • Web-based file transfer services make use of a web 
browser to upload and download files.
Internet Security Suite
An Internet security suite is a collection of utility pro­
grams designed to protect your privacy and security on 
the Internet.
COMMUNICATION
E-mail
E-mail (electronic mail) is the transmission of electronic 
messages. There are two basic types of e-mail systems:
 • Client-based e-mail systems use e-mail clients 
installed on your computer.
 • Web-based e-mail systems use webmail clients located 
on the e-mail provider’s computer. This is known as 
webmail.
A typical e-mail has three basic elements: header 
(including address, subject, and perhaps attachment), 
message, and signature.
Spam is unwanted and unsolicited e-mail that may 
include a computer virus or destructive programs often 
attached to unsolicited e-mail. Spam blockers, also known as 
spam ­filters, are programs that identify and eliminate spam.
Messaging
While e-mail is the most widely used, there are two other 
messaging systems:
 • Text messaging, also known as texting and SMS (short 
message service), is a process of sending short electronic 
messages typically less than 160 characters. Texting while 
driving is very dangerous and illegal in several states.
 • Instant messaging (IM)—supports live communication 
between friends. Most instant messaging programs 
also include videoconferencing features, file sharing, 
and remote assistance.

COMMUNICATION
Social Networking
Social networks connect individuals to one another. Many 
sites support a variety of different activities. Three of the 
best known are Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn.
 • Facebook provides access to Facebook Profiles, Face­
book Pages, and Facebook groups.
 • Google+ provides access to Circles and Hangouts.
 • LinkedIn is a premier business-oriented social net­
working site.
Blogs, Webcasts, and Wikis
Other sites that help individuals communicate across the 
web are blogs, microblogs, webcasts, podcasts, and wikis.
 • Blogs (web logs) are typically personal websites to 
keep in touch with friends and family. Some are like 
online diaries. Businesses, newspapers, and others 
also use blogs as a quick publishing method.
 • Microblogs, unlike traditional blogs, use only short 
sentences that take only a few seconds to write. 
Twitter is the most popular microblogging site. 
A Twitter message is known as a tweet.
 • Webcasts deliver media content over the Internet. 
Using streaming technology (audio and video files 
continuously downloaded while you are listening to 
and/or viewing the file content), no files remain on 
your computer at the conclusion of the webcast.
 • Podcasts, like webcasts, deliver media content but do 
not use streaming technology. Before content can be 
accessed, the entire media file has to be downloaded 
and saved to your computer.
 • A wiki is a website designed to allow visitors to use 
their browsers to add, edit, or delete the site’s content. 
Wikis are often used to support collaborative writing. 
Wikipedia is one of the most popular wikis.

SEARCH TOOLS
Search services maintain huge databases relating to web­
site content. Spiders are programs that update these 
databases.
Search Engines
Search engines are specialized programs to help locate 
information. To use, enter a keyword or phrase and a list 
of hits, or links to references, is displayed.
Specialized Search Engines
Specialized search engines focus on subject-specific 
websites.
Content Evaluation
To evaluate the accuracy of information found on the web, 
consider the following:
 • Authority. Is the author an expert? Is the site official 
or does it present one individual’s or organization’s 
opinion.
 • Accuracy. Has the information been critically 
reviewed? Does the site provide a method to report 
inaccurate information?
 • Objectivity. Is the information factual or does the 
author have a bias? Does the author appear to have 
a personal agenda to convince or form a reader’s 
opinion?
 • Currency. Is the information up to date? Does the site 
specify when information is updated? Are the site’s 
links operational?

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is the buying and 
selling of goods over the Internet. Three basic types are
 • Business-to-consumer (B2C) commerce, which 
involves sales from business to the general public.
 • Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) commerce, which 
involves sales between individuals. Web auctions are 
similar to traditional auctions except buyers and sell­
ers rarely, if ever, meet face to face.
 • Business-to-business (B2B) commerce, which involves 
sales from one business to another, typically a 
­manufacturer-supplier relationship.
CLOUD COMPUTING
Cloud computing uses the Internet and the web to shift 
many computer activities from the user’s computer to 
other computers on the Internet.
Components
There are three basic components to cloud computing:
 • Clients are corporations and end users who want 
access to data, programs, and storage.
 • The Internet provides the connection between the cli­
ents and providers. Two critical factors are the speed 
and reliability of the user’s access and the Internet’s 
capability to provide safe and reliable access.
 • Service providers are organizations with computers 
connected to the Internet that are willing to provide 
access to software, data, and storage.
Security
The two greatest challenges for e-commerce are the devel­
opment of
 • Safe, secure payment methods. Two types are credit 
cards and digital cash.
 • Convenient ways to provide required information.
INTERNET OF THINGS
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a continuing development 
of the Internet allowing everyday objects embedded with 
electronic devices to send and receive data over the Inter­
net. Objects include smartphones, wearable devices, and 
even coffeemakers. For example:
 • The Fitbit is an IoT device (bracelet) that monitors 
health data and sends that data to a smartphone or 
personal web page.
 • Apple’s Health App is a Web 3.0 application that can 
access Fitbit data, combine it with other related health 
data, analyze the data, and report back to you through 
a smartphone.
The Apple Health App reports provide information 
about users’ health including heart rate, steps taken each 
day, and an estimate of daily calories burned.
CAREERS in IT
Webmasters develop and maintain websites and web 
resources. A bachelor’s or associate’s degree in computer 
science or information systems and knowledge of com­
mon programming languages and web development soft­
ware are required. Salary range is $59,000 to $82,000.

Introduction
Not long ago, trained specialists were required to perform many of the 
operations you can now do with a personal computer. Market analysts 
used calculators to project sales. Graphic artists created designs by hand. 
Data processing clerks created electronic files to be stored on large com­
puters. Now you can do all these tasks—and many others—with a personal 
computer and the appropriate application software.
Think of the personal computer as an electronic tool. You may not con­
sider yourself very good at typing, calculating, organizing, presenting, or 
managing information. However, a personal computer can help you do all 
these things and much more. All it takes is the right kinds of software.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the 
capabilities of general-purpose application software, which includes word 
processors, spreadsheets, presentation programs, and database manage­
ment systems. You also need to know about integrated packages and soft­
ware suites.
Hi, I’m James, and I’m a software engineer. 
I’d like to talk with you about application 
software and how to access these traditional 
programs using cloud computing.
“
”
Application Software
As we discussed in Chapter 1, there are two kinds of software. System software works 
with end users, application software, and computer hardware to handle the majority 
of technical details. Application software can be described as end user software and is 
used to accomplish a variety of tasks.
Application software can be divided into three categories. One category, general-
purpose applications, includes word processing programs, spreadsheets, presenta­
tion graphics, and database management systems. Another category, specialized 
­applications, includes thousands of other programs that tend to be more narrowly 
focused and used in specific disciplines and occupations. The third category, mobile 
apps, is add-on features or programs typically designed for smartphones and tablets.
User Interface
A user interface is the portion of the application that allows you to control and to inter­
act with the program. Depending on the application, you can use a mouse, a pointer, 
a keyboard, and/or your voice to communicate with the application. Most general-­
purpose applications use a mouse and a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays 
graphical elements called icons to represent familiar objects. The mouse controls a 
pointer on the screen that is used to select items such as icons. Another feature is the 
use of windows to display information. A window is simply a rectangular area that can 
contain a document, program, or message. (Do not confuse the term window with the 
various versions of Microsoft’s Windows operating systems, which are programs.) More 
than one window can be opened and displayed on the computer screen at one time.
Traditionally, most software programs use a system of menus, toolbars, and dialog 
boxes. (See Figure 3-1.)
 • Menus present commands that are typically displayed in a menu bar at the top of 
the screen.
 • Toolbars typically appear below the menu bar and include small graphic ele­
ments called buttons that provide shortcuts for quick access to commonly used 
commands.
 • Dialog boxes provide additional information and request user input.

	
Application Software	
63
Many applications, and Microsoft applications in particular, use an interface known 
as the Ribbon GUI to make it easier to find and use all the features of an application; 
this GUI uses a system of ribbons, tabs, and galleries. (See Figure 3-2.)
 • Ribbons replace menus and toolbars by organizing commonly used commands 
into a set of tabs. These tabs display command buttons that are the most relevant 
to the tasks being performed by the user.
 • Tabs are used to divide the ribbon into major activity areas. Each tab is then orga­
nized into groups that contain related items. Some tabs, called contextual tabs, 
appear only when they are needed and anticipate the next operation to be per­
formed by the user.

chapter 3
 • Galleries simplify the process of making a selection from a list of alternatives. This 
is accomplished by graphically displaying the effect of alternatives before being 
selected.
Common Features
Most applications provide a variety of features to make entering/presenting, editing, 
and formatting documents easy. Some of the most common features include
 • Spell checker—looks for misspelled words.
 • Alignment—centers, right-aligns, or left-aligns numbers and characters.
 • Fonts and font sizes (perhaps using character effects)—specify the size and style of 
entered numbers and text.
 • Character effects—provide a variety of different typefaces, such as bold or 
italics.
 • Edit options—provide easy ways to edit text, such as cut, copy, and paste.

List three categories of application software.
What is a graphical user interface? What are windows, menus, toolbars, and dialog 
boxes?

Discuss some of the most common features in application programs.
General-Purpose Applications
As mentioned previously, general-purpose applications include word processors, 
spreadsheets, presentation graphics, and database management systems.
Word Processors
Word processors create text-based documents and are one of the most flexible and 
widely used software tools. All types of people and organizations use word processors 
to create memos, letters, and faxes. Organizations create newsletters, manuals, and 
brochures to provide information to their customers. Students and researchers use 
word processors to create reports.
Microsoft Word is the most widely used word processor. Other popular word pro­
cessors include Apple Pages, Google Docs, Corel WordPerfect, and OpenOffice Writer.
Assume that you have accepted a job as an advertising coordinator for Adventure 
Travel Tours, a travel agency specializing in active adventure vacations. Your primary 
responsibilities are to create and coordinate the company’s promotional materials, 
including flyers and travel reports. To see how you could use Microsoft Word as the 
advertising coordinator for the Adventure Travel Tours, see Figures 3-3 and 3-4.

Creating a Flyer
You have been asked to create a promotional advertising flyer. After discussing the flyer’s 
content and basic structure with your supervisor, you start to enter the flyer’s text. As you 
enter the text, the spelling checker and grammar checker catch some spelling and gram­
matical errors. Once the text has been entered, you proofread the text and then focus 
your attention on enhancing the visual aspects of the flyer. You add a photograph and 
experiment with different character and paragraph formats, including fonts, font sizes, 
colors, and alignments. 
Figure 3-3  Flyer
Spelling Checker
Correcting spelling and typing errors 
identified by the spelling checker 
creates an error-free and professional-
looking document.
Fonts and Font Size
Using interesting fonts and a 
large font size in the flyer’s 
title grabs the reader’s 
attention.
Center-Aligning
Center-aligning all of 
the text in the flyer 
creates a comfortable, 
balanced appearance.
Character Effects
Adding character effects 
such as bold and color makes 
important information stand 
out and makes the flyer more 
visually interesting.
Grammar Checker
Incomplete sentences, awkward wording, and incorrect punctuation 
are identified and corrections are offered by the grammar checker.

chapter 3
Creating a Report
Your next assignment is to create a report on Tanzania 
and Peru. After conducting your research, you start writ­
ing your paper. As you enter the text for the report, you 
notice that the AutoCorrect feature automatically cor­
rects some grammar and punctuation errors. Your report 
includes several figures and tables. You use the captions 
feature to keep track of figure and table numbers, to enter 
the caption text, and to position the captions. You use 
the footnote feature to assist in adding notes to further 
explain or comment on information in the report.
Finally, you prepare the report for printing by adding 
header and footer information. 
Figure 3-4  Report
Captions
Identifying figures with captions in a 
report makes the report easier to read 
and more professional.
AutoCorrect
As you enter text, you occasionally 
forget to capitalize the first word 
in a sentence. Fortunately, Auto-
Correct recognizes the error and 
automatically capitalizes the word.
Footnote
To include a note about Mt. Kilimanjaro, 
you use the footnote feature. This feature 
inserts the footnote superscript number 
and automatically formats the bottom of 
the page to contain the footnote text.
Header or Footer
Page numbers and other 
document-related infor­
mation can be included 
in a header or footer.

Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets organize, analyze, and graph numeric data such as budgets and finan­
cial reports. Once used exclusively by accountants, spreadsheets are widely used by 
nearly every profession. Marketing professionals analyze sales trends. Financial ana­
lysts evaluate and graph stock market trends. Students and teachers record grades and 
calculate grade point averages.
The most widely used spreadsheet program is Microsoft Excel. Other spreadsheet 
applications include Apple Numbers, Corel Quattro Pro, Google Sheets, and Open­
Office Calc.
Assume that you have just accepted a job as manager of the Downtown Internet Café. 
This café provides a variety of flavored coffees as well as Internet access. One of your 
responsibilities is to create a financial plan for the next year. To see how you could use 
Microsoft Excel as the manager for the Downtown Internet Café, see Figures 3-5 and 3-6.
Creating a Sales Forecast
Your first project is to develop a first-quarter sales forecast for the café. You begin by studying sales data and talking with sev­
eral managers. After obtaining sales and expense estimates, you are ready to create the first-quarter forecast. You start struc­
turing the worksheet by inserting descriptive text entries for the row and column headings. Next, you insert numeric entries, 
including formulas and functions to perform calculations. To test the accuracy of the worksheet, you change the values in some 
cells and compare the recalculated spreadsheet results with hand calculations. 
Figure 3-5  First-quarter 
forecast
Worksheets
Worksheets are used for a wide range of different applications. One of 
the most common uses is to create, analyze, and forecast budgets.
Text Entries
Text entries provide meaning 
to the values in the worksheet. 
The rows are labeled to 
identify the various sales and 
expense items. The columns 
are labeled to specify the 
months.
Functions
Functions are prewritten 
formulas. In this case, cell 
C22 (Total Expenses for 
February) contains the 
function SUM(C14:C21) 
rather than the formula = 
C14 + C15 + C16 + C17 + 
C18 + C19 + C20 + C21.
Cells
Cells can contain labels, numbers, formulas, 
and functions. A cell’s content is indicated 
by the row and column labels. For example, 
cell D16 contains a number for the Payroll 
expense expected for March.
Formulas
Formulas provide a way to 
perform calculations in the 
worksheet. In this case, cell C24 
contains the formula = C12 
(Total Sales for February) – C22 
(Total Expenses for February) 
and displays the result of the 
calculation for the Net Income 
for February.

chapter 3
Analyzing Your Data
After presenting the First-Quarter Forecast to the owner, you revise the format and 
expand the workbook to include worksheets for each quarter and an annual forecast sum­
mary. You give each worksheet a descriptive sheet name. At the request of the owner, you 
perform a what-if analysis to test the effect of different estimates for payroll, and you use 
a chart to visualize the effect. 
Figure 3-6  Annual forecast and analysis
Workbook
The first worksheet in a workbook 
is often a summary of the following 
worksheets. In this case, the first 
worksheet presents the entire 
year’s forecast. The subsequent 
worksheets provide the details.
Sheet Name
Each worksheet has a unique sheet 
name. To make the workbook easy to 
navigate, it is a good practice to always 
use simple yet descriptive names for 
each worksheet.
What-If Analysis
What-if analysis is a very powerful 
and simple tool to test the effects of 
different assumptions in a spreadsheet.
Chart
Once data is in the worksheet, it is 
very easy to chart the data. All you 
need to do is to select the data to 
chart, select the chart type, and add 
some descriptive text.

Presentation Graphics
Research shows that people learn better when information is presented visually. 
­Presentation graphics are programs that combine a variety of visual objects to create 
attractive, visually interesting presentations. They are excellent tools to communicate 
a message and to persuade people.
People in a variety of settings and situations use presentation graphics programs to 
make their presentations. For example, marketing managers use presentation graph­
ics to present proposed marketing strategies to their superiors. Salespeople use these 
programs to demonstrate products and encourage customers to make purchases. Stu­
dents use presentation graphics programs to create high-quality class presentations.
Six of the most widely used presentation graphics programs are Microsoft Power­
Point, Apple Keynote, Google Slides, Corel Presentations, OpenOffice Impress, and 
Prezi.
Assume that you have volunteered for the Animal Rescue Foundation, a local ani­
mal rescue agency. You have been asked to create a powerful and persuasive presenta­
tion to encourage other members from your community to volunteer. To see how you 
could use Microsoft PowerPoint, see Figure 3-7.
Creating a Presentation
You have been asked to create a powerful and persuasive presentation for the director of 
the foundation designed to encourage other members from your community to volunteer. 
The first step is to meet with the director of the foundation to determine the content of the 
presentation. Then using PowerPoint, you begin creating the presentation by selecting a pre­
sentation template and document theme. After entering the content, you add interest to the 
presentation by adding animation to selected objects and using slide transition effects. 
Figure 3-7  Presentation
Document Theme
To make your presentation 
more professional and eye-
catching, you select a document 
theme, built-in sets of colors, 
fonts, and effects that can be 
quickly applied to your entire 
presentation.
Templates
Templates provide an excellent way 
to quickly create a presentation 
by providing predesigned styles 
and layouts as well as suggested 
content based on the type of 
template you select.
Animation
To provide additional emphasis to items or show 
the information on a slide in phases, you add 
animation to text and objects. Finally, you use 
slide transition effects to animate the transition 
from one slide to the next.

Database Management Systems
A database is a collection of related data. It is the electronic equivalent of a file cabi­
net. A database management system (DBMS) or database manager is a program that 
sets up, or structures, a database. It also provides tools to enter, edit, and retrieve 
data from the database. All kinds of individuals use databases, from hospital admin­
istrators recording patient information to police officers checking criminal histories. 
­Colleges and universities use databases to keep records on their students, instructors, 
and courses. Organizations of all types maintain employee databases.
Four widely used database management systems designed for personal computers 
are Microsoft Access, Apple FileMaker, Google Obvibase, and OpenOffice Base.
Assume that you have accepted a job as an employment administrator for the Life­
style Fitness Club. To see how you could use Microsoft Access, see Figure 3-8.

Specialized Applications
While general-purpose applications are widely used in nearly every profession, spe­
cialized applications are widely used within specific professions. These programs 
include graphics programs and web authoring programs.
Graphics
Graphics are widely used by professionals in the graphic arts profession. They use 
desktop publishing programs, image editing programs, illustration programs, and 
video editors.
 • Desktop publishing programs, or page layout programs, allow you to mix text 
and graphics to create publications of professional quality. While word processors 
focus on creating text and have the ability to combine text and graphics, desktop 
publishers focus on page design and layout and provide greater flexibility. Profes­
sional graphic artists use desktop publishing programs to create documents such 
as brochures, newsletters, newspapers, and textbooks.
Popular desktop publishing programs include Adobe InDesign, Microsoft 
Publisher, and QuarkXPress. While these programs provide the capability to cre­
ate text and graphics, typically graphic artists import these elements from other 
sources, including word processors, digital cameras, scanners, image editors, illus­
tration programs, and image galleries.

Creating a Database
You have been asked to create an employee database to replace the club’s manual sys­
tem for recording employee data. The first step in creating the database management 
system is to plan. You study the existing manual system focusing on how and what data 
is collected and how it is used. Next, using Microsoft Access, one of the most widely 
used DBMS programs, you design the basic structure or organization of the new data­
base system to include a table that will make entering data and using the database more 
efficient. You create the table structure by specifying the fields and primary key field. To 
make the process faster and more accurate, you create a form and enter the data for each 
employee as a record in the table.

Primary Key
The primary key is the unique employee 
identification number. You considered using 
the last name field as the primary key but 
realized that more than one employee could 
have the same last name. Primary keys are 
often used to link tables.
Record
Each record contains information 
about one employee. A record 
often includes a combination of 
numeric, text, and object data 
types.
Form
Like printed paper forms, 
electronic forms should be 
designed to be easy to read and 
use. This form makes it easy to 
enter and view all employees’ 
data, including their photographs.
Fields
Fields are given field names that 
are displayed at the top of each 
table. You select the field names 
to describe their contents.
Table
Tables make up the basic structure 
of a relational database with columns 
containing field data and rows containing 
record information. This table records 
basic information about each employee, 
including name, address, and telephone 
number.

 • Image editors, also known as photo editors, are specialized 
graphics programs for editing or modifying digital photo­
graphs. They are often used to touch up photographs to 
remove scratches and other imperfections. The photographs 
consist of thousands of dots or pixels that form images often 
referred to as bitmap or raster images. One limitation of bit­
map images, however, is that when they are expanded, the 
images can become pixelated, or jagged on the edges. For 
example, when the letter A in Figure 3-9 is expanded, the bor­
ders of the letter appear jagged, as indicated by the expanded 
view.
Popular image editors include Adobe Photoshop, Corel 
PaintShop Pro, GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program), 
and Windows Photo Gallery.
Figure 3-9  Bitmap image
Letter A
Expanded view
 • Illustration programs, also known as drawing programs, are used to create and 
edit vector images. While bitmap images use pixels to represent images, vector 
images, also known as vector illustrations, use geometric shapes or objects. These 
objects are created by connecting lines and curves avoiding the pixeleted or ragged 
edges created by bitmap images. (See Figure 3-10.) Because these objects can be 
defined by mathematical equations, they can be rapidly and easily resized, col­
ored, textured, and manipulated. An image is a combination of several objects.
Illustration programs are often used for graphic design, page layout, and creat­
ing sharp artistic images. Popular illustration programs include Adobe Illustrator, 
CorelDRAW, and Inkscape.
 • Video editors are used to edit videos to enhance quality and appearance. Once 
used only by Hollywood professionals, video editors are now widely used to edit 
high-quality video captured using smartphones and other devices. You can readily 
add special effects, music tracks, titles, and on-screen graphics.
Just a few years ago, video editors were used only by professionals with expen­
sive specialized hardware and software. Now, there are several free or inexpensive 
editors designed to assist the amateur videographer. Three well-known video edi­
tors are Windows Live Movie Maker, Apple iMovie, and YouTube Video Editor. 
(See Figure 3-11.)

ethics
Image editing software has made 
it easy to alter any photo or 
video to correct for a variety of 
different imperfections. However, 
some professionals can use 
these programs to significantly 
manipulate the content or 
meaning of a photo or video. 
Such changes are often intended 
to influence the opinions 
or emotions of the viewer. 
Supporters argue that this type 
of editing is acceptable and is 
just another way to express an 
opinion or feeling from an editor. 
Critics note that this type of 
image and video manipulation is 
unethical because it intentionally 
misleads the viewer and 
often creates unobtainable or 
unhealthy definitions of beauty.

Video Game Design Software
Have you ever thought about designing a video game? While it may initially be unre­
alistic to create an immersive 3D world like Skyrim or BioShock, you can experiment 
and create some impressive games on your own with the right software. The first step 
is to visualize the game by thinking about the game’s length and plot. The second step 
is to choose the right video game design software.
Video game design software will help you organize your thoughts and guide you 
through the game design process including character development and environmen­
tal design. There are many choices from free software to very expensive software 
designed for professional game designers. Some of the better-known free or inexpen­
sive video game design software are YoYo GameMaker, Stencyl, Flixel, and Unity. (See 
Figure 3-12.)
Web Authoring Programs
There are over a billion websites on the Internet, and more are being added every 
day. Corporations use the web to reach new customers and to promote their prod­
ucts. Individuals create online diaries or commentaries, called blogs. Creating a site is 
called web authoring.
Almost all websites consist of interrelated web pages. As we mentioned in 
Chapter 2, web pages are typically HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS 
(cascading style sheets) documents. With knowledge of HTML and a simple text 
­editor, you can create web pages. Even without knowledge of HTML, you can create 
simple web pages using a word processing package like Microsoft Word.
More specialized and powerful programs, called web authoring programs, are 
typically used to create sophisticated commercial sites. Also known as web page 
editors and HTML editors, these programs provide support for website design and 
HTML coding. Some web authoring programs are WYSIWYG (what you see is what 
you get) editors, which means you can build a page without interacting directly with 
HTML code. WYSIWYG editors preview the page described by HTML code. Widely 
used web authoring programs include Adobe Dreamweaver and Microsoft Expres­
sion Web.

Other Specialized Applications
There are numerous other specialized applications including accounting, personal 
finance, and project management applications. Accounting applications such as 
Intuit QuickBooks help companies record and report their financial operations. 
Personal financial applications such as Quicken Starter Edition help individuals 
track their personal finances and investments. Project management software like 
Microsoft Project is widely used in business to help coordinate and plan complicated 
projects.

Mobile Apps
Mobile apps or mobile applications are add-on programs for a variety of mobile devices 
including smartphones and tablets. Sometimes referred to simply as apps, mobile apps 
have been widely used for years. The traditional applications include address books, 
to-do lists, alarms, and message lists. With the introduction of smartphones, tablets, 
and wireless connections to the Internet, mobile capabilities have exploded. Now, any 
number of applications are available.

mobile devices are ever expanding. There are over 500,000 apps just for Apple’s 
iPhone alone. Some of the most widely used are for listening to music, viewing video, 
social networking, shopping, and game playing.
 • Music. For many, their smartphone and/or tablet is their primary source for 
music. The mobile app Pandora offers free streaming music with ads and playlists that 
you can customize in a limited way. Spotify is another streaming music service that 
requires a monthly fee but offers direct control of what music you listen to and no ads.
 • Video. With faster data speeds and higher resolution screens, smartphones and 
tablets are becoming a favorite way to watch TV shows, movies, or video clips. The 
YouTube app offers access to free online videos such as movie trailers and video 
blogs. The Netflix app provides access to more professional videos for a fee.
 • Social networking. Mobile apps are ideal for sharing a picture while on vacation, 
checking in at your favorite coffee shop, or sending out invites to a last-minute 
party. The Facebook mobile app offers many of the features of the Facebook web­
site, with additional features that take advantage of a mobile device’s camera and 
GPS capability. The Instagram app provides a more specialized and artistic flair by 
focusing on sharing photos.
Did you know that using mobile 
devices and apps can benefit 
the environment by reducing 
the production of paper? There 
are many apps that allow you 
to read electronic books and 
reference materials that would 
otherwise have been printed 
using a large amount of paper. 
Furthermore, many apps allow 
you to write digital notes so 
that you don’t have to buy paper 
notebooks or notepads.

 • Shopping. A recent poll concluded that well over half of 
all smartphone users in the United States regularly use 
their phones for shopping. By scanning a product’s bar-
code, shopping apps search for the product and provide 
price comparisons as well as product reviews. Using 
Amazon’s Price Check app, all you need to do is take a 
picture of the product.
 • Games. One of the most popular activities on smart-
phones and tablets is game playing. Some of these 
games are quite basic, are free, and include in-app 
optional purchases. For example, Crossy Road chal-
lenges game players to assist a character across obsta-
cles (roads, rivers, grass, and train tracks) without 
succumbing to obstacles such as rivers, trees, trains 
and cars. Players have the option to buy additional 
characters. Some other games are quite complex and 
are not free. For example, Dragon Quest V is a popular 
role playing game (RPG) where gamers create their 
own villages, fight off intruders, and form alliances with millions of other play-
ers online. (See Figure 3-13.)
Many apps are written for a particular type of mobile device and will not run on 
other types. For example, an app designed for Apple’s iPhone may not work with 
Google’s Android.
App Stores
An app store is typically a website that provides access to specific mobile apps that can 
be downloaded either for a nominal fee or free of charge. Two of the best-known stores  
are Apple’s App Store and Google Play. (See Figure 3-14.) Although most of the best-
known app stores specialize in applications for a particular line of mobile device, other 
less well-known stores provide apps for a wide variety of mobile devices. For a list of 
some more widely used app stores, see Figure 3-15.

privacy
Did you know that many mobile 
phone apps track a phone’s 
physical location? For example, 
iOS’s Siri and Android’s Google 
Now use a smartphone’s GPS 
to track locations to customize 
interactions with users. 
The smartphone’s location 
is monitored, stored, and 
potentially used for a variety 
of different objectives. Privacy 
advocates argue that many 
people are unaware that they 
may be tracked in this manner 
and that their movements are 
recorded for possible later use. 
App developers argue that the 
objective is simply to improve 
users’ interactions with their 
smartphones. What do you 
think?

Software Suites
A software suite is a collection of separate application programs bundled together and 
made available as a group. Four types of suites are office suites, cloud suites, special­
ized suites, and utility suites.
Office Suites
Office suites, also known as office software suites and productivity suites, contain 
general-purpose application programs that are typically used in a business situation. 
Productivity suites commonly include a word processor, spreadsheet, database man­
ager, and a presentation application. The best known is Microsoft Office. Other well-
known productivity suites are Apple iWork and OpenOffice.
Cloud Computing
Cloud suites or online office suites are stored at a server on the Internet and are avail­
able anywhere you can access the Internet. Documents created using online applica­
tions can also be stored online, making it easy to share and collaborate on documents 
with others. One downside to cloud applications is that you are dependent on the 
server providing the application to be available whenever you need it. For this rea­
son, when using online applications, it is important to have backup copies of your 
documents on your computer and to have a desktop office application available to use. 
Popular online office suites include Google Docs, Zoho, and Microsoft Office 365 and 
Office for iPad. (See Figure 3-16.) To learn more about one of the most widely used 
online office suites, see Making IT Work for You: Google Docs on page 78.
Specialized and Utility Suites
Two other types of suites that are more narrowly focused are specialized suites and 
utility suites.
 • Specialized suites focus on specific applications. These include graphics suites 
like CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X6, financial planning suites like Moneytree 
­Software’s TOTAL Planning Suite, and many others.
 • Utility suites include a variety of programs designed to make computing easier 
and safer. Two of the best known are Norton SystemWorks and Norton Internet 
Security Suite. (Utility suites will be discussed in detail in Chapter 4.)

Careers in IT
Software engineers analyze users’ needs and create application soft­
ware. Software engineers typically have experience in programming 
but focus on the design and development of programs using the prin­
ciples of mathematics and engineering.
A bachelor’s or an advanced specialized associate’s degree in com­
puter science or information systems and an extensive knowledge of 
computers and technology are required by most employers. Internships 
may provide students with the kinds of experience employers look 
for in a software engineer. Those with specific experience with web 
applications may have an advantage over other applicants. Employers 
typically look for software engineers with good communication and 
analytical skills.
Software engineers can expect to earn an annual salary in the range 
of $55,000 to $71,000. Starting salary is dependent on both experience 
and the type of software being developed. Experienced software engi­
neers are candidates for many other advanced careers in IT.
Now that you have learned about application 
software, I’d like to tell you about my career as 
a software engineer.

Making IT work for you
GOOGLE DOCS
Do you need to create and collaborate with others on a document, presentation, or spreadsheet? Do you 
need access from different computers in different locations? If so, an online office suite, such as Google 
Docs, might be just what you need. (Please note that the web is continually changing, and some of the spe­
cifics presented below may have changed.)
Creating a Document  You must have a free Google account in order to start creating and sharing documents. To get started:
	 1	 •	 Go to docs.google.com. If you are not currently signed in or you do 
not have a Google account, click the Sign in button and follow the 
appropriate instructions.
	2	 •	 Once you are signed in, click the Menu button in the upper left of the 
page. Select Docs to see existing word processing documents.
	3	 •	 Click the Create New Documents button in the lower right of the page 
(a red circle with a  white + in the center).
	4	 •	 Start typing in the blank document. You will notice many familiar 
buttons in the toolbar above the document area.
	5	 •	 Click the Untitled document area at the top left, and you will be 
prompted to enter a name for the document.
	6	 •	 Close the browser tab (or window) in order to close the document.
You may have noticed that there is no save option. This is because your document is 
automatically being saved as you work on it.
Sharing a Document  Any document that you create can be shared with one or 
more individuals. Those individuals can be granted read-only access, or they could be 
allowed to edit the document, even at the same time that you are working on it. To 
share a document:
	 1	 •	 With the document open, click the Share button at the 
top right.
	2	 •	 Type in the e-mail addresses of those with whom you 
wish to share the document.
	3	 •	 To the right of this text box, select the permission these 
individuals will have for the document.
	4	 •	 Click the Done button to finish.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Next-Generation User Interfaces
Have you ever given a presentation and wished you could interact 
with the whiteboard like a computer screen? Wouldn’t it be great 
to be able to have a digital whiteboard with different pens for 
collaborating on projects? The traditional mouse and keyboard 
work great for interacting with a computer, but sometimes it 
would be nice to have more options. Recently, touch screens and 
voice recognition offer new ways to interface. In the future, larger 
touch screens that can identify different users will allow for mul­
tiple people to work on the same 
screen, and recent innovations 
in video capture technology may 
have computers leaving the desk­­
top and entering the yoga studio. 
Technology has been making 
better interfaces, and will con­
tinue to evolve to improve our 
lives as we look to the future.
There are several chal­
lenges with designing inter­
faces. First is the simple fact 
that individuals have varying 
preferences. Some might pre­
fer to interact with a friend 
through text messages, while 
others prefer voice communi­
cation. Therefore, it is doubt­
ful that a single interface will 
become dominant. The second 
challenge is ergonomic in nature; that is, it must be comfort­
able to use.
Since tablets and smartphones have touch-screen inter­
faces, many people believe that all home and business com­
puters will eventually have them too. In futuristic movies 
individuals use both hands to interact with a large screen. 
Such a setup allows a person to interact with multiple objects 
at the same time. The only problem with a multi-touch, multi-
gesture screen is that it is not comfortable to extend our 
arms for prolonged periods. Knowing this, many companies 
are looking toward large, interactive surfaces that perform 
the same function while lying flat on a desk. Microsoft has 
already developed a product called “PixelSense” that acts like 
a large, interactive table. It responds to both human interac­
tions and objects that are placed on top of it. Although costs 
prevent it from replacing the desktop of today, the strain on a 
person’s neck from looking down could prevent it from being 
used for long periods of time.
The ideal use of PixelSense appears to be activities involv­
ing collaboration and teamwork. Voice recognition is another 
form of input that is already available, but much improvement 
is needed. Computers are becoming better at following spe­
cific voice commands, but they cannot engage in everyday 
conversation or follow complex requests. Researchers in the 
field of artificial intelligence are working to improve natu­
ral language processing to help computers understand our 
writing and speech. When 
that is fully developed, you 
will be able to speak to your 
computer in the same way 
you would speak to another 
person.
Both cameras and soft­
ware are becoming sophisti­
cated enough to observe and 
interpret our movements and 
gestures. The “Kinect” system 
for the Xbox One has the abil­
ity to use body movements to 
interact with various games 
and fitness programs, includ­
ing ones that analyze and cor­
rect form during yoga ­routines. 
Researchers at MIT are also 
working with cameras that can 
observe our gestures and the 
physical objects we interact with in order to communicate with 
a computer. In the future, computers could become so attuned 
to our emotions and expressions that they will be able to see 
our frustration with the current operation and take various cor­
rective actions to relieve that frustration.
The next step in computer interaction may be some­
thing called “Augmented Reality.” Microsoft HoloLens offers 
glasses that you can see through but can also act as a moni­
tor that can overlay text and images onto the real world. 
Through the HoloLens, and sophisticated body tracking 
cameras, your real world may become populated with virtual 
assistants, digital notes, and interactive how-to manuals.
Which type of interface do you currently enjoy using 
the  most? Do you think that touch-screen interfaces will 
replace keyboards? Do you believe augmented reality will 
become the keyboard and mouse of the future?

VISUAL SUMMARY
Application Software
APPLICATION SOFTWARE
The three categories of application software are general 
purpose, specialized, and mobile.
User Interface
You control and interact with a program using a user inter­
face. A graphical user interface (GUI) uses icons selected 
by a mouse-controlled pointer. A window contains a doc­
ument, program, or message. Software programs with a 
traditional GUI have
 • Menus—present commands listed on the 
menu bar.
 • Toolbars—contain buttons for quick access to 
commonly used commands.
 • Dialog box—provides additional information or 
requests user input.
Software programs with a Ribbon GUI have
 • Ribbons—replace menus and toolbars.
 • Tabs—divide ribbons into groups. Contextual tabs 
automatically appear when needed.
 • Galleries—graphically display alternatives before they 
are selected.
Common Features
Common features include spell checkers, alignment, fonts 
and font sizes, character effects, and edit options.
GENERAL-PURPOSE APPLICATIONS
General-purpose applications include word processors, 
spreadsheets, presentation graphics, and database man­
agement systems.
Word Processors
Word processors create text-based documents. Individuals 
and organizations use word processors to create memos, 
letters, and faxes. Organizations also create newsletters, 
manuals, and brochures to provide information to their 
customers. Microsoft Word is the most widely used word 
processor. Others include Apple Pages, Google Docs, 
Corel WordPerfect, and OpenOffice Writer.
Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets organize, analyze, and graph numeric data 
such as budgets and financial reports. They are widely 
used by nearly every profession. Microsoft Excel is the 
most widely used spreadsheet program. Others include 
Apple Numbers, Corel Quattro Pro, Google Sheets, and 
OpenOffice Calc.

	
Application Software	
81
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the capabilities of general-purpose and specialized 
application software. Additionally, you need to know about mobile applications and software suites.
Presentation Graphics
Presentation graphics are programs that combine a variety 
of visual objects to create attractive, visually interesting pre­
sentations. They are excellent tools to communicate a mes­
sage and to persuade people. People in a variety of settings 
and situations use presentation graphics programs to make 
their presentations more interesting and professional. Six 
of the most widely used presentation graphics programs 
are Microsoft PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, Google Slides, 
Corel Presentations, OpenOffice Impress, and Prezi.
Database Management Systems
A database is a collection of related data. A database 
­management system (DBMS) or database manager is a 
program that structures a database. It provides tools to 
enter, edit, and retrieve data from the database. Organi­
zations use databases for many purposes including main­
taining employee records. Four widely used database 
management systems designed for personal computers 
are Microsoft Access, Apple FileMaker, Google Obvibase, 
and OpenOffice Base.
SPECIALIZED APPLICATIONS
Specialized applications are widely used within specific 
professions. They include graphics programs, video game 
design software, and web authoring programs.
Graphics Programs
Graphics programs are used by graphic arts professionals.
 • Desktop publishing programs (page layout programs) 
mix text and graphics to create professional-quality 
publications.
 • Image editors (photo editors) edit digital photographs 
consisting of thousands of dots or pixels that form bit­
map or raster images.
 • Illustration programs (drawing programs) create and 
edit vector images. Vector images (vector illustrations) 
use geometric shapes.
 • Video editors edit video to enhance quality and 
appearance.
Video Game Design Software
Video game design software helps to organize thoughts 
and guide users through the game design process includ­
ing character development and environmental design.
Web Authoring Programs
Web authoring is the process of creating a website. Indi­
viduals create online diaries called blogs. Web author­
ing programs (web page editors, HTML editors) create 
sophisticated commercial websites. Some are WYSIWYG 
(what you see is what you get) editors.

characters. Dragon Quest V is a role playing game 
(RPG) where gamers create their own villages, fight 
off intruders, and form alliances with millions of other 
players online.
App Stores
An app store is typically a website that provides access 
to specific mobile apps that can be downloaded either for 
a nominal fee or free of charge. Two of the best-known 
stores are Apple’s App Store and Google Play. Most of the 
best-known app stores specialize in applications for a par­
ticular line of mobile device, other less well-known stores 
provide apps for a wide variety of mobile devices.

software failures.
This chapter covers the things you need to know to protect your 
computer and data today and to prepare you for tomorrow, including:
• Desktop operating systems—discover how operating systems 
control and protect desktop and laptop computers.
• Mobile operating systems—learn the key features of the operat­
ing systems that control tablets and cell phones.
• Utilities—protect your computer from viruses and perform 
important maintenance tasks.

Introduction
When most people think about computers, they think about surfing the web, 
writing papers, e-mailing friends, chatting online, making presentations, and 
any number of other valuable applications. We typically think about appli­
cations and application software. Computers and computer applications 
have become a part of the fabric of our everyday lives. Most of us agree 
that they are great . . . as long as they are working.
We usually do not think about the more mundane and behind-the-
scenes computer activities: loading and running programs, coordinating 
networks that share resources, organizing files, protecting our comput­
ers from viruses, performing periodic maintenance to avoid problems, 
and controlling hardware devices so that they can communicate with 
one another. Typically, these activities go on behind the scenes without 
our help.
That is the way it should be, and the way it is, as long as everything is 
working perfectly. But what if new application programs are not compat­
ible and will not run on our current computer system? What if we get a 
computer virus? What if our hard disk fails? What if we buy a new digital 
video camera and can’t store and edit the images on our computer system? 
What if our computer starts to run slower and slower?
These issues may seem mundane, but they are critical. This chapter 
covers the vital activities that go on behind the scenes. A little knowledge 
about these activities can go a long way to making your computing life eas­
ier. To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand 
the functionality of system software, including operating systems, utility 
programs, and device drivers.
Hi, I’m Ann, and I’m a computer support 
specialist. I’d like to talk with you about sys­
tem software, programs that do a lot of the 
work behind the scenes so that you can run 
applications and surf the web. I’d also like to 
talk about the mobile operating systems that 
control smartphones and other small portable 
computers.

System Software
End users use application software to accomplish specific tasks. For example, we 
use word processing programs to create letters, documents, and reports. However, 
end users also use system software. System software works with end users, appli­
cation software, and computer hardware to handle the majority of technical details. 
For example, system software controls where a word processing program is stored in 
memory, how commands are converted so that the system unit can process them, and 
where a completed document or file is saved. (See Figure 4-1.)
System software is not a single program. Rather, it is a collection or a system of 
programs that handle hundreds of technical details with little or no user intervention. 
System software consists of four types of programs:
 • Operating systems coordinate computer resources, provide an interface between 
users and the computer, and run applications.
 • Utilities perform specific tasks related to managing computer resources.
 • Device drivers are specialized programs that allow particular input or output 
devices to communicate with the rest of the computer system.
 • Language translators convert the programming instructions written by programmers 
into a language that computers understand and process.

Operating Systems
An operating system is a collection of programs that handle many of the technical 
details related to using a computer. In many ways, an operating system is the most 
important type of computer program. Without a functioning operating system, your 
computer would be useless.
Functions
Every computer has an operating system, and every operating system performs a 
­variety of functions. These functions can be classified into three groups:
 • Managing resources: Operating systems coordinate all the computer’s resources 
including memory, processing, storage, and devices such as printers and monitors. 
They also monitor system performance, schedule tasks, provide security, and start 
up the computer.
 • Providing user interface: Operating systems allow users to interact with ­application 
programs and computer hardware through a user interface. Originally, ­operating 
systems used a character-based interface in which users communicated with the 
operating system through written commands such as “Copy A: report.txt C:”. Today,  
most operating systems use a graphical user interface (GUI). As we discussed in 
Chapter 3, a graphical user interface uses graphical elements such as icons and 
windows. A new feature available with many operating systems is voice recogni-
tion. This allows users to interact with voice commands.

chapter 4
 • Running applications: Operating systems load and run applications such as word 
processors and spreadsheets. Most operating systems support multitasking, or the 
ability to switch between different applications stored in memory. With multitask­
ing, you could have Word and Excel running at the same time and switch easily 
between the two applications. The program that you are currently working on is 
described as running in the foreground. The other program or programs are run­
ning in the background.
Features
Starting or restarting a computer is called booting the system. There are two ways to 
boot a computer: a warm boot and a cold boot. A warm boot occurs when the com­
puter is already on and you restart it without turning off the power. A warm boot can 
be accomplished in several ways. For many computer systems, they can be restarted 
by simply pressing a sequence of keys. Starting a computer that has been turned off is 
called a cold boot.
You typically interact with the operating system through the graphical user inter­
face. Most provide a place, called the desktop, that provides access to computer 
resources. (See Figure 4-2.) Some important features common to most operating sys­
tems and application programs include:
 • Icons—graphic representations for a program, type of file, or function.
 • Pointer—controlled by a mouse, trackpad, or touch screen, the pointer changes 
shape depending on its current function. For example, when shaped like an arrow, 
the pointer can be used to select items such as an icon.
Did you know that some 
operating systems help 
protect the environment? 
Recent versions of Microsoft’s 
Windows operating system have 
various power management 
features that reduce energy 
consumption. For example, 
Windows will dim your screen 
and put your computer in sleep 
mode after a certain amount 
of time. The Energy Star 
program from the Environmental 
Protection Agency estimates 
that these features can save you 
up to $50 in electricity costs 
per year, which in turn helps 
reduce carbon emissions that 
affect the environment.

 • Windows—rectangular areas for displaying information and running programs.
 • Menus—provide a list of options or commands that can be selected.
 • Tabs—divide menus into major activity areas such as format and page layout.
 • Dialog boxes—typically provide information or request input.
 • Help—provides online assistance for operating system functions and procedures.
 • Gesture control—ability to control operations with finger movements, such as 
swiping, sliding, and pinching.
Most offices have filing cabinets that store important documents in folders. Simi­
larly, most operating systems store data and programs in a system of files and folders. 
Files are used to store data and programs. Related files are stored within a folder, 
and, for organizational purposes, a folder can contain other folders, or subfolders. For 
example, you might organize your electronic files in the Documents folder on your hard 
disk. This folder could contain other folders, each named to indicate its contents. One 
might be “Computer Class” and could contain all the files you have created (or will 
create) for this course.
Categories
While there are hundreds of different operating systems, there are only three basic 
categories: embedded, stand-alone, and network.
 • Embedded operating systems, also known as real-time operating systems and 
RTOS, are entirely stored within (i.e., embedded in) a device. They control smart­
watches, smartphones, video game systems, and thousands of other small elec­
tronic devices. Typically designed for a specific application, embedded operating 
systems are essential in the evolution of IoT where many everyday devices are 
able to communicate with one another as discussed in Chapter 1. For example, 
Watch OS was developed by Apple exclusively for the Apple Watch and Pebble 
OS was developed by Pebble Technology specifically for the Pebble Smartwatch. 
(See Figure 4-3.)
 • Stand-alone operating systems, also called desktop operating systems, control 
a single desktop or laptop computer. (See Figure 4-4.) These operating systems 
are located on the computer’s hard disk. Often desktop computers and laptops 
are part of a network. In these cases, the desktop operating system works with 
the network to share and coordinate resources.
 • Network operating systems (NOS) are used to control 
and coordinate computers that are networked or 
linked together. Many networks are small and con­
nect only a limited number of personal computers. 
Other networks, like those at colleges and universi­
ties, are very large and complex. These networks may 
include other smaller networks and typically connect a 
variety of different types of computers.
		
  Network operating systems are typically located 
on one of the connected computers’ hard disks. 
Called the network server, this computer coor­
dinates all communication between the other 
computers. Popular network operating systems 
include 
Linux, Windows Server, and UNIX.
The operating system is often referred to as 
the software environment or ­software ­platform. Almost all application programs 
are designed to run with a specific platform. For example, Apple’s iMovie software 
is designed to run with the Mac OS environment. Many applications, however, have

chapter 4
Mobile Operating Systems
Mobile operating systems, also known as mobile OS, are a type of 
embedded operating system. Just like other computer systems, mobile 
computers including smartphones, tablets, and wearable computers 
require an operating system. These mobile operating systems are less 
complicated and more specialized for wireless communication.
While there are numerous mobile operating systems, some of the 
best known are Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.
 • Android was introduced in 2007. It was originally developed by 
Android Inc. and later purchased by Google. Android is widely used 
in many of today’s smartphones.
 • iOS, formerly known as iPhone OS, was originally developed in 
2007 by Apple. It is based on Mac OS and is used as the platform for 
Apple’s iPad and iPhone. (See Figure 4-5.)
 • Windows Phone 8 was introduced in 2012 by Microsoft to support a 
variety of mobile devices, including smartphones. In 2015 Microsoft 
introduced a new mobile operating system, sometimes referred to 
as Windows 10 Mobile as a replacement for Windows Phone. It has 
the ability to run many powerful programs designed for desktop and 
laptop computers.

Desktop Operating Systems
Every personal computer has an operating system controlling its operations. The most 
widely used desktop operating systems are Windows, Mac OS, UNIX, and Linux.
Windows
Microsoft’s Windows is the most widely used personal computer operating system. 
Because its market share is so large, more application programs have been developed 
to run under Windows than any other operating system. Windows comes in a variety 
of different versions and is designed to run with a variety of different microprocessors.
The two recent versions are Windows 8 and Windows 10.
 • Windows 8 was released in 2012 and was created to better integrate Microsoft’s 
desktop operating systems with its mobile operating systems. (See Figure 4-6.) It 
­provided support for gestures, cloud integration, and apps. Windows 8 also intro­
duced a new interface. This interface is very similar to the interface for Microsoft’s 
mobile operating system, Windows Phone, and is a dramatic shift from the traditional 
Windows interface. Windows 8 offers a start screen consisting of tiles. Each tile 
displays active content linked to an application. A desktop similar to the traditional 
­Windows desktop can be accessed various ways. Windows RT is a version of 
Windows 8 designed to run with tablets using a particular microprocessor from ARM.
 • Windows 10 was announced in 2015. (See Figure 4-7.) It merges Windows’ desk­
top and mobile operating systems. Unlike previous Windows versions, Windows 
10 runs on all Windows devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. 
This unification has brought several mobile OS innovations to the desktop OS, 
including Cortana, a digital assistant that can accept commands through text or 
speech, and Windows apps, such as Office, that can run on desktops, tablets, and 
smartphones. Other innovations include improved gaming with the Xbox gaming 
environment, a new web browser, and support for Microsoft HoloLens, an aug­
mented reality tool.
Mac OS
Apple has been the leader in the development of powerful and easy-to-use personal 
computer operating systems since its introduction of the Macintosh personal com­
puter in 1984. Designed to run only with Apple computers, Mac OS is not as widely 
used as the Windows operating system. As a result, fewer application programs have 
been written for it. However, with dramatically increasing sales of Apple computers, 
the use of Mac OS has been rapidly increasing and is widely recognized as one of the 
most innovative operating systems.

privacy
What information would you lose 
if a thief stole your computer 
or smartphone? If you use 
your computer or to shop on 
the Internet, check your bank 
balance, or read e-mail, then the 
thief would have access to your 
credit cards, bank accounts, 
and personal correspondence. 
The operating system on your 
computer or phone can be set 
up to require a password or 
secret code whenever the OS 
starts up. This could prevent 
a lost or stolen device from 
providing access to your private 
information.

96	
chapter 4
Mac OS X is the most widely used Mac desktop operating system. Its two most 
recent versions are
 • OS X Mavericks,  which was announced in 2013 and introduced several improve­
ments, including better power management for longer laptop battery life, 
enhanced workflow options for multiple monitor setups, and better integration 
with cloud computing.
 • OS X Yosemite, which was released in 2014. (See Figure 4-8.) It provided a new 
user interface similar to the iOS interface. Other innovations include greater use 
of Apple’s cloud storage service, iCloud, and greater compatibility with Apple 
mobile devices. This compatibility includes the ability to send and receive text 
messages and phone calls from Apple’s desktop computers and the ability to start 
e-mails and spreadsheets on one device and finish them on another.
UNIX and Linux
The UNIX operating system was originally designed in the late 1960s to run on mini­
computers in network environments. Over the years, UNIX has evolved with numer­
ous different versions. Now, it is widely used by servers on the web, mainframe 
computers, and very powerful personal computers. There are a large number of differ­
ent versions of UNIX.
Linux is an operating system that extended one of the UNIX versions. It was origi­
nally developed by a graduate student at the University of Helsinki, Linus Torvalds, in 
1991. He allowed free distribution of the operating system code and encouraged oth­
ers to modify and further develop the code. Programs released in this way are called 
open source. Linux is a popular and powerful alternative to the Windows operating 
system. (See Figure 4-9.) Linux has been the basis of several other operating systems. 
For example, Google’s Chrome OS is based on Linux.
Chrome OS integrates with web servers to run applications and to perform other 
traditional operating system functions. This capability has made Chrome OS a popular 
choice for inexpensive notebook computers that use cloud computing and cloud stor­
age to do things that would normally require much more expensive hardware. One 
limitation of these computers is that their efficiency is dependent upon the speed of 
their Internet connection.
Virtualization
As we have discussed, application programs are designed to run with particular oper­
ating systems. What if you wanted to run two or more applications each requiring a 
different operating system? One solution would be to install each of the operating 
Figure 4-8  Mac OS X Yosemite

systems on a different computer. There is, 
however, a way in which a single physical 
computer can support multiple operating 
systems that operate independently. This 
approach is called virtualization.
When a single physical computer runs a 
special program known as virtualization soft­
ware, it operates as though it were two or more 
separate and independent computers, known 
as virtual machines. Each virtual machine 
appears to the user as a separate independent 
computer with its own operating system. The 
operating system of the physical machine 
is known as the host operating system. The 
operating system for each virtual machine is 
known as the guest operating ­system. Users 
can readily switch between virtual computers 
and programs running on them. There are 
several programs that create and run virtual machines. One such program, Parallels, 
allows a user on a Mac to run Windows programs in OS X. (See Figure 4-10.)
Utilities
Ideally, personal computers would continuously run without problems. However, that 
simply is not the case. All kinds of things can happen—internal hard disks can crash, 
computers can freeze up, operations can slow down, and so on. These events can 
make computing very frustrating. That’s where utilities come in. Utilities are special­
ized programs designed to make computing easier. There are hundreds of different 
utility programs. The most essential are
 • Troubleshooting or diagnostic programs that recognize and correct problems, ide­
ally before they become serious. To learn more about using a troubleshooting pro­
gram, see Making IT Work for You: Mac OS X Activity Monitor on pages 98–99.
 • Antivirus programs that guard your computer system against viruses or other 
damaging programs that can invade your computer system. Popular antivirus pro­
grams include Norton AntiVirus and Webroot SecureAnywhere AntiVirus.
 • Backup programs that make copies of files to be used in case the originals are lost 
or damaged. Windows 10 comes with a free backup program, the File History tool, 
and Mac OS X has a backup feature named Time Machine.
 • File compression programs that reduce the size of files so they require less storage 
space and can be sent more efficiently over the Internet. Most operating systems 
handle unzipping files automatically when you open a .zip file.
Most operating systems provide some utility programs. Even more powerful utility 
programs can be purchased separately or in utility suites.

MAC OS X ACTIVITY MONITOR
Have you ever been working with a program when it simply stopped working and would not respond to you? 
Does your computer seem to be getting slower and slower? OS X Activity Monitor, which gives you a live 
view of every program that is currently in RAM, is designed to help with these and many other operational 
problems.
Starting Activity Monitor  You can open Activity Monitor from anywhere by following these steps:
	1	 •	  Press and momentarily hold the command key (⌘) + space bar.
 	2	 •	 Type Activity Monitor and press return.
As you can see, the Activity Monitor window provides a list of active programs; more information can be seen about an 
active program by clicking on the active program in the list and then clicking on the information button (the button with a low­
ercase “i” in a circle in the upper right of the window). This will open with more information about the process, including the 
CPU and Memory resources it uses. Click the red x button in the upper right to close this window.
Closing an Application  Use Activity Monitor 
when a program you are using becomes stuck 
and stops responding.
	1	 •	 In the menu bar, click view → 
Windowed Processes. The Activity 
Monitor should show only the 
programs open on the desktop.
	2	 •	 In the Activity Monitor window, find 
the program that is stuck. Next to 
the program name there should 
read, “(not responding)” in red.
	3	 •	 Select the program and press 
the button in the upper left of the 
window with a gray octagon with a 
white “x” in it. This will force the 
process to quit.
The program that was not responding has been closed, and you can now continue using OS X normally.
Viewing Processes  This is the most powerful area of Activity Monitor. Here you will see a list of every process that is cur­
rently residing in your computer’s RAM.
Making IT work for you

99
 	1	 •	 In the menu bar, click view → All 
Processes. The Activity Monitor 
should show all processes 
currently running on your 
computer.
	2	 •	 In the Activity Monitor window, 
click the button labeled Memory. 
All the processes will be sorted 
from highest (occupying the most 
RAM) to the lowest.
	3	 •	 Click the CPU button. This will 
show any process that the CPU is 
currently working on.
It is normal for the numbers to fluctuate, 
especially those for the CPU.
Ending a Process  Some problematic processes could be spyware, while others represent background services you don’t 
need. Other processes are crucial for your system and should never be ended. Warning: Before ending a process, you must truly 
understand the risks (or benefits) of doing so. Using a search engine, type the name of the process, and the result will list several 
websites that explain what it does. If you want to end a process:
	1	 •	 In the Activity Monitor window, click the Process Name heading (to avoid the fluctuating positions of 
each process).
	2	 •	 Click the process you want to end.
 	3	 •	 Select the program and press the button in the upper left of the window with a gray octagon with a white 
“x” in it. This will force the process to quit.
The particular program file will be removed from the list and from your computer’s memory. Keep in mind that if this pro­
gram is configured to load automatically, you will see it again when you restart your computer.
Monitoring CPU History  If you are wondering what you may be doing that is taxing your computer, monitoring your CPU 
history can give you an idea. The Activity Monitor can open a small window where you 
can see the CPU load on your computer.
	1	 •	 In the menu bar, click Window then select CPU Usage. A small window 
will open showing the load on each core in your CPU as a bar chart.
 	2	 •	 Keeping the CPU window visible, perform an action on your computer to 
see it impact the CPU load. For example, open a web page or a document.
 	3	 •	 When you are done viewing the CPU Usage, close the window.

Windows Utilities
The Windows operating systems are accom­
panied by several utility programs, includ­
ing File History, Disk Cleanup, and Disk 
Defragmenter.
File History is a utility program included 
with Windows 10 that makes a copy of all 
files that are in the libraries, contacts, and 
favorites and on the desktop. It helps pro­
tect you from the effects of a disk failure. 
For example, you can select File History 
from the Windows 10 System and Security 
window to create a backup for your hard 
disk as shown in Figure 4-11.
	1	 •	 Click the Windows icon in the lower left of 
the screen, type “control panel,” and select 
Control Panel.
	 	 •	 In the Control Panel window, select 
Systems and Security and click on 
File History.
	 	 •	 Choose the destination for the backup.
	 	 •	 Click the Turn on button.
Have you ever experienced problems after installing a new 
program or changing system settings? If so, the System Restore 
utility can help by reversing the changes and bringing your 
computer to a previous point in time. For Windows 10:
		
Go to the Windows 10 start screen and then type “recovery” in the search box.
		
Click on Open System Restore from the Advanced recovery tools list.
		
Follow the prompts, and choose a restore point.
		
Click the Finish button to start the process.

When you surf the web, a variety of programs and files 
are saved on your hard disk. Many of these and other files 
are not essential. Disk Cleanup is a troubleshooting utility 
that identifies and eliminates nonessential files. This frees 
up valuable disk space and improves system performance.
For example, by opening Disk Cleanup from the Win­
dows 10 search results, you can eliminate unneeded files 
on your hard disk as shown in Figure 4-12.
	1	 • Click the Windows icon in the lower left of the 
screen, type “disk cleanup,” and select Disk 
Cleanup.
	 	 •	 Review the files suggested for cleanup, and 
then click OK.
	 	 •	 Confirm that you want to permanently delete 
these files by clicking Delete Files.
	2	 •	 The utility cleans the selected files.
Figure 4-12  Disk Cleanup utility

102	 chapter 4
As we will discuss in detail in Chapter 7, files are stored and 
organized on a disk according to tracks and sectors. A track 
is a concentric ring. Each track is divided into wedge-shaped 
sections called sectors. (See Figure 4-13.) The operating sys­
tem tries to save a file on a single track across contiguous sec­
tors. Often, however, this is not possible, and the file has to 
be broken up, or fragmented, into small parts that are stored 
wherever space is available. Whenever a file is retrieved, it 
is reconstructed from the fragments. After a period of time, 
a hard disk becomes highly fragmented, slowing operations.
Optimize Drives is a utility program that locates and 
eliminates unnecessary fragments and rearranges files and 
unused disk space to optimize operations. For example, 
by selecting Optimize Drives from the Windows 10 search 
results, you can defrag your hard disk as shown in Figure 4-14.
	1	 •	 Click the Windows icon in the lower right of the screen, type 
“Defragment”.
	 	 •	 From the search results, select Defragment and optimize your drives.
	2	 •	 In the Optimize Drives window, in 
the section labeled Status, select 
the drive you would like to defrag.
	 	 •	 Click the Optimize button to defrag 
the highlighted drive.
	 	 •	 When defragmentation is complete 
for the selected drive, view the 
report or close the window.

Utility Suites
Like application software suites, utility suites combine several programs into one 
package. Buying the package is less expensive than buying the programs separately. 
Some of the best-known utility suites are BitDefender, Kaspersky, and Norton. 
(See Figure 4-15.) These suites provide a variety of utilities. Some programs improve 
hard disk efficiency, while other programs will protect your system from dangerous 
computer viruses. You can “catch” a computer virus many ways, including by opening 
attachments to e-mail messages and downloading software from the Internet. (We will 
discuss computer viruses in detail in Chapter 9.)

ethics
Everyone should worry about 
getting a computer virus that 
will corrupt or destroy files. 
Some suggest that software 
developers may be taking 
advantage of this fear by 
sending out misleading or fake 
virus alerts. One reported scam 
encourages users to download 
a free virus detection program. 
This free download begins 
by actually installing a virus 
onto the user’s computer. It 
then performs a bogus scan, 
locating the virus and then 
offering to remove the virus 
for a fee. Obviously, this is 
unethical, not to mention illegal. 
How can you and legitimate 
antivirus manufacturers protect 
themselves against viruses and 
unethical software developers?

Careers in IT
Computer support specialists provide technical support to customers 
and other users. They also may be called technical support specialists or 
help-desk technicians. Computer support specialists manage the every­
day technical problems faced by computer users. They resolve common 
networking problems and may use troubleshooting programs to diag­
nose problems. Most computer support specialists are hired to work 
within a company and provide technical support for other employees 
and divisions. However, it is increasingly common for companies to 
provide technical support as an outsourced service.
Employers generally look for individuals with either an advanced 
associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree to fill computer support spe­
cialist positions. Degrees in computer science or information systems 
may be preferred. However, because demand for qualified applicants is 
so high, those with practical experience and certification from a train­
ing program increasingly fill these positions. Employers seek individu­
als with customer service experience who demonstrate good analytical, 
communication, and people skills.
Computer support specialists can expect to earn an annual salary of 
$29,000 to $40,000. Opportunities for advancement are very good and 
may involve design and implementation of new systems.
Now that you know about system software, I’d 
like to tell you about my career as a computer 
support specialist.

invisible. It believes autonomic computing has the potential 
to revolutionize the way businesses run.
Autonomic computing is a system that allows machines 
to run with little human intervention. Such computers would 
not have self-awareness but would be self-correcting. Auto­
nomic processes in machines are modeled after autonomic 
processes in the human body. For example, you are not con­
sciously breathing. Instead, your body monitors and main­
tains your respiration without your input. Scientists hope 
autonomic computing will behave 
in a similar manner and maintain 
systems without intervention.
Autonomic machines would be 
able to identify security flaws and 
repair them. They would be able 
to sense slow computer opera­
tions and take corrective action. 
They would be able to detect new 
equipment, format it, and test it. 
Computer usage will become less 
complex so that you can focus on 
getting work done instead of wor­
rying about the machine’s opera­
tion. These goals are impressive, 
and the autonomic computer is still 
in development.
It is important to note that auto­
nomic computing is not artificial 
intelligence because autonomic 
machines do not have human 
cognitive abilities or intelligence. 
Instead, these machines have knowledge of their own sys­
tems and the capability to learn from experience to correct 
errors.
Given the potential for a self-maintaining server, the pos­
sibility of a similar system designed for a personal computer 
seems less like a dream and more like a reality. What do you 
think? Will personal computers ever care for themselves? 
Do you think it is possible to have a computer managing its 
own security? Will hackers find a way to outsmart these 
“intelligent” systems?
Self-Healing Computers Could Mean an End to 
Computer Crashes and Performance Problems
Wouldn’t it be nice if computers could fix themselves? What 
if your computer could continually fine-tune its operations 
to maintain peak performance? Computers often perform 
performance improvements on a regular schedule, such 
as disk defragmentation. More recently, improvements in 
virus protection and eradication can identify and remove 
viruses before they impact per­
formance. In the future, comput­
ers may not only fix software 
issues, but actually identify hard­
ware problems and route func­
tions around broken hardware. 
For many people, this sounds too 
good to be true. Maintenance 
and troubleshooting tasks like 
these can be time-consuming and 
frustrating. Technology has been 
making better self-fixing comput­
ers, and will continue to evolve 
to improve our lives as we look to 
the future.
Now imagine you run a busi­
ness, and unless these tasks are 
performed, you will lose time and 
money. It is not a pleasant day­
dream, and it quickly becomes 
a nightmare without properly 
trained systems administrators 
to keep servers running smoothly. Yet many experts predict 
that supercomputers and business systems are not far from 
becoming too complex for humans to manage and secure. 
Recent news from IBM makes the dream of a self-repairing, 
self-updating, and self-protecting server seem closer.
IBM has announced plans to concentrate research 
efforts on developing just such a server. The project, called 
the Autonomic Computing Initiative (ACI), hopes to free busi­
nesses from time-consuming computer maintenance. IBM 
hopes the new system will be self-regulating and virtually 
A LOOK TO THE FUTURE

OPERATING SYSTEMS
SYSTEM SOFTWARE
System Software
VISUAL SUMMARY
System software works with end users, application pro­
grams, and computer hardware to handle many details 
relating to computer operations.
Not a single program but a collection or system of 
programs, these programs handle hundreds of technical 
details with little or no user intervention.
Four kinds of systems programs are operating systems, 
utilities, device drivers, and language translators.
 • Operating systems coordinate resources, provide an 
interface between users and the computer, and run 
programs.
 • Utilities perform specific tasks related to managing 
computer resources.
 • Device drivers allow particular input or output devices 
to communicate with the rest of the computer system.
 • Language translators convert programming instruc­
tions written by programmers into a language that 
computers can understand and process.
Operating systems (software environments, software 
platforms) handle technical details.
Functions
Functions include managing resources, providing a user 
interface (most operating systems use a graphical user 
interface, or GUI), and running applications. Multitask­
ing allows switching between different applications stored 
in memory; current programs run in foreground; other 
programs run in background.
Features
Booting starts (cold) or restarts (warm) a computer sys­
tem. The desktop provides access to computer resources. 
Common features include icons, pointers, windows, 
menus, tabs, dialog boxes, Help, and gesture control. 
Data and programs are stored in a system of files and 
folders.
Categories
Three categories of operating systems are
 • Embedded—also known as real-time operating systems 
(RTOS); used with handheld computers; operating sys­
tem stored within device.
 • Stand-alone (desktop)—controls a single computer; 
located on the hard disk.
 • Network (NOS)—controls and coordinates networked 
computers; located on the network server.
Operating systems are often called software environ­
ments or software platforms.

MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEMS
DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEMS
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the functionality of system software, including 
operating systems and utility programs.
Mobile operating systems (mobile OS) are embedded in 
every smartphone and tablet. These systems are less com­
plicated and more specialized for wireless communication 
than desktop operating systems.
Some of the best known are Android, iOS (iPhone OS), 
and Windows Phone.
 • Android was originally developed by Android Inc. 
and later purchased by Google. It is a widely used 
mobile OS.
 • iOS (iPhone OS) was developed by Apple to support 
iPhone and iPad.
 • Windows Phone 8 was introduced in 2012 by Micro­
soft to support a variety of mobile devices, including 
smartphones. Windows 10 Mobile was introduced in 
2015 to replace Windows 8. It can run many powerful 
programs designed for laptop and desktop computers.
Not all mobile applications will run on all smartphones. 
That is because an app is designed to run on a particular 
software platform or operating system. Before download­
ing an app, be sure that it is designed to run with the 
mobile operating system on your mobile device.
Windows
Windows is designed to run with many different micro­
processors. The two recent versions are Windows 8 and 
Windows 10. Windows 10 was introduced in 2015. It 
merged Windows’ desktop and mobile operating systems. 
Innovations include Cortana (accepts commands through 
text or speech), support for Windows apps on desktops 
and mobile devices, improved gaming with the Xbox gam­
ing environment, a new web browser, and support for 
Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality tool.
Mac OS
Mac OS, an innovative, powerful, easy-to-use operat­
ing system, runs on Macintosh computers. The two most 
recent versions are Mavericks and Yosemite. Yosemite 
was released in 2014. It provided a new user interface 
similar to the iOS interface. Innovations include greater 
use of Apple’s cloud storage service (iCloud) and greater 
compatibility with Apple mobile devices. Compatibility 
includes the ability to send/receive text/phone messages 
from Apple’s desktop computers and the ability to start 
e-mails/spreadsheets on one device and finish on another.

DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEMS
UTILITIES
UNIX and Linux
UNIX was originally designed to run on minicomputers 
in network environments. Now, it is widely used by serv­
ers on the web, mainframe computers, and very powerful 
personal computers. There are many different versions of 
UNIX. One version, Linux, a popular and powerful alter­
native to the Windows operating system, is open source 
software. Google’s Chrome OS is based on Linux. It inte­
grates with web servers to run applications and to perform 
other traditional operating system functions. Chrome OS 
is a popular choice for inexpensive notebook computers 
using cloud computing and cloud storage. One limitation 
of these computers is that their efficiency is dependent 
upon the speed of their Internet connection.
Virtualization
Virtualization allows a single physical computer to sup­
port multiple operating systems. Using a special program 
(virtualization software) allows the single physical com­
puter to operate as two or more separate and independent 
computers known as virtual machines. Host operating 
systems run on the physical machine. Guest operating 
systems operate on virtual machines. Parallels creates and 
runs virtual machines on Apple’s Mac OS X.
Utilities make computing easier. The most essential are 
troubleshooting (diagnostic), antivirus, backup, and file 
compression.
Windows Utilities
Windows operating systems are accompanied by several 
utility programs, including File History, Disk Cleanup, 
and Optimize Drives (eliminates unnecessary fragments; 
tracks are concentric rings; sectors are wedge-shaped).
Utility Suites
Utility suites combine several programs into one package. 
Computer viruses are dangerous programs.
CAREERS in IT
Computer support specialists provide technical support to 
customers and other users. Degrees in computer science or 
information systems are preferred plus good analytical and 
communication skills. Salary range is $29,000 to $40,000.

prepared for this ever-changing digital world, including:
• Types of personal computers—learn the strengths and 
weaknesses of desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, 
and wearable computers.
• Computer components—understand the impact micropro­
cessors and memory have on the power of a computer.
• Peripherals and upgrades—expand your computer’s abili­
ties and speed.

chapter 5
System Unit
The system unit, also known as the system chassis, is a container that houses most of 
the electronic components that make up a computer system.
At one time all system units were in a separate case. Advances in the miniaturiza­
tion of electronic components, however, have led to smaller and smaller computers 
with system units that share containers with other parts of the computer system.
As we have previously discussed, a personal computer is the most widely used type 
of computer. It is the most affordable and designed to be operated directly by an end 
user. The five most common types are desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphones, and wear­
able computers. Each has a unique type of system unit.
Desktops
This is the most powerful type of personal computer. Most desktops have their sys­
tem unit in a separate case. This case contains the system’s electronic components 
and selected secondary storage devices. Input and output devices, such as a mouse, 
keyboard, and monitor, are located outside the system unit. This type of system unit 
is designed to be placed either horizontally or vertically. Desktop system units that are 
placed vertically are sometimes referred to as a tower unit or tower computer. (See 
Figure 5-1.)
Some desktop computers, like Apple’s iMac, have their monitor and system unit 
housed together in the same case. These computers are known as an all-in-one. (See 
Figure 5-2.)
Laptops
Although typically not as powerful as desktops, laptops are portable and much 
smaller. Their system units are housed with selected secondary storage devices and 
input devices (keyboard and pointing device). Located outside the system unit, the 
monitor is attached by hinges.
Introduction
Why are some computers more powerful than others? The answer lies in 
three words: speed, capacity, and flexibility. After reading this chapter, you 
will be able to judge how fast, powerful, and versatile a particular personal 
computer is. As you might expect, this knowledge is valuable if you are 
planning to buy a new personal computer system or to upgrade an exist­
ing system. (The Computer Buyer’s Guide at the end of this book provides 
additional information.) This knowledge will help you evaluate whether or 
not an existing system is powerful enough for today’s new and exciting 
applications.
Sometime you may get the chance to watch when a technician opens 
up a personal computer. You will see that it is basically a collection of 
electronic circuitry. While there is no need to understand how all these 
components work, it is important to understand the principles. Armed with 
this knowledge, you will be able to confidently make sound purchasing and 
upgrading decisions.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the 
functionality of the basic components in the system unit, including the sys­
tem board, microprocessor, memory, expansion slots and cards, bus lines, 
ports, cables, and power supply units.
Hi, I’m Liz, and I’m a computer technician. I’d 
like to talk with you about the different types 
of system units for personal computers. I’d 
also like to talk about various electronic com­
ponents that make your computer work.

Labor costs are much less in 
China than in the United States. 
As a result, many computers 
and peripherals sold last year 
were manufactured there. 
While this has resulted in 
the loss of jobs elsewhere, 
it has also improved the 
standard of living for millions 
of Chinese. Unfortunately, 
working conditions in Chinese 
factories have been widely 
reported to be well below 
acceptable standards. Do 
you think consumers have an 
ethical responsibility regarding 
where and/or how products are 
manufactured?

Figure 5-4  Ultrabook
Figure 5-5  Mini tablet
There are several specialized laptops with features that make them 
unique. Some of them are:
 • Two-in-one laptops, which include a touch screen and the ability to 
fold flat like a tablet computer. These laptops offer the advantages of a 
laptop with the convenience of a tablet. (See Figure 5-3.)
 • Gaming laptops, which include high-end graphics hardware and very 
fast processors. At one time, most gamers preferred desktop computers. 
As laptops have become more powerful, gaming laptops have become 
the favorite primarily due to their portability.
 • Ultrabooks, also known as ultraportables or mini notebooks, which 
are lighter and thinner with longer battery life than most laptops. 
They accomplish these advantages by leaving out components such 
as optical drives and using energy-efficient microprocessors. (See 
Figure 5-4.)
Tablets
Tablets, also known as tablet computers, are the newest and one of the 
most popular types of computer. They are effectively a thin slab that is 
almost all monitor with the system unit located behind the monitor.
Tablets are smaller, lighter, and generally less powerful than laptop com-
puters. Like a laptop, tablets have a flat screen but typically do not have a 
standard keyboard. Instead, most tablets use a virtual keyboard that appears 
on the screen and is touch-sensitive. While tablets are very convenient for 
watching videos or surfing the web, inputting information can be difficult 
using their virtual keyboard. Some ways to overcome this limitation are with:
 • Keyboard attachments. Several manufacturers are offering keyboard options. For 
example, Apple and Logitech offer wireless keyboards for tablets.
 • Digital pens. These devices assist in selecting options and entering handwritten 
notes. For example, both Microsoft and Samsung offer tablets with digital pens.
 • Speech recognition. This advance allows direct verbal communication. For exam-
ple, both Apple and Google feature excellent speech recognition features built into 
iOS and Chrome OS.
Mini tablets are a type of tablet with a smaller screen. While mini tablets operate 
like a traditional tablet, they typically do not have all the functionality of the bigger 
tablets. Their most significant advantage is that they are easier to transport in pockets 
and purses. (See Figure 5-5.)

chapter 5
Smartphones
Smartphones are by far the most popular mobile device. Designed to comfortably fit into 
the palm of one hand, smartphones have become the indispensable handheld computer. 
They greatly extend the capabilities of a cell phone by providing computing power. In 
addition to capturing and sending audio and video, smartphones run apps, connect to 
the Internet, and more. Their system unit is located behind the display screen.
Wearable Computers
Wearable computers, also known as wearable devices, are one of the first evolutionary 
steps to the IoT. These devices contain an embedded computer on a chip that is typi-
cally much smaller and less powerful than a smartphone’s. The most common wear-
able computers are smartwatches and activity trackers. (See Figure 5-6.)
 • Smartwatches like Apple’s Watch. This device acts as a watch, fitness monitor, and 
communication device. For example, the Apple Watch connects to an iPhone to dis-
play e-mails, text messages, and calendar reminders on the user’s wrist.
 • Activity trackers like Fitbit’s Flex. This device monitors daily exercise and sleep 
patterns. It also connects wirelessly to desktops, laptops, and smartphones to 
record and share data.
Components
Personal computers come in a variety of different sizes, shapes, and capabilities. While 
they look different and each has its own unique features, they share surprisingly similar 
components, including system boards, microprocessors, and memory. (See Figure 5-7.)

System Board
The system board is also known as the mainboard or motherboard. The system board 
controls communications for the entire computer system. All devices and components 
connect to the system board, including external devices like keyboards and monitors 
and internal components like hard-disk drives and microprocessors. The system board 
acts as a data path and traffic monitor, allowing the various components to communi­
cate efficiently with one another.
On a desktop computer, the system board is typically located at the bottom of the 
system unit or along one side. It is a large flat circuit board covered with a variety of dif­
ferent electronic components including sockets, slots, and bus lines. (See Figure 5-8.)
 • Sockets provide a connection point for small specialized electronic parts called 
chips. Chips consist of tiny circuit boards etched onto squares of sandlike material 
called silicon. These circuit boards can be smaller than the tip of your finger. (See 
Figure 5-9.) A chip is also called a silicon chip, semiconductor, or integrated circuit. 
Chips typically are mounted onto chip carriers. (See Figure 5-10.) These carriers plug 
either directly into sockets on the system board or onto cards that are then plugged 
into slots on the system board. Sockets are used to connect the system board to a 
variety of different types of chips, including microprocessor and memory chips.
 • Slots provide a connection point for specialized cards or circuit boards. These 
cards provide expansion capability for a computer system. For example, a wireless

 • Connecting lines called bus lines provide pathways that support communication 
among the various electronic components that are either located on the system 
board or attached to the system board.
Generally, the system board found on a desktop is larger than that found on a lap­
top, and much larger than one found on a tablet, smartphone, or wearable computer. 
Although these system boards vary in size, they nevertheless all perform the same 
function of communicating between the components of the personal computer.

Microprocessor
In most personal computer systems, the central processing unit (CPU) or processor 
is contained on a single chip called the microprocessor. The microprocessor is the 
“brains” of the computer system. It has two basic components: the control unit and the 
arithmetic-logic unit.
 • Control unit: The control unit tells the rest of the computer system how to carry 
out a program’s instructions. It directs the movement of electronic signals between 
memory, which temporarily holds data, instructions, and processed information, 
and the arithmetic-logic unit. It also directs these control signals between the CPU 
and input and output devices.
 • Arithmetic-logic unit: The arithmetic-logic unit, usually called the ALU, performs 
two types of operations: arithmetic and logical. Arithmetic operations are the 
fundamental math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Logical operations consist of comparisons such as whether one item is equal to 
(=), less than (<), or greater than (>) the other.

Microprocessor Chips
Chip processing capacities are often expressed in word sizes. A word is the number of 
bits (such as 16, 32, or 64) that can be accessed at one time by the CPU. The more bits 
in a word, the more data a computer can process at one time. Eight bits group together 
to form a byte. A 32-bit-word computer can access 4 bytes at a time. A 64-bit-word 
computer can access 8 bytes at a time. Therefore, the computer designed to process 
64-bit words has greater processing capacity. Other factors affect a computer’s pro­
cessing capability including how fast it can process data and instructions.
The processing speed of a microprocessor is typically represented by its clock speed, 
which is related to the number of times the CPU can fetch and process data or instruc­
tions in a second. Older personal computers typically process data and instructions 
in millionths of a second, or microseconds. Newer personal computers are much 
faster and process data and instructions in billionths of a second, or nanoseconds. 
Supercomputers, by contrast, operate at speeds measured in ­picoseconds—1,000 
times as fast as personal computers. In the near future, we can expect processor 
speeds to be 1,000 times faster than that, operating at speeds measured in femto­
seconds. (See Figure 5-11.) Logically, the higher a microprocessor’s clock speed, 
the faster the microprocessor. However, some processors can handle multiple 
instructions per cycle or tick of the clock; this means that clock speed compari­
sons can only be made between processors that work the same way.
At one time, personal computers were limited by microprocessors that could 
support a single CPU that controlled operations. These computers were limited to pro­
cessing one program at a time. Now, many personal computers have multicore pro­
cessors that can provide two or more separate and independent CPUs. For example, 
a quad-core processor could have one core computing a complex Excel spreadsheet, a 
second core creating a report using Word, a third core locating a record using Access, 
and a fourth core running a multimedia presentation all at the same time. More sig­
nificantly, however, is the potential for personal computers to run very large, complex 
programs that previously required expensive and specialized hardware.
For multicore processors to be used effectively, computers must understand how 
to divide tasks into parts that can be distributed across each core—an operation called 
parallel processing. Operating systems such as Windows 8 and Mac OS X support 
parallel processing. Software developers use this technology for a wide range of appli­
cations from scientific programs to sophisticated computer games.
See Figure 5-12 for a table of popular microprocessors.
Specialty Processors
In addition to microprocessor chips, a variety of more specialized processing chips 
have been developed.
 • Coprocessors are specialty chips designed to improve specific computing operations. 
One of the most widely used is the graphics coprocessor, also called a GPU ­(graphics 
processing unit). These processors are designed to handle a variety of specialized 
tasks such as displaying 3D images and encrypting data. Powerful GPUs are a stan­
dard feature in gaming computers to support fast processing of virtual environments.
 • Many cars have more than 70 separate specialty processors to control nearly every­
thing from fuel efficiency to satellite entertainment and tracking systems.

Memory
Memory is a holding area for data, instructions, and infor­
mation. Like microprocessors, memory is contained on 
chips connected to the system board. There are three well-
known types of memory chips: random-access memory 
(RAM), read-only memory (ROM), and flash memory.
RAM
Random-access memory (RAM) chips hold the program 
(sequence of instructions) and data that the CPU is pres­
ently processing. (See Figure 5-13.) RAM is called tempo­
rary or volatile storage because everything in most types of RAM is lost as soon as the 
computer is turned off. It is also lost if there is a power failure or other disruption of 
the electric current going to the computer. Secondary storage, which we shall describe 
in Chapter 7, does not lose its contents. It is permanent or nonvolatile storage, such 
as the data stored on a hard disk. For this reason, as we mentioned earlier, it is a good 
idea to frequently save your work in progress to a secondary storage device. That is, if 
you are working on a document or a spreadsheet, every few minutes you should save, 
or store, the material.
Cache (pronounced “cash”) memory improves processing by acting as a temporary 
high-speed holding area between the memory and the CPU. The computer detects which 
information in RAM is most frequently used and then copies that information into the 
cache. When needed, the CPU can quickly access the information from the cache.
Having enough RAM is important! For example, to use the standard version of 
Microsoft Office 2016, you need 2 GB, or 2 billion bytes, of RAM. Some applications, 
such as photo editing software, may require even more. Fortunately, additional RAM 
can be added to a computer system by inserting an expansion module called a DIMM 
(dual in-line memory module) into the system board. The capacity or amount of 
RAM is expressed in bytes. There are three commonly used units of measurement to 
describe memory capacity. (See Figure 5-14.)
Even if your computer does not have enough RAM to hold a program, it might be 
able to run the program using virtual memory. Most of today’s operating systems sup­
port virtual memory. With virtual memory, large programs are divided into parts and 
the parts are stored on a secondary device, usually a hard disk. Each part is then read 
into RAM only when needed. In this way, computer systems are able to run very large 
programs.
ROM
Read-only memory (ROM) chips have information stored in them by the manufac­
turer. Unlike RAM chips, ROM chips are not volatile and cannot be changed by the 
user. “Read only” means that the CPU can read, or retrieve, data and programs writ­
ten on the ROM chip. However, the computer cannot write—encode or change—the 
information or instructions in ROM.
Not long ago, ROM chips were typically used to contain almost all the instructions 
for basic computer operations. For example, ROM instructions are needed to start a 
computer, to access memory, and to handle keyboard input. Recently, however, flash 
memory chips have replaced ROM chips for many applications.
Flash Memory
Flash memory offers a combination of the features of RAM and ROM. Like RAM, it 
can be updated to store new information. Like ROM, it does not lose that information 
when power to the computer system is turned off.
Flash memory is used for a wide range of applications. For example, it is used to 
store the start-up instructions for a computer. This information is called the system’s

devices connected to the system unit. If changes are made to the computer system, 
these changes are reflected in flash memory.

Expansion Slots and Cards
As previously mentioned, many personal computers allow users 
to expand their systems by providing expansion slots on the sys­
tem board. Users can insert optional devices known as ­expansion 
cards into these slots. (See Figure 5-16.) Ports on the cards allow 
cables to be connected from the expansion cards to devices 
outside the system unit. (See Figure 5-17.) There are a wide range 
of different types of expansion cards. Some of the most com­
monly used expansion cards are
 • Graphics cards, which provide high-quality 3D graphics and 
animation for games and simulations. While many personal 
computer systems have a GPU connected directly to the system 
board, others connect through a graphics card. This card can 
contain one or more GPU chips and is standard for most gam­
ing computers.
 • Network interface cards (NIC), also known as network adapter cards, which are 
used to connect a computer to a network. (See Figure 5-18.) The network allows con­
nected computers to share data, programs, and hardware. The network adapter card 
typically connects the system unit to a cable that connects to the network.

 • Wireless network cards allow computers to be connected 
without cables. As we will discuss in Chapter 8, wireless 
networks in the home are widely used to share a com­
mon Internet connection. Each device on the network is 
equipped with a wireless network card that communicates 
with the other devices.
To meet the size constraints of laptop computers, tablets, 
and smartphones, fingernail-size expansion cards known as 
SD cards have been developed. These cards plug into expansion 
slots located within many laptops, tablets, and ­smartphones. 
(See Figure 5-19.)

Bus Lines
As mentioned earlier, a bus line—also known simply as a bus—connects the parts of 
the CPU to each other. Buses also link the CPU to various other components 
on the system board. (See Figure 5-20.) A bus is a pathway for bits representing 
data and instructions. The number of bits that can travel simultaneously down 
a bus is known as the bus width.
A bus is similar to a multilane highway that moves bits rather than 
cars from one location to another. The number of traffic lanes determines the 
bus width. A highway (bus line) with more traffic lanes (bus width) can move 
traffic (data and instructions) more efficiently. For example, a 64-bit bus 
can move twice as much information at a time as a 32-bit bus. Why should 
you even care about what a bus line is? Because as microprocessor chips have 
changed, so have bus lines. Bus design or bus architecture is an important 
factor relating to the speed and power for a particular computer. Addition­
ally, many devices, such as expansion cards, will work with only one type 
of bus.
Every computer system has two basic categories of buses. One category, 
called system buses, connects the CPU to memory on the system board. The 
other category, called expansion buses, connects the CPU to other compo­
nents on the system board, including expansion slots.
Expansion Buses
Computer systems typically have a combination of different types of expansion 
buses. The principal types are USB, FireWire, and PCIe.
Figure 5-20  Bus is a pathway

The System Unit	 125
 • Universal serial bus (USB) is widely used today. External USB devices are con­
nected from one to another or to a common point or hub and then onto the USB 
bus. The USB bus then connects to the PCI bus on the system board. The current 
USB standard is USB 3.1.
 • FireWire buses are similar to USB buses but more specialized. They are used pri­
marily to connect audio and video equipment to the system board.
 • PCI Express (PCIe) is widely used in many of today’s most powerful computers. 
Unlike most other buses that share a single bus line or path with several devices, 
the PCIe bus provides a single dedicated path for each connected device.

Ports
A port is a socket for external devices to connect to the system unit. (See Figure 5-21.) 
Some ports connect directly to the system board, while others connect to cards that 
are inserted into slots on the system board. Some ports are standard features of most 
computer systems, and others are more specialized.

Standard Ports
Most desktop and laptop computers come with a standard set of ports for connect­
ing a monitor, keyboard, and other peripheral devices. The most common ports 
follow.
 • Universal serial bus (USB) ports can be used to connect several devices to the 
system unit and are widely used to connect keyboards, mice, printers, storage 
devices, and a variety of specialty devices. One such device, a USB TV tuner card, 
allows users to view and record television programs. To learn how you can use a 
TV tuner card, see Making IT Work for You: TV Tuners on page 127. A single USB 
port can be used to connect many USB devices to the system unit.
 • High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) ports provide high-definition video 
and audio, making it possible to use a computer as a video jukebox or an HD 
video recorder.
 • Thunderbolt ports, first introduced in Apple’s MacBook Pro computer, provide 
high-speed connections. A single port can connect up to seven separate devices 
connected one to another. Thunderbolt ports promise to replace a number of dif­
ferent types of ports including Mini DisplayPorts.
 • Ethernet ports are a high-speed networking port that has become a standard for 
many of today’s computers. Ethernet allows you to connect multiple computers for 
sharing files, or to a DSL or cable modem for high-speed Internet access.
Specialized Ports
In addition to standard ports, there are numerous specialty ports. The most common 
include:
 • External Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (eSATA) ports provide high-
speed connections for external hard-disk drives, optical discs, and other large sec­
ondary storage devices.
 • Musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) ports are a special type of port for 
connecting musical instruments like an electronic keyboard to a sound card. The 
sound card converts the music into a series of digital instructions. These instruc­
tions can be processed immediately to reproduce the music or saved to a file for 
later processing.
 • Mini DisplayPort (MiniDP or mDP) ports are audiovisual ports typically used 
to connect large monitors. These ports are used with many Apple Macintosh 
computers.
 • VGA (Video Graphics Adapter) and DVI (Digital Video Interface) ports provide 
connections to analog and digital monitors, respectively. DVI has become the most 
commonly used standard, but VGA ports are still provided on almost all systems 
for compatibility with older/lower-cost monitors.
 • FireWire ports provide high-speed connections to specialized FireWire devices 
such as camcorders and storage devices.
Cables
Cables are used to connect exterior devices to the system unit via the ports. One end of 
the cable is attached to the device, and the other end has a connector that is attached 
to a matching connector on the port. (See Figure 5-22.)

Making IT work for you
TV TUNERS
Do you already use a DVR (digital video recorder) in order to record your favorite TV shows? Although many 
cable and satellite companies offer this device, did you know that Windows Media Center can perform the 
same function? All you need is a device called a TV tuner that connects your antenna or cable to your com­
puter. Below are the steps to turn your Windows-based computer into a DVR. (Please note that the following 
specifics do not apply to all versions of TV tuners and media players.)
Installing a TV Tuner  A TV tuner is essentially a piece of hardware that allows your computer to process and display a cable 
or TV signal. Although some (usually pricey) PCs may include this technology, it is usually necessary to purchase it separately. 
The easiest ones to install are those that connect externally to a USB port, such as the Hauppauge Hybrid WinTV-HVR.
 	1	 •	 Plug the TV tuner into an available USB port on your computer.
	2	 •	 Connect a coaxial cable directly from your cable outlet or over-the-air 
antenna to the back of the TV tuner. If Windows does not automatically 
install the tuner, consult the user manual for instructions.
	3	 •	 With your TV tuner installed, it will guide you through a setup process, 
including a long scan for all available channels from your cable or 
antenna.
Using a Software Media Center  The utility, Kodi, must be downloaded from the Internet. Although it contains many tools to 
manage your music, photos, and movies, we will focus on its DVR capabilities for TV and cable. (Please note that there are dif­
ferent versions of Kodi and that some of the specifics presented here may not apply to all versions.)
 	1	 •	 Visit http://kodi.tv/download and click the installer for your operating system and download the program.
	2	 •	 Run the installation file and follow the prompts.
	3	 •	 Click on Settings, then Add-ons, then select 
Disabled add-ons, and enable the MythTV 
PVR Client add-on.
	4	 • 	Click the home button located in the lower 
right of the window, then scroll right and click 
on TV, and then select Channels.
	5	 •	 To record a program, locate the program and 
press record.
	6	 •	 To view your recorded TV shows, return to 
the home screen and select the TV sub menu 
recordings. Click on the episode you wish to 
view.
If you have a high-speed wireless network and several PCs in your home, you will have the capability to watch your 
recorded shows via Kodi’s streaming ability.

Power Supply
Computers require direct current (DC) to power their electronic components 
and to represent data and instructions. DC power can be provided indirectly by 
Does your laptop seem to be losing its charge sooner than it used 
to? These batteries do lose power over time; however, you can take 
some steps to slow down the aging process.
		
Balance adapter and battery use. The best practice is to use the laptop on 
battery power for a little while without draining it completely (50 percent 
charge, for example), followed by charging it back to 100 percent. Modern 
batteries should not be drained to 0 percent each day.
		
Calibrate it. Your laptop’s manufacturer will recommend that you calibrate, or 
reset, your battery every few months. Follow its guidelines on the web or in your 
instruction manual, as it will ensure that the battery meter in your operating 
system is accurate and that you are getting the expected charge time.
		
Avoid excessive heat. High temperatures can accelerate the deterioration of 
modern batteries. Therefore, avoid exposure to excessive heat and consider 
purchasing a laptop cooler or fan.
		
Proper storage. If you are not going to use your laptop for a few weeks, most 
manufacturers recommend that you remove the battery.

 • Desktop computers have a power 
supply unit located within the sys-
tem unit. (See Figure 5-23.) This unit 
plugs into a standard wall outlet, 
converts AC to DC, and provides the 
power to drive all of the system unit 
components.
 • Laptops typically use AC adapters

and can recharge the batteries. These 
computers can be operated either using 
an AC adapter plugged into a wall outlet or using bat-
tery power. Their batteries typically provide sufficient 
power for up to eight hours before they need to be 
recharged.
 • Most tablets and mobile devices use internal AC adapt-
ers that use a cable to connect to a standard wall outlet. 
Some smartphones, however, use a wireless charging 
platform eliminating the cable. (See Figure 5-25.) Unlike 
most laptops, most tablets, mobile devices, and wear-
able computers can operate only using battery power. 
Their AC adapters or charging platforms are only used 
to recharge batteries.

Electronic Data and Instructions
Have you ever wondered why it is said that we live in a digital world? It’s because 
computers cannot recognize information the same way you and I can. People fol­
low instructions and process data using letters, numbers, and special characters. For 
example, if we wanted someone to add the numbers 3 and 5 together and record the 
answer, we might say “please add 3 and 5.” The system unit, however, is electronic 
circuitry and cannot directly process such a request.
Our voices create analog, or continuous, signals that vary to represent different 
tones, pitches, and volume. Computers, however, can recognize only digital electronic 
signals. Before any processing can occur within the system unit, a conversion must 
occur from what we understand to what the system unit can electronically process.
Numeric Representation
What is the most fundamental statement you can make about electricity? It is sim­
ply this: It can be either on or off. Indeed, there are many forms of technology that 
can make use of this two-state on/off, yes/no, present/absent arrange­
ment. For instance, a light switch may be on or off, or an electric circuit 
open or closed. A specific location on a tape or disk may have a positive 
charge or a negative charge. This is the reason, then, that a two-state or 
binary system is used to represent data and instructions.
The decimal system that we are all familiar with has 10 digits (0, 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). The binary system, however, consists of only two 
digits—0 and 1. Each 0 or 1 is called a bit—short for binary digit. In the 
system unit, the 1 can be represented by a negative charge and the 0 by 
no electric charge. In order to represent numbers, letters, and special 
characters, bits are combined into groups of eight called bytes. When­
ever you enter a number into a computer system, that number must be 
converted into a binary number before it can be processed.
Any number can be expressed as a binary number. Binary numbers, 
however, are difficult for humans to work with because they require so 
many digits. Instead, binary numbers are often represented in a for­
mat more readable by humans. The hexadecimal system, or hex, uses 
16 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F) to represent binary 
numbers. Each hex digit represents four binary digits, and two hex dig­
its are commonly used together to represent 1 byte (8 binary digits). 
(See Figure 5-26.) You may have already seen hex when selecting a color 
in a website design or drawing application, or when entering the pass­
word for access to a wireless network.
Character Encoding
As we’ve seen, computers must represent all numbers with the binary 
system internally. What about text? How can a computer provide repre­
sentations of the nonnumeric characters we use to communicate, such 
as the sentence you are reading now? The answer is character encoding 
schemes or standards.

Character encoding standards assign a unique sequence of bits to each charac­
ter. Historically, personal computers used the ASCII (American Standard Code for 
Information Interchange) to represent characters, while mainframe computers used 
EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code). These schemes were 
quite effective; however, they are limited. ASCII, for example, only uses 7 bits to repre­
sent each character, which means that only 128 total characters could be represented. 
This was fine for most characters in the English language but was not large enough 
to support other languages such as Chinese and Japanese. These languages have too 
many characters to be represented by the 7-bit ASCII code.
The explosion of the Internet and subsequent globalization of computing have led 
to a new character encoding called Unicode, which uses 16 bits. The Unicode standard 
is the most widely used character encoding standard and is recognized by virtually 
every computer system. The first 128 characters are assigned the same sequence of 
bits as ASCII to maintain compatibility with older ASCII-formatted information. How­
ever, Unicode uses a variable number of bits to represent each character, which allows 
non-English characters and special characters to be represented.

Careers in IT
Computer technicians repair and install computer components and 
systems. They may work on everything from personal computers and 
mainframe servers to printers. Some computer technicians are respon­
sible for setting up and maintaining computer networks. Experienced 
computer technicians may work with computer engineers to diag­
nose problems and run routine maintenance on complex systems. Job 
growth is expected in this field as computer equipment becomes more 
complicated and technology expands.
Employers look for those with certification in computer repair or 
associate’s degrees from professional schools. Computer technicians 
also can expect to continue their education to keep up with technologi­
cal changes. Good communication skills are important in this field.
Computer technicians can expect to earn an annual salary in 
the range of $37,000 to $47,000. Opportunities for advancement typi­
cally come in the form of work on more advanced computer systems.

Have you ever thought it would be possible to be able to com­
municate with a computer . . . by merely thinking? Simple 
computer implants are used on a regular basis to improve 
hearing or reduce the risk of heart attack. More recently, 
implants have been used to regulate drug intake and improve 
prosthetics. In the future you may use various devices (usu­
ally worn on the head) that can use your basic thoughts to 
move objects, such as wheelchairs. However, the future will 
lie in implanted microchips that 
can communicate directly with 
our nerve cells. Although their 
initial purpose will be to treat 
a variety of medical conditions, 
they could eventually (and con­
troversially) be used to improve 
various brain functions of 
otherwise healthy individuals. 
Technology has been making 
better implants, and will con­
tinue to evolve to improve our 
lives as we look to the future.
For over a decade, doctors 
have been able to use deep 
brain stimulation (DBS) to treat 
several disorders such as Par­
kinson’s disease. As success­
ful as it has been for many 
patients, those implants simply 
send preset electrical impulses 
to the brain. They do not involve an active communication 
between nerve cells and machines. Researchers working on 
a chip known as ReNaChip hope to change this by using a 
programmable computer chip that is responsive to what is 
going on in the patient’s brain. This silicon chip can measure 
the brain’s electrical activity and then deliver the appropri­
ate stimulation when and where it is needed.
Another brain implant that is currently being developed 
aims to help the blind regain some sight. A microchip is 
implanted in the brain’s visual cortex, which is responsible for 
processing images. This chip would communicate wirelessly 
with a camera located inside special eyeglasses worn by the 
individual. The images captured by that camera would be 
processed by the chip and then fed directly to the nerves in 
this area of the brain. Getting close to the world of the unbe­
lievable, researchers are improving on the ability of comput­
ers to actually read human thoughts. Currently, one research 
team has been able to use a chip implant and computer to 
read the thoughts of a stroke victim in order to allow her to 
move a robotic hand. Although the success rate is not 100 
percent and the processing is 
limited to basic movements, 
the patient has already been 
able to get the robotic arm to 
hold a cup of coffee by think­
ing about it. This research will 
hopefully lead to improved, 
thought-controlled prosthetic 
devices for ­millions of dis­
abled individuals.
Many ethicists are con­
cerned by the potential use of 
such chips to improve human 
abilities instead of treating 
medical conditions. For exam­
ple, with tiny chips being able 
to store so much, people could 
use brain implants to improve 
their memory. This can lead to 
a variety of scenarios where 
the individual with the implants 
could have an unfair advantage over those who don’t have 
them. However, others disagree, arguing that the integra­
tion of technology and biology is to be expected, and it 
is nothing more than the next step in human evolution. If 
such a technology became widespread and affordable, 
would you opt to receive a chip implant? Would you make a 
distinction between using one for a medical condition and 
simply for improving your mental abilities? Do you think the 
future of humanity lies in the merging of technology with 
human biology?

SYSTEM UNIT
SYSTEM BOARD
VISUAL SUMMARY
The System Unit
System unit (system chassis) contains electronic compo-
nents. The most common personal computers are desktop, 
laptop, tablet, smartphones, and wearable computers.
Desktop
Desktop system units are located in a separate case; tower 
unit (tower computer) has vertical system unit; all-in-one 
computer combines system unit and monitor.
Laptop
Laptop system units contain secondary storage devices 
and input devices. Specialty laptops include two-in-one 
laptops (touch screen and fold flat), gaming laptops (high-
end graphics and fast processors), ultrabooks, also known 
as ultraportables, and mini notebooks (lighter, thinner, 
longer battery life).
Tablet
Tablet system units are located behind the monitor. They 
are smaller, lighter, and generally less powerful than lap-
tops and use a virtual keyboard. Mini tablets are a smaller 
version of a traditional tablet.
Smartphones
Smartphones are the most popular mobile device; extend cell 
phones by providing computing power to capture video, send 
audio and video, run apps, connect to the Internet, and more.
Wearable Computers
Wearable computers (wearable devices) contain an 
embedded computer on a chip. The most common wear-
able computers are smartwatches and activity trackers.
Components
Each type of system unit has the same basic components 
including system board, microprocessor, and memory.
The system board (mainboard or motherboard) controls 
all communication for the computer system. All external 
and internal devices and components connect to it.
 • Sockets provide connection points for chips (silicon 
chips, semiconductors, integrated circuits). Chips are 
mounted on chip carriers.
 • Slots provide connection points for specialized cards 
or circuit boards.
 • Bus lines provide pathways to support 
communication.

EXPANSION SLOTS AND CARDS
MICROPROCESSOR
In most personal computers, the central processing unit 
(CPU) or processor is contained on a single chip called the 
microprocessor. It has two basic components: a control 
unit and ALU.
Microprocessor Chips
A word is the number of bits that can be accessed by the 
microprocessor at one time. Clock speed represents the 
number of times the CPU can fetch and process data or 
instructions in a second.
Multicore processors can provide multiple indepen­
dent CPUs. Parallel processing requires programs that 
allow multiple processors to work together to run large 
complex programs.
Specialty Processors
Specialty processors include graphics coprocessors, also 
known as GPU or graphics processing unit (processes 
graphic images), and processors in automobiles (moni­
tor fuel efficiency, satellite entertainment, and tracking 
systems).
MEMORY
Memory holds data, instructions, and information. There 
are three types of memory chips.
RAM
RAM (random-access memory) chips are called tempo­
rary or volatile storage because their contents are lost if 
power is disrupted.
 • Cache memory is a high-speed holding area for fre­
quently used data and information.
 • DIMM (dual in-line memory module) is used to 
expand memory.
 • Virtual memory divides large programs into parts that 
are read into RAM as needed.
ROM
ROM (read-only memory) chips are nonvolatile storage 
and control essential system operations.
Flash Memory
Flash memory does not lose its contents when power is 
removed.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the functionality of the basic components in the 
system unit: system board, microprocessor, memory, expansion slots and cards, bus lines, ports, and cables. Addition­
ally, you need to understand how data and programs are represented electronically.
Most computers allow users to expand their systems by 
providing expansion slots on their system boards to 
accept expansion cards.
Examples of expansion cards include graphics cards, 
network interface cards (NIC; network adapter cards), 
and wireless network cards.
SD cards are fingernail-size expansion cards used pri­
marily for laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones. 
They connect to expansion slots within these devices.
BUS LINES
Bus lines, also known as buses, provide data pathways 
that connect various system components. Bus width is the 
number of bits that can travel simultaneously.
System buses connect CPU and memory. Expansion 
buses connect CPU and slots.
Expansion Buses
Three principal expansion bus types:
 • USB (universal serial bus) can connect from one USB 
device to another or to a common point (hub) and 
then onto the system board.
 • FireWire bus is similar to USB bus but more 
specialized.
 • PCI Express (PCIe) bus is widely used; provides a 
single dedicated path for each connected device.

chapter 5
PORTS
POWER SUPPLY
Ports are connecting sockets on the outside of the system 
unit.
Standard Ports
Four standard ports are
 • USB (universal serial bus)—widely used to connect 
keyboards, mice, printers, and storage devices; one 
port can connect several devices to system unit.
 • HDMI (high definition multimedia interface)— 
provides high-definition video and audio.
 • Thunderbolt—provides high-speed connections to up 
to seven Thunderbolt devices at once, such as external 
hard drives and monitors.
 • Ethernet—high-speed networking port that has 
become a standard for many of today’s computers.
Specialized Ports
Five specialty ports are eSATA (external serial advanced 
technology attachment) for high-speed connections to 
large secondary storage devices, MIDI for digital music, 
Mini DisplayPort (MiniDP, mDP) for large monitors, 
VGA (Video Graphics Adapter) and DVI (Digital Video 
Interface) for connecting to monitors, and Firewire for 
high-speed connection to devices such as camcorders and 
secondary storage.
Cables
Cables are used to connect external devices to the system 
unit via ports.
Power supply units convert AC to DC and power desk-
tops. AC adapters power laptops and tablets and recharge 
batteries. Some smartphones use wireless charging 
platforms.
ELECTRONIC REPRESENTATION
Human voices create analog (continuous) signals; com-
puters only recognize digital electronic signals.
Numeric Representation
Data and instructions can be represented electronically 
with a two-state or binary system of numbers (0 and 1). 
Each 0 or 1 is called a bit. A byte consists of 8 bits. Hexa-
decimal system (hex) uses 16 digits to represent binary 
numbers.
Character Encoding
Character encoding standards assign unique sequences of 
bits to each character. Three standards are
 • ASCII—American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange. Historically used for personal computers.
 • EBCDIC—Extended Binary Coded Decimal Inter-
change Code. Historically used for mainframe 
computers.
 • Unicode—16-bit code, most widely used standard.
CAREERS IN IT
Computer technicians repair and install computer compo-
nents and systems. Certification in computer repair or an 
associate’s degree from professional schools is required. 
Salary range is $37,000 to $47,000.

Why should I read this chapter?

Introduction
How do you send instructions and information to the CPU? How do you 
get information out? Here we describe one of the most important places 
where computers interface with people. We input text, music, and even 
speech, but we probably never think about the relationship between what 
we enter and what the computer processes. Input devices translate num­
bers, letters, special characters, and gestures that people understand into 
a form that computers can process.
Have you ever wondered how information processed by the system 
unit is converted into a form that you can use? That is the role of output 
devices. While input devices convert what we understand into what the 
system unit can process, output devices convert what the system unit has 
processed into a form that we can understand. Output devices translate 
machine language into letters, numbers, sounds, and images that people 
can understand.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to know about the 
most commonly used input devices, including touch screens, game control­
lers, scanners, digital cameras, voice recognition, and audio-input devices. 
Additionally, you need to know about the most commonly used output 
devices, including monitors, printers, and audio and video output devices. 
You also need to be aware of combination input and output devices such as 
multifunctional devices and telephones.
Hi, I’m Marie, and I’m a technical writer. I’d 
like to talk with you about input and output 
devices . . . all those devices that help us to 
communicate with a computer. I’d also like 
to talk about emerging technologies such as 
virtual reality.

chapter 6
What Is Input?
Input is any data or instructions that are used by a computer. They can come 
directly from you or from other sources. You provide input whenever you use sys­
tem or application programs. For example, when using a word processing pro­
gram, you enter data in the form of numbers and letters and issue commands such 
as to save and to print documents. You also can enter data and issue commands by 
pointing to items or using your voice. Other sources of input include scanned or 
photographed images.
Input devices are hardware used to translate words, numbers, sounds, images, and 
gestures that people understand into a form that the system unit can process. For 
example, when using a word processor, you typically use a keyboard to enter text 
and a mouse to issue commands. In addition to keyboards and mice, there are a wide 
variety of other input devices. These include pointing, scanning, image capturing, and 
audio-input devices.
Keyboard Entry
One of the most common ways to input data is by a keyboard. As mentioned in 
Chapter 5, keyboards convert numbers, letters, and special characters that people 
understand into electrical signals. These signals are sent to, and processed by, the 
system unit. Most keyboards use an arrangement of keys given the name QWERTY. 
This name reflects the keyboard layout by taking the letters of the first six alphabetic 
characters found on the top row of keys displaying letters.

	
Input and Output	 143
Keyboards
There are a wide variety of keyboard designs. They range from the full-sized to minia­
ture and can even be virtual. There are four basic categories of keyboards: traditional, 
laptop, virtual, and thumb.
 • Traditional keyboards—these full-size keyboards are widely used on desktops 
and larger computers. The standard U.S. traditional keyboard has 101 keys. Some 
traditional keyboards include a few additional special keys. For example, the Win­
dows keyboard includes a Windows key to directly access the Start menu. Tradi­
tional keyboards provide function keys, navigation keys, and a numeric keypad. 
Some keys, such as the Caps Lock key, are toggle keys. These keys turn a feature 
on or off. Others, such as the Ctrl key, are combination keys, which perform an 
action when held down in combination with another key. (See Figure 6-1.)
 • Laptop keyboards—these keyboards are smaller than traditional keyboards and are 
widely used on laptop computers. While the precise location and number of keys 
may differ among manufactures, laptop keyboards typically have fewer keys, do 
not include a numeric keypad, and do not have a standard location for the func­
tion and navigation keys. (See Figure 6-2, top.)
 • Virtual keyboards—these keyboards are used primarily with mobile devices and 
tablets. Unlike other keyboards, virtual keyboards do not have a physical key­
board. Rather, the keys are typically displayed on a screen and selected by touch­
ing their image on the screen. (See Figure 6-2, middle.)
 • Thumb keyboards—these keyboards are used on smartphones and other small 
mobile devices. Designed primarily for communicating via texting and connecting 
to the web, these keyboards are very small. (See Figure 6-2, bottom.)
Figure 6-1  Traditional keyboard
Function keys are shortcuts for specific 
tasks; F1, for example, typically displays Help.
Numeric keypad enters numbers and arithmetic 
symbols and controls cursor or insertion point.
Navigation keys control the cursor 
or insertion point on the screen.
Windows key displays 
the Start menu.

Pointing Devices
Pointing is one of the most natural of all human gestures. Pointing devices provide an 
intuitive interface with the system unit by accepting physical movements or gestures 
such as a finger pointing or moving across a screen and converting these movements 
into machine-readable input. There are a wide variety of pointing devices, including 
the mouse, touch screen, game controller, and stylus.
Mouse
A mouse controls a pointer that is displayed on the monitor. The mouse pointer usu­
ally appears in the shape of an arrow. It frequently changes shape, however, depend­
ing on the application. A mouse can have one, two, or more 
buttons, which are used to select command options and to con­
trol the mouse pointer on the monitor. Some mice have a wheel 
button that can be rotated to scroll through information that is 
displayed on the monitor.
Although there are several different designs, the optical mouse 
is the most widely used. (See Figure 6-3.) It emits and senses light 
to detect mouse movement. Traditionally, the detected movements 
are communicated to the system unit through a cord. Alternatively, 
the cordless or wireless mouse uses radio waves or infrared light 
waves to communicate with the system unit. These devices elimi­
nate the mouse cord and free up desk space.
Like a mouse, a touch pad is used to control the mouse pointer 
and to make selections. Unlike a mouse, however, a touch pad 
operates by moving or tapping your finger on the surface of a 
pad. These devices are widely used instead of a mouse with lap­
tops and some types of mobile devices. (See Figure 6-4.)
Touch Screen
A touch screen allows users to select actions or commands by 
touching the screen with a finger or penlike device. Multitouch 
screens can be touched with more than one finger, which allows 
for interactions such as rotating graphical objects on the screen 
with your hand or zooming in and out by pinching and stretch­
ing your fingers. Multitouch screens are commonly used with 
tablets and smartphones, as well as some laptop computers and 
desktop monitors. (See Figure 6-5.)
Game Controllers
Game controllers are devices that provide input to computer 
games. While keyboards and traditional mice can be used as game controllers, the four 
most popular and specialized game controllers are joysticks, gaming mice, gamepads, 
and motion-sensing devices. (See Figure 6-6.)
 • Joysticks control game actions by users varying the pressure, speed, and direction 
of a control stick.
 • Gaming mice are similar to traditional mice with higher precision, faster respon­
siveness, programmable buttons, and better ergonomics.
 • Gamepads are designed to be held by two hands and provide a wide array of 
inputs including motion, turning, stopping, and firing.
 • Motion-sensing devices control games by user movements. For example, Micro­
soft’s Kinect motion-sensing device accepts user movements and spoken com­
mands to control games on the Xbox 360.

Scanning Devices
Scanning devices convert scanned text and images into a form that the system unit 
can process. There are five types of scanning devices: optical scanners, card readers, 
bar code readers, RFID readers, and character and mark recognition devices.
Optical Scanners
An optical scanner, also known simply as a scanner, accepts documents consisting of 
text and/or images and converts them to machine-readable form. These devices do not 
recognize individual letters or images. Rather, they recognize light, dark, and colored 
areas that make up individual letters or images. Typically, scanned documents are 
saved in files that can be further processed, displayed, printed, or stored for later use.
Stylus
A stylus is a penlike device typically used with tablets and 
mobile devices. (See Figure 6-7.) A stylus uses pressure to 
draw images on a screen. Often, a stylus interacts with 
the computer through handwriting recognition software. 
Handwriting recognition software translates handwritten 
notes into a form that the system unit can process.

Figure 6-8  Document scanner
There are four basic types of optical scanners: flatbed, document, portable, and 3D.
 • Flatbed scanner is much like a copy machine. The image to be scanned is placed 
on a glass surface, and the scanner records the image.
 • Document scanner is similar to a flatbed scanner except that it can quickly scan 
multipage documents. It automatically feeds one page of a document at a time 
through a scanning surface. (See Figure 6-8.)
 • Portable scanner is typically a handheld device that slides across the image, 
­making direct contact.
 • 3D scanners use lasers, cameras, or robotic arms to record the shape of an object. 
Like 2D scanners, most 3D scanners cannot recognize light, dark, and colored 
areas. (See Figure 6-9.)
Optical scanners are powerful tools for a wide variety of end users, including graph­
ics and advertising professionals who scan images and combine them with text.
Card Readers
Nearly everyone uses a credit card, debit card, access (parking or building) card, and/or 
some type of identification card. These cards typically have the user’s name, some 
type of identification number, and signature on the card. Additionally, encoded infor­
mation is often stored on the card. Card readers interpret this encoded information.
Although there are several different types, by far the most common is the ­magnetic 
card reader. The encoded information is stored on a thin magnetic strip located on the 
back of the card. When the card is swiped through the magnetic card reader, the infor­
mation is read. Many credit cards, known as smart cards, include additional security 
in the form of a microchip embedded in the credit card. This chip contains encrypted 
data that makes it nearly impossible for criminals to forge a duplicate card. Some chips 
require that you insert the card into a specialized reader, while others only require that 
you hold the card near the reader.
Bar Code Readers
You are probably familiar with bar code readers or scanners from grocery stores. These 
devices are either handheld wand readers or platform scanners. They contain photo­
electric cells that scan or read bar codes, or the vertical zebra-striped marks printed on 
product containers.
There are a variety of different codes including UPC and MaxiCode codes.
 • UPCs (Universal Product Codes) are widely used by retail stores to automate 
the processes to check out customers, to change product prices, and to maintain 
inventory records.
 • MaxiCode is widely used by the United Parcel Service (UPS) and others to auto­
mate the process of routing packages, tracking in-transit packages, and locating 
lost packages.

Smartphones with the appropriate app can also scan codes. (See 
Figure 6-10.) For example, after scanning the bar code from a product 
you are thinking of buying, the app Price Check by Amazon will provide 
in-store and online price comparisons as well as provide other customer 
product reviews.
RFID Readers
RFID (radio-frequency identification) tags are tiny chips that can be 
embedded in most everything. They can be found in consumer prod­
ucts, driver’s licenses, passports, and any number of other items. (See 
Figure 6-11.) These chips contain electronically stored information that 
can be read using an RFID reader located several yards away. They are 
widely used to track and locate lost pets; to monitor production and 
update inventory; and to record prices, product descriptions, and loca­
tions of retail items.
Character and Mark Recognition Devices
Character and mark recognition devices are scanners that are able to 
recognize special characters and marks. They are specialty devices that 
are essential tools for certain applications. Three types are
 • Magnetic-ink character recognition (MICR)—used by banks to auto­
matically read those unusual numbers on the bottom of checks and 
deposit slips. A special-purpose machine known as a reader/sorter 
reads these numbers and provides input that allows banks to effi­
ciently maintain customer account balances.
 • Optical-character recognition (OCR)—uses special preprinted 
characters that can be read by a light source and changed into 
machine-readable code. A common OCR device is the handheld 
wand reader. (See Figure 6-12.) These are used in department 
stores to read retail price tags by reflecting light on the printed 
characters.
 • Optical-mark recognition (OMR)—senses the presence or absence of 
a mark, such as a pencil mark. OMR is often used to score standard­
ized multiple-choice tests.

Image Capturing Devices
Optical scanners, like traditional copy machines, can make a copy 
from an original. For example, an optical scanner can make a digital 
copy of a photograph. Image capturing devices, on the other hand, create 
or capture original images. These devices include digital cameras 
and webcams.

chapter 6
Digital Cameras
Digital cameras capture images digitally and store the images on a memory card or in 
the camera’s memory. Most digital cameras are also able to record video as well. (See 
Figure 6-13.) Almost all tablets and smartphones have built-in digital cameras capable 
of taking images and video. You can take a picture, view it immediately, and even 
place it on your own web page, within minutes.
Webcams
Webcams are specialized digital video cameras that capture images and send them to 
a computer for broadcast over the Internet. Webcams are built into most smartphones 
and tablets. Desktop and laptop webcams are either built in or attached to the com­
puter’s monitor. (See Figure 6-14.)
Audio-Input Devices
Audio-input devices convert sounds into a form that can be processed by the system 
unit. By far the most widely used audio-input device is the microphone. Audio input 
can take many forms, including the human voice and music.
Voice Recognition Systems
Voice recognition systems use a microphone, a sound card, and special software. 
These systems allow users to operate computers and other 
devices as well as to create documents using voice commands. 
As discussed in Chapter 4, most smartphones include a digital 
assistant that uses voice recognition to accept voice commands 
to control operations. Apple phones come with Siri, Windows 
phones come with Cortana, and Google phones come with 
Google Now. These voice recognition systems can perform any 
number of operations including scheduling events on your cal­
endar, composing simple text messages, and looking up facts 
on the web. Specialized portable voice recorders are widely 
used by doctors, lawyers, and others to record dictation. These 
devices are able to record for several hours before connecting 
to a computer running voice recognition software to edit, store, 
and print the dictated information. Some systems are even able 
to translate dictation from one language to another, such as 
from English to Japanese.

ethics
You may have heard of 
instances where webcams were 
used to broadcast the activities 
of individuals who did not know 
they were being recorded. For 
example, in a famous court 
case, a university student was 
prosecuted for using a webcam 
on an open laptop to secretly 
record his roommate’s intimate 
activities. In other situations, 
public webcams have recorded 
embarrassing footage of 
people who were not aware 
of the camera. It has been 
argued that capturing and then 
broadcasting a person’s image 
without his or her knowledge 
and consent is unethical. What 
do you think?

Input and Output	 149
What Is Output?
Output is processed data or information. Output typically takes the form of text, 
graphics, photos, audio, and/or video. For example, when you create a presentation 
using a presentation graphics program, you typically input text and graphics. You also 
could include photographs, voice narration, and even video. The output would be the 
completed presentation.
Output devices are any hardware used to provide or to create output. They trans­
late information that has been processed by the system unit into a form that humans 
can understand. There are a wide range of output devices. The most widely used are 
monitors, printers, and audio-output devices.
Monitors
The most frequently used output device is the monitor. Also known as display 
screens, monitors present visual images of text and graphics. The output is 
often referred to as soft copy. Monitors vary in size, shape, and cost. Almost all, 
however, have some basic distinguishing features.
Features
The most important characteristic of a monitor is its clarity. Clarity refers 
to the quality and sharpness of the displayed images. It is a function of 
several monitor features, including resolution, dot pitch, contrast ratio, 
size, and aspect ratio.
 • Resolution is one of the most important features. Images are formed 
on a monitor by a series of dots or pixels (picture elements). (See 
Figure 6-15.) Resolution is expressed as a matrix of these dots 
or pixels. For example, many monitors today have a resolution 
of 
1,920 pixel columns by 1,080 pixel rows for a total of 2,073,600 pixels. 
The higher a monitor’s resolution (the more pixels), the clearer the image 
produced. See Figure 6-16 for the most common monitor resolutions.
 • Dot (pixel) pitch is the distance between each pixel. Most newer monitors have 
a dot pitch of 0.30 mm (30/100th of a millimeter) or less. The lower the dot pitch 
(the shorter the distance between pixels), the clearer the images produced.
 • Contrast ratios indicate a monitor’s ability to display images. It compares the light 
intensity of the brightest white to the darkest black. The higher the ratio, the better 
the monitor. Good monitors typically have contrast ratios between 500:1 and 2000:1.
 • Size, or active display area, is measured by the diagonal length of a monitor’s view­
ing area. Common sizes are 15, 17, 19, 21, and 24 inches.
 • Aspect ratio indicates the proportional relationship between a display’s width and 
height. Typically, this relationship is expressed by two numbers separated by a 
colon (:). Many older, more square-shaped monitors have a 4:3 aspect ratio. Almost all 
newer monitors have a 16:9 aspect ratio designed to display wide-screen content.

Another important monitor feature is the ability to accept touch or gesture input 
such as finger movements including swiping, sliding, and pinching. While most older 
monitors do not support touch input, it is becoming a standard feature of newer 
monitors.
Flat-Panel Monitors
Flat-panel monitors are the most widely used type of monitor today. Compared to 
other types, they are thinner, are more portable, and require less power to operate. 
(See Figure 6-17.)
Almost all flat-panel displays are backlit, meaning that a common source of light 
is dispersed over all the pixels on the screen. There are three basic types of flat-panel 
monitors: LCD, LED, and OLED.
 • LCD (liquid crystal display) is widely used for older monitors and is typically less 
expensive.
 • LED (light-emitting diode) monitors use similar technology with a more advanced 
backlighting technology. They produce better-quality images, are slimmer, and 
are more environmentally friendly as they require less power and use fewer toxic 
chemicals to manufacture. Most new monitors are LED.
 • OLED (organic light-emitting diode) monitors replace the LED monitor’s back-
lighting technology with a thin layer of organic compound that produces light. By 
eliminating the backlight, OLED monitors can be even thinner with better power 
efficiency and contrast ratios.
Curved Monitors
One of the most recent developments is the curved monitor. It uses similar technol-
ogy as flat-panel monitors except it has a concave screen that provides better viewing 
angles near the edges of the screen. Curved monitors are widely use for high-end 
televisions and for gamers searching for a highly immersive viewing experience. (See 
Figure 6-18.) Curved monitors are just beginning to appear in smartphones and wear-
able computers. For smartphones, curved monitors allow the screen to wrap around 
the edge of the phone for alternative display and button options. For smartwatches, a 
curved screen allows for large displays that contour to the shape of your wrist.
E-book Readers
E-books (electronic books) are traditional printed books in electronic format. These 
books are available from numerous sources including many public and private librar-
ies, bookstore websites, and the cloud. 
E-book readers (e-readers) are dedi-
cated mobile devices for storing and 
displaying e-books and other electronic 
media including electronic newspapers 
and magazines.
E-book readers have displays that 
are typically 6 inches and use a tech-
nology known as e-ink. E-ink pro-
duces images that reflect light like 
ordinary paper, making the display 
easy to read. Two well-known e-book 
readers are Amazon’s Kindle and 
Barnes & Noble’s Nook Simple Touch. 
(See Figure 6-19.)
Tablets can also display e-books. They 
are larger, heavier, and more expensive 
than e-book readers. They are also much 
more flexible, with displaying e-books

being only one of their any number of applications. Unlike dedicated e-book readers, these 
tablets use LCD displays that provide crisp, colorful images; however, they are difficult to 
read in bright light due to their reflective nature. Two well-known traditional tablets are 
Apple’s iPad and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab.
To learn more about e-books, see Making IT Work for You: E-books, on page 152.
Other Monitors
There are several other types of monitors. Some are used for more specialized applica­
tions, such as making presentations and watching television.
 • Digital or interactive whiteboards are specialized devices with a large display con­
nected to a computer or projector. The computer’s desktop is displayed on the dig­
ital whiteboard and controlled using a special pen, a finger, or some other device. 
Digital whiteboards are widely used in classrooms and corporate boardrooms. 
(See Figure 6-20.)
 • Ultra-high-definition television (UHDTV) delivers a much clearer and more 
detailed wide-screen picture than regular HDTV. Because the output is digital, 
users can readily freeze video sequences to create high-quality still images. The 
video and still images can then be edited and stored for later use. This technology 
is very useful to graphic artists, designers, and publishers. One of the most recent 
and dramatic advances is 3D UHDTV. (See Figure 6-21.) Using special viewing 
glasses, 3D UHDTV provides theater-quality three-dimensional viewing.
 • Digital projectors project the images from a traditional monitor onto a screen or 
wall. This is ideal for presentations or meetings when several people need to see 
the screen at the same time. Further, projectors tend to be more portable and less 
expensive than a similarly sized monitor. Unfortunately, projected images can be 
difficult to see in bright rooms, so they are best used in dark rooms with curtains 
or no windows. (See Figure 6-22.)

Making IT work for you
E-BOOKS
Are you tired of carrying a book bag filled with textbooks? Have you ever wished you could have a reference 
book or text at your fingertips, instead of at home on a bookshelf? E-books are the solutions to these prob-
lems, and this guide will discuss their benefits, as well as various options on how to access and read them.
Benefits of E-books  Because e-books are digital, they offer a wide range of benefits:
	 1	 •	 Transporting. Books can take up a large volume of space in any 
home (or your school bag). With e-books, you can store over a 
thousand books in one small device!
	2	 •	 Searching. Type any keyword, and you will be taken to the 
page(s) where that word appears. This is much faster than 
using an index.
	3	 •	 Bookmarking. Mark any number of pages as important. This is 
an improvement over having countless physical bookmarks or 
folded pages.
	4	 •	 Adding highlights and notes. All marks on an e-book are digital. They can be added and removed easily. The 
same could not be said for physical textbooks.
	5	 •	 Purchasing. Buying an e-book can take less than a minute, as it is downloaded instantly to your device. 
Prices also tend to be lower than those for physical books.
Reading E-books  Once you decide to purchase an e-book, you may be surprised by the number of devices you can use to read it.
	 1	 •	 E-book reader. Dedicated e-book readers, such as 
the Amazon Kindle and the Barnes & Noble 
Nook, can be purchased for less than 
$100. If it is important for you to read 
in direct sunlight or areas with heavy 
lighting, the e-ink used by these devices 
will be desirable.
	2	 •	 Smartphones and tablets. Do you already 
own a smartphone or tablet that you take everywhere?  
If so, you may want to download the free apps from e-book 
sellers to avoid the cost of a separate e-book reader.  
The reading experience on these apps is excellent with the touch-screen interface present in these 
devices.
	3	 •	 Laptop and desktop computers. Although many e-book retailers make apps for your computer, sellers such as 
Google allow you to read books purchased from its Google Play store with nothing more than a web browser.
Most e-book sellers offer the synchronization of your e-books and notes with their cloud services. This allows you to start 
reading a book using your tablet, for example, and pick up where you left off with your smartphone.

	
Input and Output	 153
Printers
Even as many individuals, schools, and businesses are trying to go paperless, printers 
remain one of the most used output devices. You probably use a printer to print home­
work assignments, photographs, and web pages. Printers translate information that 
has been processed by the system unit and present the information on paper. Printer 
output is often called hard copy.
Features
There are many different types of printers. Almost all, however, have some basic 
distinguishing features, including resolution, color capability, speed, memory, and 
duplex printing.
 • Resolution for a printer is similar to monitor resolution. It is a measure of the 
clarity of images produced. Printer resolution, however, is measured in dpi 
(dots per inch). (See Figure 6-23.) Most printers designed for personal use aver­
age 1,200 by 4,800 dpi. The higher the dpi, the better the quality of images 
produced.
 • Color capability is provided by most printers today. Users typically have the option 
to print either with just black ink or with color. Because it is more expensive to 
print in color, most users select black ink for letters, drafts, and homework. The 
most common black ink selection is grayscale, in which images are displayed 
using many shades of gray. Color is used more selectively for final reports contain­
ing graphics and for photographs.
 • Speed is measured in the number of pages printed per minute. Typically, printers 
for personal use average 15 to 19 pages per minute for single-color (black) output 
and 13 to 15 pages per minute for color output.
 • Memory within a printer is used to store printing instructions and documents 
waiting to be printed. The more memory, the faster it will be able to print large 
documents.
 • Duplex printing allows automatic printing on both sides of a sheet of paper. 
Although not currently a standard feature for all printers, it will likely become 
standard in the future as a way to reduce paper waste and to protect the 
environment.
Inkjet Printers
Inkjet printers spray ink at high speed onto the surface of paper. This process pro­
duces high-quality images in a variety of colors, making it ideal for printing photos. 
Have you considered the 
environmental impact of using 
your inkjet printer? Whenever 
possible, don’t print. Use e-mail 
attachments, and encourage 
your school to use web 
technologies that let students 
upload their schoolwork. If you 
must print, buy ink cartridges 
that are made with mostly 
recycled plastic. And when your 
ink runs out, bring the cartridge 
to a retailer that will make sure 
it is recycled. Many retailers 
often offer a discount on a new 
cartridge when you turn in an 
empty one.

chapter 6
(See Figure  6-24.) Inkjet printers are relatively inexpensive and are the 
most widely used printers. In addition, they are reliable and quiet. The 
most costly aspect of inkjet printers is replacing the ink cartridges. For this 
reason, most users specify black ink for the majority of print jobs and use 
the more expensive color printing for select applications. Typical inkjet 
printers produce 15 to 19 pages per minute of black-only output and 13 to 
15 pages of color output.
Laser Printers
The laser printer uses a technology similar to that used in a photocopying 
machine. Laser printers use a laser light beam to produce images with 
excellent letter and graphics quality. More expensive than inkjet printers, laser print-
ers are faster and are used in applications requiring high-quality output.
There are two categories of laser printers. Personal laser printers are less expensive 
and are used by a single user. They typically can print 15 to 17 pages a minute. Shared 
laser printers typically support color, are more expensive, and are used (shared) by a 
group of users. Shared laser printers typically print over 50 pages a minute.
3D Printers
3D printers, also known as additive manufacturing, create three-­dimensional 
shapes by adding very thin layer after layer of material until the final shape is fully 
formed. (See Figure 6-25.) There are a variety of different processes and materials 
that can be used to create each layer. One of the most common sprays a liquid plas-
tic or plasticlike substance through a nozzle similar to an 
inkjet printer.
3D printers are controlled by data describing the shape 
of the object to be created. This data typically comes from 
a file created by a 3D modeling program or from scan-
ning a physical model using a 3D scanner. Specialized 
programs then take this data and further process it to 
create data describing hundreds or thousands of horizon-
tal layers that when placed one on top of another form 
the shape of the intended object. The printer uses this 
data by extruding or cutting the first layer to very exact 
specifications. Successive layers are then created and 
attached to the layer below it until the product is final-
ized. The layers are so thin and so precise that they blend 
together, making a final product that shows no sign of 
the ­individual layers.
Commercial 3D printers have been used for decades. 
Their cost, however, limited them to specialized manufacturing and research applica-
tions. Recently, however, their cost has dropped to as low as $200, making them avail-
able to individuals.
Other Printers
There are several other types of printers. These printers include cloud printers, ther-
mal printers, and plotters:
 • Cloud printers are printers connected to the Internet that provide printing ser-
vices to others on the Internet. Google Cloud Print is a service that supports cloud 
printing. Once a user activates a printer using the Google Chrome OS, the user 
can access that printer anywhere with a smartphone or any other type of com-
puter that is connected to the Internet. For example, you could use a smartphone 
from almost anywhere to send documents to be printed on a printer located at 
your home or school.

 • Thermal printers use heat elements to produce images on heat-sensitive  
paper. These printers are widely used with ATMs and gasoline pumps  
to print receipts.
 • Plotters are special-purpose printers for producing a wide range of specialized 
output. Using output from graphics tablets and other graphical input devices, plot-
ters create maps, images, and architectural and engineering drawings. Plotters are 
typically used by graphic artists, engineers, and architects to print out designs, 
sketches, and drawings.
privacy
Did you know that your printer 
may be identifying itself in 
every document that it creates? 
Some color printers print nearly 
invisible dots in the margins of 
all printed documents. These 
microscopic dots form a code 
that can be used to trace 
the printed page back to the 
printer that generated it. Printer 
manufacturers secretly developed 
this code with the U.S. Secret 
Service to assist in counterfeiting 
investigations. Some privacy 
experts suggest that it is 
inappropriate to track equipment 
without the owner’s consent.

Audio-Output Devices
Audio-output devices translate audio information from the computer into sounds 
that people can understand. The most widely used audio-output devices are ­speakers 
and headphones. (See Figure 6-26.) These devices connect to a sound card within 
the system unit. This connection can be by cable to an audio jack on the system 
unit, or the connection can be wireless. Wireless connections typically use Blue-
tooth technology. This type of connection requires special Bluetooth-enabled speak-
ers and/or headphones. Bluetooth will be discussed further in Chapter 8. The sound 
card is used to capture as well as play back recorded sounds. Audio-output devices 
are used to play music, vocalize translations from one language to another, and com-
municate information from the computer system to users.
Creating voice output is not anywhere near as difficult as recognizing and inter-
preting voice input. In fact, voice output is quite common. It is used with many smart-
phones, cars, and soft drink machines. It is used as a reinforcement tool for learning, 
such as to help students study a foreign language. It also is used in many supermarkets 
at the checkout counter to confirm purchases. One of its most powerful capabilities is 
to assist the physically challenged.
Combination Input and Output Devices
Many devices combine input and output capabilities. Sometimes this is done to save 
space. Other times it is done for very specialized applications. Common combination 
devices include headsets, multifunctional devices, telephones, drones, robots, and vir-
tual reality headgear and gloves.
Headsets
Headsets combine the functionality of microphones and headphones. The micro-
phone accepts audible input and headphones provide audio output. Headsets are an 
integral part of serious video game systems. (See Figure 6-27.)

Multifunctional Devices
Multifunctional devices (MFD) typically combine the capabilities of a scanner, printer, 
fax, and copy machine. These multifunctional devices offer a cost and space advan­
tage. They cost about the same as a good printer or copy machine but require much 
less space than the single-function devices they replace. Their disadvantages are lower 
quality and unreliability. The output quality for any one function is often not quite as 
good as that of the separate single-purpose devices. The reliability of multifunctional 
devices suffers because problems with one of the functional parts can make the entire 
device inoperable. Even so, multifunctional devices are widely used in home and small 
business offices.
Telephones
Telephones are input and output devices for receiving and sending voice communica­
tion. Voice over IP (VoIP) is a set of standards or technologies that support voice and 
other types of communication over the Internet. Telephony, also known as Internet 
Telephony, is the VoIP application that uses Internet rather than traditional telephone 
lines to support voice communication.
There are many VoIP services available for free that do not require any dedicated 
hardware. Examples of these services are Skype from Microsoft, Hangouts from 
Google, and FaceTime from Apple. Once you subscribe to a service, you can use your 
smartphone or other type of computer to con­
nect to any other subscriber. These services are 
free and support video as well as audio; however, 
both parties must have their computers on and be 
logged in to the service to send and receive calls. 
For an additional fee, Skype allows you to call 
non-Skype subscribers directly on their phone. To 
learn more about Skype, see Making IT Work for 
You: Skype, on pages 157–158.
Drones
Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), were 
once too expensive for anything but military bud­
gets. However, today’s drones are inexpensive, 
faster, and smarter, making them a valuable tool 
and fun high-tech toy. (See Figure  6-28.) Most 
drones take input from a controller from either a 
radio joystick or a Wi-Fi connected tablet or lap­
top. The drones act as an output device, sending 
back video and sound to the user. The resulting 
combination of video and aerial maneuverability 
has made drones a popular choice for a wide vari­
ety of activities ranging from amateur cinematog­
raphers to civil engineers.
Robots
Like drones, robotics has become relatively inex­
pensive with expanding capabilities. Robots use 
cameras, microphones, and other sensors as 
inputs. Based on these inputs, robotic outputs can 
be as complex as exploring damaged nuclear reac­
tors to as simple as taking a photo. Robots can be 
found almost everywhere including in a home vac­
uuming floors, in a factory assembling cars, on a 
farm sorting produce, and in hospitals assisting in 
surgery. (See Figure 6-29.)

Making IT work for you
SKYPE
Do you already use a communication tool that lets you keep in touch with your friends and family? Does that 
tool include the ability to have face-to-face conversations, share files and screens, and make calls to those 
not connected to the Internet? Skype is a well-known tool that offers all these services, most of them for 
free. This section will help you explore some of Skype’s features. (Please note that the web is continually 
changing, and some of the specifics presented below may have changed.)
Getting Started  In order to enjoy all the benefits of Skype, 
it is recommended that your computer have speakers, a 
microphone, and a webcam. If you have a laptop or tablet, 
these are all likely integrated. Follow these steps to create 
your account and install Skype on your machine:
	 1	 •	 Visit www.skype.com, and click the Download 
Skype link.
	2	 •	 Enter the required information to create your 
Skype account. When you are finished, the 
software will be downloaded automatically. Do 
not purchase any Skype credits at the moment.
	3	 •	 Run the downloaded setup file, and follow the 
prompts to install Skype on your machine.
	4	 •	 Log in to your Skype account on the welcome 
screen, and follow the prompts to make sure 
your audio and video are working.
Adding Contacts  You can find friends or other contacts manually, or you can import them from your address book on Face­
book, Outlook, and several other services. To add a contact manually:
	 1	 •	 Click next to the blue magnifying glass on the left 
of the window under your log-in information.
	2	 •	 Enter the name, Skype name, or e-mail address 
you know about your contact, and hit Enter.
	3	 •	 Skype will display matches. Click the one that 
matches your contact’s details, and then click the 
Add to Contacts button.
Your contact must accept your request before you can see 
his or her online status.

158
Skype-to-Skype Communication  When two individuals have Skype accounts, they can contact each other (for free) using a 
variety of methods, from voice or video calls to instant messages. They can exchange files and share screens with each other. 
Please note that for videoconferencing between three or more people, you must have a premium or business account.
	 1	 •	 From the main screen, click on the contact you 
wish to communicate with.
	2	 •	 Click the blue video camera button to make a 
video call or the blue handset button to make a 
voice call. Once your contact accepts the call, 
your interface will change.
	3	 •	 During the call, you have the ability to send 
instant messages and turn audio and/or video on 
or off by clicking the buttons at the bottom.
	4	 •	 To send files or share screens, click the Plus 
(+) button at the bottom. You could also have 
initiated the Send File feature from the contact 
screen without having to place a call.
	5	 •	 To hang up, press the red handset button at the bottom.
Calling Landline or Mobile Phones (VoIP)  Skype can use 
your Internet connection to place a call to any phone in the 
world. This is not a free service, but the costs are low. You 
can pay as you go with Skype credits, or sign up for a monthly 
subscription.
	 1	 •	 From the menu bar, select Call, and select Call 
Phones.
	2	 •	 Click the handset button after entering the phone 
number.

Virtual Reality Headgear and Gloves
Virtual reality (VR) is an artificial, or simulated, reality 
created in 3D by computers. It strives to create a virtual or 
immersive experience by using specialized hardware that 
includes headgear and gloves. (See Figure 6-30.)
The headgear has earphones and three-dimensional 
stereoscopic screens. The gloves have sensors that collect 
data about your hand movements. Coupled with software, 
this interactive sensory equipment lets you immerse your­
self in a computer-generated world.
There are any number of applications for virtual real­
ity headgear and gloves. Automobile manufacturers use 
virtual reality to evaluate what it would be like to sit in 
the cars they have designed but not yet built. Virtual real­
ity is becoming a standard for high-end video games and 
for immersive movies. Sony and Facebook have heavily 
invested in VR headsets as the future of computer interaction. Virtual reality promises 
to become commonplace in the near future.

Ergonomics
People use computers to enrich their personal and private lives. There are ways, how­
ever, that computers can make people less productive and even harm their health. 
Anyone who frequently uses a computer can be affected. As a result, there has been 
great interest in a field known as ergonomics.
Ergonomics (pronounced “er-guh-nom-ix”) is defined as the study of human factors 
related to things people use. It is concerned with fitting the task to the user rather 
than forcing the user to contort to do the task. For computer users and manufacturers 
this means designing input and output devices to increase ease of use and to avoid 
health risks.
Sitting in front of a screen in awkward positions for long periods may lead to 
physical problems such as eyestrain, headaches, and back pain. Computer users can 
alleviate these problems by taking frequent rest breaks and by using well-designed 
computer furniture. Some recommendations by ergonomics experts are illustrated in 
Figure 6-31.
Other recommendations to avoid physical discomfort are
 • Eyestrain and headache: To make the computer easier on the eyes, take a 
15-­minute break every hour or two. Keep everything you’re focusing on at about 
the same distance. For example, the computer screen, keyboard, and a document 
holder containing your work might be positioned about 20 inches away. Clean the 
screen of dust from time to time.
 • Back and neck pain: To help avoid back and neck problems, make sure your 
equipment is adjustable. You should be able to adjust your chair for height and 
angle, and the chair should have good back support. The monitor should be at eye 
level or slightly below eye level. Use a footrest, if necessary, to reduce leg fatigue.

160	 chapter 6
 • Repetitive strain injury: Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is any injury that is caused 
by fast, repetitive work that can generate neck, wrist, hand, and arm pain. RSI is 
by far the greatest cause of workplace illnesses, resulting in compensation claims 
totaling billions of dollars and lost productivity every year. One particular type 
of RSI, carpal tunnel syndrome, found among heavy computer users, consists of 
damage to nerves and tendons in the hands. Some victims report the pain is so 
intense that they cannot open doors or shake hands and that they require cor­
rective surgery. Ergonomically correct keyboards have been developed to help 
prevent injury from heavy computer use. (See Figure 6-32.) In addition to using 
ergonomic keyboards, you should take frequent short rest breaks and gently mas­
sage your hands.

Portable Computers
While the above recommendations apply to all personal computers, the design of por­
table computers including laptops, tablets, and smartphones presents some specific 
ergonomic challenges.
 • Laptops: Almost all laptops have attached keyboards and screens. Unfortunately, 
it is impossible to optimally position either for safe ergonomic use. When the 
screen is positioned appropriately at eye level, the keyboard is too high. When the 
keyboard is appropriately positioned, the screen is too low. To minimize the nega­
tive impact, raise the level of the screen by using books or reams of paper under 
the laptop and attach an external keyboard to be used at waist level.
 • Tablets: Almost all tablets use a virtual keyboard and are designed to be held in your 
hands, flat on a table, or slightly angled. These design features cause the user to 
improperly align his or her head to the viewing surface, often causing neck and back 
pain. This problem, sometimes referred to as tablet hunch, can be minimized by tak­
ing frequent breaks, moving around while working, using a tablet cover or stand that 
allows the screen to be tipped at various angles, and using an external keyboard.
 • Smartphones: Today, smartphones are more likely to be used for texting than talking. 
As a result, thumbs are often used to type on a tiny keyboard. The result can be a pain 
at the base or in the muscles of the thumb or wrist. This problem, sometimes referred 
to as BlackBerry thumb, can be minimized by keeping wrists straight (not bent), head 
up, and shoulders straight and frequently resting thumbs by using other fingers.
In today’s world, it is important to protect yourself by using computers appropriately.

Careers in IT
Technical writers prepare instruction manuals, technical reports, and 
other scientific or technical documents. Most technical writers work 
for computer software firms, government agencies, or research institu­
tions. They translate technical information into easily understandable 
instructions or summaries. As new technology continues to develop 
and expand, the need for technical writers who can communicate tech­
nical expertise to others is expected to increase.
Technical writing positions typically require an associate’s or a bach­
elor’s degree in communications, journalism, or English and a special­
ization in, or familiarity with, a technical field. However, individuals 
with strong writing skills sometimes transfer from jobs in the sciences 
to positions in technical writing.
Technical writers can expect to earn an annual salary in the range of 
$44,000 to $58,000. Advancement opportunities can be limited within 
a firm or company, but there are additional opportunities in consulting.
Now that you’ve learned about input and out­
put devices, I’d like to tell you about my career 
as a technical writer.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Augmented Reality Displays
Have you ever run into someone who looks familiar, but you 
cannot remember her name or where you know her from? 
What about finding yourself in an unfamiliar town, constantly 
having to look at your smartphone or GPS to get directions? 
Computers and the World Wide Web offer unrivaled infor­
mation at the press of a button, but inputs have been limited 
to desktops and keyboards. Smartphone cameras, GPS, and 
screens now offer real-time, location-specific information to a 
user. In the future, with wearable augmented reality displays, 
information will appear instantly, right before your eyes. 
Data from your computer and the 
Internet will become instantly acces­
sible and viewable without having to 
access another device. The reality 
you see in front of you is improved, 
or augmented, with additional visual 
information using projected images. 
Technology has been improving our 
interactions with the real world, and 
will continue to evolve to improve 
our lives as we look to the future.
Bringing up information about 
a visual image is not new. Several 
search engines already have the 
ability to identify an image simply by 
looking for similar images in their 
databases. In addition, many types 
of software can recognize faces 
by looking at key points in the facial structure in order to 
identify the individual. These augmented reality displays will 
take that technology one step further by integrating it with 
wearable glasses or contact lenses. Whether you look at a 
landmark, textbook, or person, the computer connected to 
that display will be able to retrieve the information you need 
and place it in your field of vision. So if you forgot the name 
of the person greeting you in the coffee shop, do not worry. 
Her name and brief biography will be retrieved from her 
social networking account and be displayed in front of you in 
time to properly return the greeting.
Identification of people and objects is not the only use 
of augmented reality. As technology continues to shrink in 
size, the device will be able to perform all the tasks of your 
smartphone. You will be able to look at the sky and see infor­
mation about today’s weather. Text message and incoming 
call notifications can appear in front of you. Prices from vari­
ous online stores will appear by the time you ask your friend 
where he got that new T-shirt. And, of course, integrated 
GPS will display arrows in front of you and guide you as you 
walk through unfamiliar city streets.
Although this technology will likely be available in the 
next few years, there are some challenges. First, you have 
the issue of powering the device. Some devices, such 
as a pair of glasses or contact lenses, may not be large 
enough to include a battery capable of powering for all 
day. Another issue involves limita­
tions of human vision. Normally, 
our eyes find it difficult to focus 
on objects that are placed very 
close to them. Researchers have 
come up with various solutions to 
fix this problem, but they need to 
make it comfortable for the eyes to 
shift focus between the information 
being projected up close and the 
real-world object that could be far 
away. Lastly, there is the issue of 
comfort. Will these glasses or con­
tact lenses be comfortable to wear 
all day? Will they make you look 
strange to those who do not know 
about augmented reality?
Many companies and universities 
are working on various types of augmented reality displays. 
There are a few that have received funding from the military 
in order to assist soldiers and pilots. The ones that seem 
closest to release for the general public are from Google. 
Prototype eyeglasses from its “Project Glass” division are 
already being tested by various Google employees. With the 
release of Windows 10, Microsoft introduced HoloLens, an 
augmented reality headset with embedded Windows soft­
ware that allows the user to interact with the digital and real 
world through a pair of special glasses. Now that you have 
learned more about augmented reality, do you see yourself 
wearing these sorts of eyeglasses when they become afford­
able? Do you think that they can end up being a dangerous 
distraction?

VISUAL SUMMARY
KEYBOARDS
Input is any data or instructions that are used by a com­
puter. Input devices translate words, numbers, sounds, 
images, and gestures that people understand into a form 
that the system unit can process. These include keyboards 
and pointing, scanning, image capturing, and audio-input 
devices.
Keyboards convert numbers, letters, and special char­
acters that people understand into electrical signals. These 
signals are sent to, and processed by, the system unit.
Keyboards
There are four basic categories of keyboards: traditional, 
laptop, virtual, and thumb.
 • Traditional keyboards, used on desktop and larger 
computers. Standard keyboard has 101 keys. Toggle 
keys turn features on and off. Combination keys 
perform actions when combinations of keys are held 
down.
 • Laptop keyboards, used on laptop computers. Smaller 
than traditional keyboard with fewer keys. Typically 
does not have numeric keypad or standard location for 
function and navigation keys.
 • Virtual keyboard, primarily used on mobile devices 
and tablets. Does not have a physical keyboard. Keys 
displayed on screen and selected by pressing a key’s 
image.
 • Thumb keyboard, used on smartphones and other 
small mobile devices. Designed primarily for commu­
nicating via texting and connecting to the web.
POINTING DEVICES
Pointing devices provide an intuitive interface with the 
system unit by accepting physical movements or gestures 
and converting them into machine-readable input.
Mouse
A mouse controls a pointer that is displayed on the moni­
tor. The mouse pointer usually appears in the shape of 
an arrow. Some mice have a wheel button that rotates to 
scroll through information on the monitor. Optical mouse 
is the most widely used. A cordless or wireless mouse uses 
radio waves or infrared light waves. A touch pad operates 
by touching or tapping a surface. It is widely used instead 
of a mouse with laptops and some types of mobile devices.
Touch Screens
Touch screens allow users to select actions by touching 
the screen with a finger or penlike device. Multitouch 
screens accept multiple-finger commands.
Game Controllers
Game controllers provide input to computer games. 
Widely used controllers include gaming mice, joysticks, 
gamepads, and motion-sensing devices.
Stylus
A stylus is typically used with tablets and mobile devices. 
Often, a stylus interacts with handwriting recognition 
software to translate handwritten notes into a form that 
the system unit can process.
Input and Output

164	
chapter 6
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be aware of the most commonly used input and output devices. 
These devices are translators for information into and out of the system unit. Input devices translate words, sounds, 
and actions into symbols the system unit can process. Output devices translate symbols from the system unit into 
words, images, and sounds that people can understand.
SCANNING DEVICES
Scanning devices move across text and images to convert 
them into a form that the system unit can process.
Optical Scanners
An optical scanner (scanner) converts documents into 
machine-readable form. The four basic types are flatbed, 
document, portable, and 3D.
Card Readers
Card readers interpret encoded information located on a 
variety of cards. The most common is the magnetic card 
reader that reads information from a thin magnetic strip 
on the back of a card. Smart cards contain microchips to 
encrypt data and improve security.
Bar Code Readers
Bar code readers or scanners (either handheld wand read­
ers or platform scanners) read bar codes on products. 
There are a variety of different codes including the UPC 
and MaxiCode codes.
RFID Readers
RFID readers read RFID (radio-frequency identification) 
tags. These tags are widely used for tracking lost pets, pro­
duction, and inventory and for recording prices and prod­
uct descriptions.
Character and Mark Recognition Devices
Character and mark recognition devices are scanners that 
are able to recognize special characters and marks. Three 
types are magnetic-ink character recognition (MICR), 
optical-character recognition (OCR), and optical-mark 
recognition (OMR).
IMAGE CAPTURING DEVICES
Image capturing devices create or capture original images. 
These devices include digital cameras and webcams.
Digital Cameras
Digital cameras record images digitally and store them on 
a memory card or in the camera’s memory. Most digital 
cameras record video too.
Webcams
Webcams are specialized digital video cameras that cap­
ture images and send them to a computer for broadcast 
over the Internet. Webcams are built into many smart­
phones and tablets, while others are attached to the com­
puter monitor.
AUDIO-INPUT DEVICES
Audio-input devices convert sounds into a form that can 
be processed by the system unit. By far the most widely 
used audio-input device is the microphone.
Voice Recognition Systems
Voice recognition systems use a microphone, a sound 
card, and special software. Siri, Cortana, and Google Now 
are digital assistants that use voice recognition. Special­
ized portable voice recorders are widely used by doctors, 
lawyers, and others to record dictation. Some systems are 
able to translate dictation from one language to another, 
such as from English to Japanese.

	
Input and Output	 165
MONITORS
Output is processed data or information. Output devices 
are hardwareised to provide or create output. Monitors 
(­display screens) are the most-used output device. Output 
is often referred to as soft copy.
Features
Monitor clarity is a function of resolution (matrix of ­pixels, 
or picture elements), dot pitch, contrast ratio, size (active 
display area), and aspect ratio.
Flat-Panel Monitors
Flat-panel monitors are the most widely used monitor. 
Three basic types are LCD (liquid crystal display), LED 
(light-emitting diode), and OLED (organic light-emitting 
diode).
Curved Monitors
Curved monitors have concave screens, provide ­better 
­viewing angles, and are widely used for high-end televisions.
E-book Readers
E-books (electronic books) are traditional printed books 
in electronic format. E-book readers (e-readers) store and 
display e-books and other electronic media. They use 
e-ink technology.
Other Monitors
Other types of monitors include digital (interactive) 
whiteboards, ultra-high-definition television (UHDTV), 
and digital projectors.
PRINTERS
Printers translate information processed by the system 
unit and present the information on paper. Printer output 
is often called hard copy.
Features
Basic features include resolution measured in dpi (dots 
per inch), color capability (most common black ink selec­
tion is grayscale), speed, memory, and duplex (both sides 
of paper) printing.
Inkjet
Inkjet printers spray ink at high speed onto the surface 
of paper. They are the most widely used type of printer, 
reliable, quiet, and inexpensive. The most costly aspect of 
inkjet printers is replacing the ink cartridges.
Laser
Laser printers use technology similar to photocopying 
machine. There are two categories: personal and shared.
3D Printer
3D printers (additive manufacturing) create objects by 
adding layers of material onto one another. They have 
been available for decades; however, recent price reduc­
tions have increased their popularity.
Other Printers
There are several other types of printers, including cloud 
printers (Google Cloud Print is a cloud printing service), 
thermal printers (use heat elements to produce images on 
heat-sensitive paper), and plotters (use data from graphics 
tablets and other graphical devices).

166	 chapter 6
AUDIO-OUTPUT DEVICES
Audio-output devices translate audio information from 
the computer into sounds that people can understand. The 
most widely used are speakers and headphones. These 
devices connect either by cable to an audio jack on the sys­
tem unit or by a wireless connection. Bluetooth technology 
is widely used to connect wireless devices.
COMBINATION INPUT AND OUTPUT 
DEVICES
Combination devices combine input and output capabili­
ties. Devices within this category include:
 • Multifunctional devices (MFD) typically combine 
capabilities of scanner, printer, fax, and copy machine.
 • Headsets combine the functionality of microphones 
and headphones; integral part of serious video game 
systems.
 • Telephones are input and output devices. Voice over 
IP (VoIP) supports voice and other types of com­
munication over the Internet. Telephony (Internet 
Telephony) is a VoIP application that uses Internet to 
support voice communication.
 • Drones (unmanned aerial vehicles, UAV) take input 
from a controller and send output video and sound to 
the user.
 • Robots use cameras, microphones, and other sensors 
as inputs; outputs can be as complex as exploring dam­
aged nuclear reactors to as simple as taking a photo.
 • Virtual reality (VR) creates 3D simulated immersive 
experiences. VR hardware includes headgear and 
gloves.
ERGONOMICS
Ergonomics is the study of human factors related to things 
people use.
Recommendations
Some recommendations to avoid physical discomfort 
associated with heavy computer use:
 • To avoid eyestrain and headache, take a 15-minute 
break every hour; keep everything you’re focusing on 
at the same distance; and clean the screen periodically.
 • To avoid back and neck pain, use adjustable equip­
ment; adjust chairs for height, angle, and back sup­
port; position monitors at eye level or slightly below. 
Use footrest, if necessary, to reduce leg fatigue.
 • To avoid repetitive strain injury (RSI) and carpal 
­tunnel syndrome, use ergonomically correct key­
boards; take frequent, short rest breaks; and gently 
massage hands.
Portable Computers
The design of portable computers presents ergonomic 
challenges.
 • Laptops do not allow correct positioning of keyboard 
and screen; raise level of laptop and use external 
keyboard.
 • Tablets with virtual keyboards cause improper align­
ment of user’s head; take frequent breaks, move while 
working, use cover or stand, use external keyboard.
 • Smartphones require extensive use of thumbs; keep 
wrists straight, head up, and shoulders straight and 
use other fingers.
CAREERS IN IT
Technical writers prepare instruction manuals, technical 
reports, and other documents. An associate’s or a bache­
lor’s degree in communication, journalism, or English and 
a specialization in, or familiarity with, a technical field are 
required. Salary range is $44,000 to $58,000.

Learning Objectives
After you have read this chapter, you should be able to:
	1	 Distinguish between primary and secondary storage.
	2	 Identify the important characteristics of secondary storage including media, capacity, storage 
devices, and access speed.
	3	 Describe hard-disk platters, tracks, sectors, cylinders, and head crashes.
	4	 Compare internal and external hard drives.
	5	 Compare performance enhancements including disk caching, RAID, file compression, and file 
decompression.
	6	 Define optical storage including compact discs, digital versatile discs, and Blu-ray discs.
	7	 Define solid-state storage including solid-state drives, flash memory cards, and USB drives.
	8	 Define cloud storage and cloud storage services.
	9	 Describe mass storage, mass storage devices, enterprise storage systems, and storage area 
networks.
If you don’t have the right secondary storage, your computer will 
slow to a crawl, your digital camera won’t take pictures, and your 
phone won’t be able to run apps. In the future, that will likely not 
be a problem as we will see storage types that can hold the entire 
U.S. Library of Congress on a single disk the size of a coin and 
store information in holograms or even organic molecules.
This chapter covers the things you need to know to be prepared 
for this ever-changing digital world, including:
• Hard drives—get the right hard drive on your computer to meet 
all your needs.
• Optical discs—share digital information on Blu-ray, CD, or DVD.
• Solid-state storage—make your portable electronics faster and 
use less power.
• Cloud storage—store your information safely and securely on 
the Internet.

chapter 7
Storage
An essential feature of every computer is the ability to save, or store, information. 
As discussed in Chapter 5, random-access memory (RAM) holds or stores data and 
programs that the CPU is presently processing. Before data can be processed or a 
program can be run, it must be in RAM. For this reason, RAM is sometimes referred 
to as primary storage.
Unfortunately, most RAM provides only temporary or volatile storage. That is, 
it loses all of its contents as soon as the computer is turned off. Its contents also 
are lost if there is a power failure that disrupts the electric current going into the 
system unit. This volatility results in a need for more permanent or nonvolatile 
storage for data and programs. We also need external storage because users need 
much more storage capacity than is typically available in a computer’s primary or 
RAM memory.
Secondary storage provides permanent or nonvolatile storage. Using secondary 
storage devices such as a hard-disk drive, data and programs can be retained after 
the computer has been shut off. This is accomplished by writing files to and reading 
files from secondary storage devices. Writing is the process of saving information 
Introduction
Secondary storage devices are used to save, back up, and even transport 
files consisting of data or programs from one location or computer to 
another. At one time, almost all files contained only numbers and letters. 
The demands for saving these files were easily met with low-capacity stor­
age devices.
Data storage has expanded from text and numeric files to include digital 
music files, photographic files, video files, and much more. These new types 
of files require secondary storage devices that have much greater capacity.
Secondary storage devices have always been an indispensable element 
in any computer system. They have similarities to output and input devices. 
Like output devices, secondary storage devices receive information from 
the system unit in the form of the machine language of 0s and 1s. Rather 
than translating the information, however, secondary storage devices save 
the information in machine language for later use. Like input devices, sec­
ondary storage devices send information to the system unit for processing. 
However, the information, since it is already in machine form, does not 
need to be translated. It is sent directly to memory (RAM), where it can be 
accessed and processed by the CPU.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be aware of the 
different types of secondary storage. You need to know the capabilities, limi­
tations, and uses of hard disks, solid-state drives, optical discs, cloud storage, 
and other types of secondary storage. Additionally, you need to be aware of 
specialty storage devices for portable computers and to be knowledgeable 
about how large organizations manage their extensive data resources.
Hi, I’m James, and I’m a disaster recovery 
specialist. I’d like to talk with you about sec­
ondary storage, one of the most critical parts 
of any computer system. I’d also like to talk 
about various cloud storage services.

to the secondary storage device. Reading is the process of accessing 
information from secondary storage. This chapter focuses on second­
ary storage devices.
These are important characteristics of secondary storage:
 • Media are the physical material that holds the data and programs. 
(See Figure 7-1.)
 • Capacity measures how much a particular storage medium can 
hold.
 • Storage devices are hardware that reads data and programs from 
storage media. Most also write to storage media.
 • Access speed measures the amount of time required by the storage 
device to retrieve data and programs.
Most desktop personal computer systems have hard-disk and optical disc 
drives, as well as ports where additional storage devices can be connected.
Hard Disks
Hard disks save files by altering the magnetic charges of the disk’s 
surface to represent 1s and 0s. Hard disks retrieve data and programs 
by reading these charges from the magnetic disk. Characters are rep­
resented by positive (+) and negative (-) charges using the ASCII, EBCDIC, or 
Unicode binary codes. For example, the letter A would require a series of 8 charges. 
(See Figure 7-2.) Density refers to how tightly these charges can be packed next to 
one another on the disk.
Hard disks use rigid metallic platters that are stacked one on top of another. Hard 
disks store and organize files using tracks, sectors, and cylinders. Tracks are rings of con­
centric circles on the platter. Each track is divided into invisible wedge-shaped sections 
called sectors. (See Figure 7-3.) A cylinder runs through each track of a stack of platters. 
Cylinders are necessary to differentiate files stored on the same track and sector of differ­
ent platters. When a hard disk is formatted, tracks, sectors, and cylinders are assigned.

chapter 7
Hard disks are sensitive instruments. Their 
read/write heads ride on a cushion of air about 
0.000001 inch thick. It is so thin that a smoke 
particle, fingerprint, dust, or human hair could 
cause what is known as a head crash. (See 
Figure 7-4.)
A head crash occurs when a read-write head 
makes contact with the hard disk’s surface or with 
particles on its surface. A head crash is a disaster 
for a hard disk. The disk surface is scratched, and 
some or all of the data is destroyed. At one time, 
head crashes were commonplace. Now, fortu­
nately, they are rare.
There are two basic types of hard disks: inter­
nal and external.
Internal Hard Disk
An internal hard disk is located inside the system unit. These hard disks are able 
to store and retrieve large quantities of information quickly. They are used to store 
programs and data files. For example, nearly every personal computer uses its 
internal hard disk to store its operating system and major applications such as Word 
and Excel.
To ensure adequate performance of your internal hard disk and the safety of your 
data, you should perform routine maintenance and periodically make backup cop­
ies of all important files. For hard-disk maintenance and backup procedures, refer to 
Chapter 4’s coverage of the Windows utilities File History, Disk Cleanup, and Opti­
mize Drives.
External Hard Drives
While internal hard disks provide fast access, they have a fixed amount of storage and 
cannot be easily removed from the system unit. External hard disks provide slower 
access and are typically connected to a USB or Thunderbolt port on the system unit 
and are easily removed. Like an internal hard disk, external hard disks have a fixed 
amount of storage. However, since each removable hard disk can be easily replaced by 
another removable hard disk, a single port on the system unit can provide access to an 
unlimited amount of storage. (See Figure 7-5.)
External hard drives use the same basic technology as internal hard disks and are 
used primarily to complement an internal hard disk. Because they are easily removed, 
they are particularly useful to protect or secure sensitive information. Other uses for 
external drives include backing up the contents of the internal hard disk and provid­
ing additional hard-disk capacity.
Performance Enhancements
Three ways to improve the performance of hard disks are disk cach­
ing, redundant arrays of inexpensive disks, and file compression/
decompression.
Disk caching improves hard-disk performance by anticipating 
data needs. It performs a function similar to cache memory dis­
cussed in Chapter 5. While cache memory improves processing by 
acting as a temporary high-speed holding area between memory 
and the CPU, disk caching improves processing by acting as a tem­
porary high-speed holding area between a secondary storage device 
and the CPU. Disk caching requires a combination of hardware 
and software. During idle processing time, frequently used data is

automatically identified and 
read from the hard disk into 
the disk cache. When needed, 
the data is then accessed 
directly from memory. The 
transfer rate from memory 
is much faster than from the 
hard disk. As a result, overall 
system performance is often 
increased by as much as 30 
percent.
Redundant arrays of inex­
pensive disks (RAID) improve 
performance by expanding 
external storage, improving 
access speed, and providing 
reliable storage. Several inex­
pensive hard-disk drives are 
connected to one another. 
These connections can be by a 
network or within specialized 
RAID devices. (See Figure 7-6.) The connected hard-disk drives are related or grouped 
together, and the computer system interacts with the RAID system as though it were 
a single large-capacity hard-disk drive. The result is expanded storage capability, fast 
access speed, and high reliability. For these reasons, RAID is often used by Internet 
servers and large organizations.
File compression and file decompression increase storage capacity by reducing the 
amount of space required to store data and programs. File compression is not limited 
to hard-disk systems. It is frequently used to compress files on DVDs, CDs, and flash 
drives as well. File compression also helps to speed up transmission of files from one 
computer system to another. Sending and receiving compressed files across the Inter­
net is a common activity.
File compression programs scan files for ways to 
reduce the amount of required storage. One way is 
to search for repeating patterns. The repeating pat­
terns are replaced with a token, leaving enough tokens 
so that the original can be rebuilt or decompressed. 
These programs often shrink files to a quarter of their 
original size.
Windows and Mac operating systems provide 
compression and decompression utilities. For more 
advanced compression schemes, you can use special­
ized utilities such as WinZip. For a summary of perfor­
mance enhancement techniques, see Figure 7-7.
Figure 7-6  RAID storage device
privacy
Did you know that when you 
sell your computer, you might 
be selling all your data as well? 
When you delete a file, the 
computer does not remove 
the data. It simply makes that 
hard-disk space available to be 
written on in the future. If you 
accidentally delete a file, file 
recovery software is available 
to check the hard disk to see if 
the data is still there and has 
not been overwritten yet. In 
the same way that data can be 
recovered when accidentally 
deleted, thieves can recover 
data that was intentionally 
deleted. To confidently delete 
files, use a secure deletion 
utility before selling a computer.

chapter 7
Solid-State Storage
Unlike hard disks, which rotate and have read/write heads that move in and out, 
solid-state storage devices have no moving parts. Data and information are stored 
and retrieved electronically directly from these devices much as they would be from 
conventional computer memory.
Solid-state storage devices provide access to flash memory, also known as solid-
state storage. As we discussed in Chapter 5, flash memory offers a combination of 
features of RAM and ROM. Like RAM it can be updated and like ROM it does not 
lose information when a computer is turned off. Flash memory is a little slower than 
traditional memory but much faster than traditional hard disks.
Solid-State Drives
Solid-state drives (SSDs) are designed to be connected inside a personal computer 
system the same way an internal hard disk would be but contain solid-state memory 
instead of magnetic disks to store data. (See Figure 7-8.) SSDs are faster and more 
durable than hard disks. SSDs also require less power, which can lead to increased 
battery life for laptops and mobile devices. SSDs are more expensive and generally 
have a lower capacity than hard disks, but this is changing as 
the popularity of SSDs continues to increase. SSDs are widely 
used in tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices. Com­
puter manufacturers have developed hybrid systems that 
contain both SSDs and magnetic disks in an attempt to gain 
the speed and power benefits of SSDs while still having the 
low cost and large capacity of magnetic hard drives. Typically, 
these systems store the operating system and applications on 
the SSD drive and videos, music, documents, and folders on 
the magnetic hard drive.
Flash Memory Cards
Flash memory cards are small solid-state storage devices 
widely used in portable devices. Some of the cards are used 
within devices such as laptops, smartphones, and GPS navi­
gation systems. (See Figure 7-9.) Other cards provide remov­
able storage. For example, flash memory 
is used to store images captured from 
digital cameras and then to transfer the 
images to desktop and other computers. 
Flash memory is used in digital media 
players like the iPod to store and play 
music and video files.
USB Drives
USB drives, or flash drives, are so com­
pact that they can be transported on a 
key ring. (See Figure 7-10.) These drives 
conveniently connect directly to a com­
puter’s USB port to transfer files and 
can have capacities ranging from 1 GB 
to 256 GB, with a broad price range to 
match. Due to their convenient size and 
large capacities, USB drives have become 
a very popular option for transporting 
data and information between comput­
ers, specialty devices, and the Internet.
Did you know that traditional, 
magnetic hard-disk storage 
requires more energy than solid-
state storage? Unlike solid-state 
drives, which have no moving 
parts, hard drives have to rotate 
their magnetic disks in order to 
save or retrieve data. Fujitsu, 
which manufactures various 
storage devices, estimates that 
its high-end solid-state drives 
will consume 40 percent less 
power than comparable hard 
drives. For large data centers, 
this can result in a significant 
reduction in energy needs.
environment
Figure 7-8  Solid-state drive
Have you ever accidentally deleted or lost important files from your 
flash drive? Do you have a USB flash drive that is no longer being 
recognized by your computer? Here are a few suggestions that might help:
		
Recovery/undelete software. If you accidentally deleted files from a USB 
drive, it is unlikely that you can recover them using your operating system or 
searching through your recycle bin. Fortunately, there are several recovery (or 
undelete) programs that might help, and some are even free. For example, two 
free programs are Undelete 360 and Recuva. These programs will scan your 
flash drives for deleted files and offer you a chance to recover the ones you 
want back.
		
Testing USB ports. If your computer does not recognize your USB flash drive, 
there could be a problem with your USB port. Try plugging another device 
into that same port to see if it works. If this device does not work, then your 
computer’s USB is most likely defective and needs to be replaced. If the device 
works, then most likely your USB flash drive is damaged and you should try the 
professional recovery services discussed in the next step.
		
Professional recovery services. For damaged flash drives, there is a possibility 
that your data could be recovered by several companies that are dedicated to 
data recovery. Although the fees are high, they can rescue data from the actual 
memory chip, even if the drive or supporting circuits are damaged.

Optical Discs
Today’s optical discs can hold over 128 gigabytes of data. (See Figure 7-11.) That is the 
equivalent of millions of typewritten pages or a medium-sized library all on a single 
disc. Optical discs are very common, with most software and many movies available 
on optical disc.
In optical disc technology, a laser beam alters the sur­
face of a plastic or metallic disc to represent data. Unlike 
hard disks, which use magnetic charges to represent 1s 
and 0s, optical discs use reflected light. The 1s and 0s are 
represented by flat areas called lands and bumpy areas 
called pits on the disc surface. The disc is read by an opti­
cal disc drive using a laser that projects a tiny beam of light 
on these areas. The amount of reflected light determines 
whether the area represents a 1 or a 0.
Like hard disks, optical discs use tracks and sectors to 
organize and store files. Unlike the concentric tracks and 
wedge-shaped sectors used for hard disks, however, opti­
cal discs typically use a single track that spirals outward 
from the center of the disc. This single track is divided into 
equal-sized sectors.
The most widely used optical discs are CD, DVD, and 
Blu-ray discs.
 • Compact discs (CDs) were the first widely available 
optical format for PC users. Typically, CD drives store 
700 MB (megabytes) of storage. Optical discs that store 
music are often CDs.
 • Digital versatile discs (DVDs) are the standard optical 
discs in PCs. DVDs are very similar to CDs except that

typical DVD discs can store 4.7 GB (gigabytes)—seven times the capacity of CDs. 
Optical discs that store movies or software are often DVDs. DVD drives and CD 
drives look very similar.
 • Blu-ray discs (BDs) are the newest form of optical storage designed to store 
hi def (high definition) video, which uses the HD 720 and HD 1080 resolutions 
discussed in Chapter 6. The name Blu-ray comes from a special blue-colored laser 
used to read the discs that gives them a typical capacity of 50 GB—ten times the 
capacity of DVDs. Optical discs that store hi def video and the newest video games 
are often Blu-ray discs.
Each of these optical discs has three basic formats: read only, write once, and 
rewritable.
 • Read-only (ROM for read-only memory) discs are discs that cannot be written on 
or erased by the user. Optical discs that you buy in a store, such as music CDs, 
DVD movies, and Blu-ray video games, are often read only.
 • Write-once (R for recordable) discs can be written on once. After that, the disc can 
be read many times but cannot be written on or erased. These discs are ideal for 
creating permanent archives, such as CD-R, often used for storing family photos, 
and DVD-R, often used to store home movies.
 • Rewritable (RW for rewritable or RAM for random-access memory) discs are 
similar to write-once discs except that the disc surface is not permanently altered 
when data is recorded. These changeable, portable storage options are popular for 
storing and sharing audio, video, and large multimedia presentations.
Some optical discs, referred to as double-sided discs, contain information on both 
sides of the disc and need to be flipped over to read the other side, effectively doubling 
the storage capacity of the disk. For example, a double-sided DVD can store 9.4 GB, or 
twice as much as a single-sided DVD. Another way to add capacity to an optical disc 
is by adding multiple recording layers. These discs store information on several layers 
sandwiched together on one side of the disc. For example, some Blu-ray discs have 
multiple layers that increase storage capacity from 50 GB to 128 GB.
For a summary of the different types of optical discs, see Figure 7-12.

Cloud Storage
Recently, many applications that would have required installation on your computer 
to run have moved to the web. As we discussed in Chapter 2, this is known as cloud 
computing, where the Internet acts as a “cloud” of servers that supply applications

to clients as a service rather than a product. Additionally, these servers provide cloud 
­storage, also known as online storage.
If you have used Google Drive Docs to create a word processing document or a 
spreadsheet, you have already used cloud computing. (See Figure 7-13.) The service 
provider’s server runs the applications and your computer displays results. The appli­
cations and data can be accessed from any Internet-ready device. This means that even 
devices with little storage, memory, or processing power, such as a smartphone, can 
run the same powerful applications as a desktop computer.
The benefits to this arrangement are numerous:
 • Maintenance—The cloud service will take care of disk defragmentation, backups, 
encryption, and security.
 • Hardware upgrades—The cloud service will never run out of disk space and can 
replace failed hard disks without interruption to the user.
 • File sharing and collaboration—Users can share documents, spreadsheets, and files 
with others from anywhere with an Internet connection.
Of course, there are some disadvantages of cloud storage:
 • Access speed—The data transfer rate is dependent upon the speed of your Internet 
connection, which most likely is not as fast as a user’s internal network.
 • File security—Users are dependent upon the cloud service’s security procedures, 
which may not be as effective as your own.
There are numerous websites that provide cloud storage services. (See Figure 7-14.)

ethics
Cloud storage has created 
some interesting legal and 
ethical questions regarding 
the storage of sensitive and 
privileged information. Who 
is responsible for maintaining 
security and privacy of sensitive 
and confidential information? 
What if your attorney or doctor 
stored confidential information 
about you in the cloud and 
it somehow became widely 
distributed across the Internet? 
Clearly, you suffer any related 
consequences, but who is 
responsible? Is it your attorney, 
your doctor, the company 
providing the cloud service, 
or do you somehow have 
the responsibility to protect 
personal sensitive information?

Making IT work for you
CLOUD STORAGE
Have you ever found yourself e-mailing files back and forth between two of your computers as a way to trans­
port them? Do you keep forgetting your USB drive at school or work? Have you ever wished that you had some 
of your files readily available on your smartphone? If so, then you should sign up for Dropbox. (Please note that 
the web is continually changing, and some of the 
specifics presented below may have changed.)
Getting Started  To use Dropbox, you need to create an 
account. To take advantage of the synchronization feature, you 
will need to install the software on each of your computers.
	1	 •	 Go to www.dropbox.com, and click the 
Download Dropbox button.
	2	 •	 Select the “I don’t have a Dropbox account” 
option during the installation process (if this 
is your first installation).
	3	 •	 Enter your information to create a new 
account.
	4	 •	 Select the Free option when asked for a 
Dropbox size, and then choose the Typical 
setup.
	5	 •	 Continue clicking the Next button to view the 
important tour.
If you have a tablet or smartphone, be sure to install its free app in order to access your files.
The Dropbox Folder  After installation, a folder named “Dropbox” will be created on your hard drive and connected to your 
computer’s user account. This folder is the basis for all synchronization—any files placed here will immediately be uploaded to 
your Dropbox account and will be kept synchronized between all your computers. A good use of this folder would be to place 
all of your schoolwork and favorite photos, so that you can 
access them from any Internet-connected computer, tablet, 
or smartphone. Follow these steps to use your Dropbox 
folder:
	1	 •	 Open Windows Explorer, and look at your 
Favorites area.
	2	 •	 Click the Dropbox folder, and notice the files 
and folders already in there. Open the Photos 
subfolder.
	3	 •	 Create a subfolder in this location named 
“Practice” (this will serve as a photo gallery 
or album).
	4	 •	 Copy any photo from your computer, and 
paste it in this new folder.

183
Notice the tiny, blue synchronization icon at the bot­
tom left of your file. When this icon turns into a green 
check mark, it means that the file has finished uploading 
to the Dropbox server. The same system is used for the 
Dropbox icon in your Windows notification area.
Sharing Files  Any file or folder in your Dropbox 
account can be shared with anyone via a unique link. 
This method is superior to sending large e-mail attach­
ments that can be subject to the limits of the e-mail service. To share a file or folder:
	1	 •	 Go to your Dropbox folder using Windows Explorer.
	2	 •	 Right-click any file or folder, and click share Dropbox link. A URL link to that file or folder will be copied to 
your clipboard.
	3	 •	 Paste the link into an e-mail to share that file or folder with someone else. That individual will just follow 
the link in his or her Internet browser to get the file.
Getting More Storage Space  Dropbox’s free service includes all its features, but with a limited amount of storage space. 
You can increase that space with a paid account or by inviting friends and colleagues to join. (Dropbox increases your storage 
each time one of them signs up.)
	1	 •	 Go to www.dropbox.com/getspace and log into your account.
	2	 •	 Click the Refer friends to Dropbox and follow the instructions to invite others to use Dropbox.

Mass Storage Devices
It is natural to think of secondary storage media and devices as they relate to us as 
individuals. It may not be as obvious how important these matters are to organiza-
tions. Mass storage refers to the tremendous amount of secondary storage required 
by large organizations. Mass storage devices are specialized high-capacity secondary 
storage devices designed to meet organizational demands for data storage. These mass 
storage solutions allow large corporations and institutions to centralize their mainte-
nance and security of data, thereby reducing costs and personnel.
Enterprise Storage System
Most large organizations have established a strategy called an enterprise storage ­system 
to promote efficient and safe use of data across the networks within their organiza-
tions. (See Figure 7-15.) Some of the mass storage devices that support this strategy are:

Secondary Storage	 185
 • File servers—dedicated computers with very large storage capacities that provide 
users access to fast storage and retrieval of data.
 • Network attached storage (NAS)—a type of file server designed for homes and 
small businesses. NAS is less expensive, easier to set up, and easier to manage 
than most file servers. However, it does not include powerful management tools 
and features found in many large-scale file servers.
 • RAID systems—larger versions of the specialized devices discussed earlier in this 
chapter that enhance organizational security by constantly making backup copies 
of files moving across the organization’s networks.
 • Organizational cloud storage—high-speed Internet connection to a dedicated 
remote storage facility. These facilities contain banks of file servers to offer enor­
mous amounts of storage.
Storage Area Network
A recent mass storage development is storage area network (SAN) systems. SAN is 
an architecture to link remote computer storage devices, such as enterprise storage 
systems, to computers such that the devices are as available as locally attached drives. 
In a SAN system, the user’s computer provides the file system for storing data, but the 
SAN provides the disk space for data.
The key to a SAN is a high-speed network, connecting individual computers to 
mass storage devices. Special file systems prevent simultaneous users from interfering 
with each other. SANs provide the ability to house data in remote locations and still 
allow efficient and secure access.

Careers in IT
Disaster recovery specialists are responsible for recovering systems and 
data after a disaster strikes an organization. In addition, they often cre­
ate plans to prevent and prepare for such disasters. A crucial part of 
that plan is to use storage devices and media in order to ensure that all 
company data is backed up and, in some cases, stored off-site.
Employers typically look for candidates with a bachelor’s or associ­
ate’s degree in information systems or computer science. Experience 
in this field is usually required, and additional skills in the areas of net­
working, security, and database administration are desirable. Disaster 
recovery specialists should possess good communication skills and be 
able to handle high-stress situations.
Disaster recovery specialists can expect to earn an annual salary of 
$70,000 to $88,000. Opportunities for advancement typically include 
upper-management positions. With so many types of threats facing 
organizations, demand for these types of specialists is expected to grow.
Now that you’ve learned about secondary 
storage, let me tell you a little bit about my 
career as a disaster recovery specialist.

achieved higher limits by adding more layers, a ceiling will soon 
be hit. GE Global Research is currently developing a disc made 
up of tiny holograms, stored over dozens of layers, that react 
to light. These discs will store 1 TB of data, and the drives that 
read them will also be able to read your DVD and Blu-ray discs.
Advancements in chemistry have led to the speculation 
that circuits and storage media could soon be working with 
­carbon-containing molecules. Researchers have discovered 
that a group of compounds known as metallofullerenes can 
be oriented in various ways, allow­
ing them to represent 0 and 1 bits 
just as other storage media cur­
rently do. The biggest advantage 
with organic molecules involves 
size. These molecules are so small 
that storage devices created with 
them could be extremely tiny, allow­
ing the creation of much smaller 
computers and gadgets.
You may be wondering why 
solid-state storage, or flash mem­
ory, has not yet been mentioned. 
This type of media has definitely 
been improving over the years. 
Your flash drives and memory 
cards keep getting smaller and 
capacities keep going up. However, 
the price per gigabyte is still much 
higher than that of hard drives. In 
the past, they have a limited life 
span because they can support 
only approximately 10,000 write operations. These two 
issues may not be a problem for individuals, but they make 
it impossible for large businesses and cloud storage compa­
nies to rely on them. However, recent innovations in the way 
solid-state storage writes information has shown dramatic 
improvements and SSD stability concerns are likely to be a 
thing of the past.
Now that several types of future technologies have been 
explored, which do you see yourself using in five years? Do 
you believe that solid-state storage will completely replace 
the hard drive in desktop and laptop computers? Do you think 
that molecule-sized storage solutions will ever be affordable 
enough to be used in all computers?
Next-Generation Storage
Have you already started to use a cloud storage service for 
your files? Have your friends and family members used one 
also? With millions of individuals and businesses all signing 
up for these services, how do these companies keep up with 
the amount of storage required to accommodate all these 
users? The answer is simple: They keep adding more hard 
drives. Although hard drives have been around a long time, the 
technology underlying these tools is undergoing incredible 
improvements. Recently, terabyte 
hard drives have become common­
place, using existing magnetic stor­
age methods. In the future, your 
movies and photos may be stored 
using heat, organic compounds, or 
even holograms. Technology has 
been making better storage, and 
will continue to evolve to improve 
our lives as we look to the future.
The first product that will 
receive a huge improvement is 
the hard drive. When it comes to 
the primary storage of your com­
puter and the millions of servers 
throughout the world, nothing 
beats hard drives. They are the 
most affordable solution when it 
comes to the price per gigabyte. 
Therefore, researchers are look­
ing at ways of increasing their 
capacity without increasing their size. Current hard drive 
technology will max out at approximately 128 GB per square 
inch. Seagate, a manufacturer of hard drives, is working 
on two new technologies that hope to increase that limit: 
heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) and bit-patterned 
media (BPM). The idea is to keep making the bits smaller so 
that more of them fit in the same area. Once these technolo­
gies are implemented, the capacity could reach 6.25 TB (or 
6,250 GB) per square inch. With a density like that, Seagate 
estimates that you could hold the entire contents of the U.S. 
Library of Congress on a disk that is no bigger than a coin.
The latest optical disc, Blu-ray, is commercially available 
as 25- or 50-GB discs. Although several companies have 
A LOOK TO THE FUTURE

HARD DISKS
STORAGE
Secondary Storage
VISUAL SUMMARY
RAM is primary storage. Most RAM is volatile, meaning 
that it loses its contents whenever power is disrupted. 
Secondary storage provides nonvolatile storage. Second­
ary storage retains data and information after the com­
puter system is turned off.
Writing is the process of saving information to second­
ary storage devices. Reading is the process of accessing 
information.
Important characteristics include
 • Media—actual physical material that retains data and 
programs.
 • Capacity—how much a particular storage medium can 
hold.
 • Storage devices—hardware that reads and writes to 
storage media.
 • Access speed—time required to retrieve data from a 
secondary storage device.
Hard disks use rigid metallic platters that provide a large 
amount of capacity. They store data and programs by 
altering the electromagnetic charges on the platter’s sur­
face. Files are organized according to
 • Tracks—concentric rings on the platter.
 • Sectors—wedge-shaped sections.
 • Cylinders—run through each track of a stack of 
platters.
Density refers to how tightly electromagnetic charges 
can be packed next to one another on the disk.
A head crash occurs when the hard disk makes contact 
with the drive’s read-write heads.
Two types are internal and external hard disks.

188	 chapter 7
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be aware of the different types of secondary storage. You need 
to know their capabilities, limitations, and uses. There are four widely used storage media: hard disk, solid state, opti­
cal disc, and cloud storage.
HARD DISKS
External Hard Drives
Unlike internal hard disks, external hard drives are 
removable. External drives use the same basic technology 
as internal disks.
Performance Enhancements
Three ways to improve hard-disk performance are disk cach­
ing, RAID, and file compression and decompression.
 • Disk caching—provides a temporary high-speed hold­
ing area between a secondary storage device and the 
CPU; improves performance by anticipating data 
needs and reducing time to access data from second­
ary storage.
 • RAID (redundant array of inexpensive disks)—several 
inexpensive hard-disk drives are connected together; 
improves performance by providing expanded storage, 
fast access, and high reliability.
 • File compression and decompression—files are com­
pressed before storing and then decompressed before 
being used again; improves performance through effi­
cient storage.
SOLID-STATE STORAGE
Solid-state storage devices have no moving parts; provide 
access to flash memory (solid-state storage).
Solid-State Drives
Solid-state drives (SSDs) are similar to internal hard-disk 
drives except they use solid-state memory; are faster, more 
durable, and more expensive; and generally provide less 
capacity. Hybrid systems contain SSD and magnetic disks.
Flash Memory Cards
Flash memory cards are small solid-state storage devices 
that are widely used with portable devices. They are used 
with a variety of specialized input devices including digital 
cameras to store and transfer images and digital media play­
ers like the iPod to store and transfer music and video files.
USB Drives
USB drives (flash drives) are so small that they fit onto 
a key ring. These drives connect to a computer’s USB 
port and are widely used to transfer data and information 
between computers, specialty devices, and the Internet.

	
Secondary Storage	 189
OPTICAL DISCS
Optical discs use laser technology. 1s and 0s are repre­
sented by pits and lands. Optical disc drives project light 
and measure the reflected light.
The most widely used optical discs are:
 • Compact discs (CDs) were the first; typical storage 
700 MB; often used to store music.
 • Digital versatile discs (DVDs); standard optical discs; 
typical storage 4.7 GB; often used to store movies and 
software.
 • Blu-ray discs (BDs) are the newest; designed to 
store hi def (high definition) video; typical storage 
50 GB; often used to store hi def video and video 
games.
Each of these optical discs has three basic formats:
 • Read-only (ROM for read-only memory) discs cannot 
be written on or erased by the user.
 • Write-once (R for recordable) discs can be written on 
once. After that, they can be read many times but can­
not be written on or erased.
 • Rewritable (RW for rewritable or RAM for random- 
access memory) discs are similar to write-once discs 
except that the disc surface is not permanently altered 
when data is recorded.
CLOUD STORAGE
With cloud computing, the Internet acts as a “cloud” of 
servers. Cloud storage (online storage) is supplied by 
these servers.
 • Cloud servers provide storage, processing, and 
memory.
 • Advantages for users include less maintenance, 
fewer hardware upgrades, and easy file sharing and 
collaboration.
 • Disadvantages for users include slower access speed 
and less control over file security.
MASS STORAGE DEVICES
Mass storage refers to the tremendous amount of secondary 
storage required by large organizations. Mass storage devices 
are specialized high-capacity secondary storage devices.
Most large organizations have established a strategy 
called an enterprise storage system to promote efficient 
and safe use of data.
Mass storage devices that support this strategy are file 
servers, network attached storage (NAS), RAID systems, 
and organizational cloud storage. A storage area network 
(SAN) is a method of using enterprise-level remote stor­
age systems as if they were local to your computer.
CAREERS in IT
Disaster recovery specialists are responsible for recover­
ing systems and data after a disaster strikes an organi­
zation. Bachelor’s or associate’s degree in information 
systems or computer science, experience, and additional 
skills in the areas of networking, security, and database 
administration are desirable. Salary range is $70,000 
to $88,000.

Communications
Computer communications is the process of sharing data, programs, and informa­
tion between two or more computers. We have discussed numerous applications that 
depend on communication systems, including
 • E-mail—provides a fast, efficient alternative to traditional mail by sending and 
receiving electronic documents.
 • Texting—provides very efficient direct text communication between individuals 
using short electronic messages.
 • Videoconferencing—provides a very-low-cost alternative to long-distance tele­
phone calls using electronic voice and video delivery.
 • Electronic commerce—buying and selling goods electronically.
In this chapter, we will focus on the communication systems that support these and 
many other applications. Connectivity, the wireless revolution, and communication 
systems are key concepts and technologies for the 21st century.
Connectivity
Connectivity is a concept related to using computer networks to link people and 
resources. For example, connectivity means that you can connect your personal com­
puter to other computers and information sources almost anywhere. With this connec­
tion, you are linked to the world of larger computers and the Internet. This includes 
hundreds of thousands of web servers and their extensive information resources. Thus, 
being able to efficiently and effectively use computers becomes a matter of knowing 
not only about connectivity through networks to personal computers but also about 
larger computer systems and their information resources.
Introduction
We live in a truly connected society. We can communicate almost instan­
taneously with others worldwide; changing events from the smallest of 
countries and places are immediately broadcast to the world; our e-mail 
messages are delivered to handheld devices; cars access the Internet to 
receive driving instructions and solve mechanical problems. Even house­
hold appliances can connect to the Internet and be remotely controlled. 
The communications and information options we have at our fingertips 
have changed how we react and relate to the world around us.
As the power and flexibility of our communication systems have 
expanded, the sophistication of the networks that support these systems 
has become increasingly critical and complex. The network technologies 
that handle our cellular, business, and Internet communications come in 
many different forms. Satellites, broadcast towers, telephone lines, even 
buried cables and fiber optics carry our telephone messages, e-mail, and 
text messages. These different networks must be able to efficiently and 
effectively integrate with one another.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the 
concept of connectivity, wireless networking, and the elements that make up 
network and communications systems. Additionally, you need to understand 
the basics of communications channels, connection devices, data transmis­
sion, network types, network architectures, and organizational networks.
Hi, I’m Michael, and I’m a network administra­
tor. I’d like to talk with you about computer 
communications and networks. I’d also like to 
talk about technologies that support mobile 
computing including global positioning sys­
tems, Wi-Fi, and 3G and 4G networks.

The Wireless Revolution
The single most dramatic change in con­
nectivity and communications in the past 
decade has been the widespread use of 
mobile devices like smartphones and tablets 
with wireless Internet connectivity. Students, 
parents, teachers, businesspeople, and oth­
ers routinely talk and communicate with 
these devices. It is estimated that over 1.5 bil­
lion smartphones are in use worldwide. This 
wireless technology allows individuals to stay 
connected with one another from almost 
anywhere at any time.
So what’s the revolution? While wireless 
technology was originally used primarily for 
voice communications, today’s mobile com­
puters support e-mail, web access, social 
networking, and a variety of Internet appli­
cations. In addition, wireless technology allows a wide variety of nearby devices to 
communicate with one another without any physical connection. Wireless commu­
nications allows you to share a high-speed printer, share data files, and collaborate 
on working documents with a nearby co-worker without having your computers con­
nected by cables or telephone. High-speed Internet wireless technology allows indi­
viduals to connect to the Internet and share information from almost anywhere in the 
world. (See Figure 8-1.) But is it a revolution? Most experts say yes and that the revolu­
tion is just beginning.
Communication Systems
Communication systems are electronic systems that transmit data from one location 
to another. Whether wired or wireless, every communication system has four basic 
elements. (See Figure 8-2.)
 • Sending and receiving devices. These are often a computer or specialized commu­
nication device. They originate (send) as well as accept (receive) messages in the 
form of data, information, and/or instructions.
 • Connection devices. These devices act as an interface between the sending and 
receiving devices and the communication channel. They convert outgoing mes­
sages into packets that can travel across the communication channel. They also 
reverse the process for incoming messages.

 • Data transmission specifications. These are rules and procedures that coordinate 
the sending and receiving devices by precisely defining how the message will be 
sent across the communication channel.
 • Communication channel. This is the actual connecting or transmission medium 
that carries the message. This medium can be a physical wire or cable, or it can be 
wireless.
For example, if you wanted to send an e-mail to a friend, you could create and 
send the message using your computer, the sending device. Your modem, a connection 
device, would modify and format the message so that it could travel efficiently across 
­communication channels, such as telephone lines. The specifics describing how the mes­
sage is modified, reformatted, and sent would be described in the data transmission 
specifications. After your message traveled across the channel, the receiver’s modem, 
a connection device, would reformat it so that it could be displayed on your friend’s 
computer, the receiving device. (Note: This example presents the basic communication 
system elements involved in sending e-mail. It does not and is not intended to dem­
onstrate all the specific steps and equipment involved in an e-mail delivery system.)
ethics
As eavesdropping tools become 
more sophisticated, there is 
concern that law enforcement 
and government agencies will 
monitor everyone’s Internet 
and cell phone activity. In the 
private sector, companies are 
increasingly using network 
tools and software to monitor 
the activity of their employees. 
Many websites also track 
your activity, and government 
officials have often requested 
these records during the 
course of an investigation. 
Some believe that it is unethical 
for government and businesses 
to engage in such monitoring 
and tracking. Do you agree?
concept check
Define computer communications and connectivity.
What is the wireless revolution?
Describe the four elements of every communication system.
Communication Channels
Communication channels are an essential element of every communication system. 
These channels actually carry the data from one computer to another. There are two 
categories of communication channels. One category connects sending and receiving 
devices by providing a physical connection, such as a wire or cable. The other category 
is wireless.
Physical Connections
Physical connections use a solid medium to connect sending and receiving devices. 
These connections include twisted-pair, coaxial, and fiber-optic cables.
 • Twisted-pair cable consists of pairs of copper wire that are twisted together. Both 
standard telephone lines and Ethernet cables use twisted pair. (See Figure 8-3.) 
Ethernet cables are often used in networks and to connect a variety of compo­
nents to the system unit.
 • Coaxial cable, a high-frequency transmission cable, replaces the multiple wires of 
telephone lines with a single solid-copper core. (See Figure 8-4.) In terms of the 
number of telephone connections, a coaxial cable has over 80 times the transmis­
sion capacity of twisted pair. Coaxial cable is used to deliver television signals as 
well as to connect computers in a network.
 • Fiber-optic cable transmits data as pulses of light through tiny tubes of glass. 
(See Figure 8-5.) The data transmission speeds of fiber-optic cables are incred­
ible; recently speeds of 1 petabit per second were measured (a petabit is 1 mil­
lion gigabits). Compared to coaxial cable, it is lighter, faster, and more reliable at 
transmitting data. Fiber-optic cable is rapidly replacing twisted-pair cable tele­
phone lines.

Figure 8-6  Wi-Fi standards
Wireless Connections
Wireless connections do not use a solid substance to connect sending and receiving 
devices. Rather, they move data through the air.
Most wireless connections use radio waves to communicate. For example, 
smartphones and many other Internet-enabled devices use radio waves to place 
telephone calls and to connect to the Internet. Primary technologies used for wire­
less connections are Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, microwave, WiMax, cellular, and satellite 
connections.
 • Bluetooth is a short-range radio communication standard that transmits data over 
short distances of up to approximately 33 feet. Bluetooth is widely used for wire­
less headsets, printer connections, and handheld devices.
 • Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) uses high-frequency radio signals to transmit data. A 
number of standards for Wi-Fi exist, and each can send and receive data at a dif­
ferent speed. (See Figure 8-6.) Most home and business wireless networks use 
Wi-Fi.
 • Microwave communication uses high-frequency radio waves. It is sometimes 
referred to as line-of-sight communication because microwaves can only 
travel in a straight line. Because the waves cannot bend with the curvature of 
the earth, they can be transmitted only over relatively short distances. Thus, 
microwave is a good medium for sending data between buildings in a city or 
on a large college campus. For longer distances, the waves must be relayed 
by means of microwave stations with microwave dishes or antennas. (See 
Figure 8-7.)
 • WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a new standard that 
extends the range of Wi-Fi networks using microwave connections. WiMax is com­
monly used by universities and others to extend the capability of existing Wi-Fi 
networks.
 • Cellular communication uses multiple antennae (cell towers) to send and receive 
data within relatively small geographic regions (cells). Most cell 
phones and mobile devices use cellular networks.
 • Satellite communication uses satellites orbiting about 
22,000 miles above the earth as microwave relay stations. 
Many of these are offered by Intelsat, the International Tele­
communications Satellite Consortium, which is owned by 
114 governments and forms a worldwide communication 
system. Satellites orbit at a precise point and speed above the 
earth. They can amplify and relay microwave signals from one 
transmitter on the ground to another. Satellites can be used to 
send and receive large volumes of data. Uplink is a term relat­
ing to sending data to a satellite. Downlink refers to receiving 
data from a satellite. The major drawback to satellite commu­
nication is that bad weather can sometimes interrupt the flow 
of data.
One of the most interesting applications of satellite com­
munications is for global positioning. A network of satellites 
owned and managed by the Department of Defense continu­
ously sends location information to earth. Global positioning 
system (GPS) devices use that information to uniquely deter­
mine the geographic location of the device. Available in many 
automobiles to provide navigational support, these systems are 
often mounted into the dash with a monitor to display maps 
and speakers to provide spoken directions. Most of today’s 
smartphones and tablets use GPS technology for handheld 
navigation. (See Figure 8-8.)

Unlike radio waves, infrared uses infrared light waves to communicate over short 
distances. Like microwave transmissions, infrared is a line-of-sight communication. 
Because light waves can only travel in a straight line, sending and receiving devices 
must be in clear view of one another without any obstructions blocking that view. One 
of the most common infrared devices is the TV remote control.
Connection Devices
At one time nearly all computer communication used telephone lines. However, because 
the telephone was originally designed for voice transmission, telephones typically send 
and receive ­analog signals, which are continuous electronic waves. Computers, in con­
trast, send and receive digital signals. (See Figure 8-9.) These represent the presence or 
absence of an electronic pulse—the on/off binary signals we mentioned in Chapter 5. To 
convert the digital signals to analog signals and vice versa, you need a modem.
Modems
The word modem is short for modulator-demodulator. Modulation is the name of the 
process of converting from digital to analog. Demodulation is the process of convert­
ing from analog to digital. The modem enables digital personal computers to commu­
nicate across different media, including telephone wires, cable lines, and radio waves.
The speed with which modems transmit data varies. This speed, called transfer rate, 
is typically measured in millions of bits (megabits) per second (Mbps). (See ­Figure 8-10.) 
The higher the speed, the faster you can send and receive information. For example, to 
download a complete full-length motion picture (700 MB) on a 1.5-Mbps modem would 
take about 1 hour. Using a 10.0-Mbps modem would take about 9 minutes.
There are three commonly used types of modems: DSL, cable, and wireless. (See 
Figure 8-11.)
 • A DSL (digital subscriber line) modem uses standard phone lines to create a 
high-speed connection directly to your phone company’s offices. These devices 
are usually external and connect to the system unit using either a USB or an 
­Ethernet port.
 • A cable modem uses the same coaxial cable as your television. Like a DSL 
modem, a cable modem creates high-speed connections using the system unit’s 
USB or Ethernet port.
 • A wireless modem is also known as a WWAN (wireless wide area network) modem. 
Almost all computers today have built-in wireless modems. For those that do not, 
wireless adapter cards are available that plug into USB or ­special card ports.
Connection Service
For years, large corporations have been leasing special high-speed lines from tele­
phone companies. Originally, these were copper lines, known as T1 lines, that could 
be combined to form higher-capacity options known as T3 or DS3 lines. These lines 
have largely been replaced by faster optical carrier (OC) lines.
While the special high-speed lines are too costly for most individuals, Internet 
service providers (as discussed in Chapter 2) do provide affordable connections.

Did you know that GPS 
technology might help protect 
the environment? Many cars 
and mobile devices now have 
GPS capabilities, and these 
tools can help save fuel by 
providing drivers with the 
shortest route to a destination. 
Most devices now provide 
real-time traffic avoidance 
data, which will reduce the 
carbon emissions and pollution 
of cars stuck in traffic. By 
finding the best routes and 
avoiding congested areas, 
you can maximize your fuel 
efficiency and help protect the

Communications and Networks 	 201
For years, individuals relied on dial-up services using existing telephones and tele­
phone modems to connect to the Internet. This type of service has been replaced 
by higher-speed connection services including DSL, cable, satellite, and cellular 
services.
 • Digital subscriber line (DSL) service is provided by telephone companies using 
existing telephone lines to provide high-speed connections. ADSL (asymmetric 
digital subscriber line) is one of the most widely used types of DSL. DSL is much 
faster than dial-up.
 • Cable service is provided by cable television companies using their existing televi­
sion cables. These connections are usually faster than DSL.
 • Fiber-optic service (FiOS) is showing up in some areas, but it is a new technology 
and not widely available. Current providers of FiOS include Google and Verizon 
with speeds faster than cable or DSL connections.
 • Satellite connection services use satellites to provide wireless connections. While 
slower than DSL and cable modem, satellite connections are available almost any­
where using a satellite-receiving disk.
 • Cellular service providers, including Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile, sup­
port voice and data transmission to wireless devices using cellular networks. 
These networks have gone through different generations. First-generation 
mobile telecommunications (1G) started in the 1980s using analog radio sig­
nals to provide analog voice transmission service. Second-generation mobile 
telecommunications (2G) started in the 1990s using digital radio signals. Third-
generation mobile telecommunications (3G) started in the 2000s and provided 
services capable of effective connectivity to the Internet, marking the beginning 
of smartphones.
Fourth-generation mobile telecommunications (4G) has begun to replace 
3G networks in some areas with providers using LTE (Long Term Evolution)

connections to provide faster transmission speeds. While a user’s experience 
with 4G will depend on several factors, including carrier, geography, and prox­
imity to cell towers, 4G technologies can provide speeds up to 10 times faster 
than 3G.

Data Transmission
Several factors affect how data is transmitted. These factors include bandwidth and 
protocols.
Bandwidth
Bandwidth is a measurement of the width or capacity of the communication chan­
nel. Effectively, it means how much information can move across the communication 
channel in a given amount of time. For example, to transmit text documents, a slow 
bandwidth would be acceptable. However, to effectively transmit video and audio, a 
wider bandwidth is required. There are four categories of bandwidth.
 • Voiceband, also known as low bandwidth, is used for standard telephone com­
munication. Personal computers with telephone modems and dial-up service use 
this bandwidth. While effective for transmitting text documents, it is too slow for 
many types of transmission, including high-quality audio and video.
 • Medium band is used in special leased lines to connect midrange computers and 
mainframes as well as to transmit data over long distances. This bandwidth is 
capable of very-high-speed data transfer.
 • Broadband is widely used for DSL, cable, and satellite connections to the Internet. 
Several users can simultaneously use a single broadband connection for high-
speed data transfer.
 • Baseband is widely used to connect individual computers that are located close to 
one another. Like broadband, it is able to support high-speed transmission. Unlike 
broadband, however, baseband can only carry a single signal at a time.
Protocols
For data transmission to be successful, sending and receiving devices must follow a set 
of communication rules for the exchange of information. These rules for exchanging 
data between computers are known as protocols.
As discussed in Chapter 2, https, or hypertext transfer protocol secure,  is widely 
used to protect the transfer of sensitive information. Another widely used Internet 
protocol is TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet protocol). The essen­
tial features of this protocol involve (1) identifying sending and receiving devices

Making IT work for you
MOBILE INTERNET
Is your smartphone or tablet always connected to the Internet? Millions have this always-on connection to 
access their e-mail, favorite websites, cloud services, and apps from anywhere at any time. What can be 
confusing to many is the variety of connection devices, data plans, and penalties for exceeding usage limits.
Devices  There are many devices that can help you get Internet access from wherever you are.
	 1	 •	 Smartphones. Most modern smartphones are capable of 
accessing the Internet via Wi-Fi and 3G or 4G networks.
	2	 •	 Tablets. Most tablets will provide Wi-Fi access, but to get 
3G or 4G capabilities, you will generally have to purchase a 
higher-priced model.
	3	 •	 Laptops. By inserting a USB modem, almost all laptops can 
access the Internet through a 3G or 4G network.
	4	 •	 Mobile hotspot device. This is a stand-alone device that 
connects to a 3G or 4G network. It will then allow multiple 
devices near it to access the Internet via a Wi-Fi connection.
Many smartphones can provide Wi-Fi sharing, or tethering, like a mobile 
hotspot device. However, you may have to pay an additional monthly fee.
Data Plans  A data plan defines how much data you can download using your 
3G or 4G connection. These plans can be very confusing, but for most indi-
viduals, the plan that gives you a few gigabytes per month is best. Although a 
few providers have unlimited data plans, they may slow down, or throttle, your 
connection speed significantly if they deem that your usage is excessive.
Overage Charges  If you exceed the monthly data limit, wireless providers will 
start charging overage fees. For example, one provider charges $10 for every 
extra gigabyte used. To minimize overage charges, consider the following:
	 1	 •	 Wi-Fi access points. Whenever possible, use a Wi-Fi 
connection. These connections are not subject to your data plan 
limits. So if you are in a coffee shop that offers free Wi-Fi, use it!
	2	 •	 Streaming music/video. Streaming too much of any media 
can quickly become a problem. The solution: Be selective 
when watching TV shows, movies, and YouTube videos, and 
try to store some of your music on your device.
	3	 •	 Downloading. Limit your downloading of new apps and music to Wi-Fi connections only. Many programs 
and MP3 files can reach (or even exceed) a size of 10 MB.
	4	 •	 Monitor your data usage. Most wireless companies provide a free app that helps you monitor your minutes, 
text messages, and data. Keep an eye on this.

and (2) breaking information into small parts, or packets, for transmission across 
the Internet.
 • Identification: Every computer on the Internet has a unique numeric address 
called an IP address (Internet protocol address). Similar to the way a postal ser­
vice uses addresses to deliver mail, the Internet uses IP addresses to deliver e-mail 
and to locate websites. Because these numeric addresses are difficult for people to 
remember and use, a system was developed to automatically convert text-based 
addresses to numeric IP addresses. This system uses a domain name server (DNS) 
that converts text-based addresses to IP addresses. For example, whenever you 
enter a URL, say www.mhhe.com, a DNS converts this to an IP address before a 
connection can be made. (See Figure 8-12.)
 • Packetization: Information sent or transmitted across the Internet usually travels 
through numerous interconnected networks. Before the message is sent, it is refor­
matted or broken down into small parts called packets. Each packet is then sent 
separately over the Internet, possibly traveling different routes to one common des­
tination. At the receiving end, the packets are reassembled into the correct order.

Networks
A computer network is a communication system that connects two or more computers 
so that they can exchange information and share resources. Networks can be set up in 
different arrangements to suit users’ needs. (See Figure 8-13.)
Terms
There are a number of specialized terms that describe computer networks. These 
terms include
 • Node—any device that is connected to a network. It could be a computer, printer, 
or data storage device.

 • Client—a node that requests and uses resources available from other nodes. Typi­
cally, a client is a user’s personal computer.
 • Server—a node that shares resources with other nodes. Dedicated servers special­
ize in performing specific tasks. Depending on the specific task, they may be 
called an application server, communication server, database server, file server, 
printer server, or web server.
 • Directory server—a specialized server that manages resources, such as user 
accounts, for an entire network.
 • Host—any computer system connected to a network that provides access to its 
resources.
 • Router—a node that forwards or routes data packets from one network to their 
destination in another network.
 • Switch—central node that coordinates the flow of data by sending messages directly 
between sender and receiver nodes. A hub previously filled this purpose by send­
ing a received message to all connected nodes, rather than just the intended node.
 • Network interface cards (NIC)—as discussed in Chapter 5, these are expansion 
cards located within the system unit that connect the computer to a network. 
Sometimes referred to as a LAN adapter.

206	 chapter 8
 • Network operating systems (NOS)—control and coordinate the activities of all 
computers and other devices on a network. These activities include electronic 
communication and the sharing of information and resources.
 • Network administrator—a computer specialist responsible for efficient network 
operations and implementation of new networks.
A network may consist only of personal computers, or it may integrate personal 
computers or other devices with larger computers. Networks can be controlled by all 
nodes working together equally or by specialized nodes coordinating and supplying 
all resources. Networks may be simple or complex, self-contained or dispersed over a 
large geographic area.

Network Types
Clearly, different types of channels—wired or wireless—allow different kinds of net­
works to be formed. Telephone lines, for instance, may connect communications 
equipment within the same building or within a home. Networks also may be citywide 
and even international, using both cable and wireless connections. Local area, metro­
politan area, and wide area networks are distinguished by the size of the geographic 
area they serve.
Local Area Networks
Networks with nodes that are in close physical proximity—within the same building, 
for instance—are called local area networks (LANs). Typically, LANs span distances 
less than a mile and are owned and operated by individual organizations. LANs are 
widely used by colleges, universities, and other types of organizations to link per­
sonal computers and to share printers and other resources. For a simple LAN, see 
Figure 8-14.
The LAN represented in Figure 8-14 is a typical arrangement and provides two 
benefits: economy and flexibility. People can share costly equipment. For instance, the 
four personal computers share the high-speed laser printer and the file server, which 
are expensive pieces of hardware. Other equipment or nodes also may be added to the 
LAN—for instance, more personal computers, a mainframe computer, or optical disc 
storage devices. Additionally, the network gateway is a device that allows one LAN 
to be linked to other LANs or to larger networks. For example, the LAN of one office 
group may be connected to the LAN of another office group.
There are a variety of different standards or ways in which nodes can be connected 
to one another and ways in which their communications are controlled in a LAN. The 
most common standard is known as Ethernet. LANs using this standard are some­
times referred to as Ethernet LANs.
Home Networks
While LANs have been widely used within organizations for years, they are now being 
commonly used by individuals in their homes and apartments. These LANs, called

home networks, allow different computers to share resources, 
including a common Internet connection. Computers can be 
connected in a variety of ways, including electrical wiring, 
telephone wiring, and special cables. One of the simplest 
ways, however, is without cables, or wireless.
Wireless LAN
A wireless local area network is typically referred to as a wireless LAN (WLAN). 
It uses radio frequencies to connect computers and other devices. All communi­
cations pass through the network’s centrally located wireless access point or base 
station. This access point interprets incoming radio frequencies and routes commu­
nications to the appropriate devices.
Wireless access points that provide Internet access are widely available in public 
places such as coffee shops, libraries, bookstores, colleges, and universities. These 
access points are known as hotspots and typically use Wi-Fi technology. Many of 
these services are free and easy to find using free locator sites such as www.hotspot-­
locations.com. Most mobile computing devices have an internal wireless network card 
to connect to hotspots. If your mobile device does not have an internal wireless net­
work card, you can use an external wireless adapter (see Figure 8-15) that plugs into 
your computer’s USB port or PC card slot.
Personal Area Network
A personal area network (PAN) is a type of wireless network that works within a very 
small area—your immediate surroundings. PANs connect cell phones to headsets, key­
boards to cell phones, and so on. These networks make it possible for wireless devices 
to interact with each other. The most popular PAN technology is Bluetooth, with a 
maximum range of around 33 feet. Virtually all wireless peripheral devices available 
today use Bluetooth, including the controllers on popular game systems like the Play­
Station and Wii.

PAN
Personal area network; connects digital devices, such as PDAs

Metropolitan Area Networks
Metropolitan area networks (MAN) span dis­
tances up to 100 miles. These networks are fre­
quently used as links between office buildings 
that are located throughout a city.
Unlike a LAN, a MAN is typically not owned 
by a single organization. Rather, it is owned 
either by a group of organizations or by a single 
network service provider that provides network 
services for a fee.
Wide Area Networks
Wide area networks (WANs) are countrywide 
and worldwide networks. These networks pro­
vide access to regional service (MAN) provid­
ers and typically span distances greater than 
100 miles. They use microwave relays and sat­
ellites to reach users over long distances—for 
example, from Los Angeles to Paris. Of course, 
the widest of all WANs is the Internet, which 
spans the entire globe.
The primary difference between a PAN, LAN, MAN, and WAN is the geographic 
range. Each may have various combinations of hardware, such as personal computers, 
midrange computers, mainframes, and various peripheral devices.
For a summary of network types, see Figure 8-16.
Do you use your laptop to connect to wireless networks at 
school or in public places such as coffee shops, airports, 
or hotels? If so, it is important to use caution to protect your computer 
and your privacy. Here are a few suggestions:
		
Use a firewall. A personal firewall is essential when connecting your 
computer directly to public networks. Some firewalls, such as the one 
built into Windows 8 and Windows 10, will ask whether a new network 
should be treated as home, work, or a public network.
		
Avoid fake hotspots. Thieves are known to set up rogue (or fake) 
hotspots in popular areas where users expect free Wi-Fi, such 
as coffee shops and airports. Since many operating systems 
automatically connect to the access point with the strongest signal, 
you could be connecting to the one set up by the thief. Always confirm 
that you are connecting to the access point of that establishment. Ask 
an employee if you are unsure.
		
Turn off file sharing. Turning off file-sharing features in your operating 
system will ensure that no one can access or modify your files.
		
Check if connection is encrypted. If the hotspot you are using is 
protected with a password, then it is likely encrypted. If it is not, then 
be very careful with websites you visit and the information you provide.

Network Architecture
Network architecture describes how a network is arranged and how resources are 
coordinated and shared. It encompasses a variety of different network specifics, 
including network topologies and strategies. Network topology describes the physi­
cal arrangement of the network. Network strategies define how information and 
resources are shared.

Communications and Networks 	 209
Topologies
A network can be arranged or configured in several dif­
ferent ways. This arrangement is called the network’s 
topology. The most common topologies are
 • Bus network—each device is connected to a common 
cable called a bus or ­backbone, and all communications 
travel along this bus.
 • Ring network—each device is connected to two other 
devices, forming a ring. (See Figure 8-17.) When a mes­
sage is sent, it is passed around the ring until it reaches 
the intended destination.
 • Star network—each device is connected directly to a 
central network switch. (See Figure 8-18.) Whenever a 
node sends a message, it is routed to the switch, which 
then passes the message along to the intended recipi­
ent. The star network is the most widely used network 
topology today. It is applied to a broad range of applica­
tions from small networks in the home to very large net­
works in major corporations.
 • Tree network—each device is connected to a central 
node, either directly or through one or more other 
devices. The central node is connected to two or more 
subordinate nodes that in turn are connected to other 
subordinate nodes, and so forth, forming a treelike 
structure. (See Figure 8-19.) This network, also known 
as a hierarchical network, is often used to share cor­
poratewide data.
 • Mesh network—this topology is the newest type 
and does not use a specific physical layout (such as 
a star or a tree). Rather, the mesh network requires 
that each node have more than one connection to 
the other nodes. (See Figure 8-20.) The resulting 
pattern forms the appearance of a mesh. If a path 
between two nodes is somehow disrupted, data can be

automatically rerouted around the failure using another 
path. Wireless technologies are frequently used to build 
mesh networks.
Strategies
Every network has a strategy, or way of coordinating 
the sharing of information and resources. Two of the 
most common network strategies are client/server and 
peer-to-peer.
Client/server networks use central servers to coordi­
nate and supply services to other nodes on the network. 
The server provides access to resources such as web pages, 
databases, application software, and hardware. (See Fig­
ure 8-21.) This strategy is based on specialization. Server 
nodes coordinate and supply specialized services, and client 
nodes request the services. Commonly used server operating systems are Windows 
Server, Mac OS X Server, Linux, and Solaris.
Client/server networks are widely used on the Internet. For example, each time you 
open a web browser, your computer (the client) sends out a request for a specific web 
page. This request is routed over the Internet to a server. This server locates and sends 
the requested material back to your computer.
One advantage of the client/server network strategy is the ability to handle very 
large networks efficiently. Another advantage is the availability of powerful network 
management software to monitor and control network activities. The major disadvan­
tages are the cost of installation and maintenance.
In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, nodes have equal authority and can act as both 
clients and servers. The most common way to share games, movies, and music over 
the Internet is to use a P2P network. For example, special file-sharing software such as 
BitTorrent can be used to obtain files located on another personal computer and also 
can provide files to other personal computers.
P2P networks are rapidly growing in popularity as people continue to share infor­
mation with others around the world. The primary advantage is that they are easy and 
inexpensive (often free) to set up and use. One disadvantage of P2P networks is the 
lack of security controls or other common management functions. For this reason, few 
businesses use this type of network to communicate sensitive information.

Organizational Networks
Computer networks in organizations have evolved over time. Most large organizations 
have a complex and wide range of different network configurations, operating sys­
tems, and strategies. These organizations face the challenge of making these networks 
work together effectively and securely.

	
Communications and Networks 	 211
Internet Technologies
Many organizations today employ Internet technologies to support effective commu­
nication within and between organizations using intranets and extranets.
 • An intranet is a private network within an organization that resembles the Internet. 
Like the public Internet, intranets use browsers, websites, and web pages. Typical 
applications include electronic telephone directories, e-mail addresses, employee 
benefit information, internal job openings, and much more. Employees find surfing 
their organizational intranets to be as easy and as intuitive as surfing the Internet.
 • An extranet is a private network that connects more than one organization. Many 
organizations use Internet technologies to allow suppliers and others limited access 
to their networks. The purpose is to increase efficiency and reduce costs. For exam­
ple, an automobile manufacturer has hundreds of suppliers for the parts that go 
into making a car. By having access to the car production schedules, suppliers can 
schedule and deliver parts as they are needed at the assembly plants. In this way, 
operational efficiency is maintained by both the manufacturer and the suppliers.
Network Security
Large organizations face the challenge of ensuring that only authorized users have 
access to network resources, sometimes from multiple geographic locations or across 
the Internet. Securing large computer networks requires specialized technology. Three 
technologies commonly used to ensure network security are firewalls, intrusion detec­
tion systems, and virtual private networks.
 • A firewall consists of hardware and software that control access to a company’s 
intranet and other internal networks. Most use software or a special computer 
called a proxy server. All communications between the company’s internal net­
works and the outside world pass through this server. By evaluating the source 
and the content of each communication, the proxy server decides whether it is 
safe to let a particular message or file pass into or out of the organization’s net­
work. (See Figure 8-22.)
 • Intrusion detection systems (IDS) work with firewalls to protect an organiza­
tion’s network. These systems use sophisticated statistical techniques to analyze 
all incoming and outgoing network traffic. Using advanced pattern matching 
and heuristics, an IDS can recognize signs of a network attack and disable access 
before an intruder can do damage.
 • Virtual private networks (VPN) create a secure private connection between a remote 
user and an organization’s internal network. Special VPN protocols create the equiv­
alent of a dedicated line between a user’s home or laptop computer and a company 
server. The connection is heavily encrypted, and, from the perspective of the user, it 
appears that the workstation is actually located on the corporate network.
Like organizations, end users have security challenges and concerns. We need to 
be concerned about the privacy of our personal information. In the next chapter, we 
will discuss personal firewalls and other ways to protect personal privacy and security.

privacy
Did you know that right now, 
people are attempting to 
access private networks that 
hold your private records 
and correspondence? Some 
individuals and governments 
are continually attempting 
to gain unauthorized access 
to networks and to obtain 
information stored on 
computers on those networks. 
Sometimes the objective is 
simply to create mischief; other 
times, to steal information or to 
test the security of a network. 
While some would say that any 
type of unauthorized intrusion 
is an unacceptable violation of 
privacy, others would say that 
under certain circumstances 
(such as homeland security), 
these intrusions can be 
essential.

Careers in IT
Network administrators manage a company’s LAN and WAN networks. 
They may be responsible for design, implementation, and maintenance 
of networks. Duties usually include maintenance of both hardware 
and software related to a company’s intranet and Internet networks. 
Network administrators are typically responsible for diagnosing and 
repairing problems with these networks. Some network administra­
tors’ duties include planning and implementation of network security 
as well.
Employers typically look for candidates with a bachelor’s or an asso­
ciate’s degree in computer science, computer technology, or informa­
tion systems as well as practical networking experience. Experience 
with network security and maintenance is preferred. Also technical 
certification may be helpful in obtaining this position. Because network 
administrators are involved directly with people in many departments, 
good communication skills are essential.
Network administrators can expect to earn an annual salary of 
$47,000 to $64,000. Opportunities for advancement typically include 
upper-management positions. This position is expected to be among 
the fastest-growing jobs in the near future.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
Telepresence Lets You Be There 
without Actually Being There
How would you like to speak with distant friends or family as 
though they were in the same room at the touch of a button? 
Can you imagine receiving a physical examination from a doctor 
thousands of miles away? All this and more could be possible 
in the future thanks to the emerging technology known as tele-
presence. Telepresence can be considered the natural evolution 
of the phone call, from the analog 
telephone to the digital video chats 
of today. In the future, telepresence 
robots will allow video, audio, and 
manipulation of real-world objects. 
Technology has been making better 
telepresence, and will continue to 
evolve to improve our lives as we 
look to the future.
Telepresence seeks to create 
the illusion that you are actually at 
a remote location, seeing, hearing, 
and, someday maybe, even feeling as 
though you were really there. Today’s 
early implementations, such as Cisco 
TelePresence, mainly focus on an extension of videoconferenc­
ing, allowing people in different locations to conduct meetings as 
though they are sitting across a table from one another. This illu­
sion is created with very high-definition video, acoustically tuned 
audio systems, and high-speed networks. However, telepresence 
could someday go beyond the simple voice and videoconferenc­
ing available today, and the applications seem endless.
Robots are quickly becoming a key part of many telepres­
ence applications. In addition to audio and video feeds from 
another location, robots will bring you the ability to manipu­
late objects at the remote location. Such robots are already 
being used in the medical field. In one system, a surgeon 
uses special controls and screens in one room to control 
robotic arms that operate on the patient in another room. 
This type of system could be used to allow expert surgeons 
to perform several procedures on various patients located 
throughout the world in just one day!
In addition to manipulating objects, users may one day wear 
special gloves and other sensors 
that permit them to feel the objects 
being touched by the robot. This 
technology might be used to allow 
people to work in hazardous areas 
or perform search and rescue oper­
ations from a safe, remote location. 
A more casual application may see 
individuals using telepresence as a 
substitute for traditional vacations. 
Imagine touring remote cities or 
touching objects from a shipwreck 
on a deep-sea diving expedition 
without the expense, hassle, or risk 
of travel.
Various research institutions are currently experienc­
ing breakthroughs in the areas of holography, which is 
technology that creates 3D images, called holograms, that 
might pave the way to advanced telepresence. In the coming 
decade, you might be able to interact virtually with others via 
a projected, 3D hologram of yourself. How would you use 
telepresence? What benefits do you see from this technol­
ogy? How might telepresence affect traveling? Do you see 
any disadvantages?

COMMUNICATIONS
Communications is the process of sharing data, programs, 
and information between two or more computers. Appli­
cations include e-mail, texting, videoconferencing, and 
electronic commerce.
Connectivity
Connectivity is a concept related to using computer net­
works to link people and resources. You can link or con­
nect to large computers and the Internet, providing access 
to extensive information resources.
The Wireless Revolution
Mobile devices like smartphones and tablets have brought 
dramatic changes in connectivity and communications. 
These wireless devices are becoming widely used for com­
puter communication.
Communication Systems
Communication systems transmit data from one location 
to another. There are four basic elements:
 • Sending and receiving devices originate or accept 
messages.
 • Connection devices act as an interface between send­
ing and receiving devices and the communication 
channel.
 • Data transmission specifications are rules and proce­
dures for sending and receiving data.
 • Communication channel is the actual connecting or 
transmission medium for messages.
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
Communication channels carry data from one computer 
to another.
Physical Connections
Physical connections use a solid medium to connect send­
ing and receiving devices. Connections include twisted-
pair cable (telephone lines and Ethernet cables), coaxial 
cable, and fiber-optic cable.
Wireless Connections
Wireless connections do not use a solid substance to con­
nect devices. Most use radio waves.
 • Bluetooth—transmits data over short distances; widely 
used for a variety of wireless devices.
 • Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity)—uses high-frequency radio 
signals; most home and business wireless networks 
use Wi-Fi.
 • Microwave—line-of-sight communication; used to 
send data between buildings; longer distances require 
microwave stations.
 • WiMax (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave 
Access)—extends the range of Wi-Fi networks using 
microwave connections.
 • Cellular—uses cell towers to send and receive data 
within relatively small geographic regions or cells.
 • Satellite—uses microwave relay stations; GPS (global 
positioning system) tracks geographic locations.
 • Infrared—uses light waves over a short distance; line-
of-sight communication.
VISUAL SUMMARY
Communications and Networks

	
Communications and Networks 	 215
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the concepts of connectivity, the wireless revolu­
tion, and communication systems. Additionally, you need to know the essential parts of communication technology, 
including channels, connection devices, data transmission, networks, network architectures, and network types.
CONNECTION DEVICES
Many communication systems use standard telephone 
lines and analog signals. Computers use digital signals.
Modems
Modems modulate and demodulate. Transfer rate is mea­
sured in megabits per second. Three types are DSL, cable, 
and wireless (wireless wide area network, WWAN).
Connection Service
T1, T3 (DS3), and OC (optical carrier) lines provide sup­
port for very-high-speed, all-digital transmission for large 
corporations. More affordable technologies include dial-up, 
DSL (digital subscriber line), ADSL (widely used), cable, 
fiber-optic service (FiOS), satellite, and cellular services. 
4G (fourth-generation mobile telecommunications) can 
provide 10 times faster speeds than 3G using LTE (Long 
Term Evolution) connections.
DATA TRANSMISSION
Bandwidth measures a communication channel’s width or 
capacity. Four bandwidths are voiceband (low bandwidth), 
medium band, broadband (high-capacity transmissions), 
and baseband. Protocols are rules for exchanging data. 
Widely used Internet protocols include https and TCP/IP. 
IP addresses (Internet protocol addresses) are unique 
numeric Internet addresses. DNS (domain name server) 
converts text-based addresses to and from numeric IP 
addresses. Packets are small parts of messages.
NETWORKS
Computer networks connect two or more computers. 
Some specialized network terms include
 • Node—any device connected to a network.
 • Client—node requesting resources.
 • Server—node providing resources.
 • Directory server—specialized node that manages 
resources.
 • Host—any computer system that provides access to its 
resources over a network.
 • Router—a node that forwards data packets from one 
network to another network.
 • Switch—node that coordinates direct flow of data 
between other nodes. Hub is an older device that 
directed flow to all nodes.
 • NIC (network interface card)—LAN adapter card for 
connecting to a network.
 • NOS (network operating system)—controls and coor­
dinates network operations.
 • Network administrator—network specialist responsible 
for network operations.
NETWORK TYPES
Networks can be citywide or even international, using 
both wired and wireless connections.
 • Local area networks (LANs) connect nearby devices. 
Network gateways connect networks to one another. 
Ethernet is a LAN standard. These LANs are called 
Ethernet LANs.
 • Home networks are LANs used in homes.
 • Wireless LANs (WLANs) use a wireless access point 
(base station) as a hub. Hotspots provide Internet 
access in public places.
 • Personal area networks (PANs) are wireless networks 
for PDAs, cell phones, and other wireless devices.
 • Metropolitan area networks (MANs) link office build­
ings within a city, spanning up to 100 miles.
 • Wide area networks (WANs) are the largest type. 
They span states and countries or form worldwide net­
works. The Internet is the largest wide area network in 
the world.

NETWORK ARCHITECTURE
Network architecture describes how networks are arranged 
and resources are shared.
Topologies
A network’s topology describes the physical arrangement 
of a network.
 • Bus network—each device is connected to a common 
cable called a bus or backbone.
 • Ring network—each device is connected to two other 
devices, forming a ring.
 • Star network—each device is connected directly to a 
central network switch; most common type today.
 • Tree (hierarchical) network—a central node is con-
nected to subordinate nodes forming a treelike 
structure.
 • Mesh network—newest; each node has two or more 
connecting nodes.
Strategies
Every network has a strategy, or way of sharing informa-
tion and resources. Common network strategies include 
client/server and peer-to-peer.
 • Client/server (hierarchical) network—central comput-
ers coordinate and supply services to other nodes; 
based on specialization of nodes; widely used on 
the Internet; able to handle very large networks 
efficiently; powerful network management software 
available.
 • Peer-to-peer network—nodes have equal authority and 
act as both clients and servers; widely used to share 
games, movies, and music over the Internet; easy to 
set up and use; lacks security controls.
ORGANIZATIONAL NETWORKS
Internet Technologies
Internet technologies support effective communication 
using intranets and extranets.
 • Intranet—private network within an organization; uses 
browsers, websites, and web pages. Typical applica-
tions include electronic telephone directories, e-mail 
addresses, employee benefit information, internal job 
openings, and much more.
 • Extranet—like intranet except connects more than one 
organization; typically allows suppliers and others lim-
ited access to their networks.
Network Security
Three technologies commonly used to ensure network 
security are firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and 
virtual private networks.
 • Firewall—controls access; all communications pass 
through proxy server.
 • Intrusion detection systems (IDS)—work with fire-
walls; use sophisticated statistical techniques to recog-
nize and disable network attacks.
 • Virtual private network (VPN)—creates secure private 
connection between remote user and organization’s 
internal network.
CAREERS in IT
Network administrators manage a company’s LAN and 
WAN networks. Bachelor’s or associate’s degree in com-
puter science, computer technology, or information sys-
tems and practical networking experience required. 
Salary range is $47,000 to $64,000.

Learning Objectives
After you have read this chapter, you should be able to:
	1	 Identify the most significant concerns for effective implementation of computer technology.
	2	 Discuss the primary privacy issues of accuracy, property, and access.
	3	 Describe the impact of large databases, private networks, the Internet, and the web on privacy.
	4	 Discuss online identity and the major laws on privacy.
	5	 Discuss cybercrimes including creation of malicious programs such as viruses, worms, Trojan 
horses, and zombies as well as denial of service attacks, Internet scams, identity theft, cyber­
bullying, rogue Wi-Fi hotspots, and data manipulation.
	6	 Detail ways to protect computer security including restricting access, encrypting data, anticipat­
ing disasters, and preventing data loss.
	7	 Discuss computer ethics including copyright law, software piracy, digital rights management, the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, as well as plagiarism and ways to identify plagiarism.
Right now, criminals are trying to break into your e-mail, your 
online bank account, and even your cell phone. Organizations are 
recording and analyzing your every digital decision, leading many 
to believe that the future of the Internet will result in the end of 
privacy as we know it.
This chapter covers the things you need to know to be pre­
pared for this ever-changing digital world, including:
• Cybercrime—protect yourself from viruses, Internet scams, 
and identity theft.
• Privacy rights—learn what companies can legally record about 
your Internet usage and how they use that information.
• Safe computing—avoid embarrassment and worse by knowing 
the way Facebook and social networking share your information.
Why should I read this chapter?

224	 chapter 9
People
As we have discussed, information systems consist of people, procedures, software, 
hardware, data, and the Internet. This chapter focuses on people. While most every­
one agrees that technology has had a very positive impact on people, it is important to 
recognize the negative, or potentially negative, impacts as well.
Effective implementation of computer technology involves maximizing its positive 
effects while minimizing its negative effects. The most significant concerns are
 • Privacy: What are the threats to personal privacy, and how can we protect 
ourselves?
 • Security: How can access to sensitive information be controlled, and how can we 
secure hardware and software?
 • Ethics: How do the actions of individual users and companies affect society?
Let us begin by examining privacy.
Privacy
Technology makes it possible to collect and use data of all kinds, including informa­
tion about people. The websites you visit, the stores where you shop, and the tele­
phone calls you make are all examples of information about you. How would you feel 
if you learned such information was being collected or shared? Would it matter who 
was collecting it, or how it was being used, or whether it was even correct?
Introduction
There are more than one billion personal computers in use today. What 
are the consequences of the widespread presence of this technology? 
Does technology make it easy for others to invade our personal privacy? 
When we apply for a loan or for a driver’s license, or when we check out 
at the supermarket, is that information about us being distributed and used 
without our permission? When we use the web, is information about us 
being collected and shared with others?
This technology prompts lots of questions—very important questions. 
Perhaps these are some of the most important questions for the 21st cen­
tury. To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be aware of 
the potential impact of technology on people and how to protect yourself 
on the web. You need to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about personal 
privacy and organizational security.
Hi, I’m Anthony, and I’m an IT security analyst. 
I’d like to talk with you about privacy, security, 
and ethics, three critical topics for anyone 
who uses computers today. I would also like to 
talk about how you can protect your privacy, 
ensure your security, and act ethically.
“

Privacy, Security, and Ethics	 225
Privacy concerns the collection and use of data about individuals. There are three 
primary privacy issues:
 • Accuracy relates to the responsibility of those who collect data to ensure that the 
data is correct.
 • Property relates to who owns data.
 • Access relates to the responsibility of those who have data to control who is able to 
use that data.
Large Databases
Large organizations are constantly compiling information about us. The federal gov­
ernment alone has over 2,000 databases. Every day, data is gathered about us and 
stored in large databases. For example, telephone companies compile lists of the calls 
we make, the numbers called, locations from GPS-enabled smartphones, and so on. 
Credit card companies maintain user databases that track cardholder purchases, 
payments, and credit records. Supermarket scanners in grocery checkout counters 
record what we buy, when we buy it, how much we buy, and the price. Financial 
institutions, including banks and credit unions, record how much money we have, 
what we use it for, and how much we owe. Search engines record the search histories 
of their users including search topics and sites visited. Social networking sites collect 
every entry.
Effectively, every digital event—whether using a telephone or smartphone, buying 
a product or service, or sending or receiving any electronic communication—is col­
lected and recorded. As a result, the size and the number of databases are explod­
ing. In fact, it is widely reported that 90 percent of all of today’s digitally stored data 
was collected in just the last two years. This ever-growing volume of data is often 
referred to as big data.
A vast industry of data gatherers known as information resellers or information 
brokers now exists that collects, analyzes, and sells such personal data. (See ­Figure 9-1.) 
Using publicly available databases and in many cases nonpublic databases, informa­
tion resellers create electronic profiles, or highly detailed and personalized descrip­
tions of individuals.
Almost certainly, you have an electronic profile that includes your name, address, 
telephone number, Social Security number, driver’s license number, bank account num­
bers, credit card numbers, telephone records, shopping and purchasing patterns, and 
privacy
An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle 
(UAV or drone) is an aircraft 
without a human pilot. The U.S. 
military uses drones to take 
photographs, record videos, and 
run bombing missions without 
risk to American pilots. Drones 
are also used domestically to 
patrol the U.S. borders and to 
observe private locations in 
search of drugs. Opponents 
of drones say that they violate 
personal privacy rights; 
proponents of drones say that 
as long as the drone is in public 
air space, it does not violate 
personal privacy rights. What 
do you think? If a drone were to 
observe your backyard, would it 
be violating your privacy rights? 
What if a drone observed 
and/or took photographs 
through the windows in your 
home? Do drones have the right 
to track you when you go to 
public places? Should drones be 
used to follow and photograph 
individuals in public places?

more. Information resellers sell these electronic profiles to direct marketers, fund-­raisers, 
and others. Many provide these services on the web for free or for a nominal cost.
These profiles can reveal more than you might wish to make public and have an 
impact beyond what you might imagine. This raises many important issues, including
 • Collecting public, but personally identifying, information: What if people 
­anywhere in the world could view detailed images of you, your home, or your 
vehicle? Using detailed images captured with a specially equipped van, Google’s 
Street View project allows just that. Street View makes it possible to take a vir­
tual tour of many cities and neighborhoods from any computer with a connec­
tion to the Internet. (See Figure 9-2.) Although the images available on Street 
View are all taken in public locations, some have objected to the project as being 
an intrusion on their privacy.
As digital cameras and webcams become cheaper and software becomes more 
sophisticated, it is likely that many more issues involving personal privacy in pub­
lic spaces will need to be addressed. Such a combination of computing technolo­
gies could, for example, make real-time tracking of individuals in public places 
possible.
 • Spreading information without personal consent: How would you feel if an 
employer were using your Facebook, Google+, or other social networking profiles 
to make decisions about hiring, placement, promotion, and firing? It is a common 
practice today for many organizations.
As we have discussed in Chapter 2, social networking is designed for open 
sharing of information among individuals who share a common interest. Unfor­
tunately, this openness can put individuals using social networking sites at risk. 
In fact, some have lost their jobs after posting unflattering remarks about their 
supervisor or after discussing their dislike of their current job. Deeper analysis 
of your social networking profile may reveal even more about yourself than 
you intend.
The potential to inadvertently share personal information extends past what 
you might post to your social networking site. As an example, without your knowl­
edge or permission, a social networking friend might tag or identify you in a photo 
on his or her site. Once tagged, that photo can become part of your electronic pro­
file and available to others without your consent.

View

	
Privacy, Security, and Ethics	 227
 • Spreading inaccurate information: How would you like to be turned down for 
a home loan because of an error in your credit history? This is much more com­
mon than you might expect. What if you could not find a job or were fired from 
a job because of an error giving you a serious criminal history? This can and has 
happened due to simple clerical errors. In one case, an arresting officer while 
completing an arrest warrant incorrectly recorded the Social Security number 
of a criminal. From that time forward, this arrest and the subsequent conviction 
became part of another person’s electronic profile. This is an example of mistaken 
identity in which the electronic profile of one person is switched with another.
It’s important to know that you have some recourse. The law allows you to gain 
access to those records about you that are held by credit bureaus. Under the 
Freedom of Information Act, you are also entitled to look at your records held by 
government agencies. (Portions may be deleted for national security reasons.)
Private Networks
Suppose you use your company’s electronic mail system to send a co-worker an unflat­
tering message about your supervisor or to send a highly personal message to a friend. 
Later you find the boss has been reading these e-mails. In fact, many businesses search 
employees’ electronic mail and computer files using employee-monitoring software. 
These programs record virtually everything you do on your computer. One proposed 
law would not prohibit this type of electronic monitoring but would require employers 
to provide prior written notice. Employers also would have to alert employees during 
the monitoring with some sort of audible or visual signal. If you are employed and 
would like to know your company’s current policy on monitoring electronic communi­
cation, contact your human relations department.

privacy
Sharing personal information 
on a social networking site like 
Facebook is a voluntary activity. 
However, many individuals 
do not fully understand the 
complex sharing and privacy 
policies of these networks. 
This often causes unintentional 
sharing with people outside 
their intended social circle. The 
social networks themselves 
have come under fire from 
privacy groups, who say 
that these companies use 
complex settings and policies 
to get users to share more 
information than intended. This 
information is in turn shared 
with advertisers. Do you think 
social networking companies 
are a threat to privacy?
The Internet and the Web
When you send e-mail on the Internet or browse the web, do you have any concerns 
about privacy? Most people do not. They think that as long as they are using their 
own computer and are selective about disclosing their names or other personal infor­
mation, then little can be done to invade their personal privacy. Experts call this the 
­illusion of anonymity that the Internet brings.
As we discussed in Chapter 8, every computer on the Internet is identified by a 
unique number known as an IP address. IP addresses can be used to trace Internet 
activities to their origin, allowing computer security experts and law enforcement offi­
cers to investigate computer crimes such as unauthorized access to networks or shar­
ing copyright files without permission.
When you browse the web, your browser stores critical information onto your hard 
disk, typically without you being aware of it. This information, which contains records 
about your Internet activities, includes history and temporary Internet files.
 • History files include the locations, or addresses, of sites that you have recently 
visited. This history file can be displayed by your browser in various locations, 

228	 chapter 9
including the address bar (as you type) and the History page. To view your 
browsing history using Google Chrome, follow the steps in Figure 9-3.
 • Temporary Internet files, also known as the browser cache, contain web 
page content and instructions for displaying this content. Whenever you visit 
a website, these files are saved by your browser. If you leave a site and then 
return later, these files are used to quickly redisplay web content.
Another way your web activity can be monitored is with cookies. Cookies are 
small data files that are deposited on your hard disk from websites you have vis­
ited. Based on your browser’s settings, these cookies can be accepted or blocked. 
To see how to block cookies using Google Chrome, see Figure 9-4. Although you 
will generally not be aware when a website generates a cookie, the personalized 
experiences you enjoy on the web are often a result of those cookies. While cook­
ies are harmless in and of themselves, what makes them a potential privacy risk 
is that they can store information about you, your preferences, and your brows­
ing habits. The information stored generally depends on whether the cookie is a 
first-party or a third-party cookie.
 • A first-party cookie is one that is generated (and then read) only by the 
website you are currently visiting. Many websites use first-party cookies 
to store information about the current session, your general preferences, 
and your activity on the site. The intention of these cookies is to provide

a personalized experience on a particu­
lar site. For example, when you revisit 
a particular electronic commerce site, a 
previously deposited cookie can provide 
information so that you can be greeted by 
name and presented with sales and pro­
motions that interest you.
 • A third-party cookie is usually generated 
by an advertising company that is affiliated 
with the website you are currently visiting. 
These cookies are used by the advertising 
company to keep track of your web activ­
ity as you move from one site to the next. 
For this reason, they are often referred to 
as ­tracking cookies. Critics of this practice 
claim that your privacy is being violated 
because your activity is being recorded 
across multiple websites. Defenders of this 
practice argue that these cookies are beneficial because they help websites deliver ads 
that interest you. For example, suppose you visit four different websites that employ 
the same advertising agency. The first three sites are about cars, but the fourth is a 
search engine. When you visit the fourth site, you will likely see a car advertisement 
because your cookie showed that you had been visiting car-related websites.
Some users are not comfortable with the idea of web browsers storing so much 
information in the form of temporary Internet files, cookies, and history. For this rea­
son, browsers now offer users an easy way to delete their browsing history. To see how 
to delete browsing histories using Google Chrome, see Figure 9-5. In addition, most 
browsers also offer a privacy mode, which ensures that your browsing activity is not 
recorded on your hard disk. For example, Google Chrome provides Incognito Mode 
accessible from the Chrome menu, and Safari provides Private Browsing accessible 
from the Safari option on the main menu.
Although these web browser files can concern many individuals, several other 
threats could potentially violate your privacy. Web bugs, which are invisible images 
or HTML code hidden within a web page or e-mail message, can be used to transmit 

	
Privacy, Security, and Ethics	 229
information without your knowledge. When a user opens an e-mail containing a web 
bug, information is sent back to the source of the bug. The receiving server will now 
know that this e-mail address is active. One of the most common web bugs is used by 
companies that sell active mailing lists to spammers. Because of this deception, many 
e-mail programs now block images and HTML code from unknown senders. It is up 
to the user to decide whether or not to allow such content to be displayed for current 
and future messages.
The most dangerous type of privacy threat comes in the form of spyware. The term 
spyware is used to describe a wide range of programs that are designed to secretly 
record and report an individual’s activities on the Internet. Some of these programs can 
even make changes to your browser in order to deceive you and manipulate what you 
see online. Computer monitoring software is perhaps the most invasive and danger­
ous type of spyware. One type of computer monitoring software, known as a keystroke 
logger, records every activity and keystroke made on your computer system, including 
credit card numbers, passwords, and e-mail messages. Computer monitoring software 
can be deposited onto your hard drive without your knowledge by a malicious website

or by someone installing the program directly onto your computer. While such soft­
ware is deadly in the hands of criminals, it can be legally used by companies monitoring 
employees or law enforcement officials who are collecting evidence.
Unfortunately, many spyware programs go undetected, largely because users have 
no idea they are infected. Spyware will run in the background, invisible to the aver­
age user. Other times, it disguises itself as useful software, such as a security pro­
gram. Various studies have demonstrated that an alarming number of computers are 
infected with spyware. The financial impact to individuals, companies, and financial 
institutions is estimated at billions of dollars.
One of the best defenses against spyware is to exercise caution when visiting new 
websites and downloading software from an unknown source. Another defense 
involves using a category of software known as antispyware or spy removal programs, 
which are designed to detect and remove various types of privacy threats. (See 
­Figure 9-6.) For a list of some of these programs, see Figure 9-7.
Online Identity
Another aspect of Internet privacy comes from online identity, the information that 
people voluntarily post about themselves online. With the popularity of social network­
ing, blogging, and photo- and video-sharing sites, many people post intimate details of 
their lives without considering the consequences. Although it is easy to think of online 
identity as something shared between friends, the archiving and search features of the 
web make it available indefinitely to anyone who cares to look.
There are any number of cases of people who have lost their jobs on the basis of 
posts on social networking sites. These job losses range from a teacher (using off-color 
language and photos showing drinking) to a chief financial officer of a major 
corporation (discussing corporate dealings and financial data). The cases 
include college graduates being refused a job because of Facebook posts. 
How would you feel if information you posted about yourself on the web 
kept you from getting a job?
Major Laws on Privacy
Some federal laws governing privacy matters have been created. For exam­
ple, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act protects personal financial information, 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects

ethics
Lawmakers in Europe have 
created a “right to be forgotten” 
law. Under this law, a person can 
request that Google perform a 
search on their name and then 
remove any links to websites 
identified by the individual. In 
doing so, a person can remove 
an embarrassing past from 
Internet searches. Proponents of 
the law say that it allows people 
to live their lives without the 
stigma of a specific past action. 
Opponents of the law see it as in 
opposition to freedom of speech 
and an attack on others’ right 
to know. Do you think a person 
has the right to keep people 
from discovering their past? 
Should the right to be forgotten 
apply to everyone, or would it be 
different for a politician, a movie 
star, or a criminal?

Most of the information collected by private organizations is not covered by exist­
ing laws. However, as more and more individuals become concerned about controlling 
who has the right to personal information and how that information is used, compa­
nies and lawmakers will respond.

Security
We are all concerned with having a safe and secure environment to live in. We are 
careful to lock our car doors and our homes. We are careful about where we walk 
at night and whom we talk to. This is personal security. What about computer secu­
rity? What if someone gains unauthorized access to our computer or other computers 
that contain information about us? These people are commonly known as computer 
­hackers. It should be noted that not all hackers are intent on malicious actions and 
that not all are criminals. Security involves protecting individuals and organizations 
from theft and danger. Computer security specifically focuses on protecting informa­
tion, hardware, and software from unauthorized use, as well as preventing or limiting 
the damage from intrusions, sabotage, and natural disasters.
Cybercrime
Cybercrime or computer crime is any criminal offense that involves a computer and a 
network. It was recently estimated that cybercrime affects over 400 million people and 
costs over $400 billion each year. Cybercrimes can take various forms including the 
creation of malicious programs, denial of service attacks, rogue Wi-Fi hotspots, data 
manipulation, identity theft, Internet scams, and cyberbullying.
Malicious Programs  A cracker is a computer criminal who creates and distributes 
malicious programs. These programs are called malware, which is short for mali­
cious software. They are specifically designed to damage or disrupt a computer 
system. The three most common types of malware are viruses, worms, and Trojan 
horses.
 • Viruses are programs that migrate through networks and operating systems, and 
most attach themselves to different programs and databases. While some viruses 
are relatively harmless, many can be quite destructive. Once activated, these 
destructive viruses can alter and/or delete files. Creating and knowingly spread­
ing a virus is a very serious crime and a federal offense punishable under the 
­Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
Unfortunately, new computer viruses are appearing all the time. The best way 
to stay current is through services that keep track of viruses on a daily basis. 
For example, Symantec, McAfee, and Microsoft all track the most serious virus 
threats. (See Figure 9-8.)

232	 chapter 9
 • Worms are programs that simply replicate themselves over and over again. Once 
active in a network, the self-replicating activity clogs computers and networks 
until their operations are slowed or stopped. A recent worm traveled across the 
world within hours, stopping tens of thousands of computers along its way. Unlike 
a virus, a worm typically does not attach itself to a program or alter and/or delete 
files. Worms, however, can carry a virus. Once a virus has been deposited by a 
worm onto an unsuspecting computer system, the virus will either activate imme­
diately or lie dormant until some future time. For example, in 2010 the Stuxnet 
worm infected several networks in Iran. One of these networks was used by Iran’s 
nuclear program. Soon after the infection, several key pieces of nuclear equipment 
became permanently disabled.
Viruses and worms typically find their way into personal computers through 
e-mail attachments and programs downloaded from the Internet. Because viruses 
can be so damaging, computer users are advised to never open an e-mail attach­
ment from an unknown source and to exercise great care in accepting new pro­
grams and data from any source.
As we discussed in Chapter 4, antivirus programs alert users when certain 
kinds of viruses and worms enter their system. Two of the most widely used 
are Avast! Free Antivirus and Microsoft Security Essentials. Unfortunately, 
new viruses are being developed all the time, and not all viruses can be 
detected.
 • Trojan horses are programs that appear to be harmless; however, they contain 
malicious programs. Trojan horses are not viruses. Like worms, however, they 
can be carriers of viruses. The most common types of Trojan horses appear as free 
computer games and free screensaver programs that can be downloaded from 
the Internet. When a user installs one of these programs, the Trojan horse also 
secretly installs a virus on the computer system. The virus then begins its mischief. 
One of the most dangerous types of Trojan horse claims to provide free antivirus 
programs. When a user downloads one of these programs, the Trojan horse first 
installs a virus that locates and disables any existing virus protection programs 
before depositing other viruses.

Zombies are computers infected by a virus, worm, or Trojan horse that allows 
them to be remotely controlled for malicious purposes. A collection of zombie com­
puters is known as a botnet, or robot network. Botnets harness the combined power 
of many zombies for malicious activities like password cracking or sending junk 
e-mail. Because they are formed by many computers distributed across the Internet, 
botnets are hard to shut down even after they are detected. Unfortunately for indi­
vidual computer owners, it also can be difficult to detect when a personal computer 
has been compromised.
Denial of Service  A denial of service (DoS) attack attempts to slow down or stop 
a computer system or network by flooding a computer or network with requests 
for information and data. The targets of these attacks are usually Internet ser­
vice providers (ISPs) and specific websites. Once under attack, the servers at the 
ISP or the website become overwhelmed with these requests for service and are 
unable to respond to legitimate users. As a result, the ISP or website is effectively 
shut down.
Rogue Wi-Fi Hotspots  Free Wi-Fi networks are available almost everywhere from 
libraries to fast-food restaurants and coffee shops. Rogue Wi-Fi hotspots imitate these 
free networks. These rogue networks operate close to the legitimate free hotspots and 
typically provide stronger signals that many users unsuspectingly connect to. Once 
connected, the rogue networks capture any and all information sent by the users to 
legitimate sites including user names and passwords.
Data Manipulation  Finding entry into someone’s computer network and leaving a 
prankster’s message may seem like fun, which is why hackers do it. It is still against 
the law. Moreover, even if the manipulation seems harmless, it may cause a great deal 
of anxiety and wasted time among network users.
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act makes it a crime for unauthorized persons 
even to view—let alone copy or damage—data using any computer across state lines. 
It also prohibits unauthorized use of any government computer or a computer used 
by any federally insured financial institution. Offenders can be sentenced to up to 
20 years in prison and fined up to $100,000.
Identity Theft  Identity theft is the illegal assumption of someone’s identity for the 
purposes of economic gain. It is one of the fastest-growing crimes in the country and 
can financially devastate its victim. Once an identity is stolen, the criminal applies for 
and obtains new credit cards in the victim’s name and then uses the cards to purchase 
clothes, cars, and even a house.
To commit this crime, identity thieves 
look for anything that can help them 
steal your identity, from your Social 
Security number and date of birth, to 
account information and passwords. 
Sometimes they gain this information 
from social networking sites, where users 
often post detailed personal information 
such as their birth dates, family member 
names, home addresses, and photos of 
their children. As mentioned previously, 
always exercise caution when providing 
information on Facebook, Twitter, and 
other social networking sites, and use 
the privacy settings and controls that are 
provided at the social networking sites 
you use.
Identity theft is a growing problem, and can be financially devas­
tating if you are a victim. Thieves are after anything that can help 
them steal your identity, from your Social Security number and date of birth to 
account information and passwords. Here are some steps to help protect your 
identity:
		
Be careful what you write on the Internet. Never post personal information on 
forums or social networking areas that are public or in response to an e-mail 
from someone you do not know or trust.
		
Only do business on the Internet with companies you know to be legitimate.
		
When selling a computer, be sure to completely remove all personal information 
from the hard drive. To ensure that your personal information is erased, 
consider using a free erasure software tool, such as Dban (www.dban.com).
		
Monitor your credit. Each year, you are entitled to a free personal credit report 
from each of the three major credit reporting agencies. Monitor your credit by 
requesting a report every four months from a different reporting agency. The 
official site for this service is www.annualcreditreport.com.

Internet Scams  A scam is a fraudulent or deceptive act or operation designed to trick 
individuals into providing personal information or spending their time and money for 
little or no return. An Internet scam is simply a scam using the Internet. Internet 
scams are becoming a serious problem and have created financial and legal problems 
for many thousands of people. Almost all the scams are initiated by a mass mailing to 
unsuspecting individuals.
A technique often employed by scammers is phishing (pronounced “fishing”). 
Phishing attempts to trick Internet users into thinking a fake but official-looking web­
site or e-mail is legitimate. Phishing has grown in sophistication, replicating entire 
websites like PayPal to try to lure users into divulging their financial information.
See Figure 9-9 for a list of common types of Internet scams.
Cyberbullying  A fairly recent and all-too-common phenomenon, cyberbullying is the 
use of the Internet, smartphones, or other devices to send or post content intended to 
hurt or embarrass another person. Although not always a crime, it can lead to criminal 
prosecution. Cyberbullying includes sending repeated unwanted e-mails to an individ­
ual who has stated that he or she wants no further contact with the sender, ganging up 
on victims in electronic forums, posting false statements designed to injure the reputa­
tion of another, maliciously disclosing personal data about a person that could lead to 
harm to that person, and sending any type of communication that is threatening or 
harassing. Never participate in cyberbullying, and discourage others from participat­
ing in this dangerous and hateful activity.
For a summary of computer crimes, see Figure 9-10.

Did you know that the World 
Wide Web contains websites 
purposely hidden from you? 
Some websites are designed 
to be hidden from standard 
search engines and allow 
people to communicate in a 
secure and anonymous manner. 
These hidden websites make 
up the Dark Web and require 
special software that makes it 
nearly impossible to identify 
who is using it. The ability to 
communicate anonymously 
attracts criminals who want 
to sell drugs, share child 
pornography, or profit from 
the poaching of endangered 
animals. This same anonymity 
allows people in countries 
where political dissent is 
dangerous and free speech is 
censored to communicate, plan, 
and organize toward a more 
free and open society without 
fear of jail or execution. Prior

Measures to Protect Computer Security
There are numerous ways in which computer systems and data can be compromised 
and many ways to ensure computer security. Some of the principal measures to ensure 
computer security are restricting access, encrypting data, anticipating disasters, and 
preventing data loss.
Restricting Access  Security experts are constantly devising ways to protect com­
puter systems from access by unauthorized persons. Sometimes security is a matter 
of putting guards on company computer rooms and checking the identification of 
everyone admitted. Other times it is using biometric scanning devices such as finger­
print and iris (eye) scanners. (See Figure 9-11.) There are numerous applications that 
use face recognition to allow access to a computer system. For example, many per­
sonal computer systems use Dell’s FastAccess face recognition application to prevent 
un­authorized access. There are also several face recognition apps for mobile devices 
including Face Recognition by iNFINITE Studios LLC.
Oftentimes it is a matter of being careful about assigning passwords to people and 
changing the passwords when people leave a company. Passwords are secret words or 
phrases (including numbers, letters, and special characters) that must be keyed into a 
computer system to gain access. For many applications on the web, users assign their 
own passwords. Windows 8 includes an application, Picture Password, that accepts a 
series of gestures over a picture of the user’s choice to gain access.

236	 chapter 9
The strength of a password depends 
on how easily it can be guessed. A dic­
tionary attack uses software to try thou­
sands of common words sequentially in 
an attempt to gain unauthorized access to 
a user’s account. For this reason, words, 
names, and simple numeric patterns 
make weak or poor passwords. Strong 
passwords have at least eight characters 
and use a combination of letters, num­
bers, and symbols. It is also important not 
to reuse passwords for different accounts. 
If one account is compromised, that pass­
word might be tried for access to other 
systems as well. For example, if a low-
security account such as an online web 
forum is compromised, that password 
could also be tried on higher-security 
accounts such as banking websites.
As mentioned in previous chapters, individuals and organizations use a variety of 
ways to perform and automate important security tasks:
 • Security suites provide a collection of utility programs designed to protect your 
privacy and security while you are on the web.
 • Firewalls act as a security buffer between a corporation’s private network and all 
external networks, including the Internet. All electronic communications com­
ing into and leaving the corporation must pass through the company’s firewall 
where it is evaluated. Security is maintained by denying access to unauthorized 
communications.
 • Password managers help you create strong passwords. Additionally, they will 
store all your passwords in one location and automatically provide the appropriate 
password when requested from one of your favorite sites. This avoids many of the 
mistakes people make in generating and remembering passwords. However, this 
master list of passwords is protected by one ”master” password. If you forget or 
reveal this master password, you open yourself up to considerable risk.
Encrypting Data  Whenever information is sent over a network or stored on a com­
puter system, the possibility of unauthorized access exists. The solution is encryption, 
the process of coding information to make it unreadable except to those who have 
a special piece of information known as an encryption key, or, simply, a key. Some 
­common uses for encryption include
 • E-mail encryption: Protects e-mail messages as they move across the Internet. One 
of the most widely used personal e-mail encryption programs is Pretty Good Pri­
vacy. (See Figure 9-12.)
 • File encryption: Protects sensitive files by encrypting them before they are stored 
on a hard drive. Files can be encrypted individually, or specialized software can be 
used to encrypt all files automatically each time they are saved to a certain hard 
drive location. (See Figure 9-13.)
 • Website encryption: Secures web transactions, especially financial transactions. 
Web pages that accept passwords or confidential information like a credit card 
number are often encrypted.
As we discussed in Chapters 2 and 8, https (hypertext transfer protocol secure) 
is the most widely used Internet protocol. This protocol requires that the browser 
and the connecting site encrypt all messages, providing a safer and more secure 
transmission.
Security professionals warn that most people use passwords 
that are too easily guessed. They categorize passwords as 
weak (easily guessed) or strong (difficult to guess). A weak password can 
be guessed in a matter of seconds, a strong one would take years to crack. 
Make sure you have a strong password by employing the following tips when 
creating a password.
		
Use a password with at least eight characters. The fewer the characters, the 
easier it is to guess.
		
Do not use your user name, real name, or company name in your password. The 
first thing a cracker will try is variations of your personal information.
		
Do not use a complete word. Using a computer, a cracker can easily try every 
word in the dictionary as a password guess.
		
Do not reuse passwords. If a user’s password for one account is compromised, 
hackers will attempt to use that password on the user’s other accounts.
		
Create a password that contains at least one of each of the following 
characters: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and symbol.

 • Virtual private networks: Virtual private 
networks (VPNs) encrypt connections 
between company networks and remote 
users such as workers connecting from 
home. This connection creates a secure vir­
tual connection to a company LAN across 
the Internet.
 • Wireless network encryption: Restricts access 
to authorized users on wireless networks. 
WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) is the most 
widely used wireless network encryption for 
home wireless networks. WPA2 is typically 
established for a wireless network through 
the network’s wireless router. While the spe­
cifics vary between routers, WPA2 is usually 
set through the router’s settings options.

disasters. Data security is concerned with protecting software and data from unauthor­
ized tampering or damage. Most large organizations have disaster recovery plans describ­
ing ways to continue operating until normal computer operations can be restored.
Preventing Data Loss  Equipment can always be replaced. A company’s data, how­
ever, may be irreplaceable. Most companies have ways of trying to keep software and 
data from being tampered with in the first place. They include careful screening of job 
applicants, guarding of passwords, and auditing of data and programs from time to 
time. Some systems use redundant storage to prevent loss of data even when a hard 
drive fails. We discussed RAID in Chapter 7, which is a commonly used type of redun­
dant storage. Backup batteries protect against data loss due to file corruption during 
unexpected power outages.
Making frequent backups of data is essential to prevent data loss. Backups are 
often stored at an off-site location to protect data in case of theft, fire, flood, or other 
disasters. Students and others often use flash drives and cloud storage as discussed 
in Chapter 7 to back up homework and important papers. Incremental backups 
store multiple versions of data at different points in time to prevent data loss due to 
unwanted changes or accidental deletion.
To see how you could use a cloud-based backup service, see Making IT Work for 
You: Cloud-Based Backup on page 239.

Ethics
What do you suppose controls how computers can be used? You probably think first 
of laws. Of course, that is right, but technology is moving so fast that it is very difficult 
for our legal system to keep up. The essential element that controls how computers are 
used today is ethics.
Ethics, as you may know, are standards of moral conduct. Computer ethics are 
guidelines for the morally acceptable use of computers in our society. Ethical treatment 
is critically important to us all, and we are all entitled to ethical treatment. This includes 
the right to keep personal information, such as credit ratings and medical histories, from

CLOUD-BASED BACKUP
Do you remember to make frequent backups of your irreplaceable data files, such as photos and documents? 
Would you like a service that remembers to do the backups for you and places them in a very reliable loca­
tion? If so, then a cloud-based backup service is a solution, and this guide will discuss their benefits, as well 
as various options on types of backups.
Benefits of Cloud-Based Backups
	1	 •	 Security. Without a backup, you can lose data 
due to a hard drive failure, computer virus, 
laptop theft, or fire.
	2	 •	 Automation. It is easy to forget to do a manual 
backup, and without frequent backups, you 
may lose important data when a restore is 
required.
	3	 •	 Cloud based. Environmental events, such 
as a fire or flood, can damage both the local 
computer and the backup. By storing backups 
on a cloud server, a physical event that 
damages your local copy will not impact your cloud-based backup.
Backup Options Once you have decided to automate your backup procedure, you may be surprised at the number of options 
available to you.
	1	 •	 Backup software. Depending on your 
operating system and the level of 
customization you want, there are several 
options. Most operating systems come with 
free backup software; Microsoft Windows 
comes with File History and Apple OSX 
comes with Time Machine.
	2	 •	 Backup frequency and schedule. A backup 
can tax the processor and hard drive 
of a system, slowing down a computer’s 
performance. Depending on when your 
computer is turned on and how you use your 
machine, you will need to tune how often and 
when a backup is taken to best suit your needs.
	3	 •	 Which files to back up. You may want to backup your entire hard drive, or you may choose to back up specific 
folders, such as photos and videos–most backup software allows you to choose which folders are backed up.
	4	 •	 Cloud services. There are many cloud storage services available; depending on your operating system, backup 
software, and budget, you have several options. Popular choices include Apple’s iCloud, Microsoft’s Azure, and 
Google’s Google Drive. There are also specialized backup programs with cloud storage plans bundled together, 
such as Carbonite’s Personal Backup Plans.

getting into unauthorized hands. These issues, largely under the control of corporations 
and government agencies, were covered earlier in this chapter. These issues and many 
more have been addressed in the Ethics boxes throughout this book. Now we’ll examine 
two important issues in computer ethics where average users have a role to play.
Copyright and Digital Rights Management
Copyright is a legal concept that gives content creators the right to control use and 
distribution of their work. Materials that can be copyrighted include paintings, books, 
music, films, and even video games. Some users choose to make unauthorized copies 
of digital media, which violates copyright. For example, making an unauthorized copy 
of a digital music file for a friend might be a copyright violation.
Software piracy is the unauthorized copying and/or distribution of software. 
According to a recent study, software piracy costs the software industry over 
$60 ­billion annually. To prevent copyright violations, corporations often use digital 
rights management (DRM). DRM encompasses various technologies that control 
access to electronic media and files. Typically, DRM is used to (1) control the number 
of devices that can access a given file and (2) limit the kinds of devices that can access 
a file. Although some companies see DRM as a necessity to protect their rights, some 
users feel they should have the right to use the media they buy—including movies, 
music, software, and video games—as they choose.
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act makes it illegal to deactivate or otherwise 
­disable any antipiracy technologies including DRM technologies. The act also establishes 
that copies of commercial programs may not be legally resold or given away. It further 
makes it a crime to sell or to use programs or devices that are used to illegally copy software. 
This may come as a surprise to those who copy software, movies, or music from a friend 
or from the Internet. The law is clear: It is illegal to copy or download ­copyright-protected 
music and videos from the Internet without appropriate authorization.
Today, there are many legal sources for digital media. Television programs can be 
watched online, often for free, on television-network-sponsored sites. Sites like Pandora 
allow listeners to enjoy music at no cost. There are several online stores for purchas­
ing music and video content. A pioneer in 
this area is Apple’s iTunes Music Store. (See 
Figure 9-15.)
Plagiarism
Another ethical issue is plagiarism, which 
means representing some other person’s 
work and ideas as your own without giving 
credit to the original source. Although pla­
giarism was a problem long before the inven­
tion of computers, computer technology has 
made plagiarism easier. For example, simply 
cutting and pasting content from a web page 
into a report or paper may seem tempting to 
an overworked student or employee.
Correspondingly, computer technology 
has made it easier than ever to recognize and 
catch plagiarists. For example, services such 
as Turnitin are dedicated to preventing Inter­
net plagiarism. This service will examine the 
content of a paper and compare it to a wide 
range of known public electronic documents 
including web page content. In this way, Turn­
itin can identify an undocumented paper or 
even parts of an undocumented paper. (See 
Figure 9-16.)
ethics
Net neutrality is the policy 
that ISPs should deliver all 
data to customers at the 
same speed, regardless of 
the content. Opponents of net 
neutrality would allow ISPs to 
charge companies to deliver 
some websites faster, arguing 
that ISPs should be allowed 
to charge however they like. 
Proponents of net neutrality 
argue that the Internet has 
always had equal and unbiased 
access to information and that 
allowing ISPs to vary access 
to websites based on content 
is a new form of censorship. 
What do you think? Is net 
neutrality an important defense 
of Internet freedom of speech, 
or is it government overreach 
looking to hinder free markets?

Careers in IT
IT security analysts are responsible for maintaining the security of a 
company’s networks, systems, and data. Their goal is to ensure the confi­
dentiality, integrity, and availability of information. These analysts must 
safeguard information systems against a variety of external threats, such 
as hackers and viruses, as well as be vigilant of threats that may come 
from within the company.
Employers typically look for candidates with a bachelor’s or associ­
ate’s degree in information systems or computer science. Experience in 
this field or in network administration is usually required. IT security 
analysts should possess good communication and research skills, and be 
able to handle high-stress situations.
IT security analysts can expect to earn an annual salary of $46,000 
to $64,000. Opportunities for advancement typically depend on experi­
ence. Demand for this position is expected to grow as malware, ­hackers, 
and other types of threats become more complex and prevalent.
Now that you have learned about privacy, 
security, and ethics, let me tell you about 
my career as an IT security analyst.

ethics
Do you know of anyone who 
has copied parts of a web page 
from a variety of sites and 
combined the parts to form a 
term paper? Of course, such a 
practice is unethical and most 
likely illegal. Many schools and 
universities now use a program 
that can compare the content of 
a student’s paper to published 
material on the web and to 
previously submitted papers. 
Do you think it is ethical for 
instructors to employ a program 
that checks for plagiarism? Is 
there a risk that the program 
may confuse proper citations 
from the web with obvious cases 
of plagiarism?

242
Many online companies are also fighting to end ano­
nymity. This is because they make most of their money off 
targeted advertising. For these companies to deliver the 
proper advertisement to you, they need to know quite a 
bit about you and your online activities. By having a pro­
file with your real name and interests, they can follow your 
activity throughout the web to get to know you better. At 
present, many advertisements you see online are for a 
product or service that does not interest you. In the future, 
every advertisement you see will 
be selected just for you, as mar­
keting companies develop a com­
plete profile that lets them know 
everything about you.
Now, many online businesses 
do aim to protect your privacy, 
but this is only with respect to 
what the public knows about you. 
When it comes to their advertis­
ing partners, they don’t hide much 
because it is not in their interest 
to do so. Essentially, it is a trade-
off for users, whether to give up 
some (or all) of your anonymity 
in return for targeted advertis­
ing. Although many organizations 
are working toward ending or 
severely limiting anonymity, some 
would like to keep the Internet the 
way it is.
Many civil rights groups and journalists support ano­
nymity as a basic right. If you cannot be anonymous, then 
it would be difficult, for example, to post information that 
uncovers abuses in government or in a business. Some 
psychologists also support anonymity, stating that creating 
a separate online identity can be useful for personal devel­
opment, allowing an individual to explore interests without 
leaving a record that is tied to his or her own life. How do 
you feel about the possible end to anonymity? Do you agree 
that there will be less negativity on the web if everyone had 
to provide real names? Since advertisements pay for free 
services, will you at least tolerate future ads more if they 
contain something that interests you?
The End of Anonymity
Do you enjoy the ability to interact with others on the web 
anonymously? Is there a sense of comfort knowing that you 
can express yourself freely without others knowing your iden­
tity? Anonymity has been a way of life on the Internet since 
the very beginning. Recently, various organizations, ranging 
from advertisers to governments, are questioning whether 
the Internet can continue like this. And based on the amount 
of information currently shared by 
people online, one wonders whether 
anonymity will be valued at all in 
the future. Technology has been 
profoundly impacting our anonym­
ity and public interactions, and will 
continue to evolve to impact our 
lives as we look to the future.
There are many factors that are 
causing many to question the value 
of anonymity. First is the issue 
of harassment. Most forums and 
comment areas on websites allow 
users to post messages anony­
mously. Some individuals use this 
ability to write abusive or threat­
ening comments. Many children 
and teenagers have been victims 
of online harassment, or cyberbul­
lying, at some point in their lives. 
Others have been stalked online to 
the point where they have experienced psychological harm. 
Experts feel that if anonymous comments were disallowed, 
those same individuals would not be willing to write those 
types of messages, as their anonymity would be stripped. 
The other area where anonymity has become a problem is 
the legal field. Some anonymous web users have posted lies 
about individuals or businesses that have damaged the tar­
get’s reputation. In the real world, those types of false and 
damaging comments could lead to lawsuits. For these rea­
sons, many legislators are proposing laws aimed at discour­
aging the sort of anonymity that allows various online crimes 
to occur. In the future, it may even be a requirement to pro­
vide a real-world ID in order to use the Internet.

Privacy, Security, and Ethics
PRIVACY
PRIVACY
VISUAL SUMMARY
Privacy concerns the collection and use of data about indi­
viduals. There are three primary privacy issues: accuracy 
(who is responsible to ensure data is correct), property 
(who owns data), access (who controls access to data).
Large Databases
Large organizations are constantly compiling informa­
tion about us. This ever-growing volume of data is often 
referred to as big data. Information resellers (information 
brokers) collect and sell personal data. Electronic profiles 
are compiled from databases to provide highly detailed 
and personalized descriptions of individuals.
Mistaken identity occurs when an electronic profile 
of one person is switched with another. The Freedom of 
Information Act entitles individuals access to governmen­
tal records relating to them.
Private Networks
Many organizations monitor employee e-mail and 
computer files using special software called employee-­
monitoring software.
The Internet and the Web
Many people believe that, while using the web, little can 
be done to invade their privacy. This is called the illusion 
of anonymity.
Information stored by browsers includes history files 
(record sites visited) and temporary Internet files or 
browser cache (contain website content and display 
instructions). Cookies store and track information. Pri­
vacy mode (Private Browsing) ensures that your browsing 
activity is not recorded.
Spyware secretly records and reports Internet activi­
ties. Keystroke loggers (one type of computer monitoring 
software) records every activity and keystroke. Antispy­
ware (spy removal programs) detects and removes various 
privacy threats.
Online Identity
Many people post personal information and sometimes 
intimate details of their lives without considering the 
consequences. This creates an online identity. With the 
archiving and search features of the web, this identity is 
indefinitely available to anyone who cares to look for it.
Major Laws on Privacy
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act protects personal finan­
cial information; the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) protects medical records; and 
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 
restricts disclosure of educational records.

244	 chapter 9
SECURITY
SECURITY
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to be aware of the potential impact of technology on people. You 
need to be sensitive to and knowledgeable about personal privacy, organizational security, and ethics.
Computer security focuses on protecting information, 
hardware, and software from unauthorized use as well as 
preventing damage from intrusions, sabotage, and natu­
ral disasters. Someone who gains unauthorized access to 
computers that contain information about us is commonly 
known as a computer hacker. Not all hackers are intent on 
malicious actions and not all are criminals.
Cybercrime
Cybercrime (computer crime) is an illegal action involving 
special knowledge of computer technology.
 • Malicious programs (malware) include viruses (the 
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act makes spreading a 
virus a federal offense), worms, and Trojan horses. 
Zombies are remotely controlled infected computers 
used for malicious purposes. A collection of zombie 
computers is known as a botnet, or robot network.
 • Denial of service (DoS) attack is an attempt to shut 
down or stop a computer system or network.
 • Rogue Wi-Fi hotspots imitate legitimate hotspots to 
capture personal information.
 • Data manipulation involves changing data or leaving 
prank messages. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 
helps protect against data manipulation.
 • Identity theft is the illegal assumption of someone’s 
identity for the purposes of economic gain.
 • Scams are designed to trick individuals into spend­
ing their time and money with little or no return. 
Common Internet scams are frequently coupled with 
phishing websites or e-mails.
 • Cyberbullying is the use of the Internet, cell phones, 
or other devices to send or post content intended to 
hurt or embarrass another person.
Measures to Protect Computer Security
There are numerous ways in which computer systems and 
data can be compromised and many ways to protect com­
puter security. These measures include
 • Access can be restricted through biometric scanning 
devices and passwords (secret words or phrases; dic­
tionary attacks use thousands of words to attempt to 
gain access); security suites, firewalls, and password 
managers help with security tasks.
 • Encrypting is coding information to make it unread­
able except to those who have the encryption key. 
Hypertext transfer protocol secure (https) requires 
browsers and websites to encrypt all messages. Vir­
tual private networks (VPNs) encrypt connections 
between company networks and remote users. WPA2 
(Wi-Fi Protected Access) is the most widely used wire­
less network encryption for home wireless networks.
 • Anticipating disasters involves physical security, data 
security, and disaster recovery plans.
 • Preventing data loss involves protecting data by 
screening job applicants, guarding passwords, and 
auditing and backing up data.

	
Privacy, Security, and Ethics	 245
ETHICS
ETHICS
What do you suppose controls how computers can be 
used? You probably think first of laws. Of course, that is 
right, but technology is moving so fast that it is very diffi­
cult for our legal system to keep up. The essential element 
that controls how computers are used today is ethics.
Ethics are standards of moral conduct. Computer ethics 
are guidelines for the morally acceptable use of comput­
ers in our society. We are all entitled to ethical treatment. 
This includes the right to keep personal information, such 
as credit ratings and medical histories, from getting into 
unauthorized hands.
Copyright and Digital Rights Management
Copyright is a legal concept that gives content creators the 
right to control use and distribution of their work. Mate­
rials that can be copyrighted include paintings, books, 
music, films, and even video games.
Software piracy is the unauthorized copying and dis­
tribution of software. The software industry loses over 
$60 billion annually to software piracy. Two related top­
ics are the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and digital 
rights management.
 • Digital Millennium Copyright Act establishes the 
right of a program owner to make a backup copy of 
any program and disallows the creation of copies to 
be sold or given away. It is also illegal to ­download 
­copyright-protected music and videos from the 
Internet.
 • Digital rights management (DRM) is a collection of 
technologies designed to prevent copyright violations. 
Typically, DRM is used to (1) control the number of 
devices that can access a given file and (2) limit the 
kinds of devices that can access a file.
Today, many legal sources for digital media exist, including
 • Television programs that can be watched online, often 
for free, on television-network-sponsored sites.
 • Sites like Pandora that allow listeners to enjoy music at 
no cost.
 • Online stores that legally sell music and video content. 
A pioneer in this area is Apple’s iTunes Music Store.
Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the illegal and unethical representation of 
some other person’s work and ideas as your own without 
giving credit to the original source. Examples of plagia­
rism include cutting and pasting web content into a report 
or paper.
Recognizing and catching plagiarists is relatively easy. 
For example, services such as Turnitin are dedicated to 
preventing Internet plagiarism. This service examines a 
paper’s content and compares it to a wide range of known 
public electronic documents including web page content. 
Exact duplication or paraphrasing is readily identified.
CAREERS IN IT
IT security analysts are responsible for maintaining the 
­security of a company’s network, systems, and data. 
Employers look for candidates with a bachelor’s or associ­
ate’s degree in information systems or computer ­science 
and network experience. Salary range is $46,000 to $64,000.

Learning Objectives
After you have read this chapter, you should be able to:
	1	 Explain the functional view of an organization and describe each function.
	2	 Describe the management levels and the informational needs for each level in an organization.
	3	 Describe how information flows within an organization.
	4	 Describe computer-based information systems.
	5	 Distinguish among a transaction processing system, a management information system, a decision 
support system, and an executive support system.
	6	 Distinguish between office automation systems and knowledge work systems.
	7	 Explain the difference between data workers and knowledge workers.
	8	 Define expert systems and knowledge bases.
You hear an intruder in your home late at night and 
call the police; a fast response may save your life! Law 
enforcement use their information systems to organize 
resources and prioritize emergency calls—improving 
response times and saving lives. In the future, infor­
mation systems of all types will automatically adjust 
to their environments and help organizations react to 
current and future changes.
This chapter covers the things you need to know 
to be prepared for this ever-changing digital world, 
including:
• Organizational flow—identify how information 
flows within an organization.
Why should I read this chapter?
• Computer-based information systems—recognize the levels of information systems and how they help 
businesses make decisions.
• Other information systems—understand expert systems and how you can use them to make faster, 
smarter decisions.

Introduction
An information system is a collection of people, procedures, software, hard­
ware, data, and connectivity (as we discussed in Chapter 1). They all work 
together to provide information essential to running an organization. This 
information is critical to successfully produce a product or service and, for 
profit-oriented enterprises, to derive a profit.
Why are computers used in organizations? No doubt you can easily state 
one reason: to keep records of events. However, another reason might be 
less obvious: to help make decisions. For example, point-of-sale terminals 
record sales as well as which salesperson made each sale. This informa­
tion can be used for decision making. For instance, it can help the sales 
manager decide which salespeople will get year-end bonuses for doing 
exceptional work.
The Internet, communication links, and databases connect you with infor­
mation resources as well as information systems far beyond the surface of 
your desk. The personal computer offers you access to a greater quantity 
of information than was possible a few years ago. In addition, you also have 
access to better-quality information. As we show in this chapter, when you tap 
into a computer-based information system, you not only get information—you 
also get help in making decisions.
To efficiently and effectively use computers within an organization, you 
need to understand how the information flows as it moves through an orga­
nization’s different functional areas and management levels. You need to be 
aware of the different types of computer-based information systems, including 
transaction processing systems, management information systems, decision 
support systems, and executive support systems. You also need to understand 
the role and importance of databases to support each level or type of infor­
mation system.
254	 chapter 10
Hi, I’m Alice, and I’m an information systems 
manager. I’d like to talk with you about how 
organizations use computer information 
systems. I’d also like to talk about special­
ized knowledge work systems that assist 
managers, engineers, and scientists make 
decisions.

Organizational Information Flow
Computerized information systems do not just keep track of transactions and day-
to-day business operations. They also support the vertical and horizontal flow of 
information within the organization. To understand this, we need to understand 
how an organization is structured. One way to examine an organization’s structure 
is to view it from a functional perspective. That is, you can study the different basic 
functional areas in organizations and the different types of people within these func­
tional areas.
As we describe these, consider how they apply to a hypothetical manufacturer of 
sporting goods, the HealthWise Group. This company manufactures equipment for 
sports and physical activities. Its products range from soccer balls to yoga mats. (See 
Figure 10-1.)
Like many organizations, HealthWise Group can be viewed from a functional per­
spective with various management levels. Effective operations require an efficient and 
coordinated flow of information throughout the organization.
Functions
Depending on the services or products they provide, most organizations have 
departments that specialize in one of five basic functions. These are accounting,

Accounting
Marketing
Production
Research
Human resources
Marketing handles planning, pricing, promoting, selling, 
and distributing goods and services to customers. 
At HealthWise, it even gets involved with creating a 
customer newsletter that is distributed via the corporate 
web page.
Research conducts basic research 
and relates new discoveries to the ﬁrm’s 
current or new products department. 
Research people at HealthWise explore 
new ideas from exercise physiologists 
about muscle development. They use this 
knowledge to design new physical ﬁtness 
machines.
Accounting tracks all ﬁnancial 
activity. At HealthWise, this 
department records bills and other 
ﬁnancial transactions with sporting 
goods stores. It also produces 
ﬁnancial statements, including 
budgets and forecasts of ﬁnancial 
performance.
Human resources is involved with all 
human-centered activities across the entire 
organization. At HealthWise, this department is 
implementing a new beneﬁts package designed to 
attract new employees and retain current employees.
Production takes in raw materials and people work to turn 
out ﬁnished goods (or services). It may be a manufacturing 
activity or—in the case of a retail store—an operations 
activity. At HealthWise, this department purchases steel and 
aluminum to be used in weight-lifting and exercise machines.

to paying employees. For example, at HealthWise, the account­
ing department tracks all sales, payments, and transfers of 
funds. It also produces reports detailing the financial condition 
of the company.
 • Marketing plans, prices, promotes, sells, and distributes the 
organization’s goods and services. At HealthWise, goods 
include a wide range of products related to sports and other 
types of physical activity.
 • Human resources focuses on people—hiring, training, promot­
ing, and any number of other human-centered activities within 
the organization. At HealthWise, human resources is respon­
sible for implementing a new benefits package, for hiring new 
skilled workers, and much more.
 • Production actually creates finished goods and services using 
raw materials and personnel. At HealthWise, this includes man­
ufacturing a variety of sports equipment, including yoga mats.
 • Research identifies, investigates, and develops new products 
and services. For example, at HealthWise, scientists are inves­
tigating a light, inexpensive alloy for a new line of weight-
training equipment.

marketing develops long-term marketing
strategies to introduce newly developed products.
Middle managers are responsible for tactical
planning. At HealthWise, regional sales managers
set sales goals, monitor progress to meet goals,
and initiate corrective action as needed.
Managerial levels
Supervisors are responsible for operational
matters. At HealthWise, a production supervisor
monitors the inventory for parts and reorders
when low.
256	 chapter 10
Although the titles may vary, nearly every large and small organization has depart­
ments that perform these basic functions. Whatever your job in an organization, it is 
likely to be in one of these functional areas.
Management Levels
Most people who work in an organization are not managers, of course. At the base of 
the organizational pyramid are the assemblers, painters, welders, drivers, and so on. 
These people produce goods and services. Above them are various levels of managers—
people with titles such as supervisor, director, regional manager, and vice president. 
These are the people who do the planning, leading, organizing, and controlling ­necessary 
to see that the work gets done.
At HealthWise, for example, the northwest district sales manager directs and coor­
dinates all the salespeople in her area. Other job titles might be vice president of mar­
keting, director of human resources, or production manager. In smaller organizations, 
these titles are often combined.
Management in many organizations is divided into three levels. These levels are 
supervisors, middle management, and top management. (See Figure 10-3.)
 • Supervisors: Supervisors manage and monitor the employees or workers. 
Thus, these managers have responsibility relating to operational matters. 
They monitor day-to-day events and immediately take corrective action, if 
necessary.
 • Middle management: Middle-level managers deal with control, planning (also called 
tactical planning), and decision making. They implement the long-term goals of the 
organization.
 • Top management: Top-level managers are concerned with long-range planning 
(also called strategic planning). They need information that will help them plan the 
future growth and direction of the organization.

Top managerial-level information ﬂow is vertical,

marketing communicates vertically (with regional sales
managers), horizontally (with other vice presidents), and

Information ﬂow
Middle managerial-level information ﬂow is vertical
and horizontal. At HealthWise, regional sales managers
communicate vertically (with district sales managers and the
vice president of marketing) and horizontally with other
middle-level managers.
Supervisory-level information ﬂow is primarily
vertical. At HealthWise, production supervisors monitor
worker activities to ensure smooth production. They
provide daily status reports to middle-level production
managers.
Figure 10-4  Supervisors monitor day-to-day events
	
Information Systems	 257
Information Flow
Each level of management has different information needs. 
Top-level managers need summary information describing 
the overall operations of the business. They also need infor­
mation from outside the organization because top-level 
managers need to forecast and plan for long-range events. 
Middle-level managers need summarized information—
weekly or monthly reports. They need to develop budget 
projections and to evaluate the performance of supervisors. 
Supervisors need detailed, very current, day-to-day infor­
mation on their units so that they can keep operations run­
ning smoothly. (See Figure 10-4.)
To support these different needs, information flows in 
different directions. (See Figure 10-5.) For top-level manag­
ers, the flow of information from within the organization is 
both vertical and horizontal. The top-level managers, such 
as the chief executive officer (CEO), need information from 
below and from all departments. They also need informa­
tion from outside the organization. For example, at HealthWise, they are deciding 
whether to introduce a line of fitness trackers in the southwestern United States. The 
vice president of marketing must look at relevant data. Such data might include the 
number of people currently using the HealthWise fitness app and census data about 
the number of young people. It also might include sales histories on related fitness 
monitoring equipment.
For middle-level managers, the information flow is both vertical and horizontal 
across functional lines. For example, the regional sales managers at HealthWise set their 
sales goals by coordinating with middle managers in the production department. They 
are able to tell sales managers what products will be produced, how many, and when. 
The regional sales managers also must coordinate with the strategic goals set by the top 
managers. They must set and monitor the sales goals for the supervisors beneath them.

258	 chapter 10
For supervisory managers, information flow is primarily vertical. That is, supervi­
sors communicate mainly with their middle managers and with the workers beneath 
them. For instance, at HealthWise, production supervisors rarely communicate with 
people in the accounting department. However, they are constantly communicating 
with production-line workers and with their own managers.
Now we know how many organizations are structured and how information flows 
within the organization. But how is a computer-based information system likely to be 
set up to support its needs? And what do you need to know to use it?
Computer-Based Information Systems
Almost all organizations have computer-based information systems. Large organiza­
tions typically have formal names for the systems designed to collect and use the data. 
Although different organizations may use different names, the most common names 
are transaction processing, management information, decision support, and executive 
support systems. (See Figure 10-6.)
 • Transaction processing system: The transaction processing system (TPS) records 
day-to-day transactions, such as customer orders, bills, inventory levels, and pro­
duction output. The TPS helps supervisors by generating databases that act as the 
foundation for the other information systems.
 • Management information system: The management information system (MIS) 
summarizes the detailed data of the transaction processing system in standard 
reports for middle-level managers. Such reports might include weekly sales and 
production schedules.
 • Decision support system: The decision support system (DSS) provides a flexible 
tool for analysis. The DSS helps middle-level managers and others in the organi­
zation analyze a wide range of problems, such as the effect of events and trends 
outside the organization. Like the MIS, the DSS draws on the detailed data of the 
transaction processing system.
 • Executive support system: The executive support system (ESS), also known as the 
executive information system (EIS), is an easy-to-use system that presents infor­
mation in a very highly summarized form. It helps top-level managers oversee the 
company’s operations and develop strategic plans. The ESS combines the databases 
generated from the TPS and the reports generated from the MIS with external data.

Figure 10-6  Types of computer-based information systems

TPS
Executive support systems (ESSs) use internal data from
MIS and TPS and external data to support top-level managers.
At HealthWise, the marketing vice president uses his ESS to view
current marketing operations and to develop long-term marketing
strategies.
Decision support systems (DSSs) use data from TPS and
a set of ﬂexible analytical tools to support middle managers. At
HealthWise, the regional sales managers use the DSS to evaluate
the impact of a recent national promotion campaign on regional
sales and corporate proﬁt.
Management information systems (MISs) use data
from the TPS to support middle-level managers. At HealthWise,
regional sales managers use their MIS reports to monitor weekly
divisional sales and to compare actual sales to established sales
goals.
Transaction processing systems (TPSs) record
day-to-day transactions to support supervisors. At HealthWise,
production supervisors use their TPS to record and to monitor
current inventory levels and production-line output.

Transaction Processing Systems
A transaction processing system (TPS) helps an organization keep track of routine oper­
ations and records these events in a database. For this reason, some firms call this the 
data processing system (DPS). The data from operations—for example, customer orders 
for HealthWise’s products—makes up a database that records the transactions of the 
company. This database of transactions is used to support the MIS, DSS, and ESS.
One of the most essential transaction processing systems for any organization is in 
the accounting area. (See Figure 10-7.) Every accounting department handles six basic 
activities. Five of these are sales order processing, accounts receivable, inventory and 
purchasing, accounts payable, and payroll. All of these are recorded in the general 
ledger, the sixth activity.
Let us take a look at these six activities. They will make up the basis of the account­
ing system for almost any organization you might work in.

What is the purpose of a transaction processing system?
Describe the six activities of a TPS for accounting.
Other than TPS for accounting, describe three other TPSs.
260	 chapter 10
 • The sales order processing activity records the customer requests for the 
company’s products or services. At HealthWise when an order comes 
in—a request for a set of barbells, for example—the warehouse is alerted to 
ship a product.
 • The accounts receivable activity records money received from or owed by custom­
ers. HealthWise keeps track of bills paid by sporting goods stores and by gyms 
and health clubs to which it sells directly.
 • The parts and finished goods that the company has in stock are called inventory. 
At HealthWise this would include all exercise machines, footballs, soccer balls, 
and yoga mats ready for sale in the warehouse. (See Figure 10-8.) An inventory 
control system keeps records of the number of each kind of part or finished good 
in the warehouse.
Purchasing is the buying of materials and services. Often a purchase order is 
used. This is a form that shows the name of the company supplying the material 
or service and what is being purchased.
 • Accounts payable refers to money the company owes its suppliers for materials 
and services it has received. At HealthWise this would include materials such as 
steel and aluminum used to manufacture its exercise equipment.
 • The payroll activity is concerned with calculating employee paychecks. Amounts 
are generally determined by the pay rate, hours worked, and deductions (such 
as taxes, Social Security, medical insurance). Paychecks may be calculated from 
employee time cards or, in some cases, supervisors’ time sheets.
 • The general ledger keeps track of all summaries of all the foregoing transactions. 
A typical general ledger system can produce income statements and balance 
sheets. Income statements show a com­
pany’s financial performance—income, 
expenses, and the difference between 
them for a specific time period. Balance 
sheets list the overall financial condi­
tion of an organization. They include 
assets (for example, buildings and prop­
erty owned), liabilities (debts), and how 
much of the organization (the equity) is 
owned by the owners.
There are many other transaction pro­
cessing systems that you come into contact 
with every day. These include automatic 
teller machines, which record cash with­
drawals; online registration systems, which 
track student enrollments; and supermar­
ket discount cards, which track customer 
purchases.

Management Information Systems
A management information system (MIS) is a computer-based information sys­
tem that produces standardized reports in summarized structured form. (See 
Figure 10-9.) It is used to support 
middle managers. An MIS dif­
fers from a transaction process­
ing system in a significant way. 
Whereas a transaction process­
ing system creates databases, an 
MIS uses databases. Indeed, an 
MIS can draw from the databases 
of several departments. Thus, an 
MIS requires a database manage­
ment system that integrates the 
databases of the different depart­
ments. Middle managers often 
need summary data drawn from 
across different functional areas.
An MIS produces reports that 
are predetermined. That is, they 
follow a predetermined format and 
always show the same kinds of content. Although reports may differ from one industry 
to another, there are three common categories of reports: periodic, exception, and 
demand.
 • Periodic reports are produced at regular intervals—weekly, monthly, or quar­
terly, for instance. Examples are HealthWise’s monthly sales and production 
reports. The sales reports from district sales managers are combined into a 
monthly report for the regional sales managers. For comparison purposes, 
a regional manager is also able to see the sales reports of other regional 
managers.
 • Exception reports call attention to unusual events. An example is a sales report 
that shows that certain items are selling significantly above or below marketing 
department forecasts. For instance, if fewer exercise bicycles are selling than were 
predicted for the northwest sales region, the regional manager will receive an 
exception report. That report may be used to alert the district managers and 
salespeople to give this product more attention.
 • The opposite of a periodic report, a demand report is produced on request. 
An example is a report on the numbers and types of jobs held by women and 
minorities. Such a report is not needed periodically, but it may be required when 
requested by the U.S. government. At HealthWise, many government contracts 
require this information. It is used to certify that HealthWise is within certain 
government equal-opportunity guidelines.

support system query results

262	 chapter 10
Decision Support Systems
Managers often must deal with unanticipated questions. For example, the Health-
Wise manager in charge of manufacturing might ask how an anticipated labor strike 
would affect production schedules. A decision support system (DSS) enables manag­
ers to get answers to such unexpected and generally nonrecurring kinds of problems.
A DSS is quite different from a transaction processing system, which simply records 
data. It is also different from a management information system, which summarizes 
data in predetermined reports. A DSS is used to analyze data. Moreover, it produces 
reports that do not have a fixed format. This makes the DSS a flexible tool for analysis.
A DSS must be easy to use—or most likely it will not be used at all. A Health­
Wise marketing manager might want to know which territories are not meeting their 
monthly sales quotas. To find out, the executive could ask or query the sales database 
for all “SALES < QUOTA.” (See Figure 10-10.)
How does a decision support system work? Essentially, it consists of four parts: the 
user, system software, data, and decision models.
 • The user could be you. In general, the user is someone who has to make decisions—a 
manager, often a middle-level manager.
 • System software is essentially the operating system—programs designed to work 
behind the scenes to handle detailed operating procedures. In order to give the 
user a good, intuitive interface, the software typically is menu- or icon-driven. 
That is, the screen presents easily understood lists of commands or icons, giving 
the user several options.
 • Data in a DSS is typically stored in a database and consists of two kinds. Internal 
data—data from within the organization—consists principally of transactions from 
the transaction processing system. External data is data gathered from outside the 
organization. Examples are data provided by marketing research firms, trade asso­
ciations, and the U.S. government (such as customer profiles, census data, and 
economic forecasts).
 • Decision models give the DSS its analytical capabilities. There are three basic 
types of decision models: strategic, tactical, and operational. Strategic ­models 
assist top-level managers in long-range planning, such as stating company

Figure 10-11  Opening screen

system
Executive Support Systems
Using a DSS requires some training. Many top managers have other people in their 
offices running DSSs and reporting their findings. Top-level executives also want 
something more concise than an MIS—something that produces very focused reports.
Executive support systems 
(ESSs) consist of sophisticated 
software that, like an MIS or a 
DSS, can present, summarize, 
and analyze data from an orga­
nization’s databases. However, 
an ESS is specifically designed 
to be easy to use. This is so that 
a top executive with little spare 
time, for example, can obtain 
essential information without 
extensive training. Thus, infor­
mation is often displayed in 
very condensed form with infor­
mative graphics.
Consider an executive sup­­
port system used by the presi­
dent of HealthWise. It is avail­­able 
on his personal computer. The 
first thing each morning, the 
president calls up the ESS on his 
display screen, as shown in Fig­
ure 10-11. Note that the screen 
gives a condensed account of 
activities in the five different areas of the company. (These are Accounting, Mar­
keting, Production, Human Resources, and Research.) On this particular morning, 
the ESS shows business in four areas proceeding smoothly. ­However, in the first 
area, Accounting, the percentage of late-paying customers—past due accounts—has 
increased by 3 percent. Three percent may not seem like much, but HealthWise 
has had a history of problems with late payers, which has left the company at times 
strapped for cash. The president decides to find out the details. To do so, he selects

objectives or planning plant locations. Tactical models help middle-level managers 
control the work of the organization, such as financial planning and sales promo­
tion planning. Operational models help lower-level managers accomplish the orga­
nization’s day-to-day activities, such as evaluating and maintaining quality control.
Some DSSs are specifically designed to support more than one or a team of decision 
makers. These systems, known as group decision support systems (GDSS), include 
tools to support group meetings and collective work.

Within moments, the dis-
play screen displays a graph 
of the past due accounts. (See 
Figure  10-12.) The status of 
today’s late payers is shown 
in red. The status of late pay-
ers at this time a year ago is 
shown in yellow. The differences 
between today and a year ago 
are significant and clearly pre-
sented. For example, approxi-
mately $60,000 was late 1 to  
10 days last year. This year, over 
$80,000 was late. The president 
knows that he must take some 
action to speed up customer 
payments. (For example, he 
might call this to the atten-
tion of the vice president of 
accounting. The vice president 
might decide to implement a 
new policy that offers discounts 
to early payers or charge higher 
interest to late payers.)
ESSs permit a firm’s top executives to gain direct access to information about the 
company’s performance. Most provide direct electronic communication links to other 
executives. In addition, some ESSs have the ability to retrieve information from data-
bases outside the company, such as business-news services. This enables a firm to watch 
for stories on competitors and stay current on relevant news events that could affect its 
business. For example, news of increased sports injuries caused by running and aerobic 
dancing, and the consequent decrease in people’s interest in these activities, might cause 
HealthWise to alter its sales and production goals for its line of fitness-related shoes.
For a summary of the different types of information systems, see Figure 10-13.

Other Information Systems
We have discussed only four information systems: TPSs 
to support lower-level managers, MISs and DSSs to sup­
port middle-level managers, and ESSs to support top-level 
managers. There are many other information systems 
to support different individuals and functions. The fast­
est growing are information systems designed to support 
information workers.
Information workers distribute, communicate, and cre­
ate information. They are the organization’s administra­
tive assistants, clerks, engineers, and scientists, to name 
a few. Some are involved with distribution and communi­
cation of information (like administrative assistants and 
clerks; see Figure  10-14). They are called data ­workers. 
Others are involved with the creation of information (like 
the engineers and scientists). They are called knowledge 
workers.
Two systems to support information workers are
 • Office automation systems: Office automation ­systems 
(OASs) are designed primarily to support data work­
ers. These systems focus on managing documents, 
communicating, and scheduling. Documents are man­
aged using word processing, web authoring, desktop 
publishing, and other image technologies. Project 
managers are programs designed to schedule, plan, 
and control project resources. Microsoft Project is the 
most widely used project manager. ­Videoconferencing 
systems are computer systems that allow people located 
at various geographic locations to communicate and 
have in-person meetings. (See 
Figure 10-15.)
 • Knowledge work systems: 
Knowledge workers use OAS 
systems. Additionally, they use 
specialized information systems 
called knowledge work systems 
(KWSs) to create information 
in their areas of expertise. 
For example, engineers in­­
volved in product design and 
manufacturing use computer-
aided design/computer-aided 
manufacturing (CAD/CAM) 
systems. (See ­Figure 10-16.) 
These KWSs consist of powerful 
personal computers running 
special programs that integrate 
the design and manufacturing 
activities. CAD/CAM is widely 
used in the manufacture of 
automobiles and other products.
Expert systems are another widely 
used knowledge work system.

Careers in IT
Information systems managers oversee the work of programmers, com­
puter specialists, systems analysts, and other computer professionals. 
They create and implement corporate computer policy and systems.
Most companies look for individuals with strong technical back­
grounds, sometimes as consultants, with a master’s degree in business. 
Employers seek individuals with strong leadership and excellent com­
munication skills. Information systems managers must be able to com­
municate with people in technical and nontechnical terms. Information 
systems management positions are often filled by individuals who have 
been consultants or managers in previous positions. Those with experi­
ence in computer and network security will be in demand as businesses 
and society continue to struggle with important security issues.
Information systems managers can expect an annual salary of 
$95,000 to $125,000. Advancement opportunities typically include 
leadership in the field.

systems, let me tell you about my career as an

Expert Systems
People who are expert in a particular area—certain kinds of med­
icine, accounting, engineering, and so on—are generally well 
paid for their specialized knowledge. Unfortunately for their cli­
ents and customers, these experts are expensive and not always 
available.
What if you were to somehow capture the knowledge of a 
human expert and make it accessible to everyone through a com­
puter program? This is exactly what is being done with expert 
systems. Expert systems, also known as knowledge-based sys­
tems, are a type of artificial intelligence that uses a database to 
provide assistance to users. This database, known as a knowl­
edge base, contains facts and rules to relate these facts distilled 
from a human expert. Users interact with an expert system by 
describing a particular situation or problem. The expert system 
takes the inputs and searches the knowledge base until a solu­
tion or recommendation is formulated.
Over the past decade, expert systems have been developed in 
areas such as medicine, geology, architecture, and nature. There 
are expert systems with such names as Oil Spill Advisor, Bird 
Species Identification, and even Midwives Assistant.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
IBM’s Watson: The Ultimate Information-
Finding Machine
Have you noticed how much information is out there, from 
books and journals in your library to the millions of articles 
on the web? Do you ever wonder how professionals man­
age to read through all that research in order to stay up to 
date in their field? Recently, as the amount of information 
increases, those professionals 
are finding it difficult to keep 
up. In the future, IBM hopes 
to change that through its 
­information-finding supercom­
puter known as Watson. Tech­
nology has been making better 
information tools, and will con­
tinue to evolve to improve our 
lives as we look to the future.
You 
may 
have 
already 
heard of Watson. In 2011, this 
computer defeated the two 
best contestants in the game 
show Jeopardy. What made 
the achievement so remark­
able was that the computer 
had to read the question, understand what was being asked, 
search through 200 million pages of text, figure out what 
the best answer would be, and then hit a buzzer before the 
other contestants to deliver the answer. It accomplished all 
these steps in about 3 seconds.
With this skill, IBM predicts that Watson could be the 
ultimate researcher, helping professionals in various indus­
tries find the information they are looking for in a matter of 
seconds. Several organizations have already “hired” Watson. 
One health care company will be using Watson to help sug­
gest options based on a patient’s unique circumstances. It 
assists physicians and nurses by looking through millions of 
pages of medical research and then quickly identifying the 
most likely diagnosis and treatment options for the patient. 
To help Watson learn more about the medical field, IBM has 
partnered with a cancer center in order to “teach” ­Watson 
how to process the massive amount of cancer-related 
research and case studies. 
In the finance field, Watson 
has recently been learning 
about the complexities of 
Wall Street, with the hopes 
that it can help financial firms 
identify risks and rewards to 
improve the advice given to 
their customers.
In the future, IBM envi­
sions Watson’s technology 
being an integral part of 
these two industries. In addi­
tion, it also sees practical 
applications in call centers 
and technical support ser­
vices. There are countless 
organizations and consumers that would all benefit if access 
to this type of information technology became widespread. 
It would transform the way all of us do research and seek 
answers for our toughest problems.
What do you think about Watson’s powerful services? Do 
you think you could one day have access to this powerful 
technology on your favorite search engine? How about at 
home? Do you believe it will be a beneficial support tool or a 
machine that threatens to take jobs away from professionals?

Information flows in an organization through functional 
areas and between management levels.
Functions
Most organizations have separate departments to perform 
five functions:
 • Accounting—tracks all financial activities and gener­
ates periodic financial statements.
 • Marketing—advertises, promotes, and sells the prod­
uct (or service).
 • Production—makes the product (or service) using 
raw materials and people to turn out finished 
goods.
 • Human resources—finds and hires people; handles 
such matters as sick leave, retirement benefits, 
evaluation, compensation, and professional 
development.
 • Research—conducts product research and 
development; monitors and troubleshoots new 
products.
Management Levels
The three basic management levels are
 • Top level—concerned with long-range planning and 
forecasting.
 • Middle level—deals with control, planning, decision 
making, and implementing long-term goals.
 • Supervisors—control operational matters, monitor 
­day-to-day events, and supervise workers.
Information Flow
Information flows within an organization in different 
directions.
 • For top-level managers, the information flow is pri­
marily upward from within the organization and into 
the organization from the outside.
 • For middle-level managers, the information flow is 
horizontal and vertical within departments.
 • For supervisors, the information flow is primarily 
vertical.

	
Information Systems	 269
To efficiently and effectively use computers within an organization, you need to understand how information flows 
through functional areas and management levels. You need to be aware of the different types of computer-based infor­
mation systems, including transaction processing systems, management information systems, decision support sys­
tems, and executive support systems.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
ESS
DSS
MIS
TPS
Transaction Processing Systems
Transaction processing systems (TPSs), sometimes called 
data processing systems (DPSs), record day-to-day transac­
tions. Accounting activities include sales order processing, 
accounts receivable, inventory and purchasing, accounts 
payable, payroll, and general ledger. General ledger is 
used to produce income statements and balance sheets.
Management Information Systems
Management information systems (MISs) produce pre­
determined reports (periodic, exception, demand).
Decision Support Systems
Decision support systems (DSSs) focus on unanticipated 
questions; consist of the user, system software, data 
(­internal and external) and decision models. Three types are 
strategic, tactical, and operational. Group ­decision ­support 
systems (GDSS) support a team of decision makers.
Executive Support Systems
Executive support systems (ESSs) are similar to MIS or 
DSS but easier to use. ESSs are designed specifically for 
top-level decision makers.
Other Information Systems
Many other systems are designed to support information 
workers who create, distribute, and communicate infor­
mation. Three such systems are
 • Office automation systems (OASs), which support 
data workers who are involved with distribution and 
communication of information. Project managers and 
­videoconferencing systems are OASs.
 • Knowledge work systems (KWSs), which support 
­knowledge workers, who create information. Many 
­engineers use computer-aided design/computer-aided 
­manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems.
 • Expert (knowledge-based) systems, which are a type 
of knowledge work system. They use knowledge bases 
to apply expert knowledge to specific user problems.
CAREERS in IT
Information systems managers oversee a variety of other 
computer professionals. Strong leadership and communi­
cation skills are required; experience as a consultant and/
or manager is desired. Salary range is $95,000 to $125,000.

Learning Objectives
After you have read this chapter, you should be able to:
	1	 Distinguish between the physical and logical views of data.
	2	 Describe how data is organized: characters, fields, records, tables, and databases.
	3	 Define key fields and how they are used to integrate data in a database.
	4	 Define and compare batch processing and real-time processing.
	5	 Describe databases, including the need for databases and database management systems (DBMSs).
	6	 Describe the five common database models: hierarchical, network, relational, multidimensional, 
and object-oriented.
	7	 Distinguish among individual, company, distributed, and commercial databases.
	8	 Describe strategic database uses and security concerns.
Giant databases are recording your every digital action, from 
credit card purchases to Facebook check-ins. These databases 
can be used to tailor advertisements to your interests, predict 
your credit score, and even assess your safety at home. In the 
future, databases with DNA records of all U.S. citizens and every 
digital activity of a city may be able to predict crime and even 
identify likely criminals.
This chapter covers the things you need to know to be prepared 
for this ever-changing digital world, including:
• Different data-organization methods—understand the sig­
nificance of relational, multidimensional, and hierarchical 
databases.
• Types of databases—identify the right database for an indi­
vidual, company, distributed, or commercial situation.

Introduction
Like a library, secondary storage is designed to store information. How is 
this stored information organized? What are databases, and why do you 
need to know anything about them?
Only a few decades ago, a computer was considered to be an island 
with only limited access to information beyond its own hard disk. Now, 
through communication networks and the Internet, individual computers 
have direct electronic access to almost unlimited sources of information.
In today’s world, almost all information is stored in databases. They are 
an important part of nearly every organization including schools, hospitals, 
and banks. To effectively compete in today’s world, you need to know how 
to find information and understand how it is stored.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand 
data fields, records, tables, and databases. You need to be aware of the 
different ways in which a database can be structured and the different 
types of databases. Also, you need to know the most important database 
uses and issues.
Hi, I’m Henry. I’m a database administrator, 
and I’d like to talk with you about databases. 
I’d also like to talk about how organizations 
are using data warehouses and data mining 
to perform complex analyses and discover 
new information.

Data
As we have discussed throughout this book, information systems consist of people, pro­
cedures, software, hardware, data, and the Internet. This chapter focuses on data, which 
can be defined as facts or observations about people, places, things, and events. More 
specifically, this chapter focuses on how databases store, organize, and use data.
Not long ago, data was limited to numbers, letters, and symbols recorded by key­
boards. Now, data is much richer and includes:
 • Audio captured, interpreted, and saved using microphones and voice recognition 
systems.
 • Music downloaded from the Internet and saved on smartphones, tablets, and 
other devices.
 • Photographs captured by digital cameras, edited by image editing software, and 
shared with others over the Internet.
 • Video captured by digital video cameras, TV tuner cards, and webcams.
There are two ways or perspectives to view data. These perspectives are the physical 
view and the logical view. The physical view focuses on the actual format and location 
of the data. As discussed in Chapter 5, data is recorded as digital bits that are typically 
grouped together into bytes that represent characters using a coding scheme such as 
Unicode. Typically, only very specialized computer professionals are concerned with the 
physical view. The other perspective, the logical view, focuses on the meaning, content, 
and context of the data. End users and most computer professionals are concerned with 
this view. They are involved with actually using the data with application programs. 
This chapter presents the logical view of data and how data is stored in databases.

	
Databases	 279
Data Organization
The first step in understanding databases is to learn how data is organized. In the logi­
cal view, data is organized into groups or categories. Each group is more complex than 
the one before. (See Figure 11-1.)
 • Character: A character is the most basic logical data element. It is a single letter, 
number, or special character, such as a punctuation mark, or a symbol, such as $.
 • Field: The next higher level is a field or group of related characters. In our example, 
Brown is in the data field for the Last Name of an employee. It consists of the indi­
vidual letters (characters) that make up the last name. A data field represents an attri­
bute (description or characteristic) of some entity (person, place, thing, or object). For 
example, an employee is an entity with many attributes, including his or her last name.
 • Record: A record is a collection of related fields. A record represents a collection 
of attributes that describe an entity. In our example, the payroll record for an 
employee consists of the data fields describing the attributes for one employee. 
These attributes are First Name, Last Name, Employee ID, and Salary.
 • Table: A table is a collection of related records. For example, the Payroll Table 
would include payroll information (records) for the employees (entities).

 • Database: A database is an integrated collection of logically related tables. For 
example, the Personnel Database would include all related employee tables includ­
ing the Payroll Table and the Benefits Table.
Key Field
Each record in a table has at least one distinctive field, called the key field. Also known 
as the primary key, this field uniquely identifies the record. Tables can be related or 
connected to other tables by common key fields.
For most employee databases, a key field is an employee identification number. Key 
fields in different tables can be used to integrate the data in a database. For example, 
in the Personnel Database, both the Payroll and the Benefits tables include the field 
Employee ID. Data from the two tables could be related by combining all records with 
the same key field (Employee ID).
Batch versus Real-Time Processing
Traditionally, data is processed in one of two ways. These are batch processing, or 
what we might call “later,” and real-time processing, or what we might call “now.” 
These two methods have been used to handle common record-keeping activities such 
as payroll and sales orders.
 • Batch processing: In batch processing, data is collected over several hours, days, 
or even weeks. It is then processed all at once as a “batch.” If you have a credit 
card, your bill probably reflects batch processing. That is, during the month, you 
buy things and charge them to your credit card. Each time you charge something, 
an electronic copy of the transaction is sent to the credit card company. At some 
point in the month, the company’s data processing department puts all those 
transactions (and those of many other customers) together and processes them at 
one time. The company then sends you a single bill totaling the amount you owe. 
(See Figure 11-2.)

 • Real-time processing: Real-time processing, also known as online processing, 
occurs when data is processed at the same time the transaction occurs. For exam­
ple, whenever you request funds at an ATM, real-time processing occurs. After 
you have provided account information and requested a specific withdrawal, the 
bank’s computer verifies that you have sufficient funds in your account. If you do, 
then the funds are dispensed to you, and the bank immediately updates the bal­
ance of your account. (See Figure 11-3.)

Databases
Many organizations have multiple files on the same subject or person. For example, a 
customer’s name and address could appear in different files within the sales depart­
ment, billing department, and credit department. This is called data redundancy. If 
the customer moves, then the address in each file must be updated. If one or more 
files are overlooked, problems will likely result. For example, a product ordered might 
be sent to the new address, but the bill might be sent to the old address. This situation 
results from a lack of data integrity.

282	 chapter 11
Moreover, data spread around in different files is not as useful. The marketing 
department, for instance, might want to offer special promotions to customers who 
order large quantities of merchandise. To identify these customers, the marketing 
department would need to obtain permission and access to files in the billing depart­
ment. It would be much more efficient if all data were in a common database. A data­
base can make the needed information available.
Need for Databases
For an organization, there are many advantages to having databases:
 • Sharing: In organizations, information from one department can be readily shared 
with others. Billing could let marketing know which customers ordered large 
quantities of merchandise.
 • Security: Users are given passwords or access only to the kind of information they 
need. Thus, the payroll department may have access to employees’ pay rates, but 
other departments would not.
 • Less data redundancy: Without a common database, individual departments 
have to create and maintain their own data, and data redundancy results. For 
example, an employee’s home address would likely appear in several files. 
Redundant data causes inefficient use of storage space and data maintenance 
problems.
 • Data integrity: When there are multiple sources of data, each source may have 
variations. A customer’s address may be listed as “Main Street” in one system 
and “Main St.” in another. With discrepancies like these, it is probable that the 
customer would be treated as two separate people.
Database Management
In order to create, modify, and gain access to a database, special software is required. 
This software is called a database management system, which is commonly abbrevi­
ated DBMS.
Some DBMSs, such as Microsoft Access, are designed specifically for personal com­
puters. Other DBMSs are designed for specialized database servers. DBMS software 
is made up of five parts or subsystems: DBMS engine, data definition, data manipulation, 
application generation, and data administration.
 • The DBMS engine provides a bridge between the logical view of the data and 
the physical view of the data. When users request data (logical perspective), 
the DBMS engine handles the details of actually locating the data (physical 
perspective).
 • The data definition subsystem defines the logical structure of the database by 
using a data dictionary or schema. This dictionary contains a description of the 
structure of data in the database. For a particular item of data, it defines the 
names used for a particular field. It defines the type of data for each field (text, 
numeric, time, graphic, audio, and video). An example of an Access data dictio­
nary form is presented in Figure 11-4.
 • The data manipulation subsystem provides tools for maintaining and analyzing 
data. Maintaining data is known as data maintenance. It involves adding 
new data, deleting old data, and editing existing data. Analysis tools support 
viewing all or selected parts of the data, querying the database, and generating 
reports. Specific tools include query-by-example and a specialized programming 
language called structured query language (SQL). (Structured query language and 
other types of programming languages will be discussed in Chapter 13.)
 • The application generation subsystem provides tools to create data entry 
forms and specialized programming languages that interface or work with 

	
Databases	 283
common and widely used programming languages such as C++ or Visual Basic. 
See Figure 11-5 for a data entry form created by the application generation subsys­
tem in Access.
 • The data administration subsystem helps to manage the overall database, includ­
ing maintaining security, providing disaster recovery support, and monitoring the 
overall performance of database operations. Larger organizations typically employ 
highly trained computer specialists, called database administrators (DBAs), to 
interact with the data administration subsystem. Additional duties of database 
administrators include determining processing rights or determining which peo­
ple have access to what kinds of data in the database.

284	 chapter 11
DBMS Structure
DBMS programs are designed to work with data that is logically structured or arranged 
in a particular way. This arrangement is known as the database model. These models 
define rules and standards for all the data in a database. For example, Microsoft Access 
is designed to work with databases using the relational data model. Five common data­
base models are hierarchical, network, relational, multidimensional, and object-oriented.
Hierarchical Database
At one time, nearly every DBMS designed for mainframes used the hierarchical data 
model. In a hierarchical database, fields or records are structured in nodes. Nodes are 
points connected like the branches of an upside-down tree. Each entry has one parent 
node, although a parent may have several child nodes. This is sometimes described as 
a one-to-many relationship. To find a particular field, you have to start at the top with 
a parent and trace down the tree to a child.
The nodes farther down the system are subordinate to the ones above, like the 
hierarchy of managers in a corporation. An example of a hierarchical database is a 
system to organize music files. (See Figure 11-6.) The parent node is the music library

for a particular user. This parent has four children, labeled “artist.” Coldplay, one of 
the children, has three children of its own. They are labeled “album.” The Greatest Hits 
album has three children, labeled “song.”
The problem with a hierarchical database is that if one parent node is deleted, so 
are all the subordinate child nodes. Moreover, a child node cannot be added unless a 
parent node is added first. The most significant limitation is the rigid structure: one 
parent only per child, and no relationships or connections between the child nodes 
themselves.
Network Database
Responding to the limitations of the hierarchical data model, network mod­
els were developed. A network database also has a hierarchical arrangement of 
nodes. However, each child node may have more than one parent node. This 
is sometimes described as a many-to-many relationship. There are additional 
­connections—called pointers—between parent nodes and child nodes. Thus, a node 
may be reached through more than one path. It may be traced down through dif­
ferent branches.
For example, a university could use this type of organization to record students 
taking classes. (See Figure 11-7.) If you trace through the logic of this organization, 
you can see that each student can have more than one teacher. Each teacher also can 
teach more than one course. Students may take more than a single course. This dem­
onstrates how the network arrangement is more flexible and in many cases more effi­
cient than the hierarchical arrangement.
Relational Database
A more flexible type of organization is the relational database. In this structure, 
there are no access paths down a hierarchy. Rather, the data elements are stored in 
different tables, each of which consists of rows and columns. A table and its data are 
called a relation.
An example of a relational database is shown in Figure 11-8. The Vehicle Owner 
Table contains license numbers, names, and addresses for all registered drivers. Within 
the table, a row is a record containing information about one driver. Each column is a 
field. The fields are License Number, Last Name, First Name, Street, City, State, and 
Zip. All related tables must have a common data item enabling information stored in 
one table to be linked with information stored in another. In this case, the three tables 
are related by the License Number field.

Police officers who stop a speeding car look up the driver’s information in the 
Department of Motor Vehicles database (Figure 11-9) using the driver’s license num­
ber. They also can check for any unpaid traffic violations in the Outstanding Cita­
tions Table. Finally, if the officers suspect that the car is stolen, they can look up what 
vehicles the driver owns in the Vehicle Table.
The most valuable feature of relational databases is their simplicity. Entries can be 
easily added, deleted, and modified. The hierarchical and 
network databases are more rigid. The relational organi­
zation is common for personal computer DBMSs such as 
Access. Relational databases are also widely used for main­
frame and midrange systems.
Multidimensional Database
The multidimensional data model is a variation and an 
extension of the relational data model. While relational 
databases use tables consisting of rows and columns, mul­
tidimensional databases extend this two-dimensional data 
model to include additional or multiple dimensions, some­
times called a data cube. Data can be viewed as a cube hav­
ing three or more sides and consisting of cells. Each side of 
the cube is considered a dimension of the data. In this way, 
complex relationships between data can be represented 
and efficiently analyzed.

Databases	 287
Multidimensional databases provide several advantages over relational databases. 
Two of the most significant advantages are
 • Conceptualization. Multidimensional databases and data cubes provide users with 
an intuitive model in which complex data and relationships can be conceptualized.
 • Processing speed. Analyzing and querying a large multidimensional database 
can be much faster. For example, a query requiring just a few seconds on a multi­
dimensional database could take minutes or hours to perform on a relational 
database.
Object-Oriented Database
The other data structures are primarily designed to handle structured data such as 
names, addresses, pay rates, and so on. Object-oriented databases are more flexible 
and store data as well as instructions to manipulate the data. Additionally, this struc­
ture is ideally designed to provide input for object-oriented software development, 
which is described in Chapter 13.
Object-oriented databases organize data using classes, objects, attributes, and 
methods.
 • Classes are general definitions.
 • Objects are specific instances of a class that can contain both data and instruc­
tions to manipulate the data.
 • Attributes are the data fields an object possesses.
 • Methods are instructions for retrieving or manipulating attribute values.
For example, a health club might use an object-oriented employment database. (See 
Figure 11-10.) The database uses a class, Employee, to define employee objects that are 
stored in the database. This definition includes the attributes First name, Last name, 
Address, and Wage and the method Pay. Bob, Sarah, and Omar are objects each with 
specific attribute values. For example, the object Bob has the stored values Bob, Larson, 
191 Main St., 18. While hierarchical and network databases are still widely used, the 
relational, multidimensional, and object-oriented data models are more popular today.
For a summary of DBMS organization, see Figure 11-11.

Types of Databases
Databases may be small or large, limited in accessibility or widely accessible. Data­
bases may be classified into four types: individual, company, distributed, and commercial.
Individual
The individual database is also called a personal computer database. It is a collection 
of integrated files primarily used by just one person. Typically, the data and the DBMS 
are under the direct control of the user. They are stored either on the user’s hard-disk 
drive or on a LAN file server.
There may be many times in your life when you will find this kind of database 
valuable. If you are in sales, for instance, a personal computer database can be used to 
keep track of your customers. If you are a sales manager, you can keep track of your 
salespeople and their performance. If you are an advertising account executive, you 
can keep track of your different projects and how many hours to charge each client.
Company
Companies, of course, create databases for their own use. The company database may 
be stored on a central database server and managed by a database administrator. Users 
throughout the company have access to the database through their personal comput­
ers linked to local or wide area networks.
As we discussed in Chapter 10, company databases are the foundation for man­
agement information systems. For instance, a department store can record all sales 
transactions in the database. A sales manager can use this information to see which 
salespeople are selling the most products. The manager can then determine year-end 
sales bonuses. Or the store’s buyer can learn which products are selling well or not 
selling and make adjustments when reordering. A top executive might combine over­
all store sales trends with information from outside databases about consumer and 
population trends. This information could be used to change the whole merchandis­
ing strategy of the store.

Databases	 289
Distributed
Many times the data in a company is stored not in just one location but in several loca­
tions. It is made accessible through a variety of communications networks. The data­
base, then, is a distributed database. That is, not all the data in a database is physically 
located in one place. Typically, database servers on a client/server network provide the 
link between the data.
For instance, some database information can be at regional offices. Some can be at 
company headquarters, some down the hall from you, and some even overseas. Sales 
figures for a chain of department stores, then, could be located at the various stores. 
But executives at district offices or at the chain’s headquarters could have access to all 
these figures.
Commercial
A commercial database is generally an enormous database that an organization 
develops to cover particular subjects. It offers access to this database to the public or 
selected outside individuals for a fee. Sometimes commercial databases also are called 
information utilities or data banks. An example is LexisNexis, which offers a variety 
of information-gathering and reporting services. (See Figure 11-12.)
Some of the most widely used commercial databases are:
 • Dialog Information Services—offers business information, as well as technical and 
scientific information.
 • Dow Jones Interactive Publishing—provides world news and information on busi­
ness, investments, and stocks.
 • LexisNexis—offers news and information on legal news, public records, and busi­
ness issues.
Most of the commercial databases are designed for organizational as well as indi­
vidual use. Organizations typically pay a membership fee plus hourly use fees. Often, 
individuals are able to search the database to obtain a summary of available information 
without charge. They pay only for those items selected for further investigation.
See Figure 11-13 for a summary of the four types of databases.

Database Uses and Issues
Databases offer great opportunities for productivity. In fact, in corporate libraries, 
electronic databases are now considered more valuable than books and journals. 
However, maintaining databases means users must make constant efforts to keep 
them from being tampered with or misused.
Strategic Uses
Databases help users to keep up to date and to plan for the future. To support the 
needs of managers and other business professionals, many organizations collect data 
from a variety of internal and external databases. This data is then stored in a special 
type of database called a data warehouse. A technique called data mining is often used 
to search these databases to look for related information and patterns.
There are hundreds of databases available to help users with both general and spe­
cific business purposes, including
 • Business directories providing addresses, financial and marketing information, 
products, and trade and brand names.
 • Demographic data, such as county and city statistics, current estimates on popula­
tion and income, employment statistics, census data, and so on.
 • Business statistical information, such as financial information on publicly traded 
companies, market potential of certain retail stores, and other business data and 
information.
 • Text databases providing articles from business publications, press releases, reviews 
on companies and products, and so on.
 • Web databases covering a wide range of topics, including all of the above. As men­
tioned earlier, web search sites like Google maintain extensive databases of avail­
able Internet content.
Security
Precisely because databases are so valuable, their security has become a critical 
issue. As we discussed in Chapter 9, there are several database security concerns. 
One concern is that personal and private information about people stored in

databases may be used for the wrong purposes. For instance, a person’s credit history 
or medical records might be used to make hiring or promotion decisions. Another 
concern is unauthorized users gaining access to a database. For example, there have 
been numerous instances in which a computer virus has been launched into a data­
base or network.
Security may require putting guards in company computer rooms and checking the 
identification of everyone admitted. Some security systems electronically check fin­
gerprints. (See Figure 11-14.) Security is particularly important to organizations using 
WANs. Violations can occur without actually entering secured areas. As mentioned in 
previous chapters, most major corporations today use special hardware and software 
called firewalls to control access to their internal networks.

Careers in IT
Database administrators use database management software to deter­
mine the most efficient ways to organize and access a company’s data. 
Additionally, database administrators are typically responsible for 
maintaining database security and backing up the system. Database 
administration is a fast-growing industry and substantial job growth is 
expected.
Database administrator positions normally require a bachelor’s 
degree in computer science or information systems and technical 
experience. Internships and prior experience with the latest tech­
nology are a considerable advantage for those seeking jobs in this 
industry. It is possible to transfer skills learned in one industry, such 
as finance, to a new career in database administration. In order to 
accomplish this objective, many people seek additional training in 
computer science.
Database administrators can expect to earn an annual salary of 
$76,000 to $98,000. Opportunities for advancement include positions 
as a chief technology officer or other managerial opportunities.
Now that you have learned about databases, 
let me tell you about my career as a database 
administrator.

A LOOK TO THE FUTURE
The Future of Crime Databases
Have you ever imagined a world without violent crime? 
What would you be willing to do (or give up) if your govern­
ment could guarantee that all potential criminals could be 
stopped before they commit their crime? Recently, we are 
close to making this possible through large and powerful 
databases, along with computer programs that can analyze 
data and make predictions. The tricky part is that the data­
bases require a significant amount of personal information 
from everyone who lives in 
the country. Technology has 
been making better crime 
databases, and will continue 
to evolve to improve our lives 
as we look to the future.
Currently, national crime 
databases in several coun­
tries, such as the United 
States, focus on keeping data 
about individuals that have 
committed crimes. Not only 
do these databases contain 
basic information such as 
name and date of birth, they 
also contain fingerprints, pho­
tos, and even DNA samples. 
This makes it easier to figure 
out who committed a crime 
after it happens, assuming 
the criminal is already in the 
database. Although the offender will eventually be caught, it 
is too late for the innocent victim. For this reason, research­
ers are currently looking into the possibility of expanding the 
collection of data and then using powerful programs to fig­
ure out who is capable of committing violent crimes in the 
future.
Over the last few years, various research institutions 
have been looking into patterns that could predict criminal 
behavior. They analyze data ranging from childhood abuse to 
current employment status. Their goal is to find a combina­
tion of factors that usually leads to violent, criminal behavior. 
Other researchers are looking deep into human DNA, look­
ing for any sequences that could be connected to antisocial 
or violent behavior. If such patterns could be found, then all 
we need to do is find the individuals who have these char­
acteristics. The problem is that not all these individuals have 
an entry in the national crime database. Furthermore, these 
databases do not contain data about every aspect of a per­
son’s life. That, however, could change.
Over the years, criminal databases have been expand­
ing. However, in the United States, each state has the ability 
to determine the data to be collected and from whom it will 
be collected. While one state 
might take a DNA sample from 
only violent criminals and sex 
offenders, another state might 
collect that data from someone 
who committed a misdemeanor. 
If a future crime database is to 
make predictions, law enforce­
ment will have to take DNA 
samples from every person 
living in the United States. 
Furthermore, the government 
will need access to all data­
bases that contain information 
about that person—including 
databases from schools, busi­
nesses, 
insur­ance 
compa­
nies, and medical practices. 
Only then can these future 
programs be able to predict 
which individuals have the sort 
of patterns that may lead to 
future criminal behavior. Once those individuals are spotted, 
law enforcement could be authorized to monitor them closely 
or perhaps even intervene with psychological or medical 
assistance.
Supposing a crime-predicting program could be devel­
oped, there will be legal challenges to the type of data collec­
tion required. Individuals will be asked to weigh their privacy 
against the possibility of reducing crime. Inevitably, our trust 
of the government will also come into play. What do you 
think about this sort of future database? Would you trust the 
government with all this personal and biological information? 
Do you believe it is worth giving up privacy for the sake of 
having security?

Data is organized by the following groups:
 • Character—the most basic logical element, consisting 
of individual numbers, letters, and special characters.
 • Field—next level, consisting of a set of related charac­
ters, for example, a person’s last name. A data field 
represents an attribute (description or characteristic) 
of some entity (person, place, thing, or object).
 • Record—a collection of related fields; for example, a 
payroll record consisting of fields of data relating to 
one employee.
 • Table—a collection of related records; for example, a 
payroll table consisting of all the employee records.
 • Database—an integrated collection of related tables; 
for example, a personnel database contains all related 
employee tables.
Key Field
A key field (primary key) is the field in a record that 
uniquely identifies each record.
 • Tables can be related (connected) to other tables by 
key fields.
 • Key fields in different files can be used to integrate the 
data in a database.
 • Common key fields are employee ID numbers and 
driver’s license numbers.

Batch versus Real-Time Processing
Traditionally, data is processed in one of two ways: batch 
or real-time processing.
 • Batch processing—data is collected over time and then 
processed later all at one time (batched). For example, 
monthly credit card bills are typically created by pro­
cessing credit card purchases throughout the past 
month.
 • Real-time processing (online processing)—data is pro­
cessed at the same time the transaction occurs; direct 
access storage devices make real-time processing pos­
sible. For example, a request for cash using an ATM 
machine initiates a verification of funds, approval or 
disapproval, disbursement of cash, and an update of 
the account balance.

To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand data fields, records, tables, and databases. You 
need to be aware of the different ways in which a database can be structured and the different types of databases. Also, 
you need to know the most important database uses and issues.
DBMS STRUCTURE
DATABASES
A database is a collection of integrated data—logically 
related files and records.
Need for Databases
Advantages of databases are sharing data, improved 
security, reduced data redundancy, and higher data 
integrity.
Database Management
A database management system (DBMS) is the software 
for creating, modifying, and gaining access to the data­
base. A DBMS consists of five subsystems:
 • DBMS engine provides a bridge between logical and 
physical data views.
 • Data definition subsystem defines the logical 
structure of a database using a data dictionary or 
schema.
 • Data manipulation subsystem provides tools for 
data maintenance and data analysis; tools include 
query-by-example and structured query language 
(SQL).
 • Application generation subsystem provides tools for 
creating data entry forms with specialized program­
ming languages.
 • Data administration subsystem manages the data-
base; database administrators (DBAs) are computer 
professionals who help define processing rights.

DBMS programs are designed to work with specific data 
structures or database models. These models define rules 
and standards for all the data in the database. Five prin­
cipal database models are hierarchical, network, relational, 
multidimensional, and object-oriented.
Hierarchical Database
Hierarchical database uses nodes to link and structure 
fields and records; entries may have one parent node with 
several child nodes in a one-to-many relationship.
Network Database
Network database is like hierarchical except a child node 
may have more than one parent in a many-to-many rela­
tionship; additional connections are called pointers.
Relational Database
Relational database data is stored in tables (relations); 
related tables must have a common data item (key field). 
A table and its data are called a relation.

TYPES OF DATABASES
Multidimensional Database
Multidimensional databases extend two-dimensional 
relational tables to three or more dimensions, sometimes 
called a data cube.
Multidimensional databases offer more flexible struc­
tures than relational databases, providing a more intuitive 
way of modeling data.
Object-Oriented Database
Object-oriented databases store data, instructions, and 
unstructured data. Data is organized using classes, objects, 
attributes, and methods.
 • Classes are general definitions.
 • Objects are specific instances of a class that can con­
tain both data and instructions to manipulate the data.
 • Attributes are the data fields an object possesses.
 • Methods are instructions for retrieving or manipulat­
ing attribute values.

There are four types of databases:
 • Individual (personal computer) database: Used by one 
person.
 • Company database: Stored on central server; accessed 
by multiple people.
 • Distributed database: Spread out geographically; 
accessed by communications links.
 • Commercial databases (information utilities and data 
banks): Enormous; for particular subjects.
DATABASE USES AND ISSUES
Databases offer a great opportunity for increased produc­
tivity; however, security is always a concern.
Strategic Uses
Data warehouses support data mining. Data mining is 
a technique for searching and exploring databases for 
related information and patterns.
Security
Two important security concerns are illegal use of data 
and unauthorized access. Most organizations use fire­
walls to protect their internal networks.
CAREERS in IT
Database administrators use database management soft­
ware to determine the most efficient ways to organize and 
access a company’s data. They are also responsible for 
database security and system backup. A bachelor’s degree 
in computer science or information systems and techni­
cal experience are required. Salary range is $76,000 to 
$98,000.

Learning Objectives
After you have read this chapter, you should be able to:
	1	 Describe the six phases of the systems life cycle.
	2	 Identify information needs and formulate possible solutions.
	3	 Analyze existing information systems and evaluate the feasibility of alternative systems.
	4	 Identify, acquire, and test new system software and hardware.
	5	 Switch from an existing information system to a new one with minimal risk.
	6	 Perform system audits and periodic evaluations.
	7	 Describe prototyping and rapid applications development.
When an organization designs and implements a new sys­
tem, jobs are on the line. A well-designed system can make a 
career; a poor one can destroy a company. Systems analysis 
and design details the framework for creating new systems. 
In the future, information systems will rely on cloud-based 
services, giving easier upgrades, improved security, and 
higher reliability.
This chapter covers the things you need to know to be 
prepared for this ever-changing digital world, including:
• The systems life cycle—understand the phases of infor­
mation systems development and avoid confusion, mis­
steps, and inefficiency.
• Prototyping and rapid development—learn the newest 
alternatives to the systems life cycle to respond quickly 
and effectively to unexpected systems design challenges.
Why should I read this chapter?

Introduction
Most people in an organization are involved with an information system 
of some kind. For an organization to create and effectively use a system 
requires considerable thought and effort. Fortunately, there is a six-step 
process for accomplishing this. It is known as systems analysis and design.
Big organizations can make big mistakes. For example, a large automobile 
manufacturer once spent $40 billion putting in factory robots and other high 
technology in its automaking plants. Unfortunately, the manufacturer could 
never make these new changes work and removed much of the equipment 
and reinstalled its original production systems. Why did the high-tech pro­
duction systems fail? The probable reason was that not enough energy was 
devoted to training its workforce in using the new systems.
The government also can make big mistakes. In one year, the Inter­
nal Revenue Service computer system was so overwhelmed it could not 
deliver tax refunds on time. How did this happen? Despite extensive test­
ing of much of the system, not all testing was completed. Thus, when the 
new system was phased in, the IRS found it could not process tax returns 
as quickly as it had hoped.
Both of these examples show the necessity for thorough planning—
especially when an organization is trying to implement a new kind of 
system. Systems analysis and design reduces the chances for such spec­
tacular failures.
To efficiently and effectly use computers, you need to understand the 
importance of systems analysis and design. You need to be aware of the 
relationship of an organization’s chart to its managerial structure. Addi­
tionally, you need to know the six phases of the systems development life 
cycle: preliminary investigation, systems analysis, systems design, systems 
development, systems implementation, and systems maintenance.
Hi, I’m Nicole, and I’m a systems analyst. 
I’d like to talk with you about analyzing 
and designing information systems for 
organizations.

Systems Analysis and Design
We described different types of information systems in the last chapter. Now let us 
consider: What, exactly, is a system? We can define it as a collection of activities and 
elements organized to accomplish a goal. As we saw in Chapter 10, an information 
­system is a collection of hardware, software, people, procedures, data, and the Inter­
net. These work together to provide information essential to running an organization. 
This information helps produce a product or service and, for profit-oriented busi­
nesses, derive a profit.
Information about orders received, products shipped, money owed, and so on, 
flows into an organization from the outside. Information about what supplies have 
been received, which customers have paid their bills, and so on, also flows within the 
organization. To avoid confusion, the flow of information must follow a route that is 
defined by a set of rules and procedures. However, from time to time, organizations 
need to change their information systems. Reasons include organizational growth, 
mergers and acquisitions, new marketing opportunities, revisions in governmental 
regulations, and availability of new technology.

Systems Analysis and Design 	 305
Systems analysis and design is a six-phase 
problem-solving procedure for examining and 
improving an information system. The six phases 
make up the systems life cycle. (See Figure 12-1.) 
The phases are as follows:
	1.	 Preliminary investigation: The organization’s 
problems or needs are identified and summa­
rized in a short report.
	2.	Systems analysis: The present system is stud­
ied in depth. New requirements are specified 
and documented.
	3.	Systems design: A new or alternative informa­
tion system is designed and a design report 
created.
	4.	Systems development: New hardware and soft­
ware are acquired, developed, and tested.
	5.	Systems implementation: The new information 
system is installed, and people are trained to 
use it.
	6.	Systems maintenance: In this ongoing phase, 
the system is periodically evaluated and 
updated as needed.
In organizations, this six-phase systems life cycle is used by computer profes­
sionals known as systems analysts. These people study an organization’s systems 
to determine what actions to take and how to use computer technology to assist 
them.
As an end user, working alone or with a systems analyst, it is important that 
you understand how the systems life cycle works. In fact, you may have to use the 
procedure.
More and more end users are developing their own information systems. This 
is because in many organizations there is a three-year backlog of work for sys­
tems analysts. For instance, suppose you recognize that there is a need for cer­
tain information within your organization. Obtaining this information will require 
the introduction of new hardware and software. You go to seek expert help from 
­systems analysts in studying these information needs. At that point you discover 
that the systems analysts are so overworked it will take them three years to get 
to your request! You can see, then, why many managers are learning to do these 
activities themselves.
In any case, learning the six steps described in this chapter will raise your computer 
efficiency and effectiveness. It also will give you skills to solve a wide range of prob­
lems. These skills can make you more valuable to an organization.

Phase 1: Preliminary Investigation
The first phase of the systems life cycle is a preliminary investigation of a proposed 
project to determine the need for a new information system. This usually is requested 
by an end user or a manager who wants something done that is not presently being 
done. For example, suppose you work for Advantage Advertising, a fast-growing 
advertising agency. Advantage Advertising produces a variety of different ads for a 
wide range of different clients. The agency employs both regular staff workers and on-
call freelancers. One of your responsibilities is keeping track of the work performed 
for each client and the employees who performed the work. In addition, you are 
responsible for tabulating the final bill for each project.
How do you figure out how to charge which clients for which work done by which 
employees? This kind of problem is common to many service organizations (such as 
lawyers’ and contractors’ offices). Indeed, it is a problem in any organization where 
people charge for their time and clients need proof of hours worked.
In Phase 1, the systems analyst—or the end user—is concerned with three tasks: 
(1) briefly defining the problem, (2) suggesting alternative solutions, and (3) preparing 
a short report. (See Figure 12-2.) This report will help management decide whether 
to pursue the project further. (If you are an end user, you may not produce a written 
report. Rather, you might report your findings directly to your supervisor.)
Defining the Problem
Defining the problem means examining whatever current information system is in 
use. Determining what information is needed, by whom, when, and why is accom­
plished by interviewing and making observations. If the information system is large, 
this survey is done by a systems analyst. If the system is small, the survey can be done 
by the end user.
For example, suppose Advantage Advertising account executives, copywrit­
ers, and graphic artists currently record the time spent on different jobs on their 
desk calendars. (Examples might be “Client A, telephone conference, 15 minutes”; 
“Client B, design layout, 2 hours.”) After interviewing several account executives

Systems Analysis and Design 	 307
and listening to their frustrations, it becomes clear 
that the approach is somewhat disorganized. (See 
Figure 12-3.) Written calendar entries are too unpro­
fessional to be shown to clients. Moreover, a large job 
often has many people working on it. It is difficult to 
pull together all their notations to make up a bill for 
the client. Some freelancers work at home, and their 
time slips are not readily available. These matters 
constitute a statement of the problem: The company 
has a manual time-and-billing system that is slow and 
difficult to use.
As an end user, you might experience difficulties 
with this system yourself. You’re in someone else’s 
office, and a telephone call comes in for you from a 
client. Your desk calendar is back in your own office. 
You have two choices. You can always carry your cal­
endar with you, or you can remember to note the 
time you spent on various tasks when you return to 
your office. The administrative assistant reporting to 
the account executive is continually after you (and everyone else at Advantage) to 
provide photocopies of your calendar. This is so that various clients can be billed 
for the work done on various jobs. Surely, you think, there must be a better way to 
handle time and billing.
Suggesting Alternative Systems
This step is simply to suggest some possible plans as alternatives to the present 
arrangement. For instance, Advantage could hire more administrative assistants 
to collect the information from everyone’s calendars (including telephoning those 
working at home). Or it could use the existing system of network-linked personal 
computers that staffers and freelancers presently use. Perhaps, you think, there 
is already some off-the-shelf packaged software available that could be used for 
a time-and-billing system. At least there might be one that would make your own 
job easier.
Preparing a Short Report
For large projects, the systems analyst writes a report summarizing the results of 
the preliminary investigation and suggesting alternative systems. The report also 
may include schedules for further development of the project. This document is pre­
sented to higher management, along with a recommendation to continue or discon­
tinue the project. Management then decides whether to finance the second phase, 
the systems analysis.
For Advantage Advertising, your report might point out that billing is frequently 
delayed. It could say that some tasks may even “slip through the cracks” and not get 
charged at all. Thus, as the analyst has noted, you suggest the project might pay for 
itself merely by eliminating lost or forgotten charges.

Phase 2: Systems Analysis
In Phase 2, systems analysis, data is collected about the present system. This data is 
then analyzed, and new requirements are determined. We are not concerned with a 
new design here, only with determining the requirements for a new system. Systems 
analysis is concerned with gathering and analyzing the data. This usually is completed 
by documenting the analysis in a report. (See Figure 12-4.)
Gathering Data
When gathering data, the systems analyst—or the end user doing systems analysis—
expands on the data gathered during Phase 1. He or she adds details about how the 
current system works. Data is obtained from observation and interviews. In addition, 
data may be obtained from questionnaires given to people using the system. Data also 
is obtained from studying documents that describe the formal lines of authority and 
standard operating procedures. One such document is the organization chart, which 
shows levels of management as well as formal lines of authority.
Analyzing the Data
In the data analysis step, the idea is to learn how information currently flows and to 
pinpoint why it isn’t flowing appropriately. The whole point of this step is to apply 
logic to the existing arrangement to see how workable it is. Many times, the current 
system is not operating correctly because prescribed procedures are not being fol­
lowed. That is, the system may not really need to be redesigned. Rather, the people in 
it may need to be shown how to follow correct procedures.
Many different tools are available to assist systems analysts and end users in the 
analysis phase. Some of the most important are the top-down analysis method, grid 
charts, system flow charts, data flow diagrams, and automated design tools.
 • Top-down analysis method: The top-down analysis method is used to identify the 
top-level components of a complex system. Each component is then broken down 
into smaller and smaller components. This approach makes each component 
easier to analyze and deal with.

Systems Analysis and Design 	 309
For instance, the systems analyst might look at the present kind 
of bill submitted to a client for a complex advertising campaign. 
The analyst might note the categories of costs—employee salaries, 
telephone and mailing charges, travel, supplies, and so on.
 • Grid charts: A grid chart shows the relationship between input 
and output documents. An example is shown in Figure 12-5 that 
indicates the relationship between the data input and the outputs.
For instance, a time sheet is one of many inputs that produces 
a particular report, such as a client’s bill. Other inputs might 
be forms having to do with telephone conferences and travel 
expenses. On a grid sheet, rows represent inputs, such as time 
sheet forms. Columns represent output documents, such as differ­
ent clients’ bills. A check mark at the intersection of a row and col­
umn means that the input document is used to create the output 
document.
 • System flowcharts: System flowcharts show the flow of input data 
to processing and finally to output, or distribution of information. 
An example of a system flowchart keeping track of time for advertis­
ing “creative people” is shown in Figure 12-6. The explanation of the 
symbols used appears in Figure 12-7. Note that this describes the 
present manual, or noncomputerized, system. (A system flowchart is 
not the same as a program flowchart, which is very detailed. Program 
flowcharts are discussed in Chapter 13.)
 • Data flow diagrams: Data flow diagrams show the data or informa­
tion flow within an information system. The data is traced from its 
origin through processing, storage, and output. An example of a data 
flow diagram is shown in Figure 12-8. The explanation of the symbols 
used appears in Figure 12-9.
 • Automated design tools: Automated design tools are software pack­
ages that evaluate hardware and software alternatives according to requirements 
given by the systems analyst. They are also called computer-aided software 
­engineering (CASE) tools. These tools are not limited to systems analysis. They are 
used in systems design and development as well. CASE tools relieve the systems 
analysts of many repetitive tasks, develop clear documentation, and, for larger 
projects, coordinate team member activities.

310	 chapter 12
Documenting Systems Analysis
In larger organizations, the systems analysis stage is typically documented in a report 
for higher management. The systems analysis report describes the current informa­
tion system, the requirements for a new system, and a possible development schedule. 
For example, at Advantage Advertising, the system flowcharts show the present flow 
of information in a manual time-and-billing system. Some boxes in the system flow­
chart might be replaced with symbols showing where a computerized information 
system could work better.
Management studies the report and decides whether to continue with the project. 
Let us assume your boss and higher management have decided to continue. You now 
move on to Phase 3, systems design.
Phase 3: Systems Design
Phase 3 is systems design. It consists of three tasks: (1) designing alternative systems, 
(2) selecting the best system, and (3) writing a systems design report. (See Figure 12-10.)
Designing Alternative Systems
In almost all instances, more than one design can be developed to meet the informa­
tion needs. Systems designers evaluate each alternative system for feasibility. By feasi­
bility we mean three things:
 • Economic feasibility: Will the costs of the new system be justified by the benefits 
it promises? How long will it take for the new system to pay for itself?

 • Technical feasibility: Are reliable hardware, software, and training available to 
make the system work? If not, can they be obtained?
 • Operational feasibility: Can the system actually be made to operate in the organi­
zation, or will people—employees, managers, clients—resist it?
Selecting the Best System
When choosing the best design, managers must consider these four questions: (1) Will 
the system work with the organization’s overall information system? (2) Will the sys­
tem be flexible enough so it can be modified in the future? (3) Can it be made secure 
against unauthorized use? (4) Are the benefits worth the costs?
For example, one aspect you have to consider at Advantage Advertising is security. 
Should freelancers and outside vendors enter data directly into a computerized time-
and-billing system, or should they keep submitting time sheets manually? In allowing 
these outside people to input information directly, are you also allowing them access 
to files they should not see? Do these files contain confidential information, perhaps 
information of value to rival advertising agencies?
Writing the Systems Design Report
The systems design report is prepared for higher management and describes the alterna­
tive designs. It presents the costs versus the benefits and outlines the effect of alter­native 
designs on the organization. It usually concludes by recommending one of the alternatives.

Phase 4: Systems Development
Phase 4 is systems development. It has three steps: (1) acquiring software, (2) acquir­
ing hardware, and (3) testing the new system. (See Figure 12-11.)
Acquiring Software
Application software for the new information system can be obtained in two ways. It 
can be purchased as off-the-shelf packaged software and possibly modified, or it can 
be custom-designed. If any of the software is being specially created, the programming 
steps we will outline in Chapter 13 should be followed.
With the systems analyst’s help, you have looked at time-and-billing packaged 
software designed for service organizations. Unfortunately, you find that none of the 
packaged software will do. Most of the packages seem to work well for one person 
(you). However, none seems to be designed for many people working together. It 
appears, then, that software will have to be custom-designed. (We discuss the process 
of developing software in Chapter 13, on programming.)
Acquiring Hardware
Some new systems may not require new computer equipment, but others will. The 
equipment needed and the places where they are to be installed must be determined. 
This is a very critical area. Switching or upgrading equipment can be a tremendously 
expensive proposition. Will a personal computer system be sufficient as a company 
grows? Are networks expandable? Will people have to undergo costly training?
The systems analyst tells you that there are several different makes and models 
of personal computers currently in use at Advantage Advertising. Fortunately, all are 
connected by a local area network to a file server that can hold the time-and-billing 
data. To maintain security, the systems analyst suggests that an electronic mailbox be 
installed for freelancers and others outside the company. They can use this electronic 
mailbox to post their time charges. Thus, it appears that existing hardware will work 
just fine.

Testing the New System
After the software and equipment have been installed, the 
system should be tested. Sample data is fed into the system. 
The processed information is then evaluated to see whether 
results are correct. Testing may take several months if the 
new system is complex.
For this step, you ask some people in Creative Services 
to test the system. (See Figure  12-12.) You observe that 
some of the people have problems knowing where to enter 
their times. To solve the problem, the software is modified 
to display an improved user entry screen. After the system 
has been thoroughly tested and revised as necessary, you 
are ready to put it into use.
Phase 5: Systems 
Implementation
Another name for Phase 5, systems implementation, is 
conversion. It is the process of changing—converting—from 
the old system to the new one and training people to use 
the new system.
Types of Conversion
There are four approaches to conversion: direct, parallel, pilot, and phased.
 • In the direct approach, the conversion is done simply by abandoning the old and 
starting up the new. This can be risky. If anything is still wrong with the new sys­
tem, the old system is no longer available to fall back on.
The direct approach is not recommended precisely because it is so risky. 
­Problems, big or small, invariably crop up in a new system. In a large system, 
a problem might just mean catastrophe.
 • In the parallel approach, old and new systems are operated side by side until the 
new one proves to be reliable.
This approach is low risk. If the new system fails, the organization can just 
switch to the old system to keep going. However, keeping enough equipment 
and people active to manage two systems at the same time can be very expensive. 
Thus, the parallel approach is used only in cases in which the cost of failure or of 
interrupted operation is great.
 • In the pilot approach, the new system is tried out in only one part of the organiza­
tion. Once the system is working smoothly in that part, it is implemented through­
out the rest of the organization.
The pilot approach is certainly less expensive than the parallel approach. It also 
is somewhat riskier. However, the risks can be controlled because problems will 
be confined to only certain areas of the organization. Difficulties will not affect the 
entire organization.

Name the two parts of the maintenance phase.

chapter 12
 • In the phased approach, the new system is implemented gradually over a period 
of time. The entire implementation process is broken down into parts or phases. 
Implementation begins with the first phase, and once it is successfully implemented, 
the second phase begins. This process continues until all phases are operating 
smoothly. Typically, this is an expensive proposition because the implementation is 
done slowly. However, it is certainly one of the least risky approaches.
In general, the pilot and phased approaches are the favored methods. Pilot is pre­
ferred when there are many people in an organization performing similar operations—
for instance, all salesclerks in a department store. Phased is more appropriate for 
organizations in which people are performing different operations.
You and the systems analyst, with top management support, have decided on a 
pilot implementation. This approach was selected in part based on cost and the avail­
ability of a representative group of users. The Creative Services department previously 
tested the system and has expressed enthusiastic support for it. A group from this 
department will pilot the implementation of the time-and-billing system.
Training
Training people is important, of course. Unfortunately, it is one of the most commonly 
overlooked activities. Some people may begin training early, even before the equip­
ment is delivered, so that they can adjust more easily. In some cases, a professional 
software trainer may be brought in to show people how to operate the system. How­
ever, at Advantage Advertising, the time-and-billing software is simple enough that 
the systems analyst can act as the trainer.
Phase 6: Systems Maintenance
After implementation comes systems maintenance, the last step in the systems life 
cycle. This phase is a very important, ongoing activity. Most organizations spend more 
time and money on this phase than on any of the others. Maintenance has two parts: 
a systems audit and a periodic evaluation.
In the systems audit, the system’s performance is compared to the original design 
specifications. This is to determine whether the new procedures are actually further­
ing productivity. If they are not, some redesign may be necessary.
After the systems audit, the new information system is further modified, if neces­
sary. All systems should be evaluated from time to time to determine whether they are 
meeting the goals and providing the service they are supposed to.
The six-step systems life cycle is summarized in Figure 12-13.

Prototyping and Rapid Applications 
Development
Is it necessary to follow every phase of the systems life 
cycle? It may be desirable, but often there is no time to do 
so. For instance, hardware may change so fast that there is 
no opportunity for evaluation, design, and testing as just 
described. Two alternative approaches that require much 
less time are prototyping and rapid applications development.
Prototyping
Prototyping means to build a model or prototype that can be 
modified before the actual system is installed. For instance, 
the systems analyst for Advantage Advertising might 
develop a proposed or prototype menu as a possible screen 
display for the time-and-billing system. Users would try it 
out and provide feedback to the systems analyst. The sys­
tems analyst would revise the prototype until the users felt 
it was ready to put into place. Typically, the development 
time for prototyping is shorter; however, it is sometimes 
more difficult to manage the project and to control costs. 
(See Figure 12-14.)
Rapid Applications Development
Rapid applications development (RAD) involves the use of powerful development 
software, small specialized teams, and highly trained personnel. For example, the sys­
tems analyst for Advantage Advertising would use specialized development software 
like CASE, form small teams consisting of select users and managers, and obtain assis­
tance from other highly qualified analysts. Although the resulting time-and-billing sys­
tem would likely cost more, the development time would be shorter and the quality of 
the completed system would be better.

Careers in IT
A systems analyst follows the steps described in the systems life cycle. 
Analysts plan and design new systems or reorganize a company’s com­
puter resources to best utilize them. Analysts follow 
the systems life cycle through all its steps: preliminary 
investigation, analysis, design, development, imple­
mentation, and maintenance.
Systems analyst positions normally require either 
an advanced associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree 
in computer science or information systems and tech­
nical experience. Internships and prior experience 
with the latest technology are a considerable advan­
tage for those seeking jobs in this industry. Systems 
analysts can expect to earn an annual salary of $50,000 
to $64,000. Opportunities for advancement include 
positions as a chief technology officer or other mana­
gerial opportunities.
Now that you have learned about systems 
analysis and design, let me tell you about my 
career as a systems analyst.

companies that offer both processing and software as a ser­
vice, rather than hosting these systems on their own.
In the future, many companies will no longer have large 
servers and database systems under their own roof. They 
will instead pay a monthly fee to a 
company, such as Amazon, that has 
large data centers that are acces­
sible via the Internet. These data 
centers offer security and reliabil­
ity, and they can grow, or scale, 
based on the needs of the busi­
ness. The systems analyst of the 
future will not have to worry about 
the hardware requirements of a 
new piece of software or database 
management system. The imple­
mentation of new systems will be 
much easier, for both the business 
and its customers. All hardware 
upgrades will now be managed by 
the company offering the cloud 
service, and the software will be 
hosted there. Of course, all this 
requires a good communications 
infrastructure—one that is being 
improved each year by telecommu­
nications companies.
What do you think about mov­
ing so many aspects of a system to the cloud? Is there a 
danger in trusting another company with your business’s 
data? Do you think cloud computing will enable a business to 
release reliable products more quickly and at a lower cost?
The Challenge of Keeping Pace
Have you noticed the speed with which new (or compet­
ing) products and services are being released? Does your 
favorite website change often to 
keep up with its competitors? Most 
observers firmly believe that the 
pace of business is accelerating. 
The time to develop a product and 
bring it to market, in many cases, 
is now months rather than years. 
Internet technologies, in particular, 
have provided tools to support the 
rapid introduction of new products 
and services. Technology has been 
making better business tools, and 
will continue to evolve to improve 
our lives as we look to the future.
To stay competitive, corpora­
tions must integrate these new 
technologies into their existing 
ways of doing business. In many 
cases, the traditional systems life 
cycle approach takes too long—
sometimes years—to develop a 
system. Many organizations are 
responding by aggressively imple­
menting prototyping and RAD. 
­Others are enlisting the services of outside consulting 
groups that specialize in systems development. However, 
many experts believe that the future of life cycle manage­
ment lies in relying on the cloud—businesses will turn to

VISUAL SUMMARY
Systems Analysis and Design
SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
A system is a collection of activities and elements orga­
nized to accomplish a goal. Systems analysis and design is 
a six-phase problem-solving procedure that makes up the 
systems life cycle. The phases are
 • Preliminary investigation—identifying organization’s 
problems or needs and summarizing in short report.
 • Systems analysis—studying present system in depth, 
specifying new requirements, and documenting 
findings.
 • Systems design—designing new or alternative sys­
tem to meet new requirements and creating a design 
report.
 • Systems development—acquiring, developing, and test­
ing needed hardware and software.
 • Systems implementation—installing new system and 
training people.
 • Systems maintenance—periodically evaluating and 
updating system as needed.
Systems analysts are the computer professionals who 
typically follow the six-phase systems life cycle.
PHASE 1: PRELIMINARY 
INVESTIGATION
The preliminary investigation determines the need for a 
new information system. It is typically requested by an 
end user or a manager. Three tasks of this phase are defin­
ing the problem, suggesting alternative systems, and pre­
paring a short report.
Defining the Problem
The current information system is examined to determine 
who needs what information, when the information is 
needed, and why it is needed.
If the existing information system is large, then a sys­
tems analyst conducts the survey. Otherwise, the end user 
conducts the survey.
Suggesting Alternative Systems
Some possible alternative systems are suggested. Based on 
interviews and observations made in defining the prob­
lem, alternative information systems are identified.
Preparing a Short Report
To document and communicate the findings of Phase 1, 
preliminary investigation, a short report is prepared and 
presented to management.

Design
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the importance of systems analysis and design. 
You need to know the six phases of the systems development life cycle: preliminary investigation, analysis, design, 
development, implementation, and maintenance. Additionally, you need to understand prototyping and RAD.
PHASE 2: SYSTEMS ANALYSIS
In systems analysis, data is collected about the present 
system. The focus is on determining the requirements 
for a new system. Three tasks of this phase are gathering 
data, analyzing the data, and documenting the analysis.
Gathering Data
Data is gathered by observation, interviews, question­
naires, and looking at documents. One helpful document 
is the organization chart, which shows a company’s func­
tions and levels of management.
Analyzing the Data
There are several tools for the analysis of data, including 
top-down analysis, grid charts, and system flowcharts.
Documenting Systems Analysis
To document and communicate the findings of Phase 2, a 
systems analysis report is prepared for higher management.
PHASE 3: SYSTEMS DESIGN
In the systems design phase, a new or alternative informa­
tion system is designed. This phase consists of three tasks:
Designing Alternative Systems
Alternative information systems are designed. Each alter­
native is evaluated for
 • Economic feasibility—cost versus benefits; time for the 
system to pay for itself.
 • Technical feasibility—hardware and software reliabil­
ity; available training.
 • Operational feasibility—will the system work within 
the organization?
Selecting the Best System
Four questions should be considered when selecting the 
best system:
 • Will the system fit into an overall information system?
 • Will the system be flexible enough to be modified as 
needed in the future?
 • Will it be secure against unauthorized use?
 • Will the system’s benefits exceed its costs?
Writing the Systems Design Report
To document and communicate the findings of Phase 3, a 
systems design report is prepared for higher management.

PHASE 4: SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT
In the systems development phase, software and hard­
ware are acquired and tested.
Acquiring Software
Two ways to acquire software are purchasing off-the-shelf 
packaged software and designing custom programs.
Acquiring Hardware
Acquiring hardware involves consideration for future 
company growth, existing networks, communication 
capabilities, and training.
Testing the New System
Using sample data, the new system is tested. This step can 
take several months for a complex system.
PHASE 5: SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTATION
Systems implementation, also known as conversion, is 
the process of changing to the new system and training 
people.
Types of Conversion
Four ways to convert are direct, parallel, pilot, and phased 
approaches.
 • Direct approach—abandoning the old system and 
starting up the new system; can be very risky and not 
recommended.
 • Parallel approach—running the old and new side 
by side until the new system proves its worth; very 
low risk; however, very expensive; not generally 
recommended.
 • Pilot approach—converting only one part of the organi­
zation to the new system until the new system proves 
its worth; less expensive but riskier than parallel 
conversion; recommended for situations with many 
people performing similar operations.
 • Phased approach—gradually implementing the new 
system to the entire organization; less risky but more 
expensive than parallel conversion; recommended 
for situations with many people performing different 
operations.
Training
Training is important, however, often overlooked. Some 
people may train early as the equipment is being delivered 
so that they can adjust more easily. Sometimes a profes­
sional trainer is used; other times the systems analyst acts 
as the trainer.

PHASE 6: SYSTEMS MAINTENANCE
Systems maintenance consists of a systems audit followed 
by periodic evaluation.
Systems Audit
Once the system is operational, the systems analyst per­
forms a systems audit by comparing the new system to its 
original design specifications.
Periodic Evaluation
The new system is periodically evaluated to ensure that it 
is operating efficiently.
PROTOTYPING AND RAD
Due to time pressures, it is not always feasible to follow 
every phase of the systems life cycle. Two alternatives that 
require less time are prototyping and RAD.
Prototyping
Prototyping means to build a model or prototype that can 
be modified before the actual system is installed. Typically, 
the development time for prototyping is shorter; however, 
it can be more difficult to manage the project and to con­
trol costs.
Rapid Applications Development
Rapid applications development (RAD) uses power­
ful development software, small specialized teams, and 
highly trained personnel. Typically, the development costs 
more. However, the time is much less and the quality is 
often better.
CAREERS in IT
Systems analysts plan and design new systems or 
re­organize a company’s computer resources to better uti­
lize them. They follow the systems life cycle through all 
its steps. Either an advanced associate’s degree or a bach­
elor’s degree in computer science or information systems 
and technical experience are required. Salary range is 
$50,000 to $64,000.

Programs and Programming
What exactly is programming? Many people think of it as simply typing words into a 
computer. That may be part of it, but that is certainly not all of it. Programming, as 
we’ve hinted before, is actually a problem-solving procedure.
What Is a Program?
To see how programming works, think about what a program is. A program is a list 
of instructions for the computer to follow to accomplish the task of processing data 
into information. The instructions are made up of statements used in a programming 
language, such as C++, Java, or Visual Basic.
You are already familiar with some types of programs. As we discussed in 
Chapters 1 and 3, application programs are widely used to accomplish a variety of 
different types of tasks. For example, we use word processors to create documents 
and spreadsheets to analyze data. These can be purchased and are referred to as 
prewritten or packaged programs. Programs also can be created or custom-made. In 
Chapter 12, we saw that the systems analyst looked into the availability of time-and-
billing software for Advantage Advertising. Will off-the-shelf software do the job, or 
should it be custom-written? This is one of the first things that needs to be decided 
in programming.
What Is Programming?
A program is a list of instructions for the computer to follow to process data. 
­Programming, also known as software development, typically follows a six-step pro­
cess known as the software development life cycle (SDLC). (See Figure 13-1.)
Introduction
In the previous chapter, we discussed systems analysis and design. We dis­
cussed the six-phase systems life cycle approach for examining and improv­
ing an information system. One of the phases is systems development, or 
the acquisition of new hardware and software. This chapter relates to this 
phase, systems development. More specifically, this chapter focuses on 
developing new software or programming. We will describe programming 
in two parts: (1) the steps in the programming process and (2) some of the 
programming languages available.
Why should you need to know anything about programming? The answer is 
simple. You might need to deal with programmers in the course of your work. 
You also may be required to do some programming yourself in the future. 
A growing trend is toward end user software development. This means that 
end users, like you, are developing their own application programs.
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the 
relationship between systems development and programming. Additionally, 
you need to know the six steps of programming, including program specifica­
tion, program design, program code, program test, program documentation, 
and program maintenance.
Hi, I’m Ray, and I’m a computer programmer. 
I’d like to talk with you about programming 
and programming languages.

What is a program?
What are the six programming steps?
	
Programming and Languages	 331
The six steps are as follows:
	1.	 Program specification: The program’s objectives, outputs, inputs, and processing 
requirements are determined.
	2.	Program design: A solution is created using programming techniques such as top-
down program design, pseudocode, flowcharts, and logic structures.
	3.	Program code: The program is written or coded using a programming language.
	4.	Program test: The program is tested or debugged by looking for syntax and logic 
errors.
	5.	Program documentation: Documentation is an ongoing process throughout the pro­
gramming process. This phase focuses on formalizing the written description and 
processes used in the program.
	6.	Program maintenance: Completed programs are periodically reviewed to evaluate 
their accuracy, efficiency, standardization, and ease of use. Changes are made to 
the program’s code as needed.
In organizations, computer professionals known as software engineers or 
­programmers use this six-step procedure. In a recent survey by Money magazine, soft­
ware engineers were ranked near the top of over 100 widely held jobs based on salary, 
prestige, and security.
You may well find yourself working directly with a programmer or indirectly 
through a systems analyst. Or you may actually do the programming for a system that 
you develop. Whatever the case, it’s important that you understand the six-step pro­
gramming procedure.

Step 1: Program Specification
Program specification is also called program definition or program analysis. 
It requires that the programmer—or you, the end user, if you are following this 
­procedure—specify five items: (1) the program’s objectives, (2) the desired output, 
(3) the input data required, (4) the processing requirements, and (5) the documenta­
tion. (See Figure 13-2.)
Program Objectives
You solve all kinds of problems every day. A problem might be deciding how to com­
mute to school or work or which homework or report to do first. Thus, every day you 
determine your objectives—the problems you are trying to solve. Programming is the 
same. You need to make a clear statement of the problem you are trying to solve. An 
example would be “I want a time-and-billing system to record the time I spend on dif­
ferent jobs for different clients of Advantage Advertising.”
Desired Output
It is best always to specify outputs before inputs. That is, you need to list what you 
want to get out of the computer system. Then you should determine what will go into it. 
The best way to do this is to draw a picture. You—the end user, not the ­programmer—
should sketch or write how you want the output to look when it’s done. It might be 
printed out or displayed on the monitor.
For example, if you want a time-and-billing report, you might write or draw some­
thing like Figure 13-3. Another form of output from the program might be bills to 
clients.
Input Data
Once you know the output you want, you can determine the input data and the source 
of this data. For example, for a time-and-billing report, you can specify that one source 
of data to be processed should be time cards. These are usually logs or statements

of hours worked submitted either electronically or on paper forms. The log shown 
in Figure 13-4 is an example of the kind of input data used in Advantage Advertis­
ing’s manual system. Note that military time is used. For example, instead of writing 
“5:45 p.m.,” people would write “1745.”
Processing Requirements
Here you define the processing tasks that must happen for input data to be processed 
into output. For Advantage, one of the tasks for the program will be to add the hours 
worked for different jobs for different clients.
Program Specifications Document
As in the systems life cycle, ongoing documentation is essential. You should record 
program objectives, desired outputs, needed inputs, and required processing. This 
leads to the next step, program design.

Step 2: Program Design
After program specification, you begin program 
design. (See Figure 13-5.) Here you plan a solution, 
preferably using structured programming ­techniques. 
These techniques consist of the following: (1) top-
down program design, (2) pseudocode, (3) flowcharts, 
and (4) logic structures.
Top-Down Program Design
First determine the outputs and inputs for the pro­
gram. Then use top-down program design to iden­
tify the program’s processing steps. Such steps are 
called program modules (or just modules). Each 
module is made up of logically related program 
statements.
An example of a top-down program design for 
a time-and-billing report is shown in Figure  13-6. 
Each of the boxes shown is a module. Under the 
rules of top-down design, each module should 
have a single function. The program must pass in 
sequence from one module to the next until all 
modules have been processed by the computer. 
Three of the boxes—“Obtain input,” “Compute hours for billing,” and “Produce 
output”—­correspond to the three principal computer system operations: input, process, 
and output.

Pseudocode
Pseudocode (pronounced “soo-doh-code”) is an outline of the logic of the program you 
will write. It is like doing a summary of the program before it is written. ­Figure 13-7 
shows the pseudocode you might write for one module in the time-and-billing pro­
gram. This shows the reasoning behind determining hours—including overtime 
hours—worked for different jobs for one client, Client A. Again, note this expresses the 
logic of what you want the program to do.
Flowcharts
We mentioned system flowcharts in the previous chapter. Here we are concerned with 
program flowcharts. These graphically present the detailed sequence of steps needed 
to solve a programming problem. Figure 13-8 presents several of the standard flow­
charting symbols. An example of a program flowchart is presented in Figure 13-9. 
This flowchart expresses all the logic for just one module—“Compute time on Client 
A jobs”—in the top-down program design.
Perhaps you can see from this flowchart why a computer is a computer, and not just 
an adding machine. One of the most powerful capabilities of computers is their abil­
ity to make logical comparisons. For example, a computer can compare two items to 
determine if one is less than, greater than, or equal to the other item.

Programming and Languages	 337
But have we skipped something? How do we know which kind of twists and turns 
to put in a flowchart so that it will work logically? The answer is based on the use of 
logic structures, as we will explain.
Logic Structures
How do you link the various parts of the flowchart? The best way is a combination of 
three logic structures called sequential, selection, and repetition. Using these arrange­
ments enables you to write structured programs, which take much of the guesswork 
out of programming. Let us look at the logic structures.
 • In the sequential structure, one program statement follows another. Consider, 
for example, the “compute time” flowchart. (Refer back to Figure 13-9.) Add 
regular hours to total regular hours and Add overtime hours to total overtime hours 
form a sequential structure. They logically follow each other. There is no 
question of “yes” or “no,” or a decision suggesting other consequences. See 
Figure 13-10.
 • The selection structure occurs when a decision must 
be made. The outcome of the decision determines 
which of two paths to follow. (See Figure 13-11.) This 
structure is also known as an IF-THEN-ELSE structure 
because that is how you can formulate the decision. 
Consider, for example, the selection structure in the 
“compute time” flowchart, which is concerned about 
computing overtime hours (Work past 1700?). (Refer 
back to Figure 13-9.) It might be expressed in detail as 
follows:
IF hour finished for this job is later than 1700 hours 
(5:00 p.m.), THEN overtime hours equal the number 
of hours past 1700 hours, ELSE overtime hours equal 
zero.
See Figure 13-11.
 • The repetition or loop structure describes a process 
that may be repeated as long as a certain condition 
remains true. The structure is called a “loop” or “itera­
tion” because the program loops around (iterates or 
repeats) again and again. Consider the loop structure 
in the “compute time” flowchart, which is concerned 
with testing if there are more jobs (More jobs for clients?). It might be expressed in 
detail as follows:
DO read in job information WHILE (that is, as long as) there are more jobs.
See Figure 13-12.
The last thing to do before leaving the program design step is to document the logic 
of the design. This report typically includes pseudocode, flowcharts, and logic struc­
tures. Now you are ready for the next step, program code.

Step 3: Program Code
Writing the program is called coding. Here you use the logic you developed in the 
program design step to actually write the program. (See Figure 13-13.) This is the “pro­
gram code” that instructs the computer what to do. Coding is what many people think 
of when they think of programming. As we’ve pointed out, however, it is only one of 
the six steps in the programming process.
The Good Program
What are the qualities of a good program? Above all, it should be reliable—that is, it 
should work under most conditions and produce correct output. It should catch obvi­
ous and common input errors. It also should be well documented and understandable 
by programmers other than the person who wrote it. After all, someone may need to 
make changes in the program in the future. One of the best ways to code effective pro­
grams is to write so-called structured programs, using the logic structures described 
in Step 2: Program Design.
Coding
After the program logic has been formulated, the next step is to code, or write the 
program using the appropriate computer language.
A programming language uses a collection of symbols, words, and phrases that 
instruct a computer to perform specific operations. Programming languages process 
data and information for a wide variety of different types of applications. Figure 13-14 
presents the programming code using C++, a widely used programming language, to 
calculate the compute time module. For a description of C++ and some other widely 
used programming languages, see Figure 13-15.
Once the program has been coded, the next step is testing, or debugging, the 
program.

Step 4: Program Test
Debugging refers to the process of testing and then eliminating errors (“getting the 
bugs out”). (See Figure 13-16.) It means running the program on a computer and then 
fixing the parts that do not work. Programming errors are of two types: syntax errors 
and logic errors.
Syntax Errors
A syntax error is a violation of the rules of the programming language. For example, 
in C++, each statement must end with a semicolon (;). If the semicolon is omit­
ted, then the program will not run or execute due to a syntax error. For example, 
Figure 13-17 shows testing of the compute time module in which a syntax error was 
identified.
Logic Errors
A logic error occurs when the programmer uses an incorrect calculation or leaves out 
a programming procedure. For example, a payroll program that did not compute over­
time hours would have a logic error.
Testing Process
Several methods have been devised for finding and removing both types of errors 
including desk checking, manually testing, translating, running, and beta testing.
 • Desk checking: In desk checking or code review, a programmer sitting 
at a desk checks (proofreads) a printout of the program. The programmer 
goes through the listing line by line carefully looking for syntax errors and 
logic errors.

Briefly describe the testing process.
	
Programming and Languages	 341
 • Manually testing with sample data: Using a calculator and sample data, a pro­
grammer follows each program statement and performs every calculation. 
Looking for programming logic errors, the programmer compares the manually 
calculated values to those calculated by the programs.
 • Attempt at translation: The program is run through a computer, using a ­translator 
program. The translator attempts to translate the written program from the 
programming language (such as C++) into the machine language. Before the 
­program will run, it must be free of syntax errors. Such 
errors will be identified by the translating program. 
(See Figure 13-17.)
 • Testing sample data on the computer: After all syntax 
errors have been corrected, the program is tested for 
logic errors. Sample data is used to test the correct 
execution of each program statement.
 • Testing by a select group of potential users: This is 
sometimes called beta testing. It is usually the final step 
in testing a program. Potential users try out the pro­
gram and provide feedback.
For a summary of Step 4: Program test, see Figure 13-18.

342	 chapter 13
Step 5: Program Documentation
Documentation consists of written descriptions and procedures about a program 
and how to use it. (See Figure 13-19.) It is not something done just at the end of the 
programming process. Program documentation is carried on throughout all the pro­
gramming steps. In this step, all the prior documentation is reviewed, finalized, and 
distributed. Documentation is important for people who may be involved with the 
program in the future. These people may include the following:
 • Users. Users need to know how to use the software. Some organizations may offer 
training courses to guide users through the program. However, other organiza­
tions may expect users to be able to learn a package just from the written docu­
mentation. Two examples of this sort of documentation are printed manuals and 
the help option within most applications.
 • Operators. Documentation must be provided for computer operators. If the program 
sends them error messages, for instance, they need to know what to do about them.
 • Programmers. As time passes, even the creator of the original program may not 
remember much about it. Other programmers wishing to update and modify it—
that is, perform program maintenance—may find themselves frustrated without 
adequate documentation. This kind of documentation should include text and 
program flowcharts, program listings, and sample output. It also might include 
system flowcharts to show how the particular program relates to other programs 
within an information system.

Step 6: Program Maintenance
The final step is program maintenance. (See Figure 13-20.) As much as 75 percent of 
the total lifetime cost for an application program is for maintenance. This activity is so 
commonplace that a special job title, maintenance programmer, exists.
The purpose of program maintenance is to ensure that current programs are oper­
ating error-free, efficiently, and effectively. Activities in this area fall into two catego­
ries: operations and changing needs.
Operations
Operations activities concern locating and correcting operational errors, making pro­
grams easier to use, and standardizing software using structured programming tech­
niques. For properly designed programs, these activities should be minimal.
Programming modifications or corrections are often referred to as patches. For 
software that is acquired, it is common for the software manufacturer to periodically 
send patches or updates for its software. If the patches are significant, they are known 
as software updates.
Changing Needs
All organizations change over time, and their programs must change with them. Pro­
grams need to be adjusted for a variety of reasons, including new tax laws, new infor­
mation needs, and new company policies. Significant revisions may require that the 
entire programming process begin again with program specification.
Ideally, a software project sequentially follows the six steps of software develop­
ment. However, some projects start before all requirements are known. In these 
cases, the SDLC becomes a more cyclical process, repeated several times throughout 
the development of the software. For example, agile development, a popular devel­
opment methodology, starts by getting core functionality of a program working,

then expands on it until the customer is satisfied with the results. All six steps are 
repeated over and over as quickly as possible to create incrementally more func­
tional versions of the application.
Figure 13-21 summarizes the six steps of the programming process.
CASE and OOP
You hear about efficiency and productivity everywhere. They are particularly impor­
tant for software development. Two resources that promise to help are CASE tools and 
object-oriented software development.
CASE Tools
Professional programmers are constantly looking for ways to make their work easier, 
faster, and more reliable. One tool we mentioned in Chapter 12, CASE, is meeting this 
need. Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools provide some automation 
and assistance in program design, coding, and testing. (See Figure 13-22.)
Object-Oriented Software Development
Traditional systems development is a careful, step-by-step approach focusing on 
the procedures needed to complete a certain objective. Object-oriented software 

Figure 13-22  CASE tool: Providing code-generation assistance
	
Programming and Languages	 345
­development focuses less on the procedures and more on defining the relationships 
between previously defined procedures or “objects.” Object-oriented programming 
(OOP) is a process by which a program is organized into objects. Each object con­
tains both the data and processing operations necessary to perform a task. Let’s 
explain what this means.
In the past, programs were developed as giant entities, from the first line of code to 
the last. This has been compared to building a car from scratch. Object-oriented pro­
gramming is like building a car from prefabricated parts—carburetor, alternator, fend­
ers, and so on. Object-oriented programs use objects that are reusable, self-contained 
components. Programs built with these objects assume that certain functions are the 
same. For example, many programs, from spreadsheets to database managers, have 
an instruction that will sort lists of names in alphabetical order. A programmer might 
use this object for alphabetizing in many other programs. There is no need to invent 
this activity anew every time. C++ is one of the most widely used object-oriented 
programming languages.

Generations of Programming 
Languages
Computer professionals talk about levels or generations of programming languages, 
ranging from “low” to “high.” Programming languages are called lower level when 
they are closer to the language the computer itself uses. The computer understands 
the 0s and 1s that make up bits and bytes. Programming languages are called higher 
level when they are closer to the language humans use—that is, for English speakers, 
more like English.
There are five generations of programming languages: (1) machine languages, 
(2) assembly languages, (3) procedural languages, (4) task-oriented languages, and 
(5) problem and constraint languages.
Machine Languages: The First Generation
We mentioned in Chapter 5 that a byte is made up of bits, consisting of 1s and 0s. 
These 1s and 0s may correspond to electricity’s being on or off in the computer. They 
also may correspond to a magnetic charge being present or absent on storage media 
such as disc or tape. From this two-state system, coding schemes have been devel­
oped that allow us to construct letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and other special 
characters. Examples of these coding schemes, as we saw, are ASCII, EBCDIC, and 
Unicode.
Data represented in 1s and 0s is said to be written in machine language. To see how 
hard this is to understand, imagine if you had to code this:
111100100111001111010010000100000111000000101011
Machine languages also vary according to make of computer—another characteristic 
that makes them hard to work with.
Assembly Languages: The Second Generation
Before a computer can process or run any program, the program must be converted 
or translated into machine language. Assembly languages use abbreviations or mne­
monics such as ADD that are automatically converted to the appropriate sequence of 
1s and 0s. Compared to machine languages, assembly languages are much easier for 
humans to understand and to use. The machine language code we gave above could be 
expressed in assembly language as
ADD 210(8,13),02B(4,7)
This is still pretty obscure, of course, and so assembly language is also considered low 
level.
Assembly languages also vary from computer to computer. With the third gener­
ation, we advance to high-level languages, many of which are considered portable 
languages. That is, they can be run on more than one kind of computer—they are 
“portable” from one machine to another.
High-Level Procedural Languages: The Third Generation
People are able to understand languages that are more like their own (e.g., English) 
than machine languages or assembly languages. These more English-like program­
ming languages are called “high-level” languages. However, most people still require 
some training to use higher-level languages. This is particularly true of procedural 
languages.
Procedural languages, also known as 3GLs (third-generation languages), are 
designed to express the logic—the procedures—that can solve general problems. 

	
Programming and Languages	 347
Procedural languages, then, are intended to solve general problems and are the most 
widely used languages to create software applications. C++ is a procedural language 
widely used by today’s programmers. For example, C++ was used in Advantage 
Advertising’s time-and-billing report. (See again Figure 13-14 for the compute time 
module of this program.)
Consider the following C++ statement from a program that assigns letter grades 
based on the score of an exam:
if (score > = 90) grade = ‘A’;
This statement tests whether the score is greater than or equal to 90. If it is, then the 
letter grade of A is assigned.
Like assembly languages, procedural languages must be translated into machine 
language so that the computer processes them. Depending on the language, this trans­
lation is performed by either a compiler or an interpreter.
 • A compiler converts the programmer’s procedural language program, called the 
source code, into a machine language code, called the object code. This object 
code can then be saved and run later. Examples of procedural languages using 
compilers are the standard versions of C++ and Visual Basic.
 • An interpreter converts the procedural language one statement at a time into 
machine code just before it is to be executed. No object code is saved. An example 
of a procedural language using an interpreter is the standard version of BASIC.
What is the difference between using a compiler and using an interpreter? When 
a program is run, the compiler requires two steps. The first step is to convert the 
entire program’s source code to object code. The second step is to run the object code. 
The interpreter, in contrast, converts and runs the program one line at a time. The 
advantage of a compiler language is that once the object code has been obtained, the 
program executes faster. The advantage of an interpreter language is that programs 
are easier to develop.
Task-Oriented Languages: The Fourth Generation
Third-generation languages are valuable, but they require training in programming. 
Task-oriented languages, also known as 4GLs (fourth-generation languages) and very 
high level languages, require little special training on the part of the user.
Unlike general-purpose languages, task-oriented languages are designed to solve 
specific problems. While 3GLs focus on procedures and how logic can be combined 
to solve a variety of problems, 4GLs are nonprocedural and focus on specifying the 
specific tasks the program is to accomplish. 4GLs are more English-like, easier to 
program, and widely used by nonprogrammers. Some of these fourth-generation lan­
guages are used for very specific applications. For example, IFPS (interactive financial 
planning system) is used to develop financial models. Many 4GLs are part of a data­
base management system. 4GLs include query languages and application generators:
 • Query languages: Query languages enable nonprogrammers to use certain easily 
understood commands to search and generate reports from a database. One of the 
most widely used query languages is SQL (structured query language). For example, 
let’s assume that Advantage Advertising has a database containing all customer calls 
for service and that its management would like a listing of all clients who incurred 
overtime charges. The SQL command to create this list is
SELECT client FROM dailyLog WHERE serviceEnd >17
This SQL statement selects or identifies all clients (a field name from the dailyLog 
table) that required service after 17 (military time for 5:00 p.m.). Microsoft Access 
can generate SQL commands like this one by using its Query wizard.

348	 chapter 13
 • Application generators: An application generator or a program coder is a program 
that provides modules of prewritten code. When using an application generator, 
a programmer can quickly create a program by referencing the module(s) that 
performs certain tasks. This greatly reduces the time to create an application. For 
example, Access has a report generation application and a Report wizard for creat­
ing a variety of different types of reports using database information.
Problem and Constraint Languages: The Fifth Generation
As they have evolved through the generations, computer languages have become more 
humanlike. Clearly, the fourth-generation query languages using commands that 
include words like SELECT, FROM, and WHERE are much more humanlike than the 
0s and 1s of machine language. However, 4GLs are still a long way from the natural 
languages such as English and Spanish that people use.
The next step in programming languages will be the fifth-generation language 
(5GL), or computer languages that incorporate the concepts of artificial intelligence 
to allow a person to provide a system with a problem and some constraints, and 
then request a solution. Additionally, these languages would enable a computer 
to learn and to apply new information as people do. Rather than coding by keying 
in ­specific commands, we would communicate more directly to a computer using 
­natural languages.
Consider the following natural language statement that might appear in a 5GL 
­program for recommending medical treatment:
Get patientDiagnosis from patientSymptoms “sneezing”, “coughing”, “aching”
When will fifth-generation languages become a reality? That’s difficult to say; how­
ever, researchers are actively working on the development of 5GL languages and have 
demonstrated some success.
See Figure 13-23 for a summary of the generations of programming languages.

Careers in IT
Computer programmers create, test, and troubleshoot programs used 
by computers. Programmers also may update and repair existing pro­
grams. Most computer programmers are employed by companies that 
create and sell software, but programmers also may be employed in 
various other businesses. Many computer programmers work on a 
project basis as consultants, meaning they are hired by a company 
only to complete a specific program. As technology has developed, the 
need for programmers to work on the most basic computer functions 
has decreased. However, demand for computer programmers with 
specializations in advanced programs continues.
Jobs in programming typically require a bachelor’s degree in 
computer science or information systems. However, there are posi­
tions available in the field for those with a two-year degree. Employ­
ers looking for programmers typically put an emphasis on previous 
experience. Programmers who have patience, think logically, and pay 
attention to detail are continually in demand. Additionally, program­
mers who can communicate technical information to nontechnical 
people are preferred.
Now that you have learned about programming 
and programming languages, let me tell you 
about my career as a programmer.
“
”
Computer programmers can expect to earn an annual salary in the range of $51,000 to $64,000. Advancement 
opportunities for talented programmers include a lead programmer position or supervisory positions. Programmers 
with specializations and experience also may have an opportunity to consult.

expensive for the average home. Currently, they are being 
marketed toward schools and research institutions. Using 
a GUI, students can create programs that the robot will 
follow. Alternatively, programmers can use one of several 
supported languages to write their own custom scripts 
for Nao.
In the future, it will not be necessary for someone to use 
software or know a programming language to communicate 
with a robot. Developers will use sophisticated program­
ming to give the robot the artificial intelligence neces­
sary to understand natural language. This software will be 
embedded in a chip within the robot. When you purchase 
a robot, all you will have to 
do is speak the commands in 
normal, conversational Eng­
lish. If you want the robot to 
help you clean the pool or 
lift a heavy box, you can tell 
the robot in the same man­
ner you would tell another 
person.
The hardware components 
needed to make robots are 
becoming cheaper. However, 
the software remains a chal­
lenge. Human languages and 
conversations remain very 
difficult for a computer to fully 
understand. Speech recognition continues to improve, and 
we are seeing this technology embedded in the latest smart­
phones. Nevertheless, many improvements are ­necessary 
before a humanoid robot will be able to converse with us.
Do you think you will be able to own a humanoid robot in 
your lifetime? Do you believe that programmers will be able 
to make these robots intelligent enough to carry on conver­
sations and perform a wide variety of tasks?
Your Own Programmable Robot
Have you ever dreamed of having your own robot that could 
help you with all your chores? Wouldn’t it be nice if that 
robot understood every word you said and required no com­
plex programming from you? Such a robot will be possible 
in the future as the field of robotics keeps advancing. Cur­
rently robots are used in many manufacturing roles, making 
everything from cars to frozen pancakes. Recently, there are 
already several companies that are mass-producing program­
mable robots for individuals and educational institutions. It is 
just a matter of time before these robots can understand 
human instructions instead 
of complex programming lan­
guages. Technology has been 
making better programming 
tools, and will continue to 
evolve to improve our lives as 
we look to the future.
One of the earliest robots 
that was made available to 
consumers was the Roomba 
from iRobot which is essen­
tially an automated, intelli­
gent vacuum cleaner. Since 
then, the same company has 
released robots that wash 
floors, clean pools, and clear 
gutters. The programming is handled by the robot’s devel­
opers, with the end user doing very little except turning the 
robot on. As well as these robots perform, their function is 
limited to their programmed task.
A company named Aldebaran Robotics has taken a dif­
ferent approach, creating small, humanoid robots, called 
Nao, which the end user can program. Although the 
Nao robots are being mass-produced, they are a bit too 
a look to the future

VISUAL SUMMARY
PROGRAMS AND PROGRAMMING
STEP 1: PROGRAM SPECIFICATION
Program specification, also called program definition 
or program analysis, consists of specifying five tasks 
related to objectives, outputs, inputs, requirements, and 
documentation.
Program Objectives
The first task is to clearly define the problem to solve in 
the form of program objectives.
Desired Output
Next, focus on the desired output before considering the 
required inputs.
Input Data
Once outputs are defined, determine the necessary input 
data and the source of the data.
Processing Requirements
Next, determine the steps necessary (processing require­
ments) to use input to produce output.
Program Specifications Document
The final task is to create a specifications document to 
record this step’s program objectives, outputs, inputs, and 
processing requirements.
A program is a list of instructions for a computer to follow. 
Programming (software development) is a six-step proce­
dure for creating programs.
The steps are
 • Program specification—defining objectives, inputs, 
outputs, and processing requirements.
 • Program design—creating a solution using structured 
programming tools and techniques such as top-down 
program design, pseudocode, program flowcharts, 
and logic structures.
 • Program code—writing or coding the program using a 
programming language.
 • Program test—testing or debugging the program by 
looking for syntax and logic errors.
 • Program documentation—ongoing process throughout 
the programming process.
 • Program maintenance—periodically evaluating pro­
grams for accuracy, efficiency, standardization, and 
ease of use and modifying program code as needed.

Language
To efficiently and effectively use computers, you need to understand the six steps of programming: program specifica­
tion, program design, program coding, program test, program documentation, and program maintenance. Addition­
ally, you need to be aware of CASE, OOP, and the generations of programming languages.
Coding is writing a program. There are several important 
aspects of writing a program. Two are writing good pro­
grams and actually writing or coding.
Good Programs
Good programs are reliable, detect obvious and common 
errors, and are well documented. The best way to create 
good programs is to write structured programs using the 
three basic logic structures presented in Step 2.
Coding
There are hundreds of different programming languages. 
Programming languages instruct a computer to perform 
specific operations. C++ is a widely used programming 
language.
In program design, a solution is designed using, prefer­
ably, structured programming techniques, including the 
following.
Top-Down Program Design
In top-down program design, major processing steps, 
called program modules (or modules), are identified.
Pseudocode
Pseudocode is an outline of the logic of the program you 
will write.
Flowcharts
Program flowcharts are graphic representations of the 
steps necessary to solve a programming problem.
Logic Structures
Logic structures are arrangements of programming state­
ments. Three types are
 • Sequential—one program statement followed by 
another.
 • Selection (IF-THEN-ELSE)—when a decision must be 
made.
 • Repetition (loop)—when a process is repeated until 
condition is true.

STEP 4: PROGRAM TEST
Debugging is a process of testing and eliminating errors 
in a program. Syntax and logic are two types of program­
ming errors.
Syntax Errors
Syntax errors are violations of the rules of a programming 
language. For example, omitting a semicolon at the end of 
a C++ statement is a syntax error.
Logic Errors
Logic errors are incorrect calculations or procedures. For 
example, failure to include calculation of overtime hours 
in a payroll program is a logic error.
Testing Process
Five methods for testing for syntax and logic errors are
 • Desk checking (code review)—careful reading of a 
printout of the program.
 • Manual testing—using a calculator and sample data to 
test for correct programming logic.
 • Attempt at translation—running the program using a 
translator program to identify syntax errors.
 • Testing sample data—running the program and testing 
the program for logic errors using sample data.
 • Testing by users (beta testing)—final step in which 
potential users try the program and provide feedback.
STEP 5: PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION
Program documentation consists of a written description 
of the program and the procedures for running it. People 
who use documentation include
 • Users, who need to know how to use the program. 
Some organizations offer training courses; others 
expect users to learn from written documentation.
 • Operators, who need to know how to execute the pro­
gram and how to recognize and correct errors.
 • Programmers, who may need to update and maintain 
the program in the future. Documentation could include 
text and program flowcharts, program listings, and sam­
ple outputs.

354	 chapter 13
STEP 6: PROGRAM MAINTENANCE
Program maintenance is designed to ensure that the pro­
gram operates correctly, efficiently, and effectively. Two 
categories of maintenance activities are the following.
Operations
Operations activities include locating and correcting 
errors, improving usability, and standardizing software. 
Software updates are known as patches. Significant 
patches are called software updates.
Changing Needs
Organizations change over time, and their programs must 
change with them. Agile development starts with core 
program functionality and expands until the customer is 
satisfied with the results.
CASE AND OOP
CASE
Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools pro­
vide automation and assistance in program design, cod­
ing, and testing.
OOP
Traditional systems development focuses on procedures 
to complete a specific objective.
Object-oriented software development focuses less on 
procedures and more on defining relationships between 
previously defined procedures or objects. Object-oriented 
programming (OOP) is a process by which a program is 
divided into modules called objects. Each object contains 
both the data and processing operations necessary to per­
form a task.
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE 
GENERATIONS
Programming languages have levels or generations rang­
ing from low to high. Lower-level languages are closer to 
the 0s and 1s language of computers. Higher-level lan­
guages are closer to the languages of humans.
CAREERS in IT
Programmers create, test, and troubleshoot programs. 
They also update and repair existing programs. Require­
ments include a bachelor’s or specialized two-year degree 
in computer science or information systems. Salary range 
is $51,000 to $64,000.

DISCUSSION
Respond to each of the following questions.
Expanding Your Knowledge: SOURCE CODE GENERATORS
Generally, the human resources 
that are devoted to a success­
ful software project are its 
greatest single expense. Pro­
gramming and testing applica­
tions are time-consuming tasks. 
Recently, source code genera­
tors have become popular for 
handling some of the more 
routine 
programming 
tasks. 
Research source code genera­
tors on the web, and answer the 
following questions: (a) What 
are source code generators? (b) 
How do source code generators work? (c) What programming tasks are source code generators best 
for? Why? (d) What programming tasks are beyond what source code generators can accomplish? Why?
Writing about Technology: BUGS
Several years ago, two people died and a third was maimed after receiving excessive radiation from 
a medical machine. It was only after the second incident that the problem was located—a bug in the 
software that controlled the machine. Consider the possible consequences of software failure in situ­
ations where life is at stake, and then respond to the following: (a) Are there situations when software 
bugs are unethical? Explain your answer. (b) No program of any significant complexity can reasonably 
be fully tested. When is it ethical to say that software is “tested enough”? (c) What responsibility does a 
programmer have in situations where a program fails in the field? What about the software company he 
or she works for? Does the consumer share any responsibility? Justify your answers.
Writing about Technology: SECURITY AND PRIVACY
Security and privacy are impor­
tant concerns in the develop­
ment of any information system. 
Respond to the following: (a) 
In the development process, 
who would you expect to have 
the responsibility of identifying 
­security and privacy concerns? 
(b) In what phase of the software 
development life cycle would 
security and privacy concerns 
be identified?

Many of you probably can’t remember a world without 
computers, but for some of us, computers were virtually 
unknown when we were born and have rapidly come of 
age during our lifetime.
Although there are many predecessors to what we 
think of as the modern computer—reaching as far back as 
the 18th century, when Joseph Marie Jacquard created a 
loom programmed to weave cloth and Charles Babbage 
created the first fully modern computer design (which he 
could never get to work)—the computer age did not really 
begin until the first computer was made available to the 
public in 1951.
The modern age of computers thus spans slightly more 
than 65 years (so far), which is typically broken down into 
five generations. Each generation has been marked by a 
significant advance in technology.
• First 
Generation 
(1951–57):  During the 
first generation, comput­
ers were built with vac­
uum 
tubes—electronic 
tubes that were made of 
glass and were about the 
size of lightbulbs.
• Second ­Generation (1958–63):  This generation 
began with the first computers built with transistors—
small devices that transfer elec­
tronic signals across a resistor. 
Because transistors are much 
smaller, use less power, and 
create less heat than vacuum 
tubes, the new computers were 
faster, smaller, and more reli­
able than the first-generation 
machines.
• Third Generation (1964–69):  In 1964, computer 
manufacturers began replacing transistors with integrated 
circuits. An integrated circuit (IC) is a complete electronic 
circuit on a small chip made of silicon (one of the most 
abundant elements in the earth’s crust). These comput­
ers were more reliable and compact than computers made 
with transistors, and they cost less to manufacture.
• Fourth Generation (1970–90):  Many key advances 
were made during this generation, the most significant 
being the microprocessor—a specialized chip developed 
for computer memory and 
logic. Use of a single chip to 
create a smaller “personal” 
computer (as well as digital 
watches, pocket calculators, 
copy machines, and so on) 
revolutionized the computer 
industry.
• Fifth Generation (1991–2017 and beyond):  Our 
current generation has been referred to as the “Connected 
Generation” because of the industry’s massive effort to 
increase the connectivity 
of computers. The rapidly 
expanding Internet, World 
Wide Web, and intranets 
have created an informa­
tion superhighway that 
has enabled both com­
puter professionals and 
home computer users to 
communicate with others 
across the globe.
This appendix pro­
vides you with a timeline 
that describes in more 
detail some of the most 
significant events in each 
generation of the com­
puter age.

The Computer Buyer’s Guide 371
The Computer Buyer’s Guide
PART 1: WHICH TYPES OF COMPUTERS 
SHOULD YOU PURCHASE?
Many individuals feel confused and overwhelmed when 
it comes to buying a new computer. In today’s market, 
there are various categories of computers ranging from 
desktops and laptops to ultraportable tablets and smart­
phones. And within each category, there are countless 
choices and a wide range of prices. This buying guide will 
help you choose the best combination of computers for 
your needs, as well as point out some key specifications 
that they should have.
LAPTOP COMPUTERS: TODAY’S STANDARD
Typical Recommendation: Buy a $700 to 
$1000 laptop with a 13-inch screen.
The laptop computer has become the must-have device that 
can do everything you need, wherever you need it. They 
are powerful enough to be your primary home computer 
(replacing desktops) while portable enough to take to 
school, work, the local coffee shop, and even on your next 
trip. Many students are bringing them to classes to take 
notes and perform research. If you can own only one com­
puter, make it a laptop. Affordable ones start at under $700.
If you have decided that you want to buy a laptop 
computer, be sure to read Part 2 for additional tips and 
recommendations.
SMARTPHONES: COMPUTERS 
IN YOUR POCKET
Typical Recommendation: Obtain a free or 
low-cost smartphone by signing a two-year 
wireless contract with a data plan.
For many individuals, the smartphone has become much 
like a wallet, purse, or keys—you don’t leave home with­
out it. This single, pocket-sized device fills many roles. It 
is a mobile phone, digital camera, video recorder, gaming 
device, and personal digital assistant. Most individuals 
purchase a smartphone because they need to access infor­
mation quickly and easily, regardless of where they are.
With many smartphones now available for free with 
two-year contracts, it is easier than ever to replace your 
older cell phone. The biggest drawback to owning a smart­
phone is that its “use anywhere” benefit is limited if it is 
not paired with a wireless data plan, which can often cost 
around $30 per month.
Although Apple’s iPhone was once the clear leader 
in the smartphone market, various Android devices 
include competitive features and are enjoying favor­
able reviews. If you have decided that you want to buy a 
smartphone, be sure to read Part 2 for additional tips and 
recommendations.
TABLETS: THE RISING STARS
Typical Recommendation: Buy a 10-inch tablet 
with 64 GB of storage.
The release of the iPad has revived this category of com­
puters. With an attractive, 10-inch touch-screen surface, it 
has quickly become a popular device for watching videos, 
playing games, reading e-books, and browsing the web. 
Tablets are light enough to hold comfortably for many 
hours, yet powerful enough to use a variety of apps. They 
generally have a much longer battery life than laptop 
computers.
If you are a typical computer user, then you may not 
benefit much from purchasing a tablet computer. Most of 
your computing time will be spent on your laptop com­
puter (at home and at school, for example) or on your 
smartphone. Although tablets are very popular right now, 
you must remember that they cost several hundred dol­
lars. You should have a very clear need for this sort of 
device before you decide to spend the money on it.
Many students consider buying tablets because the 
low weight makes a tablet easy to carry around. Although 
this is true, there are lightweight laptop computers that 
weigh only one or two pounds more and are much more 
versatile than tablets. Such versatility is crucial for vari­
ous types of software that are not available as apps and 
require installation on a Windows or Mac computer. 
Before you decide between a tablet and lightweight lap­
top, consider the type of software you will need for your 

372 The Computer Buyer’s Guide
schoolwork, business, or personal use. If everything you 
need is available as a mobile app, then a tablet (paired 
with a wireless keyboard) will be more affordable than a 
lightweight laptop computer.
In conclusion, purchase a tablet computer only if you 
see yourself using it often. The touch-screen interface, low 
weight, and long battery life do indeed make it easy to 
carry around and use almost anywhere you go. However, 
the price tag does not make the decision an obvious one 
if you already own a laptop computer and smartphone. If 
you have decided that you want to buy a tablet, be sure to 
read Part 2 for additional tips and recommendations.
DESKTOPS
Typical Recommendation: Buy a tower 
system with a 20- to 24-inch monitor for 
approximately $800.
Desktop (or tower) computers have been around for a long 
time. You will still find them in many offices and homes. 
However, they are steadily losing popularity because lap­
top computers have become very powerful and affordable. 
Why have a computer that remains stuck in your home 
or office when you can have a laptop that can be taken 
almost anywhere?
Although laptop computers seem to be the better 
choice, there are several reasons why you might want to 
purchase a desktop computer. First, the use of a laptop 
computer as your primary computer can be uncomfort­
able. After prolonged use, it can place stress on your 
neck, back, and wrists. Desktops typically come with 
large monitors, and various types of ergonomic keyboards 
are available. However, desktop critics will point out that 
laptop computers can be connected to external monitors 
and keyboards as well. The only downside is that a laptop 
requires the purchase of extra equipment.
The other reason to get a desktop is if you have a 
specific need that cannot be addressed by a laptop com­
puter. For example, some families have a media center 
computer that holds all the videos, photos, and music 
for the entire home network. Another example involves 
gamers, who often seek to build or customize extremely 
powerful computers. They often choose desktops for this 
endeavor.
Most users will not need to purchase a desktop com­
puter. In fact, they are currently the least popular of the 
four categories in this buying guide. However, if you have 
decided that you want to buy a desktop, be sure to read 
Part 2 for additional tips and recommendations.
PART 2: PERSONALIZED BUYING GUIDE
Now that you have decided which types of computers you 
need, it is time to explore computer specifications. The 
areas below explore the decision-making process from the 
perspective of various buyers.
LAPTOPS
There are two basic categories of laptop: the traditional 
laptop and the ultrabook. Although these two categories 
of laptop computers have the same general appearance, 
they vary greatly in power, storage capacity, weight, and 
battery life. The following section helps you find the 
device that best meets your needs.
User #1:  I am a power user. I need a portable computer that 
can handle the latest video games or process-intensive operations 
such as video editing, engineering, and design.
Response #1:  Purchase a traditional laptop computer 
that includes the following minimum specs:
 • The fastest categories of processors with large num­
ber of cores and high GHz count
 • A graphics processor (GPU) outside of the main CPU
 • 16-GB RAM
 • 1-TB hard drive
 • 17-inch screen
Expect to pay approximately $1500, perhaps more. For 
games, many individuals choose Windows-based PCs. 
The video and design industries usually use Macs.
User #2:  I am a regular user. I need a desktop replacement 
and portable computer. I typically run office software, use the 
Internet, and listen to music.
Response #2:  Purchase an affordable traditional laptop 
computer that includes the following specs:
 • Middle-tier processors—not the fastest but not the 
slowest either
 • 4- to 8-GB RAM
 • 500-GB hard drive
 • 15-inch screen
Expect to pay approximately $800 to $1000. For maximum 
savings, as well as compatibility with most software, many 
buyers choose Windows-based PCs. Be sure to purchase 
an external monitor, keyboard, and mouse if you plan on 
heavy use while at home.
User #3:  I want a small, lightweight computer that I can 
carry anywhere. I would like long battery life for extended use.
Response #3:  Purchase an ultrabook with
 • 11- to 13-inch screen
 • Solid-state hard drive
 • 4-GB RAM
 • Weight under 4 pounds
Expect to pay $700 to $1000. Many ultrabooks will not 
include a DVD drive. Windows-based ultrabooks tend 

 
The Computer Buyer’s Guide 373
to be more affordable. The MacBook Air is slightly more 
expensive, but it has always been considered a leader in 
the lightweight laptop field.
SMARTPHONES
Shopping for a smartphone involves three separate pro­
cesses: (1) choosing an operating system, such iOS, 
Android, or Windows; (2) choosing a device; and (3) choos­
ing a wireless carrier. Although the following section does 
not review different wireless companies or data plans, 
it presents a list of smartphone features that you should 
always consider before making your choice. In addition, 
it presents each smartphone operating system from the 
perspective of typical users.
Features to Consider
 • Screen and device size: Consider a size (and weight) 
that is comfortable for you to use and carry around. 
Four-inch screens are now typical.
 • Screen resolution: Some devices deliver HD quality 
for sharp photos and videos.
 • Integrated keyboard: Consider one if you type often 
on these devices.
 • Storage: Having 8 GB is enough for most users. 
Choose 16 GB or more if you plan to store large quan­
tities of music, photos, and videos. Some devices 
allow you to increase storage by using memory cards.
 • Battery life: About 7 to 8 hours is typical. Some 
devices have removable batteries.
 • Cameras: Many include front- and rear-facing cam­
eras. Compare megapixels and photo quality.
 • App market: Consider the number of apps, and 
ensure that any apps you need are available for this 
operating system.
Operating Systems
 • iOS: The iPhone is considered by many to be the 
­standard against which all smartphones are measured. 
Buyers typically choose the iPhone if they are Mac 
owners or prefer a tightly controlled “ecosystem” 
from Apple where stability and ease of use are 
favored over heavy customization.
 • Android: There are many Android devices available 
from various manufacturers, some free with a wire­
less contract. Buyers who enjoy customizing their 
interface typically choose Android. In addition, this 
operating system is tightly integrated with many of 
Google’s products and services.
 • Windows 10 Phone: The newcomer to the smartphone 
market features an interface that will seem familiar 
to those using Windows 8 laptop and tablets. Users 
enjoy the “live tiles,” which constantly update infor­
mation, such as social network activity.
Remember that smartphones can cost very little when 
you sign a two-year contract with a wireless com­
pany. Consider whether you want to make that sort of 
commitment.
TABLET COMPUTERS
Because of their increased popularity, tablets are available 
in several sizes from many different companies. The fol­
lowing section helps you find the device that best meets 
your needs.
User #1:  I want to watch videos, play games, create notes, and 
browse websites.
Response #1:  Purchase a 10-inch tablet. Expect to pay 
$400 to $500. Most weigh about 1.5 pounds. Apple’s iPad 
was very popular when first released, and it continues to 
be a popular choice among buyers today. Other things to 
consider:
 • For greater customization, consider an Android-based 
tablet. There are several models that are comparable 
to the iPad, which is considered by many reviewers to 
be the standard bearer.
 • The Microsoft Surface tablet includes a keyboard that 
is integrated into the cover. However, any tablet can 
be paired with a Bluetooth keyboard, which is crucial 
if you plan to type often.
 • Make sure the apps you plan on using are available 
for the tablet’s operating system.
 • Having 16 GB of storage is typical. Some tablets let 
you expand this by using flash memory cards.
User #2:  I want to read e-books, browse websites, and have a 
lightweight device that I can hold with one hand.
Response #2:  Purchase a 7-inch tablet. Expect to pay 
around $200. Most weigh less than 1 pound. Google’s 
Nexus 7 and Amazon’s Kindle Fire are popular Android-
based tablets.
DESKTOP COMPUTERS
Desktops remain popular for offices, both at home and in 
many companies. In addition, many power users require 
them for graphics-intensive tasks. The following section 
helps you find the device that best meets your needs.
User #1:  I need a powerful computer that can handle the ­latest 
video games or process-intensive operations such as video 
editing, engineering, and design.
Response #1:  Purchase a tower-based computer with the 
following minimum specs:
 • The fastest categories of processors with large num­
ber of cores and high GHz count
 • High-performance video card

374 The Computer Buyer’s Guide
 • 16-GB RAM
 • 2-TB hard drive
 • 24-inch monitor
 • Specialty peripherals (such as game controllers) when 
needed
Expect to pay at least $1500 for these powerful computers. 
For games, many individuals choose Windows-based PCs. 
The video and design industries usually use Macs.
User #2:  I would like a computer that can be used by the 
entire family for many years.
Response #2:  Purchase a tower or all-in-one computer 
with the following minimum specs:
 • Middle-tier processor
 • 8-GB RAM
 • 500-GB hard drive (increase to 2 TB if you plan to 
store a large number of videos)
 • 20- to 24-inch monitor
 • Ergonomic keyboard
Tower-based systems are usually offered in a package 
that includes the monitor and several peripherals. All-in-
one systems will, of course, include the monitor, some of 
which are touch screens. Spending approximately $700 to 
$1000 will help ensure that the components remain rel­
evant for several years. For a stylish and powerful all-in-
one computer, consider the slightly more expensive iMac 
from Apple.
