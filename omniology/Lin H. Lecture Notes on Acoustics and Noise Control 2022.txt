Preface
Objectives of the Book
Lecture Notes on Acoustics and Noise Control provides a mathematical backbone
for acoustics and noise control. This mathematical foundation is comprised of
straightforward mathematical derivations and formulations of sound waves. All
formulations are built from the acoustic wave equation based on the kinetic theory
of gases. The mathematical formulations are condensed into a minimalistic yet
complete acoustic foundation for a one-semester course. The formulations covered
in this book can be used as reliable references for researchers and engineers working
in the ﬁeld of acoustics and noise control.
Style
This book is written in a course notes format for a one-semester course of “acoustics
and noise control.” This course is offered to senior undergraduates and beginning
graduate students without a prior background of acoustics or noise control. The
materials in this book are compiled from a series of noise, vibration, and harshness
(NVH) courses taught by the authors of this book during the past 14 years at Oakland
University.
Straightforward derivations of formulations are presented in the course notes.
When the derivation of formulas is the main objective of a section, the ﬁnal formulas
are placed at the beginning of that section to serve as a compass of derivation. The
properties of sound can be observed and understood through the derivation of the
formulation. Class examples and homework are included to support and reinforce
the derivations. Through the derivations, examples, and homework, students can
understand the physics behind the formulas.
v

Two signiﬁcant projects in numerical analysis of sound propagation are included
in this course. The ﬁrst project revolves around numerically calculating the sound
pressure induced by a vibrating plate. This project requires students to understand
the formulations for acoustic point sources and apply them to the real-world situa-
tions. The ﬁrst project concludes the fundamental acoustics theory in the ﬁrst half of
the course (Chaps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). The second project requires numerical
calculation of the sound power transmission in pipes. This project requires students
to understand the formula for power transmission in pipes as ﬁlters and apply them to
real-world problems. The second project concludes the ﬁlter design in the second
half of the course (Chaps. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12).
Prerequisites
Students should have a basic knowledge of practical experience with calculus and
differential equations.
The Big Picture
The ﬁrst half of this book covers the fundamentals of acoustic wave formulations.
Chapter 1 reviews complex numbers and introduces four equivalent forms of
complex numbers for harmonic waves. Understanding these four equivalent forms
of complex numbers is crucial for understanding the mathematical formulations of
acoustics and noise control. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 derive and solve the plane acoustic
wave equation. Chapters 5 and 6 derive and solve the spherical wave equation. At
the end of Chap. 6, Project #1 is included to reinforce and consolidate the learning
from Chaps. 1 to 6 (the ﬁrst half of the course). This project requires students to
numerically calculate sound pressure using the point source formulation obtained in
Chap. 6.
The second half of this book covers applications of acoustics in the ﬁeld of noise
control. Chapters 7 and 8 explain and formulate the sound resonance in rectangular
cavities and sound propagation in wave guides. Chapter 9 introduces the concept of
weighted sound pressure levels. Chapter 10 introduces the basic formulations for
noise control of room acoustics. Chapters 11 and 12 cover the theory of three basic
acoustic ﬁlters: the high-pass ﬁlter, the low-pass ﬁlter, and the band-stop (Helm-
holtz) ﬁlters.

Preface

At the end of Chapter 11, Project 2A is included to numerically calculate sound
power transmission in pipelines using the formulas developed in this chapter. At the
end of Chapter 12, Project 2B is included to model low-pass ﬁlters, high-pass ﬁlters,
and band-stop ﬁlters as pipes with side branches. In this project, sound power
transmission of ﬁlters will be calculated.

Chapter 1
Complex Numbers for Harmonic Functions
Sound waves are typically described as simple harmonic motions. Simple harmonic
motion can be extended to describe any motion (of the sound wave) by adding a
series of simple harmonic motions such as a Fourier series. Simple harmonic
motions can be formulated using either trigonometric functions or complex expo-
nential functions. Even though we are more familiar with trigonometric functions
such as a cosine or a sine function, the complex exponential functions are commonly
used due to their compact and elegant form for derivation and integration in vibration
and acoustic analysis.
Since trigonometric functions and complex exponential functions can be used
interchangeably in the analysis of vibrations and acoustics, the ability to convert a
harmonic function between trigonometric functions and complex exponential func-
tions is essential for the analysis of either vibrations or acoustics. For this reason,
conversions between trigonometric functions and complex exponential functions are
introduced at the beginning of this course to provide a mathematical tool for
analyzing acoustics throughout this course.
This chapter will introduce the four equivalent forms for simple harmonic
motions. After you are familiar with the four equivalent forms, you will be able to
express any simple harmonic function using either a trigonometric function or a
complex exponential function using the four equivalent forms. Furthermore, you
will be able to convert any simple harmonic function between the four equivalent
forms.
This chapter can be treated as an independent chapter from the rest of the chapters
in this book. The materials in this chapter can be used for any vibration-related
course to provide students the mathematical skills to handle harmonic functions in
vibration analysis.

Review of Complex Numbers
This section and the next section cover the basic formulas of complex numbers in
either high school- or college-level mathematics courses. The goal of these two
sections is to refresh your knowledge of complex numbers for harmonic functions.
You can skim through these two sections if you already know these formulas.
So what are complex numbers? The polynomial equation:
X2 þ 1 ¼ 0
does not have a solution that can be represented by real numbers. Instead, the
solution of this polynomial equation can be represented by the complex numbers:
X ¼ 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
1
p
The square root of -1 is not a real number and has been deﬁned as an imaginary
number.
Hence, a combination of a real and an imaginary number is called a complex
number.
For example:
Z ¼ a þ jb
where a and b are real numbers, j is the imaginary number, and the bold face
character indicates that Z is a complex number.
The following are some properties of complex numbers:
•
The square of the imaginary number j is1. That is:
j2 ¼ 1
•
The absolute value of a complex number is called its modulus. That is:
Z
j j ¼ Z ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
a2 þ b2
p
•
The complex conjugate of Z ¼ a + jb is deﬁned as:
Z ¼ a  jb
•
The addition of a complex conjugate function pair is a real number as shown:
Z þ Z ¼ a þ jb þ a  jb ¼ 2a
The star symbol (*) indicates the complex conjugate of Z.

format using Euler’s formula. Euler’s formula shows the relationship between the
trigonometric functions and complex exponential functions:

Four Equivalent Forms to Represent Harmonic Waves

Instead of using a complex conjugate pair to ensure a real number (Form 3 and
Form 4), Form 3’ and Form 4’ use a brute force to take the real part of a complex
number to get the real number.
The pros and cons of using Re[ ] functions (Form 3’ and Form 4’) are listed
below:
Pros:
Form 3’ and Form 4’ do not require showing the whole complex conjugate pair. They only
need to show one complex number, which is half of the complex conjugate pair. As a
result, formulations using Form 3’ and Form 4’ are more compact than ones using Form
3 and Form 4.
Cons:
Re[ ] functions (Form 3’ and Form 4’) may mislead us into thinking that the real solution is
just ignoring the imaginary part of the complex solution. To be mathematically correct,
whenever Re[ ] functions are used, we should know that the real solution is the result of
the addition of two complex solutions as in Form 3 and Form 4.
In conclusion, even though using Re[ ] functions (Form 3’ and Form 4’) might not
be mathematically correct, Form 3’ and Form 4’ are widely used due to their
compact formulation showing only half of a complex conjugate pair. Therefore,
we need to know how to convert Form 3’ and Form 4’ back to Form 3 and Form
4. For this purpose, converting the Re[ ] functions to Form 3 and Form 4 is
demonstrated in Example 1.2. Also, exercises to convert the Re[ ] functions to
Form 3 and Form 4 are provided in the Homework Exercises section.

Mathematical Identity
Four mathematical identities will be used in deriving the four equivalent forms for
representing simple harmonic waves. Math 1 is Euler’s formula, and Math 2 will be
explained and derived. Math 3 and Math 4 will be shown below for reference:

Math 2 provides a bridge between real numbers, cos(θ), and complex numbers,
e jθ. The cosine function in Eq.(4) can be derived from Euler’s formulas by adding
Eq.(2) and Eq.(3). The sine function in Eq.(5) can be derived from Euler’s formulas
by subtracting Eq.(3) from Eq.(2):

side of the equation, cos(θ), is a real number. The right-hand side of the
equation, 1
2 ejθ þ ejθ


, is also a real number because the addition of a complex
conjugate pair is a real number. Even though both sides of Eq.(4) are real, the
formats are totally different. The left-hand side of the equation is formulated as a real
trigonometric function, cos(θ). The right-hand side of the equation is formulated as
complex exponential functions, 1
2 ejθ þ ejθ

Obtain Form 4 from Form 3
In Form 3, the constant phase ϕ is combined with the time variable ωt as one part of
the complex exponential function, ej(ωt + ϕ). In Form 4, the constant phase ϕ will be

Note that the above form is called Form 3.5 because phase ϕ has been separated
from the time variable ωt. However, e jϕ and ejϕare still not expressed in Form

Visualization and Numerical Validation
of Form 1 and Form 2
Even though the equivalency between Form 1 and Form 2 was mathematically
proven in Sect. 1.5.1, the geometric equivalency between them is not obvious. The
geometric equivalency between them can be visualized and observed by plotting
each term of these two forms.
Before we plot Form 1 and Form 2, let’s take a look at the geometric difference
between these two forms. Form 1 is the result of an addition of two simple harmonic
motions with two independent amplitudes Ac and As. Contrast to Form 1, Form 2 is
just a harmonic motion with an amplitude A but with a phase ϕ as relisted below:
(Form 1)
Ac cos (ωt)  As sin (ωt)
Real trigonometric function
(Form 2)
A cos (ωt + ϕ)
Real trigonometric function
where A, Ac, As, and ϕ are real numbers and can be related using the following
formula:

; Ac ¼ A cos ϕ
ð Þ; As ¼ A sin ϕ

The equivalency of Form 1 and Form 2 can be observed by plotting them. Also,
the equivalency of Form 1 and Form 2 can be numerically validated by adding the
cosine function, Ac cos (ωt), and sine function,As sin (ωt), to get A cos (ωt + ϕ) as
shown in the ﬁgure below.
For the purposes of demonstration, the following parameters:

Complex Numbers for Harmonic Functions

The four ﬁgures above show that the results from the addition of a cosine and sine
functions (Form 1) are the same as a cosine function (Form 2) with a phase ϕ.
Students are encouraged to regenerate these four ﬁgures with their preferred tools
such as MATLAB, Python, or Excel spreadsheet. After regenerating these four
ﬁgures, they can change the values of the three parameters ω, A, and ϕ to three
arbitrary numbers for generating a new set of four ﬁgures. The results calculated
from Form 1 and Form 2 should be the same for any given parameters ω, A, and ϕ.
This serves a numerical validation of equivalency between Form 1 and Form 2.
The exercise aims to gain deeper insight into the equivalency of Form 1 and Form
2 by visualization and numerical validation. A MATLAB code for generating the
above four ﬁgures is provided in Sect. 1.10.

Derivation of Acoustic Wave Equation
In the analysis of acoustics, sound waves are typically formulated as the additions of
series of harmonic functions such as cosine and sine functions. Each harmonic
function is a solution of an acoustic wave equation under the given boundary
conditions.
Because all the solutions of sound waves are calculated from the acoustic wave
equation, the acoustic wave equation is the most fundamental equation for the
analysis of acoustics. The focus of this chapter will be on the derivation of the
acoustic wave equation. The following is a summary of this chapter.
The one-dimensional acoustic wave equation (shown below) will be derived in
detail in this chapter from the fundamental principles of physics:
∂2
∂x2 p x, t
ð
Þ ¼ 1
c2
∂2
∂t2 p x, t
ð
Þ
where c is the speed of sound and p(x, t) is sound pressure as a function of space
coordinate x and time t.
The acoustic wave equation (shown above) is derived by combining the three
fundamental principles of physics: (I) Newton’s laws of motion, (II) equation of
continuity, and (III) equation of state. Each fundamental principle constructs a
relationship between two physical quantities of a media: (i) sound pressure, (ii) air
particle ﬂow velocity, and (iii) air density as shown in the ﬁgure below.

The derivation of these three fundamental principles (I–III) will be covered in this
chapter and is summarized as follows: (I) Euler’s force equation is based on
Newton’s law of motion; (II) equation of continuity is based on conservation of
mass; and (III) equation of state is based on the kinetic theory of gases and
conservation of energy.
After the acoustic wave equation is derived, three formulas for calculating the
speed of sound are derived near the end of this chapter from Sects. 2.5.1 to 2.5.3.

Derivation of Acoustic Wave Equation

R is the ideal gas constant.
T is the temperature in Kelvin of a transmission media.
M is the molar mass of a transmission media.
There are two goals in deriving the acoustic wave equation: (1) to understand how
sound waves propagate through the air as a result of the collisions of air particles and
(2) to understand the physical meaning of each tern in the acoustic wave equation.
2.1
Euler’s Force Equation
Euler’s force equation shows the relationship between sound pressure (pressure
difference) and molecular ﬂow velocity. Euler’s force equation in Cartesian

where p is sound pressure (pressure difference); x, y, and z are coordinates; t is time;

Euler’s force equation in vector format is independent of coordinate systems.

It can be simpliﬁed as:


ΔyΔz ¼ ρ0ΔxΔyΔz ∙∂
∂t v f
When the above equation is compared to Newton’s law of motion, the left-hand
side of the equation is the force (∂p
∂x ∙ΔxΔyΔz) due to the pressure difference, and the
right-hand side of the equation is the mass (ρ0ΔxΔyΔz) multiplied by the accelera-
tion (∂
∂t v f ).
Simplifying

the
one-dimensional Euler’s force equation in Cartesian coordinates:

The above ﬁgure illustrates the mass coming in and out of a cubic unit. The mass
ﬂow rate,Qρ, is deﬁned as the mass passing through a unit area per unit time. So, the
amount of mass passing through a small area, say ΔyΔz, is equal to QρΔyΔzΔt.
According to the law of conservation of mass, the increase of mass in the cubic
unit is equal to the “mass ﬂow in” minus “mass ﬂow out”, as shown in the ﬁgure

We will compare the above equation to the law of conservation of mass.
The left-hand side of the equation is the increase of mass in this cubic unit
(∂ρ
∂t ∙Δt ∙ΔxΔyΔz) after a ﬁnite time (Δt).
The right-hand side of the equation is the mass ﬂow in (Qρ ∙ΔyΔz ∙Δt) minus the
mass ﬂow out ( Qρ þ ∂Qρ
∂x Δx

∙ΔyΔz ∙Δt). The above equation can be simpliﬁed to:

and:

The mass ﬂow Qρ is replaced with ρovf to get:

2.3
Equation of State
The third equation needed for deriving the acoustic wave equation is called the
equation of state which is the most difﬁcult equation to derive and comprehend
among the three equations. This is because it involves both the kinetic theory of
gases and the principle of conservation of energy. Despite this difﬁculty, the physics
involved in the equation of state is both interesting and important for understanding
acoustics.
The equation of state describes the relationship between air pressure change and
mass density change as shown in the ﬁgure below:

where α is a ratio between the total energy (rotational energy + translational energy)
and the translational energy of molecules as:

The ratio, γ, of speciﬁc heats is related to the ratio, α, between total energy and
translation energy. The ratio, γ, for air can be measured (α ¼ 5
3) and is approximately
equal to:
γ ¼ 1:4
Note that γ ¼ 1.4 is approximately equivalent to α ¼ 5
3 where α relates to the
rotational energy and translational energy as mentioned earlier.
The ratio of speciﬁc heats, γ, is also referred to as the heat capacity ratio, the
adiabatic index, adiabatic exponent, or Laplace’s coefﬁcient. The ratio of speciﬁc
heats, γ, can be formulated as the heat capacity, Cp, at a constant pressure condition
divided by the heat capacity, Cv, at a constant volume condition. Further discussion
is beyond the scope of this course.

Derivation of Acoustic Wave Equation
The acoustic wave equation is based on the three physics principles, as introduced in
the previous section.
The sound pressure can be related to the air density using the ﬁrst principle:
I. Euler’s force equation: ∂

From Euler’s force equation, we have the relationship between pressure differ-
ence and ﬂow velocity.
The ﬁrst step is to replace the ﬂow velocity with the air mass density so that the
relationship between pressure difference and mass density can be formed. This is
accomplished by combining (I) Euler’s force equation and (II) the equation of
continuity and eliminating the ﬂow velocity, as shown in the ﬁgure below. Now
we have a direct relationship between pressure difference and the air mass density.
The second step is to replace the air mass density with the pressure difference so
that the acoustic wave equation has only one variable – the pressure difference
P  P0. This is accomplished by combining (III) equation of state and the relation-
ship between the pressure difference and the air mass density from the previous step.
The third step is to replace the pressure difference with sound pressure, deﬁned as
p ¼ P  Po. This yields:

Formulas for the Speed of Sound
The speed of the sound can be formulated using pressure, density, temperature, or
bulk modulus. The following sections show three formulas for calculating the speed
of sound.
2.5.1

density as:
c ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
γPo
ρo
r
where γ is the ratio of speciﬁc heats and the approximate value of γ for air is:

Derivation of Acoustic Wave Equation

Note that in the formula for the speed of sound above, the speed c is a function of
pressure Po and density ρo. However, changing the pressure does not change the
speed of sound because the effect from density ρo cancels out the effect from
pressure Po.
For example, at higher altitudes, the decrease of density is linearly proportional to
the decrease of air pressure, and the speed of sound here will be the same as at sea
level.
As a result, the temperature is the most signiﬁcant factor in the speed of the sound
and will be shown in the next section.
2.5.2
Formula Using Bulk Modulus
The speed of sound is related to the stiffness of the media. The coefﬁcient of stiffness
is also called bulk modulus and is deﬁned as the ratio of pressure increase to volume
decrease as:
B  dP
dV
Vo


Because the mass of the system remains constant, that is, ρoVa ¼ constant,
ρodVa + dρVa ¼ 0, or dVa
Va ¼  dρ
ρo, the equation of state can be rewritten using volume
instead of density as:
P  Po
Po
¼ γ ρ  ρo
ρo
! dP
Po ¼ γ dρ
ρo
! dP
Po ¼ γ dVa
Va
Substituting the equation above in the deﬁnition of bulk modulus yields:
B ¼ γPo
The formula for the speed of sound (based on bulk modulus) can be obtained by
substituting the bulk modulus into the formula for the speed of sound (based on
pressure) as:

Derivation of Acoustic Wave Equation

Chapter 3
Solutions of Acoustic Wave Equation
In this chapter, you will learn how to construct both traveling waves and standing
waves by solving the acoustic wave equation derived in the previous chapter. We
will limit the scope of this chapter to only one-dimensional plane waves. Spherical
waves will be constructed by solving the acoustic wave equation derived in spherical
coordinate systems in Chap. 5.
We will use three building blocks to construct both traveling waves and standing
waves. Each building block represents one type of basic solution under a certain
requirement. The foundation for these three building blocks is the acoustic wave
equation. They are summarized as follows:
The Foundation:

Requirement: ω
k ¼ c
Building Block 2:

Acoustic Wave Equation:
Requirement for complex solutions:
Requirement for traveling waves:

This is the Foundation for All Building Blocks
In Building Block 1, basic complex solutions (BCSs) are constructed based on the
acoustic wave equation under the requirement ω
k ¼ c. BCSs are the most direct
solutions of the acoustic wave equation. But because BCSs are complex numbers,
they have no physical attributes by themselves.
In Building Block 2, basic traveling waves (BTWs) are constructed using the
BCSs under the requirement that the BCSs must be a complex conjugate pair. BTWs
are the addition of a complex conjugate pair. Unlike BCSs, BTWs are real numbers
and have physical attributes of traveling waves. Any traveling wave can be
constructed by using the four BTWs.
In Building Block 3, basic standing waves (BSWs) are constructed using the
BTWs under the requirement that two traveling waves are traveling in the opposite
direction and have exactly the same amplitude. Any standing wave can be
constructed by using the four BSWs.
These “basic” solutions and waves will be used as building blocks for acoustic
analysis throughout this course. Basic solutions and waves allow for a more in-depth
analysis of acoustics and noise control.
Based on the traveling waves, this chapter will demonstrate how to construct
standing waves by adding two traveling waves that are moving in the opposite
direction and having the same amplitude:

where the symbol ∇is the gradient operator and ∇2 (“del squared”) is called a
Laplacian operator. The physical meaning of the gradient ∇is the same in any
coordinate system. However, the actual formulation of the gradient ∇depends on the
choice of a coordinate system.
The gradient ∇in Cartesian coordinates is a vector with bases bex,bey, and bez:
∇¼ bex ∂
∂x þ bey ∂
∂y þ bez ∂
∂z
And the Laplacian operator ∇2 in Cartesian coordinates is:
∇2 ¼ ∂2
∂x2 þ ∂2
∂y2 þ ∂2
∂z2
If a coordinate system is chosen so that the direction of propagation coincides
with the x-axis, then the spatial derivatives of the pressure with respect to the y-axis
and z-axis are zero. For a one-dimensional plane acoustic wave in the x-direction, the
sound pressure p(x, t) is independent of y and z. Therefore:
∂p
∂y ¼ 0
∂p
∂z ¼ 0
Substituting the above two conditions into the three-dimensional acoustic wave
equation will cast the one-dimensional acoustic wave equation as follows:

Eq.(3.3) and Eq.(3.4) are ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and can be
solved by several different techniques. The following are two approaches that
solve the ODEs above.
The ﬁrst approach is to assume the following two real trigonometric solutions:

This approach can give us the standing wave solutions by simply solving the
acoustic wave equation. This approach will be used for ﬁnding standing waves in
resonant cavities (Chap. 7).
However, the ﬁrst approach cannot provide in-depth knowledge of the relation-
ship between traveling waves and standing waves. For this reason, the second
approach is introduced to gain a better understanding of acoustic waves. Note that
two approaches will give us the same standing wave solutions.
The second approach is to assume a complex exponential solution as:
X x
ð Þ ¼ Aerx
ð3:5Þ
T tð Þ ¼ Best
ð3:6Þ
where A, B, r, and s are complex numbers. Substituting the above two equations into
Eq. (3.3) and Eq. (3.4) yields:

s ¼ jω

The four terms in the above equation can be considered as:

Four Basic Complex Solutions (BCS)
Because each term of the above equation is a complex solution of the acoustic
wave equation and every term is an independent solution, the four basic complex
solutions when in complex conjugate pairs can be used to construct any
traveling wave.
In addition, every BCS is a complex solution that satisﬁes the one-dimensional
acoustic wave equation Eq.(3.1). This can be proved directly by substituting the BCS
into the acoustic wave equation, as shown in Example 2.3 in the previous chapter.
Although the complex solution above p(x, t) is a mathematical solution to the
acoustic wave equation, a complex function p(x, t) cannot represent a physical
acoustic pressure. For the complex solution p(x, t) to represent an acoustic pressure,
it must be a real number resulting from the addition of complex conjugate pairs.
The constant complex coefﬁcients of the four BCSs can be expressed with
complex exponentials of explicit phases (CEP) as follows:
A1 = A1e jα1
ð3:13Þ
A2 = A2e jα2
ð3:14Þ
B1 = B1e jβ1
ð3:15Þ
B2 = B2e jβ2

where A1, A2 ,B1, and B2 are magnitudes and α1, α2, β1, and β1 are phases.

Four Basic Traveling Waves
Because sound pressure p(x, t) is a real physical quantity, the complex solution p(x, t)
must be real after applying boundary and initial conditions that are also real
numbers. Therefore, the real solution of sound pressure p(x, t) must be constructed
by two complex conjugate pairs as a result of the following constraints:
A2B2 ¼ A1B1

α2 þ β1 ¼ α1  β2  θþ
where we deﬁne four new real variables A, A+ ,θ, and θ+ with a subscript “-” to
indicate backward waves and a subscript “+” to indicate forward waves.
Based on the above four constraints and four new real variables, the general
solution p(x, t) is a real number because of the addition of the following two complex
conjugate pairs:

terms above represent a backward wave p(x, t), and the last two terms represent a
forward wave p+(x, t).
The general wave solution p(x, t) is the addition of a backward wave p(x, t) and a
forward wave p+(x, t):

The proofs of the above four equations are in the problems.
When the arguments of sine and cosine functions include phases ϕt, ϕx, ϕ+,
and ϕ, since cosine and sine only differ by a phase of π/2, all sine functions can be
changed to cosine functions, and the use of only cosine functions is enough to
represent the standing waves.

When ωt and kx have different signs, such as (ωt  kx), it is a forward traveling
wave. When ωt and kx have the same signs, such as (ωt + kx), it is a backward
traveling wave.
Because the above four BTWs are independent functions, any traveling wave can
be constructed from these four BTWs. Because these four BTWs are simple, yet can
fully represent any traveling wave, these four BTWs will be used in acoustic analysis
throughout this course.
A standing wave can be constructed with two traveling waves that have the same
amplitude and are traveling in the opposite direction.
For example, choose a forward traveling wave p+(x, t) and a backward traveling
wave p(x, t) as follows:
pþ x, t

ð
Þ
p x, t

Assume these two traveling waves have the same amplitude as:

It can be shown that the addition of these two traveling waves is a standing wave

Wavenumber, Angular Frequency, and Wave Speed
The backward wave p(x, t) and the forward wave p+(x, t) can be expressed in Form
2 (Chap. 1) as:
p(x, t) ¼ A cos (ωt  kx + ϕ)
(Form 2 : REP)
Because the harmonic wave repeats after every 2π, the above cosine function will
be the same when the increase of angle, Δθ, is an integer of 2π as:
cos ωt  kx þ ϕ
ð
Þ ¼ cos ωt  kx þ ϕ þ Δθ
ð
Þ
¼ cos ωt  kx þ ϕ þ 2π  i
ð
Þ
where:
Δθ¼ 2π ∙i.
i is an integer.
Based on this property, we can deﬁne wavelength λ and period T from the
following relations:
Δθ ¼ ωT ¼ 2π ! ω ¼ 2π
T
Δθ ¼ kλ ¼ 2π ! k ¼ 2π
λ
Based on the two equations above, we can conclude the relationship between
k and ω as:
kλ ¼ ωT ! ω ¼ λ
T k ¼ ck
where c is the speed of the wave and is equal to the wavelength (λ) divided by the
period (T) as:
c  λ
T
In real applications, angular frequency ω is a given property. Also, the speed of
sound in the air is a known value, which just slightly varies with meteorological
conditions. Hence, based on the known speed of sound and given a speciﬁc angular
frequency, we can calculate the wavenumber and the wavelength of the acoustic
wave as:

To determine the propagation direction of a wave, we can trace one point
(a constant value of pressure p) in the wave from (x1, t1) to (x2, t2).
For the forward wave p+ above, where the signs of ω and k are different, we have:
ct2  x2 ¼ ct1  x1
! c t2  t1
ð
Þ ¼ x2  x1
Therefore, if t2 > t1, then x2 > x1, and the wave is a forward wave traveling from
left (x1) to right (x2).
For the backward wave p above, where the signs of ω and k are the same,
we have:
ct2 þ x2 ¼ ct1 þ x1
! c t2  t1
ð
Þ ¼  x2  x1
ð
Þ
Therefore, if t2 > t1, then x1 > x2, and the wave is a backward wave traveling from
right (x1) to left (x2).
In this course, the solutions of the acoustic wave equation are represented as
harmonic waves. Using Fourier analysis, any traveling waves can be represented by
the summation of a series of harmonic waves.
However, another common approach for analyzing the wave equation is by using
the function in moving wave form, f(x + ct) or f(x  ct). Any moving wave function
f(x + ct) or f(x  ct) is a solution of the acoustic wave equation. This can be easily
proved by substituting the function to the wave equation and using the following
relations:
∂
∂x f x  ct

All BTWs are the special cases (i.e., harmonic waves) of these moving wave
functions. At a ﬁxed location, say x ¼ 0, any arbitrary wave function, p(t), can be
decomposed into a series of harmonic waves:

Plotting Traveling Wave
The solutions of the acoustic wave equation expressed in both complex exponential
functions and real trigonometric functions are derived in the previous chapter, and
only Form 2 : REP is shown below for reference:
p(x, t)
¼ p(x, t) + p+(x, t)
¼ A cos (ωt + kx + ϕ) + A+ cos (ωt  kx + ϕ+)
(Form 2 : REP)
where cos(ωt + kx + ϕ) is the backward wave since ωt and kx have the same signs
and cos (ωt  kx + ϕ+) is the forward wave since ωt and kx have different signs.
For simplicity, let both phase shift angles ϕ and ϕ+ be zero and both amplitudes
A and A+ be one, and we thus arrive at:
p(x, t)
¼p(x, t) + p+(x, t)
¼A cos (ωt + kx) + A+ cos (ωt  kx)
(Form 2 : REP)
For plotting a backward wave, assume a positive increment of time Δt ¼ T

For a source at x ¼ 2λ, the pressure functions for the backward wave and the
forward wave are as follows:

¼ cos (ωt + kx  4π) ¼ cos (ωt + kx)
p+
¼ cos (ωt  k(x  2λ)) ¼ cos (ωt  kx + 2kλ)
¼ cos (ωt  kx + 4π) ¼ cos (ωt  kx)

Combining the waves induced by the sources at x ¼ 0 and x ¼ 2λ, we arrive at the

In addition, the wave at the left of x ¼ 0 yields:

Chapter 4
Acoustic Intensity and Speciﬁc Acoustic
Impedance
In the previous chapter, we constructed the sound pressures p(x, t) of both traveling
waves and standing waves based on the acoustic wave equation. In this chapter, you
will learn how to calculate ﬂow velocity u(x, t), acoustic intensity, and speciﬁc
acoustic impedance for given sound pressure. These quantities are commonly used
in the analysis of acoustics and noise control. This chapter is organized as follows:
First, you will learn how to calculate the ﬂow velocity u(x, t) for a given sound
pressure p(x, t) using Euler’s force equation that was derived in Chap. 2. This process
can be reversed to calculate the sound pressure p(x, t) for a given ﬂow velocity u(x, t)
using Euler’s force equation as shown in the ﬁgure below:

Second, you will learn how to calculate acoustic intensity I from sound pressure
p(x, t) and its corresponding ﬂow velocity u(x, t). The acoustic intensity I is simply
the average of the sound pressure p(x, t) multiplied by the ﬂow velocity u(x, t) over
the period T as shown in the ﬁgure above. The formula of acoustic intensity I for both
traveling waves and standing waves will be derived.
Third, you will learn how to calculate speciﬁc acoustic impedance z as real
numbers. The real number speciﬁc acoustic impedance z is simply the sound
pressure p(x, t) divided by the ﬂow velocity u(x, t) as shown in the ﬁgure above.
The formulas of speciﬁc acoustic impedance z for both traveling waves and standing
waves will be derived. Note that the speciﬁc acoustic impedance can be formulated
in either the real number format or the complex number format. Formulations of the
real number speciﬁc acoustic impedance z for traveling waves and standing waves
are shown in the table below and will be developed in Sect. 4.4.
Fourth, the acoustic impedance z expressed as complex numbers will be intro-
duced in Sect. 4.5. This is an advanced topic but is important for analyzing acoustic
waves in pipes. The formulas of complex number acoustic impedance will be
discussed and derived. An application of complex number acoustic impedance for
ﬁlter designs is applied in Chaps. 12 and 13.

Speciﬁc Acoustic Impedance Expressed as Complex
Numbers
Acoustic impedance z expressed as complex numbers (real impedance) will be
introduced in this section. This is an advanced topic but is important for analyzing
acoustic waves in pipes for ﬁlter designs (Chaps. 12 and 13).
4.5.1
Issues with Real Impedance
The speciﬁc acoustic impedance deﬁned in real p and u is a time function even at a
ﬁxed location. Therefore, the uses of the real acoustic impedance are limited as
described below.
For analyzing the sound pressures in connected pipes, equilibrium equations of
pressure and ﬂow (see Chap. 11 for details) use functions of space kr. Using any
function of time ωt in an equilibrium equation is impossible for analyzing the sound
pressures in connected pipes. For this reason, only speciﬁc impedances deﬁned by
complex numbers of pressure and velocity are used for the analysis in ﬁlter design
(Chaps. 11 and 12).
The speciﬁc acoustic impedance can be location-dependent, but they need to be
time-independent for ﬁlter designs using pipes. Therefore, the time-dependent terms
such as cos(ωt) or sin(ωt) must be eliminated in the speciﬁc acoustic impedance.
4.5.2
Deﬁnition of Complex Impedance
A universal technique to obtain a speciﬁc acoustic impedance that is not time-
dependent is to choose terms that are associated with either e j(ωt) or ej(ωt) such as:

Note that the complex speciﬁc acoustic impedances z and z are a complex
conjugate pair. z is deﬁned by the pressure p and velocity u which are both only
associated with e j(ωt) (the ﬁrst and the third terms in the equation below). Its complex
conjugate part z is deﬁned by the pressure p and velocity u which are both only
associated with ej(ωt) (the second and the fourth terms in the equation below). The
complex pressure p and velocity u were deﬁned in Sect. 4.1.3 and are relisted below
for easier reference:

Remarks:
It can be easily observed that after canceling the common terms e jωt in z and ejωt in
z, the complex speciﬁc acoustic impedances z and z deﬁned above are time-
independent as shown below:

The deﬁnition above for the complex speciﬁc acoustic impedance is valid for any
combination of a forward and backward traveling wave.
A speciﬁc acoustic impedance in a complex form is deﬁned in complex p and u
for each part of a conjugate complex pair. Then the complex speciﬁc acoustic
impedance will depend on the location only as shown in the following tables:

Terms associated with ejωt are the conjugates of the terms associated with e jωt.
Usually, the analysis of sound transmission in pipes only needs to compute for
one part associated with e jωt. The results of p* and u* associated with ejωt are just
the conjugates of the resulting p and u using the complex z associated with e jωt.
The ﬁnal real solutions p and u will be the summation of the pair of the complex
solution.

Acoustic Intensity and Speciﬁc Acoustic Impedance

Chapter 5
Solutions of Spherical Wave Equation
In the previous chapter, formulas for sound pressure, ﬂow velocity, acoustic inten-
sity, and speciﬁc acoustic impedance of plane waves were formulated in Cartesian
coordinates. In this chapter, formulas for these properties will be developed in
spherical coordinates.
The formulations of these properties in a spherical coordinate system are more
useful than in a Cartesian coordinate system in terms of applications and numerical
calculations because any vibrating surface can be treated as a point source. A point
source radiates sound in radial directions and can be easily formulated in a spherical
coordinate system.
The acoustic wave solutions in Cartesian coordinates were derived in the previous
chapter. The acoustic wave solutions in spherical coordinates will be derived in this
chapter. The following is a summary table of the acoustic wave solutions in both
Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems:

Spherical Coordinate System
Spherical coordinates consist of three coordinates: r, θ, and φ. These denote the
direct distance to a point in space, the lateral angle, and the vertical angle to get there.
These three coordinates describe a point in 3D space, just as do three Cartesian
coordinates x, y, and z.
The geometry of the spherical coordinates is deﬁned below:
When a vector is expressed in vector format, this expression is independent of the
choice of the coordinate systems. A vector can be formulated in the Cartesian
coordinates and the spherical coordinates as follows:
v
! ¼ xbex þ ybey þ zbez
Cartesian coord
ð
Þ
v
! ¼ rber þ θbeθ þ ϕbeφ

Gradient operator ∇is also independent of the choice of coordinate systems. The
gradient operator can also be formulated in the Cartesian coordinates and the
spherical coordinates as follows:

where the Laplacian operator for Cartesian coordinate and spherical coordinate is

previous section. The one-dimensional wave equation in the spherical coordinate

The one-dimensional acoustic wave equation in the spherical coordinate system is
a function of r and t. The wave equation above can be transferred to the form of the
wave equation in the Cartesian coordinate system by deﬁning a new function ϕ(r, t):
ψ r, t
ð
Þ  rp r, t
ð

By replacing p(r, t) in the above wave equation with ψ(r, t)/r, the wave equation
becomes:

We can see that the wave equation in the spherical coordinate is the same as

wave equation in the Cartesian coordinate, derived in Chap. 2, can be used as the
solutions, ψ(r, t), of the wave equation in the spherical coordinate.

Unlike plane waves, it is hard and unusual to create a symmetrical spherical
backward or inward traveling wave. Therefore, only the forward or outward spher-
ical waves are discussed in this course.
The following proves the outward traveling wave solution above. The wave
equation in a spherically symmetric pressure ﬁeld is described as:

∂r ¼ 1

The spherical wave equation above can be modiﬁed and arranged into the same
form as the wave equation for a plane wave. For this purpose, we will deﬁne a new
function φ:
ψ r, t
ð
Þ  rp r, t
ð
Þ
Note that ψ could be either a real or a complex number, depending on the
equation in which it is used. For example, if ψ is used in a complex equation, it is
a complex number. Similarly, if it is used in a real equation, it is a real number.
Substituting the function ψ(r, t) into the following equation will yield the spher-
ical wave equation. The algebra is straightforward and is not shown here, but will be
assigned as an exercise:

Hence, the intensity for spherical waves is in the same form as the intensity for
plane waves. However, the magnitude P is different than that of plane wave and is
given by P ¼ A
r ; the acoustic intensity of spherical waves is reduced by r2 with
relation to the distance from the source.

Speciﬁc Acoustic Impedance
The speciﬁc acoustic impedance, by deﬁnition, is calculated by dividing pressure by
velocity. Based on this deﬁnition, we have two choices for formulating the speciﬁc
acoustic impedance: (1) dividing a real number of pressure by a real number of
velocity and (2) dividing a complex number (half of a complex conjugate pair) of a
pressure by a complex number of a velocity. The two choices for formulating the
speciﬁc acoustic impedance are summarized as follows:
Choice 1: Speciﬁc acoustic impedances formulated using real numbers of pressure
and velocity.
The speciﬁc acoustic impedance can be obtained by substituting the pressure and
ﬂow velocity into the speciﬁc acoustic impedance equation.
The speciﬁc acoustic impedance in real explicit phase [REP] format can be
represented as:

Note that the speciﬁc acoustic impedances formulated using real numbers of
pressure and velocity are real numbers. As shown in the equation above, the speciﬁc
acoustic impedance (real number) is a function of space kr and time ωt.
Issues with Using Real Numbers of Pressure and Velocity (Choice 1)
For analyzing the sound pressures in connected pipes, equilibrium equations of
pressure and ﬂow (see Chap. 11 for details) use functions of space kr. Using any
function of time ωt in an equilibrium equation is impossible for analyzing the sound
pressures in connected pipes. For this reason, only speciﬁc impedances deﬁned by
complex numbers of pressure and velocity are used for the analysis in ﬁlter design
(Chaps. 11 and 12).
Choice 2: Speciﬁc acoustic impedance formulated using complex numbers of
pressure and velocity.

represented as:

Note that the speciﬁc acoustic impedances formulated using complex numbers of
pressure and velocity are complex numbers. As shown in the equation above, the
speciﬁc acoustic impedance (complex number) is the function of space kr only (time
function ωtis canceling out). Therefore, the speciﬁc acoustic impedance deﬁned by
complex numbers of pressure and velocity is not a function of time ωt.
In addition, the speciﬁc acoustic impedance deﬁned by real numbers of pressure
and velocity (Choice 1) can be any real value varying from 1 to 1. On the other
hand, the speciﬁc acoustic impedances deﬁned by complex numbers of pressure and
velocity (Choice 2) have a ﬁnite number: when kr 	 1, ϕ ﬃπ/2, z ¼ ρockrj is an

Chapter 6
Acoustic Waves from Spherical Sources
In the previous chapter, formulas for sound pressure, ﬂow velocity, acoustic inten-
sity, and speciﬁc acoustic impedance were formulated in spherical coordinates. Note
that in the previous chapter, the formulas are just general solutions and are not based
on any physical source. In this chapter, you will learn how to calculate sound
pressure radiated from a spherical source of different radii. Note that this spherical
source has physical quantities such as radius and surface vibration velocity.
The end goal of this chapter is to obtain the formula for calculating sound
pressure radiating from a point source. Even though this formula is derived from a
spherical source with physical quantities of radius and velocity, the radius is actually
eliminated in this formula which makes it possible to model any shape for vibration
surfaces. The formula for acoustic waves from a point source is summarized below
and in the table on the next page:

This formula can be used for numerical calculations of sound pressure radiating
from an arbitrary vibrating surface. The vibrating surface is numerically modeled as
a large number of singular point sources. Each point source has a source strength
representing the vibration power of its corresponding vibration surface. This tech-
nique is used in the project in this chapter.

To obtain the formulas for point sources, we will follow the three formulas as
described below:
Formula 1: Formula for a pulsating spherical source with an arbitrary radius a
Formula 2: Formula for a pulsating spherical source with a small radius (a  1)
Formula 3: Formula for a point source with a zero radius (a ¼ 0)

Let’s assume that the spherical source of radius a is uniformly dilating and
radiating spherical waves. The vibration u(a, t) at the surface of this pulsating sphere
(r ¼ a) has an amplitude of Ua, an angular frequency of ω, and a phase of θo. The
velocity at the surface of the sphere provides the boundary condition for solving the
velocity at any point outside the sphere:
u r ¼ a, t
ð
Þ ¼ Ua cos ωt þ θo
ð
Þ
At the surface of the sphere (r ¼ a), the velocity u(x, t) of the radiated wave must
equal to the velocity u(a, t) of the surface of the sphere. Based on this boundary
condition at the surface of the sphere, velocity and sound pressure at any point
outside of the sphere can be derived and are shown below before validation:

Acoustic Waves from a Point Source
6.4.1
Point Sources Formulated with Source Strength
The small spherical source in the previous section can be further reduced to a point
source. When a small spherical source is reduced to a point source, the radius and
velocity of the surface of the sphere are eliminated and replaced by acoustic source
strength.
The difference between a small spherical source and a point source in the
formulation of a radiation wave is that in small spheres, the radiation wave is
formulated with radius and vibration at the surface of a small sphere. In point
sources, the radiation wave is formulated with an acoustic source strength.
Unlike small spheres, point sources do not have a physical body. A point source is
a hypothetical source that is an acoustic source strength that can radiate spherical
waves of any frequency. Since the pressure and velocity from a small spherical
sphere can be presented in terms of source strength Qs as:
p r, t
ð
Þ ¼ ρock

2  ϕ


where θo is a given phase and Qs is source strength and is deﬁned as:
Qs 
Z
s
Unds ¼ 4πa2Ua
Qs represents the volume of ﬂuid ﬂowing into the acoustic medium from the
source. The deﬁnition of the source strength factor removes the explicit dependence
of pressure on source size as well as the source surface velocity and replaces it with
the volume of ﬂuid ﬂow into the acoustic medium. This abstraction of the source also
146
6
Acoustic Waves from Spherical Sources

removes the requirement that the source surface must be spherical. It only assumes
that the radiation wave from the source is omnidirectional regardless of its shape.
Hence, point sources are mathematical tools that can collectively represent very
complex waves radiating from general geometrics.
6.4.2
Flow Rate as Source Strength
Source strength Qs is deﬁned as:
Qs 
I
s
Unds ¼ 4πa2Ua
where s is an arbitrary closed surface enclosing the source, Un is the amplitude of the
velocity at the normal direction to the closed surface, and Ua is the amplitude of
velocity at the surface of this pulsating sphere (r ¼ a) introduced in Sect. 6.2 and
shown below for reference:
u r, t
ð
Þ ﬃUa a
r
 2
cos ωt  kr þ θo
ð
Þ
Note that Qs is also implied as an amplitude of the quantity.
According to the above deﬁnition, the source strength, Qs, is the total volume of
all particles passing through the closed surface per unit time. When the air density
ρ0 is constant, the total volume passing through a closed surface multiplying
ρ0 becomes the total mass passing through a closed surface. Therefore, based on
the deﬁnition, the source strength, Qs, is also the ﬂow rate of the source:
6.4
Acoustic Waves from a Point Source

unit time

s: enclosed surface

It can be shown that the source strength is independent of the closed surface. This
means that the source strength is the same for every closed surface:

The following example will demonstrate this statement by calculating the source
strength by integrating over the surface at a distance of (i) one radius (1a) and (ii) two

6.4.3
Point Source in an Inﬁnite Bafﬂe
A point source is placed in an inﬁnite bafﬂe as shown in the ﬁgure below:
Point source in the inﬁnite bafﬂe
The source strength of the hemispherical point source is expressed as
QH ¼ 2Qs
Since the surface area is half of the complete sphere, the ﬁeld pressure for a
hemispherical point source QH is:

Therefore, it requires only half of the source strength to produce the same
pressure ﬁeld as a full spherical pressure ﬁeld. In other words, if the same source
strength is put on the half space, half of the source strength will be reﬂected to the
half space and produce twice the pressure ﬁeld in the full spherical space created by
the same source strength.

Even though the above formula for sound power is formulated at r ¼ a, this

because the sound power is the total radiation energy of the source and will not
vary with the choices of the surface for integration. This can be checked by
comparing the above sound power, at r ¼ a, to the sound power at r ¼ 2a as

Remarks
The results show that the acoustic quantities calculated from a small spherical
formulation (Example 6.1) and a point source formulation (Example 6.2) are iden-
tical, as expected.
For a small sphere, the constant A is calculated by comparing the magnitudes of
the velocity:

A ¼ ρock

This shows that the constant A calculated from a point source is the same or close
to the value calculated from a small spherical source. Therefore, we can conclude
that this spherical source can be modeled as a point source.

Chapter 7
Resonant Cavities
In the previous chapters, when we calculated the sound pressure radiated from a
vibrating surface, we only considered forward waves but not returning waves. This is
because we have not considered any reﬂecting surfaces yet.
From this chapter forward, we will study sound waves that are bouncing inside
cavities, waveguides, and pipes. If we consider the pre-reﬂection waves as forward
waves, the post-reﬂection waves will be backward waves. The resulting wave of the
addition of a pre-reﬂection forward wave and its post-reﬂection backward wave is a
standing wave because the amplitudes of the pre-reﬂection wave and its post-
reﬂection wave are (almost) the same.
In resonant cavities, the standing waves caused by the pre-reﬂection forward
wave and the post-reﬂection backward wave will cause the air in the cavity to be
resonant at certain frequencies. The resonance of air in cavities, if not considered
properly, can be a serious design ﬂaw. On the other hand, the resonance of cavities, if
understood correctly, can be used as vibration absorbers in ﬁlter designs
(Chapter 13).
In this chapter, natural (resonant) frequencies and their corresponding mode
shapes of resonant cavities will be formulated. The discretized natural frequencies
and mode shapes will be derived from standing wave solutions with constraints on
boundary conditions. It can be difﬁcult to fully comprehend and visualize standing
waves in rectangular cavities because they propagate in 3D space. It is easier to ﬁrst
understand and formulate standing waves in 1D than in 3D. For this reason, we will
ﬁrst study the 1D standing waves between two walls and then extend the formulas to
2D and 3D.
A summary of formulas of 1D standing waves between two walls is listed below
and will be derived in Section 7.1:

1D Standing Waves Between Two Walls
Between two parallel walls, standing waves exist as mode shapes of air movement
between two walls. The standing wave solutions of the acoustic wave equation can
be obtained by solving the boundary conditions imposed by the rigid walls.
In a previous chapter, the standing wave solutions were constructed by the
addition of two traveling waves with the same amplitude (A+ ¼ A ¼ A) that
moved in opposite directions as:

Note that the zero velocity corresponds to the maximum pressure (zero slope)
based on Euler’s force equation.
Also, the mode shapes of ﬂow velocity are typically not plotted in 2D and 3D
because ﬂow velocities are vectors. It will require more than one ﬁgure to show a
mode shape of ﬂow velocities: one ﬁgure for each direction. Therefore, mode shapes
of sound pressures are commonly used.

3D Boundary Conditions of Rectangular Cavities
It can be difﬁcult to plot and visualize 3D standing waves in a rectangular cavity on
paper. However, it is possible to assume that there are no standing waves in an
arbitrary dimension and draw the standing waves in other two dimensions as shown
in Examples 7.3 and 7.4 in this section.
On the other hand, formulations for the 3D standing waves in a rectangular cavity
can be extended from the formulas of 1D and 2D standing waves as the following

3D Natural Frequencies and Mode Shapes
The mode shapes of a rectangular cavity with six rigid walls can be calculated from
the above pressure and velocity formulas with boundary conditions imposed by the

six rigid walls. Assume that the cavity is oriented at the origin of the coordinate, as
shown in the ﬁgure below:

The boundary conditions on all rigid walls require that the ﬂow velocity is zero.
By constraining the velocity at the ﬁxed boundaries will discretize the wavenumber
similar to the 2D standing waves as:
kxl ¼ π
Lx l;
kym ¼ π

kzn ¼ π

The standing wave of the pressure is shown below. The derivation for these mode
shapes is similar to the derivation for the 2D mode shapes.
The combined wavenumber klmn and the combined frequency flmn of an eigen-
mode (l, m, n) are related to the discretized wavenumbers kxl and kym and kzn as:
k2
lmn ¼ k2
xl þ k2
ym þ k2
zn
f lmn ¼ c
2π klmn
The boundary conditions imposed by six rigid walls require that the ﬂow velocity
normal to the wall be zero on the six walls. A pattern of mode shape can be deﬁned
by the nodal lines where the pressure is zero. As described for the 2D pressure in the
previous section, the nodal lines can be determined by the standing waves of the
sound pressure. An example of a mode shape and a detailed explanation of the nodal
lines can be found at the end of the following example:

Resonant Cavities

(a) Calculate all resonant frequencies of this cavity that are lower than
50 [Hz]. Indicate the associated mode number. For example, denote f213 for
eigenmode (l, m, n) ¼ (2, 1, 3) corresponding to the dimensions (Lx, Ly, Lz).
(b) Plot the mode shape of the eigenmode (l, m, n) ¼ (0, 4, 7) using the pressure
nodal lines, and indicate the peaks and valleys with “+” and “-” signs,
respectively.
Example 7.3 Solution
Part (a)
The frequency (combined) of standing waves in the cavities can be formulated
using the following relationship of eigenmodes:
f lmn ¼ ωlmn
2π ¼ c
2π klmn ¼ c

where the combined wavenumber klmn and combined frequency flmnof an eigenmode
(l, m, n) are related to the discretized wavenumbers kxl and kym and kzn as:
k2
lmn ¼ k2
xl þ k2
ym þ k2
zn
kxl ¼ π
Lx l; kym ¼ π
Ly m; kzn ¼ π
Lz n
The formula above shows that the larger the dimension (Lx,Ly or Lz) and the
smaller the mode (l, m or n), the lower the modal frequency flmn.
As a result, the ﬁrst few lower modal frequencies can be calculated using
combinations of the ﬁrst few modes. Lower modal frequencies correspond to larger
dimensions. For this reason, if the dimensions of the cavity are deﬁned from short to
long, the lower frequency mode will exist in the z-direction (the longest dimension).
The following procedures demonstrate a searching method for ﬁnding all the
resonant frequencies of this cavity lower than 50 [Hz].
Step 1:
Set l¼0 and m¼0. Next, increase n by 1 from 1. Finally, calculate the combined
frequency using the following formula until the calculated frequency is higher than
the maximum prescribed frequency (50 Hz):
f lmn ¼ ωlmn
2π ¼ c

Step 3:
Repeat Step 2 by increasing m by 1 until the calculated frequency is higher than
the prescribed frequency maximum.
Step 4:
Increase l by 1 and set m¼0 and n¼0. Then, repeat Step 2 and Step 3 above until
the calculated frequency is higher than the prescribed frequency maximum:

Part (b)
The pressure nodal lines can be determined by the following three properties of
sound pressure:
Property #1: The relationship between wavelength and length of the cavity
The formulas of the discretized wavelengths shown below can be used for
plotting the mode shapes:
λym
2 ¼ π
kym ¼ Ly
m ;
λzn
2 ¼ π
kzn ¼ Lz
n
where:
kym ¼ π
Ly m;
kzn ¼ π
Lz n;
m, n ¼ 1, 2, . . .
In the x-direction, the half wavelength of m ¼ 4 is:
λym
2 ¼ Ly
m ¼ Ly
4
In the y-direction, the half wavelength of n ¼ 7 is:
λzn
2 ¼ Lz
n ¼ Lz
7
Property #2: Boundary conditions of ﬁxed surface
Pressure is maximum at ﬁxed boundaries because the ﬂow velocity on a ﬁxed
surface is zero. We can use this property to align the harmonic function (cosine or
sine function) to the boundaries.
Property #3: Multiplication of spatial functions
7.4
3D Boundary Conditions of Rectangular Cavities
189

The peaks and valleys can be determined by the multiplication of signs of ps(y, 0,
t0) in y-direction and ps(0, z, t0) in z-direction because standing wave solutions are
the result of multiplication of temporal function T(t) and spatial functions X(x), Y(y),
and Z(z) as:
p x, y, z, t

ð Þ Y y
ð Þ Z zð Þ
¼ Plmn cos ωt þ θt
ð
Þ cos kxlx
ð
Þ cos kymy



Therefore, the pressure nodal lines and valleys of eigenmode (l, m, n) ¼ (0, 4, 7)
can be drawn as follows:

The index l is zero in the eigenmode (l, m, n) ¼ (0, 4, 7) which means that this
eigenmode has no mode shape in the x-direction. In other words, the sound pressure
of this eigenmode is the same everywhere in the x-direction. Therefore, the standing
wave of the sound pressure can be reduced to:

Chapter 8
Acoustic Waveguides
In the previous chapter, resonance in rectangular cavities was formulated as standing
waves as a result of the addition of a forward traveling wave (pre-reﬂection) and a
backward traveling wave (post-reﬂection). In this chapter, we will study the prop-
agation of plane waves in acoustic waveguides, as shown on the right-hand side of
the ﬁgure below. In acoustic waveguides, traveling waves propagate along wave-
guides and have no returning waves; standing waves exist in lateral directions.
We can treat acoustic waveguides as resonant cavities with the two ends removed
(see the ﬁgure below). Because there is no reﬂecting wave on the two ends, the wave
in the waveguide will propagate without returning waves (as shown on the right-
hand side of the ﬁgure below):

The propagation of plane waves in acoustic waveguides is in the form of
resonance (standing waves in the transverse direction) and propagation (traveling
waves in the axial direction). Based on what we learned from the previous chapters,
we can treat a standing wave (shown in the upper left of the ﬁgure below) as the
addition of two traveling waves with the same amplitudes and traveling in opposite
directions. By adding these two traveling waves (in the transverse direction) back to
the traveling wave (in the axial direction), we can reconstruct the propagating wave
in the acoustic waveguide as shown in the upper right of the ﬁgure below:

After the two walls in the z-direction are removed, the four wavenumber vectors
(in 2D resonant cavities as shown in the previous chapter) become two wavenumber
vectors because there is no reﬂection in the z-direction as shown in the ﬁgure above.
Without the two walls in the z-direction, the wavenumbers in the y-direction are still
discretized (as in 2D resonant cavities), but the wavenumbers in the z-direction
become continuous numbers as:
kym ¼ π
Ly m
kym is DISCRETIZED where m is an INTEGER
kzn ¼ π
Lz n ¼ kz
kz
is CONTINOUS since Lz can be ANY LENGTH
In a waveguide, because Lz can be considered as a very large number, and based
on the formula above, kzn is continuous. The formulas shown above are the most
important formulas of this chapter and will be derived in detail in this chapter.

Deﬁnition of Wavenumber Vectors
We have derived the relationship between the combined wavenumber k and the
component wavenumbers kx and ky in Chap. 7:

Substituting the relationship between the wavenumber k and the wavelength λ:
k ¼ 2π

into the ﬁrst equation gives the relationship between the combined wavelength λ and
the component wavelengths λx and λy as:

Traveling Waves in Resonant Cavities
In a 1D plane wave, the 1D standing wave can be constructed by the addition of two
traveling waves with the same amplitudes and traveling in opposite directions.
In a resonant cavity, a 2D mode shape of resonant can be separated into two sets
of 2D standing waves (plane wave). Each set of the 2D standing wave can be
constructed by the addition of two 2D traveling waves with the same amplitudes
and traveling in opposite directions. Therefore, a 2D mode shape of resonant can be
constructed by four 2D traveling waves.

Wavenumber Vectors in Acoustic Waveguides
In the acoustic waveguide shown in the right ﬁgure below, the acoustic wave can
travel in the z-direction but will reﬂect on all four sides of the waveguide.
Waveguides are elongated rectangular cavities with no closed walls in the axial
direction. We can construct a waveguide by removing the two walls in the
z-direction of an elongated rectangular cavity. The ﬁgure below shows that the
two walls in the z-direction of a resonant cavity are removed to allow acoustic
waves to propagate in the z-direction in an acoustic waveguide.
After the two walls in the z-direction are removed, the four wavenumber vectors
become two wavenumber vectors because there is no reﬂection in the z-direction as
shown in the ﬁgure below:
Resonant Cavity
Acoustic Waveguide
With the two walls in the z-direction, the wavenumbers in both the y-direction
and z-direction are discretized as:
kym ¼ π
Ly m
kym is DISCRETIZED where m is an INTEGER
214
8
Acoustic Waveguides

kzn ¼ π
Lz n
kzn is DISCRETIZED where n is an INTEGER
Without the two walls in the z-direction, the wavenumbers in the y-direction are
still discretized, but the wavenumbers in the z-direction become continuous
numbers as:
kym ¼ π
Ly m
kym is DISCRETIZED where m is an INTEGER
kzn ¼ π
Lz n ¼ kz
kz
is CONTINOUS since Lz can be ANY LENGTH
In a waveguide, because Lz can be considered as a very large number, and based
on the formula above, kzn is continuous:
Resonant Cavity
Acoustic Waveguide
: Continuous Number
Because the wavenumber kz changes from being discretized numbers to being
continuous numbers, a pure tone (single-frequency sound) will propagate along the
axial direction with any transverse eigenmode of the waveguide.

Assume a waveguide has a rectangular cross-section of Lx ¼ 1

Example 8.3: Solution
Part (a)
Similar to the searching method for calculating the natural frequencies which are
lower than a given frequency in the previous chapter, a searching method will be
used to calculate all of the possible wavenumber vectors that can carry a pure tone.
Calculations of Wavenumber Vectors by Using a Searching Method
The

between
the

where k is the combined wavenumber klmn and:
kxl ¼ π
Lx l; kym ¼ π
Ly m; kzn ¼ π
Lz n
Since Lz can be ANY LENGTH, kzn is CONTINOUS and is not discretized
anymore. A star symbol “*” is used in the subscript to indicate that a wavenumber is
continuous. Based on this and the relationship above, the wavenumber kz in the
axial direction can be calculated using:

Summary of Wavenumber Vectors in Waveguides
For the eigenmodes having a mode number l ¼ 0, there are two eigenmodes (l, m,
n) ¼ (0, 1, ) and (0, 2, ) in y-direction. These two eigenmodes have the following
properties:
kxl ¼ 0:
kym is discretized due to the boundary condition: kym ¼ π

kz is continued since Lz can be any length: kz ¼ π
Lz n.

Therefore, the possible eigenmodes are intersections (black dots) between a circle
with a radius k and horizontal lines with a height kym as shown in the ﬁgure below:

This method provides a quick way to ﬁnd all the possible eigenmodes but does
not provide the wavenumber vectors. The wavenumber vectors still need to be
calculated after identifying the eigenmodes.
Part (b)
The cutoff frequency corresponds to the lowest wavenumber in both the x- and
y-direction. In this example, kx1 ¼ 3π and ky1 ¼ 2π. Therefore, the lowest
wavenumber is:
ky1 ¼ 2π

units:
Note that any pure tone with a frequency smaller than the cutoff frequency will
have only a direct wave (m ¼ 0) since the corresponding wavenumber is too small to
form a circle that intercepts any transverse eigenmode kym with m > 0.
As a result, any pure tone with a frequency smaller than the cutoff frequency have
only direct wave and no echoes. When there are no echoes for any frequencies, the
sound will have no distortion after passing through a waveguide and will be suitable
for transmitting signals or sounds.
8.5
Traveling Waves in Acoustic Waveguides
The traveling time of a wave from one end of the waveguide to the other end depends
on the eigenmode which carries the pure tone. Larger mode numbers have larger
propagation angles and will result in longer traveling times. On the other hand,
smaller mode numbers have smaller propagation angles and will result in shorter
traveling times. When the pure tone is not carried by any mode (m>0), it will travel
parallel to the axial direction and result in the shortest possible traveling time.
The traveling time for the wave (direct or reﬂected) to arrive at the other end of the
waveguide can be formulated as:
Traveling Time ¼ Distance
Velocity

This pure tone will travel in this waveguide with ﬁve modes. The difference in
travel times between different eigenmodes and the direct wave will create echoes of
the sound. A sound is usually containing many different frequencies.
When a sound is made of multiple frequencies, since the traveling times are
different for different frequencies, even by the same eigenmode, the sound transmit-
ted in the waveguide will be distorted.
Example 8.5: (Cutoff Frequency of Waveguides)
This example shows how to calculate the frequency range of an undisturbed pure
tones in a narrow waveguide. Assume that a narrow waveguide has a square cross-
section with the dimensions of Lx ¼ Ly¼ 0 .0085 [m].
Example 8.5: Solution
Since the dimensions in the x- and y-direction are the same, the cutoff frequencies
(the lowest ﬁrst transverse ﬁrst mode) are the same for both directions.
The transverse frequency of the ﬁrst mode can be calculated as:

Acoustic Waveguides

kym ¼ π
Ly m; m ¼ 1
The transverse frequency of the ﬁrst mode is called the cutoff frequency of the
waveguide because it is the maximum frequency that could travel in the waveguide
without an echo. Any frequency above the cutoff frequency will disturb the direct
sound due to the echo carried by the transverse eigenmode, as shown in Sect. 8.3.
Therefore, the non-echo effect frequency range of this waveguide is 0–20
[kHz]. And the frequency range of sounds that will not disturb the direct sound
due to the echo of the sound carried by the transverse eigenmode of the waveguide is
0–20 [kHz].
Remarks: Stethoscopes Are Waveguides with a Very High Cutoff Frequency
Typical stethoscopes have diameters around 0 .0085 [m]. Based on the example
above, the cutoff frequency of stethoscopes is around 20 [kHz].
Since the human audible range is 20 [Hz] to 20 [kHz] and there are no echoes with
frequencies below 20 [kHz] in this waveguide, any sound waves such as heartbeats
can be clearly heard on the other side of a stethoscope. Frequencies above the cutoff
frequency of 20 [kHz] will still result in echoes, but these echoes cannot be heard by
a human. Stethoscopes are designed with a diameter less than 8.5 [mm] in order to
eliminate/disable echo sound with frequencies below the cutoff frequency of
20 [kHz].

Sound Pressure Levels and Octave Bands
In the ﬁeld of noise control, noise is quantiﬁed by sound pressure level (SPL). SPL
can be either unweighted or weighted. In this chapter, you will learn how to calculate
both unweighted SPL and weighted SPL. This chapter is divided into four sections
and is summarized as follows:
Section 9.1 introduces and deﬁnes the decibel scale. The decibel scale is used for
sound pressure level (SPL) and other power-like physical quantities in vibrations. In
this section, you will learn how to calculate the combined level from separated levels
of n incoherent radiating source using the formula below:

Section 9.2 introduces and deﬁnes the sound pressure level (SPL). Parseval’s
theorem will be used to derive the formula for calculating SPL in the frequency
domain. Parseval’s theorem is important because it allows us to formulate RMS
pressure in the frequency domain as shown in the ﬂowchart below:

Section 9.3 introduces the octave band and the 1/3 octave band, which are the
most used bands. Bands are needed for formulations of weighted sound pressure
level (SPL) because the weighting is related to frequencies and frequencies are
grouped into bands. The calculation of either the octave band or the 1/3 octave
band requires the frequency contents at discretized frequencies. The frequency
contents are given in the form of the Fourier series as a result of the Fourier
transform. Fourier transform is not covered in this course.
Section 9.4 introduces and formulates the weighted sound pressure level (SPL).
Three commonly used weighting systems will be introduced. A-weighting is used in
examples and homework exercises. This section will explain why weighted SPL can
only be calculated in the frequency domain but not the time domain.
The goal of this chapter is to equip students with the understanding and technique
to calculate a weighted sound pressure for measured sound pressure data.

9.1.2
Levels and Decibel Scale
Sound pressure and power and vibration amplitudes are commonly expressed in the
decibel scale instead of the linear scale. Since the quantities involved in the sound
and vibration ﬁeld cover an extremely large range of numbers, using a logarithmic
scale to do calculations simpliﬁes the comparison of values involved, and a smaller
range of numbers can thus be used.
Decibel is deﬁned as “10 times the logarithm base 10 of the ratio of ‘power-like’
quantities.” The argument of the logarithm has no unit. Hence, the designations in
decibels are referred to as levels. The name “decibel” is one-tenth of one “Bel,”
named in honor of Alexander Graham Bell, and is written in short as dB.
The mathematical expression for a level is:

Only (1) sound pressure level and (2) sound power level have well-established
reference values, but there is no established international reference for other
power-like physical quantities. For levels other than the sound pressure level
and power level, their reference values must be provided for calculating their
associated power-like quantities.
•
The deﬁnition of levels and the decibel scale requires a reference value. When a
power-like physical quantity is presented as a level and decibel scale, this power-
like quantity is compared to the reference value. Therefore, the beneﬁt of using a
level and decibel scale is to make comparing different physical quantities easier.
For example, RMS pressure has an international reference value of 20 [μPa], and
this reference value allows comparing RMS pressure using dB instead of μPa.

Sound Pressure Level Calculated in Frequency Domain
In the previous section, sound pressure level (SPL) was deﬁned and calculated in the
time domain. However, there is a limitation to calculating SPL in the time domain:
weighted SPL cannot be calculated in the time domain because the weighting is
frequency-dependent. For this reason, SPL is commonly formulated and calculated
in the frequency domain:

Octave Bands
Octave bands are commonly used in the ﬁelds of acoustics and vibration. Two major
beneﬁts of using octave bands are as follows: (1) it provides insight of power
distribution vs. frequency, and (2) it allows to apply weight to the different
frequencies.
9.3.1
Center Frequencies and Upper and Lower Bounds
of Octave Bands
Spectra obtained by Fourier transform (FT) using frequency in linear scale are called
the narrow band spectra. However, such detail in spectral resolution is not always
needed. Hence, spectra can be obtained in wider frequency bands for easier analysis.
The most commonly used frequency bands are octave bands (frequency in logarith-
mic scale). Each octave band has a center frequency and a band width, deﬁned as:

acceptance of the new designation of the octave bands, the SIL was adapted to new
octave bands and renamed preferred speech interference level (PSIL). PSIL is
deﬁned as the arithmetic average of SPL in the 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz octave
bands [4,7]:

Weighted Sound Pressure Level
Weightings were developed as a method to better subjectively evaluate the impact of
noise on the human ear. The human ear is more sensitive to sounds at certain
frequency ranges. Therefore, we apply weighting corresponding to sensitivity at
different frequencies.
As mentioned in Sect. 9.2.5, weighting cannot be applied in SPL in the time
domain. The weighted SPL can only be calculated in the frequency domain. The

formula for calculating RMS pressure, which is used for calculating SPL, in the
frequency domain is derived by Parseval’s theorem as shown in the ﬂowchart below.

Based on the equations above, there are two ways to calculate the weighted sound
pressure level Lp, w:
1. Applying the weighting W by multiplying P2
RMS ∙W:
2. Applying the weighting W by adding 10log10(W)

It is easier to calculate the weighted sound pressure level Lp, w by adding
10log10(W) as a gain or loss of dB than by multiplying P2
RMS ∙W.
9.4.2
A-Weighted Decibels (dBA)
There are three weightings that were initially introduced for noise levels
corresponding to different ranges.
A-weighting is for levels below 55 dB.
B-weighting is for levels between 55 and 85 dB.
C-weighting is for levels above 85 dB.
However, A-weighting is used today to evaluate the response of human hearing at
all levels. The three weightings 10log10(W) in dB to be added as a gain/loss for
different frequencies are shown in the ﬁgure below. The table below also gives the
A-weighting for some frequencies.
When sound pressure levels are measured, their spectrum is applied by the
weighting attenuation at different frequencies to generate weighted sound pressure
levels. The resulting spectral levels can be added by the dB addition rule to ﬁnd the
total (combined) weighted sound pressure levels. Weighted SPLs have units in dB,
with the weighting letter appended (i. e., dBA) to indicate the type of weighting.
A-weighting can be applied to narrow or m-octave band spectrums and can be either
an analog ﬁlter or, in the case of digital equipment, simply an attenuation applied to
the calculated spectrum.

Chapter 10
Room Acoustics and Acoustical Partitions
This chapter introduces room acoustics and acoustical partitions. Room acoustics
studies the change of energy density at different locations due to the conditions of
direct and reﬂected sound. Acoustical partitions are used to reduce noise from a
source.
Formulas for evaluating transmission loss (TL) and noise reduction (NR) in a
room due to partition walls are formulated in this chapter.
This chapter is organized into ﬁve sections as described below:
Section 10.1 introduces and deﬁnes three acoustic quantities: sound power (Sect.
10.1.1), acoustic intensity (Sect. 10.1.2), and energy density (Sect. 10.1.3). These
acoustic quantities are used for deriving the formulas of transmission loss (TL) and
noise reduction (NR). These three acoustic quantities are also commonly used in the
analysis of room acoustics.
Section 10.2 introduces and deﬁnes three room quantities: absorption coefﬁcient
of surfaces (Sect. 10.2.1), room constant (Sect. 10.2.2), and reverberation time (Sect.
10.2.3). These room quantities are used in the analysis of room acoustics in the next
section (Sect. 10.3).
Section 10.3 focuses on the analysis of room acoustics. A formula for calculating
sound pressure level due to both direct and reverberant sound waves from a sound
source is summarized below:
LP ¼ Lw þ 10 log
Q
4πr2 þ 4
R


where LP is the sound pressure level at a distance r from the acoustic source
considering both the direct and reverberant sound waves, Lw is the sound power of
the acoustic source, Q is the directivity factor of the acoustic, and R is room constant.
The equation above will be derived in this section.
Section 10.4 introduces transmission loss (TL) due to acoustical partitions. A
formula that relates the transmission loss (TL) to the incident sound pressure level
(Lwi) and transmitted sound pressure level (Lwt) will be deﬁned and is summarized

where τ is the transmission coefﬁcient, wi is the incident sound power, and wt is the
transmitted sound power.
Section 10.5 introduces noise reduction (NR) due to acoustical partitions. A
formula that relates the noise reduction (NR) to the sound pressure level near the
wall in Room 1 (Lp1) and sound pressure level near the wall in Room 2 (Lp2) will be
deﬁned and is summarized below. Also, a formula for calculating sound pressure
level due to a sound source through a partition wall will be derived and is summa-
rized as follows:

10.2.1
Absorption Coefﬁcient of Surface
The statistical absorption coefﬁcient or random incidence sound absorption coefﬁ-
cient, α, is frequency-dependent and is deﬁned as the ratio of acoustic energy
absorbed by a surface to the acoustical energy incident upon the surface when the
incident sound ﬁeld is perfectly diffused, α  wiwr
wi .
The absorption coefﬁcient of a material is a number between 0 and 1 that indicates
the proportion of sound which is absorbed by the surface compared to the incident
sound. A large, fully open window would offer no reﬂection, as any sound reaching
it would pass straight out and no sound would be reﬂected. This would have an

absorption coefﬁcient of 1. Conversely, a thick, smooth painted concrete ceiling
would be the acoustic equivalent of a mirror and have an absorption coefﬁcient very
close to 0.

presented in the table below.

Chapter 11
Power Transmission in Pipelines
This chapter and the next chapter introduce both analytical and numerical methods
for ﬁlter designs. This chapter will focus on developing formulas of pressure and
acoustic impedance in pipelines. These formulas are the foundation for analyzing
sound waves in pipes. The next chapter will extend pipelines to pipes with side
branches which can be used to design any complex pipe system.
Pipelines are pipes connected in series without any side branches. Pipes with side
branches will be discussed in the next chapter. The complex amplitudes, acoustic
impedance, balancing equations, and power transmission in pipelines will be cov-
ered in this chapter and are organized into the following sections:
Section 11.1 deﬁnes complex amplitudes of pressure. Four formulas (Formulas
2A–2D) for transferring complex amplitudes of pressure from one end of a pipe to
the other end are introduced.
Section 11.2 deﬁnes acoustic impedance in a pipe considering both the forward
and backward waves. The acoustic impedance is deﬁned by the complex amplitude
of pressure introduced in Section 11.1. Two formulas (Formulas 3A–3B) for calcu-
lating acoustic impedance from complex amplitudes of pressure are introduced.
Section 11.3 introduces two equations for (1) balancing pressure and (2) conser-
vation of mass at the intersection between two pipes. Four formulas (Formulas 4A–
4D) for transferring complex amplitudes of pressure between two adjacent pipes are
introduced.
Section 11.4 introduces a formula (Formula 5) for transferring acoustic imped-
ances between two adjacent pipes.
Section 11.5 demonstrates two techniques for the frequency domain analysis of
pipelines. The ﬁrst technique is for calculating the equivalent acoustic impedance of
pipelines (based on Formula 5). The second technique is for transferring the complex
amplitudes of pressure in pipelines (based on Formulas 4A–4D). Example 11.4
shows the procedures for calculating power transmission coefﬁcient of pipelines
using a numerical approach. This example uses the computer program in Sect. 11.9.
Section 11.6 demonstrates a numerical method for modeling pipelines with three
pipes in series. This method uses three MATLAB functions provided in the

Computer Program Section in Sect. 11.7. This method will plot the power transmis-
sion coefﬁcient vs. the frequency of the pipeline.
Section 11.7 shows three MATLAB functions that can be used for the numerical
analysis of pipelines described in the previous section (Sect. 11.6). These functions
are based on Formulas 1, 4, 5, and 6 derived in this chapter.
Section 11.8 includes a numerical project to calculate and plot the power trans-
mission coefﬁcient vs. the frequency of a pipeline with an arbitrary number of pipes
in series. The procedures for this project are similar to the procedures described in
the Numerical Method Section (Sect. 11.6). The solutions are not provided.
11.1
Complex Amplitude of Pressure and Acoustic
Impedance
We will deﬁne the complex amplitude of pressure in this section.
11.1.1
Deﬁnition of Complex Amplitude of Pressure
Complex amplitudes of sound pressure are used for frequency domain analysis of
pipes. For frequency domain analysis of pipes, all time-related parts must be
eliminated. Therefore, complex amplitudes must have the following two properties:
•
Complex amplitudes of pressure are time-independent.
•
Complex amplitudes of pressure are location-dependent.
Based on these two properties, the complex amplitude Pfxo of pressure pf(x, t) of a
forward wave can be demonstrated as:
p f x, t

Þ ¼ 1



where complex amplitude Pfxo of pressure pf(x, t) at x ¼ xo is deﬁned as:
Pfxo = Aþejkxo
Note that:
•
The time-dependent term e jωt is not included in the complex amplitude of
pressure Pfxo.
278

•
The complex amplitude of pressure Pfxo is the amplitude of pressure at location
x ¼ xo where ejk xxo
ð
Þ ¼ 1.
We can reverse the procedures above to obtain the pressure pf(x, t) for a given
complex amplitude Pfxo at x ¼ xo. It is important to indicate the location of the
complex amplitude of pressure when handling any complex amplitudes.
11.1.2
Deﬁnition of Acoustic Impedance
Three types of impedances are deﬁned below and will be explained in the following
sections:

In the impedances above, P is the complex amplitude of pressure, V is the
complex amplitude of velocity, S is the cross-section area of a pipe, and U is deﬁned
as the complex amplitude of velocity V multiplied by the cross-section area S.
Complex Acoustic Impedance
Based on the deﬁnition of acoustic impedance shown above, acoustic impedance is a
complex number because both pressure and velocity are formulated in complex.
Plane waves in a pipe usually result from the addition of incident waves (forward)
and reﬂected waves (backward). The combined acoustic impedance Zcof the com-
bined (forward and backward waves) is a complex number and can be formulated as
shown below:
Zc  Pf þ Pb
Uf þ Ub
f forward wave, b backward wave
ð
Þ
11.1
Complex Amplitude of Pressure and Acoustic Impedance
279

where Pf, Pb, Uf, and Ub are the complex amplitudes of pressures and volume ﬂow
rates.
Therefore, the complex acoustic impedance has the same two properties of the
complex amplitude of pressure as shown in Sect. 11.1 as:
•
Complex acoustic impedance are time-independent.
– That is, the time-dependent term is not included in the complex acoustic
impedance.
•
Complex acoustic impedance are location-dependent.
– That is, the complex acoustic impedance is the acoustic impedance at the
evaluated location.
Acoustic Impedances of One-Way Plane Waves (Real Numbers)
In general, combined acoustic impedance Zc of forward and backward waves is a
complex number.
For one-way plane waves such as forward plane waves and backward plane
waves, the acoustic impedances Zf and Zb are always real numbers. The acoustic
impedance Zcof the combined (forward and backward waves) is a complex number.
Acoustic impedances for both traveling waves and combined waves can be
formulated according to the pressure-velocity relationship as shown in Chapter 4 as:

waves, and the combined plane waves are listed below:

Proof of Formula 7E
Based on the law of conservation of energy, the power that goes into a system has to
equal the power that comes out of it:
(POWER IN) ¼ (POWER OUT)
Therefore, the summation of power on the left-hand side pipe equals the summa-
tion of power on the right-hand side pipe:

Pipe 3
Given:
Pipe 1: L1 ¼ 0.1 [m],S1 ¼ 0.5 [m2]
Pipe 2: L2 ¼ 0.1 [m],S2 ¼ 0.5 [m2]
Pipe 3: L3 ¼ 0.1 [m],S3 ¼ 0.5 [m2]
P f 3L ¼ 1; Pb3L ¼ 0
At 1000 Hz, calculate:
(a) The complex acoustic impedance Zc1L of the combined wave at the LHS of Pipe

(b) The complex amplitude of pressure of both the forward wave (Pf1L) and back-
ward wave (Pb1L) at the LHS of Pipe 1
(c) The power transmission coefﬁcient Tw
Hint: Doing this example by hand can be difﬁcult because the complex acoustic

provided in the MATLAB program section (Sect. 11.8) for this example. The
same results can be obtained with any suitable programming languages

Chapter 12
Filters and Resonators
In the previous chapter, we deﬁned and derived formulas of complex amplitudes,
acoustic impedance, and power transmission in the pipeline. In this chapter, we will
extend the analysis of pipelines (pipes without side branches) to pipeline with side
branches. Most of the formulas derived in the previous chapter will be reused in this
chapter. In fact, a pipeline with a side branch can be treated as a one-to-two pipeline.
The acoustic analysis of a one-to-two pipeline can be treated as a one-to-one pipeline
by an equivalent acoustic impedance for the two pipes.
Three basic types of ﬁlters will be introduced in the second half of this chapter:
low-pass ﬁlters (Sect. 12.3), high-pass ﬁlters (Sect. 12.4), and band-stop ﬁlters (Sect.
12.5) based on the principle of the Helmholtz resonator. This chapter will introduce
the fundamental principles, the formulas, and the power transmission coefﬁcient of
each type of ﬁlter.
A numerical method for modeling pipelines with side branches is included in this
chapter. A numerical project to model ﬁlters is provided without a solution. This
chapter is organized into the following sections:
Section 12.1 introduces one-to-two pipes. Formulas for calculating the equivalent
acoustic impedance of a one-to-two pipe are derived (Formulas 8A–8B) in this
section.
Section 12.2 introduces the power transmission of one-to-two pipes. Formulas for
calculating power reﬂection and transmission will be derived (Formulas 13A–13B)
in this section.
Section 12.3 introduces low-pass ﬁlters. A formula for the power transmission
coefﬁcient of an open side branch as a low-pass ﬁlter will be derived in this section.
Section 12.4 introduces high-pass ﬁlters. A formula for the power transmission
coefﬁcient of a three pipeline as a high-pass ﬁlter will be derived in this section.
Section 12.5 introduces band-stop ﬁlters. A formula for the power transmission
coefﬁcient of the Helmholtz resonator as a band-stop ﬁlter is derived in this section.
Section 12.6 introduces a numerical method for calculating the power transmis-
sion coefﬁcients for ﬁlter designs. This method can be used to model all three basic
types of ﬁlters: high-pass ﬁlters, low-pass ﬁlters, and band-stop ﬁlters.

Proof 12: Solution
The pressure and velocity functions in the previous section are general solutions for
plane wave equations. The exact reﬂection and transmission pressures can be solved
by the boundary conditions at the intersection.
The boundary of the intersection of three pipes can be considered as a point, and
the following conditions must be satisﬁed:
(a) All pressures are equal in amplitude at the intersection
(related to Newton’s third law):
Pi þ Pr ¼ P1 ¼ P2

(b) The total ﬂow rate inward is equal to the total ﬂow rate outward
(based on the conservation of mass):

For traveling plane waves (forward and backward) in pipes:
•
The acoustic impedance Z is a real number.

Proof of Formula 13 D
Based on the conservation of energy, the power that goes into a system equals the
power that comes out of it:

Therefore, the summation of power on the left pipe is equal to the summation of
power on the upper pipe (Pipe 1) and the right pipe (Pipe 2):
wi þ wr ¼ w1 þ w2
ðFormula 13DÞ
Note that wi, w1, and w2 all do positive work, but wr does negative work due to the
negative impedance (180 phase difference between the pressure and velocity).
Dividing the equation above by wi yields the relationship between the power

Assumption #3: The acoustic impedance Z1 is calculated at:

Assume that the acoustic impedance is calculated at a distance r ¼ 8a

Note that the acoustic impedance is a complex number. More speciﬁcally speak-
ing, this acoustic impedance is an imaginary number. This imaginary number has a
phase separation of π
2 between the pressure and velocity:
Z1  p1
S1v1 = ρoc
S1 kre j π
2ð Þ
The π
2 phase angle indicates that there is a 90-degree phase difference between the
pressure and velocity. The phase difference is similar to the phase delay of the
damping of a structure. Also, the magnitude of the complex impedance is the ratio of
magnitudes of pressure to velocity.
For the purpose of simplicity, the acoustic impedance in Eq. (6) can be
condensed into:
Z1 ﬃj ρoc
S1 k 8a
3π ¼ j ρoc
Si kL0,
where
L0 ¼ 8Si

In addition, at the intersection of the main pipe, the impedance becomes:

Therefore:

Step 2: Calculate Pressure Ratio Using Equivalent Acoustic Impedance
A side branch on the pipe with a small hole to the outside medium behaves like a
high-pass ﬁlter when the length of the side branch is very short.
The high-pass ﬁlter can be considered as a special case of the one-to-two pipe
with the length of the side branch being zero, as analyzed in the previous section:

of pipeline series. The resonant of the side branch will absorb the resonant from the

Step 1: Derivation of the Dynamic Equation of the Resonator
The volume of ﬂuid in the neck area will act as a mass just as the open end of a
ﬂanged pipe for λ 	 a, where a is the radius of opening. The effective length of the
neck is assumed to be 0.85a longer than the actual length of the pipe if the pipe is
terminated with a wide ﬂange at the opening. If the pipe has an un-ﬂanged termina-
tion, it can be assumed that the effective length is longer only by 0.6a. Since the
344
12
Filters and Resonators

interior end of the neck acts like a ﬂanged termination, the effective length of the
neck with ﬂanged and un-ﬂanged termination to the outside medium becomes:
L0 = L þ 0:85 þ 0:85
ð
Þa ¼ L þ 1:70a
outer end flanged
ð
Þ
L0 = L þ 0:85 þ 0:60
ð
Þa ¼ L þ 1:45a
outer end un  flanged
ð
Þ
Using the effective length, the mass of ﬂuid moving in the neck is:
M ¼ ρoSL0
The mass in the neck works against the stiffness of the ﬂuid in volume V in
addition to resistance from the frictional forces in the neck and the radiation
impedance from the open end.
The stiffness of the ﬂuid in volume V is calculated from the change of volume
inside the container due to the motion of the mass in the neck. Hence, if ξ is the
displacement of the neck mass, the change in volume V is then given by:
Sξ ¼ ΔV
If Vo is the initial volume and V is the compressed volume, then ΔV ¼ V  Vo and
ρoVo ¼ ρV ¼ MV, since the mass MV of the volume V is preserved. Thus:
ΔV ¼ V  Vo ¼ MV
ρ  MV
ρo
¼ MV
ρ ∙ρo  ρ
ρo
¼ V ρ  ρo
ρo
¼ V Δρ
ρo
Dividing both sides of this equation by the volume V and using the relationship
above yield:
Sξ
V ¼  ΔV
V
¼ Δρ
ρo
¼ sac
where sac is the acoustic condensation. Now, using the relationship between acoustic
pressure and condensation (Δρ
ρo ¼
p
γP0 and c2 ¼ γP0
ρ0 ) from Chap. 2:
sac ¼
p
ρoc2
The acoustic pressure inside the given volume can thus be expressed as:
p ¼ ρoc2sac ¼ ρoc2 Sξ
V
12.5
Band-Stop Resonator
345

The force necessary to displace the ﬂuid in the neck is simply Sp ¼ Kξ where K is
the effective stiffness of the ﬂuid inside V. Multiplying both sides of the pressure
equation above by S yields:
Sp ¼ ρoc2 S2
V ξ ¼ Kξ
and the effective stiffness is:
K ¼ ρoc2 S2
V
In addition to the inertial and stiffness forces acting on the ﬂuid column in the
neck, there are also resistive forces that are proportional to the ﬂuid velocity. These
forces are due to the radiation resistance Rr and the viscous resistance Rω. These two
constants provide damping to the mechanical system since the force they create is
proportional to the velocity of the ﬂuid in the neck. Hence, the total mechanical
resistance coefﬁcient is given by:
Rm ¼ Rr þ Rω
where:
Rr ¼ 1

ð
Þ2

ð
Þ
Rr ¼ 1
4 ρocS ka
ð

un  flanged opening
ð
Þ
and:
Rω ¼ 2Mcαω
where αω is the absorption coefﬁcient for wall losses.
The mass-spring system described here is forced by the pressure wave of
p impinging on its opening. This force is simply the pressure of the wave multiplied
by the neck cross-section area. That is:
f ¼ Sp
Now the differential equation of the resonator can be written in terms of mass M,
stiffness K, and the damping coefﬁcient Rm given by the equations above as follows:

Note that the equations above show that all complex values, functions, or

we can always hide the conjugate part, but when we need a real-world solution, we
must show them.

Most acoustic ﬁlters can be modeled as a system of pipelines with side branches as
shown in the ﬁgure below. The main pipe is the vertical pipe, and the side branch is
the horizontal pipes in series as shown in the ﬁgure below:

Hint: Doing this example by hand can be difﬁcult because (1) the formula for
acoustic impedance is in complex number format and (2) power transmission
coefﬁcients need to be calculated at multiple frequencies. You can use the MATLAB
functions provided in Computer Code Section (Sect. 11.7) or any suitable program-
ming language for this project.

Appendix 1: Discrete Fourier Transform
In Chap. 9, sound pressure functions expressed with frequency contents were given
without explaining how to calculate them. Appendix 1 will demonstrate how to
convert a time domain function to a frequency domain function using the discrete
Fourier transform. This appendix can ﬁll the gap between the time domain function
and frequency domain function in Chap. 9.

Appendix 2: Power Spectral Density
In Sect. 9.3, the sound pressure level (SPL) spectrum of the octave band was
obtained by manually adding the frequency contents to their corresponding bands.
Practically, it is done using numerical methods. Appendix 2 will demonstrate how to
compute the SPL spectrum numerically using accumulated energy. This appendix
can be treated as a supplement to Sect. 9.3.
Power Spectral Density
The m-octave band spectrum is the power in each m-octave band and is typically
represented in levels (dB) (i.e., the logarithmic scale) and should be operated on log
level addition, subtraction, and averaging rules (see Sect. 9.1.3). The value is
typically power-like (power, energy, or intensity of the wave), but it could also be
non-power-like (RMS or peak amplitude of displacement, velocity, or acceleration
of the wave). When the amplitudes of displacement are used, the amplitudes are
usually squared, so that they are power-like and can be integrated or added among
368
Appendices

band frequencies. Whereas the amplitudes are squared, the spectrum is still called a
displacementspectrum but not a displacement square spectrum. When adding octave
band levels for speciﬁc physical quantities, care should be given to whether square
quantities are being added.
The power spectral density, S( f ), is the power per frequency (usually in Hz),
where the m-octave band spectrum is the power per m-octave band. Therefore, the
total power is computed as
R 1
0 S f
ð Þdf .
Accumulated Sound Pressure Square

However, for the different weighting can be applied to each band, we need to
