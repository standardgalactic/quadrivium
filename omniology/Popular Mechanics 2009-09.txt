Oen called upon for his 
knowledge of robots, Daniel 
Wilson recently started 
writing Ô¨Åction: two books 
for children and a fairy tale 
featuring a cast of robots 
for young adults. Aer 
completing a season as 
host of e Works on the 
History Channel, the 
roboticist is now discussing 
concepts for a television 
show and has just Ô¨Ånished 
a guide to the art of sibling 
smackdown, Bro-Jitsu, to 
come out early next year.


PM EDITOR‚ÄôS NOTES
J i m  M e i g s
E d i t o r - i n - C h i e f
We began planning the project in 
the San Francisco offices of M5, 
Jamie‚Äôs special-effects company. 
 Later, Jamie joined the PM team to 
test motorcycles in Death Valley  
(page 70). Then Adam and Jamie met 
with the entire PM editorial staff in 
our New York ofÔ¨Åces. We discussed 
story ideas, looked over photo shoots, 
and asked for feedback on every part 
of the magazine. Boy, did we get it.
 There might be some topic PM 
covers that neither Adam nor Jamie 
knows a frightening amount about‚Äî
but if so, we didn‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd it. You‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd 
their insights and editorial sugges-
tions peppered throughout the issue. 
Be My GueÔ¨Ü (Editors)
I S  T H E R E  A N Y T H I N G  T H E S E  G U Y S  C A N ‚Äô T  D O ? When I invited Adam 
Savage and Jamie Hyneman to guest edit an issue of PM, I didn‚Äôt know quite 
what to expect. But then, neither did they. As the stars of the Discovery Chan-
nel hit MythBusters, the pair spends a lot of time doing the same things we 
like to do: debunking junk science, building oddball contraptions, blowing 
stuff up ... And they‚Äôve been regular contributors to PM for more than three 
years. So it seemed high time to conduct our own MythBuster-style experi-
ment: Can two absurdly multitalented TV stars edit a magazine?
For our cover story, PM‚Äôs Larry Web-
ster spent a few days working with 
both men, seeing their gonzo engi-
neering methods Ô¨Årsthand. 
About his day in our ofÔ¨Åces, Adam 
says: ‚ÄúWhen I picture a magazine, I 
imagine the avuncular editors lead-
ing a team of erudite, funny, quirky 
and attractive people in bright meet-
ing rooms, with stimulating pictures 
on the wall, and evidence of advanced 
organization all over the place. The 
shocking thing was that your opera-
tion is exactly like that.‚Äù
For his part, Jamie says, ‚ÄúI Ô¨Ågured 
I‚Äôd have a corner office with a big 
desk at the Hearst Tower, and I could 
sit there smoking a cigar and fire 
people.‚Äù Hey, maybe next time, Jamie. 
That‚Äôs my job.
Wow, this is a 
lot easier than 
shooting a TV show, 
Adam thinks as he 
reviews photos with 
editor-in-chief Meigs. 
e MythBuÔ¨Üers‚Äô 
seventh season 
will air on the 
Discovery Channel 
Wednesdays at 
9 pm EST/PST, 
Ô¨Üarting in Oober.

 When searching for life on a

sure that any biologically derived 
molecules you Ô¨Ånd didn‚Äôt catch a  
ride from Earth on the spaceship.

KILLER ASTEROIDS‚ÄîAND 
THE BUGS THAT LOVE THEM 
About 3.9 billion years ago 
a long barrage of aÔ¨Üeroids, 
some as large as Kansas, 
pounded Earth and reshaped 
the surface of the planet. 
ScientiÔ¨Üs have long thought 
that the repeated impas 
wiped out any exiÔ¨Üing life. 
Now, a new NASA-funded 
Ô¨Üudy by geologiÔ¨Üs at the 
University of Colorado at 
Boulder counters that the 
bombardment may have 
created a subterranean 
breeding ground for heat-
loving microbes that Ô¨Çourish 
between 175 and 230 F. If 
they‚Äôre right, life could date 
back 4.4 billion years, to when 
the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü oceans are thought 
to have formed.
COLD TOMB FOR 
HOT WASTE 
  While the U.S. govern-
ment‚Äôs two-decade, $10 billion 
queÔ¨Ü to build a long-term 
nuclear-waÔ¨Üe repository in 
Nevada appears to be dead, 
other nations are pressing 
ahead with their own plans. 
e Swedish Nuclear Fuel and 
WaÔ¨Üe Management Company 
has been teÔ¨Üing disposal 
technology at a 2.5-mile 
network of tunnels dug out of 
granite more than 500 yards 
below the surface on the 
island of √Ñsp√∂.  e spent fuel 
will be encapsulated in copper 
and embedded in bentonite 
clay, then placed in holes in the 
bedrock. e Ô¨Ånal site was 
seleed in June; conÔ¨Üruion 
is scheduled to begin in 2016.
INSTANT DATE, JUST 
REMOVE WATER 
  British researchers have 
given archaeologiÔ¨Üs a new 
way to Ô¨Ånd the age of artifas 
when carbon-14 dating isn‚Äôt 
an option.  Rehydroxylation 
dating works with ceramics 
(such as the pottery shown 
here, from an excavated 
English theater) that gradually 
absorb water.  Researchers 
weigh a sample, then heat it 
to boil oÔ¨Ä all moiÔ¨Üure, then 
weigh it again to see how 
much water was removed. 
e scientiÔ¨Üs then expose the 
dried-out sample to water 
vapor to check how faÔ¨Ü the 
material soaks up moiÔ¨Üure. 
Put all those data points 
together, and you can derive 
an eÔ¨Üimate of when the 
sample was made. e 
technique has passed teÔ¨Üs on 
2000-year-old artifas, and 
the researchers say it can 
work for objes up to 10,000.
NEW SMOKE SIGNALS 
  A Defense Department 
research proje has produced 
‚Äúinfofuses‚Äù to help soldiers 
Ô¨Üay in touch when the power 
fails. Soldiers would light a 
fuse coated with metal dots 
that represent letters and

New Drilling for Ultra-Deep Geothermal ere is enough heat to 
produce near-endless power a few miles below Earth‚Äôs surface, but it‚Äôs expensive to 
access. Potter Drilling, a California-based Ô¨Üartup company, says that within a year it 
will begin Ô¨Åeld trials of a technology that uses superheated water inÔ¨Üead of 
conventional drills to bore through rock. Such a ‚Äúhydrothermal spallation‚Äù syÔ¨Üem could 
drill through granite up to Ô¨Åve times faÔ¨Üer than conventional processes do.

exiÔ¨Üing commercial vehicles inÔ¨Üead of 
building new ones.
Developed for a robotics class at MIT, 
autonomous gardeners use equipment 
mounted on the base of a Roomba.  
Sensors in the soil alert the robot, which 
waters plants and can use an articulated 
arm to pick any fruit it sees.
Prospects: MIT Ô¨ÜaÔ¨Ä have no immediate  
plans for commercialization, but they are 
continuing to create more autonomy in the 
bots. Future syÔ¨Üems could compare 
earlier images of the same plants over 
time to dete diseases or parasites.
Vision Robotics Vineyard Produs 
designed Snippy to prune as many as 400 
acres of grapevines per season, at around 
half the coÔ¨Ü of manual labor. Mounted 
cameras create a 3D model to tell the 
bot‚Äôs arms where to cut.

Agricultural robots are already among us: mowing grass, spraying peÔ¨Üicides and 
monitoring crops. For example, inÔ¨Üead of regularly dousing an entire apple orchard 
with chemicals, towed sensors Ô¨Ånd diseases or parasites with infrared sensors and 
cameras, and spray only the aÔ¨Äeed trees. But could a robot wholly replace a migrant 
worker? e idea appeals to farmers, because temporary labor can arrive one season 
but go elsewhere the next, leaving tons of fruits and vegetables to wither. Relying on 
illegal immigrants can also be a legal liability. HarveÔ¨Üing is the moÔ¨Ü labor-intensive 
aivity for many crops, but even advocates say that no one has built a machine that 
comes close to matching the sensory motor control of humans. at is poised to 
change as sensors and so	ware become cheaper and more advanced. ‚ÄúIn the next Ô¨Åve 
years or so, we‚Äôll see robots out in the Ô¨Åeld,‚Äù says Tony Stentz, associate direor of 
Carnegie Mellon University‚Äôs National Robotics Engineering Center. ‚ÄúAnd they‚Äôll lose 
their novelty. To the farmers, it‚Äôll juÔ¨Ü be another traor, with no one in the cab.‚Äù

A PARTICLE ACCELERATOR WILL PRODUCE THE WORLD‚ÄôS BRIGHTEST LIGHT AND

PEERING INTO INVISIBLE WORLDS
+ Workers have Ô¨Üarted conÔ¨Üruion on a particle accelerator at Brookhaven 
National Laboratory in Long Island, N.Y. When the National Synchrotron Light 
Source II is completed, in 2015, it will be the world‚Äôs moÔ¨Ü brilliant light 
source‚Äî10,000 times more powerful than the original NSLS, also located  
at Brookhaven. Elerons inside a ring with a half-mile circumference will 
accelerate to almoÔ¨Ü the speed of light, Ô¨Üeered by massive magnets. Any 
charged particle that moves in a curved path emits eleromagnetic radiation‚Äî
X-ray, ultraviolet and infrared light that can be focused in beams that research-
ers use to illuminate experiments. StaÔ¨Ä say the new $912 million facility will 
achieve a record-setting single-nanometer resolution.  
(For scale, the skin of a soap bubble is several hundred nm thick.) 
NSLS-II will shoot the beam through a series of magnets that 
have alternating poles, causing the beam to curve up and down. 
Every time the beam bends, the light is ampliÔ¨Åed.  
Researchers 
use light beams 
to examine tiny 
interaions, such 
as the inÔ¨Åltra-
tion of HIV into 
healthy cells.

e goal of moÔ¨Ü safety 
glasses is fairly modeÔ¨Ü: 
Prote eyes from impas. 
But considering their 
rigorous teÔ¨Üing regime‚Äî 
a Ô¨Üeel ball is Ô¨Åred at the

second, and a free-falling 
needle is dropped onto 
them from height‚Äîwe 
Ô¨Ågured they muÔ¨Ü be able 
to Ô¨Üand up to more abuse 
than their packaging claims. 
We took three pairs of $4 
safety glasses and set out 
to see exaly what they 
could do.  ‚Äî SETH PORGES
For this test, PM teamed up with Josh Zepps, host  
of the Science Channel‚Äôs Brink, for an episode to air 
Aug. 17 at 10:30 pm EST. You can see the test video 
at popularmechanics.com/abusivelabtest.
To simulate high-speed 
impas from sharp 
objes, we shot a Ô¨Üaple 
gun at the lenses.
qq
To teÔ¨Ü visibility aer 
years of use, we scoured 
the lenses with a 
power-driven wire brush.
qq
To represent a power 
tool gone awry, we used 
a drill on the lenses.
qq
To produce a high- 
heat environment, we  
took aim with a 
1000-degree heat gun.
qq
A Ô¨Üaple gun can Ô¨Åre rounds 
at 70 inch-pounds. at 
proved no match for our 
plaÔ¨Üic glasses‚Äîall three of 
which Ô¨Üopped a full roll of 
Ô¨Üeel Ô¨Üaples shot at 
point-blank range. And while 
every Ô¨Åh or so Ô¨Üaple ended 
up embedded in the lenses, 
not one shot fully penetrated 
the plaÔ¨Üic, and our 
mannequins‚Äô eye areas 
remained unharmed.
AlmoÔ¨Ü inÔ¨Üantly, the spinning 
brass wire scraped away all 
of the lenses‚Äô visibility. But 
the plaÔ¨Üic proved an 
impermeable barrier: Even 
when the power driver spun 
the brush at full power, no 
briÔ¨Üles could get through to 
the head behind. 
Stray swipes of our power 
drill proved no problem for 
the lenses‚Äîit took several 
seconds of concentrated 
drilling to punure the 
plaÔ¨Üic, something that  
is highly unlikely to occur  
by accident.
None of our safety glasses 
were designed to serve as a 
heat shield, but we couldn‚Äôt 
resiÔ¨Ü seeing how they 
handled 1000 degrees F. 
Within seconds, the foam 
faces began to melt, Raiders 
of the LoÔ¨Ü Ark‚ÄìÔ¨Üyle. Soon 
aer, the plaÔ¨Üic lenses 
turned to jelly, before 
hardening into sharp points. 
But by then, our mannequins 
had little face le to poke.

All three models did exaly what they claimed to do, providing an impressive amount of 
proteion againÔ¨Ü impas. Safety glasses coÔ¨Ü $4. ReconÔ¨Üruive surgery coÔ¨Üs much more.

Spare 5-gallon buckets can be used as Ô¨Üilts, Ô¨Üools, trash

snaps onto any Ô¨Üandard 5-gallon bucket, creating a 
high-power wet/dry vac capable of moving 30 gallons of 
water per minute (in teÔ¨Üs, it Ô¨Ålled its receptacles in about 5

We are navigating the narrow Ô¨Üreets 
of Alexandria, Va., to teÔ¨Ü the mettle of 
the Transit Conne in a cramped 
urban environment. e van‚Äôs goofy 
high roof and billboard-like slab sides 
might have repelled shoppers a 
decade ago. But American sensibilities 
have evolved. And so Ford imported its 
fuel-eÔ¨Écient commercial delivery truck 
from Europe. A tiny 136-hp 2.0-liter is 
matched to a four-speed automatic, 
so don‚Äôt expe sprightly thruÔ¨Ü in this 
3470-pound trucklet. e high driving 
position and tall windows create 
superb forward visibility, and optional 
rear backup sensors aid parallel 
parking. e $21,475 van gets  
22 mpg city and 25 mpg highway‚Äî
two faors that should help attra a 
new commercial crowd.  ‚Äî DAN CARNEY

As poised as the four-cylinder Acura 
TSX is, a quick scan of the spec sheet 
would probably send torque junkies to 
more powerful paÔ¨Üures. at car has 
juÔ¨Ü 170 lb- ‚Äînot exaly the Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä of 
our quarter-mile dreams. Acura 
decided the TSX needed a bit more 
muscle, so the company shoehorned 
in the 280-hp V6 from the larger TL. 
Plant your right foot in a four-cylinder 
TSX and you‚Äôll wait until the tach hits 
high noon before you feel the grunt of 
the motor. But the $35,660 V6 model 
leaves the line with a torquey thruÔ¨Ü as 
the Ô¨Üeering wheel dances in your grip 
ever so slightly. On our drive through 
the Santa Monica Mountains, the 
Ô¨Üeering felt heavier and a touch 
quicker too. Bend into a gentle 
sweeper and this sedan generates 
smiles. e V6 experience is also more 
serene than in the base TSX‚Äîthis Six 
is deliciously smooth.  ‚Äî BEN STEWART

Breakthrough Tech
e new S400 Hybrid is the Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü 
series-produion car to use lithium-ion 
batteries‚Äîan energy-dense design 
automakers see as the future Ô¨Üandard 
for eleric vehicles. e S400 runs an 
Atkinson-cycle (a longer expansion cycle 
for optimal eÔ¨Éciency) 275-hp 3.5-liter 
V6 paired to a slim, disc-shaped AC 
eleric motor that Ô¨Åts neatly between 
the engine and the seven-speed 
automatic. When called upon, the 
eleric motor adds 20 hp and 118 lb- 
of torque. Since the combined 
motivation adds up to almoÔ¨Ü 300 hp, 
acceleration is brisk for the 5 seconds 
of full assiÔ¨Ü the eleric motor provides. 
Driven sanely, the $90,000 S400 will 
return 23 mpg city and 33 on the 
highway. Not bad for a 4500-pound 
luxury car. ‚Äî BARRY WINFIELD
FaÔ¨Ü and Frugal
Its thrilling brothers the Z06 and the 
ZR1 have hogged the Corvette 
spotlight, but the $49,515 base model 
has the greateÔ¨Ü range of talents. It‚Äôs 
bliÔ¨Üeringly quick and mild-mannered 
around town, and it holds plenty of 
luggage. MoÔ¨Ü amazing of all, the base 
Corvette is good for 16 mpg city and 
26 mpg highway. So could we Ô¨Üretch 
that economy with a feathery touch on 
the throttle? We borrowed a Corvette 
coupe equipped with the six-speed 
manual, chose a seion of Highway 
101 north of Santa Barbara, Calif., 
unlikely to be crammed with traÔ¨Éc,  
and set out to eke every laÔ¨Ü mpg out of 
this world-class sports car. We ran at  
55 mph with cruise control for about 
150 miles. Back at the pump, we 
refueled and saw 32.8 mpg. at‚Äôs  
32.8 mpg from a sports car that will 
top out at over 190 mph. Impressive.   
‚Äî JOHN PEARLEY HUFFMAN
It‚Äôs no secret 
how the Corvette 
returns such great 
mileage. e car 
has an impressive 
drag coeÔ¨Écient of 
0.28. And the sixth 
gear ratio of 0.50:1 
overdrive when 
combined with the 
3.42:1 axle allows 
the engine to turn 
very slowly at mod-
eÔ¨Ü cruising speeds. 
e result is fuel 
economy that can 
hit the 30s.

Plug-in Volt
e Chevy Volt is perhaps the moÔ¨Ü anticipated vehicle in 
GM‚Äôs long hiÔ¨Üory. And with around 18 months le before the 
plug-in hits showrooms, we had a chance to slide behind the 
wheel of a prototype at GM‚Äôs Warren Tech Center. On our 
drive, GM disabled the car‚Äôs internal-combuÔ¨Üion engine and 
charging syÔ¨Üem. But that‚Äôs okay, because the car moves 
entirely on eleric power at all times. e gas engine is used 
to suÔ¨Üain the charge. e Volt may be a radical departure from 
traditional automotive engineering, but driving the teÔ¨Ü mule 
proved remarkably unremarkable. It was like any common 
sedan. Besides its silence, the Volt gives no clue of the 
underlying tech. e Volt did feel heavy, thanks to four people 
onboard and a hoÔ¨Ü of teÔ¨Ü gear. But the propulsion is as 
liquid-smooth as the lateÔ¨Ü luxury sedans‚Äô.  ‚Äî KEVIN A. WILSON
e Volt‚Äôs drivetrain uses a  
120-kilowatt AC induion eleric 
motor that generates 273 lb- of 
torque. It draws power from a 16-kwh 
pack of more than 200 lithium-ion 
cells. e Volt can travel 40 miles on  
a full charge, before the 1.4-liter 
range-extending gasoline engine 
begins to charge the pack.

Ford claims the new 
Taurus SHO and its 
twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 provide the 
power of a V8 with the fuel economy of 
a V6. We‚Äôre skeptical, because paÔ¨Ü 
turbo motors were notoriously thirÔ¨Üy. 
But improved turbocharger technology 
and dire fuel injeion suggeÔ¨Ü Ford 
might have the hardware to back up this 
claim. To teÔ¨Ü the SHO and its fuel-
saving potential, we lined up the perfe 
foil, a Chrysler 300C AWD. Dimension-
ally, the Chrysler is within inches of the 
Ford, shares all-wheel drive and has only 
Ô¨Åve fewer ponies. A big 5.7-liter V8, 
however, reÔ¨Üs behind that gangÔ¨Üa 
grille. So to help booÔ¨Ü the Hemi‚Äôs fuel 
economy, a multi-displacement syÔ¨Üem 
automatically shuts oÔ¨Ä four cylinders 
when they‚Äôre not needed. Both pencil 
out right around 45 grand.  So let‚Äôs see 
how they match up.
Aer burning 
through three 
tankfuls, the tale 
at the pump 
became clear. 
Overall, the SHO 
returned 5.5 
percent better fuel 
economy. We can‚Äôt 
credit the turbo 
engine entirely (the 
SHO‚Äôs gearbox has 
an extra gear), but 
it‚Äôs certainly a 
contributing faor. 
Quicker and more 
eÔ¨Écient? e Ford 
Taurus SHO wins. 
In juÔ¨Ü two days, we ran 
a four-Ô¨Üate, 1000-mile 
odyssey. We covered plenty of highway 
miles, city Ô¨Üints and a good Ô¨Çogging on 
our favorite back roads‚ÄîÔ¨Ürily for teÔ¨Ü 
purposes, of course. Consecutive 
12-hour days in the saddle would have 
been punishing if these two were not 
both exceedingly comfortable sedans. 
ey‚Äôre both quiet too, but the overall 
edge goes to the SHO. e Ford is not 
only a tick quicker on the dragÔ¨Ürip; it‚Äôs 
also devoid of turbo lag‚Äîit delivers 
smooth, uninterrupted thruÔ¨Ü. Each of 
these cars weighs more than 2 tons, yet 
they‚Äôre more willing to change direion 
than you‚Äôd expe. In the twiÔ¨ÜieÔ¨Ü turns, 
the 300C felt livelier, but the SHO 
required fewer midcourse correions 
and cornered Ô¨Çatter. e SHO‚Äôs brakes, 
however, faded quickly. Our advice? Get 
the optional performance pads.

For General Motors, the 
worÔ¨Ü is over‚Äîmaybe. e 
once-sprawling company is 
down to four brands. It‚Äôs 
axed nearly half its dealer

and successfully thrown 
itself at the mercy of the

were at the lumbering giant 
that analyÔ¨Üs regarded all 
that as the good news. 
e queÔ¨Üion is, What

bankruptcy, GM insiders are 
promising a Lazarus a, in

Stephens, GM‚Äôs vice 
chairman of global produ 
development, says. 
Assuming the market 
returns to pre-crash sales 
levels, the arithmetic looks 
better than that. ‚ÄúOnce it 
gets back to 13 to 14 million 
units, you will see proÔ¨Åts like 
we haven‚Äôt seen in this 
induÔ¨Üry for a long time,‚Äù 
David Cole, chairman of the 
Center for Automotive 
Research, says.
Ironically, General 
Motors could end up in a 
healthier position than the 
only big U.S. automaker that 
Ô¨Üayed out of chapter 11

Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in 
hybrid (see page 36 for an 
early teÔ¨Ü drive), and a 
Cadillac version of the

company should Ô¨Üart 
building Volts in late 2010.
But one line of cars, no 
matter how innovative, 
won‚Äôt save GM‚Äîor return 
those billions to the federal 
balance sheet. Stephens 
insiÔ¨Üs that more advanced 
technologies are in the 
works: ‚ÄúI have not taken any 
of them oÔ¨Ä the table,‚Äù he 
says. Hall, for one, believes 
him: ‚Äúey‚Äôve tried to cut as 
little out of engineering and 
design as possible.‚Äù  
Will the emphasis on 
green tech mean the end of 
cars that are fun to drive? 
Will the V8 engine survive? 
Stephens says yes. ‚ÄúBottom 
line: You will Ô¨Üill be able to 
purchase performance 
vehicles from GM.‚Äù 
So: If overall vehicle 
sales bounce back, and if 
shoppers embrace a 
reformed GM, and if the 
Volt pays oÔ¨Ä, and if those 
new technologies have an 
impa, the company could 
recover. America‚Äôs 
taxpayers-turned-inveÔ¨Üors 
might even see a proÔ¨Åt from 
their GM holdings. Let‚Äôs 
hope so‚Äîaer all, it‚Äôs our

Note the word ‚Äúaided‚Äù 
in the name, though. 
Computers don‚Äôt do the 
designing; engineers and 
designers do. If people 
don‚Äôt bring good stuff to 
the project, the results 
will usually not be good. 
The problem isn‚Äôt ‚Äújunk 
in, junk out.‚Äù Even if you 
start out with a junk con-
cept, CAD can help gener-
ate something that works. 
It may be overly compli-
cated and impractical to 
build or service, but it can 
still be functional. This is 
a classic example of the 
killing-snakes-with-a-
shovel school of design, 
where you Ô¨Ågure out solu-
tions to problems as they 
arise, instead of becoming familiar 
with and internalizing the project as 
a whole Ô¨Årst, and then coming up 
with a clean, elegant design. 
We ran into a problem like this 
on the show. I needed to change the 
battery on a car we were using to run 
some tests. Because the cooling sys-
tem and other hardware were 
located over the battery, I had the 
choice of removing the right front 
wheel and inner fender or disman-
tling the cooling system to get to the 
battery. This wasn‚Äôt an exotic car 
that you might expect to have some 
impractical aspects. This was your 
average American midsize sedan. I 
decided to remove the wheel, and it 
took me about 10 times longer to 
hese days, CAD‚Äîor computer-aided design‚Äî
touches nearly every aspect of our lives, from 
the cars we drive to the tools we use. These 
graphics programs enable engineers and 
designers to create parts or entire machines in 
the virtual world of the computer before build-
ing them in the physical world. CAD is one of 
the most important inventions of our time‚Äî
a powerful tool for testing materials, experi-
menting with conÔ¨Ågurations and, ultimately, 
turning ideas into reality.
I boot up CAD programs regularly for builds 
on MythBusters, and consider them to be indis-
pensable tools. For one episode, I used Solid-
Works CAD software to analyze a seesaw design 
with a lightweight but extremely complex truss 
structure. That seesaw ended up withstanding 
a 100,000-foot-pound force, and yet I could pick 
it up and walk around with it.

replace the battery than it 
should have. I was aston-
ished‚Äîthe person who 
designed that car clearly 
had never changed a bat-
tery. The battery Ô¨Åt in CAD, 
and it Ô¨Åt in the car, but what 
was an elegant fit in the 
computer was a problem in 
the real world. I can just see the 
designer in front of his computer 
stufÔ¨Ång the car‚Äôs components into 
available spaces without a clue as to 
what he was doing.  
To my way of thinking, an engi-
neer‚Äôs work is better if he has a foun-
dation of hands-on experience. If he 
has memories of his own blood 
smeared on his tools, his approach to 
a mechanical problem will be differ-
ent than if most of his insights arise 
while sitting in front of a computer.
Let‚Äôs look at a staple of home-
repair toolboxes: the pipe wrench. 
You just know it was designed by a  
guy who needed to get a job done in 
close quarters, and it was based on 
bleeding knuckles. The jaw is at 
90 degrees to the handle, 
which is unlike any stan-
dard wrench. The heft of 
the tool, the rounded 
shapes of the pieces‚Äîall 
of these features were 
informed by users with 
years of experience in the 
field. And there‚Äôs a great 
deal of slop‚Äîloose toler-
ances of all the moving 
parts‚Äîso that the wrench 
still works with rust, dirt 
and gunk all over it. The 
slop also means that the 
more torque you apply, the 
more the components 
shift, and the tighter the 
jaws bite into the pipe. 
Sometimes slop is our 
friend, but I‚Äôve never seen 
it on a pull-down menu. 
Extremely complex 
designs, such as those for 
airliners, do beneÔ¨Åt from 
CAD. The software is well-
suited for focusing on 
individual parts and reÔ¨Ån-
ing them‚Äîhow thin can 
you make this component 
without it breaking? You run a Ô¨Ånite 
element analysis on it and see that 
you need to make it a little thicker 
here, but thinner there, and all told 
you can cut the weight of that com-
ponent by 50 percent. That‚Äôs won-
derful. CAD can help you save fuel or 
make a plane safer.
Airliners are chock-full of CAD 
components, so it‚Äôs seductive to 
think that solutions presented by 
software are the only way to go. But 
here again, plumber-with-wrench 
insights are crucial. The plane as a 
whole has evolved out of decades of 
Ô¨Çight experience that had nothing to 
do with CAD. What we know about 
structural weak points, aerodynam-
ics and peak loads on engines came 
from thousands of people 
who contributed over dec-
ades to that design with the 
fear of falling out of the sky 
forefront in their thoughts. 
Those people internalized 
whole sections of the air-
craft and understood how 
all of its various compo-
nents worked together, and that 
knowledge has informed modern-
day design. Just because we now have 
CAD doesn‚Äôt mean all that hands-on 
experience is moot.
CAD is just another tool, like a 
pipe wrench. There are things it‚Äôs 
good for, and things it‚Äôs not. The 
point is that the designer needs to 
understand the job a pipe wrench is 
intended to do, in his head, before 
going to CAD. I think it ought to be 
obligatory for anyone engineering 
parts for an airliner to go sky diving 
at least once before he sits down in 
front of his computer. I mean, who 
really understands what a hammer 
is if he hasn‚Äôt hit his thumb with one 
a couple of times?

dimples in a golf ball, anyway?
First, Jamie tries to set ball bearings into the golf-ball 
depressions. When none Ô¨Åt, he switches to washers and dis-
covers that an 8-32 washer is a perfect match. He scales the 
tiny washer to a larger one and clamps it to the 5/8-inch spade 
bit that he‚Äôll use to drill the dimples in the bowling ball. After 
tracing the new curve onto the bit, he grinds away extra 
material‚Äîa custom tool in 10 minutes. 
He hauls out an old bowling ball that the MythBusters 
shot out of a homemade cannon (episode 118). They sanded 
the ball to Ô¨Åt in the cannon, so it‚Äôs not smooth enough to 
repurpose‚Äîa favorite MythBuster strategy‚Äîbut it‚Äôll do as a 
test piece. Using a sheet of thin plastic, Jamie makes a tem-
plate to mark where the dimples should go and tries a few 
test depressions. Satisfied with the technique, he yells 
upstairs to see if his lone intern is back with a fresh ball. 
Nope. Jamie grimaces. He has 51/2 hours to Ô¨Ånish the build.
Meanwhile, Adam breezes into the wood shop and sets a 
plastic remote-control model car down on a workbench; trail-
ing behind is Huxley, Adam‚Äôs medium-size mutt. Since the 
NASA wind tunnel is too small to accommodate a full-size car, 
Adam is going to use the toy to make a mold for two model 
M5‚Äôs second-Ô¨Çoor ofÔ¨Åces could be those 
of any small company, with cluttered 
desks, a computer room and a small kitchen. 
Whiteboards are everywhere, crammed with top-
of-the-brain doodles, rough technical drawings and the com-
plex logistics of planning the MythBusters shooting sched-
ule. In recent years, special-effects work has taken a back 
seat to the relentless demands of the show, and M5 today 
functions primarily as home base for the MythBusters pro-
duction team. (The show‚Äôs secondary segments, involving 
the team of Kari Byron, Grant Imahara and Tory Belleci, are 
produced at a different location.)
On this Monday morning, the crew is deep into an epi-
sode testing the question of whether golf-ball-like dimples 
on a car body could reduce aerodynamic drag and improve 
fuel economy. Compared to crashing two semi trucks head-
on (episode 41) or trying to tip over a remote-control city bus 
(episode 115), today‚Äôs challenge might seem straightforward. 
But Jamie and Adam still have to clear some daunting engi-
neering hurdles‚Äîwhile sticking to the show‚Äôs breakneck 
production schedule.
MythBusters attracts nearly 2 million viewers per episode, 
making the six-year-old series one of the most enduring hits 
on cable television. Its two stars have become global celebri-
ties, much in demand for speaking engagements and confer-
ences. So visitors to the workshop may wonder: Where is the 
entourage? Where is the army of shop workers to do the 
grunt work? A handful of production coordinators handle 
the ofÔ¨Åce telephones, but the usual Hollywood scrum of per-
sonal assistants, publicists, cappuccino wranglers and the 
like is nowhere in evidence.
Jamie, it turns out, is already at work in the machine shop 
downstairs. I Ô¨Ånd him at a worktable, using calipers to meas-
ure the diameter of a bowling ball. He switches to a golf ball, 
taking measurements that he transfers to a pad, muttering 
numbers to himself. He and Adam intend to experiment on a 
real car, but like all good eggheads, they also want laboratory 
data. They‚Äôve booked time at a nearby NASA wind tunnel, 
where their Ô¨Årst test will try to establish just how much those 
dimples really do reduce aerodynamic drag on a golf ball.
Unfortunately, they‚Äôve learned that an actual golf ball 
is too small to produce accurate data. Solution: Jamie has 
decided to drill dimples into the surface of a bowling ball 
to create a giant, scaled-up model of a golf ball, one big 
enough to test in a wind tunnel. Which leads him to the 
question he is now pondering: Just how deep are those

MIG Welder
If I could have only one 
welder, it would be MIG. 
There are times when 
you have to use a TIG 
for high-performance 
welds and a stick welder 
for coarse work. But 
MIG is the easiest, 
fastest way to weld. And 
the most versatile‚Äîyou 
can use it 90 percent of 
the time.
Steel Square Tubing
This 1-inch tubing 
makes for easily welded 
joints and light, stiff 
structures.
Dust Collectors
They improve the 
overall workÔ¨Çow.  
Dust collectors are  
the difference between 
a shop that works 
powerfully and one  
that limps along.

cars‚Äîone with dimples, one without. He moves to a table saw 
and cuts a piece of Trupan, a lightweight Ô¨Åberboard that he‚Äôll 
use to Ô¨Åll some of the mold‚Äôs casting volume. Huxley doesn‚Äôt 
bark or bolt at the sound of the saw‚Äîa real MythBuster dog. 
In less time than it takes to read this sentence, Adam test-Ô¨Åts 
the workpiece in the model and adjusts the saw fence three 
times. He cuts the rest of the pieces so quickly that it seems 
remarkable he has all his Ô¨Ångers.
On TV, Jamie, 52, comes across as the cerebral engineer, 
while Adam, 42, plays the role of the manic artist. In person, 
that distinction is even more pronounced. Adam races into 
every task, often working by eye and tweaking the design as 
he goes. And no build is considered Ô¨Ånished until he has 
added some trademark visual Ô¨Çourish. His internal throttle is 
always on full. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nobody faster than Adam,‚Äù says Alice 
Dallow, the director of the show‚Äôs Jamie and Adam segments. 
‚ÄúHe Ô¨Ågures it out on the Ô¨Çy.‚Äù
THE SOUTH HALF OF THE GROUND FLOOR OF M5 IS A 
wide-open space Ô¨Ålled with obscure fasteners, actuators, bat-
teries, welders, stacks of plywood‚Äîall the tools you can 
imagine, even an automated CNC milling machine. It‚Äôs a 
serious bit of kit, a dream shop for any backyard tinkerer.
The space is meticulously laid out and organized. Every-
thing is labeled. Most tools rest on open shelves for quick 
retrieval. It‚Äôs neat, almost surgically antiseptic. Jamie talks 
T H E  M Y T H B U S T E R  G U I D E  TO  G O N Z O  E N G I N E E R I N G
about the place as though it‚Äôs a church, which probably reso-
nates with anyone who has a favorite shop. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a living, 
breathing organism,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIts character has been formed 
by the experiences inside.‚Äù
The south wall is dramatically deÔ¨Åned by metal shelves 
that rise to the 20-foot ceiling. On those shelves are 600 
labeled crates‚ÄîFoliage, Suits and Booties, Tank Parts. One 
container, way up high, is labeled Blendo. Tucked inside is 
the killer robot that started it all. 
When Adam worked for M5, he and Jamie collaborated 
on the mischievously named Blendo and entered it twice in 
an annual San Francisco event called Robot Wars. The now-
defunct competition featured robots dueling to the death, 
the nerd version of a steel-cage match. Blendo‚Äôs outer skin 
is an inverted wok; two opposing blades jut menacingly 
from the base. The bot spins as it moves; in the ring, it shred-
ded opposing machines, Ô¨Çinging shrapnel into the crowd. 
Both years, after Blendo won its Ô¨Årst two matches, organiz-
ers awarded it the heavyweight prize‚Äîand then prohibited 
it from completing the competition because of concerns 
about safety. But in 2002 when Discovery Channel produc-
ers were casting a new show called MythBusters, somebody 
remembered Blendo. Jamie got a call. ‚ÄúI Ô¨Ågured the odds of 
the show turning into anything were lower than the odds of 
getting hit by lightning,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSo, excited? Well, no, not 
really. I rarely get excited.‚Äù
In retrospect, Jamie‚Äôs Ô¨Årst choice for a co-host‚ÄîAdam‚Äî
seems surprising. After all, Adam had lasted only a few years 
at M5. As much as Adam‚Äôs speed was a huge asset in the 
notoriously fast-paced special-effects industry, the two men 
sometimes butted heads over the mess the Adam whirlwind 
leaves behind.  
While they‚Äôre not best friends‚Äî‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt hang out,‚Äù 
Jamie says‚Äîthey have learned to appreciate each other. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nobody that either of us would rather work with,‚Äù 
he continues, ‚Äúbecause we know we‚Äôre both capable in our 
own style.‚Äù Adam adds: ‚ÄúWe can drive each other nuts, but 
there‚Äôs a commonality between us that makes collaborating 
such a pleasure. We both work very hard to get a concept into 
our heads, and then we work very hard to trade back and 
forth what we‚Äôre thinking through a process called arguing.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat back and forth is comparable to a couple of dogs 
that have gotten hold of a towel and then start yanking on it,‚Äù 
I designed and built 
these tables to save 
Ô¨Çoor space and 
increase countertop

workshop. The two

tubing frames are

secured to its frame; 
when the frames 
nest, it rests on the

When expanded, 
most nesting tables 
have stepped-down 
surfaces. With my 
design, when I 
slide out the inner 
table and move its 
top into place, it‚Äôs 
Ô¨Çush with the 
outer top, 
doubling the 
work-surface area.

and researched different industries,‚Äù he 
says. ‚ÄúThe effects industry seemed to be 
the perfect place for my natural mechanical 
aptitude and the skills I‚Äôd picked up along the 
way. Plus, it was possible to earn a living doing 
something fun. Everyone should do what they Ô¨Ånd fun, 
because if you do, your passion leads to success.‚Äù
ADAM‚ÄôS HOME WORKSHOP REFLECTS THE INSPIRATION 
he Ô¨Ånds in ‚Äúa certain amount of visual cacophony.‚Äù With lim-
ited space at his urban address, he jams an alarming number 
of tools and old props into a 10 x 12 room off an under-
ground, single-car garage. In the suburbs the space would be 
a good-size walk-in closet. 
At Ô¨Årst glance the workshop looks like the lair of a classic 
pack rat, but closer inspection reveals an order to the mad-
ness. Below a workbench are 22 Sortimo organizers Ô¨Ålled 
with ‚Äúall the fasteners I‚Äôll need forever.‚Äù Shelves cover every 
wall and even the lone window. Spools of wire hang behind 
the door. ‚ÄúI hate looking for things,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúA good shop 
has to have Ô¨Årst-order retrievability, so I don‚Äôt have to move 
anything to get to what I need.‚Äù 
The shelves hold an eclectic mix of artifacts, like a vintage 
stopwatch and a medieval armored glove, as well as some 
unÔ¨Ånished projects. In his limited spare time, Adam pains-
takingly re-creates movie props. He built a working R2-D2 
and a copy of the Maltese Falcon. He‚Äôs currently reproducing 
the Zorg ZF-1 egg gun from the movie The Fifth Element and 
is relishing the art of gunsmithing. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm almost done with 
it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been working on it for, like, 12 years.‚Äù) His 
off-hours work seems to favor his artistic side, like the King 
Kong statue he‚Äôs painting, but he thinks it‚Äôs wrong to sepa-
rate art from engineering. ‚ÄúSomeone who designs a really 
Jamie says. ‚ÄúThe process shakes out a lot of 
things we would otherwise miss, and by the 
time we‚Äôre done arguing and batting things 
back and forth, we‚Äôve got the solution.‚Äù
Jamie is extremely methodical, a classic 
engineer type, taking in information, 
turning it over in his mind and then out-
putting a response. ‚ÄúHe thinks every-
thing through before he starts,‚Äù Dallow 
says. ‚ÄúAnd his build will be as simple as 
you can possibly imagine. He‚Äôs not inter-
ested in fancy color schemes.‚Äù
Jamie is the Spock of the team; logic 
trumps all with him. He shows little emo-
tion‚Äîunlike Adam, who sometimes wears a 
T-shirt that reads, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the excitable one.‚Äù It‚Äôs not 
that Jamie lacks passion; he‚Äôs just deadpan about it. 
A discussion about a favorite project‚Äîsay, the life-size robots 
parked under the stairs‚Äîcan turn into an entertaining and 
instructive lecture. He built the wheeled bots, which look 
straight out of a 1950s sci-Ô¨Å movie, in just three weeks for a GE 
commercial. Their signature feature is what Jamie calls a 
superjoint, which simulates an elbow joint. (He‚Äôs applied for 
a patent on the design.) With two cordless electric-drill motors 
(‚Äúone of my favorite powerplants‚Äù) mounted in line with the 
upper arm and hooked to the side gears of a differential gear-
box, he designed an arm that functions like the real thing. 
Spin both motors in the same direction to raise the forearm; 
reverse one motor to rotate the hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs twice the power for 
any movement without adding any weight,‚Äù he says. 
Jamie finds inspiration at swap meets and hardware 
stores, keeping a ‚Äúrolling inventory‚Äù of material that 
may prove useful. To solve particularly tough problems, 
however, he goes into Jamie-land‚Äîa metaphorical room 
of a certain size and shape. ‚ÄúI get on a treadmill and start 
walking,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like hitting a switch. Once I‚Äôm in that 
room, I re-create the parts I‚Äôm working on. I pull in one part 
after another and move them around, trying things. An hour 
later, it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt know what happened. I just wake up, 
soaking wet from the exertion. The problem was solved but 
I was totally unaware of time passing.‚Äù
He grew up in Indiana, studied Russian linguistics at 
Indiana University (‚Äúit was interesting at the time‚Äù), owned 
a Caribbean dive shop and worked as a boat captain. 
Although landing in the special-effects industry might seem 
like the hand of fate, it was planned. ‚ÄúI went to the library 
Sometimes I buy 
cheap tools and 
modify them.

trial Light & Magic, the special-effects outfit founded by 
George Lucas. Then came Jamie‚Äôs call to join MythBusters. 
Back at the worktable, with a cameraman Ô¨Ålming over his 
shoulder, Adam coats the inside of the mold with wax and 
then with a layer of mold-release spray. The delicate model-car 
mold is the only one available; if Adam damages it, the shoot 
is over. So he very carefully ensures that every corner is cov-
ered. The two-part polyurethane resin generates heat as it 
reacts, which could distort the mold. He has to make two mod-
els with it, so he pours in a small amount of the resin to form 
an insulating layer. After a few minutes, he puts on a breathing 
Ô¨Ålter and mixes the resin with glass microballoons, a Ô¨Åller 
good carburetor is going through the same process as a 
painter,‚Äù he says.
Growing up outside New York City, Adam had free rein 
with his father‚Äôs hardware-store charge account. He worked 
alongside machinists and welders, picking up skills on the 
job. He studied drama at New York University, worked with 
robotic sculptor Chico MacMurtrie and Ô¨Ånally landed in San 
Francisco‚Äôs special-effects community. His reputation for 
quick problem-solving and construction‚Äî‚ÄúI like screwing it 
up twice and still doing it better than the guy who did it 
once‚Äù‚Äîled to the gig building props for Jamie at M5. After 
M5, Adam worked at a toy company and then joined Indus-

Sortimo System
I bought a bunch of suitcase-size 
tool sorters and Ô¨Ålled them with 
every nut and bolt I‚Äôll ever need. The 
cases slide under my workbench, 
and they‚Äôre labeled on the side so I 
can Ô¨Ånd everything. And I can Ô¨Åt the 
cases in the back of my truck.
Adam‚Äôs home workshop is juÔ¨Ü 120 square feet, so Sortimo cases are key in optimizing the limited Ô¨Üorage space.

Adam shows his model-making artiÔ¨Üry with re- 
creations of classic movie props, like King Kong and the

material. He pours in the mixture, 
sets in the Trupan blocks and 
puts the mold aside. Cut! 
AS FUN AS IT IS TO WATCH 
Jamie and Adam produce 
mechanical oddities, it‚Äôs 
interesting to see how the 
MythBuster team has rein-
forced the value of science, 
engineering and the art of build-
ing things. In recent years science 
and math education in American 
schools has suffered as shifting priori-
ties have reduced opportunities for students 
to perform hands-on experimentation.
By investigating urban legends and half-baked engineer-
ing ‚Äútruths‚Äù‚Äîproving some, debunking others‚ÄîJamie and 
Adam have played an important role in changing attitudes 
about science. The show‚Äôs genius is that beneath the kinetics 
and risky stunts‚Äîspectacular car crashes, explosions and 
other dangerous merriment‚Äîis a cleverly veiled science 
show that instructs as it entertains, which any teacher will 
tell you is a real feat. ‚ÄúI like to think,‚Äù Jamie says, ‚Äúthat there‚Äôs 
a whole do-it-yourself sort of mentality that is growing.‚Äù 
If the decades ahead produce another Thomas Edison or 
Steve Jobs, odds are that he or she will have grown up watch-
ing MythBusters. The workshop‚Äôs ofÔ¨Åce is covered with draw-
ings made and sent by children. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve shown that it‚Äôs a lot 
easier to get hands-on experience than people think,‚Äù Jamie 
says. ‚ÄúYou can memorize how to do something, but unless 
you internalize the information, it‚Äôs just a pile of data sitting 
on a table. Hands-on experience is what allows you to make it 
part of your brain; it brings that data to life.‚Äù
It‚Äôs 3:30 pm‚Äîjust 2 hours from the deadline for wrapping 
up the day‚Äôs shoot. Adam‚Äôs mutt Huxley naps, while his 
equally relaxed owner adjusts the chuck of a lathe in the 
machine shop. His next task‚Äîdrilling dimples into one of 
the cast car models. He‚Äôs making a sleeve that he 
hopes will Ô¨Åt over a drill bit and quickly produce 
the right dimples. ‚ÄúI very much enjoy cutting a 
couple of thousandths off a piece.‚Äù
The intern has delivered a new bowling 
ball, so now Jamie is back at the drill press, 
dimpling the 10-pounder. It takes almost an 
hour of drilling the holes to just the right 
depth and repositioning the ball, a sequence 
Jamie performs 321 times without stopping. 
While it sounds like assembly-line drudgery, 
Jamie doesn‚Äôt mind. ‚ÄúI enjoy the opportunity to 
turn off my mind,‚Äù he says. In fact, I hear him 
humming. Could it be ‚ÄúZip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah‚Äù?
Meanwhile, Adam Ô¨Ånishes the drill-bit sleeve 
and sets to work on the 24-inch-long car 
casting. He drills a couple of dimples, 
but the results are not quite right. He 
tries a few without the sleeve and 
learns that he can get the desired 
result without the piece he‚Äôs spent 
half an hour crafting. ‚ÄúSometimes 
you go down a path, and it‚Äôs not the 
right one,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSo you have to start 
all over again. It‚Äôs like throwing money into a 
bad poker hand. You have to know when to stop.‚Äù Adam‚Äôs 
demeanor wouldn‚Äôt suggest he has the patience for this 
repetitive work, yet he plows right through it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like clean-
ing up a room,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou pick up one thing at a time.‚Äù In 
45 minutes, he drills 732 dimples. 
Now it‚Äôs 4:30. The only thing left to do is the painting. 
Jamie sets his ball under the painting booth and goes to work 
with a spray can, moving slowly, precisely. Adam takes his 
turn, moving his spraying arm quickly back and forth past one 
of the model cars. ‚ÄúThe trick is to spray past the object you‚Äôre 
painting,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSee? It‚Äôs easy.‚Äù His hand is a blur.

 The last was my 
Uncle Paul. He was a shipbuilder who learned his trade beginning at age 14 in Ham-
burg, Germany. Every morning, the boy rowed from the family‚Äôs dock out across the 
shipping lanes of the Elbe River, which Ô¨Çows into the North Sea. The trip to the ship-
yard where he was apprenticed took an hour and a half, longer in winter,  when there 
was fog and Ô¨Çoating ice on the water. After three years, Paul received a journeyman‚Äôs 
certiÔ¨Åcate and a berth aboard a gigantic four-masted windjammer named Passat‚Äî

frames (that was the name of the craft 
in the plans, and I chose to keep it) and 
a 2-inch-thick slab of white oak for the 
wedge-shaped stem at the bow. 
Back home, I started making a racket 
feeding planks through a table saw. My 
skills were creaky‚ÄîI‚Äôve spent too much 
time in recent years Ô¨Åxing stuff and not 
enough building‚Äîbut over a few days 
my old confidence returned. The Sea 
Scout began to take form. 
Most boats begin with the frames, 
the ribs that provide structure to the 
hull. I roughed them into shape, along 
with the stem and the gracefully shaped 
stern wall, or transom, which I cut from 
¬æ-inch plywood. Then I braced it all to 
a building board‚Äîwhich is nothing 
more than a 2 x 10 with a chalk line 
marked down the center. The boat‚Äôs 
skeleton was in place, but each member 
still needed to be precisely beveled 
before I could secure the curved planks 
of the hull. The next step was to clamp 
thin strips of wood, called battens, to 
the frame to stand in for the planks, so I 
could measure and mark all those 
angles. Then, I took the parts off the 
board and Ô¨Ånished shaping them.
Often, the weather conÔ¨Åned me to 
the garage, but when the sun emerged I 
worked in the driveway. If you want to 
get to know the neighbors, start build-
ing a boat. Linda from next door asked 
whether the craft would be sailed, 
rowed or powered by an outboard 
motor. Others wondered where I would 
go with it, how I‚Äôd get it there and what I 
would name it. A truck driver from Tul-
noy Lumber, dropping off some marine 
plywood, approached respectfully. ‚ÄúThis 
is beautiful,‚Äù he said, with an old-
fashioned New York accent as broad as 
the hand he ran over the frames.

English. That was 
in the 1920s, be-
fore the fascists 
confiscated his 
family‚Äôs own small 
shipyard and the 
Berendsohns left

A few months 
ago, I decided to try 
my hand at the 
ancestral trade. I‚Äôve 
built everything 
from houses to a 
blacksmith‚Äôs forge 
(March 2009), but 
there‚Äôs no more evocative project than a 
boat, at least to me. Since before Austro-
nesians first gazed across the Pacific, 
wooden vessels have stood for crafts-
manship and the drive to explore. I 
sifted through PM‚Äôs archives looking for 
a classic design and eventually settled 
on a 10-foot dinghy from our May 1937 
issue. It looked elegant, yet simple 
enough to build on a pair of sawhorses. 
It‚Äôs been many years since my Uncle 
Paul was around to lend advice, so I 
ran the drawings past Timo White, a 
boatbuilder at Tuckerton Seaport, a 
small maritime museum on the New 
Jersey coast. It turned out that Timo 
was in the midst of restoring a surf-
board built from plans in the July 1937 
issue of PM. (It was a big year for sea-
faring projects, I guess.) He conÔ¨Årmed 
that the dinghy was a good candidate 
for a Ô¨Årst-time builder and agreed to 
lend a hand if needed.

 morning I set 
out for Willard Brothers Woodcutters, 
a sawmill and lumber dealer in Tren-
ton, N.J. You can spend hours there, 
roaming stacks of delicious- looking 
walnut, cherry and oak, some of the 
boards as wide as your arm is long. I 
bought red oak for the Sea Scout‚Äôs 
ese plans for a 
small and simple 
sailing boat design 
called a Biloxi 
Dinghy appeared in 
POPULAR MECHANICS 
in May 1937. To 
simplify the proje, 
I omitted the maÔ¨Ü 
and centerboard. 
InÔ¨Üead, I built the 
Sea Scout, named 
aer the cra in 
the original article, 
to be rowed or 
powered by an out-
board motor. She 
works well in either

1. Building 
Board
Like moÔ¨Ü small 
wooden boats, the 
Sea Scout was 
built bottom side 
up. MoÔ¨Ü pieces 
aren‚Äôt permanently 
conneed until 
relatively late in 
the process, but 
every element of 
the frame had to 
be shaped to Ô¨Åt 
q!q	qq
together precisely. 
e 12-foot-long 
building board, 
made from a  
2 x 10, held the 
parts in the right 
positions while the 
bevels were 
measured and 
again when it was 
time to join the 
frames together 
with the chine logs 
and planking.
2. Bottom 
Member
e frames 
underlying the 
dinghy‚Äôs hull were 
fashioned from 
red oak. e 
curved seion is 
the bottom 
member‚Äîeach 
one was cut with 
a jigsaw and 
smoothed using a 
block plane.
3. Side Member
e gently tapered 
oak side members 
meet the bottom 
members at a 
slight angle. ese 
pieces are cut 
oversize, then 
shortened to 
Ô¨Ånished length.
4. Gusset
e gussets 
joining the bottom 
and side framing

from oak and 
faÔ¨Üened with 
epoxy and bronze 
screws, some of 
which ended up 
being too close to 
the gusset‚Äôs edge.

 how Uncle Paul felt about 
it, but boatbuilding can be acutely frus-
trating. The bane of my weekends 
proved to be a small bronze screw. A No. 
6 Frearson Ô¨Çat-head, to be exact. Like 
most modern DIYers, I‚Äôd been spoiled 
by drywall screws and other aggressive 
fasteners that practically plow into the 
lumber. Even using a specialized, 
tapered drill bit and a waxlike lubricant 
with the unlikely name of Akempucky, I 
managed to wreck screws by the dozen. 
The head on one would strip a moment 
before the screw was fully seated, while 
another would shear off on the last 
eighth of a turn, leaving me with a shiny 
Frearson-head penny.
Timo had tried to downplay the 
arcana I‚Äôd face‚Äî‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more like house 
carpentry than fine-furniture build-
ing,‚Äù he had said‚Äîbut I still found 
myself Ô¨Çoundering on occasion. One 
challenge was that the 1937 article was 
more an overview than a detailed set 
of plans. And, though it pains me to 
Ô¨Ånd fault with my forebears at Popu-
lar Mechanics, the sketch contained 
suspicious discrepancies. Timo helped 
me recalibrate some of the dimensions 
midway through 
the project‚Äî
and I had to trim 
several pieces 
after they were assembled.
The biggest hurdle came when it was 
time to plank the hull. The classic way 
is to bend strips of solid wood to the 
frames. I‚Äôd chosen marine-grade Ô¨År ply-
wood instead to save time, but now I 
was barely able to force the hull‚Äôs 1‚ÅÑ4-
inch sheets into place. There was no 
way the half-inch plywood I‚Äôd planned 
for the bottom was going to work.
Timo advised me to switch to a spe-
cial, wafer-thin marine-grade plywood 
and plank the bottom in two layers. He 
came swooping in one Thursday morn-
ing to show me the technique. He 
stepped out of his truck with a broad 
smile, and a block plane in each hand, 
and my mood lifted. He politely took a 
sighting down the chine logs where 
we‚Äôd attach the bottom, and spent a few 
minutes planing them to the last mea-
sure of precision. Then we got to work 
with staples, glue and screws‚Äîand in a 
couple of hours the project went from a 
plywood Ô¨Çower bed to a small craft with 
sensuous compound curves.
It was satisfying, but my mistakes 
still showed in details like the placement 
of screws and the shape of the stem. 
‚ÄúYou know what they say,‚Äù Timo told 
me. ‚ÄúPutty and paint makes a boat what 
it ain‚Äôt.‚Äù I got out my paintbrushes.

 at Tuckerton 
Seaport on a cool, overcast day that  
felt more like September than June. 
Down at the dock, Timo produced a 
can of Amstel Light in lieu of cham-
pagne. ‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúpour it 
over the bow.‚Äù I popped it open and 
emptied the beer over the paint. ‚ÄúI 
christen thee Sea Scout,‚Äù I said. Then 
we slid the little craft off the dock and 
into the water. 
You might think a feeling of tri-
umph came over me. Not so. The Sea 
Scout looked very small, almost help-
less, as she sat bobbing at the end of 
the painter, the little rope that Timo 
had threaded across the bow. I felt 
humbled. A phrase from the Book of 
Psalms Ô¨Çashed in my mind: ‚ÄúThey that 
go down to the sea in ships, that do 
business on great waters.‚Äù
I wasn‚Äôt aiming for any great waters 
myself. I eased off the dock and into the 
boat. Timo handed me the oars. Awk-
wardly, I drew the handles back, just 
above my hips. The craft slid forward 
gracefully, almost like she was on ice. 
As Timo watched, I braced the left oar 
down in the water and swept the surface 
with the right. The Sea Scout pivoted 
neatly, unexpectedly elegant and spry. 
If the oars were a kick, you can imag-
ine the thrill I felt when I mounted the 
2.5-hp Mercury Marine outboard on 
the transom. It‚Äôs a clean-running four-
stroke engine, compact yet almost 
 zippy on a boat this small. I gave the 
engine full throttle and cut some nice 
straight lines and a pleasingly tight 
curve complete with a crisp little wake.
With the afternoon gone, my first 
voyage was complete. In the end, I 
decided to donate the boat and engine 
to Tuckerton Seaport. Frankly, I needed 
the space in my garage and driveway: 
The Sea Scout was a good Ô¨Årst foray into 
wooden boatbuilding, but I knew I 
could do better‚Äîand I‚Äôm already sift-
ing through plans.

weekends to build a liquid-fuel rocket engine in his garage. 
Mueller, a propulsion engineer at Redondo Beach, Calif.‚Äìbased 
aerospace Ô¨Årm TRW, felt like an ‚Äúunwanted necessity‚Äù at his day 
job. His proliÔ¨Åc ideas about engine design were lost at such a 
large, diverse company. To satisfy his creative impulses, he built 
his own engines, attached them to airframes and launched them 
in the Mojave Desert with fellow enthusiasts in the Reaction

SpaceX propulsion chief Tom Mueller (opposite) examines 
a spacecra control thruÔ¨Üer. Mueller‚Äôs Merlin engines 
(above, in Hawthorne, Calif.) power rockets that NASA 
needs to haul cargo to the space Ô¨Üation. SpaceX founder 
Elon Musk has an even bolder objeive: manned Ô¨Çight.  

Mueller never fired that engine. He took it 
back to his garage, where it still sits. Instead, he 
took up Musk‚Äôs offer to join the nascent private 
space venture. Today SpaceX has more than 700 
employees, 500 of them at corporate headquar-
ters in Hawthorne, Calif. Mueller is vice presi-
dent of propulsion. ‚ÄúTRW is a huge company 
with a tiny propulsion department,‚Äù Mueller 
says. ‚ÄúHere, I‚Äôm kind of king.‚Äù
On the Ô¨Çoor of the Hawthorne facility, a for-
mer Boeing 747 assembly plant, rests the engine 
assembly from SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 rocket. Soot 
from a test Ô¨Åring coats the 12-foot-high structure. 
Seven of nine engines are in place; technicians 
have removed the other two and stood them 
upright on nozzles nearly 3 feet wide. Topped 
with a 3200-hp turbopump and a tangle of 
plumbing, each engine stands taller than a man. 
Once all nine engines have been refurbished, 
the assembly will be shipped to the company‚Äôs 
test center in McGregor, Texas. Firing one engine 
to simulate a run to orbit awakens babies in 
towns miles away. The full cluster, which pro-
duces nearly 1 million pounds of thrust, must 
members, many of them employees at aerospace Ô¨Årms, meet reg-
ularly in the Los Angeles area to build and launch the biggest and 
highest Ô¨Çying rockets they can‚Äîjust as the group has done since 
it was founded in the early 1940s. 
Building a liquid-fuel rocket engine isn‚Äôt easy, even for an 
experienced propulsion engineer. Liquid propellants are cheap 
and provide lots of lifting power, but the engines rely on a host of 
valves and seals to control the flow. And they usually require 
supercooled oxidizers, like liquid oxygen, to mix with the fuel so it 
can ignite. The resulting combustion‚Äîessentially a controlled 
explosion‚Äîis channeled at high pressure into the nozzle, creat-
ing the thrust that propels the rocket. Despite these challenges, 
by early 2002 Mueller had moved his operations to a friend‚Äôs 
rented warehouse and was putting the Ô¨Ånishing touches on the 
world‚Äôs largest amateur liquid-fuel rocket engine, an 80-pounder 
designed to produce 13,000 pounds of thrust. 
Mueller‚Äôs ambitious moonlighting caught the attention of 
Internet multimillionaire Elon Musk, who met the engineer at 
the warehouse in January 2002 as Mueller was trying to attach his 
homemade engine to an airframe. Fresh from the $1.5 billion 
sale of PayPal to eBay, Musk was seeking staff for a new space 
company, soon to be called Space Exploration Technologies, or 
SpaceX. He eyed the rocket engine and asked a simple question: 
‚ÄúCan you build something bigger?‚Äù

renewable energy and space exploration. 
After the windfall sale of PayPal, he 
scratched the Internet off his list. Within a 
year of the sale, Musk invested in a pair of 
companies, electric-car developer Tesla 
Motors and the solar-power outÔ¨Åt SolarCity, 
to help foster alternative-energy research. 
That left space exploration‚Äî‚Äúin particular 
the extension of life beyond Earth,‚Äù he says 
‚Äîas the last item on the list. 
Musk wanted to Ô¨Ånance a Mars lander, 
but he discovered it would cost more to 
launch the craft than to build it. He decided 
that what the world really needed was afford-
able rockets. So he searched the ranks of the 
RRS for engineers who could achieve results 
on a budget and found a strong candidate 
for propulsion chief in Mueller. ‚ÄúTom had 
an awesome track record of engine develop-
ment at TRW,‚Äù Musk says. ‚ÄúI also really liked the fact that he built 
and tested rocket hardware with his own hands.‚Äù
With the resources of SpaceX, Mueller was able to produce a 
reliable engine with a simple design at a cut-rate price‚Äîthe Mer-
lin. It was the nation‚Äôs Ô¨Årst new large liquid-fuel rocket engine to 
Ô¨Çy in 40 years. The Merlin runs on highly reÔ¨Åned kerosene and 
cryogenically cooled liquid oxygen, and uses a single injector, 
unlike more complicated engines that mix fuel and oxidizers at 
multiple points. But, even with modern technology, rocket 
engines are notoriously unpredictable. 
To prevent heat damage, Mueller treated the nozzles of the 
early versions of the Merlin with resin impregnated with silicon 
Ô¨Åbers. This ablative coating chars and Ô¨Çakes off as the engine 
runs, taking damaging heat with it. The goal was to have an 
engine that could withstand a punishing 160-second burn‚Äîlong 
enough for the Ô¨Årst stage of SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 1 rocket to reach an 
altitude of 56 miles, where the second stage‚Äôs smaller engine 
kicks in to boost the cargo to 81 miles and low Earth orbit. 
In October 2003 Mueller and his engineers sat in the SpaceX 
control bunker in Texas and Ô¨Åred up a Merlin on the test stand. 
During the 60-second run, the exhaust began to melt the metal in 
the engine‚Äôs throat. The heat also endangered seals that governed 
the Ô¨Çow of the propellant. If the engine had run any longer, it 
would have blown up. 
It took months to work out the bugs. Mueller‚Äôs team reduced 
the amount of liquid oxygen entering the injector to make the 
engine run cooler and less powerfully, and strengthened the 
seals. Fifteen months after that Ô¨Årst test, the engineers invited me 
to join them in the bunker as they attempted to run the engine for 
a full mission duty cycle‚Äîthe time needed to send a payload into 
orbit. After a tense countdown, the engineers watched on wide-
screen TV monitors as the engine coughed and then blazed to life. 
A caged-beast roar penetrated the concrete and packed earth 
walls of the bunker; the steel grates of the test stand‚Äôs Ô¨Çoor shiv-
ered and rattled, Ô¨Ånally shaking loose a panel that danced across 
have them bouncing in their cribs like 
jumping beans. 
Last year, NASA awarded SpaceX a 
$1.6 billion contract to send cargo to 
the space station; it also issued a $1.9 
billion contract to another company, 
Orbital Sciences. This marks the Ô¨Årst 
time NASA has included private launch 
vehicles in its plans. ‚ÄúNASA is counting 
on them,‚Äù says William Gerstenmaier, 
the agency‚Äôs associate administrator 
responsible for space operations. 
Early next year a SpaceX rocket will 
approach the station in a test flight, 
with another test to follow in rehearsal 
for an unmanned docking by the end of 
2010. ‚ÄúI never thought that I‚Äôd be doing 
a big program for NASA,‚Äù Musk says. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of wild. Launching from Cape 
Canaveral is like opening on Broadway.‚Äù

The rocket‚Äôs nine engines

that is, one or more engines

by the end of this year on a 
Falcon 9. Four other outÔ¨Åts

launching payloads on a 
Falcon 1 start at around $8 million, a bargain compared to the 
estimated $13.5 million charged by competitors. A 2009 Govern-
ment Accountability OfÔ¨Åce report conÔ¨Årms that the company 
manufactures almost all of its own rocket components, avoiding 
dependency on costly external suppliers. ‚ÄúSpaceX has a great 
deal of in-house technical skill,‚Äù says Alan Lindenmoyer, NASA‚Äôs 
commercial crew and cargo program manager. ‚ÄúBut they also 
have the entrepreneurial spirit that drives them to succeed.‚Äù

avionics and other gear that will be stored in the unpressurized 
equipment hold in the Dragon‚Äôs base. A hatch opens to a second

space. Staff have painted an indigo dragon on the hull, wings out-
stretched. The image evokes the twin solar panels that will open 
from the capsule to provide power during extended missions, 
such as those for microgravity experiments. 
Despite the pressure of the NASA contract and the demands 
of SpaceX‚Äôs other clients, Musk is still chasing his dream of send-
ing people beyond Earth. NASA has not yet asked the company to 
build any hardware to carry astronauts to the space station, but 
SpaceX engineers are preparing the Dragon capsule to handle a 
crew of seven. Every Dragon spacecraft, even ones that will only 
carry cargo, has windows. I climb a short metal ladder to the 
pressurized hold; it‚Äôs roomy, with curving walls that are too far 
apart to reach with outstretched arms. 
NASA says its new reliance on private companies to ferry cargo 
to the space station will free the agency to focus on manned 
Ô¨Çights to the moon and, eventually, Mars. But, as the windows on 
the Dragon indicate, SpaceX has plans that go far beyond han-
dling NASA‚Äôs freight. Who knows‚Äîat the rate Musk, Mueller and 
company are going, SpaceX just might reach Mars Ô¨Årst.

the start of the engineering challenges. 
In 2006, technicians mounted the Mer-
lin engine on SpaceX‚Äôs 70-foot-tall Fal-
con 1 rocket and launched it from the 
company‚Äôs facility at Kwajalein Atoll, 
2500 miles southwest of Hawaii. The 
liftoff looked perfect, but the rocket 
was doomed before ignition.
During weeks of preÔ¨Çight tests, salty 
PaciÔ¨Åc air had corroded an aluminum 
nut in the engine. Just before liftoff, 
when the propellant valves opened, the 
nut failed and caused a leak. When the engines 
ignited 2 seconds before liftoff, the spilled fuel 
caught Ô¨Åre. Thirty-four seconds after the Falcon 
launched, Ô¨Çames burned through a pneumatic 
line and shut down the engine. The rocket 
crashed into the PaciÔ¨Åc a few seconds later.
It was the Ô¨Årst in a series of failed launches. A 
year later, sloshing fuel in the second stage of 
another Falcon 1 caused oscillations, and the 
rocket spun out of control before reaching orbit. 
During the third Ô¨Çight in August 2008, the Ô¨Årst 
stage collided with the second stage just after 
separation. Both fell into the ocean. An investiga-
tion showed that engine improvements had 
increased residual thrust, leading to the impact.
Less than two months later, those expensive 
and embarrassing failures were forgotten. At 
SpaceX‚Äôs Hawthorne headquarters, Mueller, 
Musk and the staff watched a video feed from 
Kwajalein as another Falcon I roared from its 
South PaciÔ¨Åc launchpad. Images from cameras 
mounted on the rocket showed the first stage 
falling back to Earth and the second-stage engine 
kicking on, boosting the rocket into space. 
The fairings at the tip of the Falcon separated 
and fell away; they would eventually incinerate 
while re-entering the atmosphere. Less than 10 
minutes after liftoff, at 16,400 mph and 81 
miles‚Äîfast enough and high enough to remain 
in orbit‚Äîthe Falcon released a dummy payload. 
Musk and Mueller had created the Ô¨Årst private 
liquid-fuel rocket to reach orbit.
Soon after that successful launch, customers 
began signing up for future Ô¨Çights on the larger, 
What goes up: Mueller (in helmet) and other amateur rocketeers locate the landing site of a solid-fuel 
booÔ¨Üer launched in the Black Rock Desert in 1996.

e moÔ¨Ü powerful 
bike in our teÔ¨Ü, the 
KTM 450 EXC, has 
torque to burn.
  
you‚Äôre blasting down Death Valley‚Äôs Titus Canyon. I‚Äôm the lead rider in our group of 
Ô¨Åve, my helmet and hands buzzing from the KTM‚Äôs torquey 449-cc four-stroke. Every 
twist of this serpentine, dusty trail hides a surprise, and any hamÔ¨Åsted moves with 
the throttle could mean a side trip into the unforgiving brush‚Äîperhaps  
worse. Suddenly, the trail snakes abruptly to the right; I barely make the turn and 
drift wide into the soft, sandy shoulder as the prickly branches of the desert sage-
brush graze my pant legs. Whew.  
Death Valley is notoriously unforgiving. It‚Äôs remote, dry and, yes, very hot‚Äî134 F 
is the record temperature. There‚Äôs good reason auto engineers arrive here every 
summer for hot-weather testing in camouÔ¨Çaged prototypes. If the air conditioning 
works in Death Valley, it works anywhere. As inhospitable as this place may be, its 
topography is like an amusement park for hikers, campers and gearheads looking to 
get a little dirty.  This 3.4-million-acre national park on the California‚ÄìNevada border 
has trails ideally suited to our mission: testing dual-sport motorcycles. 

Dual-sport bikes are like the crossover SUVs of the motor-
cycle world. They are off-road bikes toned down and made 
legal for road use. Since weight is the enemy of off-road rid-
ing, they are all ‚Äúthumpers‚Äù‚Äîtorque-rich, single-cylinder 
machines that conservatively sip fuel. So, they‚Äôve become 
popular bikes for commuting. In fact, last year, the dual-
sport segment grew 23 percent. Impressive, considering that 
the motorcycle market as a whole declined by 3.3 percent. 
Our group of riders rambles into Death Valley National 
Park and convenes at the rustic Furnace Creek Ranch one 
early spring weekend to kick up some dirt. Our skill levels are 
as diverse as the bikes we‚Äôre testing. The Honda CRF230L 
and Yamaha XT250 represent the popular entry-level class. 
The Kawasaki KLX250S and Suzuki DR-Z400S are two con-
secutive upward steps in capability. Finally, at the extreme 
end of the performance envelope sits the KTM 450 EXC, a 
race-ready dirt rocket. Professional tester Danny Coe has 
blasted each one down the quarter-mile at Auto Club Race-
way in Pomona, Calif., before we arrive in Death Valley. So we 
have an idea which ones will take a more experienced hand.  
And our guest rider has spent a large part of his life on two 
wheels. Joining our team for this three-day trail test is part-
time motorcycle rider and full-time MythBuster Jamie Hyne-
man. Jamie gravitates right to the Ô¨Åre-breathing KTM‚Äîit 
became his favorite steed on this trip.

THE TRAILS OF DEATH VALLEY RADIATE OUTWARD LIKE A
pinwheel from our Furnace Creek home base. Dual-sport 
bikes don‚Äôt have to be hauled to the trailhead like a dedicated 
dirt machine. You just saddle up and ride. And to get in a full 
day of riding, we begin at the coldest part‚Äîearly morning. 
The stunning, snow-covered Panamint Range is a wel-
come distraction from the chill. Still, a 30-mile pavement ride 
reminds us that these bikes do have some drawbacks. There 
is no bodywork to shield you from wind. The seats pack all 
the comfort of a park bench. And the knobby tires put little 
rubber on the tarmac. So these bikes certainly aren‚Äôt cushy 
cruisers. But it‚Äôs that upright riding position that makes dual-
sport bikes so maneuverable‚Äîand perfect for the dirt.
The packed gravel road leading to Titus Canyon drops 
into an ever-narrowing switchback canyon. The road itself is 
mild. A rental car could make it‚Äîvery slowly. But at the speed 
we‚Äôre going, the constant washboard bumps would probably 
shake a car dashboard into a pile of crumbled plastic. 
These bikes have suspension travel to spare, so they soak 
up the ridges and allow us to race through to more challeng-
ing terrain. All of these bikes occasionally spit Ô¨Åst-size rocks. 
But when you‚Äôre dressed in a suit of armored Alpinestars 
gear, as we are, you‚Äôre nearly bulletproof.
Down in the canyon, as we slice between the high rock 
walls, the Honda and Yamaha ease us back into the sport. 
Just about anyone can throw a leg over these bikes; the learn-
ing curve is short. But dirt riding requires a subtle touch. It‚Äôs 

P O P U L A R M E C H A N I C S . C O M   |   S E P T E M B E R  2 0 0 9   73
tempting to stiffen your arm muscles and make small, fran-
tic steering corrections. Not only will you wake up the next 
morning with sore shoulders, but these bikes won‚Äôt respond 
well to this busywork. 
The best way to ride on this terrain is to guide the bikes 
and forget about small course corrections. It‚Äôs easier to stand 
and use your body weight to steer. Once you‚Äôre in a groove, 
the moves are graceful, satisfying and quite relaxing. Our 
group hits that mark as we close in on our lunch stop and 
glide past the rusty brown and slate-gray canyon walls. 
The KLX packs a surprisingly hefty punch. There‚Äôs a good 
balance between suspension travel and seat height. And the 
powerplant is more highly tuned than the other 250s here, so 
once you spin the motor to its 10,500 redline, hold on.
The deeper we go, the tighter the canyon gets. And 
nobody wants to let up. The big Suzuki and the KTM both 
have a wonderful overload of power. The Suzuki is equipped 
with slightly more street-oriented tires. Yet the motor is 
ferocious, so lifting the front wheel is just a twist of the 
throttle away. But the KTM is really in another class. Even 
with the dirt-speciÔ¨Åc tires, this bike effortlessly breaks trac-
tion, power-slides and sends up a sky-high roost of dirt. We 
quickly nickname it the Big Block. For those of us with less 
experience, the KTM can be a bit intimidating. But Jamie 
can‚Äôt get enough of it. (By this time, the MythBuster has long 
since dispelled any doubts about his riding prowess‚Äîthe 
man has serious off-road chops). The KTM is ‚Äúa barrelful of 
monkeys,‚Äù he says, in one of those anachronisms that some-

We gas the bikes through the last of the switchbacks, 
dirt-track style, with the rear ends swinging wide. On the 
street these would be hooligan moves, but in the dirt, it‚Äôs 
just the right way to ride. 
IT TAKES A DIP IN FURNACE CREEK‚ÄôS SPRING-FED POOL
to remove the day‚Äôs dusty Ô¨Ålm. The next morning we emerge 
fresh and ready to run the curvy pavement to 5475-foot 
Dante‚Äôs View. At the top, on this sparkling day, we could use 
a parka‚Äîit‚Äôs cold. We walk to the edge of the lookout and see 
both the highest and lowest places in the contiguous U.S. 
Roughly 80 miles west is 14,494-foot Mount Whitney; on the 
valley floor, 282 feet below sea level, the Badwater Basin 
spreads out like a chalk-white desert.
The chill melts away as our convoy snakes down to Bad-
water. On this billiard-table-smooth two-laner, the smaller 
Honda and Yamaha struggle to maintain 70 mph. The KTM 
has no such trouble. But oddly, the KTM‚Äôs saddle is not par-
ticularly well-suited to ... sitting. It‚Äôs rock-hard and narrow. 

The Suzuki, on the other hand, provides plenty of thrust and 
comfort‚Äîit is the grand tourer of the group.
Badwater‚Äôs glowing white surface practically sears our 
eyeballs when we remove our helmets for a closer look. 
NASA-strength sunblock wouldn‚Äôt have been enough. The 
basin is not unlike Bonneville‚Äîsmooth and salty. But this is 
not a place for speed, unless you plan to compete in the Bad-

THE GOOD
‚Üí It has nearly all  
the punch of the 
high-powered KTM, so 
it can keep up with 
highway traÔ¨Éc. e 
power allows you to 
eÔ¨Äortlessly work the 
rear end in the dirt. 
But it‚Äôs as docile as 
the smaller bikes. e 
DR-Z400S was the 
only bike here with 
vibration-damping 
rubber foot-peg 
inserts. e 
suspension‚Äôs initial 
compliance did a solid 
job smoothing out the 
bumps. And this bike 
has been around for a 
while, so there‚Äôs 
tremendous 
aermarket support.
THE GOOD
‚Üí An excellent 
compromise between 
easy-to-ride play  
bike and full-Ô¨Çedged 
racer. Suspension is 
set at a comfortable 
height, but Ô¨Üill has 
plenty of travel to 
absorb large hits. It 
feels light and 
Ô¨Çickable‚Äîgreat on 
twiÔ¨Üy roads. Clutch 
and brake eÔ¨Äort are 
wonderfully smooth. 
Unlike moÔ¨Ü of the 
bikes here, the KLX 
comes with a 
tachometer. 
Amazingly, the 
Kawasaki coÔ¨Üs the 
same as the beginner 
bikes here.  
 
THE NOT-SO-GOOD
‚Üí It‚Äôs the heavieÔ¨Ü bike 
here, and the high 
center of gravity 
combines with the tall 
seat to create a 
Ô¨Üruggle for shorter 
riders. For serious 
oÔ¨Ä-road duty, it needs 
more aggressive tires. 
Some noticed a sharp, 
uncomfortable edge in 
the seat foam.  
THE BOTTOM LINE
‚Üí A terriÔ¨Åc all-around 
motorcycle that can 
be modiÔ¨Åed to suit 
almoÔ¨Ü any rider  
taller than about 
Ô¨Åve-foot eight.  
 
 
 
BEST SUITED FOR 
‚Üí Beginner to expert. 
THE NOT-SO-GOOD
‚Üí e high-revving 
engine has to be 
wound hard to gain 
suÔ¨Écient thruÔ¨Ü. While 
the liquid-cooled 
engine clearly provides 
more poke than the 
other 250s, it also has  
more Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä‚Äîradiators, 
water pumps‚Äîthat 
could fail.
THE BOTTOM LINE
‚Üí e KLX is docile 
enough for a newbie, 
but provides a wide- 
enough performance 
envelope to keep  
an advanced rider 
entertained.

beneath our boots. That‚Äôs not Death Valley hot, but it‚Äôs 
uncomfortable enough for us to mount up and seek relief.
WE HAVE JUST ENOUGH DAYLIGHT TO RACE OUT TO THE
abandoned Inyo gold mine, a quick buzz up a 10-mile trail. If 
we were crawling in a four-wheel drive, it‚Äôd be dark by the 
time we arrived. Sometimes, two wheels are better than four. 
The last gold miners left approximately 70 years ago, but 

there‚Äôs still plenty of hardware strewn about. We spot a 
mineshaft up a steep, rocky trail and hop on the Yamaha. 
The XT250‚Äôs docile motor happily loafs along, allowing us to 
crawl up the treacherous hill. And the Yamaha‚Äôs low seat 
makes the precarious turnaround easy.
We Ô¨Åll up one last time at the gas station next to the hotel 
bar. We have burned 20 gallons total‚Äîfor Ô¨Åve bikes‚Äîover 
200 miles of weekend exploring. Not bad. We park the bikes, 
dust ourselves off and head inside for a post-ride dinner. The 
beer and steak taste so much better after a day out on the 
trail. Suddenly, midway through a pull of my second Sierra 
Nevada, the music dies. Power outage. We can hear the howl-
ing wind and see the windows clouded with a thick, tan fog. 
‚ÄúNothing but a dust storm,‚Äù the bartender says. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs the 
worst I‚Äôve seen in a long time.‚Äù This is just the kind of unpre-
dictability that makes the region such a bewitching place to 
ride. Still, there are times when Death Valley is best experi-
enced from indoors.

THE GOOD
‚Üí e Yamaha was the leaÔ¨Ü expensive bike here, but it certainly 
didn‚Äôt feel cheap. While it has juÔ¨Ü two more horsepower than the 
Honda, our teÔ¨Ü team noticed the XT250 felt much Ô¨Üronger. ‚Äúe 
Yamaha is small but gutsy,‚Äù Hyneman says. e XT250 proved to be 
a great rock crawler, and with almoÔ¨Ü no learning curve and near 
53-mpg fuel eÔ¨Éciency, it‚Äôs probably a great commuter too. 
 
 
 
 
THE NOT SO GOOD
‚Üí e diÔ¨Üance from the seat to the foot pegs is 19.5 inches, the 
shorteÔ¨Ü here. So if you are 6 feet tall, this makes for a cramped 
cockpit. e rear suspension seemed too so for heavier adults. Like 
the Honda, faÔ¨Ü and rough oÔ¨Ä-road riding overwhelm the suspen-
sion‚Äôs damping ability, and the motor doesn‚Äôt have enough power to 
keep pace with the bigger bikes on the highway.
 
 
 
 
THE BOTTOM LINE
‚Üí A near twin to the Honda but in a more powerful, more 
intermediate- level package. For an extra $1400, Yamaha oÔ¨Äers

that he built a full working replica in his garage in Kalamazoo, Mich. ‚ÄúOther people 
build sports cars,‚Äù Dullam says, ‚Äúbut I wasn‚Äôt that intereÔ¨Üed in a Corvette. I like 
Batman‚Äîand the only way to get this car was to build it myself.‚Äù Basing his work 
on hundreds of fan photos found online and the extra features from the Batman 
Begins DVD, Dullam fabricated a Ô¨Üeel chassis and created body plates from epoxy 
reinforced with Ô¨Åberglass matte. Dullam‚Äôs Tumbler is 15 feet long, 5 feet high and 
9.5 feet wide at the rear. e 5000-pound vehicle uses a 350 Chevy V8 HO Deluxe 
to spin its 44-inch Super Swamper tires. Dullam eÔ¨Üimates he‚Äôs spent $50,000 to 
$70,000 on the car‚Äîand happily says it‚Äôs not for sale. 
Name: 
Bob Dullam 
Age:  57 
Location: 
Kalamazoo, 
Mich. 
Why done is a 
state of mind:  
Next, Dullam will 
add the internal 
Batpod from e 
Dark Knight‚Äî
and maybe 
pyrotechnics.  
‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt got 
Ô¨Çames shooting 
out the back 
yet,‚Äù he says.

Mississippi Skimmer
Roger Fontaine lives with his parents 
north of HouÔ¨Üon. Muscular dyÔ¨Ürophy has 
le him with only limited movement in his 
feet, right hand and neck. He devours 
science TV programs and technical 
magazines, and was eager to develop a 
way to be more mobile outdoors. He and 
his father, Roger senior, who repairs heavy 
equipment for a conÔ¨Üruion Ô¨Årm, 
designed and built the joyÔ¨Üick-controlled 
‚ÄúGecko‚Äù articulating ATV. e four-wheel-
drive vehicle is built around a pair of beefy 
Inspired by a hydrofoil he saw on the cover of 
POPULAR MECHANICS more than 40 years ago, 
Gary Sloat built one of his own: an 8-foot-long 
foam-and-plywood boat he calls the DragonÔ¨Çy. 
e pine foils, which hold riders 2 feet oÔ¨Ä the 
water, are joined with biscuits and reinforced 
with epoxy and Ô¨Åberglass cloth. With its 
original motor, the DragonÔ¨Çy topped out at 25 
mph. But it turns out 25 mph was plenty faÔ¨Ü 
considering that the throttle on the antique 
1947 10-hp outboard Mercury Hurricane had 
a habit of Ô¨Üicking whenever Sloat had the 
boat pointed toward shore. A new 9.5-hp 
motor is proving to be far more controllable‚Äî
Ô¨Üill, Sloat‚Äôs family prefers to let him ride atop 
the waters of the Mississippi alone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got 
daughters who are 10 and 5,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúand 
my wife‚Äôs not intereÔ¨Üed in submitting them to 
dad‚Äôs deathtraps.‚Äù

Saturn V Rocket Replica
JuÔ¨Ü before 1 pm on Saturday, April 25, 2009, a Saturn V rocket 
carried one more man into hiÔ¨Üory. Steve Eves broke a slew of 
world records when his 1:10 scale model of the hiÔ¨Üoric rockets 
that launched the Apollo missions lied oÔ¨Ä from a Ô¨Åeld on 
Maryland‚Äôs EaÔ¨Üern Shore. e 36-foot-tall rocket that Eves built 
in his garage near Akron, Ohio, was the largeÔ¨Ü model rocket ever 
launched. At 1648 pounds, it was also the heavieÔ¨Ü privately 
funded hobby rocket ever launched and the heavieÔ¨Ü ever to be 
successfully recovered. It drew a crowd eÔ¨Üimated at 5000‚Äîthe 
largeÔ¨Ü ever to witness a hobby rocket launch. Eves‚Äôs single-Ô¨Üage 
behemoth was conÔ¨Ürued of aircra-grade plywood and lauan 
plywood coated in Ô¨Åberglass and powered by nine motors‚Äîeight 
13,000 newton-second N-Class motors and a 77,000 newton-
second P-Class motor. All told, the array generated 7 g‚Äôs at lioÔ¨Ä 
and sent Eves‚Äôs Saturn V 4441 feet into the air. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt Ô¨Üart out 
to break records,‚Äù the 51-year-old autobody repair specialiÔ¨Ü says. 
‚ÄúI had juÔ¨Ü been working away‚Äîand then one day I realized no 
one‚Äôs ever pulled this oÔ¨Ä before.‚Äù

Matt Denton‚Äôs company, Micromagic SyÔ¨Üems, 
has built six-legged, inselike bots for the 
movies (his creations have appeared in multiple 
Harry Potter Ô¨Ålms). But in his spare time he 
experiments with ... more six-legged robots. In a 
Ô¨Çash of ingenuity, the London-based robotics 
engineer recently turned a small hexapod robot 
into a walking, computer-controlled milling 
machine. When fed inÔ¨Üruions over a wireless 
Blue tooth conneion, the dinner-plate-size bot 
with a drill bit for a head saunters over to a 
block of polyÔ¨Üyrene and begins to methodically 
carve 3D shapes into the material. So far, the 
little robot specializes in sculpting human faces. 
Currently the router takes 1‚ÅÑ8-inch bits, but 
Denton is working on a 3-mm version; he‚Äôs also 
hoping to beef up the bit‚Äôs vertical travel, which 
is currently limited by the servo to somewhere 
between 40 and 50 mm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had some 
companies approach me for praical applica-
tions of the robot,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbut I never made it 
with a praical application in mind. It was juÔ¨Ü a 
case of ‚Äòwhy the hell not?‚Äô‚Äù 
A lifelong downhill skier and induÔ¨Ürial 
mechanic/ millwright, Jim Maidment was 
fruÔ¨Ürated by the fa that he could pursue his 
favorite paÔ¨Üime only near a chair li. ‚ÄúWhen 
you‚Äôre on a slope, all that energy is free‚Äîas 
long as you‚Äôre going in that one direion,‚Äù he 
says. So Maidment hacked together a 6.5-hp 
generator engine (bought from CoÔ¨Üco for 
$125) with a small, oÔ¨Ä-the-shelf snowmobile 
track from Bombardier, inventing a machine he 
calls the Skizee. He then headed for the 
mountains to reÔ¨Åne his creation, moving from 
Ontario to Kimberley, British Columbia, 
Canada‚Äôs second-loieÔ¨Ü city. So far, he‚Äôs 
decreased the size and added a variable 
torque converter to change the power ratio 
and climb hills. His lateÔ¨Ü Skizee can go 12 
mph uphill and can reach 25 mph in Ô¨Çat 
powder. Maidment continues to teÔ¨Ü his 
invention in the snowy woods around his 
home, and he‚Äôs making Ô¨Ånal tweaks to the 
design now. One day he hopes to see the 
Skizee in pro shops everywhere. 
Name: Matt Denton Age: 36 Location: WincheÔ¨Üer, Hampshire, U.K. MythBuster take: ‚ÄúIt can in theory make large Ô¨Åxed CNC machines 
obsolete,‚Äù Jamie Hyneman says. ‚Äúe concept is hugely powerful when you think about it.‚Äù

Quick fix: e 
Skizee has been 
simpliÔ¨Åed so that 
spare parts can 
always be carried

By pushing rather 
than pulling the 
skier, the Skizee 
allows its opera-
tor to Ô¨Üeer with 
his skis. 
e Skizee is 
powered by a 
6.5-hp genera-
tor engine.
Handlebars retra, 
then fold to make 
the Skizee small 
enough to Ô¨Åt in the

DIY Fuel Mill
Ben Peterson wants to sell the world on turning its garbage 
into fuel. e 31-year-old former welder recently tore down a 
farmhouse on his 20-acre farm in Washington Ô¨Üate. ‚ÄúWe were 
le with piles of wood,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd I realized that with a 
gasiÔ¨Åer, I could turn that wood into fuel.‚Äù He found Federal 
Emergency Management Agency plans for a Ô¨ÜratiÔ¨Åed down-
dra gasiÔ¨Åer, which uses a controlled combuÔ¨Üion process to 
turn biomass into fuel for Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü responders. But the FEMA device 
was enormous, so Peterson spent two months redesigning 
Ô¨Ålters and Ô¨Üreamlining the airÔ¨Çow to get it down to a more 
family-friendly size. ‚ÄúI was making these things out of garbage 
cans and spare pipe, and I got addied to the design process,‚Äù 
he says. e result is a DIY home gasiÔ¨Åer that can power a 
portable generator. Now Peterson hopes to sell his design to 
the masses‚Äîand his work won‚Äôt be done until we‚Äôre all Ô¨Ålling up 
our gas tanks with gasiÔ¨Åed garbage.
Name: Ben Peterson  Age: 31 Location: Toledo, Wash. Expansion plan: Peterson has also 
created an induÔ¨Ürial-size gasiÔ¨Åer with help from the University of Florida.

FOR PUNISHMENT, WE 
TEST SEVEN RECIP 
SAWS AGAINST SOME 
UNUSUAL TEST RIGS.  
BY ROY BERENDSOHN
e reciprocating saw is the work-
horse of home remodeling. It slices 
through most common building 
materials, from caÔ¨Ü-iron drain pipe to 
nail-embedded framing lumber. Its 
slim proÔ¨Åle and narrow blade allow it 
to work in the most improbable 
places: inside a chimney chase, under 
a sink, behind a floor joist. And it 
safely handles jobs that no other tool 
can touch, such as removing a shrub‚Äôs 
root ball. To Ô¨Ånd the tools that excel 
at this dirty work, we gathered seven 
saws and leaned on them to simulate 
worÔ¨Ü-case cutting and the day-to-day 
Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä you‚Äôd likely encounter remodel-
ing a bathroom. A	er a long day of 
cutting, here‚Äôs what we found.

Price: $150
what we liked 
is is a superb saw, and the 
addition of a counter-
 balanced drivetrain has only 
made it better. A motor 
upgrade from 12 amps to 15 
provides it with even more 
power than older models. It 
has a twiÔ¨Ü-lock cord that‚Äôs 
easy to replace if damaged. 
And the equally easy 
spring-loaded chuck popped 
blades in or out, even when 
we wore work gloves.
what we didn‚Äôt
Our only complaint is that 
we can‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd anything‚Äînot 
one single thing‚Äîto 
complain about. Where‚Äôs 
the fun in that?
what we liked 
ere‚Äôs a lot to praise in this 
basic saw. Orbital aion? 
TwiÔ¨Ü a knob. Speed 
adjuÔ¨Üment? TwiÔ¨Ü a dial. 
Blade replacement? Turn 
the chuck. It‚Äôs not the 
faÔ¨ÜeÔ¨Ü saw, but it slogs 
through tough cuts without 
heating up. We can‚Äôt assess 
durability in these teÔ¨Üs, but 
we suspe its slow and 
Ô¨Üeady nature will help it 
win the longevity race.
what we didn‚Äôt
Big Yellow needs a 
chuck ring that‚Äôs larger  
and easier to grip, better 
vibration damping and a  
bit more power.
what we liked 
Bosch‚Äôs automatic blade 
chuck was the easieÔ¨Ü of 
the seven to employ. Push 
a blade in and the chuck 
collar rotates automatically, 
locking the blade. Rotate 
the chuck to release.  
is saw has good grip 
surfaces and a front  
hand guard that protes 
againÔ¨Ü skinned knuckles.
what we didn‚Äôt
e saw‚Äôs foot plate is 
subÔ¨Üantial, but its rotating 
release lever is complicated. 
e unobtrusive orbital 
aion needs to be slightly 
larger, especially for those 
wearing work gloves.

PM‚Äôs Joe Truini has a knack 
for building brutal teÔ¨Ü rigs. 
Before we cut into his teÔ¨Ü 
samples, we equipped each 
saw with a Lenox Gold Edge 
Bi-Metal blade. Next, we 
ripped down the length of  
a 2 x 8 Ô¨Üudded with 12d 
common nails. To make this rip cut  
more diÔ¨Écult, the lumber was topped 
with ¬Ω-inch plywood and two layers of  
roll rooÔ¨Ång. Aer the saws cooled, we  
chucked a Lenox Extreme Metal Lazer blade 
into each and crosscut the neÔ¨Üed nightmare 
seen on the previous page‚Äîa plaÔ¨Üic pipe  
with a layer of grass carpet glued to its outer 
wall. Inside, Joe slid a galvanized Ô¨Üeel pipe, 
another plaÔ¨Üic pipe, pipe insulation, copper 
pipe and 10-gauge armored cable.  
Finally, we did some Ô¨Üandard crosscuts.

what we liked 
Hitachi claims that its 
counterweight mechanism 
and unique swing orbital 
aion contribute to 
smoother cutting. We 
agree. ose features, 
coupled with plentiful 
rubber overmold, make it a 
very smooth operator.
what we didn‚Äôt
Everything about the 
Hitachi is well-engineered 
except, ironically, two of its 
simpleÔ¨Ü features. e 
shoe‚Äôs movement is cranky, 
and the blade-lock button is 
so Ô¨Üubborn that we tore it 
oÔ¨Ä with our thumb when we 
meant to pivot it forward. 
what we liked 
is is a reasonably faÔ¨Ü 
and easy-handling saw with 
large grip areas and good 
induÔ¨Ürial design. To change 
blades, you push up on the 
rounded lever that is part of 
the saw‚Äôs nose. Insert the 
new blade in the chuck and 
pivot the lever down. e 
emphasis on induÔ¨Ürial 
design makes the Rockwell 
a good choice for people 
who wear work gloves 
while sawing.
what we didn‚Äôt
If it had been juÔ¨Ü a little 
faÔ¨Üer overall it would  
rank right up there with  
the beÔ¨Ü of them.
what we liked 
We didn‚Äôt devise a teÔ¨Ü for 
cut neatness, but if we had, 
Makita would‚Äôve won it. Its 
four-position orbital aion 
and variable-speed control 
allow you to Ô¨Åne-tune its 
cutting aion. is was one 
of three saws that combine 
a 15-amp motor and 
vibration-damping features. 
e sum of these features is 
faÔ¨Ü and powerful cutting 
with little vibration.
what we didn‚Äôt
We couldn‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd one 
Ô¨Üinking thing to complain 
about, a trait it shared with 
its eÔ¨Üeemed red competi-
tor. Believe me, we tried.
what we liked 
As if a reciprocating saw 
wasn‚Äôt already versatile, this 
machine has a front gear 
housing that pivots through 
12 positions, allowing you 
to make cuts that would be 
impossible through 
conventional means.
what we didn‚Äôt
is is really a specialized 
tool for people who 
routinely make very Ô¨Ürange 
cuts. For normal use, it‚Äôs 
simply too slow, apparently 
a viim of the extra gearing 
necessary to swing that 
front housing around. Also, 
the absence of an orbital 
aion reduces its speed.

Long 
Reach
Q 
A couple of years ago we 
moved into a house with 
high ceilings, including light 
Ô¨Åxtures and decorative beams 
that are all but impossible to 
reach. It never occurred to us 
how diÔ¨Écult it is to deal with 
dusting, light-bulb changing 
and painting with all this tall 
architecture. What‚Äôs the best 
way to handle this?
A
Believe me, you‚Äôre not alone.   
ese atriums and ‚Äúgreat rooms‚Äù 
are designed to wow homebuyers, but 
homeowners are often less thrilled 
when they realize that routine mainte-
nance and painting in these areas can 
require scaÔ¨Äolding.  en there are the 
convective drafts that form in these 
tall places, but that‚Äôs another story.
FirÔ¨Ü, let‚Äôs look at the cleaning, since 
that‚Äôs the easieÔ¨Ü to handle. Get a tele-
scoping cleaning pole that has an Acme 
thread on its end. Typical homeowner 
models range from 5 to 15 feet, 
approximately, but there are profes-
sional models that can reach as high as 
30 feet. Also, get a lambswool or syn-
thetic duÔ¨Üer and a wall brush to sweep 
cobwebs out of tall corners. If you have 
ceiling fans, get a forked duÔ¨Üing tool. 
ese things will clean both sides of a 
ceiling-fan blade in one pass.
 Next, light-bulb changing. 
Home centers and hardware stores 
sell pole-mounted bulb changers 
equipped with a suion cup or spring-
Ô¨Üeel Ô¨Ångers, but these devices don‚Äôt 
work with chandeliers, which will spin 
as you faÔ¨Üen the changer to the bulb 
and turn it. e only way to prevent 
this from happening is to get a second 
person with another pole to try and 
hold the chandelier in position while 
you spin the bulb loose. Failing that, 
you‚Äôll need either a tall Ô¨Üepladder or a 
hybrid Ô¨Üepladder that‚Äôs designed to 
articulate over a staircase and into 
corners that are hard to reach by con-
ventional means. Little Giant makes a

number of ladders that can be conÔ¨Åg-
ured in this way.
at leaves painting. Sorry, there‚Äôs 
no good news here, just hard work. 
Dust off the high areas before 
beginning, because you‚Äôre liable to 
knock duÔ¨Ü loose as you work. e beÔ¨Ü 
way to paint tall ceilings and walls 
without setting up scaÔ¨Äolding is to get 
some help and set up an extension lad-
der. Use the ladder to get up to the 
ceiling‚Äìwall corner and cut in the line 
where the two meet using a brush and 
a rapid little tool appropriately called a 
mini roller. Next, paint the ceiling with 
a long extension pole and a roller (I 
admit, the job can give you a workout). 
Finally, paint the walls using the exten-
sion ladder to reach the ceiling‚Äìwall 
corner and the extension pole for the 
high parts of the wall. 
Goodbye Molding,
Hello Repair
My teenage son managed to take the 
molding oÔ¨Ä the garage-door jamb 
when he was backing out a little too 
quickly. e car damage was minor 
but the jamb molding was ripped oÔ¨Ä. 
I can‚Äôt seem to Ô¨Ånd a replacement. 
It‚Äôs one piece with weatherÔ¨Üripping 
molded onto it. Please don‚Äôt tell me 
the thing is sold only with the door. 
Relax. The part you‚Äôre looking for is 
known as a garage-door stop. Many 
home centers and lumberyards sell it, 
but you won‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd it with the typical 
wood moldings. If the Ô¨Üore has a sec-
tion with garage-door hardware, that‚Äôs 
probably where it‚Äôll be. A garage-door 
Ô¨Üop is available in two conÔ¨Ågurations: 
for the side or the top jamb. Yes, you‚Äôre 
correct. The weatherstrip is molded 
onto it. Depending on its length and 
where you buy it, it will coÔ¨Ü $6 to $12.
If your local home center or lumber-
yard doesn‚Äôt Ô¨Üock this piece, you can 
Ô¨Ånd it at garage-part suppliers online. 
The full name is: coextruded PVC 
garage-door-Ô¨Üop weatherÔ¨Ürip.
Metal Chimney Seal
I recently noticed a dirty patch of 
insulation in my attic. When I peeled 
special foams for this, but unless you‚Äôre 
sure that they are permitted where 
you live, you‚Äôre better oÔ¨Ä sealing the air 
gap between the chimney and floor 
joiÔ¨Üs using sheet Ô¨Üeel or aluminum 
flashing. This horizontal air seal is 
known as Ô¨Åre blocking or dra	 Ô¨Üop-
ping, and it prevents the spread of Ô¨Åre 
between Ô¨Çoors by sealing air spaces 
that permit its passage.
Once the metal is in place, seal the 
remaining gap between the metal‚Äôs 
edge and the chimney with a thin bead 
of high-temperature silicone caulk.
Finally, prepare for adding insula-
tion (foam or additional fiberglass 
batts) by inÔ¨Üalling a second piece of 
vertical sheet metal that provides a 
2-inch airspace around and parallel to 
the chimney. is barrier muÔ¨Ü be taller 
than any insulation is deep to prevent 
insulation from touching the chimney.
ere are exceptions to this proce-
dure. In some cases, a sheet-metal 
chimney that passes through an attic 
is already surrounded by a proteive 
sleeve that provides the needed air-
space. Also, the 2-inch air gap that I 
recommend is generous for some 
forms of insulated metal chimney, 
which only require a 1-inch airspace. 
Unless you‚Äôre sure of the type of chim-
ney you‚Äôve got,  use a 2-inch airspace. 
‚ÄúRemember, local building codes 
always have the last word,‚Äù Casey 
says. ‚ÄúCheck with your building oÔ¨Éce 
before beginning work.‚Äù

the insulation back, I found a big gap 
that was letting air through (a large 
hole had been bored to allow a pipe 
to pass through the framing). I want 
to seal this hole with expanding 
foam. Can I also use the foam to seal 
around a sheet-metal chimney that 
passes through the attic?
It‚Äôs a good thing you spotted that dirt, 
which is proof that a dra	 is moving 
into the attic from the house below. 
e insulation as as a Ô¨Ålter, trapping 
the material moving by in the air-
Ô¨Üream. Sealing the dra	s will cut your 
utility bill, and a little sheet-metal work 
accompanied by some heat-resiÔ¨Üant 
caulk will make the house more Ô¨Åre-
resistant. First, deal with the draft. 
Spray foam is great for sealing dra	s, 
but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs also suitable 
for sealing againÔ¨Ü the chimney. 
‚ÄúIn moÔ¨Ü cases, you shouldn‚Äôt use 
Ô¨Üandard foam insulation to seal and 
insulate againÔ¨Ü a sheet-metal chimney, 
or a masonry chimney for that matter,‚Äù 
says Michael Casey, an expert on build-
ing codes and co-author of Code Check,
a manual that helps builders, remodel-
ers and homeowners avoid running 
afoul of these regulations. ere are

a good alternative for

saves having to go back

means less drippage  
and spillage.

ere‚Äôs some Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä squirreled away that 
has no conceivable automotive use 
whatsoever. We got together with the 
MythBuÔ¨Üers, Adam Savage and Jamie 
Hyneman, one afternoon, and, sure 
enough, they‚Äôve got some weird Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä, 
or simply ordinary Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä utilized in, umm, 
unusual ways, on their shelves too.
Marvel MyÔ¨Üery Oil
is produ dates back to the ‚Äô20s, 
and was touted as a ‚Äútop oil,‚Äù some-
thing to be added to the gas tank to 
improve lubrication to the upper rings 
and the valves. Improvements to 
engine and oil technology have made 
it obsolete for that use, but it‚Äôs my oil 
of choice for freeing up a seized engine 
that‚Äôs been sitting, salvaged from 
some vehicle dereli long enough to 
have a tree growing through the trunk 
floor. Pour a couple of tablespoons 
into the spark plug holes and let it sit 
overnight. e amount of torque you‚Äôll 
need to apply to the crank to break the 
rings loose will be cut in half. MMO is 
also good for air tools because it cuts 
through gummy deposits on phenolic 
motor vanes. And it makes the whole 
shop smell minty fresh.
Never-Seez
is thick paÔ¨Üe is laced with graphite, 
copper and lead, in a mineral-oil base. 
I use it on virtually everything I ever 
expe to have to take apart again. It‚Äôs 
great on exhaust-system parts that 
slip-fit together. It‚Äôs perfect for the 
mating surface between brake discs 
and hubs to prevent water from intrud-
ing, corroding the surface and making 
the disc diÔ¨Écult to remove. JuÔ¨Ü brush 
a little on and smear it around to cover 
all the mating surfaces.
RuGlyde
Don‚Äôt mount tires with soapy water or 
silicone. e water Ô¨Üays inside the tire, 
causing corroded rims, 
while the soap makes 
your tires Ô¨Åzzy the 
next time it rains.

says he never has 
less than Ô¨Åve or 
six bottles of the 
Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä: ‚ÄúI get more 
every time I go to 
the hobby Ô¨Üore.‚Äù  
[1] Use the thin, 
runny cyano-
acrylate glue, not, 
as you might 
think, the gel type. 
e little tubes 
will work, but only 
for very small 
repairs. I usually 
buy 1- or 2-ounce 
bottles. Use a 
disposable 
eyedropper.
[2] Pick up some 
baking soda  
by dipping the 
glue-Ô¨Ålled 
eyedropper into it. 
Saturate the 
baking soda with 
glue, and transfer 
the mixture to 
your workpiece.

necessary.
Chain Lube
   is Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä foams  
out of the can, so  
it penetrates like a 
light oil and then 
gels into something 
Ô¨Üicky that is 
reluant to come

makes chain lube 
good for getting

especially one that 
may be exposed to

high speeds. It

the tires spin on the rims and make 
them out of balance. RuGlyde is a 
lubricant intended specifically for 
rubber, and it dries to a slightly 
grippy Ô¨Ålm. It‚Äôs also good for inÔ¨Üall-
ing handles on tools, or inserting 
rubber grommets and bushings. 
Sure, soap‚Äîor Jamie‚Äôs favorite, 
lard‚Äîmakes a great lube, but lard 
Ô¨Üays slippery forever. RuGlyde will 
also keep rubber black and shiny, 
but not slippery like Armor All. 
Ever push down on the brake pedal 
of a car that‚Äôs been detailed with 
Armor All? Dangerous!
Loite
Sure, this anaerobic threadlocker will 
keep parts from self-dismantling, but 
think‚Äîif it adheres to the threads to 
keep a nut from spinning oÔ¨Ä, it also 
fills the voids with polymers, not 
water and rust, allowing you to 
remove that nut years later. 
Carb Cleaner
It‚Äôs the universal solvent. Yes, you 
can use it to clean carburetors and 
other fuel-syÔ¨Üem parts, but it‚Äôs also 
great for chasing vacuum leaks. Idle 
the engine and spray carb cleaner 
near the suspeed leak. If the idle 
peaks up and down, carb cleaner is 
being sucked into the leak, brieÔ¨Çy 
fattening the lean mix.
I usually prefer carb cleaner for 
Ô¨Üarting balky engines. It works juÔ¨Ü 
as well as ether, but it‚Äôs not as 
deÔ¨Üruive. I once watched a guy 
blow a conneing rod right through 
Baby-Bottle 
Nipples
  Movable shas 
or cables need a 
boot or seal to 
keep out dirt and 
water and keep in 
lubrication. Jamie 
uses silicone baby-
bottle nipples, 
which have a 
small-diameter 
hole at the small 
end to take the 
cable or sha. 
ey‚Äôre really great 
for assemblies 
with a high angle 
of deÔ¨Çeion.
Liquid  
Electrical Tape
  It‚Äôs intended for 
use on elerical 
conneions out 
in the weather. 
It‚Äôs also handy to 
repair bowden 
cables with 
dis integrating 
sheaths, and to 
keep salt and 
moiÔ¨Üure away 
from faÔ¨Üeners. My 
favorite use is as a 
brushable masking 
agent for spraying 
paint. JuÔ¨Ü peel  
it oÔ¨Ä later.

Stainless-Steel 
Wire 
  Jamie recom-
mends baling wire, 
which is made from 
thicker, soer Ô¨Üeel. 
(It‚Äôs called baling 
wire, for you city 
guys, because you 
use it to bale hay 
on the farm.) Such 
wire makes a great 
permanent hose 
clamp, especially 
on small- diameter 
rubber hoses.

trying to Ô¨Üart it with ether. 
Can‚Äôt get that tire to 
seat its bead no matter 
how much compressed air 
you blow in? Spray 2 sec-
onds‚Äô worth of carb cleaner 
into the tire, Ô¨Çick your Bic, 
and poof ! InÔ¨Üantly seated 
and inÔ¨Çated tire. If you try 
this, I won‚Äôt be responsible 
for any singed eyebrows or 
pinched fingers. I reserve 
this trick for when I‚Äôm 
repairing a Ô¨Çat way out in 
the woods and the alterna-
tive is freezing to death.
Kano Kroil
It‚Äôs not a lubricant; it‚Äôs a 
penetrating oil. And it will 
penetrate into and loosen 
up stuff you‚Äôd otherwise 
have to torch apart. Spray 
the faÔ¨Üeners with Kroil  daily 
for a week or two. Whack 
the part with a ball-peen 
hammer a half-dozen times 
every day to set up some 
high-frequency vibrations to 
pulverize the ruÔ¨Ü inside the 
joint. is Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä penetrates 
Ô¨Üuck parts better than any-
thing I‚Äôve ever used, which 
makes the trip to the indus-
trial supply house worth it. 
Baling Wire/ 
Safety Wire
ere has been a spool of 
0.032-inch Ô¨Üainless aircra	 
safety wire on the top shelf 
of my toolbox for 30 years. 
(Okay, not the same one.)  
I use it for a lot more than 
lock-wiring fasteners. It‚Äôs 
handy for lashing Ô¨ÜuÔ¨Ä up 
and out of the way, like a 
droopy exhauÔ¨Ü syÔ¨Üem or a 
brake caliper that‚Äôs hanging 
around while you‚Äôre work-
ing on the suspension. e 
thin, Ô¨Üainless wire is handy 
for cleaning plugged carbu-
retor jets (remember carbu-
retors?), while the  thicker 
baling wire makes a fair  
toilet snake.

Get the Lead Out
Q
I used to drive an MGB with knockoÔ¨Ä wire wheels, and 
I had this cool lead hammer to whack the ears on the 
big nut that held the wheels on. I used that hammer for 
other things, too. It was great for tapping almost anything 
made of metal, because it wouldn‚Äôt leave little hammer 
marks, no matter how hard you smacked something. 
Where can I buy one of these hammers today?
wait 5 minutes, and your 
              lead hammer is like new.
       Tip the mold up to transfer 
the lead to the mold cavity,
pretty funky, because the lead is so 
soft the ends become mushroomed. 
Ultimately, the head gets beat up so 
badly, it falls oÔ¨Ä the wooden handle. 
And that‚Äôs what happened to mine. 
You can buy new lead hammers from 
industrial suppliers but they run 
$30 or more‚Äîwhich is a little rich 
for a tool with a limited life span. But 
I found this lead-hammer mold in 
the Graham tools catalog (graham
tool.com). It lets you melt down and 
recast your old lead-hammer head 
over and over again. Sure, it‚Äôs 90 
bucks for the set, but you‚Äôll only buy it 
once. ey sell spare handles, too, so 
you can melt down and recycle all 
those old fishing sinkers, wheel 
Chisel or hacksaw the old hammer 
head apart. Clamp the handle into the 
mold. Melt the old head down with a 
propane torch. Toss in an old lead 
wheel weight or a Ô¨Åshing sinker  
to make up for any missing lead.

weights and musket balls you‚Äôve been 
hoarding for years.
Risen From the Dead 
My pickup has failed to Ô¨Üart on 
several occasions aer sitting 
overnight. In the morning, the ignition 
is dead and there is no elerical 
power at all (interior lights do not 
work). en I‚ÄôlI hook up the battery 
charger and immediately the interior 
lights come on and the truck will 
Ô¨Üart. It‚Äôs obviously not the battery 
as I have purchased a new one and 
Ô¨Üill have the same problem. I‚Äôve 
taken it to the GMC dealer and they 
can‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd anything wrong.
It‚Äôs almoÔ¨Ü certainly a bad conneion 
to the battery at the posts or the 
cables. No interior lights or dash lights 
when the key is turned on means 
either a completely dead battery, 
which would take many hours to 
charge, or simply an open conneion. 
e physical a of attaching the 
battery charger leads is diÔ¨Üurbing the 
battery connections just enough to 
make the conneion, and oÔ¨Ä you go.
I‚Äôm the kind of guy that will leave a 
meter on the front seat for the next 
non-Ô¨Üart. at will allow me to chase 
the voltage drop across every connec-
tion anywhere near the battery until I 
Ô¨Ånd the one that reads 12 volts across 
the conneion, pinpointing the prob-
lem. Other folks who may be less curi-
ous or less obsessive (you know who 
you are) will simply clean and tighten 
all the battery cables. 
Don‚Äôt forget, the problem is juÔ¨Ü as 
likely to be the ground side as it is the 
positive cable.
 
Saab Story
I have a 2001 Saab that was recently 
in a front-end accident. e airbags 
deployed, but the engine and 
everything except for the radiator 
and fan came out unscathed. Even 
though the damage is moÔ¨Üly 
cos metic, our insurance company is 
going to total the car, because we 
received a quote of over $4000 to 
replace the airbags, along with the 
sensors and computer‚Äîand the 
entire dashboard‚Äîeven though I 
haven‚Äôt found any damage to it.  
Is this normal?
Yes. MoÔ¨Ü car manufaurers recom-
mend replacing not only the airbags 
themselves, but the entire airbag sys-
tem, including the airbag controller, the 
sensors and all the wiring harness, as 
well as the dashboard and its underpin-
nings, if the airbags deploy. Four grand 
is typical. (Ouch!) e insurance com-
panies are concerned about the possi-
bility of future lawsuits if a repaired car 
is in a second accident and for some 
reason the airbags don‚Äôt deploy. So 
they prefer to total the car and wash 
their hands of the whole mess.
No surprise, many of these cars are 
P M  D I Y  A U T O  /// C A R  C L I N I C  Q + A

?
in their threads if they are never loos-
ened. If it ever becomes necessary to 
bleed the syÔ¨Üem, they can then be dif-
Ô¨Åcult to remove. I recommend semi-
annual Ô¨Çushing of old brake Ô¨Çuid. If you 
watch, and see how the old Ô¨Çuid looks 
when it comes out (it will look like 
squid ink, not clear, like new fluid), 
you‚Äôll probably agree. 
FC
eventually repaired and sold, although 
they generally must carry a salvage 
title.  Body shops buy these cars from 
the adjuÔ¨Üer, and keep them around to 
work on in slow weeks, eventually sell-
ing them to private individuals or send-
ing them oÔ¨Ä to auion.
You might try to keep the title and 
possession of this car yourself and 
have it repaired. A good 
shop should be able to 
make the airbag syÔ¨Üem as 
safe as new, by replacing 
any parts aually damaged 
with new or salvaged parts. 
I would specify new, rather 
than used, airbags.
MoiÔ¨Üure- 
Proof‚ÄîNot
I have a late-model  
Chevy Silverado that is 
used as a daily driver‚Äî 
no trailering or heavy 
loads. My dealer‚Äôs 
maintenance pamphlet 
suggeÔ¨Üs changing the 
brake Ô¨Çuid every 30,000 
miles. e dealer claims 
the brake Ô¨Çuid can absorb 
moiÔ¨Üure and become very 
hot, thus juÔ¨Üifying a 
change. My vehicle has 
ABS and it seems to me 
this could cause more 
harm then good.
GM agrees with you that 
brake Ô¨Çuid never needs to 
be replaced. They seem  
to be the only manufac-
turer that doesn‚Äôt recom-
mend periodic Ô¨Çushing of 
old  Ô¨Çuid. e issue, as you 
suggeÔ¨Ü, is water contami-
nation, which lowers the 
boiling point of the contaminated Ô¨Çuid 
to a level where hot brakes might 
make it boil, reducing brake eÔ¨Äeive-
ness. ere are elerical teÔ¨Üers and 
disposable Ô¨Ürips to check the mois-
ture content of brake Ô¨Çuid. 
But there‚Äôs a second issue. The 
brake-bleeder bolts in the calipers or 
wheel cylinders will eventually freeze

Ruggedize Your Own Tech
HOW MUCH FOAM AND PLASTIC 
DOES IT TAKE TO SAVE  
ORDINARY GADGETS FROM 
EVERYDAY DISASTERS?  
BY ANTHONY VERDUCCI  
AND GLENN DERENE
P H O T O G R A P H S  B Y  J E F F R E Y  W E S T B R O O K
Portable eleronic devices can be 
subjeed to some serious knocks, 
drops and sticky situations‚Äîfrom 
tumbles off tables to toilet-bowl 
splashdowns. In response, an entire 
subseion of the personal eleron-
ics induÔ¨Üry has evolved to produce 
ruggedized tech. These water-
resistant, shockproof gadgets are 
designed to prote delicate circuitry 
from clumsy spills and from the 
unforgiving environments of messy 
jobs (police work, conÔ¨Üruion) and 
outdoor recreation. But they o	en 
coÔ¨Ü more and skimp on features.
We‚Äôre so used to giving gadgets 
beatings in our abusive lab teÔ¨Üs that 
we‚Äôve o	en wondered juÔ¨Ü how much 
extra tinkering it would take to elevate 
a garden-variety nonruggedized prod-
uct into a masochistic gizmo that 
could take a considerable licking and 
come back for more. When we raised 
the queÔ¨Üion with the MythBuÔ¨Üers, 
Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, it 
got our gueÔ¨Ü editors‚Äô gears spinning 
with ideas, and they delivered a

Dell Inspiron into a 
ruggedized laptop, we 
created a shockproof 
exoskeleton.

laundry liÔ¨Ü of materials that we could 
tape, glue or otherwise wrap around 
our eleronics to toughen them up. 
So, equipped with little more than 
the collective educated guesses of 
Jamie, Adam and our Ô¨ÜaÔ¨Ä as to what 
might work, we bought three 
devices‚Äîa Dell Inspiron 1545 laptop 
($400); a Nokia 5310 phone ($50 with 
T-Mobile contra); and a Nikon Coolpix 
S220 ($150)‚Äîthen made several trips 
to Home Depot, Staples and Sports 
Authority to pick up supplies. 
Phone
Our theory was that the easieÔ¨Ü piece 
of equipment to ruggedize would be 
our Nokia cellphone. Most mobile 
phones are built to withÔ¨Üand everyday 
drops and splashes. But we wanted a 
phone that could survive an angry 
throw across a room in response to a 
dropped call, and repeated dunks in 
water. Our Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü trick was to surround 
the edges of our candy-bar Ô¨Üyle cell-
phone with multiple large rubber 
bands to create a ‚Äúbumper‚Äù so thick it 
bounced when we dropped it. Sure 
enough, when we tossed it into the 
wall, it bounced to the Ô¨Çoor, but never 
broke or turned oÔ¨Ä.
For our Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü attempt at waterproof-
ing, we wrapped the phone with a 
clear heat-shrink film designed for 
dra	-sealing household windows, then 
went over it gently with a heat gun to 
mold it to the phone. We muÔ¨Ü have 
missed a spot, because when we 
dunked our Nokia, water leaked in and 
we were forced to perform an emer-
gency shrink-wrap-eomy to keep the 
water from shorting out the phone.
Obviously, we needed a more reli-
able solution, so next we tried vacuum-
sealing the phone in a plastic bag 
using a FoodSaver device. e kitchen 
gadget was a bit too enthusiastic, 
however‚Äîit sealed our phone inside 
the bag and suioned all of the but-
tons down at once, making it impossi-
ble to dial. We cut it free and retried 
the vacuum seal on the FoodSaver‚Äôs 
‚Äúpulse‚Äù mode, which allowed us to 
modulate the vacuum action. The 
results were good. Our bumperized, 
vacuum-sealed phone took all the 
impas and water torture we could 
subject it to. But our solution was 
inherently temporary‚Äî
there was no way to 
recharge the phone with-
out breaking the seal. 
Still, our fix would be 
more than adequate for 
a weekend boating trip.
Camera
Phones are largely 
solid-state products, 
with few moving parts 
to bump around, but 
cameras are a diÔ¨Äerent 
Ô¨Üory. With multiple lens 
elements and mechani-
cal zoom components, 
even pocket-size digital 
cameras can be fragile inÔ¨Üruments. 
There are plenty of affordable, rug-
gedized, water-resiÔ¨Üant cameras on 
the market, so we Ô¨Ågured there had 
to be a way to build in this level of per-
formance ourselves. 
WaterprooÔ¨Ång turned out to be the 
easy part. As watersports enthusiaÔ¨Üs 
already know, zip-lock plaÔ¨Üic bags pro-
vide a formidable moiÔ¨Üure barrier, so 
juÔ¨Ü sealing our camera in a plaÔ¨Üic bag 
made it dunkable.
Ruggedizing our Nikon turned out 
to be a far harder proposition. We 
made things diÔ¨Écult for ourselves by 
picking a camera with a telescoping 
lens, which needed special proteion. 
We surrounded the lens with a seion 
of small-diameter PVC tubing and 
glued a $5 ultraviolet lens Ô¨Ålter to the

Water 
Everyone 
knows water 
and circuitry 
don‚Äôt go well together. 
Funny thing is, pure H2O 
won‚Äôt harm eleronics‚Äî
it‚Äôs the im purities that

Sand and Ô¨Åne 
dirt are like

buttons, clog airÔ¨Çow and 
short out circuit boards. 
Take regular passes over 
your digital gear with

Wrapping It Up
We tried several 
taics to make 
our cellphone 
watertight, from 
vacuum sealing 
with a FoodSaver 
[1] to shrink-
wrapping with 
plaÔ¨Üic window 
insulation using  
a heat gun [2].  
A dunk in a glass 
of water [3] 
showed which 
techniques 
worked‚Äîand 
which were full

dents, but deep down, we had hoped 
to create a supercamera. We didn‚Äôt.
Laptop
To be honeÔ¨Ü, we fully expeed to 
deÔ¨Üroy the laptop. A computer has so 
many fragile parts‚Äîspinning drives, 
LCD screen, open ports‚Äîthat we had a 
hard time imagining an outcome that 
didn‚Äôt involve a duÔ¨Üpan and a broom. 
Our moÔ¨Ü basic goal was that our 
Dell Inspiron would be able to with-
Ô¨Üand a drop from a 3-foot-tall desk 
and a bath from a tipped-over cup of 
coÔ¨Äee. For impa resiÔ¨Üance, we cre-
ated an exoskeleton of foam-core 
boards with thick foam weatherÔ¨Ürip-
ping on the Ô¨Çat surfaces, pipe insula-
tion at the edges and halved tennis 
balls attached to the corners. en we 
wrapped the whole thing in a foam-
tape membrane. AirÔ¨Çow was an issue, 
so we carved out sections of foam 
over the intake and exhauÔ¨Ü vents.
We initially shopped around for a 
molded silicone keyboard cover, but 
our Inspiron was new to market at the 
time and no manufaurers had a mold 
for it yet, so we cut a sheet of clear 
polyethylene to cover the keyboard 
and trackpad surface. en we created 
a Ô¨Çip-up skirt from 40-mil PVC to shed 
liquid oÔ¨Ä the edges, while Ô¨Üill allowing 
access to ports, plugs and the optical 
drive. Finally, just in case water still 
managed to threaten the sides of our 
laptop, we sprayed the USB, video out, 
and power ports with mineral-oil lubri-
cant, then squished in two-part cus-
tom earplug putty from Ear Plug 
SuperÔ¨Üore to create a DIY injeion 
mold. When removed, these became 
perfe watertight plugs to prote all 
of the side ports on the machine.
en we unleashed hell on our poor 
laptop. We dropped it from 2 feet, 
then 3 feet, then 6 feet, then 8 feet. 
Then came a tall cup of piping-hot 
French roaÔ¨Ü‚Äîwith three sugars and 
cream. e padded Dell bounced back 
from all our drops, and the cup of joe 
shed right oÔ¨Ä the surface of the lap-
top. rough it all, our computer kept 
computing. Maybe we hadn‚Äôt engi-
neered the prettieÔ¨Ü of solutions, but it 
sure turned out tough.
FC
Cutting to Fit
Cameras have lots 
of moving parts 
and fragile lenses. 
We padded our 
point-and-shoot 
as beÔ¨Ü we could 
with weather-
Ô¨Üripping and 
foam tape, then 
surrounded the 
zoom lens with 
a seion of PVC 
pipe. Applying 
foam tape can  
be tricky ‚Äîwe 
needed to cut 
around the con-
trols and Ô¨Çash.
Foam Is  
Your Friend
We put Jamie‚Äôs 
tip into aion, 
padding exterior 
surfaces with foam 
weather Ô¨Üripping 
and pipe insulation, 
then taping sec-
tioned tennis balls 
to the corners [1]. 
To create water-
tight plugs for USB 
ports, we used 
two-part cuÔ¨Üom 
earplug putty as an 
injeion mold [2].

front of our barrel to allow for clearer 
shots than we were getting through 
our plaÔ¨Üic bag. To prote the corners 
and edges, we used foam tape and 
weatherÔ¨Üripping, making sure to leave 
the Ô¨Çash and controls uncovered. en 
we zipped the digicam back into its 
plaÔ¨Üic bag, cut a hole for the protec-
tive lens barrel, smeared silicone 
around the seams and let it dry. 
When we dunked it in water again, 
we learned an important lesson: Use 
silicone on both sides of any seal. 
Water crept in through our sloppy job 
and almoÔ¨Ü deÔ¨Üroyed the camera. We 
had to remove it from the bag and 
leave it out to dry. When we did a more 
thorough job of silicone sealing, the 
Nikon survived its next submersion.
Our impact test produced mixed 
results. We tried drops from 3 and 5 
feet to simulate the fumbles of the 
common klutz. The padded Nikon 
came through all of them without dam-
age. But when we pushed our luck and 
dropped our camera from 8 feet, our 
UV Ô¨Ålter shattered, and the shock gave 
the camera an irreconcilable ‚Äúlens 
error.‚Äù We accomplished our main goal 
of protecting against everyday acci-

AS A SERVICE TO READERS,  
Popular Mechanics publishes 
news worthy products, techniques, 
and scientiÔ¨Åc and technological 
developments. Due to possible 
variance in the quality and 
condition of materials and 
workmanship, Popular Mechanics 
cannot assume responsibility for 
proper application of techniques or 
proper and safe functioning of 
manufactured products or 
reader-built projects resulting from 
information published in  
this magazine.
with Adobe‚Äôs $700 Photoshop, but 
unless you are skilled with some of the 
program‚Äôs more complex controls, it‚Äôs 
easier to use HDRso	‚Äôs Photomatix 
Pro so	ware ($99), which makes the 
process virtually turnkey.
e Ô¨ÅrÔ¨Ü Ô¨Üep is to pick your subje. 
e HDR eÔ¨Äe looks beÔ¨Ü in scenes 
that have lots of shadows and high-
lights, such as outdoor shots at dusk 
or cityscapes at night (although por-
traits and indoor shots can look 
appealingly spooky). And if it‚Äôs cloudy 
out, you can create dramatic, ominous 
images of cumulus-Ô¨Ålled skies.
When taking the pictures, you‚Äôll 
want to follow what I call the Goldi-
locks rule: Shoot at leaÔ¨Ü one photo 
that‚Äôs overexposed, one that‚Äôs under-
exposed and one that‚Äôs juÔ¨Ü right. You 
can change the camera‚Äôs exposure 
manually and shoot these separately 
(in which case you will deÔ¨Ånitely need 
a tripod, which is probably a good idea 
anyway), but if your camera has auto-
exposure bracketing (or AEB), as moÔ¨Ü 
new digital SLRs do, it will be much 
easier. AEB allows you to quickly and 
automatically snap multiple 
shots with different expo-
sure settings.
Once you‚Äôve uploaded 
the photos, open up Photo-
matix, click ‚ÄúGenerate HDR 
Image,‚Äù and sele the pic-
tures you want to combine.
Depending on how faÔ¨Ü 
your computer is, the ren-
dering process could take 
as long as a couple of min-
utes. And when it‚Äôs done, 
you‚Äôll likely be less than 
impressed by the result, 
which will look murky and 
shadowy. That‚Äôs because 
the new image is a 32-bit 
HDR image, and LCD and 
CRT computer monitors 
juÔ¨Ü aren‚Äôt capable of show-
ing the full range of lumi-
nance necessary to bring 
out all of the details hidden 
in these images‚Äô shadows 
and highlights. To turn the 
photo into a more useful 
format, you‚Äôll need to put it 
through a process called 
tone mapping, which brings 
these details into the forefront.
You should see a window, ‚ÄúHDR 
 Viewer,‚Äù which contains a button 
labeled ‚ÄúTone Mapping.‚Äù Click it, and 
your image will Ô¨Ånally be transformed 
into a cool-looking HDR photo. In fa, 
you could probably juÔ¨Ü save this photo 
and call it a day. But it gets better.
You should now see a new window 
called ‚ÄúTone Mapping Settings.‚Äù is 
window will have a bunch of dials with 
labels such as ‚ÄúLuminosity‚Äù and ‚ÄúColor 
Saturation.‚Äù Playing with these will 
add life to your piure. Have fun pull-
ing them in every which way and 
watching your piure morph from a 
realiÔ¨Üic-looking image into a surreal 
landscape. When you‚Äôve got a piure 
you like, click the ‚ÄúProcess‚Äù button, 
and the photo will be rendered to your 
speciÔ¨Åcations in a savable format.
One more thing: It‚Äôs easy to overdo 
it with HDR, and professional photog-
raphers o	en look down on the tech-
nique as gimmicky‚Äîparticularly when 
it‚Äôs used to create shots that, rather 
than looking hyper-realistic, end up 
resembling crayon drawings. So while 
it‚Äôs fun to crank up all the settings to 
their messieÔ¨Ü max, be warned that 
such images may not get the best 
response from the photorati.

1. Thermal Immersion  
Circulator  InÔ¨Üead of sim-
mering or boiling something 
on the Ô¨Üove at medium-high 
heat, this portable device 
allows Stupak to cook to  
an exa temperature‚Äî 
for inÔ¨Üance, he can poach 
bananas for a sorbet at  
precisely 158 F.
2. Heat Gun  MoÔ¨Ü oen 
used for Ô¨Üripping paint, this 
hardware-Ô¨Üore Ô¨Üaple can 
apply heat to a very small 
area. If a tuile‚Äîa thin cookie 
confeion that resembles a 
curved roof tile‚Äîneeds to be 
bent, the gun can make an 
isolated seion more pliable.
3. Laboratory-Grade Scale  
Stupak weighs potent food 
additives (such as the trans-
glutaminase enzyme) using a 
scale that is accurate to one-
thousandth of a gram. 
4. Hydrocolloids  Oen 
called gums, these long-
chain polysaccharides have 
been used in manufauring 
foods for years. ey are 
responsible for the foams, 
gels and sauces moÔ¨Ü evident 
in molecular gaÔ¨Üronomy. 
Xanthan gum is a cold-
soluble thickener that has 
replaced Ô¨Üarch in Stupak‚Äôs 
kitchen. e viscous gellan 
gum is boiled, hydrated and 
dissolved before becoming 
the reÔ¨Üaurant‚Äôs famous fried 
mayonnaise.
5. Dewar  e reÔ¨Üaurant 
keeps a 50-liter tank for liquid 
nitrogen, which can maintain 
temperatures close to minus 
320 F. Why? For one thing, 
Stupak uses the nitrogen to 
create frozen honey.

MoÔ¨Ü chefs don‚Äôt have scientiÔ¨Üs on speed dial‚Äîbut then 
again, moÔ¨Ü chefs aren‚Äôt Alex Stupak, who praices molecular 
gaÔ¨Üronomy, or cooking with chemiÔ¨Üry-lab-worthy techniques. At New York City‚Äôs avant-
garde reÔ¨Üaurant wd-50, Stupak Ô¨Üarts with a traditional dish, then designs something 
new‚Äîsuch as balsamic vinegar encapsulated in vanilla ice-cream nuggets‚Äîusing high-end 
food additives and unusual equipment. e Ô¨Çavor combinations and textures are intriguing, 
and the food taÔ¨Ües great‚Äîwhich is what Stupak and his cuÔ¨Üomers really care about. ‚ÄúWith 
molecular gaÔ¨Üronomy, people expe the unexpeed,‚Äù Stupak says. ‚ÄúBut if hydrocolloid 
gums and liquid nitrogen didn‚Äôt exiÔ¨Ü, creative food Ô¨Üill would.‚Äù  ‚Äî KATE SCHWEITZER
