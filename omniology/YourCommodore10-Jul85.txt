PICTURE IT. ANOTHER SLEEPY AFTER-
noon in the heart of suburbia. In a living
room resplendent with rich furnishings
and potted plants, a blade of sunlight cuts
through a  gap in the drawn curtains,
directed at Adenoid Anthony as he sits
before the TV screen, Commodore 64 at
his knees, discarded software to his left
and joystick ﬁrmly clasped in his right
hand.
It's teatime and Anthony's tastes are
changing. Green things from outer space
are as stale as old cake crumbs, platforms
and ladders have met the same fate as
used tea bags and most adventures offer
as many thrills and spills as watching the
milk c urdle i n  Auntie Elsie's Royal
Wedding souvenir milk jug. No pretty
graphics scroll before Anthony's eyes, no
revamped pop songs rock his ear drums.
In their  place, stretches a  mass o f
instruments, dials and switches a  realistic
interpretation (depending o n  whic h
simulator Anthony has loaded into his 64)
of the instrument panel of a real, live
aeroplane. In fact, it is so realistic that
Anthony is quite oblivious to Rover as he -
ravages the last remaining pirated copy of
Raid Over Moscow (... the one for which,
in true Le Carre style, he'd hoped to extort
vast sums o f  money from little Igor
Bogolovich at the Embassy school).
The engine rumbles, the speed and
Anthony's adrenalin rise in unison and
the altimeter needle swings gradually to
the right as the plane leaves the runway,
shooting into the wild blue yonder over a
patchwork of rapidly shrinking terrain.
Anthony 's  c o n c e n t r a t i o n  i s
momentarily diverted as  t he shapely
stewardess steps tentatively in t o  t h e
cockpit; stis mum with a lukewarm cup of
tea. But, our intrepid pilot keeps his cool
and the plane remains on course.
Not for long. As with all good air
disaster movies (are there any good air
disaster movies?), the hi-jacker enters the
scene. This one's a right smart alec. Not
only is he trying to show the pilot who's
boss, but he even wants to have a goat the
controls himself. "Looks lik e a  good
wheeze, Anthony; reminds me of my days
in the RAF". "No old war stories now,
dad; I must concentrate". "lust a quick go
...". When I've ﬁnished ...". "Now look
here, son; who bought you that computer
anyway?". What can our hero do in the
face of such adversity? Nothing. Force
prevails and, with control in the hands of
His Bossiness, before you can say 'bombs
away', the screen ﬂashes and the plane
crashes. The dream is broken.
'Has the editor ﬂipped her lid?', I hear
you ask. W e  k n o w  that prolonged
exposure to typewriters has been known
to be ruinous to one's health, but we hope
the poor dear realises she is producing a
computer magazine and not a toss-up
between a ﬂight manual and a book at
bedtime.
Fear n o t ,  d e a r  readers , Y o u r
Commodore has merely caught a spot of
Biggles fever this month (must be the
effect of all those VE day celebrations).
And this is all a rather convoluted way of
inviting our  readers o n  board for  a
journey through an assortment of ﬂight
simulators available for  the 64. These
cover a very broad spectrum of planes
from gliders and helicopters t o  747
airliners and spitﬁres.
Having got off to a ﬂying start with our
reviews, we hope to take you one step
further with our air-raising competition -
a chance to win not only Anirog's Super
Sketch but also one of 50 copies of the
newest of the new ﬂight simulators, Jump
Jet, which promises to be an excellent
follow-up t o  Anirog's already ultra-
successful Flight Path 737. Jump Jet even
contains speech, something which any
self-respecting computer program should
own nowadays. What more could an
aspiring pilot ask for?
Over arid out.

When no news might be good news
I'VE CONCLUDED THAT THE SCARCITY
of news on these pages may be attributed
to one of two things -  either, all the
software houses in the country have gone
bust and nobody's told us or all the
goodies are being held in store for the
Summer show season.
The ﬁrst show of any interest to Com-
modore users is the 1985 Commodore
Computer Show to be held in Hammer-
smith on the 7th. 8th and 9th of June,
20,000 Commodore fans are expected to
attend the show. Commodore are hoping
to attract such a crowd with their 'three-
machines-in-one  computer - the 128, on
show to the British public for the ﬁrst
time. Other attractions will include a
computer games arcade and a separate
business section and (wait for it
celebrity appearances (then why haven't I
been asked? - ed.). computer challenge
competitions, prize draws and a Music
Maker orchestra.
Prize for the 'giga-show' (that's even
bigger than a 'mega-show') of the year
must go the Personal Computer World
Show to be held at Olympia, London from
4-8 September. This caters for trade
buyers, business and professional end-
users as well as all home computer users
and enthusiasts, Not satisﬁed with last
year's one hall, the exhibitors will now
spread their wares over two halls - home
computing in  the National Hall and
business in Olympia 2, Commodore are
already amongst those w h o  have
accepted the kind invitation to attend.
The emphasis is on advice, especially to
the business end of the market, which will
be given through seminars and individual
attention a t  t h e N C C  Micrysystems
Centre, for example. What new offerings
there will be on the home front, we shall
have to wait and see.
Heath is House bound
GEOFFREY HEATH HAS SWITCHED ALL-
egiances from Activision to Melbourne

Director and a member of the Board of
Directors of the company.
Melbourne House have a staff of 50.
including 20 full-time programmers, and
already have a ﬁne reputation for pro-
ducing top qualtly software. They are
hoping that Geoffrey Heath will bless
their games with some of that magic
which has already made Activision one of
the foremost producers of software game.
"We feel extremely positive about our
position in this very competitive industry
and a r e  conﬁdent that Geoffrey's
appointment will greatly beneﬁt our
company and its  goals", says Alfred
Milgrom, Publisher and co-founder of
Melbourne House.

THE R A M j A M  C O R PO R AT I O N ,
creators of the excellent 64 adventure,
Valkyrie 17, are to serve a three year
sentence under the auspices of Ariolasoft.
They are following in the footsteps of
American companies Electronic Arts,
Broderbund and Batteries Included, but
are the ﬁrst British company to sign an
exclusive licensing agreement w it h
Ariolasoft.
Ramlam's next offering is  entitled
•Three Days in Carpathia' and is supposed
to b e  'sophisticated, witty  and very
different'. Time will tell!
Ramjam spokesman, George Stone, is
certainly happy with the new set-up. He
sees it as an opportunity to stick to what
he likes doing best - producing games -
while the big boys get on with the job of
making a proﬁt.

MICRONET IS DOING ITS UTMOST
to entice Commodore users away from
Compunet. Having realised that many
Commodore 64 programs are not being
distributed in an efﬁcient and simple way,
they reckon they've come u p with a
solution.
Micronet 800 has  commissioned
Y2 Computing Ltd t o  design a  new
protocol to make uploading telesoftware
easier and downloading more powerful
for a  w id e r  range o f  commercial
Commodore software. Micronet believes
that the new uploader has a success rate of
90%.
Many of the programs uploaded to the
new protocol can still be downloaded to
the new protocol and, if you bought a
cartridge before t h e  change, those
generous souls at Micronet will send out
new terminal software free of charge.
Micronet has given details of the new
protocol to a number of manufacturers
producing 6 4  hardware a n d  expect
modem manufacturers t o  adopt t h e
standard.
In a further bid to attract Commodore
users, Micronet has established a new
communications pac k age f o r  t h e
Commodore modem user. They have re-
written their Prestel terminal software for
Compunet members to include a down-
loader written to the new communica-
tions protocol. Previously, Compunet
members could only  obtain a  Prestel
terminal package that didn't download
any Micronet telesoftware. But, many
Commodore modem users wer en't
joining C o m p u n e t  s o  M i c r o n e t
distributed a complete terminal package
for t h e  Commodore modem, thus
allowing any Commodore modem user to
join Micronet without joining Compunet
ﬁrst.

Sing-along-a-Mozart
MOZART HAS A LOT TO ANSWER FOR!
Following in the wake of his stage and ﬁlm
debut, he is now to be immortalised on
cassette or disc.
Commodore hope to teach budding
musicians to play a wide range of music
with the latest addition to their Music
Maker software. There are three choices
of albums -  pop hits (including Rod
Stewart, T he Animals o r  Abba, f o r
example). t h e  Beatles a n d  popular
classics. The songs are accompanied by a
music book, and an instruction booklet is
provided with the software.
Although the software packages have
been designed for use with the musical
keyboard overlay provided w it h  t he
Music maker program, each package
may be used individually. Compositions
may be played in one of four modes:
Concert, Rehearsal, Single Key  and
Performance. Tuning and tempo may be
selected and Midi, Omni, Poly and Mono
modes allow the program to be linked
with Midi synthesiser keyboards. And, if
you really wish to commence battle with
the neighbours, you can interface the
7
 computer with a hi-ﬁ system.
The Music Maker 'Play Along Albums'
cost £9.99 each and are available on
cassette or disc.

ONCE UPON A TIME, IN THE BOWELS
of the Your Commodore ofﬁces, there sat
a bored young journalist. Searching for
some light relief from the drudgery of
pumping news into her ﬂashy new word
processor (wishful thinking - ed.)(This is a
fairy story - bored young journalist), she
espied a box.' Twas not any-old-box, nay,'
twas Orpheus' new game, Elidon.
Thereupon, she loaded the game. The
screen was painted with a  beautiful
creature - a faerie who ﬂitted around the
secret forest of Elidon, through hundreds
of detailed forest glades, in search of the
seven magical ﬂowers of Finvarra. On her
intrepid journey, in the face of many dark
and sinister forces, she was accompanied
by the ethereal music of Grieg.

Expiry Date:

Take to the skies with John
Farrar as he zooms on a
selection of Commodore
ﬂight simulators.
MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH A COMP-
uterised ﬂight simulator was a  Psion
program on a friend's 2X81. Considering
the limitations of the computer I thought
it was amazingly realistic. From that
moment t h e  h u n t  was  o n  f o r  a
comparable program. It's been a long wait
but it's been worth it for now there is a
veritable barrage of ﬂight simulators on
the market.
The ﬂight simulators are as varied as
the types of aircraft in the skies so I have
divided them into groups -  based on
military aircraft, airliners and so on. If
plenty of action is more to your taste, then
opt for the military versions. Or, should
you wish t o  b e  responsible for  100
passengers then try ﬂying a 737. The light
aircraft versions, especially the SubLogic
program, p r o v i d e  a n  e x c e lle n t
introduction to ﬂight and navigation in
general. So, let's strap ourselves in tight
and take-off into the wide blue yonder.
Military aircraft
The McDonnell Douglas F-1.5 jet ﬁghter is
a high performance aircraft capable of
speeds in excess of 1,500 mph and a
ceiling o f  65,000 feet, T o match this
performance, its weapon and defensive
systems are equally impressive.
There are two programs available for
this aircraft one being Fighter Pilot from
Digital Integration. This program provides
a menu of options enabling, the user to
select landing practice, combat practice,
combat, bad weather etc. All very useful
and each good fun in their own right. The
main combat task is to shoot down a

bomber which is hell-bent on destroying
your airﬁelds. If you succeed another
appears on the scene and so on. There is
an on-board guidance system to help
locate the enemy. This is backed up by a
detailed map which shows your position
relative to the enemy aircraft and your
airﬁelds. If you survive long enough, as
the bombers shoot back, the fuel situation
will become critical, creating the need to
land assuming there is an airﬁeld still in
tact of  course. Beacons and a landing
system are available but it is not easy. The
displays are well done and excellent use is
made of sound and graphics throughout
the program. This program has had
deserved success since its launch some
months ago. For a fuller review see the
April issue.
The other program based on the F-is
Strike Eagle from US Gold. In Fighter Pilot
the weapons are limited to cannons but in
Strike Eagle the full weapon has been
incorporated including head-on displays
in the cockpit view. Bombs, cannons,
rockets, decoy ﬂares, electronic jamming
- they are all here. You will need them,
plus all your luck and skill, as there are 6
difﬁcult missions to complete. The idea is
that you destroy the primary targets on
each mission but you will have to contend
with enemy  aircraft ﬁr ing air-to-air
missiles and SAM missiles sites ﬁring heat-
seeking missiles.
Unlike Fighter Pilot there are no take-
off or landing sequences. Assuming that
you survive long enough, y o u  ar e
airborne throughout. To refuel and re-
arm it is only necessary to ﬂy over your
home base. Varying levels of difﬁculty can
be selected, with the easiest, Arcade,
providing a  permanently horizontal
horizon. The graphics and sound are
excellent and t h e  aircraft responds
immediately to control movements. The
excellent 36 page manual states that "The
F-15 cockpit is a complex and stressful
working environment". They are not
kidding! I reviewed this program in detail
in the May issue.
The ﬁnal program in this category is
Spitﬁre 40 from Mirrorsoft. There are just
three scenarios to choose from: practice.
combat practice and combat. You are a
young Spitﬁre pilot in 1940, and must
undergo thorough training before going
into combat against the might of the
Luftwaffe. So, onc e again, plenty o f
practice is required.
Three displays can be called up the
instrument panel, whic h is  brilliantly
done, the view from the cockpit window
and ﬁnally a map of the South East of
England. The scale of the latter can be
altered, which is useful, as it is used to
locate y our  airﬁeld and t h e  enemy
aircraft. I was not too keen on having to
toggle between t h e  instrument and
cockpit displays, as I found it broke the
continuity of the program, particularly for
landing approaches. However, if it was
=

necessary in order to provide such an
excellent instrument display then I'll put
up with it! I would have liked the aircraft,
shown on the map, to move, but the
manual states that this is a means of
providing a 'pause' in the program, which
it does. Oh well...
The program aims to simualte the
ﬂying characteristics of the Spitﬁre and
the epic dogﬁghts of those 'Famous Few'.
It easily achieves this with excellent use of
the 64's graphics although the sound can
get a bit monotonous on a long sortie.
One good idea is the ability to save your
ﬂying time and 'kills'. I would like to see
more use of this facility. The accumulation
of hours and skill raises your rank through
the R.A.F. 60 hours and the rank of Group
Captain allows you to enter a Mirrorsoft
competition. So "Tally Ho! chaps".
Airliner
Flight Path 737 by Anirog has been around
for some time now. The objective is t9
takeoff from the home airﬁeld, ﬂy over
some mountains and land the other side.
That's all there is to it! There are the usual
levels of difﬁculty but the lowest is hard
enough. The cockpit instruments are of
the digitaly ty pe and are clear and
concise.
From takeoff to the landing approach
sequence, it is necessary to keep within
the parameters for various controls. For
example, the ﬂaps cannot be raised below
300 feet and at less than 160 kts, The
mountains ar e w ell drawn and t h e
graphics and sound are adequate. I found
lining up the aircraft with the runway, at
the start of each ﬂight, a little tedious. My
real gripe is with some awful spelling on
one message "ACCENT TO SLOW" Yuk !
This is inexcusable. The cassette label
claims that this is an 'Advanced ﬂight
trainer' which I think is going a bit far.
Nevertheless, I found this program to be
good "fun and very addictive, which is,
after all, what software should be.
Doctor Soft's 747 ﬂight simulator was
written with the assistance of a British
Airways captain, this program allows you
the freedom o f  t h e  nor th eastern
European air routes. Starting initially from
Heathrow, y o u  c a n  s elec t y o u r
destination and, assuming y ou hav e
developed the necessary skills, you can
roam the skies to your heart's content
using navigation beacons.
The Keyboard controls are sensibly
allocated (B=brakes,F=ﬂaps etc ) and
practice modes are available. When the
joystick is moved left or right, the horizon
tilts accordingly on the simple, 30 view
through t h e  window. Environmental
conditions can be reset to alter cloud base
and top, day or night ﬂight, windspeed,
and the starting point can be changed.
An added feature is a fantasy zone with
weird shapes and effects located over the
North Sea. The documenatation fully

Jumbo jet controls become the main
concern to users of DACC's 747 Flight
Simulator. The engine guages alone give
the individual status of each engine with
regard to spool speed, gas temperature,
pressure ratios and fuel ﬂow. Flaps can be
partially extended, aileron and elevator
positions are shown and a warning panel
ﬂashes signals to the pilot of impending
trouble, emphasised by an audio signal.
One disconcerting feature o f  this
program is that although the artiﬁcial
horizon on the instrument panel indicates
that the jet is banking, the view through
the cockpit window remains resolutely
horizontal.
Navigation is performed with the aid of
a simple direction ﬁnder, leaving the pilot
to worry about landing preparations.
The ﬂight manual gives full instructions
on the purpose of each gauge but a few
words on ﬂight principles would not go
amiss.
Varied
The aircraft in this section are as different
as chalk and cheese. One simulator is for a
helicopter and the other for a glider.
The helicopter simulator is  Super
Huey from US Gold. I understand that it is
also available from Audiogenic label a few
Ls less than the £11.95 for Super Huey.
Helicopters are a familiar sight in the skies
over my home, in SW Cornwall, with
hardly a month going by when we don't
hear that another dramatic rescue has
been carried out. The Fastnet Race of a
few years ago vividly springs to mind.
Therefore, it was with eager anticipation
that I loaded in Super Huey for the ﬁrst
time.
As with most of the ﬂight simulators
already mentioned, Super Huey  i s
accompanied by a comprehensive ﬂight
manual. Once again, essential reading, as
rotary-wing aircraft area 'different kind of
ﬂying -  altogether'. You will learn terms
like c y c lic  m o d e  a n d  c ollec tiv e
mode, which relate to the control of the
rotor blades and the tail rotor, A joystick is
a must for this program, preferably with
the ﬁre button on the top, as it is used to
toggle between modes. There is  the
customary practice session to help you
'get o f f  t h e  ground'. The on-board
computer guides you through the stages
of take-off, ﬂying and landing. At this
point I have to say that the graphics and
sound effects are stunning. The cockpit
display is incredibly detailed and, as the
helicopter gains height, surrounding
buildings and radar aerials dwindle in
size. Pushing the stick forward provides
forward momentum and soon trees and
bushes are whizzing by the cabin screen.
Climb t o  ov er  3000 feet and they
disappear from sight_ All the while, you
are accompanied by the familiar sound of
the engine and rotor blades. Great stuff!
This sets you up to tackle the other
missions o n  the program. These are
Rescue, Combat and Exploration. As they
have t o  b e  loaded separately, i t  is
necessary to record the tape counter
readings in order to quickly locate each
program. I  have to say that, after the
promise of the training ﬂight, I found
=

S o f t w a r e  r e v i e w s
these other missions t o  b e  a  great
disappointment. T he manual, whic h
explains the physics of helicopter ﬂight in
some detail, does very little to explain
how to accomplish the missions. Neither
are the on-board computer and radar
systems particularly helpful. The graphics
in Rescue a r e  awful, bear ing n o
resemblance to mountain terrain at all. In
Combat, the ﬁre button ﬁres the rockets
and cannons, but it  also controls the
aircraft!! I t  is necessary to type three
letters to access the various systems. R AD
for Radar, for instance. Surely, just R
would have done? I n  addition, t he
program rarely reacts to keyboard presses
as it should.
It is almost worth buying the program
for the training ﬂight alone but I have to
say that it is a great shame that the other
missions were not better implemented.
Perhaps there is a MK2 version on the
way? I hope so.
Glider Pilot by CRL provides the user
with just one task — that o f  ﬂying a
triangular course of approximately 160
kms. T o  pr ov ide variation t o  this
objective, the program has ﬁve levels of
weather conditions f r om w hic h t o
choose, or you can program your own.
The manual explains the techniques of
cross-country ﬂight a n d  soaring i n
sufﬁcient detail for the uninitiated. The
program takes some time to load and,
having d o n e  s o, t h e  mos t awfully
monotonous tune drones out. Perhaps it
gets better but I never listened beyond
the ﬁrst few notes!
Once t h e  c h o ic e  o f  w eather
conditions has been made, y ou ﬁnd
yourself at about 1,800 feet, close to the
start line. Crossing this starts a  clock
running as you are competing against
time. The graphic display of the analogue
cockpit instruments falls far short of what
one expects these days. The clouds,
where the thermals that provide lift for
soaring are found,are very chunky in
appearance: sprites should have been
used for these. To give the impression of
movement, an attempt has been made to
provide 3D perspective ground details. A
good touch is the provision of a detailed
graph showing the vertical path of the
glider through the air.
For those already with a declared
interest in gliding then I would think that
this program would have some appeal.
For the rest, I would say that this program
would soon be conﬁned to the shelf due
to lack of addictive qualities. At £8.95 you
would certainly need to be among the
former group.
Light aircraft
Solo Flight by Microprose was one of the
ﬁrst ﬂight simulators to appear for the 64.
In the States, some 18 months ago. Since
then it has had deserved success in the
UK, The aircraft, in this simulation, is a
single-engined 1930 vintage monoplane.
But this model is ﬁtted with up-to-date
VOR navigational radios. The cockpit
graphics a r e  adequate, i f  a  lit t le
uninspiring but everythin is clear and
concise except for the artiﬁcial horizon
display which is too small. This simulator
differs from all of lthe others in that you
are ﬂying an aircraft in front of you. The
cockpit instruments and the view out can
be seen, while in the distance is the
aircraft that you are ﬂying! After the
others, this takes getting used to, but is,
nonetheless, very enjoyable to 'ﬂy'.
The program loads quickly and then
provides options of three areas, Kansas,
Washington or Colorado. The former has
ﬂat terrain and the latter hilly terrain.
There are skill levels with varying weather
plus a  Mail Run game. I n  this it  is
necessary to deliver bags of mail from one
airﬁeld to another, against the clock and
in increasingly bad weather. The aircraft is
also liable to mechanical failure.
The manual covers all of the usual
ﬂying characteristics of the aircraft and
also explains, i n  s ome detail, t h e
techniques o f  VO R  navigation and
instrument ﬂying. Three area maps are
provided to help locate the many airﬁelds
but I felt that they could have been larger
and more detailed. Nonetheless, this is a
very enjoyable program, with enough
options and built-in 'fun' to keep you
amused for hours. I understand that a
MK2 version is to be launched soon so I
would welcome the opportunity for a 'test
ﬂight'. I f  Solo Flight (MK1) has been
improved. It will be very, very good.
To say that I am a fan of the next
program would be an understatement.
refer to Flight Simulator II by Sublogic. I
could take up most of  this magazine
explaining the ﬁner points of this program
but let me give you just a taste.
The aircraft simulated is  a  Piper
Cherokee Archer, which is  a  single-
engined, fully  aerobatic aircraft. The
program comes with two manuals, each of
90 pages. One explains the workings of
the program and fundamentals of ﬂight
and navigation, the other covers ﬂight
physics and control in greater detail. In
addition, ther e a r e  f o u r  extremely
detailed navigation maps covering the
areas of Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and
New York/Boston. I t  is  possible t o
position the aircraft at any of 80 airports in
these areas, and ﬂy between them!
The instrument display graphics are
exceptionally detailed but the 3D (solid,
not wire) perspective cockpit view is
something else. O ne o f  my  favourite
'ﬂips' is  t o  tak e o f f  fr om Kennedy
International and pass by the Empire State
Building, the United Nations twin blocks
and out into the Sound for the Statue of
Liberty. Incredible stuff. Sound is equally
impressive
Using the comprehensive 'editing'
mode, i t  is  possible t o  set u p  any
parameters you require. Cloud at two
levels, three levels of wind height, speed
and direction, plus surface wind. Time of
day and seasons of the year can be set.
Any position and attitude of the aircraft
can be pre-programmed and all this can
be saved onto another mode disc if
desired (there are nine pre-set modes
though!).
Finally, there is a World War 1 combat
program included for some bombing and
shooting practice from a biplane. Quality
such as this does not come cheaply but,
my goodness it's worth it.

TWO MORE BOOKS FOR THE RUST-
rated adventure games-player may just
save the odd one or two of us from really
going over the edge. They are The
Adventurer's Companion by Mike and
Peter Gerrard and The Commodore 64
Adventurer by Bob Chappell.
They both follow an almost identical
layout and each deal with just four well
known (and frustrating...) adventures. At
the beginning of every section is a list of
the 'problems' that you are likely to have
found. This is followed by numbered
references to each of these 'problems'.
Sections and cross refences are laid
out in such a manner, so as not to make it
too easy to learn more than you need at
any one time. This will hopefully not spoil
your continued enjoyment of the game.
However, you will have to be strong
willed not to browse!
Both books have appendices at the
back with complete maps of the listed
adventures: so again, no cheating!
The Adventurer's Companion covers
The Hobbit (Melbourne House), Colossal
Cave Adventure (Level N ine ) ,
Adventureland a nd Pirate Island
(Adventure International).
The Commodore 64 Adventurer
complements this with Heroes of Karn
(Interceptor Micros), Lords of Time (Level
Nine), Voodoo Castle and The Count
(Adventure International).
Both are published by  Gerald
Duckworth and Co., are £3.95 each and
should be  available from any good k
supplier of computer titles. Some people
frown on the use of such books but you •
only have to look at the regular pleas for
help published in the computer press to
realise just how welcome they will be.

Loading problems?
Adventures are often very large programs
and now that there are a number of 'fast
loaders' available for the Commodore 64,
we have got rid of the frustration of ﬁfteen
minute loading times. Sadly this has
introduced another possible area of
concern - the C2N cassette recorder!
Fast loaders stretch the capabilities of
Azimuth Head Alignment Tape

MIKE PETER GER
your system to the limit. This means that
not only should the heads be clean but
also that they should be  accurately
aligned to accept all of these high speed
signals. Many of the tapes sent back as not
working are perfectly alright: often it is
the cassette recorder that is not up to
scratch. Although there is always the risk
of aggravating the situation, at some stage
you have got to consider re-aligning the
recorder's heads. This can be done by trial
and error but the adjustment is quite
critical and this method is not to be
recommended!
Recently, Interceptor Micros a v e
produced an 'Azimuth Head Alignment
Tape', price (7.95, that should take the
uncertainty out of this operation. The kit
consists o f  the alignment tape, a
screwdriver, a crude but effective card
pointer and pretty comprehensive
instructions.
If your heads (!) are out of alignment,
this may be because (I) they have never
been critically aligned or, (2) the heads
have moved out of  alignment. The
adjusting screw is usually sealed in
position with a dab of paint. In case (2),
this may have cracked and the screw
turned slightly, due to the vibration
caused by the cassette motor.
A d v e n t u r e s

Run the  tape and follow the
instructions but whatever you do, before
you move anything, take a careful note of
the present setting! The simple card
pointer that is supplied may be taped or
stuck to the screwdriver u s e  it. Do not
be tempted to 'have a twiddle to see what
happens'. you could spend the next hour
trying to ﬁnd where you started from!
The adjustment for fast loaders is quite
critical and you will probably ﬁnd that
only a small amount of movement will
sweep you right through the working
area.
The tape consists of the working
program recorded at normal speed.

recorded at high speed. Once 'zeroed in'
on this high speed data, a number is

WOO. Move off the setting and the count is
zeroed and starts again as you come back
on tune.
This system is crude but effective,
providing you are not far off when you
start. As was said above: make sure you
know where you started from! Having got
the correct alignment, re-seal the
adjustment screw, either with a drop of
nail varnish remover (to soften and re-use
the original paint) or a drop of paint
(preferably cellulose). Whichever you
use, one tiny drop on the end of a cocktail
stick (or similar) is quite sufﬁcient d o
not get any in 'the works'!
Out for the Count...
Count Dracula seems to have fascinated
18 a l l  those that have heard of him ever since
Bram Stoker ﬁrst put his name to paper!
One of the all time classics is Scott Adams
The Count and he has turned up in
numerous other scenarios featured as
adventure games. Not always by name,
but the hint of a ﬂowing black cloak
coupled with the odd stake lying around,
have all us adventurers looking over our
shoulders and checking the condition of
our necks!
Two more adventures for the CBM 64
using this now familiar theme have
recently been added to those on offer.
The ﬁrst of these is from Melbourne
House (still trying to ﬁnd a successor to
The Hobbit...) called Castle of Terror; the
second is from Ducksoft (still trying...)
with Castle Dracula.
These two, although having the same
basic theme, are two very different games.
That from Melbourne House gives the
impression o f  the  more polished
program; with excellent music and good
graphics (a different one for each scene).

Whilst that from Duckworth has no
graphics or music.
Castle o f  Terror has the more
convoluted, devious plot with many
pitfalls for even the seasoned adventurer.
Buy the 'old man' a drink before the
correct time and not only have you spent
your hard earned coin, which you
apparently cannot replace but you have
also missed your opportunity to get the
clue he might otherwise have given you!
The music is really something for the
ﬁrst ten minutes; after that you may be
forgiven if you turn the sound down. The
graphics are good, with a few animated
sprites thrown in for good measure. There
is no way to turn the graphics off to speed
up the response time but the scenes are
drawn quickly, leaving a six line window
below them, within which scroll all text
responses. Sometimes more than six lines
of text are scrolled through fairly quickly
so you have to keep your eyes skinned.
Complex sentences are recognised
but only a few shortened forms of words
are acceptable: EX for EXAMINE is nice
but DRAWBRIDG is not understood, you
must use the full word DRAWBRIDGE!
This sort of input is soon mastered but is
frustrating to start with.
Castle of Terror is rather reminiscent
of some of the Scott Adams games, with
several devious twists and the feeling of
puzzles within puzzles. It isn't a game I
would recommend to the novice but
certainly one for the dedicated puzzle
solvers with time on their hands. Loading
time is less than four and a half minutes
(even if the instructions say less than
three!). Beware typing QUIT, it means just
that -  once invoked there is no turning
back - try RESTART instead.
Not surprisingly, you may SAVE GAME
recording your present position in the
game, to return to later (SAVE by itself gets
a "don't understand" message). This
rather important function is  not
mentioned in the instructions and only
becomes apparent when inspecting the
vocabulary with the VOCAB command.
Castle Dracula by Ducksoft has no
graphics or music but, as regular readers
will be aware, I have always felt that,
unless these materially add to the game, I
would rather have the speed of response
and let my imagination loose on longer
descriptions.
A fast loader is employed and loading
time is about four and a quarter minutes.
Response time to input commands is fast
and text is scrolled until the next location
description is called for. Colours are used
very sensibly and the display is easy to
read.
Location descriptions are not very
long but there are about 100 of them so be
prepared for fairly long sessions! There
are a number of humorous responses
that add to the fun.

commands are scanned so the impatient
are well catered for. Complex sentences
are not understood, which at least means
you know exactly where you stand, as a
simple VERB/NOUN entry is less likely to
be misinterpreted. Movement is only in
the cardinal directions and single key
entry is accepted.
Instructions are minimal -  just those
on the back of the box, so although you
know y our purpose (kill the Count)
anything extra you must sort out for
yourself! You may SAVE GAME (pretty
quickly too ...) to continue later - you'll
need to
General impressions are that Castle
Dracula is a well planned game in a fairly
classic style, a  little t h in  o n  t h e

interpreter that cannot even disregard
THE (GET THE BALI -  is not understood,
you must revert to GET BALL). It is a good
game to play but I doubt if it will have the
holding power of some other games on
the market.
The worst yet?
I recently got a copy of a game that has
been out for some time -  The Quest of
Merraski (Martech Games); it must rate as
one of the worst I've come across! BUT it
has a strange fascination i t  is not an
expensive game and has the makings of a
good beginner's adventure!
The Quest was written before the days
of fast loaders and takes just over severti
minutes to load. I  believe it was ﬁrst
produced for the VIC-20 (plus the 16k
extension pack) and so some of the
limitations impos ed b y  m e m o r y
considerations mus t b e  tak en in t o
consideration m i n d  you, does anyone
remember "Cracks o f  D o o m "  b y
Supersoft for the 16k(?) PET - thal was a
16k cracker!
This tape has versions for the CEIM 64
and the VIC-20 lone on each side) s o  at
last we can mention the other major
Commodore mac hine i n  Sense o f
Adventure! Keep looking you Plus 4 and
C-16 users, we may yet have something
for you!
The Quest is text only and the choice
of colours is not so well thought out as
Castle Dracula above. Some text in light
red on light blue is not guaranteed to
achieve good results on anything but a
monitor but it is still readable.
The display layout obviously has
strong leanings to the size of the VIC
screen with some words joined together
where previously they were the last and
ﬁrst words on consecutive VIC lines!
The n o w  ac c epted s ingle k e y
mov ement c o m m a n d s  a r e  n o t
recognised. The format GO N  or GO
NORTH must be used to travel around.
Also, surprisingly, you have to enter the
complete word for it to be actioned
BUC, BU C K, BUCKE w i l l  n o t  b e
understood but BUCKET will.
h also has a naughty habit of answering
a command concerning an object that is
not at that location t r y  typing GET
PLANT anywhere and you get "It won't
come out of the ground"!
There are some classic anomalies
visit the busy tavern and hang around
drinking - all the people "drift away"
press LOOK and miraculously all is as it
was -  the original location message
appears and the tavern is busy again.
There are other howlers too K I C K
THE PLANT and ﬁnd that "It's snapped off
at the roots", try to GET PLANT and "It
won't come out of the ground"! There is
also the beauty where "You are in a
dungeon; you can see nothing i t  is too
dark AND A KEY"! Try to OPEN ALE and
be told "You haven't got a key".
It has a few slightly more annoying
faults such as clearing the screen before
answering your commands -  this means
you have to LOOK if you have forgotten
the visible exits (it is quicker to type
GO. , .) and it has no SAVE GAME facility,
in fact it appears to have no QUIT either -
deﬁnitely a case of 'do or die'!
It is really a little unfair to go on, isn't
it? For all its shortcomings The Quest of
Merravid is the sort of adventure one
could well cut one's teeth on. Let's face it,
you should not be attacking the plant,
except when it is there anyway.
Ignore the anomalies and the game
will teach the newcomer some of the arts
of adventure gaming. Adventure games
are becoming more and more involved so
there is always a place for the more basic
training ground.
A
Velnor's Lair  is  another game fr om
yesteryear (seen ages  a g o  o n  t h e
Spectrum), based loosely on a Dungeons
and Dragons type of game. It has been re-
issued for the CBM 64 by Atlantis Software
- a t  t h e  remarkable price, f o r  a n
adventure game, of 12.99.
It is  text only and apart from the
normal puzzles, mazes a n d  general
misrepresentation that one expects from
an adventure game -  'Velnor' offers the
player, choice of character type and a
passable, i f  rather random, combat
routine.
As this game is produced down to a
low price, it does not have a fast loader, so
you must wait about thirteen minutes for
it to load -  just time to make a cup of
coffee and put out the cat. You must ﬁrst
choose your character class.
You have three choices: Warrior,
Wizard or Priest. This determines how
your character will tackle the nasties met
along the way - it is not possible to avoid
them entirely.
Response is fairly fast and certain
abbreviations are accepted but it is not
always eas y  t o  d e t e r min e  t h e m
beforehand! So a certain amount of care
must be exercised in this direction.
There is a SAVE GAME facility which
you may well need! Sadly, I could not ﬁnd
a QUIT routine a t  one point this was a
little frustrating as I got myself locked in a
room without the key; the only way out
was to switch off and re-load the game.
I expected something like that to
happen when I moved that darn stake but
I didn't think the outcome would be quite
so ﬁnal (we can't all be perfect all of the
time!)
At this sort of price it has got to be
good value - you certainly will not solve it
in an evening. Once having done so you
may well want to try again as a different
character type.

Discover the art of creating
great graphics with some help
from Allen Webb.
MANY C64 OWNERS WHO  USE BASIC
only w i l l ,  sometimes, g e t frustrated
with the limitations of the language. This
is particularly true of younger users who
wish to emulate the authors of arcade
games. Short of learning assembler or a
fast language such as FORTH, there is little
that can be done to ease matters. The idea
behind this short series is to provide a
suite o f 'ready to  use' machine code
routines which BASIC users can call to
ach ieve some useful graphical effects. The
routines have two useful attributes:
1) They perform complex actions in a fast
and efﬁcient manner
2) They help ﬁll the holes left by the weak
BASIC.
Rather than re-invent the  wheel, I
have endeavoured to  cover ne w and
interesting areas of graphics. As far as
possible I will make all of the routines
compatible. But, inevitably some zero.
page locations will be common to more
than one routine. This should not provide
any problems. The spare area between
SC000 and SCFFF will be used so that you
don't loose any RAM.
On with the show
In this ﬁrst part I want to deal with user
deﬁned graphics from a slightly different
angle. I n  Commodore computers, the
character data is held in a ROM. Each
character comprises an array of 64 dots
and this can be stored as eight numbers.
Each number deﬁnes the pattern of dots
in each r ow  o f  characters. Hence, i f
you can change these values, you can
redeﬁne your characters. Easy eh? The
video chip in the 64 has a handy little
pointer which can b e  pointed a t any
character set you want. Additionally, by
cunning manipulation o f the character
table, you can perform clever tricks such
as scrolling.
The loader in Listing 1 gives a block of
nine routines for the manipulation o f
characters. Their functions are given in
Figure 1.

The ﬁr s t c ommand s ets  u p  a
redeﬁnable character set at a speciﬁed
address. This address can be any of the
permitted locations allowing the use of
any of the banks. Figure 2 shows how to
set up a character set at $C800. Lines 10
and 20 change the bank and line 30 moves
the screen to $C400.

The remaining commands alter the
speciﬁed character, with t h e  second
command redeﬁning any character and
the eight parameters specifying each of
the eight lines of the character.
The functions o f  th e  next four
commands are self-explanatory. Listing 2
shows how a number of effects can be
achieved by  the selective scrolling of
speciﬁed characters. The behaviour of
multicolour characters when scrolled is
particularly interesting.
The invert and 'back-to-forward'
commands are handy because they let
you use a  single design for  several
characters. This is  very useful if, for
example, you want t o  have a  ﬁgure
moving back and forth across the screen.
Next month I want to tackle a slightly
more obscure area. Most arcade games
use c olour ful effec ts  t o  por tr ay
explosions or blend from one screen to
another. I will give some simple routines
which can be  used t o give some
interesting effects to your games.

OUT OF THE MAILBOX THIS MONTH
comes a letter from Chris Rogers of Rhyl.
He wrote to me about Acitivision's
Ghostbusters, saying, "My own personal
hi-score is f 239,800 -  acc. no. 30067010
(CHRIS). I  want to try and reach the
$1,000,000 mark on Ghostbusters i f
the program will accept such a score!"
Well, Chris, when I spoke to David Crane
at the LET '85 show, he said he had an
account number to get $999,999. Whether
this was the highest you can get, I don't
know, but I'll ﬁnd out! By the way, David
wouldn't tell me what the account
number was. Blast!
So, Chris has achieved this month's hi-
score for Ghostbusters, second place
going to David Edwards of Carlisle with a
marvellous $176,600 ("DAVID" acc. no.
46117405): the gauntlet has been thrown
down - any takers to just beat this or reach
the fabled million? Let's hear from you,
pixel-pickers!
David Edwards has this to say about
Epyx's tab Impossible Mission: "It took
me ﬁve days, on/off playing, to ﬁnish it.
It's quite good at the end. The puzzles
don't change, you come across new ones,
and they repeat! I think I've found about
20 different puzzles". Thanks for the
warning, David. By the way, you didn't tell
me what your hi-score was, so the only
one I have for Impossible Mission so far is
25101 (password -  ASPARAGUS) from
Dawn Rogers of Rhyl (Wife of Chris!).
Nice one, Dawn; all those somersaults
must have made you quite dizzy!
Cold sweat
Wargaminip for rim Commodore 04
By the way, David, Choplifter predates
Rain on Bungleing Bay by about a year
and a bit, and Lode Runner is nothing to
do with it either.
Several people have written to me
asking if I can suggest new games with
good speech and graphics. Well,
Impossible Mission is about as good as
you'll get, at the moment, speechwise. As
for graphics, CAD/CAM Warrior
(Taskset), Indiana Jones in the Lost
Kingdom (Mindscape), the excellent Staff
of Karnath (Ultimate) and, out soon, The
Rocky Horror Show (CRL). This last has
the best music on any game I've seen. The
game ain't bad either!
I really scared myself the other day. A
copy of  Theatre Europe, P55's new
wargame/simulation of World War III,
dropped through my door. I booted it up,
and started to play. I soon got bored with
having to think about troop movements,
and battling it out on foot, so (being a
shoot 'em up nut) I started throwing my
nukes around. Memories of  Missile
Command made me expect little blippy
explosions and a nice safe little message
"game over"... I didn't realise this was a
simulation. I activated all the missiles in
the Nato armoury..!
The screen showed a thousand tiny
lights moving slowly across the screen,
Feed the world
while a thousand tiny lights moved from
the Iron Curtain countries over to my
side. The silence and the suspense made
my mouth go dry
Then the map disappeared suddenely,
and I was transported a  picture of a
grey city skyline, the silence was fractured
by the wall of the air-raid sirens, over and
over again. Then a tiny streak of light in
the sky, followed by a ﬂash of white
brilliance, the rumble of blast, and the
stomach churning sight of a mushroom
cloud. Over and over again it happened as
all the major cities of the world were
razed to the ground. I turned off the
computer and sat for a moment in silence.
War is not funny. (See our fully ﬂedged
review next month).
Donald quacks a rib
Donald Duck, on the other hand, is funny,
and always will be. His new arcade game
sees him trying to build a playground for
Huey, Dewey and Lewey to play in. He
does this by earning money working at
the airport, the fruit farm, and the toy
shop.
The graphics o n  this game are
delightful, truly cartoon quality, and the
sound, especially Donald's voice, are ﬁrst
class.
A further stroke against hunger in the
Third World, Soft Aid, the software Band
Aid tape, is in your shops. A note from
Bob Geldol on the inlay card says "Don't
copy this tape, Go out and Buy It!!" I insist
that you all do just that and, as for anyone
who copies this mega-compilation rather
than spend a paltry ﬁve quid to save
somebody's life w e l l ,  I hope your
conscience can take it!
Right, that's all we have space for,
arcade buffs. Keep those letters, queries
and hi-scores piling in, and I'll see you
next month. This is Flippo, signing off.
Spooks, nukes, rebukes and
Ethiopia are just some of the
reasons why Flippo has
ﬂipped over this month's
selection of Arcade goodies.

A.P. and D.1.
Stephenson explore
the mathematical
capabilities of
programming in
BASIC.
PART 10
THE BASIC LANGLIAGETAMES
mathematics. Highly complex
equations can be programmed
with ease and tested with real
ﬁgures without the customary
arithmetic dr udger y . T h e
mathematical commands o n
the Commodore machines are
powerful a n d  c apable o f
handling complex equations
but it is easy to fall into traps
caused b y  s uc h gems  a s
division-by-zero, unreal roots
and unexpected r ounding
errors.
Translating text book
equations
A text book equation can rarely
be directly implemented i n
BASIC. F or  example, Y=Ab
written i n  BASIC mus t b e
written as NI=A
is no provision in BASIC for
positioning a variable 'up in
the air '. Multiplic ation is
indicated by '
V=AB mus t b e  changed t o
V=A*B else the computer will
think that AB is the name of a
single variable and an awkward
bug will be created.
Arguments within functions
must be enclosed in brackets,
even though they  may  b e
optional i n  t h e  tex t book
version. For example, a mathe-
matician would write cos X or
sin X but we must translate
these to COS(X) and SIN(X). In
BASIC, a function is a special
keyword, characterised by the
enclosure of brackets around
the variable. It is used to supply
the language with a few of the
commonly used mathematical
operations other than addition,
subtraction, multiplication and
division s uc h a s  COS(X),
TAN(X), ABS(X), etc.
Degrees and radians
The circumference of a circle is
div ided i n t o  3 6 0  par ts .
However, BASIC trigonome-
trical functions expect angles
to b e  measured in  radians.
Thus, SIN(45) is asking for the
sine of 45 radians. If you prefer
to work in degrees, you can use
the it k ey  f o r  c onv erting
radians i n t o  degrees. F or
example:
The trig functions SIN(Xtn /2),
COS (X* rr/2) and TAN(X* IT /2)
will work i f  X is entered in
degrees.
Logarithmic functions
Some BASIC dialects offer two
log functions, one to base 10
(common logs) and the other
to base e (naperian or natural
logs) b u t  Commodore 6 4
BASIC only offers the latter.
LOG(X) returns the log to
base e. The number e can never
be expressed exactly, however
many digits  ar e used, b u t
2.71828 is accurate to 5 digits. It
is a strange number which can
be calculated to any order of
accuracy by use of the series:
e 1  + 1/11 +1/21 +1/31+1/4 +
etc. etc.
The more places you take in the
calculation, the nearer you will
get to the true value. But don't
go too far. If you calculate the
FIA•C•TEIS
series to, say, 20 terms the
number of digits would soon
exceed t h e  c a lc u la t in g
precision of the machine and
any further additions would be
meaningless numbers.
The exponential
function
EXP(X) returns a value, e where
e is  again 2.71828 etc. The
function crops up in such areas
as radio active decay, swinging
pendulums and population
statistics. T his  i s  als o a n
important member of a group
known as hyperbolic functions.
Inverse trig functions
ATN(X) is the only inverse trig
function direc tly  available
since i t  i s  t h e  o n e  mos t
commonly needed in practice.
But, the range can be extended
by u s in g  s o m e  s tandard
conversion formulae. We have
arranged t h e  for mulae as
deﬁned functions so they can
be entered directly:
DEF FNAS(X)=ATN(X/SQR
( - X
than 1)
DEF FNAC (X)=-ATN(X/SQR
( - X
less than 1)
We have named the functions
AS and AC respectively.
Hyperbolic functions
Normal trig functions are based
on t h e  c irc le. Hy perbolic
functions are similar but are
based on the curves known as
hyperbola.
They a r e  n o t  dir ec tly
available but can be obtained
from standard conversion
formulae. They are set out
below in deﬁned function form
and are true for all values of X:
Hyperbolic sine:
DEF FtsISH(X)=(EXP(X)-EXP
(-X))/2
Hyperbolic cosine:
DEF FNCH(X)=(EXP(X)+(EXP
(-X)))/2
Hyperbolic tangent:
DEF FNTH(X)=-EXP(-X)/(EXP
(—X)*2+1
We have named the functions
SH, CH and TH respectively.
Use of brackets
When writing down algebraic
expressions, we can rely on
operator precedence, as the
following:
A r a i s i n g  to powers
negative quantity
multiply
divide
addition
subtraction
Examples:
5+6*5=35
3+3A2/6+4=6
4- 18/3
However, to avoid errors, it is
safer to use brackets liberally
than t o  rely too heavily on
operator precedence.

P r o g r a m m i n g
Handling simple
equations
Subroutines or deﬁned
functions?
In gener al, t h e  deﬁned
function is  tidier and more
economical t h a n  w r it in g
equations i n  t h e  f o r m o f
separate subroutines. In fact,
the deﬁned function is tailor-
made for the job, offering local
protection f o r  par ameter
variables. One reminder -  the
function must be deﬁned with
DEF EN before it is called with
FN. Since the deﬁnition need
only b e  ex ec uted o n c e ,
however many times it is called,
it is best treated as an initialisa-
tion task and placed near the
top of the program.
The majority of equations in
technical books present little
difﬁculty. As a simple example,
we shall take a  well-known
equation fr om t h e  ﬁeld o f
electronics to illustrate some of
the pitfalls. The formula, as it
would appear in text books,
gives the frequency of a series
of resonant electrical circuits (if
you haven't a clue what this is,
do not fret - it serves merely as
an example):
1
f = 
-
Any equation, not just this one,
should be examined to see if
there are certain values of the
variable which could cause a
crash. We begin by re-writing it
in a form acceptable to BASIC:
FR=1/(2*P1*(SQR(L*C)))
This will work OK but, if the
equation is to be set into a loop
which repeats many times, the
term in the denominator, 2*PI,
is best performed before the
loop is entered. If we write, say,
C=2*P1 s omew her e, t h e
equation can now be written:
IR=1/(k*SQR(IsC))
We may then decide to put it
into deﬁned function form:
DEF FNRE(L,C)=1/(k*SQR(PC))
The name of the function is RE
and the formal parameters are
L and C. Later,we might call the
function with, say:
FR=FNRE(L112)
where Ll and 12 are the actual
parameters. We could also pass
over direct constants:
FR=FNRE(2E-1,2E-3)
If FR was printed to 4 decimal
places, we should get 7.957747.
Watc h o u t  f o r  t h e
following:
L or C or both can be zero in
the denominator because the
square root of zero is a real
number b u t  t h e  mac hine
would still output the error
message "DIVISION BY ZERO"
because 1/zero is inﬁnity.
If one of them is negative, the
result is  unreal and would
trigger the message "ILLEGAL
QUANTITY".
But, if both are negative and
non zero, the product of L and
C remains real and acceptable
by the machine.
Scaling problems
The S I  s y s t e m ( Sy s tem
International) has been used in
tec hnic al c o l l e g e s  a n d
universities f o r  many years.
Whatever system is used, there
will always be some units which
are too large or too small for
prac tic al m e a s u r e m e n t .
Electronics a b o u n d  w i t h
staggeringly large and small
units. For example, the SI unit
called t h e  F ar ad i s  s o
ginormpus t h a t  t h e  t o t a l
capacitance of the planet earth,
treated as a perfect conducting
sphere, is only one quarter of a
Farad! In practical electronics,
even t h e  microfarad ( one
millionth o f  a  Farad) is  a
relatively la r g e  u n i t  a n d
capacitances o f  a  n e w
picofarads ( o n e  m i l l i o n
millionth of a Farad) are not at
all unusual.
Values lik e these present
difﬁculties w hen try ing t o
writer user friendly programs.
For example, it would be more
practical to input the value of
capacitance i n  t e r m s  o f
microfarads than in Farads. But,
you can get into a right old
mess by re-writing equations
using multiples or submultiples
of the unit. The safest way is to
convert a ll values received
from user-friendly keyboard
input i m m e d i a t e l y  i n t o
standard SI units, leaving them
in t h i s  f o r m  u n t i l  a l l
calculations are ﬁnished. For
example, our previous formula
for series resonant frequency is
only true, as it stands, if I is in
Henries (SI unit of inductance)
and C is in Farads. A suitable
request f o r  keyboard input
might be:
100 INPUT"ENTER INDUC-
TANCE IN MILLIHENRIES "11
110 INPUT"ENTER CAPACI-
TANCE IN MICROFARADS":
Cl
120 L1=L1*1E:C1=C1*1E-6
Line 120 converts millihenries
to Henries and microfarads to
Farads, r e a d y  f o r  d ir e c t
implementation i n t o  t h e
standard equation. Although
we have recommended that
units should remain in pure SI
form throughout the length of
the program, when the time
comes to print out results, the
units can be converted back
again t o  m o r e  pr ac tic al
values. Thus, if the result of our
equation for fr was 45000 Hz,
we might like to print out in the
KHz (1000 Hz) so we could
write:
SOO FE=FE/1000
510 PRINT"THE RESONANT
FREQUENCY IS ";FR" KHZ"
If you follow these guidelines,
you reduce the chance of a
calculation bein'g a million, or
hundred of millions, out.
Quadratic equations
Many readers might be familiar
with the following solution for
the two answers (roots):
If ax + bx + C = 0, then
4ac
x -  2 a
The presence of  the square
root in  the equation implies
that some values of the co-
efﬁcients a,b and c can yield
unreal s olutions  bec aus e
mathematicians have decreed
that t h e  square r oot o f  a
negative number cannot exist.
The c ondition f o r  unr eal
solutions is when 4ac is greater
than b. The expression within
the square root is often known
as the discriminant because it
'discriminates' between r eal
and unreal solutions. When
writing equations  w h i c h
involve t h e  s o lu t io n  o f
quadratics.. it is wise to evaluate
the discriminant part of  the
equation immediately because,
if the result is negative, there is
little p o in t  i n  proc eeding
further.
But, unreal roots do occupy
an important position in the
theory of alternating currents
in general and the behaviour of
oscillatory circuits in particular.
The 90 degree operator j allows
the two unreal solutions of a
quadratic to be expressed in
the form:
R+iX and R-jX
Any quantities preﬁxed by j are
the unreal parts of the solution.
Solutions w hic h c ontain a
combination of real and unreal
terms are known as complex
solutions. In order to get the
computer to accept complex
solutions, you must test the
discrimation as  before but,
instead of rejection, convert it
to the absolute value using the
command ABS. In other words,
change it to positive which is
equivalent t o  reversing t he
terms within the discriminant.
To c ompens ate f o r  t h i s
trickery, the operator j must
serve as a label indicating that
such a trickery has been carried
Out. The equation needs to be
slightly re-arranged so that the
real a n d  unreal terms ar e
separated: 
-

Polar and cartesian
coordinates
A point i n  two-dimensional
space c an b e  expressed i n
terms of polar coordinates or
Cartes ian c o o r d i n a t e s .
Instructions to travel 10 miles
on a bearing of 45 degrees, are
in terms of polar coordinates.
Instructions t o walk along a
certain street for  100 yards,
then take the ﬁrst street On the
right and walk a  further SO
yards are given in  terms of
Cartesian c oor dinates . A
moment's reﬂection on these
deﬁnitions s hould convince
you that polar coordinates are

P r o g r a m m i n g
sensible in an aircraft or in the
middle of the desert but, in a
typical c ity , t h e  destination
could only  b e  reached b y
walking through the walls of
buildings.
Polar coordinates measure
the distance of a line from a
ﬁxed reference point and the
angle of  the line to a ﬁxed
reference line. The distance
(length of the line) is called the
modulus and the angle is called
the argument. Polar  f o r m
coordinates can be expressed
in the form Z  (the modulus)
and 0 (the argument).
Rectangular coordinates
deﬁne a point in terms of its X
and Y coordinates. Figure 10.1
shows both forms.
Convertin cartesian to polar:
Z = X  +  Y• : 0 = ATN(Y/X)
Example: If X=3 and Y=4, then
Z=5 and 0 =53.13 degrees.

Statistics
Statistics s upply  u s  w i t h
ﬁgures, deriv ed f r o m w e ll
proven probability laws but
leaves us10 interpret them in a
common sense manner. It is
incorrect interpretation, often
quite deliberate, which tends
to slur the image of statistics
but renders them a boon to
politicians and advertisers.
If you present statisticians
with a  sample o f  seemingly
random ﬁgures., they will come
up with some predictions but
issued w i t h  c aution. F o r
example, the sample may be
too s m a l l  f o r  r e l i a b l e
predictions t o  b e  made.
Statistics is  a ll t o  d o  w ith
samples. The larger the sample,
the higher  t h e  conﬁdence
factor that the sample results
can be extended to the total
p o p u la t io n .  ( T h e  t e r m
population refers to the total
number  o f  i t e m s ,  n o t
necessarily people.)
Collecting the data
Data, as  far  as  statistics is
concerned is a set of numbers.
X COORDINATE
What the numbers stand for is
not always of importance to
statistics. The set of numbers
could b e shoe sizes or  the
distance between the navel
and armpit o f  a  sample o f
people. The collection of data
is normally a ﬁeld exercise, the
end result being sheets o f
paper. The ﬁgures on the paper
will be entered into a computer
and one o r  more statistical
formula brought t o bear on
them. I t  i s  a  c o m m o n
requirement to ﬁnd the mean
value a n d  t h e  s tandar d
deviation of a set of ﬁgures. To
ﬁnd the mean value, just add
up the numbers and divide by
how many numbers there are
in t h e  lis t. T h e  standard
deviation is another matter and
demands mor e explanation
than we have space for. The
formula is usually expressed in
the following form:
Standard deviation = ( R
where X = value of item
X = mean value
ZN = numberof items
= the algebraic sum of
Factorials
10.
AXIS
Polar coordinates (Modulus and 0) and Cartesian coordinates (X and II coordinates)
We include it because, of all
the s tatis tic al oper ations
available, it is the most useful
and probably the most well
known.
The factorial o f  integer X,
written X!, is the product of all
integers fr om 1  t o  X.  For
example, 41=4)(3)(2)0=24.
Factorials have a nasty habit of
bursting to astronomical values
with even moderate values of
X. For example, 10! evaluates to
3,628,800 so one problem to
watch out for is overﬂow. The
overﬂow is nearly reached with
301 b e c a u s e  i t  h a s  a n
approximate value, 2.6E32. A
strange feature o f  factorials,
representing another possible
hazard, is that 0! and 1! both =
1. Factorials feature promi-
nantly in the laws of probability
and c ombinations  w h ic h
conjures up association with
football pools. Next month's
article will be concerned with
putting statistics to work on the
computer.

Get on board for our high-
ﬂying July competition.
DA, DA, DA, DA, DA-DA, DA, DA...NO,
your ears aren't deceiving you, these are
the ﬁrst few notes of the nattiest ﬂying
tune of all time - the Dambusters Theme
Music - a very noble lead-in to Jump Jet,
Anirog's follow - up t o  t heir  ultr a-
successful, Flight Path 737.
Jump let for the Commodore 64 isdue
for release at the end of May. It will retail
for £9.95 on cassette and f11.95 on disc.
Forty lucky prize-winners will be able to
simulate mayhem in the living room if
they're ﬁrst out of the bag with the correct
answers to our competition. And, one
even-luckier-than-lucky prize winner will
not only win a copy of lumpiet but will be
able to scribble to their heart's content
with a  copy of Anirog's Super Sketch
(valued at f 49.95 - see last month's issue
for our ace review). More of how to
become such a lucky person, later on.
Jump Jet is  a  combat and ﬂight
simulator, written by Vaughan Dow who,
for many years, was a Jump Jet pilot. It
starts by leaving you all at sea as you take
off from the landing deck of a carrier.
Using a variety of instruments on your
dash board arid your radar screen, you
can locate the enemy aircraft. Then it's
decision time - should you throw caution
to the wind and pursue the enemy or
make yourself a  laughing stock b y
returning to the carrier with your tail
between y our legs. But, even i f  you
successfully attack a n d  destroy t h e
enemy, there is only enough fuel for
one journey so you must return to base
after each mission.
This is Jump Jet in a nutshell. The skill
levels reﬂect the ranks in the RAF - Flight
Lieutenant, Squadron Leader, Win g
Commander, G r oup Captain. O n e
deﬁnite plus is the use of sound to relay
messages -  for example, 'Ready for take-
off' 'Enemy contact' o r  'Low fuel' -
especially handy for those who can't read.
For those who missed Out on last
month's issue (back issues available from
this ofﬁce - ed.) Super Sketch is a drawing
tablet accompanied by some excellent
software and, in our reviewer's opinion, is
'excellent value and great fun'. It retails
for £49.95 on cassette and f51,95 on disc.
Study the pics of  our  very own Air-
Commodore ( f o r  t h e  uninfor med
amongst you, that's the rank above group
captain in the air force). Now, even if you
are not bright enough to realise that the
word Commodore refers t o  anything
other than a computer or a Lionel Richie
clone, you can't fail to notice that there
are several differences between our two
pictures. But how many? You tell us. Just
circle the differences on the picture on
the entry coupon and jo t  down the
011101
amount. T h e  number o f  differences
should also be written on the back of the
envelope in which you send your entry
otherwise we will not be able to accept it.
You may enter as many times as you
wish but each entry must be on an ofﬁcial
coupon and sealed in a separate envelope
Please write clearly on the coupon as it
will be used as a label if you win a prize.
Fill in your answers, name and address
on the entry coupon and send it to Anirog
Competition, Yo u r  Commodore. 1
Golden Square, London W1R 3A8. The
closing date for the competition is 31st
July.

1 am having great difﬁculty in obtaining a
printer for my  Commodore system.
already have the 4207 Tractor printer but
wish to obtain a printer of 'letter-quality'
output. It would also be nice if it could
take both continuous and separate sheet
stationery. The present system comprises
a Commodore 8032 micro, 8050 dual disc
drive and 4022 Tractor printer (dot
matrix).
I would be grateful if you could advise
me on the type of printer to use (other
than Commodore) and any interfacing
required.
A. K. Moyce
Southampton
OUTPUT
suggest you use a printer interface such
as the Panda variety marketed by Pact
International. This done, if you really want
letter-quality you will need a daisy wheel
or printer, but these are expensive. You
could try either the Star SG-15 or the SG-
10. Also, take a peek at our Business
Bonanza.
I bought my 64 to help pass the time
during my retirement and I now have a
collection of software on cassettes. I am
also attending evening classes in BASIC
programming. I have recently acquired a
1541 disc drive and would like to transfer
all my software onto disc to obviate the
delay in loading the programs.
Can you recommend any commercial
software which would enable me to do
this?
SoMe time ago, I plugged in a games
cartridge whilst the 64 was switched on.
The cartridge is  n o w  c orrupt a n d
unusable. Is it also possible to have a
back-up copy o f  a cartridge program
transferred to disc so I don't make such an
expensive mistake again? C a n  t h e
cartridge be re-programmed.
B. Muncaster
Eastleigh
OUTPUT
Yes, it is possible to transfer software from
cassette to disc but, unfortunately, some
naughty people use this process for piracy
and, therefore, I  cannot disclose any
details. The transference of cartridge soft-
ware is also possible but, for the same
reasons, I cannot give you any further
information.

How do I save to disc a program whichis 18
parts long with each part of the program
having the same line numbers and with
the last line of the previous part loading
the next part, I have tried several ways of
doing this such as using 18 different tracks
but nothing seems to work.
John B. Tomlinson
London
Change each load statement to LOAD
"xxx",8 (ie, LOAD "Part 2" at the end of
Part 1) and.. .hey presto, your prayers are
answered!
I have a Commodore 64 and wish to key in
programs. Unfortunately , a  l o t  o f
programs have single RETURN statements
on a line and I ﬁnd that my computer
keeps throwing u p  t he syntax error
RETURN WITHOUT GOSUI3.
Can you please tell me how to correct
these programs.
R. Hills
Folkstone
There is some confusion here. There is no
error in placing a single RETURN on a line.
The error message means that a line
containing a GOSUB has been omitted
earlier on.
In response t o  Mar k  Jones' letter
(Input/Output, May -  'sluggish 7541'),
anyone using a 1541 disc drive can now
load most software four times faster using
Trigsoft's CT LOADER CARTRIDGE. I t
costs 00. 00 inc . p & p  a n d  features
abbreviated load and save commands, the
ability to display the disc drive directory
on the screen without erasing programs in
memory, an on/off switch so there's no
need to unplug it in case of a conﬂict and a
reset switch.

Anyone who agrees that the 1541 induces
comatose may contact Trigsoft at:

I have been asked by a friend to take a
Commodore disc drive and software hack
with me to New Zealand. lam concerned
that British hardware and software may
nor work with Commodore machines
over there. Although the power supply is
the same, I know that TV sets use different
frequencies and so British computers
cannot be hooked up to a New Zealand
television set as a monitor. Can you tell
me whether the same is true of disc drives
and software.
Lyall E
London
OUTPUT
If the power supplies are the same then
you are OK with the disc drive. As far as
software is concerned, most o f  ours
comes from the States, so there should be
no problem.

swinging from the jib of a crane, and you

where you are set against the clock, and
these are really challenging! You are paid

open up as doors are opened,
stairs are ascended and so on.
Detailed descriptions can be
called up at any time with the
LOOK command and all the
exploration is accompanied by
a repertoire of well produced
sleazy music.
Verbal commands are listed
in the cassette inlay and while
this removes a lot of the fun of
ﬁnding t h e right thing t o
say this is more than made up
for by the variety of movement
options a n d  t h e  limited
interaction with t h e other
characters i n  t h e  h o t el.
Seasoned adventurers might
ﬁnd t h e game less o f  a
challenge than they are used to
since a  good deal o f  t he
memory is occupied by the
graphics but as a game that
offers something a bit different
coupled with its own sense of
humour it still presents a good
package.
The game has excellent 3D graphics with
very smooth an imat io n , a n d  i s
accompanied by a good rock soundtrack.
If you like slaughtering everything in
sight this game is not for you. If, however,
you are intrigued by the idea of a sort of
computerised Meccano, then it is quite
exceptional and not to be missed!

Softaid comes in the usual cassette
box with a larger than average inlay card

is not nearly enough information, but
then again there are ten games to cover

At the start of each side Band Aid have

little dismayed to ﬁnd that three titles
would not load. Even after many attempts
I still haven't seen Gumshoe, but one
failure can almost be overlooked. Of the
other nine there are 4 arcade shoot-em-
ups, 2 mazy types, 2 platform/level games
and 1 semi-adventure called Star Trader.
None of the titles are particularly new
but all are good solid games, no rubbish,
and i f  bought separately each could
command an £8.00 price tag and you
wouldn't feel cheated. My personal fav-

This is the ideal game for people with
aggressive tendencies, because your task
is quite simply to shoot everything in

one-sided, -  the aliens you are ﬁghting

averse to such dirty tricks as creeping up
on you from behind or homing in on the

reasonable. The game really loses out,
however, by having no joystick option.

control your craft, so after a while your

grateful, she threw it from the window in a

The game starts with jack leaping from
branch to branch to climb the beanstalk,
after which he hops through the clouds
and enters the giant's castle. It all sounds
very simple, but the beanstalk, the clouds
and the castle are infested with weird
creatures, whose touch is invariably fatal.
These come in many guises, including
manic ducks, k iller  jelly-babies and
demon Hoovers, and these are not easy to
avoid. Once in the castle there are 23
rooms to explore, with the eventual aim
of ﬁnding treasures: a golden egg, a harp
and a bag of gold.
Basically this is a platform game, but
it scores for its size and sheet quality! On

the sound effects are good.
A very interesting, challenging game -

Graphically this game is superb! You

complete with ﬂuttering ﬂags and a crowd
of spectators. A large screen at the back
gives information and a close-up of the
action. All control is by joystick, with the
joystick serving a variety of functions at

logical once you get the hang of it. All the

even down to a troupe of cheerleaders
who appear between innings!
I found the game excellent for two

playing against t h e  computer leads
inevitably to humiliating defeat! There
are other criticisms too - the ball is very
difﬁcult t o  hit, and t he ﬁelder w ho

COMMODORE'S LONG-ESTABLISHED
reputation f o r  p r o d u c i n g  p o o r
documentation lives on, long after the
quality has been substantially improved.
Thus, many books have been produced
with the advent of new machines. The C16
and Plus/4 offer two major advantages to
the publisher and author. Firstly the
operating systems are identical on the two
machines, except for memory size and, in
the case o f  t he Plus/4, the built-in
software. Secondly, there is a potentially
large market, on the one hand for the
absolute beginner, and o n  the other
hand, for the businessman or business-
woman who wishes t o start t o  make
effective use of the machine.
The author has totally ignored the
Plus/4's built in software, which is an
amazing omission, even f o r  a  book
containing only 161 pages.
Noting that t h e  author is  highly  -
knowledgable a b o u t  t h e  D r agon
computer, w e  become curious as t o
whether he knows as much as he should
about C o m m o d o r e  m a c h i n e s .
Regrettably it appears not.
For a start, I am not impressed with an
approach which includes READ, DATA,
and RESTORE commands under  t he
heading 'More Advanced Programming'.
They are amongst the easiest commands
to understand, and are frequently the
group w ith which beginners become
acquainted, as  s oon a s  they  hav e
overcome the excitement of printing out
their name on the screen.
Similarly, t h e  us e o f  t h e  w or ld
'Initialise' in the context of HEADERING a
disc is likely to cause confusion amongst
Commodore users. To such users this
expression has always meant reading the
Directory and Block Allocation Map into
the RAM of the disc drive. To have the
meaning suddenly changed to cover the
destruction of the contents of the disc is
dangerous.
The resume o n  t h e  bac k  cover
suggests that after reading the book, you
should b e  proﬁcient i n  t h e  mor e
sophisticated programming techniques
such as disc ﬁle handling. This overstates
the case. Any disc drive likely to be used
with this  machine w ill have Relative
Record Files available for random access:
there is no mention of this in the book.
The Chapter called 'Structuring your
Programs' contains no discussion on how
to do that. It contains some information
about commands creating program
structures such as loops, but DO WHILE
and DO UNTIL are not covered, whereas
FOR NEXT is. The section in this chapter
on LOADing and SAVEing programs
belongs elsewhere.
The Machine code chapter is only a
run through the commands included in
the built in MONITOR.
The chapter on Peripherals glosses
dangerously ov er  matters o f  s ome
importance. The use of the COLLECT
command to deal with improperly closed
ﬁles is covered, but you are not told how
to identify such ﬁles (by the asterisk
appearing on the directory). Similarly, it is
suggested that the COPY and BACKUP
commands are usable if you have more
than one disc drive. This is true enough,
but o n l y  i f  thos e t w o  drives ar e
accommodated in a single disc unit. The
distinction is important, and is made clear
in Commodore's own documentation!
Flawed though it is, this book is written
in a more chatty style than Commodore's
own documentation, and is  therefore
considerably easier t o  understand.
However, you would be better advised to

Commodore 64 Basics- A self-

Author:
Ann Harris
Publishers:
Wiley Press
Price:
$15.95
IT'S ALL VERY NICE ANSWERING THE
call to join the high-tech generation and
buy a computer, but it's rather difﬁcult to
learn to program a computer well if you
have absolutely no previous experience.
Once you've learnt a  langugage, it's
almost trivial to learn a new language or
move onto a new machine. It's for these
reasons that I enjoy reading good quality
teaching books, such as this one, which
ahcieve what they claim.
In true American traditions, this book
reinforces the information given by pro-
viding occasional questions for the reader
to answer. This wasn't really my cup of tea,
but it does work.
The book sets out to teach you the use
of BASIC and give a feel for graphics,
sound and data handling. The approach
to this problem is to tackle the material
in small pieces. The preliminary section
deals with the hardware and how to
interconnect it. For owners of disc drives,
the commands are described in a simple
manner. To get you going, simple one line
programs are introduced along with how
to save and load your creations. The
philosophy is simply to help you gain
conﬁdence by using the computer. Once

IBRARY
you realise that you cannot hurt the
machine, it's surprising how easy it is to
use.
Making progress beyond this point
takes some work, so the concepts of
ﬂowsheets a n d  a lg o r it h m s  a r e
introduced. Subsequent programs in the
book use ﬂowsheets, demonstrating their
worth, and the more advanced concepts
such as  decisions and looping ar e
discussed with examples of their use and
value. The section on programming is
completed with a  listing for a simple_
database program using sequential ﬁles.
While this is probably a good idea for the
States where disc drives are common, it
isn't for the UK. This aside, it is a useful
example of how to write such a program.
The remainder o f  the book discusses
simple graphics, sprites and sound. Whilst
these subjects aren't covered in great
depth, it's a tolerable effort.
On the whole this is a detailed and
enjoyable book which teaches the subject
of programming in a simple but effective
manner.

THE CLAIM FOR THIS BOOK IS THAT IT
could be the only 64 book you'll ever
need. I doubt it this is true but as an
overview of the Commodore 64 system it
is undoubtably an excellent reference
manual.
The book  is  presented in  a  lively
manner with each chapter divided into
smaller sections, thus making it not only a
good, easy read but also a  suitable
candidate for browsing through in idle
moments.
It opens with a level-headed appraisal
of t h e  6 4  whic h, though obviously
favourable, d o e s  n o t  ig n o r e  i t s
weaknesses such as rudimentary BASIC
and non-standard RS232. This is followed
by a  potted history o f  Commodore
computers prior to the introduction of
the 64 and has an excellent section on
Commodore's tantalising projects after
the 64 up to the introduction of the Plus/4
and C-16.
At this  point t h e  book  launches
into a clear, concise description of how to
set up the machine, ﬁnding your way

appear in latter part of this section but the
explanations lose none of the crispness of
the earlier sections dealing with the
relatively easier commands.
The third major section deals with
peripherals, after an initial introduction to
ﬁling systems. Cassette recorders, disc
drives, and printers are all dealt with in a
fair amount of detail, giving a far clearer
understanding of each unit than you get
from t h e i r  in d ivid u al manuals.
Unfortunately, there is a serious omis-
sion in this section. The 1520 plotter/
printer is dealt with very sketchily and the
text misleadingly implies that the same
commands c an b e  used as  f o r  t he
Commodore dot matrix printers, simply
by using the device number 6 instead of 4.
This n o t  o n ly  underestimates t h e
capabilities o f  t h e  1520 b u t  is  also
incorrect in most cases.
The section on business applications
takes a long look at the types of software
available with sound advice on choosing
the correct package f o r your ow n
circumstances.
A brief look at the facilities of the SX-64
portable closes this section and leads on
to a miscellany of error message types,
useful memory POKEs, a glossary and
bibliography, ﬁnally  ending w it h a
summary of the available BASIC keywords
dnd a useful memory map.
The Complete Commodore 64 is
deﬁnitely a  mus t f o r  t h e  relative
newcomer to the machine but offers little
more for the experienced user and if, as
the cover claims, it could be the only 64
book you'll ever need then why bother
with a bibliography. The bibliography is
obviously a mere cursory glance at the
kind of publication available for the 64 -
after all, in the section on magazines, a
glaring omission is that most essential
magazine f o r  6 4  o w n ers:  Y o u r

Biz-whiz, Dave Crisp, casts his
beady eye over the best of
Business software and
hardware for the 64.
The Silicon word
VORD PROCESSING IS PROBABLY THE
most common serious application for the
home computer. At  some time, most
people want to prepare a well designed
and clear letter. The word processor
allows you to do this with ease. It also
enables y ou t o  amend errors before
printing the ﬁnished letter.
To see or not to see
There are t w o basic types o f  word-
processing: pre-formatted a n d  post-
formatted. A  pre-formatted w o r d
processor shows the document on the
screen as it will be printed (with a few
exceptions) w h ile ,  w it h  t h e  pos t-
formatted type, the document does not
appear as it will be printed but has certain
characters whic h indicate what w ill
happen to the text. Most post-formatted
word processors have a preview facility
which allows you to see what the letter
will really look like when printed.
Top of the form
Yizawrite, to me, is almost perfection. It
only lacks a n  8 0 column screen ( a
limitation of the 64, of course). It is easy to
use and all of the important functions
such as  w o r d  w r ap, m a il mer ge,
tabulation, decimal tab and so on are
there. All the keypresses to format and so
on are logical and easy to remember;
except f o r  m a i l  m e r g e  a n d  ﬁl e
transportation a  manual i s  almos t
unnecessary. Some of the most impressive
features are:
the facility to input a new format line at
any time throughout the document.
For example, you can insert new tab
stops if the style of the letter changes.
the delete text function, If you press
the Commodore key and delete key
and move the cursor over the text to be
deleted, the text changes to white, To
insert tex t y o u  t h e n  press t h e
Commodore key and insert, and the
following text shifts down. You can
now type an unlimited amount of text
between existing text.

script, or superscript, it is possible to
specify the escape code and chrS to
'ENABLE' that particular function b y
designating that code to the Commodore
key + a number, This is the only word
processor I  h ave seen w it h  t h is
speciﬁcation.
40 column solved
Viza Software h ave overcome t h e
problem of a 40 column display very
effectively. It is possible to either type as
normal in which case the whole screen
scrolls to the left as text is inserted (which I
ﬁnd off-putting) or press the Commodore
key and W (for width); the text is then re-
formatted to 40 column. Thus, you can see
everything you type at all times without
the off-putting scroll. If you press the
Commodore key and W again, the text is
instantly returned to the original width. A
post-formatted word processor is alright
when churning out blocks of text but I
ﬁnd them hard to use when presentation
is important. No doubt, many people will
disagree!
Spellbound
Vizaspell is a spelling checker which is
loaded from within Vizawrite. Once the
spell check is over, the program returns to
Vizawrite with two keypresses. There is a
built-in dictionary which contains 30000
words and can learn many more. If you
have specialist needs, the dictionary can
be edited.
Legally binding
Vizawrite is probably the most expensive
of the most popular word processors, but
you get what you pay for.
It is equally capable of both home and
business use and I know of at least two
solicitors ofﬁces where it is their only
word processor. With their specialised
jargon, the spelling checker is ideal and
the time it saves has paid for Vizawrite
many times over.
I feel that, if you are going to buy a
word processor for the ﬁrst time, or wish
to change your present system, you can't
fail with Vizawrite. It's part o f  m y
electronic ofﬁce.
Black marks
One oddity present on Vizawrite is the
way in which it uses a micro full stop
instead of a space. This is an odd quirk
which appears t o  have no particular
function. The micro full stop is too small
to get confused with an ordinary full stop
but I am at a loss as to why it is there.
My other moan is the start-up colours
on the screen. The ﬁrst thing I do when
starting a document is to change the
colour combinations to black screen and
border with green text.

B u s i n e s s
Silicon spreadsheets
Electronic spreadhseets are possibly one
of the most under-appreciated pieces of
business software on home computers. In
many cases, the spreadsheet is used as a
gloriﬁed desktop calculator. But, with
time and practice, a spreadsheet can be a
most valuable tool where any type of
numeric manipulation and forecasting is
required.
Going by the book
A very handy book is 
I
t
 will
not only work out formulae for solving
speciﬁc problems but also has models for
cash ﬂow projection, job costing, work
analysis and so on which can be converted
to work on most good spreadsheets.
Cartridge disc and turbo
Vizastar is available in 2 different versions
- both are on cartridge (4K or 8K) which
also require a disc.
The screen display reminds me of the
Macintosh screen. It is totally professional
with smooth a n d  simple movement
around the screen.
Busicalc is more conventional, One
plus is its very impressive turbo load
system.
Spoilt for choice
In my electronic ofﬁce, I ﬁnd it hard to
choose between Vizastar and Busicalc.
Busicalc is  pur ely  a  spreadsheet
whereas Vizastar is also a programmable
database. But, both are excellent pieces of
software which illustrate just how good a
tool the Commodore 64 can be in a
business environment. Both work fast -
global calculation is noticably faster than
on most of the other spreadsheets listed
below.
On the minus side, the manuals are
helpful b u t  d o  n o t  s timulate t h e
imagination. Vizastar also contains an
excellent demo program which points out
some possibilities but still leaves the user a
little dry.
Setting a standard
Spreadsheets are one of the few programs
where a  degree o f  standardisation is
present. From my experience, if you press
a particular letter, you tend to get the
same menu of choices. This does mean
that if you are in a situation where you are
using a  spreadsheet i n  a  business
environment on your micro, it would be
possible f o r  y ou t o  have a  similar
arrangement on your M  at home. For
development a n d  e x p e r im e n t a l
purposes, this is a tremendous help. I am
aware of one instance where a complete
cashﬂow forecasting model was set up on
a 64 and then transferred to a spreadsheet
on a Sirius. All the development was done
by one man at home.
It is hard to do a spreadsheet justice in
a demonstration in a retail outlet. A good
demonstration takes time, and in  an
average chain store, the retailer probably
won't know much more than you. Try and
ﬁnd somebody who already owns one,
and ask them to let you experiment.

Money-go-round
Sales ledgers, purchase ledgers, cash
books and nominal ledgers deserve a
business supplement t o  themselves.
There ar e several available and the
intricacies are such that it is difﬁcult to
recommend one in particular.
Incapacitated
Most businesses have the same basic
needs as far as ledgers are concerned
although the methods used may differ
greatly.
One problem many people have when
they have been running programs like
these for a while is the sudden realisation
that they do not have sufﬁcient account
capacity. Before buying, make sure that
you know how many accounts you have,
approximately how  many invoices the
largest account may have and so on.
Ensure that the person selling you the
package understands your requirements.
Field testing
A problem with reviewing this type of
package is ﬁeld testing. It is possible to
enter sets of dummy data and feel that
everything looks OK but, when a program
is being used fully and regularly, things
can be quite different. I must, therefore,
point out that my observations are based
either on dummy data or a few weeks side
by side true use.
My star buy based on these points is•
the set of software from Anagram.
Essentially, this is a cashbook, sales
ledger and purchase ledger. There are
other modules such as stock control but
these are not relevant in this context.
Anagram's software has been available
for a wide range of Commodores for a
long time so the format they have found
has been well tried and tested. They are as
easy to use as ledger can be and are
professional packages.
The question of integration
There is no integration but then total
integration o f  modules  w o u ld  b e
expecting too much of the 64. However,
the structuring of the programs is so good
that little 'end work' is required.
The manuals are clear and concise but,
if you don't know how to run a ledger, it
may be worthwhile investing in a book
such as Bookkeeping Made Simple.
46 T h e  sales ledger has help screens in
order to prompt you; these can be found
for most parts of the program where you
may enc ounter  problems . Inv oic e
printing is part of the sales ledger and
ﬂ
posting to the relevant account is done via
a separate option. Cash sales are entered
into a separate cash account.
The capacity of the software depends
on the amount of information that is to be
stored on each account. But, Anagram say
that it will handle 220 accounts where
there is a maximum of 13 invoices per
account or 110 accounts where there is a
maximum of 25 invoices per account.
Anagram's sales ledger  i s  v er y
comprehensive and would not be out of
place in any small business.
Purchase ledger
This includes nominal analysis and is in
the same format as the sales ledger, so
ease of use is guaranteed. Capacities again
depend on how many transactions per
customer are needed but, as a guide,
Anagram say 150 supplier acounts and 50
nominal accounts with 4  outstanding
invoices per  account o r  75 supplier

Cashing in
The cash book is the easiest to get to grips
with and may  b e  quite enough for
business where most trade is done in cash
and cannot justify running a sales and
purchase ledger. Its capacity is 50 analysis
headings w i t h  approx imately  2500
postings of 100 analysis headings with 2000
postings. O n c e  again, reports  ar e
complete and very well laid out.
Extra, extra
Company Pack 123 from Impex is very
good. Bookkeeping for the cash trader
from Quick-Count is also very good as are
the others mentioned below. I  have
intentionally omitted any packages that I
found unreliable or too hard to use.

The printed word
Choosing a printer for your
Commodore computer can be
difﬁcult. Due t o the printer
port, some type of interface
will be needed in  order t o
connect a  non-Commodore
printer.
The Commodore MPS801 is
the budget printer in the Com-
modore range but its facilities
are rather limited, and the
other printers in the range are
not particularly easy to obtain.
The answer i s  t o  b u y
another m a k e  a n d  t h e
relevant interface. The most
popular non-Commodore dot-
matrix printer appears to be an
Epson compatible Centronics
type. These usually offer many
facilities not available on the
MPS801. T hos e c hoos ing
daisywheel printers are also
going for the cent ronics type.
There are a wide range of
interfaces to drive a printer.
These can either be software
based or, what I call, hard units.
The software based interfaces
consist of  a lead and driver
software. T he disadvantage
with this arrangement is that
you may ﬁnd that the driver
software conﬂicts in memory
with the program with which
you wish to use the printer.
There are no such problems
with hard units. My particular
favourite is the Turboprint GT
which was reviewed i n  the
December issue of Your Com-
modore.
Canon PW-108A
This is a near letter qualtiy dot
matrix printer. It is a little on
the large side, weighing a hefty
8kg. Its speed is a nifty 160cps in
ordinary mode and 27cps in
near letter quality mode. I have
seen better NLQ printers but
overall the print quality is very
good, and for me a lot better
than the Epson. I t  supports
enlarged ty pe, condensed,
elite, proportional, 8 / 9  d o t
graphics and, with a  good
interface, these options are
easy to select. Paper loading is
easy except that, if you have
pin-feed paper and the lever is
set at friction, the paper fouls
up. There is a 2K printer buffer
which is useful on small print-
runs since it is sufﬁcient to
release the computer fairly
quickly.
siness
Juki Daisywheel
Canon PW-108A
MP-165
Overall I  found this fast,
very quiet, and reliable and I
would imagine i t  would be
long lasting even with high
usage.
The Micro Peripherals MP-165
was another NLQ printer. Its
speciﬁcations were fairly close
to the Canon even down to
Sinclair ZX 80/81 type switches.
This would probably be a wiser
buy than a Canon. Not only is it
cheaper but it also uses Epson
FX ribbons which are usually
available a t  even t h e  most
humble stationery shop - un-
like Canon ribbons which I had
great problems in obtaining. It
is not as quiet as the Canon but
the level was acceptable. It's
NLQ mode (called ﬁne on this)
was very good, with the bonus
that it could be turned on part
way through text print. With a
little practice I found I could
highlight par agr aphs  b y
pressing the 'ﬁne' switch at the
start o f  t he paragraph and
pressing it again at the end.
Like t h e  C a n o n ,  t h i s
appeared to be a workhorse.
The JUKI Daisywheel
This typewriter/printer is for
those of you who are prepared
to sacriﬁce speed f o r  high
quality printout. The Juki is so
slow in fact that I found I could
type faster than it could print
(...unusual but a  great ego
booster).
The tuk i does have the
advantage o f  being a  type-
writer as well but I  would
imagine this  would b e  the
choice o f  the irregular, low
volume user.
It has some nice touches
such as delete mode: you can
go back over a mistake,' lift' the
old character, and overtype
with the correct character. It
also supported decimal tabs
and centering of text. But the
quality left a little to be desired
and it did look like a budget
machine.
The ribbon only lasted a few

a new ribbon proved futile and
so i t  sits here unused and
unloved.
The Epson
This is rather different to the
other three printers mentioned
here. It is a dot matrix printer
with what I would call fairly
standard Epson speciﬁcations,
i.e., enlarged, condensed,
emphasized, double strike,
underline, italics and graphic
modes. However, here is the
difference:
297 mm(w) *  62 mm (h)
107 mm (I).
For those of you (like me) that
were born before 1960 that
could be about as big as a
London bus. In fact it is about
11 inches wide* 3 inches deep
and 2.5 inches high.
Small, yes, but packed full
of fun. It will print on ordinary
paper or heat sensitive paper. It
is friction fed and, if you have a
portable, it is mains or ni/cad
battery powered.
A full 80 column print-out
might make you think that the
end result was printed out on
one of its bigger brothers, and
for only E160 (appx) it's on the
cheap s ide too. I t  is  n o t
particularly fast 40cps (max) but
for the convenience of a mini
printer, its  speed is  worth
tolerating.
The pr int quality is  very
good. There i s  a  variable
density setting so you should
get a reasonable printout on
most paper although smooth is
recommended. The type face is
very obviously Epson but that is
not a bad thing.
For anybody w h o  ﬁnds
space a problem this may well
be the answer. Now all I need is
to get my SX-64 running on an
Ever Ready PP9!
•
Summing up
This has been a very brief look
at just four of the wide range of
printers that can be hooked up
to the 64. Before you buy a
printer, c hec k  t h e  r ibbon
situation. If the lid breaks the
printer will still work, if the case
splits, the printer will still work,
but if you cannot get a spare
ribbon you are stuck!

Bits and pieces
Romag Ceaf  Screen
Filter
When you are in front of a
screen for any length of time,
even the smallest refelction can
be a source of great irritation.
The Romag Ceaf screen helps
ease the problem. At its price it
is remarkable value. It is glass as
opposed to plastic and does get
rid of all but the most direct
reﬂections.
Velcro strips are used to ﬁx
the screen to your monitor/TV
which is a  little crude and
untidy but once there it is fairly
safe. There is little loss of
picture quality with the screen
in place and the whole effect is
more restful t o  t h e  eye.
Because of the high density of
the screen you will need to
increase the brightness quite a
lot. There are other screens
available but most appear to be
close to 000. This is a crude but
effective solution at a fraction
of the cost. A good gift for the
compulsive operator.

Provide your
Commodore 64 with
an extra character set
with this utility from
J.A. Wolfe 111 1 1 1 1 1
THE FEATURES O F  T H IS
utility are as follows:
3)
4)
Whilst p ro vid in g  t h e
alternative characters, the
original built i n  'alpha'
characters are still accessible 5)
although t h e  left-hand
graphics are lost and the
numeric keys are converted 6)
to the new graphic set.
2) The left-hand graphics now
become the new  'alpha'
character set  a n d  a r e
accessed by using the shift
key with the usual character
key. This means that long
strings or print statements
may be easily entered by
using the 'shift lock' key.
Pressing ' run stop' an d
'restore' w ill reset t h e
standard character set.
Many other user deﬁned
graphic routines consume a
lot o f  memory, but this
program only uses 1703
bytes leaving a n  ample
37208 bytes free in which to
store your program.
The new characters are held
in locations 12672 to 12759
and 12808 to 13025.
You may have t h e two
character sets displayed on
the screen simultaneously.

This program requires a  joystick
plugged into port 2.
If the computer has just been switched
on or you haven't loaded a character set,
the bottom of the screen will contain
garbage, both in the character set itself
and in the space above. The six lines
above the set are all spaces (character 32).
You can rid yourself of this unsightly mess
by redeﬁning character 32 to be totally
devoid of "set" pixels and thus a genuine
empty space. Alternatively y ou could
copy one of the Commodore sets, or load
a previously saved set.
If at any time you return to BASIC by
hitting RUN/STOP and RESTORE, the
program can be restarted without loss of

character set(s), sprites and screen data
(See Memory Map).
If a screen is drawn in hi-res mode, 9K
of memory is used in total out of the 16K
available, which is why most commercial
programs tend to use a character mode,
but instead of being letters these are
redeﬁned to make up a small part of the
picture and are then placed together on
the screen.
To deﬁne such characters without the
aid of a utility such as Character Designer
involves sketching your design on graph
paper, testing y our binary arithmetic
converting the sketches to date, typing in
endless lists of data statements and then
ﬁnally running a BASIC program to POKE
the characters into memory.
Character Designer allows y ou t o
the TV screen or monitor instead of graph
paper, then it does all of the calculations
and POKEing to memory. The data is
saved to tape or disc as a block of memory
which can be loaded from within a BASIC
program or as part of a machine code
program eliminating the time-consuming
use of DATA statements.
Character Designer enables you t o
work on 1024 characters in memory at the
same time, These are divided into four
sets of 256 characters, each occupying 2K
of memory. Your program can use any of
these sets instead of the Commodore sets
and even switch between sets during a
program w it h  a  s imple POKE (see
Switching Character Sets).
You could redeﬁne the alphabet to
give you, say, gothic script or italics or
even a futuristic character set for use in
your latest space epic. O r  maybe by
deﬁning blocks of characters as walls,
trees etc , y o u  c an create amazing
backgrounds over which sprites can do
battle, or whatever it is sprites care to dot
At the risk of sounding cliched, the only
limit is your imagination!

Colour table
One method often used in commercial
software to save time and memory and
help simplify programming i n  multi-
screen games is to allocate a colour to
each character. This method is used by
Character Designer.
The character designer section allows
you to set the colour of each character.
This colour is stored in a 256-byte table
(one byte for each character in the set)
and is  primarily used by  the screen
designer when printing a character.
As with the character set the colour
table can be saved to tape or disc and
loaded again f o r  us e i n  y our  ow n
program.
Memory map
The diagram below shows how Character
Designer is located in RAM along with the
character sets, colour table etc. (See also
Programmer's Reference Guide, pp 104-
105).
Using the Character Designer
Screen layout

6 Current set, numbered from 4 to 7.
7 Multi-colour indicator -  reads ON or
OFF. The coloured ﬁgures show the
selected multi-colours.
As mentioned i n  t h e  section o n
loading Character Designer is run by
typing SYS16384_ If the computer has just
been switched on or you haven't loaded a
character set the bottom of the screen will
contain garbage, both in the character set
itself and in the space above. The six lines
above the set all contain 'spaces' (i.e.
character 32). When you run Character
Designer the screen will appear full of
unsightly garbage. Clearing character 32
of any set pixels (making it a true empty
space) will clear the top six lines and
loading a Commodore character set or
one of your own will make sense out of
the bottom lines.
Select mode
•
This is the mode of the designer when ﬁrst
run, allowing you to move quickly to any
character. Using the joystick in port 2 the
character to be edited, indicated by the
ﬂashing cursor, can be selected from the
current character set. The cursor can be
moved in all four directions. When the
ﬁre button or  any key is pressed the
designer goes into EDIT mode.
Edit mode
Once your chosen character has been
selected and button or key pressed you
will be in EDIT mode. As suggested by the
. . . . . . . . . .  
.

name, all editing commands are entered
in this  mode. T h e  mos t important
function is the ability to turn on or off
individual dots  o n  t h e  gr id, whic h
correspond to pixels of the character. The
purple ﬁlled circles indicate "on" pixels
whilst the green hollow circles indicate
"off" pixels. The white circle is the cursor,
controlled by the joystick. Pressing the
ﬁre button switches the pixel from off to
on or vice versa. The actual character can
be seen below the grid.
As well as being able to design the
character directly, there ar e a  large
number of commands that can be input
from the keyboard. These are described
as follows.
Editing commands
The commands are all initiated with a
single key press and are detailed in the
order they appear on the HELP screen.
1 Left arrow and up arrow — mirror
These keys mirror the character on the
grid h o r iz o n t a lly  a n d  v er t ic ally
respectively. NB. These are not the cursor
keys but the keys to the left of the "I" key
and to the right of the "*" key.
2 I-Invert
Inverts the character on the grid: i.e. all
"on" pixel off or vice versa,
3 R —Rotate
Each press of "R" rotates the current
character 90 degrees anticlockwise.
4 Cursor keys
These scroll the character on the grid one
pixel in the appropriate direction with full
wrap-round.
5 Shift /CLR
Clears the grid, making t he current
character a space.
6 Home
Returns the cursor to the top left of the
grid.
7 C — Copy
This powerful command enables any
character from any of the four sets to be
copied to the current character. When
"C" is pressed the mode changes to
"COPY", t h e  bottom cursor stops
ﬂashing, and the prompt "SET?" appears.
If the "L" key is pressed the designer
cycles through the four sets (as described
under LOCATE). When the desired set is
located, or if you wish to copy from the set
on show, simply move the joystick or
press the button. The prompt will change
to "CHAR?" and the cursor will start
ﬂashing. The character to be copied can
now b e  chosen with the joystick as
described later in the section dealing with
SELECT MODE, i.e. as soon as the button is
pressed that character and its colour will
be copied to the current character.
8 X — exchange
This enables the current character to be
swapped with another character from the
same set. O n pressing " X"  the mode
changes to "XCHANGE". Simply select
the character with which to swap the
current character by moving the joystick
until the cursor covers it and then press
the button or any key.
9 CBM/C — CBM
Will co p y t h e  ent ire upper ease
Commodore set into the current set. The
mode will change to "CBM U/C". If you
do not wish to copy the set press "N"
otherwise press any  ot her  k ey  t o
complete the copy.
10 CBM/V — CBM/LC
As above but will copy the lower case
Commodore set.
11 L — Location
This is used to choose which character set
to edit (sets four to seven). Pressing "L"
moves you to the next set. If the current
set is seven, the next will be four.
12 S — Select
This puts the designer into SELECT mode.
13 N N e x t
Will advance to the next character. If the
current character is 255, this will have no
effect.
14 P — Previous
Will go back to the previous character. If
the current character is 0 this will have no
effect.

This allows you to input a character as
eight decimal numbers. When SHIFT/N is
pressed t h e  m o d e  w ill c hange t o
"NUMBER" and a prompt w i l l  appear
by the top row of the grid. A decimal
number (0-255) can be typed in followed
by RETURN. If a number greater than 255
is entered it will disappear leaving just
the prompt. I f  there is  n o  number
following the prompt when RETURN is
pressed it  will have no effect on the
current row. This is then repeated for the
remaining seven rows.
16 D — Data
This prints eight items of data in decimal
alongside the character. This list will
disappear when any key is pressed.

Hints and tips
This section is intended for the beginner
but contains much information of use to
the more advanced user.
Creating multi-colour graphics
In its normal hi-resolution colour mode
the Commodore 64 can only display two
colours in each character square: the
background colour and the character
colour. Luckily it is possible to display four
colours in one square at the cost of
halving t h e  horizontal resolution.
Although this give the graphics a slightly
chunky look, much more colourful
displays are possible.
Instead of a character being eight
pixels wide, as in hi-res colour, a multi-
colour character is only four pixels across,
each pixel being twice the width of a hi-
res pixel. this means that with Character
Designer we are able to use two dots for
each of the four horizontal pixels with the

colour chosen according to the chart
below:

Multi-colour one
Multi-colour two
Character colour
You will notice that the chart says that
when both dots are "on" the double pixel
will be displayed in the character colour.
This is not quite true. If the character
colour is between 0 and 7 (black to yellow)
the character will be displayed in hi-res. If
the colour is between eight and 15 it will
be displayed in multi-colour with the
character colour appearing as character
colour minus eight, e.g. if the character
colour is 10 (light red) and multi-colour is
on, any double pixels with both dots "on"
will appear as colour 10 - 8 = 2 (red).
To demonstrate this try setting multi-
colour one to light blue, multi-colour two
to white and the character colour to red
and switch multicolour ON. Then enter
the following data into a spare character
using NUMBER:
85, 170, 0, 255, 85, 170, 0, 255
You should see a red character like
Figure 1. Now use Fl to advance the colour
to yellow. Press Fl three more times and
the characters should look like Figure 2.
You will notice that we are restricted
to using the ﬁrst eight colours (the ones
printed on the keys) when using multi-
colour, but i f  w e wish t o  have the
character actually appear in multi-colour
we need to add eight to the desired
colour code. No such restriction applies
to the multicolours themselves where we
can choose from all 16 colours. (See also
Programmer's Reference Guide pp 115-
119.)
Using graphics in your own
programs
If you wish to use a character set you have
designed in your own program you will
need to use a program similar to the one
that follows:
1 x = x +  1
2 I F  x 1  THEN LOAD "CHARS",1,1
3 REM YOUR PROGRAM
When run this program will ﬁrstly load
-the ﬁle called "CHARS", presuming of
course that it is saved on tape after your
program or you change tapes after your
program has loaded. This will cause the 64
to continue running the program from
the ﬁrst time. (After a LOAD from within a
program the 64 performs the equivalent
of a  GOTO (ﬁrst line) retaining all
variables.) After loading "CHARS" X will
no longer be equal to one, so your
program will -
work with several ﬁles as below:
1 X  = X + 1
2 I F  X = 1 THEN LOAD "CHARS",1,9
3 I F  X = 2 THEN LOAD "COLOURS",1,1
4 I F  X = 3 THEN LOAD "SCREEN",1,1
5 REM YOUR PROGRAM
You will need the programs saved to
tape in the following order:
1 Your program 2 "Chars" 3 "Colours" 4
"Screen"
While developing a  program you
might like to have the ﬁles saved on
separate tapes. In that case try putting
some sort of prompt in line one:
1 X  -  X  +  1: IF  X<4 THEN PRINT
"CHANGE TAPE THEN PRESS ANYKEY":
WAIT 198,1:POKE 198,0
NB: WAIT 198,1 will stop the program
until you press a key and the POKE will
clear the keyboard buffer.)

POKEing the screen
Printing to the screen using strings of
cursor characters is  a  rather tedious
method and also suffers from a certain
sluggishness. It is often better to POKE
directly to the screen memory.
If w e  ﬁrs t assign t h e  following
variables:
X = column number (0 - 39)
zy = row number (0 - 24)
SCREEN = 1024 (this is the usual position
but it can be altered)
COLOUR = 55296 (the start of  colour
memory)
the addresses to be POKEd can be simply
worked out with the following formulae:
PS = 40 • Y + X
POKE SCREEN + PS, (character number)
POKE COLOUR + PS, (colour code)
e.g.
100X = 20:Y = 15
110 PS = 40 * Y + X
120 POKE SCREEN + P5,1
130 POKE COLOUR * P5,1
will print a white "A" near the centre oi
the screen (providing that SCREEN and
COLOUR have already been deﬁned).
Using the colour table
If in addition to deﬁning SCREEN and
COLOUR w e deﬁne another variable
CTAB = 21504
and use CHAR t o hold the character
number, the following subroutine will
print a character using the colour table •
created with Character Designer.
100 PS = 40 • Y + X
110 POKE SCREEN + PS, CHAR
120 POKE COLOUR + PS, PEEK (CTAB +
CHAR)
130 RETURN

Downloading a screen
You may wish to use a screen you have
designed using Character Designer in
your own programs. To do this set up the
background, border and multi-colours,
choose the character set and turn multi-
colour on or off as desired, then use one
of the following subroutines to download
the desired screen on to the real screen.
NB. You must have loaded the screen,

NB. This program will overwrite any sprite

Moving blocks of memory
There may be times when you wish to
move a character set, screen or even a
colour table t o  a  different place in
memory. The short program below will do
this for you.
10 FOR I = 0 TO LL-2
20 POKE DD + I, PEEK (SS + I)
30 NEXT I
Where LI is number of bytes to be moved
as follows:
DD = the address you want to move the
block to
SS = the address you want to move from
(see the Memory Map)
Sprites
If you wish to use sprites in your program,
remember to leave room for your sprite
data. (The space occupied by a character
set can hold the data for 32 sprites). Note
also that the space occupied by the ROM
image (sets two and three) can't be used
for sprite data.
Banking the VIC chip
As mentioned earlier, the VIC II chip can
only look at 16K of memory at a time. It
usually uses the ﬁrst 16K of memory. This
can cause problems as any character sets
or sprites limit the amount of memory
available to BASIC.
One solution to this is to move the VIC
chip to a different location. The only 16K
that is completely free is that from 16384
to 32767.
This is  done using t he following
commands:
POKE 56578, PEEK(56578) OR 3
POKE 56576, (PEEK(56576) AND 252) OR 2
Now all of the character sets, sprite
data, and screen locations will need to
have 16384 added to their addresses. The
program in the section Moving Blocks
of Memory can be used to move the
character sets. (See also Programmer's
Reference Guide pp 101-102.)
The example sets
Included in the package are two example
character sets. The ﬁrst, ADVENT. SET is a
,
some characters to make up a picture of
the type in many graphic adventures. This
loads into the designer at SET 5. The
associated colour table and screen are
called ADVENT.CLR and ADVENTSCR
respectively. For this set multi-colour
mode needs t o be on and the multi-
colours should be light grey and mid grey.
The second example, which loads at
SET 6, is a double-sized alphabet that
could be used in an educational program
along with a picture of a cuddly toy. The
ﬁles are called TEDDY.SET, TEDDY.CLR
and TEDDY.SCR. T o  see the picture
properly, multi-colour mode has to be
switched o f f .  A  rather challenging
exercise might be to write a program to
convert an ASCII string to these double
height characters and PRINT or POKE
them to the screen.

products of its type, the Sweet Talker
speech synthesiser comes in the form of a
cartridge. The bonus with this product is
taht it is connected to the user port. This
means that the cartridge slot is left avail-
able. Since the Sweet Talker does not
interfere with the operating system, it can
be left in place most of the time. The
audio output leaves via the audio/video
connector.
This package uses t h e  allophone
approach t o  generating speech. This
means that rather than having a ﬁxed
vocabulary of words, you are given the
ability to create a huge range of sounds.
This is achieved by splitting speech into 63
sounds o r  allophones . Thes e a r e
combined, rather like syllables, to create
words. The system adopted by Cheetah,
however, is  somewhat ﬁddly . Each
allophone mus t b e  converted t o  a
numerical code and this code used by a
machine code routine t o  create the
sound. This means that you must perform
the tedious tasks of converting words into
allophones and then converting t he
allophones to data. I have seen better
approaches to dealing with this problem.
The clarity of the speech generated by
Sweet Talker is good but has a rather
mechanical timbre similar t o  that TV
favourite Metal Mickey. The absence of
intonation s omewhat hinder s  t h e
ﬂexibility of the system, but the quality is
above average. The package comes with a
demonstration cassette.
Overall, this  i s  a  good produc t
which is worthy of serious consideration.

MOST OF US OWN JOYSTICKS AND
appreciate the limitations of using a cable
to connect it to the computer. The RAT is
an alternative approach t o  joystick
control. The system operates in a manner
similar to remote control TV systems and
comprises a, transmitter which you hold
and a  receiver which plugs into the
joystick ports, When you press a control
on the transmitter, an infra-red signal is
sent to the receiver. This is converted into
a form which the computer can interpret.
The upshot of this is that you can sit in
your easy chair and play space invaders on
your computer at the other end of the
room.
The transmitter is  not so much a
joystick as a pressure sensitive pad. A disc
with eight dimples provides the usual
joystick type movement. The dimples are
provided to give a tactile reference point
so that y ou k now which b it  y otir e
pressing. A single pressure pad provides a
ﬁre option.
The ﬁrst obvious impression you get
when using the RAT is that its trickier to
use than a joystick. I found it difﬁcult to
press a speciﬁed position quickly. This was
particularly crucial o n  games such as
Impossible Mis s ion w hic h r equir e
dexterity. No doubt with a lot of practice it
will be possible to achieve sufﬁcient skill
on the RAT, but many may ﬁnd it
daunting. Couple this aspect with its high
price and you have a product which may
have a limited market. This aside, it is a
very well-made product which functions
faultlessly.

Nick McCallen's
machine code routine
will automatically ﬁnd'
and assess the
character memory and
format of a VIC high
resolution screen.
IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND
the operation of this routine,
some understanding o f  the
relationship between character
memory and what appears on
the screen is necessary. So, for
the beneﬁt of hi-res tyros here
a brief explanation.
When the VIC is used in
normal (tex t) mode,  eac h
screen location may display a
character which is made up of
eight rows of dots (pixels). Each
pixel row is in fact one byte of
the character memory, each of
whose bits may be 'on' o r
'off' to provide the dots on the
screen whic h make u p  the
character ( s ee F igur e 1) ,
Therefore t h e  c har ac ter
memory is made up blocks of
eight bytes, each block forming
one character. In text mode,
these blocks are ﬁxed.
In hi-res mode, a temporary
character memory (c m.) i s
created in RAM, with all its bits
initially 'off' i.e. '0' or blank).
Using the techniques outlined
below, each bit may be turned
on or off by a plotting routine.
In or der  t o  d o  this  i n  a
controlled manner , eac h
screen location is  linked o r
'mapped' to a ﬁxed block of
bytes i n  t h e  t empor ar y
character memory. Each block
may be o f  eight or  sixteen
bytes, according to how the
VIC is set up.
A common technique o f
bit-mapping is shown in Listing
1, and results i n  successive
screen locations being mapped
to successive c.m. byte-blocks,
as illustrated by Figure 2, For
the sake o f  illustration the
screen is taken to start at 7680
(SIE00), with the c m. at 4096
($1000).
As can be seen, this results
in t h e  c .m. by tes  b e in g
displayed in successive blocks
along the screen line. This is
easy to achieve, but makes life
awkward for a printer with a
RIES
usable 83(7 matrix, as is the case
with many  printers r un o f f
Commodore computers. T o
make a  printout o f  hi-res
screens easier t o  obtain o n
most Commodore, 5eikosha
and other cheapish dot matrix
printers, a  d if f e r e n t  b i t
mapping technique c an b e
used.
In this alternative method,
vertical columns o f  screen
locations a r e  mapped t o
successive c m .  blocks (see
Figure 3 and Listing 2) so that
slicing out blocks of seven pixel
rows does not demand too
much counter juggling. It also
eases the solution of another
problem: instead of individual
bytes representing a horizontal
pixel row, the printer expects a
byte to represent a VERTICAL
column of pixels (see Figure 4),
The eighth bit in each printer
byte is not actually part of the
character
on paper.
There a r e  t w o  o t h e r
advantages i n  u s in g  t h i s
alternative method. Firstly the
arrangement o f  the c m .  is
constant whether we use 13x8
or 8x16 character blocks --
8)06 permits use of full screen
hi-res, Secondly, in the plotting
routine, the Y value is plotted
direct, as any increment along
this axis corresponds t o  an
identical increment in the c.m.
byte number. This reduces the
calculations required i n  the
plotting routine, and slightly
increases the speed of a very
slow BASIC routine_
Now we have to tackle the
pr oblem o f  c o n v e r t in g
horizontal c.m. bytes to vertical
bytes for the printer. This is
where the dreaded machine
code provides t h e  easiest
answer. Included in the 6502
instruction set are instructions
which permit rotation of bytes
to push the end bit out of a byte
into a  'carry' bit. Another
instruction can then be used to
take the value of this carry and
push into the end of another
byte (see Figure 5), Using these
instructions we can strip one
bit at a time off successive cm,
bytes and build them into a
vertical byte as required by the
printer. N o w  that w e  have
broken out in machine code,
we may as well write the whole
routine in machine code: the
normal screen dump is slow
enough in BASIC, so goodness
knows how long a hi-res dump
would take!
The Hiprint routine
The routine has been written
for m a x im u m  ﬂex ibility .
Avoiding any absolute jumps
within the routine means that it
can be loaded into any suitably
protected part of RAM by the
loader pr ov ided. Suitable
locations f o r  t h e  different
conﬁgurations possible with
VIC are discussed later.
The operational part of the
routine starts by ﬁnding the
temporary character memory
start address. The number of

resetting it to zero.
This illustrates t h e  d if -
ference between SHIFT and
ROTATE operations. Each byte
in the storage area has its bit 7
stripped off in this way until the
accumulator contains all the bit
7's, i.e. a vertical byte. This byte
is sent to the printer, and the
process repeated for bits 6,5,
and so on until all the seven
bytes have been completely
stripped. The next block is then
read into the work area,and the
process starts again.
Each byte sent to the printer
sets a column of needles in the
print head. Bit 0 sets the top
needle, bit 1 sets the next one
down, and so on down to 6. Bit
7 is not printed, but must beset
to logical (AND $  80), Loading
the accumulator with zero at
the start of each byte assembly
simply prevents any stray values
appearing in the printout.
Counter locations used

These counters are all in zero

screen bytes. As it uses double
height characters, a character
memory of 3520 (220 x 16) bytes
is required. This when added to
506 bytes for screen memory
uses u p  more space than
desirable in the unexpanded
VIC, as there would not be any
room for a program! Therefore,
a minimum of 3K expansion is
essential. W i t h  j u s t  3 K
expansion the pointers to top
of memory should be set to
Page 1 6 ,  t o  protect t h e
character memory, which starts
at 4096, with the screen start at
7680. But, if the Hi-Print routine
is to be used, it is kept between
Pages 15 & 16, so set top of
memory to Page 15 with!
POKE 56,15 : POKE 52,15: Clr
before loading anything. Hi-
Print can then b e  located
starting at 3840.
If using more than 3 K
expansion (i. e .  m a i n  R A M
above screen), it is necessary to
raise the bottom of memory to
Page 3 2  b ef o re loading
anything, in  order t o  leave
room for the cm. and screen
below the program. This is
done with
POKE 44,32 :  POKE 8192,0
NEW
The NEW is needed to reset all
BASIC pointers t o  the new
conﬁguration. In this situation
the Hi-Print routine can very
conveniently b e  lo ad ed
anywhere between 1024 and
4096. In the program as printed,
SYS 1024 calls t h e routine
loaded at the bottom of this
area. This address can easily be
changed by altering the target
address in the accompanying
loader program.
Neither this program nor
the one for the unexpanded
VIC are anything spectacular;
they are merely demonstrations
of technique. They are however
sequenced so that bit-mapping
and clearing the screen can be
observed.
Hires 2
This is a highly condensed and
slightly modiﬁed version of
Hires 1, written to run on the
basic VIC. The screen format is
reduced to 10 rows x 22 co-
lumns and uses 8 x characters,

routine. A s  t h e  character
memory requires 10)(22)(8 =
1768 bytes, the c m. ends at
6888, leaving a large enough
gap between it and the screen
start at 7680 for the Hiprint
routine -  as long as we are
careful not to use any of these
locations accidentally when
plotting onto the c.m.
A good starting address for
the routine in this case would
be at the beginning of Page 29
(i.e. 7424). In fact this would
permit a few more lines to be
used for the hi-res screen.
If using the accompanying
loader, it is necessary to set the
top of memory pointers to Page
29 by
POKE 56,29 : POKE 52,29 :
the pointers must be reset to
Page 20 by the same method.
In both programs, the X
range is 0 to (8xno. columns),
while the Y (vertical) range is
from 0  t o  (axno. lines) i n
Program 2, and 0  to (16xno
lines) in Program 1.
Basic loader
The loader requests a  start
location f o r  t h e  H ip r in t
routine. I t  then performs a
checksum for each set of six
data values, conﬁrming each
line. If an error is detected, the
program s t o p s  a n d  t h e

In this month's
project, Garry
Marshall shows you
how to create a
program using
animated effects.
PROGRAMS THAT DEPEND
on mobile graphics for their
fascination a n d  attrac tion
range from games to the better
educational programs. Moving
graphics are a key feature of all
the games  o f  t h e  Space
Invaders t y p e  t h a t  h a v e
developed through Pacman to
today's sophisticated products.
The most notable instance in
education where the allure of
animation has been used to
good effect is Logo. A Logo
microworld f u ll o f  mov ing
shapes is a perfect test-bed for
learning about t he laws o f
motion, gravity and many other
topics.
The solution
The 64 can maintain up to eight
sprites, and we want each to
move around on the screen in
its o w n  way. By  writing a
subroutine for  moving each
sprite w e can write a main
program t h a t  c alls  e a c h
subroutine in turn. Then the
program can continually cycle
round the eight subroutines to
keep the eight sprites moving.
Remembering that the sprites
are numbered from 0 to 7, this
will give us the heart of our
program as in Listing 1.
Here, the loop variable, K,
ranges thr ough t h e  s prite
numbers. The next line calls the
subroutine starting at line 500
when K is 0 to move sprite°, the
subroutine starting at line 1000
when K is 1 to move sprite 1.
and s o on. When all eight
sprites have been moved, line
270 sends the computer back to
the beginning of the loop to do
it all again.
There is a neater way of
doing this. If we store the line
numbers at the start o f  the
n
subroutines for moving sprites
0 to 7 in elements 0 to 7 of a
array named say. M, we can
enter Listing 2.

nitial positions. Then we can
complete t h e  program b y
writing t h e  subroutines f o r
moving the sprites.
The eight sprites will each
have their own colour and,
when they are ﬁrst displayed, a
position. Each position can be
ﬁxed by giving a column and a
row. To represent the colours
and positions we can use three
parallel arrays, as shown in
Figure 1. The arrays H, C and R
will h o ld ,  respectively, t h e
Hues. initial Columns and
initial Rows for the sprites. The
hue, column and row for sprite
K will be held in element K of
the relevant array.
To give the sprites the initial
positions shown in Figure 2, we
start the program with Listing 3.
After this, w e make the
program clear the screen and,
leaving a  gap i n  t h e  lin e
numbering t o  ﬁll later with
initialisations f o r  t h e  subr-
routines, w e  store a  sprite
description to be shared by all
the sprites. We have described
the mec hanic s  o f  s pr ite
descriptions i n  a n  ear lier
project, and using the same
description for a hash-shaped
sprite that we used before gives
us Listing 4.
Now, w i t h  t h e  s pr it e
description stored, w e  c an
associate it with all eight sprites
by making the eight locations
starting at the one with address
2040 point to it. We give the
sprites their colours by copying
the colour codes from the array
H to the block starting at 53287
and, similarly, give them their
initial positions by transferring
the column and row numbers
from the arrays C and R to the
block from 53248 to 53263. This
is done by Listing 5.

Even now, the sprites won't
appear, because we must turn
them on. This can be done for
all the sprites with:

to 230 will show the eight
coloured sprites in their initial
positions. (If you include lines
240 to 270, though, you will get
an er r or  message, f o r  w e
haven't got round to writing
the subroutines which they call
yet). I f  you want to test the
whole thing up to line 270, you
can inc lude 'dummy ' s ub-
routines that d o  absolutely
nothing except establish that
the structure of the program is
alright by adding a series of
lines such as:
500 RETURN
1000 RETURN
and so on up to
4000 RETURN
Now we had better replace
these empty subroutines with
routines that will actually move
the sprites. We shall not write
all eight, but just those for the
odd-numbered s prites  t o
make them move along the
paths that are indicated o r
Figure 2.
Sprite number 1 is to move
up and down along a vertical
path, bouncing off imaginary
barriers a t  eac h end. This
means that it stays in the same
column all the time, so we need
not change that.
Its r o w  m u s t  k e e p
changing, though. I f  w e
store the amount by which it
changes u n d e r  V S  a n d
initialise VS in line 110, along
with other variables for  the
other subroutines, then the
subroutine must take the row
position o f  s prite 1  f r o m
location 53251, a d d  t h e
contents of VS to it, and put the
new v alue back. This  w ill
automatically move the sprite
to the new position.
The only other thing that we
need to do is to test whether
the sprite has  reached t he
'wall' a t  o n e  e n d  o r  t h e
other a n d ,  i f  i t  has , t o
change the sign of the number
stored in VS to make the sprite
bounce bac k . _Since t h e
subroutine for sprite 1 starts at
line 1000, this gives us Listing 6.
The subroutine for sprite 3
follows the same lines. See
Listing 7.
The path for sprite 7 is a
circle centred at (140,140) with
radius 80. This means that for
any value of  an angle T the
point (140-801rcos(T),1404-80*s
in (T)) is on this circle, and as
the value of T increases the
corresponding p o in t  moves

anti-clockwise ar ound t h e
circle, Als o, " r : i  w ill giv e
the initial position of sprite 7.
So, with I initialised to 0 in line
110, w e  can move sprite 7
round its  circular path with
Listing 8,
Although the path of sprite
5 is an elliptical one, the sprite
can be sent along it in much the
same way by Listing 9.
It is left t o  you to write
subroutines to move the even-
numbered sprites. The listing
of the program as far as we have
developed i t  i s  giv en i n
Program 1.
Moving on
At this  stage, w e can take
developments a little further by
tur ning o f f  t h e  e v e n -
numbered sprites, since there
is as yet no way to move them,
and use the 54's sprite collision
detection t o  tur n them o n
again. This will illustrate how
the collision detection works,
and in so doing will provide the
basis o n  w h i c h  s o m e
spectacular effects can be built.
For ins tanc e, i t  c a n  b e
elaborated so that when two
sprites collide one of them is
wiped out or, perhaps, a new
one is born.
At the start of the program,
we can use another array, Q,
parallel t o the arrays for the
hues, columns and rows, t o
record w h ic h  s pr ites  a r e
initially on and which off, Its
element K records that sprite K
is on by containing a 1 and that
it is off by holding a O. The array
can be declared, initialised to
show t h a t  o n ly  t h e  o d d -
numbered sprites are on, and
then used t o turn just these
sprites o n with the amend-
ments and insertions in Listing
10.
We can then use the array Q
to ensure that the program
only bothers to try to move
sprites that are on by adding
the following line to the central
movement monitoring section
of the program.
245 IF co(K)3 THEN 260
Now, the sprite collisions
are recorded in location 53278.
What happens, for example, is

location ar e set. I t  is  also

we could add the line.

This will test and clear the

subroutine to turn on another
sprite i f  a  collision has just
occurred. All the subroutine
has to do is to scan the array Q
to ﬁnd a sprite that is off, and
then update Q  and turn the
sprite on. This can be done by
Listing 11.
Actually, the way that the
subroutine is triggered is not
entirely satisfactory. This  is
because once two sprites meet
they can stay in contact for
some t ime.  Although t h e
collission is  recorded when

clears it, and if the sprites are
still in contact the next time

recorded again. For this reason,
the meeting of  one pair of
sprites can be recorded several
times a s  a  c ollis ion and,
correspondingly, will turn on
several sprites. This  is  n o t
exactly what we wanted, To
avoid it, we must replace line

In effect, we must say Has a

that can be made include the
following.

eresting effects as can the
use of a path that depends
on the positions of the other
sprites.
• A  larger part of the screen
can be used for movement.
To store column positions in
excess of 255 requires more
than one eight-bit location,
and i t  is  possible t o  use
location 53264 to hold one
extra bit for  the column
position of each of the eight
sprites.
• A l l  sorts of effects can be
created by  making sprites
vanish and disappear on
particular cues. if all eight
sprites are turned on the
program should be preven-
ted from calling the sub-
routine to try and turn or
another, ﬁrst, because it
can't and, second, because
it slows the program down

A.P. and D.J. Stephenson •
tackle the problem of using
machine code to sort string
arrays into order.
SORTING STRINGS IS MORE DIFFICULT
than sorting numbers because of the
manner in which the BASIC interpreter
stores strings. But, it is no good writing, or
even attempting to write, a machine code
string sort until the storage mechanism is
thoroughly understood.
String descriptors
Strings a r e  controlled b y  string
descriptors which consist of three bytes as
shown in Figure 10.1. The ﬁrst byte holds
the string length and refers to the number
of bytes occupied by the string which, of
course, is the same as saying the number
of characters in the string. This shows why
the number of characters BASIC allows in
one string is restricted to 255. The highest
number possible in any byte, including
the string length byte, is 255. The other
two bytes in the string descriptor give the
string address (in the form of low-byte,
high-byte) where the strings are stored.
They are merely address pointers, not the
strings themselves. The actual string,
consisting of the equivalent ASCII codes,
is stored in sequential memory locations,
starting at the address given b y the
address pointer in the string descriptor.
Increasing memory
Figure 10.1 Keeping strings under control
ﬁgure 10.2 Handling string arrays
P r o g r a m m i n g
Thus, in the part of a sort routine where
two strings have to be swapped (because
they happen to be in the wrong order), we
swap over the descriptors rather than the
strings themselves. When sorting, then, it
is only necessary to ensure that the string
descriptors are in  order. The strings
themselves can be left in exactly the same
haphazard order they were in before the
sort process began. This will clearly
reduce the execution time of the sort. In
effect, w e  are tricking t h e BASIC
interpreter by rearranging its string array
access table ( a  collection o f  string
descriptors).
How string arrays are stored
A string array is a collection of separate
strings, sheltering under a  common
-name. W e  would therefore expect
the format for handling string arrays to be
more complicated than simple strings
because it must cater, not only for the
array name, but also for the number of
dimensions in the array together with the
array size. However, string arrays are
handled in a similar way to integer arrays.
See Figure 10.2.

array name. In order for the interpreter to
distinguish string arrays from integer or
ﬂoating point arrays, the ﬁrst byte is the
ASCII code of the ﬁrst character of the
array name. (You will remember from last
month's discussion, that the ﬁrst byte in
the integer array format is the ASCII code
+ $80.) The second byte is either the
second character of the array name *$80
or, if there isn't one, just $80. As an
example. 8$ would have $42 (the ASCII
code for B) in the ﬁrst byte and $80 alone
in the second byte. On the other hand, if
the array name was BC$, the second byte
would be the sum of the ASCII code for
($43) and the constant $80, making a total
of $C3.
Bytes 3 and 4
These are address pointers to the next
array arranged in the order low byte, high
byte.
Byte 5
The number of dimensions in the array,
obviously limited to 255.
Bytes 6 and 7
The array size, in high-byte, low byte
order for a change. The three-byte string
information blocks then follow on after
the heading information.

Armed with this information o n  the
storage of string arrays, we can now turn
to the study of Program 10,1.
Bubble sort string array
The homely, and sometimes despised,
algorithm known as the bubble sort is
again used, In BASIC it is horribly sluggish
but in machine code it is quite acceptable
and has the advantage of  using little
memory. Comparison with the integer
version. Program 9.1, given in last month's
issue, shows that they both have a good
deal in common. Not every one will have
an assembler for entering Program 10.1
directly because it is in source code so the
equivalent machine c ode bytes ( the
object code) are given in the form of a hex
dump shown as Program 10.1A.
To enter the machine code bytes, they
can be POKEd individually, starting with
the ﬁrst byte at address 49152. However,
remember that the Commodore 64 does
not recognise hex bytes which means that
you would have the boring task o f
converting them all to decimal ﬁrst a n d
without making one single error! Fear
not. Type in Program 10.3 which accepts
data written in hex.
Once you have entered the code, you
won't know whether you have entered
everything correctly or, indeed, whether
the program works at all. This is where
Program 10.2 comes in handy. Assuming
the machine code bytes are already in a
block o f  memory starting at decimal
address 49152, this program will call on
the machine code and try everything out
for you including the time the machine
takes to execute the sort. You don't have
to provide test strings because t h e
program generates them randomly. Try it
out with only a few strings to start with
then double the number while noting
how execution time increases rather
steeply each time.

Understanding t h e  source
code
A ﬂow diagram of the rather complex
string comparison section o f  Program
10.1, is shown in Figure 10.3. Use it in
conjunction with the following line by
line treatment of the mechanism.
Lines 30 to 110 assign labels to all used
locations. All locations used for storage
are in page zero.
Lines 120 to 180 subtract 1 from the two-
byte quantity stored in  NUMBER and
NUMBER +1.
Lines 190 to 250 collect the array space
start address which is always stored in
locations $2F and $30. An offset of $0A is
added in  order t o  point t o  the ﬁrst
element of the array. This also skips the
array zero element which may contain an
array heading and thus will not need to be
included in the sort. The result is placed
temporarily in address pointer TWO (two
bytes).
Lines 260 to 290 initialise the swop ﬂag,
FLAG (1 byte) and the loop counter,
COUNT (two bytes) to zero.
Lines 300 to 330 copy the contents of
pointer TWO to pointer ONE (two bytes
each).
Lines 340 to 380 increment pointer TWO
by adding 3, because it must point to the
next string information bloc k  thr ee
locations away.
Lines 390 to 410 use indirect addressing to
fetch the length of the ﬁrst string from the
string information block. This data is
stored in pointer ONE.

Lines 420 to 430 do the same for the
second string. The data is stored in pointer
TWO
Lines 440 to 530 obtain the start addresses
of the string pair, again using indirect
addressing. The addressing are stored in
the page zero locations STRING1 and
STRING2 (two bytes each).
Line 540 clears the Y  register which
doubles as the suing character counter.
Lines 550 to 580 compare the ASCII codes
of the string character pairs. The entire
string descriptors are swapped over if they
are in ascending order. Otherwise, they
are left alone.
Line 590 increments the string character
counter.
Lines 600 to 610 compare the length of the
ﬁrst string LENGTH1 t o  the character
counter. If they are equal, no swap is
required.
Lines 620 to 630 compare the second
string length LENGTH2 to the character
counter and, if equal, a swap is made.
Line 640 forces a branch back to LOOP3
ready for comparing the ASCII codes of
the next pair of string characters. This
cycle continues while neither o f  the
above comparisons has resulted in a swap
or a no swap branch.
Line 650 is an out-of-range branch patch.
It is due to the limit on displacement
imposed by  relative addressing which
would have been exceeded in line 960.
This method is an alternative to using an
absolute JUMP whic h w ould cause
problems if the object code were to be
relocated.
Line 660 stores 2 in the Y register. This acts
as a byte counter and also as an index
E
Line 670 sets the swap ﬂag. Any non-zero
value stored in the location labelled FLAG
indicates that a swap has taken place.
tines 680 to 750 swap the 3-byte string
descriptors, one byte at a time, using the X
index r e g is t e r  a s  a  t e m p o r a r y
intermediate storage location.
The remaining lines 760 to 970 are similar
to lines 530 to 740 of the integer sort array
given last month.
Using the routine
It is important to remember that, in use,
the string array to be sorted must be the
ﬁrst DIMensioned i n  BASIC. This is
because the start address, of the array to
be sorted, is calculated from the start of
the array space stored by the Commodore
64 in locations $2F (low byte) and $30 (high
byte). If the above is not adhered to the
sort routine will simply not work.
The ﬁnal code is present in memory
from $C000 (49152 decimal) onwards.
In order to use it all we need supply is
the number o f  array elements t o  be
included in the sort. For example, say that
the total number of strings sorted in the
array is placed in the variable B%. The
following two lines of BASIC will split that
number into a high byte and low byte
component ready f o r  POKEing in t o
locations SF13 and 5FC (251 and 252
decimal):
10 HB%=B%/256
20 LB% =B%- ( HB%*256)
The values are POKEd with the following
two lines:
30 POKE 251,LB%
40 POKE 252,HB%
Finally, the routine is called from BASIC
by: SYS 49152
Table 10,1 is a general guide to the
sorting speed to be obtained for various
random length strings. The table reveals
that it takes approximately four times as
long to sort double the number of strings.

which is wildly inaccurate. (Typical!) So,
whereas I said
F=I NT(F Q/0.05961)
it should have been 0.06097. This, I'm
told is a much more accurate ﬁgure. In
any case, FREKK needed a bit of tweaking
up, so here is the elegant sequel, FREKK II,
So, that's how you get the FIF and II's, but
where do you get the note frequencies in
Hertz from? Right here! (Note: T he
number after each pitch denotes the
octave). See Table 1.

between 0  and 4000Hz. (That's pretty

Special effects
A v er y  impor tant fac ility  i n  t h e
performance of a synth sound is that of
glide (sometimes called portamento,
goodness knows why!). This means when
you play  note the next note glides
smoothly up to correct pitch rather than
steps up to it. Let me demonstrate:
This program renders a gliding note from
C in the 4th octave to C in the 5th octave.
qualities. A sample input/output might be
like this:
Frequency 1 = 932.33Hz
Frequence 2 = 164.81Hz
In order to use ring mod on Osc 1 we must
select both triangle and ring mod; ring
mod modulates the triangle wave of Oscl
with the output of Osc 3. Really the best
way for you to learn all about ring mod is
to mess about with it, so try:
POKE 54276,18.06+2=180
Give it a whirl and see what you can come
up with.
Mostly, ring modulated waveforms
contain a l l  manner  o f  unwanted

It is done by incrementing the pitch by
very small amounts, so the steps aren't
audible. To hear the steps, just put in a
delay:

and now you can hear the stepping

humanity (bendiness) to otherwise digital
Isteppy) sounds.
Now some difﬁcult bits
Hidden deep within the heart of each
oscillator o n  the SID lie a  few very
sophisticated controls. See Table 2.
Synchronisation, or sync, effects can
give you some wonderful synth tones.
One oscillator's waveform is modulated
with a n o t h e r ,  t h e  f u n d a m e n t a l
frequencies of the ﬁrst being made to
conform to the second's. This gives you
some very rich harmonic blends, and al-
though the pitch stays the same the har-
monic content alters, giving you an enor-
mous range of tone "colours". Sync for
Osc 1 resides in address 54276 and to
activate it you POKE 54276,1.
Ring modulation, or  ring mod, is
perhaps best known for being the effect
on a Dalek's voice: fortunately it's uses in
synthesis and music tend to be a little less
disturbing! Ring mod is primarily used in
the creation o f  realistic bell o r  gong
tones; a  r in g  modulator takes t w o
frequencies and outputs a compound of
the sum of the two frequencies (Huh?),
and the difference between them. The
result is a waveform whose harmonics are
not r elated ( t hey  a r e  nor mally ) ,
producing highly detailed metallic tonal
quality. To clean them up you need to
ﬁlter the sound.
Filter tips
With trepidation in my heart, it is my
solemn duty to lead you by the nose into
yet another table, this time the registers
governing the ﬁlter. See Table 3.
The registers hold as follows:
Filter cut-off: 54293 and 54294
Register 54293's last ﬁve bits (right to left,
the dashes) *aren't used. The remainder
plus 54294 are the ﬁlter cut-off values, and
as with previous registers, you can use
them alone or added together (to get
FC10 + FC8 = 128+32 = 1601). These bits
don't control the cut-off point or the
frequency o f  t h e  ﬁlter; they  ar e a
reference point and the effect they cause
is due entirely t o  t he type o f  ﬁlter
selected. (See Filter Type/Volume).
Resonance/Filter: 54295
Resonance affects t h e  frequencies
around the cut-off point, emphasising
them and making them brighter. The ﬁrst
three bits (right to left) of this register
govern which Oscillators go through the
ﬁlter. The fourth bit is very interesting.
This is the external input to the ﬁlter,
whereby you can use the ﬁlter in the 64's
synth to ﬁlter an external instrument's
output! Interesting though it is, it really
shouldn't be used without expert advice;
you can blow up the chip if you're not
careful!
Filter type/volume: 54296
The ﬁrst four bits govern the overall
volume of the system in a scale of sixteen
values, from 0  (not a sausage) to 15
(blasting your speaker off). The next three
bits select ﬁlter type: hi-pass, lo-pass and
band pass. hi-pass lets high frequencies
through, lo-pass lets low  frequencies
through and band pass lets frequencies at
and either side o f  the cut-off point
through and stops those further away.
(There is actually another type of ﬁlter
available if you add hi and band pass
together - band reject or notch. This is the
exact reverse o f  band pass, letting
through all frequencies save the ones at
the selected cut-off.) The last bit in this
register is Osc 3 Off, Oscillator 3 can be
very useful as a modulator for the other
two, and in this case the output from 3
might be undesirable (noisy rubbish), so
this gives us the option to toggle its output
off.
The sophistication of the SID's ﬁlter is
the one thing which sets the 64 head and
shoulders above other micros, synthesis-
wise. I t  gives y o u  power  ov er  a n
enormous range o f  beautiful s onic
textures and tone colours. Which brings
me to our last section, with some tips on
Imitative Synthesis.
Is it real, or is it synthesised?
Imitative sythesis is the art (or in some
cases science) of imitating natural sounds
or conventional instruments. This is a
controversial topic, as synths can imitate
any ins tr ument, w i t h  in t e llig e n t
programming, and you try telling that to
the Musicians Union; they'd smash your
face in !  Synthesisers, and Computer
keyboards generally, are seen to be doing
for the number of  working musicians
what the advent of computers did to the
number o f  w o r k in g  accountants.
Personally, I don't think musicians have
anything to worry about: nothing sounds
as good as a real instrument played well by
a real person.
And, next month, I'll include some
hints and tips on how to imitate all your
favourite instruments.

THE MOST COMMON USE OF
ﬂashing is that of prompting
the operator t o  take some
action by  ﬂashing a message
several times on the screen.
In the little program called
BASIC-FLASH, notice that A$ is
initialised to a message in line
20 and a delay constant deﬁned
in line 30.
The main FLASH subroutine
(1000-1050) prints the message,
activates a  d e l a y  l o o p ,
obliterates the message and
activates a similar delay loop. If
no key is pressed, the whole
sub-routine is re-entered until
any k ey  press generates a
RETURN. The crucial line is
probably line 1020 which is
merely a cursor up (CHR$(145))
followed by a blank line and
terminated by another cursor
up. T h is  t e c h n iq u e ,  o r
variations built around it, will
work o n  any  Commodore
machine.
Commodore 6 4  owners
might like to try the following
'one liner' which provides a
quick a n d  handy  'screen-
shake'.
FOR J0 TO 255 : POKE 53270,):

The following technique is
usually us ed t o  ﬂash t h e
screen. First o f  all, get the
character from the screen and
then 'EXCLUSIVE-OR' it with
$80 (128 decimal) - this'ﬂips' bit
7 from a 1 to a 0 or vice versa
thus g iv in g  ' n o r m a l '  o r
'reversed' graphics. Then put
the new character back into the
same pos ition. I n  ear lier
versions of the Commodore 64,
the colour must also be POKEd
back to the screen.
Either the whole screen, or
just particular sections of it, can
be reversed. With 1000+ POKEs
6 4  U t i l i t y
RELIABLE
to the screen and the colour
memory map, this would take
an eternity in BASIC.
The machine code routine,
REVERSE-FLASHER, overcomes
the long wait. If the subroutine
is called once only, then a
certain portion of the screen is
reversed: if a delay loop is built
in and the process repeated
several times, you can get the
ﬂashing effect you desire.
Your ﬁrst task in REVERSE-
FLASHER is to decide where to
locate the code - I have placed
it in the cassette buffer out of
force of habit but it can go into
safe location. SC000 (49152) is a
good place if not occupied by
anything else and if you make
variable I N  (LOCATION) i n
line 10 the starting point o f
your code.
Next, three parameters are
ROUTINES
provided: INK (the character
colour); PAPER ( the bac k -
ground c o lo u r )  a n d  t h e
number of lines (starting from
the top of  the screen). The
demo is set up so that INK is
black, PAPER is grey 2 and the
number of lines is set to 10. To
ﬂash the whole screen t he
number of lines would be 25,
The r out ine saves t h e
current character colour and
background colour and then
restores them after the ﬂash.'
The 'nest' ﬂashing effect is
obtained if  the initial paper
colour is maintained through-
out: this  is  because, i f  you
change the PAPER colour, the
whole screen is changed to that
colour whilst the ﬁrst n lines
will ﬂash. The delay loop may
be shortened or lengthened or
even cut out altogether. The
length of the whole ﬂash can
also be controlled in a similar
fashion b y  altering the end
value of the J loop in line 80.
It is best to experiment with
this routine until you ﬁnd an
effect which suits you best.
Finally, a  machine-code
disassembly is  provided f o r
those readers who like to study
such things to see how they
work and also improve them if
necessary.
Happy ﬂashing!

Choosing the right computer
is a good start --- but can you
ﬁnd the right software?

At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because—
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICIREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands; or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for the keen prog-
rammer.

Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STIX, QUINX
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket But
most specialist shops stock titles from Our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card.
