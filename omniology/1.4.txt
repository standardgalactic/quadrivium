Neuron Doctrine:  
• The neuron is the fundamental structural & functional unit of the brain 
• Neurons are discrete cells and not continuous with other cells 
• Information flows from the dendrites to the axon via the cell body 
 
(Drawings by Ramón y Cajal, c. 1900)

What is a Neuron?  
F A “leaky bag of charged liquid” 
F Contents of the neuron enclosed 
within a cell membrane 
F Cell membrane is a lipid bilayer 
Bilayer is impermeable to 
charged ion species such as 
Na+, Cl-, and K+ 
Ionic channels embedded in 
membrane allow ions to flow 
in or out

The Electrical Personality of a Neuron 
F Each neuron maintains a potential 
difference across its membrane 
Inside is about –70 mV relative 
to outside 
[Na+] and [Cl-] higher outside; 
[K+] and organic anions [A-] 
higher inside 
Ionic pump maintains -70 mV 
difference by expelling Na+ out 
and allowing K+ ions in 
[Na+], [Cl-], H2O 
[K+] 
[K+], [A-], [Na+], 
[Cl-],  H2O

Influencing a Neuron’s Electrical Personality 
How can the electrical potential be 
changed in local regions of a neuron?

Ionic Channels: The Gatekeepers 
F Ionic channels in membranes are 
proteins that are selective and 
allow only specific ions to pass 
through 
E.g. Pass Na+ but not K+ or Cl- 
F Ionic channels are gated 
Voltage-gated: Probability of 
opening depends on membrane 
voltage 
Chemically-gated: Binding to a 
chemical causes channel to open 
Mechanically-gated: Sensitive to 
pressure or stretch

Inside

Gated Channels allow Neuronal Signaling 
F Inputs from other neurons  
chemically-gated channels (at 
“synapses”) open  Changes in 
local membrane potential 
F This in turn causes opening/closing 
of voltage-gated channels in 
dendrites, body, and axon, resulting 
in depolarization (positive change 
in voltage) or hyperpolarization 
(negative change in voltage) 
F Strong enough depolarization 
causes a spike or “action potential”

neurons)

The Output of a Neuron: Action Potential (Spike)  
Voltage-gated channels cause action potentials (spikes) 
1. Strong depolarization opens Na+ channels, causing rapid 
Na+ influx and more channels to open, until they inactivate 
2.  K+ outflux restores membrane potential

Active Wiring: Myelination of Axons  
F Myelin due to oligodendrocytes (glial cells) wrap axons and 
enable fast long-range spike communication 
Action potential “hops” from one non-myelinated region 
(node of Ranvier) to the next (saltatory conduction) 
“Active wire” allows lossless signal propagation
