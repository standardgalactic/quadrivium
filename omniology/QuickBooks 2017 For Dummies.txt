Introduction      1
Introduction
R
unning or working in a small business is one of the coolest things a person 
can do. Really. I mean it. Sure, sometimes the environment is dangerous — 
kind of like the Old West — but it’s an environment in which you have the 
opportunity to make tons of money. And it’s also an environment in which you 
can build a company or a job that perfectly fits you.
By comparison, many brothers and sisters working in big-company corporate 
America are furiously trying to fit their round pegs into painfully square holes. 
Yuck.
You’re wondering, of course, what any of this has to do with this book or with 
QuickBooks. Quite a lot, actually. The whole purpose of this book is to make it 
easier for you to run or work in a small business by using QuickBooks.
About This Book
As you start your reading, though, I want to tell you a couple of things about this 
book.
First off, know that I fiddled a bit with the Windows and QuickBooks display 
­settings. For example, I noodled around with the font settings and some of the 
colors. The benefit is that the pictures of the QuickBooks windows and dialog 
boxes in this book are easier to read. And that’s good. But the cost of all of this is 
that my pictures look a little bit different from what you see on your screen. And 
that’s not good. In the end, however, what the publisher found is that people are 
happier with increased readability.
Next point: To make the best use of your time and energy, you should know about 
the conventions that I use in this book, which are as follows:
»
» When I want you to type something, such as With a stupid grin, Martin 
watched the tall blonde strut into the bar and order grappa, it’s in bold 
type. When I want you to type something that’s short and uncomplicated, 
such as Jennifer, it still appears in boldface type.

»
» Except for passwords, you don’t have to worry about the case of the letters 
you type in QuickBooks. If I tell you to type Jennifer, you can type JENNIFER 
or follow poet e. e. cummings’s lead and type jennifer.
»
» Whenever I tell you to choose a command from a menu, I say something like 
“Choose Lists ➪ Items,” which simply means to first choose the Lists menu 
and then choose Items. The  ➪  separates one part of the command from the 
next part.
»
» You can choose menus, commands, and dialog box elements with the mouse. 
Just click the thing you want.
»
» When I provide step-by-step descriptions of tasks, something I do regularly 
within the pages of this tome, I describe the tasks by using bold text and then, 
below the boldfacing, give a more detailed explanation. You can skip the text 
that accompanies the step-by-step boldface directions if you already under-
stand the process.
Foolish Assumptions
I make three assumptions about you:
»
» You have a PC running Microsoft Windows. (I took pictures of the Quick­
Books windows and dialog boxes while using Windows 10, in case you’re 
interested.)
»
» You know a little bit about how to work with your computer.
»
» You have or will buy a copy of QuickBooks for each computer on which you 
want to run the program.
This book works for QuickBooks 2017 (and with the equivalent version of Quick-
Books Enterprise Solutions, which is named Enterprise Solutions 17), although in 
a pinch, you can probably use it for QuickBooks 2016 or 2018 too. (I have to say, 
however, that if you have QuickBooks 2016, you may want to return this book and 
trade it in for QuickBooks 2016 For Dummies by yours truly. Furthermore, even 
though I’m no fortune-teller, I’m willing to predict that you’ll be able to buy a 
QuickBooks 2018 For Dummies book when QuickBooks 2018 comes out.)

Introduction      3

Where to Go from Here
This book isn’t meant to be read from cover to cover like some James Patterson 
page-turner. Instead, it’s organized into tiny, no-sweat descriptions of how you 
do the things you need to do. If you’re the sort of person who just doesn’t feel 
right not reading a book from cover to cover, you can (of course) go ahead and 
read this thing from front to back. You can start reading Chapter 1 and continue all 
the way to the end (which means through Chapter 20 and the appendixes).
I don’t think this from-start-to-finish approach is bad because I tell you a bunch 
of stuff (tips and tricks, for example) along the way. I tried to write the book in 
such a way that the experience isn’t as rough as you might think, and I really do 
think you get good value from your reading.
But you also can use this book the way you’d use an encyclopedia. If you want to 
know about a subject, you can look it up in the table of contents or the index; then 
you can flip to the correct chapter or page and read as much as you need or enjoy. 
No muss, no fuss.
I should mention one thing, however: Accounting software programs require you 
to do a certain amount of preparation before you can use them to get real work 
done. If you haven’t started to use QuickBooks yet, I recommend that you read the 
first few chapters of this book to find out what you need to do first.
Finally, if you haven’t already installed QuickBooks and need help, jump to 
­Appendix A, which tells you how to install QuickBooks in 11 easy steps. And if 
you’re just starting with Microsoft Windows, peruse Chapter 1 of the Windows User’s 
Guide or one of these books on your flavor of Windows: Windows 7 For Dummies, 
Windows 8.1 For Dummies, or Windows 10 For Dummies, all by Andy Rathbone.

I
want to start this conversation by quickly covering some basic questions 
­concerning QuickBooks, such as: Why even use QuickBooks? Where and how 
does a guy or gal start? And — most important — What should I not do?
This little orientation shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Really. And the 
orientation lets you understand the really big picture concerning QuickBooks.
Chapter 1

8      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
Why QuickBooks?
Okay, I know you know that you need an accounting system. Somebody, maybe 
your accountant or spouse, has convinced you of this. And you, being the team 
player that you are, have just accepted this conventional viewpoint as the truth.
But just between you and me, why do you really need QuickBooks? And what does 
QuickBooks do that you really, truly need done? Heck, just to be truly cynical, also 
ask the question “Why QuickBooks?” Why not use some other accounting soft-
ware program?
Why you need an accounting system
Start with the most basic question: Why do you even need an accounting system 
like QuickBooks? It’s a fair question, so let me supply the two-part answer.
The first reason is that federal law requires your business to maintain an accounting 
system. More specifically, Section 446 (General Rule for Methods of Accounting) of 
Title 26 (Internal Revenue Code) of the United States Code requires that you have 
the capability to compute taxable income by using some sort of ­common-sense 
accounting system that clearly reflects income.
If you decide to blow off this requirement — after all, you got into business so that 
you could throw off the shackles of bureaucracy — you might get away with your 
omission. But if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examines your return, and you 
ignored Section 446, the IRS gets to do your accounting the way it wants. And the 
IRS way means that you pay more in taxes and that you also pay taxes earlier than 
you would have otherwise.
Here’s the second reason for maintaining an accounting system. I sort of go out 
on an editorial limb, but I’m going to do it anyway. My strong belief — backed by 
more than three decades of business experience and close-hand observations of 
several hundred business clients — is that you can’t successfully manage your 
business without a decent accounting system. Success requires accurately mea-
suring profits or losses and reasonably estimating your financial condition.
This second reason makes sense, right? If your friend Kenneth doesn’t know when 
he’s making money, which products or services are profitable, and which custom-
ers are worth keeping (and which aren’t), does he really have a chance?
I don’t think he does.
To summarize, your business must have a decent accounting system, no matter how 
you feel about accounting and regardless of how time-consuming and expensive 

CHAPTER 1  QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business      9
such a system is or becomes. The law requires you to have such an accounting sys-
tem. And successful business management depends on such an accounting system.
What QuickBooks does
Go on to the next question that you and I need to discuss: What does QuickBooks 
do to help you maintain an accounting system that measures profits and losses 
and other stuff like that?
QuickBooks truly makes business accounting easy by providing windows that you 
use to record common business transactions. QuickBooks has a window (you 
know, a Windows window that appears on your monitor’s screen) that looks like 
a check, for example. To record a check you write, you fill in the blanks of the 
window with bits of information, such as the date, amount, and person or busi-
ness you’re paying.
QuickBooks also has a handful of other windows that you use in a similar fashion. 
It supplies an invoice window, for example, that looks like an invoice you might 
use to bill a customer or client. You fill in the invoice window’s blanks by record-
ing invoice information, such as the name of the client or customer, invoice 
amount, and date by which you want to be paid.
Here’s the neat thing about these check and invoice windows: When you record 
business transactions by filling in the blanks shown onscreen, you collect the 
information that QuickBooks needs to prepare the reports that summarize your 
profits or losses and your financial situation.
If you record two invoices (for $10,000 each) to show amounts that you billed your 
customers, and then you record three checks (for $4,000 each) to record your 
advertising, rent, and supplies expenses, QuickBooks can (with two or three mouse 
clicks by you) prepare a report that shows your profit, as shown in Table 1-1.

Profit
$8,000

10      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
The parentheses, by the way, indicate negative amounts. That’s an accounting 
thing, but back to the real point of my little narrative.
Your accounting with QuickBooks can be just as simple as I describe in the previ-
ous paragraphs. In other words, if you record just a handful of business transac-
tions by using the correct QuickBooks windows, you can begin to prepare reports 
like the one shown in Table 1-1. Such reports can be used to calculate profits or 
(ugh) losses for last week, last month, or last year. Such reports can also be used 
to calculate profits and losses for particular customers and products.
I know I’m kind of harsh in the first part of this chapter — bringing up that stuff 
about the IRS and business failure — but this accounting stuff is neat! (For the 
record, that’s the only exclamation point I use in this chapter.) Good accounting 
gives you a way to manage your business for profitability. And obviously, all sorts 
of good and wonderful things stem from operating your business profitably: a 
materially comfortable life for you and your employees; financial cushioning to 
get you through the tough patches; and profits that can be reinvested in your 
business, in other businesses, and in community charities.
Let me mention a couple other darn handy things that QuickBooks (and other 
accounting systems, too) do for you, the overworked business owner or 
bookkeeper:
»
» Forms: QuickBooks produces, or prints, forms such as checks or invoices by 
using the information you enter in those check windows and invoice windows 
that I mention earlier. So that’s neat, and a true time saver. (See Chapter 4.)
»
» Electronic banking and billing: QuickBooks transmits and retrieves some 
financial transaction information electronically. It can email your invoices to 
customers and clients, for example. (That can save you both time and money.) 
And QuickBooks can share bank accounting information with most major 
banks, making it easy to make payments and transfer funds electronically. 
(See Chapter 13.)
Why not QuickBooks online?
Now for an awkward question: Should you be using the desktop version of Quick-
Books, or do you need to get with the program and use the online version of 
QuickBooks? Good question.
My suggestion is that you work with the desktop version of QuickBooks — the 
subject of this book. I base this suggestion on two factors:

CHAPTER 1  QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business      11
»
» The desktop version is probably significantly more economical over the years 
you use QuickBooks. I’ve blogged about this (not in a bitter, grumpy-old-man 
way, I hope) at our CPA firm’s website, www.evergreensmallbusiness.com. 
The problem with these subscription-type pricing models is that you pay — 
over time — way, way more for an item. And I believe that this is true with 
QuickBooks.
»
» At least currently, the desktop version of QuickBooks provides more function-
ality and a richer feature set. I’m not going to individually list what is included 
in the desktop version and missing in the online version, but I see holes. (I’m 
happy to stipulate that, yes, at some point Intuit will surely plug these holes. 
But in the meantime, hey, why pay more for less?)
Can I point out one scenario in which the online version does make sense in spite 
of its greater cost and lesser functionality? If you need to have people at different 
locations (across town, across the country, around the globe, and so on) share 
QuickBooks, the online version of QuickBooks rocks. It really rocks.
Note: If your CPA can support your use of QuickBooks simply because you’re using 
the online version, that may justify the extra cost and lighter feature set.
What Explains QuickBooks’ Popularity?
No question about it — you need a good accounting system if you’re in business. 
But you know what? That fact doesn’t explain why QuickBooks is so popular or 
why you should use QuickBooks. (I ignore for one moment the fact that you’ve 
probably already purchased QuickBooks.) Therefore, let me suggest to you three 
reasons why QuickBooks is an excellent choice to use as the foundation of your 
accounting system:
»
» Ease of use: QuickBooks historically has been the easiest or one of the easiest 
accounting software programs to use. Why? The whole just-enter-transaction-
information-into-windows-that-resemble-forms thing (which I talk about 
earlier) makes data entry a breeze. Most businesspeople already know how to 
fill in the blanks in these forms. That means that most people — probably 
including you — know almost everything they need to know to collect the 
information that they need to do their books with QuickBooks. Over time, 
other software programs have tended to become more QuickBooks-like in 
their ease of use. The folks at Intuit have truly figured out how to make and 
keep accounting easy.

12      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
I should tell you, because I’m an accountant, that the ease-of-use quality of 
QuickBooks isn’t all good. Part of the reason why QuickBooks is easy to use is 
that it doesn’t possess all the built-in internal control mechanisms that some 
more traditional accounting systems have. Those internal control mecha-
nisms, of course, make your financial data more secure, but they also make 
the accounting software more complicated to use.
»
» Expense: QuickBooks, especially compared with the hard-core accounting 
packages that accountants love, is pretty darn inexpensive. Different versions 
have different prices, but for a ballpark figure, you can get an excellent 
accounting software solution for a few hundred bucks. Not to go all grandfa-
therly on you or anything, but when I was a young CPA, inexpensive account-
ing software packages often cost several thousand dollars. And it was almost 
easy to spend tens of thousands of dollars.
»
» Ubiquity: The ubiquity issue relates to the ease of use of QuickBooks and the 
cheap price that Intuit charges for QuickBooks. Oddly enough, the ubiquity of 
QuickBooks becomes its own benefit, too. You’ll find it very easy to find a 
bookkeeper who knows QuickBooks, for example. And if you can’t, you can 
hire someone who doesn’t know QuickBooks and then send that individual to 
a QuickBooks class at the local community college (because that class will be 
easy to find). You’ll also find it very easy to find a CPA who knows QuickBooks. 
Now, you might choose to use some other, very good piece of accounting 
software. Almost assuredly, however, what you’ll discover is that it’s tougher 
to find people who know the software, tougher to find classes for the 
software, tougher to find CPAs who know the software, and even tougher to 
find books about the software.
What’s Next, Dude?
At this point, presumably, you know why you need accounting software and why 
QuickBooks is probably a reasonable and maybe even an excellent choice. In other 
words, you swallowed my line about QuickBooks hook, line, and sinker. That deci-
sion on your part leaves the question of what you should do next. Let me say this. 
In a nutshell, before you can begin working with QuickBooks, you need to do the 
following:
1.	 Install the QuickBooks software, as I describe in Appendix A.
2.	 Run through the QuickBooks Setup process, which I describe in 
Chapter 2.
3.	 Load the master files, as I describe in Chapter 3.

CHAPTER 1  QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business      13
If you’re thinking “Whoa, cowboy, that seems like a bit more work than what’s 
involved in installing spreadsheet software or a new word processor,” you’re 
right. You might as well hear from me the ugly truth about accounting software: 
Accounting software, all of it, requires quite a bit of setup work to get things run-
ning smoothly. You need to build a list of expense categories, or accounts, to use 
for tracking expenses, for example. You also need to set up a list of the customers 
you invoice.
Rest assured, however, that none of the setup work is overly complex; it’s just 
time-consuming. Also know from the very start that QuickBooks provides a tre-
mendous amount of hand-holding to help you step through the setup process. 
Remember, too, that you have your new friend — that’s me — to help you when-
ever the setup process gets a little gnarly.
How to Succeed with QuickBooks
Before I wrap up the little why, what, and how discussion of this chapter, I ought 
to provide a handful of ideas about how to make your experience with QuickBooks 
a successful one.
Budget wisely, Grasshopper
Here’s my first suggestion: Please plan on spending at least a few hours to get the 
QuickBooks software installed, set up, and running. I know you don’t really want 
to do that. You have a business to run, a family to take care of, a dog to walk, 
and so on.
But here’s the reality sandwich you probably need to take a big bite of: It takes half 
an hour just to get the software installed on your computer. (This installation isn’t 
complicated, of course. You’ll mostly just sit there, sipping coffee or whatever.)
But after the QuickBooks software is installed, unfortunately, you still have to run 
through the QuickBooks Setup process. Again, this work isn’t difficult, but it does 
take time. Setting up QuickBooks for a very simple service business probably takes 
at least an hour. If your business owns inventory, or if you’re a contractor with 
some serious job-costing requirements, the process can take several hours.
Therefore, do yourself a favor: Give yourself adequate time for the job at hand.

14      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
Don’t focus on features
Now let me share another little tip about getting going with QuickBooks. At the 
point that you install the QuickBooks software and start the program, you’ll be in 
shock about the number of commands, whistles, bells, and buttons that the 
QuickBooks window provides. But you know what? You can’t focus on the Quick-
Books features.
Your job is simply to figure out how to record a handful  — probably a small 
­handful — of transactions with QuickBooks. Therefore, what you want to do is 
focus on the transactions that need to be recorded for you to keep your books.
Suppose that you’re a one-person consulting business. In that case, you may need 
to figure out how to record only the following three transactions:
»
» Invoices
»
» Payments from customers (because you invoiced them)
»
» Payments to vendors (because they sent you bills)
So all you need to do is discover how to record invoices (see Chapter 4), record 
customer payments (see Chapter 5), and record checks (see Chapter 6). You don’t 
need to worry about much else except maybe how to print reports, but that’s easy. 
(See Chapter 15 for the click-by-click.)
“Oh, Steve,” you’re saying, “you just intentionally picked an easy business. I’m a 
retailer with a much more complicated situation.”
Okay, well, you’re right that I picked an easy business for my first example, but I 
stand by the same advice for retailers. If you’re a retailer, you probably need to 
figure out how to record only four transactions:
»
» Sales receipts
»
» Bills from your suppliers
»
» Payments to your vendors
»
» Employee payroll checks
In this example, then, all you need to do is find out how to record sales receipts — 
probably a separate sales receipt for each bank deposit you make (see Chapter 5) — 
how to record bills from vendors, how to record checks to pay your bills (see 
Chapter 6), and how to handle employee payroll (see Chapter 11).

CHAPTER 1  QuickBooks: The Heart of Your Business      15
I don’t want to be cranky or careless here, but one truly good trick for getting up 
to speed with QuickBooks is to focus on the transactions that you need to record. 
If you identify those transactions and then figure out how to record them, you’ve 
done the hard part. Really.
Outsource payroll
Here’s another suggestion for you: Go ahead and outsource your payroll. That’ll 
probably cost you between $1,000 and $2,000 per year. I know, that’s roughly the 
total cost of four discount tickets to Hawaii, but outsourcing payroll delivers three 
big benefits, even after considering the stiff price:
»
» Simplicity: Payroll is one of the most complicated areas in small-business 
accounting and in QuickBooks. Accordingly, you’ll greatly simplify your 
bookkeeping by moving this headache off your desk and onto the desk of 
your accountant (he or she may love doing your payroll) or the payroll service. 
(You can use a national firm, such as ADP or Paychex, or a local firm.)
»
» Penalties: Did I mention that payroll is one of the most complicated areas in 
small-business accounting and in QuickBooks? I did? Good, because you truly 
need to know that payroll preparation and accounting mistakes are easy to 
make. And payroll mistakes often subject you to seriously annoying fines and 
penalties from the IRS and from state revenue and employment agencies. I 
grant you that $1,500 per year for payroll processing seems like way too much 
money, but you need to prevent only a couple of painful fines or penalties per 
year to drastically cut the costs of using an outside payroll service.
»
» Mrs. Peabody’s annual raise: One final reason for outsourcing payroll exists. 
Let me explain. You don’t want to do payroll yourself. Really, you don’t. As a 
result, you’ll eventually assign the task to that nice woman who works in your 
office, Mrs. Peabody. Here’s what will happen when you do that. Late one 
afternoon during the week following Mrs. Peabody’s first payroll, she’ll ask to 
meet with you — to talk about why Mrs. Raleigh makes $15,000 more per year 
than she (Mrs. Peabody) does, and also to ask why she (Mrs. Peabody) makes 
only $2 per hour more than Wayne, the idiot who works in the warehouse. 
Because you’re a nice person, Mrs. Peabody will leave a few minutes later with 
a $1.50-per-hour raise. And at that point, you’ll remember, vaguely, my earlier 
caution about the problem of saving maybe $2,000 per year in payroll service 
fees but then having to give Mrs. Peabody an extra $3,000 raise. Ouch.

Get professional help
A quick point: You can probably get a CPA to sit down with you for an hour or two 
and show you how to enter a handful of transactions in QuickBooks. In other 
words, for a cost that’s probably somewhere between $200 and $300, you can 
have somebody hold your hand for the first three invoices you create, the first two 
bills you record, the first four checks you write, and so on.
You should try to do this if you can. You’ll save yourself untold hours of headache 
by having someone who knows what she or he is doing provide an itty-bit of per-
sonalized training.
Use both the profit and loss statement  
and the balance sheet
And now, my final point: You truly want to use your profit and loss statement (which 
measures your profits) and your balance sheet (which lists your assets, liabilities, 
and owner’s equity) as part of managing your business. In other words, get used 
to producing a QuickBooks profit and loss statement each week, or month, or 
whatever. Then use that statement to determine your profitability. In a similar 
fashion, regularly produce a balance sheet to check your cash balances, the 
amounts customers or clients owe, and so on.
Maybe this advice seems obvious, but there’s a semi-hidden reason for my sug-
gestion: If you or you and the bookkeeper do the accounting correctly, both the 
QuickBooks profit and loss statement and the balance sheet will show numbers 
that make sense. In other words, the cash balance number on the balance sheet — 
remember that a balance sheet lists your assets, including cash — will resemble 
what the bank says you hold in cash. If the QuickBooks balance sheet says instead 
that you’re holding $34 million in cash, you’ll know that something is rotten in 
Denmark.

Setup
The Big Setup
I
know that you’re eager to get started. After all, you have a business to run. But 
before you can start using QuickBooks, you need to do some up-front work. 
Specifically, you need to prepare for the QuickBooks Setup process. And then 
you need to walk through the Setup steps. In this chapter, I describe how you do 
all this stuff.
I assume that you know how Windows works. If you don’t, take the time to read 
Chapter 1 of your Windows user’s guide or try the appropriate edition of Windows 
For Dummies, by Andy Rathbone (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).
Getting Ready for QuickBooks Setup
You need to complete three tasks to get ready for QuickBooks Setup:
»
» Make an important decision about your conversion date.
»
» Prepare a trial balance as of the conversion date.
»
» Go on a scavenger hunt to collect a bunch of stuff that you’ll need or find 
handy for the interview.
Chapter 2

18      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
The big decision
Before you fiddle with your computer or the QuickBooks software, you need to 
choose the date — the so-called conversion date — on which you want to begin 
using QuickBooks for your financial record keeping.
This decision is hugely important because the conversion date that you choose 
dramatically affects both the work you have to do to get QuickBooks running 
smoothly and the initial usefulness of the financial information that you collect 
and record by using QuickBooks.
You have three basic choices:
»
» The right way: You can convert at the beginning of your accounting year 
(which, in most cases, is the same as the beginning of the calendar year). This 
way is the right way for two reasons. First, converting at the beginning of the 
year requires the least amount of work from you. Second, it means that you 
have all the current year’s financial information in one system.
»
» The slightly awkward way: You can convert at the beginning of some interim 
accounting period (probably the beginning of some month or quarter). This 
approach works, but it’s slightly awkward because you have to plug your 
year-to-date income and expenses numbers from the old system into the 
new system. (If you don’t know what an interim accounting period is, see 
Appendix B.)
»
» The my-way-or-the-highway way: You can convert at some time other than 
what I call the right way and the slightly awkward way. Specifically, you can 
choose to convert whenever you jolly well feel like it. You create a bunch of 
unnecessary work for yourself if you take this approach, and you pull out a 
bunch of your hair in the process. But you also have the satisfaction of 
knowing that through it all, you did it your way — without any help from me.
I recommend choosing the right way. What this choice means is that if it’s late in 
the year — say, October — you just wait until January 1 of the next year to convert. 
If it’s still early in the year, you can retroactively convert as of the beginning of 
the year. (If you do this, you need to go back and do your financial record keeping 
for the first part of the current year by using QuickBooks: entering sales, record-
ing purchases, and so on.)
If it’s sometime in the middle of the year — say, Memorial Day or later — you 
probably want to use the slightly awkward way. (I’m actually going to use the 
slightly awkward way in this chapter and the next chapter because if you see how 
to convert to QuickBooks by using the slightly awkward way, you know how to use 
both the right way and the slightly awkward way.)

CHAPTER 2  The Big Setup      19
The trial balance of the century
After you decide when you want to convert, you need a trial balance.
“Yikes,” you say. “What’s a trial balance?” A trial balance simply lists all your 
assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity account balances as well as the year-to-date 
income and expense numbers on a specified date (which, not coincidentally, hap-
pens to be the conversion date). You need this data for the QuickBooks Setup pro-
cess and for some fiddling around that you need to do after you complete the 
QuickBooks Setup process.
Creating a trial balance doesn’t have to be as hard as it sounds. If you’ve been 
using another small-business accounting system, such as the simpler Quicken 
product from Intuit or the Simply Accounting program from Computer Associates, 
you may be able to have your old system produce a trial balance on the conversion 
date. In that case, you can get the balances from your old system. (Consider your-
self lucky if this is the case.)
Just to split hairs, the trial balance should show account balances at the very start 
of the first day that you’ll begin using QuickBooks for actual accounting. If the 
conversion date is 1/1/2017, for example, the trial balance needs to show the 
account balances at one minute past midnight on 1/1/2017. This is also the very 
same thing as showing the account balances at the very end of the last day that 
you’ll be using the old accounting system — in other words, at exactly midnight 
on 12/31/2016 if you’re converting to QuickBooks on 1/1/2017.
If your old system is rather informal (perhaps it’s a shoebox full of receipts), or if 
it tracks only cash (perhaps you’ve been using Quicken), you need to do a bit more 
work:
»
» To get your cash balance: Reconcile your bank account or bank accounts  
(if you have more than one bank account) as of the conversion date.
»
» To get your accounts receivable balance: Tally all your unpaid customer 
invoices.
»
» To get your other asset account balances: Know what each asset originally 
costs. For depreciable fixed assets, you also need to provide any accumulated 
depreciation that has been claimed for that asset. (Accumulated depreciation is 
the total depreciation that you’ve already expensed for each asset.)
By the way, check out Appendix B if you have questions about accounting or 
accounting terminology, such as depreciation.
»
» To get your liability account balances: Know how much you owe on each 
liability. If you trust your creditors — the people to whom you owe the 
money — you may also be able to get this information from their statements.

20      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
You don’t need to worry about the owner’s equity accounts. QuickBooks can cal-
culate your owner’s equity account balances for you, based on the difference 
between your total assets and your total liabilities. This method is a bit sloppy, 
and accountants may not like it, but it’s a pretty good compromise. (If you do have 
detailed account balances for your owner’s equity accounts, use these figures — 
and know that you’re one in a million.)
If you’re using the slightly awkward way to convert to QuickBooks — in other 
words, if your conversion date is some date other than the beginning of the 
accounting year — you also need to provide year-to-date income and expense 
balances. To get your income, cost of goods sold, expenses, other income, and 
other expense account balances, you need to calculate the year-to-date amount of 
each account. If you can get this information from your old system, that’s super. 
If not, you need to get it manually. (If you suddenly have images of yourself sitting 
at your desk late at night, tapping away on a ten-key, you’re probably right. 
What’s more, you probably also need to allocate half of another Saturday to get-
ting QuickBooks up and running.)
Just for fun, I created the sample trial balance shown in Table  2-1. This table 
shows you what a trial balance looks like if you convert at some time other than at 
the beginning of the accounting year.

If you’re converting at the very beginning of the accounting year, your trial bal-

doesn’t have any year-to-date income or expense balances.

ABOUT THOSE DEBITS AND CREDITS
Don’t get freaked out about those debits and credits. You just need to keep them straight 
for a few minutes. Here’s the scoop: For assets and expenses, a debit balance is the same 
thing as a positive balance. So a cash debit balance of $5,000 means that you have 
$5,000 in your account, and $20,000 of cost of goods sold means that you incurred 
$20,000 of costs-of-goods expense. For assets and expenses, a credit balance is the same 
thing as a negative balance. So if you have a cash balance of –$5,000, your account is over-
drawn by $5,000. In the sample trial balance shown in Table 2-1, the accumulated depreci-
ation shows a credit balance of $2,000, which is, in effect, a negative account balance.
For liabilities, owner’s equity accounts, and income accounts, things are flip-flopped.  
A credit balance is the same thing as a positive balance. So an accounts payable credit 
balance of $2,000 means that you owe your creditors $2,000. A bank loan credit balance 
of $10,000 means that you owe the bank $10,000. And a sales account credit balance of 
$60,000 means that you’ve enjoyed $60,000 worth of sales.
I know that I keep saying this, but do remember that those income and expense 
account balances are year-to-date figures. They exist only if the conversion date occurs 
after the start of the financial year.

22      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
The mother of all scavenger hunts
Even after you decide when you want to convert to QuickBooks and you come up 
with a trial balance, you still need to collect a bunch of additional information. 
I list these items in laundry-list fashion. What you want to do is find all this stuff 
and then pile it up (neatly) in a big stack next to the computer:
»
» Last year’s federal tax return: QuickBooks asks which federal income tax 
form you use to file your tax return and also asks about your taxpayer 
identification number. Last year’s federal tax return is the easiest place to find 
this stuff.
»
» Copies of all your most recent state and federal payroll tax returns: If you  
prepare payroll for employees, QuickBooks wants to know about the federal 
and state payroll tax rates that you pay, as well as some other stuff.
»
» Copies of all the unpaid invoices that your customers (or clients or 
patients or whatever) owe you as of the conversion date: I guess this is 
probably obvious, but the total accounts receivable balance shown on your 
trial balance needs to match the total of the unpaid customer invoices.
»
» Copies of all unpaid bills that you owe your vendors as of the conversion 
date: Again, this is probably obvious, but the total accounts payable balance 
shown on your trial balance needs to match the total of the unpaid vendor bills.
»
» A detailed listing of any inventory items you’re holding for resale: This list 
should include not only inventory item descriptions and quantities, but also 
the initial purchase prices and the anticipated sales prices. In other words, if 
you sell porcelain wombats, and you have 1,200 of these beauties in inven-
tory, you need to know exactly what you paid for them.
»
» Copies of the previous year’s W-2 statements, W-4 statements for 
anybody you hired since the beginning of the previous year, detailed 
information about any payroll tax liabilities you owe as of the conver-
sion date, and detailed information about the payroll tax deposits you 
made since the beginning of the year: You need the information shown on 
these forms to adequately and accurately set up the QuickBooks payroll 
feature. I don’t want to scare you, but this is probably the most tedious part of 
setting up QuickBooks.
»
» If you’re retroactively converting as of the beginning of the year, you 
need a list of all the transactions that have occurred since the beginning 
of the year: sales, purchases, payroll transactions, and everything and 
anything else: If you do the right-way conversion retroactively, you need to 
re-enter each of these transactions into the new system. You actually enter the 
information after you complete the QuickBooks Setup process, which I describe 
later in this chapter, but you might as well get all this information together now, 
while you’re searching for the rest of the items for this scavenger hunt.

CHAPTER 2  The Big Setup      23
If you take the slightly awkward way, you don’t need to find the last item that I 
describe in the preceding list. You can just use the year-to-date income and 
expense numbers from the trial balance.
Stepping through QuickBooks Setup
After you decide when you want to convert, prepare a trial balance as of the con-
version date, and collect the additional raw data that you need, you’re ready to 
step through QuickBooks Setup. You need to start QuickBooks and then walk 
through the steps.
Starting QuickBooks
To start QuickBooks 2017  in Windows 10, click the QuickBooks 2017 tile on 
the  Windows Desktop. Or click the Windows Start button and then click the 
menu choice that leads to QuickBooks. (I choose Start ➪ All Apps ➪ QuickBooks ➪  
QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions 17.0.)
QuickBooks comes in several flavors. The most common flavors are
»
» QuickBooks Pro: The Pro version includes the job costing and time-estimating 
features, which I briefly describe in Chapter 16; it also includes the capability to 
share a QuickBooks file over a network, as I describe in Appendix C.
»
» QuickBooks Premier: The Premier version adds features to QuickBooks Pro 
and also comes in a variety of industry-specific flavors, including an 
Accountant edition that mimics most of these other flavors.
»
» QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions: This version is nearly identical to 
QuickBooks Premier but allows for very large QuickBooks files, including 
much larger customer, vendor, and employee lists.
I use the Accountant edition flavor of QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions, so some of 
the figures might differ a wee bit from what you see onscreen. But know this: 
Aside from minor cosmetic differences, the various versions of QuickBooks all 
work the same way. You can use this book for any of these program versions.
If you’ve started QuickBooks for the first time, QuickBooks first tells you how it 
plans to use your Internet connection to regularly update the QuickBooks soft-
ware. After you click the button that indicates “Okay, yeah, I’m good with that,” 
QuickBooks displays the No Company Open dialog box (not shown). Then you click 

24      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
the Create a New Company button so that QuickBooks displays the QuickBooks 
Setup dialog box with the message Let’s get your business set up quickly! 
(see Figure 2-1).
If you’ve been using an earlier version of QuickBooks, QuickBooks should prompt 
you to open (and possibly convert) an existing file — and you don’t need to be 
reading this chapter.
If you aren’t starting QuickBooks for the first time but want to step through 
QuickBooks Setup to set up a new company anyway, choose File ➪ New Company.
I should mention that the first QuickBooks Setup dialog box (the one shown in 
Figure 2-1) identifies some other setup options you can use to get started. The 
dialog box gives you the Detailed Start option, for example, which lets you control 
the setup and fine-tune the company file. The dialog box also gives you the option 
to create a new file from an old file. It also suggests that you might want to 
upgrade from Quicken or some other accounting system. (Basically, that upgrade 
means that you want QuickBooks to try using your existing accounting system’s 
data as a starting point.)
Two simple bits of advice: Don’t fiddle with Detailed Setup unless you’re an 
accounting expert, and don’t attempt to “upgrade” Quicken or some other 
accounting program’s data. It’s just as easy and usually considerably cleaner to 
work from a trial balance.
FIGURE 2-1: 
The first 
QuickBooks 
Setup window.

CHAPTER 2  The Big Setup      25
The one group of new QuickBooks users who probably should try upgrading their 
old accounting system’s data are people who’ve done a really good job of keeping 
their books with the old system, including complete balance sheet information. 
No offense, but you probably aren’t in this category. Sorry.
Using the Express Setup
QuickBooks 2017 provides you a very fast setup process compared with other 
accounting software programs and even with old versions of the QuickBooks soft-
ware. Basically, you fill in some boxes and click some buttons, and voilà — you’ve 
largely set up QuickBooks. Because I can give you some tips, identify some short-
cuts, and warn you of some traps to avoid, I’m providing these step-by-step 
instructions:
1.	 In the first QuickBooks Setup dialog box (refer to Figure 2-1), choose 
Express Setup.
With the first QuickBooks Setup dialog box displayed, click the Express Start 
button. QuickBooks displays the Glad You’re Here! dialog box, shown in 
Figure 2-2.
FIGURE 2-2: 
The Glad You’re 
Here! dialog box.

26      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
2.	 Specify the business name.
The name you specify goes on QuickBooks reports and appears on invoices 
you send customers. Accordingly, you want to use your “real” business name. 
If your business is incorporated or formed as a limited liability company (LLC), 
you want to use the right suffix or acronym in your name. Don’t use Acme 
Supplies, for example, but Acme Supplies Inc. or Acme Supplies LLC.
Note: QuickBooks also uses the company name for the QuickBooks data file.
3.	 Identify your industry.
If you’re in the construction business, for example, type construction. When 
you type something in the Industry field, QuickBooks turns the box into a 
drop-down menu showing the industries that it recognizes. You can pick an 
industry from this menu (or pick the industry that’s closest to your business).
Be thoughtful and cautious about the industry you specify. QuickBooks sets up 
a starting chart of accounts for you based on the industry. A chart of accounts 
lists the asset, liability, income, and expense accounts (or categories) that 
QuickBooks will use to categorize your business’s finances.
4.	 Identify the tax return you file.
Use the Business Type field to specify the tax return that your business files. 
You can click that field and then make a choice from the menu that 
QuickBooks provides.
The QuickBooks menu of tax return options includes only two options for LLCs: 
single-member LLCs that file their taxes with the LLC owner’s 1040 tax return, 
and multiple-member LLCs that file their taxes as a partnership by using a 
1065 tax return. An LLC can also file its taxes as an S corporation or regular C 
corporation, however (part of the reason accountants love LLCs). If you’re 
running an LLC that files its taxes as an S corporation, do select the S corpora-
tion tax return option. And if you’re running an LLC that files as a regular C 
corporation, select that tax return option.
5.	 Provide your Employer Identification Number.
Use the Employer Identification Number (EIN) field to provide your business 
taxpayer identification number. If you’re a sole proprietorship without 
employees, your tax identification number may be your Social Security 
number. In all other cases, your taxpayer identification number is your 
Employer Identification Number.
6.	 Provide your business address information.
Use the Business Address fields to provide your firm’s address and contact 
information. I hope you don’t feel cheated that I’m not giving you instructions 
like “Enter your street address in the Address box” and “Please remember that 
your telephone number goes in the Phone box.”

CHAPTER 2  The Big Setup      27
If you ever decide that you want to change some piece of information that you 
entered on a previous page of the QuickBooks Setup dialog box, you can just 
click the Back button to back up.
If you’re an observant person, you may have noticed the Preview Your Settings 
button that appears on the Glad You’re Here! dialog box. You can safely ignore 
this button, but if you’re a truly curious cat, go ahead and click it. QuickBooks 
displays the dialog box shown in Figure 2-3, which identifies the standard 
QuickBooks features that the QuickBooks Setup process is turning on, as well 
as the asset, liability, income, and expense accounts that will initially appear in 
your chart of accounts. Oh, one other thing: The Preview Your Company 
Settings dialog box also provides a Company File Location tab that identifies 
where your QuickBooks data file will be located.
7.	 Create the QuickBooks data file.
After you provide the business contact information requested by QuickBooks, 
click the Create Company button. QuickBooks may display the QuickSetup 
dialog box, shown in Figure 2-4, which lets you name and specify the location 
of the company file. You can use the QuickSetup dialog box to make these 
changes or — my recommendation — simply let QuickBooks be QuickBooks 
and make these decisions for you. After you click Save, QuickBooks creates the 
data file it will use to store your financial information. (In some versions of 
QuickBooks, creating the file takes a few minutes.)
When QuickBooks finishes creating your file, it displays the Get All the Details 
into QuickBooks dialog box, shown in Figure 2-5.
FIGURE 2-3: 
The Preview Your 
Company Settings 
dialog box.

8.	 Identify your customers, vendors, and employees.
With the Get All the Details into QuickBooks dialog box displayed, click the Add 
the People You Do Business With button. QuickBooks displays another dialog 
box that asks, “Perchance, are contact names and addresses stored electroni-
cally someplace else, like Microsoft Outlook or Google Gmail?”
•	 If you do have contact name and address information stored someplace else 
that QuickBooks will retrieve: Click the appropriate button and follow the 
onscreen instructions.

•	 Otherwise: Click the Paste from Excel or Enter Manually button and then 
click Continue.
When QuickBooks displays the Add the People You Do Business With dialog box, 
shown in Figure 2-6, use the rows of the displayed worksheet to describe your 
customers, vendors, and employees. To enter a contact into the next empty row:
(a)	 Select the Customer, Vendor, or Employee option button (as appropriate).
(b)	 Describe the contact using the fields provided: Name, Company Name,  
First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, and so forth. Each contact goes in 
its own row.
(c)	 Click the Continue button twice when you finish identifying your contacts to 
return to the Get All the Details into QuickBooks dialog box.
In the first Name column, which is used for customers and vendors, provide an 
abbreviated name or a nickname for a contact. You’ll use what you specify in 
the Name column within QuickBooks to refer to the contact, so you want to 
use something short and sweet. If you’re working with customer John Smith at 
IBM Corp., you might enter IBM in the Name column, IBM Corporation in the 
Company Name column, John in the First Name column, and so on.
FIGURE 2-6:

30      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
If you add any customers or vendors, after you click the Continue button to 
leave the Add the People You Do Business With dialog box, QuickBooks asks 
about open balances that customers owe you or that you owe vendors. You 
don’t need to worry about these open balances at this point of the setup 
process. I describe how to cleanly and correctly deal with open customer and 
vendor balances in Chapter 3.
9.	 Identify the items (the stuff) you sell.
With the Get All the Details into QuickBooks dialog box displayed (refer to 
Figure 2-5), click the Add the Products and Services You Sell button. 
QuickBooks displays another dialog box that asks what kind of stuff you want 
to describe: services, stuff that you track in inventory, stuff that is inventory but 
that you don’t track, and so on. (Which items QuickBooks lists depends on the 
industry that you specify in Step 3.) Click the appropriate button.
When QuickBooks displays the Add the Products and Services You Sell dialog 
box, shown in Figure 2-7, use the rows of the displayed worksheet to describe 
a product or service. For any item, you’ll always enter a name, description, and 
price. For some items, however, you can specify much greater detail than just 
this skeletal information. Click the Continue button when you finish identifying 
your products and services. QuickBooks may try to sell you some extra stuff 
(such as Intuit checks), but feel free to click No Thanks to return to the Get All 
the Details into QuickBooks dialog box.
FIGURE 2-7:

CHAPTER 2  The Big Setup      31
10.	Describe your bank account(s).
With the Get All the Details into QuickBooks dialog box displayed (refer to 
Figure 2-5), click the Add Your Bank Accounts button. When QuickBooks 
displays the Add Your Bank Accounts dialog box, shown in Figure 2-8, use the 
worksheet to describe each bank account you use for your business: its name, 
account number, balance at the conversion date, and the actual conversion 
date. Click the Continue button when you finish identifying your bank accounts 
to return to the Get All the Details into QuickBooks dialog box.
11.	Start working with QuickBooks.
With the Get All the Details into QuickBooks dialog box displayed, click the Start 
Working button. QuickBooks displays the QuickBooks program window. You’re 
done.
If you didn’t register during the installation process, at some point after Quick-
Books starts, you see a message box that asks whether you want to register Quick-
Books. If you don’t register, you can use the product roughly a few times, and 
then — whammo! — the program locks up, and you can no longer access your 
files. Either you register it, or you can’t use it. I don’t like being forced to do 
something, but getting worked up about having to register QuickBooks is a waste 
of time.

The simplest option is to just register when you see that message. Here’s how: 
When QuickBooks displays the message box that asks whether you want to regis-
ter, click the Online button to register online, or click the Phone button to register 
over the phone. If you go with the Phone option, QuickBooks displays another 
dialog box that gives you a telephone number to call and provides a space for you 
to enter your registration number.
The Rest of the Story
In the preceding paragraphs of this chapter, I describe how you prepare for and 
then step through the QuickBooks Setup process. When QuickBooks Setup is over, 
though, you need to take care of three other little jobs:
»
» You need to describe in detail your inventory, your customer receivables, and 
(if you chose to track vendor bills you owe) your vendor payables.
»
» You need to describe your current business finances, including any year-to- 
date revenue and year-to-date expenses that aren’t recorded as part of 
getting your customer receivables and vendor payables entered into 
QuickBooks.
»
» If you want to use accrual-basis accounting, you need to make an adjustment.
These chores aren’t time-consuming, but they’re the three most complicated 
tasks that you need to do to set up QuickBooks. (If you aren’t sure what the big 
deal is about accrual-basis accounting, I respectfully suggest that you take a break 
here and read Appendix B.)
To set up the inventory records, you just identify the item counts you hold in 
inventory, as described in Chapter 3.
To set up your customer receivables and (if necessary) vendor payables, you first 
need to enter customer invoices that were prepared before the conversion date but 
that are still uncollected at conversion, as described in Chapter 4. Similarly, you 
may need to enter vendor payables that were incurred prior to the conversion date 
but that are still unpaid at conversion.
I talk about this stuff more in Chapter 3, so if you’re still okay with doing some 
more installation and setup work, go ahead and flip there. However . . .

CHAPTER 2  The Big Setup      33
Should You Get Your Accountant’s Help?
So should you get help from your accountant? Oh, shoot, I don’t know. If you fol-
low my directions carefully (both in this chapter and the next), and your business 
financial affairs aren’t wildly complex, I think you can probably figure out all this 
stuff on your own.
Having said that, however, I suggest that you at least think about getting your 
accountant’s help at this juncture. Your accountant can do a much better job of 
giving you advice that may be specific to your situation. In many cases, your 
accountant can give you beginning trial balance amounts that agree with your tax 
returns. He or she probably knows your business and can keep you from making a 
terrible mess of things, just in case you don’t follow my directions carefully.
Just so you know: One of the things that I (as a CPA) do for my clients is help them 
set up QuickBooks. Because I do this, I can give you a couple of pieces of useful 
information about getting a CPA’s help in setting up:
»
» Your CPA (assuming that he or she already knows QuickBooks) should be able 
to help you through the setup process in a couple of hours in most cases, so 
he or she can do it (or help you do it) much faster than you can on your own.
»
» Another (a third) hour or so of tutoring from your CPA should mean that you 
get enough help to record all your usual transactions.
With just this help, you can find out how to pay your bills, invoice customers 
exactly the way you want, and produce reports. I used to pooh-pooh this kind of 
hand-holding, but the older (and, I hope, wiser) I get, the more I see that business 
owners and bookkeepers benefit from this up-front help. A bit of planning and 
expert advice in the beginning can save you a whole lot of trouble later.

Q
uickBooks Setup (which I discuss at some length in Chapter 2) doesn’t 
actually get QuickBooks completely ready to use. You also need to enter 
additional information about your products, employees, customers, and 
vendors (and a handful of other items) into lists. In this chapter, I describe how 
you create and work with these lists. I also describe how you clean up some of the 
accounting messiness created when you enter information into these lists.
The Magic and Mystery of Items
The first QuickBooks list you need to finish setting up is the Item list — the list of 
stuff you buy and sell. Before you start adding to your Item list, however, I need 
to tell you that QuickBooks isn’t very smart about its view of what you buy and 
sell. It thinks that anything you stick on a sales invoice or a purchase order is 
something you’re selling.
Chapter 3

36      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
If you sell colorful coffee mugs, for example, you probably figure (and correctly 
so) that you need to add descriptions of each of these items to the Item list. If you 
add freight charges to an invoice, however, QuickBooks thinks that you’re adding 
another mug. And if you add sales tax to an invoice, well, guess what? QuickBooks 
again thinks that you’re adding another mug.
This wacky definition of items is confusing at first. But just remember one thing, 
and you’ll be okay. You aren’t the one who’s stupid: QuickBooks is. No, I’m not 
saying that QuickBooks is a bad program. It’s a wonderful accounting program 
and a great tool. What I’m saying is that QuickBooks is only a dumb computer 
program; it isn’t an artificial-intelligence program. It doesn’t pick up on the little 
subtleties of business — such as the fact that even though you charge customers 
for freight, you aren’t really in the shipping business.
Each entry in the invoice or purchase order — the mugs that you sell, the subtotal, 
the discount, the freight charges, and the sales tax — is an item. Yes, I know this 
setup is weird, but getting used to the wackiness now makes the discussions that 
follow much easier to understand.
If you want to see a sample invoice, take a peek at Figure 3-1.
FIGURE 3-1: 
A sample 
QuickBooks 
invoice.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      37
Do you see those first three items: rainbow mugs, yellow mugs, and blue mugs? 
You can see the sense of calling them items, right? These mugs are things that 
you sell.
But then suppose that you give frequent buyers of your merchandise a 10 percent 
discount. To include this discount in your accounting, you need to add a Subtotal 
item to tally the sale and then a Discount item to calculate the discount. Figure 3-1 
also shows them. See them? Kind of weird, eh?
Then look at the Shipping item, which charges the customer $50 for freight. Yep, 
that’s right — another item. In sum, everything that appears on an invoice or a 
purchase order is an item that you need to describe in your Item list.
Just above the invoice total, if you look closely, you can see another item for 
including sales tax on your invoices — and that’s really an item, too.
I describe creating invoices in Chapter  4 and creating purchase orders in 
Chapter 7.
Adding items you might include on invoices
You may have added some items as part of QuickBooks Setup, but you’ll want to 
know how to add any other needed items and how to add new items. To add invoice 
or purchase order items to the Item list, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Lists ➪ Item List.
If QuickBooks asks whether you want to set up multiple items, indicate “No 
way, man.” QuickBooks then displays the Item List window, as shown in 
Figure 3-2.
If QuickBooks asks whether you want to add multiple items at one time, you 
can also reply, “Why, yes, thank you very much.” Then QuickBooks displays a 
worksheet like the one used during the QuickBooks Setup process (I describe it 
in Chapter 2), which you can use to set up multiple items in one fell swoop. You 
can choose to set up multiple items in one fell swoop, by the way, by clicking 
the Item button at the bottom of the list window and then selecting Add/Edit 
Multiple Items from the drop-down list.
2.	 Click the Item button at the bottom of the Item List window and then 
select New from the drop-down list.
QuickBooks displays the New Item window, as shown in Figure 3-3.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      39
3.	 Categorize the item.
Select an item type from the Type drop-down list. The Item list that you see 
depends on the type of business you told QuickBooks you were in when you 
set up the program, so use the following as a sample; the amount and type of 
items that you need depend on the business you’re in. Select one of the 
following item types by clicking its name in the list:
•	 Service: Select this type if you charge for a service, such as an hour of labor 
or a repair job.
•	 Inventory Part: Select this type if what you sell is something that you buy 
from someone else, and you want to track your holdings of the item. If you 
sell thingamajigs that you purchase from manufacturer Thingamajigs 
Amalgamated, for example, you specify the item type as Inventory Part. (For 
more information on using QuickBooks to track inventory, see Chapter 7.)
•	 Inventory Assembly: Select this type if what you sell is something that you 
make from other Inventory items. In other words, if you buy raw materials 
or other components and then assemble these things to create your 
finished product, the finished product is an Inventory Assembly item.
•	 Non-Inventory Part: Select this type if what you sell is something that you 
don’t want to track as inventory. (You usually don’t use this item type for 
products that you sell, by the way. Instead, you use it for items that you 
buy for the business and need to include in purchase orders.)
•	 Other Charge: Select this item type for things such as freight and handling 
charges that you include in invoices.
•	 Subtotal: This item type adds everything before you subtract any discount, 
add the sales tax, and so on.
•	 Group: Use this item type to enter a bunch of items (which are already on 
the list) at one time. This item is a nice timesaver. If you commonly sell 
sets of items, for example, you don’t have to specify those items individu-
ally every time you write an invoice.
•	 Discount: This item type calculates an amount to be subtracted from a 
subtotal.
•	 Payment: This option is wacky. If your invoice sometimes includes an entry 
that reduces the invoice total — customer deposits at the time of sale, for 
example — select this item type. However, if this item type confuses you, 
just ignore it.
•	 Sales Tax Item: Select this item type for the sales tax that you include in the 
invoice.
•	 Sales Tax Group: This item type is similar to the Group item type, but you 
use it only for sales taxes that are collected in one transaction and owed to 
multiple agencies.

40      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
4.	 Type an item number or name.
Press the Tab key or use your mouse to click the Item Name/Number text box 
below the Type drop-down list; then type a short description of the item.
5.	 (Optional) Make the item a subitem.
If you want to work with subitems — items that appear within other items — 
select the Subitem Of check box and use the corresponding drop-down list to 
specify the parent item to which a subitem belongs.
If you set up a parent item for coffee mugs and subitems for blue, yellow, and 
rainbow mugs, for example, you can produce reports that show parent items 
(such as mugs) and subitems (such as the different-colored mugs). Subitems 
are just an extra complexity, so if you’re new to this QuickBooks stuff, I suggest 
that you keep things simple by avoiding them.
6.	 Describe the item in more detail.
Move the cursor to the Description text box, and type a description. This 
description then appears in the invoice. Note that if you specified the item type 
as Inventory Part in Step 3, you see two description text boxes: Description on 
Purchase Transactions and Description on Sales Transactions. The purchase 
description appears in purchase orders, and the sales description appears in 
sales invoices.
7.	 If the item type is Service, Non-Inventory Part, or Other Charge, tell 
QuickBooks how much to charge for the item, whether the item is 
subject to sales tax, and which income account to use for tracking the 
income that you receive from selling the item.
•	 For a Service type, use the Rate text box to specify the price you charge for 
one unit of the service. If you charge by the hour, for example, the rate is 
the charge for an hour of service. If you charge for a job, such as a repair job 
or the completion of a specific task, the rate is the charge for the job or task.
•	 For a Non-Inventory Part type, use the Price text box to specify the amount 
you charge for the item.
•	 For an Other Charge type, use the Amount or % text box, which replaces the 
Rate text box, to specify the amount you charge for the item. You can type an 
amount, such as 20 for $20.00, or you can type a percentage. If you type a 
percentage, QuickBooks calculates the Other Charge Amount as the percent-
age multiplied by the preceding item shown on the invoice. (You usually put in 
an Other Charge after using a Subtotal item — something I talk about in the 
“Creating other wacky items for invoices” section later in this chapter.)
•	 For all three types, use the Tax Code drop-down list to indicate whether the 
item is taxed. (Note that the Tax Code field appears only if you told 
QuickBooks in QuickBooks Setup that you charge customers sales tax.)

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      41
•	 For all three types, use the Account drop-down list to specify which income 
account you want to use to track the income that you receive from the sale 
of this item.
8.	 If the item type is Inventory Part, tell QuickBooks how much to charge 
for the inventory part, how much the inventory part costs, and which 
income account to use for tracking the product sales income.
For an Inventory Part item type, QuickBooks displays the New Item window 
shown in Figure 3-4. You use the extra fields that this special version of the 
window displays to record the following information:
•	 Description on Purchase Transactions: Describe the part. This description 
appears in the documents (such as purchase orders) that you use when 
you buy items for your inventory.
•	 Cost: Specify the average cost per unit of the items that you currently have. 
This field acts as the default rate when you enter the item in a purchase 
transaction.
•	 COGS Account: Specify the account that you want QuickBooks to use for 
tracking this item’s cost when you sell it. (QuickBooks suggests the COGS, 
or cost of goods sold, account. If you’ve created other accounts for your 
COGS, select the appropriate account.)
•	 Preferred Vendor: Specify your first choice when ordering the item for your 
business. (If the vendor isn’t in your Vendor list, QuickBooks asks you to 
add it. If you say, “Yeah, I do want to add it,” QuickBooks displays the Add 
Vendor window, which you can use to describe the vendor.)
•	 Description on Sales Transactions: Type a description of the item that you 
want to appear in documents (invoices and so on) that your customers see. 
QuickBooks suggests the same description that you used in the 
Description on Purchase Transactions text box as a default.
•	 Sales Price: Enter the amount that you charge for the item.
•	 Tax Code: Indicate whether the item is taxed.
•	 Income Account: Specify the account that you want QuickBooks to use for 
tracking the income from the sale of the part. This is probably the 
Merchandise Income or Sales account. You typically use the Merchandise 
Income account to track wholesale (nontaxable) sales and the Sales 
account to track retail (taxable) sales.
•	 Asset Account: Specify the other current asset account that you want 
QuickBooks to use for tracking this Inventory item’s value.
•	 Reorder Point: Specify the lowest inventory quantity of this item that can 
remain before you order more. When the inventory level drops to this 

42      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
quantity, QuickBooks adds a reminder to the Reminders list, notifying you 
that you need to reorder the item. (To see the Reminders list, choose 
Edit ➪ Preferences, select Reminders, and then select the Show Reminders 
List When Opening Company File box on the My Preferences tab.)
•	 On Hand: If you’re setting up an item for the first time as part of setting up 
QuickBooks, set this field to the physical count for the item at the conver-
sion date. Otherwise, leave this field set to zero.
•	 Total Value: Leave this field set to zero too.
•	 As Of: Enter the current date.
9.	 If the item type is Inventory Assembly, tell QuickBooks which COGS and 
income account to use for tracking the item, how much to charge for the 
inventory assembly, and how to build the item from other component 
Inventory items.
Note: The Inventory Assembly item is available in QuickBooks Premier and 
Enterprise but not in Simple Start or QuickBooks Pro.
For an Inventory Assembly item type, QuickBooks displays the New Item 
window. You use the extra fields that this special version of the window 
displays to record the following information:
FIGURE 3-4: 
The QuickBooks 
New Item window 
with the 
Inventory Part 
item type 
selected.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      43
•	 COGS Account: Specify the account that you want QuickBooks to use for 
tracking this item’s cost when you sell it. (QuickBooks suggests the COGS 
account. If you’ve created other accounts for your COGS, select the 
appropriate account.)
•	 Description: Type a description of the item that you want to appear in 
documents that your customers see, such as invoices.
•	 Sales Price: Enter the amount that you charge for the item.
•	 Tax Code: Indicate whether the item is taxed.
•	 Income Account: Specify the account that you want QuickBooks to use for 
tracking the income from the sale of the part. This is probably the 
Merchandise Sales or Sales Income account. You typically use the 
Merchandise Sales account to track sales of tangible items (merchandise, 
in other words) and the Sales Income account to track anything else.
•	 Bill of Materials: Use the Bill of Materials list to identify the component 
items and the quantities needed to make the inventory assembly.
•	 Asset Account: Specify the other current asset account that you want 
QuickBooks to use for tracking this Inventory item’s value.
•	 Build Point: Specify the lowest inventory quantity of this item that can 
remain before you manufacture more. When the inventory level drops to 
this quantity, QuickBooks adds a reminder to the Reminders list, notifying 
you that you need to make more of the item.
•	 On Hand: If you’re setting up an item for the first time as part of setting up 
QuickBooks, set this field to the physical count for the item at the conver-
sion date. Otherwise, leave this field set to zero.
•	 Total Value: If you enter a value other than zero in the On Hand field, set 
the total value amount as the cost of the items you’re holding. Otherwise, 
leave this field set to zero.
•	 As Of: Enter the conversion date in the As Of text box if you’re describing 
some item as part of getting QuickBooks set up. Otherwise, enter the 
current date.
10.	If the item type is Sales Tax Item, tell QuickBooks what sales tax rate to 
charge and what government agency to pay.
Note: The Sales Tax Item version of the New Item window looks a little 
different from the window shown in Figure 3-4. This stuff is straightforward, 
though. Enter the sales tax rate in the appropriate box and the state (or the city 
or other tax agency name) in the appropriate box:
•	 Sales Tax Name and Description: Specify further details for later 
identification.

44      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
•	 Tax Rate: Specify the sales tax rate as a percentage.
•	 Tax Agency: Name the state or local tax agency that collects all the loot that 
you remit. If the tax agency isn’t in the list, you can add it by selecting Add 
New from the drop-down list.
11.	If the item type is Payment, describe the payment method and how you 
want QuickBooks to handle the payment.
You use payment items to record a down payment made when the invoice is 
created to reduce the final balance due from the customer later. Note: 
Retainers and advance deposits are handled differently.
The Payment version of the New Item window looks a little different from the 
window shown in Figure 3-4.
Use the Payment Method drop-down list to specify the method of payment for 
a payment. QuickBooks provides a starting list of several of the usual payment 
methods. You can easily add more payment types by choosing Add New from 
the drop-down list. When you choose this entry, QuickBooks displays the New 
Payment Method dialog box. In the dialog box’s only text box, identify the 
payment method: cows, beads, shells, or some other what-have-you.
When you’re finished, use the area in the lower-left corner of the New Item 
window to group the payment with other undeposited funds or, if you use the 
drop-down list, deposit the payment to a specific account.
12.	Click OK or Next when you’re finished.
When you finish describing one item, click OK to add the item to the list and 
return to the Item List window. Click Next to add the item to the list and keep 
the New Item window onscreen so that you can add more items.
13.	If you added a new Inventory item, record the purchase of the item.
After you finish describing any new Inventory items, you need to make another 
transaction to categorize the purchase of the items (unless they just showed 
up one morning on your doorstep). For an explanation of these transactions, 
turn to Chapter 7.
Creating other wacky items for invoices
In the preceding section, I don’t describe all the items that you can add. You can 
create a Subtotal item to calculate the subtotal of the items you list in an invoice, 
for example. (You usually need this subtotal when you want to calculate sales tax 
on the invoice’s items.) You might want to create other wacky items for your 
invoices as well, such as discounts. I describe these special types of items in the 
next few sections.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      45
Creating Subtotal items to stick subtotals  
on invoices
You need to add a Subtotal item if you ever want to apply a discount to a series of 
items on an invoice. (I show a Subtotal item in the invoice shown in Figure 3-1 
earlier in this chapter.) To add a Subtotal item to your Item list, choose Lists ➪ Item 
List, click the Item button, and select New from the drop-down list. This action 
displays the New Item window — the same window I show several times earlier in 
this chapter. Specify the item type as Subtotal and then provide an item name 
(such as Subtotal).
When you want to subtotal items in an invoice, all you do is stick this Subtotal 
item in the invoice after the items you want to subtotal. Keep in mind, though, 
that QuickBooks doesn’t set up a subtotal feature automatically. You have to add a 
Subtotal item; otherwise, you can create and apply a Discount item only to the 
single item that immediately precedes the discount. A Discount item, by the way, 
calculates a discount on an invoice.
Creating Group items to batch stuff  
you sell together
You can create an item that puts one line on an invoice that’s actually a combina-
tion of several other items. To add a Group item, display the New Item window 
and specify the item type as Group. QuickBooks displays the New Item window, as 
shown in Figure 3-5.
USING MULTIPLE UNITS OF MEASUREMENT
If you buy and sell items of inventory with the same measurement units — suppose 
that you both buy and sell individual coffee mugs — you use a single unit of measure for 
your purchases and sales. Some businesses, however, use multiple units of measure-
ment. Suppose that a business purchases boxes of coffee mugs, at 24 mugs to the box, 
but then sells those coffee mugs singly. In this case, purchases of an item would proba-
bly be counted in boxes (one measurement unit). Yet sales of the item would probably 
be counted as individual mugs (another measurement unit). To deal with this complex-
ity, where appropriate, the New Item dialog boxes include an Enable button. (Refer to 
Figures 3-3 and 3-4.) Click the Enable button, and QuickBooks starts a little wizard that 
steps you through identifying the units of measure you need to use and telling 
QuickBooks how to convert from one unit of measure to another.

46      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
If you sell three items  — say, blue mugs, yellow mugs, and red mugs  — but 
sometimes sell the items together in a set, you can create an item that groups the 
three items. Note that when you create a group, you continue to track the group 
member inventories individually and don’t track the inventory of the group as a 
new item.
In the New Item window, use the Item/Description/Qty list box to list each item 
included in the group. When you click an item line in the Item/Description/Qty list 
box, QuickBooks places a down arrow at the right end of the Item column. Click 
this arrow to open a drop-down list of items. (If the list is longer than can be 
shown, you can use the scroll bar on the right to move up and down the list.) If you 
select the Print Items in Group check box, QuickBooks lists all the items in the 
group in invoices. (In the case of the mugs, invoices list the individual blue, red, 
and yellow mugs instead of listing the group name, such as Mug Set.)
Creating Discount items to add discounts  
to invoices
You can create an item that calculates a discount and sticks the discount in an 
invoice as another line item. (I show a Discount item in the invoice that appears in 
Figure 3-1.) To add a Discount item to the list, display the New Item window, specify 
the item type as Discount, and provide an item name or number and a description.
FIGURE 3-5: 
The QuickBooks 
New Item window 
with the item 
type Group 
selected.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      47
Use the Amount or % text box to specify how the discount is calculated. If the 
discount is a set amount (such as $50.00), type the amount. If the discount is cal-
culated as a percentage, enter the percentage, including the percent symbol. When 
you enter a percentage, QuickBooks calculates the discount amount as the per-
centage multiplied by the preceding item shown in the invoice. (If you want to 
apply the discount to a group of items, you need to use a Subtotal item and follow 
it with the discount, as Figure 3-1 shows.)
Use the Account drop-down list to specify the expense account that you want to 
use to track the cost of the discounts you offer.
Use the Tax Code drop-down list to specify whether the discount gets calculated 
before or after any sales taxes are calculated. (This option appears only if you 
indicated during QuickBooks Setup that you charge sales tax.)
You probably want to check with your local sales tax revenue agency to determine 
whether sales tax should be calculated before or after the discount.
If you need to collect sales tax, and you didn’t set up this function in QuickBooks 
Setup, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Edit ➪ Preferences.
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2.	 Click the Sales Tax icon in the list on the left, click the Company 
Preferences tab, and then select the Yes option button in the Do You 
Charge Sales Tax area.
3.	 Add the Sales Tax item(s) to your Item list.
4.	 Click the Add Sales Tax Item button.
When QuickBooks displays the New Item dialog box (not shown) enter a name 
for the sales tax in the Sales Tax Name box, the sales tax rate in the Tax Rate 
box, and the state agency to which you remit the sales tax in the Tax Agency 
box. Click OK twice when you’ve done this to close the New Item dialog box 
and the Preferences dialog box.
Creating Sales Tax Group items to  
batch sales taxes
Sales Tax Groups enable you to batch several sales taxes that you’re supposed to 
charge as one tax so that they appear as a single sales tax in the invoice. Combin-
ing the taxes is necessary  — or at least possible  — when you’re supposed to 
charge, say, a 6.5 percent state sales tax, a 1.7 percent county sales tax, and a 

48      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
0.4 percent city sales tax, but you want to show one all-encompassing 8.6 percent 
sales tax in the invoice.
To add a Sales Tax Group item, display the New Item window and then specify the 
item type as Sales Tax Group. QuickBooks displays the New Item window, as shown 
in Figure 3-6. Use the Tax Item/Rate/Tax Agency/Description list box to list the 
other sales tax items that you want to include in the group. When you click an item 
line in the list box, QuickBooks places a down arrow at the right end of the Tax 
Item column. You can click this arrow to open a drop-down list of Sales Tax items.
Editing items
If you make a mistake, you can change any piece of item information by display-
ing the Item List window and double-clicking the item so that QuickBooks dis-
plays the Edit Item window, which you can use to make changes.
The Item List window provides another tool you can use to enter subsequent, 
similar items, the Duplicate Item command. To use this command, select the item 
you want to copy and then choose the command. QuickBooks duplicates the 
selected item and then displays the New Item window. Make whatever changes 
you want and click Save.
FIGURE 3-6: 
The New Item 
window for the 
item type Sales 
Tax Group.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      49
The Item List window also provides a tool you can use to add and edit item infor-
mation. If you click the Item button and choose the Add/Edit Multiple Items com-
mand, QuickBooks displays the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries window. This 
window provides a spreadsheet you can use to add or edit more than one item at a 
time. The method I describe in the previous paragraphs often works best because 
it allows you to collect more information — information such as item descrip-
tions. But if you need to enter or edit a large number of items, check out the Add/
Edit Multiple Items command. Sometimes, that command saves you time.
Adding Employees to Your Employee List
If you do payroll in QuickBooks, or if you track sales by employees, you need to 
describe each employee. Describing employees is pretty darn easy. Choose the 
Employees ➪ Employee Center command to display the Employee Center window. 
Then click the New Employee button that appears just above the list in the top-left 
corner of the screen to have QuickBooks display the New Employee window. 
­Figure 3-7 shows the Personal tab of this window.
FIGURE 3-7:

Employee 
window.

50      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
The New Employee window is pretty straightforward, right? You just fill in the 
fields to describe the employee.
Lesser computer-book writers probably would provide step-by-step descriptions 
of how you move the cursor to the First Name text box and type the person’s first 
name, how you move the cursor to the next text box, type something there, and so 
on. Not me. No way. I know that you can tell just by looking at this window that 
all you do is click a text box and type the obvious bit of information. Right?
I do need to tell you a couple of important things about the New Employee 
window:
»
» When you release an employee, it’s important to enter the release date for the 
employee on the Employment Info tab after you write that final paycheck. (To 
change to a new tab, click the tab’s name. Click Employment Info to display 
the Employment Info tab, for example.) This way, when you process payroll in 
the future, you can’t accidentally pay the former employee.
»
» As for the Type field option on the Employment Info tab, most employees 
probably fit the regular category. If you’re uncertain whether an employee fits 
the guidelines for corporate officer, statutory employee, or owner, see the 
Circular E publication from the IRS. And sleep tight.
The Address & Contact tab provides boxes for you to collect and store address 
information. The Additional Info tab enables you to create customizable fields in 
case you want to keep information that isn’t covered by the QuickBooks default 
fields — favorite color and that type of thing. Again, what you need to do on this 
tab is fairly straightforward.
By the way, if you told QuickBooks that you want to do payroll, QuickBooks 
prompts you to enter the information it needs to calculate things like federal and 
state income taxes, payroll taxes, and vacation pay using boxes and buttons that 
appear on the Payroll Info and Worker’s Comp tabs.
After you finish describing an employee, click OK to add the employee to the list 
and return to the Employee List window, or click Next to add the employee to the 
list and add more employees.
You can also inactivate an employee from your list if the list starts to get cluttered 
with names of employees who no longer work for you. Read about inactivating 
items, employees, customers, and vendors in the nearby “Inactivating list items” 
sidebar. I recommend waiting to inactivate former employees until after the year 
is finished and the W-2 forms have been printed.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      51
Customers Are Your Business
Here’s how you add customers to your Customer list:
1.	 Choose Customers ➪ Customer Center.
The Customer Center window appears.
2.	 Click the New Customer & Job button and then click New Customer.
QuickBooks displays the Address Info tab of the New Customer window, as 
shown in Figure 3-8. Use this window to describe the customer in as much 
detail as possible.
If you click the New Customer & Job button and choose the Add Multiple 
Customers: Jobs command, QuickBooks displays a worksheet you can use to 
describe multiple customers at a time.
3.	 Type the customer’s name.
Enter the name of the customer as you want it to appear in the Customer list. 
Note that this is the name that you use to refer to the customer within 
QuickBooks, so you can abbreviate or shorten the name if you want. If IBM 
Corp. is your customer, for example, you might enter only IBM in the Customer 
Name text box.
INACTIVATING LIST ITEMS
One neat feature of QuickBooks enables you to simplify your lists by hiding items that 
are no longer active, including those that you expect to be active again later. If you have 
seasonal employees, you can hide them from your Employee list during the times of the 
year when they don’t work. Or if you sell commemorative key chains only every five 
years, you can keep them from cluttering your Item list in the off years. You can also 
inactivate customers and vendors from their respective lists.
To inactivate something from a list, all you have to do is open the list and double-click 
the item. When QuickBooks opens the item, employee, customer, or vendor that you 
want to inactivate, select the Item Is Inactive check box. (The name of the check box 
changes depending on what you’re trying to inactivate.) Then click OK. QuickBooks hides 
this member from your list. The next time you display the list, the Include Inactive box 
appears.
To view and edit hidden members of your list, just click the Include Inactive box. Any 
inactive members show up with X icons beside them. If you want to reactivate a 
member, all you have to do is click the X icon, and the member is reactivated.

4.	 Specify the total of the customer’s unpaid invoices by using the Opening 
Balance text box.
Move the cursor to the Opening Balance text box, and type the total amount 
owed by the customer on the conversion date.
QuickBooks suggests that you not enter a balance in the Opening Balance box 
as part of setting up QuickBooks. (If you’re interested in the logic of QuickBooks’ 
argument, you can view the Customers online tutorial, by choosing 
Help ➪ Learning Center Tutorials and then clicking the Add the People You Do 
Business With link.) I’ve thought long and hard about this, however, and I think 
that you want to enter the customer’s unpaid balance in the Opening Balance 
box. Doing this makes setting up QuickBooks correctly much easier.
5.	 Enter the current date in the As Of text box.
6.	 Enter the full company name in the Company Name text box.
7.	 (Optional) Enter the name of your contact, along with other pertinent 
information.
Move the cursor to the Full Name text boxes, and enter the customer contact 
person’s first name, middle initial, and last name. You can also enter the 
contact’s official position in the Job Title text box.
8.	 Provide telephone, fax, and email contact details.
Go ahead and fill in the telephone number, fax, website, and email text boxes.
FIGURE 3-8:

window.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      53
9.	Enter the billing address.
You can use the Invoice/Bill To text box to provide the customer’s billing 
address. QuickBooks copies the Company and Contact names to the first lines 
of the billing address, so you need to enter only the address. To move from the 
end of one line to the start of the next, press Enter.
10.	Enter the shipping address.
You can use the Ship To text box to provide the customer’s shipping address. 
Click the Copy button to copy the billing address to the Ship To field. If the 
shipping address differs from the Bill To address, simply open the Ship To 
drop-down list, click Add New, and then enter the shipping address informa-
tion the same way that you enter the Bill To address. You can add multiple 
shipping addresses. After you add a shipping address for a customer, you can 
select the shipping address from the Ship To drop-down list.
11.	(Optional) Click the Payment Settings tab and record more data.
You can use the boxes on the Payment Settings tab (see Figure 3-9) to record 
bits of customer information, such as the account number that should be 
included with any payments. You can also record payment-related information 
such as the customer’s credit limit and credit card information.
FIGURE 3-9:

54      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
12.	(Optional) Click the Sales Tax Settings tab, and specify the customer’s 
sales tax rate.
You can use the boxes on the Sales Tax Setting tab (not shown) to store the 
appropriate sales tax item and rate — and to record the customer’s resale 
certificate number, if that’s needed, because sometimes, you sell items to a 
customer that aren’t subject to sales tax.
13.	(Optional) Click the Additional Info tab, and record more data.
When you click this tab, QuickBooks displays the tab shown in Figure 3-10. You 
can use this tab to describe the customer in more detail. You can, for example, 
categorize the customer via the Customer Type drop-down list box. 
(QuickBooks initially suggests using the customer types From Advertisement, 
Referral, Retail, and Wholesale, but you can click the Add New entry in the list 
box to add your own customer types.)
You can use the Rep field to record the sales representative assigned to a 
customer. (See “The Sales Rep list” later in this chapter for more information.)
You can also click the Define Fields button to display dialog boxes you use to 
create fields for collecting your own customized bits of additional information.  
(For a while, I used to use a custom field to record the marketing campaign that 
acquired a client or customer, and that extra bit of data provided great insight into 
which marketing and advertising efforts delivered good returns and which didn’t.)
FIGURE 3-10: 
Add more details 
on the Additional 
Info tab of the 
New Customer 
window.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      55
14.	(Optional) Click the Job Info tab to add specific job information.
Because you’re creating a new customer account, not invoicing by jobs, 
I explain this step in the next section. If you’re the “can’t wait” type, feel free 
to take a look. You can add a specific job to the new customer’s information.
15.	Save the customer information by clicking OK.
When you finish describing a customer, you can save it by clicking OK to add 
the customer to the list and then return to the Customer Center window.
If you want to change some bit of customer information, display the Customer 
Center window, double-click the customer name for which you want to change 
information, and then make changes in the Edit Customer window.
It’s Just a Job
In QuickBooks, you can track invoices by customer or by customer and job. This 
may sound kooky, but some businesses invoice customers (perhaps several times) 
for specific jobs.
Take the case of a construction subcontractor who does foundation work for a 
handful of builders of single-family homes. This construction subcontractor 
probably invoices his customers by job, and he invoices each customer several 
times for the same job. He invoices Poverty Rock Builders for the foundation job at 
1113 Birch Street when he pours the footing, for example, and then again when he 
lays the block. At 1028 Fairview, the same foundation job takes more than one 
invoice, too.
To set up jobs for customers, you first need to describe the customers (as I explain 
in the preceding section). Then follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Customers ➪ Customer Center.
QuickBooks displays the Customer Center window.
2.	 Right-click the customer for whom you want to set up a job, choose Add 
Job from the contextual menu that appears, and click the Add Job tab.
QuickBooks displays the New Job window (shown in Figure 3-11). You use this 
window to describe the job. A great deal of the information in this window 
appears in the invoice.

56      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
3.	 Add the job name.
The cursor is in the Job Name text box. Just type the name of the job or project. 
In Figure 3-11, for example, I give the job the name Unique Design for Grotto.
4.	 (Optional) If you’re tracking the customer’s balances by job, enter the 
job’s opening balance.
Move the cursor to the Opening Balance text box, and type the total amount 
owed by the customer for the job you’re describing on the conversion date.
5.	 Enter the current date in the As Of text box.
6.	 Identify the customer.
On the off chance that you selected the wrong customer in Step 2, take a peek 
at the Customer drop-down list. Does it name the correct customer? If not, 
activate the drop-down list and select the correct customer.
7.	 (Optional) Name your contact, and fill in other relevant information.
You can enter the name of your contact and alternative contact in the Full 
Name text boxes. QuickBooks automatically fills in the company name, full 
name, and invoice/bill to fields if that information is available for the customer 
you are doing the job for. You probably don’t need to be told this, but fill in the 
FIGURE 3-11: 
The Address Info 
tab of the New 
Job window.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      57
Phone, Fax, Email, and Website text boxes just so that you have that informa-
tion on hand.
8.	Enter the job’s billing address.
You can use the Invoice/Bill To text box to provide the customer’s job billing 
address. Because chances are good that the job billing address is the same as 
the customer billing address, QuickBooks copies the billing address from the 
Customer list. But if need be, make changes.
9.	Select the Ship To address.
You can use the Ship To text box to provide the job’s shipping address. Click 
the Copy button if the shipping address is the same as the Invoice/Bill To 
address.
10.	Click the Payment Settings tab, and describe the customer’s payment 
arrangements.
Using the Payment Settings tab (not shown), for example, you can record an 
account number and preferred payment method. You can set the customer’s 
credit limit by using the Credit Limit box. And you can store credit card 
payment information for customers who want you to keep their card numbers 
on file.
11.	(Massively optional) Click the Additional Info tab, and categorize the job.
You can use the Customer Type drop-down list of the Additional Info tab (not 
shown) to set the job type. The only initial types in the default list are From 
Advertisement, Referral, Retail, and Wholesale. You can create other types by 
choosing Add New from the Customer Type drop-down list (so that QuickBooks 
displays the New Customer Type dialog box) and then filling in the blanks.
12.	(Optional) Click the Job Info tab, and add specific job information.
Figure 3-12 shows the Job Info tab. You can use the Job Status drop-down list to 
choose None, Pending, Awarded, In Progress, Closed, or Not Awarded, 
whichever is most appropriate. The Start Date is (I know that this one is hard to 
believe) the day you start the job. As anyone knows, the Projected End Date 
and the End Date aren’t necessarily the same. Don’t fill in the End Date until the 
job is actually finished. The Job Description field can contain any helpful 
information you can fit in one line, and Job Type is an extra field you can use. 
(If you do use this field, you can add a new job type by choosing Add New from 
the Job Type list.)
13.	Save the job information by clicking OK.

58      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
You can edit job information the same way that you edit customer information. 
Display the Customer Center window by choosing Customer ➪ Customer Center. 
When QuickBooks displays the window, double-click the job and make the changes 
in the Edit Job window that appears.
To add a large number of customers or jobs to the Customers list at the same time, 
display the Customer Center window, click the New Customer & Job button, and 
then choose the Add Multiple Customer: Jobs option. QuickBooks displays the 
Add/Edit Multiple List Entries worksheet, which lets you collect and edit all the 
same information that the regular Customers & Jobs windows do.
Adding Vendors to Your Vendor List
Adding vendors to your Vendor list works the same basic way as adding customers 
to your Customer list. Here’s how to get the job done:
1.	 Choose Vendors ➪ Vendor Center or click the Vendors icon at the top of 
the screen.
QuickBooks displays the Vendor Center window. Along with listing your 
vendors, it lists any sales tax agencies that you identified as part of setting up 
Sales Tax items.
FIGURE 3-12: 
The Job Info tab 
of the New Job 
window.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      59
2.	 Click the New Vendor button and then choose the New Vendor command 
from the menu that appears.
QuickBooks displays the Address Info tab of the New Vendor window, as 
shown in Figure 3-13. You use this window to describe the vendors and all their 
little idiosyncrasies.
If you click the New Vendor button and choose the Add Multiple Vendors 
command, QuickBooks displays a worksheet you can use to describe multiple 
vendors at a time.
3.	 Enter the vendor name.
The cursor is already in the Vendor Name text box. All you have to do is type 
the vendor’s name as you want it to appear in the Vendor list. If you want to list 
your vendors by company name, enter the company name. To list them by the 
first or last name of the sales representative, enter one of these names. Just 
remember that the list is going to sort, alphabetically or numerically, by the 
information you enter in this field, not by the information that follows it.
4.	 (Optional) Enter the name of your contact.
Fill in the Full Name text boxes with the customer contact’s first name, middle 
initial, and last name. You can also supply a title for the contact person.
FIGURE 3-13:

tab of the New 
Vendor window.

60      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
5.	(Optional) Enter the vendor’s telephone and email address and, if 
available, the fax number and website addresses.
You can change the labels used for the telephone number boxes by choosing 
some other description from their drop-down lists. And do note that the 
window also has an Other 1 text box so you can record some other bit of 
tangential information — perhaps the contact’s weight.
6.	Enter the address to which you’re supposed to mail checks.
You can use the Address Details Billed From and Shipped From text boxes to 
provide the vendor’s addresses information. QuickBooks copies the Company 
and Contact names to the first line of the address, so you need to enter only 
the street address, city, state, and zip code. To move from the end of one line 
to the start of the next, press Enter.
7.	(Optional) Check the default Payment Settings tab’s information.
Click the Payment Settings tab (not shown) to get to a set of boxes that lets you 
record the vendor’s account number, vendor payment terms, the right name 
to print on the check, and the credit limit.
An account number is required if you want to use QuickBooks’ online bill 
payment feature (which I describe in Chapter 13) to pay the vendor. 
QuickBooks transfers the account number to the memo field of the payment 
check.
8.	(Optional) Check the default Tax Settings.
You can click the Tax Settings tab (not shown) to get to a set of boxes that lets 
you record the vendor’s tax identification number and indicate whether the 
vendor should receive a 1099 information tax return from you at the end of 
the year.
9.	(Optional) Provide the default accounts to use with a vendor.
You can click the Account Settings tab (see Figure 3-14) to display a short list of 
accounts that QuickBooks will use to prefill account number fields when you 
enter a bill from the vendor.
10.	(Optional) Click the Additional Info tab, and categorize the vendor.
The Additional Info tab (not shown) initially provides just a Vendor Type 
drop-down list that you can use to categorize the vendor as a consultant, 
service provider, supplier, or tax agency. You can, however, add custom fields 
to the tab by clicking the Define Fields button.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      61
11.	Type 0 (zero) in the Opening Balance text box (refer to Figure 3-13).
You typically don’t want to enter the amount you owe the vendor; you do that 
later, when you pay your bills. But if you’re using accrual-basis accounting for 
your expenses (which just means that your accounting system counts bills as 
expenses when you get the bill, not when you pay the bill), you need to tell 
QuickBooks what amounts you owe vendors at the conversion date. You can 
do that most easily by entering opening balances for vendors in the Opening 
Balance box as you set up a vendor in the Vendor list.
12.	Enter the conversion date in the As Of date field.
What you’re doing here, by the way, is providing the date on which the value 
shown in the Opening Balance text box is correct.
QuickBooks provides an Account Savings tab in the New Vendor window. Use 
this tab to specify a set of expense accounts that QuickBooks will suggest any 
time you indicate you’re writing a check, entering a bill, or entering a credit card 
charge for the vendor.
13.	Save the vendor information by clicking OK.
This step adds the vendor to the list and returns you to the Vendor Center 
window.
FIGURE 3-14:

Settings tab of

window.

62      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
To add a large number of vendors to the Vendor list at the same time, display the 
Vendor Center window, click the New Vendor button, and then choose the Add 
Multiple Vendors option. QuickBooks displays the Add/Edit Multiple List Entries 
worksheet, which lets you collect and edit all the same information that the regu-
lar vendor windows do. If you’re so inclined, you can use this window to copy and 
paste vendor information from a Microsoft Excel workbook.
The Other Lists
Throughout the preceding sections, I cover almost all the most important lists. A 
few others I haven’t talked about yet are Fixed Asset, Price Level, Billing Rate 
Level, Sales Tax Code, Classes, Other Names, Sales Rep, Customer Type, Vendor 
Type, Job Type, Terms, Customer Messages, Payment Method, Ship Via, Vehicle, 
and Memorized Transactions. I don’t give blow-by-blow descriptions of how you 
use these lists because you don’t really need them. The other QuickBooks lists are 
generally more than adequate. You can usually use the standard lists as is without 
building other lists.
Just so I don’t leave you stranded, however, I want to give you quick-and-dirty 
descriptions of these other lists and what they do.
To see some of these lists, choose the list from the Lists menu or choose Lists ➪  
Customer & Vendor Profile Lists and then choose the list from the submenu that 
QuickBooks displays.
THE LITTLE THINGS DO MATTER
If you aren’t familiar with how payment terms work, you can get a bird’s-eye view here. 
For the most part, payment terms just indicate how quickly a vendor expects to be paid. 
Due on receipt, for example, means that the vendor expects to be paid as soon as possi-
ble. If Net is followed by some number, as in Net 15 or Net 30, the number indicates the 
number of days after the invoice date within which the vendor wants you to pay. So Net 
15 means that the vendor wants you to pay within 15 days of the invoice date.
Some payment terms, such as 2% 10 Net 30, include early-payment discounts. In other 
words, the vendor allows a customer to deduct 2 percent from the bill if it’s paid within 
10 days or to pay the regular, full amount within 30 days. For more information on how 
to make early-payment discounts work for you, see Chapter 20.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      63
The Fixed Asset Item list
If you buy fixed assets — things such as vehicles, various pieces of furniture, mis-
cellaneous hunks of equipment, and so on — somebody is supposed to track this 
stuff in a list. Why? You need to have this information at your fingertips (or at 
your accountant’s fingertips) to calculate depreciation. And if you later dispose of 
some item, you need this information to calculate the gain or loss on the sale of 
the item.
For these reasons, QuickBooks includes a Fixed Asset list. Figure 3-15 shows the 
Fixed Asset Item List window, which you use to describe and identify your fixed 
assets.
Note: I should tell you that your CPA or tax accountant already has such a list that 
he or she has been maintaining for you. So don’t, like, totally freak out because 
this is the first you’ve heard about this fixed-assets business.
Chapter 18 describes handling fixed assets in a bit more detail.
FIGURE 3-15: 
The Fixed Asset 
Item List window.

64      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
The Price Level list
The first time I encountered the QuickBooks Price Level feature, I was sorely con-
fused about how it worked. I’m still a little confused — not about how the feature 
works, but about who’d really want to use it. But heck, what do I know? Here’s the 
deal: Price levels enable you to adjust an item price as you’re creating an invoice. 
You can create a price level that increases the price for some item by 20 percent, 
for example, and you create a price level that decreases the price for some item by 
10 percent. You adjust a price by selecting a price level from the Price field of an 
invoice. (This may not make much sense until you see the Create Invoices window, 
which I describe in Chapter 4, but it’s fairly straightforward.)
The Billing Rate Levels list
The Billing Rate Levels list lets you build a list of custom prices for service items 
rather than use a standard rate for a particular service item. You then use billing 
rate levels when you invoice a customer for services.
The Sales Tax Code list
The Sales Tax Code list, which appears if you turn on the Sales Tax option, just 
maintains a list of sales tax codes. These sales tax codes, when used in an invoice 
or bill, tell QuickBooks whether items are taxable.
The Class list
Classes enable you to classify transactions by department or location, for example, 
so that you can track trends and assess performance across parts of your business. 
Classes are cool (really cool), but they add another dimension to the accounting 
model that you use in QuickBooks, so I’m not going to describe them here. I urge 
you — nay, I implore you — to get comfortable with how the rest of QuickBooks 
works before you begin mucking about with classes. Here are just a handful of 
useful tidbits in case you want to use classes:
»
» You may need to turn on the QuickBooks Class Tracking feature. To do this, 
choose Edit ➪ Preferences, click the Accounting icon, click the Company 
Preferences tab, and select the Use Class Tracking check box.
Note: The Class box appears in data entry windows only after you turn on 
Class Tracking.
»
» To display the Class list, choose Lists ➪ Class List.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      65
»
» To add classes to the Class list, display the Class List window (choose 
Lists ➪ Class List), right-click the window, choose New to display the New Class 
window, and then fill in the blanks.
»
» To tag transactions as falling into a particular class — invoices, checks, bills, 
journal entries, and so on — select the appropriate class from the Class 
list box.
By the way, one other point: Before you go off and start using classes to compli-
cate your accounting, make sure that you can’t get what you want by beefing up 
your chart of accounts.
You won’t see a Class List command on the Lists menu if you indicated during 
QuickBooks Setup that you don’t want to use classes. But you can change 
your  mind later and start using classes. Choose Edit ➪ Preferences, click the 
­Accounting icon, and select the Use Class Tracking check box on the Company 
­Preferences tab.
The Other Names list
QuickBooks provides an Other Names list that works as a watered-down, wimpy 
Vendor and Employee list combination. You can write checks to people named in 
this Other Names list, but you can’t do anything else. You can’t create invoices or 
purchase orders for them, for example, and you don’t get any of the other infor-
mation that you want to collect for vendors or employees.
You’re really better off working with good, accurate, rich Vendor and Employee 
lists. If you don’t like this suggestion, however, just choose Lists ➪ Other Names 
List to display the Other Names List window, click the Other Names button, choose 
New from the drop-down list, and then fill in the blanks in the New Name 
window.
The Sales Rep list
You can create a list of the sales representatives you work with and then indicate 
which sales rep sells to a customer or generates a sale. To do this, choose 
Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Sales Rep. When you choose this com-
mand, QuickBooks displays the Sales Rep List window, which lists all the sales 
representatives. To add sales representatives, click the Sales Rep button, select 
New from the drop-down list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks 
displays.

66      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
Customer, Vendor, and Job Types list
You can create lists of customer types, vendor types, and job types and then use 
these lists to categorize customer, vendor, and job information. This is probably 
no surprise, but to do this, you need to use the appropriate command:
»
» Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Customer Type List
»
» Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Vendor Type List
»
» Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Job Type List
When you choose one of these commands, QuickBooks displays the appropriate 
List window, which lists all the Customer types, Vendor types, or Job types. To add 
types, click the Type button, select New from the drop-down list, and then fill in 
the window that QuickBooks displays.
How you use any of these types of lists depends on your business. In a situation in 
which you want to sort or segregate customers, vendors, or jobs in some unusual 
way, use the Customer Type, Vendor Type, or Job Type list.
Over the past few years, I’ve used the Customer Type box to identify which mar-
keting technique has brought me a client: yellow-pages advertising, newspaper 
advertising, professional referrals, and so on. Because QuickBooks easily prints 
reports that summarize client revenue by customer type, using the Customer Type 
field in this manner lets me easily see how much revenue different marketing 
activities produce  — and when I’m getting a decent return on my marketing 
dollars.
The Terms list
QuickBooks maintains a Terms list, which you use to specify what payment terms 
are available. To add terms, choose Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Terms 
List. When you choose this command, QuickBooks displays the Terms List win-
dow. To add more terms, click the Terms button, select New from the drop-down 
list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
The Customer Message list
This list is another minor player in the QuickBooks drama. You can stick messages 
at the bottom of invoices if you first type the message in the Customer Message 
list.  QuickBooks provides a handful of boilerplate messages: thank you, happy 
holidays, mean people suck, and so on. You can add more messages by choosing 

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      67
Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Customer Message List. When QuickBooks 
displays the Customer Message List window, click its Customer Message button 
and choose New. Then use the New Customer Message window that QuickBooks 
displays to create a new message.
The Payment Method list
Now, this will be a big surprise. (I’m just kidding.) QuickBooks provides descrip-
tions for the usual payment methods. But of course, you can add to these by 
choosing Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Payment Method. When you 
choose this command, QuickBooks displays the lost city of Atlantis. Okay, not 
really. QuickBooks actually displays the Payment Method window. To add more 
methods — such as PayPal — click the Payment Method button, select New from 
the drop-down list, and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays.
The Ship Via list
QuickBooks provides descriptions for the usual shipping methods. These descrip-
tions are probably entirely adequate. If you need to add more, however, you can do 
so by choosing Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Ship Via. When you 
choose this command, QuickBooks displays the Ship Via List window, which lists 
all the shipping methods that you or QuickBooks said are available. To add more 
methods, click the Shipping Method button, select New from the drop-down list, 
and then fill in the window that QuickBooks displays. Friends, it doesn’t get much 
easier than this.
The Vehicle list
As I describe in a bit more detail in Chapter 18, QuickBooks provides a Vehicle list 
that you can use to maintain a list of business vehicles. To see the Vehicle list, 
choose Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Vehicle List. When you choose 
this command, QuickBooks displays the Vehicle List window, which lists all the 
vehicles that you previously said are available. To identify additional vehicles, 
click the Vehicle button, select New from the drop-down list, and then fill in the 
window that QuickBooks displays.
To record vehicle mileage inside QuickBooks, choose Company ➪ Enter Vehicle 
Mileage. Then use the window that QuickBooks displays to identify the vehicle, 
the trip length in miles, the trip date, and a bit of other trip-related information.

The Memorized Transaction list
The Memorized Transaction list isn’t really a list. At least, it’s not like the other 
lists that I describe in this chapter. The Memorized Transaction list is a list of 
accounting transactions — invoices, bills, checks, purchase orders, and so on — 
that you’ve asked QuickBooks to memorize. To display the Memorized Transac-
tion list, choose Lists ➪ Memorized Transaction List.
You can have QuickBooks memorize transactions so that you can quickly record 
them later or even put them on a schedule for recurring use. This feature can save 
time for transactions that are largely identical each time you enter them and that 
you enter regularly.
The Reminders list
Here’s a list that isn’t accessible from the Lists menu. QuickBooks keeps  
track of a bunch of stuff that it knows you need to monitor. If you choose 
­Company ➪ Reminders, QuickBooks displays the Reminders window. Here, you see 
such entries as invoices and checks that need to be printed, inventory items you 
probably should reorder, and so on.
Organizing Lists
To organize a list, you must be in single-user mode. (I describe multiuser mode in 
Appendix C.) Here are some ways that you can organize your list:
»
» To move an item and all its subitems: Click the diamond beside the item 
and then drag the item up or down the list to a new location.
»
» To make a subitem its own item: Click the diamond beside the item and 
then drag it to the left.
»
» To make an item a subitem: Move the item so that it’s directly below the 
item you want it to fall under. Then click the diamond beside the item and 
drag it to the right.
»
» To alphabetize a list: Click the Name button at the top of the list window. 
QuickBooks alphabetizes your list of customers, vendors, accounts, and so on 
in both A to Z order and reverse Z to A order.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      69
Printing Lists
You can print customer, vendor, and employee lists by clicking the Print button at 
the top of the specific Center screen for the type of list you choose. The list is 
among the options available to print in a drop-down list.
You can print a regular list by displaying the list, clicking the button in the 
­bottom-left corner of the list window, and then choosing Print List. Often, how-
ever, the best way to print a list is to print a list report. You can create, customize, 
and print a list report by choosing Reports ➪ List and then choosing the list that 
you want to print. You can also create one of a handful of list reports by clicking 
the Reports button in the list window and choosing a report from the pop-up 
menu. For more information on printing reports, see Chapter 15.
Click the Activities button in a list window to quickly access common activities 
associated with the items in that list, or click Reports to quickly access common 
reports related to the items in the list.
Exporting List Items to Your  
Word Processor
If you use QuickBooks to store the names and addresses of your customers, ven-
dors, and employees, you can create a text file of the contact information for these 
people. Then you can export this file to another application, such as a word pro-
cessor, to create reports that use this information.
To export list information to a text file, click the button in the bottom-left corner 
of the list window, and choose Print List. When QuickBooks displays the Print 
dialog box, select the File option button, click Print, and provide a filename when 
prompted.
The File menu’s Print Forms command also provides a Labels command for pro-
ducing mailing labels for customers and vendors. And before I forget, let me also 
mention that the last command on the Company menu — Prepare Letters with 
Envelopes — lets you prepare letters (and, duh, addressed envelopes) using the 
name and address information from the Customer, Vendor, and Employee lists 
discussed earlier in this chapter.

Dealing with the Chart of Accounts List
I saved the best for last. After you get done setting up your lists, you still need to 
finalize one list: Chart of Accounts. The Chart of Accounts list just lists the accounts 
you and QuickBooks use to track income and expenses, assets, liabilities, and 
equity.
This step is kind of a funny one, however, because a bunch of Chart of Accounts 
stuff is already set up; you’re just finalizing it. Typically, this consists of two or 
possibly three separate steps: describing customer balances, describing vendor 
balances, and entering the rest of the trial balance.
Describing customer balances
If you entered customer unpaid invoice totals when you set up the customers — 
which is what I recommend — you’ve already described your customer balances. 
You, my friend, can skip to the next section, “Describing vendor balances.”
If you didn’t enter customer unpaid invoice totals, you need to supply that infor-
mation before you finalize the Chart of Account information. To do this, enter the 
invoice in the usual way, which I describe in Chapter 4. The one really important 
thing to do is use the original invoice date when you enter the invoice.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Hey, dude. The order of your instructions is 
all screwed up. Here I am, slogging through Chapter 3, and now, totally out of the 
blue, you’re telling me that I have to jump ahead to Chapter 4 and read that?”
Yeah, well, that’s right. This jumping around and jumping ahead is the big reason 
why I tell you earlier to do it the way I did. Hey, sorry.
Describing vendor balances
If you entered vendor unpaid bill totals when you set up the vendors — which is 
also what I recommend earlier — you described your vendor balances. In which 
case, you can skip to the next section, “Camouflaging some accounting 
goofiness.”
If you didn’t enter vendor unpaid bill totals, you need to supply that information, 
as I describe in Chapter 6 in the discussion on recording your bills the accounts 
payable way. The one really important thing to do is to use the original vendor bill 
date when you enter the vendor bill.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      71
Camouflaging some accounting goofiness
After you enter the customer and vendor balances into QuickBooks, you need to 
enter the rest of the trial balance, which you do by taking two big steps. In the first 
step, you camouflage a couple of goofy accounts, called suspense accounts, which 
QuickBooks creates when you set up the Item, Customer, and Vendor lists. The 
second step, which I describe in the following section, is supplying the last few 
missing numbers.
Figure  3-16 shows a sample trial balance after I enter the inventory, accounts 
receivable, and accounts payable balances. (These account balances get set up 
indirectly, as I note in the sidebar “For accountants and bookkeepers only” later 
in this chapter.) When you set up your Item, Customer, and Vendor lists, you also 
create account balances for inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable.
You can produce your own half-complete trial balance from inside QuickBooks by 
clicking the Report Center icon and choosing Reports ➪ Accountants & Taxes ➪ Trial 
Balance. QuickBooks displays the trial balance report in a document window.
If you need to do so, enter the conversion date in the From box by clicking the box 
and typing the conversion date in MM/DD/YYYY format. Figure 3-16, for example, 
FIGURE 3-16: 
A sample trial 
balance.

72      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
shows the conversion date 6/30/2017 on the To line. You can set the From box to 
any value; the From and To range just needs to end with the conversion date. 
Make a note of the credit and debit balances shown for the Uncategorized Income 
and Uncategorized Expenses accounts.
If you want, you can print the report by clicking the Print button; then, when 
QuickBooks displays the Print Report dialog box, click its Print button. Yes, you 
click two Print buttons.
After you have the conversion date balances for the Uncategorized Income and 
Uncategorized Expenses accounts, you’re ready to make the accrual-accounting 
adjustment. To do so, follow these steps:
1.	 From the home screen, either click the Chart of Accounts icon in the 
Company area or choose Lists ➪ Chart of Accounts to display the Chart of 
Accounts window, as shown in Figure 3-17.
2.	 Double-click Opening Balance Equity in the Chart of Accounts list to 
display that account.
Opening Balance Equity is listed after the liability accounts. QuickBooks 
displays the register — a list of transactions — for the Opening Balance Equity 
FIGURE 3-17: 
The Chart of 
Accounts window.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      73
account. Figure 3-18, coincidentally, shows this register. Note that your version 
of the Opening Balance Equity register will look different because it’ll have 
different transactions.
3.	Select the next empty row of the register if it isn’t already selected 
(although it probably is).
You can select a row by clicking it, or you can use the up- or down-arrow key to 
move to the next empty row.
4.	Type the conversion date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there), and type the date. 
Use MM/DD/YYYY format. You can type either 06302017 or 6/30/2017 to enter 
June 30, 2017.
5.	Type the Uncategorized Income account balance (from the trial balance 
report) in the Increase field.
In Figure 3-16, for example, the Uncategorized Income account balance is 
$190,000. In this case, click the Increase field (shown in Figure 3-18) and type 
190000 in the field.
You don’t need to include the dollar sign or the comma; QuickBooks adds the 
symbol and punctuation for you.
6.	Type Uncategorized Income (the account name) in the Account field.
Select the Account field, which is on the row below the word Payee (shown in 
Figure 3-18), and begin typing Uncategorized Income, the account name. As 
soon as you type enough of the name for QuickBooks to figure out what you’re 
typing, it fills in the rest of the name for you. When this happens, you can stop 
typing.
7.	Click the Record button to record the Uncategorized Income adjustment 
transaction.
Again, select the next empty row of the register.
8.	Click the row or use the up- or down-arrow key.
9.	Type the conversion date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there) and type the date. 
You use MM/DD/YYYY format. You can type 6/30/2017, for example, to enter 
June 30, 2017.
10.	Type the Uncategorized Expenses account balance in the Decrease field.
In Figure 3-16 (shown earlier), for example, the Uncategorized Expenses 
account balance is $75,000. In this case, you click the Decrease field and then 

74      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
type 75000. I’ve said this before, but I’ll say it again because you’re just starting: 
You don’t need to include any symbol or punctuation, such as a dollar sign or 
comma.
11.	Type Uncategorized Expenses (the account name) in the Account field.
Select the Account field, which is on the second line of the register transaction, 
and begin typing Uncategorized Expenses, the account name. As soon as you 
type enough of the name for QuickBooks to figure out what you’re typing, it 
fills in the rest of the name for you.
12.	Click the Record button to record the Uncategorized Expenses adjust-
ment transaction.
Figure 3-18 shows the Opening Balance Equity register with the correction 
transactions. The correction transactions are numbered with a 1 and a 2. See 
them? They’re the fourth and fifth transactions in the register.
You can close the Opening Balance Equity register at this point. You’re finished 
with it. One way to close it is to click the Close button in the top-right corner of 
the window.

FOR ACCOUNTANTS AND  
BOOKKEEPERS ONLY
If you’re reading this sidebar, I assume that you’re an accountant or a bookkeeper who’s 
been asked to help your client with the last piece of the QuickBooks conversion. You 
understand double-entry bookkeeping, of course, and presumably you’re familiar with 
the general mechanics involved in converting to new accounting systems. With those 
two caveats, you’re ready to start.
First, your client has probably already installed QuickBooks and then, by running some-
thing called QuickBooks Setup, partially set up a Chart of Accounts and loaded three 
master files: the Item list, the Customer list, and the Vendor list. The Item list master file 
describes the inventory account balances. (QuickBooks uses an average costing assump-
tion.) The Customer list master file describes the accounts receivable balances. The 
Vendor list master file describes the accounts payable balances. Because your client has 
set up these master files, QuickBooks has made three journal entries, which I describe in 
the following paragraphs. (I’m using Xs to represent numbers, in case you’re not familiar 
with this convention.)
To set up the conversion date bank account and inventory balance (if either exists), 
QuickBooks created the following entry:
Debit
Credit
Bank Account Asset
$X,XXX
Inventory Asset
$X,XXX
Opening Bal Equity
$X,XXX
To set up the conversion date accounts receivable (A/R) balance (if A/R exists), 
QuickBooks created the following entry:
Debit
Credit
Accounts Receivable
$X,XXX
Uncategorized Income
$X,XXX
To set up the conversion date accounts payable (A/P) balance (if A/P exists), QuickBooks 
created the following entry:
Debit
Credit
Accounts Payable
$X,XXX
Uncategorized Expenses
$X,XXX
(continued)

76      PART 1  Quickly into QuickBooks
You can check your work thus far — and checking it is a good idea — by producing 
another copy of the trial balance report. What you want to check are the Uncatego-
rized Income and Uncategorized Expenses account balances. They should both be 
zero, as shown in Figure 3-19.
You can produce a trial balance by choosing Reports ➪ Accountant & Taxes ➪ Trial 
Balance. QuickBooks displays the trial balance report in a document window. If 
you need to enter the conversion date in the As Of line, click in the box and type 
the conversion date in MM/DD/YYYY format.
If the Uncategorized Income and the Uncategorized Expenses account balances 
don’t show zero, you (with my help, of course) might have botched the accrual 
(continued)
To complete the picture, you need to do two little housekeeping chores. If your client 
plans to use accrual-basis accounting, you need to get rid of the credit to the Uncat-
egorized Income account and the debit to the Uncategorized Expenses account. (These 
two accounts are really just suspense accounts.) And you need to load the rest of the 
trial balance. I describe the steps for accomplishing these tasks in the upcoming section 
“Supplying the missing numbers.”
FIGURE 3-19: 
Another sample

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      77
adjustment. To fix the mistake, redisplay the Opening Balance Equity register (as 
noted earlier, you can double-click Opening Balance Equity in the Chart of 
Accounts list to display that account); select the adjustment transactions; and 
then check the account, amount, and field (Increase or Decrease). If one of the 
fields is wrong, select the field and replace its contents by typing over it.
One other point. Though Figures 3-16 and 3-19 don’t show them, QuickBooks may 
display other accounts in its trial balance (depending on how you set up the Quick-
Books file). You don’t need to worry about these other accounts, however. You 
only need to make sure that the Uncategorized Income and Uncategorized Expense 
account balances equal zero after your adjustments.
Supplying the missing numbers
You’re almost done. Really. Your last task is to enter the rest of the trial balance 
amounts into QuickBooks. To perform this task, you need to have a trial balance 
prepared as of the conversion date. If you followed my instructions in Chapter 2, 
you have one. Follow these steps:
1.	 Choose either Company ➪ Make General Journal Entries or 
Accountant ➪ Make General Journal Entries.
QuickBooks displays the Make General Journal Entries window, as shown in 
Figure 3-20.
2.	 Type the conversion date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date field (if it isn’t already there), and type the date. As 
you might know by now, you use MM/DD/YYYY format. You can type 6/30/2017 
for June 30, 2017, for example (or 06302017, if you don’t want to put in the 
slashes).
3.	 Type each trial balance account and balance that isn’t already in the 
half-completed trial balance.
Okay. This step sounds confusing. But remember that you’ve already entered 
your cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable account 
balances; perhaps even a few other account balances; and a portion of the 
Opening Balance Equity account balance as part of QuickBooks Setup.
Now you need to enter the rest of the trial balance — specifically, the year-to- 
date income and expense account balances, any missing assets or liabilities, 
and the remaining portion of the Opening Balance Equity. To enter each 
account and balance, use a row of the Make General Journal Entries window 
list box. Figure 3-21 shows how this window looks after you enter the rest of 
the trial balance into the list-box rows.

CHAPTER 3  Populating QuickBooks Lists      79
If you need an account that isn’t already in your QuickBooks Chart of Accounts, 
no problem. Enter the account name you want in the Account column of the 
Make General Journal Entries window. When QuickBooks displays the message 
Account not found, click the Set Up button. QuickBooks then displays the Add 
New Account: Choose Account Type dialog box. Use it to identify the type of 
account you’re setting up: Income, Expense, Fixed Asset, Bank, Loan, Credit, or 
Equity. Click Continue to display the Add New Account dialog box. Use it to create 
a longer description of the account (if you want) and then click Save & Close.
4.	 Click the Save & New button to record the general journal entries that set 
up the rest of your trial balance.
Checking your work one more time
Double-checking your work is a good idea. Produce another copy of the trial bal-
ance report, and check that the QuickBooks trial balance is the same one that you 
wanted to enter.
You can produce a trial balance by choosing Reports ➪ Accountant & Taxes ➪ Trial 
Balance. Be sure to enter the conversion date in the As Of text box. If the Quick-
Books trial balance report agrees with what your records show, you’re finished.
If the QuickBooks trial balance doesn’t agree with what your records show, you 
need to fix the problem. Fixing it is a bit awkward but isn’t complicated. Choose 
Reports ➪ Accountant & Taxes ➪ Journal. QuickBooks displays a report or journal 
that lists all the transactions that you or QuickBooks entered as part of setting up. 
(The Dates, From, and To text boxes need to specify the conversion date.) Scroll 
through the list of transactions until you get to the last one. The last transaction 
is the one that you entered to set up the rest of the trial balance; it names recog-
nizable accounts and uses familiar debit and credit amounts. Double-click this 
transaction. QuickBooks redisplays the Make General Journal Entries window with 
the botched transaction. Find the mistake and then fix the erroneous account or 
amount by clicking it and typing the correct account or amount.
Congratulations! You’re done.

Making Sure That You’re Ready  
to Invoice Customers
I know that you’re probably all set to go. But first, you need to check a few things, 
okay? Good.
You already should have installed QuickBooks, of course. (I briefly describe how in 
Appendix A.) You should have set up a company and a Chart of Accounts in Quick-
Books Setup, as I describe in Chapter 2. You also should have entered all your lists 
and your starting trial balance or talked your accountant into entering it for you, 
as I describe in Chapter 3.
As long as you’ve done all this prerequisite stuff, you’re ready to start. If you don’t 
have one of the prerequisites done, you need to complete it before going any 
further.
Sorry. I don’t make the rules. I just tell you what they are.
Preparing an Invoice
After you complete all the preliminary work, preparing an invoice with Quick-
Books is a snap. If clicking buttons and filling in text boxes are becoming old hat 
to you, skip the following play-by-play commentary and simply display the Cre-
ate Invoices window — either by choosing Customers ➪ Create Invoices or clicking 
the Invoices icon on the home page. Then fill in this window and click the Print 
button. If you want more help than a single sentence provides, keep reading for 
step-by-step instructions.
In the following steps, I describe how to create the most complicated and involved 
invoice around: a product invoice. Some fields in the product invoice don’t 
appear in the service or professional invoice, but don’t worry about whether your 
business is service or professional. Creating a service or professional invoice 
works basically the same way as creating a product invoice; you just fill in fewer 
fields. And keep in mind that you start with Steps 1 and 2 no matter what type of 
invoice you create. Without further ado, here’s how to create an invoice:
1.	 Display the Create Invoices window by choosing Customers ➪ Create 
Invoices.
The Create Invoices window appears, as shown in Figure 4-1.

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      85
2.	 Select the template or invoice form that you want to use from the 
Template drop-down list.
QuickBooks comes with predefined invoice form types, including Product, 
Professional, Service, and (depending on how you set up QuickBooks and 
which version of QuickBooks you’re using) a handful of other specialized 
invoice templates. Which one appears by default depends on what you told 
QuickBooks about your business during QuickBooks Setup. You can also create 
your own custom invoice template (or modify an existing one). I describe 
customizing invoice forms in the “Customizing Your Invoices and Credit 
Memos” section later in this chapter.
3.	 Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job by using the Customer:Job 
drop-down list.
Scroll through the Customer:Job drop-down list until you see the customer or 
job name that you need; then click it.
4.	 (Optional) Assign a class to the invoice.
If you use classes to track expenses and income, activate the Class drop-down 
list and select an appropriate class for the invoice. To turn this handy way of 
categorizing transactions on or off (which is overkill for some businesses), 
choose Edit ➪ Preferences, click Accounting on the left, click the Company 
Preferences tab, and then select or clear the Use Class Tracking check box. 
(Figure 4-1 doesn’t show the Class box.)

Invoices window.

5.	 Give the invoice date.
Press Tab several times to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then enter 
the correct date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You also can use the following secret 
codes to change the date:
•	 Press + (the plus symbol) to move the date ahead one day.
•	 Press – (the minus symbol) to move the date back one day.
•	 Press T to change the date to today’s date (as specified by the system time 
that your computer’s internal clock provides).
•	 Press M to change the date to the first day of the month (because M is the 
first letter in the word month).
•	 Press H to change the date to the last day of the month (because H is the 
last letter in the word month).
•	 Press Y to change the date to the first day of the year (because, as you no 
doubt can guess, Y is the first letter in the word year).
•	 Press R to change the date to the last day of the year (because R is the last 
letter in the word year).
You can also click the button at the right end of the Date field to display a small 
calendar. To select a date from the calendar, just click the date you want. Click 
the arrows in the top-left and top-right corners of the calendar to display the 
previous or next month.
6.	 (Optional) Enter an invoice number in the Invoice # text box.
QuickBooks suggests an invoice number by adding 1 to the last invoice 
number that you used. You can accept this addition or, if you need to have it 
your way, tab to the Invoice # text box and change the number to whatever 
you want.
7.	 Fix the Bill To address, if necessary.
QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list. You can change 
the address for the invoice by replacing some portion of the usual billing 
address. You can, for example, insert another line that says Attention: William 
Bobbins, if that’s the name of the person to whom the invoice should go.
8.	 Fix the Ship To address, if necessary.
I feel like a broken record, but here’s the deal: QuickBooks also grabs the 
shipping address from the Customer list. So if the shipping address has 
something unusual about it for just this one invoice, you can change the 
address by replacing or adding information to the Ship To address block. Note 
that QuickBooks will keep track of each of the shipping addresses you use for a 
customer, so if you used a shipping address before, you may be able to select 
it from the Ship To drop-down list.

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      87
9.	(Optional . . . sort of) Provide the purchase order number in the 
P.O. Number text box.
If the customer issues purchase orders (POs), enter the number of the 
purchase order that authorizes this purchase. (Just for the record, PO is 
pronounced pee-oh, not poh or poo.)
10.	Specify the payment terms by selecting an option from the Terms 
drop-down list.
I have only one request: Don’t offer a customer an early-payment discount 
without reading the first couple of sections in Chapter 20. Please. I’m only 
looking out for your welfare. Really.
11.	(Optional) Name the sales representative.
Rep doesn’t stand for reputation, so don’t put three-letter editorial comments 
here (although I’d love to see what you can do with three letters). If you want to 
track sales by sales representative, use the Rep drop-down list. Simply activate 
the list by clicking its arrow and then pick a name. Sales representatives can 
include employees, but they can also include other people whom you’ve 
entered in your other lists. To quickly add a sales rep, select Add New and then 
use the handy-dandy dialog boxes that QuickBooks displays. To work with the 
Sales Rep list, choose Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Sales Rep List.
12.	Specify the shipping date if it’s something other than the invoice date.
To specify the date, simply move the cursor to the Ship text box and then type 
the date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You can move the cursor by pressing Tab or 
by clicking the text box.
One other quick point: Remember all those secret codes that I talk about in 
Step 5 for changing the invoice date? They also work for changing the shipping 
date.
13.	Specify the shipping method.
You can probably guess how you specify the shipping method, but parallel 
structure and a compulsive personality force me to continue. So to specify the 
shipping method, move the cursor to the Via drop-down list and then select a 
shipping method from it.
By the way, you can add new shipping methods to the list by selecting Add 
New and then filling out the cute little dialog box that QuickBooks displays. 
Setting up new shipping methods is really, really easy.
14.	Specify the FOB point by using the F.O.B. text box.
FOB stands for free on board. The FOB point is more important than it first 
seems — at least in a business sense — because the FOB point determines 
when the transfer of ownership occurs, who pays freight, and who bears the 
risks of damage to the goods during shipping.

88      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
If a shipment is free on board at the shipping point, the ownership of the goods 
being sold transfers to the purchaser as soon as the goods leave the seller’s 
shipping dock. (Remember that you’re the seller.) In this case, the purchaser 
pays the freight and bears the risk of shipping damage. You can specify the FOB 
shipping point either as FOB Shipping Point or by using the name of the city. If 
the shipping point is Seattle, for example, FOB Seattle is the same thing as FOB 
Shipping Point. Most goods are shipped as FOB Shipping Point, by the way.
If a shipment is free on board at the destination point, the ownership of the 
goods that are being sold transfers to the purchaser as soon as the goods 
arrive on the purchaser’s shipping dock. The seller pays the freight and bears 
the risk of shipping damage. You can specify the FOB destination point either 
as FOB Destination Point or by using the name of the city. If the destination 
point is Omaha, for example, FOB Omaha is the same thing as FOB Destination 
Point.
15.	Enter each item that you’re selling.
Move the cursor to the first row of the Quantity/Item Code/Description/Price 
Each/Amount/Tax list box. (Okay, I know that isn’t a very good name for it, but 
you know what I mean, right?) You need to start filling in the line items that go 
in the invoice. After you move the cursor to a row in the list box, QuickBooks 
turns the Item Code field into a drop-down list. Activate the Item Code 
drop-down list of the first empty row in the list box and then select the item.
When you select the item, QuickBooks fills in the Description and Price Each 
text boxes with whatever sales description and sales price you’ve entered in the 
Item list. (You can edit the information for this particular invoice if you need to.) 
Enter the number of items sold in the Quantity text box. (After you enter this 
number, QuickBooks calculates the amount by multiplying Quantity by Price 
Each.) If you need other items in the invoice, use the remaining empty rows of 
the list box to enter each one. If you selected the Taxable check box when you 
added the item to the Item list, the word Tax appears in the Tax column to 
indicate that the item will be taxed. If the item is nontaxable (or you feel like 
being a tax evader for no good reason), click the Tax column and select Non.
You can put as many items in an invoice as you want. If you don’t have enough 
room on a single page, QuickBooks adds as many pages as necessary to the 
invoice. Information about the invoice total, of course, goes only on the last 
page.
Click the Add Time/Costs button on the ribbon at the top of the form to display 
the Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box. Use this dialog box to select 
costs that you’ve assigned to the customer or job. Use the Items tab to select 
items purchased for the job. Use the Expenses tab to select reimbursable 
expenses and enter markup information. Use the Time tab to select billable 
time recorded by the Timer program, the Weekly Timesheet, or the Time/Enter 
Single Activity window.

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      89
16.	Enter any special items that the invoice should include.
If you haven’t worked much with the QuickBooks item file, you have no idea 
what I’m talking about. (For more information about adding to and working 
with lists in QuickBooks, cruise through Chapter 3.)
To describe any of the special items, activate the Item Code drop-down list of 
the next empty row and then select the special item. After QuickBooks fills in 
the Description and Price Each text boxes, edit this information (if necessary). 
Describe each of the other special items — subtotals, discounts, freight, and 
so on — that you’re itemizing in the invoice by filling in the empty rows in the 
list box.
If you want to include a Discount item and have it apply to multiple items, you 
need to stick a Subtotal item in the invoice after the inventory or other items 
that you want to discount. Then stick a Discount item directly after the Subtotal 
item. QuickBooks calculates the discount as a percentage of the subtotal.
17.	(Optional) Add a customer message.
Click the Customer Message box, activate its drop-down list, and select a clever 
customer message. To add customer messages to the Customer Message list, 
select the Add New option and then fill in the dialog box that QuickBooks 
displays. Click OK when you’re done. (I know that I talk about the Customer 
Message box in Chapter 3, but I wanted to quickly describe how to add a 
customer message again so that you don’t have to flip back through a bunch of 
pages.)
18.	Specify the sales tax.
If you specified a tax rate in the Customer list, QuickBooks uses it as a default. 
If it isn’t correct, move the cursor to the Tax list box, activate the drop-down list, 
and select the correct sales tax.
19.	(Truly optional) Add a memo.
You can add a memo description to the invoice if you want to. This memo 
doesn’t print in invoices — only in the Customer Statement. Memo descrip-
tions give you a way of storing information related to an invoice with that 
invoice. Figure 4-2 shows a completed Create Invoices window.
20.	If you want to delay printing this invoice, select the Print Later check box 
that appears on the ribbon of buttons and boxes above the main part of 
the Create Invoices window.
I want to postpone talking about what selecting the Print Later check box does 
until I finish the discussion of invoice creation. I talk about printing invoices a 
little later in the chapter. I promise.

90      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
21.	Save the invoice by clicking the Save & New button or the Save & Close 
button at the bottom of the window.
QuickBooks saves the invoice that’s onscreen. If you click Save & New, 
QuickBooks displays an empty Create Invoices window so that you can create 
another invoice.
You can page back and forth through invoices that you created earlier by clicking 
the Next and Previous buttons (which look like left and right arrows).
The History panel that appears along the right edge of the Create Invoices window 
provides two tabs that are useful when you’re creating invoices. The Customer tab 
(shown in Figures 4-1 and 4-2) provides high-level summary information about 
the customer. The Transaction tab (not shown) provides more detailed informa-
tion about the customer’s activity and buttons you can click to drill down into the 
details.
When you’re done creating invoices, you can click the invoice form’s Save & Close 
button or press the Escape key.

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      91
Fixing Invoice Mistakes
I’m not a perfect person. You’re — well, you know this right? — not a perfect 
person. Heck, nobody is; everyone makes mistakes. You don’t need to get worked 
up over mistakes that you make while entering information in invoices, though, 
because in the following sections, I show you how to fix the most common mis-
takes that you might make in your invoices.
If the invoice is still displayed onscreen
If the invoice is still displayed onscreen, you can just move the cursor to the box 
or button that’s wrong and then fix the mistake. Because most of the bits of infor-
mation that you enter in the Create Invoices window are short and sweet, you can 
easily replace the contents of some fields by typing over whatever’s already there. 
To start all over again, just click the Clear button at the bottom of the screen. To 
save the invoice after you’ve made your changes, click the Save & New button.
If you need to insert a line into the middle of the invoice, right-click to display a 
contextual menu and then choose Insert Line or Delete Line.
If the invoice isn’t displayed onscreen
If the invoice isn’t displayed onscreen, and you haven’t yet printed it, you can use 
the Next and Previous buttons (which appear on the Main tab and show pictures 
of left-pointing and right-pointing arrows) to page through the invoices. When 
you get to the one with the error, simply fix the error as I describe in the preceding 
section. If you make an error fixing the invoice, you can click the Revert button to 
go back to the saved invoice. The Revert button replaces the Clear button when 
you’re viewing an existing invoice — that is, an invoice that you’ve already saved.
If you printed the invoice, you also can make the sort of change that I describe in 
the preceding paragraphs. You can page through the invoices until you find the 
one (now printed) that has the error, for example, and then correct the error and 
print the invoice again. I’m not so sure that you want to go this route if you’ve 
already sent the invoice, however. You may want to consider fixing the invoice by 
issuing either a credit memo (if the original invoice overcharged) or another 
invoice (if the original invoice undercharged). The reason why I suggest issuing a 
credit memo or another invoice is that life gets awfully messy if you and your 
customer have multiple copies of the same invoice floating around and causing 
confusion. (I show you how to issue a credit memo in the appropriately titled sec-
tion “Preparing a Credit Memo” later in this chapter.)

92      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Deleting an invoice
I hesitate to mention this, but you also can delete invoices. Procedurally, deleting 
an invoice is easy. You just display the invoice in the Create Invoices window and 
then click the Delete button or choose Edit ➪ Delete Invoice. When QuickBooks 
asks you to confirm your deletion, click Yes. Read the following paragraph first, 
though, because you may not want to delete the invoice.
Even though deleting invoices is easy, it isn’t something that you should do casu-
ally or for fun. Deleting an invoice is okay if you’ve just created it, only you have 
seen it, and you haven’t yet printed it. In this case, no one needs to know that 
you’ve made a mistake. It’s your secret. The rest of the time — even if you create 
an invoice that you don’t want later — you should keep a copy of the invoice in the 
QuickBooks system. Doing so gives a record that the invoice existed, which usually 
makes it easier to answer questions later.
“But how do I correct my books if I leave the bogus invoice?” you ask.
Good question. To correct your financial records for the invoice that you don’t 
want to count anymore, simply void the invoice. The invoice remains in the Quick-
Books system, but QuickBooks doesn’t count it because the invoice loses its quan-
tity and amount information. Good news — voiding an invoice is as simple as 
deleting one. Just display the invoice in the Create Invoices window and then 
choose Edit ➪ Void Invoice. Or click the drop-down arrow below the Delete button 
and choose Void from the menu that QuickBooks displays.
Preparing a Credit Memo
Credit memos can be handy ways to fix data-entry mistakes that you didn’t find 
or correct earlier. Credit memos are also handy ways to handle things like cus-
tomer returns and refunds. If you’ve prepared an invoice or two in your time, 
you’ll find that preparing a QuickBooks credit memo is a lot easier than using old-
fashioned methods.
In the following steps, I describe how to create the most complicated and involved 
kind of credit memo: a product credit memo. Creating a service or professional credit 
memo works basically the same way, however. You just fill in fewer fields.
To create a product credit memo, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Customers ➪ Create Credit Memos/Refunds or click the Refunds 
& Credits icon in the Customer section of the home page to display the 
Create Credit Memos/Refunds window (as shown in Figure 4-3).

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      93
2.	 Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job in the Customer:Job 
drop-down list.
You can select the customer or job from the list by clicking it.
3.	 (Optional) Specify a class for the credit memo.
If you’re using classes to categorize transactions, activate the Class drop-down 
list and choose the appropriate class for the credit memo.
4.	 Date the credit memo (although going steady is optional).
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then enter the correct date 
in MM/DD/YYYY format. You also can use the secret date-editing codes that I 
describe in the section “Preparing an Invoice” earlier in the chapter. Oh, boy.
5.	 (Optional) Enter a credit memo number.
QuickBooks suggests a credit memo number by adding 1 to the last credit 
memo number you used. You can accept the number or tab to the Credit No. 
text box to change the number to whatever you want.
6.	 Fix the Customer address, if necessary.
QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list. You can change 
the address for the credit memo by replacing some portion of the usual billing 
address. Typically, you should use the same address for the credit memo that 
you use for the original invoice or invoices.
FIGURE 4-3: 
The Create Credit 
Memos/Refunds 
window.

94      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
7.	 (Optional . . . sort of) Provide the PO number.
If the credit memo adjusts the total remaining balance on a customer PO, you 
should probably enter the number of the PO into the P.O. No. text box.
Here’s my logic on this suggestion, for those readers who care: If you billed 
your customer $1,000 on P.O. No. 1984, which authorizes a $1,000 purchase, 
you used up the entire PO — at least according to the customer’s accounts 
payable clerk, who processes your invoices. If you make sure that a credit 
memo for $1,000 is identified as being related to P.O. No. 1984, however, you 
essentially free up the $1,000 purchase balance, which might mean that you 
can use, or bill on, the PO again.
8.	 If the customer returns items, describe each item.
Move the cursor to the first row of the Item/Description/ Qty/Rate/Amount/Tax 
text box. In the first empty row of the box, activate the Item drop-down list and 
then select the item. After you select it, QuickBooks fills in the Description and 
Rate text boxes with whatever sales description and sales price you entered in 
the Item list. (You can edit this information if you want, but it isn’t necessary.) 
Enter the number of items that the customer is returning (or not paying for) in 
the Qty text box. (After you enter this number, QuickBooks calculates the 
amount by multiplying Qty by Rate.) Enter each item that the customer is 
returning by filling in the empty rows of the list box.
In the case of inventory items, QuickBooks assumes that the items you’re 
showing on a credit memo are returned to inventory. You want to adjust your 
inventory physical counts if unsold items are returned.
As with invoices, you can put as many items in a credit memo as you want. If 
you don’t have enough room on a single page, QuickBooks keeps adding pages 
to the credit memo until you’re finished. The total information, of course, goes 
on the last page.
9.	 Describe any special items that the credit memo should include.
If you want to issue a credit memo for other items that appear in the original 
invoice — freight, discounts, other charges, and so on — add descriptions of 
each item to the Item list.
To add descriptions of these items, activate the Item drop-down list of the next 
empty row and then select the special item. (You activate the list by clicking the 
field once to turn it into a drop-down list and then clicking the field’s down 
arrow to access the list.) After QuickBooks fills in the Description and Rate text 
boxes, edit this information (if necessary). Enter each special item — subtotal, 
discount, freight, and so on — that you’re itemizing in the credit memo.
If you want to include a Discount item, you need to stick a Subtotal item in the 
credit memo after the inventory or other items that you’ve discounted. Then 
stick a Discount item directly after the Subtotal item. When you do this, 
QuickBooks calculates the discount as a percentage of the subtotal.

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      95
10.	(Optional) Add a customer message.
Activate the Customer Message list, and select a clever customer message.
11.	Specify the sales tax.
Move the cursor to the Tax list box, activate the list box, and then select the 
correct sales tax.
12.	(Optional, but a really good idea . . .) Add a memo.
You can use the Memo text box to add a memo description to the credit 
memo. You might use this description to explain your reasons for issuing the 
credit memo and to cross-reference the original invoice or invoices, for 
example. Note that the Memo field prints in the Customer Statement.
13.	If you want to delay printing this credit memo, select the Print Later 
check box.
I want to postpone talking about what selecting the Print Later check box does 
until I finish the discussion of credit memo creation. Coverage of printing 
invoices and credit memos comes up in a later section.
14.	Save the credit memo.
To save a completed credit memo, click either the Save & New or Save & Close 
button. QuickBooks then displays a dialog box that asks what you want to do 
with the credit memo: Retain the credit, give a refund, or apply the credit to an 
invoice. Make your choice by clicking the button that corresponds to what you 
want to do. If you choose Apply to Invoice, QuickBooks asks for some addi-
tional information. QuickBooks then saves the credit memo that’s onscreen 
and, if you clicked Save & New, displays an empty Create Credit Memos/
Refunds window so that you can create another credit memo. (Note that you 
can page back and forth through credit memos that you created earlier by 
clicking the Next and Previous buttons.) When you’re done creating credit 
memos, you can click the credit memo form’s Close button.
If you indicate that you want to print a refund check, QuickBooks displays the 
Write Checks window and automatically fills out the check, linking it to the 
memo.
Fixing Credit Memo Mistakes
Sure, I can repeat the same information that I give you in “Fixing Invoice Mis-
takes,” earlier in this chapter, and leave you with a strange feeling of déjà vu. But 
I won’t.

96      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Here’s everything you need to know about fixing credit memo mistakes: You can 
fix credit memo mistakes the same way that you fix invoice mistakes. If you need 
more help, refer to the earlier section “Fixing Invoice Mistakes.”
History Lessons
Would you mind doing a small favor for me? Take another peek at the images 
shown in Figures 4-1, 4-2, and 4-3. See that panel of customer history informa-
tion along the right edge of the window? I want to make a couple of quick points 
about this bit of the QuickBooks window.
First, QuickBooks lets you add and remove this historical information about a 
customer from the Create Invoices window, the Create Credit Memos/Refunds 
window, and most other customer information windows. To alternately add and 
then remove historical information about a customer to a window, click the 
arrowhead button that appears in the top-left corner of the panel next to the cus-
tomer name.
A second quick point: If you have a minute or two, after you’ve used QuickBooks a 
bit, go ahead and click the buttons that appear inside the historical-information 
panel. These buttons allow you to drill down and get more information about a 
listed transaction, for example.
Printing Invoices and Credit Memos
As part of setting up QuickBooks, you selected an invoice type. I assume that you 
have the raw paper stock for whatever invoice type you chose. If you’re going to 
print on blank letterhead, for example, I assume that you have letterhead lying 
around. If you decide to use preprinted forms, I assume that you’ve ordered those 
forms and have received them.
I also assume that you’ve already set up your printer. If you’ve ever printed any-
thing, your printer is already set up. Really.
Loading the forms into the printer
This part is easy. Simply load the invoice forms into the printer the same way you 
always load paper. Because you have one of about a jillion different printers, 
I can’t give you the precise steps that you need to follow, but if you’ve used a 
printer a bit, you should have no problem.

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      97
Wait a minute. What’s that? Your printer is brand-new, and you’ve never used it 
before? Okay, here’s one of my weird ideas: Use a pencil or something else that’s 
heat-resistant (so that it won’t melt and gum up the insides of the printer) to 
draw an arrow on a piece of paper. (Do not — repeat, do not — use crayon. And 
don’t let your children watch you do this.) Draw the arrow so that it points toward 
the top edge of the paper. Load the paper into the printer, with the arrow face up, 
and note the direction in which the arrow is pointing. Print something. Anything. 
When the paper comes out, notice whether the image faces in the same direction 
as the arrow and whether it’s on the same side of the paper as the arrow. With this 
information and a little logic, you can figure out how to load forms correctly.
Setting up the invoice printer
You need to set up the invoice printer only once, but you need to specify a handful 
of general invoice-printing rules. These rules also apply to credit memos and pur-
chase orders, by the way.
To set up your printer for invoice printing, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose File ➪ Printer Setup.
2.	 From the Form Name drop-down list, select Invoice.
QuickBooks displays the Printer Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-4.
3.	 Select the printer that you want to use to print invoices.
Activate the Printer Name drop-down list to see the installed printers. Select 
the one that you want to use for printing invoices and purchase orders.
FIGURE 4-4: 
The Printer Setup 
dialog box.

98      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
4.	 (Optional) Select the printer type.
The Printer Type drop-down list describes the kind of paper that your printer 
uses. You have two choices:
•	 Continuous: Your paper comes as one connected ream with perforated 
edges.
•	 Page-Oriented: Your paper is in single sheets.
5.	 Select the type of invoice form.
Select the option button that describes the type of form that you want to print 
on: Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or Letterhead. Then select the Do Not 
Print Lines around Each Field check box if you don’t like the nice little boxes 
that QuickBooks creates to separate each field.
For more on these types of forms, read the nearby sidebar “What am I  
printing on?”
6.	 (Optional, but a really good idea) Print a test invoice on real invoice 
paper.
Click the Align button. When QuickBooks displays the Align Printer dialog box, 
choose the type of invoice that you want to print and then click OK. When 
QuickBooks displays the Fine Alignment dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-5, 
click the Print Sample button to tell QuickBooks to print a dummy invoice on 
whatever paper you’ve loaded in the invoice printer.
The dummy invoice that QuickBooks prints gives you a chance to see what 
your invoices will look like. The invoice also has a set of alignment gridlines that 
prints over the Bill To text box. You can use these gridlines if you need to 
fine-align your printer.
7.	 Fix any form-alignment problems.
If you see any alignment problems after you complete Step 6, you need to fix 
them. (Alignment problems usually occur only with impact printers. With laser 
printers or inkjet printers, sheets of paper feed into the printer the same way 
every time, so you almost never need to fiddle with the form alignment.)
FIGURE 4-5: 
The Fine 
Alignment  
dialog box.

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      99
To fix any big alignment problems — like stuff printing in the wrong place — 
you need to adjust how the paper feeds into the printer. When you finally get 
the paper loaded as best you can, be sure to note exactly how you have it 
loaded. You need to have the printer and paper set up the same way every 
time you print.
For minor (but nonetheless annoying) alignment problems, use the Fine 
Alignment dialog box’s Vertical and Horizontal boxes to adjust the form’s 
alignment. Then print another sample invoice. Go ahead and experiment a bit. 
You need to fine-tune the printing of the invoice form only once. Click OK in  
the Fine Alignment dialog box when you finish to return to the Printer Setup 
dialog box.
Clicking the Options button in the Printer Setup dialog box (refer to Figure 4-4) 
opens the selected printer’s Windows printer setup information, where you 
can do such things as specify quality settings or print order. Because this 
information relates to Windows and not to QuickBooks, I’m not going to 
explain it. If you’re the curious type, or if you accidentally click it and then have 
questions about what you see, refer either to your Windows user’s guide or the 
printer’s user’s guide.
8.	 Save your printer settings stuff.
After you finish fiddling with all the Printer Setup dialog box settings, click OK to 
save your changes.
If you always want to use some particular settings to print a particular form 
(maybe you always print two copies of an invoice, for example), see the 
“Customizing Your Invoices and Credit Memos” section later in this chapter.
You can print invoices and credit memos one at a time or in a batch. How you print 
them makes no difference to QuickBooks or to me, your humble author. Pick 
whatever way seems to fit your style best. The following sections show you how.
Printing invoices and credit memos  
as you create them
If you want to print invoices and credit memos as you create them, follow these 
steps:
1.	 Click the Print button after you create the invoice or credit memo.
After you fill in the boxes of the Create Invoices window (refer to Figure 4-2) or 
the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window (refer to Figure 4-3), click the Print 
button. QuickBooks, ever the faithful servant, displays either the Print One 
Invoice dialog box (as shown in Figure 4-6) or the Print One Credit Memo/
Refund dialog box, which looks almost like the Print One Invoice dialog box.

100      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
2.	 (Optional) Select the type of invoice or credit memo form.
If you’re using a different type of invoice or credit memo form than you’ve 
described for the invoice printer setup, select the type of form that you want to 
print from the Print On option button choices. You can select Intuit Preprinted 
Forms, Blank Paper, or Letterhead.
You shouldn’t have to worry about printing test invoice or credit memo forms 
or fiddling with form-alignment problems if you addressed these issues when 
you set up the invoice printer, so I’m not going to talk about the Align button 
here. If you want to do this kind of stuff and you need help, refer to the 
preceding section, “Setting up the invoice printer,” in which I describe how to 
print test forms and fix form-alignment problems.
3.	 Print the form.
Click the Print button to send the form to the printer.
4.	 Review the invoice or credit memo, and reprint the form if necessary.
Review the invoice or credit memo to see whether QuickBooks printed it 
correctly. If the form looks wrong, fix whatever caused the problem (perhaps 
you printed it on the wrong paper, for example) and reprint the form by 
clicking the Print button again.
Printing invoices in a batch
If you want to print invoices in a batch, you need to check the Print Later check 
box that appears on the Create Invoices window’s ribbon. This check mark tells 
QuickBooks to put a copy of the invoice in a special invoices-to-be-printed list.
FIGURE 4-6: 
The Print 
One Invoice  
dialog box.

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      101
When you later want to print the invoices-to-be-printed list, follow these steps:
1.	 Display the Create Invoices window (choose Customers ➪ Create 
Invoices), click the arrow next to the Print button, and choose Batch from 
the drop-down list.
QuickBooks displays the Select Invoices to Print dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 4-7. This box lists all the invoices that you’ve marked as Print Later and 
haven’t yet printed.
2.	 Select the invoices that you want to print.
Initially, QuickBooks marks all the invoices with a check mark, indicating that 
they’ll be printed. You can select and deselect individual invoices on the list by 
WHAT AM I PRINTING ON?
Sometimes, people get confused about the differences among preprinted forms, letter-
head, and plain paper. Here’s the scoop: Preprinted forms have your company name, 
perhaps your logo, and a bunch of other boxes and lines (often in another color of ink) 
already printed on them. Preprinted forms are often multipart forms. (If you happen to 
buy QuickBooks in a store, examples of preprinted forms come in the QuickBooks box.)
Letterhead is what you usually use for letters that you write. It has your company name 
and address on it, for example, but nothing else. To save you from having to purchase 
preprinted forms, QuickBooks enables you to use letterhead to create invoices and 
forms. (To make the letterhead look a little more bookkeeperish, QuickBooks draws 
lines and boxes on the letterhead so that it looks sort of like a preprinted invoice.)
Plain paper is . . . well, plain paper. Nothing is printed on it. So QuickBooks needs to print 
everything: your company name, all the invoice stuff, and (optionally) lines and boxes. 
Not that you care, but in my CPA practice, I use high-quality plain paper to bill my clients 
and find that approach works just great.
FIGURE 4-7: 
The Select 
Invoices to Print

clicking them. You also can click the Select All button (to mark all the invoices) 
or the Select None button (to deselect all the invoices).
3.	 Click OK.
After you correctly mark all the invoices you want to print — and none of the 
ones you don’t want to print — click OK. QuickBooks displays the Print Invoices 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-8.
4.	 (Optional) Select the type of invoice form.
If you use a different type of invoice form from the type you described during 
invoice setup, select the type of form that you want to print on by using the 
Print On options. You can choose Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or 
Letterhead.
For more on these types of forms, read the sidebar “What am I printing on?” 
earlier in this chapter.
5.	 Print the forms.
Click the Print button to send the selected invoice forms to the printer. 
QuickBooks prints the forms and then displays a message box that asks 
whether the forms printed correctly.
6.	 Review the invoice forms, and reprint them if necessary.
Review the invoices to see whether QuickBooks printed them all correctly. If all 
the forms look okay, click OK in the message box. If one or more forms don’t 
look okay, enter the invoice number of the first incorrect form in the message 
box. Then fix whatever problem fouled up the form (perhaps you printed it on 
the wrong paper, for example) and reprint the bad form(s) by clicking the Print 
button again. (The Print button is in the Print Invoices dialog box.)

dialog box.

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      103
Printing credit memos in a batch
If you want to print credit memos in a batch, you need to select the Print Later 
check box that appears on the Main tab of the Create Credit Memos/Refunds 
­window. Selecting this check box tells QuickBooks to put a copy of the credit memo 
on a special credit memos to-be-printed list.
Printing credit memos in a batch works similarly to printing invoices in a batch. 
Because I describe how to print invoices in a batch in the preceding section, in this 
section, I speed through a description of printing credit memos in a batch. If you 
get lost or have questions, refer to the preceding section.
When you’re ready to print the credit memos that are in the to-be-printed list, 
follow these steps:
1.	 Display the Create Credit Memos/Refunds window (refer to Figure 4-3), 
click the down arrow next to the Print button, and select Batch from the 
drop-down list.
QuickBooks displays the Select Credit Memos to Print dialog box (not shown).
2.	 Select the credit memos that you want to print.
3.	 Click OK to display the Print Credit Memos dialog box (not shown).
4.	 Use the Print Credit Memos dialog box to describe how you want your 
credit memos to be printed.
5.	 Click the Print button to send the selected credit memos to the printer.
QuickBooks prints the credit memos.
Sending Invoices and Credit Memos  
via Email
If you have email already set up on your computer, you can email invoices rather 
than print them right from inside QuickBooks. In this case, to email an invoice or 
credit memo, click the Email button, which appears on the Main tab of the Create 
Invoices window. QuickBooks displays the Send Invoice dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 4-9.

104      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
To send your invoice via email, enter the email address of the business that you 
want to bill or refund money to, edit the message as appropriate (make sure to 
click that Check Spelling button), and then click the Send button.
If you don’t yet have email set up on your computer, you can click the Edit ➪  
Preferences command and select Send Forms to use a third-party webmail account 
(like Google Gmail) or the QuickBooks Email service. To tell QuickBooks about a 
webmail account, click the Webmail option button; click the Add button; and then, 
when prompted, fill in the boxes of the dialog box that QuickBooks displays. To 
tell QuickBooks about any Intuit Email subscription you have, click the Check for 
Valid Subscriptions button, and follow the onscreen instructions.
You can also fax invoices and credit memos from inside QuickBooks if you have 
fax-transmission software installed. To do this, click the Print button at the top of 
the Create Invoices or Create Credit Memos/Refunds window, choose your fax 
software from the Printer Name drop-down list, and then use the wizard that 
appears to send the fax via your modem. (Transmission charges may apply.)
You can also save the invoice as a PDF document and then use your regular email 
program to send the PDF to a customer.
FIGURE 4-9: 
The Send Invoice 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 4  Creating Invoices and Credit Memos      105
Customizing Your Invoices  
and Credit Memos
With QuickBooks, you can easily customize the invoice and credit memo tem-
plates, or you can create new invoices and credit memos based on one of the exist-
ing QuickBooks templates. All you have to do is open the form that you want to 
customize, click the Formatting tab, and then click the Customize Design button. 
QuickBooks displays an Intuit web page that walks you through the steps for cre-
ating your own highly customized form (see Figure 4-10).
Alternatively, you can click the Formatting tab and then click its Customize Data 
Layout button. When QuickBooks asks whether you’re okay with working with a 
copy of the default form template, click the Make Copy button. QuickBooks dis-
plays the Additional Customization dialog box (shown in Figure 4-11), which pro-
vides a bunch of check boxes and text boxes you can use to customize away. The 
Additional Customization dialog box also provides a Preview area that shows what 
your customizations look like, so go hog-wild, and be adventurous. (If you make 
a mess, just click Cancel to abandon your customized changes. Then, if you want, 
restart the process — perhaps a bit wiser and smarter for the experience.)

tion web page.

106      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
If you’re creating a new invoice form by using the Additional Customization dialog 
box, you can click its Layout Designer button at the bottom to open the Layout 
Designer window. In this window, you can become a true layout artist and observe 
how the overall look of your invoice changes when you move fields around the 
page with your mouse.

ou need to record the amounts that customers pay you when they fork over 
cash, at the time of a sale or after you invoice them. In this chapter, I describe 
how to record these payments. I also explain how to make bank deposits, 
track the amounts that customers owe and pay, and assess finance charges.
If you’ve been using QuickBooks to prepare customer invoices, you’re ready to 
begin recording payments. You’ll have no problem. If you haven’t been invoicing 
customers, you need to make sure that you have a couple of things ready to go 
before you can record cash sales.
First, you need to make sure that your lists are up to date. (I describe updating 
these lists in Chapter 3.) Second, if you want to print sales receipts, you need to 
have your printer set up to print them. You do so by choosing File ➪ Printer Setup 
and then selecting Sales Receipt from the Form Name drop-down list. Setting up 
your printer to print sales receipts works just like setting it up to print invoices 
and credit memos (as I describe in Chapter 4).
Chapter 5

108      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Recording a Sales Receipt
You record a sales receipt when a customer pays you in full for the goods at the 
point of sale. Sales receipts work similarly to regular invoices (which you use 
when you first bill, or invoice, a customer and then later receive payment on the 
invoice). In fact, the big difference between the two types of sales receipts and 
invoices is that sales receipts are recorded in a way that changes your cash balance 
rather than your accounts receivable balance.
In the following steps, I describe how to record sales receipts for products, which 
are the most complicated type of cash sale. Recording sales receipts for services 
works basically the same way, however. You simply fill in fewer fields.
1.	 Do one of the following:
•	 Choose Customers ➪ Enter Sales Receipts.
•	 On the home screen, click the Create Sales Receipts icon.
•	 In the Customer Center, choose the customer from the list and then 
choose New Transactions ➪ Sales Receipts.
The Enter Sales Receipts window appears, as shown in Figure 5-1.
FIGURE 5-1: 
The Enter Sales 
Receipts window, 
strangely empty 
and perhaps a bit 
lonely.

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      109
Your Enter Sales Receipts window may not look exactly like mine for a couple 
of reasons. QuickBooks customizes (and you can customize) its forms to fit 
your particular type of business.
Customizing sales receipt forms works in a similar way to customizing invoices 
and credit memos, as I describe in Chapter 4. If your Enter Sales Receipts 
window includes more fields than I describe here, you can turn to that chapter 
for help on how to fill out the additional fields or turn them off.
2.	 Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job.
Activate the Customer:Job drop-down list by clicking the down arrow to the 
right of the box. Scroll through the Customer:Job list until you see the customer 
or job name that you want and then click it. Note that unlike with invoices, the 
Customer:Job field isn’t required for cash sales.
3.	 (Optional) Specify a class for the sales receipt.
If you’re using classes to categorize transactions, activate the Class drop-down 
list and select the appropriate class for the sales receipt. (I don’t show the Class 
list box in Figure 5-1, so don’t look for it there.)
4.	 Date the sales receipt.
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box. Then type the correct 
date in MM/DD/YYYY format. You can change the date by using any of the 
date-editing codes. (You can find these codes in Chapter 4 and on the online 
Cheat Sheet for this book at www.dummies.com.)
5.	 (Optional) Enter a sale number.
QuickBooks suggests a sale number by adding 1 to the last sale number you 
used. Use this number or tab to the Sale No. text box and change the number 
to whatever you want.
6.	 Fix the Sold To address, if necessary.
QuickBooks grabs the billing address from the Customer list and uses the 
billing address as the Sold To address. You can change the address for the cash 
sale, however, by replacing the appropriate part of the usual billing address.
7.	 Record the check number.
Enter the customer’s check number in the Check No. text box. If the customer 
is paying you with cold, hard cash, you can leave the Check No. text box empty.
8.	 Specify the payment method.
To specify the payment method, activate the Payment Method drop-down list 
(by clicking the More button shown in Figure 5-1) and then select something 
from it: cash, check, Visa, MasterCard, or whatever. If you don’t see the 
payment method that you want to use, you can add the method to the 

110      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Payment Method list. Choose Add New to display the New Payment Method 
dialog box. Enter a description of the payment method in the text box, and 
click OK.
9.	Describe each item that you’re selling.
Move the cursor to the first row of the Item/Description/Qty/Rate/Amount/Tax 
list box. When you do, QuickBooks turns the Item field into a drop-down list. 
Activate the Item drop-down list of the first empty row in the list box and then 
select the item. When you do, QuickBooks fills in the Description and Rate text 
boxes with whatever sales description and sales price you entered in the Item 
list. (You can edit this information if you want, but that probably isn’t neces-
sary.) Enter the number of items sold in the Qty text box. Describe each of the 
other items you’re selling by filling in the next empty rows of the list box.
If you add an inventory item to an invoice, QuickBooks adds a small button to 
the Quantity field when the cursor rests on the Quantity field. If you click the 
button, QuickBooks displays a window that describes the on-hand quantities of 
the inventory item.
If you’ve already read the chapter on invoicing customers (Chapter 4), what I’m 
about to tell you will seem very familiar: You can put as many items in a sales 
receipt as you want. If you don’t have enough room on a single page, 
QuickBooks adds as many pages as you need to the receipt. The sales receipt 
total, of course, goes on the last page.
10.	Describe any special items that the sales receipt should include.
If you didn’t set up the QuickBooks item file, you have no idea what I’m talking 
about. Here’s the scoop: QuickBooks thinks that anything that you stick in a 
receipt (or an invoice, for that matter) is something that you’re selling. If you 
sell blue, yellow, and red thingamajigs, you obviously need to add each of 
these items to the Item list. But if you add freight charges to your receipt, 
QuickBooks thinks that these charges are just another thingamajig and 
requires you to enter another item in the list. The same is true for a volume 
discount that you want to stick in the receipt. And if you add sales tax to your 
receipt, well, guess what? QuickBooks thinks that the sales tax is just another 
item that needs to be included in the Item list. (For more information about 
working with your Item list and adding new items, refer to Chapter 3.)
To include one of these special items, move the cursor to the next empty row 
in the Item box, activate the drop-down list by clicking the arrow on the right 
side of the box, and then select the special item. After QuickBooks fills in the 
Description and Rate text boxes, you may need to edit this information. Enter 
each special item — subtotals, discounts, freight, and so on — that you’re 
itemizing on the receipt by filling in the next empty row of the list box.

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      111
If you selected the Taxable check box when you added the item to the Item list, 
the word Tax appears in the Tax column to indicate that the item will be taxed.
If you want to include a discount item (so that all the listed items are dis-
counted), you need to stick a subtotal item in the receipt after the inventory 
items or other items you want to discount. Then stick the discount item directly 
after the subtotal item. When you do, QuickBooks calculates the discount as a 
percentage of the subtotal.
11.	(Optional) Add a customer message.
Click the Customer Message box, activate its drop-down list, and select a clever 
customer message. To add customer messages to the customer message list, 
select Add New. When QuickBooks displays the New Customer Message box, 
fill it in and then click OK.
12.	Specify the sales tax.
If you specify tax information when you create your company file during 
QuickBooks Setup — remember how QuickBooks asked whether you charge 
sales tax? — QuickBooks fills in the default tax information by adding the 
taxable items (which are indicated by the word Tax in the Tax column) and 
multiplying by the percentage you indicated when you created your company 
file. If the information is okay, move on to Step 13. If not, move the cursor to 
the Tax box that’s below the Customer Message box, activate the drop-down 
list, and choose the correct sales tax. For more information about setting a 
default sales tax for a customer in the Customer list, read Chapter 3.
13.	(Truly optional and probably unnecessary for cash sales) Add a memo in 
the Memo text box.
You can include a memo description with the cash-sale information. This 
memo isn’t for your customer. It doesn’t even print on the cash receipt, should 
you decide to print one. The memo is for your eyes only. Memo descriptions 
give you a way to store information that’s related to a sale with the sales 
receipt information.
14.	Decide whether you’re going to print the receipt.
If you aren’t going to print the receipt, make sure that the Print Later check box 
is empty; if not, deselect it to remove the check mark.
Figure 5-2 shows a completed Enter Sales Receipts window.

112      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
15.	Save the sales receipt.
To save a completed sales receipt, click either the Save & Close button or the 
Save & New button. QuickBooks saves the sales receipt that’s onscreen and 
then, if you clicked Save & New, displays an empty Enter Sales Receipts window 
so that you can create another sales receipt. (Note that you can page back and 
forth through receipts that you created earlier by clicking the Next and 
Previous buttons; you can display and remove historical information for the 
selected customer by clicking the Show History button. The Show History 
button is the little arrow to the right of the Template name field in the top-right 
corner of the screen.) When you’re done creating sales receipts, click the Enter 
Sales Receipts window’s Close button.
Printing a Sales Receipt
To print a single sales receipt as you’re recording the information, click the Print 
button in the Enter Sales Receipts window. The Print One Sales Receipt dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 5-3.
FIGURE 5-2: 
The completed 
Enter Sales 
Receipts window.

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      113
To complete this dialog box, follow these steps:
1.	 Select the type of sales receipt form.
If you’re using a different sales receipt form type from the type you described 
for the invoice/purchase order (PO) printer setup, select the type of form that 
you want to print on by selecting an option button in the Print On section. You 
can choose Intuit Preprinted Forms, Blank Paper, or Letterhead. (See Chapter 4 
for more on these printer options.)
You shouldn’t have to worry about printing test receipts or fiddling with 
form-alignment problems if you addressed these issues during the invoice/PO 
printer setup, so I’m not going to talk about the Align button here. If you want 
to print a test receipt or need to change the alignment, read Chapter 4 for 
details on how to proceed.
2.	 Print that puppy!
Click the Print button to send the form to the printer. QuickBooks prints the 
sales receipt.
3.	 Review the sales receipt, and reprint the form if necessary.
Review the sales receipt to see whether QuickBooks printed it correctly. If the 
form doesn’t look okay, fix whatever problem fouled up the printing; perhaps 
you forgot to include the company name and address, for example. Then 
reprint the form by clicking the Print button (in the Enter Sales Receipts window) 
again, selecting the form on which you want to print (again), and then clicking 
the Print button in the Print One Sales Receipt dialog box (you got it — again).
To print a batch of receipts, make sure that you select the Print Later check box on 
each receipt that you want to print and then display the Enter Sales Receipts win-
dow; click the arrow beside the Print button, and choose Batch from the drop-
down list. QuickBooks displays the Select Receipts to Print dialog box, which 
FIGURE 5-3: 
The Print One 
Sales Receipt 
dialog box.

114      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
enables you to choose which receipts to print. Select the desired receipts by put-
ting a check mark in the first column and then click OK. The Print Sales Receipts 
dialog box appears. This dialog box resembles the Print One Sales Receipt dialog 
box in just about every way, and the instructions work in exactly the same man-
ner. For help with this dialog box, refer to the sections on printing invoices and 
credit memos in batches in Chapter 4.
Special Tips for Retailers
Are you a retailer? If so, you’re probably saying, “Hey, idiot, what you just 
described is way too much work to do every time someone walks into the store and 
buys some $3 item.”
You know what? You’re right. So here’s what retailers do to record their sales. 
Retailers record the day’s sales by using one, two, or three sales receipt transac-
tions. Retailers don’t record each individual sales receipt transaction.
Say that some coffee-mug retailer sold 200 red coffee mugs for the day for $3 
each. In that case, at the end of the day, the retailer needs to record total sales of 
$600 and then the sales tax. With these example numbers, the daily sales would 
be recorded using a sales receipt transaction like the one shown earlier in 
Figure 5-2.
Pretty straightforward, right? And that’s not too much work, all things consid-
ered. Let me share a handful of other tips for recording retail sales:
»
» You probably want to record a sales receipt transaction for each deposit 
you make. In this manner, you can indicate that a particular sales receipt 
transaction (really, a batch of sales) is deposited at one time into your bank 
account — which makes reconciling your bank account relatively easy.
»
» You probably want to separate cash sales from credit card sales because 
credit card sales are often handled differently. Your credit card processing 
company, for example, might hold on to credit card sales for a few days, or it 
might deduct a fee before depositing the money into your bank account. You 
want to record a separate sales receipt transaction for each deposit that you 
make (or some other company makes) into the bank account — again, to 
make reconciling the bank account easier.
»
» If you don’t use the Item list to monitor your inventory (because you 
have way too many items to store in the QuickBooks Item list), use 
items that are designated as noninventory parts. You might use noninven-
tory part items — such as daily cash sales, daily AmEx sales, and daily Visa/MC 

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      115
sales — if you make three deposits every day for cash and check sales, for 
American Express sales, and for Visa and MasterCard sales. If you don’t track 
inventory in your items file, your CPA handles the inventory and COGS (cost of 
goods sold) calculations on your tax return. He or she probably also records a 
journal entry transaction to get your account balances correct as of the end of 
your fiscal year. Note that QuickBooks may put a couple of noninventory part 
items on your Item list for just this purpose if you tell it that you’re a retailer 
(Total Sales – Non-Taxable and Total Sales – Taxable).
»
» You may want to look at the QuickBooks Point of Sale system. The 
QuickBooks Point of Sale system makes it easy to record cash-register sales 
quickly. QuickBooks Point of Sale comes in two flavors, both with scanners, 
cash drawers, and receipt printers. The low-end version syncs with QuickBooks 
Online. The high-end version syncs with QuickBooks Desktop. When you ring 
up a sale with the QuickBooks Point of Sale system, the software automatically 
records your sales and the effect on inventory and COGS.
»
» You may not want to use inventory items to track your inventory if 
you’re a retailer. You may instead want to use noninventory part items or 
generic noninventory part items. When you do, QuickBooks won’t track the 
quantity of items that sell — only the dollar amounts of your sales.
Correcting Sales Receipt Mistakes
If you make a mistake in entering a sales receipt (cash sale), don’t worry. Here’s 
a list of common problems and how to fix them:
»
» If the sales receipt is still displayed onscreen: If the sales receipt is still 
onscreen, you can move the cursor to the box or button that’s incorrect and 
then fix the mistake. Most of the bits of information that you enter in the 
Enter Sales Receipts window are fairly short or are entries that you’ve selected 
from a list. You can usually replace the contents of some field by typing over 
whatever’s already there or by making a couple of quick clicks. If you really 
messed up and want to start over from scratch, you can click the Clear button. 
To save a receipt after you’ve entered it correctly, click either the Save & Close 
button or the Save & New button.
If you need to insert a line into the middle of a sales receipt, right-click 
where you want to insert the line and choose Insert Line from the contextual 
menu. To delete a line, right-click it and then choose Delete Line from the 
contextual menu.

116      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
»
» If the sales receipt isn’t displayed onscreen: If the sales receipt isn’t 
onscreen, and you haven’t yet printed it, you can use the Next and Previous 
buttons to page through the sales receipts. When you get to the one with the 
error, fix the error as I describe in the preceding item. If you make a mistake 
while editing a receipt, you can click the Revert button to go back to the saved 
receipt without saving your changes. Note that Clear toggles to Revert after 
you edit a transaction.
Even if you printed the customer’s receipt, you can make the sort of change 
that I just described. You can page through the sales receipts by using the 
Next and Previous buttons until you find the receipt (now printed) with the 
error, for example, and then correct the error and print the receipt again. I’m 
not so sure that you want to go this route, however. Things will be much 
cleaner if you void the cash sale by displaying the sales receipt and choosing 
Edit ➪ Void Sales Receipt. Then enter a new, correct cash-sale transaction.
»
» If you don’t want the sales receipt: You usually won’t want to delete sales 
receipts, but you can delete them. (You’ll almost always be in much better 
shape if you just void the sales receipt.) To delete the receipt, display it in the 
Enter Sales Receipts window. (To do so, choose Customers ➪ Enter Sales 
Receipt and then page through the sales receipts by using the Next and 
Previous buttons until you see the cash sale that you want to delete.) Then 
choose Edit ➪ Delete Sales Receipt. When QuickBooks asks you to confirm the 
deletion, click Yes.
If you want to see a list of all your cash sales, choose Edit ➪ Find. The Simple 
Find screen appears. Select Sales Receipt from the Transaction Type list box and 
then click Find. Select the receipt you want to see from the list that appears. If 
you’re already viewing a sales receipt, choose Edit ➪ Find Sales Receipts. When 
you click the Find button, another screen pops up and asks for details of the 
sales receipt that you’re looking for. Click the Find button in that screen, and 
QuickBooks gives you a list of your cash sales for the criteria you selected.
Recording Customer Payments
If your customers don’t always pay you up front for their purchases, you need to 
record another type of payment: the payments that customers make to pay off or 
pay down what you’ve invoiced them. To record the payments, of course, you first 
need to record invoices for the customer. If you issue credit memos that customers 
can use to reduce the amounts they owe, you first need to record credit memos for 
each customer. (Check out Chapter 4 to find out how to create and record these 
items.) The rest is easy.

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      117
To access a wealth of customer information all on one page, click the Customers 
icon on the icon bar or choose Customers ➪ Customer Center. The Customer Center 
appears, listing outstanding balances for all customers and detailed information 
for the customer selected in the Customers & Jobs list.
To display the Receive Payments window, click the Receive Payments icon on the 
home screen or click the Customer Center icon and select the customer you need. 
Click New Transactions and Receive Payments or choose Customers ➪ Receive 
Payments from the top menus. Then describe the customer payment and the 
invoices paid. If you want the gory details, read through the following steps:
1.	 Choose Customers ➪ Receive Payments.
The Receive Payments window appears, as shown in Figure 5-4.
2.	 Identify the customer and, if necessary, the job.
Activate the Received From drop-down list and select the customer (and job, if 
necessary) by clicking its name. QuickBooks lists the open, or unpaid, invoices 
for the customer in the list box at the bottom of the window.
FIGURE 5-4: 
The Receive 
Payments 
window.

118      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
3.	 Enter the amount of the payment.
Move the cursor to the Payment Amount field, and type the customer payment 
amount. Note: If the customer is paying with a credit card, and your merchant 
bank deducts a fee from the individual payments, record the full amount of 
the payment on this payment screen and the merchant fee later, on the 
Deposit screen.
4.	 Specify the payment date.
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box (the one right above the 
Reference # text box), and type the correct date in MM/DD/YYYY format. To 
edit the date, you can use the secret date-editing codes that I describe in 
Chapter 4 and on the online Cheat Sheet for this book at www.dummies.com.
5.	 (Optional) Specify the payment method.
Click one of the payment buttons: Cash, Check, Credit Debit or e-Check. Or you 
can activate the Payment Method’s More drop-down list and choose a different 
payment method.
6.	 (Optional) Enter the check (reference) number.
This bit of information might be useful if you or the customer later ends up 
with questions about what checks paid for what invoices.
7.	 (Optional) Add a memo description.
Use the Memo description for storing some bit of information that will help 
you in some way. Note that this field prints on the customer statement.
8.	 If the customer has any outstanding credits, decide whether to apply 
them in this payment.
QuickBooks totals the amounts of any of the customer’s existing credits. They 
can be anything from an overpayment on a previous invoice to a return credit 
or anything else.
When you create a new invoice, QuickBooks notifies you that there are credits 
available on the customer’s account and asks whether you want to apply any 
of them to the new invoice.
If you want to apply a credit memo to a specific open invoice, select the invoice 
and then click the Discounts and Credits button on the ribbon. When QuickBooks 
displays the Credits tab of the Discount and Credits dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 5-5, click the credit memo that you want to apply and then click Done.
9.	 Identify which open invoices the customer is paying.
By default, QuickBooks automatically applies the payment to the open 
invoices, starting with the oldest open invoice. You can change this application 
by entering amounts in the Payment column. Simply click the open invoice’s 
payment amount and enter the correct amount.

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      119
You can leave a portion of the payment unapplied if you want to. QuickBooks 
then asks what you want to do with the overpayment: You can leave the 
amount on the account to be applied or refund the amount to the customer or 
client. By the way, if you record an underpayment, QuickBooks asks whether 
you want to just leave the unpaid amount sitting there or instead want to write 
off the remaining balance.
If you want to apply the customer payment to the oldest open invoices, click 
the Auto Apply Payment button on the ribbon. If you want to unapply pay-
ments that you’ve already applied to open invoices, click the Un-Apply Payment 
button. (Un-Apply Payment and Auto Apply Payment are the same button. 
QuickBooks changes the name of the button depending on whether you’ve 
already applied payments.)
10.	Adjust the early payment or other discounts, if necessary.
If you offer payment terms that include an early-payment discount, 
QuickBooks automatically reduces the open invoice original amount (shown in 
the Orig. Amt. column) by the early-payment discount that you specify to 
calculate the adjusted amount due (shown in the Amt. Due column) if the 
payment is dated within the discount period.
To specify any other discounts, select the open invoice that you want to adjust. 
Then click the Discounts and Credits button. With little or no hesitation, the 
Discount tab of the Discount and Credits dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 5-6. Type the dollar amount of the discount in the Amount of Discount 
text box. Then specify the expense account that you want to use to track 
FIGURE 5-5: 
The Credits tab 
of the Discount 
and Credits 
dialog box.

120      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
discounts by activating the Discount Account drop-down list and selecting one 
of the accounts. (Interest Expense is probably a good account to use unless 
you want to set up a special expense account called something like Discount 
Expense or Discounts Given.)
When you’re finished, click Done to return to the Receive Payments window. 
(For more information on the costs and benefits of early-payment discounts, 
see Chapter 20.)
11.	Record the customer payment information.
After you identify which invoices the customer is paying — the unapplied 
amount probably should appear as zero — you’re ready to record the cus-
tomer payment information. You can do so by clicking either the Save & New 
button or the Save & Close button. QuickBooks saves the customer payment 
shown onscreen. If you click Save & New, QuickBooks displays an empty 
Receive Payments window so that you can enter another payment.
You can return to customer payments you recorded earlier by clicking the Previous 
button.

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      121
Correcting Mistakes in Customer 
Payments Entries
You can correct mistakes that you make in entering customer payments in basi-
cally the same way that you correct mistakes that you make in entering cash sales.
First, you display the window you used to enter the transaction. In the case of 
customer payments, click the Customer Center icon and then select the customer 
you need. You see a list of that customer’s transactions on the right side. Double-
click the payment transaction you want to change, and the original payments 
screen appears. Make your changes. Then click Save & Close. Pretty straightfor-
ward, right?
If you’ve already recorded a deposit that includes the payment you want to delete 
or edit, you need to delete the deposit before you can delete or edit the payment.
Making Bank Deposits
Whenever you record a cash sale or a customer payment on an invoice, Quick-
Books adds the cash to its list of undeposited funds. These undeposited funds 
could be a bunch of checks that you haven’t yet deposited, or they could consist of 
coinage (currency and coins) or even credit card payments, if you accept them.
You can also tell QuickBooks to give you the choice of indicating that a particular 
payment or sales receipt is deposited directly into a specified account. To tell 
QuickBooks to give you this choice, choose Edit ➪ Preferences, scroll down to the 
Payments icon, click the Company Preferences tab, and then deselect the Use 
Undeposited Funds As a Default Deposit to Account option. After you make this 
change, QuickBooks adds buttons and a box to the bottom-left corner of the Enter 
Sales Receipts and Receive Payments windows so that you can indicate the bank 
account into which the money is deposited.
Eventually, though, you’ll want to take the money out from under your mattress 
and deposit it in the bank. To do so, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Make Deposits.
Alternatively, select Record Deposits on the home screen in the Banking 
section.
The Payments to Deposit dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-7. This 
dialog box initially lists all the payments, regardless of the payment method. 

122      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
You can, however, use the View Payment Method Type drop-down list to 
indicate that you want to see payments only of a particular type, such as credit 
card payments. (This feature can be pretty handy because it lets you batch all 
your credit card transactions together.)
2.	 Select the payments that you want to deposit.
Click a payment or cash receipt to place a check mark in front of it, marking it 
for deposit. If you want to deselect a payment, click it again. To deselect all the 
payments, click the Select None button. To select all the payments, click the 
Select All button. If you have gobs of payments to look through, you can also 
filter the list by clicking View Payment Method Type at the top and see only the 
Cash or Credit Cards to select among. If you’re recording credit card payments 
deposited, you don’t also need to sort through the check payments. They aren’t 
gone; they just don’t appear until you select that type of payment or All.
3.	 Click OK.
After you indicate which payments you want to deposit, click OK. QuickBooks 
displays the Make Deposits window, as shown in Figure 5-8.
If you need to redisplay the Payments to Deposit dialog box — maybe you 
made a mistake or something, and now you need to go back and fix it — click 
the Payments button on the ribbon at the top of the Make Deposits window. 
Note, though, that QuickBooks won’t display the Payments to Deposit dialog 
box unless the undeposited funds list still has undeposited payments in it.
FIGURE 5-7: 
The Payments 
to Deposit 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      123
4.	 Tell QuickBooks the bank account in which you want to deposit the 
money.
Activate the Deposit To drop-down list, and choose the bank account in which 
you want to place the funds.
5.	 Specify the deposit date.
Press Tab to move the cursor to the Date text box and then type the correct 
date in MM/DD/YYYY format. Use the secret date-editing codes if you need to 
edit the date. (Get these codes from Chapter 4 or from the online Cheat Sheet 
at www.dummies.com if you don’t know them.)
6.	 (Optional) Add a memo description if you want to.
I don’t know what sort of memo description you’d add for a deposit. Sorry.  
A bank deposit is a bank deposit. At least to me.
7.	 Specify the cash-back amount.
If you want cash back from the deposit, activate the Cash Back Goes To 
drop-down list and choose a cash account, such as Petty Cash. Then enter a 
memo in the Cash Back Memo text box and the amount of cash back you’re 
taking in the Cash Back Amount text box.
FIGURE 5-8: 
The Make 
Deposits window.

124      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
8.	 Record the deposit by clicking the Save & Close button or the Save & New 
button.
If you click Save & New, QuickBooks displays a new, blank Make Deposits 
window.
If you sometimes take cash from the register or from the day’s collections to 
spend on business supplies, for COD (collect on delivery) payments, and even for 
owner draws, you enter the cash payment transaction as another transaction line 
in the Make Deposits window (refer to Figure 5-8). If you use $50 from the cash 
register to pay for office supplies from Acme Office Store, for example, you enter 
another line in the Make Deposits window. You enter Acme Office Store in the 
Received From column, your office-supplies expense account in the From Account 
column, and –50 in the Amount column. You use a negative amount to reduce the 
total deposit to the correct amount that is actually deposited into the checking 
account and to charge the expense account for the amount paid out. This is also 
where you record the merchant fees deducted from your credit card deposits 
I mention earlier in this chapter.
Improving Your Cash Inflow
I’m not going to provide a lengthy discussion of how to go about collecting cash 
from your customers. I do, however, want to quickly tell you about a couple of 
other details. You need to know how to monitor what your customers owe you and 
how to assess finance charges. Don’t worry, though. I explain these two things as 
briefly as I can.
Tracking what your customers owe
You can track what a customer owes in a couple of ways. Probably the simplest 
method is to display the Customer Center by choosing Customer ➪ Customer Center. 
Next, select the customer from the Customers & Jobs list (which appears along the 
left edge of the window). QuickBooks whips up a page that lists transactions for the 
customer. It also shows the customer’s contact information. Figure 5-9 shows the 
Customer Center information for a customer.
You also should be aware that QuickBooks provides several nifty accounts receiv-
able (A/R) reports. You get to these reports by clicking the Reports icon and choos-
ing Customers & Receivables. Or you can choose Reports ➪ Customers & Receivables. 
QuickBooks then displays a submenu of about a half-dozen reports that describe 
how much money customers owe you. Some reports, for example, organize open 

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      125
invoices in different groups based on how old the invoices are. (These reports are 
called agings.) Some reports summarize only invoices or payments. And some 
reports show each customer’s open, or unpaid, balance.
In Chapter 15, I describe in general terms how you go about producing and print-
ing QuickBooks reports, so read Chapter 15 if you have questions. Let me also say 
that you can’t hurt anything or foul up your financial records just by printing 
reports. So go ahead and noodle around.
You can print a statement to send to a customer by choosing Customers ➪ Create 
Statements. Use the Create Statements dialog box to describe which customers 
you want to print statements for and the date ranges you want the statements to 
show; then click Print or Email to print or email the statements. Statements are 
handy ways to remind forgetful customers or clients about overdue amounts. By 
the way, you don’t need to send statements to everybody for every month. In my 
CPA practice, I send out statements a couple of times a year to clients with past-
due accounts. This friendly reminder always produces a handful of quick pay-
ments and awkward apologies.
FIGURE 5-9: 
The Customer 
Center.

126      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Assessing finance charges
I wasn’t exactly sure where to stick this discussion of finance charges. Because 
finance charges seem to relate to collecting the cash your customers owe, I figure 
that I’m okay talking about assessing finance charges here.
QuickBooks assesses finance charges on unpaid open invoices without considering 
any unapplied payments. Accordingly, you’ll want to make sure that you apply 
any payments and credit memos to open invoices before assessing finance charges.
To assess finance charges, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Edit ➪ Preferences, click the Finance Charge icon in the list on the 
left, and then click the Company Preferences tab.
To be able to assess finance charges, you first need to set them up.
USING QUICKBOOKS TO WRITE A LETTER
You can seamlessly integrate your QuickBooks data to create collection letters in 
Microsoft Word. You can also use the QuickBooks business-letter templates to speed 
the process of writing business letters. To have QuickBooks help you write a letter, 
choose Company ➪ Prepare Letters with Envelopes. Then choose the submenu com-
mand for the type of letter you want to create or edit. Alternatively, from the Customer 
Center, click the Word icon, and choose the letter from the menu there.
If you’re creating a collection letter, you can specify which customers and jobs you want 
QuickBooks to search for money owed to you. You can tell QuickBooks whether you 
want to create a separate letter for each customer who owes you money or each job on 
which you’re owed money. You can also specify the limit for how overdue an invoice 
must be to warrant a collection letter. After you set the parameters and click Next, 
QuickBooks searches for overdue invoices that fit your criteria.
If you’re creating a type of letter other than a collection letter, QuickBooks offers many 
choices based on whether you’re sending the letter to a customer, a vendor, an 
employee, or someone else. You can create credit approval, credit denial, or credit 
request letters. You can create birthday or apology letters. And you can create faxes or 
bounced-check letters, just to name a few.
After you specify the information about the type of letter that you want to create, 
QuickBooks asks you a few questions about how you want to sign the letter. Then it cre-
ates the letter and displays it in Microsoft Word so that you can edit the letter as neces-
sary and finally print or save it.

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      127
Only the QuickBooks administrator can change the company finance charge 
settings, and he or she can do so only in single-user mode.
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, as shown in Figure 5-10. 
(If you’ve assessed finance charges before, QuickBooks displays the Assess 
Finance Charges window. You can display the Preferences dialog box and 
check or edit your finance charge settings by clicking the Settings button in the 
Assess Finance Charges window.)
2.	 Enter the annual interest rate that you want to use to calculate finance 
charges.
Move the cursor to the Annual Interest Rate (%) text box, and enter the annual 
interest rate.
3.	 (Optional) Enter the minimum finance charge, if one exists.
Move the cursor to the Minimum Finance Charge text box, and enter the 
minimum charge. If you always charge at least $25 on a past-due invoice, for 
example, type 25.
4.	 Enter the number of days of grace that you give.
Days of grace. That sounds kind of like an artsy movie or serious novel, doesn’t 
it? Basically, this number is how many days of slack you’re willing to cut people. 
If you type 30 in the Grace Period (Days) text box, QuickBooks doesn’t start 
assessing finance charges until 30 days after the invoice is past due.
5.	 Specify which account you want to use to track the finance charges.
Activate the Finance Charge Account drop-down list, and select an Income or 
Other Income type account.
FIGURE 5-10: 
The Preferences 
dialog box for 
finance charges.

128      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
6.	Indicate whether you want to charge finance charges on finance charges.
Does this statement make sense? If you charge somebody a finance charge, 
and he or she doesn’t pay the finance charge, eventually, that charge becomes 
past due too. So then what do you do the next time you assess finance 
charges? Do you calculate a finance charge on the finance charge? If you want 
to do this — and if state and local laws permit you to — select the Assess 
Finance Charges on Overdue Finance Charges check box.
7.	Tell QuickBooks whether it should calculate finance charges from the 
due date or the invoice date.
Select either the Due Date or Invoice/Billed Date option button. As you might 
guess, you calculate bigger finance charges if you start accruing interest on the 
invoice date.
8.	Tell QuickBooks whether it should print finance charge invoices.
Select the check box titled Mark Finance Charge Invoices “To Be Printed” if you 
want to print invoices later for the finance charges that you calculate.
9.	Click OK.
After you use the Preferences dialog box to tell QuickBooks how the finance 
charges should be calculated, click OK.
10.	Choose Customers ➪ Assess Finance Charges or click the Finance Charges 
icon on the home screen.
The Assess Finance Charges window appears, as shown in Figure 5-11. This 
window shows all the finance charges that QuickBooks has calculated, 
organized by customer.
11.	Give the finance charge assessment date.
Move the cursor to the Assessment Date text box, and enter the date when 
you’re assessing the finance charges, which I’m willing to bet is the current 
date. (This date is also the invoice date that will be used in the finance-charge 
invoices, if you create them.)
12.	Confirm which customers you want to be assessed finance charges.
QuickBooks initially marks all the finance charges, which means that it sets up 
a new invoice for each finance charge. (QuickBooks marks finance charges with 
a little check mark.) If you want to unmark (or, later, mark) a finance charge, 
click it. To unmark all the charges, click the Unmark All button. To mark all the 
charges, click the Mark All button.
You can produce a collections report for any of the customers or jobs listed in 
the Assess Finance Charges window by selecting the customer name and then 
clicking the Collection History button.

CHAPTER 5  Reeling in the Dough      129
13.	Click the Assess Charges button.
When the Assess Finance Charges window correctly describes the finance 
charges that you want to assess, click Assess Charges. You’re finished with the 
finance-charge calculations and assessments.
I don’t describe how to print invoices that contain finance charges because I slog 
through invoice printing in painstaking detail in Chapter 4. If you have questions 
about how to print the invoices, you may want to visit that chapter.
Dealing with deposits
While I’m on the subject of improving your cash flow, let me briefly mention one 
other powerful cash-flow technique — and discuss the bookkeeping required for 
that technique.
One easy way to improve your cash flow is to accept or require up-front deposits 
or retainers from clients or customers before you do the actual work. In other 
words, before you begin work or order inventory or do whatever is the first step in 
your business for completing a sale, you collect cold, hard cash.
FIGURE 5-11: 
The Assess 
Finance Charges 
window.

130      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Unfortunately, these customer deposits, as they’re called, create a bit of bookkeep-
ing trouble. The question becomes, basically, how do you record a check or cash 
deposit for stuff that you haven’t yet done or sold? You have two basic options:
»
» The Easy Way: You can record a sales receipt for the service or product. 
(See “Recording a Sales Receipt” at the beginning of this chapter.) In this way, 
you count the cash coming into your business, and you recognize the revenue. 
Note, too, that if the deposit is nonrefundable — and for cash-flow purposes, 
the deposit should be nonrefundable — you should count the revenue when 
you receive the deposit if you’re a cash-basis taxpayer. (You probably are a 
cash-basis taxpayer, but ask your tax adviser if you aren’t sure.)
»
» The Precise Way: You can recognize the deposit as a new liability. You do 
this by creating a journal entry that records the increase in your cash account 
and that records the increase in your Customer Deposits current liability 
account. (For help on entering journal entries, see Chapter 19.) If the deposit is 
refundable and you’re a cash-basis taxpayer, or if you’re an accrual-basis 
taxpayer, you probably should use this method. When your sale is completed 
and invoiced later, use the Customer Deposit item as a minus amount in the 
sales invoice to move the amount from the liability account and apply it to the 
invoice balance due.
A WORD OF ADVICE FROM A CPA
While I’m on the subject of tracking what your customers owe you, let me share a 
thought about collecting this money. You should have firm collection procedures that 
you follow faithfully. As soon as an invoice is a week or so past due, it’s very reasonable 
to place a friendly telephone call to the customer’s accounts payable department to 
verify whether the customer has received the invoice and is in the process of paying. 
You have no reason to be embarrassed because some customer is late paying you! 
What’s more, you may find out something surprising and essential to your collection. 
You may discover, for example, that the customer didn’t receive the invoice. Or you may 
find out that something was wrong with the gizmo you sold or the service you provided.
As soon as an invoice is a month or so past due, you need to crank up the pressure. 
A firm letter asking that the customer call you to explain the past-due amount is very 
reasonable — especially if the customer assured you only a few weeks ago that pay-
ment was forthcoming.
When an invoice is a couple of months past due, you need to get pretty serious. You’ll 
probably want to stop selling the customer anything more because it’s unclear whether 
you’ll be paid. And you may want to start a formal collection process. (Ask your attorney 
about starting such a process.)

Q
uickBooks gives you two ways to pay and record your bills. And you have 
many options when it comes to deciding when to pay your bills, how to 
pay your bills, and how to record your bills for the purposes of tracking 
inventory and expenses.
In this chapter, I explain not only how to pay vendor bills, but also how to pay that 
all-important bill that so many businesses owe to their state and local govern-
ments. I’m talking, of course, about sales tax.
Pay Now or Pay Later?
When it comes to paying bills, you have a fundamental choice to make. You can 
either record and pay your bills simultaneously, or you can record your bills as 
they come in and then pay them when they’re due. The first method is easier, as 
you might guess, because you do everything at once. The second method, called 
the accounts payable method, gives you more accurate financial records and makes 
for more precise management of your cash and outstanding bills.
Chapter 6

132      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
If you have a small business with little overhead, you may just as well record and 
pay bills simultaneously. If you need precise measurement of your expenses and 
bills, though — if you want to use what’s termed accrual-basis accounting — you 
should use the accounts payable method of paying bills. I should note, too, that 
using the accounts payable method with QuickBooks isn’t as difficult as it may 
seem at first.
And now you’re ready to begin. In the next section, I describe how to pay bills by 
writing checks. A little later in the chapter, in the “Recording Your Bills the 
Accounts Payable Way” section, you find out how to pay bills by using the accounts 
payable method.
Recording Your Bills by Writing Checks
When you record bills by writing checks, you’re doing cash-basis accounting. In a 
nutshell, this means that you count bills as expenses when you write the check to 
pay the bill.
I talk a little bit about cash-basis accounting in Appendix B, but let me say here 
that a trade-off is implicit in the choice to use cash-basis accounting. If you use 
cash-basis accounting — which is what I do in my little business — you greatly 
simplify your bookkeeping, but you lose precision in your measurement of your 
expenses. Also, you don’t keep track of your unpaid bills inside QuickBooks; they 
just stack up in a pile next to your desk.
As long as you understand this trade-off and are comfortable with it, you’re ready 
to begin using this method, which you do by following the steps I provide in the 
coming paragraphs.
The slow way to write checks
You can write checks either from the register or from the Write Checks window. 
Using the Write Checks window is the slow way, but it enables you to record your 
expenses and the items (if any) that you purchase. Using the Write Checks window 
is the best choice in the following situations:
»
» You’re paying for an inventory item.
»
» You’re paying for something for which you have a purchase order.
»
» You plan to be reimbursed for the bill that you’re paying.
»
» You want to record what job or class the bill falls under.

CHAPTER 6  Paying the Bills      133
To use the Write Checks window to write checks, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Write Checks.
Alternatively, click the Write Checks icon in the Banking section of the home 
screen. The Write Checks window appears, as shown in Figure 6-1. Notice that 
this window has three parts:
•	 The check part on the top, which you no doubt recognize from having 
written thousands of checks in the past.
•	 The buttons on the top and bottom.
•	 The Expenses and Items tabs near the middle of the window. This part is for 
recording what the check is for, as I explain in Steps 7, 8, and 9.
2.	 Click the Bank Account drop-down list and choose the account from 
which you want to write this check.
This step is very important if you have more than one account. Make sure that 
you choose the correct account; otherwise, your account balances in QuickBooks 
will be incorrect.
FIGURE 6-1: 
The Write Checks 
window.

134      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
3.	 Specify the check date.
Click in the Date field and type the check date. I don’t keep reminding you 
about this, but because I’m still in the early part of this book, remember that 
you can enter today’s date by pressing the T key. You can also click the button 
to the right of the Date box to get a pop-up calendar. To select a date from the 
pop-up calendar, click the calendar day that you want to use.
4.	 Fill in the Pay to the Order Of line.
If you’ve written a check to this person or party before, the AutoFill feature fills 
in the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line for you after you start 
typing the name. (AutoFill does so by comparing what you type with names 
shown in the Customer, Vendor, Employee, and Other lists.) AutoFill also puts 
the payee’s address in the Address text box.
The AutoRecall feature can even fill out the entire check for you, based on 
the last check that you wrote to this vendor. (You can enable AutoRecall by 
choosing Edit ➪ Preferences, clicking the General icon, and using the 
Automatically Recall Information box and buttons.)
Does the check look all right? Maybe all you need to do is tab around, adjusting 
numbers. Otherwise, read the next 12 steps. (Another 12-step program?) In 
these steps, I explain how to record information about a new vendor and pay a 
check to that vendor in one fell swoop.
If you’ve never paid anything to this person before, the program displays a 
Name Not Found message box after you enter the name on the Pay to the 
Order Of line. You can click either Quick Add or Set Up to add the payee name 
to one of your lists. (To find out how to do so, check out the “To Quick Add or to 
Set Up?” sidebar later in this chapter.)
5.	 Type the amount of the check.
Now comes my favorite part. I’ve always found it a big bother to write out the 
amount of checks. I mean, if you write a check for $12,345.67, how do you fit 
“twelve thousand, three hundred forty-five dollars, and sixty-seven cents” on 
the line? Where do you put those hyphens, anyway?
All you have to do with QuickBooks is enter the amount next to the dollar sign 
and press Tab. When you press Tab, QuickBooks writes the amount for you on 
the Dollars line. At moments like this, I’m grateful to be alive in the 21st 
century, when computer technology can do these marvelous things for me.
6.	 (Optional) Fill in the Address text box.
You need to fill in this field only if the address isn’t there already and if you 
intend to send the check by mail in a window envelope.

CHAPTER 6  Paying the Bills      135
7.	(Optional) Fill in the Memo line.
You can put a message to the payee on the Memo line — a message, such as 
Quit bleeding me dry. But you usually put an account number on the Memo line 
so that the payee can record your account number.
If you try to click the Save & New button and close the dialog box now, QuickBooks  
tells you that you can’t and tries to bite your leg off. Why? Because you can’t 
write a check unless you fill in the Expenses and Items tabs. You use these tabs 
to describe what the check pays.
8.	Move the cursor down to the Account column of the Expenses tab and 
then enter an expense account name.
Chances are good that you want to enter the name of an account that’s already 
on the Chart of Accounts. If that’s the case, move the cursor to a field in the 
Account column; QuickBooks turns the field into a drop-down list. Click the 
down arrow to see a list of all your accounts. You’ll probably have to scroll 
down the list to get to some accounts. Click the one that this check applies 
to — perhaps Rent. If you need to create a new expense account category for 
this check, choose Add New from the top of the list to see the New Account 
dialog box. Fill in the information and then click OK.
What if the money that you’re paying with this check can be distributed across 
two, three, or four expense accounts? Simply click below the account that you 
just entered. The down arrow shoots down next to the cursor. Click the down 
arrow and enter another expense account, and another, and another, if you 
need to.
9.	Tab over to the Amount column, if necessary, and change around the 
numbers.
If you’re distributing this check across more than one account, make sure that 
the numbers in the Amount column correctly distribute the check to the appro-
priate accounts. Figure 6-2 shows a completed check.
10.	(Optional) Enter words of explanation or encouragement in the Memo 
column.
Someday, you may have to go back to this check and try to figure out what 
these expenses mean. The Memo column may be your only clue. Enter some 
wise words here, such as August rent, copier repair, or company party.
11.	(Optional) Assign the expense to the Customer:Job column.
If you plan to be reimbursed for these expenses, or if you just want to track 
your expenses by job, enter the name of the customer who is going to 
reimburse you. Click the down arrow to find the customer. Enter an amount 
for each customer or job if necessary.

136      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
12.	(Optional) Assign the expense to a class.
You also can track expenses by class by making entries in the Class column. 
Notice the usual down arrow, which you click to see a list of classes. You won’t 
see the Class column, however, unless you told QuickBooks that you wanted to 
use classes when you created your company. (You create the company when 
you work your way through the QuickBooks Setup process; see Chapter 2.)
If you want to have QuickBooks track expenses by class, you have to set it up to 
do so. To set up QuickBooks to track expenses, choose Edit ➪ Preferences. When 
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Accounting icon, click 
the Company Preferences tab, and then select the Use Class Tracking check box.
13.	Use the Items tab to record what you’re purchasing.
You may be purchasing inventory items, or you may already have filled out a 
purchase order for the items for which you’re paying. If either of these cases is 
so, click the Items tab. If you don’t have a purchase order for the items, go on 
to Step 14. If you do have a purchase order for the items, click the Select PO 
button to see a list of purchases on order with this vendor. Select those for 
which you’re paying, and click OK.
QuickBooks doesn’t show its purchase order (PO) feature unless you told it 
during the QuickBooks Setup that you want to use purchase orders. If you now 
think you want to use them, choose Edit ➪ Preferences. When QuickBooks 
displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Items & Inventory button, click 
FIGURE 6-2: 
A completed 
check.

CHAPTER 6  Paying the Bills      137
the Company Preferences tab, and then select the Inventory and Purchase 
Orders Are Active check box.
14.	Move the cursor to the Item column and enter a name for the item.
Notice the down arrow in this column. Click the arrow to see the Items list. 
Does the item that you’re paying for appear in this list? If so, click it. If not, 
choose Add New from the top of the list and fill out the New Item window. 
(Read about this in Chapter 3.)
15.	Fill in the rest of the rows of items on the Items tab.
You can enter all the items that you’re purchasing on this tab. Make sure that 
the Items tab accurately shows the items that you’re purchasing, their cost, and 
the quantity.
When you finish adding items, you may want to use one of the following 
options that appear in the Write Checks window:
•	 Click the Print button to print the check in the Write Checks window. This 
option doesn’t print all the checks that you have written and marked to be 
printed, however. (I explain how to print more than one check at a time in 
Chapter 10.)
•	 The Clear Splits button deletes any individual amounts that you entered 
for separate expenses or items on the Expenses and Items tabs. Then 
QuickBooks enters the total amount of the check in the Amount column 
on the Expenses tab.
•	 The Recalculate button totals the items and expenses in the window. It also 
puts the total on both the numeric and text amount lines of the check.
•	 The Print Later check box designates the check for printing. Select this check 
box if you want to print the check with QuickBooks by using your printer 
and preprinted check forms. Deselect this check box if you’re recording a 
handwritten check.
•	 The Pay Online check box (if you’ve enabled online bill pay) lets you specify 
that the particular check you’re describing is an online payment. See 
Chapter 13 for more information about online banking.
16.	Click the Save & New button or the Save & Close button to finish writing 
the check.
Click Save & Close to tell QuickBooks that you want to save the check and close 
the check form. Click Save & New to tell QuickBooks that you want to save the 
check and then display another blank check form. If you don’t want to save the 
check, close the dialog box and then click No when QuickBooks asks whether 
you want to save the check.

138      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
You can also use the Next and Previous buttons to move to previously written 
checks or to a blank check form. If you write check number 101, for example, 
clicking Next takes you to check 102 so that you can write that one. (Clicking 
Previous moves you to check 100, in case you need to edit a check that you’ve 
written earlier.)
Well, that’s over with. For a minute there, I thought that it would never end.
The fast way to write checks
If you want to pay a bill that isn’t for inventory, that you won’t be reimbursed for, 
or that you don’t need to track in any way, shape, or form, you can write your 
check directly from the register. This method is the fast and easy way to go. Follow 
these steps:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Use Register.
Alternatively, click the Register icon in the Banking section on the home page. 
The register appears, as shown in Figure 6-3. (If you have more than one bank 
account, you have to select the proper account from the drop-down list and 
click OK.) The cursor is at the end of the register, ready and waiting for you to 
enter check information.
TO QUICK ADD OR TO SET UP?
If you click Quick Add in the Name Not Found message box, you see a Select Name Type 
message box asking whether the payee is a Vendor, Customer, Employee, or Other. 
Most likely, the payee is a vendor, in which case you click Vendor (but you can, of course, 
click one of the other three options). The address information that you write on the 
check goes in the Vendor list — or Customer, Employee, or Other list, depending on what 
you clicked. (Read through Chapter 3 if you’re in the dark about adding to your lists.)
Selecting the Set Up option in the Name Not Found message box is a little more inter-
esting. When you select this option, you also see the Select Name Type box. Click 
Vendor, Customer, Employee, or Other. Click OK, and then you see the New Whatever 
window (as I discuss in Chapter 3) if you’ve already added new vendors, customers, or 
employees to your lists.
By the way, my long-suffering technical editor, David, wants me to point out that using 
the Quick Add method is sort of lazy. With Quick Add, QuickBooks requires you to col-
lect only a minimal amount of information.

CHAPTER 6  Paying the Bills      139
2.	 Fill in the information for the check.
Notice that the entries you make are the same ones that you’d make on a 
check. You need to note three things about the register:
•	 If you enter a Payee name that QuickBooks doesn’t recognize, you see the 
Name Not Found message box, and you’re asked to give information about 
this new, mysterious vendor. To see what to do next, read the preceding 
set of instructions on writing a check the slow way.
•	 You have to choose an account name. Chances are good that you can find 
the right one in the Account drop-down list; if you can’t, though, enter one 
of your own. QuickBooks displays the Account Not Found message box 
and asks you to fill in the information about this new account.
•	 To record a check that pays more than a single expense, click the Splits 
button (in the bottom-left corner of the window) to display a little box that 
you can use to input multiple expense accounts and amounts.
As you fill out the register, if you decide that you want to be reimbursed for this 
check or that you want to track expenses and items, click the Edit Transaction 
button. You see the Write Checks window; refer to Figure 6-1. Follow Steps 
FIGURE 6-3: 
The register.

140      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
3–14 in the preceding section on how to write a check the slow way to fill in the 
Write Checks window. When you finish filling in the Write Checks window, click 
Save & Close. You’re back where you started, in the register window.
3.	 When you finish filling in the check information, click the Record button.
You click Record, of course, to record the check.
By the way, if you realize that you made a mistake and haven’t yet clicked 
Record to record the check, you can click the Restore button to go back to 
square one. Clicking Restore blanks out what you just entered so that you can 
start over again.
If you want to print the check (or checks) that you’ve just entered, flip to Chapter­ 10 
for details. In the meantime, in Chapter 8, I give you the lowdown on keeping your 
checkbook — so turn there if this discussion of checks has you really excited.
Recording Your Bills the Accounts 
Payable Way
The accounts payable (A/P) way of paying bills involves two steps. The first is a 
trifle on the difficult side, and the second step is as easy as pie. First, you record 
your bills. If you read the section earlier in this chapter on writing checks the slow 
way, you’re already familiar with using the Expenses tab and the Items tab to 
record bills. You need to fill out those tabs for the A/P method as well if you want 
to distribute a bill to accounts, customers, jobs, classes, and items. If you read the 
first half of this chapter, some of what follows is old hat.
After you record your bills, you can go on to the second step: telling Quick-
Books which bills to pay. Then QuickBooks writes the checks. You print them. You 
mail them.
To make the A/P method work, you have to record your bills as they come in. That 
doesn’t mean that you have to pay them right away. By recording your bills, you 
can keep track of how much money you owe and how much money your business 
really has. QuickBooks reminds you when your bills are due so that you don’t have 
to worry about forgetting to pay a bill.
When you record bills the accounts payable way, you’re using accrual-basis 
accounting. I explain accrual-basis accounting in Appendix B.

CHAPTER 6  Paying the Bills      141
Recording your bills
When a bill comes in, the first thing to do is record it. You can record bills through 
the Enter Bills window or the Accounts Payable register. If you plan to track bills 
by expense and item, you need to use the Enter Bills window. I describe that 
method first. If you have a simple bill to pay that doesn’t need to be reimbursed or 
tracked, skip ahead to the “Paying Your Bills” section later in this chapter.
To record a bill through the Enter Bills window, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Vendors ➪ Enter Bills.
Alternatively, click the Enter Bills icon in the Vendors area on the home page. 
Figure 6-4 shows the Enter Bills window. You no doubt notice that the top half 
of this window looks a great deal like a check, and that’s because much of the 
information that you put here ends up on the check that you write to pay your 
bill. (If you see the word Credit at the top of the form rather than Bill, select the 
Bill option button in the top-left corner. You also can use this screen to enter 
credit memos from vendors.)
FIGURE 6-4: 
The Enter Bills 
window.

142      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
2.	 Select the name of the vendor you’re paying.
If you want to pay this bill to a vendor who’s already on the Vendor list, click the 
down arrow at the end of the Vendor line and choose the vendor. (Then 
QuickBooks automatically fills the Enter Bills window with as much information 
as it can remember.) If this vendor is new, QuickBooks asks you to Quick Add 
or Set Up some information about the vendor: the address, credit limit, 
payment terms, and so on. You provide this information in the New Vendor 
window. If you aren’t familiar with this window, make a brief visit to Chapter 3.
If you have one or more unfilled purchase orders with the vendor that you 
select, QuickBooks asks you whether you want to receive against a purchase 
order. Click Yes if you do or No if you don’t. If you choose to receive against a 
purchase order, QuickBooks displays the Open Purchase Orders dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 6-5. It lists the open purchase orders you’ve recorded. When 
you select one or more purchase orders to receive against, QuickBooks fills in 
the items and amounts from these orders for you, which you can modify as 
necessary. When you finish with the Open Purchase Orders dialog box, click 
OK to get back to the Enter Bills window.
Hey, you know what? I don’t talk about purchase orders until Chapter 7. But 
here’s the CliffsNotes version: To create a purchase order, which is a record of 
items you order from vendors, choose Vendors ➪ Create Purchase Orders. 
When QuickBooks displays the Create Purchase Orders window, describe your 
order. You print and edit purchase orders, by the way, in the same manner as 
you print invoices and credit memos.
3.	 Select the payment terms describing when the bill is due.
On the Terms line, open the drop-down list and choose the payment terms 
(if the information isn’t already there from when you set up the vendor).
4.	 (Optional) Enter the vendor’s reference number.
If you enter the vendor’s reference number for the bill — this is probably just 
the invoice number or your account number — the reference number prints 
on the voucher that’s part of the printed check.
FIGURE 6-5: 
Paying a bill 
against a 
purchase order.

CHAPTER 6  Paying the Bills      143
5.	(Optional) Enter a memo to describe the bill.
You can enter a note in the Memo text box. The note that you enter appears 
on the A/P register.
6.	Move the cursor down to the Account column of the Expenses tab and 
enter an expense account name.
Chances are good that you want to enter the name of an expense account 
that’s already on the chart of accounts. If that’s the case, click the down arrow 
to see a list of all your accounts. You probably have to scroll down the list to get 
to the expense accounts. (A fast way to move down the list is to start typing the 
account name; you go straight down the list.) Click the account that this bill 
represents. (Most likely, it’s Supplies or something like that.)
If you need to create a new expense account category for this bill, choose Add 
New from the top of the list. You see the New Account dialog box. Fill in the 
information and click OK.
What if the money that you’re paying out because of this bill can be split 
among two, three, or four expense accounts? Simply click below the account 
that you just entered. The down arrow appears. Click it to enter another 
expense account, and another, and another if you need to.
7.	Tab over to the Amount column, if necessary, and change the numbers.
If you’re splitting this bill among several accounts, make sure that the numbers 
in the Amount column add to the total of the bill.
8.	(Optional) Enter words of explanation or wisdom in the Memo column.
9.	(Optional) Assign the expense to a Customer:Job.
If you plan to be reimbursed for these expenses, or if you just want to track 
your expenses by job, enter the customer who is going to reimburse you. Enter 
an amount for each account if necessary. You can use the down arrow to find 
customers and then click them.
10.	(Optional) Assign the expense to a class.
You also can track expenses by class by making entries in the Class column. 
Notice the usual down arrow and click it to see a list of classes. (You don’t see a 
Class column unless you told QuickBooks that you want to use classes.)
If you want to have QuickBooks track expenses by class, you can set it up to do 
so. To set up QuickBooks to track expenses, choose Edit ➪ Preferences. When 
QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Accounting icon, click 
the Company Preferences tab, and then select the Use Class Tracking check box.
If you want, click the Recalculate button to total the expenses.

144      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
11.	Use the Items tab to record the various items that the bill represents.
Click the Items tab. Enter the items you purchased and the prices you paid 
for them.
If you realize after partially completing the bill that the bill does indeed pay a 
purchase order, click the Select PO button, which appears on the Main ribbon 
of the Enter Bills window.
From the Vendor drop-down list, choose the name of the vendor who sent you 
the bill. In the list of open purchase orders, click in the column on the left to put 
a check mark next to the purchase order (or orders) for which you’re paying. 
Easy enough? Click OK when you’re done; QuickBooks fills out the Items tab for 
you automatically.
12.	Move to the Item column and enter a name for the item.
Notice the down arrow in this column. Click it to see the Item list. Does the item 
that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click that item. If not, choose Add 
New from the top of the list and fill out the New Item window. (See Chapter 3.)
13.	Fill in the rest of the rows of items on the Items tab.
You can enter all the items you’re purchasing here. Make sure that the Items 
tab accurately shows the items that you’re purchasing, their costs, and their 
quantities. If you want to, click the Recalculate button to total the items.
14.	Save the bill.
Click Save & New to save your record of the bill and then enter another bill. Or 
click Save & Close to record your bill but not enter another bill.
Just as in the case with customer-related windows (like the Create Invoices win-
dow), QuickBooks displays historical information about a vendor in the right side-
bar. You can toggle between the Vendor and Transactions, run quick reports, and 
quickly link to previous or outstanding bills, invoices, and other notes on a client 
you do business with.
Entering your bills the fast way
You also can enter bills directly in the Accounts Payable register. This method is 
faster, but it makes tracking expenses and items more difficult.
If you want to enter bills directly in the Accounts Payable register, follow these 
steps:

CHAPTER 6  Paying the Bills      145
1.	 Choose Lists ➪ Chart of Accounts or click the Chart of Accounts icon on 
the home page.
The Chart of Accounts opens.
2.	 Open the Accounts Payable account.
When QuickBooks displays your Chart of Accounts, double-click the Accounts 
Payable account in the list. You see the Accounts Payable register window, as 
shown in Figure 6-6. The cursor is at the end of the register, ready and waiting 
for you to enter the next bill.
3.	 Fill in the information for your bill.
Enter the same information that you would if you were filling in the Enter Bills 
window, which I describe at the beginning of this chapter. In the Vendor text 
box, click the down arrow and choose a name from the Vendor list.
If you enter a vendor name that QuickBooks doesn’t recognize, you see the 
Vendor Not Found message box, and QuickBooks asks you to give information 
about this new, mysterious vendor. Either click Quick Add to have the program 
collect the information from the register as you fill it out or click Set Up to see 
the New Vendor dialog box. (I describe the choice between Quick Add and Set 
Up in the “To Quick Add or to Set Up?” sidebar earlier in this chapter. I explain 
how to set up new vendors in Chapter 3.)
FIGURE 6-6: 
The Accounts 
Payable register 
window.

146      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
You have to select an account name. You can probably find the right one in the 
Account drop-down list; if you can’t, enter one of your own. You see the 
Account Not Found message box, and QuickBooks asks you to fill in informa-
tion about this new account.
If you decide while you fill out the register that you want to be reimbursed for 
this check or that you want to track expenses and items, click the Edit 
Transaction button to see the Enter Bills window. (Refer to Figure 6-4.) Follow 
Steps 2–12 in the “Recording your bills” section (earlier in this chapter) to fill in 
the Enter Bills window. When you finish filling in the window, click Save & New. 
You’re back where you started: in the Accounts Payable window.
See the Splits button? This Splits button works the same as the Splits button in 
the bank account register window. When you click Splits, QuickBooks provides 
additional rows for inputting expense and class information.
4.	 When you fill in all the information, click Record.
The Restore button, located just right of Record, is there in case you fill out the 
register but decide that you want to start all over again before you’ve recorded 
the transaction. Click Restore to clear the information onscreen, and you have 
a clean slate.
Deleting a bill
Suppose that you accidentally enter the same bill twice or enter a bill that was 
really meant for the business next door. (Just because you’re tracking bills by com-
puter doesn’t mean that you don’t have to look things over carefully anymore.) 
Here’s how to delete a bill that you entered in the Accounts Payable register:
1.	 Locate the bill in the Accounts Payable register by using one of the 
following methods:
•	 If you know roughly what day you entered the bill, you can scroll through the 
list to find it. The entries are listed in date order. (Select the 1-Line check 
box to display each bill on one line rather than on two lines to make the 
scrolling go faster.)
•	 If you don’t remember the date, choose the Edit menu’s Find command.
And now, back to the Accounts Payable register window that you have in 
progress . . .
2.	 Select the bill that you want to delete by clicking anywhere in the bill.
3.	 Choose Edit ➪ Delete Bill.
QuickBooks confirms that you really, truly want to delete the transaction. If you 
click OK, it dutifully deletes the bill from the A/P register.

CHAPTER 6  Paying the Bills      147
Remind me to pay that bill, will you?
You could tie a string around your finger, but the best way to make sure that you 
pay your bills on time is to have QuickBooks remind you. In fact, you can make the 
Reminders message box the first thing that you see when you start QuickBooks.
To adjust the QuickBooks reminder options, you must be logged on as the admin-
istrator in single-user mode. Then choose Edit ➪ Preferences. When QuickBooks 
displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Reminders icon in the list on the left 
and then click the Company Preferences tab to access the dialog box shown in 
Figure 6-7.
Make sure that either the Show Summary or Show List option button is selected 
(you can’t choose Don’t Remind Me and expect to get a reminder) and then give 
yourself several days’ notice before you need to pay bills by typing a number (10 is 
the default and usually works well) in the Days Before Due Date text box, located 
in the Remind Me column.
If you select the Show Summary option (the first button to the right of the option), 
you get a summary of the bills that you owe each time you start QuickBooks. If you 
select Show List (the second button to the right of the option), you get the details 
about each bill.
USING THE FIND DIALOG BOX
When you can’t remember the information that you need to find a particular entry or 
transaction, you can search for the information by using the Find dialog box. If you can’t 
recall when you entered the bill, choose Edit ➪ Find to open the Find dialog box. Choose 
a filter (the category to search by). The box to the right changes to include drop-down 
lists or text boxes that you can use to specify what you want to search for.
Choose as many filters as you like, but be careful to enter information accurately; other-
wise, QuickBooks will look for the wrong information. Also, try to strike a balance, 
choosing only as many filters as you really need to find your information. The more fil-
ters you choose, the more searching QuickBooks does and the longer the search takes.
After you finish choosing filters, click the Find button; the transactions that match all 
your filters appear in the list at the bottom of the window. Click the transaction that you 
want to examine more closely and then click Go To. QuickBooks opens the appropriate 
window and takes you right to the transaction. Very snazzy, I do believe.

148      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
You may want to review the Reminders window when you start QuickBooks or 
open a new company file. The window lists reminders (such as forms you need to 
print and payments you need to transmit) and tells you which unpaid bills you’re 
supposed to pay. You can see this list by choosing Company ➪ Reminders. Note 
that you can also tell QuickBooks to display any reminders when opening the 
company file. To do this, choose the Edit ➪ Preferences command, click Remind-
ers, click My Preferences, and then select the Show Reminders List when Opening 
a Company File check box.
Paying Your Bills
If you’ve done everything right and recorded your bills correctly, writing checks is 
a snap. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Vendors ➪ Pay Bills.
Alternatively, click the Pay Bills icon located on the home page. You see the Pay 
Bills window, as shown in Figure 6-8.
2.	 Change the Payment Date (at the bottom) to the date that you want to 
appear on the checks.
FIGURE 6-7: 
The Reminders 
section of the 
Preferences 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 6  Paying the Bills      149
By default, this field shows today’s date. If you want another date on the 
payment check — perhaps you’re postdating the check — change this date. (See 
the online Cheat Sheet at www.dummies.com for some secret date-editing codes.)
3.	 Set a cutoff date for showing bills.
In the Show Bills Due On or Before date field, tell QuickBooks which bills to 
show by entering a date. If you want to see all the bills, select the Show All Bills 
option button.
4.	 Use the Sort By drop-down list to tell QuickBooks how to sort the bills.
You can arrange bills by due date with the oldest bills listed first, arrange them 
alphabetically by vendor, or arrange them from largest to smallest.
5.	 Identify which bills to pay.
If you want to pay all the bills in the dialog box, click the Select All Bills button. If 
you want to clear all the bills you marked, click the Clear Selections button. If 
you want to pick and choose, click to the left of the bill’s due date to pay the bill. 
A check mark appears where you click. Note that after you apply a payment, 
the Clear Selections button replaces the Select All Bills button.
6.	 Change the Amt. to Pay figure if you want to pay only part of a bill.
That’s right — you can pay only part of a bill by changing the number in the Amt. 
to Pay column. (The payee can always just send you another bill, of course.)
FIGURE 6-8: 
The Pay Bills 
window.

150      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
7.	Get the early-payment discount rate on your bills, if any.
You may be eligible for an early-payment discount on some bills. To find out 
how much of a discount you get, click the Amt. to Pay field and then click the 
Set Discount button to see the Discount tab of the Discount and Credits dialog 
box. Use the Discount tab’s Amount of Discount box to give the dollar amount 
of the discount. Use the Discount tab’s Discount Account box to specify which 
account should be used for recording the money saved through the discount.
8.	Get a list of credit memos that you can apply to the payment.
Click the Set Credits button to see the Credits tab of the Discount and Credits 
dialog box. If you want to use one of the credits listed to reduce the amount of 
the bill, click it and then click Done.
9.	Select a payment date, method, and bank account.
Use the Payment area’s Date field to specify when the bill should be paid, the 
Method drop-down list to select the payment method you want to use (Check 
or Credit Card), and the Account drop-down list to select the bank account 
from which payment will be made. (Note: If you’ve subscribed to and set up the 
QuickBooks online bill payment feature, you have another payment method 
choice: online payment. I describe making online payments in Chapter 13.)
10.	If you plan to print the check, select the To Be Printed option button.
Many businesses use QuickBooks to keep track of checks, but instead of printing 
the checks, they have employees write them by hand. If your business uses this 
method, select the Assign Check Number option button. Then, when QuickBooks 
asks how it should number the check, either give the number by typing it in the 
appropriate box or tell QuickBooks to automatically number the check.
11.	Click the Pay Selected Bills button to pay the bills.
QuickBooks displays a Payment Summary dialog box (not shown) that lists the 
bills you’ve paid and tallies the payments. You can click the Payment Summary’s 
Pay More Bills button to return to the Pay Bills window and select other bills for 
payment. Or you can click the Payment Summary’s Print Checks button to take 
the next bill payment step: printing checks to pay the bills. If you do click Print 
Checks, QuickBooks steps you through the process for printing checks. (I’m not 
going to describe how to print checks here. Chapter 10 goes into great detail 
about this activity.)
One other little bit of accounting trivia: When you do pay a bill, QuickBooks 
goes into the Accounts Payable register and notes that you paid these bills; 
then it goes into the register and “writes” the check or checks. Figures 6-9 
and 6-10 show you exactly what I mean. (The two figures show a $500 bill from 
Bertha’s Workshop being paid.)

Oooh. Cool.

152      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
QuickBooks shows the original bill amount as the amount that’s paid, not the 
original bill amount minus the early-payment discount. It needs to use this 
method to completely pay off the bill.
In the Accounts Payable register, you see BILLPMT in the Type column and the 
amount paid in the Paid column. The Due Date and Billed columns are now empty.
In the bank account register, you again see BILLPMT in the Type column.
Don’t kid yourself, though — these bills aren’t really paid yet. Sure, they’re paid 
in the mind of QuickBooks, but the mind of QuickBooks extends only as far as the 
metal (or trendy plastic) box that holds your computer. You still have to write or 
print the checks and deliver them to the payees.
If you’re going to write the checks by hand, enter the check numbers from your 
own checkbook in the QuickBooks register Number column. You want these num-
bers to jibe, not jive. (I know: A pun is the lowest form of humor.)
If you plan to print the checks, see Chapter 10.
And another thing: If you enter a bill, you absolutely must use the Pay Bills com-
mand to record the payment that pays off the bill. If you don’t do this, the unpaid 
bill just sits there forever, lonely and forlorn.
Tracking Vehicle Mileage
QuickBooks includes a vehicle mileage-tracking feature that lets you track your 
business miles. To track vehicle mileage in QuickBooks, choose Company ➪ Enter 
Vehicle Mileage. Then, in the Enter Vehicle Mileage dialog box that appears, record 
the vehicle, date, miles driven, odometer settings, and reason for the trip. (I talk 
a bit more about tracking vehicle mileage in Chapter 18, so check that out if this is 
something you’re really interested in.)
May I briefly tell you the IRS rules for deducting business miles? Essentially, you 
have two approaches to choose between. The easier method — and the one that 
I use, because I’m lazy — is to record as a business expense an amount per busi-
ness mile driven. The rate per mile is roughly 60 cents, which is far less than the 
actual cost of driving most cars. But, hey — that’s the price of slothfulness.
The hard method for tracking business miles is to track all your vehicle expenses — 
including gas, oil, repairs, insurance, and vehicle depreciation — and then record 
as a business expense the business-use portion of these expenses.

CHAPTER 6  Paying the Bills      153
To get the business-use portion of your vehicle, use the ratio of business miles to 
total miles. If during the year, you drive 6,000 business miles and your total miles 
are 12,000, your business-use percentage equals 50 percent. In this case, you can 
record as a business expense 50 percent of your vehicle expenses.
Usually with the hard “actual expenses” method, you get a higher business vehicle­ 
expense deduction. However, note that the IRS limits the amount that you can 
include as vehicle depreciation, so you don’t get as high a deduction as you might 
at first think. (You may want to consult your tax adviser for details.)
No matter which method you use, you want a record of your actual business miles, 
which the Enter Vehicle Mileage command enables you to do. By law, you need a 
good record of business mileage to legitimately claim the deduction.
Paying Sales Tax
To ingratiate itself with you retailers, QuickBooks includes a special dialog box for 
paying sales tax. To use this dialog box, you must have sales tax items or a sales 
tax group already set up. See Chapter 3 for a thorough explanation of items and 
groups.
To see how much sales tax you owe and to write checks to government agencies in 
one fell swoop, choose Vendors ➪ Sales Tax ➪ Pay Sales Tax to access the Pay Sales 
Tax dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-11. Alternatively, click the Pay Sales Tax icon 
on the home page in the Vendors area.
This dialog box is similar to the Pay Bills window (refer to Figure 6-8). The but-
tons basically work the same way.
Click in the Pay column to add check marks next to all the items that you want to 
pay. QuickBooks automatically writes checks in the register. Your payments are 
likewise recorded in the Sales Tax Payable register.

The Pay Sales Tax 
dialog box.

Are you an online retailer or a bricks-and-mortar retailer who does a healthy 
website business? If so, you probably want to get more disciplined about the way 
you handle your sales-tax accounting. Here’s why. Although the United States 
Congress has cooled to the idea of changing the federal laws that prevent other 
states from making you collect and remit sales taxes, state revenue agencies are 
getting more and more aggressive about asserting that online retailers have lia-
bility for sales taxes on sales to customers within their borders if the retailer has 
any connection to the state. Accordingly, even fairly modest retail operations 
might in the future find themselves preparing three or four dozen sales-tax 
returns each month to report online sales made to customers outside a home 
state. If this occurs in your business, you’ll definitely want to be using QuickBooks 
to automate and ease the work of sales-tax accounting.
A QUICK WORD ON THE VENDOR 
CENTER WINDOW
If you choose Vendors ➪ Vendor Center or click the Vendor Center icon, QuickBooks 
­displays a window that summarizes a bunch of information about the vendor in 
question.­ This feature doesn’t actually provide you with new information. But — and 
this is ­noteworthy — it does give you a slick way to get all the information you have 
regarding a particular vendor. Note that you can select which vendor’s information 
appears in the Vendor Center window by selecting the vendor from the vendor list that 
appears at the left edge of the window.

F
or small and growing businesses, inventory is one of the toughest assets to 
manage. First, of course, you need to physically care for stuff. Second, you 
have to make sure that you don’t run out of some item or have too much of 
some other item.
QuickBooks (fortunately) provides elegant sophistication in its inventory man-
agement features, making inventory management easy. With a little jiggering, you 
can probably get it to work in any simple case — and even in many complex cases.
If you want to make inventory accounting really easy and don’t care about a bit of 
imprecision, take a peek at “The Lazy Person’s Approach to Inventory” near the 
end of this chapter.

Setting Up Inventory Items
Before you can track your inventory, you need to do two things. First, you need to tell 
QuickBooks that you want to track inventory. To do this, choose Edit ➪ Preferences. 
When QuickBooks displays the Preferences dialog box, click the Items & Inventory 
icon in the list on the left. Your screen should look remarkably similar to the one in 
Figure 7-1. (You might have to click the Company Preferences tab first.) Make sure 
that the Inventory and Purchase Orders Are Active check box is selected and that one 
of the Warn If Not Enough Inventory to Sell option buttons is selected.
Here’s the second thing that you need to do: Create an Item list. This list is a 
description of all items that you might conceivably put on an invoice. In other 
words, all items that you order and sell belong on the Item list.
You should’ve set up your initial Item list during QuickBooks Setup, as I describe 
in Chapter 2. If you need to add an item to your list, choose Lists ➪ Item List. Then 
click the Item button, select New from the drop-down list, and fill in the New Item 
window. If you want the blow-by-blow, go to Chapter 3 and get it straight from the 
horse’s mouth.
After you turn on the inventory stuff and set up (or update) your Item list, you can 
track your inventory.
FIGURE 7-1:

dialog box

Inventory.

CHAPTER 7  Inventory Magic      157
When You Buy Stuff
As you unload items from a truck, receive them in the mail, or buy them from a 
street peddler, you have to record the items so that QuickBooks can track your 
inventory. How you record the items and pay for them depends on whether you 
pay cash on the barrelhead, receive a bill along with the items, or receive the items 
without a bill (in which case you pay for the items later).
And you may have filled out a purchase order (PO) for the items that you’re 
­receiving. If that’s the case, receiving the items gets a little easier. If you receive 
items for which you already filled out a PO, see the section “How Purchase Orders 
Work” later in this chapter. I strongly recommend filling out a PO when you order 
items that you’re going to receive and pay for later.
Recording items that you pay for up front
Okay, you just bought three porcelain chickens in the bazaar at Marrakesh, and 
now you want to add them to your inventory and record the purchase. How do you 
record inventory you paid for over the counter? By using the Write Checks window, 
of course — the same way you record any other bills you pay for up front. Just 
make sure that you fill out the Items column as I describe in Chapter 6.
Recording items that don’t come with a bill
What happens if the items come before the invoice? Lucky you — you have the 
stuff, and you don’t have to pay for it yet. However, you do have to record the 
inventory you just received so that you know you have it on hand. You can’t do 
that in the Write Checks window because you won’t be writing a check to pay for 
the stuff — at least not for a while. How do you record items that you receive 
before paying for them? Read on:
1.	 Choose Vendors ➪ Receive Items or click the Receive Inventory icon on the 
home screen, and select the option to Receive Inventory without a bill.
You see the Create Item Receipts window, as shown in Figure 7-2. This window 
is similar to the Enter Bills window that I describe in Chapter 6, but it reads Item 
Receipt. (You see the Enter Bills window again when you receive the bill for items.)
2.	 Fill in the top part of the window.
If you want to record items from a vendor who’s already in the Vendor list, click 
the down arrow and then choose the vendor. If the vendor is a new vendor, 
choose Add New from the drop-down list and then, in the New Vendor dialog 
box that appears, describe the vendor in detail. When you’re done with the 
New Vendor dialog box, click OK.

158      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
3.	 Click the Items tab.
You need to click the Items tab only if it isn’t already displayed. It probably is. 
But the computer book writers’ code of honor and a compulsive personality 
require me to tell you that there’s another tab — the Expenses tab — and you 
could possibly display it instead.
4.	 Move to the Item column and type a name for the item.
Notice the down arrow in the Item column. Click it to see the Item list. Does the 
item that you’re paying for appear on this list? If so, click it. If not, enter a new 
item name. You see the Item Not Found message box. Click Yes, fill out the 
New Item dialog box, and then click OK. (See Chapter 3 for help with describing 
new items.)
You may just as well go down the packing slip, entering the items on the Items 
tab. Make sure that the Items tab accurately shows what’s on the packing slip. 
And put a brief description of the items in the Memo field because that 
description might prove useful later, when you want to match up your item 
receipt with the bill. When you finish, the Create Item Receipts window should 
look something like what you see in Figure 7-2 (shown earlier).
FIGURE 7-2: 
The Create Item 
Receipts window.

CHAPTER 7  Inventory Magic      159
5.	 Provide quantity and cost, as follows:
•	 Qty column: Describe the quantity you received.
•	 Cost column: Describe the item unit cost. If the item unit cost you enter 
represents a change, QuickBooks asks whether you want to update its 
standard item cost (as stored in the Item list) and whether you want to 
update your standard price for the item.
6.	 Click the Save & New button or the Save & Close button to record the 
items that you just received.
The items are officially part of your inventory. The item receipt has been 
entered on the Accounts Payable register. Not only that, but you’re also all 
ready for when the bill comes.
Paying for items when you get the bill
The items arrive, and you fill out an item receipt. Three weeks pass. What’s this in 
your mailbox? Why, it’s the bill, of course! Now you have to enter a bill for the 
items that you received three weeks ago. This job is easy:
1.	 Choose Vendors ➪ Enter Bill for Received Items.
Or, from the home screen, click the Enter Bills against Inventory icon. If you’re 
in the Vendor Center, click New Transactions and then Enter Bill for Received 
Items. The Select Item Receipt dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-3.
2.	 Click the Vendor drop-down list and select the name of the vendor who 
sent you the bill.
You see one or more item receipts in the box, with the date you put on the 
receipt, its reference number, and the memo that you wrote on the receipt.
FIGURE 7-3: 
The Select Item 
Receipt dialog 
box.

160      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
3.	 Select the item receipt for which you want to enter a bill and then click OK.
The Enter Bills window appears, as shown in Figure 7-4. Does this information 
look familiar? It should — it’s the same information that you put in the Create 
Item Receipts window, only now you’re working with a bill, not a receipt.
4.	 Compare the Items tab in the window with the bill.
Are you paying for what you received earlier? Shipping charges and sales tax 
may have been added to your bill. You may also need to adjust the price 
because you may have been guessing when you recorded receiving the items. 
If so, add to and adjust the original receipt information by using the Items tab. 
(You can click the Recalculate button to add the new items.)
How many days do you have to pay this bill? Is it due now? Take a look at the 
Terms line to see what this vendor’s payment terms are. Change the payment 
terms if they’re incorrect by selecting a different entry from the drop-down list.
You want to pay your bills at the best possible time, but for you to do so, the 
terms in the Enter Bills window must match the vendor’s payment terms.
FIGURE 7-4: 
The Enter Bills 
window.

CHAPTER 7  Inventory Magic      161
5.	 Click Save & New or Save & Close to record the bill.
You still need to pay the vendor’s bill, of course. Fair enough. Take a look at 
Chapter 6 if you need help.
Recording items and paying the bill  
all at once
Suppose that you receive the bill when you receive the goods. The items are 
unloaded from the elephant’s back, and the elephant driver takes a bow and hands 
you the bill. Here are the steps you follow:
1.	 Choose Vendors ➪ Receive Items and Enter Bill.
Or, from the home screen, click Receive Inventory and then select the Receive 
Inventory with Bill option there. Or, from the Vendor Center, click New 
Transactions and then Enter Bill for Received Items. You see the Enter Bills 
window (refer to Figure 7-4). If you’ve been reading this chapter from its 
beginning, you’re familiar with this window, and you know exactly what it is 
and what it does. If you landed cold turkey on this page by way of the index, 
you need to know, for inventory purposes, how to record the items you’re 
paying for.
2.	 Fill out the top part of the window.
This stuff is pretty basic. Select a vendor from the drop-down list and make 
sure that the vendor’s terms for paying this bill are shown correctly. If this 
vendor is new, select Add New. QuickBooks asks you to fill in an information 
dialog box about the vendor. Do it. Make sure that you fill out the Bill Due line 
correctly.
3.	 Click the Items tab and list all the items that you’re paying for.
To see the Item list, move the cursor to the Item column and click the down 
arrow that appears. Make sure that the quantity and cost of the items are 
listed correctly on the Items tab.
4.	 Click Save & New or Save & Close.
QuickBooks adds the items you listed to the Item list and makes them official 
parts of your inventory.

162      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
When You Sell Stuff
In Chapter 4, I tell you how to list the items on the invoice. Maybe you noticed the 
similarities between the Items tab in the Enter Bills window and the Quantity/
Item Code/Description/Price/Each/Amount box at the bottom of an invoice. Quick-
Books uses both for keeping inventory.
When you sell stuff, QuickBooks automatically adjusts your inventory. In other 
words, if you buy 400 porcelain chickens and sell 350 of them, you have only 50 
on hand. QuickBooks updates records for this change. No muss, no fuss. Gosh, 
isn’t this great? No more lying awake at night, wondering whether you have 
enough chickens or wombats or whatever. The same thing happens when you 
make cash sales. When you list the items on the sales receipt, QuickBooks assumes 
that they’re leaving your hands and subtracts them from your inventory.
One other neat thing to note about good inventory accounting: In QuickBooks 
windows that let you enter inventory item quantities (such as the window you use 
to record an invoice), QuickBooks puts a little button inside the quantity field. You 
can click this button to see a dialog box that describes current and future avail-
ability of the item.
One moral of this story is “Keep a good, descriptive Item list.” The other moral is 
“Enter items carefully on the Items tab of checks and bills and in the Item/
Description/Qty/Rate/Amount box of sales receipts and invoices.”
How Purchase Orders Work
If you have to order stuff for your business, consider using POs. Create QuickBooks 
POs even if you order goods by phone or by telegraph or even via the World Wide 
Web  — that is, whenever you don’t request goods in writing. Filling out POs 
enables you to determine what items you have on order and when the items will 
arrive. All you’ll have to do is ask QuickBooks “What’s on order, and when’s it 
coming, anyway?” Never again will you have to rack your brain to remember 
whether you’ve ordered those thingamajigs and doohickeys.
And when the bill comes, you’ll already have it itemized on the PO form. Guess 
what? Having written all the items on your PO, you don’t have to fill out an Items 
tab on your check when you pay the bill. Or, if you’re paying bills with the accounts 
payable method, you don’t have to fill out the Items tab in the Enter Bills window. 
(Look at Chapter  6 if you don’t know what I’m talking about here.) When the 
items arrive, all you have to do is let QuickBooks know; the items are immediately 
added to your inventory list.

CHAPTER 7  Inventory Magic      163
Use POs for items that you order — that is, for items that you’ll receive and pay for 
in the future. If you buy items over the counter or receive items that you didn’t order, 
you obviously don’t need a PO. What you need to do is just pay the bill and inventory 
the items that you just bought, as I explain in the first half of this chapter.
Customizing a purchase order form
QuickBooks allows you to customize your PO form, either working from scratch to 
create an entirely new PO form or working from an existing PO template.
To create a new “from scratch” PO form, choose Vendors ➪ Create Purchase Orders 
and click the Customize Design button on the Formatting tab. QuickBooks displays 
an Intuit web page that walks you through the steps to creating your own highly 
customized form.
To customize an existing PO form, choose Vendors ➪ Create Purchase Orders and 
then click the Customize Data Layout button on the Formatting tab. QuickBooks, 
in this case, prompts you to make a copy of the purchase order form and then 
displays the Additional Customization dialog box (not shown) that supplies but-
tons and boxes that you can use to modify the standard QuickBooks PO form so 
that the data you want appears and is labeled the way you want.
The Additional Customization dialog box provides a Preview area you can use to 
see what your changes look like and a Cancel button if things get terribly out of 
hand. Furthermore, the Additional Customization dialog box provides a Layout 
Designer button, which you can click to open the Layout Designer window. The 
Layout Designer window allows you to become a true layout artist and make all 
sorts of changes in the overall look of your PO simply by moving fields around the 
page with your mouse.
The Manage Templates button, also available on the Formatting tab, lets you 
choose the PO form you want to customize when you’ve previously created more 
than one form.
Filling out a purchase order
Perhaps you’re running low on gizmos, doohickeys, or some other item on your 
Item list, and you’re ready to reorder these things — whatever they are. Follow 
these steps to fill out a PO:
1.	 Choose Vendors ➪ Create Purchase Orders.
You could also click the Purchase Orders icon on the home screen, or click the 
New Transactions area of the Vendor Center and then select Purchase Orders. 

164      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
You see the Create Purchase Orders window, which is similar to what’s shown 
in Figure 7-5. Note that the exact details of this window depend on how you 
customize your PO form.
2.	 Choose a vendor from the Vendor drop-down list.
Click the down arrow to see a list of your vendors. Click a vendor to see its 
name and address in the Vendor box. If you can’t find the name of the vendor 
on your list, click Add New from the list and then fill in the information about 
the vendor in the resulting New Vendor dialog box. Click OK when you’re done 
with the dialog box.
3.	 If you track your inventory by class, select a class from the Class drop-
down list.
The Create Purchase Orders window may not have a Class drop-down list. If it 
doesn’t, and you want it to have one, you have to set up QuickBooks to track 
expenses by class. To do so, open the QuickBooks file in single-user mode as 
the administrator. Then choose Edit ➪ Preferences and click the Accounting 
icon in the list on the left. (You may also need to click the Company Preferences 
tab.) Finally, select the Use Class Tracking check box and then click OK.
FIGURE 7-5: 
The Create 
Purchase Orders 
window.

CHAPTER 7  Inventory Magic      165
4.	 (Optional) Select a Rep, an Expected Date, and a FOB (which I describe in 
Chapter 4) if you’re using them on your PO.
You may have to fill in other fields before you get to the item-by-item descrip-
tions at the bottom. Again, these fields may not appear if you haven’t indicated 
that you want them on your form.
5.	 Move to the Item column and start entering the items you’re ordering.
Entering the items is the most important part of creating a PO. When you move 
into the Item column, it turns into a drop-down list. Click its down arrow to see 
the Item list. You may need to scroll to the item that you want to enter. A fast 
way to scroll to the item is to type the first few letters of the item name. If you 
type the name of an item that isn’t on the Item list, QuickBooks asks whether 
you want to set up this item. If so, click Set Up and then fill in the New Item 
dialog box.
Enter as many items as you want in the Item column. QuickBooks fills in an item 
description for you, but you can edit whatever it puts in the Description column, 
if need be. In the Qty column, indicate how many of each item you need.
6.	 If you want to, fill in the Vendor Message field — but definitely fill in the 
Memo field.
The Vendor Message field is where you put a message to the party receiving 
your order. You could write Get me this stuff pronto!
No matter what you do, be sure to fill in the Memo field. What you write in this 
field appears in the Open Purchase Orders dialog box, and this info is the 
surest way for you to identify what this PO is for. Write something meaningful 
that you can understand two weeks, three weeks, or a month from now, when 
you pay for the items that you’re ordering.
At the top of the Create Purchase Orders window is the Print Later check box, 
which tells you whether you want to print this PO. If you want to print the PO, 
make sure that this check box is selected. After you print the PO, the check 
mark disappears from the box.
7.	 Click Print to print the PO.
If this PO is one of many that you’ve been filling out and you want to print 
several at once, click the arrow below the Print button and select Batch from 
the drop-down list. Before you print the PO, however, you may want to click 
the down arrow below the Print button and select Preview to see what the PO 
will look like when you print it. QuickBooks shows you an onscreen replica of 
the PO. I hope it looks okay.

166      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
You use the History button after you receive the items you’ve so carefully listed 
on the PO. After you receive the items and record their receipt, clicking this 
button tells QuickBooks to give you the entire history of an item — when you 
ordered it and when you received it.
As for the other buttons at the top, I think that you know what those are.
8.	 Click Save & New or Save & Close to record the PO.
QuickBooks saves the PO and displays a new, blank PO window in which you 
can enter another order.
Checking up on purchase orders
You record the POs. A couple of weeks go by, and you ask yourself, “Did I order 
those doohickeys from Acme?” Choose Reports ➪ Purchases ➪ Open Purchase 
Orders to see a report that lists outstanding POs. Or click the Reports Center, select 
Purchases in the left column, click the List view button in the top-right corner to 
get an actual list of purchasing reports, and then click the Open Purchase Orders 
report. Alternatively, you can also use the Report Center carousel to page through 
the reports in a category: To use the carousel, select Purchases in the left column, 
click the Carousel view button (next to the List view button), and then click the 
stack-of-reports image that appears to the left or the right of the picture of the 
selected report.
Receiving purchase order items
After your doohickeys and gizmos have arrived by camel train, you need to record 
the receipt of the items and add them to your Item list.
The first two things to do are to note whether the stuff came with a bill and then 
decide how you want to pay for it. These decisions are the same ones that you have 
to make if you receive goods without having first filled out a PO.
You record PO items that you receive the same way you record other items you 
receive:
»
» If you pay for PO items with a check, use the Write Checks window.
»
» If you receive the PO items without a bill, use the Create Item Receipts 
window.
»
» If you receive the PO items with a bill, use the Enter Bills window.

CHAPTER 7  Inventory Magic      167
Regardless of the window you’re using, when you select the vendor who sold you 
the PO items, QuickBooks alerts you that open POs exist for the vendor and asks 
you whether you want to receive against a PO. Of course you do. (Receive against 
simply means to compare what you ordered with what you received.) When you 
click Yes, QuickBooks displays the Open Purchase Orders dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 7-6. Select the PO(s) that you’re receiving against and then click OK. Quick-
Books fills out the Items tab to show all the stuff you ordered. If what QuickBooks 
shows isn’t what you received, you may have to make adjustments.
Assembling a Product
QuickBooks Premier and Enterprise Solutions include a cool tool for accounting for 
the manufacture of items. Suppose that Pine Lake Porcelain — the example busi-
ness I use in this book — mostly just buys and resells coffee mugs and other por-
celain doodads. But also suppose that once a year, Pine Lake Porcelain assembles a 
romantic collection of red coffee mugs into a boxed St. Valentine’s Day gift set. In 
this case, QuickBooks can record the assembly of a boxed gift set that combines, for 
example, six red coffee mugs, a red foil cardboard box, and some red tissue paper.
Identifying the components
Each component that makes up the assembly — in this example, the St. Valentine’s 
Day boxed gift set — needs to be an item in your Item list. The assembled item also 
needs to be an item in your Item list. Chapter 3 describes how to add items to the 
Item list, so I don’t repeat that information here. But let me just say that if you box 
up six red coffee mugs with a couple of pieces of tissue paper, you need individual 
inventory part items for the coffee mugs, the box, and the tissue paper. Then you 
also need an assembly item that says the gift box includes six red mugs, a red box 
(say), and also a couple of pieces of red tissue paper that loved ones can use when 
they become emotionally overwhelmed by the generosity of this thoughtful gift.
Figure 7-7 shows the New Item dialog box filled in so as to set up a Valentines Box 
assembly item.
FIGURE 7-6:

Purchase Orders 
dialog box.

168      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Building the assembly
To build an assembly, choose Vendors ➪ Inventory Activities ➪ Build Assemblies. 
Or, if you’re on the home screen, click the Build Assemblies icon in the Company 
area. QuickBooks displays the Build Assemblies window, as shown in Figure 7-8. 
All you do is select the item that you want to build from the Assembly Item drop-
down list and then you select the quantity that you (or some hapless co-worker) 
entered in the Quantity to Build text box (in the lower-right corner). Then you 
click either the Build & Close button or the Build & New button. (Click Build & New 
if you want to record the assembly of some other items.)
While I’m on the subject, let me make a handful of observations about the Build 
Assemblies window and the Build Assemblies command:
»
» In the top-middle portion of the window, QuickBooks shows the quantities of 
the assembly that you have on hand and for which customers have placed 
orders. That’s pretty useful information to have, so hey — remember that 
it’s there.
»
» The main part of the Build Assemblies window shows you what goes into your 
product. Not that you care, but this is called a bill of materials.
FIGURE 7-7: 
The New Item 
dialog box filled 
out to describe a 
new assembly.

CHAPTER 7  Inventory Magic      169
»
» At the bottom of the bill of materials list, QuickBooks shows you the maximum 
number of assemblies you can make, given your current inventory holdings.
»
» When you build an item, QuickBooks adjusts the inventory item counts. In the 
case of boxed gift sets — each with six red coffee mugs, one piece of wrap-
ping tissue, and a cardboard box — QuickBooks reduces the item counts of 
red coffee mugs, wrapping tissues, and boxes, and increases the item counts 
of the boxed gift sets when you record building the assembly.
»
» Some of the components used in an assembly may not be inventory items. 
When you use noninventory parts in an assembly, QuickBooks doesn’t care 
about the item counts.
Time for a Reality Check
QuickBooks does a pretty good job of tracking inventory, but you’re still going to 
have to regularly take a complete physical inventory of what you have in stock. 
What I’m saying here is that occasionally, you’re going to have to go over every-
thing and count it by hand. Sorry. You just can’t avoid that chore.
FIGURE 7-8: 
The Build 
Assemblies

170      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
QuickBooks can produce a handy physical inventory worksheet that you and 
your minions can use to count inventory. To produce this report, choose 
­Vendors ➪ Inventory Activities ➪ Physical Inventory Worksheet. Then, after Quick-
Books displays an onscreen version of this worksheet report, click the Print button 
to print hard copies of the worksheet. You can use the printed worksheet to record 
actual physical counts of the inventory items you hold.
After you make your count, what happens if your inventory figures differ from 
those QuickBooks has? First, you have to decide who’s right: you or a computer 
program. You’re right, probably. Products get dropped. They break. And that 
means that you have to adjust the QuickBooks inventory numbers.
Choose Vendors ➪ Inventory Activities ➪ Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand. Or click 
the Adjust Quantity on Hand icon in the Company section of the home screen.
With the Adjust Quantity/Value on Hand window displayed (see Figure 7-9), click 
the Find & Select Items button to display a dialog box that lets you select those 
items you want to adjust and then click that dialog box’s Add Selected Items but-
ton. Then select an account for storing your inventory adjustments from the 
Adjustment Account drop-down list. You also can select a class from the Class 
drop-down list.
FIGURE 7-9:

Quantity/Value 
on Hand window.

CHAPTER 7  Inventory Magic      171
For what it’s worth, some accountants like to use a special inventory adjustments 
expense account to provide a way to see the total inventory adjustments over the year.
Go down the Item column, selecting items from the Item list whose counts you 
need to update. When you select an item, QuickBooks shows the item count that it 
thinks is correct in the Qty on Hand column. If this count is wrong, enter the 
­correct count in the New Quantity column. Click Save & Close when you’re done.
Dealing with Multiple Inventory Locations
If you’ve read this chapter to this point, you’ve seen how QuickBooks handles your 
inventory. With rather elegant simplicity, QuickBooks gets the job done well for 
many businesses.
Unfortunately, I’ve encountered a real headache when using the most common 
versions of QuickBooks for inventory. What if you store inventory in multiple 
locations — such as a Michigan warehouse and a Chicago distribution facility —  
or in a couple of retail locations — one on the right side of the tracks and the other 
one on the wrong side of the tracks?
The problem is that QuickBooks is set up to deal with a single inventory location. 
So although you can know how much inventory you have in total, if you aren’t 
careful, you won’t know how much is in Michigan and how much is in Chicago. 
And you can’t even really check on inventory shrinkage because QuickBooks’ 
records don’t tie to location-specific inventory counts.
Now, I need to tell you up front that you don’t have any cheap, good way to deal with 
this in versions of QuickBooks. You do have a couple of sloppy cheap fixes, as 
described in the following paragraphs. And you have a good — though expensive —  
way, which is stepping up to the Enterprise Solutions version of QuickBooks.
Manually keep separate inventory-by- 
location counts
If you have only a handful of items in your little business — say, a few dozen — 
it’s pretty easy to keep a simple manual running tab on what you have in the 
Michigan warehouse and what’s in the Chicago distribution facility.
Such a system is very . . . er, crude. It may just be a couple of sticky notes stuck to 
your computer monitor. No kidding. Still, it lets you know how much inventory 
you have (roughly) and where it’s stored. And for some purposes, that works okay.

172      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Use different item numbers for different 
locations
The embarrassingly crude approach that I describe in the preceding section 
doesn’t work if you have a lot of items, so the approach won’t work for a multiple- 
location retailer. Accordingly, if you’re a retailer with a large number of items, I’m 
sorry, but I think you probably need to create sets of item numbers for each inven-
tory location. This means a lot more work for you, of course, but it’s really the only 
practical way to handle your inventory if you have more than a handful of items.
Upgrade to QuickBooks Enterprise 
­Solutions
If you want a really robust approach to inventory management, including the 
capability to deal with multiple inventory locations, you should consider stepping 
up to the Enterprise Solutions version of QuickBooks.
QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions effectively deals with situations where you’re 
holding inventory in multiple locations and transferring inventory between loca-
tions with the Advanced Inventory feature. The Enterprise Solutions of QuickBooks 
further supercharges inventory management by supporting serial numbers and lot 
tracking, so businesses can closely track batches of inventory items and even spe-
cific items. I don’t discuss the Enterprise Solutions tools for QuickBooks here, but 
you can read online help if you have the Enterprise version of QuickBooks.
Note: QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions costs considerably more than QuickBooks 
Pro and QuickBooks Premier. At this writing, for example, the Intuit website 
quotes the price for up to five users as roughly $3,500. And the advanced inven-
tory features I talk about in the preceding paragraphs run roughly about another 
grand a year. You can, by the way, step up the number of QuickBooks Enterprise 
Solutions users for additional money. You pay roughly (and I’m giving you a ball-
park number) $10,000 to have up to 30 users. Keep an eye out for discounts.
The Lazy Person’s Approach to Inventory
The inventory accounting approach that I describe in the previous paragraphs of 
this chapter is the textbook approach. What’s more, the approach is a really good 
one, because it lets you accurately calculate your cost of goods sold and accurately 
estimate the value of the inventory you’re holding. To paraphrase Martha Stewart, 
these are Good Things.

CHAPTER 7  Inventory Magic      173
You should know, however, that you can use a simpler approach to inventory 
accounting. Specifically, rather than keeping track of individual inventory items 
by using a perpetual inventory system — which simply means that you track each 
item when it moves into your business and out into a customer’s car or ­minivan —  
you can use a simple periodic system. In the sections that follow, I tell you how a 
periodic inventory system works in QuickBooks. Then I tell you what’s bad and 
what’s good about using a periodic inventory system.
How periodic inventory systems work in 
QuickBooks
If you use a periodic inventory system, you set up an Other Current Asset type 
account called Inventory. Then, whenever you purchase inventory, you categorize 
the inventory purchase as falling into this fake inventory account. (I’m calling the 
account a “fake” inventory account because it isn’t a real inventory account to 
QuickBooks.)
To record your cost of goods sold each month, you use a journal entry to move an 
appropriate portion out of the fake inventory account and into your cost-of- 
goods-sold account. How do you know what portion you should move? Good 
question. In a nutshell, you guess based on your historical cost-of-goods-sold 
percentage.
Here’s an example of how this works: Suppose that since time immemorial, your 
cost of goods sold has run 45 percent of your sales revenue, and that last month, 
you sold $10,000 worth of stuff. In this case, you’d figure that 45 percent of 
$10,000 ($4,500) equals the cost of the inventory that you sold. Accordingly, 
you’d move $4,500 out of the fake inventory account and into cost of goods sold.
Predictably, this rough-and-ready approach means that your inventory and cost- 
of-goods-sold numbers are going to be wrong. So at the end of the year, you still 
perform a physical inventory count to figure out exactly what you truly hold in 
inventory. At that point, you’d adjust the inventory and cost-of-goods-sold 
­balances so that they match what your physical inventory shows.
It may be that over the course of the year, your rough 45 percent number has 
meant that you moved $5,000 too much from inventory to cost of goods sold. In 
this case, you’d move $5,000 out of cost of goods sold and back to inventory. Or 
you may find that you moved $5,000 too little from inventory to cost of goods 
sold. To fix that problem, you move another $5,000 from inventory to cost of 
goods sold.

174      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
A final quick point about using a periodic inventory: As I note in this little discus-
sion, you don’t use inventory items if you’re using a periodic inventory. So what 
you put on invoices or sales receipts is just a generic, noninventory part item.
The good and bad of a periodic inventory
A periodic inventory system is good for some types of businesses. If you have too 
many items to track with the QuickBooks Item list, for example, the approach that 
I describe here can be a lifesaver.
Periodic inventory systems create some problems, however. Here are the four big-
gest and baddest problems in my mind:
»
» You won’t really know which items are selling well and which aren’t because 
you won’t be tracking sales by inventory items. This means that you can’t stock 
more of the hot-selling stuff and less of stuff that’s not selling.
»
» You won’t know what you really hold in your inventory except when you take 
that year-end physical inventory. (You won’t know how many dollars’ worth of 
inventory you’re holding or which item quantities you’re holding.)
»
» Because you won’t make item-level adjustments based on your physical 
inventory, you won’t know which items are prone to shrinkage from problems 
such as theft, breakage, and spoilage.
»
» You’ll need to make the journal entries that record the dollars moving out of 
inventory and into cost of goods sold. These journal entries aren’t terribly 
difficult, but they can be a little bit tricky to figure out the first few times.
You need to decide whether you want or need to go with a simpler periodic inven-
tory system in spite of the problems such a system presents. The final thought 
that I leave you with is this: Many small businesses, especially small retailers, 
successfully use periodic inventory systems.

n a sense, a small business’s finances and cash flows revolve around the busi-
ness’s checkbook, which means that this chapter is mighty important. Here, 
you’re finally going to see how to do those everyday checkbook things with 
QuickBooks: entering checks, deposits, and transfers. Along the way, you also find 
out about some neat tools that QuickBooks provides for making these tasks easier, 
faster, and more precise.
Writing Checks
Chapter 6 shows you the two ways to write checks: from the Write Checks window 
and from the register. In case you were asleep in the back row of the class, here’s 
the short version of the instructions for writing checks.
You can record debit card and ATM transactions the same way that you record 
checks that you write.
Chapter 8

176      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Writing checks from the Write  
Checks window
You can record handwritten checks and other checks that you want to print with 
QuickBooks by describing the checks in the Write Checks window.
To write a check from the Write Checks window, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Write Checks.
You can also click the Write Checks icon located in the Banking section of 
the home screen. QuickBooks displays the Write Checks window, as shown 
in Figure 8-1.
2.	 Click the Bank Account drop-down list at the top of the window and 
select the account from which you want to write this check.
This step is really important and is something that you should always remem-
ber to do before you write a check if you have multiple bank accounts.
FIGURE 8-1: 
The Write Checks 
window.

CHAPTER 8  Keeping Your Checkbook      177
3.	 Enter a check number or mark the check for printing.
Select the Print Later check box if you plan on printing the check with QuickBooks, 
using your printer and preprinted check forms that you’ve purchased. (I describe 
this process in Chapter 10.) If you’re recording a check you wrote by hand, enter 
the check number you used for the check in the No. text box.
4.	 Fill in the check.
If you’ve written a check to this person or party before, the AutoFill feature fills 
in the name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line for you after you start 
typing the name. How QuickBooks manages this feat may seem akin to magic, 
but it’s really not that tough. QuickBooks just compares what you’ve typed so 
far with names in your lists of customers, employees, and others. As soon as 
QuickBooks can match the letters that you’ve typed with a name in one of 
these lists, it grabs the name.
If you haven’t written a check to this person or party before, QuickBooks asks 
you to add the payee name. Do that. (If you’re not sure whether you want to 
add a payee or how to add a payee, read Chapter 6.)
Enter the amount of the check next to the dollar sign and then press Tab. 
QuickBooks writes the amount for you on the Dollars line. It also writes the 
address if it’s been filled out in the payee’s master file.
5.	 Fill in the Expenses and Items tabs, if necessary.
Don’t know what these are? Chapter 6 explains them in minute detail.
6.	 Click the Save & Close button or the Save & New button to finish writing 
the check.
There you have it. Your check is written and entered in the register, ready to be 
printed and mailed.
Writing checks from the register
People who’ve grown accustomed to Quicken, a cousin of QuickBooks, might want 
to use the register window to write checks. (Quicken users like the register meta-
phor better, I guess.)
To write a check from the register, follow these steps:
1.	 Open the register.
Choose Banking ➪ Use Register or click the Register icon in the Banking area of 
the home screen. If you have more than one bank account, QuickBooks displays 
the Use Register dialog box so that you can select the proper account.

178      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
From the drop-down list, choose the checking account against which you want 
to write the check and then click OK. You see the register window (shown in 
Figure 8-2). The cursor is at the end of the register, ready for you to enter check 
information. (QuickBooks automatically fills in today’s date.)
QuickBooks uses the account name in the window title. This is why the figure 
refers to Big National Bank. Big National is the name of the fictitious bank 
account that I set up.
2.	 Fill in the information for your check.
Notice that the entries you make in this register are the same ones that you’d 
make in the Write Checks window. If you’re more comfortable entering checks 
in that window, you can click the Edit Transaction button, which is at the top of 
the register window, to see the Write Checks window in all its glory and write a 
check there. In fact, if you want to enter expenses or itemize what you’re paying 
for with the check, you have to click the Edit Transaction button and get into the 
Write Checks window.
Otherwise, just go from field to field and enter the information in the register. 
Once again, use the drop-down lists to enter the Payee and Account names. If 
you enter a Payee or Account name that QuickBooks doesn’t recognize, the 
program asks you to give more information.
FIGURE 8-2: 
The register 
window.

CHAPTER 8  Keeping Your Checkbook      179
Here’s sort of a trick question: What if the check you’re writing pays more than 
one category of expense? Suppose that you pay your landlord for both your 
rent and a share of the utilities. Are you limited to one expense account? Do 
you face the mother of all accounting dilemmas: choosing between two correct 
accounts? Well, no, you don’t. You can just click the Splits button. QuickBooks 
displays a splits area that you can use to split a check across several different 
accounts. A $1,500 check that pays $1,200 of rent and $300 of utilities, for 
example, can split onto two separate lines: one that records the $1,200 of rent 
expense and one that records the $300 of utilities expense.
3.	 When you finish filling in the check information, click the Record button.
You can also click the Restore button if you decide that you want to go back to 
start over again. Clicking Restore blanks out what you just entered.
If you write checks by hand, as opposed to printing them with QuickBooks, make 
sure that the check numbers in the register and the check numbers in your check-
book match. You may need to go into the QuickBooks register and change numbers 
in the Number column. When your bank statement comes, reconciling your bank 
statement and your checkbook is much easier if you enter check numbers 
correctly.
Changing a check that you’ve written
What if you need to change a check after you’ve already entered it? Perhaps you 
made a terrible mistake, such as recording a $52.50 check as $25.20. Can you fix 
it? Sure. Just go into the register and find the check that you want to change. Go to 
the Payment or Deposit field and make the change.
If you have more extensive changes to make (if the check is a split transaction, for 
example), put the cursor where the check is and click Edit Transaction. QuickBooks 
displays the Write Checks window with the original check in it. Make the changes. 
(Don’t forget to make changes on the Items and Expenses tabs, too, if necessary.)
When you finish, click Save & Close. You go back to the register, where you see the 
changes in the check.
If you have the Write Checks window displayed, you can also use the Next and 
Previous buttons to page through your checks and make any changes.
Packing more checks into the register
Usually, QuickBooks displays two rows of information about each check you enter. 
It also displays two rows of information about each type of transaction that you 
enter. If you want to pack more checks into a visible portion of the register, select 

180      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
the 1-Line check box at the bottom of the register window. When you select this 
check box, QuickBooks uses a single-line format to display all the information in 
the register except the Memo field. (See Figure 8-3.)
Compare Figure 8-2 with Figure 8-3 to see what the 1-Line display looks like. 
Registers can get awfully long, and the 1-Line display is helpful when you’re look-
ing through a long register for a check or transaction.
FIGURE 8-3: 
The register 
window in 1-Line 
display.
PAYING FOR ITEMS WITH CASH
To track petty-cash purchases, you need a petty-cash account. You can set up a petty-
cash account (which works just like a bank account) by following the steps in “Setting up 
a second bank account” later in this chapter. To record purchases that you make from 
the money in that coffee can beside your desk, use the petty-cash register. You can 
record cash purchases just like you record checks. (You don’t need to worry about using 
the correct check numbers when you record cash purchases, of course; you can just use 
the numbers 1, 2, 3, and so on.) To record cashed checking withdrawals to be used for 
petty cash in the office, just record the withdrawal as a transfer to your petty-cash 
account, as I describe later in the chapter.

CHAPTER 8  Keeping Your Checkbook      181
Depositing Money in a Checking Account
You can’t write checks unless you deposit some money in your checking account. 
You didn’t know that? Well, the next time you’re taking your exercise in the prison 
yard, give it some serious thought. From time to time, you must deposit money in 
your checking account and record those deposits in the register.
You can record deposits in two ways. Find out about those ways in the following 
sections.
Recording simple deposits
If you have a simple deposit to make — a sum of money that didn’t come from one 
of your customers — just make the deposit directly in the register.
Suppose that your elderly Aunt Iris sends you $100 with a note explaining how 
more than 80 years ago, Great-Uncle Bert started his hammock manufacturing 
business with only $100, and for good luck, Aunt Iris is sending you $100 to help 
you along.
Recording a simple deposit is . . . well, pretty simple. Follow these steps:
1.	 Open the register.
Choose Banking ➪ Use Register, or click the Register icon in the Banking section 
of the home screen. If you have more than one bank account, QuickBooks 
displays the Use Register dialog box. Select the checking account in which you 
want to make the deposit, and click OK. QuickBooks displays the register 
window (refer to Figure 8-2).
2.	 In the Date column, enter the date on which you made the deposit.
3.	 In the Payee column, enter the name of the person or business that sent 
you money.
Don’t worry if QuickBooks adds a check number in the Number field when you 
move to the Payee column. When you enter a deposit amount, QuickBooks 
changes the Number field to DEP (for deposit, of course).
4.	 Enter the amount that you’re depositing.
Move the cursor to the Deposit column and enter the amount.
5.	 Enter an account for this deposit.
Move to the Account field, click the down arrow, and choose an account from the 
list. For a gift like this, you’ll likely choose an account like Uncategorized Income.

182      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
6.	 Click the Record button.
Your deposit is entered, and your checking account’s balance is fattened 
accordingly. Note that all entries in the register are made in chronological 
order, with deposits first and checks next.
Depositing income from customers
Depositing income from customers is a little more complicated if you issue invoices 
and receive payments, because it involves using the Payments to Deposit dialog 
box. Have you been recording customer payments as they come in? (You do so by 
choosing Customers ➪ Receive Payments or Customers ➪ Enter Sales Receipts, as I 
describe in Chapter 5; by selecting the Create Sales Receipts or Receive Payments 
icon on the home screen; or by clicking the Customer Center and selecting New 
Transactions, Sales Receipts, or Receive Payments.) If you’ve recorded customer 
payments and told QuickBooks to group them with your other undeposited funds, 
QuickBooks places these payments in your Undeposited Funds account. Now all you 
have to do is transfer the undeposited funds to your checking account. Here’s how:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Make Deposits.
You can also click the Record Deposits icon in the Banking section of the home 
screen. Because you have undeposited funds, you see the Payments to Deposit 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-4. This dialog box lists the checks that you’ve 
received but haven’t put in a checking account or other bank account yet.
FIGURE 8-4: 
The Payments 
to Deposit 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 8  Keeping Your Checkbook      183
The View Payment Method Type drop-down list lets you see payments of only 
a particular type: cash, check, American Express, and so on. If you group 
deposits by payment type, this list works as a slick tool to group transactions 
that you’ll deposit together.
2.	 Select the checks that you want to deposit and then click OK.
Place a check mark (click the column) next to the checks that you want to 
deposit. If you want to deposit all the checks, click the Select All button.
The Make Deposits window appears, as shown in Figure 8-5. Do you recognize 
the information in the middle of the window? It describes the checks that you 
just selected to be deposited.
You want to make sure that the deposit total shown in the Make Deposits 
window is the right deposit amount — in other words, the actual amount truly 
deposited in the bank account. When you attempt to reconcile the bank 
account, you’ll compare the deposit total shown here with your bank state-
ment’s cleared deposits amount.
3.	 Select the checking account to receive these deposits.
Select the account from the Deposit To drop-down list at the top of the 
window. While you’re at it, make sure that the Date field shows the date you’ll 
FIGURE 8-5: 
The Make 
Deposits window.

184      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
deposit these checks in your checking account. In other words, if you’re not 
going to make it to the bank or the ATM until tomorrow, put tomorrow’s date 
in the Date text box.
4.	 Add any other noncustomer deposits to include on the deposit slip.
If your grandma (bless her heart) gave you 1,000 pennies in 20 rolls, for 
example, that’s an extra $10 that you can record on this deposit slip. At the bot-
tom of the list of payments, enter the name of the person who gave you the 
cash; the account; a memo; a check number; the payment method (cash, in 
this case); a class, if you’re using classes; and the amount.
5.	 (Optional) Write a note to yourself in the Memo box to describe this 
deposit.
6.	 Click the Print button to get a hard copy of the deposit slip.
Many banks accept this deposit slip, so you can print it and put it in the 
envelope with your ATM deposit or hand it to the bank clerk. Whatever you 
write on the memo appears on the register. (You should probably write a 
memo to yourself in case you need to know what this deposit is years from 
now, when you’re old and dotty.)
7.	 Record any cash back that you plan to get with the deposit.
If you need to get cash to replenish your petty-cash account, select the account 
from the Cash Back Goes To drop-down list, write a memo, and then record 
the amount of cash that you want to get back from the deposit.
8.	 Click the Save & Close button at the bottom of the Make Deposits 
window.
The deposit is recorded in QuickBooks. It appears in your register next to the 
letters DEP.
Transferring Money between Accounts
Account transfers occur when you move money from one account to another — for 
example, from your savings account to your checking account. But jeepers, why 
am I telling you this? If you have one of those combined savings and checking 
accounts, you probably do this sort of thing all the time.
Oh, now I remember why I brought this up: QuickBooks makes quick work of 
account transfers as long as you’ve already set up both accounts.

CHAPTER 8  Keeping Your Checkbook      185
Setting up a second bank account
If you haven’t set up a second account, you need to set one up. To do so, open the 
Chart of Accounts by choosing Lists ➪ Chart of Accounts, or just click the Chart of 
Accounts icon on the home screen in the Company section. Click the Bank button 
and then choose Continue. When QuickBooks displays the Add New Account dialog 
box, fill in the name of the account and (if you want) a description of the account, 
the bank account and routing numbers, and other information you want to store.
Recording deposits into the new account
You record initial deposits the way I describe earlier in this chapter (either as 
simple deposits or as customer deposits, whatever the case may be).
You record an initial transfer by completing the following steps:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Transfer Funds.
You see the Transfer Funds Between Accounts window, as shown in Figure 8-6.
2.	 Select the bank account from which you’re going to transfer the money.
From the Transfer Funds From drop-down list at the top of the window, choose 
the account.
3.	 Select the bank account to which you want to transfer the money.
From the Transfer Funds To drop-down list, select the account that receives the 
funds.
4.	 Enter the amount that you want to transfer and, optionally, fill in the 
Memo box.
Provide the transfer amount for the obvious reason: QuickBooks can’t read 
your mind.
FIGURE 8-6: 
The Transfer 
Funds Between 
Accounts window.

186      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
5.	 Click the Save & New button or the Save & Close button.
QuickBooks records the transfer, which you can confirm by opening your 
register. The transfer shows the letters TRANSFR in the Type column and the 
name of the account to which you transferred the money in the Account 
column. The amount that you transferred appears in the Payment column 
(because you transferred the funds out of this account). Figure 8-7 shows a 
$10,000 transfer — in the figure, the selected transaction is the one I’m talking 
about — from a checking account called Big National Bank to a savings account 
called Little Trust & Savings. You can tell that this transaction is a transfer 
because the other account name shows up in the Account box.
About the other half of the transfer
Here’s the cool thing about transfer transactions: QuickBooks automatically 
records the other half of the transfer for you. Figure 8-8 shows the other half of 
the transfer from Figure 8-7. This register is for a savings account called Little 
Trust & Savings. The $10,000 transfer from your checking account actually made 
it into your savings account. The transfer once again shows up as a TRANSFR.
FIGURE 8-7: 
A transfer 
transaction in the 
register.

CHAPTER 8  Keeping Your Checkbook      187
Changing a transfer that you’ve  
already entered
Big surprise here, but changing a transfer that you already entered works just like 
changing a check. First, you find the transfer in the account register; then you 
click the Edit Transaction button. You see the Transfer Funds Between Accounts 
window with the transfer check that you wrote. Make changes to the check and 
then click Save & New or Save & Close. You return to the register, where your 
deposit is adjusted accordingly.
Working with Multiple Currencies
If you tell QuickBooks that you need to do your accounting in multiple currencies —  
something you do in the Pro, Premier, and Enterprise Solutions editions by choosing 
Edit ➪ Preferences, selecting Multiple Currencies, clicking the Company Preferences 
tab, and then clicking the Yes I Use More Than One Currency button — QuickBooks 
reconfigures its operation and appearance so you can work with more than one 
currency.
FIGURE 8-8: 
The other half of 
the transfer 
transaction.

188      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
As you might expect, given that this is QuickBooks I’m talking about, working 
with multiple currencies isn’t that complicated. (This includes both foreign 
­currencies, like the Euro, and virtual currencies.) To go “multiple currencies,” you 
simply identify the currency that you’ll use for specific bank accounts, customers, 
and vendors. Thereafter, QuickBooks assumes that when you’re recording trans-
actions for these bank accounts, customers, and vendors, you’re working in the 
specified currency. QuickBooks clearly identifies the specified currency in win-
dows and dialog boxes next to amount boxes.
To enable you to convert foreign (including virtual) currencies to your home cur-
rency, QuickBooks also adds a Currency List command to the Lists menu, which 
you use to track currencies and their exchange rates so you can translate transac-
tions denominated in a foreign (or virtual) currency into your home currency.
To Delete or to Void?
What happens if you put a transaction — a deposit, check, or transfer payment — in 
a register and later decide that it shouldn’t be there? You have two ways of handling 
this situation. If you want to keep a record of the transaction but render it moot, 
meaningless, or nada, you void the transaction. But if you want to obliterate the 
transaction from the face of the Earth as though it never happened, you delete it.
Decide whether you want to void or delete the transaction and then follow these 
steps:
1.	 Find the transaction in the register.
In the upcoming section “The Big Register Phenomenon,” I tell you some quick 
ways to find transactions.
2.	 Choose either Edit ➪ Delete Check or Edit ➪ Void Check and then click the 
Record button.
3.	 Accept any offers of help from QuickBooks.
QuickBooks may ask you whether you want to add a journal entry to make 
sure that the transaction affects the current accounting period and not the 
earlier period. Suppose that you use years as your accounting periods and that 
you’re voiding a transaction in December of last year. In this case, QuickBooks 
helpfully enters some journal entries that let you void the original “bad” 
transaction but that in effect record the change in this year’s numbers, not in 
last year’s numbers. You’ll want to take QuickBooks up on this offer if you don’t 
want a previous year’s numbers changing (perhaps because you’ve closed the 
books on the previous year).

CHAPTER 8  Keeping Your Checkbook      189
There; the deed is done. Figure 8-9 shows a register window with a voided check. 
The voided transaction is the one selected. Notice the word VOID in the Memo 
column. If this check had been deleted, it wouldn’t even show up in the register. 
An alternative method is to select the check in the register or on the check 
screen and then right-click and choose Void Check from the shortcut menu.
The Edit menu changes depending on what kind of transaction shows or is selected 
in the open window (that is, Void Deposit, Void Check, and so on).
Handling NSF Checks from Customers
I’ve had a handful of reader questions about how to handle insufficient-funds 
(NSF) check transactions. Here’s how I suggest handling this situation:
1.	 Record the service charge that the bank charges you for handling the 
bounced check, just like any other bank service charge.
You can enter a transaction directly into the register, for example. You can 
even record the bank service fee as though it’s a check that you just wrote. 
FIGURE 8-9: 
The register 
shows a voided 
check.

190      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Anything coming out of your account is entered just like a check. (Refer to the 
earlier discussions in this chapter for information on entering transactions in 
the register or on recording checks.)
2.	 Record the adjustment to your bank account balance because the 
customer’s check didn’t clear as a withdrawal or payment.
You can use a bad-debt expense account to categorize the expense of the 
bounced check if you’re on the accrual basis for taxes; otherwise, cash-basis 
companies should directly charge their sales income account to reduce their 
income.
3.	 (Optional) Try to collect on the check again.
Try running by the customer’s bank. You might also try to assess the customer 
a bounced-check fee. (See Chapter 4 for information on invoicing customers.) 
But be honest: You’re probably not going to be able to collect, are you? So write 
a note in the customer’s master file that says not to take any checks. It will 
appear right in the middle of the Customer Center screen when you select that 
customer to record the next sale.
4.	 Post a huge copy of the check in your cash register area so the customer’s 
friends and family see the check.
I’m just joking about this. But you know that.
The Big Register Phenomenon
If you start entering checks, deposits, and transfers in your registers, you soon 
find yourself with registers that contain hundreds, and even thousands, of trans-
actions. You can still work with one of these big registers by using the tools and 
techniques that I talk about in the preceding paragraphs. Nevertheless, let me give 
you some more help for dealing with (drum roll, please) the big register 
phenomenon.
Moving through a big register
You can use the Page Up and Page Down keys to move up and down through your 
register a screenful of transactions at a time. Some people call this activity scrolling. 
You can call it whatever you want.
You can also use the Home key to move through the register. Press the Home key 
once to move to the front of the field you’re currently in. Press the Home key twice 
to move to the first field of the transaction you’re on (the Date field), or press it 
three times to move to the first transaction in the register.

CHAPTER 8  Keeping Your Checkbook      191
The End key works in a similar fashion. Bet you can guess how this works. Press 
the End key once to move to the end of the field you’re in, press it twice to move 
to the last field of the transaction you’re on (the Memo field), or press it three 
times to move to the last transaction in the register.
You can use the vertical scroll bar along the right edge of the register, too. Click 
the arrows at either end of the vertical scroll bar to select the next or preceding 
transaction. Click above or below the square scroll box to page back and forth 
through the register. Or, if you have no qualms about dragging the mouse around, 
you can drag the scroll box up and down the scroll bar.
QuickBooks lets you sort your register in different ways, which makes scrolling 
through and finding transactions much easier. To sort your register the way you 
prefer, select an option from the Sort By drop-down list in the lower-left corner 
of the register window.
Finding that darn transaction
Want to find that one check, deposit, or transfer? No problem. I discuss this tech-
nique elsewhere in the book, but it’s appropriate here, too. The Edit menu’s Find 
command provides a handy way for doing just such a thing. Here’s what you do:
1.	 Choose Edit ➪ Find and then click the Advanced tab.
QuickBooks, with restrained but obvious enthusiasm, displays the Advanced 
tab of the Find window (shown in Figure 8-10). You use this window to describe, 
in as much detail as possible, the transaction that you want to find.
Choose Edit ➪ Find and click the Simple tab, which enables you to search for 
transactions by using the transaction type, customer or job name, date, 
number, or amount. You can easily switch to an advanced search by clicking 
the Advanced tab.
2.	 Choose a filter that describes the information that you already have.
In the figure, the Account filter is chosen. When you click different filters, the 
Find window changes.
3.	 Describe the filter that identifies the transaction that you want to locate.
In the upper-left box, which is set to Account in Figure 8-10, select the filter that 
describes the subject of your search from the drop-down list. In case of an 
account-based filter, for example, you can select to look at all accounts, just 
income accounts, just expense accounts, and so on. Other filters provide 
different boxes for setting the filter.

192      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
By the way, the case of the text doesn’t matter. If you type rainy, for example, 
QuickBooks finds RAINY as well as Rainy.
4.	 Repeat Steps 2 and 3 as necessary.
Yes, you can filter through as many fields as you want. In fact, you can filter so 
much that nothing matches your specification.
5.	 Click Find to let the search begin.
Click the Find button to begin looking. If QuickBooks finds transactions that 
match the one you described, it lists them in the bottom half of the window. 
You can double-click a transaction to view it.

window.

Y
ou can use QuickBooks to track your business credit cards in much the same 
way that you use it to keep a checkbook. The process is almost the same, 
with a few wrinkles.
By the way, although this chapter is really about you charging money on your 
credit cards, at the very end of the chapter I talk about how to handle the tricky 
problem of your customers paying with credit cards.
Tracking Business Credit Cards
If you want to track credit card spending and balances with QuickBooks, you need 
to set up a credit card account — if you didn’t already do so in QuickBooks Setup, 
which you can read about in Chapter 2. (By comparison, you use bank accounts to 
track things such as the money that flows into and out of a checking, savings, or 
petty-cash account.)
Chapter 9

194      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Setting up a credit card account
To set up a credit card account, you follow roughly the same steps that you use to 
set up a bank account:
1.	 Choose Lists ➪ Chart of Accounts.
Or click the Chart of Accounts icon on the home screen. QuickBooks displays 
the Chart of Accounts window, as shown in Figure 9-1.
2.	 Click the Account button in the lower-left corner of the Chart of Accounts 
window and then choose New.
QuickBooks displays the first Add New Account window, which simply displays 
a list of option buttons corresponding to the different types of accounts 
QuickBooks allows.
3.	 Select the Credit Card option.
Selecting Credit Card tells QuickBooks that you want to set up a credit card 
account. I’m sure that you’re surprised. Click Continue. QuickBooks displays the 
second Add New Account window, as shown in Figure 9-2.
FIGURE 9-1: 
The Chart of 
Accounts window.

CHAPTER 9  Paying with Plastic      195
4.	 Type a name for the account in the Account Name text box.
Why not do it right? Move the cursor to the Account Name text box and then 
enter the name of your credit card.
5.	 Type the card number in the Credit Card Acct. No. text box.
If you’re creating a general Credit Card account for more than one card, leave 
the Credit Card Acct. No. text box empty. While you’re at it, you can describe 
the card, too. You may want to type Usury! in the Description text box, 
depending on your card’s interest rate.
6.	 Click the Save & Close button.
QuickBooks redisplays the Chart of Accounts window. (Refer to Figure 9-1.) 
Now the window lists an additional account: the credit card account that you 
just created.
Selecting a credit card account so that 
you can use it
To tell QuickBooks that you want to work with a credit card account, you use the 
Chart of Accounts window (refer to Figure 9-1). Choose Lists ➪ Chart of Accounts. 
After you display the window, double-click the credit card account that you want 
FIGURE 9-2: 
The second Add 
New Account 
window.

196      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
to use. QuickBooks displays the Credit Card register so that you can begin record-
ing transactions.
As an alternative to the Chart of Accounts window, you can click the Enter Credit 
Card Charges icon in the Banking area of the home screen. Or you can choose 
Banking ➪ Enter Credit Card Charges.
Entering Credit Card Transactions
If you choose the Banking ➪ Use Register command and select a credit card 
account, QuickBooks displays the Credit Card register. Figure  9-3 shows the 
­register for a credit card account I’ve named Frequent Flyer. It looks a lot like a 
Checking register, doesn’t it?
The Credit Card register works like the regular register window that you use for a 
checking account. You enter transactions in the rows of the register. When you 
record a charge, QuickBooks updates the credit card balance and the remaining 
credit limit.
FIGURE 9-3: 
The Credit Card 
Register window.

CHAPTER 9  Paying with Plastic      197
Recording a credit card charge
Recording a credit card charge is similar to recording a check or bank account 
withdrawal. For the sake of illustration, suppose that you charged $50 worth of 
burritos and margaritas to your favorite Mexican restaurant, La Cantina. Here’s 
how you record this charge:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Enter Credit Card Charges.
The Enter Credit Card Charges window appears, as shown in Figure 9-4.
2.	 From the Credit Card drop-down list, select the credit card that you 
charged the expense against.
Click the down arrow next to the Credit Card list and then select a card from 
the drop-down list.
3.	 In the Purchased From field, record the name of the business that you 
paid with a credit card.
Move the cursor to the Purchased From line and click the down arrow. You see 
a list of names. Choose one from the list.
If you’ve never dined at this fine establishment before, choose Add New. Then 
add the business name.
FIGURE 9-4: 
The Enter Credit 
Card Charges 
window.

198      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
4.	 Select the appropriate option button to indicate whether the transaction 
is a purchase or a credit.
Select the Purchase/Charge option button if you want to record a purchase 
(which is what you do most of the time and what this example shows you). 
Select the Refund/Credit option button if you want to record a credit on your 
account (if you returned something, for example).
5.	 Enter the charge date in the Date field.
Move the cursor to the Date line (if the cursor isn’t already there), and type the 
date, using MM/DD/YYYY format. Type either 07312017 or 7/31/17 for July 31, 
2017, for example. If you’re entering this charge two or three days after the 
fact, don’t enter today’s date; enter the date when the charge was made. Using 
that date makes reconciling your records with your credit card company’s 
records easier when you get your monthly statement.
6.	 Type the charge amount in the Amount field.
Move the cursor to the Amount line and enter the total charge amount. Note: 
Don’t type a dollar sign, but do type the period to indicate the decimal place.
7.	 (Optional) Enter a memo description in the Memo text box.
Move the cursor to the Memo text box and type the specific reason why you’re 
charging the item. In this case, you could type Attorney/CPA lunch or 
something like that.
Wait. You know what? Let me be more serious. No joking for a minute, okay? 
This Memo box is a good place to document the business purpose for a 
charge, which is a tax-law requirement if you’re recording a travel, meal, or 
entertainment business credit card charge.
8.	 Fill in the Expenses tab.
I’m hoping that you’ve read Chapter 6 so that you know all about the Expenses 
tab — and that you’re thoroughly bored by the topic. If you opened the book 
right to this page, however, you use the Expenses tab to record business 
expenses.
Move to the Account column of the Expenses tab, click the down arrow, and 
choose an Expense account from the list (most likely Travel & Ent:Meals for a 
business lunch). If you enter a name here that QuickBooks doesn’t already 
know, it asks you to set up an expense account.
QuickBooks automatically fills in the Amount column when you enter a sum  
in the Amount field. Type something in the Memo column and assign this 
expense to a Customer:Job and Class if you want to. You need to turn on class 
tracking if you want to assign the expense to a class. (Turn to Chapter 3 and 
find the section on the Class list for more information.)

CHAPTER 9  Paying with Plastic      199
9.	Fill in the Items tab.
Because this charge is for a meal at a restaurant, you don’t itemize the charge. 
If you were charging inventory items such as lumber, paper supplies, and so 
on, however, you’d fill in the Items tab.
If you have a purchase order (PO) on file with the vendor that you entered in 
the Purchased From line, QuickBooks tells you so. Click the Select PO button to 
see a list of your outstanding POs with the vendor. If you don’t know how to 
handle POs, see Chapter 7.
10.	Record the charge by clicking the Save & New button or the Save & 
Close button.
The charge is recorded in the Credit Card register. Figure 9-5 shows what the 
Credit Card register looks like after I enter a handful of charges.
Changing charges that you’ve  
already entered
Perhaps you record a credit card charge and then realize that you recorded it 
incorrectly. Or perhaps you shouldn’t have recorded it at all because you didn’t 
pay for the business lunch. (Someone else paid for it after one of those friendly 
FIGURE 9-5:

Register window

transactions.

200      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
arguments over who should pay the bill. You know the type of argument I mean: 
“No, I insist.” “On the contrary, I insist.” You get the picture.)
You have to go into the Credit Card register and either edit or delete the charge by 
following these steps:
1.	 Choose Lists ➪ Chart of Accounts.
You see the Chart of Accounts window.
2.	 Double-click the credit card account where the faulty charge is.
Like magic, the Credit Card register appears onscreen.
3.	 Select the credit card transaction that you want to delete or change.
That’s easy. Just move the cursor to the transaction.
4.	 Void, delete, or edit the transaction, as follows:
•	 To void the credit card transaction, choose Edit ➪ Void Credit Card Charge 
and then click OK.
•	 To delete the transaction, choose Edit ➪ Delete Credit Card Charge. 
QuickBooks displays a message box that asks whether you really want to 
delete the transaction. Click OK.
•	 To edit the transaction, click the Edit Transaction button at the top of the 
window. You return to the Enter Credit Card Charges window. Make your 
changes there and then click Save & New or Save & Close. You also can 
make changes inside the Credit Card register and then click Record when 
you’re done.
Reconciling Your Credit Card Statement 
and Paying the Bill
You reconcile, or balance, a credit card account the same way you balance a bank 
account. (For help with this task, see Chapter 14.) After you successfully get the 
account to balance and click Reconcile Now, QuickBooks displays the Make Pay-
ment dialog box, asking how you want to pay the bill. You can either pay by check 
or enter a bill to be paid later. (The second option is the accounts payable method, 
remember?)
If you opt to pay the bill by writing a check, you go straight to the Write Checks 
window, and the Expenses tab is all filled out for you. Fill in the name of the card 
issuer, the date, and so on. Click Save & New or Save & Close when you’re done. 

CHAPTER 9  Paying with Plastic      201
The payment is recorded in both the Checking register and the Credit Card register 
because you charge the credit card liability account with the check total.
If you opt to enter the payment as a bill to be paid at a later date, you go to the 
Enter Bills window. Fill everything out just as you would if you were in the Write 
Checks window. When you click Save & New, the transaction is recorded in the 
Accounts Payable register and the Credit Card register.
See Chapter 6 if you need to know more about either the Enter Bills window or the 
Write Checks window.
So What about Debit and ATM Cards?
Debit and ATM cards, when you get right down to it, aren’t really credit cards at 
all. Using a debit card or an ATM card is more akin to writing a check than anything 
else. Rather than withdrawing money by writing a check, however, you withdraw 
money by using a debit card (which is what I call this type of card from here on in).
Although a debit card transaction sometimes looks (at least to your friends and the 
merchants you shop with) like a credit card transaction, you should treat a debit 
card transaction like you treat a check. In a nutshell, here’s what you need to do:
»
» When you charge something to a debit card, record the transaction just like 
you record a regular check. You may want to enter the transaction number as 
the check number or in the Memo line so that you can keep track of the 
transaction.
»
» When you withdraw cash by using a debit card, record the transaction as a 
regular withdrawal (or transfer to a petty-cash account), as though you went 
to the bank with a withdrawal slip.
»
» When you make a deposit through a cash machine by using a debit card, 
record the transaction just like you record a regular deposit.
So What about Customer Credit Cards?
I want to talk about an awkward subject before you and I close our discussion 
about how to work with credit cards. Here, I talk about — gulp — how to handle 
customer credit card payments.

202      PART 2  Daily Entry Tasks
Okay, if you don’t already know this, although your customers probably love to 
pay you with credit cards, customer credit cards create a headache for you. The 
reason is that your merchant bank or credit card processor aggregates customer 
credit card charges and then — maybe on a daily basis or maybe every few days — 
deposits a big wad of cash in your bank account. The cash represents the sum of 
the recent credit card charges minus a fee (which I hope is modest).
This all sounds innocuous enough, but here’s an example of how it works. Custom-
ers A, B, and C come in on Monday and spend $5, $10, and $15, respectively. Then, 
on Tuesday, customers D, E, and F come in and spend $10, $50, and $30, respec-
tively. On Wednesday, you don’t sell anything to someone who uses a credit card, 
but you do see a $105 deposit in your bank account by the credit card company.
The problem is that you’re looking at the last two days’ worth of credit card trans-
actions, and you know that they total $120 because that’s the total you sold to 
customers A, B, C, D, E, and F. So what’s with the $105? Is the missing $15 a ser-
vice fee? Oh, no, wait. Maybe Customer A called his credit card company and 
blocked that first $5 charge. Or maybe it was Customer B?
If you accept a credit card, you know how this works, right? It’s a royal headache.
I think you probably have two reasonable approaches for dealing with this madness:
»
» The Good Accountant’s Way: You can record customer credit card payments 
in the usual way — the way that QuickBooks expects. The Good Accountant’s 
Way produces nice, accurate records, but at the cost of enormous bookkeep-
ing hassles. Interested in more information? Great! Use the QuickBooks Help 
command to search QuickBooks online help for the topic recording a credit 
card payment.
»
» The Bad Accountant’s Way: You can just record sales receipt transactions 
when the credit card company deposits net charges amounts in your bank 
account. In other words, using the example numbers given in an earlier 
paragraph, rather than recording individual transactions for customers A, B, C, 
D, E, and F when the sales occur, you can record a $105 transaction when the 
credit card company deposits $105 into your bank account. If you know the 
credit card company’s service charge, you can record that, too, using a journal 
entry. (You’ll probably want to ask your accountant for help on this.)
I should tell you something else. The Bad Accountant’s Way probably isn’t justi-
fied unless you’re in a high-volume situation — such as a retail store — and when 
you’re using a periodic inventory system or when you don’t sell inventory. If you 
have only a handful of credit card transactions — say, one every few days — or if 
you’re trying to use a perpetual inventory system, you should use the Good 
Accountant’s Way.

T
his chapter covers the reductiveness of the postcolonial implications in 
Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness. Just kidding. It covers how to print checks 
and checking registers.
Printing checks in QuickBooks is quick. Well, it’s quick after you set up your 
printer correctly. If you have a continuous-feed printer, you know by now that 
these printers have problems printing anything on a form. The alignment always 
gets messed up.
QuickBooks has check forms that you can buy, and I recommend using them if you 
print checks. After all, the QuickBooks checks were made to work with this 
­program. And all banks accept these checks.
If you want help with printing reports, check out Chapter 15, where I cover this 
topic in almost too much detail.
Getting the Printer Ready
Before you can start printing checks, you have to make sure that your printer is set 
up to print them. You also have to tell QuickBooks what to put on the checks: your 
company name, address, logo, and so on. And you might try running a few sample 
checks through the wringer to see whether they come out all right.
Chapter 10

206      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
Follow these steps to set up the printer:
1.	 Choose File ➪ Printer Setup.
After you choose this command, you see the Printer Setup dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 10-1.
2.	 Select Check/PayCheck from the Form Name drop-down list.
QuickBooks sets your printing options differently depending on which form 
you want to print. For printing checks, you want to select the Check/PayCheck 
form from the Form Name drop-down list at the top of the dialog box.
3.	 From the Printer Name drop-down list, select your printer.
From the Printer Name drop-down list, click the down arrow and look at the 
printer names. When you installed QuickBooks, it had a frank, software-to- 
software talk with Windows to find out what kind of printer(s) you have, among 
other things. Your printer is probably already selected; if it isn’t, select the 
correct printer.
4.	 Set the correct Printer Type option, if necessary.
This box is probably already filled in, too, thanks to that frank discussion 
that I mention in Step 3. But if it isn’t, click the down arrow and then choose 
Continuous or Page-Oriented. (The former is generally for dot-matrix printers, 
and the latter is for laser and inkjet printers, but it really just depends on what 
kind of paper you use for your printer.)
5.	 Select the appropriate Check Style.
Now you’re cooking. This step is where you get to make a real choice:
FIGURE 10-1: 
The Settings tab 
of the Printer 
Setup dialog box.

CHAPTER 10  Printing Checks      207
•	 Voucher checks are the same width as standard checks, but they’re much 
longer. When you select the Voucher option, QuickBooks prints voucher 
information as well: the items and expenses tabulations from the bottom 
of the Write Checks window. QuickBooks also provides information about 
the checking account that you’re writing this check on.
•	 Standard checks are sized to fit in legal envelopes.
•	 The Wallet option is for printing checks that are small enough to fit 
in — you guessed it — a wallet.
6.	 (Optional) Click the Options button; adjust your printer options; and 
when you’re finished, click OK to return to the Printer Setup dialog box.
After you click the Options button, QuickBooks displays your printer’s 
Properties dialog box.
7.	 In the Properties dialog box, specify print quality, number of copies, and 
other options specific to your printer. Then click OK to return to the 
Printer Setup dialog box.
8.	 Click the Fonts tab of the Printer Setup dialog box and then the Fonts 
button on that tab to customize the fonts on your checks.
When you click either the Font button or the Address Font button on this tab, 
you see the Select Font dialog box (as shown in Figure 10-2) or the Select 
Address Font dialog box. You use the Address Font button to designate how 
your company’s name and address look and the Font button to designate what 
all other print on your checks looks like. Here’s your chance to spruce up your 
checks and make your company’s name stand out.
Experiment for a while with the Font, Font Style, and Size settings. If you have a 
bookstore, for example, choose the Bookman font (maybe using bold for your 
company’s name and address); if you run a messenger service, choose Courier; 
Italian mathematicians can use Times New Roman (just kidding). You can see 
what your choices look like in the Sample box.
FIGURE 10-2: 
The Fonts tab of 
the Printer Setup 
dialog box.

208      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
9.	When you finish fooling around with the fonts, click OK to go back to the 
Printer Setup dialog box.
10.	Click the Partial Page tab of the Printer Setup dialog box, and then select 
a Partial Page Printing Style.
Fortunately, some graphics appear; otherwise, you wouldn’t have a clue what 
these options are, would you? These options are for the environmentally 
friendly among you. Suppose that you feed two checks to the printer, but the 
check sheets have three checks each. You have a leftover check.
Thanks to this option, you can use the extra check. Select one of the options to 
tell QuickBooks how you plan to feed the check to the printer — vertically on 
the left (the Side option), vertically in the middle (the Centered option), or 
horizontally (the Portrait option). You feed checks to the printer the same way 
that you feed envelopes to it.
11.	(Optional) Click the Logo button and then enter a company logo or some 
clip art.
In the Logo dialog box, click File and then find the directory and BMP (bitmap) 
graphic file that you want to load. Click OK. Note: Only graphics that are in BMP 
format can be used on your checks, and Intuit recommends that the logo be 
square.
12.	(Optional) Click the Signature button and then enter a check signature 
image.
Want to get really adventurous? Click the Signature button that appears in the 
Printer Setup dialog box. When QuickBooks displays the Signature dialog box, 
click File and then find the directory and BMP (bitmap) graphic file with the 
signature that you want to load. Click OK. Note: As with a logo, you can use a 
signature here only if it’s a BMP graphic.
13.	Click OK when you’re finished.
That setup was no Sunday picnic, was it? But your checks are all ready to be 
printed, and you’ll probably never have to go through this ordeal again.
Printing a Check
For some reason, when I get to this part of the discussion, my pulse quickens. 
Actually writing a check for real money seems terribly serious. I get the same feel-
ing whenever I mail someone cash, even if the amount is nominal.

CHAPTER 10  Printing Checks      209
I think that the best way to lower my heart rate (and yours, if you’re like me) is to 
just print the darn check and be done with it. QuickBooks can print checks in two 
ways: as you write them or in bunches.
First things first, however. Before you can print checks, you have to load some 
blank checks into your printer. This process works the same way as loading any 
paper into your printer. If you have questions, refer to your printer’s documenta-
tion. (Sorry I can’t help more on this process, but a million different printers exist, 
and I can’t tell which one you have, even when I look into my crystal ball.)
A few words about printing checks
Check printing is kind of complicated, isn’t it? For the record, I’m with you on this 
one. I really wish it weren’t so much work, but you’ll find that printing checks 
gets easier after the first few times.
Pretty soon, you’ll be running rather than walking through the steps. Pretty soon, 
you’ll just skate around such roadblocks as check-form alignment. Pretty soon, in 
fact, you’ll know all this stuff and never have to read pretty soon again.
Printing a check as you write it
If you’re in the Write Checks window and you’ve just finished filling out a check, 
you can print it. The only drawback is that you have to print checks one at a time 
with this method. Here’s how:
1.	 Fill out your check.
Yes, I strongly recommend filling out the check before printing it. And make 
sure that the Print Later check box is selected. Turn to Chapter 6 for help with 
writing checks with QuickBooks.
2.	 Click the Print button in the Write Checks window.
You see the Print Check dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-3.
3.	 Enter a check number in the Printed Check Number text box and then 
click OK.
FIGURE 10-3: 
The Print Check 
dialog box.

210      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
After you click OK, you see the similarly named Print Checks dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 10-4. The settings that you see in this dialog box are the ones 
that you chose when you first told QuickBooks how to print checks. If you 
change the settings in the Print Checks dialog box, the changes affect only this 
particular check. The next time you print a check, you’ll see your original 
settings again.
4.	 Click Print to accept the default settings, or make changes in the dialog 
box and then click Print.
In the Printer Name field, specify which printer you want to print to. In the 
Check Style area, indicate whether you want to print a Voucher, Standard, or 
Wallet check.
If you’re printing a partial page of forms on a laser printer, use the Partial Page 
tab to indicate both the number of check forms on the partial page and how 
you’ll feed them through your printer.
If you want your company’s name and address to appear on the check, select 
the Print Company Name and Address check box on the Settings tab.
After you click Print, QuickBooks prints the check, and you see the Print 
Checks — Confirmation dialog box (shown in Figure 10-5). There’s nothing 
tricky here — only a list of the checks that you just tried to print.
5.	 If the check didn’t print correctly, follow these steps:
(a)	 Click the check listed in the Print Checks — Confirmation dialog box to select it 
and then click OK to return to the Write Checks window.
(b)	 Click the Write Checks window’s Print button again.
(c)	 Enter the new check number and click Print again.
FIGURE 10-4: 
The Print Checks 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 10  Printing Checks      211
QuickBooks doesn’t automatically keep track of incorrectly printed check 
forms, so you have to. If you botch a check form, be sure to write VOID in large 
letters and permanent ink across the face of the check. Then file the check 
away for your reference. Don’t throw away the check!
If you still have questions about how to check any mistakes, see the section 
“What if I make a mistake?” later in this chapter.
6.	 If your check looks good, click OK.
You return to the Write Checks window. Don’t forget to sign the check.
Printing checks by the bushel
What if you write a mess of checks and then decide to print them? That’s how the 
process is done usually. Here’s how to print a bushel of checks:
1.	 Go into the register and make sure that the checks that you want to print 
are marked To Print.
The quickest way to get into the register is to choose Banking ➪ Use Register. If 
you have more than one bank account, select the Checking Account register 
that you want to open and then click OK. Do the checks that you want to print 
have To Print in the Number line? If not, tab to the Number line, press T, and 
then click the Record button. QuickBooks automatically fills the Number field 
with To Print and then moves on. (If the check you want to print already has a 
number, you need to replace the number with T.)
2.	 Choose File ➪ Print Forms ➪ Checks.
You see the Select Checks to Print dialog box, in which you select the checks to 
print (see Figure 10-6).
FIGURE 10-5: 
The Print 
Checks —  
­Confirmation 
dialog box.

212      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
3.	 Click the check marks next to the checks that you don’t want to print and 
then click OK.
All the checks are selected at first. If you want to print them all, fine. If not,  
click the check marks next to the checks that you don’t want to print so that 
QuickBooks removes the check marks. Or if you want to print only a few of the 
checks, click the Select None button and then click next to the checks that you 
want to print so that QuickBooks places a check mark in the column.
When only the checks that you want to print have check marks, click OK to 
continue with this crazy little thing called check printing. QuickBooks, happy 
with your progress, displays the Print Checks dialog box (refer to Figure 10-4). 
Here, you see the settings that you chose when you first told QuickBooks how 
to print checks.
4.	 Click Print to accept the default settings, or make changes in the dialog 
box and then click Print.
You can change the settings in this dialog box if you want them to be different. 
Any changes that you make for a particular batch of checks don’t affect the 
default settings. The next time you print a check, your original settings appear 
again.
In the Check Style box, indicate whether you want to print Voucher, Standard, 
or Wallet checks. If you’re printing a partial page of checks, enter the number 
of checks on the first page in the Number of Checks on First Page text box.
If you want your company’s name and address to appear on the checks, select 
the Print Company Name and Address check box on the Settings tab.
Change the default value (1) in the Number of Copies text box to print more 
than a single copy of the check.
QuickBooks prints the checks and then you see the Print Checks — 
Confirmation dialog box (refer to Figure 10-5).
5.	 Review the checks that QuickBooks printed and then do one of the 
following:
•	 If QuickBooks printed the checks correctly, answer the Did Check(s) Print OK? 
question by clicking OK. (QuickBooks, apparently thinking that you now 
FIGURE 10-6: 
The Select 
Checks to Print 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 10  Printing Checks      213
want to do nothing but print checks, redisplays the nearly exhausted Write 
Checks window.)
•	 If QuickBooks didn’t print a check correctly, type the number of the first 
incorrectly printed check in the text box and then click OK. In this case, 
repeat the steps for check printing. Note, though, that you need to reprint 
only the first bad check and the checks that follow it. You don’t need to 
reprint good checks that precede the first bad check.
Don’t forget to write VOID in large letters and permanent ink across the front 
of incorrectly printed check forms. Then file the checks for safekeeping. (Do not 
throw them away.) To record the voided check in QuickBooks, see the next 
section, “What if I make a mistake?”
If the numbers of the checks that you need to reprint aren’t sequential and are, 
in fact, spread all over creation, make it easy on yourself. Click OK to clear the 
list of checks to be printed, go into the register, click the Number line of the 
checks that you need to print, and then press T. QuickBooks automatically fills 
these with To Print. Then choose File ➪ Print Forms ➪ Checks, as in Step 2, and 
continue from there.
If your checks came out all right, take the rest of the day off. Give yourself a 
raise while you’re at it.
6.	 Sign the printed checks.
Then — and I guess you probably don’t need my help here — put the checks in 
the mail.
What if I make a mistake?
If you discover a mistake after you print a check, the problem may not be as big as 
you think.
If you’ve already mailed the check, however, you can’t do much. You can try to get 
the check back (if the person you paid hasn’t cashed it already) and replace it with 
a check that’s correct. (Good luck on this one.)
If the person cashed the check, you can’t get the check back. If you overpaid the 
person by writing the check for more than you should have, you need to ask the 
person to pay you the overpayment amount. If you underpaid the person, you need 
to write another check for the amount of the underpayment.
If you printed the check but haven’t mailed it, void the printed check. This opera-
tion has two parts. First, write VOID in large letters across the face of the check 
form. (Use a ballpoint pen if you’re using multipart forms so that the second and 
third parts also show as VOID.) Second, display the register, highlight the check, 
and then choose Edit ➪ Void Check. (This option marks the check as one that’s 

214      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
been voided in the system so that QuickBooks doesn’t use the check in calculating 
the account balance.) If you’re voiding an incorrectly printed check, you first need 
to create a transaction for the check number that printed incorrectly and then void 
that transaction.
If you want to reissue a voided check, just enter the check all over again — and 
this time, try to be more careful.
If you notice only after clicking OK in the Print Checks — Confirmation dialog box 
that a check printed incorrectly, you can tell QuickBooks you want to reprint the 
check in one of two ways. If you have the register window displayed, you can 
change the check’s number from 007, for example, to To Print. If you have the 
Write Checks window displayed, you can select the To Be Printed check box.
Oh where, oh where do unprinted  
checks go?
Unprinted checks — those that you entered by using the Write Checks window but 
haven’t yet printed — are stored in the register. To identify them as unprinted 
checks, QuickBooks puts To Print in the Number line. What’s more, when you tell 
QuickBooks to print the unprinted checks, what it really does is print the checks in 
the register that have To Print in the Number line. All this knowledge is of little 
practical value in most instances, but it results in several interesting possibilities.
You can enter the checks that you want to print directly into the register, for 
example. All you need to do is type To Print in the Number line.
Printing a Checking Register
You can print a Checking register, or a register for any other account, too. Follow 
these steps to print a register:
1.	 Open the account register you want to print.
Choose Banking ➪ Use Register or click the Check Register icon on the home 
screen. If you have more than one bank account, choose the account register 
you want to print from the drop-down list and then click OK.
2.	 Choose File ➪ Print Register or click the Print button at the top of the 
register.
You see the Print Register dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-7. This option is 
available whenever you have a register open for an account.

CHAPTER 10  Printing Checks      215
3.	 Fill in the Date Range fields.
To print a register of something other than the current year-to-date transac-
tions, use the From and Through fields. This step is pretty darn obvious, isn’t it? 
You just move the cursor to the From and Through text boxes and type the 
range of dates that the register should include.
4.	 (Optional) Select the Print Splits Detail check box.
As you know, a register doesn’t show all the messy details, such as the Items 
and Expenses tab information, but you can select this check box to include all 
this stuff on your printed register.
5.	 Click OK.
You see the Print Lists dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-8.
6.	 Do one of the following:
•	 If everything is cool, click the Print button and skip the remaining steps.
•	 If you want to change options in the Print Lists dialog box, proceed to Step 7.
You don’t have to fool around with the Print Lists dialog box. If you want to 
print a register pronto, just click Print; QuickBooks sends the register on its 
FIGURE 10-7: 
The Print Register 
dialog box.
FIGURE 10-8: 
The Print Lists 
dialog box.

216      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
merry way to your printer. Then again, if you’re the sort of person who likes to 
fool around with this kind of stuff, carry on with the rest of these steps.
If you want to see the effect that the different settings in this dialog box have, 
just experiment. You can’t hurt anything or anybody.
7.	(Optional) Print the report to disk.
To print the report to disk as a text file, select the File option button and then 
choose one of the following Print To options:
•	 Choose ASCII Text File if you want to create a text file (such as when you 
want to import the register into a word processing program).
•	 Choose Comma Delimited File if you’ll later import the register into a 
spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel.
•	 Choose Tab Delimited File to, for example, import the register into a 
database program like Microsoft Access. (Oooh . . . fancy.)
8.	Choose the paper orientation.
In which direction do you want the report to be printed: Portrait (regular) or 
Landscape (sideways)? Just select the appropriate option button.
9.	(Optional) Tell QuickBooks which pages to print.
Use the Page Range option buttons and text boxes to limit the pages for 
QuickBooks to print.
10.	(Optional) Color your world: Print your report in color.
If you have a color printer and want to print the register in color, select the 
Print in Color (Color Printers Only) check box.
11.	(Optional) Preview the report.
To see how your settings will affect the report before you actually print it, click 
Preview. QuickBooks shows you the results onscreen. This feature has 
probably saved more trees than you can imagine.
12.	Click Print.
After you have the report exactly the way you want it (and not one moment 
before!), click Print. QuickBooks finally prints the register.

Payroll
P
ayroll is one of the major headaches of running a small business. When I 
think of all the time that I’ve seen clients waste figuring out withholding 
amounts, writing checks, and trying to fill out comically confusing payroll 
tax returns, it just makes me want to scream. Fortunately, QuickBooks helps. And 
in a big way. In this chapter, I explain how.
Getting Ready to Do Payroll without  
Help from QuickBooks
Before I launch into a discussion of doing payroll using QuickBooks, I want to 
share an accounting thought that’s almost heretical: You may not want to do 
­payroll yourself using QuickBooks. No, wait, hear me out.
Chapter 11

218      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
The easiest way to do payroll, quite frankly, is to sign up with an outside service 
bureau, such as ADP or Paychex. If you have an accountant, you might also want 
to ask about other less-expensive, local payroll services.
The easiest route is often the most expensive, of course, and payroll services are 
no exception. In my experience, these full-meal-deal services tend to run about 
twice the price of the most expensive QuickBooks Payroll service after you add 
everything, but all you need to do is make a phone call. (Search online for a local 
number.) The payroll service will send someone nice out to your office. A few days 
later, all you need to do is use a friendly website or make a phone call when you 
want to pay employees.
Doing Taxes the Right Way
One thing I need to mention: Even before you set up QuickBooks for payroll, at a 
minimum, you need a few other items if you want to do payroll the right way. (If 
you want to do payroll the wrong way, you’re reading the wrong book.) These 
items are
»
» A federal Employer Identification Number (EIN)
»
» An Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) account with the 
U.S. Treasury
»
» A state employer ID number (if you withhold state income taxes)
»
» An unemployment tax ID number
»
» I-9 and W-4 tax forms
Getting an employer ID number
To get an employer ID number, you need to file an SS-4, Application for Employer 
Identification Number form, with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). You can get 
this form at the IRS website (www.irs.gov) or by calling the IRS and asking 
for one.
You can also apply for and receive an EIN over the telephone. You still need to fill 
out the SS-4 form before you call, however, so that you can answer the questions 
that the IRS asks during the short telephone application process. You also need to 
mail or fax the form to the IRS after you have your little telephone conversation.

CHAPTER 11  Payroll      219
Even easier, you can just do it all online. Here’s the current URL:
https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual
Signing up for EFTPS
To remit tax deposits to the U.S. Treasury, you need to sign up for the U.S. Trea-
sury electronic funds transfer payment service, popularly known as EFTPS. You 
can visit www.eftps.gov to get more information about the EFTPS service and to 
sign up for it. Note: Signing up for this service (and getting the needed login infor-
mation) may take a few weeks, so if at all possible, you should sign up for EFTPS 
well before you hire an employee.
Employees and employers do their part
You need to have your employees fill out W-4 forms to tell you what filing status 
they’ll use and how many personal exemptions they’ll claim. You get blank W-4 
forms from the Forms & Publications area of the www.irs.gov website.
You, as an employer, also need to have completed an I-9 form to prove that you’ve 
documented both an employee’s identity and his or her eligibility to work in the 
United States. You can get blank I-9 forms and instructions from the U.S. Customs 
and Immigration Services website:
https://www.uscis.gov/i-9
Getting Ready to Do Payroll with 
QuickBooks
If you want to use one of the QuickBooks Payroll service options because you want 
to save money, you aren’t scared of a little paperwork, or maybe you want the 
extra flexibility that comes with doing it yourself, you need to sign up for the 
appropriate flavor of service.
Costs of the QuickBooks Payroll services vary based on the number of employees 
you have and on how much work you want the nice folks at QuickBooks to do. 
Figure on spending at least $200 per year for the most basic package. And note 
that if you want the full-meal deal, you’re looking at a current cost of at least 
$1,000 per year. (In addition, if history is any guide, you’ll need to upgrade your 

220      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
QuickBooks software more regularly.) To set up for a payroll service option, get 
ready to hop on the Internet. Then follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Employees ➪ Payroll ➪ Order Payroll Service.
QuickBooks connects to the Internet and displays the first page of a multiple-
page web form that enables you to sign up for and set up the QuickBooks 
Payroll service you want: the roughly $200-per-year Basic Payroll service 
(QuickBooks helps you with the checks, but you or your accountant do all the 
work of filing payroll tax returns) or the $500-per-year-ish Enhanced Payroll 
service (QuickBooks helps you prepare both the payroll forms and checks).
2.	 Follow the onscreen instructions.
I don’t repeat the onscreen instructions for setting up the payroll service. 
Providing that kind of information would be . . . well, extremely redundant. Just 
follow the instructions carefully, and you’ll have no trouble.
Setting up the QuickBooks Payroll service requires that you have accurate 
year-to-date payroll information for all your employees, as well as state 
withholding rate information. You want to collect all this information before 
you begin. The process of setting up payroll — assuming that you have the 
information at hand and that you have only a handful of employees — 
shouldn’t take much more than half an hour.
3.	 Schedule your payroll.
After you sign up for (and indirectly set up) the QuickBooks Payroll service,  
you need to schedule your upcoming payroll activities. To do this, choose 
Employees ➪ Add or Edit Payroll Schedules. When QuickBooks displays the 
Payroll Schedule List window, click the Payroll Schedule button and then click 
New. When prompted by QuickBooks, describe the payroll you’re scheduling.  
If you’re setting up a weekly payroll, name the payroll something like Friday 
Payroll. Furthermore, describe the frequency as weekly, biweekly, semi-
monthly, and so on.
4.	 Describe your employees.
You need to describe each of your employees and identify which payroll 
schedule each belongs to. To do this, choose Employees ➪ Employee Center. 
Click the New Employee button. Then use the tabs of the window that 
QuickBooks displays to provide the employee’s name, address, Social Security 
number, and so on. Note that you use the Payroll and Compensation tab to 
specify the employee’s wage or salary and to assign the employee to a 
scheduled payroll.

CHAPTER 11  Payroll      221
Paying Your Employees
After you subscribe to the QuickBooks Payroll service and set up your payroll 
schedule, you’re ready to pay someone. This section is going to blow your mind, 
especially if you’ve been doing payroll manually. The process makes your whole 
decision to use QuickBooks to do your payroll worthwhile. Here’s how:
1.	 Start the payroll process by choosing Employees ➪ Pay Employees ➪  
Scheduled Payroll.
QuickBooks displays the Employee Center: Payroll Center window (see 
Figure 11-1). The Payroll Center window identifies any payroll schedules you 
set up, as well as recent payroll runs. Select the scheduled payroll you want; 
then click the Start Scheduled Payroll button. QuickBooks displays the Enter 
Payroll Income window, which lists the employees who participate in the 
scheduled payroll. Initially, all the listed employees have a check mark beside 
their names, but you can click to remove a check mark and to remove an 
employee from the scheduled payroll.
FIGURE 11-1: 
The Employee 
Center: Payroll 
Center window.

222      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
2.	 Create the paychecks.
When the Enter Payroll Income window correctly lists which employees should 
be paid, click Continue. QuickBooks calculates employee gross wages, deduc-
tions, and net wages, and the calculations appear in the Review and Create 
Paychecks window (see Figure 11-2).
3.	 (Optional) Review a payroll check.
You can preview any employee’s payroll data by clicking that employee’s name 
in the Review and Create Paychecks window. When you click an employee’s 
name, QuickBooks displays the Preview Paycheck window (see Figure 11-3) for 
the employee.
The main thing to pay attention to in the Preview Paycheck window is the 
Earnings text box. It shows what QuickBooks assumes you’ll pay an employee. 
In the Earnings text box, you fill in the number of hours the person worked and 
apply these hours to a customer or job, if necessary.
FIGURE 11-2: 
The Review and 
Create Paychecks 
window.

CHAPTER 11  Payroll      223
The Preview Paycheck window also includes an Other Payroll Items input area. 
In the Other Payroll Items text box, you enter commissions; additions, such as 
tips, bonuses, and expense reimbursements; deductions, such as union dues 
and 401(k) contributions; and company contributions, such as insurance 
benefits and 401(k) matching amounts. You also can change the payroll item or 
rate or add another payroll item, if you need to.
Watch out for this: QuickBooks calculates the company taxes, the employee 
taxes, and the amount of the net check, and this information appears in the 
Employee Summary area and the Company Summary area of the Preview 
Paycheck window. If some information is inaccurate, click the amount and 
change it, either by deleting it or replacing it with the correct information.
QuickBooks keeps totals for both the current check and the year to date.
4.	 Print the payroll checks.
When you’re ready to print the payroll checks, click the Create Paychecks 
button. QuickBooks lets you print payroll checks from QuickBooks or print 
paycheck stubs (which means that you’d later handwrite payroll checks). If you 
direct QuickBooks to print the checks, you print the payroll checks in the same 
way that you print nonpayroll checks. (Got a question about printing checks? 
See Chapter 10.) If you want to print paycheck stubs and later handwrite 
payroll checks, give QuickBooks the first check number so that it knows how to 
number the checks that it records in your register.
FIGURE 11-3: 
The Preview 
Paycheck 
window.

224      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
Paying Payroll Liabilities
Make no mistake: Big Brother wants the money that you withhold from an 
employee’s payroll check for federal income taxes, Social Security, and Medicare. 
Big Brother also wants the payroll taxes you owe: the matching Social Security and 
Medicare taxes, federal unemployment taxes, and so on. Every so often, you need 
to pay Big Brother the amounts that you owe.
If you withhold money from employees’ checks for other reasons (perhaps for 
health insurance or retirement savings), these amounts are payroll liabilities that 
need to be paid to the appropriate parties.
Paying tax liabilities if you use a  
full-meal-deal payroll service
A quick clarification: If you’re using a full-meal-deal payroll service — something 
like the ADP or Paychex service — your federal tax liabilities and most (perhaps 
all) of your state tax liabilities are paid as part of the service. In other words, the 
payroll service withdraws money from your bank account and uses this money to 
pay the appropriate federal or state government agency.
Be sure to check which state payroll taxes QuickBooks calculates and pays. In 
Washington state, where my business is located, QuickBooks won’t calculate a 
couple of state payroll taxes, so I have to calculate these myself (on the state pay-
roll tax form) and pay them with a check.
Paying tax liabilities if you don’t use a  
full-meal-deal payroll service
If you don’t use a full-meal-deal payroll service, you need to pay the payroll lia-
bilities yourself. To do this, choose Employees ➪ Payroll Taxes and Liabilities ➪ Pay 
Scheduled Liabilities. When QuickBooks displays the Employee Center: Payroll 
Center window (and its list of scheduled payrolls and the associated liabilities), 
choose the payroll liability you want to pay and then click the View/Pay button.
QuickBooks writes the check and puts it in your register. QuickBooks also gives the 
check the appropriate date and schedules it to pop up in your reminders window 
at the right time. Also, if you’re enrolled in the EFTPS online — and you should 
be — the check is created the same way, and the check number can be changed to 
EFTPS and not actually printed. (I talk about EFTPS earlier in this chapter.)

CHAPTER 11  Payroll      225
When do you make payroll tax deposits? That question comes up frequently. The 
general rule about U.S. federal tax deposits is this: If your accumulated payroll 
taxes are less than $2,500 for the quarter, you can pay those taxes with your quar-
terly 941 return. This law is called the De Minimis rule. (My understanding is that 
the law was named after Congresswoman Dee Minimis.) If you owe more than 
$2,500, other special rules come into play that determine whether you pay depos-
its monthly, semimonthly, weekly, or even immediately. The IRS tells you, by the 
way, how often you’re supposed to make payments.
If you owe a large amount of money, you’re required to deposit it almost immedi-
ately. If you owe $100,000 or more, for example, you need to make the payroll tax 
deposit by the next banking day. Some nuances apply to these rules, so unless you 
don’t owe very much (and, therefore, can fall back on the De Minimis rule), you 
might want to consult a tax adviser or call the IRS.
The general rule when processing payroll is to make the last payments that you 
process the ones that pay your federal and state tax deposits when they come due. 
You’ll never get into late-payment trouble if you follow this approach. It will also 
make your life a lot easier when it comes time to fill out Schedule B of Form 941, 
if you have to do so.
To make a payroll tax deposit, you need to sign up for the U.S. Treasury electronic 
funds transfer payment system. Go to www.eftps.gov.
Paying other nontax liabilities
If you’re paying nontax liabilities for things such as employee health insurance or 
retirement savings — it doesn’t matter whether you’re using the el cheapo payroll 
service or a full-meal-deal payroll service — you also choose Employees ➪ Payroll 
Taxes and Liabilities ➪ Create Custom Liability Payments. When you choose that 
command, you’ll need to indicate which liabilities you want to pay.
You need to pay all your payroll liabilities via Employees ➪ Payroll Taxes and  
Liabilities ➪ Create Custom Liability Payments if you want QuickBooks to keep 
your payroll liabilities straight. I mention this because people commonly pay these 
liabilities by using the Write Checks window. That method creates a mess.
Preparing Quarterly Payroll Tax Returns
At the end of every calendar quarter, you need to file a quarterly payroll tax return. 
If you’re a business owner, for example, you must file a Form 941, which states 
how much you paid in gross wages, how much you withheld in federal taxes, and 
how much you owe for employer payroll taxes for the quarter.

226      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
You’ll find that QuickBooks makes filling out these forms darn simple, but the 
procedures depend on which payroll service you’re using.
For more detailed information about the precise features of each of the Intuit Pay-
roll service options, visit http://payroll.intuit.com.
If you have a household employee, such as a nanny, you must file a Form 942. 
Again, you fill out Form 942 to list how much you paid in gross wages, withheld 
in federal taxes, and owe in payroll taxes. Fortunately, Intuit offers an Online 
Household Payroll service: http://payroll.intuit.com/payroll-services/
household-payroll.
Using the Basic Payroll service
If your accountant fills out Form 941 or 942 for you, meaning that you’re using 
the Basic Payroll service, you don’t need to read this section of this chapter. Your 
accountant won’t have any problem completing the quarterly payroll tax return by 
using the QuickBooks Payroll report, and in fact — I kid you not — your accoun-
tant will probably even enjoy doing it.
You use the Basic service when your accountant takes care of the payroll tax 
returns, so your accountant needs to know that you’ve tasked him with this 
responsibility.
Using a full-meal-deal payroll service
If you’re using a full-meal-deal payroll service — ADP, Paychex, or some similar 
service — the payroll company fills out and sends the quarterly payroll tax forms 
for you.
In this case, again, you don’t have to worry about the quarterly forms much, 
because hey — that’s what you’re paying the payroll company for.
Using the QuickBooks Enhanced  
Payroll service
If you’re using the Enhanced Payroll service, you do need to fill out and send the 
payroll tax forms, but don’t worry. QuickBooks will create and print a copy of 
Form 941 for you, so you don’t have to get out your calculator or mess around with 
lining up the red form in your typewriter.

CHAPTER 11  Payroll      227
Just choose Employees ➪ Payroll Forms & W-2s ➪ Process Payroll Forms. Quick-
Books runs you through a wizard that asks you for your state and the number of 
employees that you had over the quarter. Then QuickBooks summarizes each line 
of the form. When QuickBooks is done, all you have to do is print the form.
If you want to understand the numbers that QuickBooks uses to prepare your pay-
roll tax returns, you can look at a couple of reports. To get the gross-wages totals 
and the balances in each of the payroll tax liability accounts at the end of the quar-
ter, for example, print the Payroll Summary report. Choose Reports ➪ ­Employees & 
Payroll ➪ Payroll Summary. QuickBooks displays the Payroll Summary report. 
Specify the range of dates as the quarter for which you’re preparing a quarterly 
report. Scroll across to the Total column, which shows the gross wages upon 
which your employer payroll taxes are calculated.
The withholding account amounts are the amounts that you recorded to date for the 
employee’s federal income taxes withheld and the employee’s Social Security and 
Medicare taxes, so QuickBooks needs to double these figures to get the actual Social 
Security and Medicare taxes owed. Choose Reports ➪ Employees & Payroll ➪ Payroll 
Liability Balances. QuickBooks creates a report that tallies these amounts.
Filing Annual Returns and Wage 
Statements
At the end of the year, you need to file some annual returns — such as the 940 
Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax Return  — and the W-2 and W-3 wages 
statements.
You need to prepare any state unemployment annual summary before you prepare 
the 940 because the 940 requires information from the state returns.
How you deal with the annual payroll tax returns (including 940, W-2, and W-3 
forms) mirrors how you deal with the quarterly 941 payroll tax returns.
»
» If you’re using the Basic Payroll service: Remember to have your accoun-
tant prepare these forms.
»
» If you’re using the Enhanced Payroll service (as is the case with the 
quarterly 941 forms): You need to fill out and send the 940, W-2, and W-3 
forms in-house, but you get lots of help from QuickBooks.
»
» If you’re using a full-meal-deal payroll service: The service automatically 
fills out and sends these forms for you.

228      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
QuickBooks creates and prints the 940 and W-2s/W-3s for you. All you have to 
do is choose Employees ➪ Payroll Tax Forms and W-2s ➪ Process Payroll Forms. 
QuickBooks asks you for a little information and then it calculates for you. Just 
check the QuickBooks records against your own, and if everything matches, 
print that puppy. To look over the QuickBooks data included in the form and 
verify its integrity, it helps to print an Employee Earnings Summary report.
If you have a little trouble, call the IRS. If you have a great deal of trouble, splurge 
and have someone else fill out the forms for you. Filling out these forms doesn’t 
take a rocket scientist, by the way. Any experienced bookkeeper can do it for you.
Note: Please don’t construe my “rocket scientist” comment as personal criticism if 
this payroll taxes business seems terribly complicated. My experience is that some 
people — and you may very well be one of them — just don’t have an interest in 
things such as payroll accounting. If, on the other hand, you’re a “numbers are my 
friend” kind of person, you’ll have no trouble at all after you learn the ropes.
The State Wants Some Money, Too
I haven’t talked about state payroll taxes — at least not in great detail. I wish that 
I could provide this sort of detailed, state-specific help to you. Unfortunately, 
doing so would make this chapter about 150 pages long. It’d also cause me to go 
stark-raving mad.
My sanity and laziness aside, you still need to deal with state payroll taxes. Let me 
say, however, that you apply the same basic mechanics to state payroll taxes that 
you apply to federal payroll taxes. State income tax works the same way as federal 
income tax; employer-paid state unemployment taxes work like employer-paid 
federal taxes; and employee-paid state taxes work like employee-paid Social 
Security and Medicare taxes.
If you’re tuned in to how federal payroll taxes work in QuickBooks, you really 
shouldn’t have a problem with state payroll taxes  — at least not in terms of 
mechanics. Also note that QuickBooks can now print most state forms for most 
states. Check the https://quickbooks.intuit.com website for more information 
about this service.
The one thing you need to figure out is what your state wants. To do that, you need 
to get the state’s payroll tax reporting instructions. You may need to call the state. 
Or with a little luck, you may find online instructions at your state government’s 
website. If that isn’t much help, you can probably look up the state tax people’s 
telephone number by searching online, using a search phrase that includes your 
state’s name and the phrase payroll tax returns.

Building the Perfect 
Budget
I
don’t think that a budget amounts to financial handcuffs, and neither should 
you. After all, a budget is just a plan that outlines how you intend to generate 
sales, how you should spend your money, and your ideas about how you can 
best organize your firm’s financial affairs.
Is This a Game You Want to Play?
If you created a good, workable Chart of Accounts, as briefly discussed in Chap-
ter 2, you’re halfway to a good, solid budget. (In fact, for 99 out of 100 businesses, 
the only step left is to specify how much you earn in each income account and how 
much you spend in each expense account.)
Does every business need a budget? No, of course not. Maybe you have a simple 
financial plan that you can monitor some other way. Maybe in your business, you 
make money so effortlessly that you don’t need to plan your income and outgo. 
Maybe Elvis Presley really is still alive and living somewhere in the Midwest.
Chapter 12

230      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
For everyone else, though, a budget improves your chances of getting your busi-
ness wherever you want it to go financially. It gives you a way to “plan your work 
and work your plan.” In fact, I’ll stop calling it a budget because that word has 
such negative connotations. I know — I’ll call it The Secret Plan.
All Joking Aside: Some Basic Budgeting Tips
Before I walk you through the mechanics of outlining your Secret Plan, I want to 
give you a few tips. After that, I want to tell you a secret. A very special secret.
Here are four ways to increase the chances that your Secret Plan will work:
»
» Plan your income and expenses as a team, if that’s possible. For this sort 
of planning, two heads are invariably better than one. What’s more, although I 
don’t really want to get into marriage counseling or partnership counseling 
here, the budget of a business (oops; I mean its Secret Plan) needs to reflect 
the priorities and feelings of everyone who has to live within the plan: 
partners, partners’ spouses, key employees, and so on. So don’t use a Secret 
Plan as a way to minimize what your partner spends on marketing or on 
long-distance telephone charges talking to pseudo-customers and relatives in 
the old country. You need to resolve such issues before you finalize your 
Secret Plan.
»
» Include some cushion in your plan. In other words, don’t budget to spend 
every last dollar. If you plan from the start to spend every dollar you make, 
you’ll undoubtedly have to fight the mother of all financial battles: paying for 
unexpected expenses when you don’t have any money. (You know the sort of 
things I mean: the repair bill when the delivery truck breaks down, a new 
piece of essential equipment, or that cocktail dress or tuxedo you absolutely 
must have for a special party.)
»
» Regularly compare your actual income and outgo with your planned 
income and outgo. This comparison is probably the most important part of 
budgeting, and it’s what QuickBooks can help you with most. As long as you 
use QuickBooks to record what you receive and spend and to describe your 
budget, you can print reports that show what you planned and what actually 
occurred.
If you find that you’ve budgeted $1,000 per month for shipping costs, but you 
discover that you consistently spend twice that amount, you may need to shift 
some money from your monthly cocktail dress-and-tuxedo allowance . . .  
unless you like coming in over budget on shipping charges.

CHAPTER 12  Building the Perfect Budget      231
»
» Make adjustments as necessary. When you encounter problems with your 
Secret Plan — and you will — you’ll know that part of your plan isn’t working. 
Then you can make adjustments (by spending a little less on calling the old 
country, for example).
A word to the wise: Don’t gear up your business overhead or your personal 
living and lifestyle when you have a great year (or even a few great years) in 
the business. When you have a good year or even a few good years, keep your 
overhead and expenses modest. Stash the extra cash. If you can, build up 
some financial wealth that’s independent and apart from your business 
assets. Contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), for example, or 
set up a Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA or a 
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRA for yourself and any employees.
A Budgeting Secret You Won’t  
Learn in College
I also have a secret tip for you. (I’m going to write very quietly now so that no one 
else hears.)
Here’s the secret tip: Go to the library and ask for the Robert Morris Associates Sur-
vey, the Risk Management Association (or RMA) Reference, the Dun & Bradstreet Annual 
Financial Statement Survey, and any similar references of business financial statis-
tics. After you get these references, find a nice, quiet corner of the library and look 
up how other businesses like yours (that is, businesses that are the same size, sell 
the same stuff or services, and have the same gross and net profits) spend money.
These references are really cool. Robert Morris Associates, for example, surveys 
bank lending officers, creates a summary of the information that these bankers 
receive from their customers, and publishes the results. You can look up things 
such as what percentage of sales the average tavern spends on beer and peanuts.
Plan to spend an hour or so at the library. Getting used to the way that the Robert 
Morris Associates report displays information takes a while. The taverns page 
doesn’t actually have a line for beer and peanuts, for example. Instead, you see 
some vague accounting term like cost of goods sold.
Make a few notes so that you can use the information you glean to better plan your 
own business financial affairs. If you spend about the same amount on beer and 
peanuts every year as the average tavern, you’re in good shape — well, unless you 
own a shoe store.

232      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
The point is that you can and should use this information to get a better handle on 
what businesses like yours earn and spend.
A final, tangential point: Have you ever heard businesspeople talk about bench-
marking? The idea is that to compete in a market, you need to do at least as well as 
your competitors or similar firms in other markets. And one way to assess how 
you’re doing compared with competitors is to compare financial ratios, or bench-
marks. If you compare what you spend as a percentage of revenue on advertising 
with what similar firms spend, for example, you can often glean real insights into 
what you should do to better your business. You’ll discover where you’re spending 
too much and where you’re spending too little. You’ll also sometimes see com-
petitive advantages that you possess but weren’t aware of earlier.
Industry, trade, and professional associations often supply useful statistics about 
their members that members can use for benchmarking. Certified public accoun-
tants (CPAs) can use the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ MAP 
Survey, which has tons of info about all facets of a CPA firm’s finances and 
accounting. (MAP is an acronym for Management of an Accounting Practice.) 
Surely, if your trade, industry, or professional society does a survey of its mem-
bers, that survey’s information can be used for similar benchmarking.
Setting Up a Secret Plan
Okay, enough background stuff. The time has come to set up your budget — er, 
your Secret Plan — in QuickBooks. Follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Company ➪ Planning & Budgeting ➪ Set Up Budgets.
If you haven’t yet set up a budget, QuickBooks displays the Create New Budget 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-1. If you’ve already set up a budget, another 
window appears, and you need to click the Create New Budget button to get to 
the Create New Budget dialog box.
2.	 Select the year that you want to budget.
Use the date field to specify the fiscal year. You use the arrows at the end of 
the field to adjust the year number incrementally.
3.	 Select the type of budget that you want to create; then click Next.
See those two radio buttons? They let you tell QuickBooks whether you want to 
create a budget of income and expense amounts (done with a pro forma profit 
and loss statement) or a budget of year-end asset, liability, and owner’s equity 
account balances (done with a pro forma balance sheet). Typically, you want to 
budget income and expense amounts (Profit and Loss radio button).

CHAPTER 12  Building the Perfect Budget      233
4.	 Provide any additional budgeting criteria and instructions; then  
click Next.
Next, QuickBooks asks whether you want to budget using additional criteria, 
such as Customer:Job information or class information. You answer this 
question by selecting the radio button that corresponds to the budgeting 
criteria you want. (If you’re just starting out, don’t worry about specifying 
additional criteria. Keep things simple to start.)
5.	 Indicate whether you want to start from scratch.
QuickBooks asks whether you want to create a first draft by using last year’s 
numbers or whether you want to start from scratch. To answer this question, 
select the option button that corresponds to your choice. To budget from 
scratch, for example, select the Create Budget from Scratch radio button.
6.	 Click Finish.
QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window (see Figure 12-2).
7.	 Do your budget.
You use the Set Up Budgets window to identify the budgeted amounts that you 
plan for each account. Just click the monthly amount you want to budget and 
enter a value. If you say that you want to budget from scratch, by the way, 
QuickBooks shows a window with a bunch of empty columns (like the window 
in Figure 12-2). If you say that you want to base the coming year’s budget on 
last year’s real numbers, you see numbers in the columns.
If your Set Up Budgets window is too big for the monitor, QuickBooks shows 
only a few months of budgeted data at a time and often only some of the 
buttons. You should be able to click the Show Next 6 Months and Show Prev  
6 Months buttons to move to the next or previous part of the budget year. 
Sometimes, you can also tweak the Windows display settings (specifically, the 
screen resolution) to see the full year.
FIGURE 12-1: 
The Create  
New Budget 
dialog box.

234      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
The Budget drop-down list, in the top-left corner of the Set Up Budgets 
window, lets you select the budget you want to work with. Why? You can work 
with several versions of your budget. (To create a new budget, click the Create 
New Budget button, which guides you through the process described 
­previously.)
To copy the amount shown in the selected box across the row, click the Copy 
Across button. This button lets you copy, for example, some amount you 
budgeted for January into February, March, April, May, and so on.
If you want to be a little fancier, you can select some budgeted amount and 
click the Adjust Row Amounts button. QuickBooks displays the Adjust Row 
Amounts dialog box (see Figure 12-3), which lets you adjust the selected 
amount by some specified percentage of increase or decrease. If you want to 
increase the budgeted amount by, say, 25% per month, you use the Adjust 
Row Amounts dialog box.
8.	 Save your budgeting work.
After you enter your Secret Plan, click Save to save your work and leave the Set 
Up Budgets window open. Or click OK to save your work but close the Set Up 
Budgets window.
FIGURE 12-2: 
The Set Up 
Budgets window.

CHAPTER 12  Building the Perfect Budget      235
I should mention, too, that you can just click Cancel if you don’t want to save your 
work (in case you’ve just been noodling around).
Adjusting a Secret Plan
To make additional changes in a budget later, choose Company ➪ Planning & 
­Budgeting ➪ Set Up Budgets. QuickBooks displays the Set Up Budgets window 
(refer to Figure 12-2). Select the budget that you want to work with from the Bud-
get drop-down list and then make your changes. All the same tools that you had 
for initially setting up your forecast (which I describe in the preceding section) are 
available for editing your budget.
Forecasting Profits and Losses
QuickBooks can prepare a forecast of a year’s profits (or losses) by calculating 
what your income statement will look like based either on A) the previous year’s 
income and expenses or B) actual numbers that you input, very similar to how you 
budget in the previous section.
To tell QuickBooks to forecast profits and losses, choose Company ➪ Planning & 
Budgeting ➪ Set Up Forecast. Then, when QuickBooks starts its clever little wizard, 
follow the onscreen instructions. If you have questions, you can refer to the dis-
cussion about setting up a budget earlier in this chapter.
FIGURE 12-3: 
The Adjust  
Row Amounts 
dialog box.

236      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
Projecting Cash Flows
If you tell it to, QuickBooks attempts to project your business’s cash flows. To tell 
QuickBooks to do this, choose Company ➪ Planning & Budgeting ➪ Cash Flow Pro-
jector. Then, when QuickBooks starts its clever little wizard, you follow the 
onscreen instructions. (This cash flow projector essentially automates the same 
process that you’d step through on a scratch pad or the back of an envelope.)
Using the Business Planner Tools
Depending on the version of QuickBooks that you use, one other command may be 
available on the Planning & Budgeting submenu: the Use Business Plan Tool. The 
Use Business Plan Tool command starts another software program called Quick-
Books Business Planner that steps you through writing a business plan. When you 
choose the command, QuickBooks starts the business-plan software, and you write 
your business plan by following the onscreen steps. If you’re interested in using 
this tool, just experiment. You can’t do any damage to the QuickBooks data file.
If you didn’t buy a version of QuickBooks that supplies the Business Planner soft-
ware, and you’re now totally bummed out, let me mention that I have quite a bit 
of free business-planning information available at my www.stephenlnelson.com 
website, including Excel business-planning templates that you can use.

Online with 
QuickBooks
I
n this chapter, I start by discussing the QuickBooks online banking and bill 
payment features and then cover the Intuit PaymentNetwork services, which 
are pretty cool tools for some businesses. At the end of the chapter, I briefly 
review some of the other online services that Intuit provides for QuickBooks users.
Doing the Electronic Banking Thing
Before I discuss using the QuickBooks online banking and payment services, you 
need to consider whether these features even make sense for you and your busi-
ness. Online banking does make sense for some people — maybe even you. Then 
again, it might be more like the fins on a ’62 Cadillac: cool, but not that cool.
So what’s the commotion about?
For QuickBooks, online banking includes two parts: online banking itself and 
online bill payment. Basically, online banking enables you to transmit account 
transfer instructions to your bank and download (retrieve) account information 
Chapter 13

238      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
electronically by using your computer and the Internet. Online bill payment 
enables you to transmit payment instructions electronically. (You basically tell 
your bank to write, stamp, and mail a check so that you don’t have to.)
And that, my friend, is about all there is to online banking.
A handful of reasons to be cautious  
about banking online
I don’t know whether you should bank online, really, but I’ll share some thoughts 
with you. And no kidding, I’ve had my reservations over the years about this fea-
ture. Is it safe? Is it easy? Is it just another way for a software company and my 
bank to make more money off me?
Here’s my latest thinking on the matter: You ought to use online banking. It is 
safe, if you don’t share your personal identification number (PIN), and it saves 
you tons of time. In fact, online banking should allow many business owners to do 
their books themselves for just a few minutes of work at the end of the week.
That being said, I should quickly point out the few flies in the ointment, so to 
speak:
»
» Your bank needs to use the Intuit service. To use the full-blown online 
banking service, you need to use a bank that has signed up for this Intuit 
service. Many, many big banks have signed up. More banks sign up all the 
time, of course, but some haven’t yet. So if your bank hasn’t jumped on the 
bandwagon — that is, the Intuit bandwagon — you can’t jump on the band-
wagon either, at least not as a full-fledged member of the band.
To find out whether your bank provides online banking, choose Banking ➪  
Bank Feeds ➪ Participating Financial Institutions. After you’re connected to the 
Internet, QuickBooks displays a list of the banks that support the Intuit flavor 
of online banking.
»
» It isn’t totally paperless. Although a totally electronic system sounds really 
efficient and very slick, you need to realize that online bill payment (a key 
component of online banking) often isn’t that efficient or slick because, to be 
quite honest, the system isn’t totally electronic.
“What the . . . ?” you’re asking. “I thought that was the point.” Let me explain. 
For better or worse, most businesses are still set up to — and still expect 
to — receive paper checks with remittance advices. What often happens when 
you transmit payment instructions is that the bank or online payment service 
simply prints a check for you. Think about that for a minute. If the bank is 

CHAPTER 13  Online with QuickBooks      239
printing your check, you still have all the disadvantages of a printed check, 
including the following:
•	 You still need to allow extra time for mailing.
•	 You still have the possibility that the check will get lost.
•	 You still have the possibility that the check will be misapplied. In other 
words, the check to pay your power bill might be applied to your neigh-
bor’s account instead.
»
» There’s a greater chance for error. What’s more, you have the extra 
complication of having your bank, rather than you, mucking up all this stuff.
»
» It ain’t free. Worst of all, the bank most likely charges for this service. And so 
does Intuit. (Remember that banks and software companies think that online 
banking is a way for them to make money.)
»
» You might run into possible vendor confusion. Receiving payments from 
your bank, as opposed to directly from you, might confuse your vendors. The 
confusion occurs because the checks that they receive come all bundled up in 
these cute little envelopes that must be torn along the perforation on just about 
all sides. And because you can’t send a remittance slip with an online payment, 
vendors can easily credit your account incorrectly, which can lead to problems. 
(My power company regularly threatens to turn off the gas to my office because 
even though my electric and gas charges are included in the same bill, the 
power company doesn’t like me to send one check via the QuickBooks online 
bill payment system. It needs two checks: one for the electric bill and one for 
the gas bill.)
One other problem bears mentioning. When you use online banking, you create a 
complex system without clear responsibilities for problem-solving and technical 
support. And that means that when you have problems, you can’t always call 
someone to get help. (No kidding. Just the other day, some poor guy emailed me 
because his online banking stuff wasn’t working. Intuit blamed the bank, the bank 
blamed his PC hardware, the PC company blamed Intuit. This guy has a problem 
that nobody can solve or will solve.) This is important to understand, so let me 
briefly outline the steps that an online payment might take:
1.	 You enter the transaction in QuickBooks.
2.	 You make (or QuickBooks makes) an Internet connection.
3.	 QuickBooks uses the Internet connection to send the transaction to the bank.
4.	 The bank receives the transaction information and typically creates a check, 
which it mails to the person you’re paying.
5.	 The person you’re paying gets the check (you hope) and credits your account.

240      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
Five simple steps, right? Wrong. Any of these five steps can go wrong. And if one 
does, you don’t actually make the payment or transfer, and you won’t know why:
»
» Bugs happen. If QuickBooks or your computer has a bug, it might say that 
you entered and transmitted a transaction when in fact you didn’t. This has 
happened to me.
»
» Ya gotta get online. If your Internet connection doesn’t work or doesn’t work 
dependably, you can’t send the online transaction. I’ve had problems with 
online banking at home over a cable-modem Internet connection (storm 
outages) and at work when using a network and a fiber-optic connection 
(either an incorrectly configured network or bad hardware).
»
» Banks are fallible. If the bank screws up in printing or mailing the check, of 
course your check won’t get there. (I’ve had this happen, too — no kidding.) 
QuickBooks lets you enter a five-line address on a check, but the check 
printed by the bank or online payment service can have only four lines. So 
QuickBooks just removes the fifth line of the address block.
I don’t mean to rant here, but whenever any of these problems occurs, you won’t 
actually know what’s gone wrong  — only that something has gone wrong. And 
you’ll be responsible for solving the problem, even though it might be the fault of 
your bank, Intuit, your Internet service provider, the telephone company, or 
somebody else.
FINDING A BANK YOU CAN TRUST
Say you want to use the Intuit online banking services, but your bank isn’t signed up. In 
response to this problem, many people might say, “Well, dodo-brain, just switch banks.” 
But not you. You know that switching banks is harder than it sounds, especially for small 
businesses — and often isn’t a smart move. Many factors go into a successful small-
business banking relationship:
•	 Convenience: Doing your banking should be easy.
•	 Trust based on a long history: With this in hand, you can borrow money or set up 
merchant credit card accounts without using your children for collateral.
•	 Good rapport with a personal banker or loan officer: If you ever have a 
­problem — and I hope that doesn’t happen — you have someone with whom 
you can talk.
Sure, online banking is neat. (Like Cadillac fins.) But online banking is neither the only 
nor the most important feature you need to look at when you consider a bank.

CHAPTER 13  Online with QuickBooks      241
Making sense of online banking
So what should you do? Let me make a suggestion: If you use a bank that provides 
online banking, go ahead and try the service. Absolutely! It isn’t very expensive — 
very possibly free or (worst case) only a few dollars per month. If you decide later 
that you don’t like the service, you can always go back to banking the old- 
fashioned way.
If you use a bank that doesn’t provide online banking services, and you’re really 
bummed out about it, you can try the online bill payment component of online 
banking by using the Intuit online bill payment service. Online bill payment is the 
part where you send instructions to your bank (if it provides the service) or to 
Intuit to write and mail checks for you. You can use the online bill payment service 
with any account. In essence, you give Intuit permission to automatically deduct 
money from your account to make payments for you.
If you use a bank that doesn’t provide online banking, and you couldn’t care less, 
don’t try the online banking stuff, don’t read any more of this chapter, and con-
sider taking the rest of the afternoon off.
Signing up for the service
All you need to do to sign up for online banking service is choose Banking ➪ Bank 
Feeds ➪ Set Up Account for Online Services. QuickBooks starts an online applica-
tion wizard that walks you through the steps to apply for the online banking 
­services. Just follow the onscreen instructions, and voilà! That’s it. Another benefit 
of being literate.
To actually begin transmitting online payments or making account inquiries, you 
need to complete the application and have that application processed. Note, too, 
that you can usually complete the application by filling out paperwork from your 
bank and turning that in. You might not have to use the online application 
process.
Making an online payment
Plan to create and send online payments a good week before they’re due. Process-
ing your request and then printing and sending a check takes time for the online 
bill payment service, and a check that your bank sends doesn’t go through the 
mail any faster than a check you send yourself. So don’t expect online bill pay-
ment to save you any time compared with sending checks that you print or hand-
write yourself.

242      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
After you sign up for online banking, making payments is easy. Just follow these 
steps:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Write Checks.
You can also click the Write Checks icon on the home screen. If you’ve written 
checks with QuickBooks before, you probably recognize your old friend the 
Write Checks window, as shown in Figure 13-1.
2.	 Click the Bank Account drop-down list at the top of the window and then 
choose the account from which you want to write this check.
Choosing the account is a really important step. Make sure that you’re accessing 
the correct account before you write a check.
3.	 Select the Pay Online check box.
Selecting this check box is another important step. If you don’t select this check 
box, you aren’t making an online payment; you’re just writing a regular check 
that you need to print or handwrite.
FIGURE 13-1: 
The Write Checks 
window.

CHAPTER 13  Online with QuickBooks      243
4.	 Fill in the check.
If the payee appears on one of your name lists, the AutoFill feature fills in the 
name of the payee in the Pay to the Order Of line after you type a few letters. 
For online bill payment, you must have the correct address. If the address is 
incomplete, QuickBooks warns you and asks you to correct it. If you haven’t 
entered a transaction for this person or party before or added that individual 
or party to a list, QuickBooks asks you to Quick Add or Set Up the payee name. 
Do that.
By the way, QuickBooks makes you collect more information about anyone 
you’re going to pay with an online payment.
Enter the amount of the check next to the dollar sign and then press Tab. 
QuickBooks writes out the amount for you on the Dollars line.
5.	 Fill in the Expenses and Items tabs, if necessary.
Don’t know what these tabs are? Chapter 6 explains them in minute detail. 
Start turning those pages.
6.	 Click the Save & New button or the Save & Close button to finish writing 
the check.
Click Save & New to write another check, or click Save & Close if you’re finished 
writing checks for the moment. There you have it. Your check is written, entered 
in the Checking register, and ready to be sent so that your bank or Intuit can 
print and mail it.
And you thought this stuff was going to be tough, didn’t you?
People who have grown accustomed to Quicken, a cousin product of QuickBooks, 
may want to use the Register window to make online payments. You can use the 
Register window in QuickBooks, too, although doing so isn’t quite as slick. You 
just enter the payment in the usual way, except that you type the word SEND in 
the Check Number text box.
Transferring money electronically
You can electronically transfer money between bank accounts, too, as long as the 
accounts are at the same bank. (Both accounts, of course, also need to be set for 
online banking.) Here’s what you need to do:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Transfer Funds.
You see the Transfer Funds Between Accounts window.

244      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
2.	 From the Transfer Funds From drop-down list, choose the bank account 
that you’re going to transfer the money from.
3.	 From the Transfer Funds To drop-down list, choose the bank account to 
which you want to transfer the money.
4.	 Select the account that you want to receive the funds.
5.	 Select the Online Funds Transfer check box.
Doing so tells QuickBooks that you want to make this transfer electronically. 
(This box doesn’t appear if you’re not set up for online banking.)
6.	 Enter the amount that you want to transfer in the Transfer Amount field 
and then fill in the Memo text box.
Someday, you might go into the register for the account that you’re transfer-
ring money from and wonder where you transferred this money and why. 
Filling in the Memo line solves this little mystery beforehand.
7.	 Click Save & Close.
The transfer is recorded. After you transmit the transfer instructions (which I 
describe a little later in this chapter), the transfer transaction is posted to your 
account — maybe not immediately, but as fast as a telephone transfer or an 
ATM transfer is posted.
Changing instructions
QuickBooks doesn’t actually send, or transmit, your payment and transfer instruc-
tions until you tell it to. This little fact means that you can change or edit your 
payment instructions (what you enter with the Write Checks window) and your 
transfer instructions (what you enter with the Transfer Funds Between Accounts 
window) until you actually transmit them. You edit online payments and account 
transfers in the same way that you edit regular payments and account transfers. 
Read Chapter 8 if you need more information.
Transmitting instructions
After you describe the online payments and account transfers that you want 
QuickBooks to make, you transmit that information to the bank. To do so, follow 
these steps:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Bank Feeds ➪ Bank Feeds Center.
You see the Bank Feeds window, as shown in Figure 13-2.

CHAPTER 13  Online with QuickBooks      245
2.	 From the Financial Institution drop-down list from the window pane on 
the left side of the screen, choose the bank to which you’re transmitting 
payment and transfer instructions.
3.	 Review the payment and transfer instructions one last time.
Take one last peek at the Items to Send list to make sure that any payment and 
transfer instructions that you’re sending are correct. If you have questions 
about a particular instruction, click it and then click the Edit button. If you know 
that a particular payment instruction is incorrect, click it and then click the 
Delete button.
4.	 Click the Send/Receive button to transmit the payment and transfer 
instructions.
QuickBooks prompts you to provide a PIN in a cute little dialog box (see 
Figure 13-3). If you’re transmitting payment and transfer instructions for the 
first time, QuickBooks probably prompts you to change your PIN. If you don’t 
have any transactions to send, QuickBooks renames the button Receive 
Transactions.
5.	 Review any transactions that the bank tells you about.
After QuickBooks makes the connection and sends and receives transactions, 
QuickBooks updates the information shown in the Online Banking Center 
window. You can get more information about many of the items listed by 
FIGURE 13-2: 
The Bank Feeds 
window.

246      PART 3  Stuff You Do from Time to Time
clicking them. You can add transactions that QuickBooks downloads from 
the bank but that are not yet in your bank account registers by clicking the 
Add Transactions to QuickBooks button, which appears at the bottom of the 
window.
6.	 Click Close.
Hey, when you’re done, you’re done.
Message in a bottle
Doing all your banking electronically can be a little unsettling when you’re start-
ing out. What if you have a question, for example? All you do is send an email to 
the bank, asking the people there whatever question you’d normally ask in a 
­telephone call or at the drive-through window. To do so, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Bank Feeds ➪ Create Online Banking Message.
QuickBooks displays the Bank Feeds Message window and fills in the bank 
name (as long as you use online banking services with only one bank). If you 
use online banking services with more than one bank, choose the name of 
the bank to which you want to send a message from the Message To drop-
down list.
2.	 Click the Subject text box and then type a brief description of your 
message’s subject.
I may be telling you something you already know, but most email programs 
simply display a list of messages that includes the sender, the message subject, 
and the date. Therefore, the message subject that you use is one of the first 
bits of message information that the bank folks see.
3.	 Select the online account that you’re going to discuss in the message.
FIGURE 13-3: 
The dialog box 
you use to enter 
your PIN/
password.

CHAPTER 13  Online with QuickBooks      247
4.	 Click the Message text box and then type your message.
You’re on your own here.
5.	 (Optional) Click the Print button to print a copy of your message.
6.	 Click OK.
When you click OK, you add the message to the list of stuff that’s ready to send 
the next time you go online with your bank. You can send the instructions 
immediately by following the steps in the “Transmitting instructions” section 
earlier in this chapter.
A Quick Review of the Other  
Online Opportunities
Intuit provides several other small-business-type online services to QuickBooks 
users. The company has also arranged for a merchant credit card service, for 
example; you can apply for this service online and then use it online to receive 
payments and even get charge authorizations. QuickBooks automatically connects 
you to its online search marketing service. Finally, as I hint in Chapter 11, some of 
QuickBooks’ payroll services are very online-ish.
If you have questions about the current state of any of these products or services, 
visit the QuickBooks website (https://quickbooks.intuit.com/) and search for 
the name of the service.

IN THIS CHAPTER
Balancing your bank account
Troubleshooting when your account 
doesn’t balance
The Balancing Act
I
 
want to start this chapter with two important points. My first point: Balancing 
a bank account in QuickBooks is easy and quick.
And no, I’m not just trying to get you pumped up about an otherwise painfully 
boring topic. I don’t think that balancing a bank account is any more exciting than 
you do.
My point is simply this: Because bank account balancing can be tedious and 
­boring, use QuickBooks to reduce the drudgery.
And now, here’s my second point: You really do want to reconcile your business’s 
bank account using the process I describe in this chapter. By reconciling your bank 
accounts, you massively improve the income and expense data that QuickBooks 
uses to help you assess your venture’s profitability. Why? Because when you 
­reconcile your bank account, you tend to catch lots of errors that would otherwise 
go unnoticed.
Balancing a Bank Account
As I said, balancing a bank account is remarkably easy in QuickBooks. In fact, I’ll 
go so far as to say that if you have any problems, they stem from . . . well, sloppy 
record-keeping that preceded your use of QuickBooks.
Chapter 14

252      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
Enough of this blather. I get started by describing how you reconcile an account.
Giving QuickBooks information from  
the bank statement
In a reconciliation, as you probably know, you compare your records of a bank 
account with the bank’s records of the same account. You should be able to explain 
any difference between the two accounts  — usually by pointing to checks you 
wrote that haven’t yet cleared. (Sometimes deposits fall into the same category; 
you record a deposit and mail it, but the bank hasn’t yet credited your account.)
The first step, then, is to supply QuickBooks the bank’s account information. You 
get this information from your monthly statement. Supply QuickBooks the figures 
it needs, as follows:
1.	 Choose Banking ➪ Reconcile or click the Reconcile icon on the home 
screen.
QuickBooks displays the Begin Reconciliation dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-1.
If you have several bank accounts, you may have to select which account you 
want to reconcile.
2.	 If the bank account shown isn’t the one you want to reconcile, open the 
Account drop-down list and choose the correct account.
3.	 Enter the bank statement date in the Statement Date text box.
You can adjust a date one day at a time by using the plus (+) and minus (–) 
keys. You can also click the Calendar button at the right end of the Statement 
Date text box to select a date from the calendar.
FIGURE 14-1: 
The Begin 
Reconciliation 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 14  The Balancing Act      253
See the online Cheat Sheet for a list of other secret date-editing tricks. For 
more on how to access the Cheat Sheet, see this book’s introduction.
4.	Verify the bank statement opening balance.
QuickBooks displays an amount in the Beginning Balance section of the screen 
(refer to Figure 14-1).
If the opening balance isn’t correct, see the sidebar “Why isn’t my opening 
balance the same as the one in QuickBooks?” later in this chapter.
5.	Enter the ending balance from your bank statement in the Ending 
Balance text box.
6.	Enter the bank’s service charge.
If the bank statement shows a service charge, and you haven’t already entered 
it, move the cursor to the Service Charge text box and type the amount. (Type 
20 for a $20 service charge, for example.)
7.	Enter a transaction date for the service-charge transaction.
QuickBooks adds one month to the service-charge date from the last time you 
reconciled. If this date isn’t correct, type the correct one.
8.	Assign the bank’s service charge to an account.
Enter the expense account to which you assign bank service charges in the first 
Account text box — the one beside the Date text box. Activate the drop-down 
list by clicking the down arrow, highlight the category by using the arrow keys, 
and then press Enter. I’ll bet anything that you record these charges in the 
Bank Service Charges account that QuickBooks sets up by default.
If you told QuickBooks that you also want to track income and expense 
amounts by using classes, QuickBooks adds Class text boxes to the Begin 
Reconciliation dialog box so that you can collect this information.
9.	Enter the account’s interest income.
If the account earned interest for the month, and you haven’t already entered 
this figure, type an amount in the Interest Earned text box.
10.	Enter a transaction date for the interest income transaction.
You already know how to enter dates. I won’t bore you by explaining it again 
(but see Step 3 if you have trouble).
11.	Assign the interest to an account.
In the second Account text box, enter the account to which this account’s 
interest should be assigned. I bet that you record this one under the Interest 
Income account, which is near the bottom of the Account drop-down list. To 
select a category from the Account list, activate the drop-down list by clicking 
the down arrow, highlight the category, and then press Enter.

254      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
12.	Click the Continue button.
QuickBooks displays the Reconcile window, as shown in Figure 14-2.
Marking cleared checks and deposits
In the Reconcile window, shown in Figure 14-2, you tell QuickBooks which depos-
its and checks have cleared at the bank. (Refer to your bank statement for this 
information.) Follow these steps:
1.	Identify the first deposit that has cleared.
You know how to do this, I’m sure. Just leaf through the bank statement and 
find the first deposit listed.
2.	Mark the first cleared deposit as cleared.
Scroll through the transactions listed in the Deposits and Other Credits section 
of the Reconcile window, find the deposit, and then click it. You also can 
highlight the deposit by using the Tab or arrow keys and then pressing the 
spacebar. QuickBooks places a check mark in front of the deposit to mark it as 
cleared and updates the cleared statement balance.
FIGURE 14-2: 
The Reconcile 
window.

CHAPTER 14  The Balancing Act      255
If you have a large number of deposits to clear, and you can identify them 
quickly, click the Mark All button and then simply unmark the transactions that 
aren’t on the bank statement. To unmark a transaction, click it. The check mark 
disappears.
3.	 Record any cleared but missing deposits.
If you can’t find a deposit in the Reconcile window, you haven’t entered it into 
the register yet. I can only guess why you haven’t entered it. Maybe you just 
forgot. Close or deactivate the Reconcile window by clicking the Leave button. 
Now open the register and enter the deposit in the register in the usual way. 
To return to the Reconcile window, either reopen it or reactivate it. Or, if you 
like, you can just choose Banking ➪ Make Deposits and open the deposit 
screen right on top of the Reconcile window. Record the deposit and then click 
the Save & Close button. When you open the Reconcile window again, the 
deposit appears in the Deposits and Other Credits area.
4.	 Repeat Steps 1–3 for all deposits listed on the bank statement.
Make sure that the dates match and that the amounts of the deposits are 
correct. If they’re not, go back to the transactions and correct them. To get to a 
transaction, click the Go To button. You see the Write Checks or Make Deposits 
window where the transaction was originally recorded. Make the corrections 
there and then click Save & Close. You return to the Reconcile window.
5.	 Identify the first check that has cleared.
No sweat, right? Just find the first check or withdrawal listed on the bank 
statement.
QuickBooks enables you to sort the transactions listed in the Reconcile window 
by clicking the column headings in the Checks and Payments section and in the 
Deposits and Other Credits section. You might want to experiment a bit with 
this handy feature. Sorting and re-sorting transactions — particularly in 
high-transaction volume bank accounts — often eases the work of reconciling 
a bank account.
6.	 Mark the first cleared check as cleared.
Scroll through the transactions listed in the Checks and Payments section of 
the Reconcile window; find the first check; and then click it. You also can 
highlight it by pressing Tab and an arrow key. Then press the spacebar. 
QuickBooks inserts a check mark to label this transaction as cleared and 
updates the cleared statement balance.
7.	 Record any missing but cleared checks.
If you can’t find a check or withdrawal in QuickBooks, guess what? You haven’t 
entered it in the register yet. Close or deactivate the Reconcile window by 
clicking its Leave button or by activating another window. Then display the 

256      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
register and enter the check or withdrawal. To return to the Reconcile window, 
reopen or reactivate it. Or you can just choose Banking ➪ Write Checks, create 
the check right on top of the Reconcile window, and then click Save & Close to 
return to the Reconcile screen and carry on from where you left off.
8.	 Repeat Steps 5–7 for all withdrawals listed on the bank statement.
These steps don’t take very long. Reconciling my account each month takes me 
about two minutes. I’m not joking or exaggerating. By two minutes, I really mean 
two minutes.
If the difference equals zero
After you mark all the cleared checks and deposits, the difference between the 
Cleared Balance for the account and the bank statement’s Ending Balance should 
equal zero. Notice that I said should  — not will. Refer to Figure  14-2, which 
­(fortunately) shows a Reconcile window in which everything is hunky-dory. If the 
difference is small, look for small differences between the amounts of the checks 
in the register and the actual cleared checks in the bank statement. If you find a 
discrepancy with a particular check, just click the Go To button to go to the check 
and change the amount. Click Save & Close to go right back to the Reconcile 
window.
If the difference does equal zero, you’re finished. Just click the Reconcile Now 
button. QuickBooks displays a congratulatory message box telling you that the 
reconciliation is complete. As a reward for being such a good boy or girl, the mes-
sage box asks whether you want to print a free, all-expenses-paid Summary or 
Full reconciliation report. Click Summary or Full and then click OK if you want to 
print the report. Otherwise, just click OK.
Can’t decide whether to print the reconciliation report? Unless you’re a business 
bookkeeper or an accountant who is reconciling a bank account for someone else — 
your employer or a client, for example — you don’t need to print the reconciliation 
report. All that printing does is prove that you reconciled the account. (Basically, 
this proof is the reason why you should print the report if you’re a bookkeeper or an 
accountant. The person for whom you’re reconciling the account will know that you 
did your job and will have a piece of paper to refer to later with any questions.) Also, 
you can always come back and print the report later, if necessary. QuickBooks saves 
the Reconciliation reports under Reports ➪ Banking ➪ Previous Reconciliation.
Now each deposit, withdrawal, and check that you just cleared is marked with a 
check mark in your register. If you don’t believe me, open the register and find out.

CHAPTER 14  The Balancing Act      257
If the difference doesn’t equal zero
If the difference doesn’t equal zero, you have a problem. If you click the Reconcile 
Now button, QuickBooks shows you the Reconcile Adjustment dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 14-3. This dialog box tells you how unbalanced your account is 
and asks whether you want to adjust your maladjusted account.
Click the Return to Reconcile button if you want to go back to the Reconcile win-
dow and start the search for the missing or incorrectly entered transaction.
If you want to force the two amounts to agree, click OK. Forcing the two amounts 
to agree isn’t a very good idea. To do so, QuickBooks adds a cleared transaction 
equal to the difference. (I talk about this transaction a little later in the chapter.)
WHY ISN’T MY OPENING BALANCE THE 
SAME AS THE ONE IN QuickBooks?
An opening balance that isn’t the same as the one shown in the Beginning Balance sec-
tion can mean a couple of things.
First, you may have mistakenly cleared a transaction the last time you reconciled. If you 
cleared a transaction last month that didn’t go through until this month, your opening 
balance is wrong. Go back to the register, and examine transactions. Each one that’s 
cleared has a check mark next to it in the narrow column between the Payment and 
Deposit columns. If one of the checks that appears on this month’s statement has a 
check mark, you made a boo-boo last month. From the register, click the check mark to 
remove it. You’re asked to confirm your actions. The check now appears in the Reconcile 
window.
The other reason why the opening balance can be different is that a transaction that 
you cleared in the past got changed. If you deleted a transaction that occurred before 
this reconciliation period, for example, it threw off your balance. Why? Because the 
transaction that you deleted helped balance your account the last time around, but now 
that transaction is gone.
Whatever happens, don’t fret. If you can’t track down the faulty transaction, you can just 
have QuickBooks adjust the balance for you, which I explain elsewhere in this chapter. If 
you frequently find that your accounts don’t balance, consider using the QuickBooks 
Audit Trail report, which lists changes to the QuickBooks data, when it’s time to reconcile 
your accounts.

258      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
Postponing a reconciliation (by clicking the Leave Reconcile button) and not 
choosing to adjust the bank account balance is usually the best approach, because 
you can locate and correct the problem later, when you have fresh eyes. (The next 
section contains some ideas that can help you determine what the problem is.) 
Then you can restart the reconciliation and finish your work. (You restart a recon-
ciliation the same way that you originate one.)
Eleven Things to Do If Your Non-Online 
Account Doesn’t Balance
I want to give you some suggestions for reconciling an account when you’re hav-
ing problems. If you’re sitting in front of your computer, wringing your hands, try 
the tips in this section:
»
» Make sure that you’re working with the right account. Sounds dumb, 
doesn’t it? If you have several bank accounts, however, ending up in the wrong 
account is darn easy. So go ahead and confirm, for example, that you’re trying 
to reconcile your checking account at Mammoth International Bank by using 
the Mammoth International Bank checking account statement.
»
» Look for transactions that the bank has recorded but you haven’t. Go 
through the bank statement to make sure that you recorded every transac-
tion that your bank has recorded. You can easily overlook cash-machine 
withdrawals, special fees, or service charges (such as charges for checks or 
your safe deposit box), automatic withdrawals, direct deposits, and so on.
If the difference is positive — that is, the bank thinks that you have less money 
than you think that you should have — you may be missing a withdrawal 
transaction. If the difference is negative, you may be missing a deposit 
transaction.
»
» Look for reversed transactions. Here’s a tricky one: If you accidentally enter 
a transaction backward — a deposit as a withdrawal or a withdrawal as a 
FIGURE 14-3: 
The Reconcile 
Adjustment 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 14  The Balancing Act      259
deposit — your account doesn’t balance. And the error can be difficult to find. 
The Reconcile window shows all the correct transactions, but a transaction 
amount appears in the wrong list. (The amount appears in the Deposits and 
Other Credits list when it belongs in the Checks and Payments list, or vice 
versa.) The check that you wrote to Acme Housewreckers for the demolition 
of your carport appears in the Deposits and Other Credits list, for example.
»
» Look for a transaction that’s equal to half the difference. One handy way 
to find the transaction that you entered backward — if you have only one — is 
to look for a transaction that’s equal to half the irreconcilable difference. If the 
difference is $200, for example, you may have entered a $100 deposit as a 
withdrawal or a $100 withdrawal as a deposit.
»
» Look for a transaction that’s equal to the difference. While I’m on the 
subject of explaining the difference by looking at individual transactions, I’ll 
make an obvious point: If the difference between the bank’s records and 
yours equals one of the transactions listed in your register, you may have 
incorrectly marked the transaction as cleared or incorrectly left the transac-
tion unmarked (shown as uncleared). I don’t know. Maybe that was too 
obvious. Naaaah.
»
» Check for transposed numbers. Transposed numbers are flip-flopped digits. 
You might enter $45.89 as $48.59, for example. These turkeys always cause 
headaches for accountants and bookkeepers. If you look at the numbers, 
detecting an error is often difficult because the digits are the same. When you 
compare a check amount of $45.89 in your register with a check for $48.59 
shown on your bank statement, both check amounts show the same digits:  
4, 5, 8, and 9. They just show them in a different order.
Transposed numbers are tough to find, but here’s a trick that you can try: 
Divide the difference shown in the Reconcile window by 9. If the result is an 
even number of dollars or cents, chances are good that you have a trans-
posed number somewhere.
»
» Use the Locate Discrepancies button. Would you mind, terribly, taking a 
peek back at Figure 14-1? The dialog box shown in that figure includes a 
Locate Discrepancies button, which you can click to display another dialog box 
that prints reports that may help you reconcile your account. In particular, the 
dialog box lets you view a report of changes made in previously cleared 
transactions (which would be pretty suspicious bookkeeping activity and 
would definitely foul up your reconciliation). It also shows a report that lists 
transactions marked as cleared during previous reconciliations, which might 
be interesting because maybe you erroneously marked a transaction as 
cleared before it really was cleared.

260      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
»
» Have someone else look over your work. This idea may seem pretty 
obvious, but I’m amazed by how often a second pair of eyes can find some-
thing that I overlooked. Ask one of your co-workers or employees (preferably 
that one person who always seems to have way too much free time) to look 
over everything for you.
»
» Be on the lookout for multiple errors. If you find an error by using this 
laundry list and still have a difference, start checking at the top of the list 
again. You may discover, for example, after you find a transposed number 
that you entered another transaction backward, or incorrectly cleared or 
uncleared a transaction.
»
» Try again next month (and maybe the month after that). If the difference 
isn’t huge in relation to the size of your bank account, you may want to wait 
until next month and attempt to reconcile your account again.
Before my carefree attitude puts you in a panic, consider the following 
example: In January, you reconcile your account, and the difference is $24.02. 
Then you reconcile the account in February, and the difference is $24.02. You 
reconcile the account in March, and — surprise, surprise — the difference is 
still $24.02. What’s going on here? Well, your starting account balance was 
probably off by $24.02. (The more months you try to reconcile your account 
and find that you’re always mysteriously $24.02 off, the more likely that this 
type of error is to blame.) After the second or third month, I think that having 
QuickBooks enter an adjusting transaction of $24.02 so that your account 
balances is pretty reasonable. (In my opinion, this circumstance is the only 
one that merits your adjusting an account to match the bank’s figure.)
If you successfully reconciled your account with QuickBooks before, your work 
may not be at fault. The mistake may be (drum roll, please) the bank’s! And in 
this case, you should do something else . . . .
»
» Get in your car, drive to the bank, and beg for help. As an alternative to 
the preceding idea — which supposes that the bank’s statement is correct and 
that your records are incorrect — I propose that you ask the bank to help you 
reconcile the account. Hint that you think the mistake is probably the bank’s, 
but do so in a very nice, cordial way. Smile a lot. And one other thing: Be sure 
to ask about whatever product the bank is currently advertising in the lobby 
(which encourages the staff to think that you’re interested in that 180-month 
certificate of deposit, causing them to be extra-nice to you).
In general, the bank’s record-keeping is usually pretty darn good. I’ve never 
had a problem either with my business or personal accounts. (I’ve also been 
lucky enough to deal with big, well-run banks.) Nevertheless, your bank quite 
possibly has made a mistake, so ask for help. Be sure to ask for an explana-
tion of any transactions that you discover only by seeing them in your bank 
statement. By the way, you’ll probably pay for this help.

T
o find out whether your business is thriving or diving, you use the 
QuickBooks Reports feature. The different kinds of reports in QuickBooks 
cover everything from cash flow to missing checks, not to mention 
QuickReports. QuickReports are summary reports that you can get from the infor-
mation in forms, account registers, or lists by merely clicking the mouse.
In this chapter, I tell you how to prepare reports, how to print them, and how to 
customize reports for your special needs.
What Kinds of Reports Are There, Anyway?
If you run a small business, you don’t need all the reports that QuickBooks offers, 
but many of these reports are extremely useful. Reports show you how healthy or 
Chapter 15

262      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
unhealthy your business is, where your profits are, and where you’re wasting time 
and squandering resources.
To make sense of what might otherwise become mass confusion, QuickBooks 
organizes all its reports in categories. You can see all the categories by pulling 
down the Reports menu or by clicking the Report Center icon. The names of the 
reports read a bit like public-television documentary names, don’t they? 
(“Tonight, Joob Taylor explores the mazelike federal budget in Budget Reports.”) 
You select a report category to see a list of report names.
In Table 15-1, I describe reports by category and give a short description of the 
major reports in each category. To get a thorough description of a particular 
report, use the Help feature. To find out what a standard profit and loss report 
does, for example, choose Help ➪ QuickBooks Help and then click the Index tab. 
Type financial statements in the text box. (The Help information includes a won-
derful discussion of how to understand the profit and loss and balance sheet 
financial statements.) Or, from the Reports Center, select the type of report on the 
left. You see a list of the different reports available on the right side, with a 
description of the information contained in each one. To read the details about a 
topic, click that topic in the list.
TABLE 15-1 
QuickBooks Report Categories
Report Category
Description
Company & Financial
These reports give you a bird’s-eye view of your company’s health and cash flow. 
They give you a snapshot of your assets, liabilities, and equity, showing income, 
expenses, and net profit or loss over time.
Customers & 
Receivables
These accounts receivable reports are great for finding out where you stand in 
regard to your customer invoices. You can list unpaid invoices and group them in 
various ways, including by customer, job, and aging status.
Sales
These reports show what you sold and who your customers are. You can see your 
sales by item, customer, or sales representative.
Jobs, Time & Mileage
These reports let you see job and item profitability, compare job estimates with 
actual costs, view time recorded on jobs and activities, and look at vehicle mileage.
Vendors & Payables
These accounts payable reports tell you everything you need to know about your 
unpaid bills. You can list bills in a variety of ways, including by vendor and by aging 
status. This category also includes a report for determining sales tax liability.
Purchases
If you enable the Items and Purchases option within QuickBooks when you run 
QuickBooks Setup, these reports show from whom you bought, what you bought, 
and how much you paid. You can list purchases by item or by vendor. One handy 
report shows any outstanding purchase orders.

CHAPTER 15  Reporting on the State of Affairs      263
If you’re not sure which specific report you want, you can use the Report Center. 
Just choose Reports ➪ Report Center and then choose a report category in the list 
along the left edge of the Report Center window (see Figure 15-1). QuickBooks 
displays a picture of the most common reports within the category in the Report 
Center window.
Report Category
Description
Inventory
These reports help answer the ever-important question “What items do I have in 
stock?” You can get an enormous amount of detail from these reports, such as how 
many units of an item you have on hand and how many units you have on order. 
You can group inventory by vendor or item. If you need price lists, you can print 
them by using a special report from your QuickBooks file.
Employees & Payroll
These reports, available if you signed up for one of the QuickBooks payroll options, 
offer ways to track payroll or check your payroll liability accounts. Believe me: These 
reports come in handy.
Banking
These reports list checks and deposits.
Accountant & Taxes
These reports include income tax reports, journal and general ledger reports, and a 
trial balance.
Budgets & Forecasts
These reports show you once and for all whether your budgeting skills are realistic. 
You can view budgets by job, month, or balance sheet account. Then you can 
compare the budgets with actual income and expense totals. (You need to have a 
budget already set up to use this report — something I discuss in Chapter 12.)
List
These reports let you see your lists in detail. You can see the contacts, phone 
numbers, and addresses on your Customer, Vendor, or Other Names lists, for 
example. You also can create a detailed report of your inventory.
Industry Specific
Some versions of QuickBooks also supply industry-specific reports under the 
Industry Specific submenu command. At this writing, QuickBooks comes in industry-
specific versions for accountants, contractors, manufacturers, wholesalers, 
professional service firms, retailers, and not-for-profit organizations.
Contributed Reports
QuickBooks provides a Contributed Reports menu command that enables you to 
display web pages of custom QuickBooks report templates that Intuit and outside 
parties (accounting firms, small businesses, and so on) have developed and then 
“contributed.”
Custom
QuickBooks allows you to create customized summary reports and transaction 
listings. You create these reports by choosing either the Summary or Transaction 
Detail command from the Custom Reports submenu.

264      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
Creating and Printing a Report
After you decide what report you need, all you have to do is select it from the 
appropriate menu or from the Report Center window. To create a standard profit 
and loss report, for example, choose Reports ➪ Company & Financial ➪ Profit & 
Loss Standard; select it in the Report Center; or double-click the report image in 
the Report Center window.
Depending on how much data QuickBooks has to process, you may see a Building 
Report box before the report appears onscreen in all its glory. Figure 15-2 shows a 
standard profit and loss report, or an income statement.
If you see a Customize Report dialog box instead of a report, you can tell Quick-
Books to change this option. To do so, choose Edit ➪ Preferences and then click the 
Reports & Graphs icon in the list on the left. Click the My Preferences tab, if you 
have one and if it isn’t already selected. Remove the check mark from the Prompt 
Me to Modify Report Options Before Opening a Report check box.
You can’t see the entire onscreen version of a report unless your report is very 
small (or your screen is monstrously large). Use the Page Up and Page Down keys 
on your keyboard to scroll up and down, and use the Tab and Shift+Tab keys to 
move left and right. If you’re a mouse lover, you can use the scroll bar instead.

Center window.

CHAPTER 15  Reporting on the State of Affairs      265
To print a report, click the Print button at the top of the report, and choose Report 
from the drop-down menu that appears. QuickBooks displays the Print Reports 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-3. To accept the given specifications, which are 
almost always fine, click the Print button. You’ll never guess what happens next: 
QuickBooks prints the report!

Print Reports 
dialog box.

266      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
The first time you print a report, QuickBooks displays a Printing Features dialog 
box that explains a few things about the mechanics of choosing and printing 
reports.
Before I forget, I want to tell you that you can select the File radio button in the 
Print To panel to tell QuickBooks to save the report as a file instead of printing it. 
You can then choose the file format: ASCII Text File, Comma Delimited File, or Tab 
Delimited File. You can use either delimited-file format if you want to open the 
file later with a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel. After you click 
Print, use the Create Disk File dialog box that appears to specify the filename and 
storage location.
Both the File menu and the report window’s Print button’s submenu provide a 
Save As PDF command, which you can use to create a PDF version of the report 
that appears in the report menu. Just choose the command and provide a name for 
the PDF when QuickBooks prompts you.
The Orientation settings tell QuickBooks how the report is supposed to appear  
on the paper. The Page Range settings specify the pages that you want to print. 
The Fit Report to xx Page(s) Wide and Fit Report to xx Page(s) High check boxes 
enable you to shrink the report so that it fits on the number of pages you specify. 
The purpose of the Print in Color (Color Printers Only) check box is pretty 
self-evident.
QuickBooks includes two page-break options for creating easier-to-read reports:
»
» Select the first check box (Smart Page Breaks) to keep items that belong in the 
same group on the same page.
»
» Select the second check box to give each major group its own page.
You can preview the report by clicking the Preview button.
Visiting the report dog-and-pony show
You can do some neat things with the reports you create. Here’s a quick rundown 
of some of the most valuable tricks:
»
» QuickZooming mysterious figures: If you don’t understand where a number 
in a report comes from, point to it with the mouse. As you point to numbers, 
QuickBooks changes the mouse pointer to a magnifying glass marked with a 
Z. Double-click the mouse to have QuickBooks display a list of all the transac-
tions that make up that number.

CHAPTER 15  Reporting on the State of Affairs      267
This feature, called QuickZoom, is extremely handy for understanding the 
figures that appear in reports. All you have to do is double-click any 
­mysterious-looking figure in a report. QuickBooks immediately tells you 
exactly how it arrived at that figure.
»
» Sharing report data with Microsoft Excel: You can export report data to an 
Excel spreadsheet by clicking the Excel button in the report window. When 
QuickBooks displays its menu, choose the Create New Worksheet or Update 
Existing Worksheet command. (QuickBooks displays the Send Report to Excel 
dialog box, which you can use to exercise additional control of how the report 
gets sent to Microsoft Excel.)
Editing and rearranging reports
You may have noticed that when QuickBooks displays the report document win-
dow, it also displays a row of buttons: Customize Report, Comment on Report, 
Share Template, Memorize, Print, E-Mail, Excel, and so on (refer to Figure 15-2). 
Below this toolbar are some drop-down lists that have to do with dates, a drop-
down list called Columns, and a drop-down list called Sort By. (Not all these lists 
are available in every report document window. I don’t know why, really. Maybe 
just to keep you guessing.)
You don’t need to worry about these buttons and lists. Read the discussion that 
follows only if you’re feeling comfortable, relaxed, and truly mellow, okay?
Modifying
When you click the Customize Report button, QuickBooks displays the Modify 
Report dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-4. From this dialog box, you can change 
the information displayed in a report and the way in which that information is 
arranged (the Display tab); the data used to generate the report (the Filters tab); 
the header and footer information (predictably, the Header/Footer tab); and the 
typeface and size of print used for a report (the Fonts & Numbers tab).
Commenting on a report
You can annotate a report with comments in QuickBooks 2015 and later. To do 
this, click the Comment on Report button. When QuickBooks displays the Com-
ments panel at the bottom of the report window (see Figure 15-5), click the button 
next to the reported-on value you want to comment on and then click in the Com-
ments panel to type your remarks. To save your comments, click the Save button 
in the Comments panel. To save your report and all the comments you added, click 
the Save button in the top-left corner of the report window. To access these saved 

268      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
reports later, choose Reports ➪ Commented Reports. Note that you can also print 
and email an annotated report using the Print and E-Mail buttons, which appear 
in the top-left corner of the report window.

window with the

The Display tab of 
the Modify Report 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 15  Reporting on the State of Affairs      269
Sharing templates
If you work in a multiple-user QuickBooks environment, and you create a cus-
tomized report, you can share this report with other users. To do this, click the 
Share Template button. When QuickBooks displays the Share Template dialog box 
(not shown), name and describe the shared report by using the Report Title and 
Description text boxes. Then click the Share button.
Memorizing
If you do play around with the remaining buttons, you can save any custom report 
specifications that you create. Just click the Memorize button. QuickBooks dis-
plays the Memorize Report dialog box (not shown), which just asks you to supply 
a name for the customized report and assign the memorized report to a report 
group. After you name and assign the customized report, QuickBooks lists it 
whenever you choose Reports ➪ Memorized Reports and then click the report 
group. You can also access Memorized Reports from the top of the Report Center 
screen. Whenever you want to use your special report, all you need to do is choose 
it from the list and click the Report button.
QuickBooks memorizes the print orientation with the report, so if the print orien-
tation isn’t the way you want it for the report, you should change it first by choos-
ing File ➪ Printer Setup. Select the orientation you want to memorize, click OK, 
and then memorize the report.
Emailing
If you click the E-Mail button, QuickBooks displays a drop-down list of com-
mands that lets you email either an Excel workbook or a PDF version of the report 
to someone else. When you choose one of the commands that says you want to 
email a report, what QuickBooks does depends on whether it sees that you have an 
email program already set up and installed. If QuickBooks doesn’t see any such 
program, it displays the Edit E-Mail Information dialog box. If QuickBooks does 
see such a program, it starts the email program and adds the report to a new mes-
sage as an attachment.
Exporting
If you click the Excel button and select Create New Worksheet from the drop-
down menu, QuickBooks displays the Send Report to Excel dialog box (see 
­Figure 15-6). You can use this dialog box to create an Excel report that holds the 
same information as shown in the report. Select the Create New Worksheet radio 
button to create a new Excel workbook with the report information and the Update 
an Existing Worksheet radio button to add the report to an existing Excel work-
book (which you will need to identify when prompted).

270      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
You can also get fancy by exporting a comma-separated-values (CSV) file (these 
files can be opened by other electronic spreadsheet programs and by database 
programs) to a specific Excel workbook file, and by clicking the Advanced button 
to display another dialog box that lets you control how the exported information 
is formatted.
A friendly suggestion, perhaps? Feel free to experiment with all the special export-
ing options. Just remember that after you export a QuickBooks report to a new, 
blank Excel workbook, you can also do any of this fancy-dancey stuff — special 
formatting and so on — there.
The other buttons and boxes
If you want to see how the Hide Header, Collapse, and Dates stuff works, just 
noodle around. You can’t hurt anything.
If you change the report dates, click the Refresh button to update the report. To set 
refresh options for reports, choose Edit ➪ Preferences. Then click the Reports & 
Graphs icon in the list on the left and click the My Preferences tab if necessary. 
Click one of the Reports and Graphs options and then click OK.
Reports Made to Order
If you intend to print a large number of reports — and, more important, if you 
intend to print a large number of reports and show them to customers, investors, 
and other significant people — you want your reports to look good and to be easy 
to understand. I believe that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so I’m not going 
FIGURE 15-6: 
The Send  
Report to Excel 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 15  Reporting on the State of Affairs      271
to get into the aesthetics of report layouts. What I am going to do is explain how 
you can make QuickBooks reports look exactly the way you want them to look.
Choose Edit ➪ Preferences. Click the Reports & Graphs icon in the list on the left 
and then click the Company Preferences tab to see the Preferences dialog box for 
reports and graphs (see Figure 15-7).
You need to be logged in to single-user mode as the administrator to change com-
pany preferences. Read how in Appendix C.
Here are your options:
»
» Accrual: Accrual is one of those cruel accounting terms that can be hard to 
understand at first. If you select the Accrual radio button in the Summary 
Reports Basis panel, you tell QuickBooks to include all your transactions, sales, 
purchases, expenses, and so on from the moment they’re recorded, not from 
the time you receive or pay cash for them.
Accountants follow the accrual method because it provides a more accurate 
picture of profits. Also, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) says that big 
corporations must use accrual accounting for their tax returns.
»
» Cash: If you select the Cash radio button, all the financial transactions in your 
reports are counted at the time you make your expense payments and you 
receive your customers’ payments.
»
» Age from Due Date: If you select the Age from Due Date radio button in the 
Aging Reports panel, QuickBooks counts your expenses and invoices from the 
FIGURE 15-7: 
The Preferences 
dialog box for 
reports and 
graphs.

272      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
day that they fall due. Otherwise, QuickBooks counts them from the day 
they’re recorded.
»
» Reports – Show Items By/Show Accounts By: You select a radio button in 
the Reports – Show Items By or Show Accounts By group to indicate how you 
want QuickBooks to arrange account information on your reports: by name, 
description, or both name and description.
»
» Statement of Cash Flows: You click the Classify Cash button to tell 
QuickBooks how it should handle its accounts when it produces a picture-
perfect statement of cash flows using generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples. A suggestion? Leave this for your CPA.
»
» Format: Clear the Default Formatting for Reports check box and then click the 
Format button if you want to improve the look of your reports. In the Report 
Format Preferences dialog box that appears, as shown in Figure 15-8, you can 
use the Header/Footer tab to choose preferences for displaying the company 
name, the report title, the subtitle, and so on.
You can use the Fonts & Numbers tab of the Report Format Preferences dialog box 
to choose preferences for displaying numbers, decimal fractions, and negative 
numbers. You also can fool around with different fonts and point sizes for labels, 
column headings, titles, and other things in your reports.
Click the Revert button in the Report Format Preferences dialog box to undo your 
customization changes.
FIGURE 15-8: 
The Report

ences dialog box.

CHAPTER 15  Reporting on the State of Affairs      273
Processing Multiple Reports
Want to print several reports at once? No problem. Choose Reports ➪ Process Mul-
tiple Reports. When QuickBooks displays the Process Multiple Reports dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 15-9, select the reports that you want to print or display.
Your Other Reporting Options
Some versions of QuickBooks present you with a handful of additional Reports 
menu commands. These additional commands are especially numerous in the 
Enterprise Solutions version of QuickBooks. I’m going to touch on some of these 
commands just ever so briefly:
»
» Custom Reports: Displays commands that you can use to create reports from 
scratch, following your specific instructions. These custom reports are pretty 
easy to use if you’ve noodled around much with the customization options I 
mention earlier in the chapter.
»
» Company Snapshot: Displays a window with a bunch of little graphs and 
tables that summarize various tidbits of financial data: trends in income and 
expense, big account balances, open invoices, and so forth.
»
» QuickBooks Statement Writer: Starts the QuickBooks Statement Writer 
(formerly the Intuit Statement Writer) add-on program that creates financial 
statements in Microsoft Excel. QuickBooks Statement Writer comes with the 
Accountant and Enterprise Solutions versions of QuickBooks.
FIGURE 15-9:

Multiple Reports 
dialog box.

274      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
»
» Combine Reports from Multiple Companies: Enables you to create a 
consolidated report using data from more than one QuickBooks company file. 
When you choose the command, QuickBooks displays a dialog box that you 
use to identify the company files and the report combination you want. This 
command is available only in QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions.
Last but Not Least: The QuickReport
The QuickReport is one of the best kinds of reports, so I saved it for last. You can 
generate a QuickReport from a list, from invoices and bills with names of people 
or items on them, and from account registers. QuickReports are especially useful 
when you’re studying a list and see something that momentarily baffles you. 
­Simply make sure that the item you’re curious about is highlighted, click the 
Reports button, and then choose the QuickReports command for the item from the 
drop-down list.
You can also right-click an item and choose QuickReport from the shortcut menu 
to create a QuickReport of the item.
Figure 15-10 shows a QuickReport produced from a register. I clicked the Quick-
Report button to display this Register QuickReport window with the transaction 
information for a vendor: Great Globs of Clay LLC.
The QuickReport option is also on the Reports menu when you have a register or 
list open. In that case, you can display a QuickReport from a form — even though 
no QuickReport button appears — by choosing the menu option. If you’re writing 
a check to a vendor, for example, you can enter the company’s name on the check 
and choose Reports ➪ QuickReport to see a report of transactions involving the 
company.

Job Estimating, 
Billing, and Tracking
Q
uickBooks Pro, QuickBooks Premier, and QuickBooks Enterprise Solutions 
have a feature that’s very interesting for businesspeople — such as con-
tractors, consultants, engineers, and architects — who do jobs or projects 
for their customers. These flavors of QuickBooks have the capability to do simple 
project or job costing. This capability means that your business can create project 
or job estimates; track revenue, costs, and profits by project or job; and bill 
invoices by project or job.
In this short chapter, I describe the QuickBooks job costing feature.
Turning On Job Costing
To turn on the job costing or estimating feature in QuickBooks, choose 
Edit ➪ ­Preferences. Click the Jobs & Estimates icon on the left; click the Company 
Preferences tab (as shown in Figure 16-1); and then use the Do You Create Esti-
mates? and Do You Do Progress Invoicing? radio buttons to tell QuickBooks 
whether, in fact, you want to do these things. You get this, right? You select Yes if 
you do and No if you don’t.
Chapter 16

276      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
Note: Progress invoicing (or progress billing) refers to the practice of billing or invoic-
ing a client or customer as work on a project progresses. In other words, rather 
than invoice at the very end of a project, you might bill half the agreed-upon 
amount when work is roughly half done. Then you might bill the remaining half 
of the agreed-upon amount when the work is finally finished.
While you’re looking at the Company Preferences tab (Figure 16-1), let me also 
mention that as the figure shows, QuickBooks lets you categorize jobs as falling 
into five different status categories: Pending, Awarded, In Progress, Closed, and 
Not Awarded. As you might guess, you use these job-status descriptions to cate-
gorize your jobs.
Setting Up a Job
If you want to use QuickBooks job costing, your first step is to set up a job.  
Suppose that you’re a contractor. You can use QuickBooks to track the invoices 
and costs of the remodeling jobs you do. You just need to set up a job every time 
you get ready to bid on a project.
To set up a job, first set up a customer in the usual way; then set up a job, also in 
the usual way. In Chapter 3, I describe how you do all of this, so I don’t repeat that 
information here. Just to save you time, however, all you need to do is choose 
Customers ➪ Customer Center to display the Customer Center window, right-click 
the customer for whom you might do a job, and then choose Add Job from the 
Customer:Job pop-up menu. When QuickBooks displays the New Job window, 
describe the job by filling out the fields in the window that QuickBooks displays.
FIGURE 16-1: 
The Company 
Preferences tab 
showing job and 
estimate options.

CHAPTER 16  Job Estimating, Billing, and Tracking      277
Creating a Job Estimate
In QuickBooks, job costing starts with an estimate. An estimate is just a list of the 
estimated costs you’ll incur for some job you’ll perform for some customer.
It’s a bit of a stretch for the example Pine Lake Porcelain business used in the 
pages of this book, but what if a new customer asked you to set up a little gift  
shop with merchandising displays of a bunch of coffee and tea mugs? In a sense, 
you wouldn’t just be selling inventory, but doing a job or project: setting up a  
gift shop.
Assuming that you already created a job and told QuickBooks that you use esti-
mates, here are the steps that you follow to create an estimate:
1.	 Choose Customers ➪ Create Estimates.
QuickBooks opens a Create Estimates window (see Figure 16-2), which bears 
an uncanny resemblance to the Create Invoices window that you’ve seen if 
you’ve worked with QuickBooks at all. (See Chapter 4 for more information 
about the Create Invoices window.)
FIGURE 16-2: 
The Create 
Estimates 
window.

278      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
2.	 Start filling in the blanks.
Choose the appropriate Customer:Job from the drop-down list at the top of the 
form. QuickBooks automatically fills in as much information as it can — usually 
at least the Name/Address text box. In Figure 16-2 (and this is hard to see, I 
grant you), the job is Castle Rock Coffee House, which includes 1,000 units each 
of the red, blue, and yellow mugs from our very own Pine Lake Porcelain.
If you configured QuickBooks to track classes (described in Chapter 3), the 
appropriate drop-down list shows up in the top center of the form. Go ahead 
and use the box, if appropriate.
Feel free to change the default settings, such as Date and Estimate #, by using 
the date-setting tricks you can find in Chapter 4 and on the online Cheat Sheet. 
(See this book’s Introduction for details on how to access the online Cheat 
Sheet.)
3.	 Add the line items — details, details, details.
You fill in the details of a Create Estimates window in the same way that you fill 
in the details of a Create Invoices window. Read Chapter 4 if you have questions.
One field that’s unique to the Create Estimates window is Markup. The Markup 
field, which appears on some versions of the Create Estimates window, adds  
a specified percentage of the line item price total. Refer to Figure 16-2, in 
between the subtotal and the WSST tax of 10%. Although I opted to not mark 
up this order, you do have the option to mark up the estimates by a set 
amount (enter 100 or $100 to add that amount to the estimate) or by a 
percentage (100% would double the entire cost). The Mark up field doesn’t 
appear in all versions of the Estimates template — only the Custom Estimate 
and Proposal templates.
In Chapter 3, I describe how to add items to the QuickBooks Items list. Each line 
item that you want to include in your job estimate needs to be described in the 
Items list. Note that because you often sell work to clients and customers by 
using, in part, an estimate, you typically want to include full descriptions of the 
items. (My construction-contractor clients, for example, often use several lines 
of descriptive text to fully explain each item that shows up in the estimate.)
4.	 (Optional) Add any optional information.
Use any of the other boxes available in the Create Estimates window to collect 
and store additional information. Just as you can in the Create Invoices 
window, you can click the Customer Message drop-down list and choose or 
write a friendly message.
You can also use the Memo field to write a note to yourself regarding the job, 
or maybe add some notes about the screenplay that you’ve been thinking 
about pitching to the studios — whatever suits your fancy.

CHAPTER 16  Job Estimating, Billing, and Tracking      279
If you want to include other items in the Create Estimates window, you can 
customize that window. Click the Formatting tab to show the Formatting 
ribbon and then click the Customize Data Layout button. QuickBooks displays 
a dialog box (not shown) that you can use to control which bits of information 
appear on the estimate.
In Chapter 4, I talk a bit about how to customize invoice forms. You may want to 
look there if you have questions about how to customize the Create Invoices form.
Before you print that estimate, remember that information in the Create Esti-
mates window isn’t the same information that appears in the written estimate. To 
see how the printed version looks, click the down arrow below the Print button in 
the Create Estimates window, and choose Preview from the drop-down list. The 
result is a full-page image, shrunk to fit onscreen.
If you haven’t saved your estimate yet, go ahead and click either the Save & New 
button or the Save & Close button.
To examine the estimate (or any onscreen QuickBooks form) more closely, click 
the Zoom In button at the top of the Print Preview screen or move the mouse cur-
sor over the image. When the cursor looks like a magnifying glass with a plus (+) 
sign in it, click the left mouse button. Because you can see only part of the preview 
this way, use the scroll bars at the bottom and right of the windows to move 
around to the different areas.
Note that the magnifying glass now has a minus (–) sign in it, and the Zoom In 
button toggles to Zoom Out. If you complete more than one estimate, you can use 
the Prev Page and Next Page buttons in the Print Preview screen to look at other 
estimates. When you finish, click the Close button.
When you get back to the Create Estimates window, click the Print button; Quick-
Books Pro displays the Print One Estimate dialog box. Click Print to print the 
estimate without any further ado.
If you haven’t used QuickBooks to print estimates before, you may need to set up 
your printer for this task first. To do so, choose File ➪ Printer Setup and then 
choose Estimate from the Form Name drop-down list. Specify the printer settings 
that you want for printing estimates. (This process works the same way as it does 
for printing other forms, such as invoices, as I describe in Chapter 4.) Click OK 
when you’re done. The Print One Estimate dialog box that QuickBooks displays 
after you click Print in the Create Estimates window also works the same way as 
the Print One Invoice dialog box does. Read Chapter 4 if you need help with this 
dialog box.

280      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
Revising an Estimate
To revise an estimate, display the Create Estimates window, as described earlier in 
this chapter. Then click the Previous button until you see the estimate.
Make your changes, and QuickBooks recalculates all the totals. Smile. Imagine 
doing this task by hand — the recalculations, the looking up of prices, the retyp-
ing, the inordinate amount of wasted time. Making these changes automatically 
with QuickBooks doesn’t quite beat a hot dog with sauerkraut in the park on a 
sunny day, but it’s pretty close.
When you revise an estimate, QuickBooks asks whether you want to treat the revi-
sion as a change order that appears on the estimate. If you indicate “Yes, that 
sounds like a solid idea,” QuickBooks adds detail to the estimate to clearly flag and 
describe whatever bits of the estimate you changed: items, quantities, prices, and 
so forth.
You can keep only one estimate per job. After you click Save & New, any changes 
that you make automatically take the place of the old estimate. If you make 
changes in an estimate, though, you can tell QuickBooks to treat the revision as a 
change order. With a change order, the modifications to an existing estimate get 
added to the bottom of the estimate. Cool, right?
Turning an Estimate into an Invoice
You can easily turn the estimate into an invoice by following these steps:
1.	 On the Customer Center screen, select your customer.
QuickBooks shows you a list of transactions for the customer, including any 
active estimates.
2.	 Double-click the estimate you want to work with.
The Create Estimates window opens. (Refer to Figure 16-2.)
3.	 Click the Create Invoice button at the top of the window.
If you indicated that you might progress-bill a customer or client, QuickBooks 
displays a dialog box that asks whether you want to invoice the entire estimate 
or just some portion of the estimate. Answer the question by selecting the 
appropriate option button; then click OK. QuickBooks creates an invoice based 
on your estimate (see Figure 16-3). If you need to make any changes, edit the 
invoice directly and then click OK to continue.

CHAPTER 16  Job Estimating, Billing, and Tracking      281
If you don’t see the Create button at the top of your Create Estimates window, 
maximize the window so that it fills the QuickBooks program window. 
Increasing the window size should solve the problem. By the way, you can also 
click the arrow at the right edge of the Create button to display the things you 
can create: invoices, sales orders, purchase orders, and letters.
4.	 (Optional) Make any necessary changes to the resulting invoice.
The invoice that you see is a regular QuickBooks invoice, and you can edit it the 
same way that you edit any invoice. Until you click Save & New, the invoice isn’t 
recorded in your records.
5.	 After you make all your changes, click Save & New or Save & Close to 
record the invoice.
If you want to print the invoice instead, you can click the Print button.
Comparing Estimated Item Amounts  
with Actual Item Amounts
In the previous paragraphs, I describe how you can take an estimate and create an 
invoice by using that estimate as a starting point. I also say that you can edit the 
FIGURE 16-3: 
The Create 
Invoices window 
with the data 
from Figure 16-2.

282      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
numbers that come off the estimate. Now, here’s an interesting job-costing point: 
QuickBooks prints reports, like the one in Figure 16-4, that let you compare the 
item estimates shown in the original estimates with the actual billed items shown 
in invoices.
To produce such a report, choose Report Center ➪ Jobs, Time & Mileage ➪ Item 
Estimates vs. Actuals. QuickBooks displays a report that lets you compare esti-
mated amounts with invoiced amounts. If you bid jobs by using estimates but 
must invoice with actual numbers, such a report is a great way to see how good a 
job you’re doing in your estimating.
Charging for Actual Time and Costs
If you charge a customer for actual costs and hours, you need to track the costs 
and time when you incur the charges for them. You assign the cost to the job by 
entering the customer and job information in the Customer:Job column that’s 
shown in the window used to record a particular cost or time charge. If you use the 
Enter Bills window (see Chapter 6) to record a bill for a particular job, you use the 
Customer:Job column to designate the job.
FIGURE 16-4: 
An Item Estimates 
vs. Actuals report.

CHAPTER 16  Job Estimating, Billing, and Tracking      283
To charge a customer for costs or time that you recorded, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Customers ➪ Create Invoices to open the Create Invoices window.
2.	 Change the name in the Customer:Job drop-down list to the proper 
customer.
This step is easy: Activate the drop-down list, and choose the appropriate 
customer and job. If you assigned time or costs to this customer, a screen pops 
up, asking you to click the Time/Costs button to include the charges in your 
invoice.
3.	 Click the Add Time/Costs button.
QuickBooks displays the Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box. The dialog 
box already shows the costs and time charges that you assigned to this 
customer and job combination.
4.	 Select the billable time and costs that you want to add to the invoice.
Check the time charges and costs that you want to bill for. Note that the 
Choose Billable Time and Costs dialog box provides different tabs for Items, 
Expenses, and Mileage.
5.	 (Optional, Expenses only) Indicate the markup.
The Expenses tab has a couple extra fields at the top of the tab to indicate the 
Markup Amount or % and the Markup Account. If applicable, fill in the fields 
with the appropriate information.
6.	 (Optional) Indicate whether you want the charges to appear as a single 
item on the invoice.
If you want to avoid listing the gory details of the charges to your customer, 
select the Print Selected Time and Costs As One Invoice Item check box located 
in the bottom-left corner of the invoice. Also, note that you can select the 
Taxable box to indicate if selected expenses are taxable.
7.	 Click OK.
After you have everything the way you want it, click OK. As if by magic — even if it 
was by your hard work and the sweat of your own brow — the invoice appears.
8.	 (Optional) Add anything else you want to include on the invoice.
This invoice is a regular QuickBooks invoice, remember? You may want to click 
the down arrow beside the Print button and choose Preview from the drop-
down list to make sure that only the job costs that you want to appear do 
appear.
9.	 Click Save & New or Save & Close.
That’s how you record the invoice.

284      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
After you record the invoice, the job costs that have been billed are removed from 
the Choose Billable Time and Costs window. You’re finished. Breathe easier.
You can also track the amount of time that you or other employees spend on clients 
or customers. To turn on time-tracking, choose Edit ➪ Preferences, scroll down to 
and click the Time & Expenses icon, and then select the Do You Track Time? option 
button on the Company Preferences tab. After you do this, you can track the time 
that you spend on a client or customer by choosing Customers ➪ Enter Time ➪ Use 
Weekly Timesheet or Customers ➪ Enter Time ➪ Time/Enter Single Activity. Either 
command displays an easy-to-understand window that lets you record time spent 
on a particular client or customer.
Here’s an important final point: The time-tracker clock keeps ticking as long as 
the QuickBooks program runs. The program doesn’t need to be the active Win-
dows program to continue working. I mention this because in some older versions 
of QuickBooks, the timer stops if you start working with another program, such as 
your word processor or email program.
Tracking Job Costs
To see the costs assigned or allocated to a project, use the Job, Time & Mileage 
Reports, which are available when you choose Reports ➪ Jobs, Time & Mileage. You 
can experiment with the different reports to see which provides the information 
in a format and at a level of detail that works best for you. If you’re invoicing cus-
tomers by job and collecting cost data by customer and job, you can produce great 
job-profitability reports that show what you’ve made by job. Also note that you 
can budget amounts by customer and job, using the same budgeting technique 
described in Chapter 12. If you do the extra work of budgeting by customer job,  
you can also compare actual job revenue and costs with budgeted job revenue  
and costs.

File Management Tips
O
kay, you don’t need to worry about the data files that QuickBooks stores 
your financial information in. Pretty much, QuickBooks does all the dirty 
work. That said, you do have a few housekeeping tasks to take care of.  
In this chapter, I describe these chores and how to do them correctly with mini-
mum hassle.
Backing Up Is (Not That) Hard to Do
Sure, I can give you some tricky, technical examples of fancy backup strategies, 
but they have no point here. You want to know the basics, right?
The guiding rule is that you back up any time you work on something that you 
wouldn’t want to redo. Some people think that a week’s worth of work is negli-
gible; others think that a month’s worth of work is negligible.
Here’s what I do to back up my files. I back up every week after I enter my data for 
the week. Then I stick the disc (you might use any removable disc, such as a USB 
Chapter 17

286      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
flash drive or a writable CD) in my briefcase so that if something terrible happens 
(like a meteor hitting my office building), I don’t lose both my computer and the 
backup disc with the data. (I carry my briefcase around with me  — a sort of  
middle-age security blanket — so that it won’t get destroyed in some after-hours 
disaster.)
Sounds like a pretty good system, huh? Actually, I admit that my strategy has its 
problems:
»
» Because I back up weekly, I might have to re-enter as much as a week’s worth 
of data if the computer crashes toward the end of the week. In my case, 
I wouldn’t lose all that much work. But if you’re someone with heavy transac-
tion volumes — if you prepare hundreds of invoices or write hundreds of 
checks each week, for example — you probably want to back up more 
frequently, perhaps every day.
»
» A second problem with my strategy is only remotely possible but still worth 
mentioning: If something bad happens to the QuickBooks files stored on my 
computer’s hard drive as well as the files stored on the backup flash drive, 
CD-R, CD-RW, or some other removable data-storage device, I’ll be up the 
proverbial creek without a paddle. (I should also note that a removable disc is 
far more likely to fail than a hard drive and is easier to lose.) If this worst-case 
scenario actually occurs, I’ll need to start over from scratch from the beginning 
of the year.
Some people, who are religiously careful, circulate three sets of backup discs to 
reduce the chance of this mishap. They also regularly move one copy offsite, such 
as to a safe deposit box. In this scenario, whenever you back up your data, you 
overwrite the oldest set of backup discs.
Say you back up your data every week, and your hard drive not only crashes, but 
also bursts into a ball of flames rising high into the night. To restore your files, 
you use the most recent set of backups — one week old, max. If something is 
wrong with those, you use the next–most-recent set — two weeks old. If some-
thing is wrong with those, you use the last set — three weeks old. This way, you 
have three chances to get a set that works — a nice bit of security for the cost of a 
few extra discs or storage devices.
Two final comments related to backup strategies and tactics:
»
» QuickBooks supplies an online backup tool (which I talk about later) that you 
can also use to reduce the risks of losing your data because you lose your 
backup copy. If you’re really concerned about data safety, and you have an 
extra $100 to $200 a year, you may want to regularly (daily?) use the 

CHAPTER 17  File Management Tips      287
QuickBooks online backup service. For more on this feature, see the sidebar 
“Backing up files online” later in this chapter.
»
» You may be able to combine your backup of your QuickBooks data with your 
other backup method. This might be another manual option in which you 
copy files to a removable storage device like the one I use. Or you might be 
able to employ another online backup system such as Carbonite (https://
www.carbonite.com), which uses an automatic system for securing all your 
data.
Backing up the quick-and-dirty way
You’re busy. You don’t have time to fool around. You just want to do a passable job 
of backing up, and you’ve decided how often you plan to do it. Sound like your 
situation? Then follow these steps:
1.	 Insert a blank disc into the appropriate drive or connect a USB storage 
device.
You can back up to any removable disc, including flash memory devices, 
portable hard disks, and writable CDs. Note, however, that Intuit (the maker of 
QuickBooks) recommends that you not use the QuickBooks backup command 
to move a backup file onto a CD. Instead, it recommends that you back up the 
file to your hard drive and then use the Windows file-copy command to burn 
the file onto the disc. This work-around approach tends to solve some of the 
CD-writing problems that people experience when backing up directly to a CD 
from QuickBooks.
Heck, I should admit that you can back up to any fixed disk, such as your hard 
drive or a network disk, but the advantage of a removable disc is that you can 
store it in some other location. As a compromise, you can also use a network 
disk. You typically don’t want to use your hard drive (although this is better 
than nothing) because one of the disasters that might befall your QuickBooks 
data is a hard drive failure.
You can also back up your QuickBooks files to an online storage area. See the 
sidebar “Backing up files online” for more information.
2.	 If you store data for more than one company, make sure that the 
company whose data you want to back up is the active company.
Yes, I know that all your companies are active; I’m hoping they’re not dead in 
the water. My point is that you want to back up the correct company. To find 
out whether the correct company is active, just look at the QuickBooks 
application window title bar, which names the active company. (If you don’t 

288      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
remember setting up multiple files, don’t worry. You probably have only one 
file — the usual case.)
If you use QuickBooks in multiuser mode, you need to switch to single-user 
mode before you back up your file. To do this, choose File ➪ Switch to Single-
User Mode.
3.	 Choose File ➪ Backup Company ➪ Create Local Backup to begin the 
backup operation.
QuickBooks displays the Create Backup dialog box (see Figure 17-1).
4.	 Tell QuickBooks where you want to back up the QuickBooks data file.
When QuickBooks displays the Create Backup dialog box — the one shown in 
Figure 17-1 — specify the location for the backup by selecting the Online 
Backup or Local Backup radio button.
To back up your QuickBooks file locally — this is my recommendation for new 
QuickBooks users, but do see the upcoming sidebar “Backing up files online” — 
select the Local Backup option.
5.	 Describe how QuickBooks should back up your data file.
With the first Create Backup dialog box still displayed, click the Options button. 
QuickBooks displays the Backup Options dialog box (see Figure 17-2), from 
which you specify how and when QuickBooks backs up your data file:
•	 Pick a default location. Specify where the backup file should be located. You 
can do this either by entering the pathname of the backup folder in the Tell 
Us Where to Save Your Backup Copies box (the hard way) or by clicking the 
Browse button and then using the Browse for Folder dialog box that 
Windows displays to pick a default backup location.
FIGURE 17-1: 
The Create 
Backup  
dialog box.

CHAPTER 17  File Management Tips      289
•	 Fine-tune the backup operation. The Backup Options dialog box provides a 
few check boxes that you can use to fine-tune the old QuickBooks backup 
operation. The check box titled Add the Date and Time of Backup to the File 
Name, if selected, does just what it says. The check box titled Limit the 
Number of Backup Copies in This Folder To [X] tells QuickBooks to limit the 
number of backup copies of your QuickBooks file it stores in the backup 
folder. The default number of backup copies kept on hand is three; that 
should be fine.
•	 Specify the backup reminder rule. You can select the check box titled 
Remind Me to Back Up When I Close My Company File Every [X] Times 
to tell QuickBooks to remind you every so often to back up. By default, 
QuickBooks reminds you every fourth time you close a data file, but you 
can replace the value in the text box to specify some other backup-
reminder frequency.
•	 Select a data verification option. QuickBooks provides three data verification 
options: Complete Verification (safe but slow), Quicker Verification (fast but 
not as thorough), and No Verification (saves you a bit of time now at the 
risk of huge problems later). The Complete Verification option is what 
QuickBooks and I both recommend.
When you finish with the Backup Options dialog box, click OK and then Next. 
QuickBooks displays the second Create Backup dialog box (see Figure 17-3).
6.	 Determine when QuickBooks should back up your data file.
The second Backup Wizard dialog box provides option buttons that you use to 
schedule when you want to back up. To indicate that you want to back up on 
the spot, select the Save It Now radio button.
FIGURE 17-2: 
The Backup 
Options  
dialog box.

290      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
Note: The very, and I mean the very, first time you back up your QuickBooks file 
using the Create Backup command, QuickBooks doesn’t ask you when it 
should back up your data file. It just backs up the data file, skipping this step.
7.	 Confirm the backup file location and name.
With the second Backup Wizard dialog box displayed (refer to Figure 17-3), click 
Next. QuickBooks displays the Save Backup Copy dialog box (see Figure 17-4). If 
you successfully completed Step 5, you’ve already specified the appropriate 
folder location for the backup file. Just to be on the safe side, confirm that 
the filename and folder location shown in the Save Backup Copy dialog box 
are correct. If the folder location isn’t correct, select a new folder location from 
the Save In drop-down list. If the filename isn’t correct, edit the name shown in 
the File Name text box.

The second 
Create Backup 
dialog box.
FIGURE 17-4: 
The Save Backup 
Copy dialog box.

CHAPTER 17  File Management Tips      291
8.	 Click Save.
QuickBooks backs up your data file and displays a message box telling you that 
it has backed up your file. The message also gives the backup filename and 
folder location.
Getting back the QuickBooks  
data you backed up
What happens if you lose all your QuickBooks data? First of all, I encourage you to 
feel smug. Get a cup of coffee. Lean back in your chair. Gloat for a couple of min-
utes. You, my friend, have no problem. You followed instructions.
Okay, you may have one or two problems, but you can probably blame PC gremlins 
for those. If the disaster that caused you to lose your data also trashed other parts 
of your computer, you may need to reinstall QuickBooks. You also may need to 
reinstall all your other software.
BACKING UP FILES ONLINE
You can quickly and easily back up your data online. If you do so, you no longer need 
to remember to make backups and take them offsite. To find out more about online 
backup, choose File ➪ Create Backup and then click the Learn More about QuickBooks 
Online Backup link.
The Online Backup service is a pretty darn good idea if you have a fast Internet connec-
tion, but the service costs a little bit of money. Depending on the level of service, you 
pay at least between $100 and $200 per year, but you can set up the service so that 
QuickBooks automatically backs up your data and even other important files on a regu-
lar basis. I think this is pretty cool.
Two final points about using the QuickBooks online backup option:
•	 Just for the record, I don’t think you need to worry about security. (You can read 
more about the security measures on the QuickBooks website, but your data is as 
secure online as it is in your office.)
•	 I think most folks should use the service. I’ve experimented quite a bit with this 
service, and online offsite backup at the prices that Intuit offers seems like a really 
excellent deal for any business in which the QuickBooks data files are important.

292      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
After you gloat sufficiently (and piece your computer back together again, if it  
was the cause of the disaster), carefully do the following to reinstate your Quick-
Books data:
1.	 Get your backup files.
Find the backup you created, and load it into the appropriate drive (for a disc) 
or USB port (for a thumb drive or external source). If you’re working with an 
external disk, do anything special you need to do to access that device, such as 
turn on the external disk’s power.
2.	 Start QuickBooks and choose File ➪ Open or Restore Company.
QuickBooks displays the Open or Restore Company dialog box (see Figure 17-5).
3.	 Indicate that you want to restore a backup copy of your QuickBooks data 
file; then click Next.
How you do this is probably obvious, right? Select the Restore a Backup Copy 
radio button.
4.	 Tell QuickBooks whether you backed up locally or online; then click Next.
QuickBooks displays the Open or Restore Company dialog box (not shown).
5.	 Select the Local Backup option button to indicate that you made a local 
backup, and then click Next.
6.	 Identify the backup file that you want to use; then click Open.
QuickBooks displays the Open Backup Copy dialog box (see Figure 17-6). If you 
know the company filename and location, you can enter this information in the 
boxes provided. If you don’t know this information, use the Look In drop-down 
list to identify the drive that contains the file you want to back up. Then choose 
the backup file you want to restore and click Open. QuickBooks displays the 
Open or Restore Company dialog box (not shown), telling you that the next 
step (where you specify the restoration location) is pretty darn important.
FIGURE 17-5: 
The Open or 
Restore Company 
dialog box.

CHAPTER 17  File Management Tips      293
7.	 Specify where the restored file will be located; then click Next again.
QuickBooks displays the Save Company File As dialog box (see Figure 17-7). 
Use the File Name text box and Save In drop-down list here to identify the file 
you want to replace.
If you know the company filename and location, you can enter this information 
in the text boxes provided. If you don’t know this information, use the Save In 
drop-down list to make sure that you place the restored file in the correct 
folder on the correct drive.
8.	 Click Save.
If the file you’re trying to restore already exists, you see a message box telling 
you so.
FIGURE 17-6: 
The Open Backup 
Copy dialog box.
FIGURE 17-7: 
The Save 
Company File As 
dialog box.

294      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
9.	 Click Yes to overwrite and replace the file with the one stored on the 
backup disc, or click No to keep the original copy.
QuickBooks may ask you for your password to verify that you have administra-
tive permission to restore the file. Then, if everything goes okay, you see a 
message box that says so. Breathe a deep sigh of relief, and give thanks.
Oops. I almost forgot:
»
» When you restore a file, you replace the current version of the file with the 
backup version stored on the backup medium. Don’t restore a file for fun. 
Restore a file only if the current version is trashed and you want to start over 
by using the version stored on the backup disc.
»
» You need to re-enter everything you entered since you made the backup 
copy. I know. You’re bummed out. With luck, it hasn’t been all that long since 
you backed up.
Accountant’s Copy
While I’m on the subject of the housecleaning stuff that you can do with your 
QuickBooks files, I’ll mention the Accountant’s Copy feature.
Let me start by saying that I don’t really like this feature. In my experience — and 
my firm serves hundreds of small businesses using QuickBooks — the Accountant’s 
Copy doesn’t work that well in practice. But you may want to try it anyway.
An Accountant’s Copy allows your accountant to make adjustments in a special 
copy of your QuickBooks data file while you continue to enter your daily transac-
tions in the master file. When your accountant returns the updated file, you can 
merge the changes back into the master file.
To use the Accountant’s Copy feature, choose File ➪ Create Copy. Select the 
Accountant’s Copy option and then follow the onscreen instructions. You can 
import the accountant’s changes later. If you need help with this feature, talk to 
your accountant.
You should never upgrade to a newer version of QuickBooks while your accountant 
is still working with the Accountant’s Copy. At least, you shouldn’t do this if you 
plan on using the accountant’s changes. If an active Accountant’s Copy is in use, 
your screen will state that fact at the very top, next to the company name.

CHAPTER 17  File Management Tips      295
Working with Portable Files
QuickBooks includes a portable-files feature. A portable file is a smaller, condensed 
version of the QuickBooks data file. The portable file is small enough, in fact, that 
you can probably email it to your accountant, your sister in Portland, or me.
To create a portable file, choose File ➪ Create Copy. When QuickBooks displays the 
first Save Copy or Backup dialog box, select the Portable Company File option but-
ton, click Next, and then follow the onscreen instructions. The process, by the 
way, resembles the backup process described earlier in this chapter. I find it really 
easy to save the file on the desktop. Then you can attach it easily to your email and 
send it out. After the other party receives the file, you can just drag your copy to 
the Recycle Bin. Your real file remains intact. (A portable file typically must be 
10MB or smaller for transmission through most email services.)
To open a portable file, a person (this could be your accountant, your sister in 
Portland, or me) should choose File ➪ Open or Restore Company. When Quick-
Books displays the Open or Restore Company dialog box (refer to Figure 17-5), this 
other person just specifies the file that she wants to open as a portable file and 
then follows the onscreen instructions.
Using an Audit Trail
For some curious reason, in the post–Bernie Madoff world of accounting, people 
are much more interested in the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature. In fact, some 
readers of past editions of this book have tracked me down as though I were a 
wounded animal so that they could ask about audit trails in QuickBooks. Because 
of this renewed interest, let me share the three things you need to know about 
using the QuickBooks Audit Trail feature:
»
» An audit trail is simply a list of changes. The QuickBooks Audit Trail — which is 
a simple report that lists the changes to the QuickBooks data file — lets you 
see who changed what.
»
» You can’t turn off the Audit Trail feature in recent versions of QuickBooks. 
Accordingly, every change you make (or that someone else in your office 
makes) in QuickBooks is recorded.
»
» You can print the Audit Trail report by choosing Reports ➪ Accountant & 
Taxes ➪ Audit Trail.

Using a Closing Password
QuickBooks doesn’t require you to or even let you “close” months and years, the 
way old manual accounting systems did. (When you “closed” an old accounting 
period, you actually zeroed-out the revenue and expense accounts and transferred 
the net amount to the owner’s equity accounts.)
QuickBooks does let you use a closing date and password, however. The closing 
date sort of prevents someone from entering transactions earlier than the speci-
fied date. If you set a closing password, for example, someone needs to supply that 
password before entering a transaction or changing a transaction dated before the 
closing date. If you don’t set a closing password, someone trying to enter or 
change a transaction dated before the closing date is warned, but that person can 
still create or change the entry.
To set a closing date, choose Edit ➪ Preferences, click the Accounting icon, click the 
Company Preferences tab, and then click the Set Date/Password button so that 
QuickBooks displays the Set Closing Date and Password dialog box (see Figure 17-8). 
You enter the closing date (probably the end of the most recently completed year) in 
the Closing Date text box and then enter the password (twice): in the Closing Date 
Password text box and in the Confirm Password text box. Note: Select the check box 
titled Exclude Estimates, Sales Orders and Purchase Orders from Closing Date 
Restrictions so you don’t lose access to these transactions as part of the closing.
Don’t set a closing date and password on a QuickBooks file you want to send to 
your accountant so he or she can prepare your tax return. Your tax accountant will 
probably need to make changes in your QuickBooks file to sync things between 
your records and your tax return. You want to “lock” the preceding year only after 
your tax return is complete.

Tracking vehicle mileage
Fixed Assets and 
Vehicle Lists
I
n this chapter, I cover two specialty topics of modest interest to a small handful 
of business owners: how the QuickBooks Fixed Asset list works and how the 
QuickBooks vehicle mileage–tracking tool works.
Let me say at the outset that you may not need these tools. QuickBooks users com-
monly think the tools do more than they really do. In some situations, though, 
business owners and accountants truly do find these two simple tools helpful.
But you know what? I’m getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the start.
What Is Fixed-Assets Accounting?
So that you understand where the Fixed Asset list and vehicle mileage tracker fit 
into the scheme of things, let me begin by defining the term fixed assets and by 
explaining just what fixed-assets accounting is.
Fixed assets historically refers to assets that are fixed in place. A factory or building 
set into concrete is fixed. Likewise, a 20-ton piece of machinery bolted into the 
floor is fixed.
Chapter 18

298      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
In the context of QuickBooks and its Fixed Asset list, fixed assets also include 
items such as furniture, equipment, and vehicles — things that aren’t so “fixed” 
but instead are assets that last a long time — that a business, therefore, must 
depreciate.
Now that you know what fixed assets are — at least according to Steve Nelson — 
let me define fixed-assets accounting. Fixed-assets accounting, I’m going to say, 
refers to three accounting tasks:
»
» Tracking your fixed assets’ costs, descriptions, and other relevant information 
so that you can take proper care of your stuff
»
» Calculating and recording fixed assets’ depreciation so that tax returns and 
financial statements can be prepared
»
» Calculating and recording the effect, including the gain or loss stemming from 
the disposal of fixed assets so that tax returns and financial statements can be 
prepared
Obviously, this fixed-assets accounting stuff is important. Having said that, let 
me throw you a curveball: I’m not sure whether you need to worry about this stuff.
Now, of course, you do indeed want to keep track of fixed assets so that you know 
what you own. This stuff-you-own information is pretty essential for thinking 
smartly about how much insurance you should purchase, for example. You may 
also pay property taxes on this stuff, which is another good reason to really know 
what you have.
Ditto for your need to be able to depreciate your fixed assets and to keep track of what 
happens when you sell a fixed asset. Shoot, you don’t have to be in business for more 
than about a year before you know that tax laws and generally accepted accounting 
principles say that you have to do this, regardless of whether you want to.
But here’s my lazy-boy thinking. You know your accountant? The person who 
does your taxes is already keeping such a list to calculate the correct amount of 
depreciation that you should enter in your income tax returns. This makes me 
wonder why you need to maintain a duplicate list.
To me, you need to do the fixed-assets accounting yourself in only two situations:
»
» You have so much stuff that your poor accountant needs or would 
benefit from help in tracking the stuff. This will be the case if you have 
hundreds or thousands of items.
»
» You don’t use an accountant. You, therefore, are the poor sap who has to 
do this fixed-assets accounting work.

CHAPTER 18  Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists      299
Be cautious here. Perhaps a quick telephone call to your accountant can confirm 
that your fixed-assets accounting is already being performed. Another way to 
check is to look carefully at last year’s tax return. Do you see, buried somewhere 
near the back of the return, a listing of your fixed assets? If so, skip this chapter. 
Check it out, though, to make sure.
I hope that most readers can just quit their reading at this point. Most readers now 
realize that their accountants are almost certainly already doing their fixed-assets 
accounting work. Most readers, in fact, will realize that they really don’t need to 
worry about noodling around with the QuickBooks Fixed Asset list at all!
If you realize that you need to handle the fixed-assets accounting yourself, keep 
reading.
Fixed-Assets Accounting in QuickBooks
Fixed-assets accounting amounts to three things:
»
» Keeping a list of the assets that you own
»
» Recording depreciation on any depreciable assets
»
» Recording the disposal of an asset, including any gain or loss on disposal
The Fixed Asset list, which I describe in the next section, takes care of the first 
task. The Fixed Asset list doesn’t help you directly with the second or third tasks 
shown in the preceding list, though. You need to understand this important point: 
You still need to calculate and then enter asset depreciation. And when you dispose 
of an asset, you still need to construct a journal entry that records the disposition.
Chapter 19 describes how depreciation works and how you go about recording the 
disposal of an asset. Read that chapter if you want to know how that stuff works.
Setting Up a Fixed Asset List
As noted earlier in the chapter, if your business owns a lot of stuff with long-
lasting value, either you or your accountant needs to keep track of the items. If you 
need to track the items, you can do so by using the Fixed Asset list.

Adding items to the Fixed Asset list
To add a piece of furniture, some bit of equipment or machinery, or another item 
of long-lived value to the Fixed Asset list, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Lists ➪ Fixed Asset Item List to display the Fixed Asset list.
QuickBooks displays the Fixed Asset Item List window, as shown in Figure 18-1. 
Initially, because you haven’t yet added any assets, the list shows no assets.
Have assets you’ve purchased already? You can edit the original purchase 
transaction and add the fixed asset to the list during editing.
2.	 Tell QuickBooks that you want to add an item to the Fixed Asset list.
Click the Item button (lower left) and then choose New from the menu that 
QuickBooks displays. QuickBooks displays the New Item window, as shown in 
Figure 18-2.
3.	 Name the asset.
Give the asset a unique name. You might give a piece of furniture a name like 
Leather couch, a computer a name like HP Pavilion, and a vehicle a name like  
’12 Chevy S20 Pickup.
FIGURE 18-1: 
The Fixed Asset 
Item List window.

CHAPTER 18  Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists      301
4.	 Select the appropriate fixed-asset account.
From the Asset Account drop-down list, select the fixed-asset account in which 
the asset you’re describing should be placed. A leather couch used in your 
opulent reception area, for example, might be placed in a furniture and 
equipment fixed-asset account. A delivery truck might be placed in a vehicles 
fixed-asset account.
QuickBooks, as you might guess, supplies a bunch of accounts automatically, 
but you may not see the account you need or want in the Asset Account 
drop-down list. You can add a new asset account on the fly, so to speak, by 
entering a new account name and pressing Enter. When QuickBooks sees that 
the fixed-asset account isn’t yet set up, it prompts you to set up the new 
fixed-asset account.
5.	 Describe the purchase terms.
Use the Purchase Information area to describe the item that you purchased and 
the purchase terms. You want to indicate whether the item is new or used, for 
example, by selecting the New or Used radio button. You can provide a purchase 
description, purchase date, purchase cost, and even identify the vendor by using 
the other, self-explanatory boxes in the Purchase Information area.
FIGURE 18-2: 
The New Item 
window.

302      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
6.	 (Optional) Describe the asset in further detail.
The Asset Information area at the bottom of the New Item window provides 
additional text boxes that you can use to describe the asset. The area provides 
a humongous field in which to place a lengthy asset description, for example. 
You also have fields you can use to identify the asset location, the original 
purchase order (PO) number, the asset’s serial number, and the warranty 
expiration date. If these fields aren’t adequate, heck, QuickBooks even supplies 
a Notes area that you can use to write a small ode to your asset or record 
some other bit of relevant asset information.
7.	 Save the asset item description.
Click OK to simultaneously save the new asset item description and close the 
New Item window. Or click Next to save the new asset item description but 
leave the New Item window displayed.
Adding fixed-asset items on the fly
You can add items to the Fixed Asset list, as described in the preceding para-
graphs. Alternatively, you can add an item to the Fixed Asset list when you record 
the bill that records the vendor invoice for the asset or when you record the check 
that pays the vendor invoice for the asset.
Here’s how this works: If you told QuickBooks that you want to maintain a Fixed 
Asset list, QuickBooks prompts you to add a fixed-asset item when you categorize, 
or debit, a fixed-asset account while entering a bill or recording a check.
To collect the information required to set up the fixed-asset item, QuickBooks 
displays the same New Item window (refer to Figure 18-2). The steps that I pro-
vide in the preceding section for filling in the New Item window also work for 
adding fixed-asset items on the fly.
Editing items in the Fixed Asset list
To edit a fixed-asset item (say you made a mistake entering some bit of informa-
tion), follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Lists ➪ Fixed Asset Item List.
QuickBooks displays the Fixed Asset Item List window. (Refer to Figure 18-1.)
2.	 Double-click the item that you want to edit.
QuickBooks displays the Edit Item window, as shown in Figure 18-3.

CHAPTER 18  Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists      303
3.	 Update the asset description.
As necessary, update the information shown in the Purchase Information and 
the Asset Information areas. Note, too, that if you want to record the disposal 
of an asset, you can select the Item Is Sold check box. Then QuickBooks 
enables the Sales Information area’s text boxes. You can use these to identify 
the sales date, price, and amount of selling expenses.
QuickBooks doesn’t do any bookkeeping with the purchase and/or sales informa-
tion shown in the New Item and Edit Item windows. It doesn’t add an asset to the 
balance sheet because you set up a fixed-asset item, for example. And QuickBooks 
won’t calculate the gain or loss on disposition of the asset because you enter sales 
information. You need to do that yourself — or have your accountant do that — by 
using either standard QuickBooks transactions or traditional journal entries.
Read Chapter 6 for information on how to record a bill that stems from a vendor 
invoice, and see Chapter 8 for information on how to record a check that pays for 
some asset. Peruse Chapter 19 for instructions on how to record depreciation and 
how to record asset dispositions.

Tracking Vehicle Mileage
QuickBooks supplies a business-vehicle mileage tracker that you can use to track 
and tally business mileage. As you may already know, you need to know both your 
total miles and your business miles to accurately deduct vehicle expenses on your 
tax return. (If you’re not sure how this works, confer with your tax adviser.)
Identifying your vehicles
By law, you’re required to track your mileage by vehicle. QuickBooks, accordingly, 
provides a Vehicle list. To add items to the Vehicle list, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Lists ➪ Customer & Vendor Profile Lists ➪ Vehicle List.
QuickBooks displays the Vehicle List window, as shown in Figure 18-4. Initially, 
because you haven’t yet added any vehicles, the list shows no assets.
2.	 Click the Vehicle button (bottom-left corner), and choose New from the 
menu that QuickBooks displays.
QuickBooks displays the New Vehicle window, as shown in Figure 18-5.
FIGURE 18-4: 
The Vehicle List 
window.

CHAPTER 18  Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists      305
3.	 Enter a name for the vehicle in the Vehicle text box, and enter a descrip-
tion of the vehicle in the Description text box.
Identify the vehicle by its make and maybe the year of manufacture. I suppose 
that if you have a fleet of cars or trucks, you may want to provide more 
identifying information than this.
4.	 Save the vehicle description by clicking OK.
Recording vehicle miles
After you add your business vehicles to the Vehicle list, you record each trip by 
using the Enter Vehicle Mileage window. To do this, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose Company ➪ Enter Vehicle Mileage.
QuickBooks displays the Enter Vehicle Mileage window, as shown in Figure 18-6.
2.	 From the Vehicle drop-down list, select the vehicle in which you took the trip.
3.	 Provide the starting and ending dates of the trip.
Enter the starting date of the trip in the Trip Start Date field and the ending 
date of the trip in the Trip End Date field. Note that you can click the little 
calendar button at the right ends of these two text boxes to display the 
QuickBooks pop-up calendar.
FIGURE 18-5: 
The New Vehicle 
window.

306      PART 4  Housekeeping Chores
4.	 Enter the starting mileage of the odometer in the Odometer Start field 
and the ending mileage of the odometer in the Odometer End field.
After you enter the two mileage readings, QuickBooks calculates the total trip 
miles.
5.	 (Optional) Identify the customer and job.
If the trip’s miles should be billed to or associated with a particular customer or 
job, select the customer or job from the Customer:Job drop-down list. For more  
information about how invoicing works, refer to Chapter 4.
6.	 (Optional) Associate the trip miles with a particular invoice item.
If you bill the trip miles on an item, select the invoice item that should be used 
from the Item drop-down list. For more information about how invoice items 
work, refer to Chapter 4.
7.	 Provide additional information as necessary.
Use the Notes text box to collect or store any additional information needed 
for the vehicle mileage record-keeping.
8.	 Save the trip information by clicking the Save & Close button.
FIGURE 18-6: 
The Enter Vehicle 
Mileage window.

CHAPTER 18  Fixed Assets and Vehicle Lists      307
Using the vehicle reports
If you click the Reports button at the bottom of the Vehicle List window (refer to 
Figure 18-4), QuickBooks displays a menu that lists four vehicle mileage reports: 
Mileage by Vehicle Summary, Mileage by Vehicle Detail, Mileage by Job Summary, 
and Mileage by Job Detail.
You can access another menu of commands that produce these same reports by 
clicking the Mileage Reports button that appears at the top of the Enter Vehicle 
Mileage window (refer to Figure 18-6).
To produce a particular vehicle mileage report, choose one of the reports from 
either of these menus.
Updating vehicle mileage rates
If you click the Mileage Rates button at the top of the Enter Vehicle Mileage window 
(refer to Figure  18-6), QuickBooks displays the Mileage Rates dialog box (see 
­Figure  18-7). The Mileage Rates dialog box lists Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
mileage rates and their effective dates. You can enter a new mileage rate by clicking 
the next open row of the mileage rate schedule and then entering the effective date 
in the Effective Date column and the standard rate in the Rate column. You can find 
the current year’s business mileage rate at the IRS website at www.irs.gov.
Note: In 2016 (when I was writing this book), the standard mileage rate equaled 
54 cents a mile, but the IRS usually updates this figure once and sometimes twice 
a year. So you want to check for the rate that’s current when you do your calcula-
tions. In other words, don’t use one of the old, out-of-date standard mileage rates 
shown here. Please.

A
s your business grows and becomes more complex, your accounting does, 
too. I can’t describe and discuss all the complexities you’ll encounter, but 
I can give you some tips on handling (just about) ten tricky situations.
In QuickBooks, you make journal entries by using the General Journal Entry  
window, which you get to by choosing Company ➪ Make Journal Entries. If you 
don’t understand double-entry bookkeeping but want to, take a gander at 
Appendix B.
Tracking Depreciation
To track the depreciation of an asset that you’ve already purchased (and added to 
the Chart of Accounts), you need two new accounts: a Fixed Asset type of account 
called something like Accumulated Depreciation and an Expense type of account 
called something like Depreciation Expense.
Chapter 19

312      PART 5  The Part of Tens
If you have a large number of assets, keeping track of the accumulated deprecia-
tion associated with specific assets is a good idea. You can do this either outside 
QuickBooks (such as in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or with your tax return) or 
inside QuickBooks (by using individual accounts for each asset’s original cost and 
accumulated depreciation).
After you set up these two accounts, you can record the asset depreciation with a 
journal entry such as the following one, which records $500 of depreciation 
expense:
Debit
Credit
Depreciation expense
$500
Accumulated depreciation
$500
In recent years, federal tax laws have provided three simplifying tricks for han-
dling fixed assets and fixed assets depreciation — an explicit $2,500 capitalization 
limit amount, bonus depreciation, and Section 179 depreciation — that together enable 
you to immediately write off or depreciate the entire cost or most of the cost of 
many assets. These tricks are big breaks for small businesses. The explicit capital-
ization limit, for example, which comes from new tangible property regulations 
that the IRS issued in late 2015, says you can immediately deduct as supplies 
expense anything that costs less than $2,500. (Just to be extreme, if you purchase 
ten $2,400 tablet computers, you could write off this purchase as $24,000 of  
supplies expense.) Section 179 depreciation lets you immediately expense, or write 
off, up to $500,000 of fixed assets as long as you use the assets more than 
50 ­percent for your business and as long as you have profits. For 2016, 2017, 2018, 
and 2019, bonus depreciation lets you (after taking into account Section  179 
depreciation) immediately expense or write off 50 percent of whatever is left.
In any case, these immediate-expensing and -depreciation loopholes can save 
you tons on taxes. They also mean that you may be able to simplify your fixed 
assets accounting too by simply calling many of the low-value items you tracked 
in the past for tax purposes “supplies expenses.”
Selling an Asset
When you sell an asset, you need to back out (get rid of) the asset’s account bal-
ance, record the cash (or whatever) that somebody pays you for the asset,  
and record any difference between what you sell the asset for and its value as a 
gain or loss.

CHAPTER 19  Tips for Handling (Almost) Ten Tricky Situations      313
If you purchase a piece of land for $5,000 but later resell it for $4,000, for exam-
ple, you use the following journal entry to record the sale of this asset:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$4,000
Loss
$1,000
Asset
$5,000
You may need to set up another income account for the gain or another expense 
account for the loss. Read Chapter 2 for information on setting up new accounts.
Selling a Depreciable Asset
Selling a depreciable asset works almost identically to selling an asset that you 
haven’t been depreciating. When you sell the asset, you need to back out the 
asset’s account balance. You also need to back out the asset’s accumulated depre-
ciation (which is the only thing that’s different from selling an asset that you 
haven’t been depreciating). You need to record the cash (or whatever) that some-
body pays you for the asset. Finally, you count as a gain or a loss any difference 
between what you sell the asset for and what its net-of-accumulated-­depreciation 
(or book value) is.
This process sounds terribly complicated, but an example helps. Suppose that you 
purchased a $5,000 piece of machinery and have accumulated $500 of deprecia-
tion thus far. Consequently, the asset account shows a $5,000 debit balance, and 
the asset’s accumulated depreciation account shows a $500 credit balance. Sup-
pose also that you sell the machinery for $4,750 in cash.
To record the sale of this depreciable asset, you’d use the following journal  
entry:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$4,750
Accumulated depreciation
$500
Asset
$5,000
Gain
$250

314      PART 5  The Part of Tens
As I note earlier in the chapter, if you have a bunch of assets, you probably want 
to set up individual accounts for each asset’s original cost and its accumulated 
depreciation. The individual accounts make it much easier to make the journal 
entry shown in the preceding paragraph. Also, be sure to record the amount of 
that asset’s depreciation for the year of the sale before you make the entry for the 
sale itself.
Owner’s Equity in a Sole Proprietorship
Actually, tracking owner’s equity in a sole proprietorship is easy. You can use the 
single account that QuickBooks sets up for you, called Opening Bal Equity, to track 
what you’ve invested in the business. (You may want to rename this account 
something like Contributed Capital.)
To track the money you withdraw from the business, you can set up and use a new 
owner’s equity account called something like Owner’s Draws. Table 19-1 gives an 
example of owner’s equity accounts in a sole proprietorship. Note that the num-
bers inside parentheses are negative values.
Owner’s Equity in a Partnership
To track the equity for each partner in a partnership, you need to create three 
accounts for each partner: one for the partner’s contributed capital, one for the 
partner’s draws, and one for the partner’s share of the distributed income.
Amounts that a partner withdraws, of course, get tracked with the partner’s draws 
account.

CHAPTER 19  Tips for Handling (Almost) Ten Tricky Situations      315
The partner’s share of the partnership’s profits gets allocated to the partner’s 
profit share account. (Your partnership agreement, by the way, should say how 
the partnership income is distributed between the partners.) Table 19-2 gives an 
example of owner’s equity accounts in a partnership.
Owner’s Equity in a Corporation
Yikes! Accounting for the owner’s equity in a corporation can get mighty tricky 
mighty fast. In fact, I don’t mind telling you that college accounting textbooks 
often use several chapters to describe all the ins and outs of corporation owner’s 
equity accounting.
As long as you keep things simple, however, you can probably use three or four 
accounts for your owner’s equity:
»
» A capital stock par value account, for which you get the par value amount 
by multiplying the par value per share by the number of shares issued. The 
par value of the stock is written on the face of the actual stock certificate, and 
it’s stated in the corporate Articles of Incorporation.
»
» A paid-in capital in excess of par value account for the amount investors 
paid for shares of stock in excess of par value. You get this amount by 
multiplying the price paid per share less the par value per share by the 
number of shares issued.
»
» A retained earnings account to track the business profits left invested in the 
business.
»
» A dividends paid account to track the amounts distributed to shareholders 
in the current year.

Multiple-State Accounting
For multiple-state accounting, you typically need to track sales, payroll, and prop-
erty both owned and rented by state. I’m not going to get into too much detail here, 
but you need this level of granularity because state business tax returns require 
you to apportion your taxable income by using state-level sales, payroll, and prop-
erty data. (For more information about this procedure, ask your accountant.)
To track sales, payroll, and property data by state, you can either use classes for each 
state or set up a Chart of Accounts that supplies state-specific income, payroll 
expense, rent expense, and asset accounts. After you set up this Chart of Accounts, 
all you have to do is use the correct state’s class or accounts to record transactions.
If you do business in both Washington and Oregon, for example, you record sales 
in Oregon as Oregon sales and sales in Washington as Washington sales. You’d 
treat other income accounts and all your payroll expense accounts the same way. 
If you use class tracking for sales in different states, you don’t need duplicate 
accounts for each state.
If you’ll do business tax returns for multiple states, confer with your tax adviser. 
What I’ve said here only scratches the surface of the subject. And there are some 
details (quite likely specific to your states of operation) that you want to hear 
about from a local expert.

Getting a Loan
Getting a loan is the hard part. After you get the money, recording it in Quick-
Books is easy. All you do is record a journal entry that increases cash and recog-
nizes the new loan liability. If you get a $5,000 loan, you might record the 
following journal entry:
Debit
Credit
Cash
$5,000
Loan payable
$5,000
You’ll already have a cash account set up, but you may need to set up a new liabil-
ity account to track the loan.
Repaying a Loan
To record loan payments, you need to split each payment between two accounts: 
the interest expense account and the loan payable account.
Suppose that you make $75 monthly payments on a $5,000 loan. Also suppose 
that the lender charges 1 percent interest each month. The following journal entry 
records the first month’s loan payment:
Debit
Credit
Explanation
Interest expense
$50
Calculated as 1% of $5,000
Loan payable
$25
The amount left over and 
applied to principal
Cash
$75
The total payment amount
The next month, of course, the loan balance is slightly less (because you made a 
$25 dent in the loan principal, as shown in the preceding loan payment journal 
entry). The following journal entry records the second month’s loan payment:

Get the lender to provide you an amortization schedule that shows the breakdown 
of each payment into interest expense and loan principal reduction. If this doesn’t 
work, choose Banking ➪ Loan Manager. QuickBooks displays the Loan Manager 
window. If you click the Add a Loan button, QuickBooks collects a bit of informa-
tion about the loan terms and builds an amortization schedule for you. Note, too, 
that you can tell QuickBooks to remind you of upcoming loan payments and even 
to schedule the payments.
You can record loan payments by using either the Write Checks window or the 
Enter Bills window. Just use the Expenses tab to specify the interest expense 
account and the loan liability account.
You can check your loan accounting whenever you get a loan statement from the 
bank. What the bank shows as the ending balance for a particular month should 
match what QuickBooks says is the balance for that month. To correct discrepan-
cies between the loan balance that the bank shows and the loan balance that 
QuickBooks shows, make a general journal entry that adjusts both the interest 
expense and the loan principal at the same time. If the loan balance is too low 
(say, by $8.76), you need to increase the loan balance and decrease the loan inter-
est expense by using the following journal entry:
Debit

Interest expense

Now for the bad news: To use these formulas, you need to feel comfortable with a 
bit of arithmetic. You don’t need to be a serious mathematician or anything, but 
you do need to feel comfortable using percentages and calculators. By the way, you 
can use the standard Windows Calculator (available from within QuickBooks by 
choosing Edit ➪ Use Calculator) to work with these secret formulas.
Even if you’re not particularly fond of (or all that good at) math, I want to encour-
age you to skim this chapter. You can pick up some weird insights into the world 
of finance.
Chapter 20

The First “Most Expensive Money  
You Can Borrow” Formula
Here’s something you may not know: The most expensive money that you can 
borrow is from vendors who offer cash or early-payment discounts that you don’t 
take. Perhaps your friendly office-supply store offers a 2 percent discount if you 
pay cash at the time of purchase instead of paying within the usual 30 days. You 
don’t pay cash, so you pay the full amount (which is 2 percent more than the cash 
amount) 30 days later. In effect, you pay a 2 percent monthly interest charge.  
A 2 percent monthly interest charge works out to a 24 percent annual interest 
charge — and that’s a great deal of money.
Here’s another example that’s only slightly more complicated. Many, many ven-
dors offer a 2 percent discount if you pay within the first 10 days that an invoice is 
due rather than 30 days later. (These payment terms are often described and 
printed at the bottom of the invoice as 2/10, Net 30.)
In this case, you pay 2 percent more by paying 20 days later. (The 20 days later is 
the difference between 10 days and 30 days.) Two percent for 20 days is roughly 
equivalent to 3 percent for 30 days (one month). So a 2 percent, 20-day interest 
charge works out to a 36 percent annual interest charge. Now you’re talking ­serious 
money.
Table 20-1 shows how some common early-payment discounts (including cash 
discounts) translate into annual interest rates. By the way, I’m a bit more precise 
in my calculations for this table, so these numbers vary slightly from (and are 
larger than) those given in the preceding paragraph.
Is it just me, or do those numbers blow you away? The 2 percent for 20 days early-
payment discount that you often see works out (if you do the math precisely) to

CHAPTER 20  (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas      321
more than 37 percent annual interest. Man, that hurts. And if you don’t take a 
5-percent-for-20-days early-payment discount when it’s offered, you’re effec-
tively borrowing money at an annual rate of 96 percent. You didn’t read that last 
number wrong. Yes, a 5-percent-for-20-days early-payment discount works out 
to an annual interest rate of almost 100 percent.
I want to make a couple of additional observations. Turning down a 1 percent dis-
count for paying 30 days early isn’t actually a bad deal in many cases. Refer to 
Table  20-1, which shows that the 1 percent discount for paying 30 days early 
results in 12.29 percent. Sure, that rate is pretty high, but that interest rate is less 
than the interest on many credit cards and some small-business credit lines. If 
you have to borrow money some other way to pay 30 days early, making an early-
payment may not be cost-effective.
The bottom line on all this ranting is that early-payment discounts, if not taken, 
represent one of the truly expensive ways to borrow money. I’m not saying that 
you won’t need to borrow money this way at times. I can guess that your cash flow 
gets pretty tight sometimes (a circumstance that is true in most businesses, as 
you probably know). I am saying, however, that you should never skip taking an 
early-payment discount unless borrowing money at outrageous interest rates 
makes sense.
Oh, yes — the secret formula. To figure out the effective annual interest rate that 
you pay by not taking an early-payment discount, use this formula:
Discount % / (1 – Discount %) × (365 / Number of Days of Early-Payment)
To calculate the effective annual interest rate that you pay by not taking a 2 percent 
discount for paying 20 days early, calculate this formula:
.02 / (1 – .02) × (365 / 20)
Work out the math, and you get 0.3724, which is the same thing as a 37.24 percent 
interest rate. (Note that the discount percents are entered as their equivalent 
­decimal values.)

The Second “Most Expensive Money 
You Can Borrow” Formula
You know that “most expensive money you can borrow” stuff that I talk about in 
the preceding section? The very tragic flip side to that story occurs when you offer 
your customers an early-payment discount, and they take it. In effect, you borrow 
money from your customers at the same outrageous interest rates. If customer Joe 
Schmoe gets a 2 percent early-payment discount for paying 20 days early, you in 
effect pay ol’ Joe roughly 2 percent interest for a 20-day loan. Using the same 
formula I give for the first “most expensive money you can borrow” formula, the 
rate works out to 37.24 percent.
In some industries, customers expect early-payment discounts. You may have to 
offer them, but you should never offer them willingly. You should never offer 
them just for fun. Borrowing money this way is just too expensive. A rate of 
37.24 percent? Yikes!
Let me also offer a rather dour observation. In my experience, any time someone 
offers big early-payment discounts — I’ve seen them as big as 5 percent — he’s 
either stupid or desperate, and probably both.
The “How Do I Break Even?” Formula
I know that you’re not interested in just breaking even. I know that you want to 
make money in your business. But knowing what quantities you need to sell just 
to cover your expenses is often super-helpful. If you own a one-person account-
ing firm (or some other service business), for example, how many hours do you 
need to work to pay your expenses and perhaps pay yourself a small salary? Or if 
you’re a retailer of, say, toys, how many toys do you need to sell to pay your over-
head, rent, and sales clerks?
You see my point, right? Knowing how much revenue you need to generate just to 
stay in the game is essential. Knowing your break-even point enables you to 
establish a benchmark for your performance. (Any time you don’t break even, you 
have a serious problem that you need to resolve quickly to stay in business.) And 
considering break-even points is invaluable when you think about launching new 
businesses or new ventures.

CHAPTER 20  (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas      323
As you ponder any new opportunity and its potential income and expenses, you 
need to know how much income you need to generate just to pay those expenses.
To calculate a break-even point, you need to know three pieces of information: 
your fixed costs (the expenses you have to pay regardless of the business’s revenue 
or income), the revenue that you generate for each sale, and the variable costs that 
you incur in each sale. (These variable costs, which also are called direct expenses, 
aren’t the same thing as the fixed costs.)
»
» Whatever you sell — be it thingamajigs, corporate jets, or hours of consulting 
services — has a price. That price is your revenue per item input.
»
» Most of the time, what you sell has a cost too. If you buy and resell thingama-
jigs, those thingamajigs cost you some amount of money. The total of your 
thingamajigs’ costs varies depending on how many thingamajigs you buy and 
sell, which is why these costs are referred to as variable costs. A couple of 
examples of variable costs include hourly (or contract) labor and shipping. 
Sometimes, however, the variable cost per item is zero. (If you’re a consultant, 
for example, you sell hours of your time, but you may not pay an hourly cost 
just because you consult for an hour.)
»
» Your fixed costs are all those costs that you pay regardless of whether you sell 
your product or service. If you have to pay an employee a salary regardless of 
whether you sell anything, that salary is a fixed cost. Your rent is probably a 
fixed cost. Things like insurance and legal and accounting expenses are 
probably fixed costs too because they don’t vary with fluctuations in your 
revenue.
Fixed costs may change a bit from year to year or bounce around a bit during 
a year, so maybe fixed isn’t a very good adjective. People use the term fixed 
costs, however, to differentiate these costs from variable costs, which are those 
costs that do vary with the number of goods you sell.
Take the book-writing business as an example. Suppose that as you read this 
book, you think, “Man, that guy is having too much fun. Writing about accounting 
programs, working day in and day out with buggy beta software — yeah, that 
would be the life.” So you start writing books.
Further, suppose that for every book you write, you think that you can make 
$5,000, but you’ll probably end up paying about $1,000 per book for such things 
as long-distance telephone charges, overnight-courier charges, and extra hard-
ware and software. Also suppose that you need to pay yourself a salary of $20,000 
per year. (In this scenario, your salary is your only fixed cost because you plan  
to write at home at a small desk in your bedroom.) Table 20-2 shows how the 
situation breaks down.

324      PART 5  The Part of Tens
With these three bits of data, you can easily calculate how many books you need to 
write to break even. Here’s the formula:
Fixed Costs / (Revenue – Variable Costs)
If you plug in the writing-business example data, the formula looks like this:
$20,000 / ($5,000 – $1,000)
Work through the math, and you get 5. So you need to write (and get paid for) 
five books per year to pay the $1,000-per-book variable costs and your $20,000 
salary. Just to prove that I didn’t make up this formula and that it really works, 
Table 20-3 shows how things look if you write five books.
Accountants use parentheses to show negative numbers. That’s why the $5,000 
and the $20,000 in Table 20-3 are in parentheses.
But back to the game. To break even in a book-writing business like the one that 
I describe here, you need to write and sell five books per year. If you don’t think 
that you can write and sell five books in a year, getting into the book-writing 
business makes no sense.

CHAPTER 20  (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas      325
Your business is probably more complicated than book writing, but the same for-
mula and logic for calculating your break-even point apply. You need just three 
pieces of information: the revenue that you receive from the sale of a single item, 
the variable costs of selling (and possibly making) the item, and the fixed costs 
that you pay just to be in business.
QuickBooks doesn’t collect or present information in a way that enables you to 
easily pull the revenue per item and variable costs per item off some report. Nei-
ther does it provide a fixed-costs total on some report. If you understand the logic 
of the preceding discussion, however, you can easily massage the QuickBooks data 
to get the information you need.
The “You Can Grow Too Fast” Formula
Here’s a weird little paradox: One of the easiest ways for a small business to fail is 
by being too successful. I know it sounds crazy, but it’s true. In fact, I’ll even go 
out on a limb and say that small-business success is by far the most common 
reason that I see for small-business failure.
“Oh, geez,” you say. “This nut is talking in circles.”
Let me explain. You need a certain amount of financial horsepower, or net worth, 
to do business. (Your net worth is the difference between your assets and your 
liabilities.) You need to have some cash in the bank to tide you over the rough 
times that everybody has at least occasionally. You probably need to have some 
office furniture and computers so that you can take care of the business end of the 
business. And if you make anything at all, you need to have adequate tools and 
machinery. This part makes sense, right?
How net worth relates to growth
Okay, now on to the next reality. If your business grows and continues to grow, 
you need to increase your financial horsepower, or net worth. A bigger business, 
for example, needs more cash to make it through the tough times than a smaller 
business does — along with more office furniture and computers, and more tools 
and machinery. Oh, sure, you might be able to have one growth spurt because you 
started with more financial horsepower (more net worth) than you needed. But — 
and this is the key part — you can’t sustain business growth without increasing 
your net worth. Now, you may be saying things like “No way, man. That doesn’t 
apply to me.” I assure you, my new friend, that it does.

326      PART 5  The Part of Tens
As long as your creditors will extend you additional credit as you grow your 
business — and they should, as long as the business is profitable and you don’t 
have cash-flow problems — you can grow your business as fast as you can grow 
your net worth. If you can grow your net worth by 5 percent yearly, your business 
can grow at an easily sustained rate of only 5 percent per year. If you can grow 
your net worth by 50 percent yearly, your business can grow at an easily sustained 
rate of only (only?) 50 percent per year.
You grow your business’s net worth in only two ways:
»
» Reinvest profits in the business. Note that any profits that you leave in the 
business instead of drawing them out — such as through dividends or 
draws — are reinvested.
»
» Get people to invest money in the business. If you’re not in a position to 
continually raise money from new investors — and most small businesses 
aren’t — the only practical way to grow is by reinvesting profits in the 
business.
How to calculate sustainable growth
You can calculate the growth rate that your business can sustain by using this 
formula:
Reinvested Profits / Net Worth
I should say, just for the record, that this formula is a very simple sustainable-
growth formula. Even so, it offers some amazingly interesting insights. Perhaps 
you’re a commercial printer doing $500,000 in revenue yearly with a business net 
worth of $100,000; your business earns $50,000 per year, but you leave only 
$10,000 per year in the business. In other words, your reinvested profits are 
$10,000. In this case, your sustainable growth is calculated as follows:
$10,000 / $100,000
Work out the numbers, and you get 0.1, or 10 percent. In other words, you can 
grow your business by 10 percent yearly (as long as you grow the net worth by  
10 percent per year by reinvesting profits). You can easily go from $500,000 to 
$550,000 to $605,000 and continue growing annually at this 10 percent rate, but 
your business can’t grow any faster than 10 percent per year. That is, you’ll get 
into serious trouble if you try to go from $500,000 to $600,000 to $720,000 and 
continue growing at 20 percent per year.

CHAPTER 20  (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas      327
You can convert a decimal value to a percentage by multiplying the value by 100. 
For example, 0.1 × 100 equals 10, so 0.1 equals 10 percent. You can convert a 
­percentage to a decimal value by dividing the value by 100. For example, 25 (as in 
25 percent) divided by 100 equals 0.25.
The sustainable-growth formula inputs are pretty easy to get after you have 
QuickBooks up and running. You can get the net-worth figure off the balance 
sheet. You can calculate the reinvested profits by looking at the net income and 
deducting any amounts that you pulled out of the business.
I’m not going to go through the mathematical proof of why this sustainable-
growth formula is true. My experience is that the formula makes intuitive sense to 
people who think about it for a few minutes. If you aren’t into the intuition thing 
or if you don’t believe me, get a college finance textbook and look up its discussion 
of the sustainable-growth formula. Or do what all the kids today are doing: Search 
online for sustainable-growth formula.
The First “What Happens If . . . ?” Formula
One curiosity about small businesses is that small changes in revenue or income can 
have huge impacts on profits. A retailer who cruises along at $200,000 in revenue 
and struggles to live on $30,000 per year never realizes that boosting the sales vol-
ume by 20 percent to $250,000 might increase profits by 200 percent, to $60,000.
If you take only one point away from this discussion, it should be this curious little 
truth: If fixed costs don’t change, small changes in revenue can produce big 
changes in profits.
The following example shows how this point works and provides a secret formula. 
For starters, say that you currently generate $100,000 yearly in revenue and make 
$20,000 per year in profits. The revenue per item sold is $100, and the variable 
cost per item sold is $35. (In this case, the fixed costs happen to be $45,000 per 
year, but that figure isn’t all that important to the analysis.)
Accountants like to whip up little tables that describe these sorts of things, so 
Table 20-4 gives the current story on your imaginary business.
Table 20-4 shows the current situation. Suppose that you want to know what will 
happen to your profits if revenue increases by 20 percent but your fixed costs 
don’t change. Mere mortals, not knowing what you and I know, might assume 
that a 20 percent increase in revenue would produce an approximate 20 percent 
increase in profits. But you know that small changes in revenue can produce big 
changes in profits, right?

328      PART 5  The Part of Tens
To estimate exactly how a change in revenue affects profits, use the following 
secret formula:
Percentage Change × Revenue × (1 – [Variable Cost per Item / Revenue per Item])
From the sample data provided in Table 20-4 (I’m sorry this example is starting 
to resemble those story problems from eighth-grade math), you make the follow-
ing calculation:
0.20 × $100,000 × (1 – [35 / 100])
Work out the numbers, and you get $13,000. What does this figure mean? It means 
that a 20 percent increase in revenue produces a $13,000 increase in profits. As a 
percentage of profits, this $13,000 increase is 65 percent:
$13,000 / $20,000 = 65 percent
Let me stop here and make a quick observation. In my experience, entrepreneurs 
always seem to think that they need to grow big to make big money. They concen-
trate on doing things that will double or triple or quadruple their sales. Their logic 
isn’t always correct, though. If you can grow your business without having to increase 
your fixed costs, small changes in revenue can produce big changes in profits.
Before I stop talking about this first “What happens if . . . ?” formula, I want to 
quickly describe where you get the inputs you need for the formula:
»
» The percentage-change input is just a number that you pick. If you want to see 
what happens to your profits with a 25 percent increase in sales, for example,  
use 0.25.
»
» The revenue input is your total revenue. You can get it from your profit and 
loss statement. (In Chapter 15, I describe how you can create a profit and loss 
statement in QuickBooks.)
»
» The revenue per item sold and variable costs per item sold figures work the 
same way as I describe for the break-even formula earlier in this chapter.

The Second “What Happens  
If . . . ?” Formula
Maybe I shouldn’t tell you this, but people in finance (like me) usually have a 
prejudice against people in sales. And it’s not just because people who are good at 
sales usually make more money than people who are good at finance. It’s really 
not. Honest to goodness.
Here’s the prejudice: People in finance think that people in sales always want to 
reduce prices.
People in sales see things a bit differently. They say, in effect, “Hey, you worry too 
much. We’ll make up the difference in additional sales volume.” The argument is 
appealing: You just undercut your competitor’s prices by a healthy chunk and 
make less on each sale. But because you sell your stuff so cheaply, your customers 
will beat a path to your door.
Just for the record, I love people who are good at sales. I think that someone who 
is good at sales is more important than someone who is good at finance.
But that painful admission aside, I have to tell you that I see a problem with the 
“Cut the prices; we’ll make it up with volume” strategy. If you cut prices by a 
given percentage — perhaps by 10 percent — you usually need a much bigger 
percentage gain in revenue to break even.
The following example shows what I mean and how this strategy works. Suppose 
that you have a business that sells some doohickey or thingamajig. You generate 
$100,000 yearly in revenue and make $20,000 per year in profits. Your revenue 
per item (or doohickey) sold is $100, and your variable cost per item (or doo-
hickey) sold is $35. Your fixed costs happen to be $45,000 yearly, but again, the 
fixed costs aren’t all that important to the analysis. Table 20-5 summarizes the 
current situation.

Then business is particularly bad for one month. Joe-Bob, your sales guy, comes 
to you and says, “Boss, I have an idea. I think that we can cut prices by 15 percent 
to $85 per doohickey and get a truly massive boost in sales.”
You’re a good boss. You’re a polite boss. Also, you’re intrigued. So you think a bit. 
The idea has a certain appeal. You start wondering how much of an increase in 
sales you need to break even on the price reduction.
You’re probably not surprised to read this, but I have another secret formula that 
can help. You can use the following formula to calculate how many items (doo-
hickeys, in the example) you need to sell just to break even on the new, discounted 
price. Here’s the formula:
(Current Profits + Fixed Costs) / (Revenue per Item – Variable Cost per Item)
From the example data provided earlier, you make the following calculation:
($20,000 + $45,000) / ($85 – $35)
Work out the numbers, and you get 1,300. What does this figure mean? It means 
that just to break even on the $85 doohickey price, Joe-Bob needs to sell 1,300 
doohickeys. Currently, per Table 20-5, Joe-Bob sells 1,000 doohickeys yearly. As a 
percentage, then, this jump from 1,000 doohickeys to 1,300 doohickeys is exactly 
a 30 percent increase. (Remember that Joe-Bob proposes a 15 percent price cut.)
Okay, I don’t know Joe-Bob. He may be a great guy. He may be a wonderful sales-
person. But here’s my guess: Joe-Bob isn’t thinking about a 30 percent increase in 
sales volume. (Remember, with a 15 percent price reduction, you need a 30 percent 
increase just to break even!) And Joe-Bob almost certainly isn’t thinking about a 
50 percent or 75 percent increase in sales volume — which is what you need to 
make money on the whole deal, as shown in Table 20-6.

CHAPTER 20  (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas      331
In summary, you can’t reduce prices by, say, 15 percent and then go for some 
penny-ante increase. You need huge increases in the sales volume to get big 
increases in profits. If you look at Table 20-6, you see that if you can increase the 
sales from 1,000 doohickeys to 1,750 doohickeys — a 75 percent increase — you 
can more than double the profits. This increase assumes that the fixed costs stay 
level, as the table shows.
I want to describe quickly where you get the inputs that you need for the 
formula:
»
» The profit figure can come right off the QuickBooks profit and loss statement.
»
» The fixed costs figure just tallies all your fixed costs. (I talk about fixed costs 
earlier in this chapter in “The ‘How Do I Break Even?’ Formula” section.)
»
» The revenue per item is just the new price that you’re considering.
»
» Finally, the variable cost per item is the cost of the thing you sell. (I discuss this 
cost earlier in the chapter, too.)
Please don’t construe the preceding discussion as proof that you should never lis-
ten to the Joe-Bobs of the world. The “cut prices to increase volume” strategy can 
work wonderfully well. The trick, however, is to increase the sales volume mas-
sively. Sam Walton, the late founder of Walmart, used the strategy and became at 
one point the richest man in the world.
The Economic Order Quantity (Isaac 
Newton) Formula
Isaac Newton invented differential calculus, a fact that’s truly amazing to me.  
I can’t imagine how someone could just figure out calculus. I could never, in a 
hundred years, figure it out. But I’m getting off track.
The neat thing about calculus — besides the fact that I’m not going to do any for 
you here — is that it enables you to create optimal values equations. One of the 
coolest such equations is the economic order quantity, or EOQ, model. I know that 
this stuff all sounds terribly confusing and totally boring, but stay with me for just 
another paragraph. (If you’re not satisfied in another paragraph or so, skip ahead 
to the next secret formula.)

332      PART 5  The Part of Tens
Perhaps you buy and then resell — oh, I don’t know — 2,000 cases of vintage 
French wine every year. The EOQ model enables you to decide whether you should 
order all 2,000 cases at one time, order 1 case at a time, or order some number of 
cases between 1 case and 2,000 cases.
Another way to say the same thing is that the EOQ model enables you to choose 
the best, or optimal, reorder quantity for items that you buy and then resell.
If you’re still with me at this point, I figure that you want to know how this for-
mula works. You need to know just three pieces of data to calculate the optimal 
order quantity: the annual sales volume, the cost of placing an order, and the 
annual cost of holding one unit in inventory. You plug this information into the 
following formula:
(2
Sales Volume
Order Cost) / Annual Holding Cost per Item
You buy and resell 2,000 cases per year, so that amount is the sales volume. Every 
time you place an order for the wine, you need to buy an $800 round-trip ticket to 
Paris (just to sample the inventory) and pay $200 for a couple of nights at a hotel. 
So your cost per order is $1,000. Finally, with insurance, interest on a bank loan, 
and the cost of maintaining your hermetically sealed, temperature-controlled 
wine cellar, the cost of storing a case of wine is about $100 yearly. In this example, 
you can calculate the optimal order quantity as follows:
(
,
$ ,
$
2
2 000
1 000
100
) /
Work through the numbers, and you get 200. Therefore, the order quantity that 
minimizes the total cost of your trips to Paris and of holding your expensive wine 
inventory is 200 cases. You could, of course, make only one trip to Paris per year 
and buy 2,000 cases of wine at once, thereby saving travel money, but you’d spend 
more money on holding your expensive wine inventory than you’d save on travel 
costs. And although you could reduce your wine-inventory carrying costs by going 
to Paris every week and picking up a few cases, your travel costs would go way, 
way up. (Of course, you’d get about a billion frequent-flyer miles yearly.)
You can use the Standard view of the Windows Calculator to compute economic 
order quantities. The trick is to click the √ (square root) key last. To calculate the 
EOQ in the preceding example, you enter the following numbers and operators:
(2 × 2,000 × 1,000) / 100 = sqrt

CHAPTER 20  (Almost) Ten Secret Business Formulas      333
The Rule of 72
The Rule of 72 isn’t exactly a secret formula. It’s more like a general rule. Usually, 
people use this rule to figure out how long it will take for some investment or sav-
ings account to double in value. The Rule of 72 is a cool little trick, however, and 
it has several useful applications for businesspeople.
What the rule says is that if you divide the value 72 by an interest rate percentage, 
your result is approximately the number of years it will take to double your money. 
If you can stick money into some investment that pays 12 percent interest, for 
example, it will take roughly six years to double your money because 72 / 12 = 6.
The Rule of 72 isn’t exact, but it’s usually close enough for government work.  
If you invest $1,000 for 6 years at 12 percent interest, what you really get after  
6 years isn’t $2,000, but $1,973.92.
If you’re in business, you can use the Rule of 72 for a couple of other forecasts, too:
»
» To forecast how long it will take inflation to double the price of an item, 
divide 72 by the inflation rate. If you own a building with a value that you 
figure will at least keep up with inflation, and you wonder how long the 
building will take to double in value if inflation runs at 4 percent, you just 
divide 72 by 4. The result is 18, meaning that it will take roughly 18 years for 
the building to double in value. Again, the Rule of 72 isn’t exactly on the 
money, but it’s dang close. A $100,000 building increases in value to 
$202,581.65 over 18 years if the annual inflation rate is 4 percent.
»
» To forecast how long it will take to double sales volume, divide 72 by the 
given annual growth rate. If you can grow your business by, say, 9 percent 
per year, you’ll roughly double the size of the business in 8 years because  
72 / 9 = 8. (I’m becoming kind of compulsive about this point, I know, but let me 
say again that the rule isn’t exact, but it’s very close. If a $1,000,000-per-year 
business grows 9 percent annually, its sales equal $1,992,562.64 after eight 
years of 9 percent growth. This figure really means that the business will 
generate roughly $2,000,000 of sales in the ninth year.)

APPENDIX A  Installing QuickBooks in 11 Easy Steps      337
Installing 
QuickBooks in 
11 Easy Steps
If you haven’t already installed QuickBooks, get it over with right now:
1.	 Turn on the PC.
Find and flip on the computer’s power switch. Depending on which version of 
Windows you’re using (Windows 7, 8, or 10), your screen may look a little 
different from the figures here. I’m using Windows 10, by the way. (Not that 
you care or that it matters.)
If you’re installing QuickBooks on a computer running a professional or 
business edition of Windows, you may need to log on as either the administra-
tor or a user with administrator rights. In the business flavors of the Windows 
operating systems, Windows security features require an administrator to 
install the QuickBooks program.
2.	 Download the QuickBooks software.
You probably purchased QuickBooks directly from the Intuit website at 
http://quickbooks.intuit.com/products. If so, after you download the 
software, Windows prompts you to run the InstallShield Wizard (another 
program), which starts the QuickBooks installation program.
Alternatively, you may have also purchased the QuickBooks program some-
place like an office-supplies store. In that case, you need to rip open the 
QuickBooks package and get out the CD (which looks exactly like the ones that 
play music). Next, you insert the CD into your CD-ROM drive.
Windows recognizes that you inserted the QuickBooks CD and eventually 
displays a little message box that tells you Welcome to QuickBooks. Click 
Next to really get things started. (You may need to click Next again.)
Appendix A

3.	 Indicate that you accept the QuickBooks licensing agreement and then 
click Next.
After the QuickBooks installation program starts, QuickBooks asks whether you 
agree to play by its rules, as outlined in tedious detail in the licensing agreement 
displayed onscreen. Assuming that you do — and you have to agree to install 
the software — select the I Accept the Terms of the License Agreement (But Only 
Because I Have No Other Choice) button and then click Next.
4.	 Provide the License and Product Numbers and then click Next.
When the License and Product Numbers window appears, enter these two bits 
of licensing information (they should be printed on a yellow sticker on the back 
of the CD sleeve or displayed on the purchase receipt window if you down-
loaded the software) and then click Next.
5.	 Describe any network sharing you plan.
When the Custom and Network Options window appears (see Figure A‑1), 
describe whether you’ll share the QuickBooks data file over a network. Most 
small businesses don’t do this; and if this is your situation, when asked, you 
simply indicate that you’ll use QuickBooks only on the computer on which 
you’re installing the software.
You may have a couple of other options, however, depending on the version of 
QuickBooks you install. You can install QuickBooks on the computer and make 
the QuickBooks data available to other computers on the network. And you 
can actually skip installing the QuickBooks software but store the QuickBooks 
data file on the computer.
FIGURE A-1:

Network Options 
window.

APPENDIX A  Installing QuickBooks in 11 Easy Steps      339
6.	 Select the installation location and then click Next.
When the Upgrade or Change Installation Location window appears (see 
Figure A‑2), click the Next button to use the Intuit default installation location. 
(The default installation location is fine for 999 of 1,000 users.)
You don’t have to choose the suggested installation location. You can instead 
choose to have the QuickBooks program and data files stored in some other 
location. I don’t talk about this option here because most people won’t want to 
(and shouldn’t) make this customization. What’s more, if you’re someone who 
can safely customize the QuickBooks installation location settings, you don’t 
need my help figuring out how this change works.
7.	 Begin the installation.
The installation program tells you, at long last, that it’s ready to begin as soon as 
you click Install. Click Install. The program begins extracting files from the CD.
While the installation program runs, you can see a little bar that shows your 
progress.
If you need to cancel the installation at any time, just click Cancel. QuickBooks 
warns you that the setup is incomplete. That’s okay; just start the setup from 
scratch next time around.
8.	 Register your copy of QuickBooks.
During the installation process, QuickBooks prompts you to register. You do 
this by first entering any Intuit ID you’ve already used and then providing the 
QuickBooks program a bit of information about how you plan to use the 
program. You can skip this a few times, but sooner or later, you’re going to 
have to get ’er done. Nobody likes those reminder pop-up windows. Might as 
well be now.

Change Installa-
tion Location

9.	Take a few minutes or so to contemplate the meaning of life or get a 
drink of water.
10.	When the Install program finishes, click Open QuickBooks.
Congratulations. You’re finished with the installation. You have a new item on 
the Programs menu and probably new shortcuts on your desktop.
11.	(Optional) Celebrate.
Stand up at your desk, click your heels together three times, and repeat the 
phrase “There’s no place like home.” And watch out for flying houses.
As soon as you’re done celebrating, you may want to flip to Chapter 2 and find out 
how to register the program. You’ll probably want to register QuickBooks before 
you begin using it.
If you work on a network and want to share a QuickBooks file stored on one com-
puter with another computer on the network, you need to install QuickBooks on 
all the other computers that you want to use to work with the file. Note: You need 
a separate copy of QuickBooks — such as from the five-pack version — for each 
computer on which you want to install QuickBooks.
By the way — and I mention this just because a couple of clients asked me about 
it  — running QuickBooks on a network with multiple QuickBooks users isn’t 
super-tricky or terribly complicated. QuickBooks takes care of the hard stuff. If 
you have more than one person using QuickBooks, you owe it to yourself (and your 
business) to set up a network and then purchase and install multiple copies of 
QuickBooks. Read Appendix C for more information.

APPENDIX B  If Numbers Are Your Friends      341
If Numbers Are 
Your Friends
Y
ou don’t need to know much about accounting or about double-entry book-
keeping to use QuickBooks, which, as you know, is most of its appeal. If 
you’re serious about this accounting business or serious about your busi-
ness, consider finding out a bit more; setting up QuickBooks and understanding 
all the QuickBooks reports will be easier, and you’ll be more sophisticated in your 
accounting, too.
Just because the accounting in this appendix is a little more complicated doesn’t 
mean that you can’t understand it. To make this whole discussion more concrete, 
I use one running example. I hope it helps you! If nothing else, it’ll inspire you to 
get into the rowboat-rental business.
Keying In on Profit
Start with the big picture. The key purpose of an accounting system is to enable 
you to answer the burning question “Am I making any money?”
Accounting is that simple. Really. At least conceptually. So throughout the rest of 
this appendix, I just talk about how to calculate a business’s profits in a reason-
ably accurate but still practical manner.
Let me introduce you to the new you
You just moved to Montana for the laid-back living and fresh air. You live in a cute 
log cabin on Flathead Lake. To support yourself, you plan to purchase several  
rowboats and rent them to visiting fishermen. Of course, you’ll probably need to 
do quite a bit of fishing, too, but just consider it the price you pay for being your 
own boss.
Appendix B

342      PART 6  Appendixes
The first day in business
It’s your first day in business. About 5 a.m., ol’ Peter Gruntpaw shows up to deliver 
your three rowboats. He made them for you in his barn, but even so, they aren’t 
cheap. He charges $1,500 apiece, so you write him a check for $4,500.
Peter’s timing, as usual, is impeccable. About 5:15 a.m., your first customers 
arrive. Mr. and Mrs. Hamster (pronounced “ohm-stair”) are visiting from  
Phoenix. They want to catch the big fish. You’re a bit unsure of your pricing, but 
you suggest $25 per hour for the boat. They agree and pay $200 in cash for eight 
hours.
A few minutes later, another couple arrives. The Gerbils (pronounced “go-bells”) 
are very agitated. They were supposed to meet the Hamsters and fish together, but 
the Hamsters are rowing farther and farther away from the dock. To speed the 
Gerbilses’ departure, you let them leave without paying, but you’re not worried. 
As the Gerbils leave the dock, Mrs. Gerbil shouts, “We’ll pay you the $200 when 
we get back!”
Although you don’t rent the third boat, you do enjoy a sleepy summer morning.
About 2 p.m., the Hamsters and Gerbils come rowing back into view. Obviously, 
though, a problem has occurred. You find out what it is when the first boat arrives. 
“Gerbil fell into the lake,” laughs Mr. Hamster. “Lost his wallet, too.” Everybody 
else seems to think that the lost wallet is funny. You secretly wonder how you’re 
going to get paid. No wallet, no money.
You ask Mr. Gerbil whether he’ll come out to the lake tomorrow to pay you. He 
says he’ll just write you a check when he gets home to Phoenix. Reluctantly, you 
agree.
Look at your cash flow first
I just described a fairly simple situation. But even so, answering the question “Did 
I make any money?” won’t be easy. You start by looking at your cash flow: You 
wrote a check for $4,500, and you collected $200 in cash. Table B‑1 shows your 
cash flow.
To summarize, you had $200 come in but $4,500 go out. So your cash flow  
was –$4,300. (That’s why the $4,300 is in parentheses.) From a cash-flow per-
spective, the first day doesn’t look all that good, right? But does the cash-flow 
calculation show you whether you’re making money? Can you look at it and gauge 
whether your little business is on the right track?

APPENDIX B  If Numbers Are Your Friends      343
The answer to both questions is no. Your cash flow is important. You can’t, for 
example, write a $4,500 check unless you have at least $4,500 in your checking 
account. Your cash flow doesn’t tell you whether you’re making money, though. 
In fact, you may see a couple of problems with looking just at the cash flow of the 
rowboat-rental business.
Depreciation is an accounting gimmick
Here’s the first problem: If you take good care of the rowboats, you can use them 
every summer for the next few years. In fact, say that the rowboat rental season, 
which runs from early spring to late autumn, is 150 days long and that your well-
made rowboats will last ten years.
»
» You can probably rent the rowboats for 1,500 days.
(One-hundred-fifty days per year times ten years equals 1,500 days.)
»
» Each rowboat costs $1,500.
The depreciation expense for each rowboat is only $1 per day over 1,500 
days. That’s a whopping $3 for all three boats.
Do you see what I’m saying? If you have something that costs a great deal of 
money but lasts for a long time, spreading out the cost makes sense. This spread-
ing out is usually called depreciation. The little $1 chunks that are allocated to a day 
are the depreciation expense.
Accountants use the terms cost and expense to mean distinctly different things. 
A cost is the price that you pay for something. If you pay Peter Gruntpaw $1,500 
for a rowboat, the rowboat’s cost is $1,500. An expense, on the other hand, is what 
you use in a profit calculation. The little $1 chunks of the rowboat’s $1,500 cost 
(that are allocated to individual days) are expenses.
If this depreciation stuff seems wacky, remember that what you’re really trying to 
do is figure out whether you made any money your first day of business. And all 
I’m really saying is that you shouldn’t include the whole cost of the rowboats as

an expense in the first day’s profit calculation. Some of the cost should be included 
as an expense in calculating the profit in future days. That’s fair, right?
Accrual-basis accounting is cool
You don’t want to forget about the $200 that the Gerbils owe you, either. Although 
Mr. Gerbil (remember that the name is pronounced “go-bell”) may not send you 
the check for several days or even for several weeks, he will pay you. You earned 
the money.
The principles of accounting say that you should include sales in your profit cal-
culations when you earn the money, not when you actually collect it. The logic 
behind this include-sales-when-they’re-earned rule is that it produces a better 
estimate of the business you’re doing.
Suppose that the day after the Gerbils and Hamsters rent the rowboats, you have 
no customers, but Mr. Gerbil comes out and pays you $200. If you use the include- 
sales-when-they’re-earned rule, which is called accrual-basis accounting, your 
daily sales look like this:
Day 1
Day 2
Sales
$400
$0
If you instead use cash-basis accounting (in which you count sales when you collect 
the cash), your daily sales look like this:
Day 1
Day 2
Sales
$200
$200
DIFFERENT NAMES, SAME LOGIC
I don’t see any point in hiding this nasty little accounting secret from you: Accountants 
call this cost-allocation process by different names, depending on what sort of cost is 
being spread out.
Most of the time, the cost allocation is called depreciation. You depreciate buildings, 
machinery, furniture, and many other items as well. Allocating the cost of a natural 
resource — such as crude oil that you pump, coal that you dig, or minerals that you 
extract — is depletion. And allocating the cost of things that aren’t tangible — franchise 
agreements, copyrights, and patents, for example — is amortization.

APPENDIX B  If Numbers Are Your Friends      345
The traditional accrual-based accounting method shows that you have a good day 
when you rent two boats and a terrible day when you don’t rent any boats. By 
comparison, when you use cash-basis accounting, your sales record looks as 
though you rented a boat each day, even though you didn’t. Now you know why 
accrual-basis accounting is a better way to measure profit.
Accrual-basis accounting also works for expenses. You should count an expense 
when you incur it, not when you pay it. For example, you call the local radio sta-
tion and ask the people there to announce your new boat-rental business a couple 
of times for a fee of $25. Although you don’t have to pay the radio station the day 
your announcement airs, you should still count the $25 as an expense for that day.
Now you know how to measure profits
With what you now know, you’re ready to measure the first day’s profits. Table B‑2 
is a profit and loss statement for your first day in business.
Although the first day’s cash flow was terrible, your little business is quite profit-
able. In fact, if you really do make about $370 per day, you’ll recoup your entire 
$4,500 investment in less than three weeks. That’s pretty darn good.
Some financial brain food
Now that you know how to measure profits, I can fill you in on some important 
conceptual stuff:
»
» You measure profits for a specific period of time.
In the rowboat-business example, you measured the profits for a day. Some 
people actually do measure profits (or try to measure profits) on a daily basis. 
Most times, though, people use bigger chunks of time. Monthly chunks of

time are common, as are three-month chunks of time (quarters). And every-
body measures profits annually — if only because the government makes you 
do so for income tax accounting.
»
» When people start talking about how often and for what chunks of time 
profits are measured, they use a couple of terms.
The year that you calculate profits for is the fiscal year. The smaller chunks 
of time for which you measure profits over the year are accounting periods or 
interim accounting periods.
You don’t need to memorize these new terms. But now that you’ve read them, 
you’ll probably remember them.
»
» The length of your accounting periods involves an awkward trade-off.
Daily profit and loss calculations show you how well you did at the end of 
every day, but you have to collect the data and do the work every day. And 
preparing a profit and loss statement is a great deal of work.
I made the example purposefully easy by including only a few transactions. In 
real life, you have many more transactions to worry about and fiddle with.
»
» If you use a quarterly interim accounting period, you don’t have to 
collect the raw data and do the arithmetic very often, but you know how 
you’re doing only every once in a while.
In my mind, checking your profits only four times per year isn’t enough. A lot 
can happen in three months.
In the Old Days, Things Were Different
If you’re new to the arithmetic and logic of profit calculation — which is mostly 
what modern accounting is all about — you won’t be surprised to hear that not all 
that long ago, most people couldn’t and didn’t do much profit calculating.
What they did instead was monitor a business’s financial condition. They used — 
well, actually, they still use — a balance sheet to monitor the financial condition. 
A balance sheet just lists a business’s assets and its liabilities at a particular point 
in time.
Say that at the start of your first day in the rowboat-rental business — before you 
pay Peter Gruntpaw — you have $5,000 in your checking account. To make the 
situation interesting, $4,000 of this money is a loan from your mother-in-law, 
and $1,000 is cash that you invested in your business.

APPENDIX B  If Numbers Are Your Friends      347
Here’s a key to help you understand the balance sheets and cash flow in this 
section:
»
» A business’s assets are composed of things that the business owns.
»
» Liabilities consist of the amounts that the business owes.
»
» Equity is the difference between the business’s assets and its liabilities. 
Interestingly, equity also shows the money that the owners or shareholders or 
partners have left in the business.
»
» If you correctly calculate each of the numbers that go on the balance sheet, 
the total assets value always equals the total liabilities plus total owner’s 
equity value.
Your balance sheet at the beginning of the day looks like the one in Table B‑3.
If you construct a balance sheet at the end of the first day, the financial picture is 
only slightly more complicated. Some of these explanations are too complicated to 
give in a sentence, so the paragraphs that follow describe how I got each number.
Even if you don’t pay much attention, I recommend that you quickly read the 
explanations. Mostly, I want you to understand that if you try to monitor a busi-
ness’s financial condition by using a balance sheet, as I’ve done here, the picture 
gets messy. Later in this appendix, I talk about how QuickBooks makes all this 
stuff easier.
Table B‑4 shows the balance sheet at the end of the first day.

Cash, the first line item shown in Table B‑4, is the most complicated line item to 
prove. If you were really in the rowboat-rental business, of course, you could just 
look at your checkbook. But if you were writing an appendix about being in the 
rowboat-rental business (as I am), you’d need to be able to calculate the cash 
balance. Table B‑5 shows the calculation of the cash balance for your rowboat-
rental business.
The $200 receivable, the second line item shown in Table B‑4, is the money that 
the Gerbils owe you.

APPENDIX B  If Numbers Are Your Friends      349
The third line shown in Table B‑4, the Rowboats balance sheet value, is $4,497. 
This is weird, I’ll grant you, but here’s how you figure it: You deduct from the 
original cost of the asset all the depreciation expense that you charged to date. The 
original cost of the three rowboats was $4,500. You charged only $3 of deprecia-
tion for the first day, so the balance sheet value, or net book value, is $4,497.
The only liabilities are the $25 that you owe the radio station for those new busi-
ness announcements (shown on the seventh line in Table B‑4) and the $4,000 
that you borrowed from your mother-in-law (shown on the eighth line in 
Table B‑4). I won’t even ask why you opened that can of worms.
Finally, the owner’s equity section of the balance sheet shows the $1,000 that you 
originally contributed (see line 10 in Table B‑4) and also the $372 you earned (see 
line 11 in Table B‑4).
It’s not a coincidence that the total assets value equals the total liabilities plus the 
total owner’s equity value. If you correctly calculate each of the numbers that go 
on the balance sheet, the two totals are always equal.
A balance sheet lists asset, liability, and owner’s equity balances as of a specific date. 
It gives you a financial snapshot at a point in time. Usually, you prepare a balance 
sheet whenever you prepare a profit and loss statement. The balance sheet shows 
account balances for the last day of the fiscal year and interim accounting period.  
(I think that it’s kind of neat that after only a few pages of this appendix, you’re 
reading and understanding such terms as fiscal year and interim accounting period.)
What Does an Italian Monk  
Have to Do with Anything?
So far, I’ve provided narrative descriptions of all the financial events that affect 
the balance sheet and the income statement. I describe how you started the busi-
ness with $5,000 of cash (a $4,000 loan from your mother-in-law and $1,000 of 
cash that you invested). At an even earlier point in this appendix, I note that you 
rented a boat to the Hamsters for $200 and they paid you in cash.
Although narrative descriptions of financial events — such as starting the business 
or renting to the Hamsters — make for just-bearable reading, they’re unwieldy for 
accountants to use in practice. Partly, this awkwardness is because accountants are 
usually (or maybe always?) terrible writers. But an even bigger problem is that 
using the lots-and-lots-of-words approach makes describing all the little bits and 
pieces of information that you need difficult and downright tedious.

350      PART 6  Appendixes
Fortunately, about 500 years ago, an Italian monk named Lucia Pacioli thought 
the same thing. No, I’m not making this up. What Pacioli really said was “Hey, 
guys. Hello? Is anybody in there? You have to get more efficient in the way that 
you describe your financial transactions. You have to create a financial shorthand 
system that works when you have a large number of transactions to record.”
Pacioli proceeded to describe a financial shorthand system that made it easy to 
collect all the little bits and pieces of information needed to prepare income state-
ments and balance sheets. The shorthand system he described? Double-entry 
bookkeeping.
This system enabled people to name the income statement or balance sheet line 
items or accounts that are affected and then give the dollar amount of the effect. 
The profit and loss statement and the balance sheet line items are accounts. You 
need to remember this term.
A list of profit and loss statement and balance sheet line items is a chart of accounts. 
You might already know this term from using QuickBooks.
Pacioli also did one wacky thing: He used a couple of new terms, debit and credit, 
to describe the increases and decreases in accounts:
»
» Debit: Increases in asset accounts and in expense accounts are debits. 
Decreases in liability, owner’s equity, and income accounts are also debits.
»
» Credit: Decreases in asset and expense accounts are credits. Increases in 
liability, owner’s equity, and income accounts are also credits.
Keeping these terms straight is a bit confusing, so see Table B‑6 for help.

I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but if you want to use double-entry bookkeeping, 
you need to memorize the information in Table B‑6. If it’s any consolation, this 
information is the only chunk of data in the entire book that I ask you to memo-
rize. Failing that, dog-ear this page so that you can flip here quickly, or refer to 
the online Cheat Sheet at www.dummies.com. See the Introduction for information 
on how to find the Cheat Sheet for this book.
And now for the blow-by-blow
The best way to help you understand this double-entry bookkeeping stuff is to 
show you how to use it to record all the financial events that I’ve discussed thus 
far in this appendix. Start with the money that you invested in the business and 
the money that you foolishly borrowed from your mother-in-law. You invested 
$1,000 in cash, and you borrowed $4,000 in cash. Here are the double-entry book-
keeping transactions — the journal entries — that describe these financial events.
	
Journal Entry 1: To record your $1,000 investment
Debit

Owner’s equity

Journal Entry 2: To record the $4,000 loan from 
your mother-in-law
Debit
Credit
Cash
$4,000
Loan payable to mother-in-law
$4,000
If you add all the debits and credits in a journal entry, you get a trial balance. A trial 
balance isn’t all that special, but you use it to prepare profit and loss statements 
and balance sheets easily. If you add the debits and credits shown in journal 
entries 1 and 2, you get the trial balance shown in Table B‑7.
This trial balance provides the raw data needed to construct the rowboat-business 
balance sheet at the start of the first day. If you don’t believe me, take a peek at 
Table B‑3. Oh, sure, the information shown in Table B‑7 isn’t as polished. Table B‑7 
doesn’t provide labels that tell you that cash is an asset, for example. And Table B‑7 
doesn’t provide subtotals showing the total assets (equal to $5,000) and the total 
liabilities and owner’s equity (also equal to $5,000). But it does provide the raw data.

To build a trial balance for the end of the first day, you add all the first-day journal 
entries to the trial balance shown in Table  B‑7. The result is the trial balance 
shown in Table B‑8.
The trial balance shown in Table B‑8 provides the raw data used to prepare the 
balance sheet and profit and loss statement for the first day.
If you look at the accounts labeled Balance sheet accounts in Table B‑8 and compare 
these with the balance sheet shown in Table B‑4, you see that this trial balance 
provides all the raw numbers needed for the balance sheet. The only numbers in 
Table B‑4 that aren’t directly from Table B‑8 are the subtotals that you get by 
adding other numbers.

If you look at the accounts labeled as Profit and loss statement accounts in Table B‑8 
and compare them with the profit and loss statement shown in Table B‑2, you see 
that this trial balance also provides all the raw numbers needed for the profit and 
loss statement. Again, the only numbers in Table B‑2 that aren’t directly from 
Table B‑8 are the subtotals that you get by adding other numbers.
Blow-by-blow, Part 2
If you understand what I’ve discussed so far in this appendix, you grasp how 
accounting and double-entry bookkeeping work. I want to show you about a half-
dozen more transaction examples, however, to plug a few minor holes in your 
knowledge.
When you collect money that you’ve previously billed, you record the transaction 
by debiting cash and crediting receivables (or accounts receivable). In the rowboat 
business, you make this basic entry when Mr. Gerbil later pays you the $200 that 
he owes you for the first day’s rental.
	
Journal Entry 8: To record a payment by a customer
Debit
Credit
Cash
$200
Receivable
$200
Don’t record a sale when you collect the cash. The sale has already been recorded 
in Journal Entry 5. When you pay the radio station for the advertising, you record 
the transaction by debiting accounts payable and crediting cash.
	
Journal Entry 9: To record your payment of $25  
to the radio station
Debit
Credit
Payable
$25
Cash
$25
The one other thing I want to cover, ever so briefly, is inventory accounting. 
Accounting for items that you buy and resell or the items that you make and resell 
is a bit trickier, and I don’t have room to go into a great deal of detail.

APPENDIX B  If Numbers Are Your Friends      355
When you buy items to resell, you debit an asset account, often named Inventory. 
If you purchase 300 of the $10 thingamajigs that you hope to resell for $25 each, 
you record the following journal entry:
	
Journal Entry 10: To record the cash purchase  
of thingamajigs
Debit
Credit
Inventory
$3,000
Cash
$3,000
When you sell a thingamajig, you need to perform two tasks: Record the sale and 
record the cost of the sale. If you need to record the sale of 100 thingamajigs for 
$25 each, for example, you record the following journal entry:
	
Journal Entry 11: To record the sale of 100  
thingamajigs for $25 apiece
Debit
Credit
Receivable
$2,500
Sales
$2,500
You also need to record the cost of the thingamajigs that you sold as an expense 
and record the reduction in the value of your thingamajig inventory. That means 
that if you reduce your inventory count from 300 items to 200 items, you need to 
adjust your inventory’s dollar value. You record the following journal entry:
	
Journal Entry 12: To record the cost of the  
100 thingamajigs sold
Debit
Credit
Cost of goods sold
$1,000
Inventory
$1,000
The cost of goods sold account, by the way, is just another expense. It appears on 
your profit and loss statement.

356      PART 6  Appendixes
How does QuickBooks help?
If you keep (or someone else keeps) the books for your business manually, you 
actually have to make these journal entries. When you use QuickBooks to keep the 
books, however, all this debiting and crediting business usually goes on behind 
the scenes. When you invoice a customer, QuickBooks debits accounts receivable 
and credits sales. When you write a check to pay some bill, QuickBooks debits the 
expense (or the accounts payable account) and credits cash.
In the few cases in which a financial transaction isn’t recorded automatically 
when you fill in an onscreen form, you need to use the General Journal Entry win-
dow. To display the General Journal Entry window, choose Company ➪ Make Gen-
eral Journal Entries. You use the General Journal Entry window to create journal 
entries. An example of one of these noncash transactions is depreciation expense.
QuickBooks automatically builds a trial balance, using journal entries that it con-
structs automatically and any journal entries that you enter by using the General 
Journal Entry window. If you want to see the trial balance, just choose 
Reports ➪ Accountant & Taxes ➪ Trial Balance. QuickBooks prepares balance sheets, 
profit and loss statements, and several other reports by using the trial balance.
Two Dark Shadows in the  
World of Accounting
The real purpose of accounting systems, such as QuickBooks, is simple: Account-
ing systems are supposed to make succeeding in your business easier for you. You 
may think, therefore, that the world of accounting is a friendly place. Unfortu-
nately, this scenario isn’t quite true. I’m sorry to report that two dark shadows 
hang over the world of accounting: financial accounting standards and income  
tax laws.
The first dark shadow
“Financial accounting standards,” you say. “What the heck are those?”
Here’s the quick-and-dirty explanation: Financial accounting standards are 
accounting rules created by certified public accountants (CPAs). These rules are 
supposed to make reading financial statements and understanding what’s going 
on easier for people. (I happen to believe that just the opposite is often true in the 
case of small businesses, in case you’re interested.) But because of what financial 

APPENDIX B  If Numbers Are Your Friends      357
accounting standards purport to do, some people — such as bank loan officers — 
want to see profit and loss statements and balance sheets that follow the rules. 
The exact catchphrase is one that you might have heard before: “Prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.”
Unfortunately, the rules are very complicated, the rules are inconsistently inter-
preted, and actually applying the rules would soon run most small businesses into 
the ground. (And you’ll be happy to know that as you were running your business 
into the ground, your CPA would make a great deal of money helping you figure 
out what you were supposed to be doing.) So what should you do about this first 
dark shadow?
Glad you asked:
»
» Know that it exists. Know that sometimes people, like your banker, honestly 
think that you should follow a super-complicated set of accounting rules.
»
» Don’t get sucked into the financial accounting standards tar pit. Tell 
people — your banker included — that you do your accounting in the way that 
you think enables you to best manage your business. Tell people that a small 
business like yours can’t afford to have an in-house staff of full-time CPAs. 
Finally, tell people that you don’t necessarily prepare your financial statements 
“in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.”
Do attempt to fully and fairly disclose your financial affairs to people who need to 
know about them. Lying to a creditor or an investor about your financial affairs or 
getting sneaky with one of these people is a good way to end up in jail.
The second dark shadow
Here’s the second dark shadow: income tax accounting laws. You know that Con-
gress enacts tax legislation to raise revenue. And you know that it does so in a 
political environment strewn with all sorts of partisan voodoo economics and 
social overtones. So you won’t be surprised to find out that the accounting rules 
that come out of the nation’s capital and your state capital don’t make much sense 
for running a business.
You need to apply the rules when you prepare your tax return, of course, but you 
don’t have to use them the rest of the year. A far better approach is to do 
your accounting in a way that enables you to run your business best. That way, 
you don’t use accounting tricks and gambits that make sense for income tax 
accounting but foul up your accounting system. At the end of the year, when 
you’re preparing your tax return, have your tax preparer adjust your trial balance 
so that it conforms to income tax accounting laws.

358      PART 6  Appendixes
The Danger of Shell Games
This appendix is longer than I initially intended. I’m sorry about that. I want to 
share one more thought with you, however. I think that it’s an important thought, 
so please stay with me.
You could use the accounting knowledge that this appendix imparts to do the 
bookkeeping for a very large business. As crazy as it sounds, if you had 3,000 
­rowboats for rent — perhaps you have rental outlets at dozens of lakes scattered 
all over the Rockies  — you might actually be able to keep the books for a 
$200 million–per-year business. You’d have to enter many more transactions, 
and the numbers would all be bigger, but you wouldn’t necessarily be doing 
anything more complicated than the transactions in this appendix.
Unfortunately, the temptation is great  — especially on the part of financial 
­advisors  — to let the money stuff get more complicated as a business grows. 
People start talking about sophisticated leasing arrangements that make sense 
because of the tax laws. A customer or vendor suggests some complicated profit-
sharing or cost-reimbursement agreement. Then your attorney talks you into 
­setting up a couple of new subsidiaries for legal reasons.
All these schemes make accounting for your business terribly complicated. If you 
choose to ignore this complexity and go on your merry way, very soon you won’t 
know whether you’re making money. (I’ve seen plenty of people go this route — 
and it isn’t pretty.) On the other hand, if you truly want to do accurate accounting 
in a complex environment, you need to spend a great deal of cash for really smart 
accountants. (This tactic, of course, assumes that you can find, hire, and afford 
these really smart accountants.)
If you’re unsure how to tell whether something is just too complicated, here’s a 
general rule you can use: If you can’t easily create the journal entries that quantify 
the financial essence of some event, you’re in trouble.
So what should you do? I suggest that you don’t complicate your business’s 
finances  — not even if you think that the newfangled, tax-incentivized, sale-
leaseback profit plan is a sure winner. Keep things simple, my friend. To win the 
game, you have to keep score.

APPENDIX C  Sharing QuickBooks Files      359
Sharing QuickBooks 
Files
O
kay, here’s a cool deal: Within QuickBooks, you can set up user permis-
sions, which enable you to specify who has access to which areas of your 
QuickBooks files. In fact, you can also work with your QuickBooks file on 
a network and in a multiple-user environment by using a powerful feature called 
record locking.
If you work on a network and need to use or just want to find out about the Quick-
Books network features, read this appendix. If your computer isn’t connected to a 
network, but you want to designate unique permissions for different people by 
using a QuickBooks file on a single computer, read the section “Setting User Per-
missions” later in this appendix. And if you’re the only one using QuickBooks, you 
can skip this appendix.
Sharing a QuickBooks File on a Network
Two important features power the QuickBooks multiuser network capability: user 
permissions and record locking. The user permissions feature lets multiple users of 
a QuickBooks file have unique permissions settings to access different areas of 
QuickBooks. Record locking, the second feature, enables more than one person to 
simultaneously log in to and work with a QuickBooks file.
User permissions
QuickBooks enables you to set user permissions so that you can give different 
QuickBooks users different privileges. Jane Owner may be able to do anything she 
Appendix C

360      PART 6  Appendixes
wants because, metaphorically speaking, she’s Da Man. Joe Clerk, though, may be 
able to enter only bills. Joe, a lowly clerk of perhaps dubious judgment and discre-
tion, may not have the capability to view the company’s profit and loss statement, 
print checks, or record customer payments. This idea makes sense at a practical 
level, right? In a situation in which a bunch of people access the QuickBooks file, 
you want to make sure that confidential information remains confidential.
You also want to make sure that people can’t intentionally or unintentionally cor-
rupt your financial records. You don’t want someone to enter incorrect data (per-
haps because he stumbles into some area of the QuickBooks program where he has 
no business). And you don’t want someone fraudulently recording transactions — 
such as fake checks — that she can go cash.
I think that if you reflect on this user-permissions stuff, you’ll realize “Hey, yeah, 
that makes sense!” So I’m not going to talk a bunch more about it. Let me con-
clude by throwing out a couple of general observations about how you decide 
which user permissions are appropriate:
»
» Data confidentiality: This issue probably has the most to do with your 
management philosophy. The more open you are about stuff, the less you 
probably have to worry about people snooping for stuff. I want to point out, 
however, that payroll is always a touchy subject. If everybody knows what 
everyone else is paid, some interesting discussions occur — but you already 
knew that.
»
» Data corruption: Regarding data corruption, you need to know that people 
usually apply two general rules:
•	 Don’t give people access to tools they don’t know how to use. That’s only 
asking for trouble.
•	 Make sure that no one person can muck around unsupervised in some 
area of the accounting system — especially if that person records or 
handles cash.
If at all possible, employ a buddy system whereby people do stuff together so that 
people always double-check other people’s work — even if only indirectly. Maybe 
Joe records a bill, but Jane always cuts the check to pay the bill. Maybe Raul records 
customer invoices, but Chang sends them out. Maybe Saul records cash receipts, 
but Beth deposits them. You see the pattern, right? If two people deal with a par-
ticular economic event — again, especially one that involves cash — it’s a really 
good idea for Joe and Jane, Raul and Chang, and Saul and Beth to look over each 
other’s shoulders.

APPENDIX C  Sharing QuickBooks Files      361
Record locking
The easiest way to understand record locking is to compare it with the other vari-
ety of locking: file locking. Most other programs use file locking. File locking means 
that if one person on the network has, say, a word processing document open, 
nobody else on the network can open and then edit that document. Others may be 
able to open a copy of the document that they can save on their computers, but 
they can’t edit the original document. The operating system locks the original 
document (the file) so that only one person can fool around with the file at a time. 
This locking ensures the integrity of the data and the changes that people make to 
the data. (If this business about ensuring integrity seems weird, think about the 
difficulty of making sure that both people’s changes end up in a word processing 
document that both people are editing simultaneously.)
Record locking works differently. With record locking, more than one person on the 
network can open and edit the same file at once, but only one person can work 
with a specific record.
A record is a part of a file. In a file of bills that you owe to vendors, for example, the 
file is the entire collection of bills. The individual bills are records within the file, 
and more than one person can open the file of bills. Individual bills, though — the 
individual records that make up the file  — are locked when a person grabs a 
record.
This information may sound like too much confusion, but differentiating between 
files and the records within a file is what makes sharing files possible. In Quick-
Books, for example, if Jane is entering one bill for Alpha Company in a file, Joe can 
edit a bill for Beta Corporation because the two bills are different records. Because 
of record locking, however, Jane can’t fool around with the Beta Corporation bill 
JUST WHAT IS A NETWORK, ANYWAY?
A network is a set of connected computers that allows the people who use the comput-
ers to share information. Uh, well, this is somewhat self-serving, but let me say that if 
you don’t currently use a network, Networking For Dummies, 11th Edition, by Doug Lowe; 
Home Networking For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Kathy Ivens; and Wireless Home 
Networking For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Danny Briere and Pat Hurley (all John Wiley & 
Sons, Inc.), explain how to set up a small-business network in a couple of hours and live 
to tell about it.

362      PART 6  Appendixes
that Joe is editing. And Joe — again, because of record locking — can’t fiddle with 
the Alpha Company bill that Jane is entering.
Restated more generally, no two people can edit the same record in a file at the 
same time. Record locking enables employees to use a file in a multiuser environ-
ment because it lets more than one person work with a file.
Installing QuickBooks for Network Use
To install QuickBooks for network use, you must first install QuickBooks on all the 
computers on the network that need to access and work with the QuickBooks file. 
This task isn’t tricky. You don’t need to install QuickBooks in any fancy way to be 
able to share QuickBooks files.
You need to purchase a copy of QuickBooks for each computer that’s going to run 
the program. If you have three computers on which you want to use QuickBooks, 
you need to buy three copies of QuickBooks. Or you could buy a special multiple-
seat license version of QuickBooks. If you attempt to install a single copy of Quick-
Books (with a single key code) on multiple computers, QuickBooks won’t allow 
two computers using the same key code to share a file in multiuser mode.
When you create the file that you want to share, you need to make sure that you 
store the file in a location where the other QuickBooks users can access it. That is, 
you may need to store the file on a server. You can also store the file on a client 
computer as long as you designate sharing permissions for either the folder or the 
drive on which you save the QuickBooks file.
Another important thing: Whoever creates the QuickBooks file automatically 
becomes the file administrator. The file administrator has access to all areas of the 
file and sets up the other file users, so you don’t want just anybody setting up the 
QuickBooks file. Either the business owner or the head of accounting is well-
suited for this job. In any case, the person who sets up the file should be trustwor-
thy, a regular around the office, and easy to reach for any questions or problems 
that arise. Also, this person probably should have a strong background in account-
ing. See the following section for more details.

APPENDIX C  Sharing QuickBooks Files      363
Setting User Permissions
You can tell QuickBooks who else will use the file and set permissions for these 
other people during QuickBooks Setup (see Chapter  2) or later. I’m going to 
assume that you give QuickBooks this information later.
User permissions in Enterprise Solutions
To set permissions in Enterprise Solutions, follow these steps:
1.	 Tell QuickBooks that you want to set user permissions.
Choose the Company ➪ Users ➪ Set Up Users and Roles command. 
QuickBooks displays the Users and Roles dialog box, as shown in Figure C‑1.
2.	 Indicate you want to set up a new user.
Click the New button so that QuickBooks displays the New User dialog box (see 
Figure C‑2), which lists a variety of accounting roles that a QuickBooks user might 
fill. These roles give a user the capability to perform appropriate accounting 
tasks with the QuickBooks program. The Description box at the bottom of the 
dialog box summarizes the tasks that someone in a given role might be 
expected to perform.
CHOOSING A GOOD PASSWORD
The administrator has access to all areas of QuickBooks, so picking a good password is 
especially important. Other users (especially those with higher levels of access permis-
sion) also need to select their passwords carefully.
A good password is one that you can remember but that other people and computer 
programs can’t easily guess or iteratively figure out. Combinations of letters and num-
bers are the best way to go. Use your grade-school nickname plus the number of your 
favorite basketball player, for example, or use a random number combined with the 
name of your favorite restaurant (as long as you don’t walk around all day muttering 
“Number nine, number nine, number nine” and raving about your love of this particular 
eatery). Avoid using telephone numbers, family names, and family dates (such as the 
birthday of a family member). And absolutely do not use banking PINs or Social Security 
numbers.
One last tip: QuickBooks lets you create passwords from 0 to 16 characters in length. 
As a general rule, choose a password that’s longer, not shorter.

364      PART 6  Appendixes
3.	 Select the role that best matches the user you’re describing and then 
click Add.
Owners, by the way, should have the Full Access role so they can do anything 
they want. Note that you can give a user more than one role.
If you want to change an existing user’s permissions, select the user on the 
User List tab and then click the Edit button. QuickBooks then displays the Edit 
User dialog box, which resembles the New User dialog box (refer to Figure C‑2) 
and allows you to change a user’s role or roles.
4.	 Click OK to return to the Users and Roles dialog box.

APPENDIX C  Sharing QuickBooks Files      365
You can review the permissions (basically, the list of capabilities that QuickBooks 
allows) for a particular person or a predefined role. To see the permissions that a 
user has, select the User List tab on the Users and Roles dialog box, click the View 
Permissions button, select the user in the list box, and then click the Display but-
ton. QuickBooks displays a large dialog box (see Figure C‑3) that specifically iden-
tifies what the user can do. To see the permissions that a particular role has, select 
the Role List tab of the Users and Roles dialog box, click the View Permissions 
button, select the role, and then click the Display button.
User permissions in QuickBooks  
Pro and Premier
To set permissions in QuickBooks Pro or QuickBooks Premier, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the Company ➪ Set Up Users and Passwords ➪ Set Up Users 
command.
QuickBooks displays the User List dialog box (not shown).
FIGURE C-3: 
The View 
Permissions 
dialog box  
for a user.

366      PART 6  Appendixes
2.	 Click the New User button.
QuickBooks displays the New User dialog box (not shown), which you use to 
add new users and specify passwords.
3.	 Type a username and password for the additional person whom you 
want to be able to use the QuickBooks file; type the password again in 
the Confirm Password text box.
Re-entering the password confirms that you typed the password correctly the 
first time.
From this point, when someone opens the QuickBooks file, QuickBooks asks 
for a username and password. So for another person to access the QuickBooks 
file, she must enter the username and password that you set.
4.	 Specify the user’s access.
QuickBooks displays a dialog box (not shown) asking whether you want the 
person to have access to all areas of the QuickBooks file or only some areas.
If you specify that you want to give access to only some areas — the usual case, 
probably — QuickBooks displays a series of dialog boxes that enable you to set 
permissions for each area. You select the No Access option button to make a 
particular area (such as banking stuff) off limits for the user, or select the All 
Areas of QuickBooks option button to give the user permission to create and 
print transactions and reports in the area, or mark the Selected Areas of 
QuickBooks option button to give partial access to the area. If you choose the 
Selected Areas option, you need to specify the limited access by stepping 
through the wizard’s pages and describing in rigorous detail the access you 
want the user to have. You can also specify whether other applications (such 
as TurboTax) get access to the QuickBooks data.
5.	 Review the user’s access.
After you finish stepping through the Set Up User Password and Access dialog 
boxes, QuickBooks shows a summary of the permissions for a user. Click the 
Back button if you need to go back and change permissions for an area, or click 
Finish to indicate you’re done specifying what the particular user can do. 
QuickBooks displays the User List dialog box again, with the new user added. 
Click Add User to add another new user, click Edit User to edit the selected 
user, or click Close to close the dialog box.
A user can log on and open a QuickBooks file from any computer on the network 
as long as the computer has QuickBooks installed and has network access to the 
QuickBooks file. If a person attempts to open a restricted area or perform an 
unauthorized action, however, QuickBooks displays a message box indicating that 
the person lacks the permissions necessary to perform the action.

APPENDIX C  Sharing QuickBooks Files      367
Specifying Multiuser Mode
For more than one person to work with a QuickBooks file at once, users must work 
with the QuickBooks file in multiuser mode. The first person who opens the file 
needs to specify multiuser mode for others to be able to open the file. To specify 
multiuser mode, choose File ➪ Switch to Multiuser Mode. You can tell that you’re 
working in multiuser mode because the QuickBooks title bar indicates so. When 
other people open the QuickBooks file, it automatically opens in multiuser mode. 
For another user to work in single-user mode, the other users must close the 
QuickBooks file, and the user who wants to work in single-user mode needs (or 
may need) to choose File ➪ Switch to Single-User Mode.
Working in Multiuser Mode
Sharing a QuickBooks file over a network involves a couple of tricks. First, you 
need to make sure that no one who is in single-user mode is using the file that you 
want to open. If someone is using the file, and you try to open it, QuickBooks dis-
plays a message indicating that someone is using the company file in single-user 
mode. Tell the person to switch to multiuser mode and then click the Try Again 
button.
As soon as you begin creating or editing a transaction, QuickBooks locks the 
transaction. This way, no one else can edit the transaction while you work on it. 
You can tell whether you have a transaction open in edit mode by what Quick-
Books displays in the title bar at the top of the form: Editing Transaction. Other 
users can open the transaction while you edit it in edit mode, but they can’t make 
changes in it until you’re finished.
If you attempt to edit a transaction that your co-worker Harriet already has open 
in edit mode, for example, QuickBooks displays a message that reads (and here, 
I paraphrase) Excuse me, Bubba. Harriet is working with that transaction. 
You need to come back later.

About the Author
Stephen L. Nelson, CPA, MBA (finance), MS (taxation), has a simple purpose in 
life: He wants to help you (and people like you) manage your business finances by 
using computers. Oh, sure, this personal mandate won’t win him a Nobel Prize or 
anything, but it’s his own little contribution to the world.
Steve’s experiences mesh nicely with his special purpose. The managing member 
of a CPA firm in Redmond, Washington, his business experience includes a stint 
as an adjunct professor of taxation (S corporations and limited liability ­companies) 
at Golden Gate University graduate tax school and a few years working as a senior 
consultant and CPA with Arthur Andersen & Co. (er, yeah, that Arthur Andersen — 
but, hey, it was nearly 30 years ago). Steve, whose books have sold more than 5 
million copies in English and have been translated into 11 other ­languages, is also 
the bestselling author of Quicken For Dummies.

Dedication
To the entrepreneurs and small-business people of the world. You folks create 
most of the new jobs.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Hey, reader, lots of folks spent lots of time working on this book to make Quick-

bly meet one of them someday at a produce shop, squeezing cantaloupe, eating 
grapes, and looking for the perfect peach.
First, a huge thanks to the wonderful folks at Intuit who helped me by providing 
the beta software and other friendly assistance for this and past editions of this

Another big thank-you goes to the editorial folks at John Wiley & Sons, Inc.,
