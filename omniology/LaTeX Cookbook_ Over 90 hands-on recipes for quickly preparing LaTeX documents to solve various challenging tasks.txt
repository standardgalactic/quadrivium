Preface
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting software and is very popular, especially among scientists. 
Its programming language gives you full control over every aspect of your documents, no 
matter how complex they are. LaTeX's large number of customizable templates and supporting 
packages cover most aspects of writing with embedded typographic expertise.
With this book, you will learn to leverage the capabilities of the latest document classes  
and explore the functionalities of the newest packages.
This book starts with examples of common document types. It provides samples for tuning 
text design, using fonts, embedding images, and creating legible tables. Common parts  
of the document such as the bibliography, glossary, and index are covered with LaTeX's 
modern approach.
You will learn how to create excellent graphics directly within LaTeX; this includes creating 
diagrams and plots quickly and easily.
Finally, the book shows the application of LaTeX in various scientific fields.
The example-driven approach of this book is sure to increase your productivity.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, The Variety of Document Types, introduces you to the different types of documents 
and covers how LaTeX can be used for for any document type such as a thesis, a book, a CV,  
a presentation, a flyer, and a large poster.
Chapter 2, Tuning the Text, focuses on customizing text details in the documents. We will 
start with some very useful basics, covering some helpful things. We will end the chapter with 
recipes that show off what LaTeX can do beyond rectangular paragraphs.

Preface
vi
Chapter 3, Adjusting Fonts, helps you to choose fonts globally, and demonstrates how to 
adjust them within the document.
Chapter 4, Working with Images, contains some recipes for including, positioning, and 
manipulating images within LaTeX. After discussing the quality aspects, you will get to know 
about the concept of floating figures for automated positioning to give well-balanced text 
heights on pages.
Chapter 5, Beautiful Designs, helps you in adding background images, creating beautiful 
ornaments, adding pretty headings, producing a calendar, and inserting symbols for computer 
keys and menu items.
Chapter 6, Designing Tables, helps you to create good-looking tables. Specifically, it 
covers creating a legible table, aligning numeric data, adding colors, shape, shading, and 
transparency merging and splitting cells, and reading in table data from external files.
Chapter 7, Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies, provides recipes for quickly starting and 
customizing the table of contents, lists of of figures and tables, bibliographies, glossaries,  
and indexes.
Chapter 8, Getting the Most out of the PDF, explores the capabilities of PDF, such as 
metadata, PDF comments, and fillable forms. You will see how to combine PDF files,  
how to crop margins, and how to optimize the output for e-books.
Chapter 9, Creating Graphics, contains recipes to create impressive graphics. We will start off 
using modern packages for various purposes to create complete and useable graphics, such 
as various kinds of diagrams and charts.
Chapter 10, Advanced Mathematics, explores one of the classic strong points of LaTeX—its 
excellent quality in typesetting formulas. That's why LaTeX is the most used writing software  
in mathematics. When it comes to formulas, other sciences benefit from it as well.
Chapter 11, Science and Technology, deals with other sciences such as chemistry, physics, 
computer science, and technologies such as electronics. This chapter will be an overview, 
showing how LaTeX can be used in various fields using specific recipes.
Chapter 12, Getting Support on the Internet, starts with a guide to the most useful  
Internet resources for LaTeX. This chapter will show you how to get help from the TeX  
online communities.

Preface

What you need for this book
The software that you need here is TeX Live, version 2015 or later, or MiKTeX, version 2.9 
or later. It is recommendable to also install a LaTeX editor. The introduction in Chapter 1 will 
explain, where to get the TeX software and editors. The Chapter 12 will guide you to further 
Internet resources.
An important tool is texdoc. It opens manuals and further documentation for you. texdoc is 
contained in TeX Live. MiKTeX provides a similar tool with the same name. texdoc is called 
at in Command Prompt by typing texdoc keyword. For packages and bundles, the keyword is 
usually just the name.
All the code examples in this book can be downloaded as described later in the section 
Customer support. So, you don't need to type the code, neither to do copy & paste. That's  
why we could split the codes into snippets to explain them step by step.
Who this book is for
If you already know the basics of LaTeX and if you'd like to get quick and efficient solutions to 
your problems, this is the perfect book for you. If you are an advanced reader, you can use this 
book's example-driven format to take your skillset to the next level. Some familiarity with the 
basic syntax of LaTeX and how to use the editor of your choice for compiling is required.
Sections
In this book, you will find several headings that appear frequently (Getting ready, How to do it, 
How it works, There's more, and See also).
To give clear instructions on how to complete a recipe, we use these sections as follows:

Introduction
LaTeX has been around for many years. Over time, developers and authors have contributed a 
lot of extensions to the LaTeX code base.
These extensions include the following:
f
f
Document class: This is a style file which is the frame of your document. It usually 
comes with meaningful default settings that can be changed via options when 
loading it. Its macros can be customized by the \renewcommand command. It often 
provides commands for authors to modify settings.

The Variety of Document Types
2
f
f
Package: This is a style file with a specific purpose that can be loaded in addition 
to the document class. Packages can be combined. Most of the time, we load many 
packages using the \usepackage command.
f
f
Bundle: This is a set of closely related packages or classes. In our first recipe,  
Writing a short text, you will get to know some bundles.
f
f
Template: This is a document filled with dummy text, which you can use it as  
a starting point, and just fill in your own headings, texts, formulas, and images.  
We will take a look at a template in our second recipe, Writing a thesis.
These add-ons are incredibly valuable! They are one of the reasons for the enduring success 
of LaTeX. We all agree that learning LaTeX can be hard with its steep learning curve. However, 
if you don't reinvent the wheel, and start with a good template or class and a quality set of 
packages, you can quickly achieve great results.
The purpose of this book is to assist you in this regard.
Getting ready
To be able to work with LaTeX, you need install the following on your computer:
f
f
TeX and LaTeX software, which are together called TeX distribution
f
f
A LaTeX editor, although you can use any text editor
f
f
A PDF viewer to view the final output
If you already have these installed, great! In that case, you can skip the next paragraphs and 
immediately proceed to the first recipe.
A PDF reader is probably already installed on your computer, such as the Foxit Reader, the 
Adobe Reader or the Preview app on the Mac. Furthermore, most editors come with an 
integrated PDF previewer. So, let's take a look at the TeX software and editors.
TeX and LaTeX distributions
There are collections of TeX and LaTeX software that are ready to use and easy to install. Their 
websites provide information on installing and updating them. You may choose the download 
site for your system:
f
f
TeX Live: At http://tug.org/texlive/, you can find download information and 
installation instructions for the cross-platform TeX distribution that runs on Windows, 
Linux, Mac OS X, and other Unix systems. It is supported by the TeX Users Group (TUG).
f
f
MacTeX: This is based on TeX Live and has been significantly customized for Mac OS 
X. The basic information is available at http://www.tug.org/mactex/.
f
f
MiKTeX: The download and documentation of that Windows-specific distribution can 
be found at http://www.miktex.org/.

Chapter 1
3
f
f
proTeXt: This is for Windows only, and it is derived from MiKTeX, but proTeXt is more 
user-friendly during installation. Its home page can be found at http://www.tug.
org/protext/.
I recommend that you choose MacTeX if you have a Mac; otherwise, I recommend using TeX 
Live, since the support by the TUG is especially good.
Describing the setup is beyond the scope of this book. For TeX Live, you can find a step-by-step 
explanation with screenshots in the LaTeX Beginner's Guide by Packt Publishing. Generally, 
when you visit Internet addresses of the TeX distributions listed above, you can find detailed 
setup instructions.
Finally, on Linux, such as Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat, Fedora, and SUSE versions, there's usually 
a TeX Live-based software package available via the operating system repositories. While it's 
usually not as up-to-date as an installation done via the TeX Live website or a TeX Live DVD, 
it's very easy to install using the Linux package manager, which you use to install any software 
usually.
LaTeX editors
There are many LaTeX editors, from small and quick to very feature-rich editors. The TeX 
distributions already provide the fine editor TeXworks, which I use. It can be set up together 
with TeX or with a package manager on Linux, and it can be downloaded from http://www.
tug.org/texworks/.
I have a collection of the links to LaTeX editors and additional software on my blog, http://
texblog.net/latex-link-archive/distribution-editor-viewer/, where you 
may look for alternative editors, which run on your operating system.
Additionally, there are pure online LaTeX editors, which run in a web browser, so you can use 
them even on tablets and smartphones. The most noticeable LaTeX editors are as follows:
f
f
https://www.overleaf.com, with real-time collaborative editing and a rich text 
modes which renders headings,  equations and further formatting directly in the 
editor
f
f
https://www.sharelatex.com, also with real-time collaboration and revision 
history for tracking changes
If you need any help in setting up and using LaTeX or any other editor, you can visit a LaTeX 
web forum. In Chapter 12, Getting Support on the Internet, you can find links to these forums 
and see and how to use them. You can also find me on those forums.
If you would like to get help in learning LaTeX, you may take a look at LaTeX Beginner's Guide 
at https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/latex-beginners-
guide.
Once you have done the installation, you can launch the editor and start with a LaTeX recipe.

The Variety of Document Types

Writing a short text
While LaTeX is great for big documents, it's just as useful for smaller ones, and you get all the 
features to work with. Writing down homework or producing a seminar handout, for example, 
doesn't need book-like chapters, and the layout would not be very spacious. So we will choose 
a document class that suits the task at hand best.
There are class bundles that cover commonly used document types. Every LaTeX installation 
contains the base bundle with standard classes. There are class files for articles, books, 
reports, letters, and more. It is stable stuff; it has not really been changed for many years. If 
you don't care about the latest style, this can be sufficient. It would even run on a ten-year-old 
LaTeX installation.
In this recipe, we will use a class of the KOMA-Script bundle. This is a set of classes that 
were originally designed with the aim of replacing the standard classes and providing more 
features. In contrast to the rather static base bundle, KOMA-Script has been extensively 
developed during recent years. It became feature-rich and got an excellent user interface. 
Parts of its functionality are provided in packages that can be used together with other 
classes as well. You can identify KOMA-Script classes and packages by the prefix scr. This 
prefix stands for script, which was the initial name of this bundle.
How to do it...
We will start with a complete small document, already using various features. This can be your 
template, into which you can add your own text later on.
While we go through the document step by step, you may open the complete code directly 
with your editor, so you don't need to type it. It is contained in the code bundle available at 
the book's page https://www.packtpub.com and at the book's page http://latex-
cookbook.net. Perform the following steps to create a small document:
1.	 Start with a document class. We will use the KOMA-Script class scrartcl, with 
A4 paper size, a base font size of 12 pt, and interparagraph spacing instead of the 
default paragraph indentation:
\documentclass[paper=a4,oneside,fontsize=12pt,
  parskip=full]{scrartcl}
2.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
3.	 Let LaTeX print a table of contents using this command:
\tableofcontents

Chapter 1
5
4.	 Start a section without numbering:
\addsec{Introduction}
5.	 Add some text:
This document will be our starting point for simple documents. It 
is suitable for a single page or up to a couple of dozen pages.
The text will be divided into sections.
6.	 Start an automatically numbered section with text:
\section{The first section}
This first text will contain
7.	
Add a bulleted list using an itemize environment. Each list item starts with \item. 
Using \ref{label}, we will refer to labels, which we will create later:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a table of contents,
  \item a bulleted list,
  \item headings and some text and math in section,
  \item referencing such as to section \ref{sec:maths} and
        equation (\ref{eq:integral}).
\end{itemize}
8.	 Continue with text and start another numbered section:
We can use this document as a template for filling in our own 
content.
\section{Some maths}
9.	 Set a label so that we can refer to this point whenever we want to refer to this section:
\label{sec:maths}
10.	 Continue with the text. We will start using some mathematical expressions in the text. 
We mark this by enclosing them in parentheses with a prefixing backslash, that is,  
\( … \).
When we write a scientific or technical document, we
usually include math formulas. To get a brief glimpse
of the look of maths, we will look at an integral
approximation of a function \( f(x) \) as a sum with
weights \( w_i \):

The Variety of Document Types
6
11.	 Write a mathematical equation using the equation environment. Again, place a 
label by using the following commands:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:integral}
  \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x \approx (b-a)
  \sum_{i=0}^n w_i f(x_i)
\end{equation}
12.	End the document:
\end{document}
13.	Compile the document. The first page of the output will look like this:

Chapter 1

How it works...
In the first line, we loaded the document class scrartcl. In square brackets, we set options 
for specifying an A4 paper size with one-sided printing and a font size of 12 pt. Finally, we 
chose to have a full line between paragraphs in the output so that we can easily distinguish 
paragraphs.
The default setting is no space between paragraphs and a small indentation 
at the beginning of each paragraph. Uncheck the parskip option to see 
it. We chose a paragraph skip because many people are used to it when 
working with e-mails, while indentation costs line space, which is a precious 
resource on small electronic devices.
Without further ado, we began the text with a table of contents. While numbered sections are 
started by the \section command, we can start unnumbered sections by using the starred 
version \section*. However, we used the KOMA-Script command \addsec for the first 
unnumbered section. That's because, in contrast with \section*, the \addsec command 
generates an entry in the table of contents.
An empty line tells LaTeX to make a paragraph break.
As bulleted lists are a good way to clearly present points, we used an itemize environment 
for this. All environments start with the \begin command and are ended with the \end 
command.
If you would like to have a numbered list, use the enumerate environment.
An equation environment has been used to display a formula that is automatically 
numbered. We used the \label command to set an invisible anchor mark so we could refer 
to it using its label name by the \ref command and get the equation number in the output.
Choosing label identifiers:
It is a good practice to use prefixes to identify kinds of labels, such as 
eq:name for equations, fig:name for figures, tab:name for tables, and 
so on. Avoid special characters in names, such as accented alphabets.
Small formulas within text lines have been enclosed in \( ... \), which provides inline 
math mode. Dollar symbols, $ ... $, can be used  instead of \( ... \), which makes 
typing easier. However, the use of parentheses makes it easier to understand where the math 
mode starts and where it ends, which may be beneficial when many math expressions are 
scattered throughout the text.

The part of the document before the \begin{document} command is called the preamble. 
It contains global settings. By adding a few lines to our document preamble, we can improve 
our document and modify the general appearance. Chapter 2, Tuning the Text, starts with 
additions that are beneficial for small documents as well. They enable the direct input of 
accented characters and unicode symbols, and they improve justification and hyphenation.
In Chapter 3, Adjusting Fonts, you can find recipes for changing the fonts of either the whole 
document or of certain elements.
For further customization tasks, such as modifying page layout, and adding a title page, refer 
to the recipe Designing a book in the current chapter. We will take a look at such settings on 
the occasion of a book example.
Writing a thesis
When you plan to write a large document like a thesis, you have two choices: either choose a 
ready-made template, or set up your own document environment. If you have got limited time 
and need to start off with your thesis fast, a template can come to the rescue.
Beware of outdated and questionable templates found somewhere on the Internet. Look  
first at the date and at user opinions, such as on web forums. The age of a template is not  
a problem by itself, as LaTeX can run it the same way when it's been written. However, as  
LaTeX has developed, better solutions have come up over time. Legacy code may not benefit 
from it.
Some universities provide their own templates. That may be ok, because requirements 
would be met for sure; just check if it can be improved; for example, by replacing an obsolete 
package with its recommended successors.
A very good source for checking the quality of a template is the guide to obsolete  
commands and packages in LaTeX2e, which is also called l2tabu. You can open the  
English version by typing the texdoc l2tabuen command in Command Prompt,  
or by visiting http://texdoc.net/pkg/l2tabuen.

To be clear, the LaTeX base is stable and solid, but there are changes in community-contributed 
packages.
In the previous recipe, Writing a short text, we took the bottom-up approach and built a 
document from scratch, adding what we desired. Now we will go top-down; let's use and 
understand a complete template, removing what we don't need.
As we need to choose a template now, let's take a real gem. The ClassicThesis package 
by Prof. André Miede is a thesis template of very good quality. The design follows the classic 
guide to writing, The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst, we will see some 
particular points later in this recipe. Its implementation is thoughtful and modern. Originally 
written in 2006, it's maintained today as well, and shipped with TeX distributions.
Even if you would not use this specific template later, it shows how we can organize a large 
document.
Getting ready
Though the ClassicThesis package may already be installed in your TeX system, named 
classicthesis.sty, the whole template is an archive of files that should go into your 
working directory.
Download the ClassicThesis archive from CTAN by visiting http://www.ctan.org/
tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/classicthesis/.
Instead of fetching single files, choose to download it as a .zip file. Unzip it to where you 
keep your personal documents, in its own directory. This directory will be your thesis directory.
This package provides a ready-made structured filesystem of the main document, style file, 
settings file, and document parts such as the abstract and foreword, and also chapters in 
dedicated files. You can edit all files and fill in your own text.
The ClassicThesis.tex file is the main document. Its filler text is the template's manual; 
this allows us to compile the template immediately for looking at the output design. By 
compiling, you can also verify that your TeX installation can handle additional packages  
if you need to install any.

How to do it...
After unzipping, your directory will have the following structure:
Now follow these steps:
1.	 Rename or copy the file ClassicThesis.tex; choose your own name, such as 
MyThesis.tex, but keep it in the same directory.
2.	 Open the main document, that is, MyThesis.tex, and look around to get a feeling 
of the document structure. Compile it for testing at least twice to get the correct 
referencing so you would know that this starting point works.

Chapter 1
11
3.	 You can review and edit the settings in the main file, MyThesis.tex, and in the 
configuration file, classicthesis-config.tex. Over the course of the following 
pages, we will examine their content.
4.	 Open the existing .tex files, such as Abstract.tex and Chapter01.tex, with 
your editor. Remove the filler text and type in your own text. Add further chapter files 
as needed, and include them in the main file, MyThesis.tex, using the \include 
command. The structure is given; the technical part of the editing is like cloning files 
and copying lines, all you need to focus on is the actual thesis content now.
Don't worry if the font or margins don't please you yet. You can change the layout at any time. 
Let's take a closer look now, and then you will know how.
How it works...
We will take a look at the functional lines of the main file, MyThesis.tex.
The document preamble is as follows:
\documentclass[ twoside,openright,titlepage,
                numbers=noenddot,headinclude,
                footinclude=true,cleardoublepage=empty,
                BCOR=5mm,paper=a4,fontsize=11pt,
                ngerman,american,%
                ]{scrreprt}
\input{classicthesis-config}
The template is built on the KOMA-Script class, scrreprt. KOMA-Script as a LaTeX bundle is 
described in this chapter's first recipe, Writing a short text.
You can change the preset options to those you need, such as the font size or binding 
correction BCOR. There are many class options for adjusting the layout; you can read about 
them in the KOMA-Script manual. Type texdoc scrguien in Command prompt, or visit 
http://texdoc.net/pkg/scrguien. We will discuss some of them in depth in our next 
recipe, Designing a book.
Loading of packages and all the remaining settings is done in a single file, classicthesis-
config.tex. We will look at it later in this recipe.
The document body starts with the following commands:
\begin{document}
\frenchspacing
\raggedbottom
\selectlanguage{american}
\pagenumbering{roman}
\pagestyle{plain}

The Variety of Document Types
12
The \frenchspacing line means that there's a single space following the punctuation after 
a sentence. Before the twentieth century, people stuffed extra space between sentences. 
LaTeX does this by default, or you can enter the \nonfrenchspacing line. The language 
is set to American English. Actually, you would need the \selectlanguage line only if you 
need to switch between languages for correct hyphenation.
We start with Roman page numbers. The plain page style means that we have no page 
headers for now, while page numbers are centered in the page footer.
Then, we look at the front matter, which is the part of the document where the formal parts 
before the actual content go:
\include{FrontBackmatter/DirtyTitlepage}
\include{FrontBackmatter/Titlepage}
\include{FrontBackmatter/Titleback}
\cleardoublepage\include{FrontBackmatter/Dedication}
%\cleardoublepage\include{FrontBackmatter/Foreword}
\cleardoublepage\include{FrontBackmatter/Abstract}
\cleardoublepage\include{FrontBackmatter/Publication}
\cleardoublepage\include{FrontBackmatter/Acknowledgments}
\pagestyle{scrheadings}
\cleardoublepage\include{FrontBackmatter/Contents}
Each commonly-required part of the front matter has its own file. Just edit the file as you need 
it, comment out by inserting a % symbol at the beginning of a line, or remove what you don't 
need. The \cleardoublepage line ends a page, but also ensures that the next page starts 
on the right-hand side. This can mean inserting an empty page if necessary; that is, a double 
page break. This will not happen if you change the twoside option to oneside, so you can 
keep the \cleardoublepage line, which will act like a \clearpage command when the 
oneside option is set.
Finally, we got the main matter:
\pagenumbering{arabic}
%\setcounter{page}{90}
% use \cleardoublepage here to avoid problems with pdfbookmark
\cleardoublepage
\part{Some Kind of Manual}
\include{Chapters/Chapter01}
\cleardoublepage

Chapter 1
13
\ctparttext{You can put some informational part preamble text  
here...}
\part{The Showcase}
\include{Chapters/Chapter02}
\include{Chapters/Chapter03}
In the main matter, we use Arabic page numbers. The \pagenumbering line resets the page 
number to 0.
The thesis is divided into parts. Each one is split into chapters. You can omit the \part lines 
if you want your highest sectioning level to be the chapter level.
In the Chapters subdirectory, each chapter has its own .tex file; so, you can easily handle a 
large amount of text. Furthermore, you can use the \includeonly command to compile just 
the selected chapters for speeding up writing.
Finally, the main document ends with the back matter:
\appendix
\cleardoublepage
\part{Appendix}
\include{Chapters/Chapter0A}
%***************************************************************** 
***
% Other Stuff in the Back
%*******************************************************
\cleardoublepage\include{FrontBackmatter/Bibliography}
\cleardoublepage\include{FrontBackmatter/Colophon}
\cleardoublepage\include{FrontBackmatter/Declaration}
\end{document}
The command \appendix resets the sectioning counters and changes them to alphabetic 
numbering, that is, the following chapters will be numbered A, B, and so on. Like in the front 
matter, the parts of the appendix are divided into several files.
Let's take a look at the configuration file. Open the classicthesis-config.tex file.  
The whole thing would take too much space in the book, so let's just take a look at some 
sample lines:
\newcommand{\myTitle}{A Classic Thesis Style\xspace}
\newcommand{\myName}{Andr\'e Miede\xspace}
\newcommand{\myUni}{Put data here\xspace}
\newcommand{\myLocation}{Darmstadt\xspace}
\newcommand{\myTime}{August 2012\xspace}

Here, you can fill in your own data. Besides being printed on the title page, this data will 
be used as metadata for the generated PDF document. There are more supported macros 
here, such as \mySubtitle, \myProf, and many more. The \xspace takes care of proper 
spacing after such a macro; that is, it inserts a space when there's no punctuation mark 
following it.
There's more...
As mentioned, this template contains design decisions inspired by the book The Elements of 
Typographical Style by Robert Bringhurst. The most notable design decisions are as follows:
f
f
It doesn't use bold fonts, but rather uses small caps or italics elegantly to emphasize 
what's important.
f
f
The text body is not very wide and this allows it to be read comfortably without 
needing the eyes to jump too far from the end of the line to the beginning of the next 
line. So, we have wide margins, which can be used for notes.
f
f
The table of contents is not stretched to get right-aligned page numbers. To quote the 
author, "Is your reader interested in the page number or does she/he want to sum the 
numbers up?". That's why the page number follows the title.
Explore the classicthesis-config.tex file further to make modifications. Like in the 
previous recipe, we apply document-wide changes within the preamble, and here, we do it in 
this file.
We will now take a look at the selected lines of that configuration file.
Changing the input encoding
You might have noticed that special characters, such as accented characters, don't work 
directly in the input. Scroll to this line:
\PassOptionsToPackage{latin9}{inputenc}
\usepackage{inputenc}
This is another way of setting the input encoding. Refer to the recipe Inputting accented 
characters in Chapter 2, Tuning the Text, to understand the topic of encoding. Here, you 
should change the latin9 option to utf8 if you wish to use an UTF-8-capable system and 
editor. The latin9 option is typically used by older editors on Windows. There are other 
encodings. If you would need another one, use texdoc inputenc, or visit http://
texdoc.net/pkg/inputenc to take a look at the available options.

Chapter 1
15
Getting a right-justified table of contents
The design is not set in stone, you may adjust it all. If you would like to see the page numbers 
in the table of contents right aligned, set a single option. Look at the very beginning of the 
classicthesis-config.tex file:
\PassOptionsToPackage{eulerchapternumbers,listings,drafting,%
  pdfspacing,%floatperchapter,%linedheaders,%
  subfig,beramono,eulermath,parts}{classicthesis}
Here, you can find the options for the actual classicthesis package. Simply add 
the dottedtoc option to this comma separated list. These options, among others, are 
documented in the template's manual. You can open it by typing texdoc classicthesis in 
Command Prompt, or at http://texdoc.net/pkg/classicthesis. (editor: please apply 
inline code formatting correctly, and URL formatting)
Changing the margins
To fulfill requirements of page margins or to implement your own layout ideas, you can specify 
exact page dimensions by loading the geometry package. Consider the following example:
\usepackage[inner=1.5cm,outer=3cm,top=2cm,bottom=2cm,
  bindingoffset=5mm]{geometry}
Here, you can also provide a value for the space that you leave for the binding and all margins 
you like. It's good practice to have a visible inner margin set to half the value of the outer 
margin, because margins will be added in the middle. For single-sided printing, with the 
oneside option, use left=... and right=... for the defining the margins instead of 
inner and outer.
Place such a line at the end of the classicthesis-config.tex file so that it will override 
the original settings.
Modifying the layout of captions
In the classicthesis-config.tex file, you can change the appearance of captions of 
figures and tables:
\usepackage{caption}
\captionsetup{format=hang,font=small}
The template loads the caption package. It provides a lot of features for fine-tuning captions. 
For now, the caption texts are indented so they will hang under the first line, and they will have 
a smaller font size than the normal text. By adding simple options, you can further adjust the 
appearance; for example, by adding the labelfont=it line, you can get italicized caption 
labels. Refer to the caption manual to learn more. As usual, you can open it via texdoc 
caption or at http://texdoc.net/pkg/caption.

The Variety of Document Types
16
While the caption package is a general solution working with most 
classes, including KOMA-Script, the KOMA-Script now offers extended 
integrated caption features.
Centering displayed equations
Another option is responsible for the alignment of displayed equations:
\PassOptionsToPackage{fleqn}{amsmath} 
\usepackage{amsmath}
With these ClassicThesis lines displayed equations will be left aligned. The fleqn option 
allows switching to this alignment. If you would like to restore the default behavior, which is 
centering the equations, remove that first line that passes the option, or comment it out by  
a % symbol. But keep the second line, though, which loads the amsmath option, as this is  
the de-facto standard package for typesetting mathematics in LaTeX.
You can find further thesis templates at http://www.latextemplates.com.

In the following chapters, you can find a lot of recipes for content elements in your thesis. For 
a beautiful thesis, elegant tables are of great value, so you may also want to take a look at the 
Advanced table design recipe in Chapter 5, Beautiful Designs.
Designing a book
A book can be a pretty large document, so we can take a similar approach to the one we took 
in the preceding recipe. Refer to that recipe to see how to split your document into handy files 
and how to organize the directory structure.
Commonly, books are printed two sided. They are divided into chapters, which start on  
right-hand side pages, and they have pretty spacy headings and often a page header showing 
the current chapter title. Readability and good typography are important, so you will hardly find 
books with an A4 paper size, double-line spacing, and similar specs, which some institutes 
expect of a thesis. This is why we have dedicated book classes with meaningful default 
settings and features.

How to do it...
As explained in the Writing a short text recipe, our choice will be a KOMA-Script class; only, 
this time it has the name scrbook.
Perform these steps to start off a book:
1.	 Start with the scrbook class and suitable options for paper and font size:
\documentclass[fontsize=11pt,paper=a5,
  pagesize=auto]{scrbook}
2.	 Specify the input encoding, which will depend on your editor settings:
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
3.	 Choose a font encoding. T1 is good for European, English, or American texts:
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
4.	 If you want a nondefault font, load it. Here, we chose Latin Modern:
\usepackage{lmodern}
5.	 We will load the blindtext package to get English dummy texts. It also requires you 
to load babel with the English setting:
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{blindtext}
6.	 Load the microtype package for better text justification:
\usepackage{microtype}
7.	
Using this command, you can switch off the additional space after sentence 
punctuation:
\frenchspacing
8.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
9.	 Provide a title, a subtitle, an author name, and a date. You can also set an empty 
value if you don't want to have something in the title field:
\title{The Book}
\subtitle{Some more to know}
\author{The Author}
\date{}

The Variety of Document Types
18
10.	 Let LaTeX print the title page:
\maketitle
11.	 Print out the table of contents:
\tableofcontents 
12.	We will divide this book in to parts, so start with the first part:
\part{First portion}
13.	Start a chapter with a heading. It's good to have text before adding another heading, 
so let's insert some:
\chapter{The beginning}
Some introductional text comes here.
14.	 As we did in our first recipe, add a section and text, and another part with a chapter 
and section. Using the \Blindtext command, you can generate a long dummy text, 
and using \blindtext,  you can generate shorter dummy texts. The \appendix 
command switches the font to alphabetic numbering:
\section{A first section}
Dummy text will follow.
\blindtext
\section{Another section}
\Blindtext
\appendix
\part{Appendix}
\chapter{An addendum}
\section{Section within the appendix}
\blindtext
15.	End the document:
\end{document}
16.	 Let your editor compile the text to PDF. You will get a 13-page-long book document 
with A5 paper size, a title page, part pages, chapter, section headings, and filler text.

Chapter 1
19
Take a look at the following sample page:
Note the headings in sans serif font. This is an intentional default setting in KOMA-
Script classes, which makes the headings lighter than the standard LaTeX big, bold, 
and serif headings. You may know the standard look.
17.	 Now, you can fill in your own text, add chapters and sections, and possibly add 
features, which will be described later in this recipe.

How it works...
At first, we loaded the class scrbook, which was specifically made for writing books.  
So, it is ready for two-sided printing with meaningful margins and good proportions of 
headings and text.
Besides the class's default settings, we chose a font size of 11 pt and A5 paper size, which  
is handy for a book. The pagesize=auto option is important here as it ensures that the  
A5 printing area will be taken over to the PDF page size.
Then, we did the following things, which will be explained in more detail at the beginning  
of Chapter 2, Tuning the Text:
f
f
We declared the input character encoding and chose UTF-8, Unicode
f
f
We set the font encoding to T1 by loading the fontenc package
f
f
We chose the high-quality T1 supporting font set Latin Modern by loading the 
lmodern package
f
f
We loaded the babel package with support for English
f
f
We used the microtype package to get finer typography
The last package we loaded is the blindtext. You don't need it in your final document;  
here, it will serve us to provide filler text. Using such dummy text, we can get a better idea  
of the final result before writing the actual content.
Finally, we switched to the so-called French spacing, which means that after ending a 
sentence, we will get a normal interword space, not a wider space.
There's more...
You can change the layout of the book in many ways. Choose your settings at the beginning,  
or even better—start writing your content without any hesitation—once you have a decent 
amount of text, you can better see the effects of layout changes. You can do this at any time. 
Let's take a look at some design ideas.
Changing the page layout
When the book is bound after printing, the binding can cost space, that is, there may be 
less of the inner margin visible. You can specify a binding correction to compensate and to 
preserve layout proportions. So, if you would see 5 mm less of the inner margin after binding, 
add BCOR=5mm as class the option at the beginning. A similarly produced book may give you 
an idea of a good value.

Chapter 1
21
The actual text area has the same ratios as the page itself. This is automatically done by a 
dividing construction, described in the KOMA-Script manual. It's really worth reading. You 
can open it by typing the texdoc scrguien command in Command Prompt, or online at 
http://texdoc.net/pkg/scrguien. The abbreviation, scrguien, comes from scr for 
the original package name Script, gui for guide, and en for English, and, obviously, from the 
ancient limit of eight characters per file name in older filesystems.
Besides the page and text area ratios, the result shows a bottom margin twice as high as 
the top margin, and an outer margin with double the width of the inner margin. Imagine an 
opened book, where the inner margins together appear with the same space as an outer 
margin. Sometimes, people make the mistake of thinking that the inner margin should be 
much bigger because of the binding, but that's done by raising the BCOR, as shown previously.
If you would like to get a bigger text area, which means narrower margins, you can still keep the 
ratios as described. Just raise the division factor of the aforementioned internal construction 
and check whether or not it would suit you. For example, set the class option as DIV=10; higher 
values are possible. That's a safe and easy way to preserve sane layout proportions.
To sum up, our example with 5 mm binding loss and pretty narrow margins can start like this:
\documentclass[fontsize=11pt,paper=a5,pagesize=auto,
  BCOR=5mm,DIV=12]{scrbook}
Alternatively, you can freely choose text and margin dimensions, when requirements of the 
publisher or institute need to be met. This can be done by loading the classic geometry 
package with the desired measurements, like we saw in the Writing a thesis recipe:
\usepackage[inner=1.5cm,outer=3cm,top=2cm,bottom=4cm,
  bindingoffset=5mm]{geometry}
Designing a title page
You can create your own title page, to present some more information in any style you desire. 
Let's take a look at an example that shows some handy commands for it.
Remove the \maketitle command. You can do the same thing with the commands \title, 
\subtitle, \author, and \date. Instead, put the titlepage environment right after the 
\begin{document} block:
\begin{titlepage}
  \vspace*{1cm}
  {\huge\raggedright The Book\par}
  \noindent\hrulefill\par
  {\LARGE\raggedleft The Author\par}
  \vfill
  {\Large\raggedleft Institute\par}
\end{titlepage}

The Variety of Document Types
22
The titlepage environment creates a page without a page number on it. We started with 
some vertical space using the \vspace* command. The \vspace command adds vertical 
space, which can be of a positive or negative value. Here, note the star at the end; * \vspace 
also works at the very beginning of a page, where a simple \vspace would be ignored. This 
default behavior prevents undesired vertical space at the top of a page, which originally may 
have been intended as space between texts.
We enclosed each line in curly braces. This is also called grouping, and it is used to keep 
the effect of changes, such as the font size, local within the braces. In each line, we do the 
following:
f
f
Switch to a certain font size
f
f
Choose left or right alignment
f
f
Write out the text
f
f
End with a paragraph break
The \par command is equivalent to an empty line in the input. Sometimes, people use it to 
keep the code compact, as we did here. We need to end the paragraph before the font size 
changes because that size defines the space between lines. Hence, we ended the paragraph 
before we closed the brace group. It's good to keep this in mind for when texts are longer.
Our only nontext design element is a modest horizontal line made by the \hrulefill line. 
The preceding \noindent line just prevents an undesired paragraph indentation, so the line 
really starts at the very left.
The \vfill line inserts stretching vertical space, so we get the last line pushed down to the 
title page bottom.
We took this occasion to show some commands for positioning text on a page. You can 
experiment with the \vspace and \vfill commands and their horizontal companions  
\hspace and \hfill. Just avoid using such commands to fix local placement issues in the 
actual document, when it would be better to adjust a class or package setting document wide. 
Use these only in the final stage to make tweaks if any are required.
The titlepages package provides 40 example title pages in various 
designs with full LaTeX source code. You can choose one, use it, and 
customize it.
Adding a cover page
The title page, which we produced previously, is actually an inner page. That's why it follows 
the normal page layout with the same inner and outer margin as the body text.

Chapter 1
23
The cover is different, for example, it should have symmetric margins, and it can be 
designed according to your preference or individual choice. To get that deviating layout, it is 
recommended that you use a separate document for it. Another reason is that it will usually 
be printed on a different type of paper or cardboard.
So, you can start with an article-like class like the one we used in our first recipe, Writing  
a short text. Use options such as twoside=false or the equivalent oneside option to  
get symmetric margins. Then, you can proceed to positioning your text like we did with  
the title page.
Changing the document class
A very well designed book class is memoir. It is pretty complete in itself, so you don't need 
to load many packages as it already integrates a lot of features of other packages, providing 
similar interfaces. The memoir class has a monolithic, easy-to-use approach, but it needs to 
take care of package conflicts. It is not as flexible as choosing the package set by yourself. 
KOMA-Script, in contrast, provides its features mostly in packages that can also be used 
together with other classes. You can change to memoir this way:
1.	 Start off with the memoir class by changing the first line to the following:
\documentclass[11pt,a5paper]{memoir}
2.	 Remove the unsupported \subtitle command.
3.	 To have the title on its own page, surround the \maketitle line with a 
titlingpage environment:
\begin{titlingpage}
\maketitle
\end{titlingpage}
4.	 Compile, and compare.
The memoir class provides an extensive manual that can help you to customize your 
document. It's split in two parts. Type the texdoc memman command in Command Prompt 
to read the actual manual, and the texdoc memdesign command to read the part on 
book design, which is a great resource independent of the class. Alternatively, you can find 
these manuals at http://texdoc.net/pkg/memman and http://texdoc.net/pkg/
memdesign respectively.
Another great start with a special beauty is the tufte-latex class. It comes with a sample-
book.tex file, which you can also download from http://ctan.org/tex-archive/
macros/latex/contrib/tufte-latex. You can open this book file, which contains some 
dummy content, and fill in your own text. One of its outstanding features is a wide margin for 
extensive use of side notes and small figures in the margin.

Creating a presentation
At a conference or at a seminar, speakers often use a projector or a screen for presenting 
written information in addition to what they are addressing. Such a presentation document 
requires a specific kind of layout and features.
In our recipe, we will use the beamer class, which has been designed specifically for this 
purpose. It provides the following features:
f
f
A typical landscape slide format, here 128 mm x 96 mm
f
f
Structured frames with dynamic information; for example, about sectioning

f
Support for overlays and transition effects

A smart interface for customizing
How to do it...
We will start off with a sample presentation document, which we can extend. Follow the given 
steps:
1.	 Start with the beamer document class:
\documentclass{beamer}
2.	 Choose a theme. Here, we take the theme called Warsaw:
\usetheme{Warsaw}
3.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Provide a title, subtitle, the names of the author and the institute, and a date:
\title{Talk on the Subject}
\subtitle{What this is about}
\author{Author Name}
\institute{University of X}
\date{June 24, 2015}

Chapter 1

5.	 Make a slide using the frame environment. The first one will contain the title page:
\begin{frame}
  \titlepage
\end{frame}
6.	 Make a frame for the table of contents, with the title Outline. Add the option 
pausesections, so the table of contents will be shown stepwise, section by section:
\begin{frame}{Outline}
  \tableofcontents[pausesections]
\end{frame}
7.	
Start a section and a subsection within it:
\section{Introduction}
\subsection{A subsection}
8.	 All visible content goes into the frame environment, including lists, which are visually 
better than normal text in a presentation:
\begin{frame}{Very Informative Title}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item First thing to say.
    \item There is more.
    \item Another short point.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
9.	 This frame will show an emphasized block with the title:
\begin{frame}{Another Title With Uppercased Words}
  Text
  \begin{alertblock}{A highlighted block}
    Some important information put into a block.
  \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}
10.	 Add another subsection with a frame with a titled block. Also, add a new section 
with a slide containing a list. We have highlighted some words by using the \alert 
command. Finally, end the document:
\subsection{Another subsection}
\begin{frame}{Informative Title}
  \begin{exampleblock}{An example}
    An example within a block.
  \end{exampleblock}

  \end{itemize}
  \vfill
  \begin{block}{Outlook}
    Further ideas here.

\end{frame}
\end{document}
11.	 Compile, and take a look at the slides we have produced:

Chapter 1
27
12.	Adjust the title, name of the author, and date.
13.	Edit the text in the frames. Add your own frames with titles and text. Use the 
components you found here, such as bulleted lists and boxes.
How it works...
We loaded the beamer class and chose the theme with the name Warsaw. You can easily 
replace it with another theme's name, compile it, and cycle through the themes until you find 
the best one for your occasion. By default, the following themes are installed:

You can see these themes in the gallery at http://latex-beamer.net. We specified the 
title, subtitle, author, and date of the seminar, which is then printed by \titlepage. We used 
a frame environment, which we have to use for each slide.
The next frame contains the table of contents. We provided the frame title Outline as an 
argument to the frame in curly braces. For the \tableofcontents command, we added the 
pausesections option. As a result of doing this, section titles are printed one-by-one with a 
pause in between. This gives us the opportunity to explain what the audience will hear before 
they read further.
Here, we used the \section and \subsection commands just like in a normal LaTeX 
document. The heading is not directly printed. The sections and subsections are printed in the 
frame margin with the current position highlighted.
To get a bulleted list, we used an itemize environment just as we would in a normal 
LaTeX document. The environments enumerate for numbered lists and description for 
descriptive lists also work in the beamer frames.
To highlight information, we used the so-called block environments. Besides the standard 
block environment, we can use the exampleblock and alertblock commands to get a 
different style or color. The chosen theme determines the appearance of those blocks.
The \alert command is used to emphasize more distinctly, as seen in the last frame.
Now, you have the template and tools to create your presentation.

Consider the following while designing a presentation:
f
f
Keep time constraints in mind; a frame per minute is a good rule 
of thumb.
f
f
Use few sections, logically split in subsections; it is better to avoid 
subsubsections.
f
f
Use self-explanatory titles for sectioning and frames.
f
f
Bulleted lists help to keep things simple.
f
f
Consider avoiding numbering references; one rarely cares about a 
reference to theorem 2.6 during a talk.
f
f
Don't disrupt the reading flow with footnotes.
f
f
Graphics, such as diagrams, help the audience with visualization.
f
f
Slides should support your talk, not the other way round. Did you 
already bear with a presentation where the speaker just read 
aloud the text from the slides and used fancy transition effects? 
You can do it better.
There's more...
The beamer package has unique capabilities and an extraordinary design. We will explore  
it in the following pages.
Using short titles and names
Besides the title page, the title of the presentation and the author's name are additionally 
printed at the bottom of each frame. The exact position depends upon the chosen theme.
However, for long titles or names, the space might be insufficient. You can provide short 
versions to be used in such places, for example, by specifying the following commands:
\title[Short title]{Long Informative Title}
\author[Shortened name]{Author's Complete Name}
\date[2015/06/24]{Conference on X at Y, June 24, 2015}
The same is possible for the \institute and \subtitle commands, if you would use 
these commands in your presentation.
You can provide short names for sections and subsections in exactly the same way, so they 
would better fit into their field within the frame margin; just use the optional argument in 
square brackets. The \part and \subsubsection commands work similarly, they can  
get a short name in square brackets as well.

Uncovering information piecewise
Showing a complete slide at once may be a bit distracting. People may read ahead instead of 
listening to you. You can take them by the hand by displaying the content step by step.
The simplest way is to insert a \pause command. It can go between anything such as text, 
graphics, and blocks. It also works between two \item commands in a bulleted list; however, 
consider pausing between whole lists instead of items. Simply use it like we will do in the 
following line of code:
Text\pause more text\pause\includegraphics{filename}
Such a frame is then layered; that is, divided into overlays. They are internally numbered. If 
you would like to show something at a certain overlay, you can tell the beamer package when 
to uncover it:
\uncover<3->{Surprise!}
This shows your text on slide 3 of the current frame; and it will stay on the following slides 
in that frame. Omit the dash for restricting it to only slide 3. You can also list multiple slides, 
such as <3,5>, give ranges such as <3-5>, and mix the two, as in <3,5->.
This syntax works with overlay-specification-aware commands. Among them, there are \item, 
\includegraphics, and even \renewcommand, so you can use them with an overlay 
specification such as the following:
\includegraphics<3->{filename}
Overlays should not be too fancy. A presentation needs a linear structure; complicated 
overlays may be handy for showing and hiding annotation to an object, while you explain that.
Refer to the beamer manual for more information on using overlays. You can open that manual 
via texdoc beamer in Command Prompt, or online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/beamer.
Splitting frames in columns
You can arrange text and images in multiple columns on a frame. This is especially handy for 
images with explanatory text. Let's take a look at a sample:
\begin{frame}
  Some text which can use whole frame width
  \begin{columns}[t]
    \begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
      Sample text in\\
      two lines
    \end{column}
    \begin{column}[T]{0.45\textwidth}

Chapter 1
31
      \includegraphics[width=3cm]{filename}
    \end{column}
  \end{columns}
\end{frame}
We started the multicolumn area using the column environment. You can specify alignment 
options t, b, or c for top, bottom, or centered alignment of the column. Centered is the 
default. While t aligns at the baseline of the first line, which is common in LaTeX, there's a 
handy additional option, T, which aligns at the very top.
Each column is created by the column environment. The column width is given as an 
argument. It understands the same positioning options, so you can override what you set in 
the surrounding columns environment. We added the [T] option here, because an image has 
its baseline at its bottom, and we want to change it to the very top.
Showing an outline for each section
You can tell the beamer package to give an outline at the beginning of each section by 
specifying the following code:
\AtBeginSection{
  \begin{frame}{Outline}
    \tableofcontents[currentsection]
  \end{frame}}
You can also use the \AtBeginSection command to insert different lines of code. 
If something should happen in case of a starred \section* too, you can insert the 
corresponding code within an optional argument in square brackets after \AtBeginSection.
Removing the navigation symbols
By default, every slide shows small navigation symbols; here, at the bottom of a frame. If 
you don't need them, you can save that space and reduce the distraction by specifying the 
following line of code:
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}
Changing the font
The default font set with the beamer package is Computer Modern. You can change it to other 
fonts as discussed in Chapter 3, Adjusting Fonts.
The default font is sans serif. Even the math formulas are sans serif. With a low projector 
resolution, or at some distance, this can be more readable than with a serif font.

The Variety of Document Types
32
However, if you would like to change to a serif font, you can load the corresponding font theme 
in the preamble:
\usefonttheme{serif}
Another available font theme is professionalfonts, which actually doesn't change fonts, 
but simply uses the set you specify separately. Furthermore, there are structurebold, 
structureitalicserif, and structuresmallcapsserif, which change the font in the 
structure, that is, in headlines, footlines, and sidebars, to such a shape combination.
Changing the color
The quickest way to change colors is by loading a theme with a thoughtful selection of colors 
for the various structure elements. Use a single command as follows:
\usecolortheme{dolphin}
There are outer color themes, providing a color set for headlines, footlines, and sidebars. 
The author of the beamer package gave them sea animal names: dolphin, whale, and 
seahorse. Then, there are inner color themes for elements, such as color blocks, with names 
of flowers: lily, orchid, and rose. Combine inner and outer color themes as you like.
Finally, there are complete themes covering all structure aspects: albatross, beaver, 
beetle, crane, dove, fly, monarca, seagull, spruce, and wolverine. They are named 
after flying animals, except wolverine, beaver and spruce, which are external additions.
A lot of names, you may go through them using the \usecolortheme command to find the 
color set you like the most.
Loading a theme from the Internet
With some labor, you can create your very own theme. The extensive beamer manual will 
guide you. However, you may save a lot of time; beamer is very popular among academic 
users, who already use LaTeX for their papers, so you can find a lot of themes prepared for 
universities and institutes, but also designed by various beamer users.
You can find an overview of beamer themes at http://latex-beamer.net.
Explore the gallery there, download the theme you like, add your logo, and tweak it. 
Instructions for using the themes that are available on the website.
Providing a handout
You can give your audience a printed version of the slides. Just create a version of your 
document with the handout option, so no overlays will be used:
\documentclass[handout]{beamer}

Chapter 1
33
Slides are commonly small, so it's good to print several slides on a single page:
\usepackage{pgfpages}
\pgfpagesuselayout{4 on 1}[a4paper,
  border shrink=5mm,landscape]
This prints four slides on an A4 page in landscape. You can get bigger prints, two slides on 
each page, in portrait mode, by specifying the following line of code:
\pgfpagesuselayout{2 on 1}[a4paper,border shrink=5mm]
We used the pgfpages option, a utility package that comes with the pgf package.

For the best quality with included graphics, refer to Chapter 4, Working with Images.  
In Chapter 9, Creating Graphics, you can find recipes for quickly creating diagrams  
and charts, which are good tools for visualizing data in a presentation.
Designing a curriculum vitae
Tabular layouts are very common today for the Curriculum Vitae (CV). When applying for a job, 
inform yourself about the typical requirements of the content of a CV. You can then create a 
simple document with tables, consistently and clearly readable.
If it needs to be made quickly or if you would like to base it upon a proven modern layout, you 
can use a template. In this recipe, we will use the moderncv class and its template to quickly 
produce a CV.
Getting ready
If it's not already installed on your computer, download and install moderncv from CTAN 
(http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/moderncv).
If your TeX installation provides a package manager, use it for the installation.
There's a directory of examples, containing templates which you can use. Either locate  
it in the documentation branch of your TeX directory tree, or visit the preceding CTAN link  
for downloading.

How to do it...
We will start using a sample file provided by the moderncv package. Perform these steps:
1.	 Copy the file template.tex, into your document directory and rename it. Choose 
any name you like. I named it as MyCV.tex.
2.	 Open that document, that is, MyCV.tex, and look around to understand the 
template. Luckily, it is full of comments on how to use it. Compile it to ensure that this 
document works.
3.	 Review and edit the class and package options in MyThesis.tex.
4.	 Remove the filler text and type in your own data. At the beginning, your document may 
look like this:
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper,sans]{moderncv}
\moderncvstyle{classic}
\moderncvcolor{blue}
\usepackage[scale=0.75]{geometry}

How it works...
We loaded the moderncv package. We used 11 pt as the base font size; 10 pt and 12 pt are 
also supported. We selected A4 paper; other paper size options are a5paper, letterpaper, 
legalpaper, and executivepaper. You can also add the landscape option. We chose a 
sans serif font, which is fine for such lists; alternatively, you could write Roman alphabets for a 
serif font.
We selected the classic style. Other available styles are casual, oldstyle, and banking.
Our color style is blue. Other color options are orange, green, red, purple, gray, and 
black.
We loaded the geometry package with a scaling factor for reducing the margins.
Using macros such as the \name and \address, we entered our personal data.
The \photo command includes our photo; the size options are the height to which it is scaled 
and the thickness of the frame around the photo. In this recipe, we used the CTAN lion drawn 
by Duane Bibby for the photo.
The document body is divided into sections and subsections, just with a special design.
Then, the \cventry command makes a typical resume entry for job or education. Use it as 
follows:
\cventry[spacing]{years}{job title}
  {employer}{localization}{detail}{job description}
Otherwise, you can use the following:
\cventry[spacing]{years}{degree}
  {institution}{localization}{grade}{comment}
You can leave the last four arguments empty if you don't need them.
A simpler line is created using \cvitem, as follows:
\cvitem[optional spacing length{header}{text}
The \cvitemwithcomment command works in a similar way, just with another argument 
that is printed at the right.
If you are looking for deeper information beyond this quick start guide, some more commands 
and options are explained in the very well-documented template.tex file, as well as in the 
class file moderncv.cls itself.

The template file contains a letter template that you can use for an application. Another 
approach is explained in the next recipe.
Writing a letter
Letters have a specific structure. Commonly, they have an addressee field at a fixed position, 
which should be visible in the envelope window. It also should show a back address, of yourself 
as the sender. An opening text and a closing phrase are usual elements, and you may add fold 
marks and enclosures.
How to do it...
We will use a KOMA-Script class, which has been specifically designed for letters, named 
scrlttr2. Take a look at the following steps:
1.	 Use the scrlttr2 class, activate the address field and fold marks using the options 
as follows, and align the sender's address to the right:
\documentclass[addrfield=true,foldmarks=true,
  fromalign=right]{scrlttr2}
2.	 Provide your name and your address using the \setkomavar command:
\setkomavar{fromname}{Thomas Smith}
\setkomavar{fromaddress}{123 Blvd \\ City, CC 12345}
3.	 Write a date, either \today for today, or any date as text:
\date{\today}
4.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
5.	 Open a letter environment, with the recipient's address as an argument:
\begin{letter}{Agency \\ 5th Avenue \\
               Capital City, CC 12345}
6.	 Start with an opening, and let your letter text follow:
\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}
the actual content of the letter follows.
7.	
End with closing words:
\closing{Yours sincerely}

The Variety of Document Types
38
8.	 End the letter environment and the document:
\end{letter}
\end{document}
9.	 Compile the document. Here is the upper part of the output:
That was pretty easy! You got a fully fledged formal letter with addressing information, an 
envelope window support, date of writing, phrases, signature, and even fold marks.
Now you can enter the real addresses and the actual letter text.
How it works...
When loading the letter class scrlttr2, we activated the address field, switched on fold 
marks, and set the options for aligning the sender's address to the right.
The scrlttr2 class is quite different from other classes, so it has a special interface.  
Using the \setkomavar command, we set the content of class variables, similar to the  
\renewcommand command. Here, we set the name and address. The KOMA-Script manual 
explains all the available variables. As mentioned in the recipe Writing a book, you can open 
it by typing the texdoc scrguien command in Command Prompt, or online at http://
texdoc.net/pkg/scrguien.

Chapter 1
39
We used a letter environment for the actual content, including the opening and closing 
phrases. The address is a mandatory argument for that environment. You can have several 
letter environments in a single document.
There's more...
For improving input and hyphenation, and for changing the font, take a look at the first recipe 
in Chapter 2, Tuning the Text.
Let's take a look at some letter specific options.
Separating paragraphs
Instead of indenting the beginnings of paragraphs, you can indicate a paragraph break with 
an empty line instead. For this, simply add the following option to the comma-separated list  
of class options at the beginning:
parskip=full
Use the parskip=half option for less space between paragraphs.
Changing the signature
If you would like to use a signature that is different from your specified name for the address, 
you can modify the corresponding variable content in the preamble:
\setkomavar{signature}{Thomas}
It would be indented. You can get it left-aligned by specifying the following code:
\renewcommand{\raggedsignature}{\raggedright}
The preceding code also belongs to the preamble.
Adding enclosures
If you wish to add enclosures to your letter, it's a common practice to mention them. You can 
do this by inserting an \encl command right before the \end{letter} command:
\encl{Curriculum vitae, certificates}
You can change the default encl: if you like by modifying the corresponding variable before 
calling the \encl option:
\setkomavar*{enclseparator}{Attached}
We used the starred version, \setkomavar*, which modifies the description of a variable 
instead of its content, which actually is :, that is, a colon followed by a space.

Producing a leaflet
Flyers are a common way to promote an event or to inform about a product. In particular, a 
folded leaflet is very handy as a giveaway and to carry around, so let's see how to produce one.
How to do it...
The intended layout is very different compared to the already shown document types. 
Fortunately, there's a document class for it with the name leaflet, which we will use now. 
Let's start filling it with some content. Let's take a look at the following steps:
1.	 Start with the leaflet document class. Choose a base font size of 10 pt, and set 
the option notumble, which keeps the back side printed in the same direction:
\documentclass[10pt,notumble]{leaflet}
2.	 Use an extended font encoding:
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
3.	 If you want a nondefault font, load it, this time we chose the Linux Libertine font:
\usepackage{libertine}
4.	 Switch to sans serif as the default font family:
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
5.	 For better text justification, load the microtype package:
\usepackage{microtype}
6.	 Load the graphicx package to include a picture:
\usepackage{graphicx}
7.	
Switch off the page numbering:
\pagenumbering{gobble}
8.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
9.	 Set the title, author's name, and date. Then, print the title:
\title{\textbf{\TeX\ Live Install Party}}
\author{\Large\textbf{Your \TeX\ team}}
\date{\textbf{August 11, City Hall Cellar}}
\maketitle

Chapter 1
41
10.	 Include a centered image. Here, we chose the CTAN lion:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{ctanlion.pdf}
\end{center}
11.	 Add some text:
We'd like to welcome you to our famous yearly \TeX\ install  
party! Bring your laptop and have free cold soft drinks  
while we assist you in installing the latest \TeX\ version  
on your computer.
We will provide
12.	A bulleted list can be a good idea for a catchy text. Use an itemize environment for 
it, each list item starting with \item:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a fast internet connection fow downloading,
  \item media such as DVDs and USB sticks with
    the latest \TeX\,
  \item \TeX\ books for bying with a discount,
  \item chat with \TeX\ experts.
\end{itemize}
13.	End the page. Fill in more text on the next page of the leaflet, which will be printed on 
the back side of the paper, next to each other:
\clearpage
Fill in text for page 2 (on the back side)
\clearpage
Fill in text for page 3 (on the back side)
\clearpage
Fill in text for page 4 (on the back side)
\clearpage
14.	 Now, pages 5 and 6 of the leaflet come to the front side of the paper. Use the  
\section command to insert a heading:
\section{Schedule}
15.	You can add a timetable using a tabular environment. Using the @{} option, we 
suppress spacing at the left and right:
\begin{tabular}{@{}rl@{}}
  6 pm    & Welcome \\

The Variety of Document Types
42
  7:30 pm & Live install presentation \\
  8 pm    & Book authors available for talks and signing \\
  9:30 pm & Bar closing
\end{tabular}
16.	 End the paragraph with an empty line, continue writing the text, and finally end the 
document:
From 6pm to 10pm: install support and free \TeX\ copies on DVD on 
our welcome desk.
\section{Accomodation}
Hotel, Meals, Travel information here
\section{Sponsors}
Information about our local \TeX\ user group
and Open Source projects sponsor
\clearpage
\section{Contact}
Names, Phone numbers, email addresses
\end{document}
17.	 Compile and take a look at the first page:

The back side still contains just some dummy text, which helps to identify the position where 
the text finally lands on the page.
How it works...
In the first line, we loaded the leaflet package with a font size of 10 pt. The notumble 
option suppresses the default behavior, that is, printing the back side upside down.
The next three lines contain our font settings. We used the Linux Libertine font and specified 
the T1 font encoding. You can read more about encodings in Chapter 2, Tuning the Text, 
specifically in the Improving justification and hyphenation recipe. Furthermore, we set the 
default font family to be sans serif. I prefer the clean look of sans serif on a flyer or a leaflet, 
which usually contains little text.
The remaining part of the preamble is as follows:
f
f
We loaded the microtype package, which improves the justification capabilities with 
tiny font adjustments. This is especially useful in a situation with narrow columns, 
such as in this case.
f
f
We loaded the graphicx package, so we are able to include images such as a logo 
or a geographic map.
f
f
We hid the page numbers. The \gobble command is a TeX command that removes 
the following command or control sequence, so the page number will simply be 
absorbed.
Our document body shows usual sectioning commands and text. You can see that we added 
an explicit space after the TeX logo by inserting a backslash and a following space. That's 
because the space after a macro, such as the \TeX command, just indicates the end of the 
macro. It doesn't produce a space in print because punctuation may follow the macro.
To have an image in our template, we used the CTAN lion drawn by Duane Bibby; simply 
replace it with your own image, for example, a geographic map or logo.
The remaining text is straightforward and shows some useful layout details, as follows:
f
f
Centering using the center environment:
\begin{center}
...
\end{center}
f
f
Arranging points in a bulleted list using an itemize environment
f
f
Setting up a tabular environment for text, which should be aligned in columns

The Variety of Document Types
44
In the \begin{tabular}{@{}rl@{}} line, the characters rl stand for two columns, where 
the first one is right aligned and the second one is left aligned. The expression @{code} 
inserts a piece of code instead of the space before or after the column, so @{} replaces it 
with nothing, that means, removes it. We got two columns without additional whitespaces on 
the left or right, saving our previous line space.
There's more...
The leaflet class provides some options and commands for customization.
Fold marks and cut lines
By default, a small folding mark is printed on the back side. If you would like to omit it, add  
the nofoldmark option when loading the class:
\documentclass[10pt,notumble,nofoldmark]{leaflet}
You can draw a vertically dotted line with a scissors symbol using the \CutLine command in 
the preamble with a page number as an argument. The line will go between this one and the 
preceding page, which is as follows:
\CutLine{3}
This will print a dotted line with two scissors symbols on the back side, between pages 2 and 
3, where a folding mark will be placed by default. The starred command version \CutLine* 
will not print the scissors.
Adjusting the margins
Similar to standard classes, you can use page headers and footers. There are none by default 
here. Standard commands such as \setlength{\headheight}{…} and \pagestyle can 
be used. The leaflet provides an additional command to declare the margins:
\setmargins{top}{bottom}{left}{right}
Adding a background image
You can add an image to the background of a certain page:
\AddToBackground{pagenumber}{\includegraphics{filename}}
Use the starred version \AddToBackground* to allow it to be printed in the background of 
the combined page.
Instead of the \includegraphics command, you can use other positioning commands, 
including our drawing code. Here, the Absolute positioning of text recipe in Chapter 2, Tuning 
the Text, will be useful.

Chapter 1
45
Changing the sectioning font
The font size of section headers is already a bit smaller than that of standard classes.  
If you would like to change the size, shape, or color of the headings, you can redefine the  
\sectfont macro. For example, if we enable using color with the \usepackage{xcolor} 
command, we can write the following line of code:
\renewcommand{\sectfont}{\large\sffamily\bfseries\color{blue}}
This will give a large sans serif font in bold and with blue color.
For further information regarding fonts, refer to Chapter 3, Adjusting Fonts.
Creating a large poster
We have seen informational or scientific posters at conferences or on the walls of universities 
or institutes. They mostly have certain characteristics in common:
f
f
They have a large size, such as A2, A1, or even A0
f
f
People may look at them from far away, but also from a very short distance
In consequence, we get some requirements for typesetting:
f
f
The page layout dimensions should work with such a big size.
f
f
We need a wide range of font sizes. We should be able to read while standing close, 
but we also need large, catchy headings.
f
f
The poster should be partitioned into digestible blocks. Specifically, each block 
should not exceed the usual line width we know from body texts. Also, excessively 
wide lines will make it hard to focus and to skip back to the start of the next line. So, 
the lines in blocks should not be much wider than about 40 or 50 characters long.
f
f
Blocks should have distinct headings.
f
f
Graphical elements such as colors and lines can be used to divide the poster 
contents in parts.
f
f
Images should be vector graphics or should have a high resolution.
In this recipe, we will create a poster of A0 size in landscape orientation. It will show some 
blocks containing the dummy text as a placeholder, math, and images. As sample images, we 
will take a flowchart from Chapter 9, Creating Graphics, and a plot from Chapter 10, Advanced 
Mathematics. There, you can find the source code. You can later replace the dummy text and 
other parts with your own content.

The Variety of Document Types
46
How to do it...
We will use the tikzposter class. The document is structured in columns and blocks. Follow 
these steps:
1.	 Begin with the document class. A0 is the default paper size. We state landscape 
orientation as the option:
\documentclass[landscape]{tikzposter}
2.	 Choose a theme, which provides a set of colors and decorations. We choose the blue 
Wave theme:
\usetheme{Wave}
3.	 Load the lipsum package to generate the dummy text:
\usepackage{lipsum}
4.	 For dividing wider blocks in text columns, we load the multicol package. On 
account of the large paper, we set the column separation and the separation  
line width to high values:
\usepackage{multicol}
\setlength{\columnsep}{4cm}
\setlength{\columnseprule}{1mm}
5.	 Define macros for repeated tasks, if desired. In our case, it will be a macro for 
including an image with an optional caption:
\newcommand*{\image}[2][]{%
  \begin{tikzfigure}[#1]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{#2}
  \end{tikzfigure}}
6.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
7.	
Declare the author and title, and print it out:
\title{\LaTeX\ in Use}
\author{John Doe}
\maketitle
8.	 Begin a set of columns:
  \begin{columns}

Chapter 1
47
9.	 Start a column with a width of 65 percent of the available text width:
  \column{.65}
10.	 Define a block with the title Workflow in the first argument; the second argument 
containing dummy text and an image:
  \block{Workflow}{
    \lipsum[1]
    \image[\LaTeX\ workflow]{flowchart}
  }
11.	 Still in the first column, start a set of subcolumns:
  \begin{subcolumns}
12.	The first subcolumn will take half of the available width, in this case, the width of the 
left column:
    \subcolumn{.5}
13.	Create a block with a bulleted list and a mathematical equation to get a feeling of 
how it will look on a poster. We will also use a colored box and an inner block with a 
title for the equation:
    \block{Mathematics}{
      Take a coffee, then:
      \bigskip
      \coloredbox{\begin{itemize}
        \item State
        \item Proof
        \item Write in \LaTeX
      \end{itemize}}
      \bigskip
      \innerblock{Integral approximation}{
        \[
          \int_a^b f(x) dx \approx (b-a)
            \sum_{i=0}^n w_i f(x_i)
        \]
      }
    }

The Variety of Document Types
48
14.	 Add a note, which will have a callout shape, pointing to the formula:
    \note[targetoffsetx = 4.5cm, targetoffsety = -5cm,
      angle = -30, connection]{Weight function}
15.	Make another subcolumn, taking the other half of the available width. Insert a block 
filled with text and end the subcolumns environment:
    \subcolumn{.5}
    \block{Text}{\lipsum[1]}
  \end{subcolumns}
16.	 Now that we are back to our main column environment, make another column, print 
a block with an image and some text, and then end the columns environment:
  \column{.35}
  \block{Plotting functions}{
    \image{plot}
    \lipsum[4]
  }
\end{columns}
17.	 As we ended the columns, a block will use the whole available width. To keep the 
text readable, we will now use the multicol package. We divide the text itself into 
columns using a multicolumn environment with four columns:
\block{Conclusion and outlook}{
  \begin{multicols}{4}
    \lipsum[10-11]
  \end{multicols}
}
18.	End the document:
\end{document}

49
19.	Compile the document, and take a look:
How it works...
The tikzposter package supports large paper sizes, large fonts, and it takes care of block 
heights and spacing between columns. We, as users, just decided the relative column width.
Several class options are provided. You can add them to the \documentclass command like 
we did with the preceding landscape option. Let's take a look at the following:
f
f
The paper size can be chosen with the a0paper, a1paper, or a2paper options. The 
a0paper option is the default.
f
f
The available font sizes are 12pt, 14pt, 17pt, 20pt, and 25pt. The last one is the 
default.
f
f
You can select the orientation by using the landscape or portrait command. The 
portrait option is the default.
f
f
The standard option fleqn for flush left equations is supported.
f
f
The standard option leqno for numbering the equation at the left-hand side is also 
supported.

The Variety of Document Types
50
You can adjust several lengths using different options. Give them as class options in the 
key=value form with a measurement unit such as mm or cm:
f
f
margin: This is the distance between the edge of the poster area and the edge of 
the paper
f
f
innermargin: This is the distance from the outermost edge of the blocks to the 
edge of the poster
f
f
colspace: This is the horizontal distance between consecutive columns
f
f
subcolspace: This is the horizontal distance between consecutive columns in a 
subcolumn environment
f
f
blockverticalspace: This is the distance between the bottom of a block and the 
top of the next block
A sample call using the defaults will be as follows:
\documentclass[a0paper, portrait, 25pt, margin=0mm,
  innermargin=15mm, colspace=15mm, subcolspace=8mm,
  blockverticalspace=15mm]{tikzposter}
The tikzposter package makes use of the very capable graphics language TikZ. We 
will see more of TikZ in Chapter 9, Creating Graphics. For now, the main benefit is that 
tikzposter provides a lot of predefined styles and color schemes.
You can use a main layout style by using the \usetheme{name} command. When this book 
came out, there were nine themes available:
f
f
Wave: This can be seen in our preceding recipe
f

Default (left) and Basic (right): This is shown in the following image:

Envelope (left) and Board (right), as shown in the following image:

f
Autumn (left) and Desert (right), as shown in the following image:

The Variety of Document Types
52
Furthermore, there are predefined styles for color, title, background, notes, blocks, and inner 
blocks, which can be chosen and composed. There's support for creating further styles.
The commands, which you have seen previously, can be used without support options straight 
away. However, they can be customized using several options.
The full reference is available by typing the texdoc tikzposter command in Command 
Prompt, and online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/tikzposter. You can find a style guide, 
a feature guide, and much more at https://bitbucket.org/surmann/tikzposter/
downloads.
There's more...
One of the first poster classes is a0poster. It actually supports the paper sizes A0, A1, A2, 
and A3. It provides font sizes from 12 pt up to 107 pt. Math formulas are printed in a suitable 
size. There's no specific support for graphics, color, or text placement. For this, you would 
need additional packages, such as TikZ.
In the recipe Creating a presentation, you saw the beamer package as a presentation class. 
The beamerposter package can be used together with it to produce presentations in poster 
size. It combines the beamer package with the a0poster code. So, you can produce large 
posters with a wide range of font sizes together with the beamer package's color and graphics 
capabilities, such as the beamer boxes with titles.
As mentioned previously, you can use the texdoc command or the Internet site http://
texdoc.net to access the documentation of the aforementioned classes and packages.
Another solution is provided by the baposter template. It provides blocks with headings 
and positioning support. Furthermore, it offers a set of predefined styles. Its download and 
documentation are available at http://www.brian-amberg.de/uni/poster/.

Tuning the Text
54
We are not yet dealing with fonts. This topic deserves a whole chapter, and will be covered in 
Chapter 3, Adjusting Fonts.
We will start with some very useful basics, cover some helpful things, and end the chapter 
with recipes that show off what LaTeX can do beyond rectangular paragraphs.
Inputting accented characters
By default, LaTeX works with simple ASCII characters. For accented characters, such as in the 
German word "schön", you need to type sch\"on into your editor. The babel command with 
the ngerman option simplifies the syntax to sch"on. But there is an easier way.
How to do it...
We will activate extended input character support as follows:
1.	 Check your editor's configuration and find out its input encoding setting. utf8 (UTF-
8 means Unicode) is standard for Linux, Mac OS X, and some Windows editors. 
However, some Windows editors still work with latin1 or cp1250/cp1252, while 
some older Macs use applemac.
2.	 Load the inputenc package with the corresponding option, like so:
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
3.	 Now you can directly type characters such as a, ü, ö, é, and è in to your document.
If you need help with editor settings, you can post a question in 
the forum at http://latex-community.org/forum/. 
This web site provides support forums for various LaTeX editors.
How it works...
The inputenc package enables direct entering of accented characters and symbols from 
code tables other than ASCII, and of Unicode. Modern editors and operating systems support 
UTF-8, so utf8 should be preferably set in the editor.
There's an utf8x encoding, but beware: this is not an 
extension, but a different approach, useful for some 
Asian languages.
Be careful: the inputenc encoding option, the editor 
setting, and the actual file encoding of the operating 
system all need to match.

Chapter 2
55
There's more...
If you would like to change the existing encoding, such as for files produced on a different 
system, you could open such a file in your editor with the actual encoding and save it with the 
new encoding. You may also use a conversion program such as one of these:
f
f
recode: See http://latex-community.org/tools/recode
f
f
iconv: See http://latex-community.org/tools/iconv
There's also a clever way of automatically selecting the needed encoding by using the 
selinput package as follows:
1.	 Load the selinput package:
\usepackage{selinput}
2.	 Specify some meanings of characters via this command; for example, as follows:
\SelectInputMappings{
  adieresis={ä},
  eacute={é},
  germandbls={ß}}
3.	 In your document text, you can now type ä, é, or ß, and they will be printed correctly.
Here, we provide samples of required characters with their meanings, and the selinput 
package determines the matching encoding. A few chosen glyphs may already suffice. If 
you would like to specify more, you can find their names in the selinput manual. It can be 
opened by typing the texdoc selinput command in Command Prompt, or accessed online 
at http://texdoc.net/pkg/selinput.
In addition to not needing to deal with encodings, you can also easily change the editor or 
operating system. You can exchange your files with friends who may use a different encoding 
without changing any setting.
Improving justification and hyphenation
Sometimes, you may get warnings like overfull \hbox, or you may notice words hanging in the 
margin. This is a sign that LaTeX has had serious problems with justification. Now, we will take 
a look at how to improve that.

Tuning the Text
56
How to do it...
You can start with any document. We will optimize it with settings in the preamble. If you don't 
have one at hand, you can take one from the code package for this book, specifically for the 
first chapter, or download one at http://latex-cookbook.net. Let's proceed:
1.	 Load the package babel with your document languages as options. Use the 
preferred language as the last option:
\usepackage[ngerman,english]{babel}
2.	 If you would like to use handy shortcuts of the ngerman package with English too, 
add the following lines of code:
\useshorthands{"}
\addto\extrasenglish{\languageshorthands{ngerman}}
3.	 Load the fontenc package with the T1 option set:
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
4.	 Load the microtype package for improved micro-typography:
\usepackage{microtype}
How it works...
With the babel package, LaTeX uses the hyphenation patterns for the chosen language. 
Even for the English language it could be useful. As you have seen, the babel package can 
additionally load the handy ngerman shortcuts for hyphenation commands. You can find such 
shorthand commands in the babel manual. You can open it by typing the texdoc babel 
command in Command Prompt, or you can find it online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/babel.
The modern font encoding T1 improves the situation further. When TeX and LaTeX were 
introduced, fonts did not contain glyphs for accented characters. They were printed as two 
characters, one being the actual accent. That's bad for copying and pasting from the final PDF 
output. It also interfered with hyphenation.
The default encoding is called OT1, and covers 128 glyphs, which means that it encodes 128 
characters. T1 provides 256 glyphs, so many accented characters are included. That's why 
T1 is recommended for Western European languages. There are further encodings for other 
languages, such as for Cyrillic and for Asian languages. If you would like to work with them, 
take a look at the fontenc manual by typing the texdoc fontenc command in Command 
Prompt, or you can read it online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/fontenc.
Finally, we let the microtype package apply micro-typographic extensions. For example, the 
font size, even of single letters, might be scaled a little bit in favor of better full justification. You 
hardly can notice this with the naked eye, but you can see the effect of less hyphenation and 
better overall greyness of the text. Therefore, there should be smaller white gaps between words.

Chapter 2
57
Furthermore, the microtype package subtly adjusts punctuation at the margin for better 
optical alignment, instead of just mechanical justification.
Converting numbers to words
Numbers are sometimes written in words rather than using numerals. LaTeX is capable of 
automatically converting numbers to words. This is especially useful for values which originate 
from LaTeX counters, such as page or section numbers.
How to do it...
Load the fmtcount package and use its commands for conversion:
1.	 Start with any document class, such as article:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the fmtcount package:
\usepackage{fmtcount}
3.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Write some text. Use the following instructions: 


Whenever you'd like to convert a number to a word, use the command  
\numberstringnum.


To print a counter value as a word, use \numberstring.


For a similar purpose, but in ordinal form, use \ordinalstringnum  
or \ordinalstring. Let's take a look at the following commands:
This document should have \numberstringnum{32}
pages, now we are on page \numberstring{page}
in the \ordinalstring{section} section.
5.	 End the document:
\end{document}
6.	 Compile the document. All numbers and counters are displayed as text, so you will 
get the following output:
This document should have thirty-two pages. Now we are on page one 
in the first section.

Tuning the Text
58
How it works...
The fmtcount package provides a set of commands that print out numbers as words:
f
f
\ordinalstring{counter}: This prints the value of a counter as an ordinal in text
f
f
\numberstring{counter}: This prints the counter's value as text
f
f
\ordinalstringnum{number} and \numberstringnum{number}: These two 
commands do the same job, but based on an actual number instead of a counter
f
f
\Ordinalstring{counter}, \Numberstring{counter},  
\Ordinalstringnum{number}, and \Numberstringnum{number}:  
These are the capitalized versions; they print the initial letter in uppercase
There's more...
The fmtcount package has even more to offer, such as multilingual capabilities, gender 
support, and support for new enumeration styles. We shall take a look at these features now.
Multilingual support
The fmtcount package supports several languages, such as English, Spanish, Portuguese, 
French, German, and Italian. It tries to detect the language option that has already been 
passed to the babel or polyglossia packages. You can explicitly load required definitions 
by typing the \FCloadlang{language} command in the preamble, with a language name 
understood by the babel package.
Gender
All the preceding commands support an optional gender argument at the end, taking one  
of the following values: m (masculine), f (feminine), or n (neuter). It is used such as in the  
\numberstring{section}[f] command. Masculine is the default.
Enumerated lists
The moreenum package provides new enumeration styles based on the fmtcount package. 
Here's an example:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{moreenum}
\begin{document}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Nthwords*]
  \item live
  \item long
  \item prosper

Chapter 2
59
\end{enumerate}
\end{document}
The items will be numbered first, second, and third, together with a dot. A label command  
\Nwords* would print One, Two, Three, with a dot. Also, here, there are lowercase versions, 
starting with a small letter n.
Besides the fmtcount command, this builds on the enumitem package, and so provides a 
similar key=value interface.
Putting text into a colorful box
You often see important content put into a colored box, especially on posters and slides, 
although it's used in other documents, too. In this recipe, we will put a little text and also 
whole paragraphs into a colored box. They can also have titles.
How to do it...
We will use the tcolorbox package. It is based on pgf, so you need to have that package 
installed as well.
We will create a box with the defaults, a titled box with split content, and boxes placed inline 
that fit the width of the content. Proceed as follows:
1.	 Create a small document based on any document class. The article package 
is a simple choice. Load the blindtext package to generate dummy text. This 
time, we will use the pangram option to create short pangrams as dummy text. The 
blindtext package requires the babel package, so we load it before. We also 
set English as the language. Furthermore, load the tcolorbox package. Our base 
document looks like this:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage[pangram]{blindtext}
\usepackage{tcolorbox}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

Tuning the Text
60
2.	 Create a simple box by inserting this code right after the \begin{document} 
command:
\begin{tcolorbox}
  \blindtext
\end{tcolorbox}
This gives you this box with text:
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Jackdaws love my big
Sphinx of Quartz. Pack my box with ﬁve dozen liquor jugs. The ﬁve
boxing wizards jump quickly. Sympathizing would ﬁx Quaker objectives.
3.	 Change it to, or add, the following code snippet:
\begin{tcolorbox}[title=\textbf{Examples},
  colback=blue!5!white,colframe=blue!75!white]
  The text below consists of pangrams.
  \tcblower
  \blindtext[3]
\end{tcolorbox}
The new box has a title and is divided into two parts, as shown here:
Examples
The text below consists of pangrams.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Jackdaws love my big
Sphinx of Quartz. Pack my box with ﬁve dozen liquor jugs.
4.	 Now try this setting and box command in the same document:
\tcbset{colframe=green!50!black,colback=white,
  colupper=green!30!black,fonttitle=\bfseries,
  center title, nobeforeafter, tcbox raise base}
  Normal text \tcbox{Boxed text}
It results in this:
Normal text
Boxed text

Chapter 2
61
5.	 Then, try this variation:
\tcbox[left=0pt,right=0pt,top=0.5ex,bottom=0pt,boxsep=0pt,
  toptitle=0.5ex,bottomtitle=0.5ex,title=Sample table]{
  \begin{tabular}[t]{rl}
    Number & 100 \\
    Sum    & 350
  \end{tabular}}
You can see that we can create boxes with titles, even with nontrivial content,  
such as tabular material:
Sample table
Number
100
Sum
350
How it works...
We loaded the blindtext package with the pangram option, which gives us short sample 
text snippets. We used them as dummy box content.
We loaded the tcolorbox package. The LaTeX environment with the same name then 
generates boxes for us.
The first box was done without any option with default settings. In the next box, we used the 
key=value interface to specify a title and the colors for the frame and the background.  
The \tcblower command split the box for us with a dashed line.
Then, we used the \tcbset command to define options which are valid for all following 
boxes. It's a good idea to use it in the preamble when all boxes would be similar. We set the 
color, applied a bold typeface, and centered the title. The nobeforeafter command implies 
no additional space before and after the box. The raise base command raises the whole 
box so that the baseline of the content matches the outer baseline. You will notice this when 
you look at our last boxes.
The last boxes were created using the \tcbbox command. It understands most options of the 
tcolorbox package; however, there are two differences:
f
f
\tcbbox: It doesn't provide a lower part, unlike the tcolorbox package with  
the \tblower command
f
f
\tcbbox: Using this command cannot be broken across pages, in contrast to the 
tcolorbox package
The \tcbbox command is a good choice for boxes within text. As in our example, it works fine 
around tabular code. It also works with images.

There's more...
The tcolorbox package is extremely capable and provides a lot of options and styles.  
The latter are also called skins. Refer to the package manual to explore further details.  
The wealth of its features is described over more than 300 pages. You can open the  
manual by typing the texdoc tcolorbox command into the command line or by visiting 
http://texdoc.net/pkg/tcolorbox.
The mdframed package offers a similar approach. Based on the classic framed package, 
it works with modern graphics packages such as TikZ and PSTricks to create colored boxes 
which can be broken across pages.
Visualizing the layout
At the time of designing a document, one may like to have an exact view of the dimensions and 
position of the text body, the header and footer, and the space for the margin notes. LaTeX can 
print help lines for you so you can examine the layout and use it to position extra elements.
How to do it...
Load the showframe package. This means the following steps:
1.	 Open your document or a sample for testing. Here, we will use the very first document 
from Chapter 1, The Variety of Document Types.
2.	 Add the following line at the end of your preamble:
\usepackage{showframe}

3.	 Compile the document. You will see frames around text body, margin note area, and 
header and footer:

Introduction
This document will be our starting point for simple documents. It is suitable for a single
page or up to a couple of dozen pages.
The text will be divided into sections.
1 The ﬁrst section
This ﬁrst text will contain
• a table of contents,
• a bulleted list,
• headings and some text and math in section,
• referencing such as to section 2 and equation (1).
We can use this document as a template for ﬁlling in our own content.
2 Some maths
When we write a scientiﬁc or technical document, we usually include math formulas. To
get a brief glimpse of the look of maths, we will look at an integral approximation of a
function f(x) as a sum with weights wi:

4.	 Examining the layout can give you ideas about making adjustments, such as changing 
the margins or other page dimensions. If you don't need these help lines any more, 
you can disable the package by commenting out \usepackage{showframe} or  
by deleting it.

Tuning the Text

How it works...
We simply loaded the showframe package. It prints the desired help lines on all pages of 
the document. This package belongs to the eso-pic bundle, which will help us in the recipe 
Absolute positioning of text later in the current chapter. As the showframe package visualizes 
layout dimensions, it can help with positioning in relation to margins or text body.
There's more...
There are alternatives to the showframe package. Let's take a look at them.
Using geometry
If you have already loaded the geometry package to specify page dimensions such as paper 
size and margin, you could add the option showframes, instead of loading the separate 
package with the same name, in the following ways:
f
f
You can add it while loading the package, as follows:
\usepackage[a4paper,bindingoffset=5mm,showframe]{geometry}
f
f
You can load it by calling the \geometry command after the geometry package 
has already been loaded, but also in the preamble:
\geometry{showframe}
Examining the page layout details
The layout package provides a command that prints an overview of the layout, and, in 
addition, the values of various page layout variables. Let's take a look at the following steps:
1.	 Load the layout package:
\usepackage{layout}
2.	 Insert the command \layout right after the \begin{document} command.

Visualizing boxes of letters and symbols
LaTeX puts text and symbols in boxes and arranges them. There are boxes of whole paragraphs, 
but also of single letters and symbols. In this recipe, we will closely examine the dimensions of 
those boxes. We will also take a look at the spacing in between and the resulting dimensions of 
dynamically adjusted space. This will give us a better understanding of the typesetting.
How to do it...
We will additionally load the package lua-visual-debug. Then, we will compile the 
document with LuaLaTeX, as follows:
1.	 Open your document or any sample file. Again, we will use the document from our 
first recipe in Chapter 1, The Variety of Document Types.
2.	 Add the following line at the end of your preamble:
\usepackage{lua-visual-debug}
3.	 Switch to LuaLaTeX in your editor for typesetting and compile the document. Take a 
look at these cutouts of the output. The text has some annotations, as follows:
When we write a scientiﬁc or technical docume

function f(x) as a sum with weights wi:
Formulae consist of many small boxes:

Examining the boxes may give you ideas about possibly tweaking formulas. In Chapter 10, 
Advanced Mathematics, you can read about fine-tuning math formulas. If you don't need the 
box visualization lines any more, you can disable the package by commenting out or deleting 
the line \usepackage{lua-visual-debug}.
How it works...
We simply loaded the lua-visual-debug package, which requires LuaLaTeX because  
of its dependency on LuaTeX. It did all the work for us, and now we just need to understand 
the output:

Tick lines stand for glue. This means vertical or horizontal space. In contrast to

recognize places where glues are touching.

A square means a penalty. This is an internal value, which TeX tries to minimize in  
its line-breaking algorithm. A blank square means a maximum penalty; otherwise,  
it's filled gray.
This visualization is intended to help you with debugging the document's typesetting.
Even if you are using pdfLaTeX, it's often possible to compile by LuaLaTeX for this purpose. 
Otherwise, you could debug with a simplified copy of the document part you need to debug 
with LuaLaTeX.
Typesetting in a grid
Besides full horizontal justification, LaTeX also adjusts the page content vertically to get a 
consistent page height. So, internal spacing is often variable. Furthermore, implicit spaces are 
often independent of the baseline height.
Consequently, lines of adjacent pages may look shifted. For two-sided prints with very thin 
paper, matching base lines would look much better. Especially in two-column documents it 
may be desirable to have baselines of adjacent lines at exactly the same height.
In this recipe, we would like to arrange lines on a grid. Normal text lines will be placed at a 
baseline grid. Displayed formulas, figures, tables, and captions are allowed to have a different 
baseline, but the following text should return to the grid.
How to do it...
We will use the grid package, which has been developed for grid typesetting. Follow  
these steps:
1.	 Prepare a small, two-column example with dummy text, where we can apply the grid 
commands. Here is a simple code snippet that you can use for a start:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{blindtext}
\usepackage{microtype}
\begin{document}
\twocolumn

\begin{equation}
  \sum_n f(n)
\end{equation}

\end{document}
2.	 Take a first look. Compare the height of the text lines in the left- and right-hand 
columns. Note that the baselines of the text are not yet aligned:

ing.

Is there a diﬀerence be-
tween this text and some nonsense like
“Huardest gefburn”? Kjift – not at all!
A blind text like this gives you informa-

of the look. This text should contain
all letters of the alphabet and it should
be written in of the original language.
There is no need for special content, but
the length of words should match the

\begin{gridenv}

How it works...
We specified the font size and the base line height as options to the grid package because 
the default settings don't look right.
The grid package makes some changes that helps the lines to stay in the grid. This is how it 
works:
f
f
So-called glue, also known as rubber space, which is elastic space, is removed or 
replaced by a fixed space.
f
f
The heights of many frequently-used items were made integral multiples of the baseline 
height so that they would fit exactly to the grid. This has been made, for example, for 
the following:


Section headings


Figures and tables


Displayed equations
It's recommended that you enclose the equation environments 
within a gridenv environment for proper spacing.

Tuning the Text
70
We did this here, and got a quick solution for double-column grid typesetting, at least in a 
limited way. For example, we need to accept the changed section heading size.
There's more...
The gridset package provides a command, \vskipnextgrid, which jumps the next grid 
position. It can be used as a simple fix, without being a complete solution. It requires two 
or more typesetting runs until all is adjusted. So you need to look at the affected place and 
repeat compiling if needed, especially if you use \vskipnextgrid repeatedly.
At the time of writing, the package was in alpha status.
This command can also be used in addition to the grid package. In a case where the grid 
package might fail, we can correct this by inserting the \vskipnextgrid command.
For example the amsmath package's multiline displayed equations could be a problem for the 
grid package. We can fix this as follows:
1.	 Load amsmath using the following command:
\usepackage{amsmath}
2.	 Also load the gridset package by using the following command:
\usepackage{gridset}
3.	 In the document, create an align environment, as follows:
\begin{align}
  y &= \sum_{n=1}^3 f(n) \\
    &= f(1) + f(2) + f(3)
\end{align} 
4.	 Directly after it, add the following line. It ends the paragraph, skips to the next 
position in the grid, and avoids inserting paragraph indentations:
\par\vskipnextgrid\noindent
5.	 Add some text following it.
6.	 Compile the document once. The position of the previously-added text may still not 
yet fit the grid.
7.	
Compile again. The \vskipnextgrid command will again adjust the spacing to 
match the base line grid.

Chapter 2
71
The \vskipnextgrid command may have problems in two-column mode. In this case, 
we fixed it by breaking the paragraph, adjusting the position, and suppressing the following 
paragraph indentation, because that is unusual after a displayed formula.
Absolute positioning of text
LaTeX takes care of full justification, text height balancing, and placing floating objects such 
as figures and tables. It does a great job, but sometimes one may need to tell LaTeX to place 
text or an image exactly at a certain position on a page.
Most positioning commands work in relation to the current position in the document. Now we 
would like to output text at an absolute position.
How to do it...
We will use the eso-pic package for positioning. We will print text at the edge of the page, in 
the middle, and at specific positions. We will break down the code in to fine steps. However, 
you can copy the code as a whole from the book's website at https://www.packtpub.com 
or from http://latex-cookbook.org.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Start with any document class. We chose the article package with A5 paper here:
\documentclass[a5paper]{article}
2.	 Load the lipsum package so that you can generate dummy text:
\usepackage{lipsum}
3.	 Load the graphicx package; we will later use its rotating feature:
\usepackage{graphicx}
4.	 Load the showframe package for visualizing page dimensions, just to help us in the 
draft stadium:
\usepackage{showframe}
5.	 Load the eso-pic package, which does the positioning for us:
\usepackage{eso-pic}
6.	 Load the classic picture package to place with coordinates:
\usepackage{picture}

Tuning the Text

7.	
We will print the page numbers by ourselves, so disable the original page numbering:
\pagestyle{empty}
8.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
9.	 Add the page number to all pages as follows:
\AddToShipoutPictureBG{%
  \setlength{\unitlength}{1cm}%
  \put(2.5,2){Test document}%
  \put(\paperwidth-2cm,2cm){\llap{\thepage}}%
}
10.	 Add some text to a single page as follows. Note the star (*):
\AddToShipoutPictureBG*{%
  \AtPageLowerLeft{Page bottom left}%
  \AtPageUpperLeft{\raisebox{-\height}{Page top left}}%
  \AtTextUpperLeft{\raisebox{-\height}{%
    \color{red}Text area top left}}%
}
11.	 Add a confidential sign at the top of the page:
\AddToShipoutPictureFG{%
  \AtPageCenter{\rotatebox{15}{\makebox[0pt]{%
    \Huge\bfseries\color{red}Confidential}}}%
}
12.	Print some dummy text. It starts at the beginning of the page, as usual. Then, end  
the document:
\lipsum
\end{document}

How it works...
We loaded several packages, as follows:
f
f
The lipsum package gives us dummy text, which we get by the command \lipsum.
f
f
The graphicx package is for including images, but here we loaded it because we 
use its command \rotatebox to rotate text in step 11.
f
f
The showframe package prints lines around text and margin areas, as you saw in  
a recipe before.
f
f
The eso-pic package does the main job here. It provides commands for printing 
text or graphics independent of the current position on the page. It can do this in the 
background, which means behind text, but also in the foreground, overwriting the 
normal text.
f
f
The picture package is a helper package. Some commands, such as \put, expect 
arguments with simple numbers, which are interpreted as factors of \unitlength. 
This package allows the use of different lengths with arbitrary units.
We set an empty page style; that is, one without header and footer text. In the document, we 
called the eso-pic commands:
f
f
The \AddToShipoutPictureBG command takes LaTeX's picture commands, 
which are put into a zero-length picture environment in the lower-left corner of the 
page. This is printed onto the page background or behind the normal text.
Here, we first defined the base unit length to be 1 centimeter. In the following \put 
command, we used multiples of the base length to print "Test document" near the 
lower-left corner. Finally, we printed the current page number near the lower-right 
corner. We calculated with paper width and centimeter values. This syntax is brought by 
the picture package. The \llap command puts its argument right-aligned into a zero-
length box.
This will be repeated for the following pages.
f
f
The \AddToShipoutPictureBG* command works like the  
\AddToShipoutPictureBG command, but only on the current page. With the 
\AtPageLowerLeft command, we placed text in the lower-left corner of the 
page. The \AtPageUpperLeft command works similarly for the upper left. We 
just lowered the text by its own height. The \AtTextUpperLeft command is the 
analogous command for the text area.
f
f
The \AddToShipoutPictureFG page works like the \AddToShipoutPictureBG 
command, but for the page foreground. We placed the word "Confidential" in huge red 
lettering, rotated above the text, in the middle of the page.
f
f
The \AddToShipoutPictureFG* command is the analogous command for the 
foreground, which affects only the current page.

There's more...
There are alternative ways to achieve what we just did. These are packages that do a similar job:
f
f
The atbegshi package can be used directly. The eso-pic package actually builds 
on it.
f
f
The everyshi package does a similar job. The atbegshi package is a modern 
reimplementation of it.
f
f
The textpos package bases on the everyshi package. It provides a convenient 
user interface.
Capable graphics packages provide their own means in addition.
f
f
The package TikZ can be used to place text in relation to the current page node 
in overlay mode
f
f
The PSTricks bundle contains the package pst-abspos for putting an object at an 
arbitrary position on the page
If any of it fits better to your work tools, you may take a closer look. As you saw in other 
recipes, you can access each package's documentation by calling the texdoc command at 
the command prompt, followed by the package name and return key. For online access, just 
type the package name into the search field at http://texdoc.net.
Starting a paragraph with an over-sized 
letter
In older texts, such as in books of fairy tales, we sometimes see the first paragraph in a text 
starting with a huge letter, while the following text flows around it. This is called a drop cap or 
an initial. We will now use this design for our own text.
How to do it...
We will use the lettrine package, which provides a command for this purpose.  
Follow these steps:
1.	 Start a document with any document class. Here, we chose the book class. We will 
use A6 paper size, simply because this makes the recipe easy to show with little text:
\documentclass{book}
\usepackage[a6paper]{geometry}
2.	 Load the lettrine package:
\usepackage{lettrine}

Tuning the Text
76
3.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Start a paragraph with the command \lettrine{letter}{further 
introduction}, as follows:
\lettrine{O}{nce upon a time}, professional writer used
a mechanical machine called a typewriter. It commonly
printed fixed-width characters. Emphasizing was done by
writing all capitals, and by underlining.
5.	 End the document:
\end{document}
6.	 Compile the document. Now look at the shape of our paragraph:
O
nce upon a time, professional writer used
a mechanical machine called a typewriter.
It commonly printed ﬁxed-width characters. Em-
phasizing was done by writing all capitals, and
by underlining.
How it works...
For this simple example, we used the basic book class. We loaded the geometry package to 
get a handy A6 paper size. The final command in the preamble loaded the lettrine package, 
which provides exactly the design we were looking for. The command \lettrine{O}{nce 
upon a time} prints one big letter O, followed by the text in the second pair of braces, which 
is printed in small caps. The other text flows around the large letter.
There's more...
The design of the dropped capitals can be customized. Let's take a look at some options.
Changing the drop cap size
By default, the dropped capital will cover two lines. You can change the number of lines by 
setting the optional argument lines as follows:
\lettrine[lines=3]{O}{nce upon a time}
Now a huge O covers three lines. Furthermore, you can enlarge it by setting the loversize 
option, standalone or in combination with the previously seen option:
\lettrine[lines=3,loversize=0.2]{O}{nce upon a time}

Chapter 2
77
The loversize option can be set to a value larger than -1 and smaller than or equal to 1, 
and means the resize factor. That is, a value of 0.1 means enlarging by 10 percent.
The lettrine package provides a key=value interface. More options are available to 
control further aspects, such as the gap between the drop cap and the following text, and 
vertical shifting. You can also let drop caps hang into the margin. These features are explained 
in the manual. You can open it using texdoc lettrine in Command prompt, or at http://
texdoc.net/pkg/lettrine.
In case of repeated use:
For making later adjustments easier and consistent, it's 
recommended that you create a macro via the \newcommand 
command, using the \lettrine command inside. It's better than 
repeatedly typing the \lettrine commands with options.
Coloring the initial
The simplest way of getting colored drop caps is by using the well-known commands of the 
color or xcolor package, as follows:
\usepackage{xcolor}
...
\lettrine{\textcolor{red}{A}}{nother} time
A full list of available colors and names is contained in the 
xcolor manual. You can open it by typing the texdoc 
xcolor command in Command Prompt, or you can find it 
online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/xcolor. You may 
need to set an option to access certain predefined names, 
such as svgnames, dvipsnames, or x11names.
The package coloredlettrine provides an even fancier way. It provides bicolor initials 
based on the EB Garamond font. Internally, the initials are split into two fonts. One provides 
the background ornaments, the other the actual letters. This allows separate coloring. We 
will use the OpenType version of the EB Garamond font. OpenType requires compilation with 
XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. Many LaTeX editors support them too.
At the time of writing, the package was still in development. There was just a small set of 
initials available. That's why we will refer to the development sources. Let's take a look at the 
following steps:
1.	 Download the package files from https://github.com/raphink/
coloredlettrine. There should be a .ins file and a .dtx file. Put them together 
into the same folder. Compile the file coloredlettrine.ins with LaTeX. This 
produces a file named coloredlettrine.sty, which you can place in your TeX 
installation or your document folder.

Tuning the Text
78
2.	 Get the latest version of the EB Garamond font from https://bitbucket.
org/georgd/eb-garamond/downloads and install it. Specifically, unzip the 
downloaded file and install at least the EBGaramond-InitialsF1.otf and 
EBGaramond-InitialsF2.otf software. On a Mac, double click the file to see the 
contents and then click the install button shown.
3.	 The package coloredlettrine contains an example that you can compile. Here, 
let's modify our example from the recipe's start:
\documentclass{book}
\usepackage[a6paper]{geometry}
\usepackage{coloredlettrine}
\renewcommand{\EBLettrineBackColor}{SlateBlue}
\setcounter{DefaultLines}{3}
\renewcommand{\DefaultLraise}{0.3}

The command \coloredlettrine can be used exactly like the \lettrine command  
since it is just a wrapper for it. You can redefine the macros \EBLettrineBackColor and  
\EBLettrineFrontColor to choose the color.
In this example, we set default values for lettrine parameters, which we would otherwise 
have needed to provide as key=value options, as explained earlier in this recipe. This way 
can save you from defining your own macro. It is described in the manual, which you can  
open with the texdoc lettrine command at the command prompt, or find online at 
http://texdoc.net/pkg/lettrine.
Fitting text to a shape
There are occasions when text is not strictly arranged in a rectangular box. For example, if you 
would like to print a label for a DVD or compact disc, the text should be arranged in a circle.
How to do it...
The shapepar package can typeset paragraphs in a specific shape, such as a circle, a 
hexagon, or a heart. The shape size will be adjusted so the given text fits in. We will now try it 
with a heart:
1.	 Make a small document, load the packages blindtext (for dummy text) and the 
shapepar package:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{blindtext}
\usepackage{shapepar}
2.	 In the document, use the \shapepar command with the shape argument, and then 
text as follows:
\begin{document}
\shapepar{\heartshape}\blindtext[2]
\end{document}

How it works...
We loaded the blindtext package, which provides filler text via the \blindtext command, 
which is great for testing. Then we loaded the shapepar package.
That package provides the command \shapepar, which is used as follows:
\shapepar[scale length]{shape command} text of the paragraph
Here, we used the \heartshape command as the shape command, which typesets the 
following paragraph of text with the shape of a heart. The shape applies only to the following 
paragraph. The paragraph is not an argument.
The scale length value is optional. It's a LaTeX length, which will be used as a base  
unit within the shape definition. If not given, it's automatically calculated for optimal filling  
of the shape.
There's another short command:
\heartpar{text}

Chapter 2
81
It works as follows:
\shapepar{\heartshape} text\ \ $\heartsuit$\par 
It prints the text in the shape of a heart and ends it with a heart symbol.
There's more...
We can shape text in various ways. Furthermore, we can let text flow around a shape. In other 
words, we can cut out shapes from the text.
Further shapes
The following shapes and corresponding commands are predefined:
Shape macro
Command
Effect
\squareshape
\squarepar
Square
\circleshape
\circlepar
Circle
\CDshape
\CDlabel
Circle with hole for DVD 
or compact disk
\diamondshape
\diamondpar
Diamond (rhomboid)
\heartshape
\heartpar
Heart
\starshape
\starpar
Five-pointed star
\hexagonshape
\hexagonpar
Hexagon
\nutshape
\nutpar
Hexagon with hole
\rectangleshape{height}{width}
Rectangle
The last shape doesn't provide another command. Use it as follows:
\shapepar{\rectangleshape{40}{20}} text
Use it without the units for the length, as the command refers to the base unit length of the 
shape. The holes mentioned in the preceding table are circular.
Cutting out shapes
A companion of the \shapepar command can cut out text using a shape:
\cutout {side} (horizontal offset,vertical offset)
  settings \shapepar ...
This cuts out the text with the specified shape from the following text. The side option can be 
l or r for left or right, respectively. You can use offsets for shifting settings as optional code. It 
can contain commands such as modifying the \cutoutsep command, which is the separation 
between outer text and shaped text, 12 pt by default. These commands have only a local effect.

Tuning the Text
82
For further details, refer to the package's manual. Since a good example is missing there, 
here's one, simply working within the code from our preceding recipes:
\cutout{l} (5ex,2\baselineskip) \setlength{\cutoutsep}{8pt}
  \shapepar{\circleshape} a few words of text\par

Creating a pull quote
To entice people to read a text, we can present a short, attractive excerpt as a quotation. That 
means we pull out some text. In a two-column layout, it's looks nice to put the quotation into 
a window in the middle of the page between the two columns, with the regular text flowing 
around it. It's also a nice way of embedding images.
How to do it...
One possibility is to use the shapepar package to cut out space from the text, like in the 
previous recipe. However, it would be a bit challenging doing it twice, once for each column.
The pullquote package provides a solution. It can typeset a balanced two-column text layout 
with a cut-out window. This can be filled with text or an image. The shape is arbitrary.
We will use dummy text and highlight a quotation from Donald Knuth, the creator of TeX:
1.	 Download the pullquote.dtx file from http://bazaar.launchpad.
net/~tex-sx/tex-sx/development/view/head:/pullquote.dtx or from 
CTAN, once it's provided there too.

Chapter 2
83
2.	 Click on browse files and also download the pq-alice.jpg, pq-duck.pdf, and 
pullquote_test.tex files, to get filler images and a sample file.
3.	 Compile the pullquote.dtx file with LaTeX. Do it twice for correct references. It will 
generate a pullquote.sty file and the documentation file pullquote.pdf. Place 
the files where your LaTeX can find them, or simply in the document's folder.
4.	 Start with a document class and the lipsum package for dummy text, and load the 
pullquote package:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\usepackage{pullquote}
5.	 Create a command that prints your quotation in a paragraph box:
\newcommand{\myquote}{%
  \parbox{4cm}{
    \hrule\vspace{1ex}
    \textit{I can't go to a restaurant and order food
      because I keep looking at the fonts on the menu.}
    \hfill Knuth, Donald (2002)%
    \vspace{1ex}
    \hrule
  }%
}
6.	 In the document, use a pullquote environment with the self-defined macro in the 
argument, and dummy text, as follows:
\begin{document}
\begin{pullquote}{object=\myquote}
  \lipsum[1]
\end{pullquote}
\end{document}

How it works...
We loaded the lipsum package, which gives us filler text. Then we loaded the pullquote 
package. We defined a macro, which prints the quotation.
For our example, we made a paragraph box with lines above and below, printing italic text and 
the author's name at the right. To avoid undesired white space, we commented out the line 
breaks in some places by putting a % sign at the end.
In the document, we simply made a pullquote environment with that macro as a pulled 
object within the argument, and lipsum text for filling the surrounding space.
The pullquote package does the rest for us. It does the following things:
f
f
It puts the object into a box
f
f
It measures height and width
f
f
It adds space for the distance
f
f
It normalizes the total height to be an integral multiple of the value specified for the  
\baselineskip command to match a number of text lines
f
f
It calculates the vertical position
f
f
It calculates a shape for the paragraph
f
f
It balances the text columns according to the shape
f
f
It arranges all and prints the whole construct
There are some restrictions. Mainly, the text within the environment should be simple 
paragraphs of text. This means that lists such as itemize, displayed math, section headings, 
and modified vertical spacing in general, are undesirable. Such non-simple elements may 
trouble the calculation. However, it's already great for images and text boxes.

Chapter 2
85
There's more...
The key=value list in the argument of the pullquote package understands further 
parameters. Besides the default rectangular shape, there's a circular one. We can specify it 
via the shape option. The following example will demonstrate it. We will create a TikZ picture 
to have an actual circled element to place in. So, we need to load the TikZ package as well.
You can verify it with this sample code, similar to the preceding code:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{lipsum}
\usepackage{pullquote}
\usepackage{tikz}
\newcommand{\mylogo}{%
  \begin{tikzpicture} 
    \node[shape=circle,draw=gray!40,line width=3pt,
      fill={gray!15},font=\Huge] {\TeX};
  \end{tikzpicture}%
}
\begin{document}
\begin{pullquote}{shape=circular,object=\mylogo}
  \lipsum[1]
\end{pullquote}
\end{document}
The code will produce this layout:

TikZ is a very capable graphics package. You can read more about it in Chapter 9, Creating 
Graphics. We could also have used a circular image instead. For this, refer to the recipe 
Shaping an image like a circle in the next chapter.
For arbitrary shapes specified by shape functions, refer to the package manual. It also 
explains image inclusion support with the shape=image list. Then, the cut-out dimensions 
would be calculated from the image dimensions. For this, the free ImageMagick program 
would need to be installed on the system, since it would then be called internally.

Introduction
When LaTeX was young, documents looked quite similar, since there was a precious little 
choice of fonts. Over time, many new fonts were invented and gained support from LaTeX.
To find the perfect fonts for your documents, visit the LaTeX font catalogue at http://www.
tug.dk/FontCatalogue/.
In this chapter, we will see how to choose fonts globally and how to adjust them within the 
document.
Before we take off, let's take a quick look at basic LaTeX commands for switching between 
fonts. We keep it very short, as introductory texts usually cover it. Experienced LaTeX users 
may skip this section.

Adjusting Fonts
88
Basic font commands
Fonts for text have five main attributes:
f
f
Encoding: We covered this in the previous chapter and concluded that T1 encoding is 
usually a good choice for common Latin text, which can be activated by the following 
command:
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
f
f
Family: This is what we we call sets of fonts of the same origin and the same type. 
You can switch to a font family using one of these commands:


\rmfamily: This is the default that switches to Roman font, which means 
text with serifs.


\sffamily: This switches to sans serif font.


\ttfamily: This is for typewriter font.
f
f
Series: This denotes how heavy a font is. Following are the commands:


\bfseries: This is for bold font.


\mdseries: This is for medium font, which is the default.
f
f
Shape: This attribute relates to the shape of the text; a font family can have several 
shapes:


\upshape: This switches to upright text, which is the default


\itshape: This switches to italics.


\slshape: This gives slanted text.


\scshape: This is for small capitals.
f
f
Size: The base size is specified as an option to the document class, as we did earlier. 
We can choose a different size:


We get a larger text size in the increasing order using \large, \Large,  
\LARGE, \huge, and \Huge.


We get lower text size using \small, \footnotesize, \scriptsize,  
and \tiny.


We can switch back to the normal size using \normalfont.

Chapter 3
89
The effect of these commands is limited by environments. You can also limit the effect by curly 
braces, for example, {\bfseries ... }.
There's another more consistent syntax for modifying short pieces of text. For example. the 
following commands choose a font family for a piece of text:
f
f
\textrm{...} switches the argument to Roman text, \textsf{...} switches it to 
sans-serif, and \texttt{...} switches the argument to typewriter text.
Similarly, the following applies to the series and shape:
f
f
\textbf{...} makes the argument bold, \textmd{...} makes it medium.
f
f
\textit{...} applies Italics, \textsl{...} gives slanted text, \textsc{...} 
switches the argument to small capitals, and \textup{...} is for upright font.
That's easier to remember. There's no such command for font size. It's unusual anyway to 
manually change the font size within surrounding text. Just think of calculating the interline 
distance for the paragraph.
There's more...
Classes and packages use these font commands to define consistent styles. As the author, 
we state elements such as section headings, footnotes, subscripts, and emphasized snippets; 
while LaTeX chooses the corresponding size, shape, and series.
What if you would like to use those commands yourself? It's a very good practice to use such 
font commands only in the preamble, in macro definitions, not in the document's body text. 
For example, instead of scattering the \textbf{...} commands all over the text for bold 
author names, you should define an author name style using:
\newcommand{\authorname}[1]{\textbf{#1}}
This allows to implement easy and consistent changes at a single place—the preamble, for 
example, when you would decide to use small caps or Italics instead.
A macro for each required formatting brings logic into the text. And you can modify all 
occurrences at the same time by changing the macro.

Adjusting Fonts
90
Choosing a font for a document
The default font has the name Computer Modern and is of very good quality. It is actually a 
whole font family that contains bold, italic, sans-serif, typewriter, and more font versions. All 
the fonts are well composed to fit together.
If you would like to change the font, use a complete bundle or carefully select font families 
based on shape and size. That's because, besides giving a good appearance to the document 
overall, it is important that all font families are compliant to each other when they are used 
together.
In this recipe, we will take a look at some font sets and recommended combinations.
Getting ready
For the fonts you would like to use, their files should already be installed on your TeX system. 
If not already present, install them. Use the package manager of your LaTeX distribution, such 
as the MiKTeX package manager in case of MiKTeX on Windows, or the TeX Live manager tool 
called tlmgr.
In case you have TeX Live installed, it offers the possibility to install entire font collections, so 
you may run the tlmgr tool at the command line:
tlmgr install collection-fontsrecommended
tlmgr install collection-fontsextra
If sufficient hard disk space is available, installing all fonts or even all packages of the TeX 
distribution can save you from some headache later, so you would not miss any fonts.
TeX Live installs only free fonts that have no restrictions on distribution by the supplier. 
There's a tool called getnonfreefonts for downloading and installing other fonts. For 
documentation and download, visit http://www.tug.org/fonts/getnonfreefonts/.
How to do it...
Fonts with LaTeX support often come with a package. As the author, you can load the package 
and that package takes care of loading and activating fonts.
So, commonly these steps would be followed in the preamble:
1.	 Switch to the required font encoding. Most modern fonts work with T1, as explained 
in Chapter 2, Tuning the Text:
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

Chapter 3
91
2.	 Load the font package:
\usepackage{fontname}
The fontname parameter is the name or the short form for the name of a font that 
you need to know, for example, by visiting the LaTeX Font Catalogue.
3.	 If your default document font should be sans-serif, you can switch to that:
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
In the next recipe, you will see another method of choosing a font, which also works locally. 
Here, we continue with the document wide font choice.
There's more...
Let's take a look at some good alternative fonts. Use each code given next together with the 
setting \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}.
We will take a look at a sample output so that you can compare the font selections. Note that 
you may see a lower quality than in a LaTeX document, as the publisher of this book accepts 
only images in bitmap format. This can result in a blurry or pixelated output, depending on the 
print or screen resolution.
You can also see the following example with the PDF output at http://latex-cookbook.
net/cookbook/examples/tag/fonts/.
To demonstrate this, we will take our very first example in the first chapter, just a bit reduced. 
We will see how roman, sans serif, italic, and typewriter fonts harmonize.
Latin Modern
Latin Modern is very similar to the default Computer Modern font. It is of excellent quality. 
This font bundle covers the usual requirements, such as having a serif, sans serif, typewriter, 
and symbol font. Load the fonts using the following command:
\usepackage{lmodern}
Latin Modern gives us the following appearance:
1 Some maths
To see the math font design, we will look at an integral approximation of a function
f(x) as a sum with weights wi. Key commands are \int, \approx and \sum.
 b
a f(x) dx ≈(b −a)
n

i=0
wif(xi)

It is still similar to the one in our very first recipe.

92
Kepler fonts
The Kepler fonts are a complete and well-designed set of fonts in various shapes. There are 
upright and slanted Greek letters, bold math glyphs, old style numbers, and several weights 
from light to bold extended. Even slanted small caps are available. You can get the whole set 
using this command:
\usepackage{kpfonts}
The appearance of our sample changes to the following:

To see the math font design, we will look at an integral approximation of a function
f (x) as a sum with weights wi. Key commands are \int, \approx and \sum.
 b

The typefaces harmonize well. They are not very heavy, for example, the typewriter code 
better matches the greyness of the normal text, since it doesn't look as heavy as it did in the 
previous sample.
Font combinations
Some fonts exist only as text fonts, math fonts, or in a specific shape. In such a case, it is 
a challenge to combine different fonts, both regarding taste and scaling. Here are some 
examples that work fine together:
\usepackage{libertine}
\usepackage[libertine,cmintegrals,cmbraces,vvarbb]{newtxmath}
\usepackage[scaled=0.95]{inconsolata}
Together they give us this appearance:
1 Some maths
To see the math font design, we will look at an integral approximation of a function f (x) as
a sum with weights wi. Key commands are \int, \approx and \sum.

Chapter 3
93
We loaded the Linux Libertine font. It is not as dense as a Times font, but denser than 
Computer Modern. Then, we added the newtxmath font, but programmed it to use Libertine 
glyphs when appropriate other than using the Computer Modern integral and braces symbols. 
The last option tells newtxmath to use another good blackboard font with \mathbb. Try this 
selection and check whether you like it, omit options to compare with the default settings. For 
details and further features, refer to the newtx manual via texdoc.
Finally, we loaded the excellent monospaced font Inconsolata for typewriter font-like shape, 
and scaled it a bit to better match our text font.
Now, let's try another combination:
\usepackage[sc,osf]{mathpazo}
\usepackage[T1,small,euler-digits]{eulervm}
\usepackage[scaled=0.86]{berasans}
\usepackage[scaled=0.84]{beramono}
You can see the difference, such as more upright shape for variables and integral and 
summation signs:

We loaded the mathpazo package, which gives us a Palatino text font. We replaced its 
Palatino Italic-like math font by the Euler Virtual Math font. It's basically the Euler font with 
missing symbols taken from Computer Modern, which is why it is called virtual.
In addition, we loaded the Bera sans serif font and the monospaced Bera shape for the 
typewriter text; both are appropriately scaled.
You may have noticed the options sc and osf for mathpazo, that is, for Palatino, which gives 
us a small caps font and uses old style figures as the default.
Now you have some good suggestions for a fine font selection. Using any of them, your 
document will look professionally designed and still different from a LaTeX standard 
document.

Adjusting Fonts

Locally switching to a different font
A typographically good document with consistent appearance commonly uses just a few fonts, 
each one with a purpose. Common font choices are:
f
f
Serif body text
f
f
Sans serif for headings
f
f
Monospaced for source code
Each font family is defined in the preamble, usually implicitly done by packages. There are 
LaTeX commands for switching between families, shapes, and weight. But what if you would 
like to additionally use a completely different font, such as a second serif font? This recipe will 
help to achieve that.
How to do it...
We will take a look at two ways:
f
f
Defining a command
f
f
Defining an environment
In each case, we need to know the code for the font. Such code is based on the Karl Berry's 
naming scheme; you can read about it by typing the texdoc fontname command in the 
Command Prompt, or at http://texdoc.net/pkg/fontname. You don't really need to 
study this guide, just take a look at the font's own documentation. For your convenience, here

A command for changing the font
To avoid repetition of command sequences within the document, we will define a macro for 
changing the font. This allows consistent future adjustments.
Define a simple macro for the change to the Zapf Chancery font. Write it into your preamble:
\newcommand{\zapf}{\fontfamily{pzc}\selectfont}
In your document, use it to switch the font. Group the command with the text to be affected. 
Consider ending the paragraph before you end the group, which can be done by inserting an 
empty line or by the \par command.
You can group the command by using curly braces:
{\zapf Text in Zapf Chancery\par}
Here is another way, which may be a better choice for you to understand clearly:
\begingroup
\zapf
Text in Zapf Chancery
\par
\endgroup

Adjusting Fonts
96
An environment for changing the font
Creating an environment is an even clearer way of restricting the effect of the change. Write it 
into your preamble:
\newenvironment{zapfenv}{\fontfamily{pzc}\selectfont}{}
Now, you can use this environment in your document:
\begin{zapfenv}
Text in Zapf Chancery
\par
\end{zapfenv}
You can save some work by moving the final paragraph break to the environment definition. 
This way, you don't always need to type before closing the environment. The definition will be 
as follows:
\newenvironment{zapfenv}{\fontfamily{pzc}\selectfont}{\par}
How it works...
At first, we choose the font family, which has not yet had an immediate effect on the font. We 
need to call the \selectfont command in order to apply the change.
Both grouping and the use of an environment keep the change local. This means that after 
ending the group or environment, the following text will have the same font as earlier.
The font properties at the end of the paragraph determine how TeX formats a paragraph, 
especially its line spacing. That's the reason for having the paragraph break within the group 
or environment, not directly afterwards. Otherwise, for example, in case of switching to a 
bigger font, we can have a paragraph with a big font but with a small line spacing from the 
outer font.
There's more...
If you would really like to use several different font families within a document, you can make 
the macro and the environment more variable by introducing an argument. The definitions can 
be changed to:
\newcommand{\setfont}[1]{\fontfamily{#1}\selectfont}
\newenvironment{fontenv}[1]{\fontfamily{#1}\selectfont}{\par }
Also, the usage of the command will change to:
{\setfont{pzc} Text in Zapf Chancery\par}

Chapter 3
97
Alternatively, it changes to this:
\begin{fontenv}{pzc}
Text in Zapf Chancery
\end{fontenv}
There's also a command for switching back to the default font family. You can use it to 
explicitly reset the default font family of the document:
\normalfont
You can change more parameters of the chosen font. In such cases, you may define some 
macros for several purposes, such as various heading fonts. Look at this sample:
\newcommand{\latin}{\fontencoding{T1}\fontfamily{lmr}%
  \fontshape{sl}\fontseries{b}\fontsize{16pt}{20pt}\selectfont}
Here, we switch to T1 encoded Latin Modern Roman with slanted shape and bold weight. 
Furthermore, we set a font size of 16 pt and a line spacing of 20 pt. For detailed information, 
refer to the Guide LaTeX 2e font selection, which is accessible on the command line by typing 
the texdoc fntguide command in the Command Prompt. It is available for download at 
http://texdoc.net/pkg/fntguide.
As with all physical font settings, such changes should not be directly called within a 
document. They are useful within global formatting commands, for example, to use the  
Zapf Chancery font in KOMA-Script chapter headings:
\setkomafont{chapter}{\normalcolor\zapf\Huge}
Generally, once you know how to adjust the font, you can apply these macros within the logical 
macros, such as for defining the appearance of keywords, code, or hyperlinks.
Importing just a single symbol from a font 
family
There are a lot of packages providing symbols. Often, you get the new commands for 
additional symbols by simply loading the package by using the \usepackage command. 
However, there can be name conflicts in case the other packages already use the same 
command name. It can result in an error or in silently overwriting the command.
In this recipe, we will see how to choose one or more specific symbols from a package and 
access them without loading the whole package.
We will choose a binary relation symbol from the mathabx package. This will be the sign for 
less or equal. Later, we will import its negation.

Adjusting Fonts

Getting ready
In this recipe, we need to take a look at the source code of the symbol package to imitate part 
of what it does, so prepare yourself:
1.	 Locate the file mathabx.sty and open it. At the Command Prompt, kpsewhich 
mathabx.sty gives you the location. But you can also use your file manager.
2.	 In mathabx.sty, you can see \input mathabx.dcl. There are symbol 
declarations; open this file as well. It is in the same folder, but again kpsewhich 
mathabx.dcl will find it.
3.	 Type texdoc fntguide to open the Guide to LaTeX 2e font selection. This is 
optional, but that manual can help you to understand the commands in this recipe, 
specifically those that start with \Declare.
How to do it...
We will copy the required lines of code from the font package to our document. Perform the 
following steps:
1.	 From the mathabx.sty file, copy all the needed font declarations to your document 
preamble:
\DeclareFontFamily{U}{matha}{\hyphenchar\font45}
\DeclareFontShape{U}{matha}{m}{n}{
  <5> <6> <7> <8> <9> <10> gen * matha
  <10.95> matha10 <12> <14.4> <17.28> <20.74>
  <24.88> matha12
  }{}
\DeclareSymbolFont{matha}{U}{matha}{m}{n}
\DeclareFontSubstitution{U}{matha}{m}{n}
2.	 From the mathabx.dcl file, copy all the required font declarations to your document 
preamble:
\DeclareMathSymbol{\leq}{3}{matha}{"A4}
\DeclareMathSymbol{\nleq}{3}{matha}{"A6}
3.	 Test those declarations:
If $A \leq B$, then $B \nleq A$.
Take a look at the output:
If A ď B, then B ę A.

Chapter 3
99
Compare to the symbols in the default font without our redefinition:
If A ≤B, then B ̸≤A.
Perhaps you can see a motivation in changing the look of such a specific symbol, regarding 
parallel lines, writing habits, and vertical centering.
How it works...
By simply copying and pasting, we copied the behavior of the symbol package. We chose only 
the relevant symbols. The commands are described in detail in the previously mentioned 
fntguide documentation; refer to it for details. Here, we primarily need to copy the exact 
data from the package source code, because it's designed that way.
We redefined the original \leq command, since we don't need to have two versions, as it's 
recommendable to decide for only one for consistency. However, you can freely choose a 
name, for example:
\DeclareMathSymbol{\myleq}{3}{matha}{"A4}
Writing bold mathematical symbols
There are several ways of getting bold mathematical symbols. A classic way is directly 
provided by LaTeX. Take a look at this code:
\boldmath $y=f(x)$\unboldmath
It works in the following way:
1.	 In text mode, we switch to bold math alphabets.
2.	 We enter the math mode, in which bold symbols are always chosen, if available.
3.	 We leave the math mode.
4.	 While in the text mode, we switch the math alphabets back to normal—nonbold.
But that's for making all symbols of a formula bold. Such kind of emphasizing is rather rare 
today, as it destroys the uniform grayness of the text from a typographer's point of view.

Adjusting Fonts
100
A more common requirement is to get bold versions of certain symbols. For example, bold 
symbols are often used for vectors and number systems.
In this recipe, we will take the most recommended approach to get bold symbols.
How to do it...
We will use the bm package as follows:
1.	 Load the bm package in your preamble. Do this after loading all the packages that 
define symbol fonts because the package works on a higher level. If you are not sure 
about this, enter the following line of code at the end of all font packages:
\usepackage{bm}
2.	 Declare a command for each bold symbol:
\bmdefine{\balpha}{\alpha}
\bmdefine{\bX}{X}
3.	 Use the new macros in your document within the math mode.
How it works...
The bm package does the following for us:
f
f
Determining available bold math fonts and using them if available
f
f
Falling back to poor man's bold if no bold version can be found, which means 
overprinting with slight offsets
f
f
Keeping the correct spacing of the symbol
f
f
Respecting the meaning of symbols, such as delimiters
As it has been made for math symbols, the new bold symbols also can only be used in the 
math mode.
There's more...
There are alternative ways for writing bold symbols. Let's take a look at some of these.

Chapter 3
101
Standard LaTeX
f
f
One standard command is \mathbf{argument}, which prints the argument in bold. 
However, there are a few drawbacks:


It switches from italics to the upright shape. So, what originally had the look 
of a variable, gets the appearance of an operator


It doesn't support many special characters; for example, \mathbf{\alpha} 
prints a normal nonbold Greek alpha letter
AMS-LaTeX and amsmath
f
f
The amsmath bundle, specifically, its amsbsy package, provides the  
\boldsymbol{argument} command, which also prints its argument in bold.  
It works for many more symbols, such as for Greek letters. Even if there's no bold 
version available, you can use \pmb{argument}, which provides a poor man's bold 
version of the argument.
Comparing bm and amsmath
This recipe recommends bm, which at first sight looks quite similar to \boldsymbol because 
it takes special care of the meaning and spacing. For a visual comparison, let's build a 
formula with many bold symbols to see the effects.
Take the following example into your LaTeX editor:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{bm}
\bmdefine{\bX}{X}
\bmdefine{\bi}{i}
\bmdefine{\bMinus}{-}
\bmdefine{\bSum}{\sum}
\bmdefine{\bLeft}{(}
\bmdefine{\bRight}{)}
\begin{document}
\[ \sum_{i} ( - X_{i} ) \]
\[ \bSum_{\bi} \bLeft \bMinus \bX_{\bi} \bRight \]
\end{document}

Adjusting Fonts
102
Compile that example, so we can compare the normal and bold versions:

i
(−Xi)



i
(−Xi)
Now, we switch to the amsmath version:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\newcommand{\bX}{\boldsymbol{X}}
\newcommand{\bi}{\boldsymbol{i}}
\newcommand{\bMinus}{\boldsymbol{-}}
\newcommand{\bSum}{\boldsymbol{\sum}}
\newcommand{\bLeft}{\boldsymbol{(}}
\newcommand{\bRight}{\boldsymbol{)}}
\begin{document}
\[ \sum_{i} ( - X_{i} ) \]
\[ \bSum_{\bi} \bLeft \bMinus \bX_{\bi} \bRight \]
\end{document}
The output is as follows:

i
(−Xi)

i( −Xi)
You can clearly see what happened:
f
f
The summation symbol is not bold.
f
f
The summation index has moved to another position.
f
f
The spacing between the parenthesis and minus sign has become too wide.
f
f
The italic correction after the X is lost as the kerning is too high. That is, the index is 
too far at the right now.

Chapter 3
103
It's not because of combining bold symbols, it also happens in normal interaction with bold 
and non-bold symbols. Some of the meanings of symbols and of clever TeX spacing are gone.
If you already work with amsmath and \boldsymbol, switching to bm is very easy: simply  
add \usepackage{bm} after \usepackage{amsmath}. The bm package redefines  
\boldsymbol to become its own version. This way, all flaws in the previous amsmath 
example will immediately be fixed.
Getting the sans serif mathematics font
There are situations where the sans-serif font is required for documents. It can be, for 
example, a requirement by the university or institute. It may even be a design decision, for 
example, presentation slides often use sans serif. It's the default behavior of the LaTeX 
beamer class.
You can switch to sans serif for the default text font family using this command:
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
In such a case, it's desirable to print math formulas in sans serif as well to get a consistent 
design. The beamer class already does this.
In this recipe, we will do that for an arbitrary class. We will change all math formulas to have a 
sans serif font.
How to do it...
We will use the sfmath package. Follow these steps to get sans serif math formulae:
1.	 Load the sfmath package. Do it after loading the font packages or commands that 
change the \sfdefault command:
\usepackage{sfmath}
2.	 If you use the default font, that is, Computer Modern, additionally load 
sansmathaccent:
\usepackage{sansmathaccent}
3.	 In your document, write math formulas as usual. For example, this formula from 
Chapter 1, The Variety of Document Types:
\[
  \int_a^b f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x \approx (b-a)
  \sum_{i=0}^n w_i f(x_i)
\]

Adjusting Fonts
104
4.	 Compile the document. Take a look at the appearance of the output:
 b
a
f (x) dx ≈(b −a)
n

i=0
wif (xi)
The math formulas are now written in sans serif. Looking closer, you can see that the sum 
operator and the integral sign still have serifs though.
How it works...
The sfmath package switches to sans serif math for the whole document. It automatically 
detects the available sans serif font. That's why it is important to load it after any  
changes made to \sfdefault. For example, if you use Helvetica, at first, write  
\usepackage{helvet} and then write \usepackage{sfmath}.
There's an issue with math accents. For example, with the default Computer Modern 
font, math accents such as \tilde, \dot, and \hat may be slightly misplaced, since 
the Computer Modern sans serif font doesn't provide the positioning information. The 
sansmathaccent package comes to the rescue. In the specific case of sfmath together 
with Computer Modern, it corrects that behavior. That's why we loaded that too.
There's more...
Instead of automatic font selection, you can let sfmath explicitly use a certain font using a 
package option:
f
f
cm: This is used for Computer Modern sans serif.
f
f
lm: This is used for Latin Modern sans serif (experimental).
f
f
helvet: This is used for Helvetica.
f
f
cmbright: This is used for CM-Bright.
f
f
tx: This is used for txfonts, which is a Times font bundle with Helvetiva-like sans 
serif set.
f
f
px: This is used for pxfonts, a Palatino font bundle, also with Helvetiva-like sans 
serif.

Chapter 3
105
Using the following options, you can gain even more control over fonts:
f
f
T1experimental: This is used to get T1 encoded maths (experimental, required  
for Latin Modern).
f
f
AlphT1experimental: This is required for using T1 encoding for \mathrm,  
\mathbf, \mathit, and \mathsf.
f
f
mathrmOrig, mathbfOrig, mathitOrig, mathsfOrig: These are used for 
preserving the original behavior of \mathrm, \mathbf, \mathit, or \mathsf, 
respectively. Otherwise, \mathrm can also display sans serif font, for example.
f
f
slantedGreek: This is used for getting slanted uppercase Greek letters.
So, a call of sfmath can look like this:
\usepackage[helvet,slantedGreek]{sfmath}
An alternative approach
Instead of sfmath, you can load the sansmath package:
\usepackage{sansmath}
Now you can switch on sans serif math using this:
\sansmath
If you would like to end this setting, you could call \unsansmath to stop it. There's even a 
sansmath environment, which switches to sans serif math inside. So this package  
provides a finer approach for the case that you don't need consistent sans serif math.
Sans serif fonts with direct math support
The easiest way of all is switching to a sans serif font that directly supports mathematics. We 
will discuss two ways to do this. Of course, this depends on whether you like that font at all.
Arev Sans
Bitstream Vera Sans, which is designed as a sans serif screen font, has been extended to 
include Greek, Cyrillic, and a lot of mathematical symbols. The result is the arev package.  
All you need to do to get sans serif math and text is to load it:
\usepackage{arev}

 b

ƒ() d≈(b −)

Read the name Arev backwards.
Kepler fonts
We already discussed the Kepler font bundle in our first recipe of this chapter. This is a 
complete font set that also supports sans serif math. You can get sans serif formulae using 
the following:
\usepackage[sfmath,lighttext]{kpfonts}
The previous example with Kepler fonts now looks like this:
 b
a
f(x)dx ≈(b −a)
n

i=0

Writing double stroke letters as if on a 
blackboard
Mathematicians need a lot of symbols for variables, constants, vectors, operators, sets, 
spaces, and a lot of other objects. So they use small and big Latin and Greek letters, 
calligraphic letters, or write upright, italic, or bold so that they can be distinguished from each 
other in the same document.
In a lecture, when writing on a blackboard or a whiteboard, it is difficult to write bold letters. 
So, double stroke letters showed up. Well, in our documents, we still can simply switch to 
bold, on the other hand double stroke letters for number systems are already very common. 
Furthermore, a typographer may like this, since it doesn't destroy the grayness of a text, in 
contrast to bold symbols.

Chapter 3
107
How to do it...
We will use the dsfont package. Follow these steps to get double stroke letters:
1.	 Load the dsfont package:
\usepackage{dsfont}
2.	 In your document, use the \mathds command:
\[
  \mathds{N} \subset \mathds{Z} \subset
  \mathds{Q} \subset \mathds{R} \subset \mathds{C}
\]
3.	 The output will now become:
N ⊂Z ⊂Q ⊂R ⊂C
How it works...
The dsfont package provides double stroke capital letters for the whole alphabet; lowercase 
letters are not supported. That's a design decision. At some stage, the symbols for 1, h, and k 
have been added.
There's more...
There are alternative font packages: amssymb, bbold, and bbm. They provide similar symbols. 
I selected dsfont because it matches the style I know from my math studies.
Such symbols, and thousands more, can be found in the Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol List. 
You can open it by typing the texdoc symbols command in the Command Prompt, or you 
can find it online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/symbols.

Enabling the searching and copying  
of ligatures
In certain cases, two or more consecutive characters are joined to a single glyph. This is called 
a ligature. LaTeX commonly does it for ff, fi, fl, ffi, ffl, and more, depending on the font. That's 
because font makers designed specific glyphs for certain character combinations.
While it looks fine in print and on screen, there is a caveat—if you copy text from the produced 
PDF file into another document, such as to a text document or a Word file, the ligatures may 
appear broken.
Another problem is searching for words containing ligatures in PDF files, which can simply fail 
as the ligature "ff" is not equivalent to the letter combination "ff".
We will now fix that.
How to do it...
We stick to the commonly used pdfLaTeX. There are several possible ways to fix it. The first 
way is this:
1.	 Insert the glyphtounicode.tex file into your document's preamble:
\input{glyphtounicode}
2.	 In the next line, activate the required pdfTeX feature:
\pdfgentounicode=1
How it works...
The glyphtounicode.tex file is part of pdfTeX and should be installed on your computer. 
You can find it using kpsewhich glyphtounicode.tex. It contains proper translations to 
alphabetic presentation, for example:
\pdfglyphtounicode{ff}{0066 0066}
\pdfglyphtounicode{fi}{0066 0069}
\pdfglyphtounicode{fl}{0066 006C}
\pdfglyphtounicode{ffi}{0066 0066 0069}
\pdfglyphtounicode{ffl}{0066 0066 006C}
By setting \pdfgentounicode=1, we enabled the translation.

Chapter 3
109
There's more...
The cmap package also makes it possible to search and copy characters for making PDF files 
using the following command:
\usepackage{cmap}
The mmap package is an extension of cmap, which also works with math symbols. You can 
load it instead of cmap:
\usepackage{mmap}
If those methods don't work with a certain font or encoding, and you still need to fix it, you can 
take a look at the next recipe.
Suppressing ligatures
Ligatures raise the typographical quality and thus we should retain them. However, there may 
be a reason to disable them, for example, in verbatim text such as the source code.
Furthermore, it's possible that searching or copying of ligatures in a PDF file would fail, which 
we discussed in the previous recipe.
How to do it...
We will now see how to disable ligatures. We will use the microtype package:
1.	 Load the microtype package:
\usepackage{microtype}
2.	 Disable ligatures completely:
\DisableLigatures{encoding = *, family = * }
3.	 If you would like to restrict that feature to a certain font, you can specify it instead, 
such as:
\DisableLigatures{encoding = T1, family = tt* }
4.	 You may even suppress just the selected ligatures using the following command. 
Specify the letter that starts the ligature.
\DisableLigatures[f]{encoding = *, family = * }

Adjusting Fonts
110
How it works...
Suppressing ligatures is one of the many features of the microtype package. Using the 
preceding interface, you can switch off some or all the ligatures. Beware, the text doesn't look 
so nice anymore. Even the kerning of the font is disabled.
Besides the well-known letter ligatures, LaTeX knows more of them, such as the upside-down 
exclamation and question mark, double quote marks, guillemots, and wide dashes inserted  
by -- and ---. It can be a good idea to not turn off all ligatures. When all ligatures are  
turned off, there are still commands for writing those ligatures, such as \textendash and  
\textemdash for the wide dashes.
Adding a contour
When a text is printed over a background, it is much more readable with a contour around 
in overprinting the background. This contour may be white. This way, there would be a nice 
clearance around the text.
Another utilization would be to improve the visibility of the text with very light color for better 
reading on a white background.
Let's see how to achieve that.
How to do it...
Our example will use yellow color for chapter headings in a book. This is hardly readable, so 
we will add a contour to improve it:
1.	 We will use the scrbook class, so start your document with the following:
\documentclass{scrbook}
2.	 Load the contour package. Specify the thickness of the contour and a number that 
stands for text copies internally used for overprinting.
\usepackage{contour}
\contourlength{1.5pt}
\contournumber{25}
3.	 Define a macro for the new font style for our chapter:
\newcommand{\chapterfont}[1]{%
\contour{black}{\textcolor{yellow}{#1}}}

Chapter 3
111
4.	 Apply the style that we just selected:
\setkomafont{chapter}{\Huge\chapterfont}
5.	 Now, your chapter headings will be in yellow with a black contour. You can verify it by 
completing the code to a small compilable document. Add the following to:
\begin{document}
\chapter{Introduction}
Text follows.
\end{document}
6.	 Compile the document, and take a look at the output:
1 Introduction
Text follows.
How it works...
The package creates a contour by placing copies of the text around it. The thickness of this 
contour can be specified as seen.
The \setkomafont command can use a macro at the end, which takes an argument. This 
will be the heading text in this case, handed over to our newly-defined macro.
A vector font is required, which is recommended in any case. This should be a so called Type 1 
font. With pdfLaTeX, TrueType fonts are supported too.
If your engine supports it, you can even let the contour generate a real outline of the text, 
instead of using copies, which should result in a better quality. For example, with pdfTeX, you 
can add package options to enable it:
\usepackage[pdftex,outline]{contour}

With XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, you can use even system fonts such as TrueType fonts and 
feature rich OpenType fonts. That's actually LaTeX basing on the new engines called XeTeX 
and LuaTeX. Those names are more popular.
The TeX User Group has a good page for starting with XeLaTeX:
http://www.tug.org/xetex/
LuaLaTeX is a good choice when you need additional programming features, since it adds the 
Lua programming language. You can read about it at http://www.luatex.org.

Introduction
You can include external images into a LaTeX document. Only a few image file formats are 
supported by LaTeX. We will discuss supported formats and the differences between them.
After discussing quality aspects, we will take a look at the concept of floating figures for 
automated positioning for well-balanced text heights on pages.
Then, we will look at some recipes that can be used for making images, especially photos,  
more decorative.

Working with Images
114
Finally, we will arrange images with alignment, in a grid, or even on top of each other.
While this chapter is about using images, you can read about creating images in Chapter 9, 
Creating Graphics. In this chapter, we will focus on required commands without starting each 
document with \documentclass and ending it by \end{document}. You can download full 
code examples from http://latex-cookbook.net.
Including images with optimal quality
First, ensure that your images originally have good quality.
Bitmap images, such as JPG/JPEG and PNG, have a fixed number of pixels, so by scaling 
they may become blurry or pixelated. You may notice this in the images in this book as the 
production process required bitmap images instead of the original LaTeX output in PDF 
format.
Vector images, in contrast, are scalable without loss of quality. You can zoom in and out and 
they keep looking fine. An example of this is the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. It's 
not natively supported by LaTeX, but it can be converted to PDF or to TikZ (PGF). We will talk 
about TikZ and PGF in Chapter 9, Creating Graphics. Portable Document Format (PDF) and 
PostScript (PS) are vector formats, although they are allowed to contain bitmap images. 
Vector formats should be preferred over bitmap formats.
Today, pdfLaTeX is most widely used. It allows the inclusion of PDF images. Furthermore, the 
bitmap formats, JPG/JPEG, and PNG can be used. Classic LaTeX, which generates Device 
independent file format (DVI) files, only supports Encapsulated PostScript (EPS). This is 
a PostScript format with some restrictions; for example, it cannot span several pages. It is 
intended to be embedded in documents. To make embedding easier, an EPS file contains 
additional dimension information.
Getting ready
When you produce diagrams or drawings using an external program, always try to export them 
in a vector format. Often, programs can export to PDF or PS format. There are also printer 
drivers, which can generate PDF or PS files based on the ghostscript.
If your images are originally bitmap images, such as photos or screenshots, there's usually 
nothing to gain by simply converting to PDF or EPS. Situations where images can actually be 
vectorized by interpolating with a tool are pretty rare and are for rather simple images. For 
example, Inkscape has a tracing feature for vectorizing bitmaps.

Chapter 4
115
So, for different types of images, we should prepare differently:
f
f
Drawings and diagrams: Save them in a scalable format such as PDF or EPS.
f
f
Photos: Click them at high resolution. If the camera saves as JPG, you can directly 
include it. However, if you would like to edit your images, change them to PNG format, 
which has a lossless compression, in contrast to JPG.
f
f
Screenshots: Save them in PNG format and not as JPG. This is also  a bitmap, but 
PNG preserves the original quality. You can make high-resolution screenshots of 
smaller dialog windows if you switch to a bigger system font and use the highest 
screen resolution.
Don't resize the images before including them. The PDF viewer or printer driver will do the 
scaling depending on the device resolution.
How to do it...
The graphicx package is the standard tool, which we will now use. Follow these steps:
1.	 Choose a supported format. If necessary, convert your image to such a format. With 
classical LaTeX, which produces DVI output, use EPS format. With pdfLaTeX, use PDF, 
JPG/JPEG, or PNG format.
2.	 Load the graphicx package once in the document preamble:
\usepackage{graphicx}
3.	 At the place in the document where the image should appear, insert the following 
command:
\includegraphics{filename}
If you need to fit to a certain width or height, add it as an argument (as follows) using 
half of the width of the text:
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{filename}
Note that you can use absolute values with units such as cm, mm, or in:
\includegraphics[width=5cm, height=3cm,
  keepaspectratio]{filename}
The preceding command is for limiting both dimensions, but the keepaspectratio 
command is used for preventing distortion of the image.
4.	 For bitmaps, you may enable interpolation as follows:
\includegraphics[interpolate]{filename}

Working with Images
116
How it works...
The \includegraphics command has a mandatory argument, which is the filename of the 
image. The name can be used without a file name extension.
Furthermore, the command understands a lot of options in key=value form. This way, we 
specified width and height. More options are shown in the next recipe.
The interpolate option activates the interpolation for bitmaps, which is supported in PDF. 
That is, if you zoom in on a raster image, you won't see big pixels. Instead, a smooth transition 
between adjacent color values would be applied by a capable PDF reader.
Automating image positioning
When there's not enough free space on a page when you include an image, that image will go 
to the next page. This will leave white space at the end of the page. You could manually move 
some text to compensate. But imagine having a large document with many images; manually 
moving images to balance page breaks could cause a headache. Fortunately, LaTeX provides 
an automatism for us.
How to do it...
This is a very common way of including images as figures:
1.	 Use a figure environment.
2.	 Center the content, if desired.
3.	 Include the image.
4.	 Add a caption.
5.	 Add a label for cross-referencing.
A typical command sequence is as follows:
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{filename}
  \caption{Some text}
  \label{fig:name}
\end{figure}
In the document, you can refer to the figure number by using the \label{fig:name} 
command.

Chapter 4
117
How it works...
The automatism is called floating, and it works for images; that means figures and tables. A 
figure environment lets its content float to the next available place. For example, when a 
page runs out of space, a figure can move to the top of the next page. Text, which comes after 
the figure in the document code, would be moved so that it appeared before the figure, to fill 
the page.
You noticed the preceding options htbp!. These characters allow placement here (if there is 
space), at the top, at the bottom, or on a dedicated page. The exclamation mark relaxes some 
typographical restrictions to ease placement. All options together cause the output of figures 
as near as possible. Leave out an option to disallow certain places. For example, without 
option b, a figure would not float to the bottom, but may float to the top.
The \caption command sets text below the figure and gives it a number. If you use the  
\label command, it has to go after the \caption command to get the correct number. The 
prefix fig: has been used because it's good practice for indicating types of cross-reference, 
such as tab: for tables and eq: for equations.
There's more 
If the automated positioning of images would not be the optimal choice for your document, there 
are ways to limit it or to temporarily deactivate it. We will take a look at these options now.
Limiting the floating figures and tables
Floating figures don't cross chapter borders. However, they may go to a later section. If you 
would like to restrict the floating so figures and tables stay within the same section, load the 
placeins package in your preamble with the section option:
\usepackage[section]{placeins}
You can also load the placeins package without options. In any case, it gives you a new 
command. You can now use the command \FloatBarrier to block floating beyond this point.
The command \clearpage ends the page and forces the output of all 
floats that are not yet placed.
Fixing the position of a figure
Sometimes figures should stay at a certain position. Disabling floating is easy: simply don't 
use a figure environment. However, if you would like to use the very same syntax as the 
preceding one, just without floating, you can achieve it by using the following command in the 
document preamble:
\usepackage{float}

Working with Images
118
Now, start a figure environment with the H option:
\begin{figure}[H]

There's an extensive document about using imported graphics in LaTeX. It includes a thorough 
explanation of the concept of floats. It's available on CTAN at http://mirrors.ctan.org/
info/epslatex/english/epslatex.pdf.
Manipulating images
Before including it in a document, an image should be prepared using graphics software. 
LaTeX is not the right tool for post-processing of images. However, there are some basic ways 
to customize the way an image is included.
How to do it...
The graphicx package allows customization via simple options:
f
f
By scaling an image, you can specify a scaling factor, like so:
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{filename}
f
f
You can resize to a fixed width, using width and height options as in the  
previous recipe.
f
f
You can rotate by specifying a clockwise rotation angle, like so:
\includegraphics[angle=90]{filename}
f
f
You can rotate around a certain origin by adding a key, such as c for center, B for  
the base line, and l, r, t, and b for left, right, top, and bottom, respectively.  
A combination would be understood, such as tl for top-left corner:
\includegraphics[angle=90,origin=tl]{filename}
f
f
You can trim and clip, like here, where we cut off 1 cm at the left, 2 cm at the bottom, 
3 cm at the right, and 4 cm at the top:
\includegraphics[trim=1cm 2cm 3cm 4cm,clip]{filename}
You can read all details in the package manual, which you can access by typing the  
texdoc graphicx command in Command Prompt, or by visiting http://texdoc.net/
pkg/graphicx.

Chapter 4
119
Adding a frame to an image
You can add a simple frame to an image or to text by using the \frame{...},  
\framebox{...}, or \fbox{...} commands. However, this would give a simple box with thin 
black lines and a certain distance to the content. How about changing the color, line thickness, 
or distance? The classic way to do the latter is by changing the LaTeX lengths \fboxrule and  
\fboxsep. It's a bit laborious, especially when the lengths can vary. It can be made easier.
How to do it...
We will load the adjustbox package. It provides several useful commands for modifying 
boxes. It implicitly loads the graphicx package and exports its own features to the  
\includegraphics command. Follow these steps:
1.	 Load the xcolor package:
\usepackage{xcolor}
2.	 Load the adjustbox package with the export option:
\usepackage[export]{adjustbox}
3.	 At the place in your document where the image is to be placed, use the  
\includegraphics command, like in the previous recipe. This time,  
add the cframe option:
\includegraphics[width=10cm,
  cframe=red!50!black 5mm]{filename}
4.	 Compile the document, like I did with a photo of my dog. Now, you can see a frame 
fitting right around the image:

Working with Images
120
How it works...
The xcolor package provides commands for specifying colors by name and for mixing color. 
Here, with its syntax red!50!black, we chose 50 percent red color mixed with black.
The adjustbox package is capable of exporting some of its features. We activated that 
export; now we can use additional options with the known \includegraphics command. 
We chose the cframe option for a colored frame, which has this syntax:
cframe=color thickness separation margin
The color parameter is mandatory, and the xcolor package is required. The other values 
are optional lengths, but are understood in this order. So, we chose a frame thickness of 5 
mm and kept the default zero inner separation and outer margin.
There's a similar frame option which works without the color value; that is, without value  
or up to three lengths given for thickness, separation, and margin.
The companion cfbox and fbox options work in a similar way, just internally based on the  
\fbox command instead of the \frame command. In other words, they use the default 
thickness of the \fboxrule command, and the content separation of the \fboxsep command.
Cutting an image to get rounded corners
The previous recipe gave us an edged image. It can be nice to have rounded corners, so let us 
take a look at how to achieve that.
How to do it...
We will use a few features of the very capable tikz graphics package:
1.	 Load the tikz package in your preamble:
\usepackage{tikz}
2.	 Declare a box  for storing the image:
\newsavebox{\picbox}
3.	 Define a macro that allows us to use our recipe repeatedly:
\newcommand{\cutpic}[3]{
  \savebox{\picbox}{\includegraphics[width=#2]{#3}}
  \tikz\node [draw, rounded corners=#1, line width=4pt,
    color=white, minimum width=\wd\picbox,

Chapter 4
121
    minimum height=\ht\picbox, path picture={
      \node at (path picture bounding box.center) {
        \usebox{\picbox}};
    }] {};}
4.	 Use the new macro within your document to include an image:
\cutpic{1cm}{8cm}{filename}
5.	 Compile the document to see the effect:
How it works...
After loading the tikz package, we created a box to store the image. We defined a macro;  
its first task is to store our image in the box by using the \savebox command.
The new macro \cutpic takes three arguments:
f
f
A length for the rounding value
f
f
The width of the image
f
f
Its filename
The command \tikz is an abbreviation of the \begin{tikzpicture} …  
\end{tikzpicture} command, which is handy for simple figures. Here, the figure  
is just a single node with some options.

Working with Images
122
The option rounded corners=width produces the shape of a rounded rectangle for the 
node. We chose to let it draw in white color with 4 pt thickness. At this place, you can choose 
a color you like.
While the node has an empty node text, we required a minimum height and width to match 
the size of our image. Now our box comes into play: we measured its width and height for 
handing over to the node with the TeX primitive commands \wd and \ht.
Finally, we used an advanced option of TikZ. The path picture=code command fills a  
path of the drawing by executing the given code. The result of the code will be clipped by 
that path. So, instead of filling with a color, a pattern, or a shade, we printed out the image 
by using the \usebox command. For this, we encapsulated the image in its own node, and 
placed it at the center.
There's more...
TikZ usually offers more than one way of doing something. An alternative approach would be 
to use the current bounding box node to define a clip path, or to simply draw a rectangle 
with rounded corners in white color over the image.
Using nodes has the advantages that you will get anchors for alignment, for connecting by edges 
or arrows that you can name it and refer to it, and that you get shapes and further options right 
away. You can also use it for alignment, which we will demonstrate in the next recipe.
In Chapter 9, Creating Graphics, you will learn more about TikZ.
Shaping an image like a circle
A circle shape is a neat option for portrait photos or for images arranged in a graph or a tree.
How to do it...
Like in the previous recipe, we will define a TikZ macro for this purpose. Let's take a look at 
the following steps:
1.	 Load the tikz package:
\usepackage{tikz}
2.	 Define a macro so we can use it often:
\newcommand{\roundpic}[4][]{
  \tikz\node [circle, minimum width = #2,
    path picture = {
      \node [#1] at (path picture bounding box.center) {

Chapter 4
123
        \includegraphics[width=#3]{#4}};
    }] {};}
3.	 Use the new macro within your document to include an image:
\roundpic[xshift=-1cm,yshift=-2.6cm]{5.8cm}{9cm}{filename}
4.	 Compile the document. When I used the photo of my dog, I got the following image:
How it works...
Refer to the previous recipe to understand the TikZ node construction with the path 
picture command. This time, we used a circle for the outer node, so our image got cropped 
in to a circular shape. We used four arguments. The first optional argument can contain 
node options. In our example, we used them to shift the image for better positioning in the 
cut window. The remaining options are the width of the node, the width of the image, and, of 
course, the name of the image file.
There's more...
When we normally include images, the base line is at the bottom. We can change it to be at 
the center, for positioning. In such a case, we can give the node a name and then tell TikZ to 
use the center of the node as the baseline for aligning the whole image, as follows:
\newcommand{\roundpic}[4][]{
  \tikz[baseline=(photo.center)]
    \node (photo) [circle, minimum width = #2,
      path picture = {
        \node [#1] at (path picture bounding box.center)
        {\includegraphics[width=#3]{#4}};
}] {};}

Drawing over an image
If you need to add text, arrows, or other annotations to an image, it's preferable to do so within 
LaTeX. Compared to using external graphics software, there are a few advantages:
f
f
You can use the same fonts as in the LaTeX document
f
f
Your annotations would be scalable in perfect quality, even if you would draw over a 
bitmap image
f
f
You can use macros from your preamble or packages
f
f
The style would be consistent with your other drawings and diagrams
f
f
You can change it at any time, and document-wide adjustments also have their 
desired effects on this annotated image
How to do it…
We will draw with TikZ. The key is using the onimage package. If this is not available in your 
TeX distribution or on CTAN, you can download it from Launchpad at http://bazaar.
launchpad.net/~tex-sx/tex-sx/development/view/head:/onimage.dtx.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Within the LaTeX document preamble, load the onimage package:
\usepackage{onimage}
2.	 Define TikZ styles for your annotations:
\tikzset{annotations/.style = {
  tsx/show help lines,
  every path/.append style = {very thick, color = yellow},
  every node/.append style = {yellow,
                              font = \bfseries\sffamily}}}
3.	 In your document body, use the tikzonimage environment:
\begin{tikzonimage}[width=.8\textwidth]{filename}
  [annotations]
  \draw[dashed] (0.59,0.71)  -- (0.86,0.12)
                (0.634,0.71) -- (0.86,0.12);
  \draw[dotted] (0.56,0.85)  -- (0.86,0.12)
                (0.66,0.85)  -- (0.86,0.12);
  \draw (0.3,0.4) edge[->] (0.68,0.4)
        (0.3,0.4) edge[->] (0.3,0.93);

Chapter 4
125
  \node[rotate=90] at (0.28,0.8) {height};
  \node            at (0.62,0.35) {velocity};
\end{tikzonimage}
4.	 Compile, like I did with a photo of my dog. Now you can see the additional 
illustrations:
How it works...
You can download a complete code example at http://latex-cookbook.net. Loading 
the onimage package automatically loaded the tikz graphics package. Using the \tikzset 
command, we defined a style named annotations, so we can easily apply it at several 
places. In this style, we activated the tsx/show help lines option, which draws a grid 
over the image. We can use this later for getting coordinates visually. For the final document, 
we comment out or delete this option to remove the grid.
Furthermore, we defined that every path in such annotations should be drawn in yellow and 
very thick, and all text in nodes should have a bold sans serif font in yellow color. Since we did 
this only for the annotations style, other drawings won't be affected.
For the image itself, we used the tikzonimage environment. Its syntax is as follows:
\begin{tikzonimage}[image options]{filename}[TikZ options]
  ... your TikZ code ...
\end{tikzonimage}

Working with Images
126
This handy environment has the following features:
f
f
It implicitly creates a tikzpicture environment with the given TikZ options
f
f
It includes the image within a node, passing the image options and filename 
parameters to the \includegraphics command
f
f
It gives a coordinate system with the origin at the lower-left corner of the image
f
f
It makes the coordinate system relative to the image size; that is, the point (1,1) or 
the upper-right corner of the image
f
f
It draws a grid of help lines, if desired
As this has already been done for us, we can concentrate on the actual drawing commands. 
We used standard TikZ syntax:
f
f
Drawing dashed and dotted lines between coordinates in parentheses; all lines 
inherit the very thick and yellow styles
f
f
Drawing arrows, which are edges with an arrow shape, done by the -> option
f
f
Placing a rotated node and a normal node with text, inheriting the yellow bold sans 
serif font from the annotations style
The grid helps to get the desired coordinates for perfect placement, adjust the estimated 
coordinates, and compile again. Since the coordinates are relative, scaling the whole image 
doesn't matter.
You may additionally use further TikZ features, including shapes, arrows, colors, fadings, and 
transparency. Some of them you will see in Chapter 9, Creating Graphics.
Aligning images
By default, the baseline of an image is at its bottom. So, adjacent images would be aligned  
at the bottom. However, alignment at the top, or vertically centered alignment, may be 
desirable instead.
How to do it...
We will use the \height macro for shifting to get vertical centering. Let's take a look at the 
following steps:
1.	 Load the graphicx package. For testing, or if you don't have images, add the demo 
option to use black rectangles in place of images:
\usepackage[demo]{graphicx}

Chapter 4
127
2.	 In your document, use the \raisebox command, together with half of the \height 
command:
\raisebox{-0.5\height}{\includegraphics[height=4cm,
  width=8cm]{filename1}}
\hfill
\raisebox{-0.5\height}{\includegraphics[height=2cm,
  width=4cm]{filename2}}
3.	 Your images, in the demo case, black-filled rectangles, will be vertically centered 
aligned:
How it works...
The \height command returns the current height above the base line. The \totalheight 
command would include the height below the base line, which doesn't exist in our case.
We raised each box by minus half of its height, so we got vertical centering. Even text before 
or after would be aligned to the middle, because we lowered all the boxes.
Writing the following command would give us top alignment of the images:
\raisebox{-\height}{\includegraphics{...}}
The adjustbox package provides a lot of user commands for aligning 
boxes with text or images.

Working with Images
128
Arranging images in a grid
A larger set of photos, plots, or diagrams could be loaded by using the \includegraphics 
command with some space in between, possibly arranged using the minipage environments. 
A for loop may help if the file names can be generated.
In this recipe, we will produce a grid of aligned images with arbitrary names easy to arrange.
How to do it...
We will use a tabular environment for positioning. That's no surprise yet. However, we will 
read in the tabular cell content, which we will then use as file names for inclusion. The 
collcell package provides the required feature. Let's take a look at the following steps:
1.	 Load the graphicx package and the collcell package:
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{collcell}
2.	 Define a command for including an image with chosen width and height:
\newcommand{\includepic}[1]{\includegraphics[width=3cm,
  height=2cm,keepaspectratio]{#1}}
3.	 Define a new column type that uses that new command in its column specification. 
We use the letter i for image:
\newcolumntype{i}{@{\hspace{1ex}}
  >{\collectcell\includepic}c<{\endcollectcell}}
4.	 In your document, use a tabular environment with the new column type. Again, 
photos of a small dog will serve as an example, because he doesn't complain. The 
cells contain the basic file name; that is, meadow for meadow.jpg, and so on:
\begin{tabular}{iii}
  meadow  & sea     & beach \\
  blanket & tunnel  & tired \\
  pond    & chewing & halfasleep
\end{tabular}

Chapter 4
129
5.	 Compile the document and check out the result:
How it works...
For automation, we used the \newcolumntype command from the array package. 
This package is implicitly loaded by using the collcell package. @{\hspace{1ex}} 
is a command for changing the intercolumn space to 1ex. This is useful for adjusting the 
tabular spacing. The array syntax >{...} inserts code before a cell, while the <{...} 
syntax inserts code after it.
However, we cannot simply write the >{\includegraphics{} and <{}} syntax just to 
enclose the filename in the \includegraphics{...} command. We cannot avoid the  
fact that the compiler will take the curly braces literally, mixing array syntax with the  
\includegraphics command argument braces.
The collcell package comes to the rescue. Its command \collectcell starts reading in 
the cell content. Its command \endcollectcell states the end of that content, which will 
be provided to the user's macro. The latter is the argument for the \collectcell command; 
in our case, this is the \includepic command. We defined this macro to encapsulate the  
\includegraphics command together with our desired options, including the image width.
Now we can simply enter image file names in columns, given that we used this column type. 
Of course, it can be combined with standard column types.

Stacking images
We can also stack images on top of each other, such as for a fancy photo collage. This can be 
combined with the previous recipes to do things like rotating and framing. Let's take a look at 
pure stacking.
How to do it...
The stackengine package allows the placement of things above each other. It can  
handle text and math as well as images. Let's try it with the latter, using sample images. 
Follow these steps:
1.	 In your document preamble, load the mwe package. It provides dummy images  
and automatically loads the graphicx package, which we would otherwise load 
ourselves, as before:
\usepackage{mwe}
2.	 Load the stackengine package:
\usepackage{stackengine}
3.	  In the document body, use the command \stackinset. It takes six arguments.  
This sounds complicated, but it allows flexible positioning. The syntax is as follows:
\stackinset{horizontal alignment}
    {horizontal offset}
    {vertical aligment}
    {vertical offset}
    {image above}{image below}
In our recipe, we use right and top alignment and shift by 2cm horizontally  
and vertically:
\stackinset{r}{2cm}{t}{2cm}{%
  \includegraphics{example-image}}{%	
  \includegraphics[angle=-10]{example-image}}

Chapter 4
131
4.	 Compile the document, and you will get the following result:
How it works...
Let's break down the preceding syntax:
f
f
Horizontal alignment can be l for left, c for center, or r for right aligned. In the case 
of right alignment, the offset means shifting to the left by this length, or otherwise to 
the right.
f
f
Vertical alignment can be t for top, c for center, or b for bottom aligned. In  
the case of top alignment, the offset means shifting down by this length, or  
otherwise upwards.
You can also specify negative lengths or leave it empty for zero offset.
Besides this, for images, you can use the \stackinset command for stacking letters and 
symbols, for example \stackinset{c}{}{c}{}{$\star$}{O}:
This produces a big letter O with a star inside:

Working with Images
132
You can mix images and text. This way you could place any annotation over an image, by using 
commands such as the following:
\stackinset{l}{1em}{t}{1em}{Inside annotation}{%
  \includegraphics[width=5cm]{example-image}}
This results in the following image:
You can nest several \stackinset commands for placing several annotations or for stacking 
several images.
To see all the features in detail, take a look at the stackengine manual. You can access  
it by typing the texdoc stackengine command in Command Prompt, or by visiting 
http://texdoc.net/pkg/stackengine.

2.	 Set up the background. Optionally, specify scaling factor, rotation angle, and  
opacity. Provide the command for printing in the background. We will use the  
\includegraphics command here, with a drawing of the CTAN lion:
\backgroundsetup{scale = 1, angle = 0, opacity = 0.2,
  contents = {\includegraphics[width = \paperwidth,
  height = \paperheight, keepaspectratio] {ctanlion.pdf}}}
3.	 Compile the document at least twice to let the layout settle. Now, all of your pages will 
show a light version of the image over the whole page background, like this:

How it works...
The background package can place any text, drawing, or image, on the page background.  
It provides options for position, color, and opacity. The example already showed some  
self-explanatory parameters. They can be given as package options or by using the  
\backgroundsetup command. This command can be used as often as you like to  
make changes.
The contents option contains the actual commands, which will be applied to the 
background. This can simply be \includegraphics, some text, or any sequence  
of drawing commands.
The package is based on TikZ and the everypage package. It can require several compiling 
runs before the positioning is finally correct. This is because TikZ writes the position marks 
into the .aux file, which gets read in and processed in the next LaTeX run.
There's more...
Instead of images, you could display dynamic values such as the page number or the head 
mark with chapter title, instead of using a package such as fancyhdr, scrpage2, or 
scrlayer-scrpage.
The following command places a page number on the background:
\backgroundsetup{placement = top, angle = 0,
  scale = 4, color = blue!80,vshift = -2ex,
  contents = {--\thepage--}}
The preceding command does the following with the page number:
f
f
It is placed at the top
f
f
It is placed with customizable rotation, here 0 degrees
f
f
It is scaled four times the size of normal text
f
f
It is colored with 80 percent of standard blue (like mixed with 20 percent of white)
f
f
It is vertically shifted by 2ex downwards
f
f
It is placed with dashes around

quet aliquam, luctus a, egestas a, turpis. Mauris lacinia lorem sit amet
ipsum. Nunc quis urna dictum turpis accumsan semper.
To demonstrate how you can draw with TikZ on the background, let's take a look at an 
example. The following commands draw a rounded border and fill the interior background  
with light yellow color:
\usetikzlibrary{calc}
\backgroundsetup{angle = 0, scale = 1, vshift = -2ex,
  contents = {\tikz[overlay, remember picture]
    \draw [rounded corners = 20pt, line width = 1pt,
           color = blue, fill = yellow!20, double = blue!10]
           ($(current page.north west)+(1cm,-1cm)$)
           rectangle ($(current page.south east)+(-1,1)$);}}
Here, we first loaded the calc library, which provides syntax for the coordinate calculations  
that we used at the end. A TikZ image in overlay mode draws a rectangle with rounded 
corners. It has double lines with yellow in between. The rectangle dimensions are calculated 
from the position of the current page node, which stands for the whole page. The full code 
example can be downloaded at http://latex-cookbook.net. The result looks like this:

Further options for TikZ node parameters are explained in the package manual, which 
also contains some examples. It also shows how to select only certain pages to have 
this background. You can open it by typing the texdoc background command into the 
command line or by visiting http://texdoc.net/pkg/background.
There are more packages that can perform tasks similar to those covered in this recipe; for 
example, watermark, xwatermark, and the packages everypage and eso-pic, which 
don't require TikZ.
Creating beautiful ornaments
Especially in older books, we can find typographic ornaments such as calligraphic flowers.  
In this recipe, we will create a greetings card with ornaments.
Getting ready
We will use the pgfornaments package. At the time of writing, it was not yet part of a  
TeX distribution. This may change soon; until then, you can visit the package homepage 
(http://altermundus.com/pages/tkz/ornament/index.html) to download  
and for install information. Install it before you move on.
How to do it...
We will use a KOMA-Script class, because of its arbitrary base font size. The calligra 
package provides a font with a hand-written appearance:
1.	 Load the document class, set paper and text dimensions, and choose an empty  
page style, so there's no page number printed automatically:
\documentclass[paper=a6,landscape,fontsize=30pt]{scrartcl}
\areaset{0.9\paperwidth}{0.68\paperheight}
\pagestyle{empty}

Chapter 5
139
2.	 Activate T1 font encoding and load the calligra font package:
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{calligra}
3.	 Load the pgfornaments package. It implicitly uses TikZ. In addition, load the calc 
library, which will be used for coordinate calculations:
\usepackage{pgfornament}
\usetikzlibrary{calc}
4.	 Now, write the document body:
\begin{document}
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    every node/.style       = {inner sep = 0pt},
    pgfornamentstyle/.style = {color     = green!50!black,
                               fill      = green!80!black}]
  \node [text width = 8cm, outer sep = 1.2cm,
    text centered, color = red!90!black] (Greeting)
    { \calligra Happy Birthday,\\Dear Mom!\\[-1ex]
      \pgfornament[color = red!90!black,
        width = 2.5cm]{72}};
  \foreach \corner/\sym in {north west/none, north east/v,
      south west/h, south east/c} {
      \node [anchor = \corner] (\corner)
        at (Greeting.\corner)
        {\pgfornament[width = 2cm, symmetry = \sym]{63}};}
  \path (north west) -- (south west)
          node [midway, anchor = east]
               {\pgfornament[height = 2cm]{9}}
        (north east) -- (south east)
          node [midway, anchor = west]
               {\pgfornament[height = 2cm,
                symmetry = v]{9}};
  \pgfornamenthline{north west}{north east}{north}{87}
  \pgfornamenthline{south west}{south east}{south}{87}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

5.	 Compile the document, and take a look at the output:
Happy Birthday,
Dear Mom!
How it works...
The pgfornaments package currently provides 89 vector ornaments. They can be scaled 
while maintaining high quality. There are calligraphic flowers, tree leafs, and generic symbols 
and lines that can be used to achieve this kind of vintage design. The documentation contains 
a lot of information about how it's been done and how it can be used.
The basic command is \pgfornament[options]{number}. number stands for the chosen 
ornament, numbered according to the order in which they are listed in the package manual. 
The options can be a comma separated list of expressions. Let's take a look at the following 
options:
f
f
scale: This can be a positive value; by default, it is 1
f
f
width and height: These are LaTeX lengths
f
f
color: This can be any color understandable to TikZ
f
f
ydelta: This can be set to vertically shift
f
f
symmetry: This can get a value v, h, c, or none to get the ornament with vertical, 
horizontal, central, or no mirroring

Chapter 5
141
In our example, we used it in this way:
f
f
We set a TikZ style which as an inner sep value of 0 pt, so that nodes don't have 
additional whitespace around them.
f
f
We set the pgfornamentstyle parameter to be dark green and filled with lighter 
green.
f
f
A node that we called Greeting contains the handwritten text in dark red Calligra 
font. In addition, it contains the ornament number 72.
f
f
Using the TikZ \foreach syntax, we placed the ornament number 63 at each corner 
with a suitable symmetry, with relative positioning to our Greeting node.
f
f
We placed the ornament number 9 on the left- and right-hand sides. We used the 
midway option to place them right in the middle of the stated corners.
f
f
Finally, the command \pgfornamenthline is used to place ornament line number 
87 on the top and bottom edges.
There's more...
In the previous recipe, we talked about the background package for printing things on the 
page background. You can combine this with ornaments. This code in your preamble will print 
neat triangular ornaments with suitable symmetry in each corner of the page:
\usepackage{pgfornament}
\usepackage{background}
\backgroundsetup{angle = 0, scale = 1, opacity = 1,
  color = black!60,
  Contents = {\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture, overlay]
    \foreach \pos/\sym in {north west/none, north east/v,
      south west/h, south east/c} {
        \node[anchor = \pos] at (current page.\pos)
          {\pgfornament[width = 2cm, symmetry = \sym]{63}};}
  \end{tikzpicture}}}

Let's take a look at the output:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetuer adipiscing elit. Ut
purus elit, vestibulum ut, plac-
erat ac, adipiscing vitae, felis.
Curabitur dictum gravida mau-
ris. Nam arcu libero, nonummy
We used the current page node for positioning relative to the page corners. Also, this one 
requires several compiler runs to achieve final placement. A full code sample is in the code 
bundle for this book. You can download it at http://latex-cookbook.net.
There are fonts which provide typographical ornaments as glyphs; fourier-orns, adforn, 
and webomints are very good examples.
Preparing pretty headings
This recipe will showcase how to bring some color into document headings.
How to do it...
We will use TikZ for coloring and positioning. Follow these steps:
1.	 Set up a basic document with blindtext support:
\documentclass{scrartcl}
\usepackage[automark]{scrpage2}
\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage{blindtext}

Chapter 5
143
2.	 Load the tikz package beforehand, and pass a naming option to the implicitly 
loaded package xcolor to use names for predefined colors:
\PassOptionsToPackage{svgnames}{xcolor}
\usepackage{tikz}
3.	 Define a macro that prints the heading, given as an argument:
\newcommand{\tikzhead}[1]{%
  \begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
    \node[yshift=-2cm] at (current page.north west)
      {\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture, overlay]
          \path[draw=none, fill=LightSkyBlue] (0,0)
                rectangle (\paperwidth,2cm);
          \node[anchor=east,xshift=.9\paperwidth,
            rectangle, rounded corners=15pt,
            inner sep=11pt, fill=MidnightBlue,
                    font=\sffamily\bfseries] {\color{white}#1};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  };
\end{tikzpicture}}
4.	 Use the new macro for the headings, printing \headmark, and complete the 
document with some dummy text:
\clearscrheadings
\ihead{\tikzhead{\headmark}}
\pagestyle{scrheadings}
\begin{document}
\tableofcontents
\clearpage
\blinddocument
\end{document}

5.	 Compile the document and take a look at a sample page header:
2 Lists
ii. Second item in a list
b) Second item in a list
2. Second item in a list
2.3 Example for list (description)
First item in a list
Second item in a list
How it works...
We created a macro that draws a filled rectangle over the whole page width and puts a node 
with text inside it, shaped as a rectangle with rounded corners. It's just a brief glimpse at the 
TikZ drawing syntax, which we will explore in more detail in Chapter 9, Creating Graphics.
The main points are as follows:
f

Referring to the current page node for positioning, as in the first recipe of this chapter

The rest are drawing syntax and style options, described in the TikZ manual. You can read it 
by typing the texdoc tikz command in Command Prompt or by visiting http://texdoc.
net/pkg/tikz.
Producing a calendar
Self-made calendars can be a great gift. Also, for work and education, it would be great to 
have our own customized calendar.
In this recipe, we will print a calendar of a whole year, with all months arranged in a tabular 
layout. You can adjust it to print just one month below an image, for example.

Chapter 5
145
How to do it...
We will use the mighty TikZ bundle again, since it provides a calendar library:
1.	 Set up document class and page dimensions. Furthermore, change to empty 
pagestyle to not have page numbering:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[margin = 2.5cm, a4paper]{geometry}
\pagestyle{empty}
2.	 Load TikZ and its libraries calendar and positioning:
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{calendar,positioning}
3.	 To save the typing effort and for an easier change of year, define a macro for the year 
and one to call the TikZ \calendar command:
\newcommand{\calyear}{2016}
\newcommand{\mon}[1]{\calendar[dates = \calyear-#1-01
  to \calyear-#1-last] if (Sunday) [red];}
4.	 Now write the document containing a TikZ picture. The months' calendars are 
arranged in a matrix:
\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[every calendar/.style = {
      month label above centered,
      month text = {\Large\textsc{\%mt}},
      week list,
    }]
    \matrix (Calendar) [column sep = 4em, row sep = 3em] {
      \mon{01} & \mon{02} & \mon{03} \\
      \mon{04} & \mon{05} & \mon{06} \\
      \mon{07} & \mon{08} & \mon{09} \\
      \mon{10} & \mon{11} & \mon{12} \\ };
      \node [above = 1cm of Calendar, font = \Huge]
        {\calyear};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

How it works...
We used a matrix for easy positioning of the twelve months' calendars; we just specified the 
row and column spacing. While the given calendar style settings are pretty self-explanatory, 
modifying them requires knowledge of the options. The library is extensively explained in the 
TikZ manual, together with some examples, at http://texdoc.net/pkg/tikz.

Chapter 5
147
Based on the date calculation features and existing styles of the calendar library, you can use 
the bells and whistles of TikZ to get a colorful, fancy calendar. Some outstanding examples 
can be found in the TikZ gallery at http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/
feature/calendar-library/.
Mimicking keys and menu items
Technical documentation and software manuals often require to tell the reader about 
keyboard shortcuts, how to use the program menu, or in which directory files can be located. 
This recipe helps with writing such explanations.
How to do it...
We will use the menukeys package and try out its main commands. Follow these steps:
1.	 Start a short document and load the menukeys package in it:
\documentclass[parskip=full]{scrartcl}

How it works...
The menukeys package provides three main commands which parse their arguments  
as a list:
f
f
\keys{combination}: This command prints a key combination given by a list of 
keys separated by the + symbol
f
f
\menu{sequence}: This command prints a sequence of menu entries separated  
by the > symbol
f
f
\directory{path}: This command prints a file path in typewriter font, with 
components separated by the / symbol
The input as separated lists follows common conventions, and the output mimics what we 
expect to see on a computer screen.
Various aspects can be customized. There are several predefined styles, such as rounded and 
angular menus; rounded, angular and shadowed keys; and even vintage typewriter keys. Paths 
can use folder symbols. If this small example has whetted your appetite and you would like  
to modify the appearance further, have a look at the package manual. As usual, you can  
open it by typing the texdoc menukeys command in Command Prompt, or by visiting

Introduction
With LaTeX, we can create and print complex tables. In this chapter, we will first talk about 
achieving good readability. Some recipes will show and explain useful design elements.
While the recipes are based on standard LaTeX tabular environments, you can use them in 
a similar manner with tabular*, tabularx, tabulary, and related environments.
The tabular* environment achieves a desired table width by adjusting 
the spacing between columns. The tabularx environment also spans to a 
given width by automatically calculating column widths, trying to distribute 
available space evenly. The tabulary environment also balances column 
widths, but tries to give more space to columns with more content. These 
environments and packages are covered in LaTeX introductions such as in 
the LaTeX Beginner's Guide written by me.

Designing Tables
150
Even with the array environment, it's quite the same; it would just be in math mode. That's 
why you may also have a look at the recipes in Chapter 10, Advanced Mathematics, which 
deal with arrays and matrices. For example, highlighting in matrices, shown in Chapter 10, 
Advanced Mathematics, can be used with the tabular environment as well.
Creating a legible table
When we learn to write tables with LaTeX, we get to know how to write in rows and columns, 
and how to draw lines between cells and borders around the table. Though, using all borders 
can result in such a table:
∗
1
2
3
1
1
2
3
2
2
4
6
3
3
6
9
Such a habit may result from using WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) software  
such as Excel or Word to write tables. However, while such a grid is useful for entering data,  
it makes reading really difficult.
In good books, we can find more legible tables. Let's take a look at how to create one.
How to do it...
We will use the booktabs package, which has been written with good design in mind. 
Specifically, it enhances lines in tables. It focuses on horizontal lines with improved spacing 
and adjustable thickness.
For our example, we will sketch a table that shows the availability of certain structuring 
features in LaTeX's base classes. Here's how to do this:
1.	 Specify the class. You could simply use the article class for now:
\documentclass{article}
2.	  Load the booktabs package:
\usepackage{booktabs}
3.	 Load the bbding package, which provides a check mark symbol:
\usepackage{bbding}

Chapter 6
151
4.	 Within the document body, set up a table environment and create the tabular 
layout within. For convenience, here's the complete remaining code to copy:
\begin{document}
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}
  \begin{tabular}{lccccc}

Table 1: Structuring diﬀerences between standard LATEX classes

Designing Tables
152
How it works...
We used a table environment to get a table with a caption. This is the common container. 
From now on, we will focus on the actual structure. This is built and printed by the tabular 
environment. Both are well explained in LaTeX introductions, such as in the LaTeX Beginner's 
Guide by Packt Publishing. Refer to such a book to learn the details. Some are mentioned in 
the next recipe.
The basic syntax is this: an ampersand (&) ends a column, and a double backslash (\\) ends  
a row.
It's a good idea to end a line in the source code after \\. Also align 
ampersands, if possible, as this can improve code readability and make 
it easier to fill the right columns. You know that several consecutive 
spaces are treated as one, so some additional spacing doesn't hurt.
The booktabs package provides commands for horizontal lines, also called rules. This term 
originates from British typesetting. The differences between the booktabs package and 
standard LaTeX tabular lines are as follows:
f
f
More space above and below a line by default
f
f
Several kinds of rules with customizable thickness
Specifically, the commands are as follows:
f
f
\toprule: This command is used for a line at the top, often made thicker
f
f
\midrule: This command is used for lines within the table, commonly thinner than 
outer lines
f
f
\bottomrule: This command is used for a line at the bottom, mostly with the same 
thickness as the top line
f
f
\cmidrule: This command is used for a line spanning one, two, or more columns
The last command has a more sophisticated syntax:
\cmidrule[thickness](trim){a-b}
The thickness parameter is optional and can specify a desired thickness, such as 1pt.
The trim parameter is also optional and specifies a horizontal trimming, r for right and l for 
left. Both can be combined, as we did in the preceding example.

Chapter 6
153
The mandatory argument a-b defines that the line will span from column a to column b.
All commands understand an optional argument for the thickness; for example, you could also 
write the \toprule[1pt] command.
While the basic use can be seen in our example, the package manual explains more options 
for tweaking, such as changing the default thickness for each kind of rule and trim. You can 
read the manual by typing texdoc booktabs in Command Prompt, or by visiting http://
texdoc.net/pkg/booktabs.
There's more...
Besides good tools such as booktabs, a well thought out design is key to great tables.  
So let's sum up good advice given by typographers:
f
f
Respect the reading direction. This means the following:


Write text horizontally


Never use vertical lines


A few horizontal lines can support reading in the structure, such as below  
the header or between groups of content
The last two rules can both be changed for tables, which really should be  
read vertically.
f
f
Minimize what doesn't belong to the actual information, such as lines, dividers, 
boxes, colors, and font changes. Consequently, don't use double lines.
f
f
Leave whitespace around the table. Separating lines additionally may not be 
necessary then.
Generally, whitespace gives invisible support to the structure; that's why we increased the 
default \arraystretch value from 1 to 1.6. In the next recipe, structuring by whitespace  
is even more visible.
Here's the final advice regarding the content:
f
f
Align text for optimal readability or overall table design
f
f
Align decimal values at the decimal point for better comparing
f
f
Instead of repeatedly using units in cells, put the unit into the column header
f
f
Instead of repeating values, consider merging neighboring cells
The recipes later in this chapter will support us regarding these points.

Designing Tables
154
Adding footnotes to a table
Entries in tables, such as row header text, should be short, or they can present difficulties. For 
example, long headers could make it harder for our eyes to follow a row with short entries but 
wide skips. One approach to adding the necessary details while keeping the table itself short 
and crisp is using footnotes.
Instead of placing the notes at the foot of the page, it's a good idea to add the notes directly at 
the foot of the table. We also call them table notes. Some benefits of this are as follows:
f
f
Tables are usually self-contained objects for reference.
f
f
While common footnotes are written at the page bottom to retain the text flow, text 
following a table is usually independent of that table. So there's no need to defer 
notes further down.
f
f
Tables can automatically move for better page breaks; their notes should stay 
together with the corresponding table.
f
f
Table notes can be independent of text footnotes. This saves headaches about 
keeping numbering in order.
Footnotes in minipage environments already work this way, so you could wrap your table  
in a minipage environment as a first possibility. In this recipe, we will take a more 
sophisticated approach.
How to do it...
We will use the threeparttable package, which can generate footnotes below tables  
with the same width as the table body. With a normal tabular or related environment,  
which may be inside a table environment, follow these instructions:
1.	 Load the threeparttable package in your document preamble:
\usepackage{threeparttable}
2.	 Surround your original tabular environment with a threeparttable environment. 
In other words, place the \begin{threeparttable} command before the  
\begin{tabular} command, and the \end{threeparttable} command after 
the command \end{tabular}.
3.	 Within a table cell, add table notes using the command \tnote{symbol}, where 
the symbol is mandatory and can be a number, letter, or symbol chosen by you.  
For example:
… & cell text\tnote{1} & …

Chapter 6
155
4.	 Right before the end of the threeparttable environment, which means right 
before the \end{threeparttable} command, insert a tablenotes environment. 
There, insert your footnotes in the form of a list:
\begin{tablenotes}
  \item[1] Your first remark
  \item[2] Another remark
\end{tablenotes}
Let's apply this to the first recipe of this chapter:
1.	 Take the full recipe code and insert the commands as just described. For our 
example, we will add three notes. The code now becomes as follows:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{bbding}
\usepackage{threeparttable}
\begin{document}
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}

    \begin{tabular}{lccccc}

        & Appendix name\tnote{3} \\
      \cmidrule(r){1-1}\cmidrule(lr){2-2}\cmidrule(lr){3-3}
      \cmidrule(lr){4-4}\cmidrule(lr){5-5}\cmidrule(l){6-6}
      article &            &            & \Checkmark &  \\
      book    & \Checkmark & \Checkmark &            &
                \Checkmark & \Checkmark                 \\
      report  & \Checkmark & \Checkmark & \Checkmark &
                           & \Checkmark                 \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \begin{tablenotes}

Table 1: Structuring diﬀerences between standard LATEX classes
How it works...
In contrast to the classic \footnote command, we have to do some manual work in addition, 
as follows:
f
f
Choose identifiers
f
f
Take care of the order ourselves
f
f
Write the list of notes manually

Chapter 6
157
Like a tabular environment, a threeparttable environment takes an optional argument 
for vertical placement, which can be t for top, b for bottom, or c for centered alignment. 
Top alignment is the default. It also doesn't float. However, you can put it into a table 
environment as usual, with a caption and label for referencing, so it is able to float.
The behavior of threeparttable notes can be customized by options. They can be globally 
given to the \usepackage command, or locally applied to a tablenotes environment.  
These are as follows:
f
f
para: Table notes will subsequently be printed, without line breaks between them
f
f
flushleft: There will be no hanging indentation of table notes
f
f
online: Instead of superscript, table note symbols will be printed by the \item 
command in normal size at the line base
f
f
normal: This is the default formatting, which means superscript symbols, hanging 
indentation, and line breaks between table notes
Further commands for fine-tuning are provided and are described in the package manual.  
You can open it by typing the texdoc threeparttable command in Command Prompt. 
You can also access it on the Internet at http://texdoc.net/pkg/threeparttable.
Aligning numeric data
Standard alignment options in table columns are left, right, and centered. In cases of numeric 
values, this might not be sufficient. The only way to keep number magnitudes comparable is 
aligning digits at certain positions, such as at the ones, thousands, or millions places, or at 
decimal points. Integers can simply be right aligned. Numbers with decimal fractions could be 
filled up with zeroes to get decimal points aligned, but that would add vacuous noise.
In the case of fractions, it's good to directly align at the decimal points. In this recipe, we will 
implement this.
How to do it...
The siunitx package is, first of all, intended for typesetting values with units consistently. 
Incidentally, supporting its primary purpose, it provides a tabular column type for aligning  
at decimal points. We will use this now:
1.	 Load the siunitx package in your preamble:
\usepackage{siunitx}
2.	 Use S as the column specifier for a column with alignment at decimal points, such as:
\begin{tabular}{lSS}

Designing Tables
158
3.	 Within a table cell, simply write the number. Also, it's good to insert some spaces 
in the source code to get decimal points aligned for legibility. Repeating space 
characters doesn't hurt, but it's not required.
4.	 To avoid this special alignment, such as in the case of row headers, enclose the cell 
text in curly braces, like so:
… & {atomic mass} & …
Let's try it with a very short complete example. We will use the siunitx package as 
described just now, and the chemformula package in addition. The chemformula package 
makes typing chemical formulas easier. You will see more of this package in Chapter 11, 
Science and Technology. Follow these steps:
1.	 Put this code into your LaTeX editor:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{siunitx}
\usepackage{chemformula}
\begin{document}
  \begin{tabular}{lSS}
    \toprule
              & {atomic mass} & {total mass} \\
    \midrule
    \ch{C}    &    12.011     & 12.011       \\
    \ch{H}    &     1.00794   &  6.04764     \\
    \ch{C2H6} &               & 30.06964     \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{document}
2.	 Compile the example, and take a look:
atomic mass
total mass
C
12.011
12.011
H
1.007 94
6.047 64
C2H6
30.069 64

Chapter 6
159
How it works...
By default, a S column places the numbers in such a way that the decimal points are in the 
center of the cell and horizontally aligned to each other.
You can customize the alignment of numbers in a S column. Proper alignment implies 
reserving space for the numbers. You can specify the number of integers and decimal places 
and the alignment type by using the \sisetup command of the siunitx package, as 
follows:
\sisetup{table-format = 2.5,
    table-number-alignment = right}
Here, the table-format parameter will be parsed so that the siunitx package knows that 
we reserve space for two integer figures and five decimal places.
The format string can be even more sophisticated:
table-format = +2.5e+2
This additionally reserves space for an exponent with two decimals, an exponent sign, and a 
mantissa sign. This is useful for numbers such as -22.31442 x 10-10.
The package manual describes further options. It is worth reading, since the siunitx 
package is an excellent choice for when you need to print numbers with units. You can read 
the manual by typing the texdoc siunitx command in Command Prompt, or you can see it 
on the Internet at http://texdoc.net/pkg/siunitx.
You will encounter this package again in Chapter 11, Science and Technology.
There's more...
There are further packages that can be used for the same purpose, namely dcolumn and 
rccol. Both provide tabular column types for proper alignment of numbers. They are 
actually the classics, but the siunitx package is a capable, innovative, and very actively 
maintained package that even impelled LaTeX3 development, so you can safely use it for 
future work.

Designing Tables
160
Coloring a table
Sometimes we see "zebra striped" tables; tables with alternating row colors. This design is 
intended to support horizontal reading without the need for separating lines.
While some people like the design, some say it may be harder to read. For example, while 
looking at a table, the eye may scan at first one color, and then need to jump back, scanning 
the rows with the other color. So, when we decide to go for this design, we should consider 
doing the following:
f
f
Make the color variation small to prevent the tendency of the eye to jump across even 
or odd rows. The information should be visually stronger than the distinction of those 
two layers.
f
f
Keep a good contrast between color and text. For example, black text with a dark gray 
background is hardly readable.
f
f
Have a different color for the header in order to emphasize it.
How to do it...
We will use the xcolor package for this task. The sample data for this table, which we will 
use in later recipes as well, has been taken from DistroWatch.com.
Let's work on an example:
1.	 Start with a document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the xcolor package with the tables option for table support:
\usepackage[table]{xcolor}
3.	 Declare alternating row colors:
\rowcolors{2}{gray!15}{white}
4.	 Define a macro for the table header appearance:
\newcommand{\head}[1]{%
  \textcolor{white}{\textbf{#1}}}
5.	 Enlarge the default tabular line spacing:
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}

Chapter 6
161
6.	 In the actual tabular environment, use the command \rowcolor{color} to color 
any row, and the \head{text} command for cells with header commands. Here is 
the code for the table within the remaining document body:
\begin{document}
\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \sffamily
  \begin{tabular}{rlr}
    \rowcolor{black!75}
     & \head{Distribution} & \head{Hits} \\
    1 & Mint       & 2364 \\
    2 & Ubuntu     & 1838 \\
    3 & Debian     & 1582 \\
    4 & openSUSE   & 1334 \\
    5 & Fedora     & 1262 \\
    6 & Mageia     & 1219 \\
    7 & CentOS     & 1171 \\
    8 & Arch       & 1040 \\
    9 & elementary &  899 \\
   10 & Zorin      &  851 \\
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{document}
The following is the output of the preceding code:

Designing Tables
162
How it works...
The xcolor package implicitly loads the colortbl package, which is the standard package 
for coloring tables. The colortbl package provides three main commands:
f
f
The command \columncolor[color model]{color name}[left overhang]
[right overhang] with a xcolor model such as rgb or cmyk, a predefined color 
name, and color overlap to the left and to the right. Only the color name is mandatory. 
The \columncolor command is intended for placing within tabular column 
definitions by >{…}.
f
f
The \rowcolor command with the same arguments. Left and right arguments are 
practically useless. The command has to be at the beginning of the first cell in the 
row and is valid for the whole row.
f
f
The \cellcolor[color model]{color name} command for a single cell.
Using these commands, you can color tables in any way you want.
The xcolor package provides another useful command, which we used in our example:
\rowcolors[commands]{start row}{odd-row color}{even-row color}
This one colors odd and even rows with alternating colors, starting from a given row. 
Optionally, you can supply commands executed at each row. Examples of such commonly-
used commands are \hline and \noalign{…}.
In our example, we used just one \rowcolor command for the header, and one  
\rowcolors command for the remaining rows. For better readability within a head row  
with a darker color, we used white for the text color. Alternatively, with the black text color,  
you could choose a color which keeps the text readable, such as \rowcolor{gray!35}.
Both the colortbl and xcolor package manuals explain further commands and details, 
accessible via texdoc and http://texdoc.net, like you saw with other packages in the 
previous sections.
Merging cells
As indicated in the table design advice of the last recipe, instead of repeating identical 
values in adjacent cells, you could leave the other cells empty if the reader would be able to 
understand that the same values apply.
We can support the meaning by merging cells and centering the cell value over the whole  
new width.

Chapter 6
163
How to do it...
Merging and centering can be done horizontally, vertically, or both combined. We will start 
with the horizontal method, spanning cells over multiple columns. You can see this often, with 
table headers that apply to several columns. So, in this recipe, we will conflate header texts.
As modeling clay, we will take the differences between various LaTeX compilers. While LaTeX 
remains the same, the underlying TeX engine causes differences. We will arrange them now, 
using these steps:
1.	 Specify the class. You could simply use the article class for now:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the array package, which provides useful commands:
\usepackage{array}
3.	 Load the booktabs package to get nicer lines:
\usepackage{booktabs}
4.	 Load the metalogo package to write TeX logos:
\usepackage{metalogo}
5.	 Define how you would like to stretch the table row spacing:
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}
6.	 To get the table, copy the following code into your editor; an explanation follows in the 
next section. For completeness, this is the whole remaining document body:
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{1.5cm}p{1.6cm}>{\raggedleft}p{1cm}
                >{\raggedright}p{1.6cm}r@{}}

How it works...
We will take a minute to look at the tabular options:
f
f
@{code}: This inserts the given code instead of the column separation space. The 
code can be a command such as a symbol or a space macro. Here, we set it to be 
empty, thus achieving left alignment with the lines.
f
f
p{width}: This specifies cells of a certain width with wrapping text. The p character 
stands for paragraph.
f
f
>{code}: This inserts code before a cell of the column, while <{code} does it 
afterwards. This comes from the array package and is documented in the manual. 
Here, we use it to insert the \raggedleft command to avoid the default full 
justification, which isn't so nice in table cells.
f
f
r, l, and c: These stand for right aligned, left aligned, and centered, respectively.

165
Now, look at the Input cell, which spans two columns. We used the following command:
\multicolumn{number of columns}{formatting}{text}
Here, we set 2 as the number of columns to span, c for centered formatting, and finally the 
cell text follows.
Besides actually merging cells, the \multicolumn command is a simple 
way of changing the formatting of a single cell: the \multicolumn{1}
{formatting}{text} command defines the formatting of a single cell 
independently of the table global column formatting.
For this table, we used very few lines to indicate the structure, which is nevertheless well 
visible thanks to the spacing.
There's more...
As mentioned, we can also span cells over multiple rows. If there's an odd number of rows to 
span, we can simply fill the row in the middle. So, let's take a look at a case in which we need 
centering by merging.
Compile this short example showing selected classes of major LaTeX bundles:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{multirow}
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
  Bundle & Main classes \\
  \cmidrule(lr){1-1}\cmidrule(lr){2-2}
  \addlinespace
  \multirow{4}{*}{\LaTeX\ base} & article  \\
       & book     \\
       & report   \\
       & letter   \\
  \addlinespace
  \multirow{4}{*}{KOMA-Script}  & scrartcl \\
       & scrbook  \\
       & scrreprt \\
       & scrlttr2 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{document}

This code will produce the following result:
Bundle
Main classes
LATEX base
article
book
report
letter
KOMA-Script
scrartcl
scrbook
scrreprt
scrlttr2
We loaded the multirow package and used its command:
\multirow{number of rows}[struts]{width}[correction value]{text}
Here, the value of the number of rows argument may even be negative, in which case the 
spanning would reach backwards. The optional correction value argument can be a 
positive or negative LaTeX length added for fine-tuning, if given.
The other optional argument, struts, is only of interest if you inserted so called bigstruts, 
which are helping lines for stretching rows; here, you may specify their number. For details, 
refer to the multirow manual. Open it by typing the texdoc multirow command in 
Command Prompt, or at http://texdoc.net/pkg/multirow.
While you can define a width value for the text, we wrote a * symbol to use the natural  
text width.
Splitting a cell diagonally
If we need a header for the first column but also for the entries of the first row, the top-left  
cell can be split to contain both header entries, separated by a diagonal line.
How to do it...
We will use the slashbox package. It is part of MiKTeX, but not of TeX Live. Users of TeX  
Live can download it from CTAN at http://ctan.org/pkg/slashbox.

Chapter 6

In this recipe, we will build a time table. It's intended to be filled out by hand later, so we will 
use vertical lines for delimiting fields. Follow these steps:
1.	 Use any document class. Here, we simply use the article class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the slashbox package:
\usepackage{slashbox}
3.	 Within the document body, create the tabular layout:
\begin{document}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.8}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
  \hline
  \backslashbox{Time}{Weekday} & Monday   & Tuesday
                & Wednesday    & Thursday & Friday \\
  \hline
  8--10  & & & & & \\
  10--12 & & & & & \\
  12--14 & & & & & \\
  14--16 & & & & & \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{document}
4.	 Compile and take a look:

Designing Tables
168
How it works...
We used vertical lines, because the table should be read by day, that is, by column. The 
slashbox package provides two commands:
f
f
\slashbox[width][trim]{left top text}{right bottom text}
f
f
\backslashbox[width][trim]{left bottom text}{right top text}
The optional arguments are for adjustments in cases when the automatic calculation doesn't 
fit. You can specify the width of the slashed column. You can choose the trimming of the 
default left and right column separation space by stating l, r, or lr, for left trim, right trim,  
or cutting at both sides, respectively.
The diagonal line will be from the upper left to the lower right corner, like a backslash, or from 
the lower left to the upper right corner, like a slash symbol.
Adding shape, shading, and transparency
While tables in books and theses are expected to be sober, presentations at talks are often 
more colorful. In this recipe, we will take a look at how to add graphical elements, such as 
rounded borders and shaded colors, to tables.
How to do it...
We will use the beamer class, which is very popular for doing presentations. We will take an 
ordinary tabular environment, put it into a TikZ node, and add shape and color using TikZ.
It's a challenging example, but it shows what we can achieve. Follow these steps:
1.	 Choose the beamer class, remove the navigation symbols argument, and add a 
background template with some shading:
\documentclass{beamer}
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}
\setbeamertemplate{background canvas}[vertical shading]%
  [top = blue!1, bottom = blue!40]
2.	 Load the booktabs package for nicer lines:
\usepackage{booktabs}

Chapter 6
169
3.	 Load TikZ and its calc library, and add a background layer:
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{calc}
\pgfdeclarelayer{background}
\pgfsetlayers{background,main}
4.	 Define how you would like to stretch the table row spacing:
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.6}
5.	 Define some macros for symbols to use:
\newcommand{\up}{\textcolor{green}{$\blacktriangle$}}
\newcommand{\down}{\textcolor{red}{$\blacktriangledown$}}
\newcommand{\same}{\textcolor{darkgray}{\textbf{--}}}
6.	 Use another macro to print the heading, since we don't have visible sections:
\newcommand{\heading}[1]{{\Large\bfseries #1\par\medskip}}
7.	
Start a document body, a frame with centering, and the heading, and begin a TikZ 
picture:
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
  \centering
  \heading{Linux distribution ranking, December 14, 2014}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
8.	 Declare a node, choose the name table, and put the whole tabular environment 
into it:
    \node (table) {
      \begin{tabular}{rlrcc}
        & \textbf{Distribution} & \textbf{Hits} & \\
        \addlinespace[2pt]
        1 &  Mint      & 2364 & \down \\
        \midrule
        2 & Ubuntu     & 1838 & \up   \\
        \midrule
        3 & Debian     & 1582 & \same \\
        \midrule

        \midrule
        10 & Zorin     &  851 & \down \\[0.5ex]
      \end{tabular}};
9.	 Draw a colored header and body onto the background layer so it will actually be put 
below the text:
    \begin{pgfonlayer}{background}
      \draw[rounded corners, top color=blue!20,
        bottom color=blue!80!black, middle color=blue!80,
          opacity=0.5, draw=white]
          ($(table.north west)+(0.14,0)$)
        rectangle ($(table.north east)-(0.13,0.9)$);
      \draw[top color=blue!1,bottom color=blue!30,
        draw=white] ($(table.north east)-(0.13,0.6)$)
        rectangle ($(table.south west)+(0.13,0.2)$);
    \end{pgfonlayer}
10.	 End the TikZ picture, add some explanatory text, and close the frame and document:
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \small
  Data by DistroWatch.com, spanning over the last 6 months,
  hits per day.
\end{frame}
\end{document}

11.	 Compile the presentation and take a look:
How it works...
The steps are straightforward, and the drawing syntax is explained in the TikZ manual. It is too 
much to explain TikZ in depth here, so please refer to the manual at http://texdoc.net/
pkg/tikz, or by typing the texdoc tikz command in the command line.
You will see much more of TikZ in Chapter 9, Creating Graphics. For now, let's just mention 
some important points:
f
f
The beamer package is responsible for the basic background, which we shaded in 
light blue. Normally, you would choose a beamer theme with a predesigned layout.
f
f
TikZ is an extremely capable graphics package. Once we start using it, the 
possibilities are endless.
f
f
TikZ is modular. We loaded its calc library because it provides a syntax that we used 
to add coordinates, as in ($(table.north west)+(0.14,0)$).
f
f
The \midrule command is a better separation line provided by the booktabs 
package. You could change the line color by using the colortbl package:
\usepackage{colortbl}
\arrayrulecolor{blue}

Designing Tables
172
The pgf commands come from the pgf/TikZ bundle, where PGF stands for portable graphics 
format. The pgf package is the system layer below the user front-end TikZ. We used it to draw 
on a background layer:
f
f
We drew a rectangle with rounded corners on the background and a rectangle as a 
background for the table body, which actually overlaps the table, so we don't need  
to take care of the lower rounded corners.
f
f
We used a lot of colors and TikZ did the transition between top and bottom colors. 
The syntax color1!percent!color2 produces a mix of color1 (its amount  
stated in percent) and color2.
There's more...
We can automate the numbering of the table rows. Another approach would be to create a 
table graphically built with nodes. Let's have a look at these options.
Numbering table rows automatically
This automatism makes swapping rows much easier if numbers of hits, and thus ranks, 
change. Furthermore, it can prevent mistakes.
You can achieve the same resulting table as the previous one by following these steps:
f
f
Load the array package in addition for extended tabular syntax:
\usepackage{array}
f
f
Define a counter and a macro which raises it by one and prints it:
\newcounter{rank}
\setcounter{rank}{0}
\newcommand{\steprank}{\stepcounter{rank}
  \makebox[2em]{\therank}\hspace{\tabcolsep}}
f
f
The new macro will be inserted into the tabular column definition, and takes effect 
in each row. Only the first row is differently formatted, to prevent numbering of the 
header. The table itself becomes simpler now:
\begin{tabular}{@{\steprank}lrcc}
\multicolumn{1}{l}{\hspace{2em}\textbf{Distribution}} &  
\textbf{Hits} & \\
\addlinespace[2pt]
Mint & 2364 & \down \\
\midrule
Ubuntu & 1838 & \up \\
…

Chapter 6
173
Adding styles to rows and columns
You can take a very different approach. Instead of using a standard tabular environment, 
you could change to a TikZ matrix. TikZ provides a library for building and printing matrices 
with the styles and capabilities of graphics packages. The advantage is that you can natively 
apply style definitions and get all cells as nodes, which you can refer to later, for things like 
highlighting and drawing arrows.
We can show you a sample that illustrates such capabilities. The explanations here and later  
will help. For specific details, you may have a look into the TikZ or beamer manuals. Here it 
goes:
\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{matrix}
\setbeamertemplate{background canvas}[vertical shading]%
  [top=blue!1,bottom=blue!40]
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}
\newcommand{\up}{\textcolor{green!75!black}{$\blacktriangle$}}
\newcommand{\down}{\textcolor{red}{$\blacktriangledown$}}
\newcommand{\same}{\textcolor{darkgray}{\textbf{--}}}
\newcounter{rank}
\setcounter{rank}{0}
\newcommand{\steprank}{\stepcounter{rank}\therank}
\newenvironment{matrixtable}[4]{%
  \begin{tikzpicture}
  \matrix (m) [matrix of nodes, nodes in empty cells,
    nodes={draw, top color=blue!10, bottom color=blue!35,
      inner sep=2pt, minimum height=3.5ex, anchor=center},
    top color=blue!20, bottom color=blue!80, draw=white,
    column sep=1ex, row sep=0.6ex, inner sep=2ex,
    rounded corners,
    row 1/.style    = {font=\bfseries},
    column 1/.style = {minimum width=#1, font=\steprank},
    column 2/.style = {minimum width=#2},
    column 3/.style = {minimum width=#3},
    column 4/.style = {minimum width=#4}]}%

175
For convenience, we made an environment for the table with settings, so we don't need 
to repeat the style settings for every single table. Instead, we can have a consistent style 
throughout the document. Some width parameters give us further flexibility.
The lengthy but elaborate TikZ syntax is pretty self-explanatory for styling such as color, 
separations, width, and height, at least for reading. To extend it, reading the section about the 
matrix library in the manual is recommended, and in consequence, reading about nodes 
and styles there as well.
Like previously in this recipe, we let LaTeX count and print the rank number. We used a small 
trick: putting our \steprank command, which increments and displays the rank, into the font 
style for the first column. This hook was originally intended for applying a color to each cell of 
the first column; we were so daring to use it for calculating and printing.
We can easily modify single cells using TikZ syntax. Each cell is a node, and if we place 
something between bars before the cell content, it will be applied to that node. For example, 
writing the |[red]|Fedora argument in this matrixtable environment gives us Fedora 
written in red.
Each cell of our matrix is a node object and can be addressed using the syntax (m-row-
column). So, if we want to add the option [remember picture] to the tikzpicture 
argument in our matrixtable environment definition, we can use those node names. For 
example, we can draw an arrow from Mint to Debian by placing this code after the table, still 
in the same frame:
\begin{tikzpicture}[remember picture,overlay]
  \draw [->] (m-2-2) -- (m-4-2);
\end{tikzpicture}
That's just a glimpse of what we can do once we dress the table in TikZ.

Importing data from files
It can be very handy to get the data for the row entries from an external file. Actually, this can 
be done in a few lines.
How to do it...
We will load the datatool package, let it import data from a comma separated data file, sort 
it, and print it:
1.	 Store your data in the same folder as your main tex document. Here, we will use the 
data from the last recipes, unsorted within a text file:
Distribution,Hits
Zorin,85
Debian,1582
CentOS,1171
elementary,899
Arch,1040
Mint,2364
openSUSE,1334
Ubuntu,1838
Mageia,1219
Fedora,1262
2.	 Start with a document class, such as article, and load the booktabs package for 
improved tabular layout, and the datatool package for data handling:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{booktabs}
\usepackage{datatool}
3.	 With these datatool commands, load the data from the file and sort it:
\DTLloaddb{Linux}{linux.csv}
\DTLsort{Hits=descending}{Linux}
4.	 Start the document and set up a tabular environment:
\begin{document}
\begin{tabular}{rlr}
  & Distribution & Hits \\
  \cmidrule(lr){2-2}\cmidrule(lr){3-3}

Chapter 6
177
5.	 Use this command to iterate through the data, building tabular rows:
  \DTLforeach{Linux}{%
    \distribution=Distribution, \hits=Hits}{%
      \theDTLrowi & \distribution & \hits \\}
6.	 End the tabular environment and the document:
\end{tabular}

How it works...
The datatool package is actually a very capable bundle of packages for working with 
external data. Here, we simply imported a file, sorted it by a chosen key, and printed it.
Let us review the steps:
f
f
We loaded the datatool package using the \usepackage command.
f
f
We loaded the file linux.csv into a database with the name Linux. The command 
syntax is as follows:
\DTLloaddb[options]{database name}{file name}
Here, options may contain the following:


omitlines=n: This specifies an integer number n of lines to skip at the 
start.


noheader=true or noheader=false: This indicates whether or not the 
file contains a header. The default behavior is to assume a header. If you 
specify noheader without a value, true is assumed.

Designing Tables
178


keys={key1,key2, …}: This specifies the keys for the database; it would 
override an existing header.


header={header1,header2, …}: This specifies the headers for the 
database and would override a header in the file. These entries would 
be used, for example, in easy printing with \DTLdisplaydb{database 
name}.
By default, it's assumed that data is separated by commas. You can change it with 
the \DTLsetseparator{character} command to any character, or by calling 
the \DTLsettabseparator command without argument to choose the tab as 
separator.
f
f
We sorted the database with this command:
\DTLsort[replacement keys]{sort criteria}{database name}
Here, the sort criteria argument is a list of keys with optional order, which can 
be set to descending or ascending. The latter is the default if you just list keys. 
The optional list in the replacement keys argument is used, in the given order, if 
the current key is empty.
f
f
While we could simply print all with the \DTLdisplaydb{database name} 
command, or the \DTLdisplaylongdb{database name} command using the 
longtable package, we iterated through the database for maximum flexibility:
\DTLforeach[condition]{database name}{assign list}{text}
The result of this macro is text for each row, which can include commands, but with 
replacements done with assign list in the form of a command=key list, as in our 
recipe. We did not use the optional condition argument, which can be a Boolean 
value calculated by the \ifthenelse command and related commands. This value, 
by default true, decides whether or not to apply text for the current row.
If this short sample convinced you of this method, you will find that the manual has extensive 
information and is worth reading. You can do a lot more. Similar to most packages, you can 
open the datatool manual by typing texdoc datatool in Command Prompt, or you can 
read it on the Internet at http://texdoc.net/pkg/datatool.

Generating an index
Introduction
LaTeX provides features for the automatic creation of tables of contents, lists of figures, 
tables, bibliographies, glossaries, and indexes. This chapter contains recipes for quickly 
starting and customizing such lists.
We will start with the table of contents. While it's extremely easy to create a table of contents 
by simply using the \tableofcontents command, the format is quite rigidly determined  
by the document class. We will look at ways of modifying it with ease. The same can be  
used for the lists of figures and the lists of tables, which can be generated using the 
commands \listoffigures or \listoftables, respectively.
For a scientific work, especially, a list of references is important. It's also called a bibliography. 
One of the recipes in this chapter will provide a quick start using the very modern biblatex 
package.

Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies
180
Another recipe will show you how to create a glossary, so you can explain scientific or technical 
vocabulary to the reader.
The final recipe demonstrates generating a sorted index, which will let your reader look up key 
words easily.
Tuning a table of contents, lists of figures, 
and tables
When we start using LaTeX, the automatic creation of a table of contents (ToC) is impressive. 
The ToC with sectioning titles and page numbers is generated from your heading texts in 
commands such as \part, \chapter, and \section. The lists of figures and tables work in 
exactly the same way while they use the texts in the \caption command for the list entries. 
The design of the default table of contents follows a very common style. In some cases, 
though, you might need to adjust it.
How to do it...
We will use the tocstyle package to customize the table of contents. It belongs to the 
KOMA-Script bundle. You can try the settings of the recipe in your own document, or use the 
example from Chapter 1, The Variety of Document Types.
Automatic correction of widths
The default widths of numbers of sectioning numbers and page numbers in the ToC are static. 
This can lead to problems with large sectioning numbers, as well as with large page numbers. 
It's even more relevant for Roman numbering, where the width of numbers is even wider. In 
such cases, numbers and textual entries of the ToC may overlap.
You can fix this easily by using the following command:
\usepackage[tocindentauto]{tocstyle}
The name of this option, tocindentauto, may not look very intuitive. However, it means that 
the textual entries are automatically indented in such a way that they don't overlap with the 
numbers.
Note that producing a ToC now needs three runs, we will explain the reason 
later in this recipe.

Chapter 7
181
Printing a flat table of contents
By default, a ToC is graduated. This means that sectioning entries of lower level headings 
will be indented. Our book example from Chapter 1, The Variety of Document Types, has a 
graduated table of contents:
To have all contents aligned to the left, specifically the sectioning numbers, call the following 
command:
\usepackage[tocflat]{tocstyle}
The ToC will now change to the following:

Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies
182
However, the entries will be aligned, which means that the sectioning numbers will be set 
in a box of equal width. You can omit this, pushing all the contents to the left, by using the 
following:
\usepackage[tocfullflat]{tocstyle}
Now you get the following:
The effects of the changes would be even more noticeable if subsections were added to the 
ToC.
You can combine options by writing them separated by commas, as 
follows: \usepackage[tocindentauto,tocflat]{tocstyle}.
Getting KOMA-Script like-sans-serif headings
KOMA-Script classes use a modern design of headings that are sans-serif and bold, and not 
as heavy as the default classic serif headings. Also, bold ToC entries are sans-serif, as you can 
see it the preceding output.
You can get the same behavior with other classes by using the following command:
\usepackage{tocstyle}
\usetocstyle{KOMAlike}

Chapter 7
183
How it works...
To benefit from the automatic adjustments of tocstyle, you need several compiler runs.  
Expect at least three runs. In the first run, LaTeX writes all entries from commands, such  
as \chapter and \section, to the external table of contents file. The name of this file 
ends with .toc. For the list of figures and tables, the filenames end with .lof and .lot, 
respectively. In the following run, LaTeX can read the entries of the external file for printing the 
ToC. Widths are calculated and written to the .aux file. In the next run, the ToC is produced 
using the known entries from the .toc file and the known widths from the .aux file. Of 
course, changes in sectioning and page numbers would require a further run. This is a general 
consequence of straight compiling using external files: several compiler runs can be required 
until things are completely settled.
There's more...
If you load the tocstyle package without options, it produces a graduated ToC, just like the 
standard classes. However, it tries hard to avoid page breaks between ToC entries and their 
parents, and it automatically adjusts the widths. So, simply loading it can be a relief.
The package actually provides many commands for fine-tuning the style of the ToC, which is 
otherwise quite challenging. Refer to the package manual for details, which you can open by 
typing the texdoc tocstyle command in the Command Prompt, or by going to http://
texdoc.net/pkg/tocstyle.
Creating a bibliography
The classic way of producing a bibliography, that is, a list of references, is using BibTeX. This 
is an external program for producing a bibliography from a plain text database with a chosen 
style, and for citing references in text.
In LaTeX Beginner's Guide, Packt Publishing, there's a tutorial for creating bibliographies 
using BibTeX. Refer to this guide to learn about the classic way. In our cookbook, we will use 
an advanced package called biblatex, which is generally considered to be the successor 
of BibTeX. It is a complete reimplementation of LaTeX's standard bibliographic features. 
It supports the BibTeX database format, but understands other formats. The biblatex 
package entirely uses TeX macros for formatting. BibTeX styles, by contrast, are programmed 
in a postfix stack language. So, for customizing styles with the biblatex package, you don't 
need to learn another language. It supports subdivided bibliographies. You can generate 
multiple bibliographies within one document. You can have separate lists of bibliographic 
shorthands. The biblatex package can still use BibTeX as backend, but works with a new 
and capable backend called biber.

Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies

It is highly recommended that you use the biber backend with the biblatex package for 
the following reasons:
f
f
It is capable of processing UTF-8 input, including accented characters and Unicode 
symbols. BibTeX, by contrast, requires 7-bit ASCII text.
f
f
You can customize the sorting, such as by deciding whether or not to take 
capitalization into account and by following sorting guidelines of various languages. It 
can automatically use your operating system locale.
f
f
Names can be used more flexibly; for example, to cite names with prefixes correctly.
f
f
Multiple bibliographies in the same document, for example, in the same chapter, can 
be produced in one run, while BibTeX needs one run for each chapter.
f
f
The biber backend can even sort each bibliography in the document independently 
and differently.
f
f
It doesn't have memory limitations, which can be a problem with BibTeX.
How to do it...
We will start with a small example, which is the same as the one in LaTeX Beginner's Guide, 
so you can compare the new biblatex package approach to the classic BibTeX way, if 
desired.
Follow the following steps:
1.	 With any text editor or the LaTeX editor, open a new document and add these 
bibliography entries:
@book{DK86,
  author = "D.E. Knuth",
  title = "The {\TeX}book",
  publisher = "Addison Wesley",
  year = 1986
}
@article{DK89,
  author = "D.E. Knuth",
  title = "Typesetting Concrete Mathematics",
  journal = "TUGboat",
  volume = 10,
  number = 1,
  pages = "31--36",
  month = apr,
  year = 1989
}
@book{Lamport,
  author = "Leslie Lamport",
  title = "\LaTeX: A Document Preparation System",

Chapter 7
185
  publisher = "Addison Wesley",
  year = 1986
}
2.	 Save that document and choose any filename. Here, we give the name texbooks.
bib.
3.	 Now, we start the LaTeX document. Begin with a document class:
\documentclass{scrartcl}
4.	 Load the biblatex package:
\usepackage{biblatex}
5.	 Add the bibliography file with the full filename, including the extension:
\addbibresource{texbooks.bib}
6.	 Start your LaTeX document body. For citing references, use the \autocite 
command:
\begin{document}
\section*{Recommended texts}
To study \TeX\ in depth, see \autocite{DK86}. For
writing math texts, see \autocite{DK89}. The
basic reference for \LaTeX\ is \autocite{Lamport}.
7.	
Insert the following command where you would like to print the bibliography:
\printbibliography
8.	 Finish your document:
\end{document}
9.	 Compile the document and take a look at it:
10.	 There's still no bibliography. For the cited references, we see just the keys of the 
bibliography entries, DK89 and Lamport.
11.	 Run the biber backend on the document. Either click on the corresponding editor 
button, if your editor provides one, or run it at the Command Prompt. Use the 
document name as argument, but without the .tex extension:
biber filename

Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies
186
12.	Compile the document again, and take another look at it:
How it works...
The biblatex package and the biber backend support the classic bibliography file format 
known from BibTeX. It's described in LaTeX Beginner's Guide, but also in the BibTeX reference 
manual and in the biblatex package manual. Refer to the latter for complete information.
First, we need to load the package. There are a lot of options to customize, which you can 
specify when loading the packages via use package. Some of the most useful options are as 
follows:
f
f
backend: This can be the biber backend (the default option), bibtex, bibtex8 
(the 8-bit version), or bibtexu (the unsupported unicode version)
f
f
style: This is the name of the style for the bibliography and citations
f
f
bibstyle: This is the name of the bibliography style
f
f
citestyle: This is the name of the citation style
f
f
natbib: This loads commands for citation commands of natbib, which is a popular 
package for author-year citations with BibTeX
You can call the biblatex package in the preceding example this way:
\usepackage[
  backend = biber,
  style   = authoryear,
  natbib  = true
]{biblatex}

Chapter 7
187
You will now get author-year notations, both in citations and in the bibliography, as shown here:
The command \addbibresource loads your bibliography. It provides several options, given 
in the key=value notation. The most noticeable options are the following:
f
f
label: This is the name that you can use instead of the full resource name in a 
reference section in cases of multiple bibliographies
f
f
location: This can be local for a local file (default), or remote for an Internet 
address, which can be a website or a FTP server, for example
f
f
datatype: This is the format of the resource, which can be any of the following:


bibtex: This is the classic BibTeX format (default)


ris: This is the Research Information Systems format


zoterordfxml: This is the Zotero RDF/XML format


endnotexml: This is the EndNote XML format
You can load several files, even directly from the Internet; for example:
\addbibresource{maths.bib}
\addbibresource{history.bib}
\addbibresource[location=remote,
  label=tex]{http://latex-community.org/texbooks.bib}
The command \printbibliography then prints the sorted and styled bibliography. It 
understands some optional parameters for customizing it, which are described in the manual.
The \addbibresource command replaces the older BibTeX command  
\bibliography. The latter takes just the file name and is not as flexible.

Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies
188
There's more...
While this recipe gives you a quick start, browsing the comprehensive manual is 
recommended for customization. You can open it, as usual, by typing the texdoc biblatex 
command into the command line, or by visiting http://texdoc.net/pkg/biblatex. In 
the same way, you can access the biber manual.
The biblatex manual lists a lot of other predefined styles, such as variations of numeric, 
alphabetic, and author-year styles.
On the CTAN website (http://ctan.org/topic/biblatex), there are a lot of additional 
biblatex styles to download. Check whether or not one already matches your requirements, 
otherwise, the manual can guide you in making the final adjustment. Luckily, you can use 
LaTeX for it instead of the BibTeX postfix language.
Both the biblatex package and the biber backend were heavily 
developed in sync. Ensure that your versions are compatible with each 
other. The biber manual provides a compatibility matrix in its introduction 
section.
Adding a glossary
If words in your document require some explanation, you can add a glossary. This is an 
alphabetical list of words or phrases with their explanations. A possible improvement would be 
having backreferences to the locations in the text where those words are used.
How to do it...
We will work with the glossaries package by following these steps:
1.	 Start with any document class. For our example, we will use the scrartcl class, 
because we don't start with a paragraph indentation with the parskip option. 
However, you can use the article class without options as well:
\documentclass[parskip=half]{scrartcl}
2.	 Load the glossaries package and choose the style called long3col:
\usepackage[style=long3col]{glossaries}
3.	 Use this command to tell the package to create a glossary:
\makenoidxglossaries

Chapter 7
189
4.	 Create the first glossary entry for the word TeX. Using a key=value interface, state 
the name, a word indicating the sort order because the name is actually a macro. 
Finally, write a description. All of these should be in curly braces:
\newglossaryentry{tex}{
  name = {\TeX},
  sort = {TEX},
  description = {Sophisticated digital typesetting system,
                 famous for high typographic quality of
                 mathematical formulae}
}
5.	 Repeat this for each glossary entry. We will do this for LaTeX and TikZ:
\newglossaryentry{latex}{
  name ={\LaTeX},
  sort = {LATEX},
  description = {Document markup language based on
                 \gls{tex}, widely used in academia}
}
\newglossaryentry{tikz}{
  name = {Ti\emph{k}Z},
  sort = {TikZ},
  description = {Extremely capable graphics
                 language for drawing with \gls{tex}}
}
6.	 Open the document:
\begin{document}
7.	
Write some text. When you use the words which are part of the glossary, use the 
command \gls{label}:
\gls{tikz} works with plain \gls{tex}. However,
it is mostly used with \gls{latex}.
8.	 Use the following command to print the glossary:
  \printnoidxglossary
9.	 End the document:
\end{document}

Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies
190
10.	 Compile the document twice and take a look at it:
How it works...
The basic procedure for producing a glossary is as follows:
f
f
Define your terms or abbreviations. This can also be done in a separate file which you 
can load via the \input command.
f
f
Reference those entries by using the \gls command, like you would do with the \
ref command for a label.
f
f
Finally, display the glossary list.
The glossaries package is very capable. It even provides a lot of predefined layouts, called 
styles. We chose long3col for a longtable layout with three columns. There are other 
longtable and supertabular styles and several list layouts similar to the standard LaTeX 
description list.
There's a package with a similar name called glossary. This is an older 
version by the same author, which is now obsolete; so, glossaries should 
be used instead.
All the features of the glossaries package are explained in the user guide, which you can 
access by typing the texdoc glossaries command into the command line, or by opening 
it online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/glossaries. If you feel a bit overwhelmed by the 
amount of reference information, you can read the beginner's guide instead, for a quick start. 
It can be opened by typing the texdoc glossariesbegin command into the command 
line, or by visiting http://texdoc.net/pkg/glossariesbegin.

Chapter 7
191
Creating a list of acronyms
For documents with a lot of acronyms or abbreviations, it is common to have a table showing 
their short forms and full forms. This allows compact writing and adds convenience for the 
reader.
This is different from a glossary as we don't list explanations, just the full forms.
How to do it...
We will again use the glossaries package. Since the concept of a glossary and a list of 
acronyms are closely related, it provides an acronym mode too, so we will now use the list that 
way by performing the following steps:
1.	 Begin with a document class. It doesn't matter which one. Here, we will take the 
same class that we took in the previous recipe:
\documentclass[parskip=half]{scrartcl}
2.	 Load the glossaries package and choose the style called long3col as we did in 
the previous recipe. For acronym support, add the acronym option:
\usepackage[acronym,style=long3col]{glossaries}
3.	 Choose an acronym style. We take long-sc-short here, where sc stands for small 
caps in the short form:
\usepackage[acronym,style=long3col]{glossaries}
4.	 Define a new acronym using the command \newacronym and three arguments: 
a label, the short form, and the long form. Since we use lowercase anyway, it's 
recommended that you write the short form in lowercase:
\newacronym{ctan}{ctan}{Comprehensive
  \TeX\ Archive Network}
5.	 Define other acronyms as needed in the same way:
\newacronym{tug}{tug}{\TeX\ Users Group}
\newacronym{dante}{dante}{Deutschsprachige
  Anwendervereinigung \TeX}
6.	 Use this command to tell the package to create defined glossaries; this also applies 
to lists of acronyms:
\makenoidxglossaries
7.	
Start the document:
\begin{document}

Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies
192
8.	 Write some text. As with the glossary in the previous recipe, for acronyms, use the 
command \gls{label}:
The \gls{ctan} has been founded by members of the
\gls{tug} and of the German speaking group ``\gls{dante}''.
The \gls{ctan} project is actually independent of
\gls{tug} and \gls{dante}, but \gls{dante} is still
the main supporter.
9.	 Use this command to print the list of acronyms:
  \printnoidxglossary[type=\acronymtype]
10.	 End the document:
\end{document}
11.	 Compile the document twice and take a look at it:
How it works...
The preceding commands works exactly like the previous recipe about glossaries. The only 
substantial addition is the following command:
\newacronym{label}{short version}{long version}
This command defines each acronym.

Chapter 7
193
Producing an index
Longer documents, such as technical books, often contain an index. This is usually placed at 
the end of the document. It contains a list of words and the page numbers at which a reader 
can find them in the document. Such a list may contain key words, topics, or person's names.
How to do it...
Indexing may be done at the very end. Reading through the document, a command  
\index{keyword} should be placed for each place relevant to that key word. A good place 
can be right before the occurrence of that key word in the text. Don't leave a space between 
the \index{...} command and the indexed word.
We will use the makeidx package. We will now insert the indexing commands while writing  
by following these steps:
1.	 Start with a document class. We will use the same class that we used in the previous 
recipes:
\documentclass[parskip=half]{scrartcl}
2.	 Load the makeidx package:
\usepackage{makeidx}
3.	 Use the this command to generate the index:
\makeindex
4.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
5.	 Write the text, and insert the \index commands right before key words:
While \index{glossary}glossary entries are simply
printed in the text, an \index{acronyms}acronym
is firstly fully printed with the short version
in parentheses, later only in the short version.
6.	 Use this command to print the index:
\printindex
7.	
End the document:
\end{document}
8.	 Compile the document for first time.

Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies
194
9.	 Run the makeindex command in your editor or execute the command makeindex 
filename at the command line.
10.	 Compile again with LaTeX, and take a look at the document:
How it works...
All your \index commands generate entries with the key word and page number in an 
auxiliary file. This is processed by the external program makeindex. In the second run, its 
output is read in and printed.
The latexmk tools can automate this process. So, you just need a single 
call of latexmk, which calls LaTeX for you, and even the biber backend or 
bibtex, and makeindex, if required. These command runs often enough 
to resolve cross references. You can read about this by typing the texdoc 
latexmk command in the command line, or by visiting http://texdoc.
net/pkg/latexmk.
There's more...
Indexing is rather a final task. If you would like to add index entries on the fly, you can create 
macros to help with it. A popular application, for example, is defining a key word macro that 
prints a word in a certain style and adds an index entry at the same time.

Chapter 7
195
Index entries can have subentries. They are added behind the main entry separated by an 
exclamation mark, as follows:
\index{main topic:sub topic}
We can put the tasks of formatting and creating subentries into a sample macro for packages, 
which does the following:
f
f
It creates a subentry for the package topic
f
f
It creates a subentry for a given topic
f
f
It prints it with some formatting
This can be illustrated by the following commands:
\newcommand{\package}[2]{\index{packages!\texttt{#2}}%
  \index{#1!package \texttt{#2}}\texttt{#2}}
Let's now extend our text, so we get more index entries to play with even though it may look a 
bit overdone:
While \index{glossary}glossary \index{glossary!entry}entries are
simply printed in the text, an \index{acronym}acronym is firstly
fully printed with the \index{acronym!short version}short version
in \index{parentheses}parentheses, later only in the short
version.
A glossary can be done using one of the packages
\package{glossary}{glossaries} or \package{glossary}{nomencl}.
For a list of acronyms, suitable are \package{acronyms}{acronym},
\package{acronyms}{acro} and also \package{acronyms}{glossaries}.

Contents, Indexes, and Bibliographies
196
Compile twice; the output now changes to the following:
You can see subentries and typewriter formatting for package names.

Introduction
Originally, LaTeX produced output in the Device independent file (DVI) format. This is still 
supported, however, today there exist newer page description languages, such as PostScript 
(PS) and the most popular Portable Document Format (PDF).
There are converters from DVI to PS, from PS to PDF, and also directly from DVI to PDF. A 
modern TeX compiler called pdfTeX can directly generate PDF output. This, combined with  
the LaTeX format is called pdfLaTeX, and it is pretty much the standard today.

198
Adding hyperlinks
At first, LaTeX was used to produce high-quality prints on paper. Since the output was 
device independent from the beginning, the results can be viewed on screens, tablets, and 
smartphones as well.
With electronic publishing, we get access to very handy features. Most importantly, hyperlinks, 
which allow us to easily navigate within a document. In this recipe, we will deal with providing 
hyperlinks in the PDF.
How to do it...
We will use the hyperref package for providing hyperlinks in the PDF. It provides a user-
friendly interface to access PDF features, such as hyperlinks. You can test it with our examples 
from Chapter 1, The Variety of Document Types, by performing the following steps:
1.	 Open the book example from the first chapter in your editor.
2.	 At the end of the preamble, add this line for loading the hyperref package:
\usepackage{hyperref}
3.	 Compile at least twice so that LaTeX can process the data in the .aux file written by 
the hyperref package.
4.	 Take a PDF viewer, such as the Adobe Reader, and take a look at the table of 
contents:

Chapter 8
199
You can spot hyperlinks by the red borders around the entries. Each 
contents entry is a hyperlink now. Click on an entry to move to the 
corresponding chapter or section in the document body.
5.	 On the left, you can see bookmarks for additional navigation.
The hyperref package does a lot more for us. Let's sum up the most important changes:
f
f
All entries in the table of contents, list of figures and tables, and similarly generated 
hyperlinks, point to the corresponding place of the object in the body text.
f
f
Footnote markers point to the footnotes. That's the same for endnotes, taking away 
the pain of scrolling down to the end.
f
f
Citations are hyperlinked to their entry in the bibliography.
f
f
References done using ref keyword will become hyperlinks pointing to the location 
where the label was set. This applies, for example, to figure and table captions, 
headings, and equations.
How it works...
Though enabling was very easy for us, the hyperref package does a lot internally. It 
redefines many commands of classes and packages for adding hyperlink functionality.
As a rule of thumb, load the hyperref package after all other packages to 
let it override their features. There are exceptions, such as the cleveref, 
amsrefs, and packages built on top of the hyperref package, such 
as bookmark, hypcap, and hypernat. You can find a complete list of 
dependencies at http://texblog.net/hyperref.
Like most packages, the hyperref package can be controlled using options such as  
\usepackage[linkcolor = {blue}]{hyperref}. It provides a key=value interface. 
However, its specialty is that you can set such options after loading the package, by using the 
following command:
\hypersetup{key1 = value1,
            Key2 = value2,
            ...
}
In both cases, some keys can be set without a value, which will then default to true.

The \hypersetup command is preferable for the following reasons:
f
f
LaTeX expands values in the package options early, which can be undesirable.
f
f
LaTeX strips the spaces from options.
f
f
Some options, such as metadata, are better set after loading the package.
f
f
While curly braces can protect the values in options, you may omit them in the  
\hypersetup command.
f
f
If a document class already loads the hyperref package, like the beamer  
package does, or another package, you should not load it again by using the  
\usepackage{hyperref} command. However, you can still use the  
\hypersetup command.
In the next recipe, Adding metadata, we will make a comparison between \hypersetup and 
using options in \usepackage. Besides this, we will systematically use the \hypersetup 
command. The following pages will be full of examples.
There's more...
In addition to the automatic behavior, the hyperref package provides the user with 
commands for explicitly setting anchors and links. We can customize the link appearance. 
Over time, the hyperref package has become a fully fledged PDF interface. We will also 
explore some of its PDF specific features.
Inserting custom hyperlinks
You can create your own anchors, give them a name, and link to those anchors. Also, you can 
link them to Internet addresses.
Linking to a place within the document
Take a look at this short example:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}
See \hyperlink{mytarget}{next page}.
\newpage
\hypertarget{mytarget}{Here} starts a new page.
\end{document}

Chapter 8
201
It works this way:
f
f
We chose the internal link name mytarget, which is added to a printed piece of text
f
f
We linked this anchor to the printing text with the hyperlink
As you can see, we link to the target even before it has been set. That's why we need two 
compiler runs as LaTeX doesn't know the target in the first run before it is defined.
Linking to labeled objects
A single command is sufficient where we have already defined a label, as we you see here:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:einstein}
  E = mc^2 
\end{equation}
Now, we can simply write the following:
Refer to the \hyperref[eq:einstein]{mass-energy equivalence}.
We got a hyperlink with text, instead of a number as we would have with the \ref command.
We used square brackets for the label argument.
A common way to categorize labels is by using prefixes, such as eq: 
for equations and fig: for figures. It helps with keeping the code 
organized, but it is not necessary.
Linking to the Internet
Let's take a quick look at some further commands. We will use samples of real-world 
addresses instead of placing holders, so that you can for immediately understand the usage:
f
f
The \href{http://latex-community.org}{LaTeX Community Forum} 
command prints text with a hyperlink to an address
f
f
The \url{http://texample.net} command prints the formatted address with 
hyperlink
f
f
The \nolinkurl{http://texdoc.net} command prints the formatted address 
without link
In the preceding explanation, we used the \hyperref command for pointing to a label, using 
square brackets. There's a more complex syntax with curly braces for Internet addresses:
The \hyperref{address}{category}{name}{text} command prints the text and links 
it to the address#category.name parameter.

Getting the Most out of the PDF
202
Let's see a sample of this command:
\newcommand{\baseaddress}{http://latex-community.org/}
\newcommand{\articleaddress}{\baseaddress
  know-how/latexs-friends/61/486/}
\hyperref{\articleaddress}{running}{lualatex}
  {Running MetaPost within LuaLaTeX}
The generated hyperlink points to http://latex-community.org/know-how/latexs-
friends/61/486/#running.lualatex.
Generally, to avoid confusing the arguments, here is a mnemonic:
f
f
The first argument is the name or label of a target, which is invisible, 
and the last argument, if needed, is the text which is displayed
Changing the color and shape of the hyperlinks
The default highlighting by red borders can seem a bit obtrusive. You can simply remove them 
by adding the hidelinks option:
\hypersetup{hidelinks}
Users may know what a reference is, thus is clickable. Furthermore, we can see the mouse 
pointer changing when we hover over a link.
However, you can choose to color the text of hyperlinks instead of applying the default frames:
\usepackage{xcolor}
\hypersetup{
  colorlinks,
  linkcolor = {red!75!black},
  citecolor = {green!40!black},
  urlcolor  = {blue!40!black}
}
Here, we loaded the xcolor package to use its color mixing syntax. We get a color for 
document internal links with 75 percent red plus 25 percent black. Then, we set color for 
citations, and then for external links to the Internet.

Chapter 8
203
Blackening the hyperlinks, and so getting darker colors, may be less obtrusive and look better 
in print. Colored links are actually printed, in contrast to the default borders, so you may still 
decide to use the hidelinks package for printing. Hyperlinks on classic paper don't need 
emphasizing.
To get a consistent link color for all kinds of links, you can set the allcolors parameter for 
coloring the hyperlinks instead.
Getting backreferences in the bibliography
To get a backlink for each bibliography item in order to know where it has been cited, you can 
set the backref option:
\hypersetup{backref}
The section number will be printed and linked at the end of each bibliography item. Valid 
optional values for the backref key are section, slide, page, none, and false.
If you would like to have backlink page numbers at the end of bibliography items, use this:
\hypersetup{pagebackref}
Hyperlinking index entries
Since an index is for looking things up, hyperlinks to the corresponding places in the text are 
quite natural. It is not enabled by default. However, you can switch it on by using the following:
\hypersetup{hyperindex}
Adding metadata
The PDF standard contains a field for hidden descriptive data, such as the name of the author 
and the title of a document. This is useful for archiving purposes. Internet search engines also 
inspect metadata information. In this recipe, we will edit it.
How to do it...
We will use the interface of the hyperref package. Let's again use our examples from 
Chapter 1, The Variety of Document Types. Let's take a look at the following steps:
1.	 Open the book example from Chapter 1, The Variety of Document Types, in your 
editor.
2.	 At the end of the preamble, load the hyperref package:
\usepackage{hyperref}

204
3.	 Set up the metadata information. Here, we use some dummy text:
\hypersetup{pdfauthor   = The Author,
            pdftitle    = The Book,
            pdfsubject  = Draft version,
            pdfkeywords = {book, draft},
            pdfproducer = TeX version,
            pdfcreator  = LaTeX editor}
4.	 Compile your document.
5.	 Take a PDF viewer, such as the Adobe Reader, and inspect the document properties. 
You can find this meta information here. It will look like this:
In a metadata field, the Adobe Reader adds quotes whether it contains 
separators such as commas or quotes.

Chapter 8
205
How it works...
Some metadata is usually set automatically, such as the pdfTeX compiler version, which 
produces a PDF. You can overwrite it and set your own data using the \hypersetup 
interface.
As commas separate options, we need to protect values by enclosing them in curly braces if 
they contain commas, such as the keywords in our example.
There's more...
In the first recipe, we explained why the \hypersetup command is preferable to options to 
the \usepackage package. Let's take a look at how it looks in the latter case, especially for 
preserving the spaces in values:
\usepackage[pdfauthor   = {The\ Author},
            pdftitle    = {The\ Book},
            pdfsubject  = {Draft\ version},
            pdfkeywords = {{book, draft}},
            pdfproducer = {TeX\ version},
            pdfcreator  = {LaTeX\ editor}]{hyperref}
We should group by braces to be on the safe side with option parsing. The space with a 
preceding backslash is a forced space, otherwise the space would get lost. It looks a bit more 
complicated, especially if you set a lot of other options.
There's an alternative interface for setting metadata that lets you even set your own keys. This 
is the pdfinfo option, which works this way:
\hypersetup{pdfinfo = {
              Author   = The Author,
              Title    = The Book,
              Subject  = Draft version,
              Keywords = {book, draft},
              Producer = TeX version,
              Creator  = LaTeX editor,
              Version  = 2.0,
              Comment  = Contains dummy text}}
We set the known data and add our own keys.

Getting the Most out of the PDF
206
For completeness, we can even declare metadata without the hyperref package by using a 
pdfTeX command if this compiler is used:
\pdfinfo{
  /Author (The Author)
  /Title (The Book)
  /Subject (Draft version)
  /Keywords (book, draft)
  /Producer (pdfTeX 1.40.0)
  /Creator (LaTeX editor)}
This is obviously an unusual syntax, which calls for using the hyperref package.
Adding copyright information
In the previous recipe, we added author, producer, and creator information. We can even 
add a field for our own copyright information. However, there's a specific place for copyright 
information. Even after adding metadata like we did earlier, the Adobe Acrobat and other PDF 
viewers may still display "Copyright Status: Unknown." and an empty copyright notice. We can 
change this.
How to do it...
The hyperxmp package can embed the required information. Follow these steps to add 
copyright information:
1.	 Open the book example from the first chapter in your editor.
2.	 At the end of the preamble, load the hyperref package:
\usepackage{hyperref}
3.	 In the next line, load the hyperxmp package:
\usepackage{hyperxmp}
4.	 Set up the copyright information:
\hypersetup{
  pdfcopyright = {Copyright (C) 2012 by author name.
    All rights reserved.},
  pdflicenseurl = {http://latex-community.org/license/}}

Chapter 8
207
5.	 Compile your document.
6.	 Take a PDF viewer and inspect the document properties. For example, with the 
PDF-XChange viewer, click on File | Document Properties, and then click on the 
Additional Metadata button. You will see the following:
How it works...
Adobe Systems, Inc. supports eXtensible Metadata Platform (XMP) for embedding 
metadata. This method takes eXtensible Markup Language (XML) formatted attributes for 
embedding within the document.
The hyperxmp package processes the hyperref package keys and adds further keys, such 
as those we used earlier in the chapters. So, we don't even need to deal with XML.
Refer to the hyperxmp manual for a complete description of all options, including contact 
data. As usual, you can open it by typing the texdoc hyperxmp command in Command 
Prompt, or by visiting http://texdoc.net/pkg/hyperxmp.
There's more...
The xmpincl package is more flexible than the hyperxmp package, but it doesn't have such 
a handy interface. You can create a separate XML file, such as metadata.xmp, which can be 
included in the PDF:
\usepackage{xmpincl}
\includexmp{metadata}
You can also refer to the package manual for complete details and a sample .xmp file, as XML 
markup is beyond the scope of this book and the hyperxmp package already solves the task 
of our recipe.

Inserting comments
If you work collaboratively, you may want to add notes or comments to a document to share 
additional information with your coauthor which will be removed from the final version. The 
PDF standard supports comments, and so does LaTeX.
How to do it...
We will insert some comments into our small document example from Chapter 1, The Variety 
of Document Types. For brevity, we will directly look at the essential commands. As with all 
recipes, the full source code can be downloaded from http://latex-cookbook.net. 
Follow these essential steps for inserting comments:
1.	 Load the xcolor package in the preamble to get color support:
\usepackage[svgnames]{xcolor}
2.	 Load the pdfcomment package in the preamble:
\usepackage{pdfcomment}
You could define some default setting if you wish to , such as the following. Add them 
when loading:
\usepackage[author={Your name},icon=Note,
  color=Yellow,open=true]{pdfcomment}
3.	 To insert a simple comment with a marker symbol at a certain place in the document, 
call the \pdfcomment command right at that position:
\pdfcomment{Simple documents don't have chapters.}
4.	 You can let the comment marker appear in the margin instead:
\begin{equation}
  \pdfmargincomment{The equation environment produces
    a centered equation with whitespace before
    and after it.}
  ...
\end{equation}
5.	 To mark visible content while displaying a comment, select it by grouping it within 
curly braces and use the \pdfmarkupcomment command on it. Here, we highlight 
and comment the word sections:

Chapter 8
209
The text will be divided into
\pdfmarkupcomment{sections}{You could additionally
  use subsections.}.
6.	 Markup comments can be tooltips that become visible when we move the mouse 
pointer over them. Let's take a look at the following command:
\pdftooltip{formulas}{Formulas can be inline or
  displayed in their own paragraph}
7.	
You can embrace whole environments with a side line comment:
\begin{pdfsidelinecomment}[color=Red]{A bulleted list}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item ...
  \end{itemize}
\end{pdfsidelinecomment} 
8.	 Furthermore, you can place free text somewhere in the document with custom 
dimensions, color, and transparency, by using the following code:
\pdffreetextcomment[subject={Summary},width=7.5cm,
  height=2.2cm,opacity=0.5,voffset=-3cm]{The whole document
  is an example showing how to write a small document.
  Now we enriched it with sample comments.}
9.	 With all those comments put into our small sample document, compile twice and 
examine the results. Here's a simple comment, a markup comment, and a side line 
comment:

Getting the Most out of the PDF
210
Here, you can see a tooltip, a side comment, markup comments in math mode, and a 
free text comment:
10.	 To make all comments invisible in the final published version, add the final option:
\usepackage[...,final]{pdfcomment}
How it works...
There are a lot of style options for customizing the appearance of comments. You can see a 
selection here in this recipe. The full set is described in the pdfcomment package's manual. 
As usual, you can open it by typing the following at the command prompt:
texdoc pdfcomment
You can apply such options globally, as we did with the \usepackage package in the second 
step, or locally. In that case, use the options within square brackets as we would usually do in 
LaTeX:
\pdfcomment[icon=Insert,color=red,opacity=0.5,
  author=Me]{The comment}
Also execute the following command:
\pdfmarkupcomment[markup=StrikeOut,color=red]{Text}{The comment}
While some options, such as the width, height, and color, are self-explanatory, let's take 
a final look at the specialties.

Chapter 8
211
The icon option can have these values, according to the PDF standard, taken from the 
manual:
Further icons are supported by the Adobe Reader:
As a markup option, you can choose between Highlight, Underline, Squiggly, and 
StrikeOut.
Producing fillable forms
PDF files can be interactive. Users can fill forms before printing the entire document. With 
LaTeX, you can produce such forms. In this recipe, we will create a form.
How to do it...
Once again, we will use the hyperref package. Our goal is to produce small paper sheets for 
a survey as a fillable PDF form. A yellow background will distinguish it from other papers. The 
format will be landscape. Let's begin the process:
1.	 Start a new document with A6 paper in landscape format and with a small 
interparagraph space instead of paragraph indentation. Let's take a look at the 
following command:
\documentclass[a6paper,landscape,parskip=half]{scrartcl}

Getting the Most out of the PDF
212
2.	 Set a small margin to save space on screen:
\usepackage[margin=0.4cm]{geometry}
3.	 Set the background color to 30 percent yellow:
\usepackage{xcolor}
\pagecolor{yellow!30}
4.	 Choose an empty page style, so you won't get page numbers:
\pagestyle{empty}
5.	 Load the hyperref package:
\usepackage{hyperref}
6.	 Start the document and start a Form environment:
\begin{document}
\begin{Form}
7.	
For positioning, we will use a tabular environment. Within that, we use commands 
for form elements, such as \TextField, \ChoiceMenu, \CheckBox, and  
\PushButton:
\begin{tabular}{|lr|}\hline
  \textbf{Dear \TeX\ user, please help in our survey.} &
    \PushButton[width=1cm, onclick =
      {app.alert("You may use a pseudonym for the
      name.")}]{Info}\\[0.5ex] \hline
    & \\
    \TextField[width=5cm]{Name:} &
    \TextField[width=3cm]{Profession:} \\
    & \\
    \ChoiceMenu[radio, radiosymbol=6,
      width=0.5cm]{Software:\quad}{\TeX\ Live, MiK\TeX} 
    &\ChoiceMenu[combo, width=3cm]{Editor:}%
    {TeXworks,TeXstudio,TeXmaker,TeXshop,
    WinEdt,Kile,Emacs,vi} \\
    & \\
    Membership in: \hfill\CheckBox[width=0.5cm]{TUG}\hfill
    \CheckBox[width=0.5cm]{DANTE e.V.} &
    \TextField[width=3cm]{Other:}\\ & \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}

Chapter 8
213
8.	 Announce use of the remaining space for notes:
  \par
  \textbf{Notes:}
  \par
9.	 Provide a text field where the user will be able to write several lines:
  \TextField[multiline, width=0.94\paperwidth,
    height=10\baselineskip]{ }
10.	 End the form and the document:
\end{Form}
\end{document}
11.	 Compile the document and test it by filling in some values using a capable PDF 
viewer, such as the Adobe Reader:
12.	Save the PDF file, close it, and open it to verify that it stores your data.

214
How it works...
We used the following three commands for fillable elements:
f
f
\TextField[options]{label}: This gives a fillable text field
f
f
\CheckBox[options]{label}: This prints a box that can be checked or 
unchecked
f
f
\ChoiceMenu[options]{label}{list of choices}: This produces a  
drop-down menu where we can choose an element of a list
Some of the possible options for creating a form are as follows:
f
f
width, height, borderwidth: Dimensions of the element
f
f
charsize: The font size of the element text
f
f
color, backgroundcolor, bordercolor: Colors of the element
f
f
maxlen: The maximum allowed characters in a text field
f
f
value: The initial value, such as default text in a field
f
f
combo, radio, popdown: True or false, type of element
f
f
radiosymbol: The Zapf Dingbats symbol for radio button
f
f
checked: True or false; it decides if field is selected by default
Use these options using a key=value syntax, like we do in our example. All possible options 
are described in the hyperref package's manual.
We also placed a button in our form by using the following line of code:
\PushButton[onclick={app.alert(text)}]{label}
This command prints a button with the label text on it. If it is clicked, it opens a pop-up window 
via JavaScript, displaying text. You can also add options as we did in step 7 of this recipe.
You can use other JavaScript commands; for example, to let the user enter text in the pop-up 
window:
\PushButton[width=1cm, onclick =
  {app.response("What was your original motivation
  to start with LaTeX?")}]{Question}
Even an entire program can be inserted; for example, to use and evaluate the input. You can 
also bind JavaScript code to other actions, such as onmouseover and onselect. All of these 
event handlers are listed in the hyperref manual.
For more information on JavaScript supported by Adobe, visit http://www.adobe.com/
devnet/acrobat/javascript.html.

Chapter 8
215
The Form commands should only be used within a Form environment. 
There should be no more than one Form environment in the file. However, 
it can be extensive.
Optimizing the output for e-book readers
A traditional book is a set of pages; LaTeX, too, follows this tradition. However, today, e-book 
reading mediums such as the Kindle, iPad, tablets, and even smartphones, are popular for 
browsing the Internet and for reading documents.
In this recipe, we will see how to make a document e-reader-friendly.
How to do it...
Set up a preamble for a document that can be read on an electronic device such as a tablet 
reader, by performing the following steps:
1.	 Choose a suitable document class. Choose small headings and a small 
interparagraph skip instead of paragraph indentation. The latter costs too much 
space on an already narrow display:
\documentclass[fontsize=11pt,headings=small,
  parskip=half]{scrreprt}
2.	 Set a small paper size that matches a common screen ratio and choose a very small 
margin:
\usepackage[papersize={3.6in,4.8in},margin=0.2in]{geometry}
3.	 Choose a font that is easily readable on screen, especially with a low screen 
resolution; a sans-serif font may be a good choice:
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage{lmodern}
\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}
4.	 Load the microtype package for improving justification, which is even more 
important for smaller screens:
\usepackage{microtype}
5.	 Choose the empty page style. If the chapter or some of the pages of the chapter 
have their own style, set those to empty as well:
\pagestyle{empty}
\renewcommand{\partpagestyle}{empty}
\renewcommand{\chapterpagestyle}{empty}

Getting the Most out of the PDF
216
6.	 Use the hyperref package for easier browsing via hyperlinks. Colored links are to be 
preferred to the framed appearance, as you saw in the first recipe of this chapter:
\usepackage{hyperref}
\hypersetup{colorlinks}
7.	
In your document, use relative sizes instead of absolute values, as follows:
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{text}
How it works...
A tablet or smartphone is very different from a book, even though some reading software 
simulates the traditional feel, such as page flipping. Our approach honors the difference.
We chose a document class that works in one-sided mode. There's no need to insert blank 
pages to let chapters start on right-hand side pages.
With a KOMA-Script class, you can simply choose smaller headings than the default size by 
setting the class option to scrreprt. With other classes, you can change headings and their 
spacing by using the titlesec package.
The default paragraph indentation makes our already-narrow text even harder to justify, so 
we will remove that. Setting a parskip option does this automatically. We have even used 
the half parskip option to reduce the spacing. With a non-KOMA-Script class, load the 
parskip package.
We don't need excessive margins added to the mechanical margins of the reading device; 
that's why we used the geometry package with very small margins.
Choosing a font is a matter of taste. Serif fonts often look poor with low-resolution displays; 
that's why sans-serif fonts were often preferred. However, today's screens offer very high 
resolution, so the decision depends on your taste.
Since reader software displays page numbers, we don't need to reserve space for them. The 
empty page style does this for us.
There's more...
We can be more consequent in designing for e-books. Why turn pages when you can scroll 
down endlessly? We can forget all the challenges raised by page breaks, such as the concept 
of floating figures and tables. They can stay where we place them, because no page breaks 
will get in their way. Boris Veytsman and Michael Ware described an approach in Ebooks and 
paper sizes: Output routines made easier in TUGboat, Vol. 32, No.3, which is available at 
https://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb32-3/tb102veytsman-ebooks.pdf.

Chapter 8
217
The screenread package implements this idea; you can find it at http://www.phys.psu.
edu/~collins/screenread/.
Removing white margins
To reuse the PDF output of your LaTeX document in another document, in an e-book, or on a 
website, it's usually a good idea to remove the margins, or at least to make them smaller.
Getting ready
For this recipe, you need to have the following things installed:
f
f
The PostScript interpreter software—Ghostscript
f
f
The programming language—Perl
f
f
The pdfcrop script
Fortunately, TeX Live installs internal versions of Ghostscript and Perl by default, and offers 
the pdfcrop script as a package; so, TeX Live users are lucky. If you don't use TeX Live, 
you may need to install the software. You can find more information at http://www.
ghostscript.com, http://www.perl.org and http://ctan.org/pkg/pdfcrop.
How to do it...
The procedure is pretty easy, given that Command Prompt won't be an obstacle for you. We 
use LaTeX, so this won't be a challenge. Follow these steps for removing the white margins:
1.	 Open Command Prompt.


On Linux or Unix, open a shell


On Ubuntu, Linux, and Mac OS X, the shell you need to open is called 
Terminal


On Windows, open Command Prompt or run the program called cmd
2.	 Change into the directory of your generated PDF file.
3.	 Given that the document name is filename.pdf, execute the following command:
pdfcrop filename
4.	 The filename-crop.pdf file has been generated, open it to verify the result.

Getting the Most out of the PDF
218
How it works...
The pdfcrop program takes the PDF file and uses Ghostscript to calculate the bounding box 
for each page. It produces another PDF file in which the margins are removed.
The output is named with –crop as a name suffix by default. However, you can give the 
output file name as parameter in the command. The syntax to be called is as follows:
pdfcrop [options] filename[.pdf] [outputname]
You don't need to tell the program the .pdf file extension for the input file.
Using these options, you can decide to keep some margins:
f
f
Keep a 20 PostScript point margin on each side:
  pdfcrop --margins 20 input.pdf output.pdf
f
f
Keep 10, 20, 30, and 40 PostScript points at the left, top, right, and bottom, 
respectively:
  pdfcrop --margins '10 20 30 40' input.pdf output.pdf
A PostScript point is 1/72 inches; in TeX, it's called a big point and is written as 1 bp. The 
classical TeX point is slightly different, where 1 pt means 1/72.27 inches.
You can display options and information by using the following command:
pdfcrop –help
There's more...
You can remove the margins directly from the source code.
If the class doesn't matter, for example, because you are just generating a graphic, you can 
use the standalone class:
f
f
For a document without margins, use the following:
\documentclass{standalone}
f
f
To get a 10 pt margin, use the following:
\documentclass[border=10pt]{standalone}
f
f
For margins of 10 pt, 20 pt, 30 pt, and 40 pt at the left, right, bottom, and top, 
respectively, use the following:
\documentclass[border={10pt 20pt 30pt 40pt}]{standalone}

Chapter 8
219
You can freely choose another unit, such as in or cm.
The standalone class provides more handy features and is well documented. You can 
read the manual via texdoc standalone, or online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/
standalone.
The older preview package does a similar job. It can extract environments of a LaTeX 
document as separate graphic files.
Combining PDF files
Combining the source code of two LaTeX documents can be pretty hard, especially if they are 
based on different classes. However, combining their PDF output is pretty easy.
How to do it...
We will use the pdfpages package.
You can test it with the flyer example from Chapter 1, The Variety of Document Types, together 
with the form example from the current chapter. Let's get going:
1.	 Open a document and choose any class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the pdfpages package:
\usepackage{pdfpages}
3.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Include the first PDF file by using the command \includepdf. It takes the page 
range as an option. Use a dash (-) for the whole page range:
\includepdf[pages=-]{flyer}
5.	 Include the second PDF file:
\includepdf[pages=-]{form}
6.	 End the document:
\end{document}
7.	
Compile once, and look at the newly generated file, which contains both the flyer and 
the form.

Getting the Most out of the PDF
220
How it works...
The pdfpages package is primarily used for including PDF files in a LaTeX document, 
completely or partially. The pages=- option means all pages. We can specify a page range, 
such as pages={3-6}, for more complex sets, such as the pages={1,3-6,9} page.
We created a new document as a container and simply included both source PDF files in it.
This way, you can combine very different files, such as an application letter, curriculum vitae, 
and various scanned certificates, into a single file for an online job application.
If the included PDF would have hyperlinks, they would get lost. Instead of 
combining in a third document, you could include the simpler document, 
such as a cover PDF file, in the more complex document.
Creating an animation
To show a developing process or to demonstrate changes, an in-place animation can be more 
convenient than a series of images.
As an example application, we will draw a recursively-defined fractal curve, the Koch curve. 
An animation will present the stages of the curve, which become more complex with higher 
numbers of recursions.
How to do it...
The animate package provides a simple way to generate an animation. Try this with the Koch 
curve, to show growing complexity by performing the following steps:
1.	 Start with any document class. Here, we choose the standalone class, which we 
already mentioned earlier. Here, the paper tightly fits the animation:
\documentclass[border=10pt]{standalone}
2.	 Load the animate package:
\usepackage{animate}
3.	 Load the TikZ package. Furthermore, load the lindenmayersystems library for 
producing fractals, and the shadings library to fill with a shading:
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{lindenmayersystems,shadings}
4.	 We define the fractal with the library's syntax. Don't worry about it, as it's just for 
having stuff to play with. Let's take a look at the following commands:
\pgfdeclarelindenmayersystem{Koch curve}{
  \rule{F -> F-F++F-F}}

Chapter 8
221
5.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
6.	 We use an animateinline environment. We specify options to show control 
buttons to automatically start the animation, and to loop. This means that the 
animation restarts. The mandatory argument in curly braces is the speed; here, two 
frames per second:
\begin{animateinline}[controls,autoplay,loop]{2}
7.	
We use the \multiframe command to produce five frames, which we state as the 
first argument. The second argument is a variable, n, starting at 0 and incrementing 
by 1 in each step. Within this command, we will print the curve of order \n. Just take 
the TikZ curve code as it is, since we are focusing on the animation:
\multiframe{5}{n = 0+1}{
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale = 80]
    \shadedraw[shading = color wheel] 
    [l-system = { Koch curve, step=2pt, angle=60,
    axiom=F++F++F, order=\n }]
    lindenmayer system -- cycle;
  \end{tikzpicture}
}
8.	 End the animateinline environment and the document:
\end{animateinline}
\end{document}
9.	 Compile the document and open it in a compatible PDF viewer, such as Adobe 
Reader. Here is the output of  steps 2 and 5 of the animation. You can click on the 
buttons to play backward and forward, and to increase or decrease the speed:

Getting the Most out of the PDF
222
How it works...
We used two main features of the package:
f
f
The animateinline environment creates an animation from the environment's 
content, which means not from external files. Any drawing package can be used, such 
as TikZ or PSTricks. We used TikZ here.
f
f
The \multiframe command lets us build a loop around drawing commands. The 
syntax is as follows:
\multiframe{number of frames}{variable =
  initial value+increment}{drawing code with \variable}
The rest is drawn with TikZ. The \shadedraw command creates the actual drawing while 
filling it with shading. Here, we used a shiny shading called color wheel. It may show a 
nice glimpse of the TikZ package, while we focus on animating it. In Chapter 9, Creating 
Graphics, you will see more of TikZ. There's also a link to the manual, which explains the 
lindenmayersystems library.
With the animate package, you can also assemble animations from the existing image files. 
The command for this is as follows:
\animategraphics[options]{frame rate}{file basename}{first}{last}
In this command, within square brackets, options can be like the preceding options that are 
shown. If you set the file basename option to frame-, first to 4, and last to 12, the 
command will play the sequence from frame-4.png to frame-12.png, if they exist in a 
PNG format. The filename extension is used automatically, so, with pdfLaTeX, it will look for

Introduction
A picture is worth a thousand words. By presenting a single image, you can visualize a 
complex concept so that it becomes much easier to understand. Especially using diagrams, 
you can distill relevant information, and, for example, show relationships and processing 
orders or compare quantities.
This chapter mainly contains recipes for several kinds of diagram. We will start with simple 
diagrams and trees, then we will produce charts from data, finally we will build diagrams 
about concepts and events over time.

Creating Graphics
224
All the recipes in this chapter are based on pgf/TikZ, which is an enormously capable 
graphics package. PGF stands for Portable Graphics Format, which is the backend. TikZ 
is the frontend. The name is an abbreviation of TikZ ist kein Zeichenprogramm, which 
translates to "TikZ is not a drawing program". This recursive acronym, created in the tradition 
of GNU, should tell potential users what to expect: no WYSIWYG. This means that you cannot 
see the output during creation, but after compiling. However, with TikZ, you benefit from TeX's 
strong points: fine quality, macros, reusability, and a large number of existing libraries and 
packages.
There's another very capable graphics package for LaTeX with a long history and countless 
features—PSTricks. It is based on PostScript, which can be translated into PDF.
In this chapter, we will take the TikZ way, because of its very readable syntax, excellent 
documentation, and compatibility with all TeX engines (pdfTeX, LaTeX in DVI mode, XeTeX, and 
LuaTeX) and formats (LaTeX, plain TeX, and ConTeXt). Last but not least, the decision is led by 
a view of the growing popularity of TikZ in Internet forums over the years, which can also be 
verified using a Google Trends search.
We won't deal with how to draw rectangles or circles, since this is covered by the manual. 
Instead, we will start off by using modern packages for various purposes to create complete 
and useable graphics.
Getting ready
To compile the recipes in this chapter, you will need to have TikZ installed. Note that while the 
term TikZ is the popular name, the actual package name is pgf, which you will be able to see 
in the package manager of your LaTeX installation. Version 3.0 or later is recommended.
Most recipes use another package on top of TikZ. So, for each package mentioned at the 
beginning of a recipe, make sure you have it installed. A full TeX installation is recommended 
anyway.
In order to cover many complete and usable recipes in this chapter about graphics, the basic 
TikZ commands will not be explained. You can read about them in the reference manual at 
any time. It's assumed that you already know something about nodes, edges, and styles; take 
a look at the manual if you need to understand these concepts. Of course, it's explained in 
detail how the recipes themselves work.
So, for further customization and a deeper understanding, keep the TikZ manual at hand. You 
can open it simply by typing texdoc tikz or texdoc pgf in the command line. The same 
applies to each package used.
If you are reading this book without having a TeX installation with 
documentation available, visit http://texdoc.net/pkg/tikz.

Building smart diagrams
First, let's focus on a quick win: getting a diagram with minimal technical effort. We would just 
need to fill in our thoughts.
The smartdiagram package makes building diagrams of various types very easy. We will start 
with creating a flowchart about a TeX workflow. Then we will explore further diagram types.
How to do it...
Once you have loaded the smartdiagram package, all you need is a simple command. 
Follow these steps:
1.	 As always, begin with any document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the smartdiagram package:
\usepackage{smartdiagram}
3.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Define the diagram. An option in square brackets defines the type, and an argument 
in curly braces contains a comma-separated list of items:
\smartdiagram[flow diagram:horizontal]{Edit,
  \LaTeX, Bib\TeX/ biber, make\-index, \LaTeX}
5.	 End the document:
\end{document}
6.	 Compile, and take a look at the flowchart of a TeX workflow:

Creating Graphics
226
How it works...
A simple call of \smartdiagram plus arguments produced the image. The syntax of the 
command is as follows:
\smartdiagram[type of diagram]{list of items}
We chose a horizontal flow diagram. Use only flow diagram to get a vertical layout. There's 
a specific set of diagram types. Instead of just listing them, let's perform some examples to 
take a look at the results.
There's more...
We can play a bit with the diagram type and items to get different diagrams. If there's a root 
item or a central item, it's always the first in the list.
Circular diagrams
Let's try a circular diagram. It is counterclockwise by default. Add :clockwise to the option 
to get a clockwise order:
\smartdiagram[circular diagram:clockwise]{Edit,
  pdf\LaTeX, Bib\TeX/ biber, make\-index, pdf\LaTeX}
The following figure shows the circular diagram of a TeX workflow:

Chapter 9
227
Bubble diagrams
To simply present some words in the main context, you can use a bubble diagram. The first 
item on the list is in a central circle. All the other items are placed in colored circles around it. 
They are slightly overlapping so as to visualize a close relationship.
To get macros for more TeX logos, we will load the dtklogos package in addition, so add this 
to the preamble:
\usepackage{dtklogos}
Alternatively, you can use the metalogo package, which gives logo commands such as  
\XeTeX. Combining strings by writing Lua\TeX instead would be another idea.
The smartdiagram call becomes this:
\smartdiagram[bubble diagram]{\TeX\ engines,
  \TeX\ (dvi), pdf\TeX, \XeTeX, \LuaTeX, \ConTeXt}

Creating Graphics
228
Constellation diagrams
Let's take a bubble diagram, and put the child concepts more far away from the center 
concept. Then, we point with arrows from the center to the surrounding child concept. That's 
what we here call a constellation diagram. Again, the center is the first item in the list:
\smartdiagram[constellation diagram]{\TeX\ software,
  Editor, Compiler, Converter, PDF Reader}

Chapter 9
229
Descriptive diagrams
For nicely arranging items with a description, there's the descriptive diagram. That's a 
graphical list of items with a description. This requires a nested list: we need a list of lines, 
where each line is a small list of the item and its description. We construct them with curly 
braces. We use additional curly braces to hide the comma within an item so that it won't be 
taken as an item separator:
\smartdiagram[descriptive diagram]{
  {Style,{Define shapes, colors, shading,
          and line styles for nodes and arrows}},
  {Position, {Place nodes using a matrix,
              relative or absolute positioning}},
  {Relation, Insert edges or arrows
             between selected nodes},
  {Label, Add labels on edges or arrows}}
This gives us the following diagram:
By the way, the diagram shows some tasks about drawing with TikZ, which can later be useful 
for us.

Creating Graphics
230
Priority descriptive diagrams
If your descriptive diagram has a certain order and you would like to emphasize that order, 
use a priority descriptive diagram, like this:
\smartdiagram[priority descriptive diagram]{
  Develop a document structure,
  Choose a document class,
  Select suitable packages,
  Setup the document preamble,
  Write your document,
  Finetune the layout}

Chapter 9
231
Animating a diagram
In a presentation done with the beamer class, you can easily animate such a diagram. It's as 
simple as the following:
f
f
Using the beamer class
f
f
Using a frame environment for the diagram
f
f
Writing \smartdiagramanimated instead of \smartdiagram
This, applied to one of the examples you saw earlier, results in the following:
\documentclass{beamer}
\usepackage{smartdiagram}
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
  \smartdiagramanimated[circular diagram]{Edit,
  pdf\LaTeX, Bib\TeX/ biber, make\-index, pdf\LaTeX}
\end{frame}
\end{document}
The diagram will then be built step by step, frame by frame.
Further customization
Of course, you can set the colors and shapes of all elements. For details, refer to the 
smartdiagram manual, as usual via texdoc.
Constructing a flowchart
In the previous recipe, Building smart diagrams, we used predefined chart types. In a case 
when we would need more flexibility, we can do it ourselves from scratch. It's also not too 
hard, and it's a very good way of learning to draw with TikZ.
We will create a flowchart depicting the decision-making procedure for choosing a math 
environment.
Similar to what we saw in our description diagram of the first recipe, we will do the following:
1.	 Define shapes and colors.
2.	 Place nodes using a matrix.
3.	 Insert labeled arrows between selected nodes.
Of course, whatever is done in each step may be modified at any time. It's usual to place 
nodes and arrows at first, and then start fine-tuning shapes and colors.

Creating Graphics
232
So let's tackle it. Go through the following steps, and also look at the graphical output shown 
after them to understand the meaning of your drawing tasks:
1.	 Start with a document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 We load the geometry package and specify a vertical margin so that the long chart 
will fit to the page:
\usepackage[a4paper,vmargin=3cm]{geometry}
3.	 Load the tikz package:
\usepackage{tikz}
4.	 Load the matrix, calc, and shapes TikZ libraries:
\usetikzlibrary{matrix,calc,shapes}
5.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
6.	 We define styles for the nodes, which is our first major step:
\tikzset{
  treenode/.style = {shape=rectangle, rounded corners,
                     draw, anchor=center,
                     text width=5em, align=center,
                     top color=white, bottom color=blue!20,
                     inner sep=1ex},
  decision/.style = {treenode, diamond, inner sep=0pt},
  root/.style     = {treenode, font=\Large,
                     bottom color=red!30},
  env/.style      = {treenode, font=\ttfamily\normalsize},
  finish/.style   = {root, bottom color=green!40},
  dummy/.style    = {circle,draw}
}
7.	
Create some useful shortcuts for edge types:
\newcommand{\yes}{edge node [above] {yes}}
\newcommand{\no}{edge  node [left]  {no}}
8.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
9.	 Begin the TikZ picture. Add the desired options; here, we just declare –latex as the 
default arrow tip for edges:
\begin{tikzpicture}[-latex]

Chapter 9
233
10.	 Now comes the second major step-positioning. Start a matrix with the name chart:
  \matrix (chart)
11.	 Define the options for the matrix:
    [
      matrix of nodes,
      column sep      = 3em,
      row sep         = 5ex,
      column 1/.style = {nodes={decision}},
      column 2/.style = {nodes={env}}
    ]
12.	Now add the actual matrix contents, which will be the nodes of your flowchart. As with 
tabular, columns are separated by & and lines end with \\. This is also necessary 
for the last line. We modify the style of a certain node by inserting |<style>| before 
the node content. A final semicolon ends the \matrix command with options:
    {
      |[root]| Formula           &                 \\
      single-line?               & equation        \\
      centered?                  & gather          \\
      aligned at relation sign?  & align, flalign  \\
      aligned at several places? & alignat         \\
      first left, centered,
        last right?              & multline        \\
      & & |[decision]| numbered? \\
      & & |[treenode]| Add a \texttt{*}
                                 & |[finish]| Done \\
    };
13.	Now for the third major step-drawing arrows. Draw the no edges in the first column 
downwards and the yes edges to the right. We use \foreach loops to reduce the 
quantity of code. The final edge goes to the final node in the bottom-right corner:
  \draw
    (chart-1-1) edge (chart-2-1)
    \foreach \x/\y in {2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6} {
      (chart-\x-1) \no (chart-\y-1) }
    \foreach \x in {2,...,6} {
       (chart-\x-1) \yes (chart-\x-2) }
   (chart-7-3) \no  (chart-8-3)
   (chart-8-3) edge (chart-8-4);
14.	 Draw a line back to the start:
 \draw
   (chart-6-1) -- +(-2,0) |- (chart-1-1)
     node[near start,sloped,above] {no, reconsider};

Creating Graphics
234
15.	Next, draw lines from the nodes in the second column to another node down  
in the third column:
  \foreach \x in {2,...,6} {
   \draw (chart-\x-2) -| (chart-7-3);}
16.	 Draw a yes edge to the final node at the bottom-right corner:
 \draw   (chart-7-3)  -| (chart-8-4)
   node[near start,above] {yes}; 
17.	 End the picture and the document:
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
18.	Compile, and examine the output:

Chapter 9
235
How it works...
Positioning the nodes is one of the main things here. Providing coordinates for nodes would 
be too laborious and error-prone. Using relative positioning of nodes would be another option. 
But the easiest is defining a matrix where we can place nodes as simply as within tabular. 
This requires a kind of grid structure, however. TikZ provides a matrix library, which has a 
section of its own in the manual. Refer to it to understand all the options. Here, we defined 
only the space between rows and columns and some styles for columns.
Styles can be defined locally; for example, as an option in a tikzpicture environment. For 
repeated use, it is better to define them globally. For this, we used the \tikzset command. It 
takes a list of style assignments as the argument. As you saw the following principle:
thingy/.style = {list of style options}
You can redefine existing styles in this way, or create your own styles. Now you can simply use 
that new style name as an option wherever needed instead of always listing specific options. 
You get the same benefits here as with macros, such as readability and consistency.
You can combine styles and use them to define derived styles. So, we defined a base style for 
tree nodes, created additional styles that inherited it, and added some code.
Now, back to our code; our matrix structure is as follows:
\matrix (name) [options] {
  entry & entry & … \\
  entry & entry & … \\
  …
};
For additional drawing, each node of the matrix now gets a name. We can refer to it as 
(name-row-column), just as we did here:
\draw (chart-1-1) edge (chart-2-1);
This draws a vertical edge from the top-left node of our chart to the node below it.
For column styles, we used the handy nodes={decision} syntax, which simply says that 
all nodes should have this style. We still can apply local styles, so we used the |[style]| 
shortcut at the beginning of the matrix cells.
After the matrix, we used \draw to draw all the edges. They are arrows in our case, since we 
added the –latex option to tikzpicture. We could have chosen -> instead; latex gives 
just another arrow tip.

Creating Graphics
236
To repeat things efficiently, we used \foreach loops. The simplified syntax is as follows:
\foreach <variables> in {<list>} { <commands> }
Here, the commands can contain variables. These are replaced by list values, iterating 
through the whole list. The \foreach loop has an entire section in the TikZ manual. For our 
recipe, that syntax and the samples with one variable and two variables should suffice for a 
basic understanding.
A special edge is drawn by -|. This means a horizontal line and then a vertical line to the 
destination. The |- sign is its counterpart, which works the other way round. For details 
regarding drawing syntax and the available options, refer to the TikZ manual. It also contains 
tutorials that are really useful for diving into the topic quickly.
Building a tree
A very common type of hierarchical graph is a tree. Tree nodes have children. These are 
connected by edges and are usually displayed in rows when growing down, or in columns 
when growing horizontally.
We will draw a tree presenting possible math formula layouts.
How to do it...
We will use basic TikZ, without any extra package. Follow these steps:
1.	 Start with a document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the tikz package:
\usepackage{tikz}
3.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Begin with a TikZ picture, and specify some options for it:
\begin{tikzpicture}[sibling distance=10em,
  every node/.style = {shape=rectangle, rounded corners,
    draw, align=center,
    top color=white, bottom color=blue!20}]]

Chapter 9
237
5.	 Draw a node and add children to it:
  \node {Formulas}
    child { node {single-line} }
    child { node {multi-line}
      child { node {aligned at}
        child { node {relation sign} }
        child { node {several places} }
        child { node {center} } }
      child { node {first left,\\centered,\\last right} }
    };
6.	 End the picture and the document:
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
7.	
Compile, and take a look:
How it works...
To avoid overlapping, we defined a distance between siblings. As all the nodes were the same, 
we defined one style for all of them, using a rounded rectangle as the drawn border and a 
color that transits from white to light blue. We did this by setting these options to every 
node/.style. This default style simplifies writing. We can still change specific node styles, 
however.

Creating Graphics
238
There's more...
We can play a bit with the diagram type and items to get different diagrams. If there's a root 
item or a central item, it's always the first in the list.
Creating a decision tree
Our recipe started with a vertical tree. We can also draw a tree horizontally. Let's do it this way 
now. We will use this occasion to introduce TikZ styles. A style is a set of options. Styles make 
drawing easier, similar to macros; we don't need to repeat the same options again and again. 
Instead, we refer to a desired style. Styles can also be combined.
We will now go through building the tree in detail. These are our steps:
1.	 Again, start with a document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the tikz package:
\usepackage{tikz}
3.	 Use the \tikzset command to define your own new styles:
\tikzset{
  treenode/.style = {shape=rectangle, rounded corners,
                     draw, align=center,
                     top color=white,
                     bottom color=blue!20},
  root/.style     = {treenode, font=\Large,
                     bottom color=red!30},
  env/.style      = {treenode, font=\ttfamily\normalsize},
  dummy/.style    = {circle,draw}
}
4.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
5.	 Begin with the TikZ picture:
\begin{tikzpicture}

Chapter 9
239
6.	 Add options to the TikZ picture. As before, use square brackets:
  [
    grow                    = right,
    sibling distance        = 6em,
    level distance          = 10em,
    edge from parent/.style = {draw, -latex},
    every node/.style       = {font=\footnotesize},
    sloped
  ]  
7.	
Declare the nodes and children in the tree hierarchy. If an edge needs to be labeled, 
add a node using the edge from parent option after the node:
  \node [root] {Formula}
    child { node [env] {equation}
      edge from parent node [below] {single-line?} }
    child { node [dummy] {}
      child { node [dummy] {}
        child { node [env] {align\\flalign}
          edge from parent node [below]
                           {at relation sign?} }
        child { node [env] {alignat}
          edge from parent node [above] {at several}
                           node [below] {places?} }
        child { node [env] {gather}
                edge from parent node [above] {centered?} }
        edge from parent node [below] {aligned?} }
      child { node [env] {multline}
              edge from parent node [above, align=center]
                {first left,\\centered,}
              node [below] {last right}}
              edge from parent node [above] {multi-line?}};
8.	 End the TikZ picture and the document:
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

Creating Graphics
240
9.	 Compile, and take a look:
The main difference is grow=right, for getting a horizontal tree. Besides this, we used 
various custom styles for the nodes. After a node that is connected to its parent by an edge, 
we use the edge from parent option to add a node with label text.
Building a bar chart
A classic way of displaying categories with corresponding values is a bar chart. It consists of 
rectangular bars, and they are proportional to the represented values. The main purpose is to 
visually compare those values.
We will draw a chart visualizing web forum statistics.
How to do it...
We will use the pgfplots package. It's for natively plotting in LaTeX with a convenient user 
interface. We will use it to produce a horizontal bar chart.
Perform these steps:
1.	 Start with a document class:
\documentclass{article} 
2.	 Load the pgfplots package:
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\pgfplotsset{width=7cm,compat=1.8}

Chapter 9
241
3.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Begin a TikZ picture, which will be the container for the plot:
\begin{tikzpicture}
5.	 Open an axis environment:
  \begin{axis}
6.	 Give options to the axis:
 [
    title    = Contributions per category
               at LaTeX-Community.org,
    xbar,
    y axis line style = { opacity = 0 },
    axis x line       = none,
    tickwidth         = 0pt,
    enlarge y limits  = 0.2,
    enlarge x limits  = 0.02,
    nodes near coords,
    symbolic y coords = {LaTeX, Tools,
                         Distributions, Editors},
  ]
7.	
Add a plot:
  \addplot coordinates { (57727,LaTeX) (5672,Tools)
           (2193,Distributions) (11106,Editors) };
8.	 Add another plot:
  \addplot coordinates { (14320,LaTeX) (1615,Tools)
           (560,Distributions)  (3075,Editors)  };
9.	 Then, add a legend:
  \legend{Topics, Posts}
10.	 End the axis environment, the TikZ picture, and the whole document:
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

Creating Graphics
242
11.	 Compile, and take a look:
How it works...
The \addplot command does the plotting work; we called it with a set of specific 
coordinates. In our case, we used numeric values together with symbolic coordinates for the 
subjects.
We designed the plot in Step 6 by adding a lot of customization options to the axis 
environment. This is the specific pgfplots environment with a lot of options for customizing. 
Here's what we did:
1.	 We provided a title.
2.	 We set xbar as a style to get bars in the x direction. Specifically, this means that 
horizontal bars will be placed from y=0 to the x coordinate.
3.	 Omitting unnecessary diagram parts means less distraction. This helps in focusing 
and understanding the contents. Therefore, we did the following:


We chose a completely opaque line style for the y axis so that it would n't  
be printed


We hid the x axis using axis x line = none


We removed the x axis ticks by setting their width to 0
4.	 Then, we enlarged the x and y limits a bit to get a better display.
5.	 We placed the nodes with values near the bars by enabling the nodes near 
coords option.
6.	 We defined symbolic coordinates as y values so that we could assign numeric (x) 
values to (y) subjects.

Chapter 9
243
To sum up, xbar defined the plot style, and symbolic y coords let us use string values. 
The other axis options were just for the design. There are many more possible settings, so for 
further customization, refer to the pgfplots manual. You can open it by entering texdoc 
pgfplots in Command Prompt or visiting http://texdoc.net/pkg/pgfplots.
Drawing a pie chart
Pie charts are popular for showing proportions. A pie chart's main characteristic is that all 
items usually sum up to 100 percent. They are displayed as segments of a disc.
As an example, we will use a pie chart to display the relative amount of questions about 
different TeX distributions.
How to do it...
We will use the pgf-pie package, which builds on TikZ and is specialized for generating pie 
charts. Follow these steps:
1.	 Start with a document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the pgf-pie package:
\usepackage{pgf-pie}
3.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Begin a TikZ picture, which will be the container of the pie chart:
\begin{tikzpicture}
5.	 Draw a pie chart using this command:
 \pie [rotate = 180]
    {62/\TeX\ Live and Mac\TeX,
     32/MiK\TeX\ and Pro\TeX t, 6/Other \TeX}
6.	 End the TikZ picture and the entire document:
\end{tikzpicture}

How it works...
The \pie command is the only user command in the pgf-pie package. The syntax is  
as follows:
\pie[options]{number1/text1, number2/text2, …}
The backslashes in our example were just because of the \TeX macro and the following space.
Let's take a look at the available options, with example values:
f
f
pos = 4,6: This positions the center at point (4,6). The default center is (0,0).
f
f
rotate = 90: This rotates the chart by 90 degrees.
f
f
radius = 5: This sets the chart's radius size to 5. The default size is 3.
f
f
color = red: This chooses the color red for all the slices. We can use any color 
syntax which TikZ understands, such as red!80!black for a mix of 80% red and 
20% black.
f
f
color = {red!20, red!40, red!60}: This sets a specific red color value for 
each of the three slices.
f
f
explode = 0.1: This moves all the slices outwards by 0.1.
f
f
explode = { 0.2, 0, 0}: This moves only the first slice of the three outwards  
by 0.2.
f
f
sum = 50: This defines the reference sum as 50, instead of the default sum of 100.

Chapter 9
245
f
f
sum = auto: This calculates the sum from the slice values.
f
f
scale font: This scales the font size according to the slice value.
f
f
before number = { \$ }: This inserts text before the values, in this case a dollar 
sign. It is empty by default.
f
f
after number = { percent }: This adds text after each value, in this case the 
word percent. With sum = 100, the default is %; otherwise, it is empty.
f
f
text = pin: This sets the text next to the slice, connected by a short line.
f
f
text = inside: This places the text within the slice.
f
f
text = legend: This produces a separate legend.
f
f
style = drop shadow: This adds a shadow below the chart.
There's more...
The pie-chart package offers further chart designs. Let's take a look at them, together  
with applying some of the styles we just covered.
Square charts
The square option gives a quadratic design. Adding the scale font and color options,  
we arrive at this:
  \pie [square, scale font,
        color = {blue!10, blue!20, blue!40}] { ... }
With the values from our recipe, we get the following:

246
Polar area charts
The polar option changes the layout so that the slices get equal angles but the radius 
represents the size. We add the explode and text=legend options:
  \pie [polar, explode=0.1, text=legend] { ... }
Thus, we get this output:
Cloud charts
The cloud option produces a set of discs whose sizes are determined by the given values.  
This time, we put the text inside, scale it, and use a larger radius:
  \pie [cloud, text=inside, scale font, radius=6] { ... }
Now, the result is as follows:

Drawing a Venn diagram
A Venn diagram displays several sets with their relationships. Commonly, these are 
overlapping circles. Such sets can stand for certain properties. If an element has two such 
properties, it will belong to an overlapping area-the intersection of the two relevant sets.
In this recipe, we will draw a Venn diagram of three sets.
How to do it...
We will draw colored circles and apply blending to their intersections. Go through these steps:
1.	 Choose a document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the tikz package:
\usepackage{tikz}
3.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Begin a TikZ picture environment:
\begin{tikzpicture}
5.	 Use a scope environment to apply a style to a part of the drawing. Here, we apply 
color blending:
  \begin{scope}[blend group=soft light]
6.	 Draw the diagram parts, which in our case are simply filled circles:
    \fill[red!30!white]   ( 90:1.2) circle (2);
    \fill[green!30!white] (210:1.2) circle (2);
    \fill[blue!30!white]  (330:1.2) circle (2);
7.	
End the scope environment. At the end of the environment, the blending effect will 
end, because environments keep the settings local:
 \end{scope}
8.	 Add nodes with text for the descriptions:
  \node at ( 90:2)    {Typography};
  \node at (210:2)    {Design};
  \node at (330:2)    {Coding};
  \node [font=\Large] {\LaTeX};

248
9.	 End the TikZ picture and the document:
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
10.	 Compile, and take a look at the output:
How it works...
We created three filled circles. The center of each circle is specified in polar coordinates, with 
a given angle and distance from the origin. This makes radial placement easier. For example, 
the first circle has its center at (90:1.2). This means that the center is at 90 degrees, which is 
above the origin, and the distance to the origin is 1.2. The radius of each circle is 2, so they 
are overlapping.
Normally, overlapping would simply mean that the final circle overrides what is below it. We 
still wish to look behind the circles to see the intersections. A classical approach is to use 
transparency, like this, for example:
\begin{scope}[opacity=0.5]
   ...
\end{scope}
This lets the background shine through. We used a scope environment to keep the setting 
local. The opacity value can be between 0, which means totally transparent, and 1, which 
means totally opaque.

Chapter 9
249
Another pleasing way for getting transparent graphics is by using the blend mode feature of 
the PDF standard; that's what we did. It's mixing colors in a certain way. The possible ways are 
as follows, in short:
f
f
normal: Any object is simply drawn over the background.
f
f
multiply: Color values of mixed objects are multiplied. A black factor always 
produces black and a white factor causes no change. Generally, we get darker colors 
as the product.
f
f
screen: This complements the color values, multiplies, and complements again.  
A white factor always produces white and a black factor causes no change.  
Generally, we get lighter colors in such a mix.
f
f
overlay: This is like the multiply or the screen option. It depends on the  
background color.
f
f
darken: The darker of the mixed colors is chosen.
f
f
lighten: The lighter color of the mix is chosen.
f
f
colordodge: The background is brightened to reflect the foreground.
f
f
colorburn: The background is darkened to reflect the foreground.
f
f
hardlight: This is like the multiply or the screen option. It depends on the 
foreground color. It appears like a hard spotlight.
f
f
softlight: This darkens or lightens the color, depending on the foreground color, 
like a softened spotlight.
f
f
difference: This subtracts the darker color from the lighter color.
f
f
exclusion: This is like difference, but with lower contrast.
f
f
hue: The resulting color has the hue of the foreground and the saturation and 
luminosity of the background.
f
f
saturation: The resulting color has the saturation of the foreground and the hue 
and luminosity of the background.
f
f
color: The resulting color has the hue of the foreground and the saturation and 
luminosity of the background.
f
f
luminosity: This is the inverse of color; the resulting color has the luminosity  
of the foreground and the hue and saturation of the background.
These modes are described in the PDF standard, which is cited in the TikZ manual, in the 
Blend modes section.
What seems a bit ambitious just for overlapping colors in a Venn diagram could be generally 
useful in overlapping drawings. You may try out those modes to see what fits your needs best.

Putting thoughts in a mind map
A mind map visualizes information or ideas. Usually, there's a main concept in the center and 
major concepts branching outward from it. Smaller ideas start from the major concepts, so a 
mind map can look like a spider web.
In this recipe, we will draw a mind map of the concepts of TeX.
How to do it...
We will use the TikZ mindmap library. Follow these steps:
1.	 Start with a document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the geometry package with the landscape option so that your wide  
mindmap will fit the page:
\usepackage[landscape]{geometry}
3.	 Then, load the tikz package:
\usepackage{tikz}
4.	 Next, load the mindmap TikZ library:
\usetikzlibrary{mindmap}
5.	 Load the dtklogos package to get additional TeX-related logo macros:
\usepackage{dtklogos}
6.	 Start the document and begin the TikZ picture:
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
7.	
Start a path with options:
  \path [
8.	 Provide the mindmap option and choose the white text color:
    mindmap,
    text = white,

Chapter 9
251
9.	 Adjust the styles for the levels of the map:
    level 1 concept/.append style =
      {font=\Large\bfseries, sibling angle=90},
    level 2 concept/.append style =
      {font=\normalsize\bfseries},
    level 3 concept/.append style =
      {font=\small\bfseries},
10.	 Define some styles for use in related concepts, and end the option list:
    tex/.style     = {concept, ball color=blue,
      font=\Huge\bfseries},
    engines/.style = {concept, ball color=green!50!black},
    formats/.style = {concept, ball color=blue!50!black},
    systems/.style = {concept, ball color=red!90!black},
    editors/.style = {concept, ball color=orange!90!black}
  ]
11.	 Now place the main concept node and its children. The structure is similar to the 
Building a tree recipe in this chapter. End the path with a semicolon:
  node [tex] {\TeX} [clockwise from=0]
    child[concept color=green!50!black, nodes={engines}] {
      node {Engines} [clockwise from=90]
        child { node {\TeX} }
        child { node {pdf\TeX} }
        child { node {\XeTeX} }
        child { node {Lua\TeX} }}
    child [concept color=blue, nodes={formats}] {
      node {Formats} [clockwise from=300]
        child { node {\LaTeX} }
        child { node {\ConTeXt} }}
    child [concept color=red, nodes={systems}] {
      node {Systems} [clockwise from=210]
        child { node {\TeX Live} [clockwise from=300]
          child { node {Mac \TeX} }}
        child { node {MiK\TeX} [clockwise from=60]
          child { node {Pro \TeX t} }}}
    child [concept color=orange, nodes={editors}] {
      node {Editors} };

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
13.	Compile, and examine the output:
How it works...
The most important option here is the mindmap style, which adds further styles and settings 
for implicit use, such as the concept style for nodes. They are responsible for the basic 
appearance.
First, we fine-tuned the design by adding style options for each level of subconcept. So,  
we chose a bold font-it improved the readability of the white text in darker concepts-and  
chose smaller font sizes for concepts farther away from the root. After doing this, we added  
a sibling angle value to tell TikZ the angle between major concepts. We would have 
chosen a smaller angle if we had more concepts.

Chapter 9
253
Furthermore, we created our own styles. They extend the standard concept node style 
by adding ball shading. This gives us a 3D appearance. On one hand, it should be just a 
demonstration of how to add some bells and whistles; on the other hand, flat colors may 
seem a bit boring if we remove the ball color option to get a more sober style. You may try 
colors and shadings offered by TikZ.
The path is just like the tree in our earlier tree recipe. The notable options are as follows:
f
f
start angle: This is set by clockwise from = …, which could be 
counterclockwise as an alternative.
f
f
nodes = {style name}: This applies our chosen style to all children.
f
f
concept color: This is for the color behind our ball shading. It is also applied to 
the node connections.
The mindmap library has a dedicated section in the TikZ manual. There, you can read about 
alternative connections between nodes, and adding annotations.
Generating a timeline
By using a basic TikZ function, it's not too hard to create a line and add some ticks, date 
values, and annotations. But it can require a lot of work, until it looks nice.
This recipe will show you another colorful and predesigned way: using the timeline library.
Getting ready
Until the timelime library officially becomes part of TikZ or becomes available on CTAN, you 
can download the tikzlibrarytimeline.code.tex file from its author's repository at 
https://github.com/cfiandra/timeline. You can install it in the TeX tree like any 
other package, but the easiest way is to simply put it into the same folder as your main TeX 
document.
How to do it...
The timelime library builds on TikZ, but also provides its own high-level commands. Follow 
these steps:
1.	 Start with a document class whose paper size is big enough:
\documentclass[a3paper]{article}
2.	 Load the geometry package with the landscape option, since your diagram will be 
wider than it is high:
\usepackage[landscape]{geometry}

Creating Graphics
254
3.	 Load the tikz package:
\usepackage{tikz}
4.	 Then, load the timeline TikZ library:
\usetikzlibrary{timeline}
5.	 Start the document and begin the TikZ picture:
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
6.	 State the number of weeks:
  \timeline{5}
7.	
Define the time phases:
  \begin{phases}
    \initialphase{involvement degree=3cm,phase color=blue}
    \phase{between week=1 and 2 in 0.4,
      involvement degree=5cm,phase color=green!50!black}
    \phase{between week=2 and 3 in 0.2,
      involvement degree=6cm,phase color=red!40!black}
    \phase{between week=3 and 4 in 0.5,
      involvement degree=3cm,phase color=red!90!black}
    \phase{between week=4 and 5 in 0.3,
      involvement degree=2.5cm,phase color=red!40!yellow}
  \end{phases}
8.	 Add some text nodes as annotations on the left-hand side:
  \node [xshift=-0.6cm,yshift=1cm,anchor=east,
         font=\Large\bfseries] at (phase-0.180)
         {Auhor};
  \node [xshift=-0.6cm,yshift=-1cm,anchor=east,
         font=\Large\bfseries] at (phase-0.180)
         {Publisher};
9.	 Add milestones on the upper side of the timeline:
  \addmilestone{at=phase-0.120,direction=120:1cm,
    text={Concept}, text options={above}}
  \addmilestone{at=phase-0.90,direction=90:1.2cm,
    text={Outline}}
  \addmilestone{at=phase-1.110,direction=110:1.5cm,
    text={Research}}

Chapter 9
255
  \addmilestone{at=phase-2.100,direction=100:1cm,
    text={Writing}}
  \addmilestone{at=phase-2.60,direction=90:1.5cm,
     text={First draft}}
  \addmilestone{at=phase-3.90,direction=90:1.2cm,
    text={Second draft}}
   \addmilestone{at=phase-4.90,direction=90:0.8cm,
     text={Approval of print draft}}
10.	 Then, add milestones on the lower side of the timeline:
   \addmilestone{at=phase-0.270,direction=270:1cm,
     text={Concept Review}, text options={below}}
   \addmilestone{at=phase-2.270,direction=270:1cm,
    text={First Review}}
   \addmilestone{at=phase-3.250,direction=250:0.8cm,
     text={Second Review}}
   \addmilestone{at=phase-3.300,direction=270:1.5cm,
     text={Approval required}}
   \addmilestone{at=phase-4.260,direction=270:2.2cm,
    text={Draft for printing}}
  \addmilestone{at=phase-4.300,direction=300:1cm,
    text={Publication}}

How it works...
With \timeline{5}, we created a filled rectangle with five weeks. Choose another number 
for more or fewer weeks. There's a node for each week that you can use for additional 
drawing; simply refer to (week-1) and so on as named nodes.
Within the phases environment, we defined the filled circles. They stand for the various time 
phases. Let's look at the sample phase arguments to understand their use:
f
f
between week=1 and 2 in 0.4: This means starting at week 1 and ending at 
week 2, with an offset of 0.4 for fine-tuning
f
f
involvement degree: This is the radius of the phase circle
f
f
phase color: This is the fill color of the phase circle
That's specific syntax for basic elements as such.
Finally, we added milestones. These are text nodes connected to a phase with a line:
f
f
At: This means the starting position. It's good to use relative positioning, such as 
phase-1.north for "above the phase-1 node". We used the phase-n.angle TikZ 
syntax here.
f
f
direction: This is given as polar values, like this: (angle:distance).
f
f
text: This is the text within the node. We used the text options key to customize 
the placement. This option is sticky, so it will be remembered. The text was placed 
above until we changed text options to below, which was then kept.
The library gives a nice quick start for a project plan.

Introduction
One of the classic strong points of LaTeX is its excellent quality in typesetting formulas. That's 
why LaTeX is the most used writing software in mathematics. Other sciences benefit from it as 
well when it comes to formulas.
This chapter provides selected recipes for common tasks. It's expected that readers already 
know the basics of writing math but to also support beginners we will start with a quick 
tutorial. If you already have math writing experience, you can safely skip the first recipe.
Like in the previous chapter, we will see some recipes for creating graphics. This time we will 
focus on mathematics, such as visualizing maps and functions, and practicing geometry.
At the end you can find a list with documentation and online resources for mathematics with 
LaTeX.

Advanced Mathematics
258
Quick-start for beginners
LaTeX provides a special syntax for math expressions. Furthermore, it has to be declared what 
is math but not text to get properly printed. Let's see how to write math!
How to do it...
We will practice math basics now. Let's write a document:
1.	 As usual, start with a document class.
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
3.	 Let's have an unnumbered section for our text:
\section*{The golden ratio}
4.	 Write a statement containing math. Enclose each math formula within parentheses. 
As usual for LaTeX commands, write a backslash before each parenthesis.
The symbol for the golden ratio is the Greek
letter \( \varphi \). Its value is the positive
solution of \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \).
5.	 Continue the text; this time, math shall be set off and centered:
It can be calculated to:
\[
  \varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.618 \ldots
\]
6.	 End the document:
\end{document}
7.	
Compile the document, and take a look:
The golden ratio
The symbol for the golden ratio is the Greek letter ϕ. Its value is the positive
solution of x2 −x −1 = 0. It can be calculated to:
ϕ = 1 +
√
5
2
= 1.618 . . .

Chapter 10
259
How it works...
Math is differently written compared to normal text. For example, letters are printed in italic 
font to distinguish variables from normal text. That's why we need to tell LaTeX when the so-
called math mode starts and when it ends, even for a single symbol.
Math styles
There are two basic styles:
f
f
Inline math: A formula is embedded within normal text. Write it this way:
text \( formula \) more text
f
f
Displayed math: If the formula should be emphasized, or if it's so big that it's more 
readable in its own paragraph, use square brackets instead of parentheses, to center 
it with space before and after:
\[ formula \]
Such a displayed formula will be centered, and there's space before and after 
it. There should not be empty lines in the code before or after, as it would add 
paragraph breaks.
There's the older TeX syntax $ ... $ for inline math, which works in LaTeX 
as well. It's shorter and still popular. However, the also existing TeX syntax 
$$ ... $$ for displayed math should not be used as the vertical spacing 
would not be consistent with LaTeX.
Greek letters
You noticed the Greek letter phi (φ) in the preceding formula. Generally, the command for a 
Greek letter is like its name with a backslash. So there are \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, 
and so on, for lowercase Greek letters, and \Gamma, \Delta, and so on, for uppercase Greek 
letters. For individual Greek letters, which look like Latin letters, there's no standard command 
as we could simply type them directly.
Math symbols
Mathematicians are ingenious. They invented a lot of math symbols, such as for operations 
and relations. Generations of mathematicians have used LaTeX, so nearly any math symbol 
we can think of is provided by LaTeX or an additional package, such as latexsym or 
amssymb. Load such a package as usual via the \usepackage command.

Advanced Mathematics
260
However, you need to know the command for the symbol. There's a big list of more than 5,000 
symbols. Luckily, it's sorted by topic and provides clear tables with explanations. You can open 
it on your computer by typing the texdoc symbols command in Command Prompt or visit it 
online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/symbols.
Searching in that list can be a bit time-consuming though. The detexify tool comes to the 
rescue. It's a clever online tool that takes hand-drawn symbols, such as those drawn using the 
mouse or touch screen, and gives you in return LaTeX commands that produce such a symbol. 
You can find it here: http://detexify.kirelabs.org.
Here you can see how it works on my badly hand-drawn surface integral symbol:
It shows you the LaTeX command, its expected output, and the required package. It is sorted, 
so the best match is on top, like in our test case.
Detexify is also available as an app for the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices.

Chapter 10
261
Squares and fractions
You saw further LaTeX commands in our first example:
f
f
The \sqrt{expression} command gives a square root of the expression. There's 
an optional argument for other roots. For example, type the \sqrt[3]{x} command 
to denote the third root of x.
f
f
The \frac{numerator}{denominator} command prints a fraction, with the 
numerator above the denominator, separated by a line.
Be spacey! LaTeX ignores spaces in formulas. So you can insert as many 
spaces as you like, which can improve the readability of complex formulas.
There's more...
We need a lot more for writing formulas. Let's have a quick look at some syntax.
Subscripts and superscripts
A subscript, like an index, can be attached by adding it using an underscore. For example, 
x1 can be written as x_1. A superscript, like an exponent, is attached using a caret. So, x2 is 
written x^2.
If a subscript or superscript should contain more than one character, group them by curly 
braces, such as in x_{ij} and y^{12}.
You can combine subscripts and superscripts by simply lining them up. You can nest them. 
But use curly braces to clearly group what belongs together. For example, this code shows 
different meanings just because of braces:
\[
  x^{n_1} \neq x^n_1
\]
On the left-hand side, x has an exponent n1. On the right side, x1 has an exponent n:
xn1 ̸= xn
1

Advanced Mathematics
262
Even an expression that has the same mathematical meaning can show a difference in print:
\[
  {x^2}^3 = x^{2^3}
\]
On the left-hand side, you have two exponents. On the right-hand side, one exponent has 
another exponent, which is printed in smaller size:
x23 = x23
So, you may use braces to define the actual meaning. You even have to use braces in case  
of multiple superscripts or multiple subscripts otherwise LaTeX would raise an error.
Operators
Commonly, variables are written in italics. Math functions, also called operators, are usually 
written in upright Roman letters because of their different meaning. Many operators are 
predefined, so you can use them just with a backslash, such as \lim, \sin, \cos, \log,  
\min, \max, and many more. If you notice a missing operator, you can define it yourself.  
Load the amsmath package for this, and ensure that your preamble contains this:
\usepackage{amsmath}
Then, you can define a new operator "diff" in your preamble by typing the following 
command:
\DeclareMathOperator{\diff}{diff}
You will notice that subscripts or superscripts of operators in displayed equations can be 
written below or above them, respectively. That's the case with the \lim command, for 
example. You can achieve the same for your new operator if you add a star as follows:
\DeclareMathOperator*{\diff}{diff}
We will use our own operators in one of the next recipes, Drawing commutative diagrams.

Chapter 10
263
Numbering and referencing equations
Displayed formulas can be numbered automatically for cross-referencing as follows:
1.	 Start an equation environment:
\begin{equation}
2.	 Give it a label:
  \label{parabola}
3.	 Write the formula as follows:
  y = x^2 + 1
The formulas or equations would get an automatically incremented number in 
parentheses at the right, such as (1).
4.	 End the equation environment:
\end{equation}
5.	 Now, you can reference it anywhere in the whole document by typing this:
See formula (\ref{parabola}).
Note that we wrote the parentheses ourselves. If you load the amsmath package, which 
is recommended anyway, you can use its command to print the reference together with 
parentheses:
See formula \eqref{parabola}.
To resolve references, LaTeX needs a second compiler run. The first one 
writes the label to the external .aux file so that the second run can find 
it there.
Writing multiline formulas with alignment
Now you really need to load the amsmath package, which is definitely a must-have for writing 
mathematics with LaTeX. Add this to your preamble:
\usepackage{amsmath} 
Now, you have several options.

So, your code will look similar to this:
\begin{align}
  y &= x^2 + 1 \\
  z &= 0
\end{align}
Now the equations are properly aligned at the equation sign:
y = x2 + 1
(1)
z = 0
(2)
On the Internet and in old documents, you still can see the 
eqnarray environment for such a purpose. Don't use it as the 
spacing around the relation sign would be wrong, compared to 
simple equations.
Centering a block of equations
It's a bit simpler than the preceding example:
f
f
Use the gather environment
f
f
Break lines by using \\

Chapter 10
265
So, your code will now look similar to this:
\begin{gather}
  y = x^2 + 1 \\
  z = 0
\end{gather}
Now the lines are aligned with each other.
Adjusting numbering
The equation, align, gather, and further amsmath environments are numbered by 
default. You can switch off the numbering by using their starred versions, such as equation* 
(\[ ... \] in standard LaTeX), align*, gather*, and so on.
Instead, you can suppress numbering for specific lines by adding the \nonumber command 
at the end of a line:
\begin{gather}
  y = x^2 + 1 \nonumber \\
  z = 0
\end{gather}
As written before, you can add labels for referencing in each line you want. Note though that 
having a number as tag is only meaningful when you also add a reference to it. Tags are for 
referencing, not for counting.
Instead of having numbers, you can set your own tags, such as (*), by 
inserting the \tag{*} command on a formula line.
The package mathtools helps in this regard. It shows equation numbers and tags only if 
there's a reference by the \eqref or \refeq commands (the mathtools package reference 
command version). Activate it by using this code:
\usepackage{mathtools}
\mathtoolsset{showonlyrefs,showmanualtags}
This package offers much more, which you can see in the next recipe.

Fine-tuning math formulas
Though LaTeX's typesetting of formulas is usually excellent, there are situations when the 
layout can require improvement. This recipe shows quick fixes.
Getting ready
Let's have a look at misalignment and spacing, issues with subscript and superscript that can 
easily occur: 
1.	 Open the following sample document with your LaTeX editor. You can take it from the 
code archive provided with the book or copy and paste from the e-book:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{dsfont}
\begin{document}
\[
  \lim_{n\to\infty} \sup_{x\in\mathds{R}} f_n(x^2)
    < n \Big(\sum_{x\in\mathds{R}, n\in\mathds{N}}
    \big| f_n(x^2) \big| \Big)
\]
\end{document}
2.	 Compile, and take a look at the formula:
lim
n→∞sup
x∈R
fn(x2) < n


x∈R,n∈N
fn(x2)


Although the LaTeX code is fine, you will notice that several points should be improved:
f
f
The subscripts below the operators on the left-hand side of the equation are vertically 
misaligned
f
f
The wide space around the sum symbol doesn't look good
f
f
The exponent 2 is a bit higher than the parentheses
We will fix this now.

Chapter 10
267
How to do it...
The mathtools package offers a lot of improvements and tools for writing math. It is a 
recommended companion to the amsmath package. Here's how you can use it:
1.	 Add the command \usepackage{mathtools} to the preamble.
2.	 Write the \adjustlimits command right before the \lim operator.
3.	 Insert \smashoperator{ before the \sum and write the argument closing brace } 
after the subscript.
4.	 Change x^2 to \cramped{x^2} to slightly lower the exponent, at both places. Now, 
your formula reads like this:
\[
  \adjustlimits\lim_{n\to\infty} \sup_{x\in\mathds{R}}
    f_n(\cramped{x^2})
    < n \Big( \smashoperator{\sum_{x\in\mathds{R},
    n\in\mathds{N}}}
    \big\lvert f_n(\cramped{x^2}) \big\rvert \Big)
\]
5.	 Compile, take a look, and compare the output with that of with the original formula:
lim
n→∞
sup
x∈R
fn(x2) < n
 
x∈R,n∈N
fn(x2)


How it works...
When you just load the mathtools package, it implicitly loads the amsmath package as well. 
It fixes known amsmath errors. The amsmath package is very static, which is one reason why 
the mathtools package has been created. It provides further tools that have been collected 
over years, written by various authors for tweaking the math layout.
Some of the tools we have just used, such as:
f
f
\adjustlimits: This command aligns the limits of two consecutive operators. 
They are actually arguments. While you can simply write it right in front of the two 
operators, it has this exact syntax:
\adjustlimits{operator1}_{limit1} {operator2}_{limit2}
f
f
\smashoperator: This command ignores the width of subscript and superscript.
f
f
\cramped: This command forces a compact TeX style. This way, exponents will 
placed a bit lower than default. This is especially useful for inline math, to avoid 
undesired stretching of line spacing.

Automatic line-breaking in equations
Usually, we pay particular attention to formula design. In case of multiline formulas, we 
manually choose the best break point and where to align things. But imagine a long chain 
of calculations, such as in proofs or in math homework. It would be great if TeX could wrap 
displayed formulas as it does in case of normal text. And it's possible.
How to do it...
The breqn package is designed for exactly this purpose. This recipe will demonstrate it. We 
will use the beamer class because seminar slides are usually limited in terms of space. Follow 
these steps:
1.	 Specify the document class:
\documentclass[12pt]{beamer}
2.	 As the beamer class uses sans-serif math font by default, we switch to the serif math 
font as in standard documents:
\usefonttheme[onlymath]{serif}
3.	 Load the breqn package:
\usepackage{breqn}
4.	 Start the document, and begin a frame:
\begin{document}
\begin{frame}
5.	 Write your math formula, without paragraph breaks and without space, just as you 
would do with simple math. You can use line breaks in the editor, but you don't need 
to. The important point is: use a dmath* environment.
\begin{dmath*}
  \left( \frac{f}{g} \right)^\prime(x)
    = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0}
      \left( \frac{1}{ g(x+h) g(x) } \right)
      \left[
             \frac{ f(x+h) - f(x) }{h} g(x)
            -\frac{ g(x+h) - g(x) }{h} f(x)
      \right]
    = \frac{f^\prime(x)g(x)-f(x)g^\prime(x)}{g^2(x)}
  \end{dmath*}

Chapter 10
269
6.	 End the frame and the document:
\end{frame}
\end{document}
7.	
Compile, and take a look:
f

′
(x) = lim
h→0

g(x + h)g(x)
 f(x + h) −f(x)

g(x)
−g(x + h) −g(x)
h
f(x)

= f ′(x)g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g2(x)
How it works....
The primary feature of the breqn package is dealing with overlong displayed formulas. When 
a formula is too wide, it will be broken automatically with a suitable break point. The following 
lines will be indented. Usually, they will start with a relation symbol.
A great implicit feature is supporting automatically sized delimiters across line breaks. This 
means the commands \left and \right together with a delimiter such as a parenthesis. 
Classic multiline math environments, such as align and gather, would bring an error if 
there's one on a line but the counterpart on another line. Usual fixes are inserting the  
\right. and \left. commands, which produce an invisible delimiter, but then it's not 
guaranteed that the measured height of both lines would be equal. So you could end up  
with delimiter pairs of different size or doing it manually by using the \big, \Big, \bigg,  
or \Bigg operators. The breqn package fixes this for you.
You could give the breqn package a try, even if it's for specific cases only, such as the \left 
and \right issues.
Besides that, it can really speed up writings such as math homework and proofs with a lot of 
longish calculations.
The package authors recommended to load breqn after all other math 
related packages, such as amsmath, amssymb, mathpazo, or mathptmx. 
So, for example, breqn detects and uses options provided to amsmath, 
such as leqn and fleqn. A good rule of thumb is: load sophisticated or 
late developed packages late. But in case of problems, its worth a try to 
change loading order.

Highlighting in a formula
In a complex formula or equation, it can be useful to emphasize a specific part. We can 
achieve this, for example, through highlighting by color or by framing. This is especially useful 
in presentations, where we could change the highlighted area from frame to frame while 
explaining.
We will take the challenge to work on more than simple basic math. So we can verify that the 
method works in arbitrary situations. So our original material will be the amsmath matrices. 
We will illustrate a matrix transposition by highlighting submatrices and drawing arrows.
How to do it...
We will use TikZ for this. Such a big graphics package may seem to be a bit heavy for such a 
purpose at first. But it provides us with consistent styles and allows us to do nearly anything 
graphically.
Let's do an example step by step:
1.	 Start with a document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the amsmath package, so we can write matrices:
\usepackage{amsmath}
3.	 Load the tikz package:
\usepackage{tikz}
4.	 In addition, load the fit library, which we will use for auto-fitting to nodes:
\usetikzlibrary{fit}
5.	 Define a macro for adding overlays:
\newcommand{\overlay}[2][]{\tikz[overlay,
  remember picture, #1]{#2}}
6.	 Declare a style that shall be applied for a highlighted area:
\tikzset{
  highlighted/.style = { draw, thick, rectangle,
                         rounded corners, inner sep = 0pt,
                         fill = red!15, fill opacity = 0.5
                       }
}

Chapter 10
271
7.	
Define a command for highlighting an area. The area shall be rectangular and fit 
around nodes with the names left and right. The preceding style will be applied. A 
name as argument will be stored as the name for this area for later referencing.
\newcommand{\highlight}[1]{%
  \overlay{
    \node [fit = (left.north west) (right.south east),
           highlighted] (#1) {}; }
}
8.	 Define another command that prints text as a node and flags it with a name:
\newcommand{\flag}[2]{\overlay[baseline=(#1.base)]
  {\node (#1) {$#2$};}}
9.	 After those preparations, begin with your document:
\begin{document}
10.	 Open an equation:
\[
11.	 Write a matrix using the pmatrix environment of the amsmath package. In any cell 
which shall be flagged for later use, use the command \flag{name}{content} for 
the content.
  M = \begin{pmatrix}
    \flag{left}{1} & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
    6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
    11 & \flag{before}{12} & \flag{right}{13} & 14 & 15 \\
    16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20
  \end{pmatrix}
12.	Add the first highlighting to a sub matrix and give it the name N:
  \highlight{N}
13.	Add some horizontal space. Write the transposed matrix with desired flags. Again, 
highlight the interesting part, which is the transposed submatrix. We choose the 
name NT. Then end the equation.
  \qquad
  M^T = \begin{pmatrix}
    \flag{left}{1} & 6 & 11 & 16 \\
    2 & 7 & \flag{after}{12} & 17 \\
    3 & 8 & \flag{right}{13} & 18 \\

Advanced Mathematics
272
    4 & 9 & 14 & 19 \\
    5 & 10 & 15 & 20
  \end{pmatrix}
  \highlight{NT}
\]
14.	 Now we will add further bells and whistles. Start our \overlay macro:
\overlay{
15.	Draw a thick, red, dotted line between interesting nodes, which we flagged previously 
using the names before and after:
  \draw[->, thick, red, dotted] (before) -- (after);
16.	 Draw another such line, this time dashed, between our submatrices:
  \draw[->, thick, red, dashed] (N) -- (NT)
   node [pos=0.68, above] {Transpose};
17.	 Add labels to the sub matrices, and then add the closing brace for the \overlay 
command:
  \node[above of = N ] { $N$   };
  \node[above of = NT] { $N^T$ };
}
18.	End the document:
\end{document}
19.	Compile the document twice. After the second run, our result is as follows:
M =




1

How it works...
The key is the small \overlay macro, which is used this way:
\overlay[options]{drawing commands}
It creates a TikZ picture with three properties:
f
f
The overlay option ensures that the bounding box of the current picture remains 
unchanged. It's like drawing but without requiring space.
f
f
The remember picture option lets TikZ remember the position of the current 
picture. It writes that value into the .aux file. Using the value from the .aux file is the 
reason why a second run may be required for correct positioning.
f
f
The third property is determined by the optional argument of the \overlay 
command, which is denoted by #1 and is empty by default. This allows adding 
options.
Our next key command is the \flag macro:
\flag{name}{content}
It prints the content while flagging it with a certain name. Internally, it calls the \overlay 
macro. It adds the option baseline=(#1.base), whose achievement is that the baseline of 
the generated node will be the baseline of the content, not the center.
We come to the highlighting. At first, we used the \tikzset command to declare a global 
style with the name highlighted. We chose the form of a rounded rectangle and added 
color and transparency. You could freely customize this style using colors, shapes, shadings, 
and more, whatever TikZ provides.
The command \highlight{name} again uses the \overlay macro to add our style to an 
area. It requires that we already flag two positions using the names left and right. It uses 
TikZ's fit feature to calculate a rectangular area which exactly fits to the given positions. In our 
case, these are the top-left corner (north-west of the left node) and the bottom-right corner 
(south-east of the right node).
After we added any flags we wanted, we created another overlay with some drawing 
commands. We can use any TikZ drawing command together with the names we defined using 
the \flag command. So we added arrows and labels to the drawing.
We did a lot at once in this recipe. We colored areas, and we added labels and arrows, 
relatively positioned to the content. Once we have those sophisticated small macros in our 
document, we can add such flags in text, math, lists, tables, drawings, and anywhere we like. 
This allows us to freely draw over our document, independent of the underlying layout.

Advanced Mathematics
274
There's more...
The tikzmark package has basically the same approach and can be used in a similar way. 
We took the direct way for maximum control though you may consider using that package.
If you don't need something very fancy, there are basic commands such as \textcolor for 
coloring and \boxed in the amsmath package. The empheq package is another option for 
emphasizing equations or parts of them. As usual, you can check out their documentation by 
typing the texdoc command in Command Prompt or by visiting http://texdoc.net.
The same applies to TikZ, of course; type the texdoc tikz command in Command 
Prompt or visit http://texdoc.net/pkg/tikz. The web site http://texample.net, 
maintained by me, contains similar examples like this recipe and hundreds more of graphical 
examples.
Stating definitions and theorems
Strictly structured math documents often contain certain numbered textual elements, which 
can be definitions, theorems, lemmas, examples remarks, and so on. Numbering is mainly 
for cross-referencing. Such structuring is especially the case in self-contained scientific works 
such as theses.
As a sample application, we will create a definition, a theorem with a proof, a lemma, and an 
additional note. All shall be automatically numbered for cross-referencing. Just for fun, we will 
apply it to school geometry: the theorem of Pythagoras.
Actually, this recipe is of pretty universal use: you can create numbered, 
named environments, ready for cross-referencing, whatever it shall 
contain at the end.
How to do it...
We continue using the amsmath package, with a special part of it, the amsthm package  
as follows:
1.	 As usual, start with a document class. For our recipe, the article class is sufficient.
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the packages amsmath and amsthm:
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsthm}

Chapter 10
275
3.	 Define a theorem environment with the internal name thm, printing Theorem in the 
document:
\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}
4.	 Do the same for the lem package as Lemma environment:
\newtheorem{lem}{Lemma}
5.	 Switch the theorem style to definition:
\theoremstyle{definition}
6.	 Define a definition environment with the internal name dfn, printing Definition:
\newtheorem{dfn}{Definition}
7.	
Switch the theorem style to remark:
\theoremstyle{remark}
8.	 Define an unnumbered environment for notes by inserting a star:
\newtheorem*{note}{Note}
9.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
10.	 Write up a definition:
\begin{dfn}
  The longest side of a triangle with a right angle
  is called the \emph{hypotenuse}.
\end{dfn}
11.	 Add a note:
\begin{note}
  The other sides are called \emph{catheti},
  or \emph{legs}.
\end{note}
12.	Write a theorem. Give it the optional name Pythagoras. Insert a label for cross-
referencing:
\begin{thm}[Pythagoras]
  \label{pythagoras}
  In any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse
  equals the sum of the squares of the other sides.
\end{thm}

Advanced Mathematics
276
13.	Continue with the proof. We keep it short here. Let's have a cross-reference to a later 
written lemma:
\begin{proof}
  The proof has been given in Euclid's Elements,
  Book 1, Proposition 47. Refer to it for details.
  The converse is also true, see lemma \ref{converse}.
\end{proof}
14.	 Add a lemma with an internal label:
\begin{lem}
  \label{converse}
  For any three positive numbers \(x\), \(y\),
  and \(z\) with \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\), there is a
  triangle with side lengths \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\).
  Such triangle has a right angle, and the hypotenuse
  has the length \(z\).
\end{lem}
15.	Add another note. Refer to the theorem of Pythagoras:
\begin{note}
  This is the converse of theorem \ref{pythagoras}.
\end{note}
16.	 End the document:
\end{document}
17.	 Compile twice to get the cross-references right. Examine how our environments are 
printed:
Deﬁnition 1. The longest side of a triangle with a right angle is called the
hypotenuse.
Note. The other sides are called catheti, or legs.
Theorem 1 (Pythagoras). In any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse
equals the sum of the squares of the other sides.
Proof. The proof has been given in Euclid’s Elements, Book 1, Proposition 47.
Refer to it for details. The converse is also true, see lemma 1.
Lemma 1. For any three positive numbers x, y, and z with x2 + y2 = z2, there
is a triangle with side lengths x, y and z. Such triangle has a right angle, and
the hypotenuse has the length z.
Note. This is the converse of theorem 1.

Chapter 10
277
How it works...
The amsthm package provides the \newtheorem command, which creates an environment 
for us. Its special property is that it has a counter which is automatically increased, usable 
for cross-referencing if we would provide a label. Furthermore, notation and body text get a 
formatting as you can see in the output:
f
f
The default style is plain. The label is printed in bold, the optional name in 
parenthesis in normal upright font, and the body text in italics.
f
f
The definition style generates a bold label and normal upright body text.
f
f
The note style produces an italic label and normal upright body text.
When you switch the style by using the \theoremstyle command, it becomes valid for the 
following \newtheorem definitions.
You can choose a suitable name for the environment. Note, that the name should not be 
already used by TeX or LaTeX. So, the \newtheorem{def}{Definition} command would 
not work as \def is already a command.
We can insert cross-references as usual: insert a \label command with a name. Then you 
can use the \ref command anywhere to point to the number of the environment where we 
placed the label. Usually, environments that are not referenced, such as notes or corollaries, 
can be defined without numbers if you use the starred form the \newtheorem* command, 
like we did previously for notes.
The proof environment is a special predefined environment, which starts with Proof and 
automatically gets an endmark, the quod erat demonstrandum symbol.
The amsthm package provides a command, \newtheoremstyle, which takes nine 
arguments, so you can customize fonts and spacing of the environment, also specifically for 
head and body. You can find the parameters in the manual, accessible by typing the texdoc 
amsthm command in Command Prompt or online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/amsthm.  
So you can add your own designs.

Advanced Mathematics
278
There's more...
While we refer to the manual for styling the design, numbering is of fundamental importance.
Adjusting the numbering
If you have a lot of definitions, theorems, lemmas, and such, you may decide not to number all 
these things separately. That's because it feels a bit strange if theorem 5 is followed by lemma 
2. Counting all together makes look-up easier too. There's an option to use an already defined 
counter, give it in square brackets after the name. Use the following for our recipe:
\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}
\newtheorem{lem}[thm]{Lemma}
\newtheorem{dfn}[thm]{Definition}
Now, one counter is valid for theorems, lemmas, and definitions. That's the thm counter.
There's another option for numbering per sectional unit, such as per section or per chapter. 
For example, in order to count per chapter when the class supports chapter, write this:
\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[chapter]
You can do it per section as follows:
\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[section]
If you would like to begin with a number, (say, to have "1.5 Theorem" instead of "Theorem 
1.5"), insert the \swapnumbers command before the theorem definitions in your preamble.
An alternative theorem package
The ntheorem package is a good alternative to the amsthm package. Basically, it provides 
compatible styles, so the result will be similar if you load it instead of the amsthm package in 
this way:
\usepackage[amsmath,amsthm,thmmarks]{ntheorem}
An interesting property is the better placement of endmarks. When a proof ends with a 
displayed equation, the amsthm package sets the endmark not next to it but shifted a bit 
below. The ntheorem package doesn't have this issue. However, I would never end a proof 
with a formula or diagram at the end without additional work, just as I would not be silent in 
a seminar presentation after showing a final formula. A final word is always good, so I don't 
consider it as an issue.
Besides that, the ntheorem package brings its own styles and a different manner of 
customization. As expected, you can take a look at the package documentation by typing the 
texdoc ntheorem command in Command Prompt or by visiting http://texdoc.net/
pkg/ntheorem to read the package reference.

Chapter 10
279
Additional theorem tools
There's another package which adds great value, no matter whether you use the amsthm or 
ntheorem package. It's called thmtools and here is what it provides:
f
f
An automatically generated list of theorems, similar to lists of tables and figures
f
f
The ability to fully repeat a theorem statement
f
f
A key = value interface for numbering style and further properties
f
f
Support for intelligent referencing, such as automatically adding the theorem name 
to a reference
f
f
Shaded and boxed designs (implicitly using the shadethm and thmbox packages)
f
f
Even more options for tweaking design
So, for a list of theorems, simply add this to your preamble:
\usepackage{thmtools}
Later in your document, call the following command:
\listoftheorems
Compile at least twice. For our small recipe document with shared numbering, it results in this 
short list:
List of Theorems

Deﬁnition . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

You see, giving names to definitions and lemmas, like we did with the theorem, adds some 
value.

Finally, let's take a look at emphasizing by shading and boxing using the thmtools package. 
You can apply them this way:
1.	 Load the package thmtools:
\usepackage{thmtools}
2.	 Load the package xcolor so you can use color definitions:
\usepackage{xcolor}
3.	 Instead of using the \newtheorem command, use the following command with a 
color you like:
\declaretheorem[shaded={bgcolor=red!15}]{Theorem}
4.	 For definitions, take a box design instead of the \newtheorem command and use 
the following command with a color you like:
\declaretheorem[thmbox=L]{Definition}
5.	 In the body text, write your definitions as follows:
\begin{Definition}[name]
  ...
\end{Definition}
6.	 Write your theorems like this:
\begin{Theorem}[name]
  ...
\end{ Theorem}
Applied to our recipe, we get the following result:
Deﬁnition 1
The longest side of a triangle with a right angle is called the hypotenuse.
Theorem 1 (Pythagoras). In any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse
equals the sum of the squares of the other sides.
To further explore the package, take a look at the manual by typing the texdoc thmtools 
command in Command Prompt or by visiting http://texdoc.net/pkg/thmtools.

Drawing commutative diagrams
In algebra, especially in category theory, we use so-called commutative diagrams. Vertices 
denote objects such as groups or modules. Arrows represent morphisms, which are maps 
between those objects. The characteristic quality of such diagrams is that they commute. 
This means that you get the same result by composition, no matter which directed way in the 
diagram you go, as long as the start point and end point are the same.
Such diagrams are used a lot for visualizing algebraic properties. Whole proofs are done by 
chasing through such a diagram. That's why our next recipe will deal with it. We will start with 
a diagram for the first isomorphism theorem in group theory.
How to do it...
We will use the TikZ package. While we use just a few features for now, it offers a wealth of 
arrow heads and tails and useful graphic tools for positioning and labeling. Here are the steps 
you need to follow:
1.	 Start with a document class:
\documentclassarticle}
2.	 Load the tikz package:
\usepackage{tikz}
3.	 Load the matrix library of TikZ:
\usetikzlibrary{matrix}
4.	 Load the amsmath package:
\usepackage{amsmath}
5.	 Declare any operators you will need that are not defined yet:
\DeclareMathOperator{\im}{im}
6.	 Start the document and begin a TikZ picture environment:
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
7.	
Use the \matrix command. First, provide a name to it. We choose m.
    \matrix (m)

Advanced Mathematics
282
8.	 Provide options for the matrix. We declare that all nodes shall have content in math 
mode. Furthermore, we define the row and column distance.
      [
        matrix of math nodes,
        row sep    = 3em,
        column sep = 4em
      ]
9.	 The matrix content follows in curly braces, followed by a semicolon. It's just like in a 
normal tabular, array, or matrix environment. But also note that the last line 
needs a line break with the \\ symbol at the end.
    {
      G              & \im \varphi \\
      G/\ker \varphi &             \\
    };
10.	 Now we will draw the arrows. Each will be done as an edge with an arrow tip. Begin 
with a path and add the desired arrow tip as an option:
  \path[-stealth]
11.	 Draw an edge. It goes between matrix nodes, which can be addressed using the 
implicitly give name (m-row-column). Following an edge, we add a node that is used 
as label.
    (m-1-1) edge node [left] {$\pi$} (m-2-1)
12.	Draw the next edge. This time, we will use the |- operator to definitely get a 
horizontal edge:
    (m-1-1.east |- m-1-2)
      edge node [above] {$\varphi$} (m-1-2)
13.	Draw the last edge and end the path with a semicolon:
    (m-2-1) edge [dashed] node [below] {$\tilde{\varphi}$}
      (m-1-2);
14.	 End the picture and the document:
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

Chapter 10
283
15.	Compile, take a look at the diagram:
G
im ϕ
G/ ker ϕ
π
ϕ
˜ϕ
How it works....
Besides loading the packages, the basic procedure is this:
1.	 Define macros, operators, or styles.
2.	 Put all objects in a matrix.
3.	 Draw labeled arrows as edges with nodes.
As part of step 1, we just defined the operator im for the "image" of a map. The operator ker 
is already defined.
In step 2, we chose a matrix of math nodes, so all node content is in math mode. While we 
just define the spacing in rows and columns, you could define even styles for specific rows or 
columns. Refer to the TikZ manual for further possibilities.
In step 3, we made every edge an arrow. This is inherited from the path option -stealth, 
which produced an arrow with a stealth tip.
We could apply tip and tail styles for single arrows as well. Let's have a quick demonstration. 
Load the arrows.meta library:
\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta}
You can load several libraries at once by using the  
\usetikzlibrary{matrix,arrows.meta} command.

Advanced Mathematics
284
Now you have a lot of customizable styles for arrow tips, which you can use at both ends. 
There are barbs, harpoons, brackets, caps, triangles, and many more than just typical arrow 
tip styles. And you can customize them via options. The TikZ manual provides an arrow tips 
reference section. Here, we have the space for a short sample. After you load the arrows.
meta library, change the path as follows:
  \path
    (m-1-1) edge [->>] node [left] {$\pi$} (m-2-1)
    (m-1-1.east |- m-1-2)
      edge [->] node [above] {$\varphi$} (m-1-2)
    (m-2-1.east) edge [{Hooks[right,length=0.8ex]}->,
      dashed] node [below] {$\tilde{\varphi}$} (m-1-2);
The diagram now looks like this:
G
im ϕ
G/ ker ϕ
π
ϕ
˜ϕ
We gave the arrow specification as an option to each edge. While the dash (-) means 
the base edge, tail and head come before or after. So, the ->> symbol has a double head 
(commonly used for subjective maps), while the [{Hooks[right,length=0.8ex]}-> 
command starts with a hook and ends with a single arrow head, which stands for an injective 
map. Furthermore, the edge is dashed, often used to mark the unique, structure-preserving 
map that makes the diagram commute.
All this sounds all like a very elaborate science, but it's worth the effort as having this tuning 
power is better than having no choice.

Chapter 10
285
There's more...
Diagrams can become complicated. They can have more columns, more rows, and many more 
arrows and labels. In such cases, for loops and calculation options can be a relief. Look at 
this diagram:

It's used to prove the so-called five lemma. Let's see how to generate it efficiently:
1.	 Start the document similar to our previous example. In addition, load the  
calc library:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{matrix,calc}
\begin{document}
2.	 Start the picture. This time, we use the arrow options for the whole picture  
and define a label style to have labels in smaller size:
\begin{tikzpicture}[-stealth,
  label/.style = { font=\footnotesize }]
3.	 Write the matrix:
  \matrix (m) [
      matrix of math nodes,
      row sep    = 4em,
      column sep = 4em ]
  { A_0 & A_1 & A_2 & A_3 & A_4 \\
     B_0 & B_1 & B_2 & B_3 & B_4 \\ };

Advanced Mathematics
286
4.	 Now let's save our work using a for loop:
  \foreach \i in {1,...,4} {
  \path
      let \n1 = { int(\i+1) } in
        (m-1-\i) edge node [above, label] {$f_\i$}
          (m-1-\n1)
        (m-2-\i) edge node [below, label] {$f^\prime_\i$}
          (m-2-\n1)
        (m-1-\i) edge node [left, label] {$g_\i$} (m-2-\i);
  }
5.	 One arrow to go, then we end the picture and the document:
  \path (m-1-5) edge node [left, label] {$g_5$} (m-2-5);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
That's it!
The \foreach command repeats the action for the value of 1, 2, 3, 4, which is taken as loop 
variable \i here.
For each path, we calculated \n1 as \i+1, since we draw edges to the next node. We use the 
\let command, provided by the calc library. Roughly said, we can use it for numbers like so:
\path let \n1 = { formula } in … <drawing using
  number n1 somewhere>
We can also use it for points like this:
\path let \p1 = { formula } in … <drawing using the
  point p1 somewhere>
You can have several expressions in a let command. The let command is described in 
depth in the TikZ library, but you probably already got the meaning.

Plotting functions in two dimensions
Functions play an important role in mathematics. To visualize them to better understand their 
properties, so that we can see roots and extreme points, we can plot them in a coordinate 
system. In this recipe, we will see how to easily plot functions. First, let's print the polynomial 
function f(x) = x^3 - 5*x.
How to do it...
We will use the pgfplots package, which is based on PGF/TikZ. We already used it in the 
previous chapter to draw various diagrams. Now it will plot a function for us. Follow these steps:
1.	 Start with a document class. For this recipe, we decide on the standalone class, 
which is great for creating single graphics with just a small margin, but you can 
choose the article class or another one as well.
\documentclass[border=10pt]{standalone}
2.	 Load the pgfplots package:
\usepackage{pgfplots}
3.	 Start the document and open a tikzpicture environment:
\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
4.	 Begin an axis environment with centered axis lines:
    \begin{axis} [axis lines=center]
5.	 Call the plot command. As an option, use the domain or the range for x. Choose a 
thick line and smooth plotting:
      \addplot [domain=-3:3, thick, smooth] { x^3 - 5*x };
6.	 End the axis, tikzpicture, and document environments:
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

How it works...
Within a tikzpicture environment, we placed an axis environment, provided by the 
pgfplots package. The axis environment takes all options for lines, ticks, labels, grids, and 
style that apply to the coordinate system and the whole plot appearance. We will see some of 
them later on and also in the next recipe.
The \addplot command gets the function formula. It understands options specifically for the 
single plot, such as domain, number of samples, color, thickness, and other styles. You can 
have several \addplot commands within a single axis environment to get several plots in 
one drawing.
Our first function plot required a formal setup using environments, but we effectively got the 
plot using a few simple commands.
There's more...
Now that we have the basic steps for plotting, we will work out some different plotting styles.

Chapter 10
289
Adding ticks and grids
At the start of our recipe, we used classical centered axis lines. By default, though, an axis will 
be a rectangular box that contains the plot. Let's look at this. In addition, we will add a grid 
and choose the places for the axis ticks with labels.
The settings of our plots are always the same, within a tikzpicture environment, so we can 
reduce the code shown here to the relevant axis environment:
\begin{axis} [grid, xtick = {-360,-270,...,360}]
  \addplot [domain=-360:360, samples=100, thick] { sin(x) };
\end{axis}
This gives us the following result:
−360−270−180−90
0
90 180 270 360
−1
−0.5
0
0.5
1
Reducing axes
While a grid and a lot of ticks can be useful to inspect specific values of a function, an overall 
view into a function can be improved with reduced axes, maybe even shifted away a bit. 
There's a style which you can use. If you download the file at http://pgfplots.net/
media/tikzlibrarypgfplots.shift.code.tex and put it into your document folder. 
You can load this style in your preamble with the following command:
\usepgfplotslibrary{shift}

Advanced Mathematics
290
Now, just change the axis option grid to shift and you will get this:
−360 −270 −180 −90
0
90
180
270
360
−1
−0.5

While the default shift value is 10 pt, you can adjust it, such as by changing the code to 
shift=15pt.
The same library can be used in three dimensions, and we will return to this in our next recipe.
Plotting in polar coordinates
The standard axis environment is used for Cartesian coordinates. However, the pgfplots 
package also provides logarithmic axes and polar axes.
Functions can also be defined in polar coordinates. In a polar coordinate system, each point 
is determined by the distance from the origin 0 and by the angle to a reference axis. Now the 
argument of a function is expected to be an angle, and the function value is considered as the 
distance from the origin. Let's try a polar plot:
1.	 In your document preamble, add this after the \usepackage{pgfplots} 
command:
\usepgfplotslibrary{polar}

Chapter 10
291
2.	 Within a tikzpicture environment, like we just saw, write the axis with the plot 
using the polaraxis package, just hiding the axis lines this time:
\begin{polaraxis}[hide axis]
  \addplot[domain=0:180,smooth] {sin(x)};
\end{polaraxis}
3.	 Compile, and you will get a simple circle:
So the sine function, which was a wave in our preceding Cartesian coordinate plot, now looks 
like a circle in polar coordinates, demonstrating that changing the axis can give useful visual 
insights.
A complete polar plot shows angles, a radius, and a grid with circular and radial lines. The 
preceding sine circle gave a circle for 180 degrees. So if we got, let's say, a factor of 6 in the 
argument, we should get a squished circle every 30 degrees:
\documentclass[border=10pt]{standalone}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\usepgfplotslibrary{polar}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{polaraxis}
    \addplot[domain=0:360,samples=300] {sin(6*x)};
  \end{polaraxis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

Plotting in three dimensions
Functions with two arguments can be visualized in three-dimensional plots. Getting this on 
paper or into a PDF is a bit more challenging. We need a projection, a view point or angle, and 
a depth, which means that some parts will be hidden and others in the front.
At the end of the previous recipe, we plotted the function f(x) = sin(x). Now, when we add a 
dimension, we will plot f(x,y) = sin(x)*sin(y).
How to do it...
Like in the previous recipe, we will use the pgfplots package. Follow these steps:
1.	 Start with a document class. Like in the previous recipe, we use the standalone 
class. But it's fine if you choose the article class instead.
\documentclass[border=10pt]{standalone}
2.	 Load the pgfplots package:
\usepackage{pgfplots}

Chapter 10
293
3.	 Start the document, and open a tikzpicture environment:
\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
4.	 Begin an axis environment with options:
    \begin{axis} [
      title = {$f(x,y) = \sin(x)\sin(y)$},
      xtick = {0,90,...,360},
      ytick = {90,180,...,360},
      xlabel = $x$, ylabel = $y$,
      ticklabel style = {font = \scriptsize},
      grid
    ]
5.	 Call the 3D plot command. Use the surface style, specify the domain (that is, the 
range for x and y), and choose a number of samples:
      \addplot3 [surf, domain=0:360, samples=60] 
    { sin(x)*sin(y) };
6.	 End the axis, tikzpicture, and document environments:
    \end{axis}

How it works...
The basics of pgfplots and the axis environment were already explained in the previous 
recipe.
This time, we used the \addplot3 command in analogy to the \addplot command in the 
previous recipe, but now with two variables. 
The 3 in the name of \addplot3 stands for 3-dimensional. As \addplot 
already is the two-dimensional version, there's not \addplot2 command.
The \addplot3 command understands similar options. In addition, you can choose a 
3D-specific style. We chose the surf operator for a surface plot.
There's more...
We will take a look at another axis style.
Reducing axes
As promised in the previous recipe, we will apply a style for reduced and shifted axes. 
If you don't have it already, download the file at http://pgfplots.net/media/
tikzlibrarypgfplots.shift.code.tex and put it into your document folder. Load this 
style in your preamble with this command:
\usepgfplotslibrary{shift}
Now, we can use the shift style. To see a new function, we will use it with an exponential 
function. The brief but complete code shall be as follows:
\documentclass[border=10pt]{standalone}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\usepgfplotslibrary{shift}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis} [shift3d]
    \addplot3 [surf, colormap/hot2, domain = -2:2, samples = 50]
      { x/exp(x^2+y^2) };
  \end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}

The default shift value is 10 pt but you can adjust it, say by using shift3d=15pt.

dimensions.
Drawing geometry pictures
A well-known classic field of mathematics is geometry. You may know Euclidean geometry 
from school, with constructions involving compass and ruler. Math teachers may be very 
interested in drawing geometric constructions and explanations. Underlying constructions can 
help us with general drawings where we would need intersections and tangents of lines and 
circles, even if it does not look like geometry.
So, in this recipe we will remember school geometry drawings.

How to do it...
We will use the tkz-euclide package, which works on top of TikZ. As our first goal, we will 
construct an equilateral triangle. Then we will add some information. Follow these steps:
1.	 Start with a document class. It could be any one; here we can use the standalone 
class to focus on a single image.
\documentclass[border=10pt]{standalone}
2.	 Load the tkz-euclide package:
\usepackage{tkz-euclide}
3.	 Specify which geometric objects shall be supported. Let's take all available:
\usetkzobj{all}
4.	 Start the document and open a TikZ picture environment:
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
5.	 Define some starting points:
  \tkzDefPoint(0,0){A}
  \tkzDefPoint(4,1){B}
6.	 Calculate further points. Here we will take an intersection of the circle around A 
through B with the circle around B through A:
  \tkzInterCC(A,B)(B,A)
7.	
Get the calculated points and give them the names C and D:
  \tkzGetPoints{C}{D}
8.	 Now we start drawing. Draw the triangle with the corners A, B, and C:
  \tkzDrawPolygon(A,B,C)
9.	 Draw all points A, B, C, and D:
  \tkzDrawPoints(A,B,C,D)
10.	 Print labels to the points and use options for positioning:
  \tkzLabelPoints[below left](A)
  \tkzLabelPoints(B,D)
  \tkzLabelPoint[above](C){$C$}

11.	 Add the auxiliary circles of our intersection to the drawing with decent dots:
  \tkzDrawCircle[dotted](A,B)
  \tkzDrawCircle[dotted](B,A)
12.	Add markers at C and D, like done with a compass, for illustration:
  \tkzCompass[color=red, very thick](A,C)
  \tkzCompass[color=red, very thick](B,C)
  \tkzCompass[color=red, very thick](A,D)
  \tkzCompass[color=red, very thick](B,D)

How it works....
Your first thought may be: OMG! Another syntax! However, it becomes clear which command 
belongs to the package when you simply prefix it with the \tkz string. This avoids possible 
name clashes just because another package can provide a command with the same name.
Besides that, optional arguments are given in square brackets. Often you can give general 
TikZ keys and values on such an occasion, like we did with red color and for very thick lines. 
Mandatory arguments are given in curly brackets, as usual. Coordinates, named points, line 
segments, and circles are provided using parentheses.
The basic documentation of the package is available by typing the texdoc readme-tkz-
euclide.txt command in Command Prompt. When you type the texdoc tkz-euclide 
command, you will get documentation in French. Code as such is international, but without 
knowing French it will be a challenge. Besides that, the manual is an excellent reference, 
too much to repeat here. Hopefully, there will be an English version soon, accessible with 
texdoc. You may also visit http://texdoc.net and type tkz-euclide into the search 
box to see all available documentation versions.
A good general approach is:
f
f
Define points with coordinates.
f
f
Calculate further points, such as by using intersections or projections.
f
f
Draw circles, lines in points in the order you like. For example, you could draw the 
points later than lines and circles to see them on top.
f
f
Draw labels.
f
f
Optionally, use TikZ commands to add anything.
Let's take a look at the basic commands. Unlike the reference manual, to easily digest the 
syntax, we will use sample values for explanation.
Defining points
You can define points with names using coordinates and even math formulas. These are some 
commands with their explanation:
f
f
The \tkzDefPoint(1,2){P} defines a point with the name P at x coordinate 1 and 
y coordinate 2. The tkz-euclide package uses cm as a length unit.
f
f
The \tkzDefPoints{1/2/A, 4/5/B} defines the points A at (1,2) and B at (4,5). 
You can define even more points simultaneously.
f
f
You can use calculations, such as the \tkzDefPoint({2*ln(3) }, 
{sin(FPpi/2}){P} with the syntax of the fp package (texdoc fp).
f
f
You can optionally label it directly, such as by using the  
\tkzDefPoint[label=left:$P$]( (1,2){P} .

Chapter 10
299
Calculating points
For later use, you can let the tkz-euclide package calculate points at intersections.
f
f
The \tkzInterLL(A,B)(C,D) command intersects the line through the points A 
and B with the line through C and D.
f
f
The \tkzGetPoint{X} command defines a point with the name X as a result of the 
last operation, like the preceding line intersection.
f
f
The \tkzInterLC(A,B)(C,D) command intersects the line through A and B with 
the circle around C through D.
f
f
The \tkzInterCC(A,B)(C,D) command intersects the circle around A and 
through B with the circle around C through D.
f
f
The \tkzGetPoints{X}{Y} command defines points with the names X and Y as a 
result of the last operation, like for the preceding intersection.
There are further possible calculations:
f
f
The \tkzDefPointBy[translation = from A to B](X) command defines a 
point as the translation of X by the line through A and B.
f
f
The \tkzDefPointBy[rotation = center M angle 90](X) command 
rotates the point X around the center point M by 90 degrees.
f
f
The \tkzDefPointBy[rotation in rad = center M angle pi/2](X) 
command rotates the point X around the center point M by pi/2, which is in Radian 
and means 90 degrees as in the preceding point.
f
f
The \tkzDefPointBy[symmetry = center M](X) command reflects the point 
X at the point M.
f
f
The \tkzDefPointBy[reflection = over A--B](X) command reflects the 
point X at the line through A and B.
f
f
The \tkzDefPointBy[projection = onto A--B](X) command defines a 
point as the orthogonal projection from X to the line through A and B.
f
f
The \tkzDefPointBy[homothety = center M ratio 0.3](X) command 
calculates a homothety count of the point X with center point M and ratio 0.3.
f
f
The \tkzDefPointBy[inversion = center M through P](X) command 
calculates an inversion of the point X with center point M and through the point P.
Again, you can get the result of the calculation by the \tkzGetPoint command.
f
f
The \tkzDefPointsBy[operation](A,B,C) command defines point using 
operations like we just saw. The results will be called A', B', and C'.

Drawing objects
You can draw objects such as points, lines, and circles, using one of these commands:
f
f
The \tkzDrawPoint(A) command draws the point A as a filled circle.
f
f
The \tkzDrawPoints(A,B,C) command draws a list of points, here A, B, and C.
f
f
The \tkzDrawLine(A,B) command draws the line through the points A and B  
with an offset before A and after B. You can modify that offset by an option: the  
\tkzDrawLine[add=0 and 1](A,B) command starts exactly at A but adds  
1 cm after B.
f
f
The \tkzDrawLines(A,B C,D E,F) command draws lines through the points A 
and B, C and D, E and F, respectively. It understands the same offset as we just saw.
f

The \tkzDrawSegment(A,B) command draws the line segment from point A to B.

We have several options:
f

The fp package provides fixed point arithmetic with high precision
f
f
The pgfmath package belongs to the PGF/TikZ package and provides many 
functions and a good parser
f
f
LuaLaTeX is a version of LaTeX which allows programming calculation in the 
programming language Lua
Here, let's work with the pgfmath package, as we already worked with TikZ, and it's better 
documented than the other options.

Advanced Mathematics
304
How to do it...
Follow these steps:
1.	 Start a document, load the tikz package, and begin your document without 
indentation at the beginning:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\begin{document}
\noindent
2.	 In your text, use the \pgfmathparse command for calculating and the  
\pgfmathresult command for printing:
In a right-angled triangle the two shortest sides
got widths of 3 and 7, respectively. The longest side has a
width of \pgfmathparse{sqrt(3^2 + 7^2)}\pgfmathresult.
3.	 Use the \pgfmathprintnumber command for formatted printing:
The smallest angle is about \pgfmathparse{atan(3/7)}
\pgfmathprintnumber[precision=2]{\pgfmathresult} degrees.
4.	 End the document:
\end{document}
5.	 Compile, and look for the values:
In a right-angled triangle the two shortest sides got widths of 3 and 7, respec-
tively. Then, the longest side has a width of 0.0. The smallest angle is about
23.2 degrees.
How it works....
There are basically two steps:
1.	 The \pgfmathparse command does parsing and calculating.
2.	 The \pgfmathresult command prints or uses the result.
The \pgfmathprintnumber command is another way of printing the result with a desired 
precision.

Chapter 10
305
For the formula to be parsed, you can use the usual operation symbols, parentheses, and 
well-known functions, such as sqrt for square root; ln for natural logarithm; min and max; a 
lot of trigonometric functions such as sin, cos, and tan; and many more.
For details, please have a look at the pgfmath section in the PGF/TikZ manual. The next 
section shows how to get it.
If you would like to do high-precision calculations, I would switch to LuaLaTeX or to the fp 
package. The reason is that the precision of the pgfmath package is limited by TeX's internal 
capabilities. However, if you use it like it was intended, and this is for drawing, you may not 
need precisions in parts of micrometers.

Introduction
While the previous chapter was about mathematics, we now deal with other sciences, such as 
chemistry, physics, computer science, and technology such as electronics.
Most sciences heavily use mathematics, which we already covered in Chapter 10, Advanced 
Mathematics. So, this chapter will be kind of an overview, showing with specific recipes how 
LaTeX can be used in various fields.

Science and Technology
308
Typesetting an algorithm
A very fundamental topic in computer science is the concept of an algorithm. That's a set of 
operations performed step by step. The purpose can be calculations or data processing, for 
example, sorting.
Algorithms can be visualized by a flow chart, which we did in Chapter 9, Creating Graphics. In 
this recipe, we will print an algorithm using pseudocode with syntax highlighting. Our example 
will show the calculation for a point in the Mandelbrot set.
How to do it...
We will use the algorithmicx package. For a better explanation, we split the work into 
many small steps. As with all examples, you can download the complete code from http://
latex-cookbook.net, so you don't need to type it. At the end, you will see an image with 
the output. You can switch to the output image and back to the how-to, to see how we build 
the algorithm layout step by step. Here it goes:
1.	 As usual, start with a document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load packages you intend to use. In this case, we need the packages dsfont and 
mathtools:
\usepackage{dsfont}
\usepackage{mathtools}
3.	 Load these three algorithm packages:
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmicx}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}
4.	 Define the commands that you need and that are not yet provided by 
algorithmicx, in our case, a statement for local variables:
\algnewcommand{\Local}{\State\textbf{local variables: }}
5.	 Define any other macros you need. In our case, we will define a shortcut \Let 
command for repeated variable assignments. For better alignment on the left-hand 
side, we define a macro \minbox, which creates a box with a minimum width.
\newcommand{\minbox}[2]{%
  \mathmakebox[\ifdim#1<\width\width\else#1\fi]{#2}}
\newcommand{\Let}[2]{\State $ \minbox{1em}{#1} \gets #2 $}

Chapter 11
309
6.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
7.	
Open an algorithm environment:
\begin{algorithm}
8.	 Provide a caption and a label for cross-referencing:
  \caption{Mandelbrot set}
  \label{alg:mandelbrot}
9.	 Start an algorithmic environment with an option n for numbering every nth line. 
We choose 1 as this option, numbering every single line.
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
10.	 You can state requirements, if any:
    \Require{$c_x, c_y, \Sigma_{\max} \in \mathds{R},
      \quad I \in \mathds{N}, \quad i_{\max} > 0,
      \quad \Sigma_{\max} > 0$}
11.	 Write down the function name with arguments:
    \Function{mandelbrot}{$c_x, c_y, i_{\max},
              \Sigma_{\max}$}
12.	Now we use our own macro to declare local variables:
      \Local{$x, y, x^\prime, y^\prime, i, \Sigma$}
13.	We initialize local variables, using the macro we just wrote:
      \Let{x, y, i, \Sigma}{0}
14.	 We can add a comment to the line:
        \Comment{initial zero value for all}
15.	Now, we write down a while loop, which contains assignments like we just did:
      \While{$\Sigma \leq \Sigma_{\max}$
             and $i < i_{\max}$}
        \Let{x^\prime}{x^2 - y^2 + c_x}
        \Let{y^\prime}{2xy + c_y}
        \Let{m}{x^\prime}
        \Let{y}{y^\prime}
        \Let{\Sigma}{x^2 + y^2}
      \EndWhile

Science and Technology
310
16.	 Add an if … then conditional statement:
      \If{$i < i_{\max}$}
        \State \Return{$i$}
      \EndIf
17.	 Specify a return value, and end the function:
      \State\Return{0}
    \EndFunction
18.	End all open environments and the document:
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\end{document}
19.	Compile the document and take a look:
Algorithm 1 Mandelbrot set
Require: cx, cy, Σmax ∈R,
i ∈N,
imax > 0,
Σmax > 0
1: function mandelbrot(cx, cy, imax, Σmax)
2:
local variables: x, y, x′, y′, i, Σ
3:
x, y, i, Σ ←0
▷initial zero value for all
4:
while Σ ≤Σmax and i < imax do
5:
x′ ←x2 −y2 + cx
6:
y′ ←2xy + cy
7:
m ←x′
8:
y ←y′
9:
Σ ←x2 + y2
10:
end while
11:
if i < imax then
12:
return i
13:
end if
14:
return 0
15: end function

Chapter 11
311
How it works...
The algorithm environment is a wrapper that allows the algorithm to float to a good 
position, just like figures and tables. So page breaks within algorithms are avoided and pages 
can be well filled. Furthermore, it supports captions and labels for cross-referencing.
The inner algorithmic environment does the specific typesetting. It supports commands 
that are commonly used in algorithm descriptions. We already saw some example, such as 
for while loops and for conditional statements. The full set of commands is described in the 
package manual, available by typing the texdoc algorithmicx command in Command 
Prompt or online at http://texdoc.net/pkg/algorithmicx.
There's more...
There's more than the pseudocode style. You can use the algpascal layout, which supports 
Pascal language syntax and even performs block indentation automatically. The algc layout 
is the equivalent for the C language; at the time of writing, it's still unfinished.
Experienced users may define their own command sets. This, together with existing layout 
features, is described in the package manual.
Printing a code listing
Documentation may contain code samples. The same applies to theses in computer science. 
While pseudocode of algorithms was covered in the previous recipe, we now like to typeset 
real code. To save space, we will use a small "hello world" program as an example.
How to do it...
We will use the listings package, which has been designed for that purpose. Follow these 
steps:
1.	 Start with any document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the listings package:
\usepackage{listings}

Science and Technology
312
3.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Start an lstlisting environment with an option for the language:
\begin{lstlisting}[language = C++]
5.	 Continue with the code you would like to print:
// include standard input/output stream objects:
#include <iostream>
// the main method:
int main() {
  std::cout << ""Hello TeX world!"" << std::endl;
}
6.	 End the lstlisting environment and the document:
\end{lstlisting}
\end{document}
7.	
Compile the document and have a look:
// include
standard
input / output
stream
o b j e c t s :
#include <iostream>
// the main method :
int main ()
{
std : : cout << ” Hello TeX world ! ” << std : : endl ;
}
How it works...
The basic usage is simple:
1.	 Load the package.
2.	 Surround each code listing by a lstlisting environment, optionally specifying a 
language as we did.
Refer to the manual for the list of supported languages, which is still growing today. You may 
define your own language style too or find one for your favorite language on the Internet. You 
could simply ask in a forum for it. In the next and final chapter, we will visit a LaTeX Internet 
forum.

Chapter 11
313
Commands and environments of the listings package start with the \lst prefix, so there's no 
name collision with another package.
By just calling one command, you can customize the appearance of all your listings:
\lstset{key1 = value1, key2 = value2}
It's an extensive key=value interface with a lot of keys. Let's take a look at how to use it, 
taking especially useful keys.
Modify the preceding example in this way:
1.	 Add the xcolor package to your document preamble:
\usepackage{xcolor}
2.	 Load the inconsolata package for an excellent typewriter font:
\usepackage{inconsolata}
3.	 Define frequently used macros, such as for the programming language logo, for 
consistent appearance:
\newcommand{\Cpp}{C\texttt{++}}
4.	 After \usepackage{listings}, insert settings via key=value:
\lstset{
  language         = C++,
  basicstyle       = \ttfamily,
  keywordstyle     = \color{blue}\textbf,
  commentstyle     = \color{gray},
  stringstyle      = \color{green!70!black},
  stringstyle      = \color{red},
  columns          = fullflexible,
  numbers          = left,
  numberstyle      = \scriptsize\sffamily\color{gray},
  caption          = A hello world program in \Cpp,
  xleftmargin      = 0.16\textwidth,
  xrightmargin     = 0.16\textwidth,
  showstringspaces = false,
  float,
}

Science and Technology
314
5.	 Thanks to the settings, you can now use \begin{lstlisting} without arguments. 
Compile your modified example, and look at the change:
Listing 1: A hello world program in C++
// include standard input/output stream objects:
#include <iostream>
// the main method:
int main()
{
std::cout << "Hello TeX world!" << std::endl;
}
There's more...
Like the standard LaTeX verbatim environment and the \verb command, lstlisting 
also has a companion for including small pieces of code inline: the command \lstinline. 
Write it like this:
Use \lstinline!#include <iostream>! for including i/o streams.
Instead of the exclamation mark, you could use any character as delimiter, as long as it does 
not appear in the code snippet.
You can store longer listings in external files. Instead of the standard \input command,  
use this:
\lstinputlisting[options]{filename}
You can use the same options as for the lstlisting environment. For example, note this:
\lstinputlisting[firstline=4, lastline=10]{filename}
It includes only lines 4 to 10. This way, you can divide longer listings to explain them  
with normal text in between.
You can generate a list of listings with their captions using the command  
\lstlistoflistings.

Application in graph theory
In graph theory, models and drawings often consist mostly of vertices, edges, and labels. So, 
it may be possible to use a simpler language to generate a diagram of a graph.
How to do it...
The tkz-graph package offers a convenient interface. We will create a diagram with it as 
follows:
1.	 Begin with any document class:
\documentclass{standalone}
2.	 Load the tkz-graph package:
\usepackage{tkz-graph}
3.	 Specify a basic style:
\GraphInit[vstyle = Shade]
4.	 Customize element styles as desired using standard TikZ syntax:
\tikzset{
  LabelStyle/.style = { rectangle, rounded corners,
                        draw, minimum width = 2em,
                        fill = yellow!50,
                        text = red, font = \bfseries },
  VertexStyle/.append style = { inner sep=5pt,
                                font = \Large\bfseries},
  EdgeStyle/.append style = {->, bend left} }
5.	 Begin the document:
\begin{document}
6.	 Start a tikzpicture environment:
\begin{tikzpicture}
7.	
Set the distance between vertices. The default is 1 for 1 cm.
  \SetGraphUnit{5}:

Science and Technology
316
8.	 Declare a first vertex B:
  \Vertex{B}
9.	 Set a vertex A to the west (WE) and C to the east (EA):
  \WE(B){A}
  \EA(B){C}
10.	 Draw edges between the vertices:
  \Edge[label = 1](A)(B)
  \Edge[label = 2](B)(C)
  \Edge[label = 3](C)(B)
  \Edge[label = 4](B)(A)
11.	 Add loops, which are edges from a vertex to itself:
  \Loop[dist = 4cm, dir = NO, label = 5](A.west)
  \Loop[dist = 4cm, dir = SO, label = 6](C.east)
12.	Adjust the bend angle of the edges for the final two wider edges:
  \tikzset{EdgeStyle/.append style = {bend left = 50}}
  \Edge[label = 7](A)(C)
  \Edge[label = 8](C)(A)
13.	End the picture and the document:
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
14.	 Compile and have a look:

Chapter 11
317
How it works...
As with other recipes in this book, the basic procedure is:
1.	 Define styles
2.	 Position vertices
3.	 Add edges
4.	 Repeat if needed
For step 1, there are basic styles set by vstyle as we did earlier:
f
f
Empty: This gives simple vertices without circle or ball and simple lines as edges.
f
f
Classic: This gives vertices that are filled circles around the vertex label and edges 
that are simple lines.
f
f
Normal: This gives vertices that are circles and edges that are simple lines.
f
f
Art: This gives vertices that are shaded balls and edges colored in orange.
f
f
Shade: This gives vertices that are shaded balls and edges that are thick lines with 
borders.
f
f
Further variations are Simple, Hasse, Dijkstra, Welsh, and Shade Art.
They are pictured in the manual, though you could simply try the names with your diagram. 
You can open the manual by typing texdoc tkz-graph in Command Prompt, or online at 
http://texdoc.net/pkg/tkz-graph.
For step 2, there's a simple syntax for adding vertices:
<direction>(B){A}
Here, <direction> can be:
f
f
\EA for setting b to the east of A
f
f
\WE for doing that to the west
f
f
\NO for doing that to the north
f
f
\SO for doing that to the south
f
f
\NOEA, \NOWE, \SOEA, and \SOWE as combinations
For step 3, edges are done by using \Edge[options](vertex)(vertex), as we just saw. 
This together already allows quickly setting up graphs.

Science and Technology
318
There are plural command versions, making it even more compact, for example, for a set of 
vertices and a chain of edges. This is illustrated in this small example:
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tkz-graph}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[rotate=18]
  \SetGraphUnit{5}
  \GraphInit[vstyle=Normal]
  \Vertices{circle}{A,B,C,D,E}
  \Edges(A,B,C,D,E,A,D,B,E,C,A)
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
It also demonstrates the Normal style:
A

C
D
E

Writing physical quantities with units
In contrast to pure mathematics, in the natural sciences such as chemistry and physics, 
and in engineering, we use units in addition to quantities. We need to distinguish units from 
variables.
Let's take a sample. We shall write a formula that multiplies the speed s of one meter per 
second by the factor m. A straightforward way of doing this could be like so:
\( m \cdot s = m \cdot 1 m s^{-1} \)
The LaTeX standard output would be:
m · s = m · 1ms−1
What on earth? It's pretty tempting to mathematically simplify the right side, which could 
be interpreted as square meters per second or as millimeters per second. Or multiply both 
sides by s, which may mean speed (s) or seconds. Units and variables look very similar. 
Furthermore, our space between 1 and m has been lost. For smart writing that fits common 
standards, we may require the following:
f
f
Units to be written upright to distinguish them from italic math variables
f
f
There to be a small space between a quantity and a unit
f
f
The appearance to be customizable without changing formulas, such as in a case 
when a journal would require a different style
f
f
Semantic writing such as meters instead of m and seconds instead of s, which would 
be a helpful addition
f
f
Smart parsing of numbers in quantities, which may be beneficial
f
f
Striking out or highlighting would be great for explaining a calculation
Can all of this be achieved? Yes, it can!

Science and Technology

How to do it...
The siunitx package provides ways to comply with international conventions regarding unit 
systems and is customizable to match typographic styles.
Let's correct the formula we just saw and apply modifications using these steps:
1.	 Start with any document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the siunitx package:
\usepackage{siunitx}
3.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Write the formula from earlier, but this time use the command \SI{quantity}
{units} like this:
\( m \cdot s = m \cdot \SI{1}{\m\per\s} \)
5.	 End the document for now:
\end{document}
6.	 Compile, and take a look:
m · s = m · 1 m s−1
7.	
You can also use longer natural names for units. This is achieved by:
\( m \cdot s = m \cdot \SI{1}{\meter\per\second} \)
8.	 Let's modify the reciprocal units. Add to your preamble after loading siunitx:
\sisetup{per-mode = symbol}
9.	 Compile to see the difference:
m · s = m · 1 m/s

Chapter 11
321
10.	 If you would like to emphasize changes, you can do this using the cancel and color 
packages. Add them to your preamble:
\usepackage{cancel}
\usepackage{color}
11.	 Let's test this together with scientific exponential notation. So, change your formula 
line as follows:
\( m \cdot s = m \cdot
  \SI{1e-3}{\cancel\m\highlight{red}\km\per\s} \)
12.	Compile to see the latest result:
m · s = m · 1 × 10−3

m km/s
How it works...
The command \SI{quantity}{units} does two jobs:
f
f
It parses the quantity in its first argument and formats the numbers. It understands 
complex numbers and exponential notations. In the final formatting, superfluous 
spaces are removed. Large numbers consisting of many digits are grouped into 
blocks of three by a thin space.
f
f
It parses the units and typesets them in a proper way, such as with a thin space 
between the quantity and the unit.
So, actually, \SI combines two commands, which you also can use directly:
f
f
\num{numbers} parses numbers in the argument and formats them properly.
f
f
\si{units} typesets the units. For example, \si{\kilo\gram\meter\per 
\square\second} or shorter \si{\kg\m\per\square\s} gives:
kg m/s2
The package implements the basic set of SI standardized units by macros, including derived 
units. So you can type \meter and \metre, \gram, and so on, but also derived units such  
as \newton, \watt, \hertz, and many more. Even non-SI units are supported, such as  
\hour or \hectare. The package also supports common prefixes such as \kilo, \mega, 
and \micro. The full list of features is written down in the excellent manual. You can access 
it by typing the texdoc siunitx command in Command Prompt or by visiting http://
texdoc.net/pkg/siunitx.

Writing chemical formulae
Chemical formulae and equations have a different style compared to mathematical formulae 
and equations. For example:
f
f
Letters mean atomic symbols and are written upright, unlike italic math variables
f
f
Numbers are commonly used in subscripts, indicating the number of atoms
f
f
We use a lot of subscripts and superscripts, and they should be aligned properly
f
f
We need also left subscripts and superscripts
f
f
We need special symbols such as for bonds and arrows for chemical equations
With basic LaTeX, it's hard to achieve all of this. Let's find a better way.
How to do it...
We will use the chemformula package. We will boldly go ahead and type some chemical 
stuff to see how it works. The LaTeX output will follow, so you may look ahead line by line if  
you like. Let's start:
1.	 Begin with a document class of your choice, such as scrartcl of KOMA-Script:
\documentclass{scrartcl}
2.	 Load the chemformula package:
\usepackage{chemformula}
3.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 We begin with an unnumbered section to verify that formulae work in headings.  
We use the command \ch and give atoms and numbers as argument, directly, 
without _ and ^.
\section*{About \ch{Na2SO4}}
\ch{Na2SO4} is sodium sulfate.

Chapter 11
323
5.	 Also electric charges of ions are simply written without _ and ^:
It contains \ch{Na+} and \ch{SO4^2-}.
6.	 Adducts can be written with a star or a dot. Numbers can be detected as being a 
stoichiometric factor. But leave a blank as separator:
\ch{Na2SO4 * 10 H2O} is a decahydrate.
7.	
We can use chemical formulae also in math mode. So we write a displayed and 
centered equation with a forward arrow, also called reaction arrow, with ->:
\[
  \ch{Na2SO4 + 2 C -> Na2S + 2 CO2}
\]
8.	 We can have it numbered too, like math equations. This time we use an equilibrium 
arrow, generated by <=>:
\begin{equation}
  \ch{Na2SO4 + H2SO4 <=> 2 NaHSO4}
\end{equation}
9.	 If a number is on the left of an atom, it acts as a left subscript. But we can clearly 
indicate the meaning using _ and ^ before an atom, such as for isotopes:
\section*{Isotopes}
\ch{ ^{232}_{92}U140} is uranium-232.
10.	 Common bonds with one, two, or three lines are written with -, =, or +, respectively. 
We can see this in a list of hydrocarbons:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \ch{H3C-CH3} is ethane,
  \item \ch{H2C=CH2} is ethylene,
  \item \ch{H2C+CH2} is ethyne.
\end{itemize}
11.	 That's enough for now. Let's end the document:
\end{document}

Science and Technology
324
12.	Compile to see what we have done:
About Na2SO4
Na2SO4 is sodium sulfate. It contains Na+ and SO 2–
4 . Na2SO4·10 H2O is a decahydrate.
Na2SO4 + 2 C
Na2S + 2 CO2
Na2SO4 + H2SO4
2 NaHSO4

Isotopes
232
92U140 is uranium-232.
Hydrocarbons
• H3C CH3 is ethane,
• H2C CH2 is ethylene,
• H2C CH2 is ethyne.
How it works...
The input syntax is as easy as possible in the most natural way:
f
f
Atoms are typed as letters.
f
f
Numbers are written as subscript by default, indicating the number of atoms in the 
formula.
f
f
Stoichiometric numbers, which mean numbers of molecules, are written before the 
molecule with a space between.
This not only makes typing easier but also makes copy and paste from PDF or Word 
documents or from the Internet very easy. The most common bonds are written by:
f
f
- for a single bond
f
f
= for a double bond
f
f
+ for a triple bond

Chapter 11
325
Reaction arrows are as follows:
f
f
-> and <- draw simple arrows to the right or to the left
f
f
-/> and </- draw broken arrows to the right or to the left (does not react)
f
f
<-> draws a resonance arrow (arrows with tip at the left and at the right)
f
f
<> gives a right arrow at the top and a left arrow under it
f
f
<=> draws an equilibrium arrow (half of an arrow tip at each side)
f
f
<=>> draws an equilibrium arrow with tendency to the right, so the top arrow to the 
right is larger
f
f
<<=> draws an equilibrium arrow with tendency to the left, so the lower arrow to the 
left is larger
You can set math, chemical expressions, or text above or below arrows, like so:
<=>[\text{above}] [\text{below}]
There are more arrow types and features which you can read about in the package manual. As 
usual, you can open it by typing the texdoc chemformula command in Command Prompt 
or download it from http://texdoc.net/pkg/chemformula.
There's more...
The mhchem package can be used in a very similar way. There are some differences, 
explained in the chemformula manual. The newer chemformula package was intended to 
bring some improvements. Furthermore, it has been developed as part of the chemmacros 
bundle, which brings even more features for chemical notation.
There's a nearly complete list of packages for chemistry with TeX, together with descriptions, 
at http://www.mychemistry.eu/known-packages/.
There's another package list available on CTAN: http://ctan.org/topic/chemistry.
We pick another great package for our next recipe.

Drawing molecules
In the previous recipe, we already encountered formulae for molecules. Now let's see how to 
draw them. This means drawing a group of atoms and connecting them by lines of various 
kinds.
How to do it...
This rather complex seeming task becomes manageable using the chemfig package. It 
provides a compact syntax for drawing molecules. Let's draw some:
1.	 Start with any document class:
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the chemfig package:
\usepackage{chemfig}
3.	 Let's write molecules in a table. For this, we stretch the rows a bit and start a 
tabular environment with a right-aligned column and a left-aligned one.
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
4.	 For molecules, use the \chemfig command. Write atoms as letters and a single 
bond using a dash:
  Hydrogen: & \chemfig{H-H} \\
5.	 Write a double bond using an equal-to sign:
  Oxygen:   & \chemfig{O=O} \\
6.	 For a triple bond, use a tilde:
  Ethyne:   & \chemfig{H-C~C-H}
7.	
End the table, and leave some space:
\end{tabular}
\qquad

Chapter 11
327
8.	 Enclose branches in parentheses. Options can be inserted using square brackets 
separated by commas. The first option is an angle. Here you can state multiples of 
45 degrees but also arbitrary angles, which we shall see later. The second option is a 
factor for interatomic distance. We will define 0.8 for a more compact drawing. Use 
this to draw methane:
Methane: \chemfig{[,0.8]C(-[2]H)(-[4]H)(-[6]H)-H}
9.	 Finish the document:
\end{document}
10.	 Compile and take a look at the drawings:
Hydrogen:

Ethyne:

How it works...
The chemfig package internally uses TikZ for drawing. It automatically takes care of the 
bounding box, so the drawing does not overlap other text. Advanced users could even insert 
TikZ code.
The main command is \chemfig; it takes an argument consisting of the following:
f
f
Letters for atoms
f
f
Symbols for bonds, such as -, and ~ for simple, double, and triple bonds, respectively
f
f
Options in square brackets, separated by commas
f
f
Branches of atoms and bonds within parentheses
Let's have a look at the options. These are the fields:
[angle,distance factor,number of departure atom,number of arrival
atom,TikZ options]

Science and Technology
328
The angle can be one of the following:
f
f
An integer representing a multiple of 45 degrees, such as [2] for 90 degrees
f
f
An absolute angle in degrees, indicated by a double colon, such as [:60] for 60 
degrees
f
f
A relative angle in degrees, indicated by two colons, such as [::30] for 30 degrees 
in relation to the previous bond
f
f
Positive and negative numbers are allowed
The angle is automatically reduced to the range between 0 and 360 degrees.
A branch in parentheses means that you can open a path by an opening parenthesis, define it 
like we just saw, and finish it using a closing parenthesis. Then, you are at the same position 
as when you started the branch.
In complex molecules, find the longest chain and draw it. Then add the 
branches. Using relative angles allows easy rotating of the whole molecule.
There's more...
There are further features we should take a look at.
Drawing rings
Rings in molecules are often drawn as regular polygons. They can be drawn using this syntax:
atom*n*(code)
Here, n means the number of sides of the polygon, and in parentheses is the chemfig code 
which goes into the ring, written like a linear structure.
The famous benzene ring with all atoms can be drawn like this:
\chemfig{C*6((-H)-C(-H)=C(-H)-C(-H)=C(-H)-C(-H)=)}

Chapter 11
329
This line gives us the following output:
C
H
C
H
C
H
C
H
C
H
C
H
Naming molecules
You can write the name of a molecule underneath it. This is done as follows:
\chemname[distance]{\chemfig code}{name}
An optional value defines the distance to the baseline of the molecule. The default value is 
1.5 ex.
For example, this is how we put the name under the carbon skeleton of the benzene ring:
\chemname{\chemfig{*6(=-=-=-)}}{Benzene}
We get the following result:
Benzene

Science and Technology
330
Using building blocks
With LaTeX as the macro language, it's no surprise that chemfig also offers a similar 
functionality. As with the \newcommand macro, you can define submolecules for repeated 
use, like so:
\definesubmol{name}{code}
For example, here's how to define a molecule part with a carbon atom and two hydrogen 
atoms:
\definesubmol{C}{-C(-[2]H)(-[6]H)}
We can use this to draw Pentane:
\chemfig{H!C!C!C!C!C-H}
This short code generates a pretty big molecule:
H
C
H
H
C
H
H
C
H
H
C
H
H
C
H
H
H
Applying TikZ options
We can pass TikZ options to molecule drawings. \chemfig understands the two optional 
arguments are in this same line, each one is enclosed in square brackets:
\chemfig[options for tikzpicture][options for nodes]{code}
The options in the first argument are applied to the whole tikzpicture environment of the 
molecule. The options in the second argument would be added to the style of every node.
So, these options scale the whole picture and make only the nodes blue:
\chemfig[scale=1.5,transform shape][color=blue]{H-C~C-H}
These options produce thick lines and rotate the nodes by 15 degrees:
\chemfig[thick][rotate=15]{C(-[2]H)(-[4]H)(-[6]H)-H}

Chapter 11
331
This would be the output of both lines:
H
C
C
H

Using ready-drawn carbohydrates
Though chemfig makes drawing easier, writing down complex molecules can still 
be laborious if you get a lot of them, such as in lecture notes or exam sheets about 
carbohydrates. Luckily, we don't need to reinvent the wheel all the time.
The carbohydrate package provides a lot of chemfig-drawn carbohydrates for you to use. It 
contains trioses, tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses, and various models: the Fischer model (full 
and skeleton), the Haworth model, and the chain model. You can draw them as ring isomer 
and chain isomer.
You can download the package at https://github.com/cgnieder/carbohydrates. 
There you can also find the manual.
Let's have a look at how easy it becomes, for example with glucose:
\glucose[model=fischer,chain]\quad
\glucose[model={fischer=skeleton},chain]
This draws the Fischer models; the skeleton version is without showing H and C atoms:
C
O

Now let's try glucose with other models:
\glucose[model=haworth,chain]\hfill
\glucose[model=haworth,ring]\hfill
\glucose[model=chair,ring]
We get the following structures:
O
H
OH

The package manual tells you all the details about options and usage. Its author also plans  
to develop the package further.
Representing atoms
Now that we can draw molecules, how about digging deeper? Can we draw atoms? Sure!
How to do it...
We will use a package named after the famous physicist Niels Bohr. That's bohr.
1.	 Start with a document class.
\documentclass{article}
2.	 Load the bohr package:
\usepackage{bohr}

Chapter 11
333
3.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}
4.	 Use the command \bohr{number of electrons}{element name}, for 
Fluorine:
\bohr{10}{F}
5.	 We can modify the nucleus radius this way:
\setbohr{nucleus-radius=1.5em}
6.	 Now we have more space in the center for an ion symbol. This time we use the 
command with an optional argument for the number of electron shells since we need 
an empty one. We need to do that in square brackets. We will display a Sodium ion:
\bohr[3]{10}{$\mathrm{Na^+}$}
7.	
That's all for now! End the document:
\end{document}
8.	 Compile to see the result:
F
Na+
How it works...
It was quite simple. Nevertheless, I wanted to show you how easy it can be to write about 
science today.
After loading the package, we just needed this command:
\bohr[number of shells]{number of electrons}{element name}

Science and Technology
334
The command \setbohr provides a key=value interface for customization. To not stretch 
the patience of non-physicists and non-chemists, we will omit the long list of optional 
parameters. You can read all customization details in the manual, which you can open by 
typing the texdoc bohr command in Command Prompt or find online at http://texdoc.
net/pkg/bohr.
Drawing electrical circuits
Electrical documents, especially for learners, can contain a lot of formulas. So LaTeX, with 
its strengths in math typesetting, is a very good choice for writers. Electrical units are easily 
written complying with standards using the siunitx package, as we saw in a previous recipe 
in this chapter.
It seems natural to also draw circuits directly within LaTeX. In contrast to including external 
drawings, native LaTeX drawings can have annotations that perfectly match the text with font 
and styles.
So, this recipe will deal with drawing circuits. Our goal is to create a circuit with common 
electrical components such as a resistor, a diode, a capacitor, a bulb, and more.
This is just a sample illustration, so don't try building this one with real 
components at home.
How to do it...
The TikZ package provides several libraries for drawing electrical and logical circuits. We 
will choose one following the IEC norm. As usual, the code can be downloaded from the 
publisher's website or from http://latex-cookbook.net. Let's take a look at the 
following steps:
1.	 Start with a document class. For our sample, let's choose the standalone class 
which generates a PDF file matching the size of our drawing:
\documentclass[border=10pt]{standalone}
2.	 Load the tikz package:
\usepackage{tikz}
3.	 Load the circuits.ee.IEC library, which provides IEC norm symbols:
\usetikzlibrary{circuits.ee.IEC}
4.	 Start the document:
\begin{document}

Chapter 11
335
5.	 Begin a TikZ picture. Since we will provide options, add an opening square bracket:
\begin{tikzpicture}[
6.	 State the desired style as an option:
  circuit ee IEC,
7.	
Choose a width for x and y units in the drawing:
  x = 3cm, y = 2cm,
8.	 Adjust the style for annotations. Here we choose a smaller font size:
  every info/.style = {font = \scriptsize},
9.	 You can change the appearance of a symbol. The default diode is without a fill. With 
this option we can choose a diode with a black fill:
  set diode graphic = var diode IEC graphic,
10.	 Similarly for a switch contact, we will choose one with a small circle:
  set make contact graphic = var make contact IEC graphic,
11.	 We need to close the options for the TikZ picture by a square bracket:
  ]
12.	At first, we will draw six contact points, three in a row, in two rows. It's easy to use a 
for loop for this:
  \foreach \i in {1,...,3} {
    \node [contact] (lower contact \i) at (\i,0) {};
    \node [contact] (upper contact \i) at (\i,1) {};
  }
13.	As we defined the contacts having names, given in parentheses in the preceding 
code snippet, we can refer to them using upper contact 1, lower contact 3, 
and so on. So, we will connect the upper-left contact and the lower-left contact with a 
line with a diode in the middle:
  \draw (upper contact 1) to [diode] (lower contact 1);
14.	 We stated the component name as an option to the path. We can do the same for a 
capacitor:
  \draw (lower contact 2) to [capacitor] (upper contact 2);
15.	The component keys can have options. So we draw a line with a resistor, which has 
an electrical resistance of 6 ohm, with that value as an annotation:
  \draw (upper contact 1) to [resistor = {ohm = 6}]
        (upper contact 2);

Science and Technology
336
16.	 Annotations can be different. Here we use a symbol for an adjustable resistor:
  \draw (lower contact 2) to [resistor = {adjustable}]
        (lower contact 3);
17.	 We can have even more options. Useful options are near start and near end for 
positioning two components on a line:
  \draw (lower contact 1) to [
           voltage source = {near start,
                             direction info = {volt = 12}},
           inductor = {near end}]
        (lower contact 2);
18.	Let's do the same for an open contact and a battery, with some text as annotation:
  \draw (upper contact 2) to [make contact = {near start},
                              battery = {near end,
                                         info = {loaded}}]
        (upper contact 3);
19.	Let's finish with a bulb. We will make it a bit bigger than the default:
  \draw (lower contact 3) to [bulb =
          {minimum height = 0.6cm}]
        (upper contact 3);
20.	End the picture and the document:
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
21.	 Compile and have a look at the circuit:
6Ω
12V

Chapter 11
337
How it works...
The TikZ manual contains a reference of the circuit libraries with symbols and options. We 
cannot list all of them here. Basically, we did the following:
1.	 Loading the required library and define styles, either as options to the picture or 
globally via the \tikzset command.
2.	 Positioning contacts and other nodes. This can be done by pure coordinates, eased 
by a loop, or using the positioning library. The matrix of nodes parameter 
would be another option.
3.	 Drawing lines between the nodes. Use to-paths, which take components as options.
Components can have further options, such as for additional information (info above), for 
positioning (near start and near end), or color and size.
In our example, we used long names and a lot of spacing to keep the code readable. This is 
recommended especially when drawings become more complex.
You can open the TikZ manual by typing the texdoc pgfmanual or texdoc tikz 
commands in Command Prompt. You may also read it online by visiting http://texdoc.
net/pkg/tikz.
See also
While writing about science and technology is often similar to writing maths, there are packages 
supporting field-specific writing conventions. We saw some for chemistry, and the support 
package for physics is the package with the same name. As usual, you can find documentation 
at http://texdoc.net/pkg/physics and via the command texdoc physics.
Today it is exciting that we can use LaTeX for drawing scientific figures. A lot of examples are 
available. I maintain a TikZ gallery of drawings with full code, which is also sorted by the fields 
under the sciences.
So, you can look through graphics made with LaTeX by browsing the gallery:

http://texample.net/tikz/examples/area/physics/ shows about 50 
examples, such as 3D atom clusters, energy level diagrams, drawings for optics, 
mechanics, astronomy, and more

Introduction
In the early times of LaTeX, most support came from user groups, for example, installation 
disks and personal assistance. With the rise of the Internet, most information is just 
a fingertip away. There are still user groups such as TUG and DANTE behind the major 
resources, such as CTAN. But you can install updates and locate information very 
independently. Furthermore, you can get help from the TeX online communities. This chapter 
will show you how.
Exploring online LaTeX resources
There is a large number of LaTeX websites on the Internet. We have built a small guide with 
some very good starting points.

Getting Support on the Internet
340
How to do it...
We will now look at a list of Internet addresses with a short description. Click on any of them 
and explore it. It leads to deeper information and to further sites.
Software archives and catalogues
These sites work as archives and catalogue sites that help browse the vast amount  
of software:
f
f
http://www.ctan.org is the most relevant software and package archive. CTAN 
stands for Comprehensive TeX Archive Network. It provides about 5000 packages 
for TeX and LaTeX and related tools. You can browse packages by name and by topic, 
and use a site search. Most important is its hidden quality as a distribution network 
for TeX installations such as TeX Live and MiKTeX. It consists of a central server and 
mirrors servers across the whole world.
f
f
http://texcatalogue.ctan.org is a maintained catalogue of most TeX and 
LaTeX packages that can be browsed by topic, alphabetically, or in a logical hierarchy
f
f
http://www.tug.dk/FontCatalogue/ is the LaTeX Font Catalogue, which offers 
a sorted index with examples of most fonts with direct LaTeX support
User groups
The long-established user groups are also the backbone of LaTeX on the the Internet. They 
stand behind CTAN, but also have their own home pages with a lot of information. The 
following web sites are their home pages:
f
f
http://www.tug.org is the home of the international TeX User Group (TUG). Their 
website is like a portal to the TeX world.
f
f
http://uk.tug.org is the website of the UK-TUG, the UK TeX User Group. They 
also offer LaTeX courses.
f
f
http://www.dante.de is the site of the German language TeX users association, 
DANTE e.V. It has a lot of links to information in German.
f
f
http://www.latex-project.org is actually more of a developer group.  
It belongs to the team that develops the next LaTeX version, and provides  
information updates.

Chapter 12
341
Web forums and discussion groups
The sites with the most activity on the Internet are the web forums. Usenet discussion groups 
were the earliest discussion places, and they are still used today. These are some of the most 
relevant sites:
f
f
http://www.latex-community.org/ is primarily a very active and mature LaTeX 
support forum with more than 100,000 posts, categorized, tagged, and searchable. 
Questions are usually quickly answered. In addition, it maintains an article archive 
and a LaTeX news portal.
f
f
http://tex.stackexchange.com/ is a pure question and answer site, and is 
very active. There are no news updates or articles.
f
f
http://texwelt.de/ is a very active question and answer site in German.
f
f
http://www.golatex.de/ is another German web forum. It is well frequented and 
has a LaTeX wiki in addition.
f
f
comp.text.tex is a Usenet discussion group for TeX and LaTeX, accessible using a 
Usenet reader or Google Groups.
f
f
de.comp.text.tex is a German Usenet discussion group like the previous one.
Web forums can be accessed with any Internet browser, such as Firefox, Opera, Safari, or 
Internet Explorer. You can even read them on smart phones.

Frequently Asked Questions
Discussion groups, web forums, and mailing lists collect frequently recurring questions and 
put them online. If you have a question, first check there to see if it already has an answer. 
This can save time. Here is a list of sites with answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):
f
f
http://www.tex.ac.uk is the English FAQs, collected by the UK-TUG. Most topics 
are covered with links to recommended packages.

http://texdoc.net/pkg/visualfaq is a visual LaTeX FAQ. It provides a 
document with more than 100 text samples. Click on any detail marked in green and 
it will lead you to the corresponding page of the UK TeX FAQ. You will see the mouse 
cursor moving to an operator index; when a comment pops up and the link to the FAQ 
entry is shown. Now you are just one click away from a solution.

There's more...
Besides my own blog, http://texblog.net, there are many TeX and LaTeX blogs.  
Most of them are featured in the Community aggregator on http://texample.net.  
On the front page, you can see the newest posts from the blog world. Blogs and post  
extracts are archived there.
If you would prefer e-mail LaTeX support, there are various mailing lists where you can 
subscribe. I have listed collections on http://texblog.net/latex-link-archive/
mailinglists/.
Using web forums
The earliest online LaTeX support happened via Usenet and mailing lists. Today, we have 
Internet forums, which are very convenient to use.
Experienced users and experts gladly support LaTeX in forums. The reason for the existence 
of forums is not just expert chat. The majority of topics are based on users asking questions 
and readers answering them. Users' questions are the seed of forum life. So you could ask 
anything LaTeX related there and it would be very welcome. Let's see how to do this.

Chapter 12

How to do it...
As an example, we will visit the LaTeX Community forum. It has existed since January 2008, 
and had about 100,000 posts at the time this book was published. I maintain this forum, and 
I can tell you this: we love good questions!
So let's have a walk together:
1.	 With any Internet browser, visit the address http://latex-community.org. The 
top of the browser window will show a menu as follows:
2.	 Click on FORUM in the top menu or on the left of the red banner. Alternatively, you 
can visit http://latex-community.org/forum/ directly and bookmark it in your 
browser. You can now see the forum categories, such as LaTeX topics, editors, tools, 
distributions, and templates, in the following screenshot:

Getting Support on the Internet
344
3.	 Click the header of any category, such as Graphics, Figures & Tables, to see the 
forum category view:
4.	 You can click the bold topic titles to browse around, use the search field in the  
top-right corner (seen in the first screenshot of this recipe), or click the Tags  
button at the top to see the tag cloud of about a 1,000 topics.
5.	 To start a new topic, such as for posting a new question, click on the button New 
topic in the top-left corner.
How it works...
While you can freely read everything without registering on the forum, posting needs 
registration. This is only because without this the forum gets spam posts from advertisers, 
causing much deletion work for moderators. So to write posts, please register with a login 
alias name you like. The advantage of this is that you can subscribe to topics and receive  
an e-mail if your topic gets an answer.
For writing posts, an editor offers the usual formatting tools such as these:
f
f
Switching to bold or italic or to another font size or color
f
f
Quoting parts of previous posts
f
f
Formatting as numbered or bulleted lists

Adding attachments such as PDFs or log files
You also have LaTeX-specific features, such as these:
f
f
A code button that changes your code snippets to human-readable code with LaTeX 
syntax highlighting, and a link that lets you open the code with a single click in an 
online LaTeX editor, which automatically compiles your code
f
f
A button for inline LaTeX code within text
f
f
A CTAN button that makes a package name a link to the CTAN package homepage

A documentation button that makes a keyword a link to the corresponding manual on 
TeXdoc.net
f
f
Tags for assigning keywords to topics and tag filtering
f
f
Topic statuses such as "solved" so that we can filter for unsolved questions
The last-mentioned features in particular, and more shortcuts, allow users to work with LaTeX, 
CTAN, and documentation as easily as possible. This distinguishes the LaTeX forum from 
other, general forums or question and answer sites.
As I maintain the site, your question about LaTeX in that forum directly reaches me since I visit 
the forum daily and read through the new topics. I'm happy to provide support to all readers of 
this book, especially about the book's examples.
There's more...
As mentioned, another great site for getting help is the commercial question and answer  
site http://tex.stackexchange.com. I am a moderator here, and I've already explained 
this website in detail in the book LaTeX Beginner's Guide, which is also available from  
Packt Publishing.
Here are some further web forums for LaTeX:
f
f
http://texwelt.de is a question and answer site for TeX and LaTeX in German
f
f
http://golatex.de is a LaTeX web forum in German
f
f
http://texnique.fr is a young question and answer site for TeX and LaTeX  
in French
These three forums are also maintained by me, so you can reach me there too.

Framing a really good question
As I mentioned previously, I love good questions, and most forum users do too. Sometimes, I 
will spend an hour creating a TikZ drawing for a user. Others work hard to troubleshoot error 
messages or output problems. We usually have fun with it, in the case of well-framed questions.
How to do it...
Challenges make us happy, especially if they are solvable. So, questions should do  
the following:
f
f
Provide as much information as possible
f
f
State the error message text, if there is one
f
f
Format code actually as code using the syntax highlighting feature
f
f
Show your own effort if you managed to achieve something
It's also recommended that you do a forum search with good keywords before posting. A 
similar question may already have been answered.
And there's the ultimate advice to do something which is nearly a guarantee to solve every 
LaTeX problem on earth: post a minimal example. The next recipe will deal with this.
Creating a minimal example
The best way to get help from someone is by handing the problem to them on a silver platter. 
They'll have no need to ask for further details and no need to guess, and the work won't be too 
boring. Describe the problem with a code example that meets these criteria:
f
f
It should be complete, so we can try to compile it
f
f
It should actually show the problem
f
f
It should be as small as possible
This usually makes the problem easy to solve. It's handy enough for posting in a forum and the 
readers can easily try it out.
How to do it...
A good strategy is "divide and conquer". This refers to a technique of solving a problem by 
splitting it recursively into smaller problems until just simple problems remain. In our case, 
we repeatedly divide and simplify until we narrow it down, so we see the solution ourselves or 
cannot simplify it anymore, so it's ready to be shown to others.

Chapter 12

Follow these steps to isolate the cause of a problem:
1.	 Create a copy of your document. If it consists of several files, copy them all. Continue 
only on this copy, not on the original.
2.	 Remove a significant part of the document that you presume doesn't contain the 
cause of the problem. You could do this by these means:


Moving the \end{document} command upwards


Deleting lines


Commenting out lines by placing a percent sign % in front


Commenting out or removing an \include or \input command


In the case of an included file, you can do this by deleting lines or 
commenting them out, or inserting the command \endinput, which you 
can also move upwards later on
3.	 Compile the document again.


If the problem persists and it's not narrowed down as much as possible, go 
again to step 2 and remove another part.


If the problem has gone, the cause must lie in the removed part. Restore 
that part, say using the editor's undo feature, and continue doing step 2, 
removing other parts of the document and reducing the affected part.
4.	 Simplify the document further, as follows:
1.	 Remove non-relevant packages as you did in step 2 and 3 by commenting 
them out or by deleting the corresponding \usepackage line and compile 
the document again.
2.	 Remove your own macro and environment definitions if they are not relevant.
3.	 Remove images or replace them with a rectangle using the \rule{...}
{...} command or give the option demo to the graphicx package as 
follows:
\usepackage[demo]{graphicx}
4.	 Replace long sections of text with generated dummy text, for example by 
using one of the packages blindtext, lipsum, or kantlipsum.
5.	 Reduce long math formulas.
6.	 Replace a bibliography file with the filecontents* environment of the 
filecontents package. You can find an example for this at http://
latex-cookbook.net/cookbook/examples/bibliography.
5.	 Check whether the document is now simple enough or if the preceding steps need 
to be repeated. The chances are high that your isolating effort already revealed the 
solution to you. Otherwise, the reduced example is ready to be posted in a forum.

Forum regulars commonly love code problems that they can copy and paste, fix, and verify 
the solution and post the answer to. If I see a good reduced example in a forum, I gladly feel 
obliged to test it and to try to solve the issue.
Don't worry that the procedure I detailed looks like much effort. It's just the thorough 
explanation that is a bit longish. Often just a few rounds of removing and testing is sufficient.
There's more...
In the preceding section, we used a top-down approach. This is a safe way in the sense that it 
contains the problem for sure.
Alternatively, we could take a bottom-up approach: begin with a small test document and build 
it up to show the problem. Then use this as the reduced example. If you roughly know where 
the cause of the problem is, it may be easier than narrowing it down in the whole copy of the 
original document. But the challenge is to reproduce the problem. If this would not happen, 
the reduced example would not be relevant.
With the bottom-down approach, we have the same goal but need to modify the requirements 
for our new setup. The document should meet these criteria:
f
f
It should be complete, right from \documentclass down to \end{document}
f
f
It should show the problem when compiled
f
f
It should be as small as possible
f
f
It should be usable on any basic LaTeX system
Ways to achieve the last point can be as follows:
f
f
Use a standard class like article, book, or report
f
f
Avoid system-dependent settings, such as input encoding and uncommon fonts
f
f
Try loading only commonly used packages
Forum readers or other remote helpers usually don't like to install something just to test  
your code.
The mwe package is very handy for creating reduced examples. It automatically loads the 
blindtext and graphicx packages and provides several dummy images; this makes a 
minimal example elegant.
Let's have a short demonstration. Let's look at a short code snippet that shows how to wrap 
text around an image. We neither have an image file, nor do we want to type much text. We 
will follow these steps:
1.	 Load the mwe package

Chapter 12
349
2.	 Use the \blindtext command for dummy text
3.	 As an image file name, just use the example-image command.
For demonstrating these steps, we will wrap some text around an image. Use the following 
commands:
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{mwe}
\usepackage{wrapfig}
\begin{document}
\noindent
\blindtext
\begin{wrapfigure}{m}{5cm}
  \includegraphics[width=5cm]{example-image}
\end{wrapfigure}
\blindtext
\end{document}
When you compile these commands, you will get the desired images and text as follows:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Etiam lobortis facili-
sis sem. Nullam nec mi et neque pharetra sollicitudin. Praesent imperdiet mi
nec ante. Donec ullamcorper, felis non sodales commodo, lectus velit ultrices
augue, a dignissim nibh lectus placerat pede. Vivamus nunc nunc, molestie ut,
ultricies vel, semper in, velit. Ut porttitor. Praesent in sapien. Lorem ipsum
dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Duis fringilla tristique neque. Sed
interdum libero ut metus.
Pellentesque placerat.
Nam rutrum augue a leo.
Morbi sed elit sit amet ante lobortis sollicitudin. Praesent blandit blandit mau-
ris. Praesent lectus tellus, aliquet aliquam, luctus a, egestas a, turpis. Mauris
lacinia lorem sit amet ipsum. Nunc quis urna dictum turpis accumsan semper.

When class features are not relevant, a convenient way to show sample 
output is using the standalone class. It automatically crops the PDF to the 
actual content. We used this class in Chapter 10, Advanced Mathematics.
A reduced example showing the problem is almost a guarantee of a solution. Either the forum 
readers can fix it for you or you may even find the cause yourself in the reduction process.

About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book, Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective MySQL 
Management, in April 2004, and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing highly focused 
books on specific technologies and solutions.
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting and 
customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution-based books give you the 
knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using to get the job done. 
Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have seen in the past. Our 
unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information, giving you more of what 
you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern yet unique publishing company that focuses on producing quality, cutting-edge 
books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike. For more information, 
please visit our website at www.packtpub.com.
About Packt Open Source
In 2010, Packt launched two new brands, Packt Open Source and Packt Enterprise, in order to 
continue its focus on specialization. This book is part of the Packt open source brand, home 
to books published on software built around open source licenses, and offering information to 
anybody from advanced developers to budding web designers. The Open Source brand also runs 
Packt's open source Royalty Scheme, by which Packt gives a royalty to each open source project 
about whose software a book is sold.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals should 
be sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you would 
like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, then please contact us; one of our 
commissioning editors will get in touch with you.
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some 
additional reward for your expertise.
