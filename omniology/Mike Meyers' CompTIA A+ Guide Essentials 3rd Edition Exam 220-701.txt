■Acknowledgments
Scott Jernigan, my Editor in Chief at Total Seminars and boon companion on
many an evening, worked his usual magic pulling together this latest edi-
tion. My thanks, amigo!
My acquisitions editor, Tim Green, kept me on target to get this book
done. Seriously. Who else could motivate me to work on the book while on
vacation in Key West, Florida? The sun, the surf, the silliness…all dashed
away by a phone call. But I’m not bitter, just happy the book is done and Tim
will quit yelling at me.
To Chris Crayton. You went so far beyond the call of technical editor
that you should have your very own unique title, like über technical editor
king! Thank you for helping make this book happen.
To Ed Dinovo. Your contributions of words and ideas helped build this
book into a much better work than it could have been without you. Thank
you very much.
To Alec Fehl. You did an outstanding job on this new book, and it is al-
ways a pleasure working with you.
My in-house photographer and fellow geek, Michael Smyer, contrib-
uted in many ways. His gorgeous photographs grace most pages. His tire-
lessness in challenging me technically on almost every topic both irritated
and frustrated me, but the book is much better because of it. Excellent work,
Michael.
Ford Pierson, my in-house editor and illustrator, brought outrageous
wit and skill to his contributions throughout the book. Plus he has a killer in-
stinct in Counter-Strike that makes the gaming sessions all the better. Great
job, Ford.
Aaron Verber came in at the last minute with his red pen to help with
page proofs, showing a careful eye that Scott will adore. I look forward to
many more projects with you, lad.
On the McGraw-Hill side, the crew once again demonstrated why
McGraw-Hill is the best in show as a publisher. With excellent work and
even better attitude, this book went smoothly together.
Laura Stone reprised her role as developmental editor for this edition,
keeping me on my toes for every detail, fact, illustration, screen shot, and
photograph—all this while bouncing the newly born and very cute Maleah
on one knee. Laura, you’re amazing and a joy to work with. Thanks!
To the copy editors, page proofers, and layout folks—Bill McManus,
Paul Tyler, WordCo Indexing Services, Inc., Amarjeet Kumar, and all the
folks at Glyph International—superb work in every facet. Thank you for
being the best.

PREFACE
I started writing computer books for the simple reason that no one wrote the
kind of books I wanted to read. The books were either too simple (Chapter 1,
“Using Your Mouse”) or too complex (Chapter 1, “TTL Logic and Transis-
tors”), and none of them provided a motivation for me to learn the informa-
tion. I believed that there were geeky readers just like me who wanted to
know why they needed to know the information in a computer book.
Good books motivate readers to learn what they are reading. For exam-
ple, if a book discusses binary arithmetic but doesn’t explain why I need to
learn it, that’s not a good book. Tell me that understanding binary makes it
easier to understand how a CPU works or why a megabyte is different from
a million bytes—then I get excited, no matter how geeky the topic. If I don’t
have a good motivation to do something, then I’m simply not going to do it
(which explains why I haven’t jumped out of an airplane!).
In this book, I teach you why you need to understand the technology
that runs almost every modern business. You’ll learn to build and fix com-
puters, exploring every nook and cranny, and master the art of the PC tech.
In the process, you’ll gain the knowledge you need to pass the CompTIA A+
Essentials exam.
Enjoy, my fellow geek.
—Mike Meyers

The Path of the PC Tech
“Of everything I’ve learned
during my stint at Maximum
PC, one lesson reigns supreme:
The PC is what we make of it.”
—GEORGE JONES, MAXIMUM PC

how to
■Explain the importance of gaining
skill in managing and
troubleshooting PCs
■Explain the importance of
CompTIA A+ certification

CompTIA A+ Certified Technician
C
omputers have taken over the world, or at least many professions.
Everywhere you turn, a quick dig beneath the surface sawdust of
construction, the grease of auto mechanics, and the hum of medical technology
reveals one or more personal computers (PCs) working away, doing essential
jobs. Because the PC evolved from novelty item to essential science tool to
everyday object in a short period of time, there’s a huge demand for a workforce
that can build, maintain, troubleshoot, and repair PCs.

■The Importance of Skill in
Managing and Troubleshooting PCs
The people who work with computers—the Information Technology (IT)
workforce—do such varied jobs as design hardware, write computer pro-
grams that enable you to do specific jobs on the PC, and create small and large
groupings of computers—networks—so people can share computer re-
sources. IT people built the Internet, one of the most phenomenal inventions
of the 20th century. IT people maintain the millions of computers that make
up the Internet. Computer technicians (or PC techs, as those of us in the field
call each other) make up the core of the IT workforce. Without the techs, none
of the other stuff works. Getting workers with skill in building, maintaining,
troubleshooting, and fixing PCs is essential for success for every modern
business.
In the early days of the personal computer, anyone who used a PC had to
have skills as a PC tech. The PC was new, buggy, and prone to problems.
You didn’t want to rely on others to fix your PC when the inevitable prob-
lems arose. Today’s PCs are much more robust and have fewer problems,
but they’re also much more complex machines. Today’s IT industry, there-
fore, needs specialized workers who know how to make the machines run
well.
Every profession requires specialized skills. For the most part, if you
want to get or keep a job that requires those specialized skills, you need some
type of certification or license. If you want a job fixing automobiles, for ex-
ample, you get the Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) certification. If you
want to perform companies’ financial audits, you get your Certified Public
Accountant (CPA) certification.
Nearly every profession has some criteria that you must meet to show
your competence and ability to perform at a certain level. Although the way
this works varies widely from one profession to another, all of them will at
some point make you take an exam or series of exams. Passing these exams
proves that you have the necessary skills to work at a certain level in your
profession, whether you’re an aspiring plumber, teacher, barber, or lawyer.
If you successfully pass these exams, the organization that administers
those exams grants you certification. You receive some piece of paper or pin
or membership card that you can show to potential clients or employers.
This certification gives those clients or employers a level of confidence that
you can do what you say you can do. Without this certification, either you
will not find suitable work in that profession or no one will trust you to do
the work.
■The Importance of CompTIA
A+ Certification
Microcomputers were introduced in the late 1970s, and for many years PC
technicians did not have a universally recognized way to show clients or
Chapter 1: The Path of the PC Tech

employers that they know what to do under the hood of a personal com-
puter. Sure, vendor-specific certifications existed, but the only way to get
them was to get a job at an authorized warranty or repair facility first and
then get the certification. Not that there’s anything wrong with vendor-
specific training; it’s just that no single manufacturer has taken enough
market share to make IBM training, for example, something that works for
any job. (Then there is always that little detail of getting the job first before
you can be certified.…)
The software/networking side of our business has not suffered from the
same lack of certifications. Due to the dominance of certain companies at
one time or another (for example, Microsoft and Cisco), the vendor-specific
certifications have provided a great way to get and keep a job. For example,
Microsoft’s Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) and Cisco’s Cisco
Certified Internetwork Expert (CCIE) have opened the doors for many.
But what about the person who runs around all day repairing printers,
repartitioning hard drives, upgrading device drivers, and assembling sys-
tems? What about the PC hobbyists who want to be paid for their skills?
What about the folks who, because they had the audacity to show that they
knew the difference between CMOS and a command prompt, find them-
selves with a new title such as PC Support Technician or Electronic Services
Specialist? On the other hand, how about the worst title of them all: “The
Person Who Doesn’t Get a Nickel Extra but Who Fixes the Computers”?
CompTIA A+ certification fills that need.
What Is CompTIA A+ Certification?
CompTIA A+ certification is an industry-wide, vendor-neutral certification
program developed and sponsored by the Computing Technology Industry
Association (CompTIA). The CompTIA A+ certification shows that you have
a basic competence in supporting microcomputers. You achieve this certifi-
cation by taking two computer-based, multiple-choice examinations. The
tests cover what technicians should know after nine months of full-time PC
support experience. CompTIA A+ certification enjoys wide recognition
throughout the computer industry. To date, more than 800,000 technicians
have become CompTIA A+ certified, making it the most popular of all IT
certifications.
Who Is CompTIA?
CompTIA is a nonprofit industry trade association based in Oakbrook Ter-
race, Illinois. It consists of over 20,000 members in 102 countries. You’ll find
CompTIA offices in such diverse locales as Amsterdam, Dubai, Johannes-
burg, Tokyo, and São Paulo.
CompTIA provides a forum for people in these industries to network (as
in meeting people), represents the interests of its members to the govern-
ment, and provides certifications for many aspects of the computer indus-
try. CompTIA sponsors A+, Network+, Security+, and other certifications.
CompTIA works hard to watch the IT industry and constantly looks to pro-
vide new certifications to meet the ongoing demand from its membership.

other certifications you can obtain from CompTIA.

CompTIA began offering CompTIA A+ certification back in 1993. When
it debuted, the IT industry largely ignored CompTIA A+ certification. Since
that initial stutter, however, the CompTIA A+ certification has grown to be-
come the de facto requirement for entrance into the PC industry. Many com-
panies require CompTIA A+ certification for all of their PC support
technicians, and the CompTIA A+ certification is widely recognized both in
the United States and internationally. Additionally, many other certifica-
tions recognize CompTIA A+ certification and use it as credit toward their
certifications.
The Path to Other Certifications
Most IT companies—big and small—see CompTIA A+ certification as the
entry point to IT. From CompTIA A+, you have a number of certification op-
tions, depending on whether you want to focus more on hardware and op-
erating systems or move into network administration (although these aren’t
mutually exclusive goals). The following three certifications are worth seri-
ous consideration:
■
CompTIA Network+ certification
■
Microsoft Certified Professional certifications
■
Cisco certifications
CompTIA Network+ Certification
If you haven’t already taken the CompTIA Network+ certification exam,
make it your next certification. Just as CompTIA A+ certification shows you
have solid competency as a PC technician, CompTIA Network+ certification
demonstrates your skills as a network technician, including understanding
of network hardware, installation, and troubleshooting. CompTIA’s
Network+ certification is a natural step for continuing toward your
Microsoft or Cisco certifications. Take the CompTIA Network+: it’s your ob-
vious next certification.
Microsoft Certified Professional Certifications
Microsoft operating systems control a huge portion of all installed net-
works, and those networks need qualified support people to make them
run. Microsoft Certified Professional certifications are a natural next step after
the CompTIA certifications. They offer a whole slew of tracks and exams,

CompTIA A+ is the entry
point to IT, though definitely not
the only route for learning about
computers and having certifica-
tions to prove that knowledge.
Several certifications cover com-
puter literacy or digital literacy,
the phrase that means “what
every person needs to know
about computers to survive in
the 21st century.” The most pop-
ular computer literacy certifica-
tion is Certiport’s IC
3 certification
that tests on general computer
knowledge; office productivity
applications, such as Word and
PowerPoint; and Internet appli-
cations such as Web browsing
and e-mail.
CompTIA has a pre–CompTIA
A+ exam (not a certification),
called the CompTIA Strata IT
Technology exam, that’s geared
a bit more to a user preparing to
become a tech. It’s designed to
check basic knowledge levels for
people getting into IT.

ranging from simple specializations in Windows Vista to numerous
Microsoft Certified IT Professional (MCITP) certifications and beyond. You
can find more details on Microsoft’s learning Web site at www.microsoft
.com/learning/en/us/certification/cert-overview.aspx.
Cisco Certification
Let’s face it, Cisco routers pretty much run the Internet and most intranets in
the world. A router is a networking device that controls and directs the flow
of information over networks, such as e-mail messages, Web browsing, and
so on. Cisco provides five levels of certification for folks who want to show
their skills at handling Cisco products, such as the Certified Cisco Network
Associate (CCNA), plus numerous specialty certifications. See the Cisco cer-
tification Web site here for more details: www.cisco.com/web/learning/
le3/learning_career_certifications_and_learning_paths_home.html.
■How Do I Become CompTIA
A+ Certified?
You become CompTIA A+ certified, in the simplest sense, by taking and
passing two computer-based, multiple-choice exams. No prerequisites are
required for taking the CompTIA A+ certification exams (although there’s
an assumption of computer literacy, whether or not you have one of the
computer literacy certifications). There is no required training course and
no training materials to buy. You do have to pay a testing fee for each of the
two exams. You pay your testing fees, go to a local testing center, and take
the tests. You immediately know whether you have passed or failed. By
passing both exams, you become CompTIA A+ certified. There are no re-
quirements for professional experience. You do not have to go through an
authorized training center. There are no annual dues. You pass; you’re in.
That’s it. Now for the details.
The Basic Exam Structure
CompTIA names the two exams introduced in 2009 as CompTIA A+ 220-701
(Essentials) and CompTIA A+ 220-702 (Practical Application). It’s common to
refer to these two exams as the 2009 exams to differentiate them from older
CompTIA exams. Although you may take either of the two exams first, I rec-
ommend taking the Essentials followed by the Practical Application. The
Essentials exam concentrates on understanding terminology and technol-
ogy, how to do fundamental tasks such as upgrading RAM, and basic Win-
dows operating system support. The Practical Application exam builds on
the Essentials exam, concentrating on advanced configuration and
troubleshooting.
Both of the exams are extremely practical, with little or no interest in the-
ory. All questions are multiple choice or “click on the right part of the pic-
ture” questions. The following is an example of the questions you will see on
the exams:
4
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Previously, CompTIA offered
a basic exam and then a choice
of three different second exams.
CompTIA reverted to the simpler
two-exam format in 2009.

Your laser printer is printing blank pages. Which item should you
check first?
A. Printer drivers
B. Toner cartridge
C. Printer settings
D. Paper feed
The correct answer is B, the toner cartridge. You can make an argument
for any of the others, but common sense (and skill as a PC technician) tells
you to check the simplest possibility first.
The 2009 exams use a regular test format in which you answer a set num-
ber of questions and are scored based on how many correct answers you
give, rather than the adaptive format used in years past. These exams have
no more than 100 questions each. (Both exams have 100 questions each at the
time of this writing.)
Be aware that CompTIA may add new questions to the exams at any time
to keep the content fresh. The subject matter covered by the exams won’t
change, but new questions may be added periodically at random intervals.
This policy puts stronger emphasis on understanding concepts and having
solid PC-tech knowledge rather than trying to memorize specific questions and
answers that may have been on the tests in the past. Going forward, no book or
Web resource will have all the “right answers” because those answers will
change constantly. Luckily for you, however, this book does not just teach you
what steps to follow in a particular case but also explains how to be a knowl-
edgeable tech who understands why you’re doing those steps, so that when
you encounter a new problem (or test question), you can work out the answer.
Not only will this help you pass the exams, you’ll also be a better PC tech!
To keep up to date, we monitor the CompTIA A+ exams for new content
and update the special Tech Files section of the Total Seminars Web site
(www.totalsem.com) with new articles covering subjects we believe may
appear on future versions of the exams.
Windows-Centric
The CompTIA A+ exams are exclusively centered on the Microsoft Win-
dows operating systems you would expect at a workstation or home. There
are no Linux questions. There are no Macintosh OS X questions. You won’t
be asked about any version of Windows Server or Windows Mobile (used
on smartphones and PDAs). Objectives in both exams clearly focus on the
following operating systems:
■
Windows 2000 Professional
■
Windows XP Professional
■
Windows XP Home
■
Windows XP Media Center
■
Windows Vista Home
■
Windows Vista Home Premium
■
Windows Vista Business
■
Windows Vista Ultimate

Windows 7
CompTIA has the darnedest luck when it comes to the timing of new CompTIA
A+ exams compared to releases of new Windows versions. CompTIA released
the previous CompTIA A+ exams back in 2006, about four months before
Microsoft released Windows Vista. It seems that once again CompTIA is
caught missing a new operating system. Just a few months after CompTIA an-
nounced the 2009 updates to the CompTIA A+, Microsoft unveiled the next
version of Windows: Windows 7.
Assuming CompTIA stays true to form, the chances of Windows 7 mak-
ing it onto this version of the CompTIA A+ are very small. Adding Win-
dows 7 is a major undertaking that would require CompTIA to change their
clearly defined exam objectives. Don’t worry about Windows 7. Structurally
it is identical to Windows Vista. Even Microsoft has stated that Windows 7 is
“a refined version of Windows Vista.” If you know Vista, you will know
Windows 7and CompTIA isn’t going to ask you about Windows 7 until
the next update, probably around 2012.
Essentials (Exam 220–701)
The questions on the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam fit into one of six objec-
tives. The number of questions for each objective is based on the percentages
shown in Table 1.1.
The Essentials exam tests your knowledge of computer components, ex-
pecting you to be able to identify just about every common device on PCs,
including variations within device types. Here’s a list:

Essentials (Exam 220-701) Objectives and
Percentages

The Essentials exam tests your ability to install, configure, and maintain
all the standard technology involved in a personal computer. You need to be
able to install and set up a hard drive, for example, and configure devices in
Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista. You have to understand
drivers. You have to know your way around Windows and understand the
tasks involved in updating, upgrading, and installing the operating systems.
You need to know the standard diagnostic tools available in Windows—not
only so you can fix problems, but also so you can work with higher-level techs
to fix things.
You’re tested on your knowledge of computer security, including iden-
tifying, installing, and configuring security hardware and software. You
need to know security tools and diagnostic techniques for troubleshooting.
You’re not expected to know everything, just enough to be competent.
Finally, the Essentials exam puts a lot of emphasis on operational proce-
dures, such as safety and environmental issues and also communication
and professionalism. You need to know how to recycle and dispose of com-
puter gear properly. You have to understand and avoid hazardous situa-
tions. The exam tests your ability to communicate effectively with
customers and coworkers. You need to understand professional behavior
and demonstrate that you have tact, discretion, and respect for others and
their property.
This book covers the 220-701 exam, but many of the concepts and infor-
mation you’ll learn here will help you on the 220-702 exam as well. How-
ever, while there is bound to be some overlap of topics between the two
exams, there is plenty of information on the 702 exam that is not covered in
this book, so be sure to keep studying for that exam once you’re finished
with this book!
Practical Application (Exam 220-702)
The CompTIA A+ 220-702 exam covers four objectives. Table 1.2 lists the
objectives and percentages.
The Practical Application exam covers the same hardware and software
as Essentials, but with a much more hands-on approach to determining the
appropriate technology for a situation—running diagnostics and trouble-
shooting—rather than identification of hardware or operating system utili-
ties. The exam tests your knowledge of computer components and
programs so you can make informed recommendations to customers. You
need to understand how all the technology should work, know the proper
steps to figure out why something doesn’t work, and then fix it.
The first domain, Hardware, provides a stark example of the difference
in focus between the exams. Essentials talks about identifying names,

purposes, and characteristics of various devices. The Practical Application
exam, in contrast, goes into more depth, placing you in real-world scenarios
where you must decide what to do. Every sub-objective in the Hardware ob-
jective starts with “Given a scenario” and then asks you to do something.
Objective 1.1 says, for example, “Given a scenario, install, configure and
maintain personal computer components.” Objective 1.2 says, “Given a sce-
nario, detect problems, troubleshoot and repair/replace personal computer
components.” The other objectives follow suit.
Another big difference between the two exams is the treatment of the
Operating Systems and Software objective in the Essentials exam versus
Operating Systems in the Practical Application exam. Essentials tests you on
how to use Windows and how to recognize the components, features, and
basic utilities of the operating systems. The Practical Application exam goes
much deeper. You need to understand intimately how to use the command
line to manage the operating systems. You’re expected to know all sorts of
disk structures and run all the major disk management tools. Finally, the
Practical Application exam grills you on operating system recovery tools
and techniques so you can help customers get back up and running quickly.
How Do I Take the Exams?
Two companies, Prometric and Pearson VUE, administer the CompTIA A+
testing. There are thousands of Prometric and Pearson VUE testing centers
across the United States and Canada, and the rest of the world. You may
take the exams at any testing center. Both Prometric and Pearson VUE offer
complete listings online of all available testing centers. You can select the
closest training center and schedule your exams right from the comfort of
your favorite Web browser:
www.prometric.com
www.vue.com
Alternatively, in the United States and Canada, call Prometric at 800-
776-4276 or Pearson VUE at 877-551-PLUS (7587) to schedule the exams and
to locate the nearest testing center. International customers can find a list of
Prometric and Pearson VUE international contact numbers for various re-
gions of the world on CompTIA’s Web site at www.comptia.org.
You must pay for the exam when you call to schedule. Be prepared to sit
on hold for a while. Have your Social Security number (or international
equivalent) and a credit card ready when you call. Both Prometric and
Pearson VUE will be glad to invoice you, but you won’t be able to take the
exam until they receive full payment.
If you have special needs, both Prometric and Pearson VUE will accom-
modate you, although this may limit your selection of testing locations.
How Much Does the Exam Cost?
The cost of the exam depends on whether you work for a CompTIA member
or not. At this writing, the cost for non-CompTIA members is $168 (U.S.) for
each exam. International prices vary, but you can check the CompTIA Web
site for international pricing. Of course, the prices are subject to change
without notice, so always check the CompTIA Web site for current pricing.
8
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Even though the Practical
Application exam does not spe-
cifically cover operational pro-
cedures, expect some questions
about ethics, proper behavior in
the workplace, ways to commu-
nicate with customers to get the
most information in trouble-
shooting situations, and more.

Very few people pay full price for the exam. Virtually every organiza-
tion that provides CompTIA A+ training and testing also offers discount
vouchers. You buy a discount voucher and then use the voucher number in-
stead of a credit card when you schedule the exam. Vouchers are sold per
exam, so you’ll need two vouchers to take the two CompTIA A+ exams.
Total Seminars is one place to get discount vouchers. You can call Total Sem-
inars at 800-446-6004 or 281-922-4166, or get vouchers via the Web site:
www.totalsem.com. No one should ever pay full price for CompTIA A+
exams.
How to Pass the CompTIA A+ Exams
The single most important thing to remember about the CompTIA A+ certif-
ication exams is that CompTIA designed the Essentials exam to test the
knowledge of a technician with only 500 hours experience (about three
months) and the Practical Application exam to test the knowledge of a tech-
nician with only 1000 hours experience (about six months)—so keep it sim-
ple! The exams aren’t interested in your ability to overclock DDR3 CAS
timings in CMOS or whether you can explain the exact difference between
the Intel ICH10 and the AMD 790 southbridges. Don’t bother with a lot of
theory—think in terms of practical knowledge and standards. Read the
book, do whatever works for you to memorize the key concepts and proce-
dures, take the practice exams on the CD in the back of the book, review any
topics you miss, and you should pass with no problem.
Some of you may be in or just out of school, so studying for exams is
nothing novel. But if you haven’t had to study for and take an exam in a
while, or if you think maybe you could use some tips, you may find the next
section valuable. It lays out a proven strategy for preparing to take and pass
the CompTIA A+ exams. Try it. It works.
Obligate Yourself
The very first step you should take is to schedule yourself for the exams.
Have you ever heard the old adage, “Heat and pressure make diamonds”?
Well, if you don’t give yourself a little “heat,” you’ll end up procrastinating
and delay taking the exams, possibly forever. Do yourself a favor. Using the
following information, determine how much time you’ll need to study for
the exams, and then call Prometric or Pearson VUE and schedule them ac-
cordingly. Knowing the exams are coming up makes it much easier to turn
off the television and crack open the book. You can schedule an exam as lit-
tle as a few weeks in advance, but if you schedule an exam and can’t take it
at the scheduled time, you must reschedule at least a day in advance or
you’ll lose your money.
Set Aside the Right Amount of Study Time
After helping thousands of techs get their CompTIA A+ certification, we at
Total Seminars have developed a pretty good feel for the amount of study
time needed to pass the CompTIA A+ certification exams. The following
table provides an estimate to help you plan how much study time you must
commit to the CompTIA A+ certification exams. Keep in mind that these are
averages. If you’re not a great student or if you’re a little on the nervous side,
Chapter 1: The Path of the PC Tech

Those of you who just want
more knowledge in managing
and troubleshooting PCs can
follow the same strategy as
certification-seekers. Think in
practical terms and work with
the PC as you go through each
chapter.

add 10 percent; if you’re a fast learner or have a good bit of computer experi-
ence, you may want to reduce the figures.
To use Table 1.3, just circle the values that are most accurate for you and
add them up to get your estimated total hours of study time.
To that value, add hours based on the number of months of direct, pro-
fessional experience you have had supporting PCs, as shown in Table 1.4.
A total neophyte usually needs a little over 200 hours of study time. An
experienced tech shouldn’t need more than 60 hours.

Adding Up Your Study Time

A Strategy for Study
Now that you have a feel for how long it’s going to take, you’re ready to de-
velop a study strategy. I’d like to suggest a strategy that has worked for oth-
ers who’ve come before you, whether they were experienced techs or total
newbies. This book is designed to accommodate the different study agendas
of these two groups of students. The first group is experienced techs who al-
ready have strong PC experience but need to be sure they’re ready to be
tested on the specific subjects covered by the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam.
The second group is those with little or no background in the computer
field. These techs can benefit from a more detailed understanding of the his-
tory and concepts that underlie modern PC technology, to help them re-
member the specific subject matter information they must know for the
exams. I’ll use the shorthand terms Old Techs and New Techs for these two
groups. If you’re not sure which group you fall into, pick a few chapters and
go through some end-of-chapter questions. If you score less than 70%, go
the New Tech route.
I have broken most of the chapters into three distinct parts:
■
Historical/Conceptual
Topics that are not on the CompTIA A+
exams but will help you understand more clearly what is on the
CompTIA A+ exams.
■
Essentials
Topics that clearly fit under the CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam domains.
■
Beyond A+
More advanced issues that probably will not be on the
CompTIA A+ exams—yet.
The beginning of each of these areas is clearly marked with a large ban-
ner that looks like this:
Historical/Conceptual
Those of you who fall into the Old Tech group may want to skip the Historical/
Conceptual sections, since they cover information that you may already
know. After reading the other sections, jump immediately to the questions
at the end of the chapter. The end-of-chapter questions concentrate on infor-
mation in the non-Historical/Conceptual sections. If you run into problems,
review the Historical/Conceptual sections in that chapter. Note that you
may need to skip back to previous chapters to get the Historical/Conceptual
information you need for later chapters.
After going through every chapter as described, Old Techs can move di-
rectly to testing their knowledge by using the free practice exams on the CD-
ROM that accompanies the book. Once you start scoring above 90%, you’re
ready to take the exams. If you’re a New Tech—or if you’re an Old Tech who
wants the full learning experience this book can offer—start by reading the
book, the whole book, as though you were reading a novel, from page one to
the end without skipping around. Because so many computer terms and
concepts build on each other, skipping around greatly increases the odds
that you will become confused and end up closing the book and firing up
your favorite PC game. Not that I have anything against PC games, but un-
fortunately that skill is not useful for the CompTIA A+ exams!
Chapter 1: The Path of the PC Tech
11
Not all chapters will have all
three sections.

Your goal on this first read is to understand concepts, the whys behind
the hows. Having a PC nearby as you read is helpful so you can stop and in-
spect the PC to see a piece of hardware or how a particular concept mani-
fests in the real world. As you read about floppy drives, for example, inspect
the cables. Do they look like the ones in the book? Is there a variation? Why?
It is imperative that you understand why you are doing something, not just
how to do it on one particular system under one specific set of conditions.
Neither the exams nor real life as a PC tech works that way.
If you’re reading this book as part of a managing and troubleshooting
PCs class rather than a certification-prep course, I highly recommend going
the New Tech route, even if you have a decent amount of experience. The
book contains a lot of details that can trip you up if you focus only on the
test-specific sections of the chapters. Plus, your program might stress histor-
ical and conceptual knowledge as well as practical, hands-on skills.
The CompTIA A+ certification exams assume that you have basic user
skills. The exams really try to trick you with questions on processes that you
may do every day and not think much about. Here’s a classic: “To move a
file from the C:\DATA folder to the D:\ drive using Windows Explorer,
what key must you hold down while dragging the file?” If you can answer
that without going to your keyboard and trying a few likely keys, you’re
better than most techs! In the real world, you can try a few wrong answers
before you hit on the right one, but for the exams, you have to know it.
Whether Old Tech or New Tech, make sure you are proficient at user-level
Windows skills, including the following:
■
Recognizing all the components of the standard Windows desktop
(Start menu, notification area, etc.)
■
Manipulating windows—resizing, moving, and so on
■
Creating, deleting, renaming, moving, and copying files and folders
within Windows
■
Understanding file extensions and their relationship with program
associations
■
Using common keyboard shortcuts/hotkeys
■
Installing, running, and closing a Windows application
Any PC technician who has been around a while will tell you that one of
the great secrets in the computer business is that there’s almost never any-
thing completely new in the world of computer technology. Faster, cleverer,
smaller, wider—absolutely—but the underlying technology, the core of
what makes your PC and its various peripheral devices operate, has
changed remarkably little since PCs came into widespread use a few de-
cades ago. When you do your initial read-through, you may be tempted to
skip the Historical/Conceptual sections—don’t! Understanding the history
and technological developments behind today’s PCs helps you understand
why they work—or don’t work—the way they do. Basically, I’m passing on
to you the kind of knowledge you might get by apprenticing yourself to an
older, experienced PC tech.
After you’ve completed the first read-through, go through the book again,
this time in textbook mode. If you’re an Old Tech, start your studying here.
Try to cover one chapter at a sitting. Don’t focus too much on the Historical/
12
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Conceptual sections. Get a highlighter and mark the phrases and sentences
that bring out major points. Be sure you understand how the pictures and il-
lustrations relate to the concepts being discussed.
Once you feel you have a good grasp of the material in the book, you can
check your knowledge by using the practice exams included on the CD-
ROM in the back of the book. You can take these in Practice mode or Final
mode. In Practice mode, you can use the Assistance window to get a helpful
hint for the current questions, use the Reference feature to find the chapter
that covers the question, check your answer for the question, and see an ex-
planation of the correct answer. In Final mode, you answer all the questions
and receive an exam score at the end, just like the real thing.
Both modes show you an overall grade, expressed as a percentage, as
well as a breakdown of how well you did on each exam domain. The Review
Questions feature lets you see what questions you missed and what the cor-
rect answers are. Use these results to guide further studying. Continue re-
viewing the topics you miss and taking additional exams until you are
consistently scoring in the 90% range. When you get there, you are ready to
pass the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam.
Study Tactics
Perhaps it’s been a while since you had to study for a test. Or perhaps it
hasn’t, but you’ve done your best since then to block the whole experience
from your mind. Either way, savvy test-takers know that certain techniques
make studying for tests more efficient and effective.
Here’s a trick used by students in law and medical schools who have to
memorize reams of information: write it down. The act of writing something
down (not typing, writing) in and of itself helps you to remember it, even if
you never look at what you wrote again. Try taking separate notes on the
material and re-creating diagrams by hand to help solidify the information
in your mind.
Another oldie but goodie: Make yourself flash cards with questions and
answers on topics you find difficult. A third trick: Take your notes to bed
and read them just before you go to sleep. Many people find they really do
learn while they sleep!

Chapter 1 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following about
the path of the PC tech.
Explain the importance of gaining skill in managing
and troubleshooting PCs
■
The IT workforce designs, builds, and maintains
computers, computer programs, and networks. PC
techs take care of personal computers, thus
representing an essential component in that
workforce. As PCs become more complex, the IT
workforce needs specialized PC techs.
■
Certifications prove to employers that you have the
necessary skills. If you want a job fixing automobiles,
for example, you get the Automotive Service Excellence
(ASE) certification. To be certified, you take and
successfully pass exams. Then the organization that
administers those exams grants you certification. This
is particularly important for IT workers.
Explain the importance of CompTIA A+ certification
■
In the early days of the personal computer, you
could get vendor-specific certifications, such as
IBM Technician, but nothing general for PC techs.
Worse, you often had to have a job at that company
to get the vendor-specific certification. The
software and networking side of IT doesn’t have
that issue. To prove skill in working with
Windows, for example, you could become a
Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS).
■
CompTIA A+ certification is an industry-wide,
vendor-neutral certification program that shows
that you have a basic competence in supporting
microcomputers. You achieve this certification by
taking two computer-based, multiple-choice
examinations. The tests cover what technicians
should know after nine months of full-time PC
support experience. CompTIA A+ certification
enjoys wide recognition throughout the computer
industry.
■
CompTIA is a nonprofit, industry trade association
based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. It consists of over
20,000 members in 102 countries. CompTIA provides
a forum for people in these industries to network,
represents the interests of its members to the
government, and provides certifications for many
aspects of the computer industry. CompTIA sponsors
A+, Network+, Security+, and other certifications.
■
The CompTIA A+ certification is the de facto entry
point to IT. From CompTIA A+, you have a
number of certification options, depending on
whether you want to focus more on hardware and
operating systems or move into network
administration. You can get CompTIA Network+
certification, for example, or go on to get Microsoft
or Cisco certified. CompTIA Network+ certification
is the most obvious certification to get after
becoming CompTIA A+ certified.

sense, by taking and passing two computer-based,
multiple-choice exams. No prerequisites are
required for taking the CompTIA A+ certification
exams. There is no required training course and no
training materials to buy. You do have to pay a
testing fee for each of the two exams.
■
The CompTIA exams introduced in 2009 are 220-
701 (Essentials) and 220-702 (Practical Application).
It’s common to refer to these two exams as the 2009
exams to differentiate them from older CompTIA
exams. Although you may take either of the two
exams first, I recommend taking the Essentials,
followed by the Practical Application.
■
Both of the exams are extremely practical, with
little or no interest in theory. All questions are
multiple choice or “click on the right part of the
picture” questions. CompTIA may add new
questions to the exams at any time to keep the
content fresh, although the subject matter covered
by the exams won’t change.
■
Two companies, Prometric and Pearson VUE,
administer the actual CompTIA A+ testing. You
can schedule exam time and location via the Web
site for either company, www.prometric.com or

Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

■
To achieve success with the CompTIA A+
certification exams, think in terms of practical
knowledge. Read the book. Work through the
problems. Work with computers. Take the practice
exams. You should obligate yourself by scheduling
your exams. This keeps you focused on study.
■
Read the book all the way through once.
Experienced techs should then concentrate on the
test-specific sections to prepare for the exams. Less
experienced techs should read the book all the way
through again until everything makes sense.
■
If you’re reading this book as part of a managing
and troubleshooting PCs class rather than a
certification-prep course, I highly recommend
going the New Tech route, even if you have a
decent amount of experience. The book contains a
lot of details that can trip you up if you focus only
on the test-specific sections of the chapters.

O
ne of the interesting parts of teaching new techs is keeping up with the skills
that get a tech a job and the issues that cause them to lose the jobs they get.
To me, the number one reason techs fail to get or hold onto a job isn’t lack of
technical skill; it’s lack of what CompTIA calls “operational procedures.” Personally,
I think a better name might be “life skills and basic safety,” but it boils down to the
same thing: nontechnical skills that technicians are famous for lacking.
I like to describe myself as a “nerd” and I consider it a compliment if you call
me one. Nerds are smart and like to work with technologythese are the good
aspects of nerd-dom. On the other hand, most people would think of the term
nerd as an insult. Nerds are rarely portrayed in a positive manner in the media, and
I think I know why. Nerds generally suffer from some pretty serious social
weaknesses. These weaknesses are classics: bad clothing, shyness, and poor
communication skills. This chapter covers some basic life skills to enable you to
enjoy your nerdiness and yet function out in the real world. You’ll learn how to
dress, how to act, and how to communicate. After you’re well on your way to the
beginnings of social graces, we’ll discuss some of the hazards (such as static
electricity) you may run into in your job and the tools you can use to prevent
problems. After all, nerds who cannot stay organizedor who break equipment or
themselvesneed to learn some tricks to keep everything organized and safe.

■The Professional Tech
A professional tech displays professionalism, which might seem a little trite
if it weren’t absolutely true. The tech presents a professional appearance
and follows a proper ethical code. I call the latter the Traits of a Tech. Let’s
take a look at these two areas in more detail.
Appearance
Americans live in a casual society, and I think that’s great, because I prefer
dressing casually. The problem with casual is that perhaps our society is be-
coming too casual. New techs sometimes fail to appreciate that customers
equate casual clothing with a casual attitude. You might think you’re just
fixing somebody’s computer, but you’re doing much more than that. You
are saving precious family photos. You are keeping a small business in oper-
ation. This is serious stuff, and nobody wants an unclean, slovenly person
doing these important jobs. Take a look at Figure 2.1. This is our resident il-
lustrator (among other job descriptions), Ford Pierson, casually dressed to
hang with his buddies.
I have a question for you. If you ran a small business and your primary file
server died, leaving 15 employees with nothing to do, how would you feel
about Ford as a tech coming into your office looking like this? I hope your an-
swer would be “not too confident.” Every company has some form of dress
code for techs. Figure 2.2 shows Ford dressed in a fairly typical example, with
a company polo shirt, khaki pants, and dark shoes (trust me on that score).
Please also note that both his shirt and his pants are wrinkle free. All techs ei-
ther know how to iron or know the location of the nearest cleaners.
While we are looking at this model of a man, do you appreciate that his
hair is combed and his face is cleanly shaven? It’s too bad I can’t use scratch-
and-sniffs, but if I did, you’d also notice that Professional Ford took a
shower, used some deodorant, and brushed his teeth.
I hope that most of the people who read this smile quietly to themselves
and say, “Well, of course.” The sad truth tells me otherwise. Next time you look
at a tech, ask yourself how many of these simple appearance and hygiene is-
sues were missed. Then make a point not to be one of the unkempt techs.
The Traits of a Tech
When I was a Boy Scout in the United States, we learned something called
The Boy Scout Creed, a list of traits that define the ethics of a Boy Scout. Even
thought I haven’t been a Boy Scout for a long time, I still have them memo-
rized. “A Scout is trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obe-
dient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.”
My goal here isn’t a sales pitch for scouting in any form, but rather to
give you an idea of what we are trying to achieve: a list of ethics that will
help you be a better technician. The list you are about to see is my own cre-
ation, but it does a great job of covering the CompTIA A+ objectives. Let’s
Chapter 2: Operational Procedures

dive into the traits of a tech: honesty/integrity, dependability/reliability,
adaptability/versatility, and sensitivity.
Honesty/Integrity
Honesty and integrity are not the same thing, but for a tech, they are so
closely related that it is best to think of them as one big ethic. Honesty means
to tell the truth, and integrity means doing the right thing.
It’s simple to say you have to be honest, but be warned that our industry
often makes it difficult. IT technicians get a lot of leeway compared to most
starting jobs, making dishonesty tempting. One of the biggest temptations is
lying to your boss. A new tech driving around in a van all day may find it
convenient to stretch the truth on how long he took for lunch or how far
along he is on the next job. Being up front and honest with your boss is
pretty obvious and easy to understand.
Being honest with your customers is a lot harder. Don’t sell people
goods and services they don’t need, even if you get a cut of what you sell.
Don’t lie to your customers about a problem. If you can’t explain the prob-
lem to them in plain English, don’t create techno-babble (see note) and don’t
be afraid to say, “I don’t know.” Too many techs seem to think that not
knowing exactly what a problem might be is a reflection of their skill. In
your humble author’s opinion, there is no greater proof of a quality techni-
cian than the ability to say “I don’t know, but I know how to figure it out,
and I will get you the right answer.”
A computer tech must bring integrity to the job, just like any other ser-
vice professional. Anything said to you and anything you see, you should
treat as a personal confidence, not to be repeated to customers, coworkers,
or bosses. Here’s Mike’s Rule of Confidentiality: “Unless it’s a felony or an
imminent physical danger, you didn’t see nothin’.”
There is an exception to this rule. Sometimes you need to separate pay-
ing customers from in-house users. A paying customer is someone who
doesn’t work for your company, who is paying for your services. An
in-house user is someone who works for the same company you do and is
not directly paying for your services. It’s often your job (but not always) to
police in-house IT policies. Here’s a great example. If you are at a customer’s
site and you see a post-it note with a password on a user’s monitor, you say
nothing. If you are in-house and you see the same thing,
you probably need to speak to the user about the dangers
of exposing passwords.
You have a lot of power when you sit in front of some-
one’s computer. You can readily read private e-mail, dis-
cover Web sites surfed, and more. With a click of the Start
button, you can know the last five programs the user ran,
including Word and Solitaire, and the last few docu-
ments the user worked on. Don’t do this; you really don’t
want to know. Plus, if you are caught violating a cus-
tomer’s privacy, not only will you lose credibility and re-
spect, you could also lose your job.
Passwords are a big issue for techs. We have to reboot
computers and access shares and other jobs that require
passwords. The rule here is to avoid learning other folks’
passwords at all costs (Figure 2.3). If you know a password
20

Techno-babble is the use of
(often nonsensical) jargon and
technical terms to intimidate and
silence a challenge to a technical
issue.

to access a mission-critical machine and that machine ends up compromised
or with data missing, who might be blamed? You, that’s who, so avoid
learning passwords! If you only need a password once, let the user type it in
for you. If you anticipate accessing something multiple times (the more
usual situation), ask the user to change the password temporarily.
It’s funny, but people assume ownership of things they use at work.
John in accounting doesn’t call the computer he uses anything but “my PC.”
The phone on Susie’s desk isn’t the company phone, it’s “Susie’s phone.”
Regardless of the logic or illogic involved with this sense of ownership, a
tech needs to respect that feeling. You’ll never go wrong if you follow the
Ethic of Reciprocity, also known as the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you.” In a tech’s life, this can translate as “treat
people’s things as you would have other people treat yours.” Don’t use or
touch anything—keyboard, printer, laptop, monitor, mouse, phone, pen,
paper, or cube toy—without first asking permission. Follow this rule at all
times, even when the customer isn’t looking.
Dependability/Responsibility
Dependability and responsibility are another pair of traits that, while they
don’t mean the same thing, often go together. A responsible person is an-
swerable for the acts she does. A dependable person can be counted on to
perform those acts. Again, the freedom of the typical IT person’s job makes
dependability and responsibility utterly critical.
The single biggest dependability issue for an IT technician is to show up
for job appointments and to show up on time. It seems to me we now live in
a society where not showing up and not letting anyone know is normal. I
call it the “Age of the Blow-off.” We’ve all had an experience where we
counted on someone to show up to get work done, and we can all share ex-
periences when they simply did not show up. Failure to show up for an ap-
pointment is not only inconvenient, but it can also cost your customer a lot
of money in lost time and productivity.
If you or your company makes an appointment for you, show up. Be
there. Don’t let simple problems (such as bad traffic) prevent you from
showing up on time. Take some time to prepare. Figure out traffic times.
Figure out if preceding appointments will cause a problem, and check for
traffic. There is a popular old saying in the United States, “Five minutes
early is on time, and on time is late.” Sometimes events take place that pre-
vent you from being on time. When that happens, call the customer as soon
as you know and give them your best estimate of when you can be there. A
simple apology wouldn’t hurt, either.
Responsibility is a tricky subject for IT folks. Certainly you should be re-
sponsible for your actions, but the stakes are high when critical data and ex-
pensive equipment are at risk. Before you work on a computer, always ask if
there are backups. If there aren’t, offer to make backups for the customer,
even if this incurs an extra charge for the customer. If they choose not to
make a backup, make sure the customer understands, very clearly, the risk
to the data on the system you are about to repair.
Adaptability/Versatility
Adaptability defines how someone adjusts to changes. Versatility, at least
within the scope of an IT technician, is bringing a broad set of skills to the PC

repair process. Every PC repair is to some degree a guessing game. No one
knows all the possible problems that can go wrong with a computer. There
is no universal PC repair manual to which you can refer to tell you how to fix
computers. Good techs must be able to adapt to any situation, both techni-
cally and in the environment. For example, good techs should be able to fix
most peripherals, even if they are not experts on that particular device. As
you progress through the book, you’ll discover that most devices fit into one
family or another and that there are certain diagnostic/repair steps that you
can at least try to enact a repair.
Adaptability isn’t just for technical issues. PCs find themselves broken
in the strangest places and ways. An adaptable tech doesn’t have a problem
if a computer sits at the top of a suspension bridge or behind a desk. An
adaptable tech can work around mean dogs, broken water lines, and noisy
little kids. (But there are some very important rules to dealing with kids. See
later in this chapter.)
A technician has to be versatile. The best example of this is what I call the
User Advocate. User Advocates are technicians who take the time to learn
the processes of whatever organization they work for and look to create
technology solutions for problems and inefficiencies. This also means a tech
should be at least competent if not expert at all the computer applications
used by the organization. When you combine your IT skills with an under-
standing of how the business works, you become amazingly versatile,
quickly finding yourself with more responsibility and (hopefully) more
money.
A big part of versatility is offering different repair options in certain situ-
ations. When there is more than one way to fix things, make sure the cus-
tomer knows all the options, but also give them your recommendation. Tell
them why you feel your recommendation is the best course of action, but
give them knowledge necessary to make their own decision.
A tech’s versatility isn’t limited to IT skills. Woe to the tech who doesn’t
understand basic electrical wiring and building codes. I’ve had hundreds of
repair scenarios where the fix was as simple as knowing how to turn on an
electrical breaker or moving a PC away from an electrical motor. No, these
aren’t IT skills, but a versatile tech knows these problems exist.
Sensitivity
Sensitivity is the ability to appreciate another’s feeling and emotions. Sensi-
tivity requires observing others closely, taking time to appreciate their feel-
ings, and acting in such a way that makes them feel comfortable. I’ve rarely
felt that technicians I’ve met were good at sensitivity. The vast majority of
nerds I know, including myself, tend to be self-centered and unaware of
what’s going on around them. Let me give you a few tips I’ve learned along
the way.
Understand that the customer is paying for your time and skills. Also
understand that your presence invariably means something is wrong or
broken, and few things make users more upset than broken computers.
When you are “on the clock,” you need to show possibly very upset custom-
ers that you are giving their problem your full attention. To do this, you
need to avoid distractions. If you get a personal call, let it roll over to
voicemail. If you get a work-related call, politely excuse yourself, walk away
for privacy, and keep the call brief. Never talk to coworkers in a place where
22
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

your customer can hear. Never speak badly of a customer; you never know
where you’ll run into them next.
Last, be culturally sensitive. We live in a diverse world of races, reli-
gions, etiquettes, and traditions. If a customer’s religious holiday conflicts
with your work schedule, the customer wins. If the customer wants you to
take off your shoes, take them off. If the customer wants you to wear a hat,
wear one. When in doubt, always ask the customer for guidance.
■Communication
When you deal with users, managers, and owners who are frustrated and
upset because a computer or network is down and they can’t work, your job
requires you to take on the roles of detective and psychologist. Talking with
frazzled and confused people and getting answers to questions about how
the PC got into the state it’s in takes skill. Communicating clearly and effec-
tively is important. Plus, you need to follow the rules of tech-person deco-
rum, acting with personal integrity and respect for the customer. Finally,
use assertive communication to empathize with and educate the user. Great
techs spend the time needed to develop these essential skills.
Assertive Communication
In many cases, a PC problem results from user error or neglect. As a techni-
cian, you must show users the error of their ways without creating anger or
conflict. You do this by using assertive communication. Assertive communi-
cation isn’t pushy or bossy, but it’s also not the language of a pushover. As-
sertive communication first requires you to show the other person that you
understand and appreciate the importance of his feelings. Use statements
such as “I know how frustrating it feels to lose data” or “I understand how
infuriating it is when the network goes out and you can’t get your job done.”
Statements like these cool off the situation and let customers know you are
on their side. Avoid using the word “you,” as it can sound accusatory.
The second part of assertive communication is making sure you state the
problem clearly without accusing the user directly: “Not keeping up with
defragmenting your hard drive slows it down,” or “Help me understand
how the network cable keeps getting unplugged during your lunch hour.”
Last, tell the user what you need to prevent this error in the future. “Please
call me whenever you hear that buzzing sound,” or “Please check the com-
pany’s approved software list before installing anything.” Always use “I”
and “me,” and never make judgments. “I can’t promise the keyboard will
work well if it’s always getting dirty” is much better than “Stop eating cook-
ies over the keyboard, you slob!”
Respectful Communication
The final key in communicating with users revolves around respect. You
don’t do the user’s job, but you should respect that job and person as an es-
sential cog in the organization. Communicate with users the way you would
Chapter 2: Operational Procedures
23

like them to communicate with you, were the roles reversed. Again, this fol-
lows the Ethic of Reciprocity.
Generally, IT folks are there to support the people doing a company’s
main business. You are there to serve their needs and, all things being equal,
to do so at their convenience, not yours.
Don’t assume the world stops the moment you walk in the door and that
you may immediately interrupt their work to do yours. Although most cus-
tomers are thrilled and motivated to help you the moment you arrive, this
may not always be the case. Ask the magic question, “May I start working
on the problem now?” Give customers a chance to wrap up, shut down, or
do anything else necessary to finish their business and make it safe for you
to do yours.
Engage the user with the standard rules of civil conversation. Take the
time to listen. Don’t interrupt customers as they describe a problem; just lis-
ten and take notes. You might hear something that leads to resolving the
problem. Rephrase and repeat the problems back to the customer to verify
you understand the issue (“So the computer is locking up three times a
day?”). Use an even, nonaccusatory tone, and although it’s okay to try to ex-
plain a problem if the user asks, never condescend and never argue.
Remain positive in the face of adversity. Don’t get defensive if you can’t
figure something out quickly and the user starts hassling you. Remember
that an angry customer isn’t really angry with youhe’s just frustratedso
don’t take his anger personally. Take it in stride; smile, and assure him that
computer troubleshooting sometimes takes a while.
Avoid letting outside interruptions take your focus away from the user
and her computer problem. Things that break your concentration slow
down the troubleshooting process immensely. Plus, customers will feel in-
sulted if you start chatting on your cell phone with your significant other
about a movie date later that night when you’re supposed to be fixing their
computers! You’re not being paid to socialize, so turn those cell phones and
pagers to vibrate. That’s why the technogods created voicemail. Never take
any call except one that is potentially urgent. If a call is potentially urgent,
explain the urgency to the customer, step away, and deal with the call as
quickly as possible.
If you discover that the user caused the problem, either through igno-
rance or by accident, don’t minimize the importance of the problem, but
don’t be judgmental or insulting about the cause. We all screw up some-
times, and these kinds of mistakes are your job security. You get paid because
people make mistakes and machines break. Chances are you’ll be back at that
workstation six months or a year later, fixing something else. By becoming
the user’s advocate and go-to person, you create a better work environment.
If a mistaken action caused the problem, explain in a positive and support-
ive way how to do the task correctly and then have the user go through the
process while you are there to reinforce what you said.
Eliciting Answers
Your job as a tech is to get the computer fixed, and the best way to start that
process is to determine what the computer is doing or not doing. You must
start by talking to the customer. Allow the customer to explain the problem
fully while you record the information. Once the person has described the
24
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

situation, you must then ask questions. This process is called eliciting
answers.
Although each person is different, most users with a malfunctioning
computer or peripheral will be afraid and often defensive about the prob-
lem. To overcome this initial attitude, you need to ask the right questions
and listen to the customer’s answers. Then ask the proper follow-up
questions.
Always avoid accusatory questions, because they
won’t help you in the least (Figure 2.4). “What did you
do?” generally gets a confused or defensive “Nothing” in
reply, which doesn’t get you closer to solving the prob-
lem. First, ask questions that help clarify the situation.
Repeat what you think is the problem after you’ve lis-
tened all the way through the user’s story.
Follow up with fact-seeking questions. “When did it
last work?” “Has it ever worked in this way?” “Has any
software changed recently?” “Any new hardware?” Ask
open-ended questions to narrow the scope (“What appli-
cations are running when the computer locks up?”).
By keeping your questions friendly and factual, you
show users that you won’t accuse them or judge their ac-
tions (Figure 2.5). You also show them that you’re there
to help them. After the initial tension drops away, you’ll
often get more information: for instance, a recitation of
something the user might have tried or changed. These
clues can help lead to a quick resolution of the problem.
Remember that you may know all about computer
technology, but the user probably does not. This means a
user will often use vague and/or incorrect terms to de-
scribe a particular computer component or function.
That’s just the way it works, so don’t bother to correct
them. Wherever possible, avoid using jargon, acronyms,
or abbreviations specific to computers. They simply con-
fuse the already upset user and can make you sound like
you’re talking down to them. Just ask direct, factual
questions in a friendly tone, using simple, non-jargon
language to zero in on what the user was trying to accom-
plish and what happened when things went wrong. Use
visual aids when possible. Point at the machine or go to a
working PC to have the user show what went wrong or
what she did or tried to do.
People do usually want to get a handle on what you are doingin a sim-
plified way. You don’t want to overwhelm them, but don’t be afraid to use
simple analogies or concepts to give them an idea of what is happening. If
you have the time (and the skills), use drawings, equipment, and other vi-
sual aids to make technical concepts more clear. If a customer is a closet tech
and is really digging for answersto the point that it’s affecting your ability
to do your jobcompliment her initiative and then direct her to outside
training opportunities. Better yet, tell her where she can get a copy of this
book!

Keeping it friendly

Beyond basic manners, never
assume that just because you are
comfortable with friendly or ca-
sual behavior, the customer will be
too. Even an apparently casual
user will expect you to behave
with professional decorum. On
the flip side, don’t allow a user to
put you in an awkward or even
potentially dangerous or illegal
situation. Never do work outside
the scope of your assigned duties
without the prior approval of your
supervisor (when possible in such cases, try to direct users to someone who
can help them). You are not a babysitter; never volunteer to “watch the kids”
while the customer leaves the job site or tolerate a potentially unsafe situa-
tion if a customer isn’t properly supervising a child. Concentrate on doing
your job safely and efficiently, and maintain professional integrity.
Expectations and Follow-up
Users are terrified when their PCs and networks go down so hard that they
need to call in a professional. Odds are good that they’ve left critical, or at
least important, data on the computer. Odds are equally good they need this
computer to work to do their job. When they’re ready to lay down money
for a professional, they’re expecting you to make their system exactly the
way it was before it broke.
Hopefully you can do exactly that for them, but you also must deal with
their expectations and let them know what to expect. Equally, you should
give your customers some follow-up after the job is finished. We’ve already
covered data backups and Authorization of Work forms (and those are very
important), but you need to keep the customer’s needs in mind. You also
want to keep them thinking about you, should they need more help in the
future. Here are a few items you should consider.
Time Frame
If you can give the customer a best guess as to how long the repair will take,
you’ll be a hero. Don’t be afraid to hold off on your time-frame prediction
until you’ve diagnosed the machine. If you truly don’t have a feel for the
time involved, tell the customer that and then tell them what you’ll need to
know before you can make the prediction.
Stick to the timeline. If you finish more quickly, great! People love a job
that goes faster than predicted. If you’re moving past the predicted time
frame, contact the customer and tell them as soon as possible. Let them
know what’s happened, why you’re going over, and give them a new time
frame. The biggest secret here is to keep in communication with the cus-
tomer on any change in status. People understand delays—they take place
in our lives daily. People resent not knowing, especially when a precious
computer is at stake.

Apply the Ethic of Reciprocity
The Ethic of Reciprocity appears in almost every religion on the planet,
with versions attributed to Confucius, Jesus, Moses, and Mohammed,
among others. Just for practice, try the Ethic of Reciprocity out in non-
tech situations, such as when buying something from the corner store or
grocery. Consciously analyze how the clerk behind the counter would
want a customer to interact with him. Now put yourself in the clerk’s
shoes. How would you want a customer to communicate with you? Act
accordingly!

Documentation
At the completion of work, document the problem, including the time and
day you started work, the solution (again including the time and day the
work ended), the hours worked, and a list of all parts replaced. If the cus-
tomer owns the parts, offer them to the customer (this is especially true if
you replace any storage media). This documentation may or may not in-
clude your charges.
Follow-up
I call follow-up the Lost Art: a simple follow-up, usually just a phone call, to
confirm that the customer is happy with your work. This gives the customer
a chance to detail any special issues that may have arisen and it also gives
that final extra touch that ensures they will come to you again.
■Safety and Tools
Effective communication with your customer enables you to start the trou-
bleshooting process, getting details about the problem and clues about
things that happened around the same time. To continue troubleshooting,
though, you need to be adept at handling the computer. That starts with
knowing how to handle computer components safely and how to use the
tools of a tech. Let’s begin by identifying and discussing some of the prob-
lems you may run into and how to deal with them.
Electrostatic Discharge (ESD)
If you decide to open a PC while reading this chapter, as I encourage you to
do, you must take proper steps to avoid the greatest killer of PCs: electro-
static discharge (ESD). ESD simply means the passage of a static electrical
charge from one item to another. Have you ever rubbed a balloon against
your shirt, making the balloon stick to you? That’s a classic example of static
electricity. When that static charge discharges, you may not notice it
happening—although on a cool, dry day, I’ve been shocked so hard by
touching a doorknob that I could see a big, blue spark! I’ve never heard of a
human being getting anything worse than a rather nasty shock from ESD,
but I can’t say the same thing about computers. ESD will destroy the sensi-
tive parts of your PC, so it is essential that you take steps to avoid ESD when
working on your PC.
Anti-static Tools
ESD only takes place when two objects that store different amounts (the hip
electrical term to use is potential) of static electricity come in contact. The se-
cret to avoiding ESD is to keep you and the parts of the PC you touch at the
same electrical potential. You can accomplish this by connecting yourself to
the PC via a handy little device called an anti-static wrist strap. This simple
device consists of a wire that connects on one end to an alligator clip and on
the other end to a small metal plate that secures to your wrist with an elastic
Chapter 2: Operational Procedures
27
All PCs are well protected
against ESD on the outside. Un-
less you take a screwdriver and
actually open up your PC, you
don’t need to concern yourself
with ESD.

strap. You snap the alligator clip onto any handy metal part of the PC and
place the wrist strap on either wrist. Figure 2.6 shows a typical anti-static
wrist strap in use.
Anti-static wrist straps are standard equipment for
anyone working on a PC, but other tools might also come
in handy. One of the big issues when working with a PC
occurs if you find yourself pulling out parts from the PC
and setting them aside. The moment you take a piece out
of the PC, it no longer has contact with the systems and
may pick up static from other sources. Techs use anti-
static mats to eliminate this risk. An anti-static mat acts as
a point of common potential; it’s typical to purchase a
combination anti-static wrist strap and mat that all con-
nect to keep you, the PC, and any loose components at
the same electrical potential (Figure 2.7).
Anti-static wrist straps and mats use tiny resistors—
devices that stop or resist the flow of electricity—to pre-
vent anti-static charge from racing through the device.
These resistors can fail over time, so it’s always a good idea to read the docu-
mentation that comes with your anti-static tools to see how to test those
small resistors properly.
Any electrical component not in a PC needs to be stored in an anti-static
bag, a specially designed bag that sheds whatever static electricity you have
when you touch it, thus preventing any damage to components stored
within (Figure 2.8). Almost all PC components come in an anti-static bag
when purchased. Experienced techs never throw these bags away, as you
never know when you’ll want to pull a part out and place it on a shelf for a
while.
Although having an anti-static wrist strap with you at all times would be
ideal, the reality is that from time to time you’ll find yourself in a situation
where you lack the proper anti-static tools. This shouldn’t keep you from
working on the PC—if you’re careful! Before working on a PC in such a situ-
ation, take a moment to touch the power supply every once in a while as you
work—I’ll show you where it is in Chapter 3, “The Visible PC”—to keep
28

Static electricity, and there-
fore the risk of ESD, is much
more prevalent in dry, cool
environments.

yourself at the same electrical potential as the PC. Although this isn’t as
good as a wrist strap, it’s better than nothing at all.
The last issue when it comes to preventing ESD is that never-ending
question—should you work with the PC plugged in or unplugged? The an-
swer is simple: Do you really want to be physically connected to a PC that is
plugged into an electrical outlet? Granted, the chances of electrocution are
slim, but why take the risk?
Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
A magnetic field interfering with electronics is electromagnetic interference
(EMI). EMI isn’t nearly as dangerous as ESD, but it can cause permanent
damage to some components and erase data on some storage devices. You
can prevent EMI by keeping magnets away from computer equipment. Cer-
tain components are particularly susceptible to EMI. Never get a magnet
close to

Floppy disks
■
Hard drives
■
Flash drives
■
CRT (tube) monitors
The biggest problem with EMI is that we often use magnets without
even knowing we are doing so. Any device with an electrical motor has a
magnet. Many telephones have magnets. Power bricks for laptops and
speakers also have magnets. Keep them away!
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)
Do you ever hear strange noises on your speakers even though you aren’t
playing any sounds? Do you ever get strange noises on your cell phone? If

Anti-static Protection Devices
In some circumstances, an anti-static wrist strap could get in the way.
Manufacturers have developed some alternatives to the wrist strap, so
try this:
1.
Take a field trip to a local computer or electronics store.
2.
Check out their selection of anti-static devices. Can you find
anything other than wrist straps or mats?
3.
Do a Web search for “static control products.” Can you find
anything other than wrist straps or mats?
4.
Report what options you can find for protecting your equipment
from ESD. Weigh the pros and cons and decide what you would
use in various situations.
Always unplug a PC when
working inside it.

so, you’ve probably run into radio frequency interference (RFI). Many de-
vices emit radio waves:
■
Cell phones
■
Wireless network cards
■
Cordless phones
■
Baby monitors
■
Microwave ovens
In general, the radio waves that these devices emit are very weak, and al-
most all electronic devices are shielded to prevent RFI. A few devices,
speakers in particular, are susceptible to RFI. RFI will never cause any dam-
age, but it can be incredibly irritating. The best way to prevent RFI is to keep
radio-emitting devices as far away as possible from other electronics.
RFI becomes a big problem when two devices share the same frequencies.
Cordless phones, baby monitors, and wireless networks share the same range
of frequencies. They sometimes interfere with each other, causing poor sig-
nals or even blocking signals completely. These devices need to be tuned to
avoid stomping on each other’s frequencies. In Chapter 17, ”Learning Wire-
less,” you’ll see how to tune a wireless network to prevent RFI.
Physical Safety
IT techs live in a dangerous world. We’re in constant danger of tripping, hurt-
ing our backs, and getting burned by hot components. Let’s take a moment to
discuss these three physical safety issues and what to do about them.
If you don’t keep organized, hardware technology will take over your
life. Figure 2.9 shows a corner of my office, a painful example of a cable
“kludge.”
Cable messes such as these are dangerous tripping hazards. While I may
allow a mess like this in my home office, all cables in a business environment
are carefully tucked away behind computer cases, run into walls, or placed
under cable runners. If you see a cable that is an obvious tripping hazard,
contact the person in charge of the building (CompTIA calls these folks

Tech Tip
Protective Bag Types
Computer gear manufacturers
package their product in a variety
of ways to shield against acciden-
tal damage, whether that’s physi-
cal damage, ESD, EMI, or RFI.
The typical pink translucent com-
puter bag is coated with a film
that prevents the bag from pro-
ducing static electricity and
mildly protects the contents
against physical contact (and
thus damage). The two types of
metal bags offer shielding against
EMI and RFI as well as ESD.
These are the silvery bags (such
as in Figure 2.8) you’ll see hard
drives packed in, for example, and
the black and silver woven bags
you’ll sometimes see.
A word of caution is in order
here. The metal bags provide
proper protection only when
sealed, so fold the open end over
and slap a piece of tape on it
when storing a component.

“building services”) to take care of it immediately. The results of ignoring
such hazards can be catastrophic (Figure 2.10).
Another physical safety issue is heavy boxes. Computers, printers,
monitors—everything we use—all seem to come to us in heavy boxes. Re-
member never to lift with your back; lift with your legs, and always use a
hand truck if available. You are never paid enough to risk your own health.
The last physical safety issue to discuss is burns. The computing world is
filled with hot components. It’s hard to burn yourself unless you actually
open up a computer, printer, or monitor. First, watch for anything with a
cooling fin like the one shown in Figure 2.11. If you see a cooling fin, odds
are good that something is hot enough to burn you. Also look for labels/
stickers warning about hot components. Last, when in doubt, move your
hand over components as if you were checking the heat on a stove.

Tools of the Trade
The basic tech toolkit consists of a Phillips-head screwdriver and not much
else—seriously—but a half-dozen tools round out a fully functional toolkit.
Most kits have a star-headed Torx wrench, a nut driver or two, a pair of
plastic tweezers, a little grabber tool (the technical term is parts retriever),
and a hemostat to go along with Phillips-head and flat-head screwdrivers
(Figure 2.12).
A lot of techs throw in an extension magnet to grab hard-to-reach bits
that drop into cases. Many also add a magnifying glass and a flashlight
for those hard-to-read numbers and text on the printed circuit boards
(PCBs) that make up a large percentage of devices inside the system unit.
Contrary to what you might think, techs rarely need a hammer.

Chapter 2 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises,
you should understand the following about operational
procedures.
Present yourself with a proper appearance
and professional manner
■
Professional techs dress appropriately. This means
decent, clean clothes that are wrinkle-free, such as
khaki trousers and a polo or button-down shirt.
Professional techs bathe. Regularly.
■
Professional techs cultivate proper traits, such as
honesty/integrity, dependability/reliability,
adaptability/versatility, and sensitivity.
Talk to customers in a professional,
productive manner
■
Techs should use effective communication
techniques such as assertive communication to
interact with customers. Assertive communication
means showing empathy for the customer’s plight
and clearly stating the perceived problem without
directly accusing the customer. Assertive
communication also means telling the user what
needs to happen to avoid the problem in the
future.
■
A good tech respects the customer, following the
Ethic of Reciprocity. Do not interrupt the customer.
Engage in conversation, using proper manners,
and actively listening. Remain positive, even when
the customer gets upset. Avoid letting outside
interruptions take your focus away from the user
and the user’s computer problem.
■
When eliciting answers, ask questions to help
clarify the situation. Follow up with fact-seeking
questions. Always explain what you’re doing, but
avoid excessive jargon.
■
Never do work outside the scope of your assigned
duties without the prior approval of your supervisor.
Don’t babysit the kids while the customer wanders
off.
■
Manage your customer’s expectations by
explaining how much time you expect to take and
the price. Document everything you do to solve the
problem, including the time you spend. Follow up
with the customer after solving the problem—a
quick phone call will do—to make certain nothing
has gone wrong and that he is satisfied with your
work.
Work with PCs safely using the proper tools
■
Take precautionary measures when working on
computers. Use best practices for avoiding
electrostatic discharge. Put unused components in
anti-static bags. Protect sensitive equipment from
electromagnetic interference.
■
Use the right tools to get the job done, especially
your Phillips-head screwdriver!

astering the craft of a PC technician requires you to learn a lot of details
about the many pieces of hardware in the typical PC. Even the most basic
PC contains hundreds of discrete hardware components, each with its own set
of characteristics, shapes, sizes, colors, connections, and so on. By the end of
this book, you will be able to discuss all of these components in detail. This
chapter takes you on a tour of a typical PC, starting with an overview of how
computers work, and then examining both external connectors and internal
components.
Remember the children’s song that goes, “Oh, the leg bone connects to the
thigh bone…”? Well, think of the rest of the chapter in that manner, showing
you what the parts look like and giving you a rough idea about how they work
and connect. In later chapters, you’ll dissect all of these PC “leg bones” and
“thigh bones” and get to the level of detail you need to install, configure,
maintain, and fix computers. Even if you are an expert, do not skip this chapter!
It introduces a large number of terms used throughout the rest of the book.
Many of these terms you will know, but some you will not, so take some time
and read it.

It is handy, although certainly not required, to have a PC that you can take
the lid off of and inspect as you progress. Almost any old PC will helpit
doesn’t even need to work. So get thee a screwdriver, grab your PC, and see if
you can recognize the various components as you read about them.

You’ve undoubtedly seen a PC in action: a nice, glossy monitor displaying a
picture that changes according to the actions of the person sitting in front of
it, typing away on a keyboard and clicking on a mouse. Sound pours out of
tiny speakers that flank the screen, and a box whirs happily beneath the ta-
ble. The PC is a computer: a machine that enables you to do work, produce
documents, play games, balance your checkbook, and look up the latest
sports scores on the Internet.
Although the computer is certainly a machine, it’s also programming: the
commands that tell the computer what to do to get work done. These com-
mands are just ones and zeros that the computer’s hardware understands,
enabling it to do amazing actions, such as perform powerful mathematic
functions, move data (also ones and zeros), realize the mouse has moved,
and put pretty icons on the screen. So a computer is a complex interaction
between hardware and computer programming, created by your fellow
humans.
Ever heard of Morse code? Morse code is nothing more than dots
and dashes to those who do not understand it, but if you send dots
and dashes (in the right order) to someone who understands Morse
code, you can tell the recipient a joke. Think of programming as
Morse code for the computer (Figure 3.1). You may not understand
those ones and zeros, but your computer certainly does!
There’s more to the ones and zeros than just programming. All
of the data on the computerthe Web pages, your documents, your
e-mailis also stored as ones and zeros. Programs know how to
translate these ones and zeros into a form humans understand.
Programming comes in two forms. First are the applications: the
programs that get work done. Word processing programs, Web
browsers, and e-mail programs are all considered applications. But
applications need a main program to support them. They need a
program that enables you to start and stop applications, copy/
move/delete data, talk to the hardware, and perform lots of other
jobs. This program is called the operating system (OS). Microsoft
Windows is the most popular OS today, but there are other com-
puter operating systems, such as Apple Macintosh OS X and the
popular (and free) Linux (Figure 3.2). Computer people lump oper-
ating systems and applications into the term software to differenti-
ate them from the hardware of the computer.
Understanding the computer at this broad conceptual level—in
terms of hardware, OS, and programs—can help you explain things

ones and zeros makes perfect
sense.

to customers, but good techs have a much more fundamental appreciation
and understanding of the complex interplay of all of the software and the in-
dividual pieces of hardware. In short, techs need to know the processes go-
ing on behind the scenes.
From the CompTIA A+ tech’s perspective, the computer functions
through four stages: input, processing, output, and storage. Knowing which
parts participate in a particular stage of the computing process enables you
to troubleshoot on a fundamental and decisive level.
Input
To illustrate this four-step process, let’s walk through the steps involved in a
fairly common computer task: preparing your taxes. [Insert collective groan
here.] February has rolled around and, at least in the United States, millions
of people install their favorite tax software, TurboTax from Intuit, onto their
computers to help them prepare their taxes. After starting TurboTax, your
first job is to provide the computer with data: essential information, such as
your name, where you live, how much you earned, and how many dollars
you gave to federal and state governments.
Various pieces of hardware enable you to input data, the most common
of which are the keyboard and mouse. Most computers won’t react when
you say, “Hey you!”—at least not anywhere outside of a Star Trek episode.
Although that day will come, for now you must use something decidedly
more mechanical: a keyboard to type in your data. The OS provides a funda-
mental service in this process as well. You can bang on a keyboard all day
and accomplish nothing unless the OS translates your keystrokes into code
that the rest of your computer’s hardware understands.

Typical OS X, Linux, and Windows interfaces
The CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam only covers the Windows
operating system, so you won’t
see much discussion of OS X or
Linux in this book. Nevertheless,
a good tech should possess a
basic understanding of these
two excellent operating systems.
Tech Tip
Voice Recognition
Some might argue that voice rec-
ognition, the ability for a com-
puter to understand your voice,
has been around for a long time.
In my opinion, it doesn’t work
well enough to replace my
keyboard
yet.

Processing
Next, the computer processes your data. After you place
information in various appropriate “boxes” in TurboTax,
the computer does the math for you. Processing takes
place inside the system unit—the box under your desk
(see Figure 3.3)—and happens almost completely at a
hardware level, although that hardware functions ac-
cording to rules laid out in the OS. Thus again you have a
complex interaction between hardware and software.
The processing portion is the magical part—you can’t
see it happen. The first half of this book demystifies this
stage, because good techs understand all of the pieces of
the process. I won’t go through the specific hardware in-
volved in the processing stage here, because the pieces
change according to the type of process.
Output
Simply adding up your total tax for the year is useless un-
less the computer shows you the result. That’s where the
third stepoutput—comes into play (Figure 3.4). Once
the computer finishes processing data, it must put the in-
formation somewhere for you to inspect it. Often it places
data on the monitor so you can see what you’ve just
typed. It might send the data over to the printer if you tell
it, so you can print out copies of your tax return to mail to
the Internal Revenue Service (or whatever the Tax Man is
called where you live). A hardware device does the ac-
tual printing, but the OS controls the printing process.
Again, it’s a fundamental interaction of hardware and
software.
Storage
Once you’ve sent in your tax return, you most likely do not want all
that work simply to disappear. What happens if the IRS comes back a
couple of months later with a question about your return? Yikes! You
need to keep permanent records and you need to keep a copy of the tax
program. The fourth stage in the computing process is storage. A lot of
devices are used in the storage process, the most visible of which are
the external storage parts, such as a thumb drive or recordable CD
discs (Figure 3.5).
The Art of the PC Technician
Using the four stages of the computing process—input, processing,
output, and storage—to master how the PC works and, in turn, become
a great technician requires that you understand all of the pieces of
hardware and software involved and the interactions between them
that make up the various stages. You have to know what the parts do,

in other words, and how they work together. The best place to start is with a
real computer. Let’s go through the process of inspecting a typical, complete
PC, including opening up a few important pieces to see the components in-
side. Hopefully, you have a real computer in front of you right now that you
may dismantle a bit. No two computers are exactly the same, so you’ll see
differences between your PC and the one in this chapterand that’s okay.
You’ll come to appreciate that all computers have the same main parts that
do the same jobs even though they differ in size, shape, and color.
By the time you reach the end of this book, you’ll have a deeper, more
nuanced understanding of the interaction of hardware and software in the
four-stage computing process. Just as great artists have mastered fundamen-
tal skills of their trade before creating a masterpiece, you’ll have the funda-
mentals of the art of the computer technician and be on your road to mastery.
■The Complete PC
Sometimes I hate the term “personal computer.” That term implies a single
device, like a toaster. A typical PC is more than one device, and you need all
of the parts (or at least most) to make the PC work. The most important part
of the PC is the box that usually sits under your desk: the one that all of the
other parts connect to, called the system unit. All of the processing and stor-
age takes place in the system unit. All of the other parts of the PC—the
printer, the keyboard, the monitor—connect to the system unit and are
known collectively as peripherals. Figure 3.6 shows a typical desktop PC,
with the system unit and peripherals as separate pieces.
Most computers have a standard set of peripherals to provide input and
output. You’ll see some variation in color, bells, and whistles, but here’s the
standard set.
■
Monitor
The big television thing that provides a visual output for
the computer.
■
Keyboard
Keypad for providing keyed input. Based on a
typewriter.
■
Mouse
Pointing device used to control a graphical pointer on the
monitor for input.
■
Speakers/headphones
Speakers provide sound
output.
■
Printer
Provides printed paper output.
A typical PC has all of these peripherals, but no law
requires a PC to have them. Plenty of PCs may not have a
printer. Some PCs don’t have speakers. Some computers
don’t even have a keyboard, mouse, or monitorbut
they tend to hide in unlikely places, such as the inside
of a jet fighter or next to the engine in an automobile.
Other PCs may have many more peripherals. Installing
four or five printers on a single PC is easy, if you so
42

desire. You’ll also find hundreds of other types of peripherals, such as Web
cameras and microphones, on many PCs. You add or remove peripherals
depending on what you need from the system. The only limit is the number
of connections for peripherals available on the system unit.
External Connections
Every peripheral connects to the system unit through one of the many types
of ports. The back of a typical system unit (Figure 3.7) has many cables run-
ning from the system unit to the various peripherals. You may even have a
few connectors in the front. All of these connectors and ports have their own
naming conventions, and a good tech knows all of them. It’s not acceptable to
go around saying such things as “That’s a printer port” or “That’s a little-type
keyboard connector.” You need to be comfortable with the more commonly
used naming conventions so you can say “That’s a female DB-25” or “That’s a
USB connector.”
Plugs, Ports, Jacks, and Connectors
Although PCs use close to 50 different types of connections, almost all fit
into one of six major types: DIN, USB, FireWire, DB, RJ, and audio. Read the
next paragraphs to get your terminology straight and then you can jump
into the various connectors with gusto.
No one seems to use the terms plug, port, jack, or connector correctly, so
let’s get this right from the start. To connect one device to another, you need
a cable containing the wires that make the connection. On each device, as
well as on each end of the connecting cable, you need standardized parts to
make that connection. Because these are usually electrical connections, one
part needs to fit inside another to make a snug, safe connection.
A plug is a part with some type of projection that goes into a port. A port
is a part that has some type of matching hole or slot that accepts the plug.
You never put a port into a plug; it’s always the other way around. The term
jack is used as an alternative to port, so you may also put a plug into a jack.
The term connector describes either a port or a plug. As you progress though
this chapter and see the various plugs and ports, this will become clearer
(Figure 3.8).

Mini-DIN Connectors
Most PCs sport the European-designed mini-DIN connectors. The origi-
nal DIN connector was replaced by mini-DIN a long time ago, so you’ll
only see mini-DIN connectors on your PC (see Figure 3.9 bottom).
Older-style keyboards and mice plugged into DIN ports (Figure 3.9
top).
USB Connectors
Universal serial bus (USB) provides the most common general-purpose
connection for PCs. You’ll find USB versions of many devices, such as
mice, keyboards, scanners, cameras, and printers. USB connections
come in three sizes: A, B, and mini-B. The USB A connector’s distinctive
rectangular shape makes it easily recognizable (Figure 3.10).
You never see a USB B connector on your computer. USB B connect-
ers are for the other end of the USB cable, where it attaches to the USB
device (Figure 3.11).
The USB B connector’s relatively large size makes it less than opti-
mal for small devices such as cameras, so the USB folks also make the
smaller mini-B–style connector shown in Figure 3.12.
USB has a number of features that make it particularly popular on
PCs. First, USB devices are hot-swappable, which means you can insert
or remove them without restarting your PC. Almost every other type of
connector requires you to turn the system off, insert or remove the con-
nector, and then turn the system back on. Hot-swapping completely elimi-
nates this process.
Second, many USB devices get their electrical power through the USB
connection, so they don’t need batteries or a plug for an electrical outlet. You
can even recharge some devices, such as cellular phones, by plugging them
into a USB port (Figure 3.13).
FireWire Connectors
FireWire, also known as IEEE 1394, moves data at incredibly high speeds,
making it the perfect connection for highly specialized applications such as
44

Tech Tip
Downstream and
Upstream
You’ll sometimes hear USB ports
and plugs described as upstream
or downstream, terms that cre-
ate rather amusing conversation
and confusion. It’s all about
whether you refer to the plug or
the port, so here’s the scoop.
The USB A plugs go upstream to
USB A ports on the host or
hub. USB A ports provide down-
stream output from the host or
hub. So the plug is upstream and
the port is downstream.
Just to add more fun to the mix,
USB B plugs go downstream to
devices. USB B ports provide up-
stream output from the device to
the host or hub. My advice? Stick
with A or B and nobody will get
confused.
• Figure 3.11

streaming video from a digital video camera onto a hard drive.
FireWire consists of a special 6-wire connector, as shown in
Figure 3.14, or a 9-wire connector for devices that need more speed
and power. A smaller, 4-pin version is usually seen on peripherals.
Like USB, FireWire devices are hot-swappable.
DB Connectors
Over the years, DB connectors have been used for almost any
type of peripheral you can think of, with the exception of key-
boards. They have a slight D shape, which allows only one proper way to in-
sert a plug into the socket and makes it easier to remember what they’re
called. Technically, they’re known as D-sub or D-subminiature connectors,
but most techs call them DBs.
Each male DB plug has a group of small pins that connect to DB ports.
Female DB plugs connect to male DB ports on the system unit. DB connec-
tors in the PC world can have from 9 to 37 pins or sockets, although you
rarely see a DB connector with more than 25 pins or sockets. Figure 3.15
shows an example. DB-type connectors are some of the oldest and most
common connectors used in the back of PCs.
It wasn’t that long ago that a typical PC used at least three or more differ-
ent DB connectors. Over the past few years, the PC world has moved away
from DB connectors. A typical modern system has only one or two, usually
for video.

Tech Tip
D-Subminiature
Naming Scheme
Each size D-sub connector—
called the shell size—has a
specific name in the D-sub manu-
facturing world. A two-row,
9-pin connector, for example, is
officially a DE-9 connector rather
than a DB-9. The E refers to the
9-pin shell size. Why all of the
DA, DB, DC, DD, and DE con-
nectors became DB-x in the world
of personal computers is a mys-
tery, but most techs simply call
them DB connectors.

RJ Connectors
You have more than likely seen an RJ connector, whether or not you knew it
by that name. The little plastic plug used to connect your telephone cord to
the jack (techs don’t use the word “port” to describe RJ connectors) is
a classic example of an RJ plug. Modern PCs use only two types of RJ
jacks: the RJ-11 and the RJ-45. The phone jack is an RJ-11. It is used al-
most exclusively for modems. The slightly wider RJ-45 jack is used
for your network connection. Figure 3.16 shows an RJ-11 jack (top)
and an RJ-45 jack (bottom).
Audio Connectors
Speakers and microphones connect to audio jacks on the system unit.
The most common type of sound connector in popular use is the 1/8-inch
connector, also called a mini-audio connector. These small connectors
have been around for years; they’re just like the plug you use to insert
headphones into a radio, music player, or similar device (Figure 3.17).
Traditionally, you’d find the audio jacks on the back of the PC, but
many newer models sport front audio connections as well.
Devices and Their Connectors
Now that you have a sense of the connectors, let’s turn to the devices
common to almost every PC to learn which connectors go with which
device.
Cards Versus Onboard
All of the connectors on the back of the PC are just that: connectors.
Behind those connectors are the actual devices that support whatever
peripherals plug into those connectors. These devices might be built
into the computer, such as a keyboard port. Others might be add-on expan-
sion cards that a tech installed into the PC.
Most PCs have special expansion slots inside the system unit that enable
you to add more devices on expansion cards. Figure 3.18 shows a typical
card. If you want some new device and your system unit doesn’t have that
device built into the PC, you just go to the store, buy a card version of that
46

• Figure 3.17
Mini-audio jacks and plug
Keep in mind that the variety
of connectors is virtually end-
less. The preceding types of con-
nectors cover the vast majority,
but many others exist in the PC
world. No law or standard re-
quires device makers to use a
particular connector, especially
if they have no interest in mak-
ing that device interchangeable
with similar devices from other
manufacturers.
Almost all connectors are
now color-coordinated to help
users plug the right device into
the right port. These color codes
are not required, and not all PCs
and devices use them.
Try This!
Feeling Your Way Around Connectors
Given that most PCs tend to sit on the floor under desks, a good PC tech
learns to recognize most every PC connector by touch. This is a great
exercise to do with a partner.
1.
Look at all of the connectors on the back of any PC’s system unit.
2.
Turn the system unit around so you can no longer see the
connections.
3.
Try to identify the connectors by feel.

device, and snap it in. Later chapters of the book go
into great detail on how to do this, but for now just ap-
preciate that a device might be built in or it might come
on a card.
Be careful handling cards. Touch the metal plate
with the 90-degree bend and try to avoid touching any
of the electronics. As mentioned in Chapter 2, “Opera-
tional Procedures,” always put cards into an anti-static
bag when moving them to prevent ESD.
Keyboard
Today’s keyboards come in many shapes and sizes,
but they always connect to your computer by either a
mini-DIN port or a USB port. Many keyboards ship
with an adapter so you can use either port. Most keyboard plugs
and mini-DIN keyboard ports are colored purple (see Figure 3.19).
Monitor
A monitor connects to the video connector on the system unit. You’ll
usually see one of two types of video connectors: the older 15-pin fe-
male DB Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) connector
or the unique digital video interface (DVI) connector. VESA connec-
tors are colored blue, whereas DVI connectors are white. Many
video cards have both types of connectors (see Figure 3.20) or two
VESA or two DVI connectors. Video cards with two connectors sup-
port two monitors, a very cool thing to do!
The newest video connector is called Hi-Definition Multimedia
Interface (HDMI), shown in Figure 3.21. HDMI is still very new to
the video scene and brings a number of enhancements, such as the
ability to carry both video and sound on the same cable. Primarily
designed for home theater, computers with HDMI connectors grow
more common every year.
Sound
The sound device in a computer performs two functions.
First, it takes digital information and turns it into sound,
outputting the sound through speakers. Second, it takes
sound that is input through a microphone or some other
audio source and turns it into digital data.
To play and record sounds, your sound device needs
to connect to a set of speakers and a microphone or
more. All PCs have at least two miniature audio jacks:

one for a microphone and another for stereo speakers. Better
cards provide extra miniature audio jacks for surround
sound. Figure 3.22 is a typical onboard soundcard showing
six different 1/8-inch jacks. Four of these are for speakers
and two are for input (such as microphones). The color
scheme for sound connections is complex, but for now re-
member one colorgreen. That’s the one you need to con-
nect a standard pair of stereo speakers.
An older sound card may still provide a female 15-pin DB
port that enables you to attach an electronic musical instru-
ment interface or add a joystick to your PC (see Figure 3.23).
These multi-function joystick/MIDI ports are rare today.
Adding more and more audio jacks to sound cards made
the back of a typical sound card a busy place. In an effort to
consolidate the various sound signals, the industry invented
the Sony/Philips Digital Interface Format (S/PDIF) connection.
S/PDIF comes in coaxial and optical versions. Figure 3.24
shows a motherboard with both (the coaxial connection is on
the left). One S/PDIF connection replaces all of the mini-au-
dio connections, assuming your surround speaker system
also comes with an S/PDIF connection.
Network
Networks are groups of connected PCs that share information.
The PCs most commonly connect via some type of cabling that
usually looks like an extra-thick phone cable. A modern PC uses
an RJ-45 connection to connect to the network. Figure 3.25 shows
a typical RJ-45 network connector. Network connectors do not
have a standard color.
Mouse
Most folks are pretty comfortable with the function of a mouse—
it enables you to select graphical items on a graphical screen. A
PC mouse has at least two buttons (as opposed to the famous
one-button mouse that came with Apple Macintosh computers

S/PDIF
Modern PCs have built-in net-
work connections, but this is a
fairly recent development. For
many years, network devices
only came on an expansion
card, called a network interface
card (NIC). The term is so com-
mon that even built-in network
connectionswhich most cer-
tainly are not cardsare still
called NICs.

until recently), while a better mouse provides a scroll wheel and extra
buttons. A mouse uses either a USB port or a dedicated, light-green
mini-DIN connector (see Figure 3.26).
A variation of the mouse is a trackball. A trackball does the same
job as a mouse, but instead of pushing it around like a mouse, the
trackball stays in one place as you roll a ball with your fingers or
thumb (Figure 3.27).
Modem
The old modem enables you to connect your PC to a telephone. Mo-
dems are another easily identifiable device in PCs as they have one or

Tech Tip
Serial Ports
External modems traditionally connected to a male 9-pin or 25-pin D-subminiature
port on the system unit called a serial port (shown in the following illustration). Al-
though just about every external modem today connects to USB, a few computers still
come with a serial port for legacy devices.
Serial ports are one of the few connectors on modern systems that were also used in
the first PCs more than 20 years ago.
Ill 3-1

two RJ-11 jacks. One jack is to connect the modem to the
telephone jack on the wall. If the modem has a second RJ-11
jack, it is for an optional telephone so you can use the
phone line when the modem is not in use (see Figure 3.28).
Printer
For many years, printers only used a special connector
called a parallel port. Parallel ports use a 25-pin female DB
connector that’s usually colored fuchsia (see Figure 3.29).
After almost 20 years of domination by parallel ports,
most printers now come with USB ports, FireWire, Ether-
net, and Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n connectivity options. Parallel
ports are quickly fading away from the backs of most
computers.
Joystick
Joysticks weren’t supposed to be used just for games (see Figure 3.30).
When the folks at IBM added the 2-row, 15-pin female DB joystick con-
nector to PCs, they envisioned joysticks as hard-working input de-
vices, just as the mouse is today. Except in the most rare circumstances,
however, the only thing a joystick does today is enable you to turn your
PC into a rather expensive game machine. But is there a more gratify-
ing feeling than easing that joystick over, pressing the Fire button, and
watching an enemy fighter jet get blasted by a well-placed Sidewinder
missile? I think not. Traditional joystick connecters are colored orange,
but most joysticks today connect to USB ports.

eSATA
More and more PCs are showing up with eSATA ports
like the one shown in Figure 3.31. The eSATA is a special
connector for external hard drives and optical drives.
Plenty More!
Keep in mind that there are lots more devices and con-
nectors out there. This section includes only the most
common and the ones you’re most likely to see. As you
progress through this book, you’ll see some less com-
mon connecters and where they are used.
■Inside the System Unit
Now that you’ve seen the devices that connect to the PC, it’s time to open up
the system unit to inspect the major internal components of a typical PC. A
single PC is composed of thousands of discrete components. Although no
one can name every tiny bit of electronics in a PC, a good technician should
be able to name the major internal components that make up the typical PC.
Let’s open and inspect a system unit to see these components and gain at
least a concept of what they do. In later chapters, you’ll see all of these com-
ponents in much more detail.
Case
The system unit’s case is both the internal framework of the PC and the ex-
ternal skin that protects the internal components from the environment.
Cases come in an amazing variety of styles, sizes, and
colors. Figure 3.32 shows the front and back of a typical
PC case. The front of the case holds the buttons for turn-
ing the system on and off, lights to tell you the status of
the system, and doors for accessing removable media
drives such as floppy, CD-ROM, and DVD drives. This
system also provides USB, FireWire, and audio connec-
tions in the front for easy access if you want to use a de-
vice that needs these connections.
The back of the case holds the vast majority of the
system unit connections. You will also notice the
power supplyalmost always at the top of the case
distinguished by its cooling fan and power plug. Note
that one area of the back, the I/O area, holds all of the
onboard connections (see Figure 3.33), while another
area in the back contains slots for cards. Similarly, the
case uses slots to enable access to the external connec-
tors on cards installed in the system unit.
Opening a case is always…interesting. There’s no
standard way to open a case, and I’m convinced that the
folks making system units enjoy some sick humor in-
venting new and complex ways to open them. In general,
Chapter 3: The Visible PC
51
• Figure 3.31

• Figure 3.32
Case—front and back

you detach the sides of a case by removing a few screws in the back of the
system unit, as shown in Figure 3.34. Use common sense and you won’t
have too many problems. Just don’t lose track of your screws or where each
one was inserted!
Once you’ve opened the case,
take a look inside. You’ll see metal
framework, all kinds of cables,
and a number of devices. As you
inspect
the
devices,
you
may
gently push cables to the side to
get a better view. Don’t forget to
wear an anti-static wrist strap (at-
taching it to any handy metal part
of the case) or touch the metal case
occasionally to prevent ESD.
CPU
The central processing unit (CPU), also called the microprocessor, performs
all of the calculations that take place inside a PC. CPUs come in a variety of

Tech Tip
Front Connections
Front connections are most com-
monly used for temporary devices,
such as headphones. If you have a
device you don’t intend to remove
very often, you should install it in
one of the back connections.
You’ll hear the PC case called
the enclosure, especially at the
more expensive end of the spec-
trum. Case, enclosure, and sys-
tem unit are interchangeable
terms.

Tools for Opening Cases
You read about the standard tools for opening cases and working on the
inside of a system unit in Chapter 2, “Operational Procedures,” so check
your memory now. What types of screwdrivers might you use? (Name
three.) What tool would you use if you dropped a screw inside a case?
• Figure 3.35
Typical CPUs still in protective packaging

Modern CPUs generate a lot of heat and thus require
a cooling fan and heat sink assembly to avoid overheat-
ing (see Figure 3.36). A heat sink is a big slab of copper or
aluminum that helps draw heat away from the proces-
sor. The fan then blows the heat out into the case. You
can usually remove this cooling device if you need to re-
place it, although some CPU manufacturers have sold
CPUs with a fan permanently attached.
CPUs have a make and model, just like automobiles
do. When talking about a particular car, for example,
most people speak in terms of a Ford Taurus or a Toyota
Camry. When they talk about CPUs, people say Intel
Core i7 or AMD Phenom. Over the years, there have
been only a few major CPU manufacturers, just as there
are only a few major auto manufacturers. The two most
common makes of CPUs used in PCs are AMD and Intel.
Although only a few manufacturers of CPUs have
existed, those manufacturers have made hundreds of
models of CPUs. Some of the more common models
made over the past few years have names such as Core 2,
Core i7, Celeron, Athlon, and Phenom.
Finally, CPUs come in a variety of packages. The
package defines how the CPU looks physically and how
it connects to the computer. Intel CPUs currently use a
package type called land grid array (LGA), and AMD likes
pin grid array (PGA). Every CPU package type has a num-
ber of versions and each type is designed to fit into a par-
ticular connection called a socket. Sockets have such
names as Socket AM3 or Socket B. Figure 3.37 shows a
CPU with its matching socket.
Chapter 5, “Learning CPUs,” goes into great detail
on CPUs, but for now remember that every CPU has a
make, a model, and a package type.
RAM
Random access memory (RAM) stores programs and data
currently being used by the CPU. The maximum amount
of programs and data that a piece of RAM can store is
measured in units called bytes. Modern PCs have many
millions, even billions, of bytes of RAM, so RAM is mea-
sured in units called megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). An
average PC will have from 1 to 4 GB of RAM, although
PCs may have more or less RAM. Each piece of RAM is called a stick. One
common type of stick found in today’s PC is called a dual inline memory mod-
ule (DIMM). Figure 3.38 shows two examples of DIMMs used in PCs.
Your PC takes only one type of DIMM, and you must know the type so
you can add or replace RAM when needed. Chapter 6, “Learning RAM,”
covers everything you need to know to work comfortably with RAM.

Some parts of your PC are
much more sensitive to ESD
than others. Your CPU and RAM
are very sensitive to ESD. If you
touch the metal parts of your
CPU or RAM and you have even
the tiniest amount of charge,
you can destroy them.

Motherboard
You can compare a motherboard to the chassis of an
automobile. In a car, everything connects to the chassis
either directly or indirectly. In a PC, everything
connects
to
the
motherboard
either
directly
or
indirectly. A motherboard is a thin, flat piece of circuit
board, usually green or gold, and often slightly larger
than a typical piece of notebook paper (see Figure 3.39).
A motherboard contains a number of special sockets
that accept various PC components. The CPU and
RAM, for example, plug directly into the motherboard.
Other devices, such as floppy drives, hard drives, CD
and DVD drives, connect to the motherboard sockets
through short cables. Motherboards also provide
onboard connectors for external devices such as mice,
printers, joysticks, and keyboards.
All motherboards use multipurpose expansion slots
in which you can add adapter cards. Different types of
expansion slots exist for different types of cards (see
Figure 3.40).
Power Supply
The power supply, as its name implies, provides the nec-
essary electrical power to make the PC operate. The
power supply takes standard electrical power and con-
verts it into power your PC can use. Most power sup-
plies are about the size of a shoebox cut in half and are
usually a gray or metallic color (see Figure 3.41).
A number of connectors lead out of the power sup-
ply. Every power supply provides special connectors to
power the motherboard and a number of other general-
use connectors that provide power to any device that needs electricity.
Check out Chapter 8, “Learning PC Power,” for more information.

Floppy Drive
The floppy drive enables you to access removable floppy
disks (diskettes). The floppy drive used in PCs today is a
3.5-inch floppy drive. Floppy drives only store a tiny
amount of data and have all but disappeared from PCs.
The floppy drive’s data connection to the computer is
via a ribbon cable, which in turn connects to the mother-
board. The connection to the motherboard is known as
the floppy drive controller (Figure 3.42).
Hard Drive
A hard drive stores programs and data that are not currently being used by
the CPU. Although RAM storage is measured in megabytes and gigabytes, a
PC’s hard drive stores much more data than a typical PC’s RAM—hundreds
of gigabytes to terabytes. A terabyte is 1000 gigabytes.
An average PC has one hard drive, although most PCs accept more.
Special PCs that need to store large amounts of data, such as a large cor-
poration’s main file-storage computer, can contain many hard drives—8 to
16 drives in some cases.
The two most common types of hard drives seen in today’s PCs are the
older Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment (PATA) and the more modern
Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA). PATA drives use a ribbon ca-
ble very similar to the one used by floppy drives, whereas SATA drives use
a very narrow cable. Figure 3.43 shows a SATA drive (left) next to a PATA
drive (right). Most motherboards come with connections for both types of
drives.
Optical drives use the same PATA or SATA connections used with hard
drives. Figure 3.44 shows a DVD drive sharing a single ribbon cable with a
PATA hard drivea common sight inside a PC.
Optical Drives
Optical drives enable a computer to read one or more types of optical discs,
such as CD, DVD, or Blu-ray Disc (Figure 3.45). CDs store around 700 MB

Tech Tip
SCSI
A very few PCs use small com-
puter system interface (SCSI)
drives. SCSI drives are generally
faster and more expensive, so
they usually show up only in
high-end PCs such as network
servers or graphics workstations.
• Figure 3.44
Hard drive and DVD drive

and come in three varieties: CD-ROM (read only memory:
you can’t change the data on them), CD-R (recordable: you
can change the data once), and CD-RW (rewritable: you can
change the data on them over and over). DVDs store
much more datathe smallest capacity DVDs store
around 4 GB, enough for a Hollywood movieand come
in even more varieties: DVD-ROM, DVD+R, DVD-R,
DVD+RW, and DVD-RW, just to name the more famous
ones. Blu-ray Discs are popular for high-definition mov-
ies, but there are also Blu-ray Discs for storing data with
capacities starting at 25 GB.
All of these optical discs require an optical drive that
knows how to read them. If you want to do anything
with a CD-RW disc, for example, you need a CD-RW
drive. If you want to use a DVD+R disc, you need a
DVD+R drive. Luckily, most optical drives support
many different types of discs, and some support every
common type of optical disc available. Figure 3.46
shows typical optical drives. Note that some of them ad-
vertise what disc types they use. Others give no clue
whatsoever.
Know Your Parts
The goal of this chapter was to get you to appreciate the names and func-
tions of the various parts of the PC: peripherals, connectors, and compo-
nents. By starting with the Big Picture view, you may now begin breaking
down the individual components on a chapter-by-chapter basis and truly
understand at great depth how each component works and how it intercon-
nects with the PC system as a whole.

Chapter 3 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about the visible PC.
Describe how the PC works
■
The two parts of the PC—hardware and software—
work intimately together to enable you to do work.
■
The computer tech knows the four stages of
computing: input, processing, output, and storage.
Understanding how the various pieces of hardware
and software interact in each stage enables you to
master the art of the PC tech.
Identify all the connectors and devices on a typical PC
system unit
■
Most computers have a standard set of peripherals
to provide input and output. Typical devices
include the monitor, keyboard, mouse, speakers,
and printer.
■
PCs use many kinds of external connectors, but
most fit into one of six major types: mini-DIN, USB,
FireWire, DB, RJ, and mini-audio. A plug goes into
a port or jack. Connectors are often identified by
their shape (such as DB connectors that look like a
capital D), by their gender (male or female), and by
the number of pins. Most PCs have two round
mini-DIN connectors, one for the keyboard and the
other for the mouse.
■
Universal serial bus (USB) connectors come in
three sizes, A, B, and mini-B. Many devices plug
into USB ports, including keyboards and cameras.
USB is hot-swappable, so you may insert or
remove devices without restarting the computer.
■
Also known as IEEE 1394, the FireWire interface is
perfect for high-speed devices such as digital video
cameras. PCs rarely have built-in 4- or 6-wire
FireWire connectors, so users typically purchase a
FireWire adapter card.
■
DB connectors come in a variety of sizes, but only
one shape. You’ll find only a few DB connectors on
modern PCs, primarily for printers and video.
■
The telephone jack is an RJ connector, called an RJ-11.
Most network cards have a wider RJ-45 jack.
■
Speakers and microphones connect to mini-audio
jacks. You’ll always find these on the back of the
system unit; newer models have connectors on the
front as well.
■
Keyboards connect into either a dedicated mini-
DIN keyboard port or a USB port. Monitors
connect to VGA or DVI ports. Mice and trackballs
use the mini-DIN or USB ports as well. Keeping
with the same trend, printers come in one of two
common varieties: those that plug into a DB-25
port and those that plug into a USB port. A joystick
plugs into either a 15-pin female DB port or a USB
port.
Discuss the major internal components of a PC
■
Everything fits inside or connects to the case, more
technically called a system unit. The system unit
provides the framework for buttons, lights, drives,
access doors, and so forth. Opening the case is
usually a matter of unscrewing screws and pulling
one side open.
■
The central processing unit (CPU), also called the
microprocessor or brain of the computer, has a
make, a model, a speed, and a package. AMD and
Intel are the two most common makers of CPUs.
CPU speed is measured in megahertz (MHz) or
gigahertz (GHz). The pin grid array (PGA) is the
most common CPU package. A CPU cooling fan or
heat sink is essential to dissipate the heat.
■
Random access memory (RAM) contains the
current programs and data that the CPU is using.
Most PC memory is installed on sticks called dual
inline memory modules (DIMMs). RAM capacity is
measured in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB).
■
The motherboard contains soldered components,
expansion slots, and sockets for the CPU, RAM,
and other components. Expansion slots are
connectors for expansion cards that enable optional
devices to communicate with the PC.
Chapter 3: The Visible PC
57

■
A floppy drive uses a ribbon cable to connect to the
floppy drive controller on the motherboard. The
most common type is the 3.5-inch floppy drive.
■
Hard drives store programs and data that the CPU
is not currently using. An average PC has one hard
drive, although most PCs accept more. Most PCs
use either PATA or SATA drives, both of which
commonly connect to controllers built into the
motherboard.
■
Optical drives enable the computer to access
optical discs. Some optical drives can record CDs,
such as the compact disc-recordable (CD-R) or the
compact disc-rewritable (CD-RW) drives. Most PCs
now have digital versatile disc (DVD) drives that
support capacities large enough for a full-length
movie.

A
s a tech, you need to understand Windows at a level beyond that of
regular users. This chapter introduces you to some of the more powerful
aspects of Windows, such as NTFS and the Registry. Not only must techs run
through the standard Windows features that everyone uses every day (Start
button, Recycle Bin, and so on), they must also be comfortable drilling down
underneath that user-friendly surface to get their hands a little dirty.
This chapter begins by introducing and organizing the many variations of
Windows on the market today and helping you appreciate the difference
between, for example, Windows XP Home and Windows Vista Ultimate. The
chapter then takes you through the Windows interface in detail. The third
section looks more closely at the techie aspects of Windows, including some of
the powerful, built-in tools that enable you to modify and tweak your operating
system to your heart’s content. The fourth section provides an overview of a
few more tools used to maintain a functional Windows install. The chapter
closes with a section on optimizing Windows for maximum performance. Let’s
get started!

■A Brief History of Microsoft
Windows
Many users think of Windows as a monolithic thing, as the operating system
(OS) for the PC (as opposed to the Macintosh), but as a tech you need to un-
derstand that Microsoft produces many varieties of the OS, each with spe-
cific tools, utilities, file structures, and interfaces. And you need to be able to
navigate through any modern version of Windows fluidly.
Microsoft currently supports seven families of Windows, of which three
concern the CompTIA A+ certified technician: Windows 2000, Windows
XP, and Windows Vista. Within each of these families—my word, not
Microsoft’s—Windows comes in multiple versions. Table 4.1 presents the
list for the top three.
The problem of variety is compounded the minute you start working
with older computers or talking with users or techs who’ve been in comput-
ers for a few years. You’ll hear about Windows 95, for example, or Windows
Me, or even Windows 3.x. Huh? What are these versions (Figure 4.1)? How
do they fit in the picture?
This section outlines the history of Microsoft Windows and then takes
an in-depth look at the differences among the many versions of Microsoft’s
flagship operating system. That way you can sort out the essentials for to-
day’s techs from the many varieties you’ll hear about.
Microsoft entered the operating system game in the early 1980s with a
command-line OS called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS.
With a command-line OS, you interacted with the computer to run pro-
grams and save files and all the other computing functions by typing and
then pressing the ENTER key on your keyboard. This whole typing thing
worked for people who could memorize commands and such, but alterna-
tive operating systems, such as the Apple Macintosh, offered a visual inter-
face, where you could interact with the computer by clicking on pictures.

system designed for the developing world and is not sold in developed countries. Vista Enterprise is a version of Vista Business designed for large-volume
customers and is only sold to Microsoft’s enterprise-level customers.
Table 4.1
Versions of Windows on the CompTIA A+ Essentials Exam

The time came for Microsoft to step up its game and produce a graphical
user interface (GUI) where users could use a mouse to point and click.
Early Windows
The earliest version of Windows, Microsoft Windows 1.0, dates from 1985
and was little more than a graphical overlay of the DOS command-line oper-
ating system. This overlay version of Windows went through a number of
updates, ending with the first truly pop-
ular version of Windows, Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1 (Figure 4.2).
In 1989, Microsoft offered a com-
pletely separate version of Windows
called Windows NT. Windows NT was
a true graphical operating system and
was dramatically more powerful than
the Windows overlay versions. Win-
dows NT also cost more than other ver-
sions of Windows, however, and saw
little adoption outside of servers and
systems where users needed a lot of
power. Windows NT went through a
number of versions, culminating with
Windows NT 4.0 in 1996 (Figure 4.3).
Comparing Windows NT to the old
overlay versions of Windows is akin to
comparing the first computer game you
ever played to the games you play to-
day: technically the same thing (a
game), but that’s about it. Windows NT

• Figure 4.1
Lots of Windows!
Microsoft released several
versions of Windows 3.1, with
minor differences in name.
Techs call the versions collec-
tively Windows 3.x.
• Figure 4.2
Windows for Workgroups

had so many features that
showing them all could
take days, but one is im-
portant. NT came with a
new way to organize hard
drives and files, called the
NT File System (NTFS). Be-
fore NTFS, all versions of
Windows used an ancient
file system called the file
allocation table (FAT). FAT
was great when first in-
vented in the late 1970s,
but by the mid-80s it was
showing its age. NTFS took
care of a number of prob-
lems, the biggest of which
was security. FAT had no
security. There was no way
to control what people did
with your files. NTFS was
built from the ground up
with
security
in
mind.
We’ll cover both FAT and
NTFS later in the book, but
for now appreciate that
only Windows NT had NTFS.
It wasn’t until 1995 that Microsoft dumped the overlay concept and in-
troduced Windows 95, the first version of Windows for the standard user
that was also a full-blown operating system (Figure 4.4). Windows 95 of-
fered many improvements over Windows 3.x, and eventually Microsoft re-
leased several upgraded versions as well, such as Windows 98, Windows 98
SE, and Windows Me. The upgraded versions continued to use the FAT file
system. Over the years, Windows has gone through massive changes and a
large number of improved versions. The later versions have nothing in com-
mon with earlier versions other than the name “Windows.”
Modern Windows
The vast majority of computers in the field today run one of the three mod-
ern families of Windows, so the CompTIA A+ certification focuses on those
as well: Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista. But as you know
from Table 4.1 at the beginning of this chapter, just saying the name of a
Windows family doesn’t do the varieties within that family justice. The trick
is to organize these versions in such a way to discover their similarities and
differences. In this section, we’ll look at versions of Windows 2000, XP, and
Vista, as well as a few other versions of Windows, and see the differences in
detail.
A great place to start is with the arrival of Windows 2000 in 2001.
Throughout most of the 1990s, before Windows 2000 came along (followed
very quickly by Windows XP), Windows was in a bit of a mess. Microsoft

had two totally different operating systemseach called Windowsthat it
sold for two different markets. Microsoft sold the Windows 9x series for the
home user and small office, and the much more powerful Windows NT se-
ries for corporate environments.
Windows 2000
Windows 2000 was the first step toward changing this mess. It was based on
the old Windows NT (including support for NTFS), but for the first time it
included a great interface, provided support for dang near any program,
and was substantially easier to use than the old Windows NT. Microsoft
originally presented Windows 2000 as a replacement for Windows NT, but
its stability and ease of use motivated many knowledgeable Windows 9x us-
ers to upgrade to Windows 2000. Windows 2000 started to appear as “the
single Windows to replace all the other versions.”
Windows 2000 came in two versions: Professional and Server. The
CompTIA A+ Essentials exam does not cover Windows Server versions, but
a good tech should at least know that these server versions exist. If you were
to look at the Windows 2000 Server desktop, you’d be hard pressed to see
any obvious differences from the Windows 2000 Professional version. Don’t
let Windows 2000 Server fool you (Figure 4.5). Windows Server is a heavy-
duty version, loaded with extra software and features that make it superb
for running an office server. Windows Server versions are also extremely ex-
pensive, costing on average of around $200 per computer that accesses the
server.

Windows 95—The Windows of your forefathers
Windows 2000 was the last
version of Windows to come in
both Server and Professional
versions. After the release of
Windows XP, Microsoft intro-
duced the next version of Win-
dows Server as Server 2003.
Windows Server 2008 is the lat-
est version of Windows Server.

Windows XP
Windows XP came hot on the heels of Windows 2000. Under the hood, XP
was basically the same as Windows 2000 but added a dramatically im-
proved interface and a number of new features, such as a built-in CD writer.
Microsoft also broke with the beauty of 2000’s “one OS for everyone” idea.
Microsoft visualized three types of users—professionals, home users, and
media junkies—so Windows XP came in several versions, such as Windows
XP Professional, Windows XP Home, and Windows XP Media Center.
Windows XP Professional
Microsoft Windows XP Professional is, in many
people’s opinions, the most versatile and therefore the most mainstream
version of Windows XP. Microsoft tuned Windows XP Professional for of-
fice environments with many users sharing lots of data and multiple users
sharing single computers. Windows XP Professional provides full-blown
data security, and it is the only version of Windows XP with the capability of
logging on to a special Windows Server–controlled network called a domain.
A Windows domain is a group of networked computers all under the
control of a single computer running some version of Windows Server.
Users on a domain can make a single login to their computer that defines ev-
erything they can do on every other computer on the domain. (See Chapter
16, “Learning Local Area Networking,” for all the details of the amazing
Windows domain.) Figure 4.6 shows a typical Windows XP Professional
desktop.

Windows XP Home
As its name implies, Windows XP Home is designed
for the home and small-office user. Windows XP Home is a stripped-down
version of XP Professional. The best way to describe Windows XP Home is
to list the Windows XP Professional features that Windows XP Home lacks.
Windows XP Home does not have
■
The ability to log on to a Windows domain
A Windows Home PC
may log in to any single Windows server, but you must have a user
name and password on every single server. With a domain, you can
have one user name and password that works on all computers that
are members of the domain.
■
Encrypting file system
With Windows XP Professional, you can
encrypt a file or a folder so that only you can read it. Windows XP
Home lacks this feature.
■
Support for multiple processors
Windows XP Home does not
support more than one physical CPU. Windows XP Professional
supports two separate CPUs.
■
Support for Remote Desktop
A Windows XP Professional PC may
be remotely accessed from another computer by using Remote
Desktop (Figure 4.7). You cannot access a Windows XP Home
system in this fashion.
■
Support for NTFS Access Control
The NTFS file system is capable
of powerful controls on what users may do to a file or folder.
Windows XP Home doesn’t give you the ability to control these
NTFS permissions individually. When you look at the properties of

physical CPUs, not the number
of cores in a single CPU. See
Chapter 5, “Learning CPUs,” for
details on multicore CPUs.

a file or folder in Windows XP Home, you’ll notice that there is no
Security tab. Instead, Windows XP Home’s Sharing tab (Figure 4.8)
shows that only one folder, the Shared Documents folder, is
open for sharingvery different from XP Professional.
■
Support for group policies
Do you need to keep users from
using a certain program? Do you want to prevent them from
changing the screensaver? What do you want to do if they try to
log in three times unsuccessfully? That’s the job of group
polices. Well, if you want this level of control on your system,
get Windows XP Professional, because XP Home doesn’t
support them. Group policies are discussed in Chapter 19,
“Learning Computer Security.”
A few more differences exist between Windows XP Professional
and XP Home, but these are the ones you’re most likely to run into. Ba-
sically, if you want serious control of the folders, files, users, and net-
work, you need XP Professional.
Windows XP Media Center
Microsoft Media Center is a specialized
XP version that includes the very handy Windows Media Center pro-
gram (Figure 4.9). Media Center is a Personal Video Recorder (PVR)
program that enables you to watch and record television (you’ll need a
TV tuner card) and organize all of your media, from photos to music.
On the Microsoft Media Center Web site, Microsoft declares that
the Windows XP Microsoft Media Center edition is based on Windows

XP Professional; however, other than the Media Cen-
ter program, Windows XP Media Center’s capabilities
are identical to those of Windows XP Home.
Windows Vista
Even though Windows 7 is available, Windows Vista
is the latest version of Windows covered on the cur-
rent CompTIA A+ Essentials exam. It’s important to
recognize Vista and know what choices you have
when deciding which version of Vista you need for a
particular PC. Windows has a number of versions of
Vista, each geared toward a particular market seg-
ment. Let’s look at the most common versions of Vista.
Windows Vista Home Basic
Windows Vista Home
Basic is roughly equivalent to Windows XP Home.
Microsoft gears it to home users not needing more ad-
vanced multimedia support.
Windows Vista Home Premium

Vista Home Premium is the same as Win-
dows Vista Home Basic, but it adds an up-
graded

application, similar to the one found in
Windows XP Media Center (Figure 4.10).
Windows Vista Business
Windows Vista
Business is the basic business version and
has all the security, file-sharing, and ac-
cess controls seen in Windows XP Profes-
sional.
Windows Vista Ultimate
Windows Vista
Ultimate combines all of the features of
every other Vista version and includes
some other features, such as a game per-
formance tweaker and DVD ripping capa-
bility (Figure 4.11).
Enter 64-bit Windows
From roughly 1986 to around 2001, all CPUs were 32-bit. While we will save
the big discussion of what 32-bit means for Chapter 5, “Learning CPUs,” for
now let’s keep it simple: a 32-bit CPU can only use a maximum of 4 giga-
bytes of RAM (232 = 4,294,967,296). Starting in 2001 we began to see 64-bit
CPUs that could accept more than 4 gigabytes. 64-bit CPUs are now ex-
tremely common.
The leap from 32-bit to 64-bit processing has a number of advantages.
The really big compelling reason to go from 32-bit to 64-bit is that 64-bit
CPUs support more than 4 gigabytes of RAM. The more RAM you have, the
more programs—and the bigger the programs—your system will run. Until
fairly recently, not too many of us cared to go above 4 gigabytes of RAM.

CPUs and 32- and 64-bit pro-
cessing are covered in much
greater detail in Chapter 5,
“Learning CPUs.”

We didn’t need the RAM and we didn’t have a CPU that could run at 64 bits.
My, how things have changed over the past few years!
The 64-bit CPUs first showed up with the Intel Itanium back in 2001. At
that time the only folks interested in 64-bit processing were large data cen-
ters and a few organizations that needed to crunch big numbers. To run a
computer with an Itanium, you needed an operating system that worked
with a 64-bit processor. Up to this point, every version of Windows only ran
at 32 bits. Microsoft answered the call by creating special 64-bit versions of
Windows 2000 and XP, but these 64-bit versions of Windows 2000 were very
rare.
In 2003, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) started to ship the popular
Athlon 64 CPU. This CPU could run in either 32-bit or 64-bit mode, making
64-bit a realistic option for most of us. Intel followed AMD around 2004 with
Pentium 4 CPUs also capable of 32-bit or 64-bit processing. Since then, al-
most every CPU sold by Intel or AMD has the ability to run in either 32-bit
or 64-bit mode. Moving from the 32-bit to the 64-bit world is easy, but only if
you have a version of Windows to support 64-bit. Microsoft has multiple
versions of Windows designed to support 64-bit CPUs.
Windows XP 64-bit Versions
The 64-bit-only version of Windows XP was called Windows XP 64-bit Edi-
tion (apparently Microsoft decided not to get cute when naming that one).
Given that it only worked on Intel Itanium processors, the chance of your
seeing this operating system is pretty small unless you decide to work in a
place with powerful server needs. The Windows XP Professional x64
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows

Vista Ultimate
Remember for the exam that
32-bit CPUs can support up to
4 GB of RAM. In concept, 64-bit
CPUs can support up to
16 exabytes of memory, al-
though you certainly won’t find
that much memory in the typical
PC.
Tech Tip
Four-Gigabyte Limit
All 32-bit versions of Windows
support a maximum of 4 giga-
bytes of RAM. If your PC has
more than 4 gigabytes and you’re
not running 64-bit Windows,
you might as well remove any
RAM above 4 gigabytes. You’re
wasting it!

Edition is much more common, as it runs on any AMD or Intel processor
that supports both 32 and 64 bits (Figure 4.12).
Windows XP 64-bit versions have had some impact, as they were the
first stable Windows versions that truly supported 64-bit processing, but it
was the introduction of Microsoft Vista that really started the move into the
64-bit world.
Windows Vista 64-bit Versions
Every one of the earlier listed Vista versions comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit ver-
sions. As we move into PCs with more than 4 gigabytes of RAM, it’s important
to make sure your version of Windows is a 64-bit version (Figure 4.13).
Transitioning to 64-bit Windows
Techs use the x# terminology to describe a particular computer architecture,
implying that there is some compatibility within that architecture. This mat-
ters because people need some comfort that the software they purchase will
work properly with the computer they have. The transition from 32-bit ver-
sions of Windows to 64-bit versions of Windows requires a certain update in
terminology.
x86 versus x64
Intel originally used numbers to name its CPUs, such as
8086, 80286, 80386, and so on. To talk about them collectively, the industry re-
placed the leading numbers with an x and kept the numbers that stayed consis-
tent for all the processors, thus x86 describes the Intel CPU architecture for PCs.
All the 32-bit versions of Windows were designed to run on x86 architecture.
72
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 4.12
Windows XP Professional x64 Edition
Windows 7 is not covered on
the CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam, but you should still know
it. Every version of Windows 7
comes in 32-bit and 64-bit on the
same installation disc.

The
move
to
64-bit
CPUs and, equally impor-
tant, to 64-bit versions of
Windows required some
sort of change in terminol-
ogy. Microsoft and others
picked up the x# terminol-
ogy and changed it to mar-
ket 64-bit-only versions of
their software, branding
the 64-bit software as x64.
A
consumer,
therefore,
could look at a product
such as Windows XP Pro-
fessional x64 Edition and
very quickly know that
the software was designed
for
64-bit
CPUs
rather
than 32-bit CPUs.
The two x# uses—x86
and
x64—don’t
really
compare, but that’s okay.
Computer people love the
letter X almost as much as
car manufacturers do.
Software Compatibility
Transitions to updated ar-
chitecture,
such
as
the
change from x86 to x64,
create concern among users, because they fear that their old programs won’t
run or will run poorly, or that they’ll have problems with compatibility
down the road. Techs need to allay those fears by educating users properly.
Here’s the scoop in a nutshell.
Most of the 64-bit processors run either 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Win-
dows without missing a beat. The 64-bit versions of Windows require a 64-
bit CPU; they snicker at 32-bit (or x86) processors and refuse to play. Many
companies have produced 64-bit versions of application software that only
work with 64-bit Windows running with a 64-bit CPU. Great, right? But
what about all those 32-bit applications out there working for a living? It
gets interesting.
Windows Vista 64-bit versions support most 32-bit applications, some-
times without any user intervention and sometimes through explicit use of
the Windows compatibility mode options. (Just for the record, you some-
times need to use Windows compatibility mode options to run older pro-
grams on Windows Vista 32-bit versions, so it’s not just a function of 64-bit
support for 32-bit apps.) Windows can try to emulate previous versions of
Windows if an application balks at loading.
To run a program in an emulated version of Windows, you need to ac-
cess the primary executable file that, when double-clicked, makes the pro-
gram run. You may find these files in any one of a countless number of

different places throughout your
computer, but a quick example
should suffice here. A user has a
custom program—called “Widgets
for XP”—designed to take advan-
tage of particular features in Win-
dows XP Professional with Service
Pack 2 installed, but the program
doesn’t work in Windows Vista.
Open Computer and go to C:\
Program Files\Widgets for XP and
look for a file with the type listed as
Application, such as WidgetsXP.exe
(Figure 4.14). Right-click and select
Properties.
On the Compatibility tab, select
the checkbox next to Run this pro-
gram in compatibility mode for: and se-
lect the OS of choice (Figure 4.15). In
this case, you would select Win-
dows XP (Service Pack 2) to provide
optimal compatibility for the appli-
cation. Windows saves the configuration change and tries to open the pro-
gram in compatibility mode each time the program loads.

■The Windows Interface
All versions of Windows share certain characteristics, configuration files,
and general look and feel. Here’s some good news: You’ll find the same, or
nearly the same, utilities in almost all versions of Windows, and once you
master one version—both GUI and command-line interface—you’ll pretty
much have them all covered. This section covers the essentials: where to
find things, how to maneuver, and what common utilities are available.
Where versions of Windows differ in concept or detail, I’ll point that out
along the way. For now, let’s look at the common user interface.
User Interface
Windows offers a set of utilities, or interfaces, that every user should know
about—both how and why to access them. And since every user should
know about them, certainly every CompTIA A+ certified tech should as
well! Let’s take a quick tour of the typical Windows GUI.
Login
Logging in to a Windows computer is something that we all do but few of us
take time to appreciate. Your user name and password define what you can
do on your computer. Every version of Windows supports multiple users
on a single machine, so the starting point for any tour of the Windows user
interface starts with the login screen. Figure 4.16 shows the old, ugly, but
very functional Windows 2000 login screen.
Microsoft improved the login screen in Windows XP, creating a new
type of login called the Welcome screen (Figure 4.17). If you’re using Win-
dows XP Home or Media Center, this is the only login screen you will see.
Windows XP Professional also has the Welcome screen. If you’re running a
Windows XP Professional system that connects to a Windows domain, how-
ever, you go right back to the classic login screen (Figure 4.18).

• Figure 4.16
Windows 2000 login screen

Windows Vista dumped the old login screen entirely. All versions of Win-
dows Vista use an improved version of XP’s Welcome screen (Figure 4.19).
Desktop
The Windows desktop is your primary interface to the computer. The desktop
is always there, underneath whatever applications you have open. The desk-
top analogy appeals to most people—we’re used to sitting down at a desk to
get work done. Figure 4.20 shows a nice, clean Windows XP desktop; note the

ments across the bottom.
You can add folders and
files to the desktop and
customize
the
back-
ground to change its color
or add a picture. Most
people like to do so—
certainly, I do! As an ex-
ample, Figure 4.21 shows
the desktop from my home
system—a Windows Vista
Ultimate PC.
Clearly the Vista desk-
top differs a lot compared
to the Windows XP desk-
top. What you’re seeing is
something called the Aero
desktop. The Aero desk-
top adds a number of im-
pressive aesthetic features
to
your
desktop
that
Microsoft claims make the
user experience more en-
joyable and productive.
I’m not going to get into an argument on the value of the Aero desktop, but it
is an important part of the Windows Vista (and Windows 7) interface. Most
of the Aero features are overly technical—even for the CompTIA A+ ex-
ams—but the end result is a faster, smoother desktop with two interesting
features: transparency and Flip 3D. Transparency, as the name implies, gives
an adjustable amount of transparency to the edges of your windowed pro-
grams, as you can see in Figure 4.22.
Flip 3D enables you to view and select all of your open Windows in a 3-D
format, as shown in Figure 4.23. It’s actually very handy once you start
using it.

Flip 3D is fun to use. Press the WINDOWS KEY-TAB key combination to
start it. Keep pressing the key combination to cycle through the windows.
When the window you want is in the forefront, release the keys, and that
window will be the active window on your screen. Try WINDOWS KEY-TAB-
SHIFT to scroll through your windows in the opposite direction.
To use the Aero desktop, you must have a video card that supports
Aero. We’ll save the in-depth discussion for Chapter 13, “Learning Video
and Multimedia,” but for now here’s what Microsoft says your video needs:
■
DirectX 9 capability or better
■
At least 128 megabytes of video RAM
■
Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) driver
■
Pixel Shader version 2.0
Now that you know what you need (again, these will be covered in de-
tail in Chapter 13), here’s the easy way. When you install Vista, the installer
checks your video to determine if it can support Aero. If your video card is
capable, Aero is turned on automatically.
On an installed system, press the WINDOWS KEY-TAB combination. If Flip
3D appears, you have Aero. If it doesn’t, Aero is not active.
To turn on Aero, right-click on your desktop and select the Personalize
menu option. Next, select Window Color and Appearance. If you see a
screen that looks like Figure 4.24, you already have Aero running. If you see
a screen that looks like Figure 4.25, select the Windows Aero color scheme to
activate the Aero desktop.
If you’re running Aero, note that the Window Color and Appearance
screen shown in Figure 4.24 has a slider to adjust the transparency settings
and a checkbox to turn transparency off completely.

Tech Tip
Upgrade Time!
If you can’t run on the Aero desk-
top, you need to upgrade your
system to meet the minimum
requirements. This usually means
a new video card or updated video
card drivers. See Chapter 13,
“Learning Video and Multime-
dia,” for details.

Taskbar and Start Menu
The taskbar runs along the
bottom
of
all
Windows
desktops and includes up
to four sections (depending
on the version of Windows
and your configuration).
Starting at the left side,
these are the Start button,
the Quick Launch toolbar,

the running programs area, and the notification area. Although the taskbar
by default sits at the bottom of the desktop, you can move it to either side or
to the top of the screen.
One of the main jobs of the taskbar is to show the Start button, probably
the most clicked button on all Windows systems. You can find the Start but-
ton on the far left end of the taskbar. Figure 4.26 shows the Start buttons for
Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista (in order). Click the Start
button to bring up the Start menu, where you can see the applications in-
stalled on the system and start them. Now, move your mouse cursor onto
the All Programs (Windows XP) or Programs (all other versions) menu
item. When the All Programs/Programs menu appears, move the cursor to
the Accessories menu. Locate the Notepad program and click it. By default,
Windows hides lesser-used menu options, so if you don’t see Notepad, click
the double down arrows at the bottom of the Accessories menu to make
Notepad appear.
Great! If you opened Notepad properly, you should see something like
Figure 4.27, with Notepad displaying an untitled text page. Notice how
Notepad shows up on the taskbar at the bottom of your screen. Most run-
ning programs appear on the taskbar in this way. Close the Notepad pro-
gram by clicking on the button with the X in the upper-right corner of the
Notepad window. Look again at the taskbar to see that Notepad no longer
appears there.
Now look all the way to the right end of the taskbar. This part of the
taskbar is known officially as the notification area, though many techs and
the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam call it the system tray. You will at a mini-
mum see the current time displayed in the system tray, and on most Win-
dows systems you’ll also see a number of small icons there. Figure 4.28
shows the system tray on my PC.
These icons show programs running in the background. Most programs
run in a window. Background programs function like any other program ex-
cept they do not use a window, simply because the nature of their particular
jobs makes a window unnecessary. Thousands of programs like to run in the
system tray: network status, volume controls, battery state (on laptops), and
removable device status are just a few examples. What shows up on yours

depends on your version of Windows, what hardware you use, and what
background programs you have installed. Some of the icons in Figure 4.28, for
example, include my antivirus program, a handy notification program for in-
coming Facebook and Twitter messages, and my UPS program.
Near the left end of the taskbar, next to the Start button, you will find the
Quick Launch toolbar (Figure 4.29), a handy extra where you can select often-
used programs with a single click. On Windows XP systems, the Quick
Launch toolbar is not displayed on the taskbar by default, so before you can
use this convenient feature, you must right-click the taskbar, select Prop-
erties, and check Show Quick Launch. To change the contents of the Quick
Launch toolbar, simply drag icons onto or off of it.
The Many Faces of Windows Explorer
Windows Explorer enables you to manipulate files and folders stored on all
the drives in or connected to your computer. Microsoft presents the tool in a
variety of ways to help you focus quickly on what you want to accomplish.
If you want to see the contents of an optical disc, for example, you can open
My Computer (Windows 2000/XP) or Computer (Windows Vista/7) by dou-
ble-clicking the icon on the desktop or selecting the icon from the Start menu
to have Windows Explorer open with the drives displayed (Figure 4.30). To
display the contents of a drive or folder, double-click it.
Windows Explorer in Windows 2000 has a fairly Spartan interface,
whereas Windows XP offers a series of common tasks in a bar along the left
side of the screen, as you can see in Figure 4.30. Windows Vista also offers
tasks, but the options display in a bar below the location bar, near the top of
the window (Figure 4.31).
When you access My Docu-
ments (Windows 2000/XP) or
Documents (Windows Vista/7)
by double-clicking the icon on
the desktop or selecting from the
Start
menu,
Windows
opens
Windows Explorer with your
user folders displayed. Because
your
My
Documents/Docu-
ments folder is stored (by de-
fault)
on
the
C:
hard
drive,
Windows Explorer shows the
contents of that drive, drilled
down specifically to your folders.
The fact that one way to open
Windows Explorer is to double-
click My Computer or Computer,
and another way to open Win-
dows Explorer is to double-click
My Documents or Documents—
and the two methods show differ-
ent contents initially—leads many
users to assume that they have
two distinct tools. That’s simply
not the case. Windows Explorer

changes what’s displayed to suit specific tasks preset by
Microsoft, but it’s a single tool that can point to different loca-
tions on your computer.
Even better, you can change the look of Windows Ex-
plorer by clicking a button. The Folders button in Windows
2000 and Windows XP toggles the Folders list on or off on the
left (Figure 4.32). The Folders list is a tree menu that enables
you to move the focus of Windows Explorer to different fold-
ers or drives. The Folders list replaces the common tasks bar
in Windows XP. Note that the Folders list is enabled by de-
fault in Windows Vista no matter whether you open the tool
through Computer or Documents.
In Windows Vista, you can alter the view of Windows Ex-
plorer in several ways. On the taskbar, you can click the down
arrow next to Views to change the size of the icons, the details
displayed, and more. You can turn off the Folders list if de-
sired by clicking the down arrow next to Organize and then
selecting Layout from the menu options.

The Folders list view makes copying and moving files and folders from
one location to another very easy. The steps differ slightly when you copy to
a folder on the same drive versus when you copy to a folder on a different
drive, although the first step is the same: select a folder in the Folders list,
and the contents of that folder appear in the main pane on the right.
To move or copy a file from one folder to another folder on the same
drive, click and hold a file or folder in the main pane and then drag the cur-
sor over to any folder in the Folders list. A →symbol will appear in Win-
dows Vista and 7, although not in Windows 2000 or XP. Release the mouse
button, and you move that file or
folder to the new folder. If you
want to copy a file or folder rather
than move it, press the CTRL key
on your keyboard and then click
and drag into the desired folder.
The →symbol (if any) changes to a
+; release the mouse button to
copy the file or folder.
To copy or move a file from
one folder to another folder on a
different drive, click and hold a
file or folder in the main pane and
then drag the cursor over to any
folder in the Folders list, and a +
symbol will appear. Release the
mouse button, and you’ll make a
copy of that file or folder in the
new folder. If you want to move a
file or folder rather than just copy
it, press the SHIFT key on your key-
board and then click and drag into
the desired folder. The + symbol
changes to a ? in Windows Vista/7
or just goes away in Windows
2000/XP; release the mouse but-
ton to move the file or folder.
Notice the differences in the
icons displayed in Windows Ex-
plorer? Windows assigns different
icons to different types of files,
based on their extensions, the set
of characters at the end of a file-
name, such as .EXE, .TXT, or .JPG.
The oldest extensions, starting
from back in the DOS era, are usu-
ally three characters, but current
programs may use two-character
extensions, such as .JS (JavaScript)
or .AU (audio), or even four-
character extensions, such as the

You can easily create new
folders in Windows Explorer by
right-clicking inside a folder and
selecting New | Folder from the
context menu. Creating folders
is a great way to keep your files
organized!
Try This!
Practice Moving and Copying
If the Folders list option is new to you and you haven’t done a lot of
moving or copying files or folders, Try This!
1.
Open My Computer or Computer and double-click on the C:
drive.
2.
Right-click in a blank spot and select New | Folder from the
context menu. This will create a new folder named New Folder
by default. The name of the New Folder is highlighted for
changing when you first create it. If you click elsewhere, the
folder gets the default New Folder name.
3.
Select the folder and press F2 or right-click and select Rename
from the options. Change the name to something other than
New Folder, such as temp, tmp, practice, etc. The rest of this
exercise assumes you named the new folder “temp.”
4.
Click the Folders button if necessary to display the Folders list
on the left part of the Windows Explorer screen.
5.
In the Folders list, select the temp folder. The contents of that
folder should be blank in the main pane.
6.
Select any other folder in the Folders list to change the focus of
the main pane.
7.
Hold down the CTRL key and then click and drag a file or folder
from that new folder so that the cursor hovers over the temp
folder and you see the + symbol. Release the mouse button and
then select the temp folder to see the file or folder you just
copied. Note that if you don’t hold the CTRL key down, you’ll
move rather than copy the file.
8.
Try this a few more times to increase your comfort level with
copying.
9.
Move a file or folder from one folder to the temp folder and then
back, verifying that you moved rather than just copied the file.
Do not do this with any files or folders in the C:\Windows
folder! When you move a file in Vista, you’ll see the →appear
before you release the mouse button. In Windows 2000/XP you
won’t see any symbol at all.

ubiquitous .HTML for Web pages. In rare cases, a filename might
actually have no extension.
As you look at these icons on your own screen, some of you might
say, “But I don’t see any extensions!” That’s because Windows hides
them by default. To see the extensions in 2000/XP, select Tools |
Folder Options to open the Folder Options dialog box (Figure 4.33).
Click the View tab and uncheck Hide extensions for known file types. In
Vista, click on Organize | Folder and Search Options | View tab to
see the same dialog box.
There are two other very handy settings under the View tab, but
to see the results well, you need to be in the C: drive of My Computer,
as shown in Figure 4.34.
Go back into the View tab under Folder Options, click the Show
hidden files and folders radio button, and then uncheck Hide protected
operating system files. Click the Apply to Folders button in Windows
Vista, the Apply to All Folders button in Windows XP, or the Apply
button in Windows 2000. Your C: drive should look like Figure 4.35
(it shows the Windows XP version) when you are finished. As before,
when you return to examining the folder contents, you will see the
file extensions, and possibly some previously hidden files.
Now that those files are visible, you have the awesome responsi-
bility of keeping them safe. In general, the less you handle your vital
system files, the better. You’ll learn some ways to do useful things with files
that were previously hidden, but unless you really know what you’re doing,
it’s best to leave them alone. Before you turn a PC over to someone who isn’t
a trained PC tech, you’ll probably want to hide those system files again.
Microsoft has tried to help users organize their files and folders through
various user folders and subfolders that you access through Windows Ex-
plorer. The different operating systems offer different choices, so let’s look
at My Documents and the User’s Files.
My Documents, My [Whatever]
All versions of Windows provide a special
folder structure for each user account so users have their own places to store
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows

personal data. This folder grouping is called My Documents in Win-
dows 2000 and XP. Many Windows programs take advantage of My
Documents and by default store their files in the folder or in a subfolder.
Windows XP installations do not show My Documents on the desk-
top by default. On Windows XP, you can access it readily through the
Start menu, or you can add it to your desktop. Right-click the desktop
and select Properties to open the Display Properties dialog box. Select
the Desktop tab, and then click on the Customize Desktop button to
open the Desktop Items dialog box (Figure 4.36). On the General tab, se-
lect the checkbox next to My Documents, My Computer, or both, and
then click OK to close the dialog box and make any selected icons ap-
pear on the desktop.
Windows XP adds a number of subfolders to My Documents: My
Pictures (which offers filmstrip and thumbnail views of pictures you
store there), My Music (which will fire up Media Player to play any file),
My Videos (which, again, starts Media Player), and more. Figure 4.37
shows My Pictures, using the thumbnail view. Many applications have
since jumped on the bandwagon and added their own My [Whatever]
folders in My Documents. Before I retired my Windows XP machine,
for example, I had My eBooks, My Web Sites, My Received Files, My
Virtual Machines…My Goodness!
User’s Files
Windows Vista takes the equivalent of My Documents to a
whole new level with the User’s Files option. (Although a Documents folder
is available, it’s designed literally for documents, such as text files.) Click on

As with most tools in Win-
dows, Microsoft gives you more

the Start menu and you’ll see a folder option with the user name of the ac-
count that’s currently logged in to the computer. With that option, not only
do you get all of the folders you get in Windows 2000/XP, but Vista also
adds a number of other
folders as well as interest-
ing
but
important
data
such as your Internet Ex-
plorer favorites and copies
of recent searches.
Just as with Windows
XP, the user’s folder does
not show on the desktop
by default. To see this
folder, right-click on the
desktop, select Personal-
ize, and then click Change
desktop icons on the left of
the Personalization win-
dow. You’ll see a Desktop
Icon Settings dialog box
where you can select the
User’s Files option to dis-
play the personal files of
the
logged-in
user
ac-
count. Figure 4.38 shows
the User’s Files folder for
my editor, with the Desk-
top Icon Settings dialog
box in the background.
No matter what your
version of Windows de-
cides to call it, My Documents/
User’s Files is an incredibly critical
part of your computer’s directory
structure. Not only does this store
your most personal (and impor-
tant) documents, it also stores
most of the personalization set-
tings for each user.
The Command Line
Lest you get too comfortable with your nice, shiny GUI, remember that op-
erating systems existed long before PCs were invented. Ancient, massive
computers called mainframes and minicomputers employed sophisticated op-
erating systems. It wasn’t until the late 1970s that IBM went looking for an
OS for a new microcomputer—the official name for the PC—the company
was developing, called the IBM Personal Computer, better known as the PC.
After being rebuffed by a company called Digital Research, IBM went to a
tiny company that had written a popular new version of the programming
language called BASIC. They asked the company president if he could cre-
ate an OS for the IBM PC. Although his company had never actually written

Cross Check
The Computing Process
While you’re reading about the various interface features of Windows,
now would be a good time to review the section “How the PC Works” in
Chapter 3, “The Visible PC,” and put things in context. What are the
four functions of computing? With which function does the operating
system interact? Why is that a trick question?

an OS, he brazenly said “Sure!” That man was Bill Gates, and the tiny com-
pany was Microsoft.
After shaking hands with IBM representatives, Bill Gates hurriedly be-
gan to search for an OS based on the Intel 8086 processor. He found a primi-
tive OS called Quick-and-Dirty Operating System (QDOS), which was written
by a one-man shop, and he purchased it for a few thousand dollars. After
several minor changes, Microsoft released it as MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk
Operating System) version 1.1. Although primitive by today’s standards,
MS-DOS 1.1 could provide all of the functions an OS needed. Over the years,
MS-DOS went through version after version until the last Microsoft version,
MS-DOS 6.22, was released in 1994. Microsoft licensed MS-DOS to PC mak-
ers so they could add their own changes and then rename the program. IBM
called its version PC-DOS.
DOS used a command-line interface. You typed a command at a prompt,
and DOS responded to that command. When Microsoft introduced Win-
dows 95 and Windows NT, many computer users and techs thought that the
command-line interface would go away, but techs not only continued to use
the command line, they also needed it to troubleshoot and fix problems. With
Windows 2000, it seemed once again that the command line would die, but
again, that just didn’t turn out to be the case.
Finally recognizing the importance of the command-line interface,
Microsoft beefed it up in Windows XP and then again in Windows Vista.
The command line in Windows XP and in Vista offers commands and op-
tions for those commands that go well beyond anything seen in previous
Microsoft operating systems.
You can access the command line in Windows 2000 and XP by going to
Start | Run, typing cmd, and pressing ENTER. In Windows Vista/7, you can
simply type cmd in the Start menu Search box and press ENTER.
Recycle Bin
In Windows, a file is not erased when you delete it. Windows adds a level
of protection in the form of a special folder called the Recycle Bin. When
you delete a file in Windows, the file moves into the Recycle Bin. It stays
there until you empty the Recycle Bin or restore the file, or until the Recy-
cle Bin reaches a preset size and starts erasing its oldest contents.
To access the Recycle Bin’s properties, right-click the icon and select
Properties. The Recycle Bin’s properties look different in different ver-
sions of Windows, but they all work basically the same. Figure 4.39
shows the properties of a typical Windows XP Recycle Bin. Note that you
set the amount of drive space to use for the Recycle Bin, 10 percent being
the default amount. If a hard drive starts to run low on space, this is one
of the first places to check.
My Network Places/Network
Systems tied to a network, either via a network cable or by a modem,
have a folder called My Network Places in XP or simply Network in Vista
(Figure 4.40). This shows all the current network connections available to
you. You’ll learn about My Network Places in Chapter 16, “Learning
Local Area Networking.”

Control Panel
Accessed via the Start menu, the Control Panel (Figure 4.41) serves as a home
for all manner of handy Windows applications, called applets, that enable
you to modify Windows settings, create new user accounts, and even
change your mouse cursor! Every tech worth their salt is intimately familiar
with the Control Panel, so you’ll be seeing a lot of it over the course of your
CompTIA A+ Essentials exam preparation. If that sounds intimidating,
don’t worry. While there are quite a few applets in the Control Panel by de-
fault, you only really need to know about a handful of them, so the job is not
quite as herculean as you might at first fear. In addition to all the default ap-
plets, some software ap-
plications that you install
on your computer will
add even more applets to
the Control Panel, and the
CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam definitely doesn’t
cover those.

ful of Gadgets, but developers have gone crazy with them, enabling you to

■Advanced Windows Features
In addition to the basics of the user interface, the CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam expects you to know a few of Windows’ more advanced features. Af-
ter all, while you definitely need to know how to identify and navigate the
various parts of the Windows interface, that information is only a tiny frac-
tion of what you need to know to use the Windows operating system effec-
tively. This section will familiarize you with a few powerful Windows
features that you’ll need to know about as a tech. Most of the information in
this section applies to every version of Windows covered by the CompTIA
A+ Essentials exam, but I’ll point out differences wherever they arise.
Registry
The Registry is a huge database that stores everything about your PC, in-
cluding information on all of the hardware in the PC, network information,
user preferences, file types, and virtually anything else you might run into
with Windows. Almost any form of configuration you do to a Windows sys-
tem involves editing the Registry. Every version of Windows stores the nu-
merous Registry files (called hives) in the \%SystemRoot%\System32\
config folder. Fortunately, you rarely have to access these massive files di-
rectly. Instead, you can use a set of relatively tech-friendly applications to
edit the Registry.
The CompTIA A+ Essentials exam does not expect you to memorize ev-
ery aspect of the Windows Registry. You should, however, understand the
basic components of the Registry, know how to edit the Registry manually,
and know the best way to locate a particular setting.
Accessing the Registry
Before you look in the Registry, let’s look at how you access the Registry di-
rectly by using a Registry editor. Once you know that, you can open the Reg-
istry on your machine and compare what you see to the examples in this
chapter.
Windows 2000 comes with two Registry editors: REGEDT32.EXE, shown
in Figure 4.43, and the much older REGEDIT.EXE, shown in Figure 4.44. You
start either of these programs by going to a command prompt and typing its
filename.
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
91
I’ve covered only the most
basic parts of the Windows
desktop in this chapter. The typi-
cal Windows desktop includes
many other parts, but for techs
and for the CompTIA A+ Essen-
tials exam, what you’ve learned
here about the desktop is more
than enough.

The reason for having two
different Registry editors is
long and boring, and explain-
ing it would require a very dull
15-minute monologue (prefer-
ably with an angelic chorus
singing in the background)
about
how
the
Registry
worked in Windows 9x and
Windows NT. Suffice it to say
that in Windows 2000, only
REGEDT32 is safe to use for ac-
tual editing, but you can use
the older REGEDIT to perform
searches, because REGEDT32’s
search capabilities are not very
good.
Starting with Windows XP,
Microsoft eliminated the entire
two-Registry-editor nonsense
by creating a new REGEDT32
that
includes
strong
search
functions. No longer are there
two separate programs, but interestingly, entering either REGEDIT or
REGEDT32 at a command prompt brings up the same program, so feel free
to use either program name. We can also dispense with calling the Registry
Editor by its filename and use its proper title.
Registry Components
The Registry is organized
in a tree structure similar
to the folders in the PC.
Once you open the Regis-
try Editor in Windows,
you will see five main
subgroups, or root keys:
■
HKEY_CLASSES_
ROOT
■
HKEY_CURRENT_
USER
■
HKEY_USERS
■
HKEY_LOCAL_
MACHINE
■
HKEY_CURRENT_
CONFIG
Try opening one of
these root keys by clicking
on the plus sign to its left;
92
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 4.43
REGEDT32 in Windows 2000
• Figure 4.44
REGEDIT in Windows 2000

note that more subkeys are
listed underneath. A subkey
also has other subkeys, or
values. Figure 4.45 shows an
example of a subkey with
some values. Notice that the
Registry Editor shows keys
on the left and values on the
right, just as Windows Ex-
plorer shows directories on
the left and files on the right.
The secret to under-
standing the Registry is to
understand the function of
the five root keys first.
Each of these root keys
has a specific function, so
let’s take a look at them
individually.
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
This root key defines the standard class objects used by Windows. A class
object is a named group of functions that define what you can do with the
object it represents. Pretty much everything that has to do with files on the
system is defined by a class object. For example, the Registry uses two class
objects to define the popular MP3 sound file. If you search the Registry for
the .MP3 file extension, you will find the first class object, which associates
the .MP3 file extension with the name “Winamp.File” on this computer
(Figure 4.46).
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
93
• Figure 4.45
Typical Registry keys and values
When writing about keys and
values, I’ll use the expression
key = value.
• Figure 4.46
Association of .MP3 with Winamp

Ah, but what are the properties of Winamp.File? That’s what the HKEY_
CLASSES_ROOT root key is designed to handle. Search this section again
for “Winamp.File” (or whatever it said in the value for your MP3 file) and
look for a subkey called
“open.” This variable de-
termines the file associa-
tion (Figure 4.47), which is
the Windows term for
what program to use to
open a particular type of
file.
This subkey tells the
system
everything
it
needs to know about a
particular software item,
from which program to
use to open a file, to the
type of icon used to show
the file, to what to show
when you right-click on
that file type. Although it
is possible to change most
of these settings in the
Registry Editor, the nor-
mal way is to choose more
user-friendly methods. In Windows XP, for example, you can right-click on
a file and select Properties, and then click the Change button on the General
tab to open the Open With dialog box (Figure 4.48). From there you can
browse to select the program you want to use.
HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_USERS
Windows is designed to support more than one user on the same
PC, storing personalized information such as desktop colors,
screensavers, and the contents of the desktop for every user that has
an account on the system. HKEY_CURRENT_USER stores the cur-
rent user settings, and HKEY_USERS stores all of the personalized
information for all users on a PC. While you certainly can change
items such as the screensaver here, the better way is to right-click on
the desktop and select Properties.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
This root key contains all the data for a system’s non-user-specific con-
figurations. This encompasses every device and every program in your
PC. For example, Figure 4.49 shows the description of a DVD drive.
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
If the values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE have more than one op-
tion, such as two different monitors, this root key defines which one
is currently being used. Because most people have only one type of
monitor and similar equipment, this area is almost never touched.

Microsoft Management Console
One of the biggest complaints about earlier versions of Windows was the
wide dispersal of the many utilities needed for administration and trouble-
shooting. Despite years of research, Microsoft could never find a place for all
the utilities that would
please even a small mi-
nority of support people.
In a moment of sheer ge-
nius,
Microsoft
deter-
mined that the ultimate
utility was one that the
support people made for
themselves! This brought
on the creation of the
amazing Microsoft Man-
agement Console.
The Microsoft Manage-
ment Console (MMC) is
simply a shell program in
Windows that holds indi-
vidual
utilities
called
snap-ins. You can start the
MMC by selecting Start |
Run, typing mmc, and
pressing ENTER to get a
blank MMC. Blank MMCs
aren’t much to look at
(Figure 4.50).
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
95
• Figure 4.49
Registry information for a DVD drive
• Figure 4.50

You make a blank MMC useful by adding snap-ins, which include most
of the utilities you use in Windows. Even the good old Device Manager is a
snap-in. You can add as many snap-ins as you like, and you have many to
choose from. Many companies sell third-party utilities as MMC snap-ins.
For example, to add the Device Manager snap-in, open the blank MMC, se-
lect File | Add/Remove Snap-in (Console | Add/Remove Snap-in in Win-
dows 2000), and then click the
Add button to open the Add
Standalone Snap-in dialog box
(in Vista, the Add or Remove
Snap-ins dialog box). Here you
will see a list of available snap-ins
(Figure 4.51). Select Device Man-
ager, and click the Add button to
open a dialog box that prompts
you to choose the local or a re-
mote PC for the snap-in to work
with. Choose Local Computer for
this exercise, and click the Finish
button. Click the Close button to
close the Add Standalone Snap-
in dialog box, and then click OK
to close the Add/Remove Snap-
in dialog box.
You should see Device Man-
ager listed in the console. Click
it. Hey, that looks kind of famil-
iar, doesn’t it (Figure 4.52)?
96
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 4.51
Available snap-ins
• Figure 4.52
Device Manager as a snap-in

Once you’ve added the snap-ins you want, just save the console under
any name, anywhere you want. I’ll save this console as Device Manager, for
example, and drop it on my desktop (Figure 4.53). I’m now just a double-
click away from the Device Manager.
Administrative Tools
Windows combines the most popular snap-ins into an applet in the Control
Panel called Administrative Tools. Open the Control Panel and open Admin-
istrative Tools (Figure 4.54).
Administrative Tools is really just a folder that stores a number of pre-
made consoles. As you poke through these, notice that many of the consoles
share some of the same snap-ins—nothing wrong with that. Of the consoles
in a standard Administrative Tools collection, the ones you’ll spend the
most time with are Computer Management, Event Viewer, Reliability and
Performance (or just Performance in Windows 2000/XP), and Services.
Page File
Windows uses a portion of the hard drive as an extension of system RAM,
through what’s called a RAM cache. A RAM cache is a block of cylinders on a
hard drive set aside as what’s called a page file, swap file, or virtual memory.
When the PC starts running out of real RAM because you’ve loaded too
many programs, the system swaps programs from RAM to the page file,
opening more space for programs currently active. All versions of Windows
use a page file, so here’s how one works.

of these snap-ins, so this book
won’t cover them all. If I don’t
mention it, it’s almost certainly
not on the exam!
The default and recommended
page file size is 1.5 times the
amount of installed RAM on your
computer.

Let’s assume you have a PC with 4 GB of RAM.
Figure 4.55 shows the system RAM as a thermome-
ter with gradients from 0 to 4 GB. As programs
load, they take up RAM, and as more and more
programs are loaded (labeled A, B, and C in the fig-
ure), more RAM is used.
At a certain point, you won’t have enough
RAM to run any more programs (Figure 4.56).
Sure, you could close one or more programs to
make room for yet another one, but you can’t keep
all of the programs running simultaneously. This is
where virtual memory comes into play.
Windows’ virtual memory starts by creating a
page file that resides somewhere on your hard
drive. The page file works like a temporary storage
box. Windows removes running programs tempo-
rarily from RAM into the page file so other pro-
grams can load and run. If you have enough RAM
to run all your programs, Windows does not need
to use the page file—Windows brings the page file
into play only when insufficient RAM is available
to run all open programs.
To load, Program D needs a certain amount of
free RAM. Clearly, this requires unloading some
other program (or programs) from RAM without
actually closing any programs. Windows looks at
all running programs—in this case A, B, and C—
and decides which program is the least used. That
program is then cut out of or swapped from RAM
and copied into the page file. In this case, Windows has chosen Program B
(Figure 4.57). Unloading Program B from RAM provides enough RAM to
load Program D (Figure 4.58).

more RAM

Not enough RAM to load program D
• Figure 4.57
Program B being unloaded from memory
Virtual memory is a fully au-
tomated process and does not
require any user intervention.
Tech intervention is another
story!

It is important to understand that none of this activity is visible on the
screen. Program B’s window is still visible, along with those of all the other
running programs. Nothing tells the user that Program B is no longer in
RAM (Figure 4.59).
So what happens if you click on Program B’s window to bring it to the
front? The program can’t actually run from the page file; it must be loaded
back into RAM. First, Windows decides which program must be removed
from RAM, and this time Windows chooses Program C (Figure 4.60). Then it
loads Program B into RAM (Figure 4.61).
Swapping programs to and from the page file and RAM takes time. Al-
though no visual clues suggest that a swap is taking place, the machine
slows down quite noticeably as Windows performs the swaps. The alterna-
tive (Figure 4.62) is far less acceptable. Page files are a crucial aspect of Win-
dows operation.

You can’t tell whether a
program is swapped or not.
• Figure 4.60
Program C is swapped to the page file.
If you have a second hard
drive installed in your PC, you
can often get a nice performance
boost by moving your page file
from the C: drive (the default) to
the second drive. To move your
page file in all versions of Win-
dows, go to the Control Panel |
System applet and select the Ad-
vanced tab in 2000/XP or the Ad-
vanced system settings menu in
Vista/7. This opens the System
Properties dialog box with the
Advanced tab selected. In the
Performance section, click the
Settings button to open the Per-
formance Options dialog box.
Select the Advanced tab, and
then click the Change button in
the Virtual Memory section. Se-
lect a drive from the list and give
it a size or range, and you’re
ready to go.
Just don’t turn virtual memory
off completely. Although Win-
dows can run without virtual
memory, you will definitely take
a performance hit.

Windows handles page files automatically, but occasionally
you’ll run into problems and need to change the size of the page file
or delete it and let Windows re-create it automatically. The page file
is PAGEFILE.SYS. You can often find it in the root directory of the C:
drive, but again, that can be changed. Wherever it is, the page file is a
hidden system file, which means in practice that you’ll have to play
with your folder-viewing options to see it.
■Maintaining Windows
Every computer running a Windows operating system requires ongoing
maintenance to make sure nothing goes wrong and that the system keeps
running smoothly. Not that long ago, Windows had a bad rap as being diffi-
cult to maintain and challenging when troubleshooting problems. That’s no
longer true. Microsoft used its decades of experience with operating systems
to search for ways to make the tasks of maintaining and troubleshooting less
onerous. They’ve done such a good job with the latest versions of Windows
that, out of the box, they are easy to optimize and maintain, although trouble-
shootingand all operating systems share thisis still a bit of a challenge.
This section starts with maintenance and optimization, so let’s make
sure you know what these two terms mean. Maintenance means jobs you do
from time to time to keep Windows running well, such as running hard
drive utilities. CompTIA sees optimization as jobs you do to your Windows
system to make it bettera good example is adding RAM. This section cov-
ers the standard maintenance and optimization activities performed on
Windows and the tools techs use to perform them.
Maintaining Windows can be compared to maintaining a new automobile.
Of course, a new automobile comes with a warranty, so most of us just take it to
the dealer to get work done. In this case, you are the mechanic, so you need to
think as an auto mechanic would think. First, an auto mechanic needs to apply
recalls when the automaker finds a serious problem. For a PC tech, that means
keeping the system patches announced by Microsoft up to date. You also need

changing the oil or rotating the tires. In a Windows system that includes keep-
ing the hard drive and Registry organized and uncluttered.
Patches, Updates, and Service Packs
Updating Windows has been an important, but often neglected, task for
computer users. Typically, Microsoft finds and corrects problems with its
software and releases patches on the second Tuesday of every month. Sadly,
because earlier versions of Windows let users decide when, if ever, to up-
date their computers, the net result could be disastrous. The Blaster worm
hammered computers all over the world in the summer of 2003, causing
thousands of computers to start rebooting spontaneously—no small feat for
a tiny piece of programming! Blaster exploited a flaw in Windows 2000/XP
and spread like wildfire, but Microsoft had already corrected the flaw with a
security update weeks earlier. If users had simply updated their computers,
the virus would not have caused such widespread damage.
The Internet has enabled Microsoft to make updates available, and Win-
dows Update can grab those updates and patch user systems easily and au-
tomatically. Even if you don’t want to allow Windows Update to patch your
computer automatically, it’ll nag you about updates until you patch your
system. Microsoft provides the Windows Update service for all versions of
Windows.
Once Microsoft released
Service Pack 2 for Windows
XP,
it
began
pushing
for
wholesale acceptance of au-
tomatic updates from Win-
dows Update. You can also
start Windows Update man-
ually. When your computer is
connected
to
the
Internet,
start the utility in Windows
2000 by selecting Start | Win-
dows Update. In Windows
XP/Vista/7 you will find it at
Start | All Programs | Win-
dows Update. When you run
Windows Update manually,
the software connects to the
Microsoft Web site and scans
your computer to determine
what updates you may need.
Within a few seconds or min-
utes, depending on your con-
nection speed, you’ll get a
straightforward screen like
the one shown in Figure 4.63.
You have several choices
here, although two are most
obvious.

you click the Clear All
button, as you might sus-
pect, all the updates will

When you click Install
Updates, all the updates
remaining in the list will

Automatic Updates
Updates are so important that Microsoft gives you the option to update
Windows automatically through the Automatic Updates feature. Actually, it
nags you about it! Soon after installing Windows (a day or two, in my expe-
rience), a message balloon will pop up from the taskbar suggesting that you
automate updates. If you click this balloon, the Automatic Updates Setup
Wizard runs, with which you can configure the update program. You say
you’ve never seen this message balloon but would like to automate the up-
date process? No problem. In Windows 2000 and XP, simply right-click My
Computer (on the Start menu), select Properties, click the Automatic Up-
dates tab, and select Automatic Update options. Or, open the Control Panel
and double-click the Automatic Updates icon. In Windows Vista, go to Start
| Windows Update to open the Windows Update dialog box. Click the
Change settings menu item on the left for options. Whenever your computer
connects to the Web, it checks the Windows Update page. What happens
next depends on the setting you choose. You have four choices:
■
Automatic (recommended) or Install updates automatically
(recommended)
Windows Update will simply keep your computer
patched up and ready to go. This is the best option for most users,
although not necessarily good for users of portable computers.

downloading hot fixes!
■
Download updates…
Windows Update downloads all patches in
the background and then, when complete, tells you about them. You
have the option at that point to install or not install.
■
Notify me… or Check for updates…
Windows Update simply
flashes a dialog box that tells you updates are available but does not
download anything until you say go. This is the best option for users
of portable computers. You can download files when it’s convenient
for you, such as when you’re home rather than traveling on business.
■
Turn off Automatic Updates or Never check for updates (not
recommended)
This does precisely what is advertised. You get
neither automatic patches nor notification that patches are available.
Only use this option on a system that does not or cannot connect to
the Internet. If you’re online, your computer needs to be patched!
When Windows Update works the way Microsoft wants it to work, it
scans the Microsoft Web site periodically, downloads important patches as
they appear, and then installs them on your computer. If you opted for the
download-but-don’t-install option, Windows Update simply notifies you
when updates are downloaded and ready to install (Figure 4.65).
Windows Vista gives you the option—enabled by default—to have Win-
dows Update include recommended updates along with important updates
when it downloads or notifies you about their availability. If you’ve got a
decent Internet connection, this can be a useful tool for keeping your drivers
and such updated.
Temporary File Management
with Disk Cleanup
You should run the Disk Cleanup utility regularly to make sure you’ve
cleared out the junk files that accumulate from daily use. All that late-night
Web surfing doesn’t just use up time; it also uses up disk space, leaving be-
hind hundreds of temporary Internet files. Those, and other bits and pieces
(such as those “deleted” files still hanging around in your Recycle Bin), can
add up to a lot of wasted disk space if you don’t periodically clean them out.
You can reach this tool through the Start menu (Start | All Programs |
Accessories | System Tools), or you can open My Computer or Computer,
right-click the drive you want to clean up, and select Properties. Right there
in the middle of the General tab, you’ll find the Disk Cleanup button.
When you click the Disk Cleanup button, the application firsts calculates
the space you can free up and then displays the Disk Cleanup dialog box,
which tells you how much disk space it can free up—the total amount possi-
ble as well as the amount you’ll get from each category of files it checks.
Vista adds an extra feature when you click the Disk Cleanup button, asking
if you wish to clean up all the files on the computer or just your files. In
Figure 4.66, the list of files to delete only has a few categories checked, and
the actual amount of disk space to be gained by allowing Disk Cleanup to
delete these files is much smaller than the estimate. As you select and dese-
lect choices, watch this value change.

Microsoft offers the Microsoft
Update tool (Windows XP) and
the System Update Readiness
Tool (Vista, 7) to help you deter-
mine if your system is ready to
update to a newer version of
Windows. You can obtain this
tool from the Microsoft Web
site.

If you scroll down through the list, you will see a choice to
compress old files. What do you know, Disk Cleanup does more
than just delete files? In fact, this file compression trick is where
Disk Cleanup really, uh, cleans up. This is one of the few choices
where you will gain the most space. The other big heavyweight
category is Temporary Internet Files, which Disk Cleanup will
delete. Try Disk Cleanup on a computer that gets hours of
Internet use every day and you’ll be pleased with the results.
Registry Maintenance
Your Registry is a huge database that Windows updates every
time you add a new application or hardware or make changes to
existing applications or hardware. As a result, the Registry tends
to be clogged with entries that are no longer valid. These usually
don’t cause any problems directly, but they can slow down your
system. Interestingly, Microsoft does not provide a utility to clean
up the Registry. To clean your Registry, you need to turn to a
third-party utility. Quite a few Registry cleaner programs are out
there, but my favorite is the freeware CCleaner by Piriform. You
can download the latest copy at www.ccleaner.com.
Before you start cleaning your Registry with wild abandon,
keep in mind that all Registry cleaners are risky in that they may
delete something you want in the Registry. Because Microsoft makes
changes to the Registry for every version of Windows, make sure your util-
ity supports the Windows version you’re running. This is especially true for
any 64-bit version of Windows! I’ve used CCleaner for a while and it has
worked well for meyour experience may differ.
Security: Spyware/Antivirus/Firewall
You simply cannot run a computer today without a large number of security
programs to protect you from malicious attacks from spyware, malware, vi-
ruses, and hacking. In fact, the installation, monitoring, and updating of
these programs (and possibly even hardware) is so important that they get
their own chapter. Head to Chapter 19, “Learning Computer Security,” for a
complete discussion of how to keep your computer safe!
Error-Checking and Disk Defragmentation
Keeping drives healthy and happy is a key task for every tech. Error-checking
and Disk Defragmenter are the key Windows maintenance tools used to
accomplish this task.
When you can’t find a software reason (and there are many possible
ones) for a problem such as a system freezing on shutdown, the problem
might be the actual physical hard drive. The tool to investigate that is Error-
checking. You can perform Error-checking by using the CHKDSK com-
mand from a command line, from the Start | Run dialog box, or by using
Start | Start Search. You can also access the tool through the GUI by opening
My Computer or Computer, right-clicking on the drive you want to check,

selecting
Properties,
and
then
clicking the Tools tab. Click Check
Now to have Error-checking scan
the drive for bad sectors, lost clus-
ters, and similar problems, and re-
pair them if possible.
Run the Disk Defragmenter
(Figure 4.67) on a regular basis to
keep your system from slowing
down due to files being scattered
in pieces on your hard drive. Be-
fore you click the Defragment but-
ton, click the Analyze button to
have Windows analyze the disk
and determine if defragmentation
is actually necessary. If you use
Vista/7, your system is defragged
automatically.
Error-checking and Disk Defragmenter are such critical maintenance
features that you really should have them run automatically. Take a mo-
ment to see how to schedule these and other critical jobs.
Scheduling Maintenance
Maintenance only works properly when you do it at regular intervals. De-
pending on the version of Windows installed, you can schedule maintenance
jobs to run automatically. The CompTIA Essentials objectives define three
areas to consider for scheduled maintenance: Defragmentation, Scandisk/
Check Disk, and Startup programs. For the most part, we use the Task Sched-
uler, although this depends on the task and the version of Windows.
Task Scheduler/Scheduled Tasks
Two versions of Task Scheduler are available: Windows 2000 and XP run
Version 1.0, and Vista/7 run Version 2.0. Microsoft called it Scheduled
Tasks in Windows 2000/XP, but reverted to Task Scheduler in Windows
Vista. In both versions you
can choose an executable
program and define when
you want that program to
run. Figures 4.68 and 4.69
show Scheduled Tasks run-
ning a backup at a certain
time of day.
Version
2.0
is
much
more powerful and flexible,
dividing tasks into triggers,
actions,
and
conditions.
Triggers are actions or sched-
ules that start a program. Ac-
tions are steps that define
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
105
• Figure 4.67

both the program to run and how it is to run. Conditions are extra criteria that
must be met for the program to run. (Is the system idle? Is it connected to the
Internet?) Figure 4.70 shows the Conditions tab for a sample task.
To open Task Scheduler, go to Start | All Programs or Programs | Acces-
sories | System Tools | Task Scheduler or Scheduled Tasks. Note the variation
in the name of the utility in the Start menu options.
106
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 4.69
Daily Backup Schedule tab in Windows XP
• Figure 4.70
Conditions tab in the Windows Vista Task Scheduler (Version 2.0)

The key to running scheduled maintenance is to know the
names of the executable programs and any special switches you
may need to enter. As we go through each of these I’ll show you
the names.
Defragmentation
To defragment, you need to run Disk Defragmenter (as you
know), so you’ll look for the executable file called DEFRAG.EXE.
In Windows 2000 and XP, open Scheduled Tasks, browse for
DEFRAG.EXE, and then add the drive you want to defragment, as
shown in Figure 4.71.
If you use Windows Vista/7 and want to change when Disk
Defragmenter runs (or turn it off completely), open the Start
menu, type defrag, and press ENTER. You can start defragging
right away or modify/disable the task in the Disk Defragmenter:
Modify Schedule dialog box (Figure 4.72).
It’s best to run Disk Defragmenter every evening if possible. If
you’re using Vista, take advantage of the “only run when idle”
condition to keep Disk Defragmenter from interrupting possibly
more important tasks.
Error-checking (Scandisk and Check Disk)
The tool you know and love as Error-checking appears on the CompTIA A+
objectives as Scandisk and Check Disk. (Neither tool exists on modern ver-
sions of Windows.) Regardless of what you call Error-checking, setting up
Task Scheduler to run it automatically is a good thing.
Using the technique you just learned to set up a scheduled task with
Disk Defragmenter, create another scheduled task to run Error-checking. Its
executable is called CHKDSK.EXE (Figure 4.73). There are two switches you
should use: /F to repair sectors and /R to tell Error-checking to attempt to
recover data on known bad sectors.
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
107

• Figure 4.72
Vista’s Disk Defragmenter schedule
The CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam may use either name for
the utility for scheduling mainte-
nance in Windows. Remember
that Windows 2000 and Windows
XP label the tool Scheduled
Tasks; Windows Vista (and Win-
dows 7) label it Task Scheduler.
The CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam calls the Disk Defragmenter
program “Defrag,” the common
tech slang term for it.
No versions of Windows run
Error-checking automatically, so
you’ll need to set up a task on the
computer if you wish to do so.

Opinions vary on how often you should run Error-checking as a sched-
uled task. For the CompTIA Essentials exam, a monthly check is considered
a good idea. For the real world, you should run Error-checking when you
suspect a problem with your drives.
Startup Programs
Techs use the System Configuration utility (MSCONFIG.EXE) to edit and trou-
bleshoot operating system and program startup processes and services. It
has been available in all Windows operating systems except Windows 95
and Windows 2000. Prior to Windows
Vista, the System Configuration utility of-
fered quick access to troubleshoot and edit
the BOOT.INI file. It still offers some of
these features in Vista, such as the capabil-
ity to disable or enable troublesome or un-
wanted services and startup items. The
BCD data store is used in place of the
BOOT.INI file in Windows Vista, however,
so you obviously cannot use the System
Configuration utility to edit the BOOT.INI
file in Vista.
To start the System Configuration util-
ity, go to Start | Run or Start | Start Search,
enter msconfig, and click OK or press EN-
TER (Figure 4.74). The program will run au-
tomatically in Windows XP; in Vista you
may need to provide the necessary creden-
tials or response, depending on the User
Account Control (UAC) setup.

You should remember that
you can configure the System
Configuration utility with startup
selections for troubleshooting.
After using the System Configu-
ration utility to change your
startup programs, you can
choose Normal startup to load
all drivers and services. A Diag-
nostic startup loads basic ser-
vices only, and a Selective
startup enables you to select
which system services and
startup items to load on startup.

■Optimizing Windows
Maintenance is about keeping Windows’ performance from degrading with
time and use. Of course, you don’t just want to keep trouble at bay—you
want to make your systems better, stronger, faster! Anything you do that
makes Windows better than it was before, such as adding a piece of soft-
ware or hardware to make something run better, is an optimization.
Installing and Removing Software
Probably the most common optimization performed on any PC is adding
and removing applications. Installing and removing software is part of the
normal life of any PC. Each time you add or remove software, you are mak-
ing changes and decisions that can affect the system beyond whatever the
program does, so it pays to know how to do it right.
System Information
Windows comes with a handy built-in utility known as the System Informa-
tion tool (Figure 4.75) that collects information about hardware resources,
components, and the software environment. When it finishes doing that, it
provides a nice and tidy little report, enabling you to troubleshoot and diag-
nose any issues and conflicts. As with many other tools you can access from
the Start | Run or Start | Start Search dialog box, the CompTIA A+ Essen-
tials exam refers to System Information by its executable, MSINFO32.EXE.
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
109
• Figure 4.75
System Information

You can start System Information in one of the following ways:
■
Choose Start | Programs or All Programs | Accessories | System
Tools | System Information.
■
In Windows XP, click Start, click Run, and then type msinfo32 and
click OK. In Windows Vista, open the Start Search box, type
msinfo32, and press ENTER.
It is also important to note that you can use System Information to gather
information about remote computers by selecting View | Remote Com-
puter and then entering the remote computer’s network machine name. Un-
der Tools, you even get quick access to System Restore and the DirectX
Diagnostic Tool, a tool for checking your video card.
Installing Software
Most application programs are distributed on optical discs (although this is
slowly changing). Windows supports Autorun, a feature that enables the op-
erating system to look for and read a special file called—wait for it—
AUTORUN.INF. Immediately after a removable media device (optical disc
or thumb drive) is inserted into your computer, whatever program is listed
in AUTORUN.INF runs auto-
matically.
Most
application
programs distributed on re-
movable
media
have
an
autorun file that calls up the in-
stallation program.
Sometimes, however, you
need to institute the installa-
tion sequence yourself. Per-
haps the installation disc lacks
an Autorun installation pro-
gram, or perhaps Windows is
configured so that you must
start programs on optical discs
manually. In some cases, a disc
may contain more than one
program, and you must choose
which of them to install. Re-
gardless of the reason, begin-
ning the installation manually
is a simple and straightforward
process of using the Add or Re-
move Programs applet in the
Control Panel in Windows XP.
Windows 2000 calls the applet
Add/Remove Programs. Click the Add New Programs button (Figure 4.76),
follow the prompts, and provide the media or location of the files. In Win-
dows Vista and 7, Microsoft has replaced the Add or Remove Programs ap-
plet with Programs and Features, which does not have the Add New
Programs feature.
110
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 4.76
Add New Programs

If you have sufficient permissions to install an application—your ac-
count is a member of the Administrators group in Windows 2000, for exam-
ple, or is an Administrator account in Windows XP and up—the application
will begin its installation routine. If you don’t have sufficient permissions to
install an application, Windows will stop the installation.
With Windows Vista/7, UAC complicates the installation process a bit.
You will most likely be prompted by UAC when installing an application to
give you time to review what is happening to your system in case you did
not approve of the program being installed. If you are using an Administra-
tor account, you can simply click Continue and finish the installation.
Should you be logged in with a less privileged account, you will need to en-
ter a user name and password of an account with administrative privileges.
Some installers have trouble letting UAC know that they need more privi-
leges and simply fail no matter what account you are logged in with. In
those cases it is best to right-click the installer icon and select Run as Admin-
istrator to give the installer the access it expects from the start.
Assuming all is well, you typically first must accept the terms of a soft-
ware license before you can install an application. These steps are not op-
tional; the installation simply won’t proceed until you accept all terms the
software manufacturer requires and, in many cases, enter a correct code.
You may also be asked to make several decisions during the installation pro-
cess. For example, you may be asked where you would like to install the
program and if you would like certain optional components installed. Gen-
erally speaking, it is best to accept the suggested settings unless you have a
very specific reason for changing the defaults.
Removing Software
Each installed application program takes up space on your computer’s hard
drive, and programs that you no longer need simply waste space that could
be used for other purposes. Removing unnecessary programs can be an im-
portant piece of optimization.
You remove a program from a Windows PC in
much the same manner as you install it. That is,
you use the application’s own uninstall program,
when possible. You normally find the uninstall
program listed under the application’s icon on the
Start menu, as shown in Figure 4.77.
If an uninstall program is not available, use the
appropriate Windows Control Panel applet to re-
move the software. Figure 4.78 shows this applet in
Windows Vista. You select the program you want
to remove and click the Uninstall/Change button
or Change/Remove button. Windows displays a
message warning you that the program will be per-
manently removed from your PC. If you’re certain
you want to continue, click Yes.
You may then see a message telling you that a shared file that appears to
no longer be in use is about to be deleted, and asking your approval. Gen-
erally speaking, it’s safe to delete such files. If you do not delete them, they
will likely be orphaned and remain unused on your hard disk forever. In
some cases, clicking the Uninstall/Change or Change/Remove button

starts the application’s in-
stall program (the one
you couldn’t find before)
so you can modify the in-
stalled features. This is a
function of the program
you’re attempting to re-
move.
The
end
result
should be the removal of
the application and all of
its pieces and parts, in-
cluding files and Registry
entries.

which optional Windows
components you would
need. It installed Note-
pad, modem support, and
games on your computer.
You can remove these
Windows
components
from your system if you
like, and add other components as well. If you’re adding components, you’ll
need a copy of your Windows CD/DVD, or another location where the
Windows source files are stored. This task really hasn’t changed from previ-
ous versions of Windows.
To add or remove a Windows component in Win-
dows 2000/XP, open the Add/Remove Programs or
Add or Remove Programs applet in the Control
Panel. From here, select Add/Remove Windows
Components, which opens the Windows Compo-
nents Wizard (Figure 4.79). You can select an installed
program here. You can see how frequently it is used,
how much disk space it uses, and (sometimes) the last
time it was used.
In Windows Vista/7, open the Programs and Fea-
tures applet in the Control Panel, and then click the
Turn Windows features on or off option on the Tasks list.
Click Continue if prompted by UAC and you will be
presented with the Windows Features dialog box
(Figure 4.80). To toggle a feature on or off, simply
click its checkbox. Unlike previous versions of Win-
dows, you no longer need to have the installation disc
to turn on features.

Installing/Optimizing a Device
The processes for optimizing hardware in Windows are absolutely identi-
cal, even down to the troubleshooting utilities, and are very similar to the
steps for installing a new device. The installation process is covered in every
chapter of this book that deals with one type of device or another, so this sec-
tion concentrates on the issues that fit best under optimization.
Driver Updates
Device manufacturers occasionally update their drivers. Most of these
updates take place to fix problems, but many updates incorporate new
features. Whatever the case, when one of your devices gets an updated
driver, it’s your job to install it. Windows/Microsoft Update provides an
easy method to update drivers from manufacturers that take advantage of
the service. If you are using Windows 2000 or XP, you usually need to select
the Custom option to see these updates because the Express option only in-
stalls high-priority updates. When you click on the Custom option, look un-
der Hardware, Optional (on the left) to see if Windows has any driver
updates (Figure 4.81).
If you are using Vista/7, you will need to click View available updates to
see if any drivers are available for your system. No matter what version of
Windows you have, take some time to read what these updates
dosometimes you may choose not to install a driver update because it’s
not necessary or useful to your system.
If Windows does not put a driver update in the Windows Update tool,
how do you know a device needs updating? The trick is to know your de-
vices. Video card manufacturers update drivers quite often. Get in the habit
of registering your video card with the manufacturer to stay up to date. Any
very new device is also a good candidate for an update. When you buy that
new cool toy for your system, make a point to head over to the
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows

exam tests you on installing and
optimizing devices.

manufacturer’s Web site and see if any updates have come out since
it was packaged for sale. That happens more often than you might
think!
Driver Signing
Device drivers become part of the operating system and thus have
the potential to cause lots of problems if they’re written poorly. To
protect Windows systems from bad device drivers, Microsoft uses
driver signing, which means that each driver has a digital signature.
Any drivers included on the Windows installation media or at the
Windows Update Web site are digitally signed. Once you have in-
stalled a driver, you can look at its Properties to confirm that it was
digitally signed. Figure 4.82 shows a digitally signed network card
driver.
When an unsigned driver is detected during hardware installa-
tion, you’ll see the message shown in Figure 4.83 offering you the
choice to stop or continue the installation. Signed drivers are more
or less a sure thing, but that doesn’t mean unsigned ones are a prob-
lem—just consider the source of the driver and ensure that your de-
vice works properly after installation.
114
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 4.81
Optional Hardware updates
• Figure 4.82
A digitally signed driver

You can control how Windows behaves when drivers are being in-
stalled. Click the Driver Signing button on the Hardware tab of the Sys-
tem Properties dialog box to display the Driver Signing Options dialog
box, shown in Figure 4.84. If you select Ignore, Windows will install an
unsigned driver without warning you. If you select Warn, you will be
prompted when Windows detects an unsigned driver during driver in-
stallation, and you will be given the opportunity to either stop or con-
tinue the installation. Choosing Block will prevent the installation of
unsigned drivers.
The default Driver Signing setting is Warn. This also is the default
setting during installation, so you will always be warned when Windows
detects an unsigned driver during Windows installation. This is no prob-
lem for a standard installation, when you are sitting at the computer, re-
sponding to all prompts—but it is a problem for automated, unattended
installations. This is a good reason to check out all your device drivers be-
fore installing Windows. In 64-bit versions of Windows, all drivers must
be signed. No exceptions. Microsoft wants to keep tight controls on the
drivers to improve stability.
Device Manager
You’ve worked a bit with Device Manager earlier in this chapter when con-
figuring snap-ins; it’s also the tool to use when optimizing device drivers.
Right-click on a device in Device Manager to display the context menu.
From here you can update or uninstall the driver, disable the device, scan
for hardware changes, or display the Properties dialog box. When you open
the Properties dialog box, you’ll see several tabs that vary according to the
specific device. Most devices have General, Driver, Details, and Resources
tabs. The tab that matters most for optimization is the Driver tab.
The Driver tab has buttons labeled Driver Details, Update Driver, Roll
Back Driver, and Uninstall. Driver Details lists the driver files and their loca-
tions on disk. Update Driver opens the Hardware Update Wizardnot very
useful given that the installation programs for almost all drivers do this au-
tomatically. The Roll Back Driver option is a different story. It enables you to
remove an updated driver, thus rolling back to the previous driver version.
Roll Back Driver (Figure 4.85) is a lifesaver when you install a new driver

placed! Uninstall removes the driver.
Adding a New Device
Windows should automatically detect any new device
you install in your system. If Windows does not detect a
newly connected device, use the Add Hardware Wiz-
ard or Add Hardware to get the device recognized and
drivers installed (Figure 4.86). You’ll find it on the
Hardware tab of the System Properties dialog box.
Click Next on the Welcome screen, and the wizard
searches for hardware that has been connected but does
not yet have a driver installed. If it detects the device,
select it, and the wizard installs the driver. You may
have to point to the source location for the driver files. If
the wizard does not detect the device, which is very
likely, it will ask you if the hardware is connected.
When you answer yes and click Next, it gives you a list
of installed hardware, similar to Figure 4.87.
If the device is in the list, select it and click Next. If
not, scroll to the bottom and select Add a new hardware
device, and then click Next. If the device is a printer, net-
work card, or modem, select Search for and install the
hardware automatically and click Next. In that case, once
the wizard detects the device and installs the driver,
you’re finished. If you do see your device on the list,
your best hope is to select Install the hardware that I manu-
ally select from a list. In the subsequent screens, select the
appropriate device category, select the device manufac-
turer and the correct model, and respond to the prompts
from the Add Hardware Wizard to complete the
installation.
Performance Options
One optimization you can perform on all Windows ver-
sions is setting Performance Options. Performance Op-
tions are used to configure CPU, RAM, and virtual
memory (page file) settings. To access these options in Windows 2000/XP,
right-click My Computer and select Properties, click the Advanced tab, and
click the Options button (Windows 2000) or Settings button (Windows XP)
in the Performance section of that tab. In Windows Vista/7, right-click Com-
puter and select Properties; then click the Advanced system settings option in
the Tasks list. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confir-
mation, type the password or confirmation. Click the Settings button in the
Performance section of the Advanced tab. Once you get to the Performance
Options dialog box, its behavior differs between Windows 2000 and Win-
dows XP/Vista (one of the few places where Vista acts the same as XP!).
In Windows 2000, the Performance Options dialog box shows a pair of
radio buttons called Applications and Background Services. These radio
buttons set how processor time is divided between the foreground
116
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 4.86
Add Hardware Wizard
• Figure 4.87
List of installed hardware

application and all other background tasks. Set this to Applications if
you run applications that need more processor time. Set it to Back-
ground Services to give all running programs the same processor us-
age. You can also adjust the size of the page file in this dialog box, but
in most cases I don’t mess with these settings and instead leave control
of the page file to Windows.
The Windows XP/Vista Performance Options dialog box has
three tabs: Visual Effects, Advanced, and Data Execution Prevention
(Figure 4.88). The Visual Effects tab enables you to adjust visual effects
that impact performance. Try clicking the top three choices in turn
and watch the list of settings. Notice the tiny difference between the
first two choices. The third choice, Adjust for best performance, turns off
all visual effects, and the fourth option is an invitation to make your
own adjustments. If you’re on a computer that barely supports Win-
dows XP, turning off visual effects can make a huge difference in the
responsiveness of the computer. For the most part, though, just leave
these settings alone.
The Advanced tab in Windows XP, shown in Figure 4.89, has three
sections: Processor scheduling, Memory usage, and Virtual memory.
Under the Processor scheduling section, you can choose to adjust for
best performance of either Programs or Background services. The
Memory usage settings enable you to allocate a greater share of mem-
ory to programs or to the system cache. The Virtual memory section
enables you to modify the size and location of the page file. Microsoft
dropped the Memory usage settings option in Windows Vista.
Microsoft introduced Data Execution Prevention (DEP) with Win-
dows XP Service Pack 2. DEP works in the background to stop viruses
and other malware from taking over programs loaded in system
memory. It doesn’t prevent viruses from being installed on your com-
puter, but makes them less effective. By default, DEP monitors only
critical operating system files in RAM, but the Data Execution Preven-
tion tab enables you to have DEP monitor all running programs. It
works, but you’ll take a performance hit. Like other options in the Per-
formance Options dialog box, leaving the DEP settings as default is
the best option most of the time.
Resource Tracking
One big issue with optimization is knowing when something needs
optimization. Let’s say your Windows computer seems to be running
more slowly. Resource tracking is very important for identifying the
performance problem. Task Manager and the Performance console
are tools you can use to figure out what (if anything) has become a
bottleneck.
Task Manager
The Task Manager has many uses. Most users are only aware of the
Applications tab, used to shut down a troublesome program. For opti-
mization purposes, Task Manager is a great tool for investigating how
hard your RAM and CPU are working at any given moment and why.
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
117
• Figure 4.88
Windows XP Performance
Options dialog box
• Figure 4.89
Advanced tab of Performance
Options dialog box

The quick way to open the Task Manager is to press CTRL-SHIFT-ESC.
Click the Performance tab to reveal a handy screen with the most
commonly used information: CPU usage, available physical mem-
ory, size of the disk cache, commit charge (memory for programs),
and kernel memory (memory used by Windows). Figure 4.90 shows
a system with a dual-core processor, which is why you see two
screens under CPU Usage History. A system with a single-core pro-
cessor would have a single screen.
Not only does Task Manager tell you how much CPU and RAM
usage is taking place, it also tells you what program is using those
resources. Let’s say your system is running slowly. You open up
Task Manager and see that your CPU usage is at 100 percent. You
then click on the Processes tab to see all the processes running on
your system. Click on the CPU column heading to sort all processes
by CPU usage to see who’s hogging the CPU (Figure 4.91)! To shut
off a process, just right-click the process and select End Process.
Many times a single process opens many other processes. If you
want to be thorough, click End Process Tree to turn off not only the
one process but also any other processes it started.
Task Manager is also a great tool for turning off processes that
are hogging memory. Let’s say you’re experiencing a slowdown,
but this time you also notice your hard drive light is flickering nonstopa
clear sign that you’ve run out of memory and the page file is now in use. You
go into Task Manager and see no available system memorynow you know
the page file is in use! To make the PC run faster, you have to start unloading
programsbut which ones? By going into the Processes tab in Task Man-
ager, you can see exactly which processes are using the most memory. Just
be careful not to shut down processes you don’t recognize; they might be
something the computer needs.
Performance Console
Task Manager is good for identifying current problems, but what
about problems that happen when you’re not around? What if your
system is always running at a CPU utilization of 20 percentis that
good or bad? Windows 2000 and XP provide a tool called the Perfor-
mance console that logs resource usage so you can track items such
as CPU and RAM usage over time. Performance is an MMC console
file, PERFMON.MSC, so you call it from Start | Run or through the
Performance icon in Administrative Tools. Use either method to
open the Performance console (Figure 4.92). As you can see, there
are two nodes, System Monitor and Performance Logs and Alerts.
Objects and Counters
To begin working with the Performance
console, you need to understand two terms: object and counter. An
object is a system component that is given a set of characteristics
and can be managed by the operating system as a single entity. A
counter tracks specific information about an object. For example, the
Processor object has a counter, %Processor Time, that tracks the per-
centage of elapsed time the processor uses to execute a non-idle
thread. Many counters can be associated with an object.
118
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 4.90
Task Manager
• Figure 4.91
CPU usage
Every program that runs on
your system is composed of one
or more processes.

System Monitor
System Monitor gathers real-time data on objects
such as memory, physical disk, processor, and network, and dis-
plays this data as a graph (line graph), histogram (bar graph), or sim-
ple
report.
Think
of
System
Monitor
as
a
more
detailed,
customizable Task Manager. When you first open the Performance
console, the System Monitor shows data in graph form. The data dis-
played is from the set of three counters listed below the chart. If you
want to add counters, click the Add button (the one that looks like a
plus sign) or press CTRL-I to open the Add Counters dialog box.
Click the Performance object drop-down list and select one of the
many different objects you can monitor. The Add Counters dialog
box includes a helpful feature: you can select a counter and click the
Explain button to learn about the counter, as shown in Figure 4.93.
Even with just three counters selected, the graph can get a little
busy. That’s where one of my favorite System Monitor features
shines. If you want the line of charted data from just one counter to
stand out, select the counter in the list below the graph and then
press CTRL-H. See how this trick makes the %Processor Time line
stand out in Figure 4.94? Imagine how useful that is when you are
monitoring a dozen counters.
Performance Logs and Alerts
The Performance Logs and Alerts snap-
in enables Windows to create a written record of just about anything
that happens on your system. Do you want to know if someone is trying to
log on to your system when you’re not around? The following procedure is
specific to Windows XP, but the steps are nearly identical in Windows 2000.
To create the new event log, right-click Counter Logs and select New
Log Settings. Give the new log a name—in this example, “Unauthorized Ac-
cesses.” Click OK, and a properties dialog box for the new log appears, simi-
lar to that shown in Figure 4.95.
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
119

Performance console
• Figure 4.93
Add Counters dialog box

To select counters for the log, click Add Counters and then select the Use
local computer counters radio button. Select Server from the Performance ob-
ject pull-down menu and then select Errors Logon from the list of counters;
click Add and then click Close.
Back in the properties dialog box for your new log, click the Schedule tab
and set up when you want this thing to start running—probably at the end
of the workday today. Then select when it should stop logging—probably
tomorrow morning when you start work. Click the Log Files tab to see
where the log file will be saved—probably C:\PerfLogs—and make a note
of the filename. The filename will consist of the name you gave the log and a
number. In this example I named the new performance log “Unauthorized
Accesses,” so the filename is Unauthorized Accesses_000001.blg.
When you come back in the morning, open the Performance console, se-
lect Performance Logs and Alerts, and then select Counter Logs. Your log
should be listed on the right. The
icon by the log name will be green if
the log is still running or red if it has
stopped. If it has not stopped, select
it and click the Stop button (the one
with the black square, circled in
Figure 4.96).
To view the log, open the Per-
formance console, select System
Monitor, change to Report view,
and load the file as a new source by
using the properties dialog box.
Reliability and Performance Monitor
Windows Vista improves on the old Performance console dramatically with
the Reliability and Performance Monitor. The Reliability and Performance
Monitor still has a complete Performance console with all the objects and

Stopping the performance log

counters you see in Windows 2000 and XP, but it adds an excellent Resource
Overview, a Reliability Monitor, and a much more flexible way to use coun-
ters with Data Collector Sets and Reports.
You can open the Reliability and Performance Monitor in Windows
Vista by starting the Performance Information and Tools in the Administra-
tive Tools Control Panel applet to get the Re-
source Overview dialog box (Figure 4.97). You
can also open the tool by going to Start | Start
Searching, typing perfmon.msc, and pressing
ENTER.
Think of the Resource Overview as an ad-
vanced Task Manager, giving details on CPU,
hard drive, network, and memory usage.
When you click on one of the four bars, you get
details on exactly which processes are using
those resources—a powerful tool when you
suspect a program might be hogging some-
thing! Figure 4.98 shows the Network bar
opened to reveal the processes using the net-
work and how much data each is sending.
The Reliability and Performance Monitor
option you can select under the Monitoring
Tools is simply a re-creation of the Performance
console and works as described earlier for Win-
dows 2000 and XP (Figure 4.99). This is a great
tool for quick checks on specific counters.
Microsoft included Data Collector Sets in
the Reliability and Performance Monitor,
groupings of counters you can use to make re-
ports. You can make you own Data Collector Sets (User Defined) or you can
just grab one of the predefined system sets. Once you start a Data Collector

Make sure you understand that
these tools give you the power
to inspect anything happening
on your system to help you
diagnose problems.

Set, you can use the Reports option to see the
results (Figure 4.100). Data Collector Sets not
only enable you to choose counter objects to
track, but they also enable you to schedule
when you want them to run.
Preparing for Problems
As part of optimizing Windows, techs need to
prepare for problems. You must have critical
system files and data backed up and tools in
place for the inevitable glitches. Different ver-
sions of Windows enable you to prepare for
problems differently. Microsoft seems to break
backups into certain areas: backing up per-
sonal data, backing up local copies of critical
system state information, backing up a small
amount of very critical system information on
some form of removable media, and providing
some way to use backups if your system won’t
boot. Let’s see all of these.
Back Up Personal Data
The most important data on your
computer is the personal data: your
documents, e-mail messages and
contacts,
Web
favorites,
photo-
graphs, and other files. To handle
backing up personal data, every ver-
sion of Windows comes with some
form of backup utility. There are big
differences between the backup util-
ity that comes with Windows 2000
and XP compared to the one that
comes with Vista (and the one that
comes with Windows 7 is different
still), so let’s break up the idea of
backing up personal data between
Windows 2000/XP and Vista.
Backup Utility for Windows
2000 and XP (NTBackup)
Windows
2000
Backup/Windows
XP Backup Utility (different names,
but the same program under the
hood, NTBackup) provides almost all
the tools you need to back up files and folders. It has come a long way from its
origins in Windows NT. NTBackup supports a greater variety of devices, en-
abling you to back up to network drives, logical drives, tape, and removable
122

disks (but not optical discs). Most folks, however, still turn to third-party
utilities to create system, e-mail, browser, and personal data backups.
You can start NTBackup by navigating the Start menu to Accessories |
System Tools, or by clicking the Backup Now button on the Tools tab of the
Local Disk Properties dialog box. I prefer to start it from Start | Run with the
command ntbackup. Click the Backup Wizard button to run the Backup
Wizard. This technique works in both Windows 2000 and Windows XP. To
use the Windows XP version in Advanced Mode, click Advanced Mode on
the opening screen (Figure 4.101). To have it always open in Advanced
Mode, deselect the Always start in wizard mode checkbox. If the program is in
Advanced Mode and you want to run it as a wizard, click the Wizard Mode
link to open the Backup or Restore Wizard.
To create a backup, start the Backup Utility, click Advanced Mode, and
choose the Backup tab. Check the boxes next to the drives and files you want
to include in the backup. To include your system state information, such as
Registry and boot files (which you should do), click the System State
checkbox. To specify where to put the backup file you’re creating, either
type the path and file name in the Backup media or file name box or click
Browse, select a location, type the file name, and click Save. Click Start
Backup. Choose whether you want to append this backup to a previous one
or overwrite it. Click Advanced to open the Advanced Backup Options dia-
log box, select Verify data after backup, and click OK. Click Start Backup again.
A dialog box shows you the utility’s progress. When it finishes, click Close
and then close the Backup Utility.
Both versions of NTBackup give you three choices after you click Ad-
vanced Mode: Backup Wizard (Advanced), Restore Wizard (Advanced),
and a third choice that is very important. The third option in Windows 2000
is the Emergency Repair Disk. As you can see in Figure 4.102, the third op-
tion in Windows XP is Automated System Recovery Wizard.

The Backup Utility is not in-

install it manually from the Win-

Choosing to run the Backup Wizard in Advanced Mode
Microsoft has been dreadfully
inconsistent on the naming of
the backup programs that bun-
dle with Windows. Here’s the
scoop in a nutshell. In Windows
2000, the official name of the
backup program is Microsoft
Windows Backup, but the dialog
box that opens is simply called
Backup. The wizard interface is
called the Backup Wizard. The
quick command-line command
you run to get to the utility is
NTBACKUP. Are you with me?
The backup program in Win-
dows XP has a similar slew of
names. The official name of the
program is Backup Utility for
Windows. The Advanced Mode
dialog box is called Backup Util-
ity, but the wizard interface dif-
fers depending on whether you
run the utility in Wizard Mode or
click the Backup Wizard button
in the Advanced Mode dialog
box. The former runs the Backup
or Restore Wizard; the latter
runs the Backup Wizard. These
wizards offer different options,
with the Backup or Restore Wiz-
ard providing the simpler, con-
sumer-oriented interface. Both
wizards are only different faces
for the Backup Utility. Got it? Oh,
and NTBACKUP is the com-
mand-line command to run the
program in Windows XP, so
Microsoft provides at least a nod
at naming consistency.
Most seasoned techs call the
backup programs in Windows
2000 and Windows XP Backup
or NTBackup. You need to know
the variety of names, though, to
provide proper customer sup-
port. This is especially true in a
help desk environment.

and is your main tool for fixing boot problems in
Windows 2000. It is not a bootable disk, nor does
it store very much information; the ERD does not
replace a good system backup! It works with a
special folder called \WINNT\REPAIR to store a
copy of your Registry. It’s not perfect, but it gets
you out of most startup problems. Making a new
ERD before you install a new device or program
is good practice. Then the ERD is ready if you
need it.
So you have this great Emergency Repair
Disk that’ll take care of all of your system repair
problems. You just pop it in the floppy drive and
go, right?
Not just yet. As I mentioned, the ERD itself is
not a bootable disk. To use the ERD, you must
first boot the system by using the Windows in-
stallation CD-ROM. Follow these steps to repair a
system by using the ERD:
1.
Boot the system, using either your set of boot diskettes or the
installation CD-ROM.
2.
In the Welcome to Setup dialog box, press the R key to select the
option to repair a Windows 2000 installation.
3.
The Windows 2000 Repair Options menu appears. You have the
option of either entering the Recovery Console or using the
Emergency Repair Disk.
4.
Press the R key to select the option to repair Windows 2000 by using
the emergency repair process.
5.
The next screen offers the choice of Manual or Fast repair.
■
Manual repair lets you select the following repair options:
inspect the startup environment, verify the system files, and
inspect the boot sector.
■
Fast repair doesn’t ask for any further input.
6.
Follow the onscreen instructions and insert the ERD when
prompted.
7.
Your system will be inspected and, if possible, restored. When the
process finishes, the system restarts.
Windows XP Automated System Recovery (ASR)
The Windows XP Auto-
mated System Recovery (ASR) looks and acts very similar to the Windows
2000 ERD. The ASR Preparation Wizard lets you create a backup of your
system. This backup includes a floppy disk and backup media (tape or CD-
R) containing the system partition and disks containing operating system
components (Figure 4.103).
The restore side of ASR involves a complete reinstallation of the operat-
ing system, preferably on a new partition. This is something you do when all
is lost. Run Setup and press F2 when prompted during the text-mode por-
tion of Setup. Follow the prompts on the screen, which will first ask for the
floppy disk and then for the backup media.

Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 4.102
Windows XP Backup Utility options

Backup Wizard
Data files are not backed up
by the ERD or by the ASR. Therefore, you have
to back up data files. If you run the Backup
Wizard and click the Next button on the Wel-
come screen, you’ll open the dialog box shown
in Figure 4.104. You have three options here.
The first two are fairly self-explanatory: you
can back up everything or just selected drives
and files.
The third option needs some explanation.
The Only back up the System State data radio but-
ton enables you to save “other” system-critical
files, but with Windows 2000/XP, it’s not much
more than making an ERD with the Registry
backup. This option really makes sense for
Windows 2000 Server and Windows Server
2003 systems because it saves Active Directory
information (which your Windows 2000/XP
systems do not store) as well as other critical,
server-specific functions. (I cover more on
these topics in Chapter 16, “Learning Local Area Networking.”)
But the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam may still expect you to

The odd fact that Microsoft has not updated the
Backup or Restore Wizard to enable you to back up to optical
discs of any sort has kept alive the practice of tape backups. Tape
drives connect to the ATA or SCSI bus, just like optical drives, but
rather than using a shiny CD-R or DVD+R disc, you have to back
up to magnetic tape (Figure 4.105).
Tape drive manufacturers have done pretty much everything
they can do to make tape backups as fast as possible, but the tech-
nology suffers from two huge drawbacks. First, it’s tape, which
means all data must be stored and restored in sequential access.
The drive has to go through Files 1 and 2 before reaching File 3, in
other words. Second, tape is painfully slow in comparison to hard
drives, optical drives, or Flash drives.
The only great benefit to tape is that it’s relatively cheap to buy
multiple tapes with a lot of storage capacity. With hard drive and
recordable DVD prices at rock bottom today, though, tape’s days
are numbered.
Backup Options
The goal of backing up data is to ensure that
when a system dies, there will be an available, recent copy you
can use to restore the system. You could simply back up the com-
plete system at the end of each day—or whatever interval you feel
is prudent to keep the backups fresh—but complete backups can
be a tremendous waste of time and materials. Instead of backing
up the entire system, take advantage of the fact that all the files
won’t be changed in any given period; much of the time you only

125

Creating an ASR backup

Backup Wizard options
• Figure 4.105
Backup tapes

need to back up what’s changed since your last backup. Recognizing this,
most backup software solutions have a series of options available beyond
the complete backup.
The key to understanding backups other than the full backup is attrib-
utes, 1-bit storage areas that all files have. The most common attributes are
Hidden (don’t show the file in Computer or when dir is typed at the com-
mand line), System (it’s a critical file for the system), Read-Only (can’t erase
it), and Archive. These attributes were first used in FAT-formatted drives in
the DOS era, but they are still completely supported by all file formats. The
archive bit works basically like this: Whenever a file is saved, the archive bit
is turned on. Simply opening a file affects the current state of the archive bit.
Backup programs usually turn off a file’s archive bit when the file is backed
up. In theory, if a file’s archive bit is turned off, there’s a good backup of that
file on some tape. If the archive bit is turned on, it means that the file has
been changed since it was last backed up (Figure 4.106).
Archive bits are used to perform backups that are not full backups. The
following backup types are most often supported:
■
A normal backup is a full backup. Every file selected is backed up,
and the archive bit is turned off for every file backed up. This is the
standard “back it all up” option.
■
A copy backup is identical to a normal backup, with the important
distinction being that the archive bits are not changed. This is used
(although not often) for making extra copies of a previously
completed backup.
■
An incremental backup includes only files
with the archive bit turned on. In other
words, it copies only the files that have
been changed since the last backup.
This backup turns off the archive bits.
■
A differential backup is identical to an
incremental backup, except that it
doesn’t turn off the archive bits.
■
A daily backup, also known as a daily
copy backup, makes copies of all the files
that have been changed that day. It does
not change the archive bits.
The motivation for having both the in-
cremental and differential backups may not
be clear at first glance—they seem so similar
as to be basically the same. Incremental seems the better option at first. If a
file is backed up, you would want to turn off the archive bit, right? Well,
maybe. But there is one scenario where that might not be too attractive. Most
backups do a big weekly normal backup, followed by daily incremental or
differential backups at the end of every business day. Figure 4.107 shows the
difference between incremental and differential backups.
Notice that a differential backup is a cumulative backup. Because the ar-
chive bits are not set, it keeps backing up all changes since the last normal
backup. This means the backup files will get progressively larger throughout
the week (assuming a standard weekly normal backup). The incremental
126
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Windows Explorer (My Com-
puter in Windows XP, Computer
in Vista) by default does not
show much about files in any
view, even when you select De-
tails from the View menu. The
Details view is highly customiz-
able, however, and can reveal a
phenomenal amount and variety
of information about files.
To customize your view, right-
click the column bar (the gray
bar that says Name, Size, Type,
Date Modified, and so forth) to
look at the default choices. You’ll
see everything from Attributes,
Owner, Author, and Title to file-
type-specific information such
as Genre, Duration, and Bit Rate
(for music files). If the default
extra view options don’t get
your motor revving, selecting
the More option brings up a
menu offering many more view
options! For the purposes of this
section, click the Attribute box to
display file and folder attributes.
• Figure 4.106
The archive bit on these files is on.
Be sure you know the types
of backups, including which
ones change the archive bits and
which ones do not.

backup, by contrast, only backs up files changed since
the last backup. Each incremental backup file will be
relatively small and also totally different from the
previous backup file.
Let’s assume that the system is wiped out on a
Thursday morning. How can you restore the system
to a useful state?
If you’re using an incremental backup, you first
have to restore the last weekly backup you ran on
Monday, then the Tuesday backup, and then the
Wednesday backup before the system is restored to
its Thursday morning state. The longer the time be-
tween normal backups, the more incremental back-
ups you must restore.
Using the same scenario but assuming you’re do-
ing differential instead of incremental backups, you
only need the weekly backup and then the Wednesday backup to restore
your system. A differential backup always requires only two backups to re-
store a system. Suddenly, the differential backup looks better than the incre-
mental! On the other hand, one big benefit of incremental over differential is
backup file size. Differential backup files are massive compared to incre-
mental ones.
Backup and Restore
Center for Vista
One of the many changes
between XP and Vista was
the
elimination
of
NTBackup, replaced with
the Windows Backup and
Restore
Center.
If
you
open this program, you’ll
notice that you only have
two options: back up ev-
erything or restore from a
backup (Figure 4.108).
If you choose to back up
your computer, you have
another two choices: back
up files or back up the en-
tire computer. Back up files
gives you a choice of the file
types you wish to back up
(Figure 4.109). Back up com-
puter backs up the entire
computer: every single file
and folder. Vista no longer
supports tape backups nor
can you choose between
differential or incremental
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
127
• Figure 4.107
Incremental versus differential
• Figure 4.108
Backup and Restore Center

backups. If you want these options, you need
to buy a third-party backup tool.
The Vista tool comes with a handy wiz-
ard that automatically configures when you
want to back up. So although you lose some
of the options from NTBackup, you’ll find
this to be a powerful tool that works for
most of your backup needs.
System Restore
Every technician has war stories about the
user who likes to add the latest gadget and
cool software to his computer. Then the user
is amazed when things go very, very wrong:
the system locks up, refuses to boot, or sim-
ply acts weird. This guy also can’t remember
what he added or when. All he knows is that
you should be able to fix it—fast.
This is not news to the folks at Microsoft,
and they have a solution to this problem. It’s
called System Restore, and they first intro-
duced it in Windows Me, with further re-
finements in Windows XP. The System Restore tool enables you to create a
restore point, a copy of your computer’s configuration at a specific point in
time. If you later crash or have a corrupted OS, you can restore the system to
its previous state.
To create a restore point, go to Start | All Programs | Accessories | System
Tools | System Restore. When the tool opens, select Create a restore point and
then click Next (Figure 4.110). Type in a description on the next screen.
There’s no need to include the date
and time because the System Re-
store
adds
them
automatically.
Click Create and you’re finished.
System Restore in Windows
Vista is much more automatic, with
the operating system making a
number of restore points automati-
cally. To make your own restore
point, go to System Properties, se-
lect System Protection, and then
click the Create button as shown in
Figure 4.111.
If you click the System Restore
button, you might be surprised at
how many system restore points are
already made for you (Figure 4.112).
In most cases, one of these is all
you’ll need to return your system to
an earlier point.
128
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 4.109
Back Up Files option
• Figure 4.110
Create a restore point

The System Restore tool creates some of the restore points in time auto-
matically. For instance, by default, every time you install new software, XP
creates a restore point. Thus, if installation of a program causes your com-
puter to malfunction, simply restore the system to a time point prior to that
installation, and the computer should work again.
During the restore process, only settings and programs are changed. No
data is lost. Your computer includes all programs and settings as of the re-
store date. This feature is absolutely invaluable for overworked techs. A
simple restore fixes many user-generated problems.
To restore to a previous time point, start the System Restore Wizard by
choosing Start | All Programs | Accessories | System Tools | System Restore.
Then select the first radio button, Restore my
computer to an earlier time, and click Next.
Figure 4.113 shows a calendar with restore
points. Any day with a boldface date has at
least one restore point. These points are cre-
ated after you add or remove software or in-
stall Windows updates and during the
normal shutdown of your computer. Select a
date on the calendar; then select a restore
point from the list on the right and click Next.
The last screen before the system is re-
stored shows a warning. It advises you to
close all open programs and reminds you
that Windows will shut down during the re-
store process. It also states that the restore
operation is completely reversible. Thus, if
you go too far back in time, you can restore
to a more recent date.
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
129
• Figure 4.111
Creating a manual System Restore
in Vista
• Figure 4.112
Restore points in Vista
• Figure 4.113
Calendar of restore points

You don’t have to count on the automatic creation of re-
store points. You can open System Restore at any time and
simply select Create a restore point. Consider doing this before
making changes that might not trigger an automatic restore
point, such as directly editing the Registry.
System Restore is turned on by default and uses some of
your disk space to save information on restore points. To turn
System Restore off or change the disk space usage, open the
System Properties applet in Control Panel and select the Sys-
tem Restore tab (Figure 4.114).
Installing Recovery Console
When things get really bad on a Windows system, you need to
turn to the Recovery Console. The Recovery Console is a text-
based startup of Windows that gets you to a command
prompt similar to the Windows command prompt.
If you have the Windows 2000/XP CD-ROM, you can
start the Recovery Console by running Setup, selecting Re-
pair, and then selecting Recovery Console. If you like to be
proactive, however, you can install the Recovery Console on
your hard drive so that it is one of your startup options and
does not require the Windows 2000 or XP CD-ROM to run.
The steps to do this in Windows 2000 and Windows XP are
very nearly identical.
First, you need to log in to the system with the Adminis-
trator account. Grab your Windows 2000 or XP installation
CD-ROM and drop it in your system. If the Autorun function
kicks in, just click the No button. To install the Recovery Con-
sole and make it a part of your startup options, click the Start
button, select Run, and type the following:
d:\i386\winnt32 /cmdcons
If your CD-ROM drive uses a different drive letter, substitute it for the
D: drive. Then just follow the instructions on the screen. If you are con-
nected to the Internet, allow the Setup program to download updated files.
From now on, every time the system boots, the OS selection menu will show
your Windows OS (Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP) and the
Microsoft Windows Recovery Console. It may also show other choices if
yours is a multiboot computer.
System Recovery Options
Windows Vista and Windows 7 have dropped the Recovery Console, re-
placing it with the graphical System Recovery Options. System Recovery
Options is on the Vista/7 installation media, and you run it by booting to the
media as though you were installing Windows. When you boot from the in-
stallation media, choose your language settings, click Next, select Repair
your computer, and then click Next a second time to see the System Recovery
Options menu, as shown in Figure 4.115. The System Recovery Options
menu has a number of items, each designed to help in a particular situation.
130

applet

Startup Repair
Startup Repair should be
your first choice when running System Re-
covery. This option tells Windows to at-
tempt to repair your system automatically.
Startup Repair rebuilds all of your most
important system files, which in most
cases will at least enable you to get Win-
dows to boot. If Startup Repair doesn’t
work, hope you made some system restore
points!
System Restore
The System Restore op-
tion searches your computer for restore
points, enabling you to choose one. Hope-
fully, this will fix whatever is preventing
your system from booting. If not, you may
want to consider the Windows Complete
PC Restore option.
Windows Complete PC Restore
Assuming
you made a backup while the system was
running properly, you can select this op-
tion to restore your PC.
Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool
Bad RAM is an all-too-common prob-
lem for any computer and often shows itself during startup. Recognizing
this, Microsoft added this tool to test your RAM for errors. This is an incredi-
bly powerful tool for the job. If your RAM is bad, the Memory Diagnostic
Tool will locate and report the error to you. You replace your RAM and the
problem is solved.
Command Prompt
The Command Prompt option is just as it is named: a
full-blown command prompt, not to be confused with the Windows 2000/XP
Recovery Console. You can run any command-prompt program from here.
Safe Mode (All Versions)
If you’re experiencing problems with Windows—or even if you’re expect-
ing to—then you might want to try booting your computer into Safe Mode.
Safe Mode starts up Windows but loads only very basic, non–vendor-spe-
cific drivers for mouse, VGA monitor (not in Vista), keyboard, mass storage,
and system services. You get to Safe Mode by holding the F8 key during sys-
tem boot, before Windows begins to load. You’ll be presented with a menu
containing several different boot options, but the only one you need to know
about for the Essentials exam is Safe Mode.
Once in Safe Mode, you can use tools such as Device Manager to locate
and correct the source of the problem. When you use Device Manager in
Safe Mode, you can access the properties for all the devices, even those that
are not working in Safe Mode. The status displayed for the device is the sta-
tus for a normal startup. Even the network card will show as enabled. You
can disable any suspect device or perform other tasks, such as removing or
updating drivers. If a problem with a device driver is preventing the operat-
ing system from starting normally, check the Device Manager for warning
icons that indicate an unknown device.

Chapter 4 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about Microsoft Windows.
Relate the history of Microsoft Windows
■
Microsoft entered the operating system game in
the early 1980s with a command-line OS called
Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS.
With a command-line OS, you interacted with the
computer to run programs and save files and all
the other computing functions by typing and
pressing the ENTER key on your keyboard.
■
The earliest versions of Windows were little more
than a graphical overlay of the DOS command-line
operating system. This overlay version of
Windows went through a number of updates,
ending with the first truly popular version of
Windows, Windows for Workgroups version 3.1.
The last versions are collectively referred to as
Windows 3.x.
■
In 1989, Microsoft offered a completely separate
version of Windows called Windows NT, a true
graphical operating system that was dramatically
more powerful than the Windows overlay
versions. It cost a lot more, unfortunately, so it did
not see widespread adoption by regular users, only
by business users. What set NT apart from other
versions of Windows (including later consumer-
oriented products) was its very secure file
system, NTFS.
■
From 1995 through 2000, Microsoft offered
consumers an alternative version of Windows that
went through several updates, such as Windows 95
and Windows 98. Collectively these versions of
Windows are called Windows 9x. All of these
versions of Windows used forms of FAT for file
systems, not the more secure NTFS.
■
Microsoft currently supports seven families of
Windows, of which three concern the CompTIA
A+ certified technician: Windows 2000, Windows
XP, and Windows Vista. All can use the NTFS file
system.
■
Windows 2000 came in two versions: Professional
and Server. The CompTIA A+ Essentials exam
does not cover Windows Server versions, but a
good tech should at least know these server
versions exist. If you were to look at the Windows
2000 Server desktop, you’d be hard pressed to see
any obvious differences from the Windows 2000
Professional version.
■
Microsoft released several versions of the successor
to Windows 2000, such as Windows XP Profes-
sional and Windows XP Home. Windows XP Pro-
fessional provides full-blown data security, and
it is the only version of Windows XP with the
capability of logging on to a special Windows
Server–controlled domain. Windows XP Home is a
stripped-down version of XP Professional, without
some of the important security features, such as no
access to the Encrypting File System. Windows XP
Media Center offers features for the media junkie,
such as a personal video recorder to capture televi-
sion shows for later viewing.
■
Windows Vista comes in many flavors, such as
Windows Vista Home Premium and Windows
Vista Business. Windows Vista Ultimate combines
all of the features of every other Vista version and
includes some other features, such as a game
performance tweaker and DVD ripping capability.
■
Windows XP and Windows Vista come in 64-bit
versions to take advantage of the extra computing
power and memory capacity available with modern
64-bit processors. A 32-bit operating system is
limited to a mere 4 GB of RAM, whereas a 64-bit
OS can have gobs more. The 64-bit versions of
Windows XP saw some use, but the 64-bit versions
of Vista took the 64-bit OS into the mainstream.
Explain the Windows interface
■
Every version of Windows supports multiple users
on a single machine, so the starting point for any
tour of the Windows user interface starts with the
login screen. Windows 2000 has a straightforward
login screen where you enter a user name and
password. Windows XP offers the Welcome screen
in addition to the standard login, where users can
click an icon next to their user name to log in,
although this feature is disabled in a domain
environment. Windows Vista has a beefed-up
132
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Welcome screen that works in both a workgroup
and a domain.
■
The Windows desktop is the primary interface to
the computer in every version of Windows.
Windows Vista differs from previous versions of
Windows with the use of transparencies and other
nice features of the Windows Aero interface. Flip
3D enables users to quickly and visually cycle
through open programs.
■
Some of the important items on the desktop are the
taskbar, Start button, Quick Launch toolbar, and
notification area, or system tray. The taskbar shows
running programs. The Start button gives you
access to the Start menu where you can run
installed applications. The Quick Launch toolbar
enables you to select often-used programs with a
single click, though it’s not displayed by default in
Windows XP. The notification area shows icons for
applications running in the background, such as
your antivirus software.
■
My Computer in Windows 2000 and Windows XP
and Computer in Windows Vista offer access to the
files and folders on mass storage drives on the
computer. To view the contents of any device,
double-click its icon in My Computer/Computer.
You can tell by a file’s icon or extension—if you
alter the default folder view to show file
extensions—what type of file it is, such as a .JPG
picture file.
■
Windows Explorer is the main tool for observing
and manipulating files on a system. The tool differs
in some ways among the versions tested on the
CompTIA A+ Essentials exam. Windows Explorer
and My Computer/Computer are two facets of the
same application in Windows XP and Windows
Vista but two distinct applications in Windows
2000.
■
When you delete a file in Windows, it moves into
the Recycle Bin. It stays there until you empty the
Recycle Bin or restore the file, or until the Recycle
Bin reaches a preset size and starts erasing its
oldest contents.
■
Windows offers many useful keyboard key
combinations for accomplishing common tasks.
Some combinations work specifically with the
operating system utilities, such as pressing the
WINDOWS KEY and the PAUSE key to open the
System applet. Other combinations work
throughout most applications, such as CTRL-C to
copy something and CTRL-V to paste whatever was
copied.
Explain some advanced Windows features
■
The Registry is a database that stores everything
about your PC, including information on all of the
hardware in the PC, network information, user
preferences, file types, and virtually anything else
you might run into with Windows. The Registry is
composed of several hives.
■
You can access the Registry Editor by typing
regedt32 or regedit at the Start | Run menu or at
the Start | Start Search dialog box, depending on
the version of Windows.
■
The Registry has five root keys that define various
elements of Windows. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT,
for example, defines the standard class objects used
by Windows. A class object is a named group of
functions that define what you can do with the
object it represents. A .JPG file is defined here, for
example, as a type of image file associated with a
specific program.
■
The Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is
simply a shell program in Windows that holds
individual utilities called snap-ins. These snap-ins
enable you to accomplish varying tech tasks. You
can create custom MMCs or use ones preconfigured
by Microsoft.
■
The Administrative Tools in the Control Panel are
preconfigured MMCs, such as Computer
Management and Event Viewer. Users rarely need
to access these MMCs, but techs know their
Administrative Tools.
■
Windows uses a portion of the hard drive as an
extension of system RAM, through what’s called a
page file. A page file is a block of cylinders on a
hard drive set aside as what’s called a RAM cache,
swap file, or virtual memory. When the PC starts
running out of real RAM because you’ve loaded
too many programs, the system swaps programs
from RAM to the page file, opening more space for
programs currently active.
Maintain Windows
■
The Internet has enabled Microsoft to make
updates available, and Windows Update can grab
those updates and patch user systems easily and
automatically. Keeping your system updated
prevents viruses and malicious software from
Chapter 4: Understanding Windows
133

exploiting vulnerabilities in your operating system.
With the release of Windows XP Service Pack 2,
Microsoft began pushing for wholesale acceptance
of automatic updates from Windows Update.
However, you can customize automatic updates to
allow various levels of automation.
■
You have two choices when updating your system
with Windows Update: Express installation or
Custom installation. An Express installation
installs only the essential security fixes and
patches; a Custom installation enables you to select
from a wide range of software and driver updates.
■
Disk Cleanup clears out the junk files that
accumulate from daily use. You can reach this tool
through the Start menu (Start | All Programs |
Accessories | System Tools), or you can open My
Computer or Computer, right-click the drive you
want to clean up, select Properties, and click the
Disk Cleanup button.
■
Keeping your Registry clean ensures that your
system continues to run efficiently and without
errors. Unfortunately, Microsoft doesn’t offer any
built-in Registry cleaner tools, so you have to use
third-party tools such as CCleaner to perform
this task.
■
If your computer is going to be connected to the
Internet, it’s critical that you run some sort of
antispyware or antivirus software on your system.
■
When you can’t find a software reason for a
problem such as a system freezing on shutdown,
the problem might be the actual physical hard
drive. The tool to investigate that is Error-checking.
You can perform Error-checking from a command
line or the Start | Run dialog box, using the
CHKDSK command.
■
Run the Disk Defragmenter on a regular basis to
keep your system from slowing down because of
files scattered in pieces on your hard drive.
■
Maintenance only works properly when it’s done
at regular intervals. You can use Task Scheduler to
schedule regular maintenance on your computer.
■
The System Configuration utility enables techs
to edit and troubleshoot operating system and
program startup processes and services. Prior to
Windows Vista, the System Configuration utility
also offered quick access to troubleshoot and edit
the BOOT.INI file.
Optimize Windows
■
Windows comes with the System Information tool,
which collects information about hardware
resources, components, and the software
environment. When it finishes doing that, it
provides a nice and tidy little report, allowing you
to troubleshoot and diagnose any issues and
conflicts. You can also use System Information to
gather information about remote computers by
simply selecting View | Remote Computer and
then entering the remote computer’s network
machine name.
■
Windows supports Autorun, a feature that enables
it to look for and read a special file called Autorun
immediately after a removable media device
(optical disc or thumb drive) is inserted and then
run whatever program is listed in AUTORUN.INF.
If you need to install a program manually, however,
you can use the Add or Remove Programs applet
in the Control Panel. With Windows Vista/7,
you most likely will be prompted by UAC when
installing an application. This is to give you time
to review what is happening to your system in
case you did not approve of the program being
installed.
■
Each installed application program takes up space
on your computer’s hard drive, and programs that
you no longer need simply waste space that could
be used for other purposes. Removing unnecessary
programs can be an important piece of optimization.
You remove programs by using the Add or Remove
Programs applet in the Control Panel by selecting
the desired program from the list of installed
programs and then clicking Uninstall.
■
The third function of the Add or Remove Programs
applet is to add or remove Windows components
and features. This is done by selecting Add/
Remove Windows Components, which opens the
Windows Components Wizard. In Windows
Vista/7, Windows Components have been
renamed to Windows Features.
■
Windows/Microsoft Update provides an easy
method to update drivers from manufacturers that
take advantage of the service. If you are using
2000/XP, the only trick to this is that you usually
need to select the Custom option to see these
updates because Windows only installs high-
priority updates when using the Express option.
134
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

When you click on the Custom option, look under
Hardware, Optional (on the left) to see if Windows
has any driver updates. If you are using Vista/7,
you will need to click View available updates to see if
any drivers are available for your system.
■
Device drivers become part of the operating system
and thus have the potential to cause lots of
problems if they’re written poorly. To protect
Windows systems from bad device drivers,
Microsoft uses driver signing, which means that
each driver has a digital signature. When an
unsigned driver is detected during hardware
installation, you’ll see a message offering you the
choice to stop or continue the installation. Signed
drivers are more or less a sure thing, but that
doesn’t mean unsigned ones are a problem—just
consider the source of the driver when installing it.
You can control how Windows behaves when
drivers are being installed by clicking the Driver
Signing button on the Hardware tab of the System
Properties dialog box. This displays the Driver
Signing Options dialog box. If you select Ignore,
Windows will install an unsigned driver without
warning you.
■
Right-clicking on a device in Device Manager
displays the context menu. From here you can
update or uninstall the driver, disable the device,
scan for hardware changes, or display the
Properties dialog box. The Driver tab has buttons
labeled Driver Details, Update Driver, Roll Back
Driver, and Uninstall. The Roll Back Driver option
enables you to remove an updated driver, thus
rolling back to the previous driver version.
■
Windows should automatically detect any new
device you install in your system. If not, use the
Add Hardware Wizard (or simply Add Hardware
if using Vista) to get the device recognized and
drivers installed. You’ll find it on the Hardware tab
of the System Properties dialog box.
■
One optimization you can perform on all Windows
versions is setting Performance Options. Performance
Options are used to configure CPU, RAM, and
virtual memory (page file) settings. In Windows
2000, the Performance Options dialog box shows
a pair of radio buttons called Applications and
Background Services that set how processor time is
divided between the foreground application and
all other background tasks. In Windows XP, Vista,
and 7, the Performance Options dialog box has
three tabs: Visual Effects, Advanced, and Data
Execution Prevention. The Visual Effects tab
enables you to adjust visual effects that impact
performance. The Advanced tab has three sections:
Processor scheduling, Memory usage (not in Vista),
and Virtual memory.
■
Microsoft introduced Data Execution Prevention
(DEP) with Windows XP Service Pack 2. DEP
works in the background to stop viruses and other
malware from taking over programs loaded in
system memory. It doesn’t prevent viruses from
being installed on your computer, but makes them
less effective.
■
Task Manager is a great tool for investigating how
hard your RAM and CPU are working at any given
moment and why. The Performance tab reveals a
handy screen with the most commonly used
information: CPU usage, available physical
memory, the size of the disk cache, commit charge
(memory for programs), and kernel memory
(memory used by Windows). Task Manager also
tells you which program is using your system
resources.
■
The Performance console is used to log resource
usage so you can track items such as CPU and
RAM usage over time.
■
System Monitor gathers real-time data on objects
such as memory, physical disk, processor, and
network, and displays this data as a graph (line
graph), histogram (bar graph), or simple report.
■
The Performance Logs and Alerts snap-in enables
Windows to create a written record of just about
anything that happens on your system.
■
The most important data on your computer is the
personal data: your documents, e-mail messages
and contacts, Web favorites, photographs, and
other files. To handle backing up personal data,
every version of Windows comes with some form
of backup utility.
■
Windows 2000 Backup and Windows XP Backup
Utility (NTBackup) provides almost all the tools
you need to back up files and folders. It has come
a long way from its origins in Windows NT.
NTBackup supports a greater variety of devices,
enabling you to back up to network drives, logical
drives, tape, and removable disks (but not optical
discs).

■
The Windows 2000 Emergency Repair Disk (ERD)
saves critical boot files and partition information
and is your main tool for fixing boot problems in
Windows 2000.
■
The Windows XP Automated System Recovery
(ASR) enables you to create a backup of your
system. This backup includes a floppy disk and
backup media (tape or CD-R) containing the
system partition and disks containing operating
system components.
■
The archive bit works basically like this: Whenever
a file is saved, the archive bit is turned on. Simply
opening a file affects the current state of the
archive bit. Backup programs usually turn off a
file’s archive bit when the file is backed up. If the
archive bit is turned on, it means that the file has
been changed since it was last backed up.
■
A normal backup is a full backup. Every file
selected is backed up, and the archive bit is turned
off for every file backed up.
■
A copy backup is identical to a normal backup,
except that the archive bits are not changed. This is
used (although not often) for making extra copies
of a previously completed backup.
■
An incremental backup includes only files with the
archive bit turned on. In other words, it copies only
the files that have been changed since the last
backup. This backup turns off the archive bits.
■
A differential backup is identical to an incremental
backup, except that it doesn’t turn off the archive bits.
■
A daily backup, also known as a daily copy backup,
makes copies of all the files that have been changed
that day. It does not change the archive bits.
■
In Windows Vista/7, NTBackup has been replaced
with the Windows Backup and Restore Center,
which has only two options: back up everything or
restore from a previous backup. Vista no longer
supports tape backups, nor does it let you choose
between differential and incremental backups.
■
You can use the System Restore tool to create a
restore point, a copy of your computer’s
configuration at a specific point in time. If you later
crash or have a corrupted OS, you can restore the
system to its previous state. During the restore
process, only settings and programs are changed.
No data is lost. Your computer will include all
programs and settings as of the restore date.
System Restore is turned on by default and uses
some of your disk space to save information on
restore points. To turn System Restore off or
change the disk space usage, open the System
Properties applet in Control Panel and select the
System Restore tab.
■
The Recovery Console is a text-based startup of
Windows that gets you to a command prompt
similar to the Windows command prompt. If you
have the Windows 2000/XP CD-ROM, you can
start the Recovery Console by running Setup,
selecting Repair, and then selecting Recovery
Console.
■
Windows Vista and Windows 7 have dropped the
Recovery Console, replacing it with the graphical
System Recovery Options. Startup Repair tells
Windows to automatically attempt to repair your
system. You can also perform a system restore
from the System Recovery Options. The Memory
Diagnostic Tool locates and reports RAM errors to
you. The command prompt is also accessible from
the System Recovery Options.

or all practical purposes, the terms microprocessor and central processing
unit (CPU) mean the same thing: it’s that big chip inside your computer
that many people often describe as the brain of the system. CPU makers name
their microprocessors in a fashion similar to the automobile industry: CPU
names get a make and a model, such as Intel Core i7 or AMD Phenom II X4. But
what’s happening inside the CPU to make it able to do the amazing things asked
of it every time you step up to the keyboard?

Historical/Conceptual
■CPU Core Components
Although the computer might seem to act quite intelligently, comparing the
CPU to a human brain hugely overstates its capabilities. A CPU functions
more like a very powerful calculator than like a brain—but, oh, what a cal-
culator! Today’s CPUs add, subtract, multiply, divide, and move billions of
numbers per second. Processing that much information so quickly makes
any CPU look intelligent. It’s simply the speed of the CPU, rather than ac-
tual intelligence, that enables computers to perform feats such as accessing
the Internet, playing visually stunning games, or creating graphics.
A good PC technician needs to understand some basic CPU functions to
support PCs, so let’s start with an analysis of how the CPU works. If you
wanted to teach someone how an automobile engine works, you would use
a relatively simple example engine, right? The same principle applies here.
Let’s begin our study of the CPU with the granddaddy of all PC CPUs: the
famous Intel 8088, invented in the late 1970s. Although this CPU first ap-
peared over 25 years ago, it defined the idea of the modern microprocessor
and contains the same basic parts used in even the most advanced CPUs to-
day. Stick with me, my friend. Prepare to enter that little bit of magic called
the CPU.
The Man in the Box
Let’s begin by visualizing the CPU as a man in a
box (Figure 5.1). This is one clever guy in this
box. He can perform virtually any mathematical
function, manipulate data, and give answers
very quickly.
This guy is potentially very useful to us, but
there’s a catch—he lives closed up in a tiny box.
Before he can work with us, we must come up
with a way to exchange information with him
(Figure 5.2).
Imagine that we install a set of 16 light bulbs,
8 inside his box and 8 outside his box. Each of
the 8 light bulbs inside the box connects to one of the
8 bulbs outside the box to form a pair. Each pair of
light bulbs is always either on or off. You can control
the 8 pairs of bulbs by using a set of 8 switches out-
side the box, and the Man in the Box can also control
them by using an identical set of 8 switches inside the
box. This light-bulb communication device is called
the external data bus (EDB).
Figure 5.3 shows a cutaway view of the external
data bus. When either you or the Man in the Box flips
a switch on, both light bulbs go on, and the switch on
the other side is also flipped to the on position. If you
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
141
• Figure 5.1
Imagine the CPU as a man in a box.
• Figure 5.2
How do we talk to the Man in the Box?

or the Man in the Box turns a switch off, the light
bulbs on both sides are turned off, along with the
other switch for that pair.
Can you see how this works? By creating on/
off patterns with the light bulbs that represent dif-
ferent pieces of data or commands, you can send
that information to the Man in the Box, and he can
send information back in the same way—assuming
that you agree ahead of time on what the different pat-
terns of lights mean. To accomplish this, you need
some sort of codebook that assigns meanings to the
many patterns of lights that the external data bus
might display. Keep this thought in mind while we
push the analogy a bit more.
Before going any further, make sure you’re
clear on the fact that this is an analogy, not reality.
There really is an external data bus, but you won’t
see any light bulbs or switches on the CPU. You
can, however, see little wires sticking out of the
CPU (Figure 5.4). If you apply voltage to one of
these wires, you in essence flip the switch. Get the
idea? So if that wire had voltage, and if a tiny light
bulb were attached to the wire, that light bulb would glow, would it
not? By the same token, if the wire had no power, the light bulb would
not glow. That is why the switch-and-light-bulb analogy may help you
picture these little wires constantly flashing on and off.
Now that the external data bus enables you to communicate with
the Man in the Box, you need to see how it works by placing voltages
on the wires. This brings up a naming problem. It’s a hassle to say
something like “on-off-on-off-on-on-off-off” when talking about
which wires have voltage. Rather than saying that one of the external
data bus wires is on or off, use the number 1 to represent on and the
number 0 to represent off (Figure 5.5). That way, instead of describing
the state of the lights as “on-off-on-off-on-on-off-off,” I can instead de-
scribe them by writing “10101100.”
In the world of computers, we constantly turn wires on and off. As
a result, we can use this “1 and 0” or binary system to describe the state
of these wires at any given moment. (See, and you just thought com-
puter geeks spoke in binary to confuse normal people. Ha!) There’s
much more to binary numbering in the world of computing, but this is
a great place to start. We will revisit the binary numbering system in
greater detail in Chapter 7, “Learning Motherboards.”

Registers
The Man in the Box provides good in-
sight into the workspace inside a CPU.
The EDB gives you a way to communi-
cate with the Man in the Box so you can
give him work to do. But to do this
work, he needs a worktable; in fact, he
needs at least four worktables. Each of
these four worktables has 16 light bulbs.
These light bulbs are not in pairs;
they’re just 16 light bulbs lined up
straight across the table. Each light bulb
is controlled by a single switch, oper-
ated only by the Man in the Box. By cre-
ating on/off patterns like the ones on
the EDB, the Man in the Box can use these four sets of
light bulbs to work math problems. In a real computer,
these worktables are called registers (Figure 5.6).
Registers provide the Man in the Box with a work-
place for the problems you give him. All CPUs contain
a large number of registers, but for the moment let’s
concentrate on the four most common ones: the gen-
eral-purpose registers. Intel named them AX, BX, CX,
and DX.
Great! We’re just about ready to put the Man in the
Box to work, but before you close the lid on the box,
you must give the Man one more tool. Remember the
codebook we mentioned earlier? Let’s make one to en-
able us to communicate with him. Figure 5.7 shows the
codebook we’ll use. We’ll give one copy to him and
make a second for us.
In this codebook, for example, 10000111 means
Move the number 7 into the AX register. These com-
mands are called the microprocessor’s machine lan-
guage. The commands listed in the figure are not actual
commands; as you’ve probably guessed, I’ve simpli-
fied dramatically. The Intel 8088 CPU, invented in the
late 1970s, actually used commands very similar to
these, plus a few hundred others.
Here are some examples of real machine language
for the Intel 8088:
10111010
The next line of code is a number. Put that number into the DX
register.
01000001
Add 1 to the number already in the CX register.
00111100
Compare the value in the AX register with the next line of code.
By placing machine language commands—called lines of code—onto the
external data bus one at a time, you can instruct the Man in the Box to do
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
143
• Figure 5.6
The four general-purpose registers
• Figure 5.7
CPU codebook

specific tasks. All of the machine language com-
mands that the CPU understands make up the
CPU’s instruction set.
So here is the CPU so far: the Man in the Box
can communicate with the outside world via the
external data bus; he has four registers he can
use to work on the problems you give him; and
he has a codebook—the instruction set—so he
can understand the different patterns (machine
language commands) on the external data bus
(Figure 5.8).
Clock
Okay, so you’re ready to put the Man in the Box
to work. You can send the first command by
lighting up wires on the EDB. How does he know when you’ve finished set-
ting up the wires and it’s time to act?
Have you ever seen one of those old-time manual calculators with the
big crank on one side? To add two numbers, you pressed a number key, the
+ key, and another number key, but then to make the calculator do the calcu-
lation and give you the answer, you had to pull
down the crank. That was the signal that you
had finished entering data and instructions and
were ready for the calculator to give you an
answer.
Well, a CPU also has a type of crank. To re-
turn to the Man in the Box, imagine there’s a bell
inside the box activated by a button on the out-
side of the box. Each time you press the button
to sound the bell, the Man in the Box reads the
next set of lights on the external data bus. Of
course, a real computer doesn’t use a bell. The
bell on a real CPU is a special wire called the
clock wire (most diagrams label the clock wire
CLK). A charge on the CLK wire tells the CPU
that another piece of information is waiting to be
processed (Figure 5.9).
For the CPU to process a command placed on
the external data bus, a certain minimum voltage
must be applied to the CLK wire. A single charge
to the CLK wire is called a clock cycle. Actually,
the CPU requires at least two clock cycles to act
on a command, and usually more. Using the
manual calculator analogy, you need to pull the
crank at least twice before anything happens. In
fact, a CPU may require hundreds of clock cycles
to process some commands (Figure 5.10).
The maximum number of clock cycles that a
CPU can handle in a given period of time is re-
ferred to as its clock speed. The clock speed is the
144

• Figure 5.10
The CPU often needs more than one clock cycle to get
a result.

fastest speed at which a CPU can operate, determined by the CPU manufac-
turer. The Intel 8088 processor had a clock speed of 4.77 MHz (4.77 million
cycles per second), extremely slow by modern standards, but still a pretty
big number compared to using a pencil and paper. CPUs today run at
speeds in excess of 3 GHz (3 billion cycles per second).
1 hertz (1 Hz) = 1 cycle per second
1 megahertz (1 MHz) = 1 million cycles per second
1 gigahertz (1 GHz) = 1 billion cycles per second
Understand that a CPU’s clock speed is its maximum speed, not the
speed at which it must run. A CPU can run at any speed, as long as that
speed does not exceed its clock speed. Manufacturers used to print the
CPU’s clock speed directly onto the CPU, but for the past few years
they’ve used cryptic codes (Figure 5.11). As the chapter progresses you’ll
see why they do this.
The system crystal determines the speed at which a CPU and the rest of
the PC operate. The system crystal is usually a quartz oscillator, very simi-
lar to the one in a wristwatch, soldered to the motherboard (Figure 5.12).
The quartz oscillator sends out an electric pulse at a certain speed, many
millions of times per second. This signal goes first to a clock chip that ad-
justs the pulse, usually increasing the pulse sent by the crystal by some
large multiple. (The folks who make motherboards could connect the crys-
tal directly to the CPU’s clock wire, but then if you wanted to replace your
CPU with a CPU with a different clock speed, you’d need to replace the crys-
tal too.) As long as the PC is turned on, the quartz oscillator, through the
clock chip, fires a charge on the CLK wire, in essence pushing the system
along.
Visualize the system crystal as a metronome for the CPU. The quartz os-
cillator repeatedly fires a charge on the CLK wire, setting the beat, if you
will, for the CPU’s activities. If the system crystal sets a beat slower than the
CPU’s clock speed, the CPU will work just fine, though at the slower speed
of the system crystal. If the system crystal forces the CPU to run faster than
its clock speed, it can overheat and stop working.
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
145
CPU makers sell the exact
make and model of CPU at a
number of different speeds. All
of these CPUs come off of the
same assembly lines, so why
different speeds? Every CPU
comes with subtle differences—
flaws, really—in the silicon that
makes one CPU run faster than
another. The speed difference
comes from testing each CPU to
see what speed it can handle.
• Figure 5.11
Where is the clock speed?
• Figure 5.12
One of many types of system crystals
Aggressive users sometimes
intentionally overclock CPUs by
telling the clock chip to multiply
the pulse faster than the CPU’s
designed speed. They do this to
make slower (cheaper) CPUs run
faster. This is a risky business
that can destroy your CPU, but
those willing to take that risk
often do it.

Before you install a CPU into a system, you must make sure that the
crystal and clock chip send out the correct clock pulse for that particular
CPU. In the not-so-old days, this required very careful adjustments. With
today’s systems, the motherboard talks to the CPU (at a very slow speed),
the CPU tells the motherboard the clock speed it needs, and the clock chip
automatically adjusts for the CPU, making this process now invisible.
Back to the External Data Bus
One more reality check. We’ve been talking about tables with racks of light
bulbs, but of course real CPU registers don’t use light bulbs to represent on/
1 and off/0. Registers are tiny storage areas on the CPU, microscopic semi-
conductor circuits. When one of these circuits holds a charge, you can think
of the light bulb as on; no charge, the light bulb is off.
Figure 5.13 is a diagram of a real 8088 CPU, showing the wires that com-
prise the external data bus and the single clock wire. Because the registers
are inside the CPU, you can’t see them in this figure.
Now that you have learned what components are involved in the pro-
cess, try the following simple exercise to see how the process works. In this
example, you tell the CPU to add 2 + 3. To do this, you must send a series of
commands to the CPU; the CPU will act on each command, eventually giv-
ing you an answer. Refer to the codebook in Figure 5.7 to translate the in-
structions you’re giving the Man in the Box into binary commands.
Did you try it? Here’s how it works:
1.
Place 10000000 on the external data bus (EDB).
2.
Place 00000010 on the EDB.
3.
Place 10010000 on the EDB.
4.
Place 00000011 on the EDB.
5.
Place 10110000 on the EDB.
6.
Place 11000000 on the EDB.
When you finish step 6, the value on the EDB will be 00000101, the deci-
mal number 5 written in binary.
Congrats! You just added 2 + 3 by using individual commands from the
codebook. This set of commands is known as a program, which is a series of
commands sent to a CPU in a specific order for the CPU to perform work.
Each discrete setting of the external data bus is a line of code. This program,
therefore, has six lines of code.
■Memory
Now that you’ve seen how the CPU executes program code, let’s work back-
ward in the process for a moment and think about how the program code
gets to the external data bus. The program itself is stored on the hard drive.
In theory, you could build a computer that sends data from the hard drive
directly to the CPU, but there’s a problem—the hard drive is too slow. Even
the ancient 8088, with its clock speed of 4.77 MHz, could conceivably
146
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Some motherboards enable
you to override the default or
automatic settings by changing
a jumper or making a change
in CMOS. A few enthusiasts’
motherboards even enable you
to make software changes to
alter the speed of your CPU.
• Figure 5.13

process several million lines of code every second. Modern CPUs crank out
billions of lines every second. Hard drives simply can’t give the data to the
CPU at a fast enough speed.
Computers need some other device that takes copies of programs from
the hard drive and then sends them, one line at a time, to the CPU quickly
enough to keep up with its demands. Because each line of code is nothing
more than a pattern of eight ones and zeros, any device that can store ones
and zeros eight-across will do. Devices that in any way hold ones and zeros
that the CPU accesses are known generically as memory.
Many types of devices store ones and zeros perfectly welltechnically
even a piece of paper counts as memorybut computers need memory that
does more than just store groups of eight ones and zeros. Consider this
pretend program:
1.
Put 2 in the AX register.
2.
Put 5 in the BX register.
3.
If AX is greater than BX, run line 4; otherwise, go to line 6.
4.
Add 1 to the value in AX.
5.
Go back to line 1.
6.
Put the value of AX on the EDB.
This program has an IF statement, also called a branch by CPU makers.
The CPU needs a way to address each line of this memorya way for the
CPU to say to the memory, “Give me the next line of code” or “Give me line
6.” Addressing memory takes care of another problem: the memory must
not only store programs but also store the result of the programs. If the CPU
adds 2 + 3 and gets 5, the memory needs to store that 5 in such a way that
other programs may later read that 5, or possibly even store that 5 on a hard
drive. By addressing each line of memory, other programs will know where
to find the data.
Memory and RAM
Memory must store not only programs but also data. The CPU
needs to be able to read and write to this storage medium. Ad-
ditionally, this system must enable the CPU to jump to any
line of stored code as easily as to any other line of code. All of
this must be done at or at least near the clock speed of the
CPU. Fortunately, this magical device has existed for many
years: random access memory (RAM).
In Chapter 6, “Learning RAM,” the concept of RAM is de-
veloped in detail, so for now let’s look at RAM as an electronic
spreadsheet, like one you can generate in Microsoft Excel
(Figure 5.14). Each cell in this spreadsheet can store only a one
or a zero. Each cell is called a bit. Each row in the spreadsheet is
eight bits across to match the external data bus of the 8088. Each
row of eight bits is called a byte. In the PC world, RAM trans-
fers and stores data to and from the CPU in byte-sized chunks.
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
147
• Figure 5.14
RAM as a spreadsheet

RAM is therefore arranged in byte-sized rows. Here are the terms used to
talk about quantities of bits:
■
Any individual 1 or 0 = a bit
■
4 bits = a nibble
■
8 bits = a byte
■
16 bits = a word
■
32 bits = a double word
■
64 bits = a paragraph or quad word
The number of bytes of RAM varies from PC to PC.
In earlier PCs, from around 1980 to 1990, the typical sys-
tem would have only a few hundred thousand bytes of
RAM. Today’s systems often have billions of bytes of
RAM.
Let’s stop here for a quick reality check. Elec-
tronically, RAM looks like a spreadsheet, but real RAM
is made of groups of semiconductor chips soldered onto
small cards that snap into your computer (Figure 5.15).
In Chapter 6, “Learning RAM,” you’ll see how these
groups of chips actually make themselves look like a
spreadsheet. For now, don’t worry about real RAM and
just stick with the spreadsheet idea.
The CPU accesses any one row of RAM as easily and as fast as any other
row, which explains the “random access” part of RAM. Not only is RAM
randomly accessible, it’s also fast. By storing programs on RAM, the CPU
can access and run them very quickly. RAM also stores any data that the
CPU actively uses.
Computers use dynamic RAM (DRAM) for the main system memory.
DRAM needs both a constant electrical charge and a periodic refresh of the
circuits; otherwise, it loses data—that’s what makes it dynamic rather than
static in content. The refresh can cause some delays, because the CPU has to
wait for the refresh to happen, but modern CPU manufacturers have clever
ways to get by this issue, as you’ll see when you read about the generations
of processors later in this chapter.
Don’t confuse RAM with mass storage devices such as hard drives and
flash drives. You use hard drives and flash drives to store programs and
data permanently. Chapter 9, “Hard Drive Technologies,” and Chapter 10,
“Removable Media,” discuss permanent storage in intimate detail.
Address Bus
So far, the entire PC consists of only a CPU and RAM. But the CPU
and the RAM need some connection so they can talk to each other.
To do so, extend the external data bus from the CPU so it can talk
to the RAM (Figure 5.16).
Wait a minute. This is not a matter of just plugging the RAM
into the external data bus wires! RAM is a spreadsheet with thou-
sands and thousands of discrete rows, and you only need to look at
the contents of one row of the spreadsheet at a time, right? So how
148
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 5.15
Typical RAM
• Figure 5.16
Extending the EDB

do you connect the RAM to the external data bus in
such a way that the CPU can see any one given row
but still give the CPU the capability to look at any
row in RAM? We need some type of chip between
the RAM and the CPU to make the connection. The
CPU needs to be able to say which row of RAM it
wants, and the chip should handle the mechanics of
retrieving that row of data from the RAM and putt-
ing it on the external data bus. Wouldn’t you know
I just happen to have such a chip? This chip comes
with many names, but for right now just call it the
memory controller chip (MCC).
The MCC contains special circuitry so it can
grab the contents of any single line of RAM and
place that data or command on the external data
bus. This in turn enables the CPU to act on that code
(Figure 5.17).
Once the MCC is in place to grab any discrete
byte of RAM, the CPU needs to be able to tell the
MCC which line of code it needs. The CPU there-
fore gains a second set of wires, called the address
bus, with which it can communicate with the MCC.
Different CPUs have different numbers of wires
(which, you will soon see, is very significant). The
8088 had 20 wires in its address bus (Figure 5.18).
By turning the address bus wires on and off in
different patterns, the CPU tells the MCC which
line of RAM it wants at any given moment. Every
different pattern of ones and zeros on these 20 wires
points to one byte of RAM. There are two big ques-
tions here. First, how many different patterns of on-
and-off wires can exist with 20 wires? And second,
which pattern goes to which row of RAM?
How Many Patterns?
Mathematics can answer the first question. Each wire in the address bus ex-
ists in only one of two states: on or off. If the address bus consisted of only
one wire, that wire would at any given moment be either on or off. Mathe-
matically, that gives you (pull out your old pre-algebra books) 21 = 2 differ-
ent combinations. If you have two address bus wires, the address bus wires
create 22 = 4 different combinations. If you have 20 wires, you would have
220 (or 1,048,576) combinations. Because each pattern points to one line of
code and each line of RAM is one byte, if you know the number of wires in
the CPU’s address bus, you know the maximum amount of RAM that a par-
ticular CPU can handle.
Because the 8088 had a 20-wire address bus, the most RAM it could han-
dle was 220 or 1,048,576 bytes. The 8088, therefore, had an address space of
1,048,576 bytes. This is not to say that every computer with an 8088 CPU had
1,048,576 bytes of RAM. Far from it! The original IBM PC only had a measly
64 kilobytes—but that was considered plenty back in the Dark Ages of Com-
puting in the early 1980s.
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
149
• Figure 5.17
The MCC grabs a byte of RAM.
• Figure 5.18
Address bus

Okay, so you know that the 8088 had 20 address wires and a total ad-
dress space of 1,048,576 bytes. Although this is accurate, no one uses such an
exact term to discuss the address space of the 8088. Instead you say that the
8088 had one megabyte (1 MB) of address space.
What’s a “mega”? Well, let’s get some terminology down. Dealing with
computers means constantly dealing with the number of patterns a set of
wires can handle. Certain powers of 2 have names used a lot in the comput-
ing world. The following list explains.
1 kilo = 210 = 1024 (abbreviated as “K”)
1 kilobyte = 1024 bytes (abbreviated as “KB”)
1 mega = 220 = 1,048,576 (abbreviated as “M”)
1 megabyte = 1,048,576 bytes (abbreviated as “MB”)
1 giga = 230 = 1,073,741,824 (abbreviated as “G”)
1 gigabyte = 1,073,741,824 bytes (abbreviated as “GB”)
1 tera = 240 = 1,099,511,627,776 (abbreviated as “T”)
1 terabyte = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes (abbreviated as “TB”)
1 kilo is not equal to 1000 (one thousand)
1 mega is not equal to 1,000,000 (one million)
1 giga is not equal to 1,000,000,000 (one billion)
1 tera is not equal to 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion)
(But they are pretty close!)
Of course, 1 kilo is equal to 1000 when you talk in terms of the metric sys-
tem. It also means 1000 when you talk about the clock speed of a chip, so 1 KHz
is equal to 1000 Hz. When you talk storage capacity, though, the binary num-
bers kick in, making 1 KB = 1024 bytes. Got it? This same bizarre dual meaning
applies all the way up the food chain, so 1 MHz is 1,000,000 Hz, but 1 MB is
1,048,576 bytes; 1 GHz is 1 billion Hz, but 1 GB is 1,073,741,824 bytes; and so on.
Which Pattern Goes to Which Row?
The second question is a little harder: “Which pattern goes to which row of
RAM?” To understand this, let’s take a moment to discuss binary counting.
In binary, only two numbers exist, 0 and 1, which makes binary a handy way
to work with wires that turn on and off. Let’s try to count in binary: 0,
1…what’s next? It’s not 2—you can only use zeros and ones. The next num-
ber after 1 is 10! Now let’s count in binary to 1000: 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110,
111, 1000. Try counting to 10000. Don’t worry; it hardly takes any time at all.
Super; you now count in binary as well as any math professor. Let’s add
to the concept. Stop thinking about binary for just a moment and think about
good old base 10 (regular numbers). If you have the number 365, can you
put zeros in front of the 365, like this: 000365? Sure you can—it doesn’t
change the value at all. The same thing is true in binary. Putting zeros in
front of a value doesn’t change a thing! Let’s count again to 1000 in binary. In
this case, add enough zeros to make 20 places:
00000000000000000000
00000000000000000001
150
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Bits and bytes are abbrevi-
ated differently. Bytes get a
capital B whereas bits get a low-
ercase b. So for example, 4 KB is
four kilobytes, but 4 Kb is four
kilobits.

00000000000000000010
00000000000000000011
00000000000000000100
00000000000000000101
00000000000000000110
00000000000000000111
00000000000000001000
Hey! This would be a great way to represent each line of RAM on the ad-
dress bus, wouldn’t it? The CPU identifies the first byte of RAM on the ad-
dress bus with 00000000000000000000. The CPU identifies the last RAM row
with 11111111111111111111. When the CPU turns off all of the address bus
wires, it wants the first line of RAM; when it turns on all of the wires, it
wants the 1,048,576th line of RAM. Obviously, the address bus also ad-
dresses all of the rows of RAM in between. So, by lighting up different pat-
terns of ones and zeros on the address bus, the CPU can access any row of
RAM it needs.
■Modern CPUs
Modern CPUs retain the core structures of the Intel 8088, such as registers,
instruction sets, and, of course, the arithmetic logic unit (ALU)—our friend,
the Man in the Box. But in the decades of the personal computer, many man-
ufacturers have risen to challenge Intel’s dominance—some have even sur-
vived—and

This section maps out the modern processor scene. It starts with a brief
look at the manufacturers so you know who the players are. Once you know
who’s making the CPUs, we’ll go through the generations of CPUs in wide
use today, starting with the Intel Pentium. All modern processors share fun-
damental technology first introduced by Intel in the Pentium CPU. I use the
Pentium, therefore, to discuss the details of the shared technology, and then
add specific bonus features when discussing subsequent processors.
Manufacturers
When IBM awarded Intel the contract to provide the CPUs for its new IBM
PC back in 1980, it established for Intel a virtual monopoly on all PC CPUs.
The other home-computer CPU makers of the time faded away: MOS Tech-
nology, Zilog, Motorola—no one could compete directly with Intel. Over
time, other competitors have risen to challenge Intel’s market-segment
share dominance. In particular, a company called Advanced Micro Devices
(AMD) began to make clones of Intel CPUs, creating an interesting and
rather cutthroat competition with Intel that lasts to this day.
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
151

Intel
Intel Corporation thoroughly dominated the personal computer market with
its CPUs and motherboard support chips. At nearly every step in the evolu-
tion of the PC, Intel has led the way with technological advances and surpris-
ing flexibility for such a huge corporation. Intel CPUs—and more specifically,
their instruction sets—define the personal computer. Intel currently produces
a dozen or so models of CPU for both desktop and portable computers. Most
of Intel’s desktop processors are sold under the Celeron, Pentium, and Core
brands. Their very low-power portable/smart phone chips are branded
Atom; their high-end workstation/server ones are called Xeon.
AMD
You can’t really talk about CPUs without mentioning Advanced Micro De-
vices—the Cogswell Cogs to Intel’s Spacely Sprockets. AMD makes superb
CPUs for the PC market and provides competition that keeps Intel on it toes.
Like Intel, AMD doesn’t just make CPUs, but their CPU business is certainly
the part that the public notices. AMD has made CPUs that clone the function
of Intel CPUs. If Intel invented the CPU used in the original IBM PC, how
could AMD make clone CPUs without getting sued? Well, chipmakers have
a habit of exchanging technologies through cross-license agreements. Way
back in 1976, AMD and Intel signed just such an agree-
ment, giving AMD the right to copy certain types of
CPUs.
The trouble started with the Intel 8088. Intel needed
AMD to produce CPUs. The PC business was young back
then, and providing multiple suppliers gave IBM confi-
dence in their choice of CPUs. Life was good. But after a
few years, Intel had grown tremendously and no longer
wanted AMD to make CPUs. AMD said, “Too bad. See
this agreement you signed?” Throughout the 1980s and
into the 1990s, AMD made pin-for-pin identical CPUs
that matched the Intel lines of CPUs (Figure 5.19). You
could yank an Intel CPU out of a system and snap in an
AMD CPU—no problem!
In January 1995, after many years of legal wrangling, Intel and AMD set-
tled and decided to end the licensing agreements. As a result of this settle-
ment, AMD chips are no longer compatible with sockets or motherboards
made for Intel CPUs—even though in some cases the chips look similar. To-
day, if you want to use an AMD CPU, you must purchase a motherboard de-
signed for AMD CPUs. If you want to use an Intel CPU, you must purchase
a motherboard designed for Intel CPUs. So you now have a choice: Intel or
AMD. You’ll look at both brands as you learn more about modern proces-
sors in this chapter.
CPU Packages
One of the many features that make PCs attractive is the ability for users
(okay, maybe advanced users) to replace one CPU with another. If you want
a removable CPU, you need your CPUs to use a standardized package with
a matching standardized socket on the motherboard. CPUs have gone

As we go to print, Intel has
announced a simplified naming
scheme for the majority of its
new processors, all under the
Core brand name. The Core i3,
Core i5, and Core i7 processor
names quickly relay where the
processor fits in relation to other
Core processors. The Core i7 will
offer more power than the Core
i5, for example. My guess is that
they’ll keep the Atom processor
line separate and distinct from
the Core family.

through many packages, with manufacturers changing de-
signs like snakes shedding skins. The fragile little DIP package
of the 8088 (Figure 5.20) gave way to rugged slotted proces-
sors in the late 1990s (Figure 5.21), which have in turn given
way to CPUs using the now prevalent grid array packaging.
The grid array package has been popular since the mid-
1980s. The most common form of grid array is the pin grid ar-
ray (PGA). PGA CPUs are distinguished by their square shape
with many—usually hundreds—of tiny pins (Figure 5.22).
Collectively, Intel and AMD have used close to 100 varia-
tions of the PGA package over the years for hundreds of CPU
models with such names as staggered-PGA, micro-PGA, ball
grid array (which uses tiny balls instead of pins), and land
grid array (which uses flat pads instead of pins). Other variet-
ies of PGA CPUs are based on the number of pins sticking out
of the CPU. The CPUs snap into special sockets on the mother-
board, with each socket designed to match the pins (or balls or pads) on the
CPU. To make CPU insertion and removal easier, these sockets—officially
called zero insertion force (ZIF) sockets—use a small arm on the side of the
socket (Figure 5.23) or a cage that fits over the socket (Figure 5.24) to hold the
CPU in place. ZIF sockets are universal and easily identified by their squar-
ish shape.
The first generations of sockets used a numbering system that started
with Socket 1 and went through Socket 8. Because of the hassle of trying to re-
member how many pins went with each type of socket, CPU makers started
giving all sockets a name based on the number of pins. Most sockets today
have names like Socket 1366 and Socket 775 to reflect the number of pins.

Samples of PGA packages
Never, ever touch or bend the
pins on the bottom of a CPU.
Also, always check for bent pins
before installing a new CPU!
Although there are many
types of PGA packages, most
techs just call them all “PGA.”
AMD CPUs and sockets have
totally different numbering sys-
tems than Intel CPUs and sock-
ets, so techs often use the
name of the socket instead of
AMD or Intel. For example:
“Hey, did you see that Socket
1366 motherboard?”

It’s very important to know the more
common CPU/socket types. As you go
through each type of CPU in this chapter, pay
attention to the socket types used by those
particular CPUs.
The Pentium CPU:
The Early Years
Since the advent of the 8088 way back in the
late 1970s, CPU makers have made many im-
provements. As technology has progressed
from the 8088 to the most current CPUs, the
sizes of the external data bus, address bus,
and registers have grown dramatically. The
clock speeds at which CPUs run have kept
pace, getting faster and faster with each suc-
cessive generation of processor. The 1980s
were an exciting time for CPU technology.
The 8088 CPU was supplanted by a series of improved processors with
names such as 80286, 80386, and 80486 (Figure 5.25). These CPU families in-
corporated wider buses, increasingly higher clock speeds, and other
improvements.
In the early 1990s, Intel unveiled the Pentium CPU. Although no longer
manufactured, the original Pentium CPU was the first Intel CPU to contain
all of the core functions that define today’s modern CPUs.
154

• Figure 5.24
ZIF socket with cage over the top
Many of the CPU features at-
tributed here to the Pentium ac-
tually appeared earlier, but the
Pentium was the first CPU to
have all of these features.

The Pentium retained the core features of the
8088 and subsequent processors, although the clock
was much faster, the address bus and external data
bus were wider, and the registers had more bits.
You’ll also see a number of other improvements
that simply didn’t exist on the original 8088.
The Rise of 32-bit Processing
The old 8088 had 16-bit registers, an 8-bit EDB, and
a 20-bit address bus. Old operating systems (such as
DOS and early versions of Windows) were written
to work on the 8088. Over the years, later CPUs
gradually increased their address buses and gen-
eral-purpose register sizes to 32 bits, allowing much
more powerful operating systems (such as Linux,
Windows XP, and Windows Vista) to work with the
Pentium to process larger numbers at a single time
and to address up to 232 = 4,294,967,296 = 4 gigabytes of RAM
(Figure 5.26). Running 32-bit operating systems on 32-bit
hardware is called 32-bit processing.
Both AMD and Intel now make 64-bit processors that ad-
dress up to 264 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes of RAM. To
take advantage of this larger address bus, a 64-bit version of
the operating system must be used. You’ll learn more about
64-bit processors later in this chapter.
Pipelining
Remember earlier when we talked about pulling the crank multiple times to
get an answer out of the CPU? This is because to get a command from the
EDB, do the calculation, and then get the answer back out on the EDB, the
CPU takes at least four steps (each of these steps is called a stage):
1.
Fetch
Get the data from the EDB.
2.
Decode
Figure out what type of command needs to be done.
3.
Execute
Perform the calculation.
4.
Write
Send the data back onto the EDB.
Smart, discrete circuits inside your CPU handle each of these stages. In
early CPUs, when a command was placed on the EDB, each stage did its job
and the CPU handed back the answer before starting the next command,
requiring at least four clock cycles to process a command. In
every clock cycle, three of the four circuits sat idle. Today, the
circuits are organized in a conveyer-belt fashion called a pipe-
line. With pipelining, each stage does its job with each clock-
cycle pulse, creating a much more efficient process. The CPU
has multiple circuits doing multiple jobs, so let’s add
pipelining to the Man in the Box analogy. Now, it’s Men in the
Box (Figure 5.27)!
Pipelines keep every stage of the processor busy on every
click of the clock, making a CPU run more efficiently without
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs

Simple pipeline

increasing the clock speed. Note that at this point, the CPU has four stages:
fetch, decode, execute, and write—a four-stage pipeline. No CPU ever made
has fewer than four stages, but advancements in caching have increased the
number of stages over the years. Current CPU pipelines contain many more
stages, up to 20 in some cases.
Pipelining isn’t perfect. Sometimes a stage hits a complex command that
requires more than one clock cycle, forcing the pipeline to stop. Your CPU
tries to avoid these stops, called pipeline stalls. The decode stage tends to
cause the most pipeline stalls; certain commands are complex and therefore
harder to decode than other commands. The Pentium used two decode
stages to reduce the chance of pipeline stalls due to complex decoding.
Pipelining certainly helped the Pentium run more efficiently, but there’s
another issue: the execute stage. The inside of the CPU is composed of multi-
ple chunks of circuitry to handle the many types of calculations your
PC needs to do. For example, one part, the integer unit, handles integer
math: basic math for numbers with no decimal point. A perfect ex-
ample of integer math is 2 + 3 = 5. The typical CPU spends more than
90 percent of its work doing integer math. But the Pentium also had
special circuitry to handle complex numbers, called the floating point
unit (FPU). With a single pipeline, only the integer unit or the FPU
worked at any execution stage. Worse yet, floating point calculation of-
ten took many, many clock cycles to execute, forcing the CPU to stall
the pipeline until the floating point unit finished executing the complex
command (Figure 5.28).
To keep things moving, the folks at Intel gave the Pentium two
pipelines: one main, do-everything pipeline and one that only handled
integer math. Although this didn’t stop pipeline stalls, a second pipe-
line kept running when the main one stalled (Figure 5.29).
156
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
After the Pentium, pipelines
kept getting longer, reaching up
to 20 stages in the Pentium 4.
Since then, Intel and AMD have
kept CPU pipelines at around
12 stages (although this could
change again).
You’ll see the integer unit re-
ferred to as the arithmetic logic
unit (ALU) in many sources.
Either term works.
• Figure 5.28
Bored integer unit
• Figure 5.29
The Pentium dual pipeline

The two pipelines on the old Pentium were so successful that Intel and
AMD added more and more pipelines to subsequent CPUs. Most CPUs to-
day have around eight pipelines, although there’s tremendous variance
from CPU to CPU.
CPU Cache
When you send a program to the CPU, you actually run lots of little pro-
grams all at the same time. Okay, let’s be fair here: you didn’t send all of
these little programsyou just started your Web browser or some other
program. The moment you double-
clicked that icon, Windows started
sending lots of programs to the
CPU. Each of these programs breaks
down into some number of little
pieces, called threads, and data. Each
thread is a series of instructions de-
signed to do a particular job with the
data.
Take a look at Figure 5.30. It
shows four programs in RAM: a
Web browser, Solitaire, an image-
editing program, and an e-mail pro-
gram. Note they are not the same
size. Some programs need more
RAM than others.
Modern CPUs don’t execute in-
structions sequentially, first doing
step 1, then step 2, and so on; but
rather process all kinds of instruc-
tions. Most applications have certain
instructions and data that get reused, sometimes many times.
Pipelining CPUs work fantastically well as long as the pipelines stay
filled with instructions. Because the CPU runs faster than the RAM can
supply it with code, you’ll always get pipeline stalls—called wait states—
because the RAM can’t keep up with the CPU. To reduce wait states, the
Pentium came with built-in, very high-speed RAM called static RAM
(SRAM). This SRAM would preload as many instructions as possible and
would also keep copies of already run instructions and data in the hope that
the CPU would need to work on them again (Figure 5.31). SRAM used in
this fashion is called a cache.
The SRAM cache inside the CPU was tiny, only about 16 KB, but it im-
proved performance tremendously. In fact, it helped so much that many
motherboard makers began adding a cache directly to the Pentium mother-
boards. These caches were much larger, usually around 128 to 512 KB.
When the CPU looked for a line of code, it first went to the built-in cache; if
the code wasn’t there, the CPU went to the cache on the motherboard. The
cache on the CPU was called the L1 cache because it was the one the CPU first
tried to use. The cache on the motherboard was called the L2 cache, not be-
cause it was on the motherboard but because it was the second cache the
CPU checked. Later, engineers took this cache concept even further and

One of the biggest differ-
ences between equivalent AMD
and Intel processors is the pipe-
lines. AMD tends to go for lots
of short pipelines, whereas Intel
tends to go with just a few long
pipelines.
• Figure 5.30

as Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3

tively. Any of the terms are
acceptable.

added the L2 cache onboard the CPU. Some CPUs even include three
caches: an L1, an L2, and an L3 cache.
The Pentium was capable of branch prediction, a process whereby the
CPU attempted to anticipate program branches before they got to the CPU
itself. An IF statement provides a nice example of this: “If the value in the
AX register = 5, stop running this code and jump to another memory loca-
tion.” Such a jump would make all of the data in the cache useless. The
Pentium could recognize a branch statement. Using a counter that kept a re-
cord about the direction of the previous branch, the CPU would guess
which way the branch was going to go and make sure that side of the branch
was in its cache. The counter wasn’t perfect, but it was right more often than
it was wrong.
Clock Speed and Multipliers
In the earliest motherboards, the clock chip pushed every chip on the moth-
erboard, not just the CPU. This setup worked great for a while until it be-
came obvious that CPU makers (really Intel) could make CPUs with a much
158

RAM cache
It’s tempting to ask why pro-
cessor manufacturers didn’t just
include bigger L1 caches instead
of making onboard L1 and L2
caches. The answer is that a
very small L1 and a larger L2
are much more efficient than
a single fast L1.

higher clock speed than the rest of the chips on the motherboard. So Intel
had a choice: either stop making faster CPUs or come up with some way to
make CPUs run faster than the rest of the computer.
To overcome this problem, Intel developed clock-multiplying CPUs. A
clock-multiplying CPU takes the incoming clock signal and multiplies it in-
side the CPU to let the internal circuitry of the CPU run faster. The secret to
making clock multiplying work is caching. CPUs with caches spend the ma-
jority of their clock cycles performing calculations and moving data back
and forth within the caches, not sending any data on the external buses.
All modern CPUs are clock multipliers. So in reality, every CPU now has
two clock speeds: the speed that it runs internally and the speed that it runs
when talking on the address bus and the external data bus. Multipliers run
from 2× up to almost 30×! Multipliers do not have to be whole numbers. You
can find a CPU with a multiplier of 6.5× just as easily as you would find one
with a multiplier of 7×. A late-generation Pentium would have an external
speed of 66 MHz multiplied by 4.5× for an internal speed of 300 MHz. The
Intel Pentium 4 3.06-GHz CPU runs at an external speed of 133 MHz with a
23× multiplier to make—yes, you’ve got it—3.06 GHz. Without the inven-
tion of multiplying, modern CPUs would be nowhere near their current
blazing speeds.
The clock speed and the multiplier on Pentium CPU systems
had to be manually configured via jumpers or DIP switches on
the motherboard (Figure 5.32). Today’s CPUs actually report to
the motherboard through a function called CPUID (CPU identi-
fier), and the speed and multiplier are set automatically.
For years, users pushed for faster and faster CPU clock
speeds, because clock speed was considered the most important
way to differentiate one CPU from another. By 2003, advance-
ments in caching, pipelining, and many other internal aspects of
the CPU made clock speed an inaccurate way to compare one
CPU to another. CPU makers give their processors model num-
bersnothing more than marketing namesto tell one proces-
sor from another. The Intel Core Duo T2300, for example,
actually runs 1.66 GHz (166 MHz external speed with a 10× multiplier). If
you want to know the speed of a particular processor, you must go to the
CPU maker’s Web site or other source.
CPU Voltages
In the simplest sense, a CPU is a collection of transistors, tiny electrical
switches that enable the CPU to handle the binary code that makes up pro-
grams. Transistors, like other electrical devices, require a set voltage to run
properly. Give a transistor too much and you fry it, too little and it doesn’t
work. For the first ten years of the personal computer, CPUs ran on 5 volts of
electricity, just like every other circuit on the motherboard. To increase the
complexity and capability with new generations of CPUs, microprocessor
developers simply increased the number of transistors. But eventually they
altered this strategy to increase the efficiency of the CPUs and keep the size
down to something reasonable.
Intel and AMD discovered that by reducing the amount of voltage used,
they could reduce the size of the transistors and cram more of them into the
same space. Intel released the Pentium, for example, that required only
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs

Clock multiplying first sur-
faced during the reign of the
Intel 80486 CPUs. The first clock
multipliers exactly doubled the
clock speed, resulting in the
term clock doubling. This term is
used interchangeably with clock
multiplying, even though mod-
ern CPUs multiply far more than
just times two.

3.3 volts. AMD responded with its versions of the Pentium-class CPUs with
even lower voltages.
Motherboard manufacturers had to scramble to adapt to the changing
CPU landscape by creating motherboards that could handle multiple volt-
ages of CPUs. All of the logic circuits still ran at 5 volts, so manufacturers
started installing a voltage regulator module (VRM) that damped down volt-
ages specifically for the CPUs.
Because the new and improved motherboards han-
dled many CPU voltages, initially techs had to install a
VRM specific to the CPU. As manufacturers got better at
the game and built VRMs into the motherboards, techs
just had to change jumpers or flip switches rather than
install a VRM (Figure 5.33).
Getting the voltage right on today’s CPUs is no lon-
ger a concern. Just as for clock speed and multipliers, to-
day’s CPUs tell the motherboard the voltage they need
automatically. The integrated VRMs take care of the rest
(Figure 5.34).
The feature set of the early Pentium CPUs beats at the heart of every sub-
sequent processor. Newer processors have a 64-bit data bus, 32-bit or larger
address bus, 32-bit or larger registers, multiple pipelines, and two or three
levels of cache. All run at some multiple of the system clock. So, now that
you have the scoop on the Pentium, you’re ready to check out subsequent
CPU models.
Original Pentium
The Pentium is not a new chip; it’s been around since 1990, and the
last versions of the Pentium chip were discontinued in 1995. The
original Pentium was the springboard for the Pentium Pro, proba-
bly the most important CPU ever made, and thus it makes sense to
start there. The rest of this chapter looks at all of the popular CPUs
developed since the Pentium and describes how they’ve built on
this legacy CPU (Figure 5.35).

An early Pentium

AMD made a competitor to the Pentium called the AMD K5. The AMD
K5 was pin-compatible with the Pentium, but to keep Intel from suing them,
AMD made the K5 very different on the inside, using a totally new (at least
for Intel) method of processing. The AMD K5 had some success but was
rather quickly upstaged by better AMD CPUs.
Pentium Pro
In 1995, Intel released the next generation of CPU, the Pentium Pro, often
called the P6. The Pentium Pro was a huge CPU with a distinctive, rectan-
gular PGA package (Figure 5.36). The P6 had the same bus and register
sizes as the Pentium, but three new items made the P6 more powerful than
its predecessor: quad pipelining, dynamic processing, and an on-chip L2
cache. These features carried on into every CPU version that followed, so
many people consider the Pentium Pro to be the true “Father of the
Modern CPU.”
Superscalar Execution
The P6 had four pipelines, twice as many as the Pentium. These pipelines
were deeper and faster. With this many pipelines, the P6 was guaranteed
to always, no matter what, run at least two instructions at the same time. The
ability to execute more than one instruction in any one clock cycle is called
superscalar execution.
Out-of-Order Processing/Speculative Execution
From time to time, a CPU must go to system memory to access code, no mat-
ter how good its cache. When a RAM access takes place, the CPU must wait
a few clock cycles before processing. Sometimes the wait can be 10 or 20
clock cycles. System memory is dynamic RAM and needs to be refreshed
(charged up) periodically, causing further delays. When the P6 was forced
into wait states, it took advantage of the wait to look at the code in the pipe-
line to see if it could run any commands while the wait states were active. If
it found commands it could process that were not dependent on the data be-
ing fetched from DRAM, it ran these commands out of order, a feature
called out-of-order processing. After the DRAM returned with the code, it re-
arranged the commands and continued processing.
The P6 improved on the Pentium’s branch prediction by adding a
far more complex counter that would predict branches with a better
than 90-percent success rate. With the combination of out-of-order
processing and the chance of a branch prediction so high, the CPU
could grab the predicted side of the branch out of the cache and run it
out of order in one pipeline, even before running the branch itself. This
was called speculative execution.
On-Chip L2 Cache
The P6 had both an L1 and an L2 cache on the CPU. Because the L2
cache was on the chip, it ran almost as fast as the L1 cache (Figure 5.37).
Be careful with the term “on-chip.” Just because the L2 cache was on
the chip, that doesn’t mean it was built into the CPU. The CPU and the
L2 cache shared the same package, but physically they were separate.
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
161
• Figure 5.36
Pentium Pro
• Figure 5.37

CPU and L2 cache (photo

The inclusion of the L2 cache on the chip
gave rise to some new terms to describe the
connections between the CPU, MCC, RAM,
and L2 cache. The address bus and external
data bus (connecting the CPU, MCC, and
RAM) were lumped into a single term called
the frontside bus, and the connection between
the CPU and the L2 cache became known as the
backside bus.
Figure 5.38 shows a more modern configu-
ration, labeling the important buses. Note that
the external data bus and address bus are
there, but the chipset provides separate ad-
dress buses and external data buses—one set just for the CPU and another
set for the rest of the devices in the PC. No official name has been given to
the interface between the RAM and the chipset. On the rare occasions when
they discuss it, most techs simply call it the RAM interface.
The Pentium Pro had a unique PGA case that fit into a special socket,
called Socket 8. No other CPU used this type of socket. The Pentium Pro
made strong inroads in the high-end server market, but its high cost made it
unacceptable for most people’s desktop computers.
Although the Pentium Pro never saw a large volume of sales compared
with the Pentium, many people in the industry consider it the most impor-
tant chip ever created by Intel. Its feature set was the prototype for all CPUs
designed ever since.
Later Pentium-Class CPUs
Intel’s usual game plan in the rough-and-tumble business of chip making is
to introduce a new CPU and simultaneously declare all previous CPUs ob-
solete. That did not happen with the Pentium Pro, however, because Intel
never really developed the P6 for most users. It was to be the CPU for pow-
erful, higher-end systems. This kept the Pentium as the CPU of choice for all
but the most power-hungry systems.
While the Pentium Pro languished on the high end for several years,
Intel and AMD developed new Pentium-class CPUs that incorporated a se-
ries of powerful improvements, some of which were taken from the
Pentium Pro. These improvements required that they be regarded as a new
family of CPUs, which I call the “later Pentium-class CPUs” (Figure 5.39).
Although certainly some profound differences exist between these CPUs,
they all have three groups of similar improvements: multimedia extensions
(MMX), increased multipliers/clocks, and improved processing.
Later-generation Pentiums were pin-compatible with earlier Pentiums,
but included a large number of improvements. The most important im-
provement was increases in multipliers, and therefore clock speeds, but
other improvements also took place—some borrowed from the P6 and some
developed just for this new breed of Pentium.
MMX
In 1996, Intel added a new enhancement to its Pentium CPU, called multime-
dia extensions (MMX), in response to the large number of programs with
162
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Later-generation Pentium

heavy graphics needs coming out at this time. MMX was designed to work
with large graphics by calculating on large chunks of data and performing
vector math (vector math is needed to handle graphical issues such as spin-
ning a 3D object). MMX was not heavily supported by the folks who wrote
graphics programs, but MMX did start the idea that CPUs should have spe-
cial circuitry just for such programs. Over time, the graphics community be-
gan to work with Intel to improve MMX, eventually replacing it with better
solutions.
Increased Clocks and Multipliers
Later Pentiums all have vastly increased multipliers, resulting in higher
speeds. Most early Pentiums used 2.5× multipliers at best, but later
Pentium-class processors had up to 4.5× multipliers.
Pentium II
Intel’s next major CPU was the Pentium II. Although highly
touted as the next generation of CPUs, the Pentium II was lit-
tle more than a faster Pentium Pro with MMX and a refined
instruction set. The Pentium II came in a distinctive single-
edge cartridge (SEC) that gave more space for the L2 cache and
made CPU cooling easier while freeing up more room on the
motherboard (Figure 5.40). Aggressive advertising and pric-
ing made the Pentium II extremely popular.
The Pentium II initially achieved the higher clock speeds
by using high multiples of a 66-MHz external speed. During
this time, however, AMD began to sell CPUs designed to run
on 100-MHz motherboards. Although the final Pentium II
models also ran on 100-MHz motherboards, Intel’s slow
adoption of 100-MHz external-speed CPUs lost market share
for Intel.
The SEC cartridge also created another problem: it was not free to copy.
This prevented other CPU manufacturers from making CPUs that fit in the
SEC’s special Slot 1 connection and forced AMD to create its own SEC pack-
ages that were incompatible with Intel’s. From the Pentium II to today,
AMD and Intel CPUs are no longer interchangeable. We live in a
world where AMD CPUs have motherboards designed for AMD,
while Intel CPUs must have motherboards designed for Intel.
AMD K6 Series
From 1997 to 2000, AMD produced a series of processors called the K6
that matched—and in many people’s view, surpassed—the Pentium
II, propelling AMD into serious competition with Intel (Figure 5.41).
Four models were included in the K6 series: the K6, K6-2, K6-2+, and
K6-III, each incorporating more advanced features than the previous
model. The K6 processors incorporated a number of improvements,
including a 64-KB L1 cache, extremely advanced pipelining, and sup-
port for motherboard speeds of up to 100 MHz (on later models). The
K6-2 added AMD’s proprietary 3DNow! instruction set—a direct

competitor to Intel’s MMX and a significant advancement in graphics-han-
dling capabilities—and increased clock speeds. The K6-III included even
more advancements in pipelining and added a 256-KB L2 cache, all on a
standard Socket 7 PGA package.
Pentium III
The Pentium III improved on the Pentium II by incorporating Streaming
SIMD Extensions (SSE), Intel’s direct competitor to AMD’s 3DNow!; a num-
ber of internal processing/pipelining improvements; full support for 100-
MHz and 133-MHz motherboard speeds; and a high-speed L2 cache. The
Pentium III was first produced by using an SEC package (Figure 5.42), but
improvements in die technology enabled Intel to produce PGA versions
later, ending the short reign of the SEC-package CPUs.
AMD Athlon
Athlon is the brand name for a series of CPUs released by AMD. A number
of different CPUs have been launched under this brand to compete head to
head against the latest Intel chips. The original Athlon, now referred to as
Athlon Classic, was the first AMD CPU to drop any attempt at pin compati-
bility with Intel chips. Instead, AMD decided to make its own AMD-only
slots and sockets. The first of these sockets used an SEC package and was
called Slot A (Figure 5.43).
AMD then shifted back to a PGA package with the release of an Athlon
CPU codenamed Thunderbird (Figure 5.44). This CPU, along with several
Athlon CPUs to come, used a proprietary 462-pin socket called Socket A.
Thunderbird (like its predecessor) had an interesting double-pumped
frontside bus that doubled the data rate without increasing the clock speed.
The Athlon Thunderbird CPUs have a smaller but far more powerful L2
cache, as well as a number of other minor improvements when compared to
the Athlon Classic.

Tech tip
CPU Codenames
Intel and AMD fight to bring out
new CPUs with an almost alarm-
ing frequency, making the job of
documenting all of these CPUs
challenging. Luckily for us, the
CPU makers use special CPU
codenames for new CPUs, such
as Bloomfield and Deneb to de-
scribe the first version of the Core
i7 and the Phenom II X4, respec-
tively. These codenames are in
common use, and a good tech
should recognize these names—
plus they make a dandy way to
learn about what’s taking place in
the CPU business.
• Figure 5.42
Intel Pentium III
• Figure 5.43
Early Athlon CPU

Next, AMD launched the Athlon XP, first under the codename Pal-
omino. AMD incorporated a number of performance enhancements to
the Athlon core, including support for Intel’s SSE instructions. AMD
released an update to Palomino, codenamed Thoroughbred, which
featured increased external bus speeds and was manufactured by us-
ing a 130-nm process that reduced the required CPU wattage. The last
32-bit CPUs to wear the Athlon badge were codenamed Barton and
Thorton. Barton featured double the L2 cache of Thoroughbred and
had an even faster external bus. Thorton was a cheaper version that
did not increase the size of the cache.
One interesting aspect of the Athlon XP was AMD’s attempt to ig-
nore clock speeds and instead market the CPUs by using a perfor-
mance rating (PR) number that matched the equivalent power of an
Intel Pentium 4 processor. For example, the Athlon XP 1800+ actually
ran at 1.6 GHz, but AMD claimed it processed as fast as or faster than a
Pentium 4 1.8 GHz—ergo “1800+.”
AMD Duron
Duron is the generic name given to lower-end CPUs based on
the Athlon processor. A Duron is basically an Athlon with a
smaller cache. Because the Duron supported the same
frontside bus as the Athlon, it had a slight performance edge
over its low-end rival from Intel at the time. The Duron con-
nected to the same 462-pin Socket A as the later Athlon CPUs
(Figure 5.45). AMD discontinued the Duron brand in 2004 and
replaced it with the Sempron brand, discussed later in this
chapter.
Intel Pentium 4
Although the Pentium II and III were little more than improvements on the
Intel Pentium Pro, the Pentium 4 introduced a completely redesigned core,
called NetBurst. NetBurst centered on a totally new 20-stage pipeline com-
bined with features to support this huge pipeline. Each stage of the pipeline
performed fewer operations than typical pipeline stages in earlier proces-
sors, allowing Intel to crank up the clock speed for the
Pentium 4 CPUs. The first Pentium 4s, codenamed
Willamette, included a new version of SSE called SSE2,
and later versions introduced SSE3.
The Pentium 4 featured a quad-pumped frontside bus
where the external data bus was sampled four times per
clock cycle. In the early going, there were two packages
for the Pentium 4 CPUs. The first Pentium 4 CPUs came
in a 423-pin PGA package. This was followed with a
478-pin PGA package (Figure 5.46). Even though the
new package has more pins, it is considerably smaller
than the earlier package.
Intel switched to the Land Grid Array (LGA) 775
package with the release of a Pentium 4 CPU code-
named Prescott (Figure 5.47). Again, even though the

LGA 775 package has more pins than a Socket 478 package, it is smaller.
With the Pentium 4 CPUs codenamed Northwood and Prescott, Intel un-
veiled an interesting advancement in superscalar architecture called
hyperthreading.
With hyperthreading, each individual pipeline can run more than one
thread at a timea tricky act to achieve. A single Intel P4 with
hyperthreading looks like two CPUs to the operating system. Figure 5.48
shows the Task Manager in Windows XP on a system running a
hyperthreaded Pentium 4. Note how the CPU box is broken into two
groupsWindows thinks this one CPU is two CPUs.

Tech Tip
Deciphering the
Numbers
Give it up. Intel must have some
scheme for their CPU numbering,
but it doesn’t match the processor
speed. They call a 2.66-GHz CPU
a 506, for example, which might
lead you to believe that the “6”
reflects the “66” in the speed. But
the 2.8-GHz CPU that followed
was named the 511. Go figure!
Here’s what Intel says on
www.intel.com/products/proces-
sor_number/: “Intel processor
numbers are based on a variety of
features that may include the pro-
cessor’s underlying architecture,
cache, Front Side Bus, clock
speed, power and other Intel tech-
nologies. A processor number
represents a broad set of features
that can influence overall com-
puting experience but is not a
measurement of performance.”
• Figure 5.48
Windows Task Manager with the Performance tab displayed for a system
running a hyperthreaded Pentium 4

Hyperthreading enhances a CPU’s efficiency but with a couple of limita-
tions. First, the operating system and the application have to be designed to
take advantage of the feature. Second, although the CPU simulates the ac-
tions of a second processor, it doesn’t double the processing power because
the main execution resources are not duplicated.
Starting with the LGA 775 Prescotts, Intel dumped the convention of
naming CPUs by their clock speed and adopted a cryptic three-digit model-
numbering system. All Prescott Pentium 4s received a three-digit number
starting with a 5 or a 6. One of the 2.8-GHz Pentium 4 CPUs is a 521, for ex-
ample, and one of the 3-GHz processors is called the 630.
A late version of the Pentium 4 CPU was released, called the Pentium 4
Extreme Edition. The Extreme Edition CPUs incorporated a large L3 cache
and other architectural details borrowed from Intel’s Xeon line of server
CPUs. The Pentium 4 Extreme Edition also had some of the highest wattages
ever recorded on any Intel desktop CPU—over 110 watts! Extreme Edition
CPUs ran incredibly fast, but their high price kept them from making any
significant impact on the market.
These Pentiums reached the apex of clock speeds, approaching 4 GHz.
After this, Intel (and AMD) stopped the CPU clock-speed race and instead
began to concentrate on parallel and 64-bit processing (both to be discussed
later in this chapter).
Mobile Processors
The inside of a laptop PC is a cramped, hot environment where no self-
respecting CPU should ever need to operate. Since the mid-1980s, CPU
manufacturers have endeavored to make specialized versions of their pro-
cessors to function in the rugged world of laptops. Over the years, a number
of CPU laptop solutions have appeared. Virtually every CPU made by Intel
or AMD has come in a mobile version. You can usually tell a mobile version
by the word “mobile” or the letter “M” in its name. Here are a few examples:
■
Mobile Intel Pentium III
■
Intel Pentium M
■
Mobile AMD Athlon 64
■
AMD Turion 64 (All Turions are mobile processors but don’t have
“mobile” or “M” in their name. AMD usually adds “mobile
technology” as part of the Turion description.)
■
Intel Core Duo (see the “Intel Core” section later in the chapter)
A mobile processor uses less power than an equivalent desktop model.
This provides two advantages. First, the battery in the laptop lasts longer.
Second, the CPU runs cooler, and the cooler the CPU, the fewer cooling de-
vices you need.
Almost every mobile processor today runs at a lower voltage than the
desktop version of the same CPU. As a result, most mobile CPUs also run at
lower speeds—it takes juice if you want the speed! Mobile CPUs usually top
out at about 75 percent of the speed of the same CPU’s desktop version.
Reducing voltage is a good first step, but making a smart CPU that can
use less power in low-demand situations reduces power usage even more.
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
167
Tech Tip
Centrino
Intel uses the marketing term
Centrino in the laptop market to
define complete mobile solutions,
including a mobile processor,
support chips, and wireless net-
working. There is no Centrino
CPU, only Centrino solutions
that include some type of Intel
mobile CPU.

The first manifestation of this was the classic System Management Mode
(SMM). Introduced back in the times of the Intel 80386 processor, SMM pro-
vided the CPU with the capability to turn off devices that use a lot of power,
such as the monitor or the hard drives. Although originally designed just for
laptops, SMM has been replaced with more advanced power-management
functions that are now built into all AMD and Intel CPUs.
CPU makers have taken power reduction one step further with
throttling—the capability of modern CPUs to slow themselves down during
low demand times or if the CPU detects that it is getting too hot. Intel’s ver-
sion of throttling is called SpeedStep, and AMD’s version is known as
PowerNow!.
Early 64-Bit CPUs
Both AMD and Intel now produce 64-bit CPUs. A 64-bit CPU has general-
purpose, floating point, and address registers that are 64 bits wide, meaning
they can handle 64-bit-wide code in one pass—twice as wide as a 32-bit pro-
cessor. And they can address much, much more memory.
With the 32-bit address bus of the Pentium and later CPUs, the maximum
amount of memory the CPU can address is 232 or 4,294,967,296 bytes. With a
64-bit address bus, CPUs can address 264 bytes of memory, or more precisely,
18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes of memory—that’s a lot of RAM! This num-
ber is so big that gigabytes and terabytes are no longer convenient, so we now
go to an exabyte (260). A 64-bit address bus can address 16 exabytes of RAM.
No 64-bit CPU uses an actual 64-bit address bus. Every 64-bit processor
gets its address bus clipped down to something reasonable. The Intel
Itanium, for example, only has a 44-bit address bus, for a maximum address
space of 244 or 17,592,186,044,416 bytes. AMD’s Phenom II, on the other
hand,

Initially, both AMD and Intel raced ahead with competing 64-bit proces-
sors. Interestingly, they took very different paths. Let’s look at the two CPUs
that made the first wave of 64-bit processing: the Intel Itanium and the AMD
Opteron.
Intel Itanium (Original and Itanium 2)
Intel made the first strike into the 64-bit world for PCs with
the Itanium CPU. The Itanium was more of a proof-of-con-
cept product than one that was going to make Intel any
money, but it paved the way for subsequent 64-bit proces-
sors. The Itanium had a unique 418-pin pin array cartridge
(PAC) to help house its 2- or 4-MB Level 3 cache (Figure 5.49).
The Intel Itanium 2 was Intel’s first serious foray into the
64-bit world. To describe the Itanium 2 in terms of bus sizes
and clock speeds is unfair. The power of this processor goes
far deeper. Massive pipelines, high-speed caching, and liter-
ally hundreds of other improvements make the Itanium 2 a
powerful CPU for high-end PCs. The Itanium 2 uses a unique
form of PGA that Intel calls organic land grid array (OLGA)
(Figure 5.50).

Intel made a bold move with the Itanium and the
Itanium 2 by not making them backward compatible to
32-bit programming. In other words, every OS, every
application, and every driver of every device has to be
rewritten to work on the Itanium and Itanium 2. In the-
ory, developers would create excellent new applications
and devices that dump all of the old stuff (and prob-
lems) and thus would be more efficient and streamlined.
If a company has a lot invested in 32-bit applications and
can’t make the jump to 64-bit, Intel continues to offer the
Pentium 4 or Pentium Xeon. If you need 64-bit, get an
Itanium 2. AMD didn’t agree with Intel and made 64-bit
processors that also ran 32-bit when needed. Intel would
eventually follow AMD in this decision.
AMD Opteron
Coming in after the Itanium, AMD’s Opteron doesn’t try
to take on the Itanium head to head. Instead, AMD pres-
ents the Opteron as the lower-end 64-bit CPU. But don’t
let the moniker “lower-end” fool you. Although the Opteron borrowed
heavily from the Athlon, it included an I/O data path known as
HyperTransport. Think of HyperTransport as a very high-speed link, pro-
viding direct connection to other parts of the PC—and to other CPUs for
multiprocessing—at a blistering speed of over 6 GB per second! The
Opteron comes in a micro-PGA package, looking remarkably like a Pentium 4
(Figure 5.51).
Unlike the Itanium, the Opteron runs both 32-bit and
64-bit code. AMD gives customers the choice to move
slowly into 64-bit without purchasing new equipment.
This was the crucial difference between AMD and Intel
in the early days of 64-bit processing.
Intel and AMD pitch the Itanium 2 and Opteron
CPUs at the server market. This means that as a
CompTIA A+ tech, you won’t see them unless you go to
work for a company that has massive computer needs.
Newer CPUs from both companies fight for the desktop
dollar.
Athlon 64
To place the Athlon 64 with the early generation CPUs is
hardly fair. The Athlon 64 was the first for-the-desktop
64-bit processor, so in that aspect it is an early 64-bit CPU
(Figure 5.52). AMD made two lines of Athlons: the “reg-
ular” Athlon 64 and the Athlon FX series. The FX series
runs faster than the regular Athlon 64s, uses more watt-
age, and is marketed to power users who are willing to
pay a premium. Underneath those two lines, AMD has
almost
20
sub-lines
of
Athlon
64s
in
different
codenames, making listing all of them here unwieldy.

The Athlon 64s have a number of enhancements beyond moving
into the 64-bit world. The most fascinating is the inclusion of a memory
controller into the CPU, eliminating the need for an external MCC and
for all intents also eliminating the idea of the frontside bus. The RAM
directly connects to the Athlon 64. Athlon 64s support Intel’s SSE and
SSE2 graphics extensions (later versions support SSE3).
While regular Athlon 64s use the same AMD PR numbers to de-
scribe CPUs, Athlon 64 FXs use a two-digit model number that’s just as
cryptic as Intel’s current three-digit numbers.
AMD Sempron CPUs
AMD produces various Sempron CPUs for the low end of the market.
Semprons come in two socket sizes and have less cache than the
Athlon 64, but they offer a reasonable trade-off between price and
performance.
Multicore CPUs
CPU clock speeds hit a practical limit of roughly 4 GHz around 2002–2003,
motivating the CPU makers to find new ways to get more processing power
for CPUs. Although Intel and AMD had different opinions about 64-bit
CPUs, both decided at virtually the same time to combine two CPUs into a
single chip, creating a dual-core architecture. Dual core isn’t just two CPUs
on the same chip. A dual-core CPU has two execution unitstwo sets of
pipelinesbut the two sets of pipelines share caches (how they share caches
differs between Intel and AMD) and RAM.
A multicore CPU can process more than one thread at a time; this is
called parallel processing. Through parallel processing, the CPU can more
readily juggle the demands of both applications and Windows, making the
overall computing experience better. With multithreaded applica-
tions (programs written to take advantage of multiple CPUs or CPUs
with multiple cores), this parallel processing can dramatically im-
prove the performance of those applications.
Pentium D
Intel won the race for first dual-core processor with the Pentium D
line of processors (Figure 5.53). The Pentium D is simply two late-
generation Pentium 4s molded onto the same chip, with each CPU
using its own cachealthough they do share the same frontside bus.
One very interesting aspect to the Pentium D is the licensing of
AMD’s AMD64 extensionsthe “smarts” inside AMD CPUs that
enable AMD CPUs to run either 64- or 32-bit code. Intel named their
version EM64T. There are two codenames for Pentium D processors:
the Smithfield (model numbers 8xx), using a 90-nm process, and the
Presler (model numbers 9xx), using a 65-nm process. Pentium Ds use
the same LGA 775 package seen on the later Pentium 4s.

tion cores onto a single chip is

Athlon Dual Cores
AMD’s introduction to dual core came with the Athlon 64 X2 CPUs. The X2s
are truly two separate cores that share L1 caches, unlike the Intel Pentium D.
Athlon 64 X2s initially came in both “regular” and FX versions packaged in
the well-known AMD Socket 939. To upgrade from a regular Athlon 64 to an
Athlon 64 X2, assuming you have a Socket 939 motherboard, is often as easy
as simply doing a minor motherboard update, called flashing the BIOS.
Chapter 7, “Learning Motherboards,” goes through this process in detail, or
you can simply check your motherboard manufacturer’s Web site for the in-
formation on the process. In 2006, AMD announced the Socket AM2, de-
signed to replace the Socket 939 across the Athlon line.
Intel Core
Intel introduced the Intel Core CPUs in 2006. Intel then followed up with the
Core 2 processors, the first generation of CPUs to use the Intel Core architec-
ture. Are you confused yet? Let’s look a little closer at the Core and Core 2
CPUs.
Intel Core
Intel based the first generation of core processors, simply called Core, on the
32-bit-only Pentium M platform. Like the Pentium M, Core processors don’t
use the NetBurst architecture, instead falling back to a more Pentium
Pro–style architecture (codenamed Yonah) with a 12-stage pipeline. Core
CPUs come in single- (Solo) and dual-core (Duo) versions, but they all use
the same 478-pin FCPGA package. Core also dispenses with the three-digit
Pentium numbering system, using instead a letter followed by four num-
bers, such as T2300.
Intel Core 2
With the Core 2 line of processors (Figure 5.54), Intel released a radically re-
vised processor architecture called Core. Redesigned to maximize effi-
ciency, the Core 2 processors offer up to 40 percent in energy savings at the
same performance level compared to the Pentium D processors. To achieve
the efficiency, Intel cranked up the cache size (to 2 or 4 MB) and went with a
wide, short pipeline. The CPU can perform multiple actions in a single clock
cycle and, in the process, run circles around the competition.
Intel released three Core 2 versions for the desktop: the Core 2 Solo, Core
2 Duo, and Core 2 Quad. Intel has also released an enthusiast version named
the Core 2 Extreme that comes in both Duo and Quad configurations. The
Core 2 line also includes mobile versions. All versions incorporate AMD’s
64-bit technology, rebranding it as Intel 64, so they can run 64-bit versions of
Windows natively.
AMD Phenom
To achieve a quad-core processor, AMD took a different approach than
Intel. Intel’s Core 2 Quad series of processors combine two dual-core proces-
sors, each with their own caches, on the same physical die. These two on-die
chips share a frontside bus to communicate with each other and memory.
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
171
• Figure 5.54
Intel Core 2 CPU
Intel’s naming conventions
can leave a lot to be desired.
Note that the Core Solo and Core
Duo processors were based on
the Pentium M architecture. The
Core 2 processors are based on
the Core architecture.

For AMD’s first quad-core desktop processor, called the Phenom, AMD
decided to have each CPU core possess its own L1 and L2 caches but have all
four cores share an L3 cache to facilitate communication between cores. This
is why AMD refers to the Phenom as a native quad-core processor. The
Phenom series of processors are all 64-bit CPUs that feature the AMD64
technology also found in the Athlon 64 CPUs.
The Phenom series processors have an integrated memory controller
that supports two channels of DDR2 memory. With the inclusion of an inte-
grated memory controller, the Phenom processors do not possess a tradi-
tional frontside bus. Instead, they use the same HyperTransport bus that the
Athlon 64/Opteron series of processors have. Phenom processors are sup-
ported by AMD’s Socket AM2+ or Socket AM3. The CPU may also use
Socket AM2, but this may incur a performance penalty.
AMD refers to a Phenom processor with four cores as a Phenom X4. A
Phenom X3 also exists and, as the name suggests, it possesses only three
cores. In reality, the Phenom X3 is a quad-core processor with one of the
cores shut off due to a defect. As such, AMD sells the Phenom X3 processors
at a discount compared to the Phenom X4.
Similar to Intel’s Extreme Edition CPUs for enthusiasts, AMD offers ver-
sions of the Phenom dubbed Black Edition. Not only are the Black Edition
CPUs in the higher-end of their CPU range, but they also feature an un-
locked clock multiplier allowing for fine-tuned overclocking.
AMD Phenom II
The Phenom II is a revision of the Phenom with a few improvements
(Figure 5.55). It includes triple the amount of L3 cache as the original
Phenom, support for Intel’s SSE4a instructions, increased HyperTransport
bus speeds, and an enhanced memory controller that can support two
channels of DDR2 or DDR3 memory.
The Phenom II is built using a 45-nm process instead of the 65-nm
process used with the original Phenom. The Phenom II is supported by
Socket AM3 and AM2+; however, the CPU only supports DDR3 mem-
ory when using Socket AM3.
Like the Phenom before it, the Phenom II is available in both an X4
quad-core version and an X3 triple-core version. But unlike the Phenom,
the Phenom II is also available in an X2 dual-core version. Enthusiast
Black Editions of all Phenom II configurations are also available.
Intel Core i7
Intel’s Core i7 family of processors is based off of a new microarchitecture
called Nehalem, which succeeds Intel’s Core microarchitecture. Like
AMD’s Phenom series of processors, the Core i7 is a native quad-core pro-
cessor and all four cores share an L3 cache. This processor is Intel’s first to
feature an integrated memory controller. The memory controller supports
up to three channels of DDR3 memory.
The Core i7 also marks the return of hyperthreading to Intel’s CPUs
(Figure 5.56). With hyperthreading, each individual core can support two
simultaneous threads, which, in aggregate, allows a single Core i7 to sup-
port up to eight simultaneous threads.
172
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 5.55
AMD Phenom II

The processor features a large 8-MB L3 cache and was first manufac-
tured using a 45-nm process. Intel designed a new 1366-pin socket for the
Core i7 family of processors, called LGA 1366. Like the Core 2 Quad be-
fore it, the Core i7 is a 64-bit CPU conforming to the Intel-64 standard,
meaning that it can also run 32-bit code.
With Nehalem, Intel has done away with the traditional frontside bus
and replaced it with a technology they named QuickPath Interconnect
(QPI). QPI is very similar to the HyperTransport bus found on the
Opteron and Phenom series of processors.
Intel Celeron
Intel uses the brand Celeron for its entire family of lower-end CPUs.
There are Celerons based on the Pentium II, Pentium III, Pentium 4,
Pentium-M, Core, and Core 2 Duo. The first Celerons were SEC but
lacked the protective covering of the Pentium II. Intel calls this the single-
edge processor (SEP) package (Figure 5.57). The
Pentium III–based Celerons were PGA and used
Socket 370 (Figure 5.58).
Celeron processors based on the Pentium 4 ap-
peared first using Socket 478, but LGA 775 versions
were eventually released. Over time, these Pentium
4–based Celerons borrowed more and more ad-
vanced features from their desktop counterparts,
including support for SSE3 extensions and Intel-64
addressing.
Processors designed to rival AMD’s Sempron
series chips were also released under the Celeron
brand. At first, these chips were based on Intel’s
Yonah architecture, but Intel released Celerons
based on the Core microarchitecture shortly there-
after. Many processors from the latest generation of
Celerons are available in dual-core models.
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
173

Intel Core i7
• Figure 5.57
Pentium II Celeron
• Figure 5.58
Intel Celeron

An entire line of Celerons for mobile computers also exists. Traditionally
these chips went by the names Mobile Celeron or Celeron-M. However,
Intel dropped that nomenclature with the latest mobile releases, simply re-
ferring to them as Celeron.
Intel Pentium Dual-Core
Intel resurrected the Pentium brand in 2006 with the release of the Pentium
Dual-Core. Although similar in name, the Pentium Dual-Core is not the
same processor as the Pentium D. The Pentium Dual-Core was originally a
32-bit processor based off the Yonah core, but Intel quickly followed that
processor up with a 64-bit Pentium Dual-Core based off of the Core
microarchitecture.
The Pentium Dual-Core line contains both mobile and desktop proces-
sors, and recently, just as with the Celeron brand, Intel has started referring
to them simply as Pentium. These Pentiums constitute a middle-of-the-road
series of processors for Intel, more powerful than the Celeron line but less
powerful than the Core 2 line.
Intel Xeon Processors
Just as the term Celeron describes a series of lower-end processors, the
term Xeon (pronounced “Zee-on”) defines a series of high-end proces-
sors Intel built around the P6, NetBurst, Core, and Nehalem
microarchitectures. Both the Pentium II Xeon and the Pentium III Xeon
used a unique SEC package that snapped into a Xeon-only slot called
Slot 2 (Figure 5.59). With the release of the Xeon based off of the
Pentium 4, however, Intel moved to PGA packaging, such as the Xeon-
only 603-pin package depicted in Figure 5.60.
Xeon processors add large L2 caches and, especially with more re-
cent Xeons, L3 caches as well. Although a few Xeon processors can only
work alone, most are carefully designed to work together in sets of two,
four, or more. Today’s Xeon processors themselves can contain two,
four, and even eight CPU cores per package. Put those two elements to-
gether, and modern Xeon systems can contain 32 CPU cores, each with
hyperthreading, to support 64 simultaneous threads.
174

Intel and their partners are working on delivering configurations that
will allow for even more CPUs, facilitating even greater processing power.
Although expensive, the Xeon processors’ immense power lets them enjoy
broad popularity in the high-horsepower world of server systems.
The Art of Cooling
There was a time, long ago, when CPUs didn’t need any type of cooling de-
vice. You just snapped in the CPU and it worked. Well, those days are gone.
Long gone. If you’re installing a modern CPU, you will have to cool it. For-
tunately, you have choices.
■
OEM CPU coolers
OEM heat-sink and fan assemblies are included
with a retail-boxed CPU. OEM CPUs, on the other hand, don’t
normally come bundled with CPU coolers. Crazy, isn’t it? OEM CPU
coolers have one big advantage: you know absolutely they will work
with your CPU.
■
Specialized CPU coolers
Lots of companies sell third-party heat
sinks and fans for a variety of CPUs. These usually exceed the OEM
heat sinks in the amount of heat they dissipate. These CPU coolers
invariably come with eye-catching designs to look really cool inside
your system—some are even lighted (Figure 5.61).
CPU fans are designed to work with a
very limited number of CPUs. Some third-
party fans come with a bunch of extra bits of
hardware to work with more than one type of
CPU. A small amount of thermal compound,
more commonly called “heat dope” by the
folks who use it, is applied to the top of the
CPU and forms a seal between the CPU and
the heat sink to make sure there’s good heat
transfer. Some cooling kits come with a bit of
heat dope already on the heat sink itself.
Whether the thermal compound comes on
the heat sink or you have to buy a tube, you
must have thermal compound between the
CPU and the heat sink. No exceptions!
The last choice is the most impressive of
all: liquid cooling! That’s right, you can put a
little liquid-cooling system right inside your
PC case. Liquid cooling works by running
some
liquid—usually
water—through
a
metal block that sits on top of your CPU, ab-
sorbing heat. The liquid gets heated by the
block, runs out of the block and into some-
thing that cools the liquid, and is then pumped through the block again. Any
liquid-cooling system consists of three main parts:
■
A hollow metal block that sits on the CPU
■
A pump to move the liquid around
■
Some device to cool the liquid
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
175
• Figure 5.61
Cool retail heat sink

And of course, you need plenty of hosing to hook them all together.
Figure 5.62 shows a typical liquid-cooled CPU.
A number of companies sell these liquid-cooling systems. Although
they look impressive and certainly cool your CPU, unless you’re
overclocking or want a quiet system, a good fan will more than suffice.
Whether you have a silent or noisy cooling system for your CPU, always
remember to keep everything clean. Once a month or so, take a can of com-
pressed air and clean dust off the fan or radiator. You may also want to use a
small vacuum or a compressor to remove dust from your system. CPUs are
very susceptible to heat; a poorly working fan can create all sorts of prob-
lems, such as system lockups, spontaneous reboots, and more.

Chapter 5 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about microprocessors.
Identify the core components of a CPU
■
The central processing unit performs calculations
on binary numbers to make the magic of
computers work. The CPU interfaces with the
motherboard and other components through the
external data bus or frontside bus.
■
CPUs contain several areas of internal memory,
known as registers, in which data and addresses
are stored while processing. The commands a CPU
knows how to perform are dictated by its
instruction set.
■
A quartz crystal soldered to the motherboard and
known as the system crystal provides a constant
pulse known as the clock. The frequency of this
pulse, or clock speed, dictates the maximum speed
at which a processor can run, measured in
megahertz or gigahertz. The processor typically
runs at some multiple of this clock pulse, known as
the internal clock speed. You can set the internal
clock speed by adjusting the multiplier (which
multiplies the clock speed by some number) or by
configuring motherboard jumpers or making a
change to a CMOS setting, or it is set automatically
via CPU circuitry. Setting the clock speed higher to
force the CPU to run faster than its rating is known
as overclocking.
Describe the relationship of CPUs and memory
■
A computer uses random access memory to take
copies of programs from the hard drive and send
them, one line at a time, to the CPU quickly
enough to keep up with its demands. The CPU
accesses any one row of RAM as easily and as
quickly as any other row, which explains the
“random access” part of RAM. RAM is not only
randomly accessible but also fast. By storing
programs on RAM, the CPU can access and run
them very quickly. RAM also stores any data that
the CPU actively uses.
■
The CPU communicates with RAM on the
motherboard via the address bus. The number of
wires comprising the address bus dictates the
amount of memory the CPU can access.
Explain the varieties of modern CPUs
■
Most CPUs in modern PCs are manufactured by
Intel or AMD.
■
CPUs come in two main form factors: pin grid
array (PGA) and single-edge cartridge (SEC).
■
PGA CPUs connect to the motherboard by way of a
zero insertion force (ZIF) socket that allows the
CPU to be inserted with no force. ZIF sockets work
by way of a mechanical arm that locks the CPU in
place.
■
The original Intel Pentium was introduced in 1990
and discontinued in 1995. AMD’s competing CPU
was the AMD K5.
■
Pipelining enables a CPU to perform calculations
as an assembly line. No longer does one calculation
need to be completed before the next can begin.
Modern CPUs have multiple pipelines.
■
Modern CPUs contain small amounts of high-
speed SRAM called a cache. As CPUs advanced,
the capacities of the cache increased, as did the
number of cache areas. CPU caches are also known
as L1, L2, or L3 caches. Data and instructions are
stored in the cache while they await processing.
This increases performance, because the CPU can
access data in the cache more rapidly than data in
motherboard RAM.
■
In 1995 Intel released the Pentium Pro. It improved
on the original Pentium by offering quad
pipelining, dynamic processing, and on-chip L2
cache. With four pipelines, it was guaranteed to
run at least two processes at the same time. The
capability to run more than one process in a single
clock cycle is called superscalar execution. The
Pentium Pro’s advanced branch prediction allowed
it to run processes out of order to increase
performance in a procedure called speculative
execution.
Chapter 5: Learning CPUs
177

■
In 1996 Intel released the Pentium II. It improved on
the Pentium Pro by offering multimedia extensions
(MMX) and a refined instruction set. The AMD K6
(and its varieties) was the main competitor.
■
The Intel Celeron is a low-end processor. The generic
name of Celeron, with no identifying letters or
numbers to indicate which version, made purchasing
one difficult unless you asked the right questions.
■
Intel’s Pentium III improved on the Pentium II by
offering Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). AMD
responded with the 3DNow! instruction set.
■
The AMD Athlon was the first AMD CPU to use
AMD-only slots and sockets. If you wanted an
AMD Athlon, you had to purchase a motherboard
with the special AMD slot/socket.
■
The AMD Duron is similar to the Intel Celeron in
that it was marketed toward the low-end PCs. The
Duron is similar to the Athlon but contains a
smaller cache.
■
The Intel Pentium 4 came in several varieties
identified by codenames Willamette, Northwood,
and Prescott.
■
The Athlon XP came in several varieties: Palomino,
Thoroughbred, Thorton, and Barton.
■
The Intel Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was the first
non-server CPU to offer an L3 cache.
■
Mobile processors, or CPUs for laptops, are usually
identified by the word “mobile” or the letter “M” in
their names. A mobile processor uses less power
than a desktop CPU, allowing for longer battery life
and cooler running. A mobile processor runs on a
lower voltage than a desktop CPU, which usually
translates to lower speeds. The term Centrino
defines a complete mobile solution consisting of a
mobile processor, support chips, and wireless
networking. There is no Centrino CPU.
■
Intel’s SpeedStep and AMD’s PowerNow!
technologies enable CPUs to slow themselves
down during times of low demand or if the CPU
senses it is getting too hot. Generically, this is
called throttling.
■
The Intel Xeon is a high-end processor aimed at the
server or power-user market. Xeons are intended
to be used in PCs with multiple processors.
■
The original Intel Itanium was Intel’s first 64-bit
processor. The Itanium and the follow-up Itanium 2
were not backward compatible with 32-bit systems,
so users had to use a 64-bit operating system, 64-bit
software, and 64-bit drivers.
■
The AMD Opteron, AMD’s first 64-bit processor,
was backward compatible with 32-bit systems.
■
The AMD Athlon 64 comes in two varieties,
Athlon 64 and Athlon 64 FX, with the FX being
faster and more expensive. The AMD Sempron
is AMD’s low-end 64-bit processor.
■
Dual-core CPUs combine two CPUs into a single
chip. The two CPUs have different sets of pipelines
but share common caches. The Intel Pentium D
(codenames Smithfield and Presler) is one such
processor that can run both 32- and 64-bit code.
AMD’s Athlon 64 X2 CPUs are dual-core.
■
The AMD Phenom X4, Phenom II X4, and Intel
Core i7 are all native quad-core CPUs.
■
The AMD Phenom X3 is a native triple-core CPU.

henever people come up to me and start professing their computer
savvy, I ask them a few questions to see how much they really know. In
case you and I ever meet and you decide you want to “talk tech” with me, I’ll
tell you my first two questions just so you’ll be ready. Both involve random
access memory (RAM), the working memory for the CPU.
1.
“How much RAM is in your computer?”
2.
“What is RAM and why is it so important that every PC has some?”
Can you answer either of these questions? Don’t fret if you can’t—you’ll
know how to answer both of them before you finish this chapter. Let’s start by
reviewing what you know about RAM thus far.

When not in use, programs and data are held in mass storage, which
usually means a hard drive but could also mean a USB thumb drive, a CD-
ROM, or some other device that can hold data when the computer is turned
off. When you load a program by clicking an icon in Windows, the program
is copied from the mass storage device to RAM and then run (Figure 6.1).
You saw in Chapter 5, “Learning
CPUs,” that the CPU uses dynamic ran-
dom access memory (DRAM) as RAM
for all PCs. Just like CPUs, DRAM has
gone through a number of evolutionary
changes over the years, resulting in im-
proved
DRAM
technologies
with
names such as SDRAM, RDRAM, and
DDR RAM. This chapter starts by ex-
plaining how DRAM works, and then
moves into the types of DRAM used
over the past few years to see how they
improve on the original DRAM.
■Understanding DRAM
As discussed in Chapter 5, “Learning CPUs,” DRAM functions like an elec-
tronic spreadsheet, with numbered rows containing cells and each cell hold-
ing a one or a zero. Now let’s look at what’s physically happening. Each
spreadsheet cell is a special type of semiconductor that can hold a single
bit—one or zero—by using microscopic capacitors and transistors. DRAM
makers put these semiconductors into chips that can hold a certain number
of bits. The bits inside the chips are organized in a rectangular fashion, using
rows and columns.
Each chip has a limit on the number of lines of code it can contain. Think
of each line of code as one of the rows on the electronic spreadsheet; one chip
might be able to store a million rows of code while another chip can store
over a billion lines. Each chip also has a limit on the width of the lines of code
it can handle, so one chip might handle 8-bit-wide data while another might
handle 16-bit-wide data. Techs describe chips by bits rather than bytes, so ×8
(pronounced “by eight”) and ×16 (“by sixteen”), respectively. Just as you
could describe a spreadsheet by the number of rows and columns—John’s
accounting spreadsheet is huge, 48 rows × 12 columns—memory makers
describe RAM chips the same way. An individual DRAM chip that holds
1,048,576 rows and 8 columns, for example, would be a 1 M × 8 chip, with
“M” as shorthand for “mega,” just like in megabytes (220 bytes). It is difficult
Chapter 6: Learning RAM
183
The CompTIA A+ certification
domains use the term memory
to describe the short-term stor-
age used by the PC to load the
operating system and running
applications. The more common
term in the industry is RAM, for
random access memory, the
kind of short-term memory
you’ll find in every computer.
More specifically, the primary
system RAM is dynamic random
access memory (DRAM). For the
most part, this book uses the
terms RAM and DRAM.
Cross Check
Dynamic and Random Access
You encountered DRAM back in Chapter 5, “Learning CPUs,” so see if
you can answer these questions: What makes DRAM dynamic? What
does random access mean?
• Figure 6.1
Mass storage holds programs, but programs need to run in RAM.

if not impossible to tell the size of a DRAM chip just by
looking at it—only the DRAM makers know the mean-
ing of the tiny numbers on the chips (Figure 6.2), al-
though sometimes you can make a good guess.
Organizing DRAM
Because of its low cost, high speed, and capability to
contain a lot of data in a relatively small package,
DRAM has been the standard RAM used in all com-
puters—not just PCs—since the mid-1970s. DRAM can
be found in just about everything, from automobiles to
automatic bread makers.
The PC has very specific requirements for DRAM. The original 8088
processor had an 8-bit frontside bus. All the commands given to an 8088
processor were in discrete 8-bit
chunks. You needed RAM that
could store data in 8-bit (1-byte)
chunks, so that each time the CPU
asked for a line of code, the mem-
ory controller could put an 8-bit
chunk on the data bus. This opti-
mized the flow of data into (and
out from) the CPU.
Although today’s DRAM chips may have widths greater than 1 bit,
back in the old days all DRAM chips were 1 bit wide. That means you only
had such sizes as 64 K × 1 or 256 K ×
1—always 1 bit wide. So how was 1-
bit-wide DRAM turned into 8-bit-
wide memory? The answer was
quite simple: Just take eight 1-bit-
wide chips and electronically orga-
nize them with the memory control-
ler chip to be eight wide. First, put
eight 1-bit-wide chips in a row on
the motherboard and then wire up
this row of DRAM chips to the mem-
ory controller chip (which has to be
designed to handle this) to make
byte-wide memory (Figure 6.3). You
just made eight 1-bit-wide DRAM
chips look like a single 8-bit-wide
DRAM chip to the CPU.
Practical DRAM
Okay, before you learn more about DRAM, I need to make a critical point
extremely clear. When you first saw the 8088’s machine language in Chapter
5, “Learning CPUs,” all the examples in the “codebook” were exactly 1-byte
commands. Figure 6.4 shows the codebook again—see how all the com-
mands are 1 byte?

What do these numbers mean?
Cross Check
Riding the 8088 Bus
You first saw the Intel 8088 CPU in Chapter 5, “Learning CPUs,” and
now it pops up again. What components inside the 8088 handle the data
once the CPU gets it from RAM? How does the CPU know when the
data is complete and ready to take?
• Figure 6.3
The MCC accessing data on RAM soldered onto the motherboard

Well, the reality is slightly different. Most of the
8088 machine language commands are 1 byte, but a
few more complex commands need 2 bytes. For ex-
ample, the following command tells the CPU to
move 163 bytes “up the RAM spreadsheet” and run
whatever command is there. Cool, eh?
1110100110100011
The problem here is that the command is 2 bytes
wide, not 1 byte. So how did the 8088 handle this?
Simple—it just took the command 1 byte at a time. It
took twice as long to handle the command because
the MCC had to go to RAM twice, but it worked.
Okay, so if some of the commands are more than
1 byte wide, why didn’t Intel make the 8088 with a
16-bit frontside bus? Wouldn’t that have been
better? Well, Intel did. Intel invented a CPU called
the 8086. The 8086 actually predates the 8088 and
was absolutely identical to the 8088 except for one
small detail: it had a 16-bit frontside bus. IBM could
have used the 8086 instead of the 8088 and used 2-
byte-wide RAM instead of 1-byte-wide RAM. Of
course, they would have needed to invent a memory
controller chip (MCC) that handled that kind of
RAM (Figure 6.5).
Why didn’t Intel sell IBM the 8086 instead of the
8088? There were two reasons. First, nobody had
invented an affordable MCC or RAM that handled
2 bytes at a time. Sure, chips were invented, but they were expensive and IBM
didn’t think anyone would want to pay $12,000 for a personal computer. So
IBM bought the Intel 8088, not the Intel 8086, and all our RAM came in bytes.
But as you might imagine, it didn’t stay that way too long.

DRAM Sticks
As CPU data bus sizes increased, so too did the need for RAM wide enough
to fill the bus. The Intel 80386 CPU, for example, had a 32-bit data bus and
thus the need for 32-bit-wide DRAM. Imagine having to line up 32 one-bit-
wide DRAM chips on a motherboard. Talk about a waste of space! Figure 6.6
shows motherboard RAM run amuck.
DRAM manufacturers responded by
creating wider DRAM chips, such as ×4, ×8,
and ×16, and putting multiples of them on a
small circuit board called a stick or module.
Figure 6.7 shows an early stick, called a sin-
gle inline memory module (SIMM), with eight
DRAM chips. To add RAM to a modern ma-
chine means you need to get the right stick
or sticks for the particular motherboard.
Your motherboard manual tells you pre-
cisely what sort of module you need and
how much RAM you can install.
Modern CPUs are a lot smarter than the
old Intel 8088. Their machine languages
have some commands that are up to 64 bits
(8 bytes) wide. They also have at least a 64-
bit frontside bus that can handle more than
just 8 bits. They don’t want RAM to give
them a puny 8 bits at a time! To optimize the
flow of data into and out of the CPU, the
modern MCC provides at least 64 bits of
data every time the CPU requests informa-
tion from RAM.
Modern DRAM sticks come in 32-bit-
and 64-bit-wide form factors with a varying
number of chips. Many techs describe these memory modules by their
width, so ×32 and ×64. Note that this number does not describe the width of
the individual DRAM chips on the module. When you read or hear about by
whatever memory, simply note that you need to know whether that person is
talking about the DRAM width or the module width. When the CPU needs
certain bytes of data, it requests those bytes via the address bus. The CPU
does not know the physical location of the RAM that stores that data, nor the
physical makeup of the RAM—such as how many DRAM chips work

together to provide the 64-bit-wide memory rows. The MCC keeps track of
this and just gives the CPU whichever bytes it requests (Figure 6.8).

If modern DRAM modules come in sizes much wider than a byte, why do
people still use the word “byte” to describe how much DRAM they have?

Dealing with Old RAM
Often in the PC world, old technology and ways of doing things are
reimplemented with some newer technology. Learning how things
worked back in the ancient days can stand a tech in good stead. Perhaps
more importantly, many thousands of companies—including hospitals,
auto repair places, and more—use very old, proprietary applications
that keep track of medical records, inventory, and so on. If you’re called
to work on one of these ancient systems, you need to know how to work
with old parts, so Try This!
Obtain an old computer, such as a 386 or 486. Ask your uncle‚
cousin‚ or Great Aunt Edna if they have a PC collecting dust in a closet
that you can use. Failing that, go to a secondhand store or market and
buy one for a few dollars.
Open up the system and check out the RAM. Remove the RAM from
the motherboard and then replace it to familiarize yourself with the in-
ternals. You never know when some critical system will go down and
need repair immediately—and you’re the one to do it!

example, and Sally has two 256-MB sticks. Both systems have a total of
512 MB of system RAM. That’s what your clients care about, after all, be-
cause having enough RAM makes their systems snappy and stable; not
enough and the systems run poorly. As a tech, you need to know more, of
course, to pick the right RAM for many different types of computers.
■Types of RAM
Development of newer, wider, and faster CPUs and MCCs motivates DRAM
manufacturers to invent new DRAM technologies that deliver enough data at
a single pop to optimize the flow of data into and out of the CPU.
SDRAM
Most modern systems use some form of synchronous DRAM (SDRAM).
SDRAM is still DRAM, but it is synchronous—tied to the system clock, just
like the CPU and MCC, so the MCC knows when data is ready to be grabbed
from SDRAM. This results in little wasted time.
SDRAM made its debut in 1996 on a stick called a dual inline memory
module (DIMM). The early SDRAM DIMMs came in a wide variety of pin
sizes. The most common pin sizes found on desktops were the 168-pin
variety. Laptop DIMMs came in 68-pin, 144-pin (Figure 6.9), or 172-pin
micro-DIMM packages; and the 72-pin, 144-pin, or 200-pin small-outline
DIMM (SO-DIMM) form factors (Figure 6.10). With the exception of the
32-bit 72-pin SO-DIMM, all these DIMM varieties delivered 64-bit-wide
data to match the 64-bit data bus of every CPU since the Pentium.
To take advantage of SDRAM, you needed a PC designed to use
SDRAM. If you had a system with slots for 168-pin DIMMs, for example,
your system used SDRAM. A DIMM in any one of the DIMM slots could
fill the 64-bit bus, so each slot was called a bank. You could install one,
two, or more sticks and the system would work. Note that on laptops that
used the 72-pin SO-DIMM, you needed to install two sticks of RAM to
make a full bank, because each stick only provided half the bus width.
188
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Old RAM—really old RAM—
was called fast page mode
(FPM) RAM. This ancient RAM
used a totally different technol-
ogy that was not tied to the sys-
tem clock. If you ever hear of
FPM RAM, it’s going to be in a
system that’s over a decade old.
Be careful! CompTIA likes to use
older terms like this to throw
you off!

Technology, Inc.)
• Figure 6.10

SDRAM tied to the system clock, so its clock speed matched the
frontside bus. Five clock speeds were commonly used on the early SDRAM
systems: 66, 75, 83, 100, and 133 MHz. The RAM speed had to match or ex-
ceed the system speed or the computer would be unstable or wouldn’t work
at all. These speeds were prefixed with a “PC” in the front, based on a stan-
dard forwarded by Intel, so SDRAM speeds were PC66 through PC133. For
a Pentium III computer with a 100-MHz frontside bus, you needed to buy
SDRAM DIMMs rated to handle it, such as PC100 or PC133.
RDRAM
When Intel was developing the Pentium 4, they knew that regular SDRAM
just wasn’t going to be fast enough to handle the quad-pumped 400-MHz
frontside
bus.
Intel
announced
plans to replace SDRAM with a
very fast, new type of RAM devel-
oped
by
Rambus,
Inc.,
called
Rambus DRAM, or simply RDRAM
(Figure 6.11). Hailed by Intel as the
next great leap in DRAM technol-
ogy, RDRAM could handle speeds
up to 800 MHz, which gave Intel
plenty of room to improve the
Pentium 4.
RDRAM was greatly anticipated by the industry for years, but industry
support for RDRAM proved less than enthusiastic due to significant delays
in development and a price many times that of SDRAM. Despite this grudg-
ing support, almost all major PC makers sold systems that used
RDRAMfor a while. From a tech’s standpoint, RDRAM shares almost all
of the characteristics of SDRAM. A stick of RDRAM is called a RIMM. In this
case, however, the letters don’t actually stand for anything; they just rhyme:
SIMMs, DIMMs, and now RIMMs, get it?
RDRAM RIMMs came in two sizes: a 184-pin for desktops and a 160-pin
SO-RIMM for laptops. RIMMs were keyed differently from DIMMs to en-
sure that even though they are the same basic size, you couldn’t accidentally
install a RIMM in a DIMM slot or vice versa. RDRAM also had a speed rat-
ing: 600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, or 1066 MHz. RDRAM employed an in-
teresting dual-channel architecture. Each RIMM was 64 bits wide, but the
Rambus MCC alternated between two sticks to increase the speed of data re-
trieval. You were required to install RIMMs in pairs to use this dual-channel
architecture.

Cross Check
Double-Pumped and Quad-Pumped
You’ve seen double-pumped and quad-pumped frontside buses in
Chapter 5, “Learning CPUs,” so see if you can answer these questions.
What CPU—by codename—started the double-pumped bus bandwagon?
What socket did it use?
The 400-MHz frontside bus
speed wasn’t achieved by mak-
ing the system clock fasterit
was done by making CPUs and
MCCs capable of sending 64 bits
of data two or four times for ev-
ery clock cycle, effectively dou-
bling or quadrupling the system
bus speed.

RDRAM motherboards also re-
quired that all RIMM slots be popu-
lated. Unused pairs of slots needed
a passive device called a continuity
RIMM (CRIMM) installed in each
slot to enable the RDRAM system to
terminate
properly.
Figure
6.12
shows a CRIMM.
RDRAM offered dramatic possibilities for high-speed PCs but ran into
three roadblocks that Betamaxed it. First, the technology was owned wholly
by Rambus; if you wanted to make it, you had to pay the licensing fees they
charged. That led directly to the second problem, expense. RDRAM cost
substantially more than SDRAM. Third, Rambus and Intel made a com-
pletely closed deal for the technology. RDRAM worked only on Pentium 4
systems using Intel-made MCCs. AMD was out of luck. Clearly, the rest of
the industry had to look for another high-speed RAM solution.
DDR SDRAM
AMD and many major system and memory makers threw their support be-
hind double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM). DDR SDRAM basically copied
Rambus, doubling the throughput of SDRAM by making two processes for
every clock cycle. This synchronized (pardon the pun) nicely with the
Athlon and later AMD processors’ double-pumped frontside bus. DDR
SDRAM could not run as fast as RDRAM—although relatively low
frontside bus speeds made that a moot point—but cost only slightly more
than regular SDRAM.
DDR SDRAM for desktops comes in 184-pin DIMMs. These DIMMs match
168-pin DIMMs in physical size but not in pin compatibility (Figure 6.13). The
slots for the two types of RAM appear similar as well but have different guide
notches, so you can’t insert either type of RAM into the other’s slot. DDR
SDRAM for laptops comes in either 200-pin SO-DIMMs or 172-pin micro-
DIMMs (Figure 6.14).
DDR sticks use a rather interesting naming conventionactually
started by the Rambus folksbased on the number of bytes per second of
data throughput the RAM can handle. To determine the bytes per second,
take the MHz speed and multiply by 8 bytes (the width of all DDR SDRAM
sticks). So 400 MHz multiplied by 8 is 3200 megabytes per second. Put the
abbreviation “PC” in the front to make the new term: PC3200. Many techs
also use the naming convention used for the individual DDR chips; for

Tech Tip
RAM Slang
Most techs drop some or all of the
SDRAM part of DDR SDRAM
when engaged in normal
geekspeak. You’ll hear the mem-
ory referred to as DDR, DDR
RAM, and the weird hybrid,
DDRAM.

RAM makers use the term

SDRAM) for the original SDRAM
to differentiate it from DDR
SDRAM.

example, DDR400 refers to a 400-
MHz DDR SDRAM chip running
on a 200-MHz clock.
Even though the term DDRxxx
is really just for individual DDR
chips and the term PCxxxx is for
DDR sticks, this tradition of two
names for every speed of RAM is a
bit of a challenge because you’ll of-
ten hear both terms used inter-
changeably. Table 6.1 shows all the
speeds for DDRnot all of these
are commonly used.

registered DDR SDRAM? What does this tell you about the PCs avail-
able to you?

Following the lead of AMD, VIA, and other manufacturers, the PC in-
dustry adopted DDR SDRAM as the standard system RAM. In the summer
of 2003, Intel relented and stopped producing motherboards and memory
controllers that required RDRAM.
One thing is sure about PC technologies: any good idea that can be cop-
ied will be copied. One of Rambus’ best concepts was the dual-channel ar-
chitecture—using two sticks of RDRAM together to increase throughput.
Manufacturers have released motherboards with MCCs that support dual-
channel architecture using DDR SDRAM. Dual-channel DDR motherboards
use regular DDR sticks, although manufac-
turers often sell RAM in matched pairs,
branding them as dual-channel RAM.
Dual-channel DDR works like RDRAM
in that you must have two identical sticks of
DDR and they must snap into two paired
slots. Unlike RDRAM, dual-channel DDR
doesn’t have anything like CRIMMsyou
don’t need to put anything into unused slot
pairs. Dual-channel DDR technology is very
flexible but also has a few quirks that vary
with each system. Some motherboards have
three DDR SDRAM slots, but the dual-
channel DDR works only if you install DDR
SDRAM in two of the slots. Other boards
have four slots and you must install match-
ing pairs in the same colored slots to run in
dual-channel mode (Figure 6.15). If you
populate a third slot, the system uses the full
capacity of RAM installed but turns off the
dual-channel feature.
DDR2
The fastest versions of DDR RAM run at a blistering PC4800. That’s 4.8 giga-
bytes per second (GBps) of data throughput! You’d think that kind of speed
would satisfy most users, and to be honest, DRAM running at approxi-
mately 5 GBps really is plenty fastfor yesterday. However, the ongoing
speed increases ensure that even these speeds won’t be good enough in the
future. Knowing this, the RAM industry came out with DDR2, the successor
to DDR. DDR2 is DDR RAM with some improvements in its electrical char-
acteristics, enabling it to run even faster than DDR while using less power.
The big speed increase from DDR2 comes by clock-doubling the input/out-
put circuits on the chips. This does not speed up the core RAMthe part
that holds the databut speeding up the input/output and adding special
buffers (sort of like a cache) makes DDR2 run much faster than regular DDR.
DDR2 uses a 240-pin DIMM that’s not compatible with DDR (Figure 6.16).
Likewise, the DDR2 200-pin SO-DIMM is incompatible with the DDR SO-
DIMM. You’ll find motherboards running both single-channel and dual-
channel DDR2.

• Figure 6.15
A motherboard showing the four RAM slots. By populating the
same color slots with identical RAM, you can run in dual-
channel mode.
DDR2 RAM sticks will not fit
into DDR sockets, nor are they
electronically compatible.

Table 6.2 shows some of the common DDR2 speeds.
DDR3
DDR2 has been the standard for several years, but now there’s a new kid on
the block. DDR3 boasts higher speeds, more efficient architecture, and
around 30 percent lower power consumption than DDR2 RAM, making it a
compelling choice for system builders. Just like its predecessor, DDR3 uses a
240-pin DIMM, albeit one that is slotted differently to make it difficult for
users to install the wrong RAM in their system without using a hammer
(Figure 6.17). DDR3 SO-DIMMs for portable computers have 204 pins. Nei-
ther fits into a DDR2 socket.
DDR3 doubles the buffer of DDR2 from 4 bits to 8 bits, giving it a huge
boost in bandwidth over older RAM. Not only that, but some DDR3

modules also include a feature called XMP, or Extreme Memory Profile, that
enables power users to overclock their RAM easily, boosting their already
fast memory to speeds that would make Chuck Yeager nervous. DDR3
modules also use higher-density memory chips, which means we may
eventually see 16-GB DDR3 modules.
Some chipsets that support DDR3 also support a feature called triple-
channel memory, which works a lot like dual-channel before it, but with three
sticks of RAM instead of two. You’ll need three of the same type of memory
modules and a motherboard that supports it, but triple-channel memory
can greatly increase performance for those who can afford it.
In keeping with established tra-
dition, Table 6.3 provides a chart of
common DDR3 speeds. Note how
DDR3 I/O speeds are quadruple
the clock speeds, whereas DDR2 I/
O speeds are only double the clock.
This speed increase is due to the in-
creased buffer size, which enables
DDR3 to grab twice as much data
every clock cycle as DDR2 can.
■RAM Variations
Within each class of RAM, you’ll find variations in packaging, speed, qual-
ity, and the capability to handle data with more or fewer errors. Higher-end
systems often need higher-end RAM, so knowing these variations is of cru-
cial importance to techs.
Double-Sided DIMMs
Every type of RAM stick, starting with the old FPM SIMMs and continuing
through to 240-pin DDR3 SDRAM, comes in one of two types: single-sided or
double-sided RAM. As their name implies, single-sided sticks have chips on
only one side of the stick. Double-sided sticks have chips on both sides
(Figure 6.18). The vast majority of RAM sticks are single-sided, but plenty of
double-sided sticks are out there. Double-sided sticks are basically two
sticks of RAM soldered onto one board. There’s nothing wrong with dou-
ble-sided RAM other than the fact that some motherboards either can’t use
them or can only use them in certain ways—for example, only if you use a
single stick and it goes into a certain slot.
Latency
If you’ve shopped for RAM lately, you may have noticed terms such as
“CL2” or “low latency” as you tried to determine which RAM to purchase.
You might find two otherwise identical RAM sticks with a 20 percent price
difference and a salesperson pressuring you to buy the more expensive one
because it’s “faster” even though both sticks say DDR 3200 (Figure 6.19).
RAM responds to electrical signals at varying rates. When the memory
controller starts to grab a line of memory, for example, a slight delay occurs;

cards. See Chapter 13, “Learning
Video and Multimedia,” for the
scoop on video-specific types of
memory.

think of it as the RAM getting off the couch. After the RAM sends out the re-
quested line of memory, there’s another slight delay before the memory
controller can ask for another line—the RAM sat back down. The delay in
RAM’s response time is called its latency. RAM with a lower latency—such
as CL2—is faster than RAM with a higher latency—such as CL3—because it
responds more quickly. The CL refers to clock cycle delays. The 2 means that
the memory delays two clock cycles before delivering the requested data;
the 3 means a three-cycle delay.
From a tech’s standpoint, you need to get the proper RAM for the system
you’re working on. If you put a high-latency stick in a motherboard set up
Chapter 6: Learning RAM
195
• Figure 6.19
Why is one more expensive than the other?
Tech Tip
Latency Is Relative
Latency numbers reflect how
many clicks of the system clock it
takes before the RAM responds. If
you speed up the system clock,
say from 166 MHz to 200 MHz,
the same stick of RAM might take
an extra click before it can re-
spond. When you take RAM out
of an older system and put it into
a newer one, you might get a
seemingly dead PC, even though
the RAM fits in the DIMM slot.
Many motherboards enable you
to adjust the RAM timings man-
ually. If so, try raising the la-
tency to give the slower RAM
time to respond. See Chapter 7,
“Learning Motherboards,” to
learn how to make these adjust-
ments (and how to recover if you
make a mistake).
CAS stands for column array
strobe, one of the wires (along
with the row array strobe) in the
RAM that helps the memory
controller find a particular bit of
memory. Each of these wires re-
quires electricity to charge up
before it can do its job. This is
one of the aspects of latency.
• Figure 6.18
Double-sided DDR SDRAM

for a low-latency stick, you’ll get an unstable or completely dead PC. Check
the motherboard manual and get the quickest RAM the motherboard can
handle, and you should be fine.
Parity and ECC
Given the high speeds and phenomenal amount of data moved by the typi-
cal DRAM chip, a RAM chip might occasionally give bad data to the mem-
ory controller. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the RAM has gone bad. It
could be a hiccup caused by some unknown event that makes a good DRAM
chip say a bit is a zero when it’s really a one. In most cases you won’t even
notice when such a rare event happens. In some environments, however,
even these rare events are intolerable. A bank server handling thousands of
online transactions per second, for example, can’t risk even the smallest er-
ror. These important computers need a more robust, fault-resistant RAM.
The first type of error-detecting RAM was known as parity RAM
(Figure 6.20). Parity RAM stored an extra bit of data (called the parity bit)
that the MCC used to verify whether the data was correct. Parity wasn’t per-
fectit wouldn’t always detect an error, and if the MCC did find an error, it
couldn’t correct the error. For years, parity was the only available way to tell
if the RAM made a mistake.
Today’s PCs that need to watch for RAM errors use a special type of
RAM called error correction code RAM (ECC RAM). ECC is a major advance
in error checking on DRAM. First, ECC detects any time a single bit is incor-
rect. Second, ECC fixes these errors on the fly. The checking and fixing come
at a price, however, as ECC RAM is always slower than non-ECC RAM.
ECC DRAM comes in every DIMM package type and can lead to some
odd-sounding numbers. You can find DDR2 or DDR3 RAM sticks, for ex-
ample, that come in 240-pin, 72-bit versions. Similarly, you’ll see 200-pin,
72-bit SO-DIMM format. The extra 8 bits beyond the 64-bit data stream are
for the ECC.
You might be tempted to say “Gee, maybe I want to try this ECC
RAM.” Well, don’t! To take advantage of ECC RAM, you need a mother-
board with an MCC designed to use ECC. Only expensive motherboards
for high-end systems use ECC. The special-use-only nature of ECC makes
it fairly rare. Plenty of techs out there with years of experience have never
even seen ECC RAM.
Buffered/Registered DRAM
Your average PC motherboard accepts no more than four sticks of DRAM,
because more than four physical slots for sticks gives motherboard
196
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Some memory manufactur-
ers call the technology Error
Checking and Correction (ECC).
Don’t be thrown off if you see
the phrase—it’s the same thing,
just a different marketing slant
for error correction code.
Tech Tip
Counting Chips
To determine if a DRAM stick is
parity or ECC, count the individ-
ual chips on the stick. If you have
an odd number of chips on the
stick, you have ECC or parity
DRAM.
• Figure 6.20
Ancient parity RAM stick

designers some serious electrical headaches. Yet some systems that use a lot
of RAM need the capability to use more DRAM sticks on the motherboard,
often six or eight. To get around the electrical hassles, special DRAM sticks
add a buffering chip to the stick that acts as an intermediary between the
DRAM and the MCC. These special DRAM sticks are called buffered or reg-
istered DRAM (Figure 6.21).
Like ECC, you must have a motherboard with an MCC designed to use
this type of DRAM. Rest assured that such a motherboard has a large num-
ber of RAM slots. Buffered/registered RAM is rare (maybe not quite as rare
as ECC RAM), and you’ll never see it in the typical desktop system.

Chapter 6 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises,
you should understand the following about RAM.
Identify the different types of DRAM packaging
■
The sticks of RAM snapped into your motherboard
are DRAM. Think of DRAM as a spreadsheet in
which each cell holds a one or a zero. Each cell
represents a single bit. The number of columns and
rows are finite.
■
If a chip contains 1,048,576 rows and 8 columns,
it can be described as a 1 M × 8 chip. A chip
containing 2,097,152 rows and 16 columns can
be described as a 2 M × 16 chip.
■
DRAM needs to be able to fill the data bus. A 1 M ×
8 DRAM chip is only 8 bits wide and would
provide the CPU with only 8 bits of data. You
would need eight of the 1 M × 8 chips to fill a 64-bit
data bus.
■
DRAM chips are soldered to a circuit board called
a stick or module, and when these chips are
combined, a single stick can fill the data bus.
Modern DRAM sticks come in 32-bit- and 64-bit-
wide varieties.
Explain the varieties of RAM
■
Synchronous dynamic random access memory, or
SDRAM, is tied to the system clock. The CPU,
memory controller, and RAM all work in tandem
with the clock pulse. This results in little wasted
time when the CPU requests data from RAM.
■
SDRAM comes in sticks called dual inline memory
modules (DIMMs). SDRAM DIMMs come in a
variety of pin sizes, with 168 pins being the most
common for desktop systems. DIMMs are 64 bits
wide so that they match the 64-bit data bus of
modern CPUs. DIMMs snap into slots on the
motherboard. Each DIMM is 64 bits, so snapping in
a single DIMM fills the data bus; therefore, each
slot is called a bank.
■
SDRAM is advertised by capacity and speed. The
speed is prefixed with “PC”; for example, PC66
runs at 66 MHz. A stick of SDRAM advertised as
256-MB PC133 has a capacity of 256 MB and runs
at 133 MHz. Five clock speeds are commonly used:
66, 75, 83, 100, and 133 MHz.
■
RAM speed must match or exceed that of the
system. For example, PC66 RAM can only be used
on a motherboard running at (or below) 66 MHz.
A motherboard with a frontside bus of 100 MHz
needs at least PC100 RAM.
■
Rambus DRAM (RDRAM) was created by Rambus,
Inc., and came in sticks called RIMMs. Due to cost,
licensing issues, and compatibility, RDRAM is now
obsolete.
■
RIMMs were 64 bits wide and came in speeds of
600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, and 1066 MHz.
Differences in the notches prevented you from
snapping a RIMM into a motherboard DIMM slot
or vice versa.
■
The RIMM memory controller uses a dual-channel
architecture: it alternates between two banks to
increase the speed of data retrieval. You need to
install RIMMs in pairs to accommodate this
feature.
■
All RIMM slots on the motherboard must be filled
with either a RIMM or a CRIMM. A CRIMM, or
continuity RIMM, is simply a stick with no
memory chips on it.
■
Double data rate SDRAM (DDR RAM) is faster
than regular SDRAM because it doubles the
throughput. Desktop PCs use 184-pin DDR
DIMMs, whereas laptops use either 200-pin or 172-
pin small-outline DIMMs (SO-DIMMs). DDR RAM
modules have notches that differ from both regular
SDRAM and RDRAM, so DDR RAM only snaps
into DDR slots on a motherboard.
■
DDR RAM is advertised one of two ways. One way
is with “DDR” followed by the speed; for example,
DDR400 for a stick of RAM runs at 400 MHz.
198
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Because DDR RAM runs at twice the clock speed,
DDR400 is meant for a 200-MHz frontside bus.
DDR RAM is also advertised by “PC” followed by
the throughput; for example, PC3200. The number
is determined by multiplying the speed by eight
(as all DDR sticks are 64 bits, or 8 bytes, wide).
Thus, DDR400 has a throughput of 3200 bytes per
second (400 MHz × 8 bytes). DDR400 and PC3200
are equivalent.
■
Dual-channel DDR improves upon DDR by using
the DIMMs in pairs, much like RDRAM. For
systems to use dual-channel DDR, the motherboard
and memory controller must support dual-channel
DDR RAM, and the DDR DIMMs must be identical.
Dual-channel DDR does not require dummy
modules such as CRIMMs. Dual-channel slots are
identified on a motherboard by their blue color.
Some motherboards offer a third slot in black, but
filling that third slot to increase your total system
RAM also turns off the dual-channel feature.
■
DDR2 is an improvement of DDR. DDR2 runs faster
than DDR and uses a 240-pin form factor that is not
compatible with DDR. You need a motherboard
with DDR2 slots to use DDR2 RAM. DDR2 is rated
by speed or throughput. Thus DDR2-400 is the same
as PC2-3200 and is meant for a 200-MHz frontside
bus.
■
DDR3 boasts higher speeds, more efficient
architecture, and around 30 percent lower power
consumption than DDR2 RAM. DDR3 doubles the
buffer of DDR2 from 4 bits to 8 bits, giving it a huge
boost in bandwidth over older RAM. Some chipsets
that support DDR3 also support triple-channel
memory, which works a lot like dual-channel but
with three sticks of RAM instead of two.
■
RAM modules are either single-sided or double-
sided. Single-sided sticks have chips on only one
side, whereas double-sided sticks have chips on
both sides. Most RAM is single-sided.
■
Latency refers to the time lag between when the
memory controller starts to fetch data from RAM
and when RAM actually sends out the requested
data. Another lag occurs when the memory
controller asks for the next line from RAM. The
shorter this lag time, the faster the system. CL2
indicates a shorter lag time, or lower latency, than
CL3, so CL2 is faster. Check your motherboard
documentation and get the lowest-latency RAM
your system will support.
■
Error correction code (ECC) RAM improved upon
parity RAM by being able to fix single-bit errors on
the fly. ECC RAM is always slower than non-ECC
RAM due to the overhead of the correcting code.
Only high-end motherboards and memory
controllers can use ECC RAM.
■
Buffered or registered RAM adds a buffering chip
to compensate for the electrical interference that
can result from using more than four DIMMs on a
single motherboard. The motherboard and memory
controller must be designed specifically to support
buffered or registered RAM. You are not likely to
see it in a typical desktop system.

I
n Chapter 5, “Learning CPUs,” you saw how the address bus and external
data bus connect RAM to the CPU via the memory controller chip (MCC) to
run programs and transfer data. Assuming you apply power in the right places,
you don’t need anything else to make a simple computer. The only problem
with such a simple computer is that it would bore you to death—there’s no way
to do anything with it! A PC needs devices such as keyboards and mice to
provide input, and output devices such as monitors and sound cards to
communicate the current state of the running programs to you. A computer also
needs permanent storage devices, such as hard drives and optical drives, to store
programs and data when you turn off the computer.

In this chapter, you will look at the process that your computer uses to
communicate with any hardware you install in it. You’ll then look at the ex-
pansion bus in detail, starting almost at the very beginning of the PC—not
because the history of the PC is inherently thrilling, but rather because the
way the old PCs worked affects the latest systems. Installation today re-
mains very similar to installation in 1987 in that you must have a physical
connection, communication, and drivers for the operating system. Taking
the time to learn the old ways first most definitely helps you understand and
implement current technology, terminology, and practices. Finally, you’ll
get a general overview of motherboards, which will help put all of the rest of
this chapter into a proper context.
■We Need to Talk
Simply placing a number of components into a com-
puter is useless if the CPU can’t communicate with
them. Getting the CPU to communicate with a de-
vice starts with some kind of interconnectiona
communication bus that enables the CPU to send
commands to and from devices. To make this con-
nection, let’s promote the MCC, giving it extra fire-
power to act as not only the interconnection between
the CPU and RAM, but also the interconnection be-
tween the CPU and the other devices on the PC. The
MCC isn’t just the memory controller anymore, so
let’s now call it the Northbridge because it acts as the
primary bridge between the CPU and the rest of the
computer (Figure 7.1).
Your PC is full of devices, so the PC industry de-
cided to delegate some of the interconnectivity work
to a second chip called the Southbridge. The Northbridge only deals with
high-speed interfaces such as the connection to your video card and RAM.
The Southbridge works mainly with lower-speed devices such as the USB
controller and hard drive controllers. Chip makers design matched sets of
particular models of Northbridge and Southbridge to work together. You
don’t buy a Northbridge from one company and a Southbridge from an-
otherthey’re sold as a set. We call this set of Northbridge and Southbridge
the chipset.
The chipset extends the data bus to every device on the PC. The CPU
uses the data bus to move data to and from all of the devices of the PC. Data
constantly flows on the external data bus among the CPU, chipset, RAM,
and other devices on the PC (Figure 7.2).
The first use for the address bus, as you know, is for the CPU to tell the
chipset to send or store data in memory and to tell the chipset which section
of memory to access or use. Just as with the external data bus, the chipset ex-
tends the address bus to all of the devices (Figure 7.3). That way the CPU can
use the address bus to send commands to devices, just as it sends commands
to the chipset. You’ll see this in action a lot more later in this chapter, but for
now just go with the concept.

• Figure 7.1
Meet the Northbridge
Chipset makers rarely use
the terms “Northbridge” and
“Southbridge” anymore, but
because most modern chipsets
consist of only two or three
chips with basically the same
functions, techs continue to use
the terms.

It’s not too hard to swallow the concept that the CPU uses the address
bus to talk to the devices, but how does it know what to say to them? How
does it know all of the patterns of ones and zeros to place on the address bus
to tell the hard drive it needs to send a file? Let’s look at the interaction be-
tween the keyboard and CPU for insight into this process.

Talking to the Keyboard
The keyboard provides a great example of how the buses and support pro-
gramming help the CPU get the job done. In early computers, the keyboard
connected to the external data bus via a special chip known as the keyboard
controller. Don’t bother looking for this chip on your motherboard—the
Southbridge now handles keyboard controller functions. The way the key-
board controller—or technically, the keyboard controller circuitry—works
with the CPU, however, has changed only a small amount in the past 20+
years, making it a perfect tool to illustrate how the CPU talks to a device.
The keyboard controller was one of the last single-function chips to be
absorbed into the chipset. For many years—in fact,
well into the Pentium III/Early Athlon era—most
motherboards had separate keyboard controller chips.
Figure 7.4 shows a typical keyboard controller from
those days. Electronically, it looked like Figure 7.5.
Every time you press a key on your keyboard, a
scanning chip in the keyboard notices which key you
pressed. Then the scanner sends a coded pattern of
ones and zeros—called the scan code—to the key-
board controller. Every key on your keyboard has a
unique scan code. The keyboard controller stores the
scan code in its own register. Does it surprise you that
the lowly keyboard controller has a register similar to
a CPU? Lots of chips have registers—not just CPUs
(Figure 7.6)!
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
205
Techs commonly talk about
various functions of the chipset as
if those functions were still han-
dled by discrete chips. So you’ll
hear about memory controllers,
keyboard controllers, mouse con-
trollers, USB controllers, and so
on, even though they’re all just
circuits on the Northbridge or
Southbridge chips.

Tech Tip
The 8042
Even though the model numbers
changed over the years, you’ll
still hear techs refer to the key-
board controller as the 8042, after
the original keyboard controller
chip.

How does the CPU get the scan code out of the keyboard controller
(Figure 7.7)? While we’re at it, how does the CPU tell the keyboard to change
the typematic buffer rate (when you hold down a key and the letter repeats)
or to turn the number lock LED on and off, to mention just a few other jobs
the keyboard needs to do for the system? The point is that the keyboard con-
troller must be able to respond to multiple commands, not just one.
206
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 7.6
Scan code stored in keyboard controller’s register
• Figure 7.7
The CPU ponders the age-old dilemma of how to get the 8042 to cough up its data.

The keyboard controller accepts commands exactly as you saw the CPU
accept commands in Chapter 5 “Learning CPUs.” Remember when you
added 2 to 3 with the 8088? You had to use specific commands from the
8088’s codebook to tell the CPU to do the addition and then place the answer
on the external data bus. The keyboard controller has its own codebook—
much simpler than any CPU’s codebook, but conceptually the same. If the
CPU wants to know what key was last pressed on the keyboard, the CPU
needs to know the command (or series of commands) that orders the key-
board controller to put the scan code of the letter on the external data bus so
the CPU can read it.
BIOS
The CPU can’t magically or otherwise automatically know how to talk with
any device; it needs some sort of support programming loaded into memory
that teaches it about a particular device. This programming is called basic in-
put/output services (BIOS). The programs dedicated to enabling the CPU to
communicate with devices are called services (or device drivers, as you’ll
see later in the chapter). This goes well beyond the keyboard, by the way. In
fact, every device on the computer needs BIOS! But let’s continue with the
keyboard for now.
Bringing BIOS to the PC
A talented programmer could write BIOS for a keyboard if the programmer
knew the keyboard’s codebook; keyboards are pretty simple devices. This
begs the question: where would this support programming be stored? Well,
programming could be incorporated into the operating system. Storing pro-
gramming to talk to the hardware of your PC in the operating system is
greatall operating systems have built-in code that knows how to talk to
your keyboard, your mouse, and just about every piece of hardware you
may put into your PC.
That’s fine once the operating system’s up and running, but what about
a brand new stack of parts you’re about to assemble into a new PC? When a
new system’s being built, it has no operating system. The CPU must have
access to BIOS for the most important hardware on your PC: not only the
keyboard, but also the monitor, hard drives, optical drives, USB ports, and
RAM. This code can’t be stored on a hard drive or CD-ROM disc—these im-
portant devices need to be ready at any time the CPU calls them, even before
installing a mass storage device or an operating system.
The perfect place to store the support programming is on the motherboard.
That settles one issue, but another looms: What storage medium should the
motherboard use? DRAM won’t work, because all of the data would be erased
every time the computer was turned off. You need some type of permanent
program storage device that does not depend on other peripherals to work.
And you need that storage device to sit on the motherboard.
ROM
Motherboards store the keyboard controller support programming, among
other programs, on a special type of device called a read-only memory
(ROM) chip. A ROM chip stores programs, called services, exactly like RAM:
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
207

that is, like an 8-bit-wide spreadsheet. But ROM dif-
fers from RAM in two important ways. First, ROM
chips are nonvolatile, meaning that the information
stored on ROM isn’t erased when the computer is
turned off. Second, traditional ROM chips are read-
only, meaning that once you store a program on one,
you can’t change it. Modern motherboards use a type
of ROM called flash ROM that differs from traditional
ROM in that you can update and change the contents
through a very specific process called “flashing the
ROM.” Figure 7.8 shows a typical flash ROM chip on
a motherboard. When the CPU wants to talk to the
keyboard controller, it goes to the flash ROM chip to
access the proper programming.
Every motherboard has a flash ROM, called the
system ROM chip because it contains code that en-
ables your CPU to talk to the basic hardware of your
PC (Figure 7.9). As alluded to earlier, the system
ROM holds BIOS for more than just the keyboard
controller. It also stores programs for communicating with the floppy
drives, hard drives, CD and DVD drives, video, USB ports, and other basic
devices on your motherboard.
To talk to all of that hardware requires hundreds of little services (2 to
30 lines of code each). These hundreds of little programs stored on the sys-
tem ROM chip on the motherboard are called, collectively, the system BIOS
(Figure 7.10). Techs call programs stored on ROM chips of any sort firmware.
The system ROM chips used on modern PCs store as much as 2 MB of
programs, although only 65,536 bytes are used to store the system BIOS.
208
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 7.8
Typical flash ROM
• Figure 7.9
Function of the flash ROM chip
Programs stored on ROM
chips—flash or any other kind of
ROM chip—are known collec-
tively as firmware, as opposed
to programs stored on erasable
media that are collectively called
software.

This allows for backward compatibility with earlier systems. The rest of the
ROM space is put to good use doing other jobs.
System BIOS Support
Every system BIOS has two types of hardware to support. First, the system
BIOS supports all of the hardware that never changes, such as the keyboard.
(You can change your keyboard, but you can’t change the keyboard control-
ler built into the Southbridge.) Another example of hardware that never
changes is the PC speaker (the tiny one that beeps at you, not the ones that
play music). The system ROM chip stores the BIOS for these and other de-
vices that never change.
Second, the system BIOS supports all of the hardware that might change
from time to time. This includes RAM (you can add RAM), hard drives (you
can replace your hard drive with a larger drive or add a second hard drive),
and floppy drives (you can add another floppy drive, although that’s not
common today). The system ROM chip stores the BIOS for these devices,
but the system needs another place to store information about the specific
details of a piece of hardware. This enables the system to differentiate be-
tween a Western Digital Caviar Black 1.5-TB hard drive and a Seagate Barra-
cuda 60-GB drive, and yet still support both drives right out of the box.
■CMOS
A separate memory chip, called the complementary metal-oxide semiconduc-
tor (CMOS) chip, stores the information that describes specific device pa-
rameters. CMOS does not store programs; it only stores data that is read by
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
209
• Figure 7.10
CPU running BIOS service

BIOS to complete the programs needed to talk to
changeable hardware. CMOS also acts as a clock to
keep the current date and time.
Years ago, CMOS was a separate chip on the
motherboard, as shown in Figure 7.11. Today, the
CMOS is almost always built into the Southbridge.
Most CMOS chips store around 64 KB of data, but
the PC usually needs only a very small amount—
about 128 bytes—to store all of the necessary informa-
tion on the changeable hardware. Don’t let the tiny
size fool you. The information stored in CMOS is ab-
solutely necessary for the PC to function!
If the data stored on CMOS about a particular
piece of hardware (or about its fancier features) is dif-
ferent from the specs of the actual hardware, the computer cannot access
that piece of hardware (or use its fancier features). It is crucial that this infor-
mation be correct. If you change any of the previously mentioned hardware,
you must update CMOS to reflect those changes. You need to know, there-
fore, how to change the data on CMOS.
Updating CMOS: The Setup Program
Every PC ships with a program built into the system ROM called the CMOS
setup program or the system setup utility that enables you to access and up-
date CMOS data. When you fire up your computer in the morning, the first
thing you likely see is the BIOS information. It might look like the example
in Figure 7.12 or perhaps something like Figure 7.13.
Who or what is AMIBIOS, and who or what is Phoenix Technologies?
These are brand names of BIOS companies. They write BIOS programs and
sell them to computer manufacturers. In today’s world, motherboard mak-
ers rarely write their own BIOS. Instead, they buy their BIOS from special-
ized third-party BIOS makers such as Award Software and Phoenix
Technologies. Although several companies write BIOS, two big companies
control 99 percent of the BIOS business: American Megatrends (AMI) and
210
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Old-style CMOS
The terms CMOS setup pro-
gram, CMOS, and system setup
utility are functionally inter-
changeable today. You’ll even
hear the program referred to as
the BIOS setup utility or CMOS
setup utility. Most techs just call
it the CMOS.
• Figure 7.12
AMI BIOS information

Phoenix Technologies. Phoenix bought Award Software a few years ago
and still sells the Award brand name as a separate product line. These three
are the most common brand names in the field.
You always access a system’s CMOS setup program at boot. The real
question is how to access the CMOS setup at boot for your particular PC.
AMI, Award, and Phoenix use different keys to access the CMOS setup pro-
gram. Usually, BIOS manufacturers tell you how to access the CMOS setup
right on the screen as your computer boots up. For example, at the bottom of
the screen in Figure 7.13, you are instructed to “Press DEL to enter SETUP.”
Keep in mind that this is only one possible example. Motherboard manufac-
turers can change the key combinations for entering CMOS setup. You can
even set up the computer so the message does not show—a smart idea if you
need to keep nosy people out of your CMOS setup! If you don’t see an “enter
setup” message, wait until the RAM count starts and then try one of the fol-
lowing keys or key combinations: DEL, ESC, F1, F2, CTRL-ALT-ESC, CTRL-ALT-
INS, CTRL-ALT-ENTER, or CTRL-S. It may take a few tries, but you will eventu-
ally find the right key or key combination. If not, check the motherboard
book or the manufacturer’s Web site for the information.
A Quick Tour Through a Typical CMOS
Setup Program
Every BIOS maker’s CMOS setup program looks a little different, but don’t
let that confuse you. They all contain basically the same settings; you just
have to be comfortable poking around. To avoid doing something foolish,
do not save anything unless you are sure you have it set correctly.
As an example, let’s say your machine has Award BIOS. You boot the
system and press DEL to enter CMOS setup. The screen in Figure 7.14 ap-
pears. You are now in the Main menu of the Award CMOS setup program.
The setup program itself is stored on the ROM chip, but it edits only the data
on the CMOS chip.

Tech Tip
Term Limits
Okay, I’ve thrown a whole bunch
of terms at you describing vari-
ous pieces of hardware and soft-
ware and what does what to
whom. Here’s the scorecard so
you can sort out the various
pieces of data.
1.
The system ROM chip stores
the system BIOS, programs
needed by the CPU to
communicate with devices.
2.
The system ROM chip also
holds the program that
accesses the information
stored on the CMOS chip to
support changeable pieces of
hardware. This program is
called the CMOS setup
program or the system setup
utility.
3.
The CMOS holds a small
amount of data that describes
the changeable pieces of
hardware supported by the
system BIOS. The CMOS
today is in the Southbridge
chip of the chipset.
Accessing the CMOS setup
utility for a system is perfectly
fine, but do not make changes
unless you fully understand that
system!

If you select the Standard CMOS Features option, the Standard CMOS
Features screen appears (Figure 7.15). On this screen you can change floppy
drive and hard drive settings, as well as the system’s date and time. You will
learn how to set up the CMOS for these devices in later chapters. At this
point, your only goal is to under-
stand CMOS and know how to ac-
cess the CMOS setup on your PC,
so don’t try to change anything yet.
If you have a system that you are al-
lowed to reboot, try accessing the
CMOS setup now. Does it look any-
thing like these examples? If not,
can you find the screen that enables
you to change the floppy and hard
drives? Trust me, every CMOS
setup has that screen somewhere!
Figure 7.16 shows the same stan-
dard CMOS setup screen on a sys-
tem with Phoenix BIOS. Note that
this CMOS setup utility calls this
screen “Main.”

Accessing CMOS Setup
The key or key combination required to access CMOS setup varies, de-
pending on your particular BIOS. It’s important to know how to access
CMOS setup, and how to find the BIOS information once you’re in, so
Try This!
1.
Boot your system and turn on your monitor. Watch the
information that scrolls by on the screen as your computer boots.
Most BIOS makers include a line indicating what key(s) to press
to access the CMOS setup program. Make a note of this useful
information! You can also check your motherboard book to
determine the process for accessing the CMOS setup program.
2.
Reboot the system, and this time watch for information on the
BIOS manufacturer. If you don’t see it, and if it’s okay to do so,
open the system case and check the name printed on the system
ROM chip. Make a note of this useful information.
3.
Reboot one more time, and this time use the key or key
combination you found to run the CMOS setup program. Locate
and make a note of the manufacturer, date, and version number
of your PC’s current BIOS.
4.
If you can, make a note of the exact model information for your
system and visit the Web site of the company that manufactured
your PC. Search their support files for the specs on your specific
system and see if you can locate your BIOS information. Now
take the detailed BIOS information and search the BIOS
manufacturer’s Web site for the same information.
• Figure 7.14
Typical CMOS main screen by Award

The first BIOS was nothing more
than this standard CMOS setup. To-
day, all computers have many extra
CMOS settings. They control items
such as memory management, pass-
word and booting options, diagnos-
tic and error handling, and power
management. The following section
takes a quick tour of an Award
CMOS setup program. Remember
that your CMOS setup almost cer-
tainly looks at least a little different
from mine, unless you happen to
have the same BIOS. The chances of
that happening are quite slim.
Phoenix has virtually cornered
the desktop PC BIOS market with its
Award Modular BIOS. Motherboard makers buy a boilerplate BIOS, de-
signed for a particular chipset, and add or remove options (Phoenix calls
them modules) based on the needs of each motherboard. This means that
seemingly identical CMOS setup utilities can be extremely different. Options
that show up on one computer might be missing from another. Compare the
older Award screen in Figure 7.17 with the more modern Award CMOS
screen in Figure 7.14. Figure 7.17 looks different—and it should—as this
much older system simply doesn’t need the extra options available on the
newer system.
The next section starts the walkthrough of a CMOS setup utility with the
SoftMenu, followed by some of the Advanced screens. Then you’ll go through
other common screens, such as Integrated Peripherals, Power, and more.
SoftMenu
You can use the SoftMenu to change the voltage and multiplier settings on
the motherboard for the CPU from the defaults. Motherboards that cater to

All of these screens tend to
overwhelm new techs. When
they first encounter the many op-
tions, some techs feel they need
to understand every option on
every screen to configure CMOS
properly. Relax—every new
motherboard comes with set-
tings that befuddle even the most
experienced techs. If I don’t talk
about a particular CMOS setting
somewhere in this book, it’s
probably not important, either to
the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam
or to a real tech.

overclockers tend to have this op-
tion. Usually you just set this to
Auto or Default and stay away from
this screen (Figure 7.18).
Advanced BIOS Features
Advanced BIOS Features is the
dumping ground for all of the set-
tings that aren’t covered in the Stan-
dard CMOS Setup menu and don’t
fit nicely under any other screen.
This screen varies wildly from one
system to the next. You most often
use this screen to select the boot op-
tions (Figure 7.19).

Chassis Intrusion Detection
Many motherboards support the chassis intru-
sion detection feature provided by the computer case, or chassis. Compati-
ble cases contain a switch that trips when someone opens the case. With
motherboard support and a proper connection between the motherboard
and the case, the CMOS logs whether the case has been opened and, if it has,
posts an appropriate alert to the screen on the subsequent boot. How cool
is that?
Advanced Chipset Features
The Advanced Chipset Features
screen strikes fear into most every-
one, because it deals with extremely
low-level chipset functions. Avoid
this screen unless a high-level tech
(such as a motherboard maker’s
support tech) explicitly tells you to
do something in here (Figure 7.20).
Integrated Peripherals
You will use the Integrated Periph-
erals screen quite often. Here you
configure, enable, or disable the
onboard devices, such as the inte-
grated sound card (Figure 7.21).
Power Management Setup
As the name implies, you can use the
Power Management Setup screen to
set up the power management set-
tings for the system. These settings
work in concert (sometimes in con-
flict) with Windows’ power manage-
ment settings to control how and
when devices turn off and back on to
conserve power (Figure 7.22).
PnP/PCI Configurations
All CMOS setup utilities come with
menu items that are for the most
part no longer needed, but no one
wants to remove them. PnP/PCI
Configurations is a perfect example.
Plug and play (PnP) is how devices
automatically work when you snap
them into your PC. PCI is a type of slot used for cards. Odds are very good
you’ll never deal with this screen (Figure 7.23).

And the Rest of the CMOS
Settings…
The other options on the main menu
of an Award CMOS do not have
their own screens. Rather, these sim-
ply have small dialog boxes that pop

messages. The Load Fail-Safe/Opti-
mized Defaults options keep you
from having to memorize all of
those weird settings you’ll never
touch. Fail-Safe sets everything to
very simple settings—you might oc-
casionally use this setting when very
low-level problems such as freeze-
ups occur and you’ve checked more
obvious areas first. Optimized sets
the CMOS to the best possible speed/stability for the system. You would use
this option after you’ve tampered with the CMOS too much and you need to
put it back like it was!
Many CMOS setup programs enable you to set a password in CMOS to
force the user to enter a password every time the system boots. Don’t con-
fuse this with the Windows logon password. This CMOS password shows
up at boot, long before Windows even starts to load. Figure 7.24 shows a
typical CMOS password prompt.
Some CMOS setup utilities enable you to create two passwords: one for
boot and another for accessing the CMOS setup program. This extra pass-
word just for entering CMOS setup is a godsend in, for example, schools,
where non-techs tend to wreak havoc in areas (such as CMOS) that they
should not access!
Drive Lock Passwords
On some motherboards, the CMOS setup program
enables you to control the ATA Security Mode Feature Set, also commonly
216
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 7.22
Power Management Setup
• Figure 7.23
PnP/PCI Configurations
• Figure 7.24
CMOS password prompt

referred to as drive lock or DriveLock. ATA Security Mode is the first line of
defense for protecting hard disks from unwanted access when a system is
lost or stolen. It has two passwords, a user password and a master pass-
word; and two modes, high security mode and max security mode. In high
security mode, the drive can be accessed by both the master and user pass-
words. In addition, the master can reset the user password in CMOS setup.
In max security mode, the drive is accessible only with the user pass-
word. In this mode, the master can reset the user password, but all of the
data on the drive is destroyed. Note that in either mode, if the master and
user passwords are both lost, the drive is rendered unusable; these pass-
words are stored in the hard disk’s control circuitry and cannot be reset by
clearing CMOS.
Trusted Platform Module
The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) acts as a se-
cure cryptoprocessor, which is to say that it is a hardware platform for the ac-
celeration of cryptographic functions and the secure storage of associated
information. The specification for the TPM is published by the Trusted Com-
puting Group, an organization whose corporate members include Intel,
Microsoft, AMD, IBM, Lenovo, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and many others.
The TPM can be a small circuit board plugged into the motherboard, or
it can be built directly into the chipset. The CMOS setup program usually
contains settings that can turn the TPM on or off and enable or disable it.
TPMs can be used in a wide array of cryptographic operations, but one
of the most common uses of TPMs is hard disk encryption. For example, the
BitLocker Drive Encryption feature of Microsoft Windows Vista can be ac-
celerated by a TPM, which is more secure because the encryption key is
stored in the tamper-resistant TPM hardware rather than on an external
flash drive. Other possible uses of TPMs include digital rights management
(DRM), network access control, application execution control, and pass-
word protection.
Exiting and Saving Settings
Of course, all CMOS setups provide some method to Save and Exit or to Exit
Without Saving. Use these as needed for your situation. Exit Without Saving
is particularly nice for those folks who want to poke around the CMOS
setup utility but don’t want to mess anything up. Use it!
The CMOS setup utility would meet all of the needs of a modern system
for BIOS if manufacturers would just stop creating new devices. That’s not
going to happen, of course, so let’s turn now to devices that need to have
BIOS loaded from elsewhere.
■Option ROM and Device Drivers
Every piece of hardware in your computer needs some kind of program-
ming that tells the CPU how to talk to that device. When IBM invented the
PC more than a quarter century ago, they couldn’t possibly have included
all of the necessary BIOS routines for every conceivable piece of hardware
on the system ROM chip. How could they? Most of the devices in use today
didn’t exist on the first PCs. When programmers wrote the first BIOS,
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
217

for example, network cards, mice, and sound cards did not exist. Early PC
designers at IBM understood that they could not anticipate every new type
of hardware, so they gave us a few ways to add programming other than on
the BIOS. I call this BYOB—Bring Your Own BIOS. You can BYOB in two
ways: option ROM and device drivers. Let’s look at both.
Option ROM
The first way to BYOB is to put the BIOS on the hardware de-
vice itself. Look at the card displayed in Figure 7.25. This is a
serial ATA RAID hard drive controllerbasically just a card
that lets you add more hard drives to a PC. The chip in the cen-
ter with the wires coming out the sides is a flash ROM storing
BIOS for the card. The system BIOS does not have a clue about
how to talk to this card, but that’s okay, because this card
brings its own BIOS on what’s called an option ROM chip.
Most BIOSes that come on option ROMs tell you that they
exist by displaying information when you boot the system.
Figure 7.26 shows a typical example of an option ROM adver-
tising itself.
In the early days of the PC, you could find all sorts of devices with
BIOSes on option ROMs. Today, option ROMs have mostly been replaced
by more flexible software methods (more on device driver software in the
next section), with one major exception: video cards. Every video card made
today contains its own BIOS. Option ROMs work well but are hard to up-
grade. For this reason, most hardware in PCs relies on software for BYOB.
Device Drivers
A device driver is a file stored on the PC’s hard drive that contains all
of the commands necessary to talk to whatever device it was written
to support. All operating systems employ a method of loading these
device drivers into RAM every time the system boots. They know
which device drivers to install by reading a file (or files) that lists
which device drivers the system needs to load at boot time. All op-
erating systems are designed to look at this list early on in the boot
process and copy the listed files into RAM, thereby giving the CPU
the capability to communicate with the hardware supported by the
device driver.
Device drivers come with the device when you buy it. When you buy a
sound card, for example, it comes with a CD-ROM that holds all of the nec-
essary device drivers (and usually a bunch of extra goodies). The generic
name for this type of CD-ROM is installation disc. In most cases, you install a
new device, start the computer, and wait for Windows to prompt you for the
installation disc (Figure 7.27).
You might want to add or remove device drivers manually at times.
Windows uses a special database called the Registry that stores everything
you want to know about your system, including the device drivers. You
shouldn’t access the Registry directly to access these drivers, but instead use
the venerable Device Manager utility (Figure 7.28).

• Figure 7.26

By using the Device Manager, you can manually change or remove the
drivers for any particular device. You access the Device Manager by first
opening the System applet in the Control Panel; then select the Hardware
tab and click the Device Manager button. Make sure you know how to ac-
cess the Device Manager. You’ll see lots more of the Device Manager as you
learn about different types of devices in the rest of the book.
BIOS, BIOS, Everywhere!
As you should now understand, every piece of hardware on a system must
have an accompanying program that provides the CPU with the code neces-
sary to communicate with that particular device. This code may reside on
the system ROM on the motherboard, on ROM on a card, or in a device
driver file on the hard drive loaded into RAM at boot. BIOS is everywhere
on your system, and you need to deal with it occasionally.
■Power-On Self Test (POST)
BIOS isn’t the only program on your system ROM. When the computer is
turned on or reset, it initiates a special program, also stored on the system
ROM chip, called the power-on self test (POST). The POST program checks
out the system every time the computer boots. To perform this check, the
POST sends out a command that says to all of the devices, “Check yourselves
out!” All of the standard devices in the computer then run their own internal
diagnostic—the POST doesn’t specify what they must check. The quality of
the diagnostic is up to the people who made that particular device.
Let’s consider the POST for a moment. Suppose some device—let’s say
it’s the keyboard controller chip—runs its diagnostic and determines that it
is not working properly. What can the POST do about it? Only one thing
really: tell the human in front of the PC! So how does the computer tell

the human? PCs convey POST information to you in two ways: beep codes
and text messages.
Before and During the Video Test:
The Beep Codes
The computer tests the most basic parts of the computer first, up to and in-
cluding the video card. In early PCs, you’d hear a series of beeps—called
beep codes—if anything went wrong. By using beep codes before and dur-
ing the video test, the computer could communicate with you. (If a POST er-
ror occurs before the video is available, obviously the error must manifest
itself as beeps, because nothing can display on the screen.) The meaning of
the beep code you’d hear varied among different BIOS manufacturers. You
could find the beep codes for a specific motherboard in its motherboard
manual.
Most modern PCs have only a single beep code, which is for bad or miss-
ing video—one long beep followed by two or three short beeps.
You’ll hear three other beep sequences on most PCs (although they’re
not officially beep codes). At the end of a successful POST, the PC produces
one or two short beeps, simply to inform you that all is well. Most systems
make a rather strange noise when the RAM is missing or very seriously
damaged. Unlike traditional beep codes, this code repeats until you shut off
the system. Finally, your speaker might make beeps for reasons that aren’t
POST or boot related. One of the more common is a series of short beeps af-
ter the system’s been running for a while. That’s a CPU alarm telling you the
CPU is approaching its high heat limit.
Text Errors
After the video has tested okay, any POST errors display on the screen
as text errors. If you get a text error, the problem is usually, but not al-
ways, self-explanatory (Figure 7.29). Text errors are far more useful
than beep codes, because you can simply read the screen to determine
the bad device.
POST Cards
Beep codes, numeric codes, and text error codes, although helpful, can
sometimes be misleading. Worse than that, an inoperative device can
sometimes disrupt the POST, forcing the machine into an endless loop.
This causes the PC to act dead—no beeps and nothing on the screen. In
this case, you need a device, called a POST card, to monitor the POST and
identify which piece of hardware is causing the trouble.
POST cards are simple cards that snap into expansion slots on your sys-
tem. A small, two-character light-emitting diode (LED) readout on the card
indicates what device the POST is currently testing (Figure 7.30). The docu-
mentation that comes with the POST card tells you what the codes mean.
BIOS makers also provide this information on their Web sites. Manufac-
turers make POST cards for all types of desktop PCs. POST cards work with

umentation about beep codes,
but it’s usually badly outdated.
Tech Tip
Talking BIOS
Some newer motherboards can
also talk to you if there is a prob-
lem during POST. To use this
feature, all that is normally re-
quired is to plug a pair of speak-
ers or headphones into the
onboard sound card.
• Figure 7.29
POST text error messages

any BIOS, but you need to know the type of
BIOS you have so you can interpret the read-
out properly.
I usually only pull out a POST card when
the usual POST errors fail to appear. When a
computer provides a beep or text error code
that doesn’t make sense, or your machine
keeps locking up, some device has stalled the
POST. Because the POST card tells you which
device is being tested, the frozen system stays
at that point in the POST, and the error stays
on the POST card’s readout.
Many companies sell POST cards today,
with prices ranging from the affordable to the
outrageous. Spend the absolute least amount
of money you can. The more expensive cards
add bells and whistles you do not need, such
as diagnostic software and voltmeters.
Using a POST card is straightforward.
Simply power down the PC, install the POST
card in any unused slot, and turn the PC back
on. As you watch the POST display, notice
the hexadecimal readouts and refer to them
as the POST progresses. Notice how quickly they change. If you get an “FF”
or “00,” that means the POST is over and everything passed—time to check
the operating system. If a device stalls the POST, however, the POST card
displays an error code. That’s the problem device! Good technicians often
memorize a dozen or more POST codes because it’s much faster than look-
ing them up in a book.
So you got a beep code, a text error code, or a POST error. Now what do
you do with that knowledge? Remember that a POST error does not fix the
computer; it only tells you where to look. You then have to know how to
deal with that bad or improperly configured component. If you use a POST
card, for example, and it hangs at the “Initializing Floppy Drive” test, you’d
better know how to work on a floppy drive.
Sometimes the POST card returns a bizarre or confusing error code.
What device do you point at when you get a “CMOS shutdown register
read/write error” beep code from an older system? First of all, read the error
carefully. Let’s say that on that same system you got an “8042—gate A20
failure” beep code. What will you do? Assuming you know (and you
should!) that the “8042” refers to the keyboard, a quick peek at the keyboard
and its connection would be a good first step. Beyond that specific example,
here is a good general rule: if you don’t know what the error means or the
bad part isn’t replaceable, replace the motherboard. Clearly, you will stum-
ble across exceptions to this rule, but more often than not, the rule stands.
The Boot Process
All PCs need a process to begin their operations. Once you feed power to the
PC, the tight interrelation of hardware, firmware, and software enables the
PC to start itself, to “pull itself up by the bootstraps” or boot itself.
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
221
• Figure 7.30
POST card in action

When you first power on the PC, the power supply circuitry tests for
proper voltage and then sends a signal down a special wire called the power
good wire to awaken the CPU. The moment the power good wire wakes it
up, every Intel and clone CPU immediately sends a built-in memory ad-
dress via its address bus. This special address is the same on every Intel and
clone CPU, from the oldest 8086 to the most recent microprocessor. This ad-
dress is the first line of the POST program on the system ROM! That’s how
the system starts the POST. After the POST has finished, there must be a way
for the computer to find the programs on the hard drive to start the operat-
ing system. The POST passes control to the last BIOS function: the bootstrap
loader. The bootstrap loader is little more than a few dozen lines of BIOS
code tacked to the end of the POST program. Its job is to find the operating
system. The bootstrap loader reads CMOS information to tell it where
to look first for an operating system. Your PC’s CMOS setup utility has
an option that you configure to tell the bootstrap loader which devices
to check for an operating system and in which order (Figure 7.31).
Almost all storage devices—floppy disks, hard disks, CDs, DVDs,
and even USB thumb drives—can be configured to boot an operating
system by setting aside a specific location called the boot sector. If the de-
vice is bootable, its boot sector contains special programming designed
to tell the system where to locate the operating system. Any device with a
functional operating system is called a bootable disk or a system disk. If the
bootstrap loader locates a good boot sector, it passes control to the operating
system and removes itself from memory. If it doesn’t, it goes to the next de-
vice in the boot order you set in the CMOS setup utility. Boot order is an im-
portant tool for techs because you can set it to load in special bootable
devices so you can run utilities to maintain PCs without using the primary
operating system.
Now that you’re familiar with CMOS and other chipset features, it’s
time to take an in-depth look at the expansion bus, without which the
chipset would be almost useless.
■Expansion Slots
Expansion slots have been part of the PC from the very beginning. Way back
then, IBM created the PC with an eye to the future; the original IBM PC had
slots built into the motherboard—called expansion slots—for adding expan-
sion cards and thus new functions to the PC. The slots and accompanying
wires and support chips on the first PC and on the latest and greatest PC are
called the expansion bus.
The expandability enabled by an expansion bus might seem obvious to-
day, but think about the three big hurdles a would-be expansion card devel-
oper needed to cross to make a card that would work successfully in an
expansion slot. First, any expansion card needed to be built specifically for
the expansion slotsthat would require the creation of industry standards.
Second, the card needed some way to communicate with the CPU, both to
receive instructions and to relay information. And third, the operating sys-
tem would need some means of enabling the user to control the new device
222

and thus take advantage of its functions. Here’s the short form of those three
hurdles:

Structure and Function of the
Expansion Bus
As you’ve learned, every device in the computer—whether soldered
to the motherboard or snapped into a socket—connects to the external
data bus and the address bus. The expansion slots are no exception.
They connect to the rest of the PC through the chipset. Exactly where on
the chipset varies depending on the system. On some systems, the ex-
pansion slots connect to the Southbridge (Figure 7.32). On other sys-
tems, the expansion slots connect to the Northbridge (Figure 7.33).
Finally, many systems have more than one type of expansion bus, with
slots of one type connecting to the Northbridge and slots of another
type connecting to the Southbridge (Figure 7.34).
The chipset provides an extension of the address bus and data bus
to the expansion slots, and thus to any expansion cards in those slots. If
you plug a hard drive controller card into an expansion slot, it func-
tions just as if it were built into the motherboard, albeit with one big
difference: speed. As you’ll recall from Chapter 5, “Learning CPUs,”
the system crystal—the clock—pushes the CPU. The system crystal
provides a critical function for the entire PC, acting like a drill sergeant
calling a cadence, setting the pace of activity in the computer. Every
device soldered to the motherboard is designed to run at the speed of
the system crystal. A 133-MHz motherboard, for example, has at least
a 133-MHz Northbridge chip and a 133-MHz Southbridge chip, all
timed by a 133-MHz crystal (Figure 7.35).

Clock crystals aren’t just for CPUs and chipsets. Pretty much every chip
in your computer has a CLK wire and needs to be pushed by a clock chip, in-
cluding the chips on your expansion cards. Suppose you buy a device that
did not come with your computer—say, a sound card. The chips on the
sound card need to be pushed by a CLK signal from a crystal. If PCs were
designed to use the system crystal to push that sound card, sound card man-
ufacturers would need to make sound cards for every possible motherboard
speed. You would have to buy a 100-MHz sound card for a 100-MHz system
or a 133-MHz sound card for a 133-MHz system.
That would be ridiculous, and IBM knew it when they designed the PC.
They had to make an extension to the external data bus that ran at its own
standardized speed. You would use this part of the external data bus to snap
new devices into the PC. IBM achieved this goal by adding a different crys-
tal, called the expansion bus crystal, which controlled the part of the external
data bus connected to the expansion slots (Figure 7.36).
The expansion slots run at a
much
slower
speed
than
the
frontside bus. The chipset acts as
the divider between the two buses,
compensating for the speed differ-
ence with wait states and special
buffering (storage) areas. No mat-
ter how fast the motherboard runs,
the expansion slots run at a stan-
dard speed. In the original IBM
PC, that speed was about 14.318
MHz ÷ 2, or about 7.16 MHz. The
latest expansion buses run much
faster,
but
remember
that
old
speed of roughly 7 MHz; as you
learn more about expansion slots,
you’ll see that it’s still needed on
even the most modern systems.
PC Bus
On first-generation IBM PCs, the 8088 CPU had an 8-bit external data bus
and ran at a top speed of 4.77 MHz. IBM made the expansion slots on the
first PCs with an 8-bit external bus connection. IBM wanted the bus to run as
224
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 7.35
The system crystal sets the speed.
• Figure 7.36
Function of system and expansion bus crystals

fast as the CPU, and even way back then,
4.77 MHz was an easy speed to achieve. IBM
settled on a standard expansion bus speed of
about 7 MHz—faster than the CPU! (This was
the only occurrence in the history of PCs
when the expansion bus was faster than the
CPU.) This expansion bus was called the PC
bus or XT bus. Figure 7.37 shows these an-
cient 8-bit expansion slots.
IBM certainly didn’t invent the idea of the
expansion bus—plenty of earlier computers,
including many mainframes, had expansion
slots—but IBM did something no one had
ever done. They allowed competitors to copy
the PC bus and make their own PCs without
having to pay a licensing or royalty fee. They
also allowed third parties to make cards that
would snap into their PC bus. Remember that
IBM invented the PC bus—it was (and still is)
a patented product of IBM Corporation. By
allowing everyone to copy the PC expansion
bus technology, however, IBM established
the industry standard and fostered the emer-
gence of the clone market. If IBM had not allowed others to copy their pat-
ented technologies for free, companies such as Compaq, Dell, and Gateway
never would have existed. Equally, component makers such as Logitech,
Creative, and 3Com would never be the companies they are today without
the help of IBM. Who knows? If IBM had not opened the PC bus to the
world, this book and the CompTIA A+ certification exams might have been
based on Apple computers.

ISA Bus
When Intel invented the 286 processor, IBM
wanted to create a new expansion bus that
took advantage of the 286’s 16-bit external
data bus, yet also supported 8-bit cards. IBM
achieved this by simply adding a set of con-
nections to the end of the PC bus, creating a
new 16-bit bus (Figure 7.38). Many techs
called this bus the AT bus after the first system
to use these slots, the 286-based IBM Ad-
vanced Technology (AT) computer. The AT
bus ran at the same speed (approximately
7 MHz) as the earlier PC bus.
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
225

Sixteen-bit ISA or AT slots

Even though IBM allowed third parties to copy the PC and AT expan-
sion bus architecture, they never released the complete specifications for
these two types of expansion buses. In the early 1980s, a number of clone
makers pooled their combined knowledge of the PC/XT and AT buses to
create the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA).
The ISA bus enabled manufacturers to jump the first of the three hurdles
for successful expansion cards, namely connectivity. If a company wanted
to build a new kind of adapter card for the PC, they simply followed the
specifications in the ISA standard.

Modern Expansion Buses
The ISA expansion bus was both excellent and cutting edge for its time, and
was the expansion bus in every PC for the first ten years of the PC’s exis-
tence. Yet ISA suffered from three tremendous limitations that began to
cause serious bottlenecks by the late 1980s. First, ISA was slow, running at
only about 7 MHz. Second, ISA was narrowonly 16 bits wideand there-
fore unable to handle the 32-bit and 64-bit external data buses of more mod-
ern processors. Finally, techs had to configure ISA cards manually, making
installation a time-consuming nightmare of running proprietary configura-
tion programs and moving tiny jumpers just to get a single card to work.
Manufacturers clearly needed to come up with a better bus that ad-
dressed the many problems associated with ISA. They needed a bus that
could take advantage of the 33-MHz motherboard speed and 32-bit-wide
data bus found in 386 and 486 systems. They also wanted a bus that was self-
configuring, freeing techs from the drudgery of manual configuration.
Finally, they had to make the new bus backward compatible, so end users
wouldn’t have to throw out their oftentimes substantial investment in ISA
expansion cards.
False Starts
In the late 1980s, several new expansion buses designed to address these
shortcomings appeared on the market. Three in particular—IBM’s Micro
Channel Architecture (MCA), the open standard Extended ISA (EISA), and
the Video Electronics Standards Association’s VESA Local Bus (VL-Bus)—
all had a few years of modest popularity from the late 1980s to the mid
1990s. Although all of these alternative buses worked well, they also had
shortcomings that made them less than optimal replacements for ISA: IBM
charged a heavy licensing fee for MCA, EISA was expensive to make, and
VL-Bus only worked in tandem with the ISA bus. By 1993, the PC world was
eager for a big name to come forward with a fast, wide, easy-to-configure,
and cheap new expansion bus. Intel saw the need and stepped up to the
plate with the now famous PCI bus.
226
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

PCI Bus
Intel introduced the peripheral component in-
terconnect (PCI) bus architecture (Figure 7.39)
in the early 1990s, and the PC expansion bus
was never again the same. Intel made many
smart moves with PCI, not the least of which
was releasing PCI to the public domain to
make PCI very attractive to manufacturers.
PCI provided a wider, faster, more flexible al-
ternative than any previous expansion bus.
The exceptional technology of the new bus,
combined with the lack of a price tag, made
manufacturers quickly drop ISA and the
other alternatives and adopt PCI.
PCI really shook up the PC world with its
capabilities. The original PCI bus was 32 bits
wide and ran at 33 MHz, which was superb,
but these features were expected and not earth-shattering. The coolness of
PCI came from its capability to coexist with other expansion buses. When
PCI first came out, you could buy a motherboard with both PCI and ISA
slots. This was important because users could keep their old ISA cards and
slowly migrate to PCI. Equally impressive was that PCI devices were (and
still are) self-configuring, a feature that led to the industry standard that be-
came known as plug and play (PnP). Finally, PCI had a powerful burst-
mode feature that enabled very efficient data transfers.
PCI Bus
32 bits wide
33-MHz speed
Self-configuring
The original PCI expansion bus has soldiered on in PCs for over ten
years. Recently, more advanced forms have begun to appear. Although
these new PCI expansion buses are faster than the original PCI, they’re only
improvements to PCI, not entirely new expansion buses. The original PCI
might be fading away, but PCI in its many new forms is still “King of the
Motherboard.”
AGP
One of the big reasons for ISA’s demise was video cards. When video
started going graphical with the introduction of Windows, ISA buses were
too slow and graphics looked terrible. PCI certainly improved graphics
when it came out, but Intel was thinking ahead. Shortly after Intel invented
PCI, they presented a specialized, video-only version of
PCI called the Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP). An AGP
slot is a PCI slot, but one with a direct connection to the
Northbridge. AGP slots are only for video cards—don’t
try to snap a sound card or modem into one. You’ll learn
much more about this fascinating technology in Chapter
13, “Learning Video and Multimedia.” Figure 7.40
shows a typical AGP slot.
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
227
• Figure 7.39
PCI expansion bus slots
Before PCI, it was rare to see
more than one type of expan-
sion slot on a motherboard. To-
day this is not only common—
it’s expected!
There was a 64-bit version of
the original PCI standard, but it
was quite rare.
• Figure 7.40
AGP slot
The AGP slot is almost uni-
versally brown in color, making
it easy to spot.

PCI-X
PCI Extended (PCI-X), available in
such systems as the Macintosh G5, is a huge
enhancement to current PCI that is also fully
backward compatible in terms of both hard-
ware and software. PCI-X is a 64-bit-wide bus
(Figure 7.41). Its slots will accept regular PCI
cards. The real bonus of PCI-X is its much en-
hanced speed. The PCI-X 2.0 standard features four speed grades (measured
in MHz): PCI-X 66, PCI-X 133, PCI-X 266, and PCI-X 533.
The obvious candidates for PCI-X are businesses using workstations
and servers, because they have the “need for speed” and also the need for
backward compatibility. Large vendors, especially in the high-end market,
are already on board. HP, Dell, and Intel server products, for example, sup-
port PCI-X. A quick online shopping trip reveals tons of PCI-X stuff for sale:
gigabit NICs, Fibre Channel cards, video adapters, and more.
Mini PCI
PCI has even made it into laptops in the specialty Mini
PCI format (Figure 7.42). You’ll find Mini PCI in just about every
laptop these days. Mini PCI is designed to use low power and to
lie flatboth good features for a laptop expansion slot. Mini PCI
returns in Chapter 14, “Learning Portable Computing.”
PCI Express
PCI Express (PCIe) is the latest, fastest, and most
popular expansion bus in use today. As its name implies, PCI
Express is still PCI, but it uses a point-to-point serial connection
instead of PCI’s shared parallel communication. Consider a
single 32-bit chunk of data moving from a device to the CPU. In
PCI parallel communication, 32 wires each carry one bit of that
chunk of data. In serial communication, only one wire carries
those 32 bits. You’d think that 32 are better than one, correct?
Well, first of all, PCIe doesn’t share the bus. A PCIe device has
its own direct connection (a point-to-point connection) to the
Northbridge, so it does not wait for other devices. Plus, when
you start going really fast (think gigabits per second), getting
all 32 bits of data to go from one device to another at the same time is diffi-
cult, because some bits get there slightly faster than others. That means you
need some serious, high-speed checking of the data when it arrives to verify
that it’s all there and in good shape. Serial data doesn’t have this problem, as
all of the bits arrive one after the other in a single stream. When data is really
going fast, a single point-to-point serial connection is faster than a shared
32-wire parallel connection.
And boy howdy, is PCIe ever fast! A PCIe connection uses one wire for
sending and one for receiving. Each of these pairs of wires between a PCIe con-
troller and a device is called a lane. Each direction of a lane runs at 2.5 Gbps, or
5 Gbps with PCIe 2.0. Better yet, each point-to-point connection can use 1, 2, 4,
8, 12, 16, or 32 lanes to achieve a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 320 Gbps.
The effective data rate drops a little bit because of the encoding scheme—the way
the data is broken down and reassembled—but full-duplex data throughput
can go up to a whopping 16 Gbps on a ×16 connection.
The most common PCIe slot is the 16-lane (×16) version most commonly
used for video cards, as shown in Figure 7.43. The first versions of PCIe
motherboards used a combination of a single PCIe ×16 slot and a number of

contacts at the bottom of the picture?

standard PCI slots. (Remember, PCI is designed to work with other expan-
sion slots, even other types of PCI.) There is also a small form factor version
of PCI Express for mobile computers called PCI Express Mini Card.
The bandwidth generated by a ×16 slot is far more than anything other
than a video card would need, so most PCIe motherboards also contain slots
with fewer lanes. Currently ×1 and ×4 are the most common general-pur-
pose PCIe slots, but PCIe is still pretty newso expect things to change as
PCIe matures (Figure 7.44).

When you talk about the
lanes, such as ×1 or ×8, use “by”
rather than “ex” for the multipli-
cation mark. So “by 1” and “by
8” is the correct pronunciation.
You’ll of course hear it spoken
as both “by 8” and “8 ex” for
the next few years until the tech-
nology has become a household
term.

■System Resources
All devices on your computer, including your expansion cards, need to
communicate with the CPU. Unfortunately, just using the word communica-
tion is too simplistic, because communication between the CPU and devices
isn’t like a human conversation. In the PC, only the CPU “talks” in the form
of BIOS or driver commandsdevices only react to the CPU’s commands.
You can divide communication into four aspects called system resources: I/O
addresses, IRQs, DMA channels, and memory addresses.
Not all devices use all four system resources. All devices use I/O ad-
dressing and most use IRQs, but very few use DMA or memory. System re-
sources are not new; they’ve been with PCs since the first IBM PC.
New devices must have their system resources configured. Configura-
tion happens more or less automatically now through the plug-and-play
process, but in the old days, configuration was handled through a painstak-
ing manual process. (You kids don’t know how good you have it. Oops!
SorryOld Man Voice.) Even though system resources are now automated,
you still might run into them in a few places on a modern PC. On those rare
occasions, you’ll need to understand I/O addresses, IRQs, DMAs, and
memory to make changes as needed. Let’s look at each system resource in
detail to understand what they are and how they work.
I/O Addresses
The CPU gives a command to a device by using a pattern of ones and zeros
called an I/O address. Every device responds to at least four I/O addresses,
meaning the CPU can give at least four different commands to each device.
The process of communicating through I/O addresses is called, quite logi-
cally, I/O addressing. Here’s how it works.
The chipset extends the address bus to the expansion slots, which makes
two interesting things happen. First, you can place RAM on a card, and the
CPU can address it just as it can your regular RAM. Devices such as video
cards come with their own RAM. The CPU draws the screen by writing di-
rectly to the RAM on the video card. Second, the CPU can use the address
bus to talk to all of the devices on your computer through I/O addressing.
Normally the address bus on an expansion bus works exactly like the
address bus on a frontside busdifferent patterns of ones and zeros point to
different memory locations. If the CPU wants to send an I/O address, how-
ever, it puts the expansion bus into what can be called I/O mode. When the
bus goes into I/O mode, all devices on the bus look for patterns of ones and
zeros to appear on the address bus.

Shopping Trip
So, what’s the latest PCIe motherboard out there? Get online or go to
your local computer store and research higher-end motherboards. What
combinations of PCIe slots can you find on a single motherboard? Jot
them down and compare with your classmates.

Back in the old Intel 8088 days, the CPU
used an extra wire, called the input/output or
memory (IO/MEM) wire, to notify devices that
it was using the address bus either to specify
an address in memory or to communicate
with a particular device (Figure 7.45). You
won’t find an IO/MEM wire on a modern
CPU, as the process has changed and become
more
complex—but
the
concept
hasn’t
changed one bit. The CPU sends commands to
devices by placing patterns of ones and ze-
ros—I/O addresses—on the address bus.
No two devices share the same I/O ad-
dress because that would defeat the entire
concept. To make sure no two devices share I/
O addresses, all I/O addresses either are pre-
set by standard (for example, all hard drive
controllers use the same I/O addresses on ev-
ery PC) or are set at boot by the operating sys-
tem. You can see the I/O addresses for all of the devices on your computer by
going into the Device Manager. Go to the View menu option and select Re-
sources by type. Click on the plus sign directly to the left of the Input/output
(IO) option to see a list of I/O addresses, as shown in Figure 7.46.
Whoa! What’s with all the letters and numbers? The address bus is always
32 bits (even if you have a 64-bit processor, the Northbridge only allows the
first 32 bits to pass to the expansion slots), so instead of showing you the raw
ones and zeros, the Device Manager shows you the I/O address ranges in hex-
adecimal. Don’t know hex? No worries; hexadecimal is just quick shorthand for
representing the strings of ones and zeros—binary—that you do know. One hex
character is used to represent four binary characters. Here’s the key:
0000 = 0
0001 = 1
0010 = 2
0011 = 3
0100 = 4
0101 = 5

Let’s pick an arbitrary string of ones and zeros:
00000000000000000000000111110000
To convert to hex, just chop them into chunks of four:
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 1111 0000
Then use the key above to convert:
0 0 0 0 0 1 F 0
Then push the hex values together:
000001F0
You now understand what those values mean in the Device Manager.
Scroll down until you find the “[000001F0 – 000001F7] Primary IDE Chan-
nel” setting. Notice that two I/O addresses are listed. These show the entire
range of I/O addresses for this device; the more complex the device, the
more I/O addresses it uses. Address ranges are generally referred to by the
first value in the range, commonly known as the I/O base address.
Here are the most important items to remember about I/O addresses.
First, every device on your PC has an I/O address. Without it, the CPU
wouldn’t have a way to send a device commands. Second, I/O addresses
are configured automatically: you just plug in a device and it works. Third,
no two devices should share I/O addresses. The system handles configura-
tion, so this happens automatically.
Interrupt Requests
Between the standardized expansion bus connections and BIOS using I/O
addressing, the CPU can now communicate with all of the devices inside the
computer, but a third and final hurdle remains. I/O addressing enables the
CPU to talk to devices, but how does a device tell the CPU it needs atten-
tion? How does the mouse tell the CPU that it has moved, for example, or
how does the keyboard tell the CPU that somebody just pressed the J key?
The PC needs some kind of mechanism to tell
the CPU to stop doing whatever it is doing
and talk to a particular device (Figure 7.47).
This mechanism is called interruption.
Every CPU in the PC world has an INT
(interrupt) wire, shown in Figure 7.48. If a de-
vice puts voltage on this wire, the CPU stops
what it’s doing and deals with the interrupt-
ing device. Suppose you have a PC with only
one peripheral, a keyboard that directly
connects to the INT wire. If the user presses
the J key, the keyboard charges the INT wire.
The CPU temporarily stops running the
browser (or whatever program is active) and
runs the necessary BIOS routine to query the
keyboard.
232
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
All I/O addresses only use the
last 16 bits (they all start with
0000). Sixteen bits makes 2
16 =
65,536 I/O address ranges
plenty for even the most modern
PCs. Should PCs begin to need
more I/O addresses in the future,
the current I/O addressing sys-
tem is ready.
• Figure 7.47
How do devices tell the CPU they need attention?

This would be fine if the computer had only one device.
As you know, however, PCs have many devices, and al-
most all of them need to interrupt the CPU at some point.
So the PC needs some kind of traffic cop to act as an inter-
mediary between all of the devices and the CPU’s INT
wire. This traffic-cop chip, called the I/O advanced pro-
grammable interrupt controller (IOAPIC), uses special inter-
rupt wires that run to all devices on the expansion bus
(Figure 7.49).
If a device wants to get the CPU’s attention, it lights the
interrupt wires with a special pattern of ones and zeros just
for that device. The IOAPIC then interrupts the CPU. The
CPU queries the IOAPIC to see which device interrupted,
and then it begins to communicate with the device over the
address bus (Figure 7.50).
These unique patterns of ones and zeros manifest themselves as some-
thing called interrupt requests (IRQs). Before IOAPICs, IRQs were actual

developers drop the I/O part and

wires leading to the previous genera-
tion of traffic cops, called PICs. It’s easy
to see if your system has a PIC or an
IOAPIC. Go into the Device Manager
and select Interrupt request (IRQ) with
the view set to Resources by type.
Figure 7.51 shows nearly a dozen
IRQs, numbered 0 through 22, making
this an IOAPIC system. IRQ 9 is special
this IRQ is assigned to the controller it-
self and is the IOAPIC’s connection to
the CPU. If you look closely, you’ll also
notice that some IRQs aren’t listed.
These are unused or “open” IRQs. If
you add another device to the system,
the new device will take up one of these
unused IRQs. Now look at the older PIC
system in Figure 7.52note that it only
shows IRQs ranging from 0 through 15.
Modern systems running Windows
Vista or Windows 7 can use virtual IRQs
to support devices. A quick glance at the
Device Manager IRQ list in Vista shows a giant list of IRQs, ranging from 0 to
upwards of 190 (Figure 7.53). Some systems even display negative IRQs, such
as –2 or –4. Once you get into a Windows Vista or Windows 7 machine, you
can pretty much forget about IRQs. The OS handles it all automatically.

Let’s look at the last serious vestige of the “bad old days” on your PC:
COM and LPT ports.
COM and LPT Ports
When the PC first came out, the I/O addresses and IRQ for every device had
to be manually configured. How you did this varied from device to device:
you moved jumpers, turned dials, or ran weird configuration programs. It
was never easy. IBM tried to make configuration easier by creating preset I/
O address and IRQ combinations for the serial and parallel ports, because
they were the most commonly used ports on the original PC. These preset
combinations were called COM ports for serial connections and LPT ports for
parallel ports. Table 7.1 lists the early preset combinations of I/O addresses
and IRQs.
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
235
• Figure 7.53
IRQs in Windows Vista
The term “COM” for serial
ports came from “communica-
tion,” and the term “LPT” for
parallel ports came from “line
printer.”

Notice that the four COM ports
share two IRQs. In the old days, if
two devices shared an IRQ, the sys-
tem instantly locked up. The lack of
available IRQs in early systems led
IBM to double up the IRQs for the
serial devices, creating one of the
few exceptions to the rule that no
two devices could share IRQs. You
could share an IRQ between two de-
vices, but only if one of the devices
would never actually access the
IRQ. You’d see this with a dedicated fax/modem card, for example, which
has a single phone line connected to a single card that has two different
functions. The CPU needed distinct sets of I/O addresses for fax commands
and modem commands, but as there was only the one modem doing both
jobs, it needed only a single IRQ.
Direct Memory Access
CPUs do a lot of work. They run the BIOS, operating system, and applica-
tions. CPUs handle interrupts and I/O addresses. CPUs also deal with one
other item: data. CPUs constantly move data between devices and RAM.
CPUs move files from the hard drive to RAM. They move print jobs from
RAM to laser printers, and they move images from scanners to RAM, just to
name a very few examples of this RAM-to-device-and-back process.
Moving all this data is obviously necessary, but it is a simple task—the CPU
has better things to do with its power and time. Moreover, with all of the caches
and such on today’s CPUs, the system spends most of its time waiting around
doing nothing while the CPU handles some internal calculation. Add these
facts together and the question arises:
Why not make devices that access mem-
ory directly, without involving the CPU
(Figure 7.54)? The process of accessing
memory without using the CPU is called
direct memory access (DMA).
DMA is very common and is excel-
lent for creating background sounds in
games and for moving data from floppy
and hard drives into RAM (Figure 7.55).
Nice as it may sound, the concept of
DMA as just described has a problem
there’s only one expansion bus. What if
more than one device wants to use
DMA? What keeps these devices from
stomping on the external data bus all at
the same time? Plus, what if the CPU
suddenly needs the data bus? How can

you stop the device using DMA so
the CPU, which should have prior-
ity, can access the bus? To deal with
this, IBM added another traffic cop.
The DMA controller, which sea-
soned techs often call the 8237 after
its old chip name, controls all DMA
functions. DMA is similar to IRQ
handling in that the DMA control-
ler assigns numbers, called DMA
channels, by which devices can re-
quest use of the DMA. The DMA
also handles the data passing from
peripherals to RAM and vice versa.
This takes necessary but simple
work away from the CPU so the
CPU can spend time doing more
productive work.
The DMA chip sends data along
the external data bus when the CPU
is busy with internal calculations and not using the external data bus. This is
perfectly acceptable, because the CPU accesses the external data bus only
about 5 percent of the time on a modern CPU.
The DMA just described is called classic DMA; it was the first and for a
long time the only way to do DMA. Classic DMA is dying out because it’s
very slow and only supports 16-bit data transfers, a silly waste in a world of
much wider buses. On most systems, only floppy drives still use classic DMA.
All systems still support classic DMA, but most devices today that use
DMA do so without going through the DMA controller. These devices are
known as bus masters. Bus mastering devices have circuitry that enables
them to watch for other devices accessing the external data bus; they can de-
tect a potential conflict and get out of the way on their own. Bus
mastering has become extremely popular in hard drives. All
modern hard drives take advantage of bus mastering. Hard
drive bus mastering is hidden under terms such as Ultra DMA,
and for the most part is totally automatic and invisible.
If you want to see your DMA usage, head back to the De-
vice Manager and change the view to Resources by type. Click
on Direct memory access (DMA) and you’ll see something like
Figure 7.56. This system has only two DMA channels: one for
the floppy drive and one for the connection to the CPU.
One interesting note to DMA is that neither PCI nor PCIe
supports DMA, so you’ll never find a DMA device that snaps
into these expansion buses. A hard drive, floppy drive, or any
other device that still wants to use DMA must do so through
onboard connections. Sure, you can find hard drive and
floppy drive cards, but they’re not using DMA.

the DMA controller; they don’t

Memory Addresses
Some expansion cards need mem-
ory addresses, just like the system
RAM. There are two reasons a card
may need memory addresses. First,
a card may have onboard RAM
that the CPU needs to address. Sec-
ond, a few cards come with an
onboard ROM, the so-called adapter or option ROM you read about earlier
in this chapter. In either of these situations, the RAM or ROM must steal
memory addresses away from the main system RAM to enable the CPU to
access the RAM or ROM. This process is called memory addressing. You can
see memory addresses assigned to expansion cards by clicking on Memory
in the Device Manager when viewing resources by type.
The key fact for techs is that, just like I/O addresses, IRQs, and DMA
channels, memory addressing is fully automatic and no longer an issue.
■Motherboards
So now you understand CMOS and BIOS, you understand the expansion
bus, you understand system addressing…in short, you understand a whole
host of stuff that you probably never thought you’d
know. That’s great and all, but have you wondered
where all this stuff is actually located inside the com-
puter? Well, wonder no more, because it’s time to take a
long, hard look at motherboards!
The motherboard provides the foundation for the
personal computer. Every piece of hardware, from the
CPU to the lowliest expansion card, directly or indirectly
plugs into the motherboard. The motherboard contains
the wires—called traces—that make up the buses of the
system. It holds the vast majority of the ports used by the
peripherals, and it distributes the power from the power
supply (Figure 7.57). Without the motherboard, you lit-
erally have no PC.
Three variable and interrelated characteristics define
modern motherboards: form factor, chipset, and compo-
nents. The form factor determines the physical size of the
motherboard as well as the general location of compo-
nents and ports. The chipset defines the type of proces-
sor and RAM the motherboard requires and determines
to a degree the built-in devices the motherboard sup-
ports, including the expansion slots. Finally, the built-in
components determine the core functionality of the
system.

What’s in Your Machine?
If you haven’t already, open up the Device Manager and check out the
resources assigned to your devices. Does anything use an IRQ? How
many devices use the same IRQ? What about memory addresses?
Where are all those devices located?
• Figure 7.57
Traces visible beneath the CPU socket on a
motherboard

Any good tech should be able to make a recommendation to a client
about a particular motherboard simply by perusing the specs. Because the
motherboard determines function, expansion, and stability for the whole
PC, it’s essential that you know your motherboards!
Form Factors
Form factors are industry-standardized shapes and layouts that enable
motherboards to work with cases and power supplies. A single form factor
applies to all three components. All motherboards come in a basic rectangu-
lar or square shape but vary in overall size and in the layout of built-in com-
ponents (Figure 7.58). You need to install a motherboard in a case designed
to fit it, so the ports and slot openings on the back fit correctly.
The power supply and the motherboard need matching connectors, and
different form factors define different connections. Given that the term
“form factor” applies to the case, motherboard, and power supplythe
three parts of the PC most responsible for moving air around inside the
PC—the form factor also defines how the air moves around in the case.
To perform motherboard upgrades and provide knowledgeable recom-
mendations to clients, techs need to know their form factors. The PC indus-
try has adoptedand droppeda number of form factors over the years
with such names as AT, ATX, and BTX. Let’s start with the granddaddy of
all PC form factors, AT.
AT Form Factor
The AT form factor (Figure 7.59), invented by IBM in the early 1980s, was the
predominant form factor for motherboards through the mid-1990s. AT is
now obsolete.
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
239
Tech Tip
Layers of the PCB
Modern motherboards are layered
printed circuit boards (PCBs),
copper etched onto a nonconductive
material and then coated with
some sort of epoxy for strength.
The layers mask some of their
complexity. You can see some of
the traces on the board, but every
motherboard is two or more lay-
ers thick. The layers contain a
veritable highway of wires, carry-
ing data and commands back and
forth between CPU, Northbridge,
RAM, and peripherals. The lay-
ered structure enables multiple
wires to send data without their
signals interfering with each
other. The layered approach al-
lows the manufacturer to add
complexity and additional compo-
nents to the board without ex-
tending the overall length and
width of the board. Shorter traces
also allow signals to travel faster
than they would if the wires were
longer, as would be necessary if
motherboards did not use layers.
The multiple layers also add
strength to the board itself, so
it doesn’t bend easily.
• Figure 7.58
Typical motherboard

The AT motherboard had a few size variations (Figure 7.60), ranging
from large to very large. The original AT motherboard was huge, around
12 inches wide by 13 inches deep. PC technology was new and needed lots
of space for the various chips necessary to run
the components of the PC.
The
single
greatest
problem
with
AT
motherboards was the lack of external ports.
When PCs were first invented, the only devices
plugged into the average PC were a monitor
and a keyboard. That’s what the AT was de-
signed to handle—the only dedicated connector
on an AT motherboard was the keyboard port
(Figure 7.61).
Over the years, the number of devices
plugged into the back of the PC has grown tre-
mendously. Your average PC today has a key-
board, a mouse, a printer, some speakers, a
monitor, and—if your system’s like mine—four
to six USB devices connected to it at any given
time. These added components created a de-
mand for a new type of form factor, one with
more dedicated connectors for more devices.
Many attempts were made to create a new standard form factor. In-
variably, these new form factors integrated dedicated connectors for
at least the mouse and printer, and many even added connectors for
video, sound, and phone lines.
One variation from the AT form factor that enjoyed a degree of
success was the slimline form factor. The first slimline form factor was
known as LPX (defined in some sources as low profile extended, al-
though there’s some disagreement). It was replaced by the NLX form
factor. (NLX apparently stands for nothing, by the way. It’s just a cool
grouping of letters.) The LPX and NLX form factors met the demands

of the slimline market by providing a central riser
slot to enable the insertion of a special riser card
(Figure 7.62) or, as it’s sometimes called, a
daughterboard. Expansion cards then fit into the
riser card horizontally. Combining built-in connec-
tions with a riser card enabled manufacturers to
produce PCs shorter than 4 inches.
The main problem with form factors such as
LPX and NLX was their inflexibility. Certainly, no
problem occurred with dedicated connections for
such devices as mice or printers, but the new form
factors also added connectors for such devices as
video and sound—devices that were prone to ob-
solescence, making the motherboard out of date
the moment a new type of video or sound card
came into popularity.
ATX Form Factor
There continued to be a tremendous demand for a
new form factor: a form factor that had more standard connectors and also
was flexible enough for possible changes in technology. This demand led to
the creation of the ATX form factor in 1995 (Figure 7.63). ATX got off to a

slow start, but by around 1998, ATX overtook AT to become
the most common form factor used today.
ATX is distinct from AT in the lack of an AT keyboard port,
replaced with a rear panel that has all necessary ports built in.
Note the mini-DIN (PS/2) keyboard and mouse ports at the
left of Figure 7.64, standard features on almost all ATX boards.
You recall those from Chapter 3, “The Visible PC,” right?
The ATX form factor includes many improvements over
AT. The position of the power supply allows better air move-
ment. The CPU and RAM are placed
to provide easier access, and the re-
arrangement of components pre-
vents long expansion cards from
colliding with the CPU or North-
bridge. Other improvements, such
as placing the RAM closer to the
Northbridge and CPU than on AT
boards, offer users enhanced perfor-
mance as well. The shorter the wires,
the easier to shield them and make
them capable of handling double or
quadruple the clock speed of the
motherboard. Figure 7.65 shows AT
and ATX motherboards—note the
radical differences in placement of
internal connections.
The success of ATX has spawned
two form factor subtypes for spe-
cialty uses. The microATX mother-
board (Figure 7.66) floats in at a svelte 9.6 by 9.6 inches or about 30 percent
smaller than standard ATX, yet uses the standard ATX connections. A
microATX motherboard fits into a standard ATX case or in the much smaller
microATX cases. Note that not all microATX motherboards have the same
physical size. You’ll sometimes see microATX motherboards referred to
with the Greek symbol for micro, as in µATX.

Cross Check
High-Speed CPUs and RAM
Modern CPUs such as the Intel Core i7 and the AMD Phenom II incor-
porate the memory controller on the processor rather than locating it on
the Northbridge. This move has facilitated even further increases in the
speed at which the processor can fetch data from RAM. Refer to Chap-
ters 5, “Learning CPUs,” and 6, “Learning RAM,” and see if you can an-
swer these questions.
1.
What different clock frequencies are supported by DDR2 and
DDR3 types of memory?
2.
What processors support DDR3 memory?
Tech Tip
Soft Power
ATX motherboards use a feature
called soft power. This means they
can use software to turn the PC on
and off. The physical manifesta-
tion of soft power is the power
switch. Instead of the thick power
cord used in AT systems, an ATX
power switch is little more than a
pair of small wires leading to the
motherboard. We delve into this
in more detail in Chapter 8,
“Learning PC Power.”

In 1999, Intel created a variant of the
microATX called the FlexATX. FlexATX mother-
boards have maximum dimensions of just 9 by
7.5 inches, which makes them the smallest
motherboards in the ATX standard. Although
FlexATX motherboards can use a standard ATX
power supply, most FlexATX systems use a spe-
cial FlexATX-only power supply. This diminu-
tive power supply fits into tight FlexATX cases.
Keep in mind that each main type of form
factor requires its own case. AT motherboards go
into AT cases, NLX motherboards go into NLX
cases, and ATX motherboards go into ATX cases.
You cannot replace one form factor with another
without purchasing a new case (Figure 7.67). The
exception to this rule is that larger form factor
ATX cases can handle any smaller-sized form
factor motherboards.
BTX Form Factor
Even though ATX addressed ventilation, faster CPUs and powerful graph-
ics cards create phenomenal amounts of heat, motivating the PC industry to
create the “coolest” new form factor used todaythe Balanced Technology
eXtended (BTX) form factor (Figure 7.68). BTX defines three subtypes: stan-
dard BTX, microBTX, and picoBTX, designed to replace ATX, microATX,
and FlexATX, respectively.
At first glance, BTX looks like ATX, but notice that the I/O ports and the
expansion slots have switched sides. You can’t put a BTX motherboard in an
ATX case. BTX does not change the power connection, so there’s no such
thing as a BTX power supply.
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
243
• Figure 7.66
A microATX motherboard
Many techs and Web sites
use the term mini-ATX to refer
to motherboards smaller than a
full ATX board. This is techni-
cally incorrect. The specifica-
tions for these small boards use
only the terms microATX and
FlexATX.
• Figure 7.67
That’s not going to fit!
Many manufacturers sell what
they call BTX power supplies.
These are actually marketing
gimmicks. See Chapter 8,
“Learning PC Power,” for details.

Everything in the BTX form factor is de-
signed to improve cooling. BTX cases vent
cool air in from the front and warm air out the
back. CPUs are moved to the front of the
motherboard so they get cool air coming in
from the front of the case. BTX defines a spe-
cial heat sink and fan assembly called the ther-
mal unit. The thermal unit’s fan blows the hot
CPU air directly out the back of the case, as op-
posed to the ATX method of just blowing the
air into the case.
The BTX standard is clearly a much cooler
option than ATX, but the PC industry tends to
take its time when making big changes such as
moving to a new form factor. As a result, BTX
has not yet made much of an impact in the in-
dustry, and BTX motherboards, cases, and ther-
mal units are still fairly rare. BTX could take off
to become the next big thing or disappear in a
cloud of disinterestonly time will tell.
Proprietary Form Factors
Several major PC makers, including
Dell and Sony, make motherboards
that work only with their cases.
These proprietary motherboards en-
able these companies to create sys-
tems that stand out from the generic
ones and, not coincidently, push
you to get service and upgrades
from their authorized dealers. Some
of the features you’ll see in propri-
etary systems are riser boards like
you see with the NLX form factor—
part of a motherboard separate
from the main one but connected by
a cable of some sort—and unique power connections. Proprietary mother-
boards drive techs crazy because replacement parts tend to cost more and
are not readily available.
Chipset
Every motherboard has a chipset. The chipset determines the type of proces-
sor the motherboard accepts, the type and capacity of RAM, and the sort of
internal and external devices that the motherboard supports. As you
learned earlier, the chips in a PC’s chipset serve as electronic interfaces
through which the CPU, RAM, and input/output devices interact. Chipsets
vary in features, performance, and stability, so they factor hugely in the pur-
chase or recommendation of a particular motherboard. Good techs know
their chipsets!

Motherboard Varieties
Motherboards come in a wide variety of form factors. Go to your local
computer store and check out what is on display. Note the different fea-
tures offered by ATX, microATX, and FlexATX (if any) motherboards.
1.
Does the store still stock any AT motherboards?
2.
What about NLX, BTX, or proprietary motherboards?
3.
Did the clerk use tech slang and call the motherboards
“mobos”? (It’s what most of us call them outside of formal
textbooks, after all!)

Because the chipset facilitates communication be-
tween the CPU and other devices in the system, its com-
ponent chips are relatively centrally located on the
motherboard (Figure 7.69). Most modern chipsets are
composed of two primary chips: the Northbridge and
the Southbridge.
The Northbridge chip on traditional Intel-based
motherboards helps the CPU work with RAM, as men-
tioned earlier in the chapter. On newer AMD- and Intel-
based motherboards, however, the Northbridge does
not work directly with RAM, but instead provides the
communication with the video card. The CPU has
taken on the role of the memory controller. Current
Northbridge chips do a lot and thus get pretty hot, so
they get their own heat sink and fan assembly.
The Southbridge handles some expansion devices
and mass storage drives, such as hard drives. Most
Southbridge chips don’t need extra cooling, leaving the
chip exposed or passively cooled with only a heat sink.
This makes the Southbridge a great place to see the
manufacturer of the chipset, such as Intel.
Many motherboards support very old technologies
such as floppy drives, infrared connections, parallel
ports, and modems. Although supporting these old de-
vices was once part of the Southbridge’s job, hardly any
modern chipsets still support these devices. Motherboard manufacturers
add a third chip called the Super I/O chip to handle these chores. Figure 7.70
shows a typical Super I/O chip.
The system ROM chip provides part of the BIOS for the chipset, but only
at a barebones, generic level. The chipset still needs support for the rest of
the things it can do. So how do expansion devices get BIOS? From software
drivers, of course, and the same holds true for modern chipsets. You have to
load the proper drivers for the specific OS to support all of the features of to-
day’s chipsets. Without software drivers, you’ll never create a stable, fully
functional PC. All motherboards ship with a CD-ROM disc with drivers,
support programs, and extra-special goodies such as antivirus software
(Figure 7.71).
There are a limited number of chipset makers. The domi-
nant chipset vendors today are Intel and NVIDIA, although
several other companies continue to produce chipsets, such
as AMD through its ATI brand. Motherboard manufactur-
ers incorporate the chipsets into motherboards that match
the feature set of the chipset. Chipset companies rise and fall
every few years, with one company seeming to hold the hot
position for a while until another company comes along to
unseat them.
Chipset makers don’t always use the terms Northbridge
and Southbridge. Chipsets for AMD-based motherboards
tend to use the terms, but Intel-based motherboards prefer
to say Memory Controller Hub (MCH) for the Northbridge
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards

Super I/O chips work with
chipsets but are not part of the
chipset. Motherboard makers
purchase them separate from
chipsets.
In an average year, chipset
makers collectively produce
around 100 new chipset models
for the PC market.

and I/O Controller Hub (ICH) for the Southbridge. With the
launch of the X58 Express Chipset, Intel has further refined
their terminology, calling the Northbridge simply the I/O Hub
(IOH) since the memory controller is located on the CPU.
Sometimes Intel refers to the Southbridge as the Legacy I/O Con-
troller Hub. Regardless of the official name, Northbridge and
Southbridge are the commonly used terms. Figure 7.72 shows a
schematic with typical chipset chores for a VIA K8T900 chipset.
It would be impossible to provide an inclusive chipset chart
here that wouldn’t be obsolete by the time you pick this book
up off the shelf at your local tech pub (doesn’t everybody have
one of those?), but Table 7.2 gives you an idea of what to look
for as you research motherboards for recommendations and
purchases.
So why do good techs need to know the hot chipsets in de-
tail? The chipset defines almost every motherboard feature
short of the CPU itself. Techs love to discuss chipsets and ex-
pect a fellow tech to know the differences between one chipset
and another. You also need to be
able to recommend a motherboard
that suits a client’s needs.
Motherboard
Components
The connections and capabilities of
a motherboard sometimes differ
from those of the chipset the moth-
erboard uses. This disparity hap-
pens for a couple of reasons. First, a
particular
chipset
may
support
eight USB ports, but to keep costs
down, the manufacturer might in-
clude only four ports. Second, a
motherboard maker may choose to
install
extra
featuresones
not
supported by the chipsetby add-
ing additional chips. A common ex-
ample
is
a
motherboard
that
supports FireWire. Other technolo-
gies you might find are built-in
sound, hard drive RAID control-
lers, and AMR or CNR slots for mo-
dems, network cards, and more.

port arrangement. My motherboard supports eight USB ports and
two FireWire ports, for example, but if you look on the back of the
motherboard, you’ll only see four USB ports and one FireWire port.
So, where are the other ports? Well, this motherboard has special
connectors for the other ports, and the motherboard comes with the
dongles you need to connect them (Figure 7.73). These dongles typi-
cally use an extra slot on the back of the case.
These dongle connectors are standardized, so many cases have
built-in front USB/FireWire ports that have dongles attached. This
is very handy for USB or FireWire devices you might want to plug
and unplug frequently, such as thumb drives or digital cameras.
You can also buy add-on front USB and FireWire devices that go
into a 3.5-inch drive bay (Figure 7.74).
Sound
Quite a few motherboards come with onboard sound chips. These
sound chips are usually pretty low quality compared to even a
lower-end sound card, but onboard sound is cheap and doesn’t
take up a slot. These connectors are identical to the ones used on
sound cards, so we’ll save more discussion for Chapter 13,
“Learning Video and Multimedia.”
RAID
RAID stands for redundant array of independent (or inexpensive) disks and is
very common on motherboards. There are many types of RAID, but the
RAID on motherboards usually only supports mirroring (the process of us-
ing two drives to hold the same data, which is good for safety, because if one
drive dies, the other still has all of the data) or striping (making two drives
act as one drive by spreading data across them, which is good for speed).
RAID is a very cool but complex topic that’s discussed in detail in Chapter 9,
“Hard Drive Technologies.”
AMR/CNR
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
must certify any electronic device to ensure that it does
not transmit unwanted electronic signals. This process
is a bit expensive, so in the very late 1990s, Intel came up
with a special slot called the audio modem riser (AMR),
shown in Figure 7.75. An AMR slot was designed to take
specialized AMR devices (modems, sound cards, and
network cards). An AMR device would get one FCC cer-
tification and then be used on as many motherboards as
the manufacturer wanted without going through the
FCC certification process again. AMR was quickly re-
placed with the more advanced communications and
networking riser (CNR). Many motherboard manufac-
turers used these slots in the early 2000s, but they’ve lost
popularity because most motherboard makers simply
use onboard networking and sound.

Chapter 7 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about BIOS and CMOS, the expansion bus, and
motherboards.
Explain the function of BIOS
■
The CPU must be able to communicate with all
devices in a computer system. The Northbridge chip
is the primary communication bridge between the
CPU and the rest of the computer. The Northbridge
deals with high-speed devices such as the video card,
RAM, and PCI bus. A second chip, the Southbridge,
works with the other devices. The Northbridge and
Southbridge chips are manufactured as a set called
the chipset. The chipset extends the data and address
buses to every device in the PC.
■
A ROM (read-only memory) chip is nonvolatile,
meaning it retains the information stored on it even
when the power is turned off. Usually attached to
the Southbridge, the ROM chip stores hundreds of
little programs that enable the CPU to communicate
with basic devices such as the floppy drive, CD
and DVD drives, hard drives, video card, and
others. These programs, called services, are
collectively referred to as the basic input/output
services (BIOS). These programs are stored on a
read-only medium and can’t be changed by the
user, so they are known as firmware, in contrast
to software, which are programs stored on erasable
media. The term “system ROM” refers to the ROM
chip on the motherboard.
■
Although the system ROM chip has room for as
much as 2 MB of programs, only 65,536 bytes
store the BIOS. Correspondingly, the last 65,536
addresses on the address bus are reserved for the
BIOS on the ROM chip. When the CPU indicates
one of these reserved addresses, the Northbridge
sends the address directly to the ROM BIOS.
■
The ROM BIOS includes programs that enable the
CPU to talk to many basic hardware devices such
as the keyboard, but other devices not supported
by the ROM BIOS may have their own ROM chips.
■
Each piece of hardware in the computer needs
programs for everything that piece of hardware
performs. The CPU must access these programs to
get the hardware to do its job. IBM also devised
other methods to get BIOS to the hardware of the
computer. If the hardware is common, necessary,
and does not change, such as the keyboard, the
system ROM chip stores the BIOS. If the hardware
is common and necessary but may change from
time to time, such as when you install a larger hard
drive or add more RAM, the BIOS for the general
type of device (e.g., a hard drive) can be on the
system ROM chip. The information describing
specific features unique to that particular device
(e.g., a Seagate Barracuda 60-GB drive), however,
must be stored on a changeable storage medium
such as a complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) chip.
Distinguish among various CMOS setup utility options
■
Your motherboard includes a changeable chip,
capable of storing about 64 KB of data, called the
complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
chip. CMOS does not store programs. It stores the
data that is read by BIOS, and that data is used by
the programs residing in BIOS. Although CMOS
used to be a separate chip on the motherboard, it is
almost always built into the Southbridge on modern
motherboards. The CMOS chip also keeps track of
the date and time. To maintain its date, CMOS
requires a constant trickle of electricity supplied by a
small battery on the motherboard. If the data you
have stored in CMOS continues to disappear or if
the date/time resets itself, it may be time to change
the motherboard battery.
■
Within the system ROM is a CMOS setup program
that lets you access and update the data on the
CMOS chip. The terms CMOS setup program,
CMOS, and system setup utility are functionally
interchangeable today. Most techs just call it the
CMOS. Two major manufacturers control
99 percent of the BIOS business: American
Megatrends (AMI) and Phoenix Technology
(which includes Award Software). The CMOS
250
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

setup program can be started in many different
ways, depending on the brand of BIOS you have
on your computer. Pressing DEL when the
computer boots is the most common way to access
the CMOS setup program. The screen itself usually
tells you how to access setup. If it doesn’t, you can
check the motherboard book or the Web site of
your PC or BIOS manufacturer.
■
All CMOS setup programs have basically the same
main options. On the Standard CMOS Features
screen, you can change floppy drive, hard drive,
and date/time settings. Today’s setup programs
have extra CMOS settings that control such items
as memory management, password and booting
options, diagnostic and error handling, and power
management. The Award Modular BIOS enables
motherboard manufacturers to add or remove
options from the setup program.
■
Among the other things you can configure in
CMOS setup are the voltage and multiplier settings
for the CPU (the CPU SoftMenu), boot options
(check the Advanced BIOS Features menu), power
management, password protection, and ports (the
Integrated Peripherals menu). All setup programs
include options to Save and Exit or Exit Without
Saving. You should not change CMOS settings
unless you know exactly what you’re doing.
■
On older systems, if the information on the CMOS
chip was lost or erased, the computer would not
boot. The most common cause was a dead onboard
battery, but other factors such as electrical surges,
chip creep, or a dirty motherboard could also erase
CMOS data. Lost CMOS information produces
errors such as No boot device available or CMOS date/
time not set. Making a backup copy of the CMOS
data enabled you to restore the information and
recover from this catastrophe.
■
Unlike earlier ROM chips that you had to replace
when you wanted to upgrade the BIOS programs,
today’s computers use flash ROM chips that you
can reprogram without removing. If you install a
CPU or other new hardware that the flash ROM
chip does not support, you can run a small
command-line program combined with an update
file to change your BIOS. The exact process varies
from one motherboard maker to another. If the
flash ROM utility allows you to make a backup of
your BIOS, you should always do so. Don’t update
your BIOS unless you have a good reason. As the
old saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!”
■
Many CMOS setup programs enable you to set a
boot password, a password to enter the CMOS
setup program itself, or both. These passwords are
stored in CMOS. If you forget your password, you
simply need to clear the CMOS data. Unplug the
AC power from the PC and remove the motherboard
battery. This removes the trickle charge that enables
CMOS to store information and clears all CMOS
data, including the passwords. Reinstall the battery,
plug in the power cord, boot up the computer, and
re-enter your CMOS settings. Alternatively, many
motherboards provide a clear CMOS jumper you
can use to clear the CMOS data without removing
the battery. Small padlocks on the system chassis
can prevent unauthorized users from accessing the
motherboard and clearing CMOS data.
Describe option ROM and device drivers
■
Newer hardware devices that are not supported by
the system BIOS have other ways to BYOB—bring
your own BIOS. A hardware device, such as a SCSI
host adapter, may contain its own BIOS chip or
ROM chip known as option ROM. Every video
card contains its own BIOS for internal functions.
A more flexible way to BYOB is to use files called
device drivers that contain instructions to support
the hardware device. Device drivers load when the
system boots.
■
Many devices come with device driver files on
installation discs. These drivers must be loaded for
the PC to recognize and use the devices. In a
database called the Registry, Windows keeps a list
of what drivers should be loaded. Editing the
Registry directly is dangerous (a mistake can
prevent Windows from booting up), but you can
safely install or remove drivers by using the Device
Manager.
Explain the function of the power-on self test (POST)
■
In addition to the BIOS routines and the CMOS
setup program, the system ROM also includes a
special program called the power-on self test (POST)
that is executed every time the computer boots.
POST first has basic devices, up to and including
video, run self-diagnostics. If a device detects an
error, the computer alerts you with a series of beeps.
Different ROM manufacturers have used different
beep codes, but your motherboard book should
explain them (particularly in older systems).
After the basic devices, POST tells the rest of the
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
251

devices to run tests and displays a text error
message on the screen if anything is wrong. Some
manufacturers use numeric error codes or combine
numeric and text messages.
■
The computer may beep in two situations that are
not related to POST beep codes. If the computer
beeps constantly until you shut it off, it means
RAM is missing or damaged. If the computer beeps
after it is booted, it is probably warning you that
the system is overheating.
■
If the computer appears dead, with no beeps or
screen response, you can place a POST card in an
expansion slot to diagnose the problem by using
the LED readout on the card. The documentation
that comes with the POST card explains the LED
codes for your particular BIOS.
■
A beep code, text error message, or POST error
may identify a problem, but it does not fix it. After
you know which device is causing the problem,
you should check the connection for the troublesome
device and replace it if possible. If you cannot
remove the bad part or if you cannot interpret the
error message, you may need to replace the
motherboard.
■
When you first power on the PC, the power supply
circuitry tests for proper voltage and then sends a
signal down a special wire called the power good
wire to awaken the CPU. The moment the power
good wire wakes it up, the CPU sends a built-in
memory address via its address bus. This address
is the first line of the POST program on the system
ROM, which is how the system starts the POST.
After the POST has finished, it passes control to the
bootstrap loader function on the system BIOS. This
program looks for an operating system, checking
the floppy drive, hard drives, or other bootable
devices to find the boot sector that identifies the
location of the OS. When the BIOS finds a bootable
or system disk or device that has a functional
operating system, it passes control to that disk
or device.
Identify the structure and function of the
expansion bus
■
IBM developed the first expansion bus, the PC bus
(or XT bus), as a means for users to install after-
market hardware. The standardized expansion bus
design addressed three main hurdles faced by
expansion card manufacturers: physically
connecting expansion cards to the motherboard,
facilitating communication between the expansion
card and the rest of the system, and allowing the
user to control the expansion card to take
advantage of its features.
■
Every device in the computer connects to the
external data bus and the address bus. Expansion
slots enable expansion cards to connect to these
same buses. Depending on the system, the
expansion slots may connect to the Southbridge or
the Northbridge. Many systems have more than
one type of expansion bus, with slots connecting to
both the Southbridge and the Northbridge. It is the
chipset that extends the address bus and data bus
to the expansion slots.
■
Expansion buses run at a standardized speed,
depending on the type of expansion bus. This
speed, which is much slower than the frontside
bus, is dictated by the expansion bus crystal. The
chipset uses wait states and buffers to compensate
for the difference in speed between the expansion
and frontside buses.
■
The original IBM PCs ran an 8088 CPU with an 8-
bit external data bus at a speed of 4.77 MHz, which
was actually slower than the 7-MHz expansion
bus. With the introduction of the Intel 286 CPU and
its 16-bit external data bus, IBM developed what
was called the AT bus and is now known as the
ISA bus. The ISA expansion bus was 16 bits and
ran at about 7 MHz. ISA cards required tedious
manual configuration.
■
The limitations of the ISA bus led to the development
of other buses, including MCA, EISA, VL-Bus, and
the PCI bus.
Describe the modern expansion bus
■
PCI improved upon ISA in several ways. It was
32 bits, ran at 33 MHz, and was self-configuring
(no more manual configuration of expansion card
jumpers). Additionally, it could coexist with other
expansion buses.
■
As operating systems such as Windows became
more graphically intense, the demand for sending
video data quickly was too much for the ISA or
standard PCI bus. The AGP slot is a special PCI
slot for video cards, with a direct connection to the
Northbridge. You can easily find the AGP slot on a
motherboard: a lone slot that’s brown in color.
252
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

■
Enhancements to the PCI bus paved the way for a
few modern variations. PCI-X is 64 bits wide,
backward compatible with PCI, and available in a
variety of speeds up to 533 MHz. Mini PCI is
designed for laptops with an emphasis on low
power consumption and a small, flat physical
design. Finally, PCIe, with its point-to-point serial
connection, touts speeds as high as 16 Gbps.
Explain classic system resources
■
Devices in a computer system communicate via the
four system resources: I/O addresses, IRQs,
DMAs, and memory addresses. Not all devices use
all four system resources. Earlier systems required
manual configuration of each device’s system
resources through jumpers, DIP switches, dials, or
software. Modern systems feature plug and play,
which automatically configures system resources
for each device. The system resources assigned to
each device can be seen in the Device Manager.
■
I/O addresses enable the CPU to send commands
to devices. These addresses are configured
automatically, and no two devices may share an
I/O address. A single device may be assigned a
range of I/O addresses; the first address in the
range is called the I/O base address.
■
IRQs enable devices to signal the CPU that they
need attention. Before reaching the CPU, all
interrupts pass through the I/O advanced
programmable interrupt controller, which manages
all of the incoming interrupts and forwards them
to the CPU. In older systems, scarce IRQs and
manual resource allocation meant that IRQ
conflicts (and subsequent system lockups) were
common. This is not a problem in modern systems,
which have more IRQs and handle them
automatically to avoid such conflicts.
■
COM and LPT ports are simply presets of an
IRQ–I/O address combination developed to make
configuration of common devices easier. COM
ports are for serial connections and LPT ports are
for parallel connections.
■
DMA enables devices to communicate with RAM
without involving the CPU. The DMA controller
sits between the devices and RAM and handles the
DMA requests much as IRQ requests are handled.
Newer systems use a type of DMA called bus
mastering, which works without the need of a
DMA controller.
■
Memory addresses are used by devices that have
either their own RAM (such as video cards) or their
own ROM. When devices have their own RAM or
ROM, they get memory addresses just like system
RAM so the CPU can access their onboard
memory.
Explain how motherboards work
■
Every piece of hardware connects either directly or
indirectly to the motherboard. Wires called traces
make up the buses on the system, enabling
hardware to communicate. Motherboards are
several layers thick, with traces running across
each layer, creating a veritable highway of wires.
■
Motherboards are defined by their form factor,
chipset, and components. The form factor defines
the physical size and airflow; the chipset defines
the type of CPU, the type and amount of RAM, and
the components a motherboard will support.
Identify the types of motherboards
■
The Advanced Technology (AT) form factor,
though now obsolete, was the predominant form
factor for motherboards through the mid-1990s. Its
identifying features included a large keyboard
plug and a split power socket called P8/P9.
■
LPX and NLX were slimline form factors, meaning
they were ideal for low-profile cases. They offered
a central riser slot to accept a special riser card into
which expansion cards fit horizontally.
■
The Advanced Technology Extended (ATX) form
factor replaced the AT as the form factor of choice
by the late 1990s. It offered several improvements
over the AT, including repositioning the power
supply for better airflow, easier access to CPU and
RAM slots, and better performance by moving
RAM closer to the Northbridge and CPU. The
microATX (µATX) and FlexATX are subtypes of
the ATX and are considerably smaller.
■
The Balanced Technology eXtended (BTX) form
factor is newer than ATX and was designed to
improve cooling. BTX cases take cool air in from
the front and blow warm air out the back. As BTX
motherboards place the CPU toward the front of
the case, the CPU receives additional cooling from
the improved airflow. Standard BTX, microBTX,
and picoBTX are designed to replace ATX,
microATX, and FlexATX, respectively.
Chapter 7: Learning Motherboards
253

■
Several PC manufacturers make proprietary
motherboards, meaning they do not adhere to a
standard form factor such as ATX or BTX.
Servicing a system like this can be frustrating, as
parts may be difficult to find and are often
available only from authorized dealers.
■
Motherboards come with differing features or
components such as USB/FireWire ports, audio,
video, RAID, and AMR or CNR slots for modems
and network cards. Sometimes a motherboard
supports several USB/FireWire ports but does not
have rear ports for all of them. In this case, the
motherboard likely has connections for the
additional ports to be used in conjunction with a
dongle to create front-mounted ports.
Explain chipset varieties
■
Every motherboard has a chipset that determines
the type of CPU the motherboard supports, the
type and capacity of RAM, and the devices the
motherboard supports without an expansion card.
Most modern chipsets are composed of two primary
chips: the Northbridge and the Southbridge. As the
Northbridge works with the CPU and RAM, it gets
very hot and therefore needs its own heat sink and
fan. The Southbridge usually does not require any
extra cooling and is thus exposed, making it a great
place to find the stamp of the chipset manufacturer.
■
Because almost no modern chipset supports old
technologies such as floppy disk drives, infrared
connections, and parallel ports, motherboards
contain a third chip called the Super I/O chip to
support these technologies. The Super I/O chip is
not part of the chipset.
■
The system ROM chip provides basic support for
the chipset, but to benefit from all of the features of
a chipset, you need to install the operating system–
specific drivers for the chipset once you’ve installed
the operating system.
■
Chipset manufacturers for AMD-based
motherboards tend to use the terms Northbridge
and Southbridge, whereas Intel-based boards tend
to use different terminology. You might see the
Northbridge referred to as the Memory Controller
Hub (MCH) or I/O Hub (IOH) and the Southbridge
referred to as the I/O Controller Hub (ICH) or
Legacy I/O Controller Hub.
■
Popular chipset manufacturers today include Intel,
AMD, and NVIDIA.

Watch closely as your computer boots to see if it
displays a message about how to reach the setup
program. If it does not, consult your motherboard
book to try to locate this information. Then, using
the method appropriate for your system BIOS chip,
access the setup program and examine the various
screens. Do not change anything! Usually, your
motherboard book includes default settings for the
various setup screens and perhaps includes
explanations of the various choices. Compare what
you see on the screen with what the book says. Do
you see any differences? If so, how do you account
for these differences? As you examine the setup
program, answer the following questions:
•

powering the PC

P
owering the PC requires a single box—the power supply—that takes
electricity from the wall socket and transforms it into electricity to run the
motherboard and other internal components. Figure 8.1 shows a typical power
supply inside a case. All of the wires dangling out of it connect to the
motherboard and peripherals.
As simple as this appears on the surface, power supply issues are of critical
importance for techs. Problems with power can create system instability,
crashes, and data loss—all things most computer users would rather avoid!
Good techs therefore know an awful lot about powering the PC, from
understanding the basic principles of electricity to knowing the many variations
of PC power supplies. Plus, you need to know how to recognize power problems
and implement the proper solutions. Too many techs fall into the “just plug it
in” camp and never learn how to deal with power, much to their clients’
unhappiness.

Historical/Conceptual
■Understanding Electricity
Electricity is simply a flow of negatively charged particles, called electrons,
through matter. All matter enables the flow of electrons to some extent. This
flow of electrons is very similar to the flow of water through pipes; so simi-
lar that the best way to learn about electricity is by comparing it to how wa-
ter flows though pipes. So let’s talk about water for a moment.
Water comes from the ground, through wells, aquifers, rivers, and so forth.
In a typical city, water comes to you through pipes from the water supply com-
pany that took it from the ground. What do you pay for when you pay your
water bill each month? You pay for the water you use, certainly, but built into
the price of the water you use is the surety that when you turn the spigot, water
will flow at a more or less constant rate. The water sits in the pipes under pres-
sure from the water company, waiting for you to turn the spigot.
Electricity works essentially the same way as water. Electric companies
gather or generate electricity and then push it to your house under pressure
through wires. Just like water, the electricity sits in the wires, waiting for
you to plug something into the wall socket, at which time it’ll flow at a more
or less constant rate. You plug a lamp into an electrical outlet and flip the
switch, electricity flows, and you have light. You pay for reliability, electri-
cal pressure, and electricity used.
The pressure of the electrons in the wire is called voltage and is measured
in units called volts (V). The amount of electrons moving past a certain point
on a wire is called the current or amperage, which is measured in units
called amperes (amps or A). The amount of amps and volts needed so that a
particular device will function is expressed as how much wattage (watts or W)
Chapter 8: Learning PC Power
259
Some questions on the
CompTIA A+ Essentials exam
could refer to a power supply as
a PSU, for power supply unit. A
power supply also falls into the
category of field replaceable unit
(FRU), which refers to the typical
parts a tech should carry, such
as RAM and a hard drive.
• Figure 8.1
Typical power supply mounted inside the PC system unit

that device needs. The correlation between the three is very simple math:
V × A = W. You’ll learn more about wattage a little later in this chapter.
Wires of all sorts—whether copper, tin, gold, or platinum—have a slight
resistance to the flow of electrons, just as water pipes have a slight amount of
friction that resists the flow of water. Resistance to the flow of electrons is
measured in ohms (Ω).
■
Pressure = voltage (V)
■
Volume flowing = amperes (A)
■
Work = wattage (W)
■
Resistance = ohms (Ω)
A particular thickness of wire only handles so much electricity at a time.
If you push too much through, the wire will overheat and break, much as an
overloaded water pipe will burst. To make sure you use the right wire for
the right job, all electrical wires have an amperage rating, such as 20 amps. If
you try to push 30 amps through a 20-amp wire, the wire will break and
electrons will seek a way to return into the ground. Not a good thing, espe-
cially if the path back to the ground is through you!
Circuit breakers and ground wires provide the basic protection from acci-
dental overflow. A circuit breaker is a heat-sensitive electrical switch rated at
a certain amperage. If you push too much amperage through the circuit
breaker, the wiring inside detects the increase in heat and automatically
opens, stopping the flow of electricity before the wiring overheats and breaks.
You reset the circuit breaker to reestablish the circuit and electricity flows
once more through the wires. A ground wire provides a path of least resis-
tance for electrons to flow back to ground in case of an accidental overflow.
Many years ago your electrical supply used fuses instead of circuit break-
ers. Fuses are small devices with a tiny filament designed to break if subjected
to too much current. Unfortunately, fuses had to be replaced every time they
blew, making circuit breakers much more preferable. Even though you no lon-
ger see fuses in a building’s electrical circuits, many electrical devicessuch as
a PC’s power supplyoften still use fuses for their own internal protection.
Electricity comes in two flavors: direct current (DC), in which the electrons
flow in one direction around a continuous circuit, and alternating current (AC),
in which the flow of electrons alternates direction back and forth in a circuit
(Figure 8.2). Most electronic devices use DC power, but all power companies
supply AC power because AC travels long distances much
more efficiently than DC.
■Powering the PC
Your PC uses DC voltage, so some conversion process
must take place before the PC can use AC power from the
power company. The power supply in a computer con-
verts high-voltage AC power from the wall socket to
low-voltage DC. The first step in powering the PC, there-
fore, is to get and maintain a good supply of AC power.
Second, you need a power supply to convert AC to the
proper voltage and amperage of DC power for the

PC use.

motherboard and peripherals. Finally, you need to control the byproduct of
electricity use, namely heat. Let’s look at the specifics of powering the PC.
Supplying AC
Every PC power supply must have standard AC power from the power com-
pany, supplied steadily rather than in fits and spurts, and protection against ac-
cidental blurps in the supply. The power supply connects to the power cord
(and thus to an electrical outlet) via a standard IEC-320 connector. In the United
States, standard AC comes in somewhere between 110 and 120 volts, often
written as ~115 VAC (volts of alternating current). The rest of the world uses
220–240 VAC, so most power supplies have a little switch in the back so you
can use them anywhere. These power supplies with voltage-selection switches
are referred to as fixed-input. Power supplies that you do not have to manually
switch for different voltages are known as auto-switching. Figure 8.3 shows the
back of a power supply. Note the three components, from top to bottom: the
hard on/off switch, the 115/230 switch, and the IEC-320 connector.
Before plugging anything into an AC outlet, take a moment to test the out-
let first by using a multimeter or a device designed exclusively to test outlets.
Failure to test AC outlets properly can result in inoperable or destroyed
equipment, as well as possible electrocution. The IEC-320 plug has three
holes, called hot, neutral, and ground. These names describe the function of
the wires that connect to them behind the wall plate. The hot wire carries
electrical voltage, much like a pipe that delivers water. The neutral wire car-
ries no voltage, but instead acts like a water drain, completing the circuit by
returning electricity to the local source, normally a breaker panel. The ground
wire makes it possible for excess electricity to return safely to the ground.
When testing AC power, you want to check for three things: that the hot out-
puts approximately 115 V (or whatever the proper voltage is for your part of
Chapter 8: Learning PC Power
261
Flipping the AC switch on the
back of a power supply can
wreak all kinds of havoc on a PC.
Moving the switch to ~230 V in
the United States makes for a
great practical joke (as long as
the PC is off when you do it)—
the PC might try to boot up but
probably won’t get far. You
don’t risk damaging anything by
running at half the AC the power
supply is expecting. In countries
that run ~230 standard, on the
other hand, firing up the PC with
the AC switch set to ~115 can
cause the power supply to die a
horrid, smoking death. Watch
that switch!

and that the ground connects to ground (again, 0 V). Figure
8.4 shows the voltages at an outlet.
You can use a multimeter—often also referred to as a
volt-ohm meter (VOM) or digital multimeter (DMM)—to mea-
sure
a

of
aspects
of
electrical
current.
A
multimeter consists of two probes, an analog or digital
meter, and a dial to set the type of test you want to per-
form. Refer to Figure 8.5 to become familiar with the com-
ponents of the multimeter.
Note that some multimeters use symbols rather than let-
ters to describe AC and DC settings. The V with the solid line
above a dashed line, for example, in Figure 8.6, refers to di-
rect current. The V~ stands for alternating current.
Every multimeter offers at least four types of electri-
cal tests: continuity, resistance, AC voltage (VAC), and
DC voltage (VDC). Continuity tests whether electrons
can flow from one end of a wire to the other end. If so,
you have continuity; if not, you don’t. You can use this
setting to determine if a fuse is good or to check for
breaks in wires. If your multimeter doesn’t have a conti-
nuity tester (many cheaper multimeters do not), you can
use the resistance tester. A broken wire or fuse will show
infinite resistance, while a good wire or fuse will show no
resistance. Testing AC and DC voltages is a matter of
making sure the measured voltage is what it should be.
Using Special Equipment to Test AC Voltage
A number of good AC-only testing devices are available.
With these devices, you can test all voltages for an AC
outlet by simply inserting them into the outlet. Be sure
to test all of the outlets the computer system uses:
power supply, external devices, and monitor. Although

Protecting the PC from Spikes
and Sags in AC Power
If all power companies could sup-
ply electricity in smooth, continu-
ous flows with no dips or spikes in
pressure, the next two sections of
this chapter would be irrelevant.
Unfortunately,
no
matter
how
clean the AC supply appears to a
multimeter, the truth is that volt-
age from the power company tends
to drop well below (sag) and shoot
far above (surge or spike) the stan-
dard 115 V (in the United States).
These sags and spikes usually
don’t affect lamps and refrigera-
tors, but they can keep your PC
from running or can even destroy a
PC or peripheral device. Two es-
sential devices handle spikes and
sags in the supply of AC: surge
suppressors and uninterruptible
power supplies.
Surge Suppressors
Surges or spikes
are far more dangerous than sags.
Even a strong sag only shuts off or
reboots your PC; any surge can harm your computer, and a strong surge de-
stroys components. Given the seriousness of surges, every PC should use a
surge suppressor device that absorbs the extra voltage from a surge to protect
the PC. The power supply does a good job of surge suppression and can
handle many of the smaller surges that take place fairly often. But the power
supply takes a lot of damage from this and will eventually fail. To protect
your power supply, a dedicated surge suppressor works between the power
supply and the outlet to protect the system from power surges (Figure 8.8).
Most people tend to spend a lot of money on their PC and for some rea-
son suddenly get cheap on the surge suppressor. Don’t do that! Make sure
your surge suppressor has the Underwriters Laboratories UL 1449 for 330 V
rating to ensure substantial protection for your system. Underwriters Labo-
ratories (www.ul.com) is a U.S.-based, not-for-profit, widely recognized in-
dustry testing laboratory whose testing standards are very important to the
consumer electronics industry. Additionally, check the joules rating before
buying a new surge suppressor. A joule is a unit of electrical energy. How
much energy a surge suppressor can handle before it fails is described in
Chapter 8: Learning PC Power

Using a Multimeter to Test AC Outlets
Every competent technician knows how to use a multimeter, so if you
haven’t used one in the past, get hold of one and Try This!
First you need to set up the meter for measuring AC. Follow these
steps:
1.
Move the selector switch to the AC V (usually red). If multiple
settings are available, put it into the first scale higher than 120 V
(usually 200 V). Auto-range meters set their own range; they
don’t need any selection except AC V.
2.
Place the black lead in the common (–) hole. If the black lead is
permanently attached, ignore this step.
3.
Place the red lead in the V-Ohm-A (+) hole. If the red lead is
permanently attached, ignore this step.
Once you have the meter set up for AC, go through the process of
testing the various wires on an AC socket. Just don’t put your fingers on
the metal parts of the leads when you stick them into the socket! Follow
these steps:
1.
Put either lead in hot, the other in neutral. You should read 110
to 120 V AC.
2.
Put either lead in hot, the other in ground. You should read 110
to 120 V AC.
3.
Put either lead in neutral, the other in ground. You should read
0 V AC.
If any of these readings is different from what is described here, it’s
time to call an electrician.
The voltages supplied by
most PC power supplies can
safely vary by as much as ±10
percent of their stated values.

joules. Most authorities agree that your surge suppressor should rate at a
minimum of 800 joules—and the more joules, the better the protection. My
surge suppressor rates out at 1750 joules.
While you’re protecting your system, don’t forget that surges also
come from telephone and cable connections. If you use a modem, DSL, or
cable modem, make sure to get a surge suppressor that includes support
for these types of connections. Many manufacturers make surge
suppressors with telephone line protection (Figure 8.9).
No surge suppressor works forever. Make sure your surge suppressor
has a test/reset button so you’ll know when the device hasas we say in the
businessturned into an extension cord. If your system takes a hit and you
have a surge suppressor, call the company! Many companies provide cash
guarantees against system failure due to surges, but only if you follow their
guidelines.
If you want really great surge suppression, you need to move up to
power conditioning. Your power lines take in all kinds of strange signals that

Tech Tip
AC Adapters
Many devices in the computing
world use an AC adapter rather
than an internal power supply.
Even though it sits outside a de-
vice, an AC adapter converts AC
current to DC, just like a power
supply. Unlike power supplies,
AC adapters are rarely inter-
changeable. Although manufac-
turers of different devices often
use the same kind of plug on the
end of the AC adapter cable, these
adapters are not necessarily inter-
changeable. In other words, just
because you can plug an AC
adapter from your friend’s laptop
into your laptop does not mean
it’s going to work.
You need to make sure that
three things match before you
plug an AC adapter into a device:
voltage, amperage, and polarity.
If either the voltage or amperage
output is too low, the device
won’t run. If the polarity is re-
versed, it won’t work, just like
putting a battery in a flashlight
backward. If either the voltage or
amperage—especially the latter—
is too high, on the other hand,
you can very quickly toast your
device. Don’t do it! Always check
the voltage, amperage, and polar-
ity of a replacement AC adapter
before you plug it into a device.

have no business being in there, such as electromagnetic interference (EMI)
and radio frequency interference (RFI). Most of the time, this line noise is so
minimal it’s not worth addressing, but occasionally events (such as light-
ning) generate enough line noise to cause weird things to happen to your PC
(keyboard lockups, messed-up data). All better surge suppressors add
power conditioning to filter out EMI and RFI.
UPS
An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) protects your computer (and,
more importantly, your data) in the event of a power sag or power outage.
Figure 8.10 shows a typical UPS. A UPS essentially contains a big battery
that provides AC power to your computer regardless of the power coming
from the AC outlet.
All uninterruptible power supplies are measured in both watts (the true
amount of power they supply in the event of a power outage) and in volt-amps
(VA). Volt-amps is the amount of power the UPS could supply if the devices
took power from the UPS in a perfect way. Your UPS provides perfect AC
power, moving current smoothly back and forth 60 times a second. Power
supplies, monitors, and other devices, however, may not take all of the power
the UPS has to offer at every point as the AC power moves back and forth, re-
sulting in inefficiencies. If your devices took all of the power the UPS offered
at every point as the power moved back and forth, VA would equal watts.
If the UPS makers knew ahead of time exactly what devices you planned
to plug into their UPS, they could tell you the exact watts, but different de-
vices have different efficiencies, forcing the UPS makers to go by what they
can offer (VAs), not what your devices will take (watts). The watts value
they give is a guess, and it’s never as high as the VAs. The VA rating is al-
ways higher than the wattage rating.
Because you have no way to calculate the exact efficiency of every device
you’ll plug into the UPS, go with the wattage rating. You add up the total watt-
age of every component in your PC and buy a UPS with a higher wattage.
You’ll spend a lot of time and mental energy figuring precisely how much
wattage your computer, monitor, drives, and so on require to get the proper
UPS for your system. But you’re still not finished! Remember that the UPS is a
battery with a limited amount of power, so you then need to figure out how
long you want the UPS to run when you lose power.
The quicker and far better method to use for determining the UPS you
need is to go to any of the major surge suppressor/UPS makers’ Web sites
and use their handy power calculators. My personal favorite is on the

No surge suppressor in the
world can handle the ultimate

your PC goodbye if it was
plugged in at the time. Always

trical storms!
Tech Tip
UPS Technologies
There are two main types of UPS:
online, where devices are con-
stantly powered through the
UPS’s battery, and standby,
where devices connected to the
UPS only receive battery power
when the AC sags below ~80–90 V.
Another type of UPS is called
line-interactive, which is similar
to a standby UPS but has special

Supplying DC
After you’ve assured the supply of good AC electricity for the PC, the power
supply unit (PSU) takes over, converting high-voltage AC into several DC volt-
ages (notably, 5.0, 12.0, and 3.3 V) usable by the delicate interior components.
Power supplies come in a large number of shapes and sizes, but the most

Shopping for a UPS
When it comes to getting a UPS for yourself or a client, nothing quite
cuts through the hype and marketing terms like a trip to the local com-
puter store to see for yourself. You need excuses to go to the computer
store, so Try This!
1.
Go to your local computer store—or visit an online computer
site if no stores are nearby—and find out what’s available.
2.

an online and a standby UPS?

common size by far is the standard 150 mm × 140 mm × 86
mm desktop PSU shown in Figure 8.12.
The PC uses the 12.0-V current to power motors on de-
vices such as hard drives and CD-ROM drives, and it uses
the 5.0- and 3.3-V current for support of onboard electron-
ics. Manufacturers may use these voltages any way they
wish, however, and may deviate from these assumptions.
Power supplies also come with standard connectors for
the motherboard and interior devices.
Power to the Motherboard
Modern motherboards use a 20- or 24-pin P1 power con-
nector. Some motherboards may require special 4-, 6-, or
8-pin connectors to supply extra power (Figure 8.13).
We’ll talk about each of these connectors in the form
factor standards discussion later in this chapter.
Power to Peripherals: Molex, Mini, and SATA
Many devices inside the PC require power. These in-
clude hard drives, floppy drives, optical drives, Zip
drives (for techs who enjoy retro computing), and fans.
The typical PC power supply has up to three types of
connectors that plug into peripherals: Molex, mini, and
SATA.
Molex Connectors
The most common type of power
connection for devices that need 5 or 12 V of power is the
Molex connector (Figure 8.14). The Molex connector has
notches, called chamfers, that guide its installation. The
tricky part is that Molex connectors require a firm push to plug in properly,
and a strong person can defeat the chamfers, plugging a Molex in upside
down. Not a good thing. Always check for proper orientation before you
push it in!
Mini Connectors
All power supplies have a second type of connector,
called a mini connector (Figure 8.15), that supplies 5 and 12 V to peripher-
als, although only floppy disk drives in modern systems use this connec-
tor. Drive manufacturers adopted the mini as the standard connector on
3.5-inch floppy disk drives. Often these mini connectors are referred to as
floppy power connectors.

Molex connector

Be extra careful when plugging
in a mini connector! Whereas Molex
connectors are difficult to plug in
backward, you can insert a mini con-
nector incorrectly with very little ef-
fort. As with a Molex connector,
doing so will almost certainly de-
stroy the floppy drive. Figure 8.16
depicts a correctly oriented mini
connection, with the small ridge on
the connector away from the body of
the data socket.
SATA Power Connectors
Serial ATA
(SATA) hard drives need a special
15-pin
SATA
power
connector
(Figure 8.17). The larger pin count
supports the SATA hot-swappable
feature and 3.3-, 5.0-, and 12.0-V de-
vices. SATA power connectors are L
shaped, making it almost impossible
to insert one incorrectly into a SATA
drive. No other device on your com-
puter uses the SATA power connec-
tor. For more information about
SATA drives, see Chapter 9, “Hard
Drive Technologies.”
Splitters and Adapters
You may occasionally find yourself without
enough connectors to power all of the devices inside your PC. In this case,
you can purchase splitters to create more connections (Figure 8.18). You
might also run into the phenomenon of needing a SATA connector but
having only a spare Molex. Because the voltages on the wires are the same,
a simple adapter will take care of the problem nicely.
268
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
As with any power connector,
plugging a mini connector into a
device the wrong way will almost
certainly destroy the device.
Check twice before you plug
one in!
Try This!
Testing DC
A common practice for techs troubleshooting a system is to test the DC
voltages coming out of the power supply. Even with good AC, a bad
power supply can fail to transform AC to DC at voltages needed by the
motherboard and peripherals. So grab your trusty multimeter and Try
This! on a powered-up PC with the side cover removed. Note that you
must have P1 connected to the motherboard and the system must be
running (you don’t have to be in Windows, of course).
1.
Switch your multimeter to DC, somewhere around 20 V DC if you
need to make that choice. Make sure your leads are plugged into
the multimeter properly: red to hot, black to ground. The key to
testing DC is that which lead you touch to which wire matters.
Red goes to hot wires of all colors; black always goes to ground.
2.
Plug the red lead into the red wire socket of a free Molex
connector and plug the black lead into one of the two black wire
sockets. You should get a reading of ~5 V. What do you have?
3.
Now move the red lead to the yellow socket. What voltage do
you get?
4.
Testing the P1 connector is a little more complicated. You push
the red and black leads into the top of P1, sliding in alongside
the wires until you bottom out. Leave the black lead in one of the
black wire ground sockets. Move the red lead through all of the
colored wire sockets. What voltages do you find?

ATX
The original ATX power supplies had two distinguishing physical features:
the motherboard power connector and soft power. Motherboard power
came from a single cable with a 20-pin P1 motherboard power connector.
ATX power supplies also had at least two other cables, each populated with
two or more Molex or mini connectors for peripheral power.
When plugged in, ATX systems have 5 V running to the motherboard.
They’re always “on,” even when powered down. The power switch you
press to power up the PC isn’t a true power switch like the light switch on
the wall in your bedroom. The power switch on an ATX system simply tells
the computer whether it has been pressed. The BIOS or operating system
takes over from there and handles the chore of turning the PC on or off. This
is called soft power.
Using soft power instead of a physical switch has a number of important
benefits. Soft power prevents a user from turning off a system before the op-
erating system has been shut down. It enables the PC to use power-saving
modes that put the system to sleep and then wake it up when you press a
key, move a mouse, or receive an e-mail. (See Chapter 14, “Learning Porta-
ble Computing,” for more details on sleep mode.)
All of the most important settings for ATX soft power reside in CMOS
setup. Boot into CMOS and look for a Power Management section. Take a
look at the Power On Function option in Figure 8.19. This determines the
function of the on/off switch. You may set this switch to turn off the com-
puter, or you may set it to the more common 4-second delay.
ATX did a great job supplying power for more than a decade, but over
time more powerful CPUs, multiple CPUs, video cards, and other compo-
nents began to need more current than the original ATX provided. This mo-
tivated the industry to introduce a number of updates to the ATX power
standards: ATX12V 1.3, EPS12V, multiple rails, ATX12V 2.0, other form fac-
tors, and active PFC.
ATX12V 1.3
The first widespread update to the ATX standard, ATX12V
1.3, came out in 2003. This introduced a 4-pin motherboard power connec-
tor, unofficially but commonly called the P4, that provided more 12-V
power to assist the 20-pin P1 motherboard power connector. Any power
supply that provides a P4 connector is called an ATX12V power supply. The
term “ATX” was dropped from the ATX power standard, so if you want
to get really nerdy you can sayaccuratelythat there’s no such thing as
an ATX power supply. All power suppliesassuming they have a P4
connectorare ATX12V or one of the later standards.
The ATX12V 1.3 standard also introduced a 6-pin auxiliary connector—
commonly called an AUX connector—to supply increased 3.3- and 5.0-V
current to the motherboard (Figure 8.20). This connector was based on the
motherboard power connector from the precursor of ATX, called AT.
The introduction of these two extra power connectors caused the indus-
try some teething problems. In particular, motherboards using AMD CPUs
tended to need the AUX connector, while motherboards using Intel CPUs
needed only the P4. As a result, many power supplies came with only a P4
or only an AUX connector to save money. A few motherboard makers
skipped adding either connector and used a standard Molex connector so

people with older power supplies
wouldn’t have to upgrade just be-
cause they bought a new mother-
board (Figure 8.21).
The
biggest
problem
with
ATX12V was its lack of teethit
made a lot of recommendations
but few requirements, giving PSU
makers too much choice (such as
choosing or not choosing to add
AUX and P4 connectors), which
wasn’t fixed until later versions.

Cross Check
ATX Form Factor
The power supply form factor alone does not define a system as ATX or
one of the later varieties; you have to discuss the motherboard as well.
Flip back to Chapter 7, “Learning Motherboards,” and see if you can put
the full picture of the ATX standard together. What defines a system as
ATX? What improvements did ATX incorporate over AT? What ATX
form factors can you purchase?

EPS12V
Server motherboards are thirsty for power, and sometimes
ATX12V 1.3 just didn’t cut it. An industry group called the Server System In-
frastructure (SSI) developed a non-ATX standard motherboard and power
supply called EPS12V. An EPS12V power supply came with a 24-pin main
motherboard power connector that resembled a 20-pin ATX connector, but
it offered more current and thus more stability for motherboards. It also
came with an AUX connector, an ATX12V P4 connector, and a unique 8-pin
connector. That’s a lot of connectors! EPS12V power supplies were not inter-
changeable with ATX12V power supplies.
EPS12V may not have seen much life beyond servers, but it introduced a
number of power features, some of which eventually became part of the
ATX12V standard. The most important issue was something called rails.
Rails
Generally, all of the PC’s power comes from a single transformer
that takes the AC current from a wall socket and converts it into DC current
that is split into three primary DC voltage rails: 12.0 V, 5.0 V, and 3.3 V. Indi-
vidual lines run from each of these voltage rails to the various connectors.
That means the 12-V connector on a P4 draws from the same rail as the main
12-V connector feeding power to the motherboard. This works fine as long
as the collective needs of the connectors sharing a rail don’t exceed its capac-
ity to feed them power. To avoid this, EPS12V divided the 12-V
supply into two or three separate 12-V rails, each one providing a
separate source of power.
ATX12V 2.0
The ATX12V 2.0 standard incorporated many of
the good ideas of EPS12V into the ATX world, starting with the
24-pin connector. This 24-pin motherboard power connector is
backward compatible with the older 20-pin connector, so users
don’t have to buy a new motherboard if they use an ATX12V 2.0
power supply. ATX12V 2.0 requires two 12-V rails for any power
supply rated higher than 230 W. ATX12V 2.0 dropped the AUX
connector and required SATA hard drive connectors.
In theory, a 20-pin motherboard power supply connector will
work on a motherboard with a 24-pin socket, but doing this is risky
in that the 20-pin connector may not provide enough power to your
system. Try to use the right power supply for your motherboard to
avoid problems. Many ATX12V 2.0 power supplies have a convert-
ible 24-to-20-pin converter. These are handy if you want to make a nice “clean”
connection, because many 20-pin connectors have capacitors that prevent
plugging in a 24-pin connector. You’ll also see the occasional 24-pin connector
constructed in such a way that you can slide off the extra four pins. Figure 8.22
shows 20-pin and 24-pin connectors; Figure 8.23 shows a convertible connec-
tor. Although they look similar, those extra four pins won’t replace the P4 con-
nector. They are incompatible!
Many modern ATX motherboards feature an 8-pin CPU power connector
like the one found in the EPS12V standard to help support high-end CPUs
that demand a lot of power. This connector is referred to by several names, in-
cluding EPS12V, EATX12V, and ATX12V 2x4. One half of this connector will
be pin compatible with the P4 power connector and the other half may be un-
der a protective cap. Be sure to check the motherboard installation manuals
for recommendations on if and when you need to use the full 8 pins. For back-
ward compatibility, some power supplies provide an 8-pin power connector
that can split into two 4-pin sets, one of which is the P4 connector.
Chapter 8: Learning PC Power
271

20- and 24-pin connectors
• Figure 8.23

power connector

Another notable connector is the auxiliary PCI Express (PCIe)
power connector. Figure 8.24 shows the 6-pin PCIe power connector.
Some motherboards add a Molex socket for PCIe, and some cards
come with a Molex socket as well. Higher-end cards have a dedicated
6-pin or 8-pin PCIe power connector. The 8-pin PCIe connector should
not be confused with the EPS12V connector, as they are not compati-
ble. Some PCIe devices with the 8-pin connector will accept a 6-pin
PCIe power connection instead, but this may put limits on their perfor-
mance. Often you’ll find that 8-pin PCIe power cables have two pins at
the end that you can detach for easy compatibility with 6-pin devices.
Niche-Market Power Supply Form Factors
The demand for smaller and
quieter PCs and, to a lesser extent, the emergence of the BTX form factor
have led to the development of a number of niche-market power supply
form factors. All use standard ATX connectors but differ in size and shape
from standard ATX power supplies.
Here are some of the more common specialty power supply types:

Active PFC
Visualize the AC current coming from the power company as
water in a pipe, smoothly moving back and forth, 60 times a second. A PC’s
power supply, simply due to the process of changing this AC current into
DC current, is like a person sucking on a straw on the end of this pipe. It
takes gulps only when the current is fully pushing or pulling at the top and

You’ll commonly find niche-
market power supplies bundled
with computer cases (and often
motherboards as well). These
form factors are rarely sold
alone.

bottom of each cycle and creating an electrical phenomenasort of a back
pressurethat’s called harmonics in the power industry. These harmonics
create the humming sound you hear from electrical components. Over time,
harmonics damage electrical equipment, causing serious problems with the
power supply and other electrical devices on the circuit. Once you put a few
thousand PCs with power supplies in the same local area, harmonics can
even damage the electrical power supplier’s equipment!
Good PC power supplies come with active power factor correction (ac-
tive PFC), extra circuitry that smoothes out the way the power supply takes
power from the power company and eliminates harmonics. Never buy a
power supply that does not have active PFCall power supplies with active
PFC proudly show you on the box (Figure 8.26).
Chapter 8: Learning PC Power

Power supply advertising active PFC

Wattage Requirements
Every device in a PC requires a certain amount of wattage to function. A
typical hard drive draws 15 W of power when accessed, for example,
whereas some Athlon 64 X2 CPUs draw a whopping 110 W at peak usage—
with average usage around 70 W. The total wattage of all devices combined
is the minimum you need the power supply to provide.
If the power supply cannot produce the wattage a system needs, that PC
won’t work properly. Because most devices in the PC require maximum
wattage when first starting, the most common result of insufficient wattage
is a paperweight that looks like a PC. This can lead to some embarrassing
moments. You might plug in a new hard drive for a client, push the power
button on the case, and nothing happens—a dead PC! Eek! There are other
ways this problem can manifest itself, however (system lock-ups, random
restarts, etc.), so diagnosing an inadequate or dying power supply can be
tricky.
You can quickly determine if insufficient wattage is the problem. Un-
plug the drive and power up the system. If the system boots up, the power
supply is a likely suspect. The only fix for this problem is to replace the
power supply with one that provides more wattage (or leave the new drive
out—a less-than-ideal solution).
No power supply can turn 100 percent of the AC power coming from the
power company into DC current, so all power supplies provide less power
to the system than the wattage advertised on the box. ATX12V 2.0 standards
require a power supply to be at least 70 percent efficient, but you can find
power supplies with better than 80 percent efficiency. More efficiency can
tell you how many watts the system puts out to the PC in actual use. Plus,
the added efficiency means the power supply uses less power, saving you
money.
One common argument these days is that people buy power supplies
that provide far more wattage than a system needs and therefore waste
power. This is untrue. A power supply provides only the amount of power
your system needs. If you put a 1000-W power supply (yes, they really exist)
into a system that needs only 250 W, that big power supply will put out only
250 W to the system. So buying an efficient, higher-wattage power supply
gives you two benefits. First, running a power supply at less than 100 percent
load lets it live longer. Second, you’ll have plenty of extra power when adding
new components.
As a general recommendation for a new system, use at least a 500-W
power supply. This is a common wattage and gives you plenty of extra
power for booting as well as for whatever other components you might add
to the system in the future.

Tech Tip
Build in Aging
Don’t cut the specifications too
tightly for power supplies. All
power supplies produce less watt-
age over time, simply because of
wear and tear on the internal
components. If you build a sys-
tem that runs with only a few
watts of extra power available
from the power supply initially,
that system will most likely start
causing problems within a year
or less. Do yourself or your cli-
ents a favor and get a power sup-
ply that has more wattage than
you need.
The CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam does not require you to
figure precise wattage needs for
a particular system. When build-
ing a PC for a client, however,
you do need to know this stuff!

Chapter 8 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about power supplies.
Explain the basics of electricity
■
The power supply takes electricity from the wall
outlet and transforms it into the kind of electricity
that the motherboard and other internal components
use. To remove the power supply, unscrew the
four screws in the back of the case and lift it out.
Installing it is just as simple. Be careful never to
open the power supply itself, as the capacitors
inside can store a dangerous electrical charge.
■
Techs need to know basic principles of electricity
and how to recognize power problems. Electricity
is a flow of negatively charged particles or electrons
through matter. Metallic wire is a good conductor,
allowing electrons to move freely. The pressure of
the electrons in the wire is called voltage and is
measured in volts (V). Measured in units called
amperes (amps or A), current or amperage is the
amount of electrons flowing past a certain point on
a wire. Wattage (watts or W) refers to the amount
of amps and volts a particular device needs. The
formula VA = W expresses the correlation among
the three. Resistance to the flow of electrons is
measured in ohms. Fuses and ground wires set limits
for the flow of electrons. A ground wire provides a
path of least resistance to allow the electrons to flow
to the ground.
■
Electricity may be either direct current (DC), with
electrons flowing in one direction around a continuous
circuit, or alternating current (AC), with electrons
flowing back and forth in a circuit.
Describe the details about powering the PC
■
Because power companies supply high-voltage
AC, the computer’s power supply converts AC to
low-voltage DC that is then portioned out to the
internal devices. Heat is a byproduct of electricity
and must be controlled in the computer.
■
The power supply connects to the electrical outlet
via a standard IEC-320 connector. Although power
in the United States ranges from 110 to 120 V,
the rest of the world uses 200 to 240 VAC. Most
power supplies can switch between 110 and 220 V.
The IEC-320 plug has three holes, called hot, neutral,
and ground. The hot carries electrical voltage and
should output approximately 115 V in the United
States. The neutral returns electricity to the breaker
panel and should have 0 V output. The ground
wire returns excess electricity to the ground and
should also have a 0 V output. You can use a
multimeter to test voltages at the outlet.
■
A multimeter, also called a volt-ohm meter
(VOM), uses two probes to provide at least four
measurements: AC voltage (V~), DC voltage (V
with a solid line above a dashed line), continuity
(whether electrons flow from one end of a wire to
the other end), and resistance (whether a fuse is
good or blown or whether a wire has breaks).
Some AC-only testing devices are available that
simply plug into the AC outlet and may display
results via three light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
■
A surge suppressor is an inexpensive device that
protects your computer from voltage spikes.
Inserted between the wall outlet and the power
supply, a surge suppressor has a joule rating that
measures how much electrical energy it can
suppress. Be sure your surge suppressor has at
least an 800 joules rating. Because telephone lines
and cable connections also produce spikes, your
surge suppressor should include connections for a
modem, DSL, or cable modem. Make sure you
purchase a surge suppressor that has the UL 1449
for 330-V rating, as this will ensure substantial
protection for your system. Because surge suppressors
work for only a limited time, you should check the
manufacturer’s recommended replacement schedules.
If your surge suppressor comes with a cash guarantee,
be aware that manufacturers honor it only if you
follow their guidelines.
■
Because the AC supply lacks consistency and
actually provides power with sags and spikes, it is
important that you use two devices with the
computer: an uninterruptible power supply and a
surge suppressor. An uninterruptible power
supply (UPS) continues to supply AC power to
your computer during both brownouts and
Chapter 8: Learning PC Power
275

blackouts via a battery that is charged from the AC
current. All UPSs measure the amount of power or
watts they supply, as well as listing the number of
minutes the UPS will last with a certain voltage.
You should cut the number of minutes in half for a
truer estimate of the abilities of the UPS. The power
supply converts AC into several DC voltages (5.0,
12.0, and 3.3 V). Devices such as hard drives and
CD-ROM drives require 12.0 V and onboard
electronics use 3.3- and 5.0-V currents.
■
The power supply has several standard connectors
for the motherboard and interior devices. Today’s
motherboards have a P1 socket that uses the P1
connector from the power supply. A standard ATX
power supply has a 20-pin P1 connector, while the
newer ATX12V 2.0 power supplies come with a
24-pin P1 connector. Some motherboards also need
a 4-, 6-, or 8-pin connector to provide an additional
12 V of power.
■
Peripherals use two or possibly three different
kinds of connectors: the larger Molex connector,
the smaller mini connector, and the SATA
connector. Used with hard drives and CD- and
DVD-media drives, the Molex has chamfers to
ensure that it is connected properly. Used today
only for floppy drives, the mini connector can
easily be inserted incorrectly, thus destroying the
floppy drive. The SATA connector is used for
SATA hard drives. If you do not have enough
connectors for all of the devices inside your PC,
you can create more connections with a splitter.
Similarly, if your power supply does not have the
connector a device needs, you can purchase
adapters to convert one type to another.
■
The ATX power supply includes full support for
power-saving functions, with the modem or
network interface card able to wake up the PC
when there is incoming traffic. Using the soft
power feature, the ATX power supply puts a 5-V
charge on the motherboard as long as there is AC
from the wall socket. You can configure the ATX
soft power through the Power Management section
of the CMOS setup. Always unplug an ATX system
before you work on it. ATX power supplies use a
single P1 connector for motherboard power.
■
The ATX standard has undergone several updates.
ATX12V 1.3 introduced additional 4-pin (P4) and
6-pin auxiliary (AUX) connectors. ATX12V 2.0
introduced the 24-pin connector (inspired by
EPS12V), dropped the AUX connector, and
required SATA connectors. Additionally, ATX12V
2.0 required two 12-V rails for any power supply
larger than 230 W.
■
The non-ATX standard EPS12V introduced a 24-
pin motherboard connector and a unique 8-pin
connector. It was not swappable with ATX power
supplies, and while its popularity was short-lived,
it introduced several features that became part of
the ATX12V standard, including rails.
■
The demand for smaller and quieter PCs and the
introduction of the BTX motherboard form factors
led to the development of niche-market power
supply form factors. TFX12V, SFX12V, CFX12V,
and LFX12V have the same connectors as standard
ATX power supplies but differ in size or shape.
■
Active power factor correction (active PFC) helps
to eliminate harmonics, which can damage
electrical components. Never buy a power supply
that does not have active PFC.
■
Power supplies are rated in watts. If you know the
amount of wattage that every device in the PC needs,
you can arrive at the total wattage required for all
devices, and that is the minimum wattage your
power supply should provide. If the power supply
does not provide sufficient wattage, the computer
will not work. For a new computer system, you
should select at least a 500-W power supply to have
extra power for adding components in the future.
■
Because converting from AC to DC may result in a
significant loss of wattage, purchase a power
supply that offers a high percentage of efficiency.
The ATX12V 2.0 standard requires a power supply
to be at least 70 percent efficient, but you can find
power supplies with better then 80 percent
efficiency. Be aware that power supplies produce
less wattage over time, so don’t cut the wattage
specification too tightly. While power supplies
range from 200 to 600 W, you should know that the
more AC the power supply draws, the more heat it
produces.

O
f all the hardware on a PC, none gets more attention—or gives more
anguish—than the hard drive. There’s a good reason for this: if the hard
drive breaks, you lose data. As you probably know, when the data goes, you
have to redo work or restore from backup—or worse. It’s good to worry about
the data, because the data runs the office, maintains the payrolls, and stores the
e-mail. This level of concern is so strong that even the most neophyte PC users
are exposed to terms such as IDE, PATA, SATA, and controller—even if they
don’t put the terms into practice.
This chapter focuses on how hard drives work, beginning with the internal
layout and organization of hard drives. You’ll look at the different types of hard
drives used today (PATA, SATA, SSD, and SCSI) and how they interface with
the PC. The chapter also covers how more than one drive may work with other
drives to provide data safety and improve speed through a feature called RAID.
Let’s get started.

Historical/Conceptual
■How Hard Drives Work
Hard drives sport one of two technologies today. The most common type
has moving parts; the newer and more expensive technology has none. Let’s
look at both.
Platter-Based Hard Drives
A traditional hard disk drive (HDD) is composed of indi-
vidual disks, or platters, with read/write heads on actua-
tor arms controlled by a servo motor—all contained in a
sealed case that prevents contamination by outside air
(Figure 9.1).
The aluminum platters are coated with a magnetic
medium. Two tiny read/write heads service each plat-
ter, one to read the top and the other to read the bottom
of the platter (Figure 9.2).
The coating on the platters is phenomenally smooth.
It has to be, as the read/write heads actually float on a
cushion of air above the platters, which spin at speeds
between 3500 and 10,000 rpm. The distance (flying
height) between the heads and the disk surface is less
than the thickness of a fingerprint. The closer the read/
write heads are to the platter, the more densely the data
packs onto the drive. These infinitesimal tolerances de-
mand that the platters never be exposed to outside air.
Even a tiny dust particle on a platter would act like a
mountain in the way of the read/write heads and would
cause catastrophic damage to the drive. To keep the air
clean inside the drive, all hard drives use a tiny, heavily
filtered aperture to keep the air pressure equalized be-
tween the interior and the exterior of the drive.
Data Encoding
Although the hard drive stores data in binary form, visualizing
a magnetized spot representing a one and a non-magnetized
spot representing a zero grossly oversimplifies the process.
Hard drives store data in tiny magnetic fields—think of them as
tiny magnets that can be placed in either direction on the
platter. Each tiny magnetic field, called a flux, can switch north/
south polarity back and forth through a process called flux re-
versal. When a read/write head goes over an area where a flux
reversal has occurred, the head reads a small electrical current.
Today’s hard drives use a complex and efficient method to
interpret flux reversals. Instead of reading individual flux re-
versals, a modern hard drive reads groups of them called runs.
Chapter 9: Hard Drive Technologies
281

Read/write heads on actuator arms

Starting around 1991, hard drives began using a data encoding system
known as run length limited (RLL). With RLL, any combination of ones and
zeros can be stored in a preset combination of about 15 different runs. The
hard drive looks for these runs and reads them as a group, resulting in much
faster and much more densely packed data.
Current drives use an extremely advanced method of RLL called Partial
Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) encoding. As hard drives pack more
and more fluxes on the drive, the individual fluxes start to interact with each
other, making it more and more difficult for the drive to verify where one
flux stops and another starts. PRML uses powerful, intelligent circuitry to
analyze each flux reversal and to make a “best guess” as to what type of flux
reversal it just read. As a result, the maximum run length for PRML drives
reaches up to 16 to 20 fluxes, far more than the 7 or so on RLL drives. Longer
run lengths enable the hard drive to use more complicated run combina-
tions so the hard drive can store a phenomenal amount of data. For example,
a run of only 12 fluxes on a hard drive might equal a string of 30 or 40 ones
and zeros when handed to the system from the hard drive.
The size required by each magnetic flux on a hard drive has reduced
considerably over the years, resulting in higher capacities. As fluxes become
smaller, they begin to interfere with each other in weird ways. I have to say
weird because to make sense of what’s going on at this subatomic level (I told
you these fluxes were small!) would require you to take a semester of quan-
tum mechanics. Let’s just say that laying fluxes flat against the platter has
reached its limit. To get around this problem, hard drive makers recently be-
gan to make hard drives that store their fluxes vertically (up and down)
rather than longitudinally (forward and backward), enabling them to make
hard drives in the 1 terabyte (1024 gigabyte) range. Manufacturers call this
vertical storage method perpendicular recording.
For all this discussion and detail on data encoding, the day-to-day PC
technician never deals with encoding. Sometimes, however, knowing what
you don’t need to know helps as much as knowing what you do need to
know. Fortunately, data encoding is inherent to the hard drive and com-
pletely invisible to the system. You’re never going to have to deal with data
encoding, but you’ll sure sound smart when talking to other PC techs if you
know your RLL from your PRML!
Moving the Arms
The read/write heads move across the platter on the ends of actuator arms or
head actuators. In the entire history of hard drives, manufacturers have used
only two technologies to move the arms: stepper motor and voice coil. Hard
drives first used stepper motor technology, but today they’ve all moved to
voice coil.
Stepper motor technology moved the arm in fixed increments or steps,
but the technology had several limitations that doomed it. Because the inter-
face between motor and actuator arm required minimal slippage to ensure
precise and reproducible movements, the positioning of the arms became
less precise over time. This physical deterioration caused data transfer er-
rors. Additionally, heat deformation wreaked havoc with stepper motor
drives. Just as valve clearances in automobile engines change with operat-
ing temperature, the positioning accuracy changed as the PC operated and
various hard drive components got warmer. Although very small, these
282
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Floppy disk drives still use
stepper motors.

changes caused problems. Accessing the data written on a cold hard drive,
for example, became difficult after the disk warmed. In addition, the read/
write heads could damage the disk surface if not parked (set in a non-data
area) when not in use, requiring techs to use special parking programs be-
fore transporting a stepper motor drive.
All magnetic hard drives made today employ a linear motor to move the
actuator arms. The linear motor, more popularly called a voice coil motor,
uses a permanent magnet surrounding a coil on the actuator arm. When an
electrical current passes, the coil generates a magnetic field that moves the
actuator arm. The direction of the actuator arm’s movement depends on the
polarity of the electrical current through the coil. Because the voice coil and
the actuator arm never touch, no degradation in positional accuracy takes
place over time. Voice coil drives automatically park the heads when the
drive loses power, making the old stepper motor park programs obsolete.
Lacking the discrete steps of the stepper motor drive, a voice coil drive
cannot accurately predict the movement of the heads across the disk. To
make sure voice coil drives land exactly in the correct area, the drive re-
serves one side of one platter for navigational purposes. This area essen-
tially maps the exact location of the data on the drive. The voice coil moves
the read/write head to its best guess about the correct position on the hard
drive. The read/write head then uses this map to fine-tune its true position
and make any necessary adjustments.
Now that you have a basic understanding of how a drive physically
stores data, let’s turn to how the hard drive organizes that data so we can
use that drive.
Geometry
Have you ever seen a cassette tape? If you look at the actual brown Mylar
(a type of plastic) tape, nothing will tell you whether sound is recorded on
that tape. Assuming the tape is not blank, however, you know something is
on the tape. Cassettes store music in distinct magnetized lines. You could
say that the physical placement of those lines of magnetism is the tape’s
“geometry.”
Geometry also determines where a hard drive stores data. As with a cas-
sette tape, if you opened up a hard drive, you would not see the geometry.
But rest assured that the drive has geometry; in fact, every model of hard
drive uses a different geometry. We describe the geometry for a particular
hard drive with a set of numbers representing three values: heads, cylin-
ders, and sectors per track.
Heads
The number of heads for a specific hard drive describes, rather log-
ically, the number of read/write heads used by the drive to store data. Every
platter requires two heads. If a hard drive has four platters, for example, it
needs eight heads (Figure 9.3).
Based on this description of heads, you would think that hard drives
would always have an even number of heads, right? Wrong! Most hard
drives reserve a head or two for their own use. Therefore, a hard drive can
have either an even or an odd number of heads.
Cylinders
To visualize cylinders, imagine taking an empty soup can and
opening both ends. Look at the shape of the can; it is a geometric shape
called a cylinder. Now imagine taking that cylinder and sharpening one end

Tech Tip
Fluid Bearings
Currently, almost all hard drives
(except solid state) use a motor lo-
cated in the center spindle sup-
porting the drive platters.
Traditionally, tiny ball bearings
support the spindle motor, and as
disk technology has advanced,
these ball bearings have become
the limiting factor in the three
critical design criteria for hard
drives: rotational speed, storage
capacity, and noise levels. The
higher the rotational speed of a
drive, the more the metal-on-metal
contact creates heat and lubricant
problems that impact the lifespan
of the bearings. However precisely
machined, ball bearings are not
perfectly round. Runout, the mea-
surement of how much the ball
bearings wobble (and thus how
much the drive platters wobble), is
now the limiting factor on how
densely you can pack information
together on a disk drive.
The technological fix for this
comes in the form of fluid bear-
ings. A fluid bearing is basically a
small amount of lubricant trapped
in a carefully machined housing.
The use of fluid in place of metal
balls means that no contact occurs
between metal surfaces to generate
heat and wear. The fluid also cre-
ates no mechanical vibration, so
fluid bearings can support higher
rotational speeds. The runout of a
fluid bearing is about one-tenth
that of the best ball bearing, signif-
icantly increasing potential infor-
mation density. The absence of a
mechanical connection between
moving parts also dramatically
reduces noise levels, and the fluid
itself acts to dampen the sound
further. Finally, liquid bearings
provide better shock resistance
than ball bearings.

so that it easily cuts through the hardest metal. Visualize placing
the ex-soup can over the hard drive and pushing it down
through the drive. The can cuts into one side and out the other of
each platter. Each circle transcribed by the can is where you store
data on the drive, and is called a track.
Each side of each platter contains tens of thousands of tracks.
Interestingly enough, the individual tracks themselves are not
directly part of the drive geometry. Our interest lies only in the
groups of tracks of the same diameter, going all of the way
through the drive. Each group of tracks of the same diameter is
called a cylinder (Figure 9.4). There’s more than one cylinder. Go
get yourself about a thousand more cans, each one a different di-
ameter, and push them through the hard drive.
Sectors per Track
Now imagine cutting the hard drive like a
birthday cake, slicing all of the tracks into tens of thousands of
small slivers. Each sliver then has many thousands of small
pieces of track. The term sector refers to a specific piece of track
on a sliver, and each sector stores 512 bytes of data.
The sector is the universal atom of all hard drives. You can’t
divide data into anything smaller than a sector. Although sectors
are important, the number of sectors is not a geometry value that
describes a hard drive. The geometry value is called sectors per
track (sectors/track). The sectors/track value describes the num-
ber of sectors in each track (Figure 9.5).
The Big Three
Cylinders, heads, and sectors/track combine to
define the hard drive’s geometry. In most cases, these three criti-
cal values are referred to as CHS. The three values are important
because the PC’s BIOS needs to know the drive’s geometry to
know how to talk to the drive. Back in the old days, a technician
needed to enter these values into the CMOS setup program man-
ually. Today, every hard drive stores the CHS information in the
drive itself, in an electronic format that enables the BIOS to query
the drive automatically to determine these values.
Two other values—write precompensation cylinder and landing zone—
no longer have relevance in today’s PCs; however, people still toss around
these terms and a few CMOS setup utilities still support them—another
classic example of a technology appendix. Let’s look at these two holdouts
from another era so when you access CMOS, you won’t say, “What the heck
are these?”

Sectors per track

Write Precompensation Cylinder
Older hard drives had a real problem
with the fact that sectors toward the inside of the drives were much smaller
than sectors toward the outside. To handle this, an older drive would spread
data a little farther apart once it got to a particular cylinder. This cylinder
was called the write precompensation (write precomp) cylinder, and the PC
had to know which cylinder began this wider data spacing. Hard drives no
longer have this problem, making the write precomp setting obsolete.
Landing Zone
On older hard drives with stepper motors, the landing zone
value designated an unused cylinder as a “parking place” for the read/
write heads. As mentioned earlier, before moving old stepper motor hard
drives, the read/write heads needed to be parked to avoid accidental dam-
age. Today’s voice coil drives park themselves whenever they’re not access-
ing data, automatically placing the read/write heads on the landing zone.
As a result, the BIOS no longer needs the landing zone geometry.
Solid-State Drives
Booting up a computer takes time in part because of the time it takes for
a traditional hard drive to spin up and for the read/write heads to re-
trieve the data off the drive to load the operating system and drivers into
RAM. All of the moving metal parts of a platter-based drive use a lot of
power, create a lot of heat, take up space, wear down over time, and take
a lot of nanoseconds to get things done. A solid-state drive (SSD) ad-
dresses all of these issues nicely.
In technical terms, solid-state technology and devices are based on
the combination of semiconductors, transistors, and bubble memory
used to create electrical components with no moving parts. That’s a
mouthful! Here’s the translation.
In simple terms, SSDs (Figure 9.6) use memory chips to store data
instead of all those pesky metal spinning parts used in platter-based
hard drives. Solid-state technology has been around for many moons.
It was originally developed to transition vacuum tube–based technol-
ogies to semiconductor technologies, such as the move from cathode
ray tubes (CRTs) to liquid crystal displays (LCDs) in monitors. (You’ll
get the scoop on monitor technologies in Chapter 13, “Learning Video
and Multimedia.”)
Solid-state devices use current flow and negative/positive electron
charges to achieve their magic. Although Mr. Spock may find the physics of
how this technology actually works “fascinating,” it’s more important for
you to know the following points regarding solid-state drives, devices, and
technology:
■
Solid-state technology is commonly used in desktop and laptop hard
drives, memory cards, cameras, USB thumb drives, and other
handheld devices.
■
SSD form factors are typically 1.8-inch, 2.5-inch, or 3.5-inch.
■
SSDs can be PATA, SATA, eSATA, SCSI, or USB for desktop
systems. Some portable computers have mini-PCI Express versions.
Chapter 9: Hard Drive Technologies
285
The A+ Essentials exam ex-
pects you to know how to com-
pletely remove data from a hard
drive. If you simply format the
drive, the information on it can
still be recovered. However, if
you physically destroy the plat-
ters or run a powerful magnet
over the drive, the data is de-
leted forever. You would want to
do this when disposing of or re-
cycling an old hard drive.
• Figure 9.6

of Corsair)
With solid-state drives com-
ing into more regular use, you
see the initials HDD used more
frequently than in previous
years to refer to the traditional,
platter-based hard drives. Thus
we have two drive technologies:
SSDs and HDDs.

■
SSDs that use SDRAM cache are volatile and lose data when
powered off. Others that use nonvolatile flash memory such as
NAND retain data when power is turned off or disconnected. (See
Chapter 10, “Removable Media,” for the scoop on flash memory
technology.)
■
SSDs are more expensive than traditional HDDs. Less expensive
SSDs typically implement less reliable multi-level cell (MLC)
memory technology in place of the more efficient single-level cell
(SLC) technology to cut costs.
■Parallel and Serial ATA
Over the years, many interfaces existed for hard drives, with such names as
ST-506 and ESDI. Don’t worry about what these abbreviations stood for;
neither the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam nor the computer world at large
has an interest in these prehistoric interfaces. Starting around 1990, an inter-
face called Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) appeared that now vir-
tually monopolizes the hard drive market. ATA hard drives are often
referred to as Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) drives. Only one other type
of interface, the moderately popular small computer system interface
(SCSI), has any relevance for hard drives.
ATA drives come in two basic flavors. The older parallel ATA (PATA)
drives send data in parallel, on a 40- or 80-wire data cable. PATA drives domi-
nated the industry for more than a decade but have been mostly replaced by
serial ATA (SATA) drives that send data in serial, using only one wire for data
transfers. The leap from PATA to SATA is only one of a large number of
changes that have taken place with ATA. To appreciate these changes, we’ll
run through the many ATA standards forwarded over the years.
ATA-1
When IBM unveiled the 80286-powered IBM PC AT in the early 1980s, it in-
troduced the first PC to include BIOS support for hard drives. This BIOS sup-
ported up to two physical drives, and each drive could be up to 504 MB—far
larger than the 5-MB and 10-MB drives of the time. Although having built-in
support for hard drives certainly improved the power of the PC, installing,
configuring, and troubleshooting hard drives could at best be called diffi-
cult at that time.
To address these problems, Western Digital and Compaq developed a
new hard drive interface and placed this specification before the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) committees, which in turn put out the AT
Attachment (ATA) interface in March of 1989. The ATA interface specified a
cable and a built-in controller on the drive itself. Most importantly, the ATA
standard used the existing AT BIOS on a PC, which meant that you didn’t
have to replace the old system BIOS to make the drive work—a very impor-
tant consideration for compatibility but one that would later haunt ATA
drives. The official name for the standard, ATA, never made it into the com-
mon vernacular until recently, and then only as PATA to distinguish it from
SATA drives.

Tech Tip
IDE
The term IDE (Integrated Drive
Electronics) refers to any hard
drive with a built-in controller.
All hard drives are technically
IDE drives, although we only use
the term IDE when discussing
ATA drives.
Tech Tip
External Hard Drives
A quick trip to any major com-
puter store will reveal a thriving
trade in external hard drives. You
used to be able to find external
drives that connected to the slow
parallel port, but external drives
today connect to a FireWire, Hi-
Speed USB 2.0, or eSATA port.
All three interfaces offer high data
transfer rates and hot-swap capa-
bility, making them ideal for
transporting huge files such as
digital video clips. Regardless of
the external interface, however, in-
side the casing you’ll find an ordi-
nary PATA or SATA drive, just
like those described in this chapter.
The ANSI subcommittee di-
rectly responsible for the ATA
standard is called Technical
Committee T13. If you want to
know what’s happening with
ATA, check out the T13 Web site:
www.t13.org.

Early ATA Physical Connections
The first ATA drives connected to the computer with a 40-pin
ribbon cable that plugged into the drive and into a hard drive
controller. The cable has a colored stripe down one side that
denotes pin 1 and should connect to the drive’s pin 1 and to
the controller’s pin 1. Figure 9.7 shows the business end of an
early ATA drive, with the connectors for the ribbon cable and
the power cable.
The controller is the support circuitry that acts as the inter-
mediary between the hard drive and the external data bus.
Electronically, the setup looks like Figure 9.8.
Wait a minute! If ATA drives are IDE (see the earlier
“IDE” Tech Tip), they already have a built-in controller.
Why do they then have to plug into a controller on the
motherboard? Well, this is a great example of a term that’s
not used properly, but everyone (including the mother-
board and hard drive makers) uses it this way. What we
call the ATA controller is really no more than an interface
providing a connection to the rest of the PC system. When
your BIOS talks to the hard drive, it actually talks to the
onboard circuitry on the drive, not the connection on the
motherboard. But, even though the real controller resides
on the hard drive, the 40-pin connection on the mother-
board is called the controller. We have a lot of misnomers
to live with in the ATA world.
The ATA-1 standard defined that no more than two drives
attach to a single IDE connector on a single ribbon cable. Be-
cause up to two drives can attach to one connector via a single
cable, you need to be able to identify each drive on the cable.
The ATA standard identifies the two drives as “master” and
“slave.” You set one drive as master and one as slave by using
tiny jumpers on the drives (Figure 9.9).
The controllers are on the motherboard and manifest
themselves as two 40-pin male ports, as shown in Figure 9.10.
PIO and DMA Modes
If you’re making a hard drive standard, you must define both
the method and the speed at which the data’s going to move.

ATA-1 defined two methods, the first using programmed I/O (PIO) ad-
dressing and the second using direct memory access (DMA) mode.
PIO is nothing more than the traditional I/O addressing scheme, where
the CPU talks directly to the hard drive via the BIOS to send and receive
data. Three different PIO speeds called PIO modes were initially adopted:
■
PIO mode 0: 3.3 MBps (megabytes per second)
■
PIO mode 1: 5.2 MBps
■
PIO mode 2: 8.3 MBps
DMA modes defined a method to enable the hard drives to talk to RAM
directly, using old-style DMA commands. (The ATA folks called this single-
word DMA.) This old-style DMA was slow, and the resulting three ATA
single-word DMA modes were also slow:
■
Single-word DMA mode 0: 2.1 MBps
■
Single-word DMA mode 1: 4.2 MBps
■
Single-word DMA mode 2: 8.3 MBps
When a computer booted up, the BIOS queried the hard
drive to see what modes it could use and then automatically
adjusted to the fastest mode.
ATA-2
In 1990, the industry adopted a series of improvements to the
ATA standard called ATA-2. Many people called these new
features Enhanced IDE (EIDE). EIDE was really no more than a
marketing term invented by Western Digital, but it caught on
in common vernacular and is still used today, although its use
is fading. Regular IDE drives quickly disappeared, and by
1995, EIDE drives dominated the PC world. Figure 9.11 shows
a typical EIDE drive.
ATA-2 was the most important ATA standard, as it in-
cluded powerful new features such as higher capacities, sup-
port for non–hard drive storage devices, support for two more
ATA devices for a maximum of four, and substantially im-
proved throughput.
Higher Capacity with LBA
IBM created the AT BIOS to support hard drives many years before IDE
drives were invented, and every system had that BIOS. The developers of
IDE made certain that the new drives would run from the same AT BIOS
command set. With this capability, you could use the same CMOS and BIOS
routines to talk to a much more advanced drive. Your motherboard or hard
drive controller wouldn’t become instantly obsolete when you installed a
new hard drive.
Unfortunately, the BIOS routines for the original AT command set allowed
a hard drive size of only up to 528 million bytes (or 504 MB—remember that a
288

• Figure 9.11
EIDE drive
The terms ATA, IDE, and EIDE
are used interchangeably.
Hard drive makers talk about
hard drive capacities in millions
and billions of bytes, not mega-
bytes and gigabytes.

mega = 1,048,576, not 1,000,000). A drive could have no more than 1024 cylin-
ders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors/track:
1024 cylinders × 16 heads × 63 sectors/track × 512 bytes/sector = 504 MB
For years, this was not a problem. But when hard drives began to ap-
proach the 504 MB barrier, it became clear that there needed to be a way of
getting past 504 MB. The ATA-2 standard defined a way to get past this limit
with logical block addressing (LBA). With LBA, the hard drive lies to the com-
puter about its geometry through an advanced type of sector translation.
Let’s take a moment to understand sector translation, and then come back to
LBA.
Sector Translation
Long before hard drives approached
the 504 MB limit, the limits of 1024 cylinders, 16 heads, and
63 sectors/track gave hard drive makers fits. The big prob-
lem was the heads. Remember that every two heads means
another platter, another physical disk that you have to
squeeze into a hard drive. If you wanted a hard drive with
the maximum number of 16 heads, you would need a hard
drive with eight physical platters inside the drive. Nobody
wanted that many platters: it made the drives too tall, it
took more power to spin up the drive, and that many parts
cost too much money (Figure 9.12).
Manufacturers could readily produce a hard drive that
had fewer heads and more cylinders, but the stupid 1024/
16/63 limit got in the way. Plus, the traditional sector ar-
rangement wasted a lot of useful space. Sectors toward the
inside of the drive, for example, are much shorter than the
sectors on the outside. The sectors on the outside don’t
need to be that long, but with the traditional geometry
setup, hard drive makers had no choice. They could make a
hard drive store a lot more information, however, if they
could make hard drives with more sectors/track on the
outside tracks (Figure 9.13).
The ATA specification was designed to have two geom-
etries. The physical geometry defined the real layout of the
CHS inside the drive. The logical geometry described what
the drive told the CMOS. In other words, the IDE drive
“lied” to the CMOS, thus side-stepping the artificial limits
of the BIOS. When data was being transferred to and from the drive, the
onboard circuitry of the drive translated the logical geometry into the physi-
cal geometry. This function was, and still is, called sector translation.
Let’s look at a couple of hypo-
thetical examples in action. First,
pretend that Seagate came out with
a new, cheap, fast hard drive called
the ST108. To get the ST108 drive
fast and cheap, however, Seagate
had to use a rather strange geome-
try, shown in Table 9.1.

Table 9.1
Seagate’s ST108 Drive Geometry

Notice that the cylinder number
is greater than 1024. To overcome
this problem, the IDE drive per-
forms a sector translation that re-
ports a geometry to the BIOS that is
totally different from the true ge-
ometry of the drive. Table 9.2 shows
the actual geometry and the “logi-
cal”
geometry
of
our
mythical
ST108 drive. Notice that the logical
geometry is now within the acceptable parameters of the BIOS limitations.
Sector translation never changes the capacity of the drive; it changes only
the geometry to stay within the BIOS limits.
Back to LBA
Now let’s watch how the advanced sector translation of LBA
provides support for hard drives greater than 504 MB. Let’s use an old
drive, the Western Digital WD2160,
a 2.1-GB hard drive, as an example.
This drive is no longer in produc-
tion but its smaller CHS values
make understanding LBA easier.
Table 9.3 lists its physical and logi-
cal geometries.
Note
that,
even
with
sector
translation, the number of heads is
greater than the allowed 16. So
here’s where the magic of LBA
comes in. The WD2160 is capable of LBA. Now assuming that the BIOS is also
capable of LBA, here’s what happens. When the computer boots up, the BIOS
asks the drives if they can perform LBA. If they say yes, the BIOS and the
drive work together to change the way they talk to each other. They can do
this without conflicting with the original AT BIOS commands by taking ad-
vantage of unused commands to use up to 256 heads. LBA enables support
for a maximum of 1024 × 256 × 63 × 512 bytes = 8.4-GB hard drives. Back in
1990, 8.4 GB was hundreds of time larger than the drives used at the time.
Don’t worry, later ATA standards will get the BIOS up to today’s huge drives.
Not Just Hard Drives Anymore: ATAPI
ATA-2 added an extension to the ATA specification, called Advanced Tech-
nology Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI), that enabled non–hard drive de-
vices such as CD-ROM drives and tape backups to connect to the PC via the
ATA controllers. ATAPI drives have the same 40-pin interface and master/
slave jumpers as ATA hard drives. Figure 9.14 shows an ATAPI CD-RW
drive attached to a motherboard. The key difference between hard drives and
every other type of drive that attaches to the ATA controller is in how the
drives get BIOS support. Hard drives get it through the system BIOS, whereas
non–hard drives require the operating system to load a software driver.
More Drives with ATA-2
ATA-2 added support for a second controller, raising the total number of
supported drives from two to four. Each of the two controllers is equal in

motherboard, showing the primary controller marked as

Increased Speed
ATA-2 defined two new PIO modes and a new type of
DMA called multi-word DMA that was a substantial im-
provement over the old DMA. Technically, multi-word
DMA was still the old-style DMA, but it worked in a
much more efficient manner so it was much faster.
■
PIO mode 3: 11.1 MBps
■
PIO mode 4: 16.6 MBps
■
Multi-word DMA mode 0: 4.2 MBps
■
Multi-word DMA mode 1: 13.3 MBps
■
Multi-word DMA mode 2: 16.6 MBps
ATA-3
ATA-3 came on quickly after ATA-2 and added one new feature called Self-
Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.), one of the few
PC acronyms that requires the use of periods after each letter). S.M.A.R.T.
helps predict when a hard drive is going to fail by monitoring the hard
drive’s mechanical components.
S.M.A.R.T. is a great idea and is popular in specialized server systems,
but it’s complex, imperfect, and hard to understand. As a result, only a few
utilities can read the S.M.A.R.T. data on your hard drive. Your best sources
are the hard drive manufacturers. Every hard drive maker has a free diag-
nostic tool (which usually works only for their drives) that will do a
S.M.A.R.T. check along with other tests. Figure 9.16 shows Western Digital’s

Although you can see the actual S.M.A.R.T. data, it’s generally useless or
indecipherable. Your best choice is to trust the manufacturer’s opinion and
run the software provided.
ATA-4
Anyone who has opened a big database file on a hard drive appreciates that
a faster hard drive is better. ATA-4 introduced a new DMA mode called Ul-
tra DMA that is now the primary way a hard drive communicates with a PC.
Ultra DMA uses DMA bus mastering to achieve far faster speeds than were
possible with PIO or old-style DMA. ATA-4 defined three Ultra DMA
modes:
■
Ultra DMA mode 0: 16.7 MBps
■
Ultra DMA mode 1: 25.0 MBps
■
Ultra DMA mode 2: 33.3 MBps
INT13 Extensions
Here’s an interesting factoid for you: The original ATA-1 standard allowed
for hard drives up to 137 GB. It wasn’t the ATA standard that caused the
504-MB size limit; the standard used the old AT BIOS, and the BIOS, not the
ATA standard, could support only 504 MB. LBA was a work-around that
told the hard drive to lie to the BIOS to get it up to 8.4 GB. But eventually
hard drives started edging close to the LBA limit and something had to be
done. The T13 folks said, “This isn’t our problem. It’s the ancient BIOS prob-
lem. You BIOS makers need to fix the BIOS.” And they did.
292

S.M.A.R.T. information
Ultra DMA mode 2, the most
popular of the ATA-4 DMA
modes, is also called ATA/33.

In 1994, Phoenix Technologies (the BIOS manufacturer) came up with a
new set of BIOS commands called Interrupt 13 (INT13) extensions. INT13
extensions broke the 8.4-GB barrier by completely ignoring the CHS values
and instead feeding the LBA a stream of addressable sectors. A system with
INT13 extensions can handle drives up to 137 GB. The entire PC industry
quickly adopted INT13 extensions, and every system made since 2000–2001
supports INT13 extensions.
ATA-5
Ultra DMA was such a huge hit that the ATA folks adopted two faster Ultra
DMA modes with ATA-5:
■
Ultra DMA mode 3: 44.4 MBps
■
Ultra DMA mode 4: 66.6 MBps
Ultra DMA mode 4 ran so quickly that the ATA-5 standard defined a new
type of ribbon cable that could handle the higher speeds. This 80-wire cable
still has 40 pins on the connectors, but it also includes another 40 wires in the
cable that act as grounds to improve the cable’s capability to handle high-
speed signals. The 80-wire cable, just like the 40-pin ribbon cable, has a col-
ored stripe down one side to give you proper orientation for pin 1 on the con-
troller and the hard drive. Previous versions of ATA didn’t define where the
various drives were plugged into the ribbon cable, but ATA-5 defined exactly
where the controller, master, and slave drives connected, even defining colors
to identify them. Take a look at the ATA/66 cable in Figure 9.18. The connector
on the left is colored blue—and you must use that connector to plug into the
controller. The connector in the middle is gray—that’s for the
slave drive. The connector on the right is black—that’s for the
master drive. Any ATA/66 controller connections are colored
blue to let you know it is an ATA/66 controller.
ATA/66 is backward compatible, so you may safely plug
an earlier drive into an ATA/66 cable and controller. If you
plug an ATA/66 drive into an older controller, it will
workjust not in ATA/66 mode. The only risky action is to
use an ATA/66 controller and hard drive with a non-ATA/66
cable. Doing so will almost certainly cause nasty data losses!
ATA-6
Hard drive size exploded in the early 21st century, and the seemingly
impossible-to-fill 137-GB limit created by INT13 extensions became a bar-
rier to fine computing more quickly than most people had anticipated.
When drives started hitting the 120-GB mark, the T13 committee adopted an
industry proposal pushed by Maxtor (a major hard drive maker) called Big
Drive that increased the limit to more than 144 petabytes (approximately
144,000,000 GB). Thankfully, T13 also gave the new standard a less-silly
name, calling it ATA/ATAPI-6 or simply ATA-6. Big Drive was basically just
a 48-bit LBA, supplanting the older 24-bit addressing of LBA and INT13 ex-
tensions. Plus, the standard defined an enhanced block mode, enabling
Chapter 9: Hard Drive Technologies
293
Ultra DMA mode 4, the most
popular of the ATA-5 DMA
modes, is also called ATA/66.
• Figure 9.18
ATA/66 cable

drives to transfer up to 65,536 sectors in one chunk, up from the measly
256 sectors of lesser drive technologies.
ATA-6 also introduced Ultra DMA mode 5, kicking the data transfer rate
up to 100 MBps. Ultra DMA mode 5 is more commonly referred to as ATA/
100 and requires the same 80-wire cable as ATA/66.
ATA-7
ATA-7 brought two new innovations to the ATA world: one evolutionary
and the other revolutionary. The evolutionary innovation came with the last
of the parallel ATA Ultra DMA modes; the revolutionary was a new form of
ATA called serial ATA (SATA).
ATA/133
ATA-7 introduced the fastest and probably least adopted of all of the ATA
speeds, Ultra DMA mode 6 (ATA/133). Even though it runs at a speed of
133 MBps, the fact that it came out with SATA kept many hard drive manu-
facturers away. ATA/133 uses the same cables as Ultra DMA 66 and 100.
While you won’t find many ATA/133 hard drives, you will find plenty
of ATA/133 controllers. There’s a trend in the industry to color the control-
ler connections on the hard drive red, although this is not part of the ATA-7
standard.
Serial ATA
The real story of ATA-7 is SATA. For all its longevity as the mass storage in-
terface of choice for the PC, parallel ATA has problems. First, the flat ribbon
cables impede airflow and can be a pain to insert properly. Second, the ca-
bles have a limited length, only 18 inches. Third, you can’t hot-swap PATA
drives. You have to shut down completely before installing or replacing a
drive. Finally, the technology has simply reached the limits of what it can do
in terms of throughput.
Serial ATA addresses these issues. SATA creates a point-to-point con-
nection between the SATA device—hard disk, CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD-
ROM, DVD-RW, BD-R, BD-RE, and so on—and the SATA controller, the
host bus adapter (HBA). At a glance, SATA devices look identical to standard
PATA devices. Take a closer look at the cable and power connectors, how-
ever, and you’ll see significant differences (Figure 9.19).
Because SATA devices send data serially instead of in par-
allel, the SATA interface needs far fewer physical wires—7 in-
stead of the 80 wires typical of PATA—resulting in much
thinner cabling. This might not seem significant, but the bene-
fit is that thinner cabling means better cable control and better
airflow through the PC case, resulting in better cooling.
Further, the maximum SATA-device cable length is more
than twice that of an IDE cable—about 40 inches (1 meter) in-
stead of 18 inches. Again, this might not seem like a big deal
unless you’ve struggled to connect a PATA hard disk installed
into the top bay of a full-tower case to an IDE connector lo-
cated all the way at the bottom of the motherboard.
294
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 9.19
SATA hard disk power (left) and data (right)
cables

SATA does away with the entire master/slave concept. Each drive con-
nects to one port, so daisy-chaining drives is no longer possible. Further,
there’s no maximum number of drivesmany motherboards are now avail-
able that support up to eight SATA drives. Want more? Snap in a SATA
HBA and load ’em up!
The big news, however, is in data throughput. As the name implies,
SATA devices transfer data in serial bursts instead of parallel, as PATA de-
vices do. Typically, you might not think of serial devices as being faster than
parallel, but in this case, that’s exactly the case. A SATA device’s single
stream of data moves much faster than the multiple streams of data coming
from a parallel IDE device—theoretically up to 30 times faster. SATA drives
come in two common varieties, the 1.5 GB and the 3 GB, that have a maxi-
mum throughput of 150 MBps and 300 MBps, respectively.
SATA is backward compatible with current PATA standards and en-
ables you to install a parallel ATA device, including a hard drive, optical
drive, and other devices, to a serial ATA controller by using a SATA bridge.
A SATA bridge manifests as a tiny card that you plug directly into the
40-pin connector on a PATA drive. As you can see in Figure 9.20, the con-
troller chip on the bridge requires separate power; you plug a Molex con-
nector into the PATA drive as normal. When you boot the system, the PATA
drive shows up to the system as a SATA drive.
SATA’s ease of use has made it the choice for desktop system storage,
and its success is already showing in the fact that more than 90 percent of all
hard drives sold today are SATA drives.
AHCI
Windows Vista and later operating systems support the Advanced
Host Controller Interface (AHCI), a more efficient way to work with SATA
HBAs. Using AHCI unlocks some of the advanced features of SATA, such as
hot-swapping and native command queuing.
When you plug a SATA drive into a Windows computer that does not
have AHCI enabled, the drive doesn’t appear automatically. You need to go
to the Control Panel and run the Add New Hardware Wizard to make the
drive appear. AHCI makes the drive appear in Computer, just what you’d
expect from a hot-swappable device.
Native command queuing (NCQ) is a disk-optimization feature for SATA
drives. It enables faster read and write speeds.

Tech Tip
SATA Names
Number-savvy readers might have
noticed a discrepancy between the
names and throughput of the two
SATA drives. After all, 1.5 GB
per second throughput translates
to 192 MB per second, a lot higher
than the advertised speed of a
“mere” 150 MBps. The same is
true of the 3 GB/300 MBps drives.
The encoding scheme used on
SATA drives takes about 20 per-
cent of the overhead for the drive,
leaving 80 percent for pure band-
width. The 3 GB drive created all
kinds of problems, because the
committee working on the specifi-
cations was called the SATA II
committee, and marketers picked
up on the SATA II name. As a
result, you’ll find many brands
called SATA II rather than 3 GB.
The SATA committee now goes by
the name SATA-IO.
As this book went to press, a
few motherboards and hard drive
controller cards appeared that
support the SATA 3.0 standard,
with data rates up to 6 GBps.
Look for the SATA 3.0 drives on
the store shelves after you read
this, but don’t expect the technol-
ogy to be on the CompTIA A+ Es-
sentials exam this time around.

Tech Tip
Enabling AHCI After
the Fact
If you want to enable AHCI but
you’ve already installed Windows
Vista, don’t worry! Microsoft has
developed a procedure (http://
support.microsoft.com/kb/922976)
that will have you enjoying all that
AHCI fun in no time. Before you
jump in, note that this procedure
requires you to edit your Registry,
so remember to always make a
backup before you start editing.

AHCI is implemented at the CMOS level and generally needs to be en-
abled before you install the operating system. Enabling it after installation
will cause Vista to Blue Screen. Nice.
eSATA
External SATA (eSATA) extends the SATA bus to external devices,
as the name would imply. The eSATA drives use connectors similar to inter-
nal SATA, but they’re keyed differently so you can’t mistake
one for the other. Figure 9.21 shows eSATA connectors on the
back of a motherboard. External SATA uses shielded cable
lengths up to 2 meters outside the PC and is hot pluggable.
The beauty of eSATA is that it extends the SATA bus at full
speed, so you’re not limited to the meager 50 or 60 MBps of
FireWire or USB.
If a desktop system doesn’t have an eSATA external con-
nector, or if you need more external SATA devices, you can in-
stall an eSATA HBA PCIe card or eSATA internal-to-external
slot plate. You can similarly upgrade laptop systems to sup-
port

adapter plugs, although you’ll be limited to the much slower
USB data-transfer rates. Install eSATA PCIe, PC Card, or
ExpressCard adapters following the same rules and precau-
tions for installing any expansion device.
■SCSI: Still Around
Many specialized server machines and enthusiasts’ systems use the small
computer system interface (SCSI) technologies for various pieces of core
hardware and peripherals, from hard drives to printers to high-end tape-
backup machines. SCSI (pronounced “scuzzy”) is different from ATA in
that SCSI devices connect together in a string of devices called a chain. Each
device in the chain gets a SCSI ID to distinguish it from other devices on the
chain. Last, the ends of a SCSI chain must be terminated. Let’s dive into SCSI
now, and see how SCSI chains, SCSI IDs, and termination all work.

and ExpressCards—both tech-
nologies designed to add expan-
sion options for portable
computers—see Chapter 14,
“Learning Portable Computing.”

SCSI is an old technology dating from the late 1970s, but it
has been updated continually. SCSI is faster than ATA
(though the gap is closing fast), and until SATA arrived, SCSI
was the only good choice for anyone using RAID (see the
“RAID” section a little later). SCSI is arguably fading away,
but it deserves some mention.
SCSI Chains
SCSI manifests itself through a SCSI chain, a series of SCSI de-
vices working together through a host adapter. The host
adapter provides the interface between the SCSI chain and the
PC. Figure 9.23 shows a typical PCI host adapter. Many techs
refer to the host adapter as the SCSI controller, so you should
be comfortable with both terms.
All SCSI devices can be divided into two groups: internal
and external. Internal SCSI devices are attached inside the PC
and connect to the host adapter through the latter’s internal
connector. Figure 9.24 shows an internal SCSI device, in this
case a CD-ROM drive. External devices hook to the external
connector of the host adapter. Figure 9.25 is an example of an
external SCSI device.
Internal SCSI devices connect to the host adapter with a
68-pin ribbon cable (Figure 9.26). This flat, flexible cable func-
tions precisely like a PATA cable. Many external devices con-
nect to the host adapter with a 50-pin high-density (HD)
connector. Figure 9.27 shows a host adapter external port.
Higher-end SCSI devices use a 68-pin HD connector.
Multiple internal devices can be connected simply by
using a cable with enough connectors. Figure 9.28, for exam-
ple, shows a chain of three SCSI devices, including the host
adapter.
Assuming the SCSI host adapter has a standard external
port (some controllers don’t have external connections at all), plugging in an
external SCSI device is as simple as running a cable from device to control-
ler. The external SCSI connectors are D-shaped so you can’t plug them in

backward. As an added bonus, some ex-
ternal SCSI devices have two ports, one to
connect to the host adapter and a second
to connect to another SCSI device. The
process of connecting a device directly to
another device is called daisy-chaining.
You can daisy-chain as many as 15 devices
to one host adapter. SCSI chains can be in-
ternal, external, or both (Figure 9.29).
SCSI IDs
If you’re going to connect a number of de-
vices on the same SCSI chain, you must
provide some way for the host adapter to
tell one device from another. To differenti-
ate devices, SCSI uses a unique identifier
called the SCSI ID. The SCSI ID number can range from 0 to 15. SCSI IDs are
similar to many other PC hardware settings in that a SCSI device can theo-
retically have any SCSI ID as long as that ID is not already taken by another
device connected to the same host adapter.

Some conventions should be followed when setting SCSI IDs. Typically,
most people set the host adapter to 7 or 15, but you can change this setting.
Note that there is no order for the use of SCSI IDs. It does not matter which
device gets which number, and you can skip numbers. Restrictions on IDs
apply only within a single chain. Two devices can have the
same ID, in other words, as long as they are on different
chains (Figure 9.30).
Every SCSI device has some method of setting its SCSI
ID. The trick is to figure out how as you’re holding the de-
vice in your hand. A SCSI device may use jumpers, dip
switches, or even tiny dials; every new SCSI device is an
adventure as you try to determine how to set its SCSI ID.
Termination
Whenever you send a signal down a wire, some of that sig-
nal reflects back up the wire, creating an echo and causing
electronic chaos. SCSI chains use termination to prevent this
problem. Termination simply means putting something on
the ends of the wire to prevent this echo. Terminators are
usually pull-down resistors and can manifest themselves in
many different ways. Most of the devices within a PC have the appropriate
termination built in. On other devices, including SCSI chains and some net-
work cables, you have to set termination during installation.
The rule with SCSI is that you must terminate only the ends of the SCSI
chain. You have to terminate the ends of the cable, which usually means that
you need to terminate the two devices at the ends of the cable. Do not termi-
nate devices that are not on the ends of the cable. Figure 9.31 shows some ex-
amples of where to terminate SCSI devices.

Old SCSI equipment allowed
SCSI IDs from 0 to 7 only.

IDs don’t conflict between separate SCSI
chains.

Location of the terminated devices

Because any SCSI device might be on the end of a chain, most manufac-
turers build SCSI devices that can self-terminate. Some devices can detect
that they are on the end of the SCSI chain and automatically terminate them-
selves. Most devices, however, require you to set a jumper or switch to en-
able termination (Figure 9.32).
■Protecting Data with RAID
Ask experienced techs “What is the most expensive part of a PC?” and
they’ll all answer in the same way: “It’s the data.” You can replace any single
part of your PC for a few hundred dollars at most, but if you lose critical
data—well, let’s just say I know of two small companies that went out of
business just because they lost a hard drive full of data.
Data is king; data is your PC’s raison d’être. Losing data is a bad thing, so
you need some method to prevent data loss. Of course, you can do backups,
but if a hard drive dies, you have to shut down the computer, reinstall a new
hard drive, reinstall the operating system, and then restore the backup.
There’s nothing wrong with this as long as you can afford the time and cost
of shutting down the system.
A better solution, though, would save your data if a hard drive died and
enable you to continue working throughout the process. This is possible if
you stop relying on a single hard drive and instead use two or more drives
to store your data. Sounds good, but how do you do this? Well, first of all,
you could install some fancy hard
drive controller that reads and
writes data to two hard drives si-
multaneously (Figure 9.33). The
data on each drive would always be
identical. One drive would be the
primary drive and the other drive,
called the mirror drive, would not
be used unless the primary drive
failed. This process of reading and
writing data at the same time to two
drives is called disk mirroring.
If you really want to make data
safe, you can use a separate control-
ler for each drive. With two drives,
each on a separate controller, the
system will continue to operate
even if the primary drive’s control-
ler stops working. This super-drive
mirroring technique is called disk
duplexing (Figure 9.34). Disk du-
plexing is also much faster than
disk mirroring because one control-
ler does not write each piece of data
twice.

• Figure 9.33
Mirrored drives

Even though duplexing is faster
than mirroring, they both are slower
than the classic one-drive, one-
controller setup. You can use multi-
ple drives to increase your hard drive
access speed. Disk striping (without
parity) means spreading the data
among multiple (at least two) drives.
Disk striping by itself provides no
redundancy. If you save a small
Microsoft Word file, for example, the
file is split into multiple pieces; half
of the pieces go on one drive and half
on the other (Figure 9.35).
The one and only advantage of
disk striping is speed—it is a fast way
to read and write to hard drives. But
if either drive fails, all data is lost. You
should not do disk striping—unless
you’re willing to increase the risk of
losing data to increase the speed at
which your hard drives save and re-
store data.
Disk striping with parity, in con-
trast, protects data by adding extra

• Figure 9.34
Duplexing drives
• Figure 9.35
Disk striping

information, called parity data, that can be used to rebuild data if one of the
drives fails. Disk striping with parity requires at least three drives, but it is
common to use more than three. Disk striping with parity combines the best
of disk mirroring and plain disk striping. It protects data and is quite fast.
The majority of network servers use a type of disk striping with parity.
RAID
A couple of sharp guys in Berkeley back in the 1980s organized the many
techniques for using multiple drives for data protection and increasing
speeds as the redundant array of independent (or inexpensive) disks (RAID).
They outlined seven levels of RAID, numbered 0 through 6.
■
RAID 0—Disk Striping
Disk striping requires at least two drives.
It does not provide redundancy to data. If any one drive fails, all
data is lost.
■
RAID 1—Disk Mirroring/Duplexing
RAID 1 arrays require at
least two hard drives, although they also work with any even
number of drives. RAID 1 is the ultimate in safety, but you lose
storage space because the data is duplicated; you need two 100-GB
drives to store 100 GB of data.
■
RAID 2—Disk Striping with Multiple Parity Drives
RAID 2 was
a weird RAID idea that never saw practical use. It’s unused, so
ignore it.
■
RAID 3 and 4—Disk Striping with Dedicated Parity
RAID 3
and 4 combined dedicated data drives with dedicated parity drives.
The differences between the two are trivial. Unlike RAID 2, these
versions did see some use in the real world but were quickly
replaced by RAID 5.
■
RAID 5—Disk Striping with Distributed Parity
Instead of
dedicated data and parity drives, RAID 5 distributes data and parity
information evenly across all drives. This is the fastest way to
provide data redundancy. RAID 5 is by far the most common RAID
implementation and requires at least three drives. RAID 5 arrays
effectively use one drive’s worth of space for parity. If, for example,
you have three 200-GB drives, your total storage capacity is 400 GB.
If you have four 200-GB drives, your total capacity is 600 GB.
■
RAID 6—Disk Striping with Extra Parity
If you lose a hard drive
in a RAID 5 array, your data is at great risk until you replace the bad
hard drive and rebuild the array. RAID 6 is RAID 5 with extra parity
information. RAID 6 needs at least five drives, but in exchange you
can lose up to two drives at the same time. RAID 6 is gaining in
popularity for those willing to use larger arrays.
After these first RAID levels were defined, some manufacturers came up
with ways to combine different RAIDs. For example, what if you took two
pairs of striped drives and mirrored the pairs? You would get what is called
RAID 0+1. Or what if (read this carefully now) you took two pairs of mir-
rored drives and striped the pairs? You then get what we call RAID 1+0 or
what is often called RAID 10. Combinations of different types of single
RAID are called multiple RAID or nested RAID solutions.
302
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
An array in the context of
RAID refers to a collection of two
or more hard drives.
Tech Tip
RAID Lingo
No tech worth her salt says such
things as “We’re implementing
disk striping with parity.” Use the
RAID level. Say, “We’re imple-
menting RAID 5.” It’s more accu-
rate and very impressive to the
folks in the accounting department!
There is actually a term for a
storage system composed of
multiple independent disks
rather than disks organized by
using RAID: JBOD, which stands
for just a bunch of disks (or
drives).

Implementing RAID
RAID levels describe different methods of providing data redundancy or
enhancing the speed of data throughput to and from groups of hard drives.
They do not say how to implement these methods. Literally thousands of
methods can be used to set up RAID. The method you use depends largely
on the level of RAID you desire, the operating system you use, and the thick-
ness of your wallet.
The obvious starting place for RAID is to connect at least two hard
drives in some fashion to create a RAID array. For many years, if you
wanted to do RAID beyond RAID 0 and RAID 1, the only technology you
could use was good-old SCSI. SCSI’s chaining of multiple devices to a single
controller made it a natural for RAID. SCSI drives make superb RAID ar-
rays, but the high cost of SCSI drives and RAID-capable host adapters kept
RAID away from all but the most critical systems—usually big file servers.
In the past few years, substan-
tial leaps in ATA technology have
made ATA a viable alternative to
SCSI drive technology for RAID ar-
rays. Specialized ATA RAID con-
troller cards support ATA RAID
arrays of up to 15 drives—plenty to
support even the most complex
RAID needs. In addition, the inher-
ent hot-swap capabilities of serial
ATA have virtually guaranteed that
serial ATA will quickly take over
the lower end of the RAID business.
Personally, I think the price and
performance of serial ATA mean
SCSI’s days are numbered.
Once you have a number of
hard drives, the next question is
whether to use hardware or soft-
ware to control the array. Let’s look
at both options.
Hardware vs. Software
All RAID implementations break down into either hardware or software
methods. Software is often used when price takes priority over perfor-
mance. Hardware is used when you need speed along with data redun-
dancy. Software RAID does not require special controllers; you can use the
regular ATA controllers, SATA controllers, or SCSI host adapters to make a
software RAID array. But you do need “smart” software. The most common
software implementation of RAID is the built-in RAID software that comes
with Windows 2000, 2003, and 2008 Server. The Disk Management program
in these Windows Server versions can configure drives for RAID 0, 1, or 5,
and it works with PATA, SATA, and/or SCSI (Figure 9.36). Disk Manage-
ment in Windows 2000 Professional, Windows XP, and Windows Vista, in
contrast, can only do RAID 0.
Chapter 9: Hard Drive Technologies

Try This!
Managing Heat with Multiple Drives
Adding three or more fast hard drives into a cramped PC case can be a
recipe for disaster to the unwary tech. All those disks spinning con-
stantly create a phenomenal amount of heat. Heat kills PCs! You have to
manage the heat inside a RAID-enabled system or risk losing your data,
drives, and basic system stability. The easiest way to do this is to add
fans, so Try This!
Open up your PC case and look for built-in places to mount fans.
How many case fans do you have installed now? What size are they?
What sizes can you use? (Most cases use 80-mm fans, but 60- and 120-mm
fans are common as well.) Jot down the particulars of your system and
take a trip to the local PC store to check out the fans.
Before you get all fan-happy and grab the biggest and baddest fans
to throw in your case, don’t forget to think about the added noise level.
Try to get a compromise between keeping your case cool enough and
avoiding early deafness.
You can use Disk Manage-
ment in Windows 2000, Win-
dows XP Professional, and
Windows Vista to create RAID 1
and RAID 5 arrays, but you can
use Disk Management only re-
motely on a Windows 2000,
2003, or 2008 Server OS. In
other words, the capability is
there, but Microsoft has limited
the OS. If you want to use soft-
ware RAID in Windows 2000, XP
(Home or Professional), or Vista,
you need to use a third-party
tool to set it up.

Windows Disk Management is not the only software RAID game in
town. A number of third-party software programs work with Windows or
other operating systems.
Software RAID means the operating system is in charge of all RAID
functions. It works for small RAID solutions but tends to overwork your op-
erating system easily, creating slowdowns. When you really need to keep
going, when you need RAID that doesn’t even let the users know a problem
has occurred, hardware RAID is the answer.
Hardware RAID centers on an intelligent controller—either a SCSI host
adapter or a PATA/SATA controller that handles all of the RAID functions
(Figure 9.37). Unlike a regular PATA/SATA controller or SCSI host adapter,
these controllers have chips that have their own processor
and memory. This allows the card, instead of the operating
system, to handle all of the work of implementing RAID.
Most RAID setups in the real world are hardware-
based. Almost all of the many hardware RAID solutions
provide hot-swapping—the ability to replace a bad drive
without disturbing the operating system. Hot-swapping
is common in hardware RAID.
Hardware-based RAID is invisible to the operating
system and is configured in several ways, depending on
the specific chips involved. Most RAID systems have a
special configuration utility in Flash ROM that you ac-
cess after CMOS but before the OS loads. Figure 9.38

solution.
Personal RAID
Due to drastic reductions in the cost of ATA RAID controller chips, in the
past few years we’ve seen an explosion of ATA-based hardware RAID solu-
tions built into mainstream motherboards. While this “ATA RAID on the
motherboard” began with parallel ATA, the introduction of serial ATA
made motherboards with built-in RAID extremely common.
These personal RAID motherboards might be common but they’re not
used too terribly often, given that these RAID solutions usually provide
only RAID 0 or RAID 1. If you want to use RAID, spend a few extra dollars
and buy a RAID 5–capable controller.
The Future Is RAID
RAID has been with us for about 20 years, but until only recently it was the
domain of big systems and deep pockets. During those 20 years, however, a
number of factors have come together to make RAID a reality for both big
servers and common desktop systems. Imagine a world where dirt-cheap
RAID on every computer means no one ever again loses critical data. I get
goose bumps just thinking about it!
Beyond A+
Spindle (or Rotational) Speed
Hard drives run at a set spindle speed, measured in revolutions per minute
(RPM). Older drives run at the long-standard speed of 3600 RPM, but new
Chapter 9: Hard Drive Technologies
305
• Figure 9.38
RAID configuration utility
RAID controllers aren’t just
for internal drives; some models
can handle multiple eSATA
drives configured at any of the
RAID levels. If you’re feeling
lucky, you can create a RAID ar-
ray using both internal and ex-
ternal SATA drives.

drives are hitting 15,000 RPM. The faster the spindle
speed, the faster the controller can store and retrieve
data. Here are the common speeds: 4500, 5400, 7200, and
10,000 RPM.
Faster drives mean better system performance, but
they can also cause the computer to overheat. This is es-
pecially true in tight cases, such as minitowers, and in
cases containing many drives. Two 4500-RPM drives
might run forever, snugly tucked together in your old
case. But slap a hot new 10,000 RPM drive in that same
case and watch your system start crashing right and left!
You can deal with these hotrod drives by adding
drive bay fans between the drives or migrating to a more
spacious case. Most enthusiasts end up doing both.
Drive bay fans sit at the front of a bay and blow air across
the drive. They range in price from $10 to $100 (U.S.) and
can lower the temperature of your drives dramatically.
Some cases come with a bay fan built in (Figure 9.39).
Airflow in a case can make or break your system stabil-
ity, especially when you add new drives that increase the
ambient temperature. Hot systems get flaky and lock up at
odd moments. Many things can impede the airflow—
jumbled-up ribbon cables, drives squished together in a
tiny case, fans clogged by dust or animal hair, and so on.
Technicians need to be aware of the dangers when
adding a new hard drive to an older system. Get into the
habit of tying off ribbon cables, adding front fans to cases
when systems lock up intermittently, and making sure
any fans run well. Finally, if a client wants a new drive
for a system in a tiny minitower with only the power
supply fan to cool it off, be gentle, but definitely steer the client to one of the
slower drives!
Hybrid Hard Drives
Windows Vista supports hybrid hard drives (HHDs), drives that combine
flash memory and spinning platters to provide fast and reliable storage, and
offers ReadyBoost and Superfetch for faster caching and booting. Samsung
has drives with 128-MB and 256-MB flash cache, for example, that shave
boot times in half and, because the platters don’t have to spin all of the time,
add 20–30 minutes more of battery life for portable computers. Adding that
much more run time with only a tiny price premium and no extra weight is
the Holy Grail of portable computing.

Chapter 9 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about hard drive technologies.
Explain how hard drives work
■
Traditional hard drives contain aluminum platters
coated with a magnetic medium and read/write
heads that float on a cushion of air. Hard drives store
data in a tiny magnetic field called a flux that defines
a zero or a one. The switching back and forth of the
field is called flux reversal. The incredible storage
capacity of today’s drives results from Partial
Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) encoding
that includes intelligent circuitry to analyze each
flux reversal.
■
Two technologies have been used to move read/
write heads across the platters: stepper motors and
voice coil. Very susceptible to physical deterioration
and temperature changes, the now obsolete stepper
motors moved the actuator arm in fixed increments
or steps, often resulting in data-transfer errors or the
inability to access data on a cold drive. The heads
had to be parked to a non-data area when not in use
to prevent possible damage to the disk surface.
Today’s drives use a linear or voice coil motor
consisting of a permanent magnet surrounding a
coil on the actuator arm. Electrical current causes
the coil to generate a magnetic field that moves the
actuator arm and thus the read/write heads.
Containing no data, one side of one platter is used
as a map to position the heads directly over the data.
Voice coil technology automatically parks the heads
when the drive loses power.
■
Disk geometry for a particular hard drive consists
of three primary values: heads, cylinders, and
sectors per track (sectors/track). There are two
read/write heads per platter. A hard drive can
have either an even or an odd number of heads.
A cylinder defines a group of tracks of the same
diameter. Each track is sliced into tiny slivers
called sectors, each of which stores 512 bytes of
data. Disk geometry uses the number of sectors
per track. Combining cylinders, heads, and
sectors/track is referred to as CHS. Write
precompensation and landing zone, two other
geometric values, have no relevance in today’s
PCs, but most CMOS utilities still support them.
■
Solid-state drives use memory chips to store data
and don’t have any metal spinning parts. They
require less electricity than platter-based drives
and offer faster reads and writes. At the time of
this writing, they cost substantially more than
traditional drives.
Identify and explain the PATA and SATA
hard drive interfaces
■
Today’s hard drives have either an ATA interface
or a SCSI interface. ATA drives may be parallel
ATA (PATA) or the newer serial ATA (SATA). A
specification of the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), the AT Attachment (ATA)
interface (commonly but incorrectly referred to
as IDE) used a 40-pin ribbon cable, had a built-in
controller, and did not require a low-level format.
By 1995, EIDE was the dominant interface. Its
features include higher capacities, support for
non–hard drive storage devices, a four-device
maximum, and improved throughput. The terms
ATA, IDE, and EIDE are used interchangeably to
describe all PATA devices.
■
PATA drives use a 40-pin plug and a controller that
connects them to the external data bus. Although the
real controller is built into the hard drive itself, the
40-pin connector on the motherboard is called the
controller. Most modern motherboards contain two
PATA controllers, each capable of supporting up to
two PATA devices. By looking at the motherboard
itself or at the motherboard book, you can determine
which is the primary controller and which is the
secondary. If you are using only one controller, it
should be the primary one.
■
Originally, IDE drives used the same BIOS command
set introduced years earlier. Maximum values of 1024
cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors per track limited
an IDE drive’s capacity to 528 million bytes (504 MB).
Western Digital developed the LBA sector translation
method to accommodate larger EIDE drives. LBA
supports drives with up to 256 heads, for a storage
capacity limit of 8.4 GB.
Chapter 9: Hard Drive Technologies
307

■
As drive capacity neared the 8.4-GB maximum,
Phoenix Technologies broke the limit by coming up
with a new set of BIOS commands called Interrupt
13 extensions (INT13). Completely ignoring the CHS
values, INT13 supports drives up to 137 GB by
reporting a stream of addressable sectors to LBA.
■
As drive capacity neared the 137-GB limit, the
ANSI ATA committee adopted ATA/ATAPI-6, a
new standard that increased the limit to more than
144 petabytes (144,000,000 GB). It uses a 48-bit
addressing scheme and an enhanced block mode
that transfers up to 65,536 sectors at a time.
■
Newer hard drives use direct memory access
(DMA) mode to send data directly to RAM,
bypassing the CPU. Instead of using the slow DMA
controller chip, today’s DMA transfers use bus
mastering to transfer 32 bits of data. Hard drives
typically use one of the following modes: Ultra
DMA mode 4 (ATA/66), Ultra DMA mode 5
(ATA/100), and Ultra DMA mode 6 (ATA/133). To
use Ultra DMA, you must have a controller and an
80-wire ribbon cable. Some motherboards combine
different speeds of ATA controllers, with the
higher-speed controller indicated with a bright
color. The 80-wire ribbon cable indicates where to
connect the master and slave drives. High-end
PATA devices can use lower-end controllers, but
they will operate at the slower speed.
■
Serial ATA (SATA) devices look identical to standard
PATA devices (except their data and power
connectors), but their thinner seven-wire cables
provide better airflow and may be up to a meter
(39.4 inches) long. SATA does away with the entire
master/slave concept. Each drive connects to one
port, so daisy-chaining drives is no longer possible.
■
SATA devices are hot-swappable, great for RAID
technology. SATA transfers data in serial bursts for
up to 30 times the throughput of PATA. SATA
drives come in two common varieties, the 1.5 GB
and the 3 GB, that have a maximum throughput of
150 MBps and 300 MBps, respectively.
Identify and explain the SCSI hard drive interfaces
■
All SCSI chains, which support either 8 or 16
devices including the controller, require proper
termination to prevent signal echo. Additionally,
each device on a chain requires a unique SCSI ID,
which can be set by jumpers, switches, or dials.
■
All SCSI devices can be divided into two groups:
internal and external. Internal SCSI devices connect
to the host adapter with a 68-pin ribbon cable.
External devices connect to the host adapter with
either a 50-pin HD connector or a 68-pin HD
connector. SCSI enables you to daisy-chain devices
together to form longer SCSI chains.
■
Improper termination or incorrect SCSI ID settings
are the two most common causes of SCSI devices
not working. The key factor here is that you must
terminate only the ends of the SCSI chain.
Describe how to protect data with RAID
■
Drive mirroring writes data simultaneously to two
hard drives, enabling the system to continue to
work if one hard drive dies. A faster and even
more effective technique is drive duplexing, which
performs mirroring by using separate controllers
for each drive. A third way to create redundant
data is disk striping with parity. This technique,
requiring at least three drives, combines the
redundancy of disk mirroring with the speed of
disk striping. Although disk striping without
parity works very fast, splitting the data across two
drives means you’ll lose all data if either drive fails.
■
Numbered 0 through 6, there are seven official
levels of RAID, but the most commonly used ones
are RAID 0 (disk striping), RAID 1 (disk mirroring
or duplexing), and RAID 5 (disk striping with
distributed parity).
■
RAID may be implemented through hardware
or software methods. Although software
implementation is cheaper, hardware techniques
provide better performance. Windows 2000 Server,
Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008
include built-in RAID software for RAID 0, RAID 1,
and RAID 5 for either ATA or SCSI. Windows
2000, Windows XP Professional, and Windows
Vista include Disk Management for RAID 0. RAID
software solutions tend to overwork your
operating system, resulting in slowdowns.
Hardware RAID is invisible to the OS and is
usually hot-swappable. A hardware ATA RAID
controller usually requires CMOS configuration.
Many motherboards include built-in ATA-based
hardware RAID 0 and RAID 1 capabilities.
■
SCSI drives were a natural for the multiple-disk
RAID. Specialized ATA RAID controller cards
support ATA RAID arrays of up to 15 drives. With
its hot-swap capabilities, SATA may soon take over
lower-end RAID from SCSI.

emovable media refers to any type of mass storage device that you may
use in one system and then physically remove from that system and use in
another. Removable media has been a part of the personal PC since its first
introduction back in 1980. Granted, back then the only removable media available
were floppy disks, but being able to move programs and data easily from one
machine to another was quickly established as one of the strongest points of the
personal computer. Over time, higher-capacity removable media technologies
were introduced. Some technologies—CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, and thumb
drives, for example—have become very common. Other technologies (which
you may or may not have heard of), such as Iomega Zip drives or HD DVDs,
were popular for a time but faded away or were discontinued. The history of PCs
has also left a trash heap of removable media technologies that were trumpeted
in with fanfare and a lot of money but never really saw any adoption.

Today’s highly internetworked computers have reduced the need for re-
movable media as a method of sharing programs and data, but removable me-
dia has so many other uses that this hasn’t slowed things down a bit.
Removable media is the perfect tool for software distribution, data archiving,
and system backup. Figure 10.1 shows my software toolbox. As a PC techni-
cian, you’ll not only need to install, maintain, and troubleshoot removable me-
dia on systems for users, but also find yourself turning to removable media as a
way to store and run software tools to perform all types of PC support.
This chapter covers the most common types of removable media used
today. For the sake of organization, all removable media types are broken
down into these groups:
■
Floppy drives
The traditional floppy drive
■
Flash memory
From USB thumb drives to flash memory cards
■
Optical discs
Any shiny disc technology from CD-ROMs and DVDs
to Blu-ray Discs
■
External drives
Any hard drive or optical drive that connects to a PC
via an external cable
If you go by the earlier description of removable memory, two other
technologies, PC Cards and tape backups, also fit as removable media. PC
Cards are a laptop-centric technology and are covered in Chapter 14,
“Learning Portable Computing,” whereas tape backups are part of the big
world of backups and were covered briefly in Chapter 4, “Understanding
Windows.”

Historical/Conceptual
■Floppy Drives
Good old floppies! These little disks, storing a whopping 1.44 MB of data per
disk, have been part of PCs from the beginning. For decades, the PC industry
made one attempt after another to replace the floppy with some higher-
capacity removable media, only to keep falling back to the floppy disk.
Floppy drive technology was well entrenched: motherboard makers found
floppies easy to add, all BIOS supported them, and they were almost always
the first boot device, so techs loved floppies when they helped boot a system.
Only in the past few years have we finally seen systems without floppy
drives due to an industry push called legacy-free computing: an initiative for-
warded by Microsoft and Intel back in 2001 to rid computers of old technol-
ogies such as PS/2 ports, serial ports, parallel portsand floppy drives
(interesting how long it took to start being adopted by PC makers). Thus, the
venerable floppy drive will probably soon disappear from PCs. Until then,
the floppy drive, that artifact from the Dark Ages of the PC world, will con-
tinue to be a viable technology you must know.
Floppy Drive Basics
When you insert a floppy disk into a floppy drive, the protective slide on the
disk opens, revealing the magnetic media inside the plastic casing. A motor-
driven spindle snaps into the center of the drive to make
it spin. A set of read/write heads then moves back and
forth across the disk, reading or writing tracks on the
disk as needed. The current floppy disks are 3½ inches
wide and store 1.44 MB (Figure 10.2). You use a 3½-inch
floppy drive to access the contents of the disk.
Whenever your system accesses a floppy disk in its
floppy drive, a read/write LED on the outside front of
the drive flashes on. You should not try to remove the
floppy disk from the drive when this light is lit! That light
means that the read/write heads are accessing the floppy
drive, so pulling the disk out while the light is on can
damage the floppy disk. When the light is off, you can
push in the small release button on the front of the drive
to eject the floppy disk.
The first PC floppy drives used a 5¼-inch floppy
drive format (Figure 10.3). The 5¼-inch measurement ac-
tually described the drive, but most users also called the disks for those
drives 5¼-inch disks. In the 1970s and early 1980s, before PCs became pre-
dominant, you would occasionally see an 8-inch format floppy drive in
computers. Fortunately, these never saw any noticeable use in PCs. If you
happen to run into an 8-inch drive or disk, keep it! Collectors of old comput-
ers pay big money for these old drives.
Around 1986, the 3½-inch drives appeared and, within a few years,
came to dominate the floppy world completely. Today, both 3½-inch and
314

• Figure 10.2
Floppy drive and floppy disk
The term “floppy” comes
from the fact that early floppy
disks were actually floppy. You
could easily bend one. Newer
floppy disks came in much more
robust, rigid plastic casings, but
the term has stuck––we still call
them floppies.

5¼-inch floppy drives have mostly been replaced by CD
and DVD burners and USB flash drives. If you are really
interested, however, you can still purchase these drives
on the Internet or special-order a custom-built system
complete with floppy drives pre-installed.
Installing Floppy Drives
All Windows systems reserve the drive letters A: and B:
for floppy drives. You cannot name them anything other
than A: or B:, but you can configure a floppy to get either
drive letter. However, convention dictates that if you
have only one floppy drive, you should call it A:. The sec-
ond floppy drive is then called B:.
Floppy drives connect to the computer via a 34-pin
ribbon cable. If the cable supports two floppy drives, it
has a seven-wire twist in the middle to differentiate elec-
tronically between the A: and B: drives. Given that the
majority of users do not want two floppy drives, many
system makers have dropped the twist and saved a cou-
ple of pennies on a simpler cable (Figure 10.4).
By default, almost all PCs (well, the ones that still
support floppy drives) first try to boot to a floppy before
any other boot device, looking for an operating system.
This process enables technicians to insert a floppy disk
into a sick computer to run programs when the hard
drives fail. It also means hackers can insert bootable
floppy disks into servers and do bad things. You do have
a choice, however, because most systems have special
CMOS settings with which you can change this default
boot order to something other than the default drive A:
and then C:; I’ll show you how in a minute.
Inserting Ribbon Cables
Look at the floppy cable in Figure 10.4. Notice the con-
nector on the left side. This connector, identical to the
other connector on the same cable, plugs into the floppy
controller on the motherboard, as shown in Figure 10.5.
Notice how clearly the motherboard has pin 1 marked in
Figure 10.5. Not all motherboards are so clear. Make sure
to orient the cable so that the colored stripe on the side of
the cable is aligned with pin 1.
Here are a few tips on cable orientation. (By the way, these rules work
for all ribbon cables, not just floppy cables.) Ribbon cable connectors usually
have a distinct orientation notch in the middle. If your cable connector has
an orientation notch and the controller socket has a slot in which the orienta-
tion notch fits, your job is easy (Figure 10.6).
Unfortunately, not all connectors use the orientation notch. Try looking
in the motherboard book. All motherboard books provide a graphic of the
motherboard showing the proper orientation position. Look at other ribbon
Chapter 10: Removable Media

• Figure 10.4

cables on the motherboard. In almost all motherboards, all plugs orient the
same way. Last of all, just guess! You will not destroy anything by inserting
the cable backward. When you boot up, the floppy drive will not work. This
is not a big deal; turn off the system and try again.
After you insert the floppy ribbon cable into the floppy controller, you
need to insert the ribbon cable into the floppy drive. Watch out here! You
still need to orient the cable by pin 1—all the rules of ribbon cable insertion
apply here, too. Before you plug in the floppy ribbon cable to the floppy
drive, you need to know which connector on the cable to use; it makes a big
difference. The specific connector that you insert into the floppy drive deter-
mines its drive letter.
If the floppy drive is installed on the end connector, it becomes the A:
drive; if the drive is installed on the middle connector, it is the B: drive
(Figure 10.7). If you’re installing only one floppy, make sure you install it in
the A: drive position.

In the past, the CompTIA A+
certification exams have been
very focused on the pins on ca-
bles! Know the number (34) and
orientation (pin 1 to pin 1) for
the pins on the floppy drive rib-
bon cable.

Power
Floppy drives need electricity to work, just like every other
device in the PC. Modern 3½-inch floppy drives use the small
mini power connector. Be careful! Inserting a mini connector
incorrectly is easy, and if you install it incorrectly, you’ll de-
stroy the floppy drive and make what we call “The Nasty
Smell.” Look at Figure 10.8, a bottom view of a properly in-
stalled mini connector—note the chamfers (beveled edges)
that show correct orientation. The problem lies in the plastic
used to make the connector. The plastic connector bends eas-
ily, so even the least brawny techs can put the plug in a mini
connector backward or hit only three of the four pins.
Great! You have installed a floppy drive! Once you have
physically installed the floppy drive, it’s time to go into
CMOS.
CMOS
After the floppy drive is installed, you need to configure the CMOS settings,
which must correspond to the capacities of the drives. Look in your CMOS
for a menu called “Standard CMOS Features” (or something similar to that)
to see your floppy settings. Most CMOS setups configure the A: drive by de-
fault as a 3½-inch, 1.44-MB drive, so in most cases the floppy is already con-
figured. Simply double-check the setting in CMOS; if it’s okay, exit without
changing anything. Figure 10.9 shows a typical CMOS setting for a single

minis, most power connectors

most impossible to install them
incorrectly unintentionally.

floppy drive. On the rare occasion that you require a setting other than the
typical 3½-inch, 1.44-MB A: drive, simply select the drive (A: or B:) and enter
the correct capacity.
Disabling the Boot Up Floppy Seek option tells the PC not to check the
floppy disk during the POST, which isn’t very handy except for slightly
speeding up the boot process (Figure 10.10).
Many CMOS setup utilities have an option called Floppy 3 Mode Support.
Refer to Figure 10.9 to see an example of a CMOS with this option. A Mode 3
floppy is a special 1.2-MB format used outside the United States, primarily
in Japan. Unless you live in Japan and use Mode 3 floppy disks, ignore this
option.
■Flash Memory
Flash memory, the same flash memory that replaced CMOS technology for
your system BIOS, found another home in PCs in the form of removable
mass storage devices. Flash memory comes in two families: USB thumb
drives and memory cards. USB thumb drives are flash devices that contain a
standard USB connection. “Memory card” is a generic term for a number of
tiny cards that are used in cameras, PDAs, and other devices. Both of these
families can manifest themselves as drives in Windows, but they usually
perform different jobs. USB thumb drives have replaced virtually all other
rewritable removable media as the way people transfer files or keep copies
of important programs. My thumb drives (yes, I have two on me at all times)
keep backups of my current work, important photos, and a stack of utilities I
need to fix computers. Memory cards are very small and make a great way
to store data on small devices and then transfer that data to your PC.

USB Thumb Drives
Moving data between computers is always a pain, and even more so since
digital photography and multimedia storage have littered hard drives with
huge files that won’t fit on a single floppy disk. The latest entry into the
floppy disk replacement sweepstakes is a winner: the USB flash memory
drive, also known as the USB thumb drive, jump drive, or flash drive. These
tiny new drives are incredibly popular (Figure 10.11). For a low price in US$,
you can get an 8-GB thumb drive that holds as much data as 5600 standard
3½-inch floppy disks.
The smallest thumb drives are slightly larger than an
adult thumbnail; others are larger and more rounded. The
drives are hot-swappable in Windows 2000/XP/Vista. You
simply plug one into any USB port and it appears as a re-
movable storage device in My Computer or Computer. Af-
ter you plug the drive into a USB port, you can copy or
move data to or from your hard disk and then unplug the
unit and take it with you. You can read, write, and delete
files directly from the drive. Because these are USB devices,
they don’t need an external power source. The nonvolatile
flash memory is solid-state, so it’s shock resistant and is
supposed to retain data safely for a decade. One big im-
provement over floppies is cross-platform compatibility—
you can transfer files among Macintosh, Windows, and
Linux operating systems.
The latest systems enable you to boot to a thumb drive. With a bootable
thumb drive you can replace bootable floppies, CDs, and DVDs with fast
flash drives. Making a thumb drive bootable is a bit of a challenge, so most
of the classic bootable-utility CD makers have created USB versions that
seek out your thumb drive and add an operating system with the utilities
you wish to use. Most of these are simply versions of Linux-based live CDs.
At this point there’s no single magic USB thumb drive to recommend, be-
cause bootable USB drives are still quite new, and updated versions come
out almost daily. If you just have to try this new technology now, check out
the GParted LiveUSB at http://gparted.sourceforge.net and click on the
Live CD/USB/PXE link.
Flash Cards
Flash cards are the way people store data on small appliances. Every digital
camera, virtually every PDA, and many cell phones come with slots for
some type of memory card. Memory cards come in a number of incompati-
ble formats, so let’s start by making sure you know the more common ones.
CompactFlash
CompactFlash (CF) is the oldest, most complex, and physically largest of all
removable flash media cards (Figure 10.12). Roughly one inch wide, CF
cards use a simplified PCMCIA bus (see Chapter 14, “Learning Portable
Computing,” for details) for interconnection. CF cards come in two sizes: CF
I (3.3 mm thick) and CF II (5 mm thick). CF II cards are too thick to fit into CF
I slots.
Chapter 10: Removable Media
319
• Figure 10.11
USB thumb drives
• Figure 10.12
CF card

Clever manufacturers have repurposed the CF form factor to create the
microdrive (Figure 10.13). Microdrives are true hard drives, using platters
and read/write heads that fit into the tiny CF form factor. Microdrives are
slower and use more power than flash drives and, when they were first in-
troduced, cost much less than an equivalent CF flash card. From the user’s
standpoint, CF flash cards and microdrives look and act exactly the same
way, although the greater power consumption of microdrives makes them
incompatible with some devices. These days, microdrives have been sur-
passed in size, speed, and cost by their flash cousins and have become more
difficult to find.
SmartMedia
SmartMedia came out as a competitor to CF cards and for a few years was
quite popular in digital cameras (Figure 10.14). The introduction of SD me-
dia reduced SmartMedia’s popularity, and no new devices use this media.
Secure Digital
Secure Digital (SD) cards are arguably the most common flash media format
today. About the size of a small postage stamp, you’ll see SD cards in just
about any type of device that uses flash media. SD comes in two types: the
original SD and SDIO. SD cards store only data. The more advanced SDIO
(the “IO” denoting input/output rather than storage) cards also support de-
vices such as GPSs and cameras. If you want to use an SDIO device, you
must have an SDIO slot. There is no way to tell an SD slot from an SDIO slot,
so read the technical specs for your device!
SD cards also come in three tiny forms called SD, Mini Secure Digital
(MiniSD), and Micro Secure Digital (MicroSD) cards. They’re extremely pop-
ular in cellular phones that use flash memory, but see little use in other de-
vices. Figure 10.15 shows the three forms of SD cards.
SD cards come in three storage capacities. Standard SD cards store from
4 MB to 4 GB, Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) cards store 4 GB to 32 GB,
and Secure Digital Extended Capacity (SDXC) cards have a storage capacity of
32 GB to 2 TB. Early SD card readers and devices cannot read the SDHC or
SDXC cards, though the latter standards provide backward compatibility.
320

SmartMedia
SD cards developed out of an
older, slower flash memory tech-
nology called MultiMediaCard
(MMC). If you happen to have an
MMC card lying around, you can
use it in almost any SD card slot.
SD cards are a little thicker than
MMC cards, though, so the re-
verse is not true.
• Figure 10.15
SD, MiniSD, and MicroSD cards

Memory Stick
Sony always likes to use proprietary formats, and their Memory Stick
flash memory is no exception. If you own something from Sony and it
uses flash memory, you’ll need a Memory Stick (Figure 10.16). There
are several Memory Stick formats, including Standard, Pro, Duo, Pro
Duo, and Micro.
xD Picture Card
The proprietary Extreme Digital (xD) Picture Cards (Figure 10.17) are
about half the size of an SD card. They’re almost exclusively used in
Olympus and Fujifilm digital cameras, although Olympus (the de-
veloper of the xD technology) produces a USB housing so you can
use an xD Picture Card like any other USB flash memory drive. The
xD Picture Cards come in three flavors: original, Standard (Type M),
and Hi-Speed (Type H). The Standard cards are slower than the
original cards but offer greater storage capacity. The Hi-Speed cards
are two to three times faster than the others and enable you to cap-
ture full-motion video—assuming the camera has that capability,
naturally!
Card Readers
Whatever type of flash memory you use, your PC must have a card reader to
access the data on the card directly. A number of inexpensive USB card
readers are available today (Figure 10.18), and some PCs, especially those
tuned to home theater use, often come with built-in readershandy to have
when someone pulls out an SD card and says “Let’s look at the pictures I just
took!” Of course, if the person just happened to bring her camera and the
usually proprietary USB cable along, you could connect the camera to the
PC and pull pictures in that way. Just make sure you have spare batteries,
too! Wouldn’t a card reader be a more elegant solution?
Whichever type of flash memory you have, understand that it acts ex-
actly like a hard drive. If you wish, you can format a memory card as well as
copy, paste, and rename files.
■Optical Discs
CD, DVD, and BD-media drives and discs come in a variety of flavors
and formats, enabling you to back up data, record music, master home
videos, and much, much more. Optical disc is the generic term for all
those different types of shiny, 12-centimeter-wide discs that, if you’re a
slob like me, collect around your computer like pizza boxes. The drives
that support them are called optical drives. This section examines optical
discs and drives in detail.
CD stands for compact disc, a medium that was originally designed
more than 20 years ago as a replacement for vinyl records. The CD now
reigns as the primary method of long-term storage for sound and data. The
digital versatile disc (DVD) first eliminated VHS cassette tapes from the
commercial home movie market, and has also grown into a contender for

backupsandhigh-capacitystorage.Blu-ray Disc (BD) eliminatedtheHigh-Defini-
tion DVD (HD DVD) format and may very well supersede DVD in the future as
the high-definition video and data storage war wages on.
Going beyond those big three household names, the term optical disc re-
fers to technologies such as CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD, DVD+RW, HD
DVD, BD-R, BD-RE, and so on. Each of these technologies will be discussed
in detail in this chapter—for now, understand that although the term optical
disc describes a variety of exciting formats, they all basically boil down to
the same physical object: that little shiny disc.
CD-Media
The best way to understand the world of optical discs is to sort out the many
types of technologies available, starting with the first: the compact disc. All
you’re about to read is relevant and fair game for the CompTIA A+ Essen-
tials exam. Begin by looking at how CDs work.
How CDs Work
CDs—the discs that you buy in music stores or may find in software boxes—
store data via microscopic pits. CD producers use a powerful laser to burn
these pits into a glass master CD. Once the CD producer creates a master,
expensive machines create plastic copies, using a very high-tolerance injection-
molding process. The copies are coated with a reflective metallic covering
and then finished with lacquer for protection. CDs store data on only one
side of the disc—we don’t flip a CD as we used to flip vinyl records. Did I
just sound really old? The data on a CD is near the top of the CD, where the
label is located (Figure 10.19).
322
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 10.19
Location of the data

Many
people
believe
that
scratching a CD on the bottom
makes it unreadable. This is un-
true. If you scratch a CD on the bot-
tom (the shiny side), just polish out
the scratches—assuming that they
aren’t too deep—and reread the
CD. A number of companies sell
inexpensive CD-polishing kits. It’s
the scratches on the top of the disc
that wreak havoc on CDs. Avoid
writing on the top with anything
other than a soft-tipped pen, and
certainly don’t scratch the top!
CD readers (such as the one in
your car or the one in your PC) use
a laser and mirrors to read the data
from the CD. The metallic cover-
ing of the CD makes a highly reflective surface; the pits create interruptions
in that surface, while the non-pitted spots, called lands, leave it intact. The la-
ser picks up on the reflected pattern that the pits and lands create, and the
CD drive converts this pattern into binary ones and zeros. Because the pits
are so densely packed on the CD, a vast amount of data can be stored: a stan-
dard CD holds up to 5.2 billion bits, or 650 million bytes, of data.
CD Formats
The first CDs were designed for playing music and organized the
music in a special format called CD-Digital Audio (CDDA), which we
usually just call CD-audio. CD-audio divides the CD’s data into
variable-length tracks; on music CDs, each song gets one track.
CD-audio is an excellent way to store music, but it lacks any error
checking, file support, or directory structure, making it a terrible
way to store data. For this reason, The Powers That Be created a special
method for storing data on a CD, calledare you readyCD-ROM.
The CD-ROM format divides the CD into fixed sectors, each holding
2353 bytes.
Most CD-ROM drives also support a number of older, less well-
known formats. You may never come across these formats—CD-I,
CD-ROM/XA, and so forth—although you may see them listed
among compatible formats on the packaging for a new drive or with
a program like Nero InfoTool (Figure 10.20). Don’t let these oddball
formats throw you—with few exceptions, they’ve pretty much
fallen by the wayside. All CD-ROM drives read all of these formats,
assuming that the system is loaded with the proper software.
The CD-ROM format is something like a partition in the hard
drive world. CD-ROM may define the sectors (and some other infor-
mation), but it doesn’t enable a CD-ROM disc to act like a hard drive,
with a file structure, directories, and such. To make a CD-ROM act
like a hard drive, there’s another layer of formatting that defines the
file system used on the drive.

Repairing a CD-ROM
To revive scratched CD-ROMs and other CD-media in the comfort of
your home or office, get a CD polishing kit and familiarize yourself with
its operation. Try This!
1.
Obtain a CD-polishing kit from your local computer store, or find
one online.
2.
Take a CD-ROM that you don’t mind potentially ruining and make
light scratches on the bottom of the disc. Be sure not to scratch
too heavily! Just try to replicate the everyday wear and tear that
you’ve probably seen on CD-ROMs before. If you have a disc that’s
already lightly scratched, that’s even better.
3.
Use the CD-polishing kit, following the provided instructions
exactly.

Crazy CD formats

At first glance you might think “Why don’t CD-ROMs just use a FAT or
an NTFS format like hard drives?” Well, first of all, they could. There’s no
law of physics that prevented the CD-ROM world from adopting any file
system. The problem is that the CD makers did not want CD-ROM to be tied
to Microsoft’s or Apple’s or anyone else’s file format. In addition, they
wanted non-PC devices to read CDs, so they invented their own file system
just for CD-ROMs called ISO-9660. This format is sometimes referred to by
the more generic term, CD File System (CDFS). The vast majority of data
CD-ROMs today use this format.
Over the years, extensions of ISO-9660 have addressed certain limitations,
such as the characters used in file and directory names, filename length, and
directory depth. It’s important to know these ISO-9660 extensions:
■
Joliet
Microsoft’s extension of ISO-9660. Macintosh and Linux also
support Joliet-formatted discs.
■
Rock Ridge
An open standard to provide UNIX file system
support for discs; rarely used outside of UNIX systems.
■
El Torito
Added support to enable bootable CD-media. All
bootable CDs use the El Torito standard, which is supported by the
BIOS on all modern PCs.
■
Apple Extensions
Apple’s added support for their HFS file
system. Windows systems cannot read these CDs without third-
party tools.
It is important to appreciate that all of these file systems are extensions,
not replacements for ISO-9660. That means a single CD/DVD can have both
regular ISO-9660 information and an extension. For example, it’s very com-
mon to have a CD-media that is ISO-9660 and Joliet. If you place the CD into
a device that cannot read Joliet, it will still be able to read the ISO-9660
information.
CD-ROM Speeds
The first CD-ROM drives processed data at roughly 150,000 bytes per sec-
ond (150 KBps), copying the speed from the original CD-audio format. Al-
though this speed is excellent for listening to music, the CD-ROM industry
quickly recognized that installing programs or transferring files from a CD-
ROM at 150 KBps was the electronic equivalent of watching paint dry. Since
the day the first CD-ROM drives for PCs hit the market, there has been a de-
sire to speed them up to increase their data throughput. Each increase in
speed is measured in multiples of the original 150-KBps drives and given an
× to show speed relative to the first (1×) drives. Here’s a list of the common
CD-ROM speeds, including most of the early speeds that are no longer
produced:
1× 150 KBps
10× 1500 KBps
40× 6000 KBps
2× 300 KBps
12× 1800 KBps
48× 7200 KBps
3× 450 KBps
16× 2400 KBps
52× 7800 KBps
4× 600 KBps
24× 3600 KBps
60× 9000 KBps
6× 900 KBps
32× 4800 KBps
72× 10800 KBps
8× 1200 KBps
36× 5400 KBps
324
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Keep in mind that these are maximum speeds that are rarely met in real-
life operation. You can, however, count on a 32× drive to read data faster
than an 8× drive. As multipliers continue to increase, so many other factors
come into play that telling the difference between a 48× and a 52× drive, for
example, becomes difficult. High-speed CD-ROM drives are so inexpen-
sive, however, that most folks buy the fastest drive possible—at least instal-
lations go faster!
CD-R
Making CD-ROMs requires specialized, expensive equipment and substan-
tial expertise, so a relatively small number of CD-ROM production compa-
nies do it. Yet, since the day the first CD-ROMs came to market, demand has
been terrific for a way that ordinary PC users could make their own CDs.
The CD industry made a number of attempts to create a technology that
would let users record, or burn, their own CDs.
In the mid-1990s, the CD industry introduced the CD-recordable
(CD-R) standard, which enables affordable CD-R drives, often re-
ferred to as CD burners, to add data to special CD-R discs. Any CD-
ROM drive can then read the data stored on the CD-R, and all CD-R
drives can read regular CD-ROMs. CD-R discs come in two varieties:
a 74-minute disc that holds approximately 650 MB, and an 80-minute
variety that holds approximately 700 MB (Figure 10.21). A CD-R
burner must be specifically designed to support the longer 80-minute
CD-R format, but most drives you’ll encounter can do this.
CD-R discs function similarly to regular CD-ROMs, although
the chemicals used to make them produce a brightly colored record-
ing side on almost all CD-R discs. CD-ROM discs, in contrast, have a
silver recording side. CD-R technology records data by using spe-
cial organic dyes embedded into the disc. This dye is what gives the
CD-R its distinctive bottom color. CD-R burners have a second burn
laser, roughly ten times as powerful as the read laser, that heats the
organic dye. This causes a change in the reflectivity of the surface,
creating the functional equivalent of a CD-ROM’s pits.
Once the CD-R drive burns data onto a CD-R, the data cannot be
erased or changed short of destroying the disc itself. Early CD-R
drives required that the entire disc be burned in one burn session,
wasting any unused part of the CD-R disc. These were called single-
session drives. All modern CD-R drives are multisession drives so you can go
back and burn additional data onto the CD-R disc until the disc is full.
Multisession drives also have the capability to “close” a partially filled CD-R
so that no more data can be burned onto that disc.
CD-R drives have two speeds that matter: the record speed and the read
speed, both expressed as multiples of the 150-KBps speed of the original
CD-ROM drives. The record speed, which is listed first, is always equal to or
slower than the read speed. For example, a CD-R drive with a specification
of 8×24× would burn at 8× and read at 24×.
CD-RW
For all their usefulness, CD-R drives have disappeared from the market. Notice
that I didn’t say CD-R discs have disappeared; more CD-R discs are burned

now than ever before. Just as CD-R drives could both burn CD-R discs and read
CD-ROMs, a newer type of drive called CD-rewritable (CD-RW) took over the
burning market from CD-R drives. Although this drive has its own type of CD-
RW discs, it also can burn to CD-R discs, which are much cheaper.
CD-RW technology enables you not only to burn a disc, but to burn over
existing data on a CD-RW disc. This is not something you need for every
disc; for example, I create CD-R archives of my completed books to store the
text and graphics for posterity—this is data I want to access later but do not
need to modify. While I’m working on content for the CD that accompanies
this book, however, I may decide to delete an item; I couldn’t do that with a
CD-R. The CD-RW format, on the other hand, essentially takes CD-media to
the functional equivalent of a 650-MB floppy disk. Once again, CD-RW discs
look exactly like CD-ROM discs with the exception of a colored bottom side.
Figure 10.22 shows all three formats.
A CD-RW drive works by using a laser to heat an amorphous
(noncrystalline) substance that, when cooled, slowly becomes crystalline.
The crystalline areas are reflective, whereas the amorphous areas are not.
Because both CD-R and CD-RW drives require a powerful laser, making a
drive that could burn CD-Rs and CD-RWs was a simple process, and plain
CD-R drives disappeared almost overnight. Why buy a CD-R drive when a
comparably priced CD-RW drive could burn both CD-R and CD-RW discs?
CD-RW drive specs have three multiplier values. The first shows the
CD-R write speed, the second shows the CD-RW rewrite speed, and the
third shows the read speed. Write, rewrite, and read speeds vary tremen-
dously among the various brands of CD-RW drives; here are just a few rep-
resentative samples: 8×4×32×, 12×10×32×, and 48×24×48×.
One of the goals with the introduction of CD-RWs was the idea of mak-
ing a CD-RW act like a hard drive so you could simply drag a file onto the
CD-RW (or CD-R) and just as easily drag it off again. This goal was difficult
for two reasons: first, the different file formats made on-the-fly conversion
risky. Second, CD-RWs don’t store data exactly the same way as hard drives
and would quickly wear out if data were copied in the same manner.
Two developments, UDF and packet writing, enable you to treat a CD-
RW just like a hard drivewith a few gotchas. The not-so-new kid in town
with CD-media file formats is the universal data format (UDF). UDF is a re-
placement for ISO-9660 and all of its various extensions, resulting in a single
file format that any drive and operating system can read. UDF has taken
over the DVD world (all movie DVDs use this format) and is poised to also
become the CD-media file format in the near future. UDF handles very large

files and is excellent for all rewritable CD-media. UDF has been available for
quite a while, but until Windows Vista came out, no version of Windows
could write to UDF-formatted discs. They could read the discs, but if you
wanted to write to them in Windows you had to use one of a number of
third-party UDF tools such as Roxio’s DirectCD and Nero’s InCD. UDF also
supports a feature called Mount Rainier—better known as packet writing—
that works with UDF so you can copy individual files back and forth like a
hard drive. With UDF and packet writing, rewritable CD-media is as easy to
use as a hard drive.
Windows and CD-Media
Virtually all optical drives are
ATAPI-compliant, meaning they
plug into the ATA controllers on
the motherboard, just like a hard
drive, so you don’t need to install
drivers. You just plug in the drive
and, assuming you didn’t make
any physical installation mistakes,
the drive appears in Windows
(Figure 10.23).
Windows displays an optical drive in My Computer
or Computer with the typical optical drive icon and as-
signs it a drive letter. If you want to put data on a CD-R
disc, however, you need special burner software to get
that data onto the disc. Windows XP comes with burning
support—you just drop a CD-R disc into your CD-RW
drive, open the drive in My Computer, drag the files
you wish to copy, and click Write to Disc. Also, Win-
dows Media Player versions such as 9, 10, and 11 enable
you to create music and data CDs within Windows XP.
With Windows Vista, you can burn music and data di-
rectly to disc. Just put your CD-R into your CD-RW
drive and, if AutoPlay is set to detect blank CDs, the OS
presents you with the options to burn an audio CD by
using Windows Media Player or to burn files to disc by
using Windows. Almost every new CD-RW drive comes
with some type of burner software as well, so you
rarely need to go out and buy your own unless you
have a preference for a particular brand. Figure 10.24
shows the opening menu of one that I like, the popular
Nero optical disc burning program.
When I buy a new program on CD, the first thing I do is make a backup
copy; then I stash the original under lock and key. If I break, melt, or other-
wise destroy the backup, I quickly create a new one from the original. I can
easily copy the disc, because my system, like many, has both a regular
CD-ROM and a CD-RW drive (even though CD-RW drives read CD-ROM
discs). I can place a CD in the CD-ROM drive and a CD-R or CD-RW disc in
the CD-RW drive. Then I use a disk-copy application to create an exact rep-
lica of the CD quickly. CD-RW drives work great for another, bigger type of
backup: not the archival “put it on the disc and stash it in the closet” type of

Deleting Files from a CD-RW
Windows XP comes with built-in support for CD-Rs and CD-RWs. If
you have a CD-RW drive with Windows XP, copy a couple of files onto
a CD-RW and burn them to the disc. Now try to delete only one
fileyou can’t! That’s because no version of Windows before Vista sup-
ports packet writing. Try installing a copy of Roxio’s Creator 9 or Nero
2009 and try again on a fresh CD-RWit works! All third-party UDF
tools support packet writing.

backup but rather the daily/weekly backups that most of us do (or should
do!) on our systems. Using CD-R discs for these backups is wasteful; once a
disc fills up, you throw it away at the next backup. But with CD-RW, you
can use the same set of CD-RW discs time and again to perform backups.
Music CDs
Computers do not hold a monopoly on CD burning. Many companies offer
consumer CD burners that work with your stereo system. These come in a
wide variety of formats, but they’re usually dual-deck player/recorder
combinations. These recorders do not use regular CD-R or CD-RW discs. In-
stead, under U.S. law, these home recorders must use a slightly different
disc called a music CD-R. Makers of music CDs pay a small royalty for each
CD (and add it to your price). You can record to a music CD-R or CD-RW,
but you cannot record from one—the idea being to restrict duplication. If
you decide to buy one of these burners, make sure to buy the special music
CD-Rs. Music CD-Rs are designed specifically for these types of devices and
may not work well in a PC.
DVD-Media
For years, the video industry tried to create an optical-media replacement
for videotape. The 12-inch-diameter laserdisc format originally introduced
by Philips gained some ground in the 1980s and 1990s. But the high cost of
both the discs and the players, plus various marketing factors, meant there
was never a very large laserdisc market. You may still find one of them sit-
ting around, however, or you may know someone who invested in a small
collection during the laserdisc’s heyday.

The DVD was developed by a large consortium of electronics and enter-
tainment firms during the early 1990s and released as digital video discs in
1995. The transformation of DVD to a data storage medium quickly re-
quired a name change to digital versatile discs. You’ll still hear both terms
used. The industry also uses the term DVD-video to distinguish the movie
format from the data formats.
With the exception of the DVD logo stamped on all commercial
DVDs (Figure 10.25), DVDs look exactly like CD-media discs; but
that’s pretty much where the similarities end. DVD has become the
fastest growing media format in history and has completely over-
taken VHS as the preferred media for video. Additionally, one vari-
ant of DVD called DVD-RAM has enjoyed some success as a mass
storage medium.
The single best word to describe DVD is capacity. All previous
optical discs stored a maximum of 700 MB of data or 80 minutes of
low-quality video. The lowest-capacity DVD holds 4.37 GB of data,
or two hours of standard-definition video. The highest-capacity
DVD stores roughly 16 GB of data, or more than eight hours of
video! DVD achieves these amazing capacities by using a number of
technologies, but three are most important. First, DVD uses smaller
pits than CD-media, and packs them much more densely. Second,
DVD comes in both single-sided (SS) and double-sided (DS) formats.
As the name implies, a DS disc holds twice the data of an SS disc, but
it also requires you to flip the disc to read the other side. Third,
DVDs come in single-layer (SL) and dual-layer (DL) formats. DL for-
mats use two pitted layers on each side, each with a slightly differ-
ent reflectivity index. Table 10.1 shows the common DVD capacities.
DVD-Video
The most beautiful trait of DVD-video lies in its capability to store two hours
of video on one side. You drop in a DVD-video and get to watch an entire
movie without flipping it over. DVD-video supports TV-style 4:3 aspect-ratio
screens as well as 16:9 theater screens, but it is up to the producer to decide
which to use. Many DVD-video producers distribute DVD movies on DS
media with a 4:3 ratio on one side and 16:9 ratio on the other. DVD-video re-
lies on the MPEG-2 standard of video and audio compression to reach the
magic of two hours of video per side. Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG)
is a group of compression standards for both audio and video. The MPEG-2
standard offers resolutions of up to 1280 × 720 at 60 frames per second (fps),
with full CD-quality audio (standard DVDs only offer 480 vertical resolu-
tion, the same as regular television).

DVD-ROM
DVD-ROM is the DVD equiva-
lent of the standard CD-ROM
data format except that it’s capa-
ble of storing up to almost 16 GB
of data. Almost all DVD-ROM
drives also fully support DVD-
video, as well as most CD-ROM
formats. Most DVD drives sold
with PCs are DVD-ROM drives.
Recordable DVD
The IT industry has no fewer
than six distinct standards of re-
cordable DVD-media: DVD-ROM
for
general
use,
DVD-R
for
authoring, DVD-RW, DVD+R,
DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM. Both
DVD-R
standard
discs
and
DVD+R discs work like CD-Rs.
You can write to them but not
erase or alter what’s written.
DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and DVD-
RAM discs can be written and
rewritten,
just
like
CD-RW
discs. Most DVD drives can
read all formats with the excep-
tion of DVD-RAM. DVD-RAM
is the only DVD format that uses
a cartridge, so it requires a spe-
cial drive (Figure 10.26). DVD-
RAM is still around but fading
away.
Although there is little if any
difference in quality among the
standards, the competition be-
tween
corporations
pushing
their preferred standards has
raged for years. Sony and
Phillips, for example, pushed
the + series, whereas other man-
ufacturers pushed the – series.
Worse, no recordable DVD drive manufactured before 2003 could write any
format except its own. You could plop down US$250 on a brand-new DVD+
RW drive and still find yourself unable to edit a disc from your friend who
used the DVD-RW format! Half of the time, the drive couldn’t even read the
competing format disc.
The situation is much better today, as DVD±RW combo drives in PCs
play just about anyone else’s DVDs. The challenge is DVD players. If you
want to make a DVD of your family picnic and then play it on the DVD

Tech Tip
MPEG Standards
Reproducing video and sound on the PC provides interesting challenges for developers.
How do you take a motion picture from film, translate it into ones and zeros that the
CPU understands, process those bits, and then send high-quality video and sound to the
monitor and speakers for the pleasure of the computer user? How much data do you
think is required to display even a two-minute clip of a car racing through a city street,
in all the minute detail of the shops, people, screeching tires, road debris, and so on? For
that matter, how do you store the obviously huge amount of data required to do this?
To handle these chores, the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) has released
coding standards such as MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and MPEG-4. Each standard provides
a different compression algorithm, which makes the files manageable. The standards
also implement various technologies to handle movement, called motion compensa-
tion. The details of the standards matter a lot to the folks producing the movies and
other video and audio content, but here’s the short answer that should suffice for the
purposes of a PC tech.
MPEG-1 is the standard on which video and MP3, among other technologies, are
based. The most common implementations of this standard provide a resolution of 352 ×
240 at 30 fps. This video quality falls just below that of a conventional VHS video.
One very well-known subset of MPEG-1 is better known for audio than video.
MPEG-1 Layer 3, better known as MP3 format, dominates the world of audio. MP3
takes an uncompressed audio file and compresses it dramatically, but the algorithm is so
tight that the music that comes out of the speakers remains almost completely faithful to
the original audio file. To paraphrase a catchphrase from the 1980s—I want my MP3s!
MPEG-2 provides resolutions of 720 × 480 and 1280 × 720 at 60 fps (as well as
others), plus CD-quality audio, making it adequate for all major TV standards, even
HDTV. MPEG-2 is the standard that covers DVD-ROM technology—it can com-
press two hours of video into a file no larger than a few gigabytes. Although encoding
video into MPEG-2 format requires a computer with some serious firepower, even a
modest PC can decompress and play such a video.
The MPEG-4 standard is based on MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and Apple’s QuickTime
technology. MPEG-4 graphics and video files use what’s known as wavelet compres-
sion to create files that are more compact than either JPEG or QuickTime files. This
superior compression makes MPEG-4 popular for delivering video and images over
the Web. MPEG-4 higher-efficiency standards such as advanced video coding are in-
cluded with MPEG-4 and used for Blu-ray Discs. And notably, MPEG-4 provides In-
tellectual Property Management and Protection (IPMP), which supports digital
rights management.
MPEG-7 is designed to complement the previous standards as a fast and efficient
multimedia content searching tool.
MPEG-21 is concerned with and focuses on coding and digital rights. MPEG-21
uses a Rights Expression Language (REL) and a Rights Data Dictionary to protect
digital material from illicit file sharing.

player hooked to your television, take the time to read
the documentation for your player to make sure it reads
that particular DVD formatnot all players read all

Blu-ray Disc-Media
Blu-ray Disc is considered the next generation in optical
disc formatting and storage technology after CD and
DVD. Because of its near-perfect audio and video
quality; mass acceptance by industry-leading computer,
electronics, game, music, retail, and motion picture
companies; and huge storage capacities of up to 25 GB
(single-layer disc) and 50 GB (dual-layer disc), Blu-ray
Disc technology is expected to make CD and DVD opti-
cal media and devices obsolete.
Blu-ray Discs come in two sizes, standard and mini.
The standard size matches that of earlier optical discs,
such as CD-R and DVD-RW, and is what you’ll see used
in computers and for movies (Figure 10.27). The mini-
size discs are a lot smaller and, naturally, offer less stor-
age. You’ll find mini Blu-ray Discs in very high-end cam-
corders. Table 10.2 shows the details of the two formats.
Unlike with DVD discs, Blu-ray Disc offers no option
at this time of a double-sided disc. I wouldn’t be sur-
prised to see this option in the coming years.
Blu-ray Disc technology offers several advantages
over DVD aside from raw capacity. First, Blu-ray Disc
uses a blue-violet laser (hence the Blu in the name) with a
wavelength of 405 nm. (DVD uses a red laser technology
with a wavelength of 650 nm.) The 405-nm wavelength is
smaller and much more precise, enabling better use of
space during the creation process and ultimately result-
ing in a sharper image. Second, Blu-ray Disc can handle
high-definition (HD) video in resolutions far higher than
DVD. Finally, Blu-ray Disc supports many more video
compression schemes, giving producers more options
for putting content on discs.

BD-ROM
BD-ROM (read only) is the Blu-ray Disc equivalent of the standard DVD-
ROM data format except, as noted earlier, it can store much more data and
produces superior audio and video results. Almost all BD-ROM drives are
fully backward compatible and support DVD-video as well as most CD-
ROM formats. If you want to display the best possible movie picture quality
on your HDTV, you should get a Blu-ray Disc player and use Blu-ray Discs
in place of DVDs. Most new computer systems don’t come standard with
Blu-ray Disc drives installed. You can often custom-order a system with a
Blu-ray Disc drive or you can simply install one yourself. Figure 10.28
shows a Blu-ray Disc drive.
BD-R and BD-RE
Blu-ray Discs come in two writable formats, BD-R (for recordable) and BD-RE
(for rewritable). You can write to a BD-R disc one time. You can write to and
erase a BD-RE several times. There are also BD-R and BD-RE versions of
mini Blu-ray Discs.
Blu-ray Burners
Most Blu-ray Disc burners cost a lot (at the time of this writ-
ing) and are out of the price range for the average consumer,
but they will eventually be as common as the average
CD-RW or DVD-RW. Blu-ray Disc burners and other Blu-ray
Disc drives can be connected internally or externally to a
system. It is common for them to be connected externally
via Hi-Speed USB 2.0, FireWire, or eSATA or internally
through PATA, SATA, SCSI, or USB connections. Operating
systems such as Windows 2000, XP, Vista, and Windows 7
all support Blu-ray Disc burners and software. The software
you use for burning is totally up to you; however, as always,
you should follow the manufactured specifications for the
best results. Most multidrive Blu-ray Disc burners offer the
following support features:

Explain and install floppy disk drives
■
Floppy disk drives are becoming a thing of the
past as Microsoft and Intel push for legacy-free
computing. The small, 1.44-MB-capacity floppy
disks are being replaced by higher-capacity
removable media.
■
Floppy disks are constructed of a flexible magnetic
disc housed inside a square plastic case. The case
has a sliding protective cover that opens to reveal
a portion of the magnetic media when inside a
floppy drive. Read/write heads inside the floppy
disk drive move back and forth across the media,
reading or writing data as necessary.
■
During disk access, an LED on the front of the drive
lights up. Never eject a floppy disk when this light
is on.
■
Floppy disks have gone through several stages of
improvement, becoming smaller with each phase.
Pre-PC computers used an 8-inch floppy. Early PCs
used a 5¼-inch floppy. Modern floppy disks, which
appeared around 1986, are 3½ inches.
■
You may have a maximum of two floppy disk drives
in a system, and they must use either the drive
letter A: or B:; however, a single floppy disk drive
can be configured to use either drive letter. By
convention, if your system has only one floppy
disk drive, you should configure it as drive A:.
A 34-pin ribbon data cable is used to connect the
floppy disk drive to the motherboard; a 4-pin mini
connector supplies power. Attaching the data cable
backward won’t damage anything, but the drive
won’t work. If you attach the power connector
incorrectly, you risk damaging the drive.
■
Most floppy ribbon cables have three connectors
and a twist. The end without the twist connects to
the motherboard, matching the red stripe on the
cable with pin 1 of the motherboard connector. The
drive attached to the middle connector on the cable
receives the drive letter B:. The drive attached to
the other end of the cable (after the twist) is assigned
the drive letter A:.
■
After connecting a floppy disk drive, configure the
CMOS settings. Make sure the CMOS setting
matches your floppy disk drive size/capacity; for
example, 3½ inches and 1.44 MB.
Demonstrate the variations among flash drives and
other tiny drives
■
Flash memory includes USB thumb drives and
memory cards. USB thumb drives contain a standard
USB connection and have replaced many other
forms of removable media as the way to transfer
files. Memory cards, a generic term, are used in
digital cameras, PDAs, and other devices.
■
Thumb drives store much more data than floppies—
sometimes up to the equivalent of thousands of
floppy disks. They are hot-swappable in Windows
2000/XP/Vista and don’t require an external power
source, as they are powered directly from the USB
bus. Most new PCs enable you to boot from a USB
thumb drive.
■
Flash cards, which are used in portable devices
such as digital cameras, PDAs, and phones, come
in many varieties. The most common types are
CompactFlash, SmartMedia, Secure Digital, Memory
Stick, and Extreme Digital (xD) Picture Card.
CompactFlash cards are the oldest of these. At
about 1 inch wide, they use the PCMCIA bus and
come in two thicknesses: CF I at 3.3 mm thick and
CF II at 5 mm thick. SmartMedia competed directly
with CompactFlash and was used mainly in digital
cameras. The introduction of Secure Digital has
made SmartMedia all but obsolete. Secure Digital
is perhaps the most popular flash card today and
comes in two types: original SD and SDIO. Smaller
versions of Secure Digital cards, MiniSD and
MicroSD, are also available. Memory Stick, a
proprietary format from Sony, comes in several
formats, including Standard, Pro, Duo, Pro Duo,
and Micro. xD Picture Cards, developed by
Olympus, are about half the size of Secure Digital
cards and are used almost exclusively in digital
cameras.

■
No matter what type of flash card you have, you
need a card reader to access it. Some PCs have
built-in card readers. External USB card readers are
also available. Sometimes a device such as a digital
camera or PDA can double as a card reader.
Identify optical-media technology
■
CDs store data by using microscopic pits burned
into a glass master CD with a powerful laser.
Expensive machines create plastic copies of the
glass master that are then coated with a reflective
metallic coating. CDs store data on one side of the
disc only. The CD drive reads the pits and the non-
pitted areas (lands) and converts the pattern into
ones and zeros.
■
CDs come in many varieties. CD-Digital Audio is
for playing music, but it lacks error checking, file
support, and directory structure. CD-ROM discs are
for storing data. They use the ISO-9660 file system,
also known as CDFS. Extensions of ISO-9660 have
offered improvements to file and directory naming,
filename length, and directory depth and include
Joliet, Rock Ridge, El Torito, and Apple Extensions.
■
CD-ROM speeds have increased substantially from
the original 150 KBps. Increased speeds are
measured in multiples of 150 KBps, so a 10× CD-
ROM has a maximum speed of 1500 KBps.
■
CD-recordable (CD-R) discs hold either 650 MB or
700 MB and can store either audio or data. Special
organic dyes that give the CD-Rs their distinctive
bottom color aid in the burning process. A strong
laser in the CD drive heats the dye and changes the
reflectivity of the CD-R’s surface, resulting in a
reflective/less-reflective pattern that is converted
to ones and zeros. Once data is burned to a CD-R,
the data cannot be erased. With multisession
drives, you can burn data to a portion of a disc and
then go back later and burn more data to the disc.
CD-R discs are rated with two speeds: a write
speed followed by a read speed.
■
CD-rewritable (CD-RW) discs, unlike CD-Rs, enable
you to erase data and burn new data. CD-RWs are
rated with three speeds: write speed followed by
rewrite speed followed by read speed. The UDF
file format (the replacement for ISO-9660) handles
large files better than CDFS. Packet writing, a
feature used by UDF, allows you to copy files back
and forth to a CD-RW like a hard drive.
■
Most CD drives are ATAPI compliant and do not
need drivers installed for them to work. Windows XP
can burn CD-Rs and CD-RWs with no additional
software but cannot burn bootable CDs. If you
need to create a bootable CD, you need a third-
party application such as Ahead’s Nero Express.
Many companies offer standalone CD burners that
attach to your stereo system instead of your PC;
however, these machines use a different type of CD
called a music CD-R and are not compatible with
standard CD-R or CD-RW discs.
■
DVDs were released as digital video discs in 1995,
but as usage evolved to include data storage, the
name was changed to digital versatile disc. The
lowest-capacity DVD holds 4.37 GB of data. DVDs
offer much higher capacities than CDs, because
DVDs use smaller and more densely packed pits,
can be burned on both sides of the disc, and can
burn two layers of pits per side for a total of four
layers. DVD video uses the MPEG-2 video standard
and can store two hours of video on a single side.
■
DVD-ROM, the DVD equivalent of CD-ROM, can
store up to 16 GB of data. Recordable DVD-media
comes in many varieties: DVD-ROM for general
purpose, DVD-R for authoring, DVD+R, DVD-RW,
DVD+RW, and DVD-RAM. You can write to
DVD-R and DVD+R but not erase them. You can
both burn and erase DVD-RW, DVD+RW, and
DVD-RAM.
■
Standard Blu-ray Discs have storage capacities of
up to 25 GB (single-layer disc) and 50 GB (dual-
layer disc) and provide near-perfect picture quality.
■
You can write to a BD-R (recordable) disc one time.
You can erase and write to a BD-RE (rewritable)
several times.

installation tasks

2000, Windows XP, and
Windows Vista

problems

A
n operating system (OS) provides the fundamental link between the user
and the hardware that makes up the PC. Without an operating system, all
of the greatest, slickest PC hardware in the world is but so much copper, silicon,
and gold wrapped up as a big, beige paperweight (or, if you’re a teenaged boy, a
big, gleaming, black paperweight with a window and glowing fluorescent lights,
possibly shaped like a robot). The operating system creates the interface
between human and machine, enabling you to unleash the astonishing power
locked up in the sophisticated electronics of the PC to create amazing pictures,
games, documents, business tools, medical miracles, and much more.
This chapter takes you through the processes for installing and upgrading
Windows. It starts by analyzing the preinstallation tasks, steps not to be
skipped by the wise tech. The bulk of the chapter comes in the second section,
where you’ll learn about installing and upgrading Windows 2000, XP, and Vista.
Not all installations go smoothly, so section three looks at troubleshooting
installation issues. Section four walks you through the typical post-installation
tasks. The chapter finishes by examining what you’ve created in the installation
process, such as where the various operating system (OS) files reside and how
they interact to create a seamlessly booting new installation of Windows.

■Preparing for Installation
or Upgrade
Installing or upgrading an OS is like any good story: it has a beginning, a
middle, and an end. In this case, the beginning is the several tasks you need
to do before you actually do the installation or upgrade. If you do your
homework here, the installation process is a breeze, and the post-installation
tasks are minimal.
Don’t get discouraged at all of the preparation tasks. They usually go
pretty fast, and skipping them can cause you gobs of grief later when you’re
in the middle of installing and things blow up. Well, maybe there isn’t a real
explosion, but the computer might lock up and refuse to boot into anything
usable. With that in mind, look at the nine tasks you need to complete before
you insert that CD or DVD. Here’s the list; discussion follows:
1.
Identify hardware requirements.
2.
Verify hardware and software compatibility.
3.
Decide what type of installation to perform.
4.
Determine how to back up and restore existing data, if necessary.
5.
Select an installation method.
6.
Determine how to partition the hard drive and what file system
to use.
7.
Determine your computer’s network role.
8.
Decide on your computer’s language and locale settings.
9.
Plan for post-installation tasks.
Identify Hardware Requirements
Hardware requirements help you decide whether a computer system is a
reasonable host for a particular operating system. Requirements include the
CPU model, the amount of RAM, the amount of free hard disk space, and
the video adapter, display, and storage devices that may be required to in-
stall and run the operating system. They are stated as minimums or, more
recently, as recommended minimums. Although you could install an oper-
ating system on a computer with the old minimums that Microsoft pub-
lished, they were not realistic if you wanted to actually accomplish work.
With the last few versions of Windows, Microsoft has published recom-
mended minimums that are much more realistic. You will find the pub-
lished
minimums
on
the
packaging
and
at
Microsoft’s
Web
site
(www.microsoft.com). Later in this chapter, I’ll also tell you what I recom-
mend as minimums for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Vista.
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows
339

Verify Hardware and Software Compatibility
Assuming your system meets the requirements, you next need to find out
how well Windows supports the brand and model of hardware and applica-
tion software you intend to use under Windows. You have two basic
sources for this information: Microsoft and the manufacturer of the device
or software. How do you actually access this information? Use the Web!
If you’re installing Windows XP or Vista, the Setup Wizard automati-
cally checks your hardware and software and reports any potential con-
flicts. But please don’t wait until you are all ready to install to check this out.
With any flavor of Windows, first do your homework.
Microsoft goes to great lengths to test any piece of hardware that might
be used in a system running Windows through their Windows Logo’d Prod-
uct List (Figure 11.1). This list, formerly known as the Hardware Compatibility
List (HCL), is the definitive authority as to whether your component is com-
patible with the OS. Every component listed on the Windows Logo’d Prod-
uct List Web site has been extensively tested to verify that it works with
Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7 and is guaranteed by
Microsoft to work with your installation. The URL for the Windows Logo’d
Product
List
is
www.microsoft.com/whdc/hcl/default.mspx.
Sadly,
Microsoft no longer maintains a compatibility list specifically for Windows
2000, but in general, products compatible with XP will also be compatible
with 2000.
When you install a device that’s not been tested by Microsoft, a rather
scary screen appears (Figure 11.2). This doesn’t mean the component won’t
340
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
You’ll occasionally hear the
HCL or Windows Logo’d Product
List referred to as the Windows
Catalog. The Windows Catalog
was a list of supported hardware
Microsoft would add to the Win-
dows installation CD. The
Windows Logo’d Product List
Web site is the modern tech’s
best source, so use that rather
than any printed resources.
• Figure 11.1
Windows Logo’d Product List

work, only that it’s not been tested. Not all component makers go
through the rather painful process of getting the Microsoft approval
so they can list their component in the Windows Logo’d Product
List. As a general rule, unless the device is more than five years old,
go ahead and install it. If it still doesn’t work, you can simply
uninstall it later.
Don’t panic if you don’t see your device on the list; many sup-
ported devices aren’t on it. Check the optical discs that came with
your hardware for proper drivers. Better yet, check the manufac-
turer’s Web site for compatible drivers. Even when the Windows
Logo’d Product List lists a piece of hardware, I still make a point of
checking the manufacturer’s Web site for newer drivers.
When preparing to upgrade, check with the manufacturers of
the applications already installed in the previous OS. If there are
software compatibility problems with the versions you have, the
manufacturer should provide upgrade packs that you can install
during the Windows setup process.
Decide What Type of Installation to Perform
You can install Windows in several ways. A clean installation of an OS in-
volves installing it onto an empty hard drive with no previous OS installed.
An upgrade installation means installing an OS on top of an earlier installed
version, thus inheriting all previous hardware and software settings. You
can combine versions of Windows by creating a multiboot installation. In-
stalling usually involves some sort of optical disc, but other methods also
exist. Let’s look at all the options.
Clean Installation
A clean installation usually begins with a completely empty hard disk. The
advantage to doing a clean installation is that you don’t carry problems
from the old OS over to the new one, but the disadvantage is that you have
to reinstall all applications and reconfigure the desktop and each applica-
tion to the user’s preferences. You perform a clean installation by resetting
your CMOS to tell the system to boot from the optical drive before your hard
drive. You then boot off of a Windows installation disc, and Windows gives
you the opportunity to partition and format the hard drive and then install
Windows.
Upgrade Installation
In an upgrade installation, the new OS installs into the same folders as the
old OS, or in tech speak, the new installs on top of the old. The new OS re-
places the old OS but retains all saved data and inherits all of the previous
settings (such as font styles, desktop colors and background, and so on),
hardware, and applications. You don’t have to reinstall your favorite
programs!
To begin the upgrade of Windows, you must run the appropriate pro-
gram from the optical disc. This usually means inserting a Windows instal-
lation disc into your system while your old OS is running, which starts the
installation program. Then, to do an upgrade, you indicate that the new

CompTIA tests you on know-
ing how to upgrade a Windows
9x or Windows NT system to
Windows 2000 or Windows XP
and how to upgrade from Win-
dows XP to Windows Vista. You

dows 9x or NT for the tests, but
you do need to know how to up-
grade them.
Before starting an OS up-
grade, make sure you have shut
down all other open applications!

version of Windows should install into a directory that already contains an
installation of Windows (it will do this by default). You will be asked
whether it is an upgrade or a new installation; if you select new installation,
it will remove the existing OS before installing.
If for some reason the Windows 2000 or Windows XP installation pro-
gram doesn’t start automatically, go to My Computer, open the installation
disc, and locate WINNT32.EXE. This program starts an upgrade to Win-
dows 2000 or XP. In Windows Vista, open the disc in Windows Explorer and
run Setup.exe in the disc’s root directory, which starts the Vista upgrade.
Multiboot Installation
A third option that you need to be aware of is the dual boot or multiboot in-
stallation. Both Windows 2000 and Windows XP can install in a separate
folder from your existing copy of Windows so you can put both operating
systems on the same partition. Then every time your computer boots, you’ll
get a menu asking you which version of Windows you wish to boot.
Multiboot requires that you format your active partition with a file system
that every operating system you install can use. This hasn’t been much of a
problem since the Windows 9x family stopped being relevant, because
there’s really no reason to use anything other than NTFS. Windows Vista
doesn’t let you define its install folder, so to multiboot Vista and XP, for ex-
ample, you’d need to install each OS on a different partition.
Other Installation Methods
In medium to large organizations, more advanced installation methods are
often employed, especially when many computers need to be configured
identically. A common method is to place the source files in a shared direc-
tory on a network server. Then, whenever a tech needs to install a new OS, it
is a simple task of booting up the computer, connecting to the source loca-
tion on the network, and starting the installation from there. This method
alone has many variations and can be automated with special scripts that
automatically select the options and components needed. The scripts can
even install the necessary applications at the end of the OS installation—all
without user intervention once the installation has been started.
Another type of installation that is very popular for re-creating standard
configurations is an image installation. An image is a complete copy of a
hard disk volume on which an operating system and, usually, all required
application software programs have been preinstalled. Images can be stored
on optical discs, in which case the tech runs special software on the com-
puter that copies the image onto the local hard drive. Images can also be
stored on special network servers, in which case the tech connects to the im-
age server by using special software and copies the image from the server to
the local hard drive. A leader in this technology has been Norton Ghost,
which is available from Symantec. Other similar programs are Clonezilla
and Acronis’s True Image.
Beginning with Windows 2000 Server, Microsoft added Remote Installa-
tion Services (RIS), which can be used to initiate either a scripted installation
or an installation of an image.

Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Tech Tip
Multiboot
Configuration
When configuring a computer for
multibooting, there are two basic
rules: first, you must format the
system partition in a file system
that is common to all installed
operating systems, and second,
you must install the operating
systems in order from oldest to
newest.
Scripting OS and application
installations is a full-time job in
many organizations. Many
scripting tools and methods are
available from both Microsoft
and third-party sources.

Determine How to Back Up and Restore
Existing Data, If Necessary
Whether you are installing or upgrading, you may need to back up existing
user data first, because things can go very wrong either way, and the data on
the hard drive might be damaged. You’ll need to find out where the user is
currently saving data files. If they are saving onto the local hard drive, it
must be backed up before the installation or replacement takes place, to pre-
serve the data. However, if all data has been saved to a network location,
you are in luck, because the data is safe from damage during installation.
If the user saves data locally, and the computer is connected to a net-
work, save the data, at least temporarily, to a network location until after the
upgrade or installation has taken place. If the computer is not connected to a
network but the computer has a burnable optical drive, copy the data to
DVDs. You can also use an external hard drive, which is a handy thing for
any tech to have. Wherever you save the data, you will need to copy or re-
store any lost or damaged data back to the local hard disk after the
installation.
If you plan to migrate a user from one system to another, here’s where
you might start the process by running the Files and Settings Transfer Wiz-
ard (Windows XP) or Windows Easy Transfer (Windows Vista). You’ll com-
plete that process during the post-installation tasks. Rather than discuss the
process twice, I leave the full discussion on migration for the “Post-Installa-
tion Tasks” section later in this chapter.
Select an Installation Method
Once you’ve backed up everything important, you need to select an installa-
tion method. You have two basic choices: insert the installation disc into the
drive and go, or install over a network. The latter method falls into the realm
of CompTIA Network+ technicians or even network administrators, so this
book assumes you’ll install from disc.
Determine How to Partition the Hard Drive
and What File System to Use
If you are performing a clean installation, you need to decide ahead of time
how to partition the disk space on your hard disk drive, including the num-
ber and size of partitions and the file system (or systems) you will use.
Actually, in the decision process, the file system comes first, and then the
space issue follows, as you will see.
This was a much bigger issue back in the days when older operating sys-
tems couldn’t use newer file systems, but now that every Windows OS that
you could reasonably want to install supports NTFS, there’s really no reason
to use anything else. You still might have a reason to partition your drive,
but as for choosing a file system, your work is done for you.
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows
343

Determine Your Computer’s Network Role
The question of your computer’s network role comes up in one form or an-
other during a Windows installation. A Windows computer can have one of
several roles relative to a network (in Microsoft terms). One role, called
standalone, is actually a non-network role, and it simply means that the com-
puter does not participate on a network. You can install any version of Win-
dows on a standalone computer, and this is the only role that a Windows XP
Home computer can play on a network. Every other modern version of Win-
dows can be a member of either a workgroup or a domain (or, if you’re using
Windows 7, a HomeGroup). You will learn more about the workgroup and
domain member roles in Chapter 16, “Learning Local Area Networking.”
Decide on Your Computer’s Language
and Locale Settings
These settings are especially important for Windows operating systems be-
cause they determine how date and time information is displayed and
which math separators and currency symbols are used for various locations.
Plan for Post-Installation Tasks
After installing Windows, you may need to install the latest service pack or
updates. You may also need to install updated drivers and reconfigure any
settings, such as network settings, that were found not to work. You will also
need to install and configure any applications (word processor, spreadsheet,
database, e-mail, games, etc.) required by the user of the computer. Finally,
don’t forget to restore any data backed up before the installation or upgrade.
■Installing and Upgrading
Windows
At the most basic level, installing any operating system follows a fairly stan-
dard set of steps. You turn on the computer, insert an operating system disc
into the optical drive, and follow the installation wizard until you have ev-
erything completed. Along the way, you’ll accept the End User License
Agreement (EULA) and enter the product key that says you’re not a pirate;
the product key is invariably located on the installation disc’s case. At the
same time, there are nuances between installing Windows 2000 or upgrad-
ing to Windows Vista that every CompTIA A+ certified tech must know, so
this section goes through many installation processes in some detail.
Installing or Upgrading to
Windows 2000 Professional
On the face of it, installing Windows 2000 Professional seems fairly simple.
You insert the installation disc, access the setup routine, and go! But that
conceptualization does not hold up in practice.

Hardware Requirements
The minimum specs represent what Microsoft says you need so you can in-
stall the Windows 2000 Professional OS. However, you need to take these
specifications and at least double them if you want to be happy with your
system’s performance.

If your test system(s) exceeds the recommended configuration, all the
better. You can never have too fast a processor or too much hard disk space.
Installing or Upgrading to Windows
XP Professional
You prepare for installing Windows XP just as you do for installing
Windows 2000. Windows XP has a few different aspects to it that are worth
considering as a separate issue.
Upgrade Paths
You can upgrade to Windows XP Professional from all of the following ver-
sions of Windows:
■
Windows 98 (all versions)
■
Windows Me
■
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation (Service Pack 5 and later)
■
Windows 2000 Professional (including service packs)
■

XP Hardware Requirements
Hardware requirements for Windows XP Professional are higher than for
previous versions of Windows, but are still very low by modern hardware
standards.

Hardware and Software Compatibility
You’ll need to check hardware and software compatibility before installing
Windows XP Professional—as either an upgrade or a new installation. Of
course, if you purchase a computer with Windows XP preinstalled, you’re
spared this task, but you’ll still need to verify that the application software
you plan to add to the computer will be compatible. Luckily, Microsoft in-
cludes the Upgrade Advisor on the Windows XP disc.
Upgrade Advisor
You would be hard-pressed these days to find a com-
puter incapable of running Windows XP, but if you are ever uncertain about
whether a computer you excavated at an archeological dig can run XP, fear
not! The Upgrade Advisor is the first process that runs on the XP installation
disc. It examines your hardware and installed software (in the case of an up-
grade) and provides a list of devices and software that are known to have is-
sues with XP. Be sure to follow the suggestions on this list.
You can also run the Upgrade Advisor separately from the Windows XP
installation. You can run it from the Windows XP disc. Microsoft used to of-
fer the XP Upgrade Advisor on its Web site, but searching for it now will just
redirect you to the Vista Upgrade Advisor (more on that later), so running it
from the disc is the way to go nowadays.
Booting into Windows XP Setup
The Windows XP discs are bootable, and Microsoft no longer includes a pro-
gram to create a set of setup boot disks. This should not be an issue, because
PCs manufactured in the past several years can boot from the optical drive.
This system BIOS setting, usually described as boot order, is controlled
through a PC’s BIOS-based Setup program.
In the unlikely event that your lab computer can’t be made to boot from
its optical drive, you can create a set of six (yes, six!) Windows XP setup boot
floppy disks by using a special program you can download from Microsoft’s
Web site. Note that Microsoft provides separate boot disk programs for XP
Home and XP Pro.
346
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Registration Versus Activation
During setup, you will be prompted to register your product and activate it.
Many people confuse activation with registration, but these are separate op-
erations. Registration tells Microsoft who the official owner or user of the
product is, providing contact information such as name, address, company,
phone number, and e-mail address. Registration is still entirely optional.
Activation is a way to combat software piracy, meaning that Microsoft
wishes to ensure that each license for Windows XP is used solely on a single
computer. It’s more formally called Microsoft Product Activation (MPA).
Mandatory Activation Within 30 Days of Installation
Activation is manda-
tory, but you can skip this step during installation. You have 30 days in which
to activate the product, during which time it works normally. If you don’t ac-
tivate it within that time frame, it will be disabled. Don’t worry about forget-
ting, though, because once it’s installed, Windows XP frequently reminds you

Running the Upgrade Advisor
If you have a PC with Windows XP or an older version of Windows, you
should know how to run the Upgrade Advisor on your system, so try
this:
1.
Insert the Windows XP installation disc. If Autorun is enabled,
the Welcome to Microsoft Windows XP screen appears. If this
does not appear, select Start | Run, enter the following, and then
click OK:
d:\SETUP.EXE
(Where d is the drive letter for the optical drive.)
2.
At the Welcome to Microsoft Windows XP screen, select Check
System Compatibility to start the Upgrade Advisor. On the
following page, select Check My System Automatically.
3.
In the Upgrade Advisor dialog box, select the first choice if you
have an Internet connection. If you don’t have an Internet
connection, select No, Skip This Step and Continue Installing
Windows. (Don’t worry, you aren’t really going to install yet.)
4.
Click Next. The Upgrade Advisor shows the tasks that Dynamic
Update is performing, and then it restarts Setup.
5.
After Setup restarts, you’ll be back at the same page in the
Upgrade Advisor. This time, select No, Skip This Step and
Continue Installing Windows, and click Next. The Upgrade
Report page appears next. You can save the information in a file
by clicking Save As and selecting a location.
6.
Read the findings that the Upgrade Advisor presents. If a
problem was found, click the Full Details button for instructions,
and be sure to follow them. When you have recorded any
necessary instructions, click Finish.

to activate it with a balloon message over the tray area of the taskbar. The
messages even tell you how many days you have left.
Activation Mechanics
Here’s how prod-
uct activation works. When you choose to
activate, either during setup or later when
XP reminds you to do it, an installation ID
code is created from the product ID code
that you entered during installation and a
50-digit value that identifies your key
hardware components. You must send
this code to Microsoft, either automati-
cally if you have an Internet connection or
verbally via a phone call to Microsoft.
Microsoft then returns a 42-digit product
activation code. If you are activating on-
line, you don’t have to enter the activation
code; it happens automatically. If you are
activating over the phone, you must read
the installation ID to a representative and
enter the resulting 42-digit activation
code into the Activate Windows by Phone
dialog box.
No personal information about you is
sent as part of the activation process.
Figure 11.3 shows the dialog box that
opens
when
you
start
activation
by
clicking on the reminder message balloon.
Installing or Upgrading to Windows Vista
Preparing for a Windows Vista installation is not really different from pre-
paring for a Windows 2000 or XP install. There are, of course, a few things to
consider before installing or upgrading your system to Vista.
Upgrade Paths
Windows Vista is persnickety about doing Upgrade installs with different
editions; although you can upgrade to any edition of Vista from any version
of Windows XP, many upgrade paths will require you to do a clean installa-
tion of the Vista operating system. Note that you cannot upgrade from Win-
dows 2000 to Vista, but must do a clean installation. Vista’s upgrade paths
are so complicated that the only way to really explain them is using a grid
showing the OS you’re trying to upgrade from and the edition of Vista
you’re upgrading to. Fortunately for you, Microsoft provides such a grid,
which I’ve re-created in Table 11.1.
Hardware Requirements
Windows Vista requires a substantially more powerful computer to run
than Windows 2000 or XP. Make sure your computer meets at least the

If you’re uncertain about whether your computer will run Vista, you can
download and run the Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor from www.microsoft
.com/windows/windows-vista/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx, which will tell
you if your computer meets Microsoft’s minimum requirements.
Hardware and Software Compatibility
Windows Vista is markedly different from Windows XP in many very basic,
fundamental ways, and this causes all sorts of difficulty with programs and
device drivers designed for Windows XP. When Vista came out, you proba-
bly heard a lot of people grumbling about it, and likely they were grumbling
about hardware and software incompatibility. Simply put, a lot of old pro-
grams and devices don’t work in Windows Vista, which is bad news for
people who are still running Microsoft Word 97.

Vista’s Labyrinthine Upgrade Paths
The CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam is likely to test your knowl-
edge regarding the minimum
installation requirements for Win-
dows Vista Home Basic, Home
Premium, Business, or Ultimate.
Know them well!

Fortunately, Microsoft offers a Windows Vista Compatibility Center
where you can check whether a piece of software or hardware will work
with Vista. Most programs developed since Vista’s release in 2007 should
work, but checking the compatibility of any programs you absolutely can-
not do without is always a good idea.
Upgrading Issues
A few extra steps before you pop in that installation disc are worth your
time. If you plan to upgrade rather than perform a clean installation, follow
these steps first:
1.
Check out the Windows Logo’d Product List site or the Windows
Vista Compatibility Center site, or run a compatibility report by
using the Check Upgrade utility provided with Windows 2000
Professional or the Upgrade Advisor for Windows XP or Vista,
depending on which OS you’re planning on installing. These utilities
generate a detailed list of potentially problematic devices and
applications. You can run the utility in both 2000 and XP as follows:
insert the Windows Installation disc and, from your current OS,
open a command prompt or use the Start Run dialog box to run the
WINNT32.EXE program with the CHECKUPGRADEONLY switch
turned on. The command line will look like this:
d:\i386\winnt32 /checkupgradeonly
(where d: is the optical drive).
2.
Have an up-to-date backup of your data and configuration files handy.
3.
Perform a “spring cleaning” on your system by uninstalling unused
or unnecessary applications and deleting old files.
4.
Perform a disk scan and a disk defragmentation.
5.
Uncompress all files, folders, and partitions.
6.
Perform a virus scan, and then remove or disable all virus-checking
software.
7.
Disable virus checking in your system CMOS.
8.
Keep in mind that if worse comes to worst, you may have to start
over and do a clean installation anyway. This makes step 2
exceedingly important. Back up your data!
The Windows 2000/XP Clean
Installation Process
The steps involved in a clean installation of Windows 2000 Professional and
Windows XP are virtually identical. The only differences are the order of
two steps and some of the art on the screens that appear, so we can comfort-
ably discuss both installations at the same time.
A clean installation begins with your system set to boot to your optical
drive and the Windows installation disc in the drive. You start your PC, and
assuming you have the boot order right, the installation program starts

Software incompatibility in
Vista was such a problem for
many corporate customers and
end users that Microsoft is in-
cluding a Windows XP Mode in
the higher-end editions of Win-

the different OS.
Tech Tip
Compare and
Contrast…
In this chapter you’ve learned
some of the different installation
procedures for Windows 2000,
Windows XP, and Windows
Vista. Keeping them straight can
be hard, but if you want to avoid
being tricked on the CompTIA
A+ Essentials exam, you must be
able to. Review the procedures
and then make sure you can iden-
tify the points of similarity and,
more importantly, the differences
among the three.
Not all screens in the installa-
tion process are shown!

booting (Figure 11.4). Note
at the bottom that it says to
press F6 for a third-party
SCSI or RAID driver. You
only do this if you want to
install Windows onto a
strange drive and Win-
dows
does
not
already
have the driver for that
drive. Don’t worry about
this; Windows has a huge
assortment of drivers for
just about every hard drive
ever made, and in the rare
situation where you need a
third-party
driver,
the
folks who sell you the SCSI
or RAID array will tell you
ahead of time.
After the system cop-
ies a number of files, you’ll
see the Welcome screen
(Figure 11.5). This is an
important
screen!
As
you’ll see in later chapters,
techs often use the Win-
dows installation disc as a
repair tool, and this is the
screen that lets you choose
between installing Win-
dows or repairing an ex-
isting installation. Because
you’re making a new in-
stall, just press ENTER.
You’re now prompted
to read and accept the
EULA. Nobody ever reads
thisit gives you a stom-
achache
when
you
see
what you’re really agreeing toso just press F8 and move to the next screen
to start partitioning the drive (Figure 11.6).
If your hard disk is unpartitioned, you need to create a new partition
when prompted. Follow the instructions. In most cases, you can make a sin-
gle partition, although you can easily make as many partitions as you wish.
You can also delete partitions if you’re using a hard drive that was parti-
tioned in the past (or if you mess up your partitioning). Note that there is no
option to make a primary or extended partition; this tool makes the first par-
tition primary and the rest extended.
After you’ve made the partition(s), you must select the partition on
which to install XP (sort of trivial if you only have one partition), and then
you need to decide which file system format to use for the new partition.

Tech Tip
Save Some Space
Many techie types, at least those
with big (> 500 GB) hard drives,
only partition half of their hard
drive for Windows. This makes it
easy for them to install an alter-
native OS (usually Linux) at a
later date.

Unless
you
have
some
weird
need
to
support
FAT or FAT32, format the
partition by using NTFS
(Figure 11.7).
Setup now formats the
drive and copies some ba-
sic installation files to the
newly
formatted
parti-
tion, displaying another
progress bar. Go get a
book to read while you
wait.
After
it
completes
copying the base set of
files to the hard drive,
your
computer
reboots,
and the graphical mode of
Windows
setup
begins.
This is where 2000 and XP
begin to vary in appearance, even though they are performing the same
steps. The rest of this section shows Windows XP. If you’re running a Win-
dows 2000 install, compare it to the screens you see here; it’s interesting to
see the different presentation doing the same job.
You will see a generic screen during the installation that looks like
Figure 11.8. On the left of the screen, uncompleted tasks have a white but-
ton, completed tasks have a green button, and the current task has a red but-
ton. You’ll get plenty of advertising to read as you install.
The following screens ask questions about a number of things the com-
puter needs to know. They include the desired region and language the
computer will operate in, your name and organization for personalizing

your computer, and a valid product key for Windows XP (Figure 11.9). Be
sure to enter the product key exactly, or you will be unable to continue.
Next, you need to give your computer a name that will identify it on a net-
work. Check with your system administrator for an appropriate name. If you
don’t have a system administrator, just enter a simple name such as MYPC for
nowyou can change this at any timeand read up on networking later in
this book. You also need to create a password for the Administrator user ac-
count (Figure 11.10). Every Windows system has an Administrator user

account that can do anything on the computer. Techs will need this account to
modify and fix the computer in the future.
Last, you’re asked for the correct date, time, and time zone. Then
Windows tries to detect a network card. If a network card is detected, the
network components will be installed and you’ll have an opportunity to
configure the network settings. Unless you know you need special settings
for your network, just select the Typical Settings option (Figure 11.11).
Relax; XP will do most of the work for
you. Plus you can easily change network
settings after the installation.
The big copy of files now begins from
the CD-ROM to your hard drive. This is a
good time to pick your book up again,
because watching the ads is boring
(Figure 11.12).
After the files required for the final
configuration are
copied, XP
reboots
again. During this reboot, XP determines
your screen size and applies the appropri-
ate resolution. This reboot can take several
minutes to complete, so be patient.
Once the reboot is complete, you can
log on as the Administrator. Balloon mes-
sages may appear over the tray area of
the taskbar—a common message con-
cerns the display resolution. Click the
balloon and allow Windows XP to auto-
matically adjust the display settings.

Selecting typical network settings
Even experienced techs usu-
ally select the Typical Settings
option. Installation is not the
time to be messing with network
details unless you need to.

The final message in the installation process reminds you that you have
30 days left for activation. Go ahead and activate now over the Internet or by
telephone. It’s painless and quick. If you choose not to activate, simply click
the Close button on the message balloon. That’s it! You have successfully in-
stalled Windows XP and should have a desktop with the default Bliss back-
ground, as shown in Figure 11.13.

The Windows Vista Clean
Installation Process
With Windows Vista, Microsoft has dramatically changed the installation
process. No longer will you spend your time looking at a boring blue ASCII
screen and entering commands by keyboard—the Vista installer has a full
graphical interface, making it easy to partition drives and install your oper-
ating system. If you thought that installing Windows XP seemed a little
primitive, you’ll love the fancy Vista installer.
Just as when installing Windows 2000 or XP, you need to boot your com-
puter from some sort of Windows installation media. Usually, you’ll use a
DVD disc, though you can also install Vista from a USB drive, over a net-
work, or even off of several CD-ROMs that you have to specially order from
Microsoft. When you’ve booted into the installer, the first screen you see
asks you to set your language, time/currency, and keyboard settings, as in
Figure 11.14.
The next screen in the installation process is somewhat akin to the 2000
and XP Welcome screen, in that it enables techs to start the installation disc’s
repair tools (Figure 11.15). Just like the completely revamped installer, the
Vista repair tools are markedly different from the ones for Microsoft’s previ-
ous operating systems. The 701 Essentials exam doesn’t really require you to
know a whole lot about these repair tools, so, for now, just click where it
says Repair your computer to use the repair tools. Because you’re just in-
stalling Windows in this chapter, click Install now.
356
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 11.14
Windows Vista language settings screen

The next screen shows
just how wildly different
the Vista installation or-
der is. When installing
Vista,
you
enter
your
product key before you
do anything else, as you
can see in Figure 11.16.
With Windows 2000 and
XP, this didn’t come until
much, much later in the
process, and there’s a very
interesting reason for this
change.
Microsoft has dramat-
ically altered the method
they use to distribute dif-
ferent editions of their op-
erating system; instead of
having different discs for
each edition of Windows
Vista, every Vista installa-
tion disc contains all of
the available editions. In
Windows 2000 and XP,
your product key did very
little besides let the instal-
lation disc know that you
had
legitimately
pur-
chased the OS. In Vista,
your product key not only
verifies the legitimacy of
your purchase; it also tells
the installer which edition
you
purchased,
which,
when you think about it,
is a lot to ask of a ran-
domly generated string of
numbers and letters.
If you leave the prod-
uct key blank and click the
Next button, you will be
taken to a screen asking
you
which
version
of
Vista you would like to in-
stall (Figure 11.17). Lest
you start to think that
you’ve discovered a way
to install Vista without
paying for it, you should

screen should be pretty self-
explanatory, so set the cor-
rect time zone, the correct
date, and the correct time,
and move to the next screen.
If you have your com-
puter connected to a network
while running the installer,
the next screen will ask you
about your current location
(Figure 11.26). If you’re on a
trusted network, such as your
home or office network, make

Lest you think you’re completely through the woods, Windows will run
some tests on your computer to give it a performance rating, which, in the-
ory, will tell you how well programs will run on your computer. You’ll
sometimes see minimum performance ratings on the sides of game boxes,
but even then, you’re more likely to need plain, old-fashioned minimum
system requirements. This process can take anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes,
so this is another one of those coffee-break moments in the installation
process.
Once the performance test finishes, Vista boots up and you have 30 days
to activate your new operating system.
Automating the Installation
As you can see, you may have to sit around for quite a while when installing
Windows. Instead of having to sit there answering questions and typing in
CD keys, wouldn’t it be nice just to boot up the machine and have the instal-
lation process finish without any intervention on your part—especially if
you have 30 PCs that need to be ready to go tomorrow morning? Fortu-
nately, Windows offers two good options for automating the installation
process: scripted installations and disk cloning.

Scripting Windows 2000 and XP Installations
with Setup Manager
For automating a Windows 2000 or XP install, Microsoft
provides Setup Manager to help you create a text file—
called an answer file—containing all of your answers to
the installation questions. Windows doesn’t come with
Setup Manager, but you can download it from the
Microsoft Download Center (www.microsoft.com/
downloads) as part of the Windows XP Service Pack 2
Deployment Tools. Setup Manager supports creating
answer files for three types of setups: Unattended,
Sysprep, and Remote Installation Services (Figure
11.28). The current version of the tool can create answer
files for Windows XP Home Edition, Windows XP Pro-
fessional, and Windows Server 2003 (Standard, Enter-
prise, or Web Edition); see Figure 11.29.
Setup Manager can create an answer file to completely
automate the process, or you can use it to set default op-
tions. You’ll almost always want to create an answer file
that automates the entire process (Figure 11.30).
When running a scripted installation, you have to
decide how to make the installation files themselves
available to the PC. Although you can boot your new machine from an in-
stallation CD, you can save yourself a lot of CD swapping if you just put the
installation files on a network share and install your OS over the network
(Figure 11.31).

Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 11.28
Setup Manager can create answer files for three
types of setups.
• Figure 11.29
Setup Manager can create answer files for five
versions of Windows.
• Figure 11.30
Setup Manager can create several kinds of
answer files.

When you run Setup Manager, you get to answer all those pesky ques-
tions. As always, you will also have to “accept the terms of the License
Agreement” (Figure 11.32) and specify the product key (Figure 11.33), but at
least by scripting these steps you can do it once and get it over with.
Now it’s time to get to the good stuff, customizing your installation.
Using the graphical interface, decide what configuration options you want
to use: screen resolutions, network options, browser settings, regional set-
tings, and so on. You can even add finishing touches to the installation, in-
stalling additional programs such as Microsoft Office and Adobe Reader by
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows

automatically running additional commands after the Windows installation
finishes (Figure 11.34). You can also set programs to run once (Figure 11.35).
Remember that computer names must be unique on the network. If
you’re going to use the same answer files for multiple machines on the same
network, you need to make sure that each machine gets its own unique
name. You can either provide a list of names to use, or you can have the
Setup program randomly generate names (Figure 11.36).
366

When you’re finished, Setup Manager prompts you to save your an-
swers as a text file. The contents of the file will look something like this:

Pick your computer names.

[Identification]
JoinDomain=TOTAL
DomainAdmin=admin09
DomainAdminPassword=my-password
The list goes on for another hundred lines or so, and this is a fairly sim-
ple answer file. One thing to note is that if you provide a domain administra-
tor’s user name and password for the purpose of automatically adding new
PCs to your domain, that user name and password will be in the text file in
clear text:
[Identification]
JoinDomain=TOTAL
DomainAdmin=admin09
DomainAdminPassword=my-password
In that case, you will want to be very careful about protecting your setup
files.
Once you have your answer file created, you can start your installation
with this command, and go enjoy a nice cup of coffee while the installation
runs:
D:\i386\winnt32 /s:%SetupFiles% /unattend:%AnswerFile%
For %SetupFiles%, substitute the location of your setup files—either a
local path (D:\i386 if you are installing from a CD) or a network path. If
you use a network path, don’t forget to create a network boot disk so that the
installation program can access the files. For %AnswerFile%, substitute the
name
of
the
text
file
you
created
with
Setup
Manager
(usually
unattend.txt).
Of course, you don’t have to use Setup Manager to create your answer
file. Feel free to pull out your favorite text editor and write one from scratch.
Most techs, however, find it much easier to use the provided tool than to
wrestle with the answer file’s sometimes arcane syntax.
Automating a Vista Installation with the Automated
Installation Kit
As of Windows Vista, Setup Manager is history—as is any method of auto-
mating an installation that isn’t extremely complicated and intimidating.
Microsoft has replaced Setup Manager with the Windows Vista Automated
Installation Kit (AIK), a set of tools which, although quite powerful, seem to
have made something of a Faustian deal to obtain that power at the expense
of usability (Figure 11.37).
Writing a step-by-step guide to creating an answer file in the AIK would
almost warrant its own chapter, and as the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam
doesn’t cover it at all, I’m not going to go into too much gory detail. I will,
however, give a brief account of the process involved.
The basic idea behind the AIK is that a tech can create an answer file by
using a tool called the Windows System Image Monitor, and then use that
answer file to build a Master Installation file that can be burned to DVD.
Vista’s answer files are no longer simple text documents but .XML files, and

Creating a Network-
Aware Bootable Disc
If you need help creating a net-
work boot floppy or CD, check

bootcd.htm.

the process of creating one is much, much more
complicated than it used to be. Gone are the days
of simply running a wizard and modifying op-
tions as you see fit, replaced instead with a
method of choosing components (which repre-
sent the things you want your automated installa-
tion to do, such as create a partition, enter a certain
product key, and much, much more) out of a
huge, often baffling list and then modifying their
settings (Figure 11.38).
Once you’ve selected and modified all of the
components you’re interested in, you have to save
your answer file, copy it to either a floppy disk or
a USB thumb drive, and plug that into a new com-
puter that you’re going to install Vista on. When
you boot a computer off of the Vista installation
disc, it automatically searches all removable me-
dia for an answer file, and, finding one, uses it to
automatically install itself. If you’re only install-
ing Vista to this one computer, you’re finished,
but if you want to install it to multiple computers,
you’ll probably want to create a disc image based
off of your Master Installation file.
To create such an image, you must use a cou-
ple more tools in the AIK—Windows PE and
ImageX—to “capture” the installation and create
a disc image from it. If the rest of the process
seemed a bit complicated, this part is like solving
a Rubik’s cube with your teeth while balancing on
top of a flag pole and juggling. Suffice it to say that
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows
369
• Figure 11.37
The Automated Installation Kit
• Figure 11.38
The list of components in the Image Monitor

the AIK comes with documentation that tells you how to do this, so with a
bit of patience, you can get through it.
After you’ve created an image from your Master Installation file, you
can burn it to discs or share it on a network to set up new computers. All in
all, this is an extremely complicated process that will, when you’re finished
with it, make installing Windows Vista a snap.
Scripted installations are a fine option, but they don’t work well in all
scenarios. Creating a fully scripted installation, including the installation of
all additional drivers, software updates, and applications, can be a time-
consuming process involving lots of trial-and-error adjustments. Wouldn’t
it be easier, at least some of the time, to manually set up one PC exactly the
way you want it, and then automatically create exact copies of that installa-
tion on other machines? That’s where disk cloning comes into play.
Disk Cloning
Disk cloning simply takes an existing PC and makes a full copy of the drive,
including all data, software, and configuration files. You can then transfer
that copy to as many machines as you like, essentially creating clones of the
original machine. In the old days, making a clone was pretty simple. You
just hooked up two hard drives and copied the files from the original to the
clone by using something like the venerable XCOPY program (as long as the
hard drive was formatted with FAT or FAT32). Today, you’ll want to use a
more sophisticated program, such as Norton Ghost, to make an image file
that contains a copy of an entire hard drive and then lets you copy that im-
age either locally or over the network.
Sysprep
Cloning a Windows PC works great for some situations, but what if you
need to send the same image out to machines that have slightly different
hardware? What if you need the customer to go through the final steps of
the Windows installation (creating a user account, accepting the license
agreement, etc.)? That’s when you need to combine a scripted setup with
cloning by using the System Preparation Tool, Sysprep, which can undo por-
tions of the Windows installation process.
After

Windows
and

application of your choice. The first time a new system cloned from the im-
age boots, an abbreviated version of setup, Mini-Setup, runs and completes
the last few steps of the installation process: installing drivers for hardware,
prompting the user to accept the license agreement and create user ac-
counts, and so on. Optionally, you can use Setup Manager to create an an-
swer file to customize Mini-Setup, just as you would with a standard
scripted installation.
■Troubleshooting Installation
Problems
The term “installation problem” is rather deceptive. The installation process
itself almost never fails. Usually, something else fails during the process that
is generally interpreted as an “install failure.” Let’s look at some typical in-
stallation problems and how to correct them.
Text Mode Errors
If you’re going to have a problem with a Windows installation, this is the
place to get one. It’s always better to have the error right off the bat as op-
posed to when the installation is nearly complete. Text mode errors most of-
ten take place during clean installations and usually point to one of the
following problems:
No Boot Device Present When Booting Off the Startup Disk
Either the startup disk is bad or the CMOS is not set to look at that disk drive
first.
Windows Setup Requires XXXX Amount of Available Drive Space
You forgot to format the C: drive, or there’s a bunch of stuff on the drive
already.
Not Ready Error on Optical Drive
You probably just need to give the optical drive a moment to catch up. Press
R for retry a few times. You may also have a damaged installation disc, or the
optical drive may be too slow for the system.
A Stop Error (Blue Screen of Death) After the Reboot
at the End of Text Mode
This may mean you didn’t do your homework in checking hardware com-
patibility, especially the BIOS. Stop errors are scary, but often fixable, so if
you encounter one of these errors during installation, check out the
Microsoft Knowledge Base.
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows
371
Tech Tip
RIS
Microsoft offers an even more
advanced way of rolling out new
systems: Remote Installation
Services (RIS). RIS requires at
least Windows Server 2003 and
is well beyond the scope of the
CompTIA A+ Essentials exam.

Graphical Mode Errors
Once the installation passes the text mode and moves into graphical mode, a
whole new crop of problems may arise.
Hardware Detection Errors
Failure to detect hardware properly by any version of Windows Setup can
be avoided by simply researching compatibility beforehand. Or, if you de-
cided to skip that step, you might be lucky and only have a hardware detec-
tion error involving a noncritical hardware device. You can troubleshoot
this problem at your leisure. In a sense, you are handing in your homework
late, checking out compatibility and finding a proper driver after Windows
is installed.
Every Windows installation depends on Windows Setup properly de-
tecting the computer type (motherboard and BIOS stuff, in particular) and
installing the correct hardware support. Microsoft designed Windows to
run on several hardware platforms using a layer of software tailored specifi-
cally for the hardware, called the hardware abstraction layer (HAL).
Can’t Read CAB Files
This is probably the most common of all installation errors. CAB files (as in
cabinet) are special compressed files, recognizable by their .CAB file exten-
sion, that Microsoft uses to distribute copies of Windows. If your system
can’t read them, first check the installation disc for scratches. Then try copy-
ing all of the files from the source directory on the disc (\i386) into a direc-
tory on your local hard drive. Then run Windows Setup from there,
remembering to use the correct program (WINNT32.EXE). If you can’t read
any of the files on the installation disc, you may have a defective drive.
Lockups During Installation
Lockups are one of the most challenging problems that can take place during
installation, because they don’t give you a clue as to what’s causing the prob-
lem. Here are a few things to check if you get a lockup during installation.
Smart Recovery, Repair Installation
Most system lockups occur when Windows Setup queries the hardware. If a
system locks up once during setup, turn off the computer—literally. Unplug
the system! Do not press CTRL-ALT-DEL. Do not click Reset. Unplug it! Then
turn the system back on, boot into Setup, and rerun the Setup program. Win-
dows will see the partial installation and either restart the installation process
automatically (Smart Recovery) or prompt you to repair the installation. Both
of these look at the installation progress and complete the installation.
Optical Drive, Hard Drive
Bad optical discs, optical drives, or hard drives may cause lockups. Check
the optical disc for scratches or dirt, and clean it up or replace it. Try a
known good disc in the drive. If you get the same error, you may need to re-
place the drive.
372
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Log Files
Windows generates a number of special text files called log files that track
the progress of certain processes. Although Windows creates different log
files for different purposes, two files most interest us:
■
SETUPLOG.TXT tracks the complete installation process, logging the
success or failure of file copying, Registry updates, reboots, and so on.
■
SETUPAPI.LOG tracks each piece of hardware as it is installed. This is
not an easy log file to read, as it uses Plug and Play code, but it will
show you the last device installed before Windows locked up.
Windows stores these log files in the WINNT or Windows directory (the lo-
cation in which the OS is installed). These operating systems have powerful re-
covery options, so, honestly, the chances of your ever actually having to read a
log file, understand it, and then get something fixed as a result of that under-
standing are pretty small. What makes log files handy is when you call
Microsoft or a hardware manufacturer. They love to read these files, and they
actually have people who understand them. Don’t worry about understanding
log files for the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam; just make sure you know the
names of the log files and their location. Leave the details to the übergeeks.
■Post-Installation Tasks
You might think that’s enough work for one day, but your task list has a few
more things. They include updating the OS with patches and service packs,
upgrading drivers, restoring user data files, and migrating and retiring.
Patches, Service Packs, and Updates
Someone once described an airliner as consisting of millions of parts flying
in close formation. I think that’s also a good description for an operating sys-
tem. And we can even carry that analogy further by thinking about all of the
maintenance required to keep an airliner safely flying. Like an airliner, the
parts (programming code) of your OS were created by different people, and
some parts may even have been contracted out. Although each component
is tested as much as possible, and the assembled OS is also tested, it’s not
possible to test for every possible combination of events. Sometimes a piece
is simply found to be defective. The fix for such a problem is a corrective
program called a patch.
In the past, Microsoft provided patches for individual problems. They also
accumulated patches until they reached some sort of critical mass and then
bundled them together as a service pack. They still do this. But they also make it
easier for you to find and install the appropriate patches and service packs,
which, when combined, are called updates. They make these updates available
at their Web site or on optical disc. Many organizations make the updates avail-
able for distribution from network servers. Immediately after installing Win-
dows, install the latest updates on the computer.
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows
373

Upgrading Drivers
Even if you did all your preinstallation tasks, you may decide to go with the de-
fault drivers that come with Windows and then upgrade them to the latest
drivers after the fact. This is a good strategy, because installation is a compli-
cated task and you can simplify it by installing old but adequate drivers. Maybe
those newest drivers are just a week old—waiting until after the Windows in-
stallation to install new drivers gives you a usable driver to go back to if the
new driver turns out to be a lemon. In the next chapter, “Learning Input/
Output,” you’ll learn more about working with drivers, including a little driver
magic called “Roll Back Driver.”
Restoring User Data Files (If Applicable)
Remember when you backed up the user data files before installation? You
don’t? Well, check again, because now is the time to restore that data. Your
method of restoring depends on how you backed up the files in the first
place. If you used a third-party backup program, you need to install it before
you can restore those files, but if you used the Windows Backup utility
(Windows 2000 or XP) or the Backup and Restore Center (Windows Vista),
you are in luck, because they are installed by default (with the exception of
Windows XP Home edition). If you did something simpler, such as copying
to optical discs or a network location, all you have to do is copy the files back
to the local hard disk. Good luck!
Migrating and Retiring
Seasons change and so does the state of the art in computing. At a certain
point in a computer’s life, you’ll need to retire an old system. This means
you must move the data and users to a new system or at least a new hard
drive—a process called migration—and then safely dispose of the old sys-
tem. Microsoft offers a few tools to accomplish this task,
and because it’s important to know about them for the
A+ exam (not to mention for your next new computer
purchase), I’m going to go over them.
Files and Settings Transfer Wizard
You’ve already heard a bit about the Files and Settings
Transfer Wizard (FSTW) back in Chapter 4, “Understand-
ing Windows,” but the Essentials exam expects you to
have more than just a passing knowledge of it. When mi-
grating to a new system, you would run the Files and Set-
tings Transfer Wizard on the newer computer (assuming
the newer computer is running Windows XP, but more
on Vista’s migration options later), which would then use
the wizard to pull files off of the older one. You start the
wizard by going to Accessories | System Tools in Win-
dows XP’s All Programs menu. Once you’ve fired it up,
you’re presented with the screen in Figure 11.40.
374
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 11.40
The Files and Settings Transfer Wizard’s initial
screen

When you click the Next button on the wizard’s
first screen, you’re asked whether the computer you’re
using is the new or old computer, as in Figure 11.41.
Note that the old computer can be running any ver-
sion of Windows all the way back to Windows 95.
Older Windows operating systems didn’t come with
the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard installed, so if
you’re migrating from an older version of Windows,
you’ll have to either install the wizard onto the older
computer with the XP disc or create a Wizard Disk that
will enable you to do the same thing. You’re given the
option to create such a disk by clicking Next with New
computer selected, as in Figure 11.42.
Once you’ve either created a Wizard Disk (or told
the wizard that you’re going to install the wizard from
the XP CD), you’re taken to a screen that asks where to
look for the files and settings that you’ve collected
(Figure 11.43). The first two options are slightly out-
dated, because the first refers to a direct serial connec-
tion, now a rarity in the personal computing world, and the second asks for
a floppy disc, though you can use it with USB thumb drives as well. The
third option is the most likely candidate for a migration, because it enables
you to look for your older computer on your home network.
Meanwhile, to actually determine which files and settings are going to
be transferred, you need to run the wizard on your old computer. If you’re
migrating from another Windows XP machine, you need to tell the wizard
where it’s being run; otherwise, you skip to the next step, which asks how
you want to transfer the files (Figure 11.44). The best option is to transfer
them over a home network, but you can also save the files on a USB thumb
drive or simply on a folder on your computer, though, obviously, that
doesn’t do a lot for transferring the files.

Is this the new computer or your old one?

Where are the files and settings?

When you click Next, the wizard
shows its default list of folders and set-
tings to save, but being the savvy PC tech
you are, you’ll probably want to custom-
ize which folders are migrated. You can
do that by checking the box that says Let
me select a custom list of files and settings
when I click Next (Figure 11.45).
If you’ve checked that box, the next
page enables you to add additional set-
tings and browse for additional folders,
files, or even file types to back up, making
it pretty easy to simply back up every
.MP3 on your computer (Figure 11.46).
Neat, huh?
Once you click Next on that screen,
the wizard begins the actual transfer pro-
cess, which can take quite a lot of time de-
pending

much
stuff
you’re
transferring. This is an excellent time to,
for example, read the complete works of
Pliny the Elder, or, even more usefully, to
memorize all of the previous chapters of

probably have plenty of time.

User State Migration Tool
If you’re the sort of computer user who demands maximum functionality
and power from your operating system, you’ll probably want to use the
User State Migration Tool (USMT). The USMT has all of the same features as
the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard, but with much more control over ad-
vanced configurations for the new computer. Its primary use is in busi-
nesses, because it has to be run in a Windows Server domain. In practice, if
you’re migrating a single user, use the FSTW. If you need to migrate multi-
ple users, the USMT is the tool.
Windows Easy Transfer
With Windows Vista and 7, Microsoft has upgraded the Files and Settings
Transfer Wizard, calling it Windows Easy Transfer. Windows Easy Transfer
comes native in Vista/7 and can be downloaded and installed on Windows
XP or 2000 as well, though you won’t be able to transfer settings from a 2000
computer, only files. Windows Easy Transfer is located in the System Tools
subfolder of the Accessories folder in your Programs menu. The first screen
of the Windows Easy Transfer simply gives you a bit of information about
the process, so there’s not really much to do there.
When you click Next, you’re taken to a screen that asks if you want to
start a new transfer or continue an old one (Figure 11.47). If you’ve already
set up your old computer to transfer the files, select the latter option; if you
haven’t, select the former.
If you choose to start a new transfer, the process is very similar to the
Files and Settings Transfer Wizard: you select whether you’re using your
new or old computer and then follow the same basic steps as before.

Customizing the transfer

There are some differences, of course—network security is improved by
using Transfer Keys to protect your files from others on the network,
there’s an option to use a special Easy Transfer cable to transfer your files
between USB ports, and the order of some screens is changed around a
bit—but if you understand the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard trans-
fer process, Windows Easy Transfer shouldn’t be too difficult.
Migration Practices
When talking about migration or retirement in terms of security, you need
to answer one question: What do you do with the old system or drive?
All but the most vanilla new installations have sensitive data on them,
even if it’s simply e-mail messages or notes-to-self that would cause embar-
rassment if discovered. Most PCs, especially in a work environment, con-
tain a lot of sensitive data. You can’t just format C: and hand over the drive.
Follow three principles when migrating or retiring a computer. First, mi-
grate your users and data information in a secure environment. Until you
get passwords properly in place and test the security of the new system, you
can’t consider that system secure. Second, remove data remnants from hard
drives that you store or give to charity. Third, recycle the older equipment;
don’t throw it in the trash. PC recyclers go through a process of deconstruct-
ing hardware, breaking system units, keyboards, printers, and even moni-
tors into their basic plastics, metals, and glass for reuse.
The easiest way for someone to compromise or access sensitive data is to
simply take it when you’re not looking. This is especially true when copying
information to a new, unprotected system. Don’t set a copy to run while you
go out to lunch, but rather be there to supervise and remove any remnant
378

data that might still reside on any mass storage devices, especially hard
drives.
You might think that, as easy as it seems to be to lose data, you could
readily get rid of data if you tried. That’s not the case with magnetic media,
though, such as hard drives and flash memory. Cleaning a drive completely
is very difficult. Repeated formatting won’t do the trick. Partitioning and
formatting won’t work. Data doesn’t necessarily get written over in the
same place every time, which means that a solid wipe of a hard drive by
writing zeros to all of the clusters still potentially leaves a lot of sensitive and
recoverable data, typically called remnants, on the drive.
Although you can’t make data 100 percent unrecoverable short of
physically shredding or pulverizing a drive, you can do well enough for
donation purposes by using one of the better drive-wiping utilities, such
as Webroot’s Window Washer (Figure 11.48). With Window Washer, you
can erase your Web browsing history, your recent activity in Windows
(such as what programs you ran), and even your e-mail messages perma-
nently. As an added bonus, you can create a bootable disk that enables you
to wipe a drive completely.
Recycle
An important and relatively easy way to be an environmentally conscious
computer user is to recycle. Recycling products such as paper and printer
cartridges not only keeps them out of overcrowded landfills but also en-
sures that the more toxic products are disposed of in the right way. Safely
disposing of hardware containing hazardous materials, such as computer
monitors, protects both people and the environment.
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows

Anyone who’s ever tried to sell a computer more than three or four years
old learns a hard lesson: they’re not worth much if anything at all. It’s a real
temptation to take that old computer and just toss it in the garbage, but
never do that!
First of all, many parts of your computer—such as your computer moni-
tor—contain hazardous materials that pollute the environment. Luckily,
thousands of companies now specialize in computer recycling and will
gladly accept your old computer. If you have enough computers, they might
even pick them up. If you can’t find a recycler, call your local municipality’s
waste authority to see where to drop off your system.
An even better alternative for your old computer is donation. Many or-
ganizations actively look for old computers to refurbish and to donate to
schools and other organizations. Just keep in mind that the computer can be
too old—not even a school wants a computer more than five or six years old.
■Post-Installation: How All the
Pieces Fit Together
You know from previous chapters the locations of many of the user-focused
folders that are installed automatically. The Windows desktop, for example,
is simply a folder, most commonly found in the user folders section of the C:
drive. Similarly, My Documents/Documents is just another folder.
Installation creates a set of Windows-specific files and folders that the
OS needs to run a PC. Some of these files and folders are directly on the root
of the C: drive; others can be elsewhere. The best way to remember the loca-
tions of these files and folders and to know their importance to the OS is by
looking at how they interact to boot the PC. Windows 2000 and Windows
XP have pretty much the same files and boot process; Windows Vista differs
a bit, so we’ll look at the latter OS separately.
The 2000/XP Boot Process
Windows 2000 and XP distinguish between the files that start the operating
system (called the system files) and the rest of the operating system files (usually
in the \WINDOWS or \WINNT folders). The system files (memorize these!)
consist of three required files: NTLDR, BOOT.INI, and NTDETECT.COM. If
you’re using a SCSI hard drive, there’s a fourth file called NTBOOTDD.SYS.
The NTLDR (pronounced NT loader) file begins the boot process.
You know from earlier chapters that to make a drive bootable requires
an active, primary partition, right? Let’s look at the process in a PC with a
hard drive partitioned as C: and D:.
The CPU wakes up and runs the system BIOS, and then the BIOS sends
out a routine looking for a valid operating system in the boot sector of the
primary master hard drive. The master file table (MFT) lives in the boot sec-
tor of the C: partition. It points to the location of the Windows 2000/XP sys-
tem files, also on the C: drive, because that’s the bootable drive. Windows
calls the primary active partition the system partition or the system volume (if
it’s a dynamic disk).
380
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

The Windows 2000/XP boot files consist of NTOSKRNL.EXE (the Win-
dows kernel), the \WINNT\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM file (which
controls the loading of device drivers), and the device drivers. Although
these files are the core of the Windows 2000/XP OS, they are not capable of
booting, or starting, the system. For that feat, they require NTLDR,
NTDETECT.COM, and BOOT.INI—the system files.
The system files start the PC and then, at the end of that process, point
the CPU to the location of the boot files. The CPU goes over and chats with
NTOSKRNL, and the GUI starts to load. The operating system is then up
and running, and you’re able to do work.
The odd part about all this is that Microsoft decided to make the OS files
mobile. The Windows operating system files can reside on any partition or volume
in the PC. The \WINDOWS folder, for example, could very well be on drive
D:, not drive C:. Whichever drive holds the core OS files is called the boot par-
tition. This can lead to a little confusion when you say the system files are on
the C: drive and Windows is on the D: drive, but that’s just the way it is. The
vast majority of Windows 2000/XP systems have the system partition and
the boot partition both on the same big C: partition.
You have the process now in general, so let’s look more specifically at
the makeup and function of the individual files involved in the boot process.
2000/XP System Partition Files
Windows 2000 and XP require the three system files in the root directory of
the system partition:
■
NTLDR
■
BOOT.INI
■
NTDETECT.COM
To see these files, go
into My Computer and
open the C: drive. Go to
Tools | Folder Options.
Click Show hidden files
and folders, uncheck the
Hide protected operating
system
files
(Recom-
mended) option, and click
OK. Now when you re-
turn
to
viewing
the
folder in My Computer,
you will see certain criti-
cal files that Windows
otherwise
hides
from
you to prevent you from
accidentally moving, de-
leting, or changing them
in some unintended way
(Figure 11.49).
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows
381
• Figure 11.49
My Computer showing the system files

NTLDR
When the system boots up, the master boot record (MBR) or MFT on the
hard drive starts the NTLDR program. The NTLDR program then launches
Windows 2000/XP or another OS. To find the available OSes, the NTLDR
program must read the BOOT.INI configuration file. To do so, it loads its
own minimal file system, which enables it to read the BOOT.INI file off of
the system partition.
BOOT.INI File
The BOOT.INI file is a text file that lists the OSes available to NTLDR and
tells NTLDR where to find the boot partition (where the OS is stored) for
each of them. The BOOT.INI file has sections defined by headings enclosed
in brackets. A basic BOOT.INI in Windows XP looks like this:
[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Microsoft Windows XP
Professional" /fastdetect
A more complex BOOT.INI may look like this:
[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Microsoft Windows XP
Professional" /fastdetect
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINNT="Microsoft Windows 2000
Professional" /fastdetect
Such a BOOT.INI would result in the boot menu that appears in
Figure 11.50.
382
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 11.50
Boot loader in Windows 2000 with System Recovery Console

This crazy multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1) is an exam-
ple of the Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) naming system. It’s a system
that’s designed to enable your PC to boot Windows from any hard drive, in-
cluding removable devices. Let’s take a quick peek at each ARC setting to
see how it works.
Multi(x) is the number of the adapter and always starts with 0. The
adapter is determined by the boot order you set in your CMOS setting. For
example, if you have a single PATA controller and a SATA controller, and
you set the system to boot first from the PATA, any drive on that controller
will get the value multi(0) placed in its ARC format. Any SATA drive will
get multi(1).
Disk(x) is only used for SCSI drives, but the value is required in the
ARC format, so with ATA systems it’s always set to disk(0).
Rdisk(x) specifies the number of the disk on the adapter. On a PATA
drive, the master is rdisk(0) and the slave is rdisk(1). On SATA drives,
the order is usually based on the number of the SATA connection printed on
the motherboard, though some systems allow you to change this in CMOS.
Partition(x) is the number of the partition or logical drive in an ex-
tended partition. The numbering starts at 1, so the first partition is parti-
tion(1), the second is partition(2), and so on.
The \WINDOWS is the name of the folder that holds the boot files. This is
important to appreciate! The ARC format looks at the folder, so there’s no
problem running different versions of Windows on a single partition. You
can simply install them in different folders. Of course, you have other limi-
tations, such as file system type, but in general, multibooting in Windows is
pretty trivial. Better yet, this is all handled during the installation process.
ARC format can get far more complicated. SCSI drives get a slightly dif-
ferent ARC format. For example, if you installed Windows on a SCSI drive,
you might see this ARC setting in your BOOT.INI:
scsi(0)disk(1)rdisk(0)partition(1)
If you want to boot to a SCSI drive, Windows adds a fourth file to
your system files called NTBOOTDD.SYS. This file only exists if you
want to boot to a SCSI drive. Most people don’t boot to a SCSI, so
don’t worry if you don’t see this file with the other three system files.
On rare occasions, you might find yourself needing to edit the
BOOT.INI file. Any text editor handily edits this file, but most of us
prefer to edit BOOT.INI via the System Setup dialog box. In Windows
2000/XP, open the System applet from the Control Panel. Click the
Advanced tab and then click the Startup and Recovery button. The
BOOT.INI options show up at the top (Figure 11.51).
BOOT.INI has some interesting switches at the end of the ARC
formats that give special instructions on how the operating system
should boot. Sometimes Windows puts these in automatically, and
sometimes you will add them manually for troubleshooting. Here are
a few of the more common ones:
■
/BOOTLOG
Tells Windows to create a log of the boot
process and write it to a file called Ntbtlog.txt.
■
/CMDCONS
Tells Windows to start the Recovery Console.
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows
383
• Figure 11.51
BOOT.INI

■
/LASTKNOWNGOOD
Tells Windows to boot the Last Known
Good set of files.
■
/NOEXECUTE
Newer CPUs come with Data Execute Protection
(DEP) to prevent unruly programs from causing system lockups.
The setting for this, /NOEXECUTE=OPTIN, is the default on
Windows systems.
NTDETECT.COM
If the NTLDR determines that you have chosen to start Windows 2000/XP,
it boots the system into protected mode and then calls on NTDETECT.COM
to detect the installed hardware on the system. NTLDR then refers to the
BOOT.INI file to locate the Windows boot files.
Critical Boot Files
Naming all the critical boot files for Windows 2000/XP is akin to naming ev-
ery muscle in the human body—completely possible, but time-consuming
and without any real benefit. However, a few of the most important files cer-
tainly deserve a short mention.
Once NTLDR finishes detections, it loads NTOSKRNL.EXE, HAL.DLL,
some of the Registry, and some basic device drivers; then it passes control to
the NTOSKRNL.EXE file. NTOSKRNL.EXE completes the Registry
loading, initializes all device drivers, and starts the WINLOGON
.EXE program, which displays the Windows 2000/XP logon
screen (Figure 11.52).
Take the time to memorize the primary boot files and the boot
process for Windows 2000/XP. Most boot errors are easily re-
paired if you know which files are used for booting and in which
order they load.
The Vista/7 Boot Process
Windows Vista has a very different boot process than previous
versions of Windows. For one thing, Vista supports both BIOS
and UEFI, whereas older versions of Windows did not, so things
are a bit more complex right off the bat. Instead of having a unified Win-
dows Vista boot process, there are actually two slightly different boot pro-
cesses: one for systems using BIOS and one for systems with UEFI.
The very first thing that happens when you power on a system with
Windows Vista is that either the BIOS or the UEFI starts up. The difference
between BIOS and UEFI systems is in what happens next. In a BIOS-based
system, the BIOS uses its boot order to scan partitions, one by one, for a Mas-
ter Boot Record (MBR). The MBR holds a small bit of file system boot code
that scans the system’s partition ta-
ble for the system partition and then
loads its boot sector. The boot sector
in turn contains code that does noth-
ing but point the boot process to-
ward
a
file
called
BOOTMGR
(pronounced “boot manager,” or
384

The Recovery Console can be
used to restore damaged/corrupt
or missing NTLDR and Ntdetect
.com files from the Windows XP
CD-ROM.
Cross Check
Editing BOOT.INI
In Chapter 4, “Learning Windows,” you learned about another tool
used to edit the BOOT.INI file in Windows 2000/XP. What tool was
that? Does it work in Vista?

“boot mugger” if you’re trying to make nerds laugh). On an UEFI system,
on the other hand, neither the MBR nor the file system boot code is run, and
UEFI simply loads up BOOTMGR directly.
If you’ve ever run a dual-boot system with Vista on it, you’re probably
already somewhat familiar with the BOOTMGR; one of its jobs is displaying
that “Which operating system do you want to load?” screen and then load-
ing the appropriate operating system. When the BOOTMGR starts, it reads
data from a Boot Configuration Data (BCD) file that contains information
about the various operating systems installed on the system as well as in-
structions for how to actually load (bootstrap) them. Once an operating sys-
tem is selected (or immediately if only one is present), BOOTMGR loads a
program called WINLOAD.EXE, which readies your system to load the op-
erating system kernel itself rather like the way you clean up your house be-
fore Aunt Edna comes to visit. It does this by loading into memory the
hardware abstraction layer, the system Registry, and the drivers for any
boot devices before the operating system itself takes over.
Once the operating system process (called NTOSKRNL.EXE) takes over,
it loads up all of the various processes and systems that comprise Windows,
the Windows Vista logo comes up, and you’re happily computing, com-
pletely oblivious to all of the complex electronic communication that just
took place inside your computer.
No Installation Is Perfect
Even when the installation seems smooth, issues may slowly surface, espe-
cially in the case of upgrades. Be prepared to reinstall applications or deal
with new functions that were absent in the previous OS. If things really fall
apart, you can go back to the previous OS or, if you have an OEM computer
(one built by, for example, Dell or HP instead of by you), your computer
likely came with either a special recovery partition on its hard drive or a set
of recovery discs that you can utilize to restore your operating system to its
factory settings. You usually invoke a system recovery by hitting a certain
key during boot-up—usually F10 or F11—and then following a set of
prompts.
The procedures I’ve laid out in this chapter may seem like a lot of
work—how bad could it be to grab an installation CD/DVD-ROM, fling a
copy of Windows onto a system, and, as the saying goes, let the chips fall
where they may? Plenty bad, is how bad. Not only is understanding these
procedures important for the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam; they can also
save your, ah, hide, once you’re a working PC tech and you’re tasked to in-
stall the latest version of Windows on the boss’s new computer!
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows

Tech Tip
BOOTMGR Is
Missing!
If you use Vista long enough, you
may encounter an error message
saying that Windows cannot boot
because the BOOTMGR is miss-
ing. This message is generated
when the boot sector code is un-
able to locate the BOOTMGR,
which can be caused by file sys-
tem corruption, a botched instal-
lation, or viruses.
BOOTMGR is also responsi-
ble for bringing Windows out of
hibernation, so if your computer
refuses to wake up, blame
BOOTMGR!
Unlike with Windows 2000
and XP, the boot files and the
system files must all reside on
the same partition in Vista and
Windows 7.
Boot Configuration Data
(BCD) replaces the boot.ini used
in previous operating systems
and can be altered by using the
command-line tool bcdedit.exe.

Chapter 11 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about Windows.
Identify and implement preinstallation tasks
■
Identify hardware requirements, making sure your
computer meets the recommended minimums for
CPU, RAM, free hard disk space, video adapter,
display, and other components. Check the
Windows Logo’d Product List or the Windows
Compatibility Center at the Microsoft Web site to
verify that the Windows version you’re installing
supports the hardware and application software
you will run.
■
A clean OS installation takes place on a new hard
drive or one that has been reformatted and
repartitioned. You must reinstall all applications
and reconfigure user preferences. In an upgrade
installation, the new OS is installed in the directory
where the old OS was located. The new OS retains
the hardware and software settings of the old OS,
including user preferences. Before you upgrade,
back up any data that the user has saved on the
local hard drive.
■
Use the most advanced file system your version of
Windows supports unless you are planning a
multiboot configuration. Windows Vista will not
multiboot with another OS on the same partition.
Install and upgrade Windows 2000, Windows XP,
and Windows Vista
■
You can install Windows 2000 with floppy
diskettes or a CD-ROM. Windows XP does not
create a set of setup boot disks and does not use a
floppy disk by default. If you install from the CD,
you must add an optical drive to your PC’s boot
sequence and boot directly to the Windows 2000 or
Windows XP CD-ROM. If this isn’t possible in
Windows XP, you can download a set of six setup
boot floppy disks from the Microsoft Web site.
■
You can install Windows Vista/7 from a DVD-
ROM, a USB drive, or specially ordered CD-ROMs,
from over a network, or by using a disc image.
■
During installation, you will be prompted for
registration information, including your name,
address, and other details. Registration is optional.
Designed to prevent a Windows license from being
used for more than one PC, Microsoft Product
Activation (MPA) is mandatory within 30 days of
installing Windows XP, Vista, or 7, or the operating
system will be disabled. You can activate the OS by
using an Internet connection or by calling
Microsoft. You give Microsoft an installation
code—a 50-digit value that identifies your key
hardware components—and Microsoft gives you a
42-digit product activation code.
■
To do a clean installation of Windows 2000/XP,
boot the computer to the Windows installation
disc, which will copy files to your hard drive. You
then remove the disc, the system reboots, and
Windows loads system devices and displays the
Welcome to Setup screen. When prompted, accept
the End User License Agreement (EULA). If
necessary, create a new partition (default size or
smaller). After you select the partition where
Windows should be installed and the file system to
use (NTFS is recommended), Setup copies files to
the Windows folder and appropriate subfolders.
Several reboots later and you’re good to go.
■
Installing Windows Vista/7 is very different from
installing 2000 or XP, but most of the concepts are
the same. You still boot the computer from the
installation disc, accept a EULA, partition your
system drive, and enter a product key. You just do
all those things in a different order and by using a
graphical user interface instead of a primitive text
mode.
■
The system requirements for Windows Vista are
slightly different, depending on whether you’re
installing the Home Basic edition or any other
edition. The non-Basic editions all require a 1-GHz
processor, 1 GB of RAM, and 40 GB of hard drive
space (with at least 15 MB of free space); a DirectX
9 capable graphics card with at least 128 MB of
memory, pixel shader 2.0 support, the WDDM
driver, and 32 bits per pixel; a network card with
386
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Internet access; and a DVD drive. Home Basic is
similar but only requires 512 MB of RAM, a 20-GB
hard drive (again, with 15 GB free), and a basic 32-
MB graphics card without any fancy features.
■
You can automate the installation process through
scripted installations and disk cloning. Windows
2000 and Windows XP can use Setup Manager to
help you create an answer file that contains all of
the answers to the installation questions, such as
computer name, locale, screen resolution, and so
on. Windows Vista comes with the Automated
Installation Kit (AIK) that you can use to create an
answer file. It’s a substantially more complex tool
than the older Setup Manager.
■
With disc cloning, you simply take an existing PC
and make a full copy of the drive, including all
data, software, and configuration files. You can
then transfer that copy to as many machines as you
like, essentially creating clones of the original
machine.
Troubleshoot installation problems
■
Although the installation process itself rarely fails,
you may encounter an installation failure caused
by something else. Text mode errors during a clean
installation may range from “No Boot Device
Present” (the startup disk is bad or CMOS is not set
to look at the appropriate drive first), to “Drive C:
does not contain a Valid FAT Partition” (there is no
partition or a partition Windows cannot use), to
insufficient space on the drive. If you get a “Not
Ready Error on CD-ROM,” you could have a
damaged installation disc or a slow optical drive
that needs to catch up. A stop error (Blue Screen of
Death) after the reboot at the end of the text mode
points to a hardware incompatibility problem.
■
Graphical mode errors indicate a different set of
problems than text mode errors. Windows Setup
must be able to detect the computer type
(especially the motherboard and BIOS) and install
the correct hardware abstraction layer (HAL). You
may get a hardware detection error if Windows
Setup fails to detect a device. If it is a noncritical
piece of hardware, you can work on this problem
later. This error may be solved by finding the
proper driver.
■
Probably the most common installation problem is
failure to read the compressed Windows OS
distribution files called CAB files. Try copying
these files to your local hard drive and running the
Setup program from there.
■
If the system locks up during installation, do not
press CTRL-ALT-DEL or the Reset button to restart
the installation. Instead, unplug the system and
then turn it back on so Windows will recognize a
partial installation and go to the Safe Recovery
mode, where it can often complete the installation.
A bad CD-ROM, optical drive, or hard drive can
cause an installation lockup.
■
During installation, Windows creates several log
files. The two files of interest are SETUPLOG.TXT,
which tracks the installation process (logging
success and failures), and SETUPAPI.LOG, which
tracks each piece of hardware as it is installed
and shows you the last device installed before
Windows locked up. Windows 2000 and XP store
these log files in the OS installation directory
(usually WINNT or Windows).
Identify and implement post-installation tasks
■
The first essential tasks post installation include
updating Windows by applying patches you
download from Microsoft and updating drivers for
hardware to the latest and hopefully most stable
versions.
■
After updating, you can go through the process of
restoring a user’s files through the various backup
utilities available or by using the Files and Settings
Transfer Wizard (FSTW) or Windows Easy
Transfer.
■
When migrating data to a new computer, it’s
important to follow three principles: migrate in a
secure environment, remove data remnants when
disposing of hard drives, and recycle old
equipment.
■
Completely removing data from a hard drive is
difficult, short of physically destroying the drive.
Tools such as Webroot’s Window Washer are
necessary to permanently erase files.
■
When getting rid of old computer parts, it’s
important to recycle or donate them. This is not
only helpful to the environment but also to the
community.
Chapter 11: Installing and Upgrading Windows
387

Explain the structures created during the
installation process
■
Windows 2000 and XP use three primary system
files (NTLDR, BOOT.INI, and NTDETECT.COM)
to boot the system. These three files find and boot
the operating system (NTOSKRNL.EXE) as well as
any files necessary to run the OS.
■
NTLDR is responsible for starting the operating
system process in Windows 2000 and XP, and it
does so by reading the BOOT.INI file, using its
own tiny file system.
■
The BOOT.INI file stores information about the
location of all operating systems installed on the
system.
■
NTDETECT.COM detects the hardware on a
Windows 2000/XP system before the actual
OS is loaded.
■
The Windows Vista/7 boot process first loads
up some code in the MBR, which in turn calls
the BOOTMGR. The BOOTMGR uses Boot
Configuration Data (BCD) files to present the user
with a list of all of the system’s installed operating
systems. Once an OS has been selected, the
BOOTMGR loads a program called WINLOAD.EXE,
which prepares the system environment for the
operating system before loading the NTOSKRNL.

I
n Chapter 3, “The Visible PC,” you learned how to recognize and connect a
number of common devices and the ports they use. This chapter discusses a
number of common and not-so-common input/output (I/O) devices that use the
ports you’ve already learned about.
The CompTIA A+ Essentials exam objectives split computer I/O devices
into three groups: common, multimedia, and specialty. Common I/O devices,
such as keyboards and mice, are found on virtually every PC. Multimedia I/O
devices support video and sound functions. Specialty I/O devices run the gamut
from common (touch screens) to rare (biometric devices). In fact, the exam
deals with an entire set of I/O devicesnetworking devicesas completely
distinct technologies. This book dedicates entire chapters to sound and video,
printing, and networking, providing details about dealing with these types of
devices and the ports they use. This chapter concentrates on two of the I/O
device groups: the common devices and the specialty devices. You’ll learn how
to identify both the most common and some of the most unusual I/O devices
used in today’s PCs.

■Common I/O Devices
So what is a “common” I/O device? I’m hoping you immediately thought of
the mouse and the keyboard, two of the most basic, necessary, and abused I/O
devices on a computer. Another fairly common input device that’s been
around a long time is the scanner. To these oldsters, you can add relative new-
comers to the world of common devices: digital cameras and Web cameras.
Keyboards
Keyboards are both the oldest and still the primary way you input data into
a PC. Windows comes with perfectly good drivers for any keyboard, al-
though some fancier keyboards may come with specialized keys that re-
quire a special driver be installed to operate properly. About the only issue
that might affect keyboard installation is if you’re using a USB keyboard:
make sure that the USB Keyboard Support option is enabled in
your CMOS (Figure 12.1). The other main issue with key-
boards has been mostly solved with the proliferation of USB
keyboards—older keyboards using the now-outdated PS/2
port had to be installed before the computer was booted. If
you tried to plug in a PS/2 keyboard after your computer had
started up, it wouldn’t work.
There’s not much to do to configure a standard keyboard. The only con-
figuration tool you might need is the Keyboard Control Panel applet. This
tool enables you to change the repeat delay (the amount of time you must
hold down a key before the keyboard starts repeating the character), the re-
peat rate (how quickly the character is repeated after the repeat delay), and
the default cursor blink rate. Figure 12.2 shows the default Windows
Chapter 12: Learning Input/Output

If you want to get picky, these
five common I/O devices enable
a user only to input data; they
don’t provide any output at all.

Tech Tip
Wireless Keyboards
and Batteries
Wireless keyboards are a wonder-
ful convenience because they re-
move the cable between you and
the PC, but make sure you keep a
complete set of spare batteries
around.
• Figure 12.2

Keyboard Properties windowsome keyboard makers provide drivers that
add extra tabs.
Keyboards might be easy to install, but they do fail occasionally. Given
their location—right in front of you—the three issues that cause the most
keyboard problems stem from spills, physical damage, and dirt.
Spilling a soda onto your keyboard can make for a really bad day. If
you’re quick and unplug the keyboard from the PC before the liquid hits the
electrical components, you might be able to save the keyboard.
It’ll take some cleaning, though (keep reading for cleaning
tips). More often than not, you’ll get a sticky, ill-performing
keyboard that is not worth the hassle—just replace it!
Other common physical damage comes from dropping ob-
jects onto the keyboard, such as a heavy book (like the one in
your hands). This can have bad results! Most keyboards are
pretty resilient, though, and can bounce back from the hit.
Clean dirt and grime off the keys by using a cloth damp-
ened with a little water, or if the water alone doesn’t do the job,
use a bit of isopropyl alcohol on a cloth (Figure 12.3).
Dirty keys might be unsightly, but dirt under the keys
might cause the keyboard to stop working completely. When
your keys start to stick, grab a bottle of compressed air and
shoot some air under the keys. Do this outside or over a trash
canyou’ll be amazed how much junk gets caught under the
keys! If you really mess up a keyboard by dumping a chocolate
milkshake on the keys, you’re probably going to need to dis-
mantle the keyboard to clean it. This is pretty easy as long as
you keep track of where all of the parts go. Keyboards are
made of layers of plastic that create the electrical connections
when you press a key. Unscrew the keyboard (keep track of
the screws!) and gently peel away the plastic layers, using a
damp cloth to clean each layer (Figure 12.4). Allow the sheets
to dry and then reassemble the keyboard.
Sometimes dirt or foreign objects get under individ-
ual keys, requiring you to remove the key to get to the
dirt or object. Removing individual keys from a key-
board is risky business, because keyboards are set up in
many different ways. Most manufacturers use a process
in which keys are placed on a single plastic post. In that
case, you may use a screwdriver or other flat tool to
safely pop off the key (Figure 12.5). Be careful! You’ll
need to use a good amount of force and the key will fly
across the room. Other keyboard makers (mainly on
laptops) use tiny plastic pins shaped like scissors. In that
case, beware—if you try prying one of these off, you’ll
permanently break the key!
The bottom line when it comes to stuck keys is that
the keyboard’s probably useless with the stuck key, so
you might as well try to clean it. Worse comes to worst,
you can always buy another keyboard.

Mice
Have you ever tried to use Windows without a mouse?
It’s not fun, but it can be done. All techs eventually learn
the Windows navigation hot keys for those times when
mice fail, but all in all we do love our mice. Like key-
boards, Windows comes with excellent drivers for all
standard mice; the exception you’re likely to encounter is
the more advanced mice that come with extra buttons.
Conveniently, the built-in Windows drivers consider a
mouse’s scroll wheel to be standard equipment and will
support it.
You can adjust your mouse settings through the
Mouse Control Panel applet. Figure 12.6 shows the Win-
dows 2000 version. Be aware that the Mouse Properties
window in Windows 2000 uses a different layout than
that of Windows Vista (Figure 12.7) or Windows XP
(which are almost identical).
All of the settings you need for adjusting your mouse can be found in the
Mouse Properties window. In particular, make sure to adjust the mouse
speed, double-click speed, and acceleration to fit your preferences. Mouse
speed and double-click speed are obvious, but mouse acceleration needs a
bit of explaining as it has changed from Windows 2000 to Windows XP and
Windows Vista. Originally, mouse acceleration referred to a feature that
caused the mouse speed to increase when the mouse moved a relatively
large distance across the screen. The Windows 2000 Mouse Properties

Tech Tip
A Clean Mouse Is a
Happy Mouse!
As with keyboards, the biggest
troublemaker for mice is dirt.
Whenever a mouse stops working
or begins to act erratically, al-
ways check first for dirt.
Everything in this section
works equally well for trackballs.

window included a Motion tab where you could set the mouse speed and
acceleration. Windows XP and Vista dropped the Motion tab in favor of an
Enhance pointer precision checkbox on the Pointer Options tab (Figure 12.8).
Enhance pointer precision is a much more advanced form of automatic ac-
celeration. Although it works well, it can cause erratic mouse movements in
some applications.
396
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Windows Vista Mouse Control Panel applet

Enhance pointer precision checkbox on the Pointer Options tab

Currently, two types of mouse technologies dominate the market:
ball mice and optical mice. Ball mice use a small round ball, while opti-
cal mice use LEDs or lasers and a camera to track their movements and
thus move the mouse pointer across the screen. The problem with ball
mice is that the ball inside the mouse picks up dirt over time and depos-
its the dirt on internal rollers that contact the ball. Dirt builds up to the
point that the mouse stops responding smoothly. If you are struggling
with your mouse to point at objects on your screen, you need to clean
the mouse. Few mice manufacturers still make ball mice, as they tend
to require far more maintenance than optical mice.
To access the internals of a ball mouse, turn it over and remove the
protective cover over the mouse ball. The process of removing the cover
varies, but it usually involves rotating the collar that surrounds the ball
until the collar pops out (Figure 12.9). Be careful—without the collar, the
mouse ball will drop out the instant you turn the mouse upright.
Use any nonmetallic tool to scrape the dirt from the roller without
scratching or gouging the device. Although you could use a commer-
cial “mouse cleaning kit,” I find that a fingernail or a pencil eraser
cleans the rollers quite nicely and at much less expense (Figure 12.10).
Clean a ball mouse in this way at least every two or three months.
Optical mice require little maintenance and almost never need
cleaning, as the optics that make them work are never in contact with
the grimy outside world. On the rare occasion where an optical mouse be-
gins to act erratically, try using a cloth or damp cotton swab to clean out any
bits of dirt that may be blocking the optics (Figure 12.11).

Scanners
You can use a scanner to make digital copies of existing paper photos,
documents, drawings, and more. Better scanners give you the option of
copying directly from a photographic negative or slide, providing images
of stunning visual quality—assuming the original photo was halfway de-
cent, of course! In this section, you’ll look at how scanners work and then
turn to what you need to know to select the correct scanner for you or
your clients.
How Scanners Work
All consumer-level scanners—called flatbed scanners—work the same
way. You place a photo or other object facedown on the glass, close the
lid, and then use software to initiate the scan. The scanner runs a bright
light along the length of the glass tray once or more to capture the image.
Figure 12.12 shows an open scanner.
The scanning software that controls the hardware can be manifested
in a variety of ways. Nearly every manufacturer has some sort of drivers
and other software to create an interface between your computer and the
scanner. When you push the front button on the Epson Perfection
scanner, for example, the Epson software opens the Photoshop program
as well as its own interface, as shown in Figure 12.13.
398
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 12.12

• Figure 12.13

You can also open your favorite image-editing software first and choose
to acquire a file from a scanner. Figure 12.14 shows the process of acquiring
an image from a scanner in the popular shareware image-editing software,
Paint Shop Pro. As in most such software, you choose File | Import and then
select a source. In this case, the scanner uses the traditional TWAIN drivers.
TWAIN stands for Technology Without an Interesting Name—I’m not making
this up!—and has been the default driver type for scanners for a long time.
At this point, the drivers and other software controlling the scanner
pop up, providing an interface with the scanner (as shown in Figure 12.14).
Here you can set the resolution of the image as well as many other options.
How to Choose a Scanner
You must consider five primary variables when choosing a scanner: resolu-
tion, color depth, grayscale depth, connection, and scan speed. You can and
will adjust the first three during the scanning process, although probably only
down from their maximum. You need to decide on the connection before you
buy. The scan speed relates to all four of the other variables, and the maxi-
mum speed is hard-coded into the scanner.
Configurable Variables
Scanners convert the scanned image
into a grid of dots. The maximum number of dots determines
how well you can capture an image and how the image will
look when scaled up in size. Most folks use the term resolution
to define the grid size. As you might imagine, the higher the
resolution, the better the scanned image will look and scale.
Older scanners can create images of only 600 × 600 dots
per inch (dpi), while newer models commonly achieve four
times that density and high-end machines do much more.
Manufacturers cite two sets of numbers for a scanner’s resolu-
tion: the resolution it achieves mechanically—called the opti-
cal resolution—and the enhanced resolution it can achieve
with assistance from some onboard software.
The enhanced resolution numbers are useless. I recom-
mend at least 2400 × 2400 dpi optical resolution or better, al-
though you can get by with a lower resolution for purely
Web-destined images.
The color depth of a scan defines the number of bits of information the
scanner can use to describe each individual dot. This number determines
color, shade, hue, and so forth, so a higher number makes a dramatic differ-
ence in your picture quality. With binary numbers, each extra bit of informa-
tion doubles the quality. An 8-bit scan, for example, can save up to 256 color
variations per dot. A 16-bit scan, in contrast, can save up to 65,536 varia-
tions, not the 512 that you might expect!
Modern scanners come in 24-bit, 36-bit, and 48-bit variations. These
days, 48-bit scanners are common enough that you shouldn’t have to settle
for less, even on a budget. Figures 12.15, 12.16, and 12.17 show pretty clearly
the difference resolution makes when scanning.
Scanners differ a lot in grayscale depth, a number that defines how many
shades of gray the scanner can save per dot. This matters if you work with
black-and-white images in any significant way, because grayscale depth is
usually a much lower number than color depth. Current consumer-level

Optical Character
Recognition
In addition to loading pictures
into your computer, many scan-
ners offer a feature called optical
character recognition (OCR), a
way to scan a document and have
the computer turn the picture
into text that you can manipulate
by using a word processing pro-
gram. Many scanners come with
OCR software, such as ABBYY
FineReader.

scanners come in 8-bit, 12-bit, and 16-bit grayscale varieties. I recommend
16-bit or better.
Connection
Almost all modern scanners plug into the USB port on your
PC, although some high-end models offer FireWire as well. Older scanners
come in SCSI and parallel varieties.
Scanning Speed
Scanners have a maximum scanning speed defined by the
manufacturer. The time required to complete a scan is also affected by the
parameters you set; the time increases as you increase the amount of detail
captured. A typical low-end scanner, for example, takes upwards of 30 seconds
to scan a 4 × 6 photo at 300 dpi. A faster scanner, in contrast, can crank out
the same scan in 10 seconds.
Raise the resolution of the scan to 600 dpi at 48-bit resolution, and that
faster scanner can take a full minute to complete the scan. Adjust your scan-
ning settings to optimize for your project. Don’t always go for the highest
possible scan if you don’t need the resolution.
Connections matter as well. A good Hi-Speed USB scanner can scan an
8 × 10 image in about 12 seconds at 300 dpi. I made the mistake of taking
the scanner to a friend’s house to scan some of her jewelry, but she had
only a Full-Speed USB port. I plugged the scanner into her PC and it took
about 45 seconds to scan each 8 × 10 image. We were up all night finishing
the project!
Installation and Scanning Tips
Most USB and FireWire devices require you to install the software drivers be-
fore you plug in the device for the first time. I have run into exceptions, though,
so I strongly suggest you read the scanner’s documentation before you install.
As a general rule, you should obtain the highest quality scan you can
manage, and then play with the size and image quality when it’s time to in-
clude it in a Web site or an e-mail. The amount of RAM in your system—and
to a lesser extent, the processor speed—dictates how big a file you can handle.
For example, don’t do 8 × 10 scans at 600 dpi if you have only 128 MB of
RAM, because the image file alone weighs in at over 93 MB. Because your oper-
ating system, scanner software, image-editing program, and a lot of other
things are taking up plenty of that RAM already, your system will likely crash.
If you travel a lot, you’ll want to make sure to use the locking mechanism for
the scanner light assembly. Just be sure to unlock before you try to use it or you’ll
get a light that’s stuck in one position. That won’t make for very good scans!
Digital Cameras
Another option available for those not-yet-taken pictures is to put away
your point-and-shoot film camera and use a digital camera. Digital cameras
electronically simulate older film technology and provide a wonderful tool
for capturing a moment and then sending it to friends and relatives.
In a short period of time, digital camera prices have gone from levels that
made them the province of a few wealthy technogeeks to being competitive
with a wide range of electronic consumer goods. Because digital cameras in-
terface with computers, CompTIA A+ certified techs need to know the basics.

Sometimes when installing a
scanner or other device, Windows
will give you an error message
warning you about installing
unsigned drivers. Microsoft has
a program where device manu-
facturers can submit drivers to
be tested by Microsoft, at which
point they are given a digital
signature that verifies they work.
Not all manufacturers bother to
do this, however, so if you trust
the manufacturer, there probably
isn’t any harm in ignoring this
warning.

Storage Media—Digital Film for Your Camera
Every consumer-grade camera saves the pictures it takes onto some type of
removable storage media. Think of it as your digital film. Probably the most
common removable storage media used in modern digital cameras (and
probably your best choice) is the Secure Digital (SD) card (Figure 12.18).
About the size of a Wheat Thin (roughly an inch square), you can find these
tiny cards with capacities ranging from 64 MB to more than 1 GB. They are
among the fastest of the various media types at transferring data to and
from a PC, and they’re quite sturdy.
Connection
These days, almost all digital cam-
eras plug directly into a USB port
(Figure 12.19). Another common
option, though, is to connect only
the camera’s storage media to the
computer, using one of the many
digital media readers available.
You can find readers designed
specifically for SD cards, as well as
other types. Plenty of readers can handle multiple media formats. Many
computers come with a decent built-in digital media reader (Figure 12.20).
Quality
As with scanners, you should consider the amount of information a par-
ticular model of camera can capture, which in the digital camera world
is expressed as some number of megapixels. Instead of light-sensitive
film, digital cameras have one CCD (charged coupled device) or CMOS
(complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) sensor covered with pho-
tosensitive pixels (called photosites) to capture the image; the more pixels
on the sensor, the higher the resolution of the images it captures.
Not so long ago, a 1-megapixel digital camera was the bleeding
edge of digital photographic technology, but now you can find cam-
eras with ten times that resolution for a few hundred dollars. As a basis
of reference, a 2-megapixel camera produces snapshot-sized (4 × 6
inch) pictures with print photograph quality, whereas a 5-megapixel
unit can produce a high-quality 8 × 10 inch print.
Another feature of most digital cameras is the capability
to zoom in on your subject. The way you ideally want to do
this is the way film cameras do it, by using the camera’s op-
tics—that’s the lens. Most cameras above the basic level have
some optical zoom—meaning the zoom is built into the lens
of the camera—but almost all models include multiple levels
of digital zoom, accomplished by some very clever software
in the camera. Choose your camera based on optical zoom:
3× at a minimum or better if you can afford it. Digital zoom is
useless.

Form Factor
As was the case with film cameras, size matters on digital
cameras. Digital cameras come in several form factors.
They range from tiny, ultra-compact models that readily
fit in a shirt pocket to monster cameras with huge lenses.
Although it’s not universally true, the bigger the camera,
the more features and sensors it can have. Thus bigger is
usually better in terms of quality. In shape, they come in
a rectangular package, in which the lens retracts into the
body, or as an SLR-type, with a lens that sticks out of the
body. Figure 12.21 shows both styles.
Web Cameras
PC cameras, often called webcams because their most common use is for
Internet video communication, are fairly new to the world of common I/O
devices. Too many people run out and buy the cheapest one, not appreciat-
ing the vast difference between a discount webcam and more
expensive models; nor do they take the time to configure the
webcam properly. Let’s consider some of the features you
should look for when buying webcams and some of the prob-
lems you can run into when using them.
The biggest issue with webcams is the image quality. Webcams
measure their resolution in pixels. You can find webcams with reso-
lutions of as few as 100,000 pixels and webcams with millions of
pixels. Most people who use webcams agree that 1.3 million pixels
(megapixels) is pretty much the highest resolution quality you can
use before your video becomes so large it will bog down even a
broadband connection.
The next issue with webcams is the frame rate, which is the
number of times the camera “takes your picture” each second.
Higher frame rates make for smoother video; 30 frames per sec-
ond is considered the best. A good camera with a high
megapixel resolution and fast frame rate will provide you with
excellent video conferencing capabilities. Figure 12.22 shows
the author using his headset to chat via webcam using Skype
software.
Most people who use online video also want a microphone.
Many cameras come with microphones, or you can use your own.
Those who do a lot of video chatting may prefer to get a camera
without a microphone and then buy a good quality headset with
which to speak and listen.
Many cameras now can track you when you move, to keep
your face in the picturea handy feature for fidgety folks using
video conferencing! This interesting technology recognizes a
human face with little or no “training” and rotates its position
to keep your face in the picture. Some companies even add
funny extras, which, although not very productive, are good for a laugh
(Figure 12.23).

Video chatting by webcam with Skype

Almost all webcams use USB connections. Windows comes with a lim-
ited set of webcam drivers, so always make sure to install the drivers sup-
plied with the camera before you plug it in. Most webcams use Hi-Speed
USB, so make sure you’re plugging your webcam into a Hi-Speed USB port.
Once the camera’s plugged in, you’ll need to test it. All cameras come
with some type of program, but finding the program can be a challenge. Some
brands put the program in the system tray, some place it in My Computer,
others put it in the Control Paneland some do all three! Figure 12.24 shows
the Control Panel applet that appeared when I installed the webcam driver.
The biggest challenge to using webcams is getting your webcam appli-
cations to recognize that your webcam is available and configured for use.
Every program does this differently, but conceptually the steps are basically
the same (with plenty of exceptions):
1.
Tell the program you want to use a camera.
2.
Tell the program whether you want the camera to turn on automatically
when you chat.

If you’re having problems with a camera, always go through the general
I/O problems first, as this will clear up most problems. If you’re still having
trouble getting the camera to work in a program, be sure to turn off all other
programs that may be using the camera. Windows allows only one program
at a time to use a webcam.
■Specialty I/O Devices
The CompTIA A+ Essentials exam wants to make sure you’re aware of four
other types of I/O devices: biometric scanners, bar code readers, touch
screens, and KVM switches. Let’s look at these fairly specialized devices.
Biometric Devices
If you look up biometrics on the popular Wikipedia Web site, you’ll get the
following definition: “Biometrics (ancient Greek: bios =‘life,’ metron =‘mea-
sure’) is the study of automated methods for uniquely recognizing humans
based upon one or more intrinsic physical or behavioral traits.” (The quote
might differ from what you find because Wikipedia changes pretty fre-
quently, but the gist should be the same.)
The field of biometrics also encompasses a number of security devices,
such as door locks and security cameras, that don’t really fit into the world
of PCs. This section concentrates on the types of biometrics that you can ac-
tually buy and use on your PC. Within the realm of computers, biometrics
includes a huge number of technologies, from thumb drives that read fin-
gerprints to software that does voice recognition.
PCs use biometrics for security. Biometric devices scan and remember
unique aspects of various body parts such as your retina, iris, head image, or
fingerprint, using some form of sensing device such as a retinal scanner.
This information is used as a key to prevent unauthorized people from ac-
cessing whatever the biometric device is securing. Most biometric devices
currently used in PCs secure only themselves. The USB
thumb drive in Figure 12.25 has a tiny fingerprint scanner.
You slide your finger (any finger you choose) over the drive
to unlock the contents of the thumb drive.
Less common are biometric security devices that secure
entire computers. The Microsoft fingerprint scanner is a
USB device that replaces standard user name and password
security. Figure 12.26 shows the scanner built into a key-
board. When a program or Web site asks for a user name
and password, you simply press your finger against the fin-
gerprint scanner. It confirms your identity (assuming your
fingerprint matches), and then special software that comes
with the scanner supplies the program or Web site with
your stored user name and password.
404
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Biometric devices are also used for recognition. Recog-
nition is different from security in that the biometric device
doesn’t care who you are; it just wants to know what you’re
doing. The best example of this is voice recognition. Voice
recognition programs convert human voice input into com-
mands or text. Voice recognition for PCs has been around
for some time. Although it has never achieved enough accu-
racy to replace a keyboard completely, voice recognition is
common in devices that have a limited number of com-
mands to interpret, such as cell phones and PDAs. If you
speak the words “Call Mike Meyers” into your smartphone,
your phone knows what to do—at least, my phone does!
No matter what biometric device you use, you use the
same steps to make it work:
1.
Install the device.
2.
Register your identity with the device by sticking
your eye, finger, or other unique body part (Why are
you snickering?) into the device so it can scan you.
3.
Configure its software to tell the device what to do
when it recognizes your scanned identity.
Bar Code Readers
Bar code readers are designed to read standard Universal Product Code (UPC)
bar codes (Figure 12.27). We read bar codes for only one reasonto track in-
ventory. Bar code readers enable easy updating of inventory databases
stored on PCs. Bar code readers are just about the oldest “specialty” I/O de-
vice used with PCs.
Two types of bar code readers are commonly found
with PCs: pen scanners and hand scanners. Pen scanners
look like an ink pen and must be swiped across the bar code
(Figure 12.28). Hand scanners are held in front of the UPC
code while a button is pressed to scan. All bar code readers
emit a tone to let you know the scan was successful.
Older bar code readers used serial ports, but all of the
newer readers use either PS/2 or USB ports. No configura-
tion is usually necessary, other than making sure that the
particular bar code reader works with whatever database/
point of sale software you use. When in doubt, most people
find the PS/2-style bar code readers work best, as they sim-
ply act like a keyboard. You plug the reader into your key-
board port and then plug your keyboard into the reader.
Then all you need is software that accepts keyboard input
(and what one doesn’t!), and it will work.

Touch Screens
A touch screen is a monitor with some type of sensing device across its face
that detects the location and duration of contact, usually by a finger or sty-
lus. All touch screens then supply this contact information to the PC as
though it were a click event from a mouse. Touch screens are used in situa-
tions for which conventional mouse/keyboard input is either impossible or
impractical. Here are a few places you’ll see touch screens at work:
■
Information kiosks
■
PDAs
■
Point of sale systems
■
Tablet PCs
Touch screens can be separated into two groups: built-in screens like the
ones in PDAs, and standalone touch screen monitors like those used in
many point of sale systems. From a technician’s standpoint, you can think of
a standalone touch screen as a monitor with a built-in mouse. All touch
screens have a separate USB or PS/2 port for the “mouse” part of the device,
along with drivers you install just as you would for any USB mouse.
KVM Switches
A keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) switch is a hardware device that most com-
monly enables multiple computers to be viewed and controlled by a single
mouse, keyboard, and screen. Some KVM switches reverse that capability,
enabling a single computer to be controlled by multiple keyboards, mice, or
other devices. KVM switches are especially useful in data centers where
multiple servers are rack mounted, space is limited, and power is a concern.
An administrator can use a single KVM switch to control multiple server
systems from a single keyboard, mouse, and monitor.
There are many brands and types of KVM switches. Some enable you to
connect to only two systems, and some support hundreds.
Some even come with audio output jacks to support speakers.
Typical KVM switches come with two or more sets of wires
that are used for input devices such as PS/2 and/or USB mice
and video output (Figure 12.29).
To use a KVM switch, you simply connect a keyboard,
mouse, and monitor to the KVM switch and then connect the
KVM switch to the desired computers. Once connected and
properly configured, assigned keyboard hotkeys—a combina-
tion of keys typically assigned by the KVM switch manufac-
turer—enable you to toggle between the computers connected
to the KVM switch. In most cases, you simply tap the SCROLL
LOCK key twice to switch between sessions.
Installing a KVM switch is not difficult; the most important
point to remember is to connect the individual sets of cables
between the KVM ports and each computer one at a time,
keeping track of which keyboard, mouse, and video cable go to
which computers. (I highly recommend labeling and using
twist or zip ties.)
406
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 12.29
A typical KVM switch

If you get the connections wrong, the KVM switch won’t function as de-
sired. If you connect a mouse and keyboard wires to the correct KVM port,
for example, but attach the same computer’s video cable to a different port
on the KVM switch, you won’t get the correct video when you try to switch
to that computer. The same holds true for the mouse and keyboard cables.
Don’t cross the cables!
Chapter 12: Learning Input/Output
407
Older KVM switches are said
to be passive, meaning they
don’t continuously communicate
with all connected systems. This
can cause problems if the con-
nected systems automatically
reboot after a power surge or
loss. Modern-day active KVM
switches resolve this issue
through peripheral emulation,
meaning they communicate with
and monitor all systems con-
nected to the KVM switch.

Chapter 12 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises,
you should understand the following about input/output.
Identify certain common input/output devices on a PC
■
Keyboards are the oldest type of input device and
still the primary way users input data. Although a
keyboard works without the installation of additional
drivers, you need to install drivers for specialty
keyboards, such as keyboards with fancy buttons
or other programmable features. If you’re using a
USB keyboard, make sure to enable USB keyboard
support in CMOS Setup.
■
Configure basic keyboard settings in the Keyboard
Control Panel applet. You can change the repeat
delay, repeat rate, and cursor blink rate. Clean dirty
keys with a damp cloth or isopropyl alcohol.
Compressed air works well to dislodge hair, dust,
and other small objects from the keys. With most
keyboards you can pop off individual keys to do
some deep cleaning. Some keyboards (such as those
on laptops) are not meant to have keys removed and
doing so might permanently damage the keyboard.
■
Mice work with the generic Windows drivers. You
only need to install mouse drivers if your mouse
has special programmable features, such as additional
buttons. Various mouse settings can be configured
via the Mouse Control Panel applet. Configurable
settings include mouse speed, double-click speed,
and acceleration.
■
The internal rubber ball on a ball mouse should be
cleaned every few months. Rotate the collar on the
underside of the mouse to release the rubber ball.
Optical mice, which use LEDs or lasers to track
movement, may occasionally need their lenses wiped
free of grime, but overall outperform and outlive
ball mice.
■
Flatbed scanners have a hinged lid and flat glass
surface on which you can place material to be scanned.
Most scanners come with software to control the
hardware and to control the scanning process itself.
The scan software allows you to select the color
mode and resolution of the scanned document.
Scanners use a traditional TWAIN driver to transfer
digital images to the PC. Some scanners offer
additional features, such as OCR capabilities.
■
When choosing a scanner, consider the scanner’s
optical resolution (ignore the enhanced resolution),
color depth, grayscale depth, connection type, and
scan speed. The higher these numbers, the better
quality the scanned images will be. Shoot for a
minimum 2400 × 2400 dpi optical resolution, 48-bit
color depth, 16-bit grayscale depth, and a Hi-Speed
USB or FireWire connection.
■
Most digital cameras store images on removable
media, such as SD cards. Photos can be transferred
to a PC by connecting the camera directly to a USB
or FireWire port. Alternatively, if the PC is equipped
with a media card reader, the flash memory card
can be removed from the camera and inserted
directly into the PC’s card reader.
■
A 2-megapixel camera will produce 4 × 6 pictures
with print photograph quality, while a 5-megapixel
camera will produce 8 × 10 pictures with print
photograph quality. The more sensors a camera has,
the better the image quality, soyou’ll find that physically
larger cameras take better pictures than the tiny ones.
Look for a camera with at least 3× optical zoom and
ignore the digital zoom that is advertised.
■
Webcams are often used for Internet video
communication. A 1.3-megapixel webcam delivers
a decent-resolution video without bogging down a
broadband connection. Look for a webcam that has
a frame rate of about 30 frames per second. Some
webcams come with built-in microphones, but if
you want high-quality audio without feedback or
echo, invest in a microphone headset. After
installing the driver and connecting a webcam, be
sure to configure it properly so your Internet chat
software knows to use the webcam.
Describe how certain specialty input/output devices
work on a PC
■
Biometric devices scan various body parts, such as
fingerprints or retinas, for authentication, security,
and recognition. Some biometric devices control
access to an entire PC, while some small devices,
such as USB thumb drives, have biometric fingerprint
408
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

scanners built in to control access to the single
device. Voice recognition allows users to speak
commands to the computer, such as “Call Mike
Meyers” to dial the phone via a modem.
■
Bar code readers read the standard Universal Product
Code (UPC) bar code. The two types of bar code
readers are pen scanners and hand scanners. Pen
scanners look like ink pens and must be swiped
across the bar code. Hand scanners are aimed at the
bar code and when a button or trigger is pressed, the
reader scans the bar code. All bar code scanners
produce an audible tone to verify that the bar code
has been read. Old bar code readers used serial ports,
but newer ones use either USB or PS/2 connections.
■
Tablet PCs feature touch screens, as do information
kiosks, PDAs, and point of sale systems. Touch
screens can be operated with either a finger or a
stylus. Some devices, such as PDAs, have built-in
touch screens, while a point of sale system may use
a standalone touch screen monitor.
■
KVM switches are hardware devices with which
multiple systems can be monitored and controlled
by a single mouse, keyboard, and monitor. KVMs
are most commonly used in datacenters, enabling
administrators to control multiple rack-mounted
servers from a single keyboard, mouse, and
monitor station.

T
he term video encompasses a complex interaction among numerous parts
of the PC, all designed to put a picture on the screen. The monitor or
video display shows you what’s going on with your programs and operating
system. It’s the primary output device for the PC. The video card or display
adapter handles all of the communication between the CPU and the monitor
(Figure 13.1). The operating system needs to know how to handle
communication between the CPU and the display adapter, which requires
drivers specific for each card and proper setup within Windows. Finally, each
application needs to be able to interact with the rest of the video system.
Let’s look at monitors and video cards individually. I’ll bring them back
together as a team later in the chapter so you can understand the many nuances
that make video so challenging. Even later in the chapter, you’ll look at sound
cards, video capture cards, and TV tuners, all of which work together to make
the PC a premium multimedia platform. Let’s begin with the video display and
then move on from there.

■Video Displays
To understand displays, you need a good grasp of each
component and how they work together to make a beauti-
ful (or not so beautiful) picture on the screen. Different
types of displays use different methods and technologies to
accomplish this task. Video displays for PCs come in three
varieties: CRT, LCD, and projectors. The first two you’ll see
on the desktop or laptop; the last you’ll find in boardrooms
and classrooms, splashing a picture onto a screen.
CRT Monitors
Cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors were the original computer monitors—those
heavy, boxy monitors that take up half your desk. Although for the most part
they’ve been replaced by LCD technology on new systems, plenty of CRT mon-
itors are still chugging away in the field. As the name implies, this type of dis-
play contains a large cathode ray tube, a type of airtight vacuum tube. One end
of this tube is a slender cylinder that contains three electron guns. The other end
of the tube, which is fatter and wider, is the display screen.
Before we begin in earnest, I want to give you a note of warning about the
inside of a traditional monitor. I will discuss what can be repaired and what
requires more specialized expertise. Make no mistake—the interior of a moni-
tor might appear similar to the interior of a PC because of the printed circuit
boards and related components, but the similarity ends there. No PC has volt-
ages exceeding 15,000 to 30,000 V, but most monitors do. So let’s get one thing
perfectly clear: opening up a monitor can kill you! Even when the power is
disconnected, certain components retain a substantial voltage for an extended
period of time. You can inadvertently short one of the components and fry
yourself—to death. Given this risk, certain aspects of monitor repair lie out-
side the necessary skill set for a normal PC support person, and definitely out-
side the CompTIA A+ certification exam domains! I will show you how
to address the problems you can fix safely and make sure you
understand the ones you need to hand over to a monitor shop.
The inside of the display screen has a phosphor coating.
When power is applied to one or more of the electron guns, a
stream of electrons shoots towards the display end of the CRT
(Figure 13.2). Along the way, this stream is subjected to mag-
netic fields generated by a ring of electromagnets called a yoke
that controls the electron beam’s point of impact. When the
phosphor coating is struck by the electron beam, it releases its
energy as visible light.
When struck by a stream of electrons, a phosphor quickly re-
leases a burst of energy. This happens far too quickly for the hu-
man eye and brain connection to register. Fortunately, the
phosphors on the display screen have a quality called persistence,
which means the phosphors continue to glow after being struck
by the electron beam. Too much persistence and the image is
smeary; too little and the image appears to flicker. The perfect
combination of beam and persistence creates the illusion of a solid
picture.

The inside of a CRT has very
high voltage components. These
can, literally, kill you. Be careful!
• Figure 13.2
Electron stream in the CRT

Refresh Rate
The monitor displays video data as the electron guns make a series of hori-
zontal sweeps across the screen, energizing the appropriate areas of the
phosphorous coating. The sweeps start at the upper-left corner of the moni-
tor and move across and down to the lower-right corner. The screen is
“painted” only in one direction; then the electron guns turn and retrace their
path across the screen, to be ready for the next sweep. These sweeps are
called raster lines (Figure 13.3).
The speed at which the electron beam moves across the screen is known
as the horizontal refresh rate (HRR), as shown in Figure 13.4. The monitor
draws a number of lines across the screen, eventually covering the screen
with glowing phosphors. The number of lines is not fixed, unlike television
screens, which have a set number of lines. After the guns reach the lower-
right corner of the screen, they turn off and point back to the upper-left cor-
ner. The amount of time it takes to draw the entire screen and get the elec-
tron guns back to the upper-left corner is called the vertical refresh rate
(VRR), shown in Figure 13.5.
The monitor does not determine the HRR or VRR; the video
card “pushes” the monitor at a certain VRR and then the moni-
tor sets the corresponding HRR. If the video card is set to push
at too low a VRR, the monitor produces a noticeable flicker,
causing eyestrain and headaches for users. Pushing the monitor
at too high a VRR, however, causes a definite distortion of the
screen image and will damage the circuitry of the monitor and
eventually destroy it. The number one killer of monitors is im-
proper VRR settings, and the number one reason your office is
filled with crabby workers is that the VRR is set too low. All
good PC support techs understand this and take substantial
time tweaking the VRR to ensure that the video card pushes the
monitor at the highest VRR without damaging the monitor—

Perfect Flat
All CRT tubes can be categorized
into two types: traditional
curved-screen CRTs and CRTs
that are often referred to as per-
fect flat—using a kind of vac-
uum tube that has a completely
flat screen and no bending
around the edges. The perfect flat
screens offer a wider viewing an-
gle than standard CRT screens.
About the only negative to the
perfect flat screens is that they
tend to lack true black, so pictures
seem just shy of a natural rich-
ness of color and contrast.

Phosphors and Shadow Mask
All CRT monitors contain dots of
phosphorous or some other light-
sensitive compound that glows
red, green, or blue (RGB) when an
electron gun sweeps over it. These
phosphors are evenly distributed
across the front of the monitor
(Figure 13.6).
A normal CRT has three elec-
tron guns: one for the red phos-
phors, one for the blue phosphors,
and one for the green phosphors.
It is important to understand that
the electron guns do not fire col-
ored light; they simply fire elec-
trons
at
different
intensities,
which then make the phosphors
glow. The higher the intensity of
the electron stream, the brighter
the color produced by the glowing phosphor.
Directly behind the phosphors in a CRT is the shadow
mask, a screen that allows only the proper electron gun to
light the proper phosphors (Figure 13.7). This prevents,
for example, the red electron beam from “bleeding over”
and lighting neighboring blue and green dots.
The electron guns sweep across the phosphors as a
group, turning rapidly on and off as they move across the
screen. When the group reaches the end of the screen, it
moves to the next line. It is crucial to understand that turn-
ing the guns on and off, combined with moving the guns
to new lines, creates a mosaic that is the image you see on
the screen. The number of times the guns turn on and off,
combined with the number of lines drawn on the screen,
determines the number of mosaic pieces used to create the
image. Each of these individual pieces is called a pixel,
from the term picture element. You can’t hold a pixel in
your hand; it’s just the area of phosphors lit at one instant
when the group of guns is turned on. The size of pixels can
change, depending on the number of times the group of
guns is turned on and off and the number of lines drawn.
Resolution
Monitor resolution is always shown as the number of hori-
zontal pixels times the number of vertical pixels. A resolu-
tion of 640 × 480, therefore, indicates a horizontal
resolution of 640 pixels and a vertical resolution of 480 pix-
els. If you multiply the values together, you can see how
many pixels are on each screen: 640 × 480 = 307,200 pixels
per screen. An example of resolution affecting the pixel
size is shown in Figure 13.8.

Discovering Your Refresh Rate
You should know the refresh rate for all CRTs you service. Setting up
monitors incorrectly can cause havoc in the workplace, so Try This!
1.
Most PCs have two places where you can discover the current
refresh rate of the monitor. Many monitors offer a menu button
for adjusting the display. Often it shows the refresh rate when
you push it once.
2.
If that doesn’t work, go to the Control Panel and open the Display
applet (Windows 2000/XP) or Personalization applet (Windows
Vista/7). Select the Settings tab (2000/XP) or Display Settings
option (Vista/7) and then click the Advanced or Advanced Settings
button. Select the Monitor tab in the Monitor Properties dialog box.
3.
Write down your refresh rate. How does it compare with that of
your classmates’ monitors?

Some common resolutions are 640 × 480, 800 × 600, 1024 × 768, 1280 × 960,
1280 × 1024, and 1600 × 1200. Notice that most of these resolutions match a
4:3 ratio. This is called the aspect ratio. Many monitors are shaped like televi-
sion screens, with a 4:3 aspect ratio, so most resolutions are designed to
match—or at least be close to—that shape. Other monitors, generically
called wide-screen monitors, have a 16:9 or 16:10 ratio. Two of the common
resolutions you’ll see with these monitors are 1366 × 768 and 1920 × 1200.
The last important issue is to determine the maximum
possible resolution for a monitor. In other words, how
small can one pixel be? Well, the answer lies in the phos-
phors. A pixel must be made up of at least one red, one
green, and one blue phosphor to make any color, so the
smallest theoretical pixel would consist of one group of
red, green, and blue phosphors: a triad (Figure 13.9). Vari-
ous limitations in screens, controlling electronics, and
electron gun technology make the maximum resolution
much bigger than one triad.
Dot Pitch
The resolution of a monitor is defined by the maximum
amount of detail the monitor can render. The dot pitch of
the monitor ultimately limits this resolution. The dot pitch
defines the diagonal distance between phosphorous
dots of the same color, and is measured in millimeters (mm).
Because a lower dot pitch means more dots on the
screen, it usually produces a sharper, more defined image
(Figure 13.10). Dot pitch works in tandem with the maxi-
mum number of lines the monitor can support to determine
the greatest working resolution of the monitor. It might be
possible to place an image at 1600 × 1200 on a 15-inch mon-
itor with a dot pitch of 0.31 mm, but it would not be very
readable.

Resolution versus pixel size
Tech Tip
Trinitron
Not all CRT monitors use dots.
The Sony Trinitron line of CRT
monitors uses bars of red, green,
and blue instead of dots. The
holes in the shadow mask have a
rectangular shape. Many people
feel this makes the monitor’s im-
age much crisper and clearer.
Somebody must agree with them
because the Trinitron enjoys tre-
mendous popularity. Even
though the phosphors and shadow
mask have a different shape, every-
thing you learn here applies to
Trinitrons also.
See the “Modes” section
later in this chapter for the
names of each resolution.
• Figure 13.9
One triad
• Figure 13.10
Measuring dot pitch

The dot pitch can range from
as high as 0.39 mm to as low as
0.18 mm. For most Windows-based
applications on a 17-inch monitor,
many people find that 0.28 mm is
the maximum usable dot pitch that
still produces a clear picture.
Bandwidth
Bandwidth defines the maximum
number of times the electron gun
can be turned on and off per second.
Bandwidth is measured in mega-
hertz (MHz). In essence, band-
width
tells
us
how
fast
the
monitor can put an image on the
screen. A typical value for a better-
quality
17-inch
color
monitor
would be around 150 MHz, which
means that the electron beam can be turned on and off 150 million times per
second. The value for a monitor’s bandwidth determines the maximum
VRR the video card should push the monitor for any given resolution. It
reads as follows:
maximum VRR = bandwidth ÷ pixels per page
For example, what is the maximum VRR that a 17-inch monitor with
a bandwidth of 100 MHz and a resolution of 1024 × 768 can support? The
answer is
maximum VRR = 100,000,000 ÷ (1024 × 768) = 127 Hz
That’s a pretty good monitor, as most video cards do not push beyond
120 Hz! At a resolution of 1200 × 1024, the vertical refresh would be
100,000,000 ÷ (1200 × 1024) = 81 Hz
So, we would make sure to set the video card’s VRR to 80 Hz or less. If
you had a monitor with a bandwidth of only 75 MHz, the maximum VRR at
a 1200 × 1024 resolution would be only 61 Hz.
Most monitor makers know that people aren’t going to take the time to
do these calculations. Instead, they do the calculations for you and create tables
of refresh rates at certain resolutions to show what a monitor can do.
Degaussing
From time to time, your beautiful CRT display might get slightly, well, less
beautiful. Because of the powerful magnets involved in putting a picture up
on your monitor, the monitor’s shadow mask will occasionally pick up
some wonky magnetic fields, distorting or discoloring the displayed image.
Fortunately for you, almost every CRT monitor out there has a degauss button
that removes unwanted magnetic fields and will have your picture looking
fine in no time.

Determine the Dot Pitch of Your Monitor
Have you ever wondered what the dot pitch measurement of a CRT
monitor is? Well, let’s try to figure it out. First, take note of the manufac-
turer and model name/number of your monitor or of any CRT. You
might need this information in a second.
Now, in your best contortionist pose, try to take a look at the back of
your monitor. Normally, there is a small metal plate back there that in-
dicates such information as the model number and serial number of
your monitor. Sometimes this plate also lists a few monitor specifica-
tions, including dot pitch. Did you find it? No? Well then, crawl down
off your desk, slowly, and fire up your favorite Web browser.
Search for the Web site of your monitor’s manufacturer. See if you
can find the technical specifications for your monitor listed on the Web
site. Use the manufacturer, model name, and model number informa-
tion that you wrote down earlier.

Great! Now that you have the basics of CRT monitors, let’s turn to LCD
monitors. Although the technology differs dramatically between the moni-
tor types, most of the terms used for CRTs also apply to LCD functions.
LCD Monitors
Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are the most common type of display technol-
ogy for PCs. LCD monitors have many advantages over CRTs. They are
thinner and lighter, use much less power, are virtually flicker free, and don’t
emit potentially harmful radiation. LCDs still have resolution, refresh rates,
and bandwidth, but LCDs also come with their own family of abbreviations,
jargon, and terms you need to understand so you can install, maintain, and
support LCDs.
How LCDs Work
The secret to understanding LCD panels is to understand the concept of the
polarity of light. Anyone who played with a prism in sixth grade or has
looked at a rainbow knows that light travels in waves (no quantum mechan-
ics here, please!), and the wavelength of the light determines the color. What
you might not appreciate is the fact that light waves emanate from a light
source in three dimensions. It’s impossible to draw a clear diagram of three-
dimensional waves, so instead, let’s use an analogy. To visualize this, think
of light emanating from a flashlight. Now think of the light emanating from
that flashlight as though someone was shaking a jump rope. This is not a
rhythmic shaking, back and forth or up and down; it’s more as if a person
went crazy and was shaking the jump rope all over the place—up, down,
left, right—constantly changing the speed.
That’s how light really acts. Well, I guess we could take the analogy one
step further by saying the person has an infinite number of arms, each hold-
ing a jump rope shooting out in every direction to show the three-
dimensionality of light waves, but (a) I can’t draw that and (b) one jump
rope will suffice to explain LCD panels. The varying speeds create wave-
lengths, from very short to very long. When light comes into your eyes at
many different wavelengths, you see white light. If the light came in only
one wavelength, you would see only that color. Light flowing through a po-
larized filter (like sunglasses) is like putting a picket fence between you and
the people shaking the ropes. You see all of the wavelengths, but only the
waves of similar orientation. You would still see all of the colors, just fewer
of them because you only see the waves of the same orientation, making the
image darker. That’s why many sunglasses use polarizing filters.
Now, what would happen if you added another picket fence but put the
slats in a horizontal direction? This would effectively cancel out all of the
waves. This is what happens when two polarizing filters are combined at a
90-degree angle—no light passes through.
Now, what would happen if you added a third fence between the two
fences with the slats at a 45-degree angle? Well, it would sort of “twist”
some of the shakes in the rope so that the waves could then get through. The
same thing is true with the polarizing filters. The third filter twists some of
the light so that it gets through. If you’re really feeling scientific, go to any
teachers’ supply store and pick up three polarizing filters for about (US)$3
each and try it. It works.
418
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Liquid crystals take advantage of the property of
polarization. Liquid crystals are composed of a specially
formulated liquid full of long, thin crystals that always
want to orient themselves in the same direction, as
shown in Figure 13.11. This substance acts exactly like a
liquid polarized filter. If you poured a thin film of this
stuff between two sheets of glass, you’d get a darn good
pair of sunglasses.
Imagine cutting extremely fine grooves on one side of
one of those sheets of glass. When you place this liquid in
contact with a finely grooved surface, the molecules natu-
rally line up with the grooves in the surface (Figure 13.12).
If you place another finely grooved surface, with
the grooves at a 90-degree orientation to the other sur-
face, opposite of the first one, the molecules in contact
with that side will attempt to line up with it. The mole-
cules in between, in trying to line up with both sides,
will immediately line up in a nice twist (Figure 13.13).

419

Waves of similar orientation
• Figure 13.12
Liquid crystal molecules tend to line up together.
• Figure 13.13
Liquid crystal molecules twisting

If two perpendicular polarizing filters are then placed on either side of
the liquid crystal, the liquid crystal will twist the light and enable it to pass
(Figure 13.14).
If you expose the liquid crystal to an electrical potential, however, the
crystals will change their orientation to match the direction of the electrical
field. The twist goes away and no light passes through (Figure 13.15).
A color LCD screen is composed of a large number of tiny liquid crystal
molecules (called sub-pixels) arranged in rows and columns between polar-
izing filters. A translucent sheet above the sub-pixels is colored red, green,
or blue. Each tiny distinct group of three sub-pixels—one red, one green,
and one blue—forms a physical pixel, as shown in Figure 13.16.

LCD pixels are very different
from the pixels in a CRT. A CRT
pixel’s size changes depending
on the resolution. The pixels in
an LCD panel are fixed and can-
not be changed. See the section
called “LCD Resolution” later in
the chapter for the scoop.

Once all of the pixels are laid out, how do you charge
the right spots to make an image? Early LCDs didn’t use
rectangular pixels. Instead, images were composed of
different-shaped elements, each electrically separate
from the others. To create an image, each area was
charged at the same time. Figure 13.17 shows the number
zero, a display made possible by charging six areas to
make an ellipse of sorts. This process, called static charg-
ing, is still quite popular in more basic numeric displays
such as calculators.
The static method would not work in PCs due to its inherent inflexi-
bility. Instead, LCD screens use a matrix of wires (Figure 13.18). The ver-
tical wires, the Y wires, run to every sub-pixel in the column. The
horizontal wires, the X wires, run along an entire row of sub-pixels.
There must be a charge on both the X and the Y wires to make enough
voltage to light a single sub-pixel.
If you want color, you have three matrices. The three matrices inter-
sect very close together. Above the intersections, the glass is covered
with tiny red, green, and blue dots. Varying the amount of voltage on
the wires makes different levels of red, green, and blue, creating colors
(Figure 13.19).
We call this usage of LCD technology passive matrix. All LCD dis-
plays on PCs used only passive matrix for many years. Unfortunately,
passive matrix is slow and tends to create a little overlap between indi-
vidual pixels. This gives a slightly blurred effect to the image displayed.
Manufacturers eventually came up with a speedier method of display,
called dual-scan passive matrix, in which the screen refreshed two lines at a
time. Although other LCD technologies have since appeared, dual-scan con-
tinues to show up on some lower-end LCD panels.
Thin Film Transistor
A vast improvement over dual scan is called thin film transistor (TFT) or ac-
tive matrix (Figure 13.20). Instead of using X and Y wires, one or more tiny
transistors control each color dot, providing faster picture display, crisp def-
inition, and much tighter color control. TFT is the LCD of choice today, even
though it is much more expensive than passive matrix.

LCD Components
The typical LCD projector is composed of three main components: the LCD
panel, the backlight(s), and the inverters. The LCD panel creates the image,
the backlights illuminate the image so you can see it, and the inverters send
power to the backlights. Figure 13.21 shows a typical layout for the internal
components of an LCD monitor.
One of the great challenges to LCD power stems
from the fact that the backlights need AC power while
the electronics need DC power. The figure shows one of
the many ways that LCD monitor makers handle this is-
sue. The AC power from your wall socket goes into an
AC/DC transformer that changes the power to DC. The
LCD panel uses this DC power.
Note in Figure 13.21 that this monitor has two
backlights: one at the top and one at the bottom. Most
LCDs have two backlights, although many only have
one. All LCD backlights use cold cathode fluorescent
lamp (CCFL) technology, popular for its low power use,
even brightness, and long life. Figure 13.22 shows a
CCFL from an LCD panel.
CCFLs need AC power to operate, but given that the
transformer converts the incoming AC power to DC,
each CCFL backlight needs a device called an inverter to
convert the DC power back into AC. Figure 13.23 shows
a typical inverter used in an LCD.
Looking once again at Figure 13.21, note the DVI and VGA
inputs. DVI is a digital signal, so it connects directly to the LCD’s
422

You’ll also find passive matrix
displays in smaller, handheld
devices. See Chapter 14,

puting devices.

logic circuitry. The VGA goes to an
analog to digital converter before
reaching the LCD logic board.
Keep in mind that Figure 13.21
is a generic illustration. The actual
location and interconnections of
the components are as variable as
the number of LCD panels avail-
able today!
LCD Resolution
All LCD monitors have a native
resolution, such as 1680 × 1050,
that enables them to display the
sharpest picture possible. As men-
tioned earlier, the pixels are fixed.
You simply cannot run an LCD
monitor at a resolution higher than
the native one. Worse, because
LCDs have no equivalent to a
shadow mask, they can’t run at a
lower than native resolution without severely degrading image quality. A
CRT can simply use more dots and the filtering and smoothing of the shadow
mask to make a picture at a lower resolution look as good and crisp as the
same picture at a higher resolution, but an LCD cannot. The LCD has to use an
edge-blurring technique called anti-aliasing to soften the jagged corners of the
pixels when running at lower than native resolution, which simply does not
look as good. The bottom line? Always set the LCD at native resolution!
Brightness
The strength of an LCD monitor’s backlights determines the brightness
of the monitor. The brightness is measured in nits. LCD panels vary from
100 nits on the low end to over 1000 nits or more on the high end. Average
LCD panels are around 300 nits, which most monitor authorities consider
excellent brightness.
Response Rate
An LCD panel’s response rate is the amount of time it takes for all of the sub-
pixels on the panel to go from pure black to pure white and back again. This
is roughly the same concept as the CRT refresh rate, but with one important
difference. Once the electron gun on a CRT lights a phosphor, that phosphor
begins to fade until it is lit again. Individual LCD sub-pixels hold their inten-
sity until the LCD circuitry changes that sub-pixel, making the problem of
flicker nonexistent on LCDs.
Manufacturers measure LCD response rates in milliseconds, with lower
being better. A typical lower-end or older LCD has a response rate of 20–25 ms.
The screens look fine, but you’ll get some ghosting if you try to watch a
movie or play a fast-paced video game. In recent years, manufacturers have
figured out how to overcome this issue, and you can find many LCD moni-
tors with a response rate of 6–8 ms.

Test the Viewing Angle of LCDs
Take a trip to your local computer store to look at LCD displays. Don’t
be distracted looking at all of the latest graphics cards, sound cards,
CPUs, motherboards, and RAM—well, actually, it’s okay to look at
those things. Just don’t forget to look at LCDs!
Stand about two feet in front of an LCD display. Look directly at the
image on the screen and consider the image quality, screen brightness,
and color. Take a small step to your right. Compare the image you see
now to the image you saw previously. Continue taking small steps to
the right until you are no longer able to discern the image on the display.
You’ve reached the edge of the viewing angle for that LCD.
Do this test with a few different monitors. Do smaller LCDs, such as
15-inch displays, have smaller viewing angles? Do larger displays have
better viewing angles? You might also want to test the vertical viewing
angles of some monitors. Try to find an LCD that is on your eye level;
then look at it from above and below—does it have a large viewing
range vertically?
Two LCD panels that have the
same physical size may have dif-
ferent native resolutions.
One nit equals one candela/m
2.
One candela is roughly equal to
the amount of light created by a
candle.

Refresh Rate
The refresh rate for an LCD monitor uses numbers similar to that for a CRT
monitor, such as 60 Hz, but the terms mean slightly different things between
the two technologies. With CRTs, as you’ll recall, the phosphors on the
screen start to lose their glow and need to be hit again by the electron guns
many times per second to achieve an unwavering or flicker-free image. Each
dot on an active matrix LCD, in contrast, has its own transistor to light it up.
There’s no need to freshen up the dot; it’s on or off. Regardless of the refresh
rate for the LCD, therefore, there’s never any flicker at all.
The refresh rate for an LCD monitor refers to how often a screen can
change or update completely. Think of the refresh rate as a metronome or
timer and you’ll be closer to how it works in an LCD. For most computing is-
sues, 60 Hz is fine and that’s been the standard for the industry. Humans see
things that change as infrequently as 24 times per second—the standard for
motion pictures at the cinema, for example, and the best high-definition
(HD) signal—as a full motion video. To be able to change almost three times
faster is perfectly acceptable, even in higher-end applications such as fast-
moving games.
Monitor manufacturers have released 120-Hz LCD monitors in a re-
sponse to the convergence of LCDs, televisions, and computers to enable
you to see HD movies or standard-definition (SD) content without any
problems or visual artifacts on an LCD monitor. The easiest number that
provides a whole-number division for both 24 frames per second and 30 frames
per second was 120 Hz. The latter is the standard for SD content.
Contrast Ratio
A big drawback of LCD monitors is that they don’t have nearly the color sat-
uration or richness of contrast of a good CRT monitoralthough LCD tech-
nology continues to improve every year. A good contrast ratio—the
difference between the darkest and lightest spots that the monitor can dis-
play—is 450:1, although a quick trip to a computer store will reveal LCDs
with lower levels (250:1) and higher levels (1000:1).
LCD monitor manufacturers market a dynamic contrast ratio number for
their monitors, which measures the difference between a full-on, all-white
screen and a full-off, all-black screen. This yields a much higher number
than the standard contrast ratio. My Samsung panels have a 1000:1 contrast
ratio, for example, but a 20,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. Sounds awesome,
right? In general, the dynamic contrast ratio doesn’t affect viewing on com-
puter monitors. Focus on the standard contrast ratio when making decisions
on LCD screens.
Projectors
Projectors are a third option for displaying your computer images and the
best choice when displaying to an audience or in a classroom. There are two
ways to project an image on a screen: rear-view and front-view. As the name
would suggest, a rear-view projector (Figure 13.24) shoots an image onto a
screen from the rear. Rear-view projectors are always self-enclosed and are
very popular for televisions, but are virtually unheard of in the PC world.

Tech Tip
Dealing with High-
Resolution LCDs
The hard-wired nature of LCD
resolution creates a problem for
techs and consumers when deal-
ing with bigger, better-quality
monitors. A typical 15-inch LCD
has a 1024 × 768 resolution, but
a 17-inch LCD usually has 1280
× 1024 or higher. These high res-
olutions make the menus and
fonts on a monitor super tiny, a
problem for people with less-than-
stellar vision. Many folks throw
in the towel and run these high-
end LCDs at lower resolution and
just live with the lower-quality
picture, but that’s not the best
way to resolve this problem.
With Windows XP (and to a
lesser extent with the earlier ver-
sions of Windows), Microsoft al-
lows incredible customizing of
the interface. You can change the
font size, shape, and color. You
can resize the icons, toolbars, and
more. You can even change the
number of dots per inch (DPI) for
the full screen, making every-
thing bigger or smaller!
For basic customizing, start
at the Control Panel | Display
applet | Appearance tab or Con-
trol Panel | Personalization ap-
plet. To change the DPI for the
display, go to the Settings tab and
click the Advanced button in
Windows XP; in Windows Vista,
just click the Adjust font size
(DPI) option in the Tasks list.
Your clients will thank you!
A video card needs to be able
to support dual-link DVI to run a
120-Hz monitor or television.
See the discussion on DVI later
in this chapter for details.

A front-view projector shoots the image out the
front and counts on you to put a screen in front at
the proper distance. Front-view projectors con-
nected to PCs running Microsoft PowerPoint have
been the cornerstone of every meeting almost ev-
erywhere for at least the past ten years (Figure
13.25). This section deals exclusively with front-
view projectors that connect to PCs.
Projector Technologies
Projectors that connect to PCs have been in exis-
tence for almost as long as PCs themselves. Given
all that time, a number of technologies have
been used in projectors. The first generation of
projectors used CRTs. Each color used a separate
CRT that projected the image onto a screen
(Figure 13.26). CRT projectors create beautiful
images but are expensive, large, and very heavy,
and have for the most part been abandoned for
more recent technologies.
Given that light shines through an LCD panel,
LCD projectors are a natural fit for front projec-
tion. LCD projectors are light and very inexpen-
sive compared to CRTs but lack the image
quality. LCD projectors are so light that almost all
portable projectors use LCD (Figure 13.27).
All projectors share the same issues as their
equivalent technology monitors. LCD projectors
have a specific native resolution, for example. In
addition, you need to understand three concepts
specific to projectors: lumens, throw, and lamps.

Another type of technology
that’s seen in projectors but is
outside the scope of the CompTIA
A+ Essentials exam is called digi-
tal light processing (DLP).

Lumens
The brightness of a projector is measured in lumens. A lumen is the amount of
light given off by a light source from a certain angle that is perceived by the hu-
man eye. The greater the lumen rating of a projector, the brighter the projector
will be. The best lumen rating depends on the size of the room and the amount
of light in the room. There’s no single answer for “the right lumen rating” for a
projector, but use this as a rough guide. If you use a projector in a small, dark-
ened room, 1000 to 1500 lumens will work well. If you use a projector in a
midsized room with typical lighting, you’ll need at least 2000 lumens. Projec-
tors for large rooms have ratings over 10,000 lumens and are very expensive.
Throw
A projector’s throw is the size of the image at a certain distance from the
screen. All projectors have a recommended minimum and maximum throw
distance that you need to take into consideration. A typical throw would be
expressed as follows. A projector with a 16:9 image-aspect ratio needs to be
11 to 12 feet away from the projection surface to create a 100-inch diagonal
screen. A long throw lens has about a 1:2 ratio of screen size to distance, so to
display a 4-foot screen, you’d have to put the projector 8 feet away. Some
short throw lenses drop that ratio down as low as 1:1!
Lamps
The bane of every projector is the lamp. Lamps work hard in your projector,
as they must generate a tremendous amount of light. As a result, they gener-
ate quite a bit of heat, and all projectors come with a fan to keep the lamp
from overheating. When you turn off a projector, the fan continues to run
until the lamp is fully cooled. Lamps are also expensive, usually in the range
of a few hundred dollars (U.S.), which comes as a nasty shock to someone
who’s not prepared for that price when the lamp dies!
Common Features
CRT or LCD, all monitors share a number of characteristics that you need to
know for purchase, installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting.
Size
You need to take care when buying CRT monitors. CRT
monitors come in a large number of sizes, all measured
in inches (although most metric countries provide the
metric equivalent value). All monitors provide two num-
bers: the monitor size and the actual size of the screen.
The monitor size measures from two opposite diagonal
corners. The actual screen is measured from one edge of
the screen to the opposite diagonal side. This latter mea-
surement is often referred to as the viewable image size
(VIS), as shown in Figure 13.28. You will commonly see a
size difference of one to two inches between the two
measurements. A 17-inch CRT monitor, for example,
might have a 15.5-inch VIS.
426
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 13.28

Viewable image size

LCD monitors dispense with the two values and simply express the
VIS value. You must consider this issue when comparing LCDs to
CRTs. A 15-inch LCD monitor will have about the same viewing area
as a 17-inch CRT.
Connections
CRT monitors for PCs all use the famous 15-pin, three-row, DB-type
connector (Figure 13.29) and a power plug. The DB connector is also
called a D-shell or D-subminiature connector. Larger or multipurpose
monitors may have a few other connectors, but as far as the CRT is con-
cerned, these are the only two you need for video.
Unlike the analog CRTs, LCD monitors need a digital signal. This cre-
ates somewhat of an issue. The video information stored on a video card’s
RAM is clearly digital. All VGA and better video cards include a special
chip (or function embedded into a chip that does several other jobs) called
the random access memory digital-to-analog converter (RAMDAC). As the
name implies, RAMDAC takes the digital signal from the video card and
turns it into an analog signal for the analog CRT (Figure 13.30). The
RAMDAC can also convert digital to analog.
Well, RAMDACs certainly make sense for analog CRT monitors. How-
ever, if you want to plug your LCD monitor into a regular video card, you
need a RAMDAC on the LCD monitor to convert the signal from analog to
digital (Figure 13.31).
Many LCD monitors use exactly this process. These are called analog
LCD monitors. The monitor really isn’t analog; it’s digital, but it takes a stan-
dard VGA input. These monitors have one advantage: you may use any

standard VGA video card. But these monitors require adjustment of the an-
alog timing signal to the digital clock inside the monitor. This used to be a
fairly painful process, but most analog LCD monitors now include intelli-
gent circuitry to make this process either automatic or very easy.
Why convert the signal from digital to analog and then back to digital?
Well, many monitor and video card people agree that it just doesn’t make
much sense. We now see quite a few digital LCD monitors and digital video
cards. They use a completely different connector than the old 15-pin DB con-
nector used on analog video cards and monitors. After a few false starts with
connection standards, under names such as P&D and DFP, the digital LCD
world, with a few holdouts, moved to the digital visual interface (DVI) stan-
dard. DVI is actually three different connectors that look very much alike:
DVI-D is for digital, DVI-A is for analog (for backward compatibility if the
monitor maker so desires), and the DVI-A/D or DVI-I (interchangeable) ac-
cepts either a DVI-D or DVI-A. DVI-D and DVI-A are keyed so that they will
not connect.
DVI-D and DVI-I connectors come in two varieties, single-link and dual-
link. Single-link DVI has a maximum bandwidth of 165 MHz, which, trans-
lated into practical terms, limits the maximum resolution of a monitor to
1920 × 1080 at 60 Hz or 1280 × 1024 at 85 Hz. Dual-link DVI uses more pins to
double throughput and thus grant higher resolutions (Figure 13.32). With
dual-link, you can have displays up to a whopping 2048 × 1536 at 60 Hz!
Digital connectors are quickly replacing analog in the monitor world.
Digital makes both the monitor and the video card cheaper, provides a
clearer signal because no conversion is necessary, and makes installation
easy. Many monitors and video cards these days only support digital signals,

You can plug a single-link DVI
monitor into a dual-link DVI con-
nector and it’ll work just fine.

but there are still quite a few of each that provide both digital and analog
connections.
The video card people have it easy. They either include both a VGA and
a DVI-D connector or use a DVI-I connector. The advantage to DVI-I is that
you can add a cheap DVI-I–to-VGA adapter (one usually comes with the
video card) like the one shown in Figure 13.33 and connect an analog moni-
tor just fine.
Monitor makers have it tougher. Most LCD monitor makers have made
the jump to DVI, but many include a VGA connector for those machines that
still need it.
Unless you’re buying a complete new system, you’ll rarely buy a video
card at the same time you buy a monitor. When you’re buying a monitor or a
video card, make sure that the new device will connect to the other!
Adjustments
Most adjustments to the monitor take place at installation, but for now, let’s
just make sure you know what they are and where they are located. Clearly,
all monitors have an On/Off button or switch. Also, see if you can locate the
Brightness and Contrast buttons. Beyond that, most monitors (at least the
only ones you should buy) have an onboard menu system, enabling a num-
ber of adjustments. Every monitor maker provides a different way to access
these menus, but they all provide two main functions:
physical screen adjustment (bigger, smaller, move to the
left, right, up, down, and others) and color adjustment.
The color adjustment lets you adjust the red, green, and
blue guns to give you the best color tones. All of these set-
tings are a matter of personal taste. Make sure the person
who will use the computer understands how to adjust
these settings (Figure 13.34).
Power Conservation
CRT and LCD monitors differ greatly in the amount of
electricity they require. The bottom line is that CRTs use
a lot and LCDs use a lot less. Here’s the scoop.
Approximately half the power required to run a
desktop PC is consumed by the CRT monitor. Monitors
that meet the Video Electronics Standards Association
(VESA) specification for display power management signaling (DPMS) can re-
duce monitor power consumption by roughly 75 percent. This is accom-
plished by reducing or eliminating the signals sent by the video card to the
monitor during idle periods. By eliminating these pulses, the monitor essen-
tially takes catnaps. The advantage over simply shutting the monitor off is
in the time it takes to restore the display.
A typical CRT monitor consumes approximately 120 W. During a catnap
or power-down mode, the energy consumption is reduced to below 25 W,
while enabling the screen to return to use in less than 10 seconds. Full shut-
off is accomplished by eliminating all clocking pulses to the monitor. Al-
though this reduces power consumption to below 15 W, it also requires
anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds to restore a usable display.

Video cards with two video
connectors support dual monitors.

Typical menu controls

A typical LCD monitor, in contrast, uses less than half the electricity that
a CRT uses. A 19-inch, 4:3 aspect-ratio flat panel, for example, uses around
33 W at peak usage and less than 2 W in DPMS mode. Larger LCDs use more
power at peak usage than smaller ones. A 21-inch wide-screen model, for
example, might draw ~75 W at peak but drop down to less than 2 W in
DPMS mode. Swapping out CRTs with LCDs is a great way to save on your
electric bill!
■Video Cards
The video card, or display adapter, handles the video chores within the PC,
processing information from the CPU and sending it out to the monitor. The
video card is composed of two major pieces: the video RAM and the video
processor circuitry. The video RAM stores the video image. On the first
video cards, this RAM was good old dynamic RAM (DRAM), just like the
RAM on the motherboard. Today’s video cards often have better RAM than
your system has! The video processing circuitry takes the information on
the video RAM and shoots it out to the monitor. Although early video pro-
cessing circuitry was little more than an intermediary between the CPU and
the video RAM, modern video processors are more powerful than all but the
latest CPUs! It’s not at all uncommon to see video cards that need fans to
cool their onboard processors (Figure 13.35).
This section looks at five aspects that define a video card: display modes,
motherboard connection, graphics processor circuitry, video memory, and
connections.
Modes
The trick to understanding video cards is to appreciate the beginnings and
evolution of video. Video output to computers was around long before PCs
were created. At the time PCs became popular, video was almost exclu-
sively text-based, meaning that the only image the video card could place on
the monitor was one of the 256 ASCII characters. These charac-
ters were made up of patterns of pixels that were stored in the
system BIOS. When a program wanted to make a character, it
talked to DOS or to the BIOS, which stored the image of that
character in the video memory. The character then appeared
on the screen.
The beauty of text video cards was that they were simple to
use and cheap to make. The simplicity was based on the fact
that only 256 characters existed, and no color choices were
available—just monochrome text.
You could, however, choose to make the character bright,
dim, normal, underlined, or blinking. Positioning the charac-
ters was easy, as space on the screen allowed for only 80 char-
acters per row and 24 rows of characters.
Long ago, RAM was very expensive, so video card makers
were interested in using the absolute least amount of RAM
possible. Making a monochrome text video card was a great
430

Tech Tip
Power Switch versus
DPMS
Turning off the monitor with the
power switch is the most basic
form of power management. The
downside to this is the wear and
tear on the CRT. The CRT is the
most expensive component of a
monitor, and frequently turning
it on and off can damage the
CRT. When using a non-DPMS
monitor or video card, it is best to
turn the monitor on once during
the day and then turn it off only
when you are finished for the day.
This on-off cycle must be bal-
anced against the life of the CRT
display phosphors. The typical
monitor loses about half its origi-
nal brightness after roughly
10,000 to 15,000 hours of display
time. Leaving the monitor on all
of the time brings a noticeable
decrease in brightness in just over
a year (8766 hours). The only
way around this is to enable the
DPMS features of the monitor or
take care to turn the monitor off.
• Figure 13.35

way to keep down RAM costs. Let’s consider this for a minute. First, the
video RAM is where the contents of the screen are located. You need enough
video RAM to hold all of the necessary information for a completely full
screen. Each ASCII character needs 8 bits (by definition), so a monitor with
80 characters/row and 24 rows will need
80 characters × 24 rows = 1920 characters = 15,360 bits or 1920 bytes
The video card would need less than 2000 bytes of memory, which isn’t
much, not even in 1981 when the PC first came out. Now, be warned that I’m
glossing over a few things—where you store the information about under-
lines, blinking, and so on. The bottom line is that the tiny amount of neces-
sary RAM kept monochrome text video cards cheap.
Very early on in the life of PCs, a new type of video card, called a graphics
video card, was invented. It was quite similar to a text card. The text card,
however, was limited to the 256 ASCII characters, whereas a graphics video
card enabled programs to turn any pixel on the screen on or off. It was still
monochrome, but programs could access any individual pixel, enabling
much more creative control of the screen. Of course, it took more video
RAM. The first graphics cards ran at 320 × 200 pixels. One bit was needed for
each pixel (on or off), so
320 × 200 = 64,000 bits or 8000 bytes
That’s a lot more RAM than was needed for text, but it was still a pretty low
amount of RAM—even in the old days. As resolutions increased, however,
the amount of video RAM needed to store this information also increased.
After monochrome video was invented, moving into color for both text
and graphics video cards was a relatively easy step. The only question was
how to store color information for each character (text cards) or pixel (graph-
ics cards). This was easy—just set aside a few more bits for each pixel or char-
acter. So now the question becomes, “How many bits do you set aside?” Well,
that depends on how many colors you want. Basically, the number of colors
determines the number of bits. For example, if you want four colors, you need
2 bits (2 bits per pixel). Then, you could do something like this:
00 = black
01 = cyan (blue)
10 = magenta (reddish pink)
11 = white
So if you set aside 2 bits, you could get 4 colors. If you want 16 colors, set
aside 4 bits, which would make 16 different combinations. Nobody ever in-
vented a text mode that used more than 16 colors, so let’s start thinking in
terms of only graphics mode and bits per pixel. To get 256 colors, each pixel
would have to be represented with 8 bits. In PCs, the number of colors—
called the color depth—is always a power of 2: 4, 16, 256, 64 K, and so on.
Note that as more colors are added, more video RAM is needed to store the
information. Here are the most common color depths and the number of bits
necessary to store the color information per pixel:
2 colors = 1 bit (mono)
4 colors = 2 bits
16 colors = 4 bits
256 colors = 8 bits
Chapter 13: Learning Video and Multimedia
431

64 K colors = 16 bits
16.7 million colors = 24 bits
Most technicians won’t say, for example, “I set my video card
to show over 16 million colors.” Instead, they’ll say, “I set my
color depth to 24 bits.” Talk in terms of bits, not colors. It is as-
sumed that you know the number of colors for any color depth.
You can set the color depth for a Windows 2000 or Windows
XP computer in the Display Properties applet on the Settings tab
(Figure 13.36). If you set up a typical Windows XP computer,
you’ll notice that Windows offers you 32-bit color quality, which
might make you assume you’re about to crank out more than
4 billion colors, but that’s simply not the case. The 32-bit color
setting offers 24-bit color plus an 8-bit alpha channel. An alpha
channel controls the opacity of a particular color. By using an alpha
channel, Windows can more effectively blend colors to create the
effect of semi-transparent images. In Windows XP, you see this
in the drop shadow under a menu; in Windows Vista, almost every
screen element can be semi-transparent (Figure 13.37).
Your video card and monitor are capable of showing Win-
dows in a fixed number of different resolutions and color depths.
The choices depend on the resolutions and color depths the
video card can push to the monitor and the amount of band-
width your monitor can support. Any single combination of res-
olution and color depth you set for your system is called a mode.
For standardization, VESA defines a certain number of resolu-
tions, all derived from the granddaddy of video modes: VGA.

VGA
With the introduction of the PS/2, IBM introduced the video graphics array
(VGA) standard. This standard offered 16 colors at a resolution of 640 × 480
pixels. VGA supported such an amazing variety of colors by using an ana-
log video signal instead of a digital one, as was the case prior to the VGA
standard. A digital signal is either all on or all off. By using an analog signal,
the VGA standard can provide 64 distinct levels for the three colors (RGB)—
that is, 643 or 262,144 possible colors—although only 16 or 256 can be seen at
a time. For most purposes, 640 × 480 and 16 colors defines VGA mode. This
is typically the display resolution and color depth referred to on many soft-
ware packages as a minimum display requirement. Every video card made
in the past 15 years can output as VGA, but VGA-only cards are now
obsolete.
Beyond VGA
The 1980s were a strange time for video. Until the very late 1980s, VGA was
the highest mode defined by VESA, but demand grew for modes that went
beyond VGA. This motivated VESA to introduce (over time) a number of
new modes with names such as SVGA, XGA, and many others. Even today,
new modes are being released! Table 13.1 shows the more common modes.
The video card must have sufficient RAM to support each combination
of color depth and resolution. Many years ago this mattered, when video
cards had scant megabytes of memory. A video card with only 2 MB of
RAM, for example, could handle a high color (16-bit) display at 1024 × 768,
but not the same resolution with true color (24-bit). Table 13.2 shows com-
mon modes and the minimum video memory needed. All modern video
cards can handle true color at any resolution.
Motherboard Connection
Using more color depth slows down video functions. Data moving from the
video card to the display has to go through the video card’s memory chips and
the expansion bus, and this can happen only so quickly. The standard PCI slots
used in almost all systems are limited to 32-bit transfers at roughly 33 MHz,
yielding a maximum bandwidth of 132 MBps. This sounds like a lot until you
start using higher resolutions, high color depths, and higher refresh rates.

Typical Display Modes
To accommodate rotated LCD
monitors in portrait view, the
video resolution numbers might
be reversed. Rather than 1280 ×
1024, for example, you might
see 1024 × 1280. The amount of
RAM needed remains the same
regardless.

For example, take a typical display at 800 × 600 with a fairly low refresh
of 70 Hz. The 70 Hz means the display screen is being redrawn 70 times per
second. If you use a low color depth of 256 colors, which is 8 bits (28 = 256),
you can multiply all of the values together to see how much data per second
has to be sent to the display:
800 × 600 × 1 byte × 70 = 33.6 MBps
If you use the same example at 16 million (24-bit) colors, the figure
jumps to 100.8 MBps. You might say, “Well, if PCI runs at 132 MBps, it can
handle that!” That statement would be true if the PCI bus had nothing else
to do but tend to the video card, but almost every system has more than one
PCI device, each requiring part of that throughput. The PCI bus simply can-
not handle the needs of many current systems.
AGP
Intel answered the desire for video bandwidth
even higher than PCI with the Accelerated Graph-
ics Port (AGP). AGP is a single, special port, simi-
lar to a PCI slot, that is dedicated to video. You
will never see a motherboard with two AGP
slots. Figure 13.38 shows an early-generation
AGP. AGP is derived from the 66-MHz, 32-bit
PCI 2.1 specification. AGP uses a function called
strobing that increases the signals two, four, and
eight times for each clock cycle.
Simply describing AGP as a faster PCI would
seriously misrepresent the power of AGP. AGP
has several technological advantages over PCI,
including the bus, the internal operations, and
the
capability
to
handle
3-D
texturing.
First, AGP currently resides
alone, on its own personal data
bus, connected directly to the
Northbridge (Figure 13.39). This is
important
because
more
ad-
vanced versions of AGP outper-
form every bus on the system
except the frontside bus!

Second, AGP takes advantage of pipelining commands, similar to the
way CPUs pipeline. Third, AGP has a feature called sidebanding—basically
a second data bus that enables the video card to send more commands to the
Northbridge while receiving other commands at the same time.
Video cards do all kinds of neat stuff with their RAM; for example, video
cards store copies of individual windows so they can display the windows
at different points on the screen very quickly. A demanding application can
quickly max out the onboard RAM on a video card, so AGP provides a path-
way so the AGP card can “steal” chunks of the regular system memory to
store video information, especially textures. This is generically called a system
memory access and is quite popular.
AGP has gone through three sets of specifications (AGP1.0, AGP2.0, and
AGP3.0), but the official names tend to be ignored. Most techs and consum-
ers refer to the various cards by their strobe multiplier, such as AGP 1×, 2×,
4×, and 8×. The only problem with blurring the distinctions between the
specifications comes from the fact that many new motherboards simply
don’t support the older AGP cards because the older cards require a differ-
ent physical connection than the new ones.
Some motherboards support multiple types of AGP. Figure 13.40 shows
an AGP slot that accommodates everything up to 8×, even the very rare
AGP Pro cards. Note that the tab on the slot covers the extra pins required
for AGP Pro.
Because many AGP cards will run on older AGP motherboards, you can
get away with mixing AGP specifications. To get the best, most stable per-
formance possible, you should use an AGP card that’s fully supported by
the motherboard.

Intel couldn’t quite bring itself
to call AGP’s system memory

access, so they use a couple of dif-
ferent terms. The video processor
maps out a portion of system
memory by using the Graphics
Address Remapping Table
(GART). The size of the re-
mapped region is called the AGP
aperture. A typical AGP aperture
is 32 MB or 64 MB.
• Figure 13.40
AGP 8× slot

The only significant downside to AGP lies in the close connection toler-
ances required by the cards themselves. It’s very common to snap in a new
AGP card and power up just to get a no-video-card beep or a system that
doesn’t boot. Always take the time to ensure that an AGP card is snapped
down securely and screwed in before starting the system.
PCIe
AGP is a great way to get video information to and from video cards very
quickly, but it has the downside of being a unique connector in a world
where saving money is important. AGP, being based on PCI, also uses a par-
allel interface. When the PCI Express (PCIe) interface was developed to re-
place PCI, the PCIe designers worked hard to make sure it would also
replace AGP. PCIe is a natural evolution for video because it is incredibly
fast, using a serial communication method. Also, because PCIe is a true ex-
pansion bus designed to talk to the CPU and RAM, it also supports all of the
little extras found in AGP, such as sidebanding and system memory access.
All PCIe video cards use the PCIe ×16 connector (Figure 13.41). PCIe re-
placed AGP as the primary video interface almost overnight.
Graphics Processor
The graphics processor handles the heavy lifting of taking commands from
the CPU and translating them into coordinates and color information that
the monitor understands and displays.
Video card discussion, at least among techs, almost always revolves
around the graphics processor they use and the amount of RAM onboard. A
typical video card might be called an ATI Radeon X1950 XTX 512 MB, so
let’s break that down. ATI is the manufacturer, Radeon X1950 XTX is the
model of the card as well as the graphics processor, and 512 MB is the
amount of video RAM.

Graphics processors are also
known as GPUs.

Many companies make the hundreds of different video
cards on the market, but only two companies produce the vast
majority of graphics processors found on video cards: NVIDIA
and ATI. NVIDIA and ATI make and sell graphics processors
to third-party manufacturers who then design, build, and sell
video cards under their own branding. ATI also makes and
sells its own line of cards. Figure 13.42 shows an NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 260 on a board made by EVGA.
Your choice of graphics processor is your single most im-
portant decision in buying a video card. Low-end graphics
processors usually work fine for the run-of-the-mill user who
wants to write letters or run a Web browser. High-end graph-
ics processors are designed to support the beautiful 3-D games
that are so popular today.
NVIDIA and ATI are extremely competitive, and both
companies introduce multiple models of graphics processors
(and therefore new models of cards) every year. However, unless you’re
using the Vista Aero glass desktop, all of these extra features you see in
video cards are really only for the true driving force in video cards: 3-D gaming.
Your PC is capable of providing you with hours of incredible entertainment
via a huge number of popular games that immerse you in 3-D environments
full of light, shadows, explosions, and other amazing effects that create a fun
and beautiful gaming experience.
These 3-D games have special needs to do all this amazing
stuff. One need is textures. A texture is a small picture that is
tiled over and over again on walls, floors, and other surfaces to
create the 3-D world. Take a look at the wall in Figure 13.43. It’s
made up of only three textures that are repeated over and over
on the surface.
Games also use hundreds of lighting effects such as trans-
parency (water), shadows, reflection, and bump mapping—
the process of laying multiple textures on the same spot to give
a more textured (bumpy) look to the surface. These games are
where the higher-quality graphics processors really shine.
Choosing a graphics processor is a challenge because the
video industry is constantly coming out with new models. One
of the best guides is price. The best (and newest) graphics cards
usually cost around (US) $400–500. The cheapest cards cost
around $50. I usually split the difference and go for a card
priced around $180 to $200—such a card will have most of the
features you want without breaking your bank account.
If you use your computer only for 2-D programs (most of-
fice applications such as word processors, e-mail, and Web
browsers are 2-D), most of the features of the more advanced
graphics cards will do you little good. If you’re not a gamer,
you can meet your needs with a cheap, low-end video card.
Video Memory
Video memory is crucial to the operation of a PC. It is probably the hardest-
working set of electronics on the PC. Video RAM constantly updates to reflect

Wall of textures

every change that takes place on the
screen. When you’re working with
heavy-duty applications (such as
games), video memory can prove to
be a serious bottleneck in three
ways: data throughput speed, ac-
cess speed, and simple capacity.
Manufacturers have overcome
these bottlenecks by upping the
width of the bus between the video
RAM and video processor; using
specialized, super-fast RAM; and
adding more and more total RAM.
First,
manufacturers
reorga-
nized the video display memory
on cards from the typical 32-bit-wide structure to 64,
128, or even 256 bits wide. Because the system bus is
limited to 32 or 64 bits, this would not be of much ben-
efit if video display cards weren’t really coprocessor
boards. Most of the graphics rendering and process-
ing is handled on the card by the video processor chip
rather than by the CPU. The main system simply pro-
vides the input data to the processor on the video
card. Because the memory bus on the video card is as
much as eight times wider than the standard 32-bit
pathway (256 bits), data can be manipulated and then
sent to the monitor much more quickly (Figure 13.44).
Specialized types of video RAM have been devel-
oped for graphics cards, and many offer substantial
improvements in video speeds. The single most im-
portant feature that separates DRAM from video RAM is that video RAM
can read and write data at the same time. Table 13.3 shows a list of common

know these for the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam!
Finally, many advanced 3-D video cards come with huge amounts of
video RAM. It’s very common to see cards with 64, 128, 256, or 512 MB or
even 1 GB of RAM! Why so much? Even with PCI Express, accessing data in
system RAM always takes a lot longer than accessing data stored in local
RAM on the video card. The huge amount of video RAM enables game de-
velopers to optimize their games and store more essential data on the local
video RAM.
Connections
Modern video cards offer connections to one or more PC
monitors. Many also sport connectors for non-monitors,
such as televisions. The video card in Figure 13.45 has
three connectors: VGA, S-Video, and DVI-I. Other con-
nectors enable the video card to connect to composite,
component, and even high-definition devices.
For Standard Monitors
You know about the standard monitor connectors, VGA
and DVI, from the monitor discussion earlier. About the
only thing to add is that most DVI connections on video
cards these days natively support analog signals. You can use a simple DVI-
to-VGA adapter, for example, for connecting a VGA cable to a video card.
Apple Macintosh desktop models use a DisplayPort connection rather
than VGA or DVI for connecting to a monitor. Dell offers support for
DisplayPort as well at the time of this writing. Figure 13.46 shows a
DisplayPort jack on a Dell portable.
For Multimedia Devices
Video cards can have one or more standard connections plus non-standard
connections for hooking the PC to a multimedia device, such as a television,
DVD player, or video camera. The earliest type of connector commonly
found is the S-Video connector. This provides decent-quality video output
or, in some cases, input. More commonly now you see both a proprietary
round connector that supports S-Video and a proprietary dongle that adds
support for video through either component connection or composite con-
nections. Figure 13.47 shows the similar round ports.

A composite connector provides a video signal through a
single cable, whereas a component adapter provides a split
signal, red, green, and blue. Figure 13.48 shows the two con-
nector dongles.
The best connections for outputting to television are the
Hi-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) connectors. Al-
though a few devices offer HDMI output directly (such as the
portable pictured in Figure 13.49), most video cards support
HDMI through a special cable that connects to a dual-link DVI
port. Figure 13.50 shows an example of such a cable.
■Sound
Whether you’re racing down the virtual track, pixels flying across the
screen, hearing the engine roar as you take another turn and press down the
accelerator, or you’re surfing the Web for lovely scenic nature photos with
the sweet, mellifluous music of Mozart filling the room; sound has become
an integral component of the computing experience. Setting up and opti-
mizing sound for the PC has become an integral skill for all computer techs.
Correctly setting up sound for a PC requires that you know about quite a
few things, because the sound process has many components. For the
CompTIA A+ Essentials exam, you really only need a general idea of how
sound works inside a PC and a basic idea of what a sound card looks like, so
here’s a nice, big overview of PC sound.
How Sound Works in a PC
Like the ripples that roll across a pond when you drop a rock in the center,
sound flows from a source in invisible but measurable waves that cause the
membranes in your ears to vibrate and create noise. The sophistication of
the human ear enables most people to differentiate the melodious from the
raucous, the loud from the soft. Computers aren’t nearly as sophisticated as
the human ear and brain, so clear standards are a must for converting music
into a format that a PC can use to record and play sound. Computer folks
use the terms capture and output instead of record and play.

Some video cards with built-
in television tuners that enable
the PC to be a television as well
as a computer have a standard
coaxial jack for connecting a ca-
ble or antenna. You’ll learn more
about TV tuners later in the
chapter.

Sound-Capture Basics
Virtually every PC today comes with four critical components for capturing
and outputting sound: a sound card, speakers, microphone, and recording/
playback software. Computers capture (record) sound waves in electronic
format through a process called sampling. In its simplest sense, sampling
means capturing the state or quality of a particular sound wave a set num-
ber of times each second. The sampling rate is measured in units of thou-
sands of cycles per second, or kilohertz (KHz). The more often a sound is
sampled, the better the reproduction of that sound. Most sounds in the PC
world are recorded with a sampling rate of from 11 KHz (very low quality,
like a telephone) to 192 KHz (ultra-high quality, better than the human ear).
Sounds vary according to their loudness (amplitude), how high or low
their tone (frequency), and the qualities that differentiate the same note
played on different instruments (timbre). All the characteristics of a particu-
lar sound wave—amplitude, frequency, timbre—need to be recorded and
translated into ones and zeros to reproduce that sound accurately within the
computer and out to your speakers.
The number of characteristics of a particular sound captured during
sampling is measured by the bit depth of the sample, the number of bits used
to describe the characteristics of a sound. The greater the bit depth used to
capture a sample, the more characteristics of that sound can be stored and
thus re-created. An 8-bit sample of a Jimi Hendrix guitar solo, for example,
captures 28 (256) characteristics of that sound per sample. It would sound
like a cheap recording of a recording, perhaps a little flat and thin. A 16-bit
sample, in contrast, captures 216 (65,536) different characteristics of his solo
and reproduces all the fuzzy overtones and feedback that gave Hendrix his
unique sound.
The last aspect of sound capture is the number of tracks of sound you
capture. Most commonly, you can capture either a single track (monaural) or
two tracks (stereo). More advanced captures record many more sound
tracks, but that’s a topic for a more advanced sound capture discussion.
The combination of sampling frequency and bit depth determines how
faithfully a digital version of a sound captures what your ear would hear.
A sound capture is considered CD quality when recorded at 44.1 KHz, with
16-bit depth and in stereo. Most recording programs let you set these values
before you begin recording. Figure 13.51 shows the configuration settings
for the Windows Sound Recorder.
Hey, wait a minute! Did you notice the Format setting in Figure 13.51?
What’s that? You can save those sampled sounds in lots of different
ways—and that’s where the term format comes into play.
Recorded Sound Formats
The granddaddy of all sound formats is pulse code modulation (PCM). PCM
was developed in the 1960s to carry telephone calls over the first digital lines.
With just a few minor changes to allow for use in PCs, the PCM format is still
alive and well, although it’s better known as the WAV format so common in
the PC world. WAV files are great for storing faithfully recorded sounds and
music, but they do so at a price. WAV files can be huge, especially when sam-
pled at high frequency and depth. A four-minute song at 44.1 KHz and 16-bit
stereo, for example, weighs in at a whopping 40-plus MB!

Tech Tip
Sound Terminology
Every modern motherboard comes
with sound processing capabili-
ties built in. By default, techs talk
about built-in sound as either
built-in sound or as a sound card,
even when there’s no expansion
card for sound.
• Figure 13.51
Sound Recorder settings

What’s interesting about sound quality is that the human ear cannot per-
ceive anywhere near the subtle variations of sound recorded at 44.1 KHz
and 16-bit stereo. Clever programmers have written algorithms to store full-
quality WAV files as compressed files, discarding unnecessary audio quali-
ties of that file. These algorithms—really nothing more than a series of in-
structions in code—are called compressor/decompressor programs or,
more simply, codecs. The most famous of the codecs is the Fraunhoffer
MPEG-1 Layer 3 codec, more often called by its file extension, MP3.
MIDI
Every sound card can produce sounds in addition to playing prerecorded
sound files. Every sound card comes with a second processor designed to
interpret standardized musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) files. It’s
important to note that a MIDI file is not an independent music file, unlike a
WAV file that sounds more or less the same on many different PCs. A MIDI
file is a text file that takes advantage of the sound processing hardware to
enable the PC to produce sound. Programmers use these small files to tell
the sound card what notes to play, how long, how loud, on which instru-
ments, and so forth. Think of a MIDI file as a piece of electronic sheet music,
with the instruments built into your sound card.
The beauty of MIDI files is that they’re tiny in comparison to equivalent
WAV files. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, for exam-
ple, weighs in at a whopping 78 MB as a high-quality WAV file. The same
seven-minute song as a MIDI file, in contrast, slips in at a svelte 60 KB.
MIDI is hardware dependent, meaning the capabilities and quality of
the individual sound card make all the difference in the world on the sound
produced. Sound cards play MIDI files by using one of two technologies:
FM synthesis or wave table synthesis.
FM Synthesis
Early processors used electronic emulation of various in-
struments—a technique often called FM synthesis—to produce music and
other sound effects. Software developers could tell the sound processor to
reproduce a piano playing certain notes, for example, and a sound resem-
bling a piano would pour forth from the speakers. The problem with FM
synthesis is that although the modulation sounds okay for a single note,
such as middle C, it sounds increasingly electronic the farther up or down
the scale you go from that prime note.
Wave Table Synthesis
To address the odd techno-sound of early sound
processors, manufacturers began embedding recordings of actual instru-
ments or other sounds in the sound card. Modern sound cards use these re-
corded sounds to reproduce an instrument much more faithfully than with
FM synthesis. When asked to play a C note on a piano or on a viola, for ex-
ample, the sound processor grabs a prerecorded WAV file from its memory
and adjusts it to match the specific sound and timing requested. This tech-
nique is called wave table synthesis. The number of instruments a sound
card can play at once is called the polyphony of that card—typically 64
sounds on better cards. Most modern sound cards have samples of 128 in-
struments—a veritable symphony orchestra on a chip!
442
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
WAV and MP3 are only two
among a large number of file
formats for sound. Not all sound
players can play all of these for-
mats; however, many sound for-
mats are nothing more than
some type of compressed WAV
file, so with the right codec
loaded, you can play most
sound formats.
Tech Tip
Compressing WAV
Files to MP3 Format
Using MP3 compression, you
can shrink a WAV file by a factor
of 12 without losing much sound
quality. When you compress a
WAV file into an MP3 file, the
key decision is the bit rate. The bit
rate is the amount of information
(number of bits) transferred from
the compressed file to the MP3
decoder in 1 second. The higher
the bit rate of an MP3 file, the
higher the sound quality. The bit
rate of MP3 audio files is com-
monly measured in thousands of
bits per second, abbreviated Kbps.
Most MP3 encoders support a
range of bit rates from 24 Kbps
up to 320 Kbps (or 320,000 bits
per second). A CD-quality MP3
bit rate is 128 Kbps.
MIDI files have the file exten-
sion .MID in the PC world.
MIDI files are much less pop-
ular than other recorded formats
on computers, but every Win-
dows computer and every sound
card still fully supports MIDI.

Other File Formats
The WAV, MP3, and MIDI formats may account for the majority of sound
files, but plenty of other less common formats are out there. Here are the ex-
tensions of some other sound file formats you may run into in the PC world:
■
AAC
Advanced Audio Coding is the native format for songs
downloaded into the Apple iTunes music library. The AAC format is
part of the MPEG-4 standard, offers better compression algorithms
than MP3, and is freely distributed. Apple used to wrap downloaded
songs in a Digital Rights Management (DRM) encapsulation called
FairPlay that gave them control over distribution of those songs.
■
AIFF
Audio Interchange File Format files are a popular sound format
used on Macintosh computers. These files are often seen on Web sites,
and you can use the well-known QuickTime Player to play them.
■
ASM
Assembly Language Source files are compressed sound files
often seen on the Internet and used in streaming sound (streaming
media is discussed later in this chapter).
■
ASX
Microsoft created the ASX format to facilitate streaming audio
over the Internet through Windows Media Player. It’s more than just a
format, though; it acts like a super playlist and enables you to play
other sound file types as well. The full name of the format is Microsoft
Advanced Streaming Redirector.
■
AU
This popular format is often seen in the Windows world.
Many players can play these files, including players on non-Windows
systems, such as Sun, Next, UNIX, and Macintosh.
■
OGG
The Vorbis format is an open-source compression codec that
competes well with the proprietary AAC and WMA codecs, as well
as MP3. Vorbis files are saved with the .OGG filename extension, so
you’ll hear them (incorrectly) referred to as “Ogg” files.
■
RM
RealMedia files play either just audio or audio and video.
They are proprietary to RealMedia, a popular player often used on
the Internet. You must have RealMedia Player installed on your
computer to play these files.
■
WMA
Windows Media Audio is Microsoft’s proprietary compression
format.
This list scratches the surface of the 100-plus sound file formats available,
but it represents those you’re most likely to encounter.
Playing Sounds
A large number of programs can play sounds on a typical Windows com-
puter. First, virtually every Windows computer comes with Windows Media
Player, possibly the most popular of all sound players. Figure 13.52 shows the
default Media Player for Windows Vista. You can download many other
players, of course, including iTunes, Apple’s media program for Windows
and Mac OS X. This is good, because not all sound players can play all sounds.
Many applications, especially games, play sounds too. In the not-too-dis-
tant past, a game or an application sometimes had its own sound format, but
most applications and games today use standard WAV, MP3, or MIDI files.
Chapter 13: Learning Video and Multimedia
443

Streaming media is a broadcast of data that is played on your computer
and immediately discarded. Streaming media is incredibly popular on the
Internet. Streaming media has spawned an entire industry of Internet radio
stations. The three most popular streaming media players are Windows Me-
dia Player, Winamp, and Apple’s iTunes. With the spread of broadband
Internet, the quality of streaming radio has improved dramatically. In fact, it
is common to see Internet stations streaming 128 Kbps and better MP3 files.
Some sites even have surround sound music for those who have the speak-
ers to appreciate it.
Getting the Right Sound Hardware
Modern motherboards come with built-in sound processing, plus you can
buy a sound card that plugs into a PCI or PCIe expansion slot or into a USB
port. Sound cards come with many features, including two separate sound
processors (one for all of the recorded formats such as WAV and another for
MIDI), recording capabilities, support for MIDI instruments, and more. All
sound cards, from the cheapest to the most expensive, can play music and
drive a pair of speakers, so techs need to delve a little deeper to understand
the crucial differences among low-, mid-, and high-end sound cards. Sound
cards differ in six basic areas: sound standard, processor capabilities,
speaker support, recording quality, jacks, and extra features.
But the sound card itself is only one part of the equation. You also need
good-quality speakers if you have any intention of listening to music or en-
joying some of the more advanced features such as surround sound.
Sound Card Standards
Most sound cards follow one of two standards, AC’97 or Intel High Definition
Audio, although no rule says manufacturers must follow these standards.

Tech Tip
Sound Cards
The hardware portion of sound
processing equipment in the PC
comes either as a chip built into
the motherboard or as an expan-
sion card. Techs call both forms
sound cards, though technically
the first type is not a card at all.
Still, the generic term has stuck
for the time being.

This applies both to the sound
processing hardware built into
motherboards and to add-on sound
cards.
The AC’97 standard applies to
lower-end audio devices, having
been created when most folks lis-
tened to stereo sound at best. Both
playback and recording capabili-
ties of such sound cards offer ade-
quate quality, certainly enough
for the typical office PC. When
you want to go beyond average,
though, turn to a motherboard or
add-on sound card that offers a
newer standard.
Intel designed the Intel High
Definition Audio (HDA) standard
to support features such as true
surround sound with many dis-
crete speakers. Technically speak-
ing, whereas AC’97 offers support
for up to six channels at 48 KHz/
20-bit quality, HDA cranks that up
to eight channels at 192 KHz/32-
bit quality, a substantial improve-
ment. HDA also supports sending
multiple streams of audio from
one computer to different output
devices, so you can enjoy Internet
radio in one room, for example,
and listen to a CD in another
room, both played on the same
computer.
Processor Capabilities
Sound processor capabilities differ dramatically from the low end to the
high end, even though the prices don’t reflect the great divide. The sound
processor handles the communication among the application, operating
system, and CPU and translates commands into sounds coming out of the
speakers. Low-end sound processors do little more than translate, which
means that the CPU has to do the heavy lifting on the processing front.
Better sound processors, in contrast, shoulder much of the processing
burden and bring a series of extra features to the table. By handling a lot of
the processing onboard, these better sound processors free up the CPU for
other duties and—in effect and in name—accelerate the sound process. These
decent sound processors also provide excellent sound reproduction, so your
MP3s sound as awesome on your PC as they do on your stereo.
Most mid-range and all high-end sound processors offer support for vari-
ous surround sound standards, enabling equally equipped games and other
applications to provide positional audio effects and detailed sound

Play Sounds in Windows
The typical Windows PC comes with a number of applications for playing
sound files. Take a tour of a typical Windows system to see these applica-
tions. This exercise uses Windows XP, but almost any version of Windows
(95 or later) will also work. For this exercise, you need a Windows XP or
Vista system with a functioning sound card, microphone, and speakers.

Using the file search feature in Windows, locate all of the files on
your computer that have the extension .WAV—all versions of
Windows come with a number of WAV files. Double-click one of
the files to play it. What program is associated with WAV files?

Repeat step 1, but this time look for files with the extension .MID.
Not all versions of Windows have MIDI files. Double-click one of
the files to play it. What program is associated with MIDI files?

From the Start button, search for any sound programs that may
be on your system. You’ll almost certainly run into Windows
Media Player and Sound Recorder, but check to see whether any
third-party programs are installed.

itors, such as NVIDIA. Every-

modeling—features that make PC gaming take on a whole new dimension.
You’ll learn about the various standards in detail in the “Speakers” section of
this chapter, but for now let an example suffice. With properly implemented
positional audio, when you’re sneaking down the hall, ready to steal the Pa-
sha’s treasure, you will hear behind you the sounds of the guards marching
up to capture you. Such added realism has many potential benefits beyond
games, but games are currently the primary beneficiary of this technology.
Speaker Support
Every sound card supports two speakers or a pair of headphones, but
many better sound cards support five or more speakers in discrete
channels. These multiple speakers provide surround sound—popular
not only for games but also for those who enjoy playing DVDs on their
PCs. The card shown in Figure 13.53, for example, has outputs for
many speakers.
Another popular speaker addition is a subwoofer. A subwoofer
provides the amazing low-frequency sounds that give an extra dimen-
sion to all of your sounds, from the surround sound of a game to the music
of a simple stereo MP3 file. Almost all modern sound cards support both
surround sound and a subwoofer and advertise this with a nomenclature
such as Dolby Digital or DTS. Figure 13.54 shows one type of surround
speaker system. (You’ll learn more about surround sound in the upcoming
“Speakers” section.)
Recording Quality
Almost every sound card has an input for a powered mi-
crophone, but the high-end cards record with substan-
tially lower amounts of noise or other audible artifacts.
The measure that describes the relative quality of an input
port is signal-to-noise ratio and is expressed in decibels.
The smaller the number, the worse the card is for record-
ing, because you’re more likely to get noise. Most sound
cards at the low end and in the mid range have a signal-
to-noise ratio of 30 to 50 decibels, which makes them un-
acceptable for recording. High-end cards offer a 96 to
100+ signal-to-noise ratio, a level near what professional
musicians use. Check the documentation before you buy
or recommend a sound card for recording purposes
(Figure 13.55).
Jacks
Virtually every sound card comes with at least three connections: one for a
stereo speaker system, one for a microphone, and one for a secondary input
called line in. If you look at the back of a motherboard with a built-in sound
card, you’ll invariably see these three connections. On most systems, the
main stereo speaker connector is green, the line in connector is blue, and the
microphone connector is pink. You’ll often find plenty of other connectors
as well (Figure 13.56).

adding a host of extra goodies and capabilities to their
cards that, for some folks, prove irresistibly tempting.
These include a digital output to integrate the PC with a
home entertainment unit, DVD receiver, and surround
sound speaker connection capabilities; a breakout box
that adds recording and output ports in a 5.25-inch bay;
and a FireWire connection for direct gaming, file sharing,
and immediate MP3 playing from a portable MP3 device.
Figure 13.57 shows a version of the Creative Labs
SoundBlaster breakout box. These features aren’t for ev-
eryone, but they are compelling to many consumers.
Speakers
It always blows me away when I walk into someone’s study
and hear tinny music whining from a $10 pair of speakers
connected to a $2000 computer. If you listen to music or play
games on your computer, a decent set of speakers can sig-
nificantly improve the experience. Speakers come in a wide
variety of sizes, shapes, technologies, and quality and can
stump the uninformed tech who can’t easily tell that the $50
set on the right sounds 100 times better than the $25 pair on
the left (Figure 13.58).
Speaker Standards
The advent of surround sound in the
computing world has created a number of speaker stan-
dards. You should know these standards so you can choose
the speakers that work best for you and your clients.
Stereo is the oldest speaker technology you’ll see in the
PC world. Stereo speakers are just what you might imagine:
two speakers, a left and a right (Figure 13.59). The two
speakers share a single jack that connects to the sound card.
Most cheap speakers are stereo speakers.
A 2.1 speaker system consists of a pair of standard stereo speakers—
called satellites—combined with a subwoofer (Figure 13.60). The average
2.1 speaker system has a single jack that connects to the sound card and runs

manufacturer’s low-end speaker set (left)

into the subwoofer. Another wire runs from the subwoofer to the two stereo
speakers. If you want to enjoy great music and don’t need surround sound,
this is your speaker standard of choice.
Going beyond standard two-channel (stereo) sound has been a goal in
the sound world since the 1970s. However, it wasn’t until the advent of
Dolby Laboratory’s Dolby Digital sound standard in the early 1990s that sur-
round sound began to take off. The Dolby Digital sound standard is de-
signed to support five channels of sound: front-left, front-right, front-center,
rear-left, and rear-right. Dolby Digital also supports a subwoofer—thus, the
term 5.1. Another company, Digital Theatre Systems (DTS), created a com-
peting standard that also supported a 5.1 speaker system. When DVDs were
introduced, they included both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 standards, mak-
ing 5.1 speakers an overnight requirement for home theater. If you want to
enjoy your DVDs in full surround sound on your PC, you must purchase a
full 5.1 speaker system. A number of 5.1 speaker systems are available for
PCs. The choice you make is usually determined by what sounds best to you.
Many sound cards also come with a special Sony/Philips Digital Interface
(S/PDIF) connector that enables you to connect your sound card directly to a
5.1 speaker system or receiver (Figure 13.61). Using a single S/PDIF instead
of a tangle of separate wires for each speaker greatly simplifies your sound
setup. S/PDIF connections come in two types, optical and coaxial. The opti-
cal variety looks like a square with a small door (at right in Figure 13.61).
The coaxial is a standard RCA connector (at left), the same type used to con-
nect a CD player to your stereo. It doesn’t matter which one you use; just
make sure you have an open spot on your receiver or speakers.
Games can also take advantage of 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 speakers, but they use
the DirectX standard. DirectX offers numerous commands, also known as
APIs, that issue instructions such as “make a sound on the right speaker” or
“play music in both the right and left channels.” DirectX simplifies the pro-
gramming needed to create sound and video: rather than having to program

Only a few 5.1 PC speaker sets
come with S/PDIF. In most cases,
you’ll have to use the regular au-
dio outputs on the sound card.
You’ll find the connector more
common on 6.1 and 7.1 sets.
• Figure 13.61

sounds in different ways for each sound card option, games can talk
DirectX. The hardware manufacturers simply have to ensure that their
sound cards are DirectX compatible.
DirectX version 3 introduced DirectSound3D (DS3D), which offered a
range of commands to place a sound anywhere in 3-D space. Known as posi-
tional audio, it fundamentally changed the way most PC games were
played. DS3D could not handle all sound information, but it supported ex-
tensions to its instructions for more advanced sound features. This chal-
lenged the sound card designers to develop more fully the concept of
positional audio. Creative Labs responded by rolling out environmental au-
dio extensions (EAX), a set of audio presets that gave developers the capabil-
ity to create a convincing sense of environment in entertainment titles and a
realistic sense of distance between the player and audio events. Figure 13.62
shows an EAX setup screen.
In late 2000, a number of EAX effects were incorporated into the DirectX
audio component of DirectX 8.0. This signaled the acceptance of EAX as the
standard for audio effects in gaming. Shortly afterward, Creative Labs
started releasing audio cards that were Dolby 5.1 compatible out of the box.
This let you plug a 5.1 speaker system directly into your sound card. The
sound card automatically decoded the Dolby/DTS sound track when you
played a DVD and the EAX effects when you played a game that supports it.
All current sound cards support DirectX and EAX.
Microsoft changed the way audio works in Windows Vista from the way
it works in previous versions of Windows. Most notably, Vista doesn’t sup-
port direct hardware access to sound, so DirectSound does not work. Third-
party developers have created various workarounds for this lack of support
to enable some older games and hardware to function in Windows Vista.
Other developers have gotten behind the OpenAL API to provide environ-
mental audio effects in Vista. Specific OpenAL drivers for games have to be
included to provide that support.
450

Not all cards support Dolby
Digital/DTS. Most software DVD
players and some sound cards
support Dolby Digital. DTS sup-
port is a little harder to come by.
Check the manufacturer’s Web
site to determine whether your
card will work with DTS.

Speaker Features
Speakers also come with a few other features that you
should consider when choosing a set for yourself or your clients. Speakers
offer a variety of power sources, controls accessibility, and headphone jacks.
Most speakers have volume controls as well as an on/off switch. Get a
system that provides easy access to those controls by placing them on an
easy-to-reach speaker or on a special control box.
The problem with headphones is that you need to plug them into the back
of the sound card and then tell Windows to output to them from the Sound ap-
plet on the Control Panel. Save yourself a lot of hassle and get a speaker system
that has a handy microphone jack on one of the speakers or on a control box.
■Video Capture
A microphone, sound card, and software enable you to capture audio, but
with a camera capable of capturing full motion video as well as sound, you
can turn the PC into your very own movie studio. This is called video capture.
To capture video from a source requires you to have the proper hardware
installed to provide an interface with the camcorder or video player and, if
the source is analog, provide translation of the signal as well; plus you need
a properly configured application to do the capturing. Once captured, you
can use an application to edit the video file. Then save it in some form for
upload a la YouTube or save it to DVD or other removable media.
Hardware
You need the proper hardware installed to capture video. From a
digital signal, such as a modern camcorder that records directly
to its own internal solid-state hard drive, you simply run a cable
from the FireWire out port on the camcorder to the FireWire port
on your computer. If the camcorder doesn’t offer FireWire, it’ll
most likely use Hi-Speed USB. When capturing from an analog
source, such as a VHS cassette player or a Hi-8 tape, you’ll need
some kind of connection and translation hardware.
The Pinnacle blueBox pictured in Figure 13.63, for exam-
ple, offers two different dedicated video connections (S-Video
on the left and the yellow RCA jack next to it), stereo RCA au-
dio jacks, plus a FireWire port (on the expansion card for it) for direct con-
nection to FireWire onboard the camcorder. The breakout box uses a
proprietary connection to plug into the PC.
You need a decent-grade computer with lots of free hard drive space and
a substantial amount of RAM to import the video and audio streams from
an external source. And you’ll certainly need a serious processor when it
comes time to edit and compile a new video from the source material.
There’s no simple rule for how much of any resource you’ll need. Different
projects have different demands on the hardware. If you’re setting up a new
computer for video capture, the simple rule is to get as powerful a system as
possible with as much hard drive and RAM capacity as you can afford.
Once you have the hardware in place, the true heavy lifting in video
capture falls on the software.
Chapter 13: Learning Video and Multimedia
451
• Figure 13.63
A video capture device
The FireWire connection
seems redundant—just go
straight to FireWire on the PC,
right? But it’s there to accom-
plish two goals. First, many PCs
don’t have a FireWire port, so
you would either need to add a
FireWire expansion card or use a
different type of port. Second,
Sony produced a series of Hi-8
camcorders some years ago that
had FireWire connectors. Some
translation has to happen to turn
the analog signal digital.

Software
With video editing applications, such as Adobe Premier Elements or Apple
Final Cut, you can import video and then work with it directly. Figure 13.64
shows the former software capturing video and audio translated through
the Pinnacle blueBox from a Hi-8 camcorder. Most webcams—even those
built into portable computers—are analog, rather than digital devices. Thus
some software automatically creates break points in the import to make the
editing process easier.
The video editing software enables you to take video and audio from
one or many sources and arrange clips into a time line. You can add and edit
various transitions between clips, shorten clips, and so on. Figure 13.65
shows the storyboard from Final Cut Pro and a how-to video my team pro-
duced in-house.
Once you’ve finished the editing process, you can export to a file for ar-
chiving, sending out on optical disc, or posting to a video-sharing site. With
an audio file, as discussed earlier, this is a simple process. You pick a format
such as MP3 and save the file. Video is far more complicated.
A video is two or more separate tracks—moving picture and audio—
that each go through a compression algorithm. Otherwise, the resulting files
would be huge, even for short videos. The compressed tracks then get
wrapped up into a container file, what’s often called a wrapper. When you re-
ceive a file saved in a standard wrapper, such as .MOV for a QuickTime
Movie file, you have no way to know for certain which codecs were used to
compress the video or audio tracks inside that container file (Figure 13.66).
452

Codecs
Video files use standard audio codecs for the au-
dio tracks, such as WAV or MP3, but vary
wildly in the type of video codecs used. Just as
with audio codecs, video codecs take a video
stream and compress it by using various algo-
rithms. Here are some of the standard video
codecs:
■
MPEG-2 Part 2, used for DVDs.
■
MPEG-4 Part 2, a codec often used
for Internet broadcasts; you’ll find
implementations of it with other names,
such as DivX.
■
H.264, used for high-definition movies for
Blu-ray Discs, among others.
■
Windows Media Video (WMV), the family of Microsoft-developed
codecs.
■
Theora, an open-source codec developed to go with the Vorbis audio
codec as part of the Ogg project.
■
TrueMotion VP6, used in Adobe Flash; and VP7, used for Skype
video conferencing, among others.
■
VC-1, a Microsoft-designed codec that competes with H.264 and
other higher-end codecs for the hearts and minds of Blu-ray Disc
developers. You’ll usually find it wrapped in a WMV container file
(see the following section).
Chapter 13: Learning Video and Multimedia
453
• Figure 13.65
Editing in Final Cut Pro
• Figure 13.66
A standard container file holds multiple tracks, each
encoded separately.

Wrappers
When both the video and audio streams of your video file are compressed,
the file is placed into some sort of container file or wrapper. The key thing to
note here is that the wrapper file doesn’t necessarily specify how the video
or audio tracks were encoded. You can look at two seemingly identical
movie files, for example, both saved with the .MOV file extension, and find
that one will play audio and video just fine in Windows Media Player, but
the other one might play only the audio and not the video because Media
Player lacks the specific codec needed to decode the video stream. Here are
some of the standard video wrappers:
■
ASF, a container used mainly for WMA and WMV streams; note that
you can also have a WMV wrapper for a WMV-format file.
■
AVI, the standard container file for Windows.
■
Flash Video (.FLV), which contains streams encoded with various
codecs, such as H.263 or VP6; can also handle H.264 codec. Flash
Video has become the dominant standard for displaying video
content on the Web through places such as YouTube and Hulu.
■
MOV, the standard container file for Apple QuickTime for both Mac
OS X and Windows.
■
MPEG-2 Transport Stream (MPEG-TS), a container for broadcasting
that can handle many streams.
■
Ogg, a container file made for the open-source Vorbis and Theora
codecs.
■TV Tuners
With a TV tuner, you can have it all in one package: a computer and the latest
TV show as well. Most local stations (in the United States, at least) broadcast
high-definition signals, so with the proper TV tuner, you can watch your
HDTV without any of the artifacting you see with both cable and satellite
feeds. Plus you can make use of typical cable or satellite feeds to watch tele-
vision as you would with a regular TV. Making it all happen requires four
components: a tuner device, an antenna or cable connection, a tuning appli-
cation, and some sort of program guide.
Tuner Hardware
TV tuners come in just about every expansion option available for computers:
expansion cards that plug into PCI or PCIe slots on the motherboard; PC Card
or ExpressCard for portable computers; or Hi-Speed USB for desktop and
laptop computers. Figure 13.67 shows a PCIe version of an ATI tuner card.
To install a TV tuner, follow standard installation procedures.
To pick up a signal on the TV tuner, just as with a standalone television,
you need some source. Most can handle a cable TV connection, for example,
or an over-the-air antenna. Figure 13.68 shows a USB Hauppauge HDTV
tuner card with retractable antenna. For such a small device, it picks up
HDTV signals quite well. You’ll get the best results for uncompressed HD

ponents for video capture, so

card or expansion device.

signals by using a serious, mounted-on-the-rooftop metal antenna with lots
of tines.
Tuner hardware comes with a standard coaxial connection. You can
plug in a cable or satellite source just as you would any regular television.
Tuner Software
Once you’ve installed the hardware, you need to load the specific applica-
tion or applications that make the tuner work as a tuner. If you have a copy
of Windows Media Center (through either that version of Windows XP or
Windows Vista Ultimate), that will often be the tool of choice. Tuner card
distributors bundle third-party applications with their cards. Figure 13.69
shows the EyeTV software enabling the computer to show television shows.

Chapter 13 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about video and multimedia.
Explain how video displays work
■
The term video encompasses a complex interaction
among numerous parts of the PC, all designed to
put a picture on the screen. The monitor is the
primary output device for the PC and shows you
what’s going on with your programs and operating
system. The video card or display adapter handles
all of the communication between the CPU and the
monitor. Video displays come in three varieties:
CRT, LCD, and projectors.
■
CRT monitors have a tube that contains three electron
guns at the slender end and a display screen coated
with phosphor at the wide end. The speed of the
electron beam across the screen is the horizontal
refresh rate (HRR), more commonly referred to as the
refresh rate. The vertical refresh rate (VRR) is the time
it takes to draw the entire screen and return the
electron guns to the upper-left corner.
■
Monitors do not determine the HRR or VRR. The
video card “pushes” the monitor at a certain VRR
that, in turn, determines the HRR. Setting the VRR
too low results in screen flicker, which causes
headaches and eyestrain. Setting the VRR too high
results in image distortion and damage to the
monitor’s circuitry. The monitor’s bandwidth
dictates the maximum VRR.
■
A monitor is a grid of red, green, and blue light-
sensitive dots called phosphors. Normal CRT
monitors have three electron guns that fire
electrons of different intensities (not colors) at the
colored phosphors. A shadow mask prevents
electron bleed-over so electrons from any of the
three guns hit only their own colored phosphors.
The area of phosphors lit at one instant is a pixel
and must consist of at least one red, one green, and
one blue phosphor; therefore, the smallest pixel, a
triad, would consist of three phosphors.
■
Resolution is the number of horizontal pixels times
the number of vertical pixels. A resolution of 640 ×
480 means 640 pixels across and 480 pixels down,
for a total of 307,200 pixels. Many monitors have a
resolution that matches a 4:3 aspect ratio. Widescreen
monitors have an aspect ratio of 16:9 or 16:10.
■
Dot pitch, measured in millimeters (mm), defines
the diagonal distance between phosphorous dots of
the same color.
■
Liquid crystal displays are the most common type
of display for PCs. They offer many advantages
over CRTs. An LCD monitor is thinner, lighter,
uses less power, is virtually flicker-free, and does
not emit potentially harmful radiation.
■
An LCD screen is composed of tiny liquid crystal
molecules called sub-pixels. Although you may
find dual-scan passive matrix on some low-end
LCD panels, most of today’s LCD panels use active
matrix or thin film transistor (TFT) technology.
■
The typical LCD projector is composed of the LCD
panel, backlights, and inverters. The backlights
require AC power and the electronics require DC.
The AC/DC transformer changes the AC wall
current into DC that the LCD panel can use. All
LCD backlights use cold cathode fluorescent lamp
(CCFL) technology. CCFLs require AC power, so
inverters convert the DC back to AC.
■
LCD monitors, unlike CRTs, have a native
resolution and a fixed pixel size. LCDs cannot run
at a resolution higher than their native resolution,
and running at a lower resolution results in
degraded image quality. Anti-aliasing softens the
edges of jagged pixel corners when running at
lower resolutions, but as the image quality
degrades, you should use the native resolution.
■
LCD monitor brightness is determined by its
backlights and is measured in nits. An average
LCD measures around 300 nits, with higher
numbers being brighter and better.
■
The time it takes for sub-pixels to go from pure
black to pure white and back again is the LCD’s
response rate. Response rate is measured in
milliseconds, with lower numbers being faster and
better. An excellent LCD monitor has a response
rate somewhere between 6 and 8 ms.
456
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

■
LCD monitors lack the color saturation and
contrast of a CRT, making CRT the choice for
graphics artists. Look for an LCD monitor with a
contrast ratio of 450:1 or higher.
■
Projectors come in two main varieties: rear-view
and front-view. Rear-view projectors shoot an
image onto the screen from the back and are almost
always self-enclosed. They are a popular choice for
televisions, but not for PCs. Front-view projectors
shoot an image from the front and are widely used
during computer presentations.
■
LCD projectors, like LCD monitors, have a native
resolution and are lightweight, but lack the image
quality of a CRT. Projector brightness is measured
in lumens. Larger numbers are brighter and better,
with 1500 lumens being sufficient for a small dark
room. The size of the projected image at a certain
distance from the screen is the projector’s throw.
LCD projectors come with internal fans that cool
the lamp. Lamps are costly to replace and are
considered consumable (meaning you can expect
to replace them periodically).
■
Measured from two opposite diagonal corners, size
for CRT monitors is not usually the same as the
viewable image size. A 17-inch CRT monitor might
have only a 15.5-inch VIS. Because LCD monitors
report only VIS, a 15-inch LCD monitor may have
approximately the same viewing area as a 17-inch
CRT.
■
CRT monitors require two connectors: a 15-pin,
three-row DB connector and a power plug. Video
cards use a RAMDAC, which takes the digital signal
from the video card and turns it into an analog
signal for the CRT. LCD monitors require a digital
signal. Analog LCD monitors reverse the effects of
the RAMDAC so you can plug your LCD monitor
into the 15-pin VGA connector on the video card.
■
The DVI standard allows the digital signal from the
PC to be used by the LCD monitor without any
digital-to-analog-and-back-to-digital conversion.
The DVI standard includes DVI-D, DVI-A, and
DVI- I. Both DVI-D and DVI-I come in single-link
and dual-link varieties, with dual-link offering
significantly higher resolutions.
■
Monitors have adjustment controls for brightness,
contrast, image size and position, and color
adjustment. These controls are usually accessed
via an onboard menu system rather than with
hardware knobs or dials.
■
A CRT monitor accounts for about half of the
power consumption of a desktop PC. Monitors
using the VESA standard for power-management
signaling can cut monitor power consumption by
about 75 percent. An LCD monitor uses less than
half the electricity a CRT uses.
Select the proper video card
■
The video card has two major pieces: the video
RAM and the video processing circuitry. The video
RAM stores the video image, and the processing
circuitry is similar to that of your computer’s CPU.
■
The combination of a specific resolution and color
depth is referred to as a mode. The VGA mode is
defined by a resolution of 640 × 480 and 4-bit color
depth (16 colors). Modern video cards and
monitors are capable of supporting many modes.
■
Using more color depth slows down video
functions. PCI slots maxed out at a bandwidth of
132 MBps. The Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) is
better suited for video than PCI because it resides
alone on its own bus, pipelines commands, and
supports sidebanding and system memory access.
■
AGP has undergone several specification
upgrades, and the cards are normally referred to
by their strobe multiplier. Although you can mix
some AGP specifications, it is best to use an AGP
card that is fully supported by your motherboard.
■
PCI Express video cards are becoming more
popular and may soon replace AGP on all new
systems. Like AGP, PCI Express supports
sidebanding and system memory access, but it uses
a faster serial communication method than that of
the parallel communication method used by AGP.
■
Video cards are identified by their manufacturer,
model number, graphic processor, and amount of
video RAM. Although a number of companies
produce video cards, the two major manufacturers
of graphics processors are NVIDIA and ATI. The
most important decision when buying a video card
is the graphics processor, especially if you play 3-D
games where texture and layering are important
considerations.
■
To overcome the bottlenecks of data throughput
speed, access speed, and capacity of video RAM,
manufacturers use specialized fast RAM and more
and more total RAM. Video memory technologies
include VRAM, WRAM, SGRAM, DDR SDRAM,
Chapter 13: Learning Video and Multimedia

DDR2 SDRAM, GDDR3 SDRAM, GDDR4 SDRAM,
and GDDR5 SDRAM.
Describe how to implement sound in a PC
■
The process by which sounds are stored in
electronic format on your PC is called sampling.
Sampling means capturing the state or quality of a
particular sound wave a set number of times each
second. All the characteristics of a particular sound
wave—amplitude, frequency, timbre—need to be
recorded and translated into ones and zeros to
reproduce that sound accurately within the
computer and out to your speakers. Sounds are
sampled thousands of times per second. The
amount of information stored at each sampling is
called the bit depth, and the higher the bit depth,
the better the recording.
■
The popular WAV file format (as well as most other
recorded sound formats) is based on PCM. WAV
files can be huge, especially when sampled at high
frequency and depth, so compression is a popular
way to reduce the file size of recorded sounds. The
most popular compressed file type is MP3.
■
To play sounds, you must have some form of
player software, such as Windows Media Player.
Not all players can play all types of sound files.
Some file formats, such as RealMedia, require their
own proprietary players.
■
MIDI files are not recordings like WAV files. A
MIDI file is a text file that takes advantage of the
sound processing hardware to enable the PC to
produce sound. Programmers use these small files
to tell the sound card what notes to play, how long,
how loud, on which instruments, and so forth.
■
Sound cards use either FM synthesis or wave table
synthesis to store notes for MIDI. FM synthesis
electronically simulates various instruments, whereas
wave table synthesis uses pre-recorded instruments.
■
A large number of other sound file formats are
available, such as AAC and WMA. Sounds can also
be found in video formats, applications, and
streaming media, such as the Flash videos on
YouTube.
■
Low-end sound processors do little more than
translate, which means that the CPU has to do the
heavy lifting on the processing front. Better sound
processors, in contrast, shoulder much of the
processing burden and bring a series of extra features
to the table. Most mid-range and all high-end sound
processors offer support for various surround sound
standards, enabling equally equipped games and
other applications to provide positional audio effects
and detailed sound modeling.
■
Every sound card supports two speakers or a pair
of headphones, but many better sound cards
support five or more speakers in discrete channels.
These multiple speakers provide surround sound
and thumping bass through a subwoofer.
■
Better sound cards have a lower signal-to-noise
ratio and support for multiple audio connections,
such as a microphone, line in, and S/PDIF. The
latter is for high-end audio.
■
Speaker standards include stereo (which uses a left
speaker and a right speaker), 2.1 (stereo with an
additional subwoofer), and surround sound. Do
yourself or your client a favor and spend the extra
money for good speakers. They don’t cost that
much more than cheap speakers and they make an
enormous difference for the user experience.
■
Surround sound is popular for games and DVD/
Blu-ray movies. A number of surround sound
standards exist, but the most common are Dolby
Digital and DTS. The Dolby Digital and DTS
standards both require at least five speakers and
a subwoofer.
Explain the function of video capture cards
and TV tuners
■
To capture video from a source requires you to
have the proper hardware installed to provide an
interface with the camcorder or video player and, if
the source is analog, to provide translation of the
signal as well. You also need a properly configured
application to do the capturing.
■
With a fully digital device, you can capture directly
to the PC by using a FireWire or USB connection.
With analog devices, you need some sort of
translation hardware.
■
A computer dedicated to video capture and editing
needs to be a pretty stout machine, with lots of hard
drive space and RAM. The capture and editing
software has a major role in determining the quality
of the capture and any subsequent video.
■
A video is two or more separate tracks—moving
picture and audio—that each go through a
compression algorithm. The compressed tracks
then get wrapped up into a container file or
wrapper. A video can be compressed in one of the
458
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

standard audio codecs, such as MP3, and one of
many video codecs, such as H.264. The wrapper
can likewise be one of many styles, such as AVI.
■
To set up a PC to view television signals requires
several components: a tuner device, an antenna or
cable connection, a tuning application, and some
sort of program guide. Tuner hardware comes in
many forms, such as PCI expansion cards and USB
devices. Tuner devices come with a standard
coaxial jack for connecting an exterior antenna or
cable or satellite connection. Companies bundle
specific tuner software and program guides with
their cards.

here are times when the walls close in, when you need a change of scenery
to get that elusive spark that inspires greatness…or sometimes you just
need to get away from your coworkers for a few hours because they’re driving
you nuts! For many occupations, that’s difficult to do. You must have access to
your documents and spreadsheets; you can’t function without e-mail or the
Internet. In short, you need a computer to get your job done.
Portable computing devices combine mobility with accessibility to bring
you the best of both worlds; put more simply, portables let you take some or
even all of your computing capabilities with you when you go. Some portable
computers feature Windows XP/Vista/7 systems with all the bells and whistles
and all your Microsoft Office apps for a seamless transition from desk to café
table. Even the smallest portable devices enable you to check your appointments
and address book, or surf the Web during the endless wait at the doctor’s office.
This chapter takes an in-depth look at portables, first going through the major
variations you’ll run into and then hitting the tech-specific topic of maintaining
portable computers. Let’s get started!

■Portable Computing Devices
All portable devices share certain features. For output, they have LCD
screens, although these vary from 20-inch behemoths to microscopic 2-inch
screens. Portable computing devices employ sound of varying quality, from
simple beeps to fairly nice music reproductions. All of them run on DC elec-
tricity stored in batteries, although several different technologies offer a
range of battery life, lifespan, and cost. Other than screen, sound, and battery,
portable computing devices come in an amazing variety of shapes, sizes,
and intended uses.
LCD Screens
Laptops come in a variety of sizes
and at varying costs. One major
contributor to the overall cost of a
laptop is the size of the LCD screen.
Most laptops offer a range between
12-inch to 17-inch screens (mea-
sured diagonally), while a few offer
just over 20-inch screens. Not only
are screens getting larger, but also
wider screens have become the
status quo.
Many manufacturers are phasing out the standard 4:3 aspect ratio
screen in favor of the widescreen format. Aspect ratio is the comparison of
the screen width to the screen height. Depending on screen resolution,
widescreens can have varying aspect ratios of 10:6, 16:9, 16:9.5, or 16:10. The
16:9 aspect ratio is the standard for widescreen TVs and 16:10 is the standard
widescreen computer display.
Laptop LCD screens come in a variety of supported resolutions, de-
scribed with acronyms such as XGA, WXGA, WSXGA, and more. The W in
front of the letters indicates widescreen. Table 14.1 lists commonly sup-
ported laptop display resolutions.
Laptop screens come with two types of finish: matte and high gloss. The
matte finish was the industry standard for many years and offered a good
trade-off between richness of colors and reflection or glare. The better

LCD Monitors
Stretching back to the early days of mobile computing, almost every
make and model of portable device has used an LCD monitor of some
shape or size. You know all about LCD monitors from Chapter 13,
“Learning Video and Multimedia.” Everything that applies to desktop
LCDs applies to screens designed for portable devices as well, so turn to
Chapter 13 and cross check your knowledge. What are the variations of
LCD screen you’ll find today? Which technology offers the best picture?
What connectors do you find with LCDs? Are there any special rules
about cleaning LCD monitors? (Talk about a leading question!)

screens have a wide viewing angle and decent response time. The major
drawback for matte-finished laptop screens is that they wash out a lot in
bright light. Using such a laptop at an outdoor café, for example, is almost
hopeless during daylight.
Manufacturers released high-gloss laptop screens in 2006, and they’ve
rapidly taken over many store shelves. The high-gloss finish offers sharper
contrast, richer colors, and wider viewing angles when compared to the
matte screens. Each manufacturer has a different name for high-gloss coat-
ings. Dell calls theirs TrueLife, Acer calls theirs CrystalBrite, and HP calls
theirs BrightView. The drawback to the high-gloss screens is that, contrary
to what the manufacturers claim, they pick up lots of reflection from nearby
objects, including the user! So although they’re usable outside during the
day, you’ll need to contend with increased reflection as well.
Desktop Replacements
When asked about portable computing devices, most folks de-
scribe the traditional clamshell laptop computer, such as the
one shown in Figure 14.1, with built-in LCD monitor, key-
board, and input device (a touchpad, in this case). A typical lap-
top computer functions as a fully standalone PC, potentially
even replacing the desktop. The laptop shown in Figure 14.1,
for example, has all of the features you expect the modern PC
to have, such as a fast CPU, lots of RAM, a high-capacity hard
drive, CD-RW and DVD drives, an excellent sound system,
and a functioning copy of Windows. Attach it to a network and
you can browse the Internet and send e-mail. Considering that
it weighs almost as much as a mini-tower PC (or at least it feels
like it does when I’m lugging it through the airport!), such a
portable can be considered a desktop replacement, because it
does everything most people want to do with a desktop PC
and doesn’t compromise performance just to make the laptop
a few pounds lighter or the battery last an extra hour.
To get around not having a desktop’s full-size keyboard, most portables
have a special Function (FN) key on the keyboard that, when pressed, adds
an additional option to certain keys on the keyboard. Figure 14.2 shows a
464

even additional storage.

close-up of a typical keyboard with the Function key; note the other options
you can access with the Function key, such as indicated on the F2 key.
For input devices, desktop replacements (and other portables) used
trackballs in the early days, often plugged in like a mouse and clipped to the
side of the case. Other models with trackballs placed them in front of the
keyboard at the edge of the case nearest the user, or behind the keyboard at
the edge nearest the screen.
The next wave to hit the laptop market was IBM’s TrackPoint device, a
joystick the size of a pencil eraser, situated in the center of the keyboard.
With the TrackPoint, you can move the pointer around without taking your
fingers away from the “home” typing position. You use a forefinger to push
the joystick around, and then click or right-click, using two buttons below
the SPACEBAR. This type of pointing device has since been licensed for use by
other manufacturers, and it continues to appear on laptops today.
But by far the most common laptop pointing device found today is the
touchpad (Figure 14.3)—a flat, touch-sensitive pad just in front of the key-
board. To operate a touchpad, you simply glide your finger across its sur-
face to move the pointer, and tap the surface once or twice to single- or
double-click. You can also click by using buttons just below the pad. Most
people get the hang of this technique after just a few minutes of practice. The
main advantage of the touchpad over previous laptop pointing devices is
that it uses no moving parts—a fact that can really extend the life of a hard-
working laptop. Some modern laptops actually provide both a TrackPoint-
type device and a touchpad, to give the user a choice.
Desktop Extenders
Manufacturers offer desktop extender portable devices
that don’t replace the desktop but rather extend it by giv-
ing you a subset of features of the typical desktop that
you can take away from the desk. Figure 14.4 shows a
portable with a good but small 13.4-inch-wide screen.
The system has 2 GB of RAM, a 2-GHz processor, a 60-GB
hard drive, and a battery that enables you to do work on
it for more than five hours while disconnected from the
wall socket. Even though it plays music and has a couple
of decent tiny speakers, you can’t game on this computer
(Solitaire, perhaps, but definitely not Crysis!). But it
weighs only five pounds, nearly half the weight of the
typical desktop replacement portable.
Desktop extenders enable you to go mobile. When
I’m on a roll writing, for example, I don’t want to stop.
But sometimes I do want to take a break from the office
and stroll over to my favorite café for a latté or a pint of
fine ale. At moments like these, I don’t need a fully fea-
tured laptop with a monster 15- or 17-inch screen, but just
a good word processing system—and perhaps the ability
to surf the Internet on the café’s wireless network so I can goof off research
other important topics once I finish my project for the day. A lightweight
laptop with a 12- or 13-inch screen, a reasonably fast processor, and gobs of
RAM does nicely.

Tech Tip
What’s In a Name?
No industry standard exists for
the vast majority of styles of por-
table computing devices, so man-
ufacturers let their marketing
folks have fun with naming.
What’s the difference between a
portable, a laptop, and a note-
book? Nothing. One manufac-
turer might call its four-pound
portable system with a 12-inch
LCD a notebook, while another
manufacturer might call its much
larger desktop-replacement porta-
ble a notebook as well. A laptop
refers in general to the clamshell,
keyboard-on-the-bottom and
LCD-screen-at-the-top design
that is considered the shape of
mobile PCs.
• Figure 14.3

Netbooks
Netbooks are computers that fill the gap between PDAs and the smaller
laptops. These machines usually have displays in the 6- to 10-inch range,
modest-sized hard drives, and CPUs geared more for minimal power usage
than raw speed. With netbooks, the focus is on small size and low price com-
pared to their more full-featured cousins. This segment of the market is ever
evolving, though, and there is quite a bit of blurring between the various
classes of laptops.
A prime example of the netbook is the Asus Eee PC, shown in Figure 14.5
sitting on a full-sized laptop. This netbook has a 9-inch screen, a 1.6-GHz
Intel Atom CPU, a small solid-state drive, and runs a customized Linux
distribution. A key distinguishing feature of these netbooks is the use of Intel’s
Atom processor. The Atom CPU is very useful for keeping power usage down
but has much less computing power than its more power-hungry siblings.

Tech Tip
Spin the Weight
Manufacturers advertise the
weight of portable PCs, for the
most part, without the weight of
the battery or the removable
drives. Although this deception is
deplorable, it’s pretty much uni-
versal in the industry because no
manufacturer wants to be the
first to say that their desktop-
replacement portable, including
battery and DVD-RW drive,
weighs 15 pounds, when their
competitor advertises the same
kind of machine at 7.5 pounds!
They’d lose market share quickly.
So when you shop for or rec-
ommend portable PCs, take the
real weight into consideration. By
the time you fill your laptop bag
with a power adapter, external
mouse, spare battery, and all the
extra accessories, you’ll definitely
be carrying more than the adver-
tised 5–6 pounds.
• Figure 14.4

Therefore, most netbooks run either Windows XP or some form of Linux
that is better suited for their limited resources.
PDAs and Smartphones
Having a few computing essentials on hand at all times eases the day and
makes planning and scheduling much more likely to succeed. Several com-
panies, such as Palm, Apple, HTC, RIM, and Hewlett-Packard, manufacture
tiny handheld portable computing devices that hold such data as your ad-
dress book, appointment schedules, music, movies, and more. Such ma-
chines
are
called
personal
digital
assistants
(PDAs),
or
smartphones if they have calling capabilities. All modern
PDAs have many applications, such as Web browsers for surf-
ing the Web on the go, some sort of note-taking application for
jotting down quick notes, and many more. Figure 14.6 shows
an Apple iPhone smartphone.
PDAs don’t run Windows XP or Vista but rather require
specialized OSes such as Windows Mobile, Google Android,
Apple iPhone OS, Palm WebOS, and various forms of Linux.
All of these OSes provide a GUI that enables you to interact
with the device by touching the screen directly. Many of to-
day’s PDAs use handwriting recognition combined with mod-
ified mouse functions, usually in the form of a pen-like stylus
to make a type of input called pen-based computing. To make
an application load, for example, you would slide the stylus
out of its holder in the PDA case and touch the appropriate
icon with the stylus tip.
Sync
PDAs make excellent pocket companions because you can quickly add a cli-
ent’s address or telephone number, verify the day’s schedule before going to
your next meeting, and check your e-mail. Best of all, you can then update
all the equivalent features on your desktop PC automatically! PDAs syn-
chronize with your primary PC so you have the same essential data on both
machines. Many PDAs come with a cradle, a place to rest your PDA and re-
charge its battery. The cradle connects to the PC most often through a USB
port. You can run software to synchronize the data between the PDA and
the main PC. Setting up for a PDA running Windows Mobile, for example,
requires you to install a program called Activesync if you’re using Windows XP.
Vista and Windows 7 drop Activesync and use the built-in Windows Mobile
Device Center (WMDC). This software handles all the synchronization chores.
You simply place the PDA in the properly connected cradle to synchronize.
Figure 14.7 shows a PDA in the middle of a sync operation.
PDA to PDA Communication
Just about every PDA comes with a way to move data from one PDA to an-
other. The original technology for this is called IrDA and the process is called
beaming. IrDA uses infrared light just like a TV remote to transmit the data
between devices. You can use beaming to quickly transfer contact info or small
pictures, but larger files take much longer because of IrDA’s slow speed.
Chapter 14: Learning Portable Computing
467
At the time that this book
went to press, some netbooks
had started shipping with Win-
dows 7 Starter OS, a stripped-
down version of Windows 7
designed to use resources such
as RAM and CPU processing as
lightly as possible.
• Figure 14.6
Apple iPhone
Sadly, the heavy Windows-
only attitude of the CompTIA A+
exams means you won’t get
any questions about the Apple
iPhone. All the same, the iPhone
is a great example of what a
smartphone should be; I own one.
• Figure 14.7
A sync operation

Today, the primary way to move data between PDAs is with radio
waves, be it Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or what CompTIA calls Cellular WAN.
Bluetooth can be thought of as the most direct replacement for the old IrDA
tech. When you wish to transfer files between two Bluetooth devices, you
first make each device discoverable, which allows other devices in the area to
see that it exists. On the sending device, you then select the PDA you wish to
send to. The receiving device asks you if you wish to accept the file, and once
that’s granted, you simply stand there and wait for a moment while the
PDAs transfer data. Slick!
With Wi-Fi and Cellular WAN, your PDA acts just like any other com-
puter on a network. You will have an IP address and—depending on the OS
your PDA is running—the capability to share files and data. Most PDAs to-
day use a touch screen for entering data and use IrDA, Wi-Fi, and/or
Bluetooth connections to communicate with other devices.
PDA Storage
Almost every PDA has both internal flash ROM memory of 1 MB or more
and some sort of removable and upgradeable storage medium. Secure Digi-
tal (SD) technology has the strongest market share among the many compet-
ing standards, but you’ll find a bunch of different memory card types out
there. SD is by far the most popular, with the cards coming in a variety of
physical sizes (SD, Mini SD, and Micro SD) and fitting in a special SD slot.
You’ll find capacities ranging from 4 MB up to 32 GB—on a card the size of a
postage stamp! Figure 14.8 shows some typical memory cards.
Tablet PCs
Tablet PCs combine the handwriting benefits of PDAs with the full-fledged
power of traditional portable PCs to create a machine that perfectly meets the
needs of many professions. Unlike PDAs and smartphones, tablet PCs use a full-
featured PC operating system such as Microsoft Vista Home Premium and up.
Instead of (or in addition to) a keyboard and mouse, tablet PCs provide a
screen that doubles as an input device. With a special pen, called a stylus,
you can actually write on the screen (Figure 14.9). Just make sure you don’t
grab your fancy Cross ballpoint pen accidentally and start writing on the
screen! Unlike many PDA screens, most tablet PC
screens are not pressure sensitive—you have to use
the stylus to write on the screen. Tablet PCs come in
two main form factors: convertibles, which include a
keyboard that you can fold out of the way, and
slates, which do away with the keyboard entirely.
The convertible tablet PC in Figure 14.9, for exam-
ple, looks and functions just like the typical clam-
shell laptop shown back in Figure 14.1. But here it’s
shown with the screen rotated 180 degrees and
snapped flat so it functions as a slate. Pretty slick!
In applications that aren’t “tablet-aware,” the sty-
lus acts just like a mouse, enabling you to select items,
double-click, right-click, and so on. To input text with
the stylus, you can either tap keys on a virtual key-
board (Figure 14.10), write in the writing utility

Memory Cards
Memory cards made the leap in
2003 from the exclusive realm of
tiny devices such as PDAs and
digital photographic cameras to
full-featured portable PCs and
even desktop models. Many lap-
top PCs sport SD card slots, for
example, and you can expect
nearly every Sony PC—portable
or otherwise—made in 2003 and
later to offer a Memory Stick port.

(Figure 14.11), or use speech recognition software. With a little practice, most
users find the computer’s accuracy in recognizing their handwriting to be suffi-
cient for most text input, although speedy touch-typists will probably still want
to use a keyboard when typing longer documents.
Tablet PCs work well when you have limited space or have to walk
around and use a laptop. Anyone who has ever tried to type with one hand
while walking around the factory floor and holding the laptop with the
other hand will immediately appreciate the beauty of a tablet PC. In this

scenario, tablet PCs are most effective when combined with applications de-
signed to be used with a stylus instead of a keyboard. An inventory control
program, for example, might present drop-down lists and radio buttons to
the user, making a stylus the perfect input tool. With the right custom appli-
cation, tablet PCs become indispensable tools.
Microsoft encourages software developers to take advantage of a feature
they call digital ink, which allows applications to accept pen strokes as input
without first converting the pen strokes into text or mouse-clicks. In
Microsoft Journal, which comes with Windows-based tablet PCs, you can
write on the screen just as though you were writing on a paper legal pad
(Figure 14.12). Many other applications, including Microsoft Office, allow

you to add ink annotations. Imagine sitting on an airplane reviewing a
Microsoft Word document and simply scribbling your comments on the
screen (Figure 14.13). No more printing out hard copy and breaking out the
red pen for me! Imagine running a PowerPoint presentation and being able
to annotate your presentation as you go. In the future, look for more applica-
tions to support Microsoft’s digital ink.
Many useful third-party applications are designed specifically to take ad-
vantage of the tablet PC form factor. In fields such as law and medicine, where
tablet PCs have been especially popular, the choices are endless. One handy

free utility that anyone who spends time in front of an audience (teachers,
salespeople, cult leaders, and so on) will appreciate is InkyBoard
(www.cfcassidy.com/Inkyboard). InkyBoard provides a virtual dry-erase
board, eliminating the need to find a flip chart or dry-erase board when hold-
ing meetings. Ever wished you could have a record of everything that was
written on the chalkboard in a class (or business meeting)? If the professor had
used InkyBoard, creating and distributing a copy would be a snap.

■Managing and Maintaining
Portable Computers
Most portable PCs come from the factory solidly built and configured. Man-
ufacturers know that few techs outside their factories know enough to work
on them, so they don’t cut corners. From a tech’s standpoint, your most
common work on managing and maintaining portables involves taking care
of the batteries and extending the battery life through proper power man-
agement, keeping the machine clean, and avoiding excessive heat.
Everything you normally do to maintain a PC applies to portable PCs.
You need to keep current on Windows patches and service packs and use
stable, recent drivers. Run Check Disk with some frequency, and definitely
defragment the hard drive. Disk Cleanup is a must if the laptop runs Win-
dows XP or Windows Vista. That said, let’s look at issues specifically involv-
ing portables.
Batteries
Manufacturers use three types of batteries for portable PCs, and each bat-
tery type has its own special needs and quirks. Once you have a clear under-
standing of the quirks, you can usually spot and fix battery problems. The
three types of batteries commonly used in mobile PCs are Nickel-Cadmium
(Ni-Cd), Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH), and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) batteries.
Manufacturers have also started working with fuel cell batteries, although
most of that work is experimental at this writing.

Nickel-Cadmium
Ni-Cds were the first batteries commonly used in mobile PCs,
which means the technology was full of little problems. Proba-
bly most irritating was a little thing called battery memory, or
the tendency of a Ni-Cd battery to lose a significant amount of
its rechargeability if it was charged repeatedly without being
totally discharged. A battery that originally kept a laptop run-
ning for two hours would eventually only keep that same lap-
top going for 30 minutes or less. Figure 14.14 shows a typical
Ni-Cd battery.
To prevent memory problems, a Ni-Cd battery had to be
discharged completely before each recharging. Recharging
was tricky as well, because Ni-Cd batteries disliked being
overcharged. Unfortunately, there was no way to verify when
a battery was fully charged without an expensive charging
machine, which none of us had. As a result, most Ni-Cd batter-
ies lasted an extremely short time before having to be replaced. A quick fix
was to purchase a conditioning charger. These chargers would first totally
discharge the Ni-Cd battery and then generate a special “reverse” current
that, in a way, cleaned internal parts of the battery so it could be recharged
more often and would run longer on each recharge. Ni-Cd batteries would,
at best, last for 1000 charges, and far fewer with poor treatment. Ni-Cds
were extremely susceptible to heat and would self-discharge over time if not
used. Leaving a Ni-Cd in the car in the summer was guaranteed to result in a
fully discharged battery in next to no time!
But Ni-Cd batteries didn’t stop causing trouble after they died. The
highly toxic metals inside the batteries made it unacceptable simply to
throw them in the trash. Ni-Cd batteries should be disposed of via spe-
cialized disposal companies. This is very important! Even though Ni-Cd
batteries aren’t used in PCs very often anymore, many devices, such as
cellular and cordless phones, still use Ni-Cd batteries. Don’t trash the
environment by tossing Ni-Cds in a landfill. Turn them in at the closest
special disposal site; most recycling centers are glad to take them. Also,
many battery manufacturers/distributors will take them. The environ-
ment you help preserve just might be yours—or your kids’!
Nickel-Metal Hydride
Ni-MH batteries (Figure 14.15) were the next generation of mobile PC
batteries and are still quite common today. Basically, Ni-MH batteries
are Ni-Cd batteries without most of the headaches. Ni-MH batteries
are much less susceptible to memory problems, can tolerate overcharg-
ing better, can take more recharging, and can last longer between
rechargings. Like Ni-Cds, Ni-MH batteries are susceptible to heat, but
at least they are considered less toxic to the environment. A special dis-
posal is still a good idea. Unlike Ni-Cds, it’s usually better to recharge
an Ni-MH with shallow recharges as opposed to a complete dis-
charge/recharge. Ni-MH is a popular replacement battery for Ni-Cd
systems.

You must use disposal com-
panies or battery recycling ser-
vices to dispose of the highly
toxic Ni-Cd batteries.
• Figure 14.15
Ni-MH battery

Lithium-Ion
The most common type of battery used today is Li-Ion
(Figure 14.16). Li-Ion batteries are powerful, completely
immune to memory problems, and last at least twice as
long as comparable Ni-MH batteries on one charge. Sadly,
they can’t handle as many charges as Ni-MH types, but to-
day’s users are usually more than glad to give up total bat-
tery lifespan in return for longer periods between charges.
Li-Ion batteries will explode if they are overcharged, so all
Li-Ion batteries sold with PCs have built-in circuitry to
prevent accidental overcharging. Lithium batteries can
only be used on systems designed to use them. They can’t
be used as replacement batteries.
Other Portable Power Sources
In an attempt to provide better maintenance for laptop batteries, manufac-
turers have developed a new type of battery called the smart battery. Smart
batteries tell the computer when they need to be charged, conditioned, or
replaced.
The Care and Feeding of Batteries
In general, keep in mind the following basics. First, always store batteries in
a cool place. Although a freezer is in concept an excellent storage place, the
moisture, metal racks, and food make it a bad idea. Second, use a charger for
your Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries that also conditions the batteries; they’ll
last longer. Third, keep battery contacts clean with a little alcohol or just a
dry cloth. Fourth, never handle a battery that has ruptured or broken; battery
chemicals are very dangerous. Finally, always recycle old batteries.
Power Management
Many different parts are included
in the typical laptop, and each part
uses power. The problem with early
laptops was that every one of these
parts used power continuously,
whether or not the system needed
that device at that time. For exam-
ple, the hard drive continued to
spin even when it was not being ac-
cessed, and the LCD panel contin-
ued to display even when the user
walked away from the machine.
The optimal situation would
be a system where the user could
instruct the PC to shut down un-
used devices selectively, preferably
by defining a maximum period of
inactivity that, when reached, would trigger the PC to shut down the in-
active device. Longer periods of inactivity would eventually enable the entire

Recycling Old Portable PC Batteries
Got an old portable PC battery lying around? Well, you need to get rid
of it, and there are some pretty nasty chemicals in that battery, so you
can’t just throw it in the trash. Sooner or later, you’ll probably need to
deal with such a battery, so Try This!
1.
Do an online search to find the battery recycling center nearest
to you.
2.
Sometimes, you can take old laptop batteries to an auto parts
store that disposes of old car batteries—I know it sounds odd,
but it’s true! See if you can find one in your area that will do this.

Many cities offer a hazardous materials disposal or recycling
service. Check to see if and how your local government will help
you dispose of your old batteries.

system to shut itself down, leaving critical information loaded in RAM,
ready to restart if a wake-up event (such as moving the mouse or pressing a
key) told the system to restart. The system would have to be sensitive to po-
tential hazards, such as shutting down in the middle of writing to a drive,
and so on. Also, this feature could not add significantly to the cost of the PC.
Clearly, a machine that could perform these functions would need special-
ized hardware, BIOS, and operating system to operate properly. This pro-
cess of cooperation among the hardware, the BIOS, and the OS to reduce
power use is known generically as power management.
System Management Mode
Intel began the process of power management with a series of new features
built into the 386SX CPU. These new features not only enabled the CPU to
slow down or stop its clock without erasing the register information, but also
enabled power saving in peripherals. These features were collectively called
System Management Mode (SMM). All modern CPUs have SMM. Although a
power-saving CPU was okay, power management was relegated to special
“sleep” or “doze” buttons that would stop the CPU and all of the peripherals
on the laptop. To take real advantage of SMM, the system needed a special-
ized BIOS and OS to go with the SMM CPU. To this end, Intel put forward the
Advanced Power Management (APM) specification in 1992 and the Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) standard in 1996.
Requirements for APM/ACPI
To function fully, APM and ACPI require a number of items. First is an
SMM-capable CPU. As virtually all CPUs are SMM-capable, this is easy.
Second is an APM-compliant BIOS that enables the CPU to shut off the pe-
ripherals when desired. The third requirement is devices that will accept be-
ing shut off. These devices are usually called Energy Star devices, which
signals their compliance with the EPA’s Energy Star standard. To be an En-
ergy Star device, a peripheral must be able to shut down without actually
turning off and be able to show that it uses much less power than the
non–Energy Star equivalent. Last, the system’s OS must know how to re-
quest that a particular device be shut down, and the CPU’s clock must be
slowed down or stopped.
ACPI goes beyond the APM standard by supplying support for hot-
swappable devices—always a huge problem with APM. This feature aside,
it is a challenge to tell the difference between an APM system and an ACPI
system at first glance.
APM/ACPI Levels
APM defined four power-usage operating levels for a system. These levels
are intentionally fuzzy to give manufacturers considerable leeway in their
use; the only real difference among them is the amount of time each takes to
return to normal usage. These levels are as follows:
■
Full On
Everything in the system is running at full power. There is
no power management.
■
APM Enabled
CPU and RAM are running at full power. Power
management is enabled. An unused device may or may not be shut
down.
476
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Don’t limit your perception of
APM, ACPI, and Energy Star just
to laptops. Virtually all desktop
systems and many appliances
also use the power management
functions.

■
APM Standby
CPU is stopped. RAM still stores all programs. All
peripherals are shut down, although configuration options are still
stored. (In other words, to get back to APM Enabled, you won’t have
to reinitialize the devices.)
■
APM Suspend
Everything in the PC is shut down or at its lowest
power-consumption setting. Many systems use a special type of
Suspend called hibernation, where critical configuration information
is written to the hard drive. Upon a wake-up event, the system is
reinitialized, and the data is read from the drive to return the system
to the APM Enabled mode. Clearly, the recovery time between
Suspend and Enabled will be much longer than the time between
Standby and Enabled.
ACPI, the successor to APM, handles all these levels plus a few more,
such as “soft power on/off,” that enables you to define the function of the
power button. You should familiarize yourself with the following ACPI
global (G) and sleeping (S) system power state specifications for both the
CompTIA A+ Essentials exam and your own practical application:
■
G0 (S0)
Working state.
■
G1
Sleeping state mode. Further subdivided into four S states:
■
S1
CPU stops processing. Power to CPU and memory (RAM) is
maintained.
■
S2
CPU is powered down.
■
S3
Sleep or Standby mode. Power to RAM still on.
■
S4
Hibernation mode. Information in RAM is stored to
nonvolatile memory or drive and powered off.
■
G2 (S5)
Soft power off mode. Certain devices used to wake a
system—such as keyboard, LAN, USB, and other devices—remain
on, while most other components are powered to a mechanical off
state (G3).
■
G3
Mechanical off mode. The system and all components, with the
exception of the real-time clock (RTC), are completely powered down.
Configuration of APM/ACPI
You configure APM/ACPI via CMOS settings or through Windows. Win-
dows settings override CMOS settings. Although the APM/ACPI standards
permit a great deal of flexibility, which can create some confusion among
different implementations, certain settings apply generally to CMOS config-
uration. First is the ability to initialize power management; this enables the
system to enter the APM Enabled mode. Often CMOS then presents time
frames for entering Standby and Suspend modes, as well as settings to de-
termine which events take place in each of these modes.
Many CMOS versions present settings to determine wake-up events,
such as directing the system to monitor a modem or a NIC (Figure 14.17).
You’ll see this feature as Wake on LAN or something similar. A true ACPI-
compliant CMOS provides an ACPI setup option. Figure 14.18 shows a typi-
cal modern BIOS that provides this setting.
Chapter 14: Learning Portable Computing
477

APM/ACPI settings can be found in the Windows 2000/XP/Vista Con-
trol Panel applet Power Options. In Windows XP, the Power Options applet
has several built-in power schemes such as Home/Office and Max Battery
that put the system into Standby or Suspend after a certain interval (Figure
14.19). You can also require the system to go into Standby after a set period
of time or to turn off the monitor or hard drive after a time, thus creating
your own custom power scheme. This is technically called adjusting the
sleep timers.
Windows Vista’s built-in power schemes are similar to Windows XP’s,
though you can better control power utilization by customizing a Balanced,
Power saver, or High performance power plan (Figure 14.20). You can cus-
tomize a power saver plan for your laptop, for example, and configure it to
turn off the display at a certain time interval while on battery or plugged in
and configure it to put the computer to sleep as desired (Figure 14.21).

clicking the Power button in the
Monitor power section of the
Screen Saver tab. In Windows
Vista, right-click the Desktop,

Another feature, Hibernate mode, takes everything in active memory
and stores it on the hard drive just before the system powers down. When
the PC comes out of hibernation, Windows reloads all the files and applica-
tions into RAM. Figure 14.22 shows the Power Options Properties applet in
Windows XP.

Cleaning
Most portable PCs take sub-
stantially more abuse than a
corresponding desktop model.
Constant handling, travel, air-
port food on the run, and so on
can radically shorten the life of
a portable if you don’t take ac-
tion. One of the most important
things you should do is clean
the laptop regularly. Use an ap-
propriate screen cleaner (not a
glass cleaner!) to remove finger-
prints and dust from the fragile
LCD panel. A lint-free cloth
should more than suffice in most
cases.
If you’ve had the laptop in a smoky or dusty environment, try com-
pressed air for cleaning. Compressed air works great for blowing out the
dust and crumbs from the keyboard and for keeping PC Card sockets clear.
Don’t use water on your keyboard! Even a minor amount of moisture inside
the portable can toast a component.
Heat
To manage and maintain a healthy portable PC, you need to deal with issues
of heat. Every portable has a stack of electronic components crammed into a
very small space. Unlike their desktop brethren, portables don’t have lots of
freely moving air space that enables fans to cool everything down. Even
with lots of low-power-consumption devices inside, portable PCs crank out
a good deal of heat. Excessive heat can cause system lockups and hardware
failures, so you should handle the issue wisely. Try this as a starter guide.
■
Use power management, even if you’re plugged into the AC outlet.
This is especially important if you’re working in a warm (more than
80 degrees Fahrenheit) room.
■
Keep air space between the bottom of the laptop and the surface on
which it rests. Putting a laptop on a soft surface, such as a pillow on
your lap, creates a great heat-retention system—not a good thing!
Always use a hard, flat surface.
■
Don’t use a keyboard protector for extended amounts of time.
■
Listen to your fan, assuming the laptop has one. If it’s often running
very fast—you can tell by the high-pitched whirring sound—
examine your power management settings and your environment,
and change whatever is causing heat retention.
■
Speaking of fans, be alert to a fan that suddenly goes silent. Fans do
fail on laptops, causing overheating and failure. All laptop fans can
be replaced easily.

Adjusting Your System’s Power Management
Go into the Power Options applet and take a look at the various settings.
What is the current power scheme for your computer? If you’re using a
laptop with Windows XP, is your system still using the Home/Office
Desktop power scheme? If this is the case, change the power scheme to
Portable/Laptop. If you’re using a laptop with Windows Vista, check to
see if you are running a Balanced or High performance power plan. If
you are, change the power plan to Power saver and familiarize yourself
with some of the advanced power settings (click on the Change advanced
power settings link).
Try changing the individual settings for each power scheme. For in-
stance, set a new value for the System Standby setting—try making
your computer go into standby after five minutes. Don’t worry; you
aren’t going to hurt anything if you fiddle with these settings.
Laptop cooling fans tend to
get dirty over time. Clean them
occasionally using an anti-static
vacuum. Never use canned air!

Protect the Machine
Although prices continue to drop for basic laptops, a fully loaded system is
still pricey. To protect your investment, you’ll want to adhere to certain best
practices. You’ve already read tips in this chapter to deal with cleaning and
heat, so let’s look at the “portable” part of portable computers.
Tripping
Pay attention to where you run the power cord when you plug in a laptop.
One of the primary causes of laptop destruction is people tripping over the
power cord and knocking the laptop off of a desk. This is especially true if
you plug in at a public place such as a café or airport. Remember, the life you
save could be your portable PC’s!
Storage
If you aren’t going to use your laptop or PDA for a while, storing it safely
will go a long way toward keeping it operable when you do power it up
again. Investing in a quality case is worth the extra few dollars—preferably
one with ample padding. Smaller devices such as PDAs are well protected
inside small shock-resistant aluminum cases that clip onto your belt, while
laptops do fine in well-padded cases or backpacks. Not only will this protect
your system on a daily basis when transporting it from home to office, but it
will keep dust and pet hair away as well. Lastly, protect from battery leak-
age by removing the battery if you’ll be storing your device for an extended
time.
Travel
If traveling with a laptop, take care to protect yourself from theft. If possible,
use a case that doesn’t look like a computer case. A well-padded backpack
makes a great travel bag for a laptop and appears less tempting to would-be
thieves. Don’t forget to pack any accessories you might need, like modular
devices, spare batteries, and AC adapters. Make sure to remove any disks,
such as CD/DVD or floppies, from their drives. Most importantly—back up
any important data before you leave!
Make sure to have at least a little battery power available. Heightened
security at airports means you might have to power on your system to prove
it’s really a computer and not a transport case for questionable materials.
And never let your laptop out of your sight. If a security checkpoint involves
putting your laptop through an x-ray machine, request a manual search in-
stead. The x-ray won’t harm your computer like a metal detector would, but
if the laptop gets through the line at security before you do, someone else
might walk away with it. If flying, stow your laptop under the seat in front
of you where you can keep an eye on it.
If you travel to a foreign country, be very careful about the electricity.
North America uses ~115-V power outlets, but the most of the rest of the
world uses ~230-V outlets. Many portable computers have auto-switching
power supplies, meaning they detect the voltage at the outlet and adjust ac-
cordingly. For these portables, a simple plug converter will do the trick.
Other portable computers, however, have fixed-input power supplies, which
means they run only on ~115-V or ~230-V power. For these portables, you
482
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

need a full-blown electricity converting device, either a step-down or step-
up transformer. You can find converters and transformers at electrical parts
stores, such as Radio Shack in the United States.
Shipping
Much of the storage and travel advice can be applied to shipping. Remove the
batteries and the optical discs from their drives. Pack the laptop well and dis-
guise the container as best you can. Back up any data and verify the warranty
coverage. Ship with a reputable carrier and always request a tracking number
and, if possible, delivery signature. It’s also worth the extra couple of bucks to
pay for the shipping insurance. And when the clerk asks what’s in the box, it’s
safer to say “electronics” rather than “a new 20-inch laptop computer.”
Security
The fact is, if someone really wants to steal your laptop, they’ll find a way.
There are, however, some things you can do to make yourself, and your
equipment, less desirable targets. As you’ve already learned, disguise is a
good idea. Although you don’t need to camouflage your laptop or carry it in
a brown grocery bag on a daily basis, an inconspicuous carrying case will
draw less attention.
Another physical deterrent is a laptop lock. Similar to a steel bicycle ca-
ble, there is a loop on one end and a lock on the other. The idea is to loop the
cable around a solid object, such as a bed frame, and secure the lock to the
small security hole on the side of the laptop. Again, if someone really wants
to steal your computer, they’ll find a way. They’ll dismantle the bed frame if
they’re desperate. The best protection is to be vigilant and not let the com-
puter out of your sight.
An alternative to physically securing a laptop with a lock is to use a soft-
ware tracking system. Software makers, such as Computer Security Prod-
ucts, Inc., at www.computersecurity.com, offer tracking software that
transmits a signal to a central office if the computer is stolen and connected
to a phone line or the Internet. The location of the stolen PC can be tracked,
and sensitive files can even be deleted automatically with the aid of the
stealth signal.
PC Cards
The Personal Computer Memory Card International Association
(PCMCIA) establishes standards involving portable comput-
ers, especially when it comes to expansion cards, which are ge-
nerically called PC Cards. PC Cards are roughly credit
card–sized devices that enhance and extend the functions of a
portable PC. PC Cards are as standard on today’s mobile com-
puters as the hard drive. PC Cards are easy to use, inexpensive,
and convenient. Figure 14.23 shows a typical PC Card.
Almost every portable PC has one or two PC Card slots,
into which you insert a PC Card. Each card has at least one
function, but many have two, three, or more! You can buy a PC
Card that offers connections for removable media, for exam-
ple, such as combination SD and CompactFlash card readers.
Chapter 14: Learning Portable Computing
483
Be sure to remove all thumb
drives and PC Cards before ship-
ping a laptop.
• Figure 14.23
PC Card

You can also find PC Cards that enable you to plug into multiple types of
networks. All PC Cards are hot-swappable, meaning you can plug them in
without powering down the PC.
PCMCIA has established two versions of PC Cards, one using a parallel
bus and the other using a serial bus. Each version, in turn, offers two tech-
nology variations as well as several physical varieties. This might sound
complicated at first, but here’s the map to sort it all out.
Parallel PC Cards
Parallel PC Cards come in two flavors, 16-bit and CardBus, and each flavor
comes in three physical sizes, called Type I, Type II, and Type III. The 16-
bit PC Cards, as the name suggests, are 16-bit, 5-V cards that can have up to
two distinct functions or devices, such as a modem/network card combi-
nation. CardBus PC Cards are 32-bit, 3.3-V cards that can have up to eight
(!) functions on a single card. Regular PC Cards fit into and work in
CardBus slots, but the reverse is not true. CardBus totally dominates the
current PC Card landscape, but you might still run into older 16-bit PC
Cards.
Type I, II, and III cards differ only in the thickness of the
card (Type I being the thinnest, and Type III the thickest).
All PC Cards share the same 68-pin interface, so any PC
Card will work in any slot that accepts that card type. Type II
cards are by far the most common of PC Cards. Therefore,
most laptops have two Type II slots, one above the other,
so the computer can accept two Type I or II cards or one
Type III card (Figure 14.24).
Although PCMCIA doesn’t require that certain sizes per-
form certain functions, most PC Cards follow their recommen-
dations. Table 14.3 lists the sizes and typical uses of each type
of PC Card.
ExpressCard
ExpressCard, the high-performance serial version of the PC Card, has begun
to replace PC Card slots on newer laptop PCs. Although ExpressCard offers
significant performance benefits, keep in mind that ExpressCard and PC
Cards are incompatible. You cannot use your PC Card in your new laptop’s
ExpressCard socket. The PC Card has had a remarkably long life in portable
PCs, and you can still find it on some new laptops, but get ready to replace
all of your PC Card devices. ExpressCard comes in two widths: 54 mm and
34 mm. Figure 14.25 shows a 34-mm and a 54-mm ExpressCard. Both cards
are 75 mm long and 5 mm thick, which makes them shorter than all previous
PC Cards and the same thickness as a Type II PC Card.
484
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Many manufacturers use the
term hot-pluggable rather than
hot-swappable to describe the
ability to plug in and replace PC
Cards on the fly. Look for either
term on the CompTIA A+ Essen-
tials exam.
CompTIA uses the older term
PCMCIA cards to describe PC
Cards. Don’t be shocked if you
get that as an option on your
exams! You’ll hear many techs
use the phrase as well, though
the PCMCIA trade group has
not used it for many years.

PC Card Types and Their Typical Uses

ExpressCards connect to either the Hi-Speed USB 2.0 bus or a PCI Ex-
press bus. These differ phenomenally in speed. The amazingly slow-in-
comparison USB version has a maximum throughput of 480 Mbps. The PCIe
version, in contrast, roars in at 2.5 Gbps in unidirectional communication.
Very nice!
Table 14.4 shows the throughput and variations for the parallel and serial
PC Cards currently or soon to be on the market.
Software Support for PC Cards
The PCMCIA standard defines two levels of software drivers to support PC
Cards. The first and lower level is known as socket services. Socket services
are device drivers that support the PC Card socket, enabling the system to
detect when a PC Card has been inserted or removed, and providing the
necessary I/O to the device. The second and higher level is known as card
services. The card services level recognizes the function of a particular PC
Card and provides the specialized drivers necessary to make the card work.
In today’s laptops, the socket services are standardized and are handled
by the system BIOS. Windows itself handles all card services and has a large
preinstalled base of PC Card device drivers, although most PC Cards come
with their own drivers.

Tech Tip
Keeping Your PC
Cards Healthy
PC Cards typically come with a
hard plastic storage case. Always
be sure to use this case to store the
cards when you’re not using them.
If dust, dirt, or grime gets into the
array of contacts at the end of the
card, the card won’t work when
you try to use it next. Also, be
careful when using PC Cards that
extend out of the PC Card slot
past the edge of your laptop. One
dark night I set my laptop on the
floor with a PC Card NIC sticking
out of it while I went to get a drink
of water. On my way back, I acci-
dentally stepped on the card stick-
ing out of my laptop and nearly
snapped it in half. Luckily, my
laptop wasn’t damaged, but the
card was toast!

PC Card Speeds
ExpressCards don’t require
either socket or card services, at
least not in the way PC Cards do.
The ExpressCard modules auto-
matically configure the software
on your computer, which makes
them truly plug and play.

Mobile NICs and Mini PCI
Every laptop made in the past few years comes with networking capabilities
built in. They have Ethernet ports for plugging into a wired network and
Wi-Fi for wireless networking, and some have Cellular WAN radios so you
can access the Internet over a cell phone network. Laptops run Windows just
like a desktop system, so they have all the networking software ready to go.
Many of these integrated network cards are installed in a Mini PCI slot
on the laptop motherboard. The Mini PCI bus is an adaptation of the stan-
dard PCI bus and was developed specifically for integrated communica-
tions peripherals such as modems and network adapters. Built-in
networking support means you don’t need an additional PC Card to pro-
vide a network adapter. The Mini PCI bus also provides support for other
integrated devices, such as Bluetooth, modems, audio, or hard drive con-
trollers. One great aspect of Mini PCI is that if some new technology eclipses
the current wireless technology or some other technology that uses the bus,
you can upgrade by swapping a card.
Officially released in 1999, Mini PCI is a 32-bit, 33-MHz bus and is basi-
cally PCI v2.2 with a different form factor. Like PCI, it supports bus master-
ing and DMA. Mini PCI cards are about a quarter the size of regular PCI
cards and can be as small as 2.75 inches by 1.81 inches by .22 inch. They can
be found in small products such as laptops, printers, and set-top boxes.
To extend battery life, you can toggle built-in communication devices
such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters on and off without powering down
the computer. Many laptops come with a physical switch along the front or
side edge to allow you to power the communications adapter on or off. Simi-
larly, you can often use a keyboard shortcut for this, generally by pressing
the Function (FN) key along with some other key. The FN key, when pressed,
allows other keys to accomplish specific tasks. For example, on my laptop,
pressing FN-F2 toggles my Wi-Fi adapter on and off; pressing FN-F10 ejects
my CD-ROM drive.
■Troubleshooting Portable
Computers
Many of the troubleshooting techniques you learned about for desktop sys-
tems can be applied to laptops. For example, take the proper precautions be-
fore and during disassembly. Use the proper hand tools, and document,
label, and organize each plastic part and screw location for reassembly. Ad-
ditionally, here are some laptop-specific procedures to try.
Laptop Won’t Power On
■
Verify AC power by plugging another electronic device into the wall
outlet. If the other device receives power, the outlet is good.
■
If the outlet is good, connect the laptop to the wall outlet and try to
power on. If no LEDs light up, you may have a bad AC adapter.
Swap it out with a known-good power adapter.
486
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
See Chapter 16, “Learning
Local Area Networking,” for the
scoop on dial-up networking and
Ethernet.
A typical reason to upgrade
a Mini PCI Wi-Fi NIC is to gain
access to improved security
options such as better encryption.

■
A faulty peripheral device might keep the laptop from powering up.
Remove any peripherals such as USB or FireWire devices.
Screen Doesn’t Come On Properly
■
If the laptop is booting (you hear the beeps and the drives), first
make sure the display is turned on. Press the FN key and the key to
activate the screen a number of times until the laptop display comes
on. If that doesn’t work, check the LCD cutoff switch—on many
laptops, this is the small nub somewhere near the screen hinge that
shuts the monitor off when you close the laptop—and make sure it
isn’t stuck in the down position.
■
If the laptop display is very dim, you may have lost an inverter. The
clue here is that inverters never go quietly. They can make a nasty
hum as they are about to die and an equally nasty popping noise
when they actually fail. Failure often occurs when you plug in the
laptop’s AC adapter, as the inverters take power directly from the
AC adapter. It’s also possible that the backlights in the LCD panel
have died, though this is much less common than a bad inverter.
■
If the screen won’t come on or is cracked, most laptops have a port
for plugging in an external monitor, which you can use to log into
your laptop.
Wireless Networking Doesn’t Work
■
Check along the front, rear, or side edges of the laptop for a physical
switch that toggles the internal wireless adapter on and off.
■
Try the special key combination for your laptop to toggle the wireless
adapter. You usually press the FN key in combination with another key.
■
You might simply be out of range. Physically walk the laptop over to
the wireless router or access point to ensure there are no out-of-range
issues.
Handwriting Is Not Recognized
■
If your PDA or tablet PC no longer recognizes your handwriting or
stylus, you may need to retrain the digitizer. Look for an option in
your PDA OS settings to align the screen. On Windows-based tablet
PCs, you will find a similar option under Start | Settings | Control
Panel.
Keypad Doesn’t Work
■
If none of the keys work on your laptop, there’s a good chance
you’ve unseated the keypad connector. These connectors are quite
fragile and are prone to unseating from any physical stress on the
laptop. Check the manufacturer’s disassembly procedures to locate
and reseat the keypad.
■
If you’re getting numbers when you’re expecting to get letters, the
number lock (NUMLOCK) function key is turned on. Turn it off.

Tech Tip
Battery Won’t Charge
If you have a laptop with a bat-
tery that won’t charge up, it
could be one of two things: the
battery might be cooked or the AC
adapter isn’t doing its job. To
troubleshoot, replace the battery
with a known-good battery. If the
new battery works, you’ve found
the problem. Just replace the bat-
tery. Alternatively, remove the
battery and run the laptop on AC
only. If that works, you know the
AC adapter is good. If it doesn’t,
replace the AC adapter.

Touchpad Doesn’t Work
■
A shot of compressed air does wonders for cleaning pet hair out of
the touchpad sensors. You’ll get a cleaner shot if you remove the
keyboard before using the compressed air. Remember to be gentle
when lifting off the keyboard and make sure to follow the
manufacturer’s instructions.
■
The touchpad driver might need to be reconfigured. Try the various
options in the Control Panel | Mouse applet.

Chapter 14 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises,
you should understand the following about portable
computers.
Describe the many types of portable
computing devices available
■
All portable devices share certain features: video
output using LCD screens, some kind of PC sound,
and DC battery power. There’s no industry standard
for naming the vast majority of styles of portable
computing devices.
■
A laptop refers in general to the clamshell,
keyboard-on-the-bottom and LCD-screen-at-the-
top design that is considered the shape of mobile
PCs. Most notebooks are laptops in the 8½ × 11–inch
range. The traditional clamshell laptop computer
features a built-in LCD monitor, keyboard, and
input device and functions as a fully standalone
PC. A portable PC can be considered a desktop
replacement if it does everything most people
want to do with a desktop PC.
■
Desktop extender portable devices don’t replace
the desktop but rather extend it by giving you a
subset of features that you can take away from the
desk. They are usually smaller and lighter than
desktop replacement portables. Netbook portables
(sometimes called subnotebooks, though the terms
aren’t necessarily synonymous) normally weigh
less than three pounds and are less than an inch in
thickness. These machines usually have smaller
displays, lower-capacity hard drives, and CPUs
that operate at lower speeds than their more full-
sized brethren.
■
Personal digital assistants (PDAs) are tiny handheld
portable computing devices that hold such data
as your address book and appointment schedules.
Small enough to fit into a pocket, today’s PDAs are
pen-based computers, using a pen-like stylus and
handwriting recognition. PDAs require specialized
OSes such as Windows Mobile, PocketPC, PalmOS,
or Linux. All of these OSes provide a GUI that
enables you to interact with the device by touching
the screen directly. PDAs synchronize with your PC,
most often by using a cradle and USB port, so you
have the same essential data on both machines.
■
Over the years, input devices for portables have
ranged from trackballs that clipped to the case or
were built in near the keyboard, to IBM’s
TrackPoint pencil eraser–sized joystick embedded
in the keyboard. The most common laptop
pointing device found today, the touchpad, is a
flat, touch-sensitive pad that you slide your finger
across to move the cursor or pointer around the
screen, and tap on to perform “mouse clicks.”
Manage and maintain portable computers
■
Portable computers use three types of batteries:
Nickel-Cadmium (Ni-Cd), Nickel-Metal Hydride
(Ni-MH), and Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion).
■
The first batteries used in mobile PCs were Nickel-
Cadmium (Ni-Cd). If a Ni-Cd battery was not
completely discharged before each recharge, it lost
a significant amount of its rechargeability, a
condition referred to as battery memory. At best,
Ni-Cd batteries would last for 1000 charges, but
they were very susceptible to heat. Because of the
toxic metals inside these batteries, they had to be
disposed of via specialty disposal companies.
Although no longer used in PCs, Ni-Cd batteries
are still found in cellular and cordless phones.
■
The second generation of mobile PC batteries,
the Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries are
less susceptible to memory problems, tolerate
overcharging better, take more recharging, and
last longer between rechargings, but they are still
susceptible to heat.
■
Although some portable PCs still use Ni-MH
batteries, Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) is more common
today. This third-generation battery takes fewer
charges than Ni-MH, but it lasts longer between
charges. Because Li-Ion batteries can explode if
they are overcharged, they have circuitry to
prevent overcharging.
■
A new type battery called the smart battery
tells the computer when it needs to be charged,
conditioned, or replaced.
■
Batteries should be stored in a cool place, but not
in the freezer because of moisture, metal racks,
and food. Condition Ni-Cd and Ni-MH batteries to
Chapter 14: Learning Portable Computing
489

make them last longer. You can clean battery
contacts with alcohol or a dry cloth. Because
batteries contain dangerous chemicals, never
handle one that has ruptured. Always recycle old
batteries rather than disposing of them in the trash.
■
The process of cooperation among the hardware,
the BIOS, and the OS to reduce power use is known
generically as power management. Early laptops
used power continuously, regardless of whether
the system was being used at the time. With
power management features, today’s laptops can
automatically turn off unused devices or can shut
down the entire system, leaving the information
in RAM ready for a restart. Performing these
power management functions requires specialized
hardware, BIOS, and an operating system that
supports power management.
■
Starting with the 386SX, Intel introduced System
Management Mode (SMM), a power management
system that would make the CPU and all peripherals
go to “sleep.” In 1992, Intel introduced the improved
Advanced Power Management (APM) specification,
followed by the Advanced Configuration and Power
Interface (ACPI) standard in 1996.
■
To use APM or ACPI, the computer must have an
SMM-capable CPU, an APM-compliant BIOS, and
devices that can be shut off. Referred to as Energy
Star devices, these peripherals can shut down
without actually turning off. The OS must also
know how to request that a particular device be
shut down. ACPI extends power-saving to include
hot-swappable devices.
■
Virtually all laptops and desktops use power
management functions. APM defines four power-
usage levels, including Full On, APM Enabled,
APM Standby, and APM Suspend. ACPI, the
successor to APM, handles all these levels plus a
few more, totaling four Global (G) and seven total
(S) states. Support for APM has been discontinued
in Windows Vista, which uses ACPI.
■
Configure APM/ACPI through CMOS or through
the Power Options Control Panel applet in Windows
2000/XP/Vista, with Windows settings overriding
CMOS settings. Many CMOS versions allow
configuration of wake-up events, such as having
the system monitor a modem or particular IRQ.
■
Hibernation writes information from RAM to the
hard drive. Upon waking up, the data is returned
to RAM, and programs and files are in the same
state they were in when the computer entered
hibernation.
■
Use an appropriate screen cleaner (not glass
cleaner) to clean the LCD screen. Use compressed
air around the keyboard and PC Card sockets.
Never use water around the keyboard.
■
To combat the inevitable heat produced by a
portable computer, always use power management,
keep an air space between the bottom of the laptop
and the surface on which it rests, don’t use a
keyboard protector for an extended period of time,
and be aware of your fan.
■
Store your portable computer in a quality case
when traveling. Laptops benefit from a cushy
carrying case, while hard aluminum cases keep
your PDA from getting banged up. Well-padded
backpacks not only keep your laptop protected but
also make your system less conspicuous to would-
be thieves. When traveling, don’t forget accessories
such as AC power cords, additional batteries, or
modular devices. Remove all discs from drives and
make sure you have enough battery power to boot
up for security personnel. If shipping your computer,
go with a reputable carrier, keep your tracking
number, and request a delivery signature. Use a
laptop lock or a software tracking system to protect
your laptop when traveling.
■
PC Cards are roughly credit-card-sized devices
that enhance and extend the functions of a portable
PC. Still commonly known by their older name,
PCMCIA cards, PC Cards are as standard on today’s
mobile computers as the hard drive. Almost every
portable PC has one or two PC Card slots. All PC
Cards are hot-swappable.
■
Parallel PC Cards come in two flavors, 16-bit and
CardBus; and each flavor comes in three different
physical sizes, called Type I, Type II, and Type III.
Type I, II, and III cards differ only in the thickness
of the card (Type I being the thinnest and Type III
the thickest). Type II cards are by far the most
common. All parallel PC Cards share the same 68-pin
interface. The 16-bit PC Cards are 16-bit, 5-V cards
that can have up to two distinct functions or devices,
such as a modem/network card combination.
CardBus PC Cards are 32-bit, 3.3-V cards that can
have up to eight different functions on a single
card. The 16-bit PC Cards will fit into and work in
CardBus slots, but the reverse is not true.
490
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

■
The serial ExpressCard comes in two widths: 54 mm
and 34 mm. Both cards are 75 mm long and 5 mm
thick, which makes them shorter than all previous
PC Cards and the same thickness as a Type II PC
Card. ExpressCards connect to either the Hi-Speed
USB 2.0 bus (480 Mbps) or a PCI Express bus
(2.5 Gbps).
■
The PCMCIA standard defines two levels of
software drivers to support PC Cards. The first and
lower level is known as socket services. Socket
services are device drivers that support the PC
Card socket, enabling the system to detect when
a PC Card has been inserted or removed and
providing the necessary I/O to the device. The
second and higher level is known as card services.
The card-services level recognizes the function of a
particular PC Card and provides the specialized
drivers necessary to make the card work. In today’s
laptops, the socket services are standardized and
are handled by the system BIOS. Windows itself
handles all card services and has a large preinstalled
base of PC Card device drivers, although most PC
Cards come with their own drivers.
■
Most laptops now come with integrated wireless
networking support by way of a built-in Wi-Fi
adapter usually installed in a Mini PCI slot on the
laptop motherboard. The Mini PCI bus is an
adaptation of the standard PCI bus and was
developed specifically for integrated communications
peripherals such as modems and network adapters.
To extend battery life, built-in communication
devices such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth adapters can
be toggled on and off without powering down the
computer.
Troubleshoot portable computers
■
If your laptop won’t power on, try a different wall
outlet. If it still fails to power up, remove all
peripheral devices and try again.
■
If the screen doesn’t come on properly, verify that
the laptop is configured to use the built-in LCD
screen by pressing the appropriate key to cycle
through the internal and external monitors. If you
hear a popping sound, you may have blown an
inverter. If the screen is definitely broken, you may
use an external monitor to access the laptop.
■
If wireless networking is not working, check for the
physical switch on the side of the laptop that
toggles power to the internal network card. If your
laptop doesn’t have a switch, check for a key
combination or function key that toggles power.
You also may be out of range. Physically walk the
laptop closer to the wireless router or access point.
■
If your PDA or tablet PC fails to recognize
handwriting, retrain the digitizer. PDAs often have
a setting to “align the screen,” while tablet PC
users can check the Control Panel for the
appropriate applet.
■
If the keypad or touchpad doesn’t work, try a shot
of compressed air, reseat the physical internal
connection, or reconfigure the driver settings through
the Control Panel Keyboard or Mouse applets.

D
espite all of the talk about the “paperless office,” printers continue to be a
vital part of the typical office. In many cases, PCs are used exclusively for
the purpose of producing paper documents. Many people simply prefer dealing
with a hard copy. Programmers cater to this preference by using metaphors such
as page, workbook, and binder in their applications. The CompTIA A+ certification
strongly stresses the area of printing and expects a high degree of technical
knowledge of the function, components, maintenance, and repair of all types of
printers.

■Printer Technologies
No other piece of your computer system is available in a wider range of
styles, configurations, and feature sets than a printer, or at such a wide price
variation. What a printer can and can’t do is largely determined by the type
of printer technology it uses—that is, how it gets the image onto the paper.
Modern printers can be categorized into several broad types: impact, inkjet,
dye-sublimation, thermal, laser, and solid ink.
Impact Printers
Printers that create an image on paper by physically striking an ink ribbon
against the paper’s surface are known as impact printers. Even though daisy-
wheel printers (essentially an electric typewriter attached to the PC instead of
directly to a keyboard) have largely disappeared, their cousins, dot-matrix
printers, still soldier on in many offices. Although dot-matrix printers don’t
deliver what most home users want—high-quality and flexibility at a low
cost—they’re still widely found in businesses for two reasons: dot-matrix
printers have a large installed base, and they can be used for multipart forms
because they actually strike the paper. Impact printers tend to be relatively
slow and noisy, but when speed, flexibility, and print quality are not critical,
they provide acceptable results. PCs used for printing multipart forms, such
as point of sale (POS) machines that need to print receipts in duplicate, tripli-
cate, or more, represent the major market for new impact printers, although
many older dot-matrix printers remain in use.
Dot-matrix printers use a grid, or matrix, of tiny pins, also
known as printwires, to strike an inked printer ribbon and produce
images on paper (Figure 15.1). The case that holds the printwires is
called a printhead. Using either 9 or 24 pins, dot-matrix printers treat
each page as a picture broken up into a dot-based raster image. The
9-pin dot-matrix printers are generically called draft quality, while
the 24-pin printers are known as letter quality or near-letter quality
(NLQ). The BIOS for the printer (either built into the printer or a
printer driver) interprets the raster image in the same way a monitor
does, “painting” the image as individual dots. Naturally, the more
pins, the higher the resolution. Figure 15.2 illustrates the components
common to dot-matrix printers. Many dot-matrix printers use contin-
uous-feed paper with holes on its sides that are engaged by metal
sprockets to pull the paper through—this is known as tractor-feed paper
because the sprockets are reminiscent of the wheels on a tractor.
Inkjet Printers
Inkjet printers (also called ink-dispersion printers), like the one shown in
Figure 15.3, are relatively simple devices consisting of a printhead mecha-
nism, support electronics, a transfer mechanism to move the printhead
back and forth, and a paper feed component to drag, move, and eject paper

that literally boil the ink; this creates a tiny air bubble that
ejects a droplet of ink onto the paper, thus creating a portion of
the image (Figure 15.5).
The ink is stored in special small containers called ink car-
tridges. Older inkjet printers had two cartridges: one for black
ink and another for colored ink. The color cartridge had sepa-
rate compartments for cyan (blue), magenta (red), and yellow
ink, to print colors by using a method known as CMYK (you’ll
read more about CMYK later in this chapter). If your color car-
tridge ran out of one of the colors, you had to purchase a whole
new color cartridge or deal with a messy refill kit.
Printer manufacturers began to separate the ink colors into
three separate cartridges so that printers came with four car-
tridges: one for each color and a fourth for black (Figure 15.6).
This not only was more cost-effective for the user, but also re-
sulted in higher quality printouts. Today you can find color inkjet
printers with six, eight, or more color cartridges. In addition to
the basic CMYK inks, the other cartridges provide for green, blue,

gray, light cyan, dark cyan, and more.
Typically, the more ink cartridges a printer
uses, the higher the quality of the printed im-
age—and the higher the cost of the printer.
The two key features of an inkjet
printer are the print resolution—that is, the
density of ink, which affects print quality—
and the print speed. Resolution is mea-
sured in dots per inch (dpi); higher numbers
mean that the ink dots on the page are
closer together, so your printed documents
will look better. Resolution is most impor-
tant when you’re printing complex images
such as full-color photos, or when you’re
printing for duplication and you care that
your printouts look good. Print speed is
measured in pages per minute (ppm), and
this specification is normally indicated
right on the printer’s box. Most printers
have one (faster) speed for monochrome
printing—that is, using only black ink—
and another for full-color printing.
Chapter 15: Learning Printing

Inkjet ink cartridges

Another feature of inkjet printers is that they can support a staggering
array of print media. Using an inkjet printer, you can print on a variety of
matte or glossy photo papers, iron-on transfers, and other specialty media;
some printers can print directly onto specially coated optical discs, or even
fabric. Imagine running a T-shirt through your printer with your own cus-
tom slogan (how about “I’m CompTIA A+ Certified!”). The inks have im-
proved over the years, too, now delivering better quality and longevity than
ever. Where older inks would smudge if the paper got wet or start to fade af-
ter a short time, modern inks are smudge proof and of archival quality—for
example, some inks by Epson are projected to last up to 200 years.
Dye-Sublimation
Printers
The term sublimation means to
cause something to change from a
solid form into a vapor and then
back into a solid. This is exactly
the process behind dye-sublimation
printing, sometimes called thermal
dye transfer printing. Dye-sublima-
tion printers are used mainly for
photo printing, high-end desktop
publishing, medical and scientific
imaging, and other applications
for which fine detail and rich color
are more important than cost and
speed. Smaller, specialized print-
ers called snapshot printers use dye sublimation specifically for printing
photos at a reduced cost compared to their full-sized counterparts.
The dye-sublimation printing technique is an example of the so-called
CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) method of color printing. It uses a roll
of heat-sensitive plastic film embedded with page-sized sections of cyan
(blue), magenta (red), and yellow dye; many also have a sec-
tion of black dye. A printhead containing thousands of heat-
ing elements, capable of precise temperature control, moves
across the film, vaporizing the dyes and causing them to
soak into specially coated paper underneath before cooling
and reverting to a solid form. This process requires one pass
per page for each color. Some printers also use a final finishing
pass that applies a protective laminate coating to the page.
Figure 15.7 shows how a dye-sublimation printer works.
Documents printed through the dye-sublimation process
display continuous-tone images, meaning that the printed im-
age is not constructed of pixel dots but a continuous blend of
overlaid differing dye colors. This is in contrast to other print
technologies’ dithered images, which use closely packed,
single-color dots to simulate blended colors. Dye-sublima-
tion printers produce high-quality color output that rivals
professional photo lab processing.

Thermal Printers
Thermal printers use a heated printhead to create a high-quality image on
special or plain paper. You’ll see two kinds of thermal printers in use. The
first is the direct thermal printer, and the other is the thermal wax transfer
printer. Direct thermal printers burn dots into the surface of special heat-
sensitive paper. If you remember the first generation of fax machines, you’re
already familiar with this type of printer. Many retail businesses still use it
as a receipt printer. Thermal wax printers work similarly to dye-sublimation
printers, except that instead of using rolls of dye-embedded film, the film is
coated with colored wax. The thermal printhead passes over the film ribbon
and melts the wax onto the paper. Thermal wax printers don’t require spe-
cial papers like dye-sublimation printers, so they’re more flexible and some-
what cheaper to use, but their output isn’t quite as good because they use
color dithering.
Laser Printers
Using a process called electro-photographic imaging, laser printers produce
high-quality and high-speed output of both text and graphics. Figure 15.8
shows a typical laser printer. Laser printers rely on the photoconductive
properties of certain organic compounds. Photoconductive means that parti-
cles of these compounds, when exposed to light (that’s the “photo” part),
will conduct electricity. Laser printers usually use lasers as a light source be-
cause of their precision. Some lower-cost printers use LED arrays instead.
The first laser printers created only monochrome images. Today, you
can also buy a color laser printer, although the vast majority of laser printers
produced today are still monochrome. Although a color laser printer can
produce complex full-color images such as photographs, they really shine
for printing what’s known as spot color—for example, eye-catching head-
ings, lines, charts, or other graphical elements that dress up an otherwise
plain printed presentation.
Critical Components of the Laser Printer
The CompTIA A+ Essentials exam takes a keen interest in the particulars of
the laser printing process, so it pays to know your way around a laser
printer. Let’s take a look at the many components of laser printers and their
functions (Figure 15.9).
Toner Cartridge
The toner cartridge in a laser printer is so named because
of its most obvious activity: supplying the toner that creates the image on
the page (Figure 15.10). To reduce maintenance costs, however, many other
laser printer parts, especially those that suffer the most wear and tear, have
been incorporated into the toner cartridge. Although this makes replace-
ment of individual parts nearly impossible, it greatly reduces the need for
replacement; those parts that are most likely to break are replaced every
time you replace the toner cartridge.
Photosensitive Drum
The photosensitive drum is an aluminum cylinder
coated with particles of photosensitive compounds. The drum itself is
grounded to the power supply, but the coating is not. When light hits these

Tech Tip
Hidden Costs
Some printers use consumables—
such as ink—at a much faster
rate than others, prompting the
industry to rank printers in
terms of their cost per page.
Using an inexpensive printer (la-
ser or inkjet) costs around 4 cents
per page, while an expensive
printer can cost more than 20
cents per page—a huge difference
if you do any volume of printing.
This hidden cost is particularly
pernicious in the sub-$100 inkjet
printers on the market. Their low
prices often entice buyers, who
then discover that the cost of
consumables is outrageous—
these days, a single set of color
and black inkjet cartridges can
cost as much as the printer itself,
if not more!

particles, whatever electrical charge they may have “drains”
out through the grounded cylinder.
Erase Lamp
The erase lamp exposes the entire surface of the
photosensitive drum to light, making the photosensitive coat-
ing conductive. Any electrical charge present in the particles
bleeds away into the grounded drum, leaving the surface par-
ticles electrically neutral.
Primary Corona
The primary corona wire, located close to the
photosensitive drum, never touches the drum. When the pri-
mary corona is charged with an extremely high voltage, an
electric field (or corona) forms, enabling voltage to pass to the
drum and charge the photosensitive particles on its surface. The primary grid
regulates the transfer of voltage, ensuring that the surface of the drum re-
ceives a uniform negative voltage of between ~600 and ~1000 volts (V).
Laser
The laser acts as the writing mechanism of the printer. Any particle
on the drum struck by the laser becomes conductive and its charge is
drained away into the grounded core of the drum. The entire surface of the
drum has a uniform negative charge of between ~600 and ~1000 V following
its charging by the primary corona wire. When particles are struck by the la-
ser, they are discharged and left with a ~100-V negative charge. Using the la-
ser, we can “write” an image onto the drum. Note that the laser writes a
positive image to the drum.
Toner
The toner in a laser printer is a fine powder made up of plastic parti-
cles bonded to iron particles. The toner cylinder charges the toner with a neg-
ative charge of between ~200 and ~500 V. Because that charge falls between
the original uniform negative charge of the photosensitive drum (~600 to
~1000 V) and the charge of the particles on the drum’s surface hit by the la-
ser (~100 V), particles of toner are attracted to the areas of the photosensitive
drum that have been hit by the laser (that is, areas that have a relatively posi-
tive charge with reference to the toner particles).
500
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 15.9
Components inside a laser printer
• Figure 15.10
Laser printer’s toner cartridge
Color laser printers have four
toner cartridges: black, cyan,
magenta, and yellow.
The toner used in laser print-
ers is typically carbon melt
mixed with a polyester resin.

Transfer Corona
To transfer the image from the photosensitive drum to the
paper, the paper must be given a charge that will attract the toner particles
off of the drum and onto the paper. The transfer corona is a thin wire, usually
protected by other thin wires, that applies a positive charge to the paper,
drawing the negatively charged toner particles to the paper. The paper, with
its positive charge, is also attracted to the negatively charged drum. To pre-
vent the paper from wrapping around the drum, a static charge eliminator
removes the charge from the paper.
In most laser printers, the transfer corona is outside the toner cartridge,
especially in large, commercial-grade machines. The transfer corona is
prone to a build-up of dirt, toner, and debris through electrostatic attraction,
and it must be cleaned. It is also quite fragile—usually finer than a human
hair. Most printers with an exposed transfer corona provide a special tool
to clean it, but you can also—very delicately—use a cotton swab soaked in
90 percent denatured alcohol (don’t use rubbing alcohol because it contains
emollients). As always, never service any printer without first turning it off
and unplugging it from its power source.
Fuser Assembly
The fuser assembly is almost always separate from the
toner cartridge. It is usually quite easy to locate as it is close to the bottom of
the toner cartridge and usually has two rollers to fuse the toner. Sometimes
the fuser is somewhat enclosed and difficult to recognize because the rollers
are hidden from view. To help you determine the location of the fuser, think
about the data path of the paper and the fact that fusing is the final step of
printing.
The toner is merely resting on top of the paper after the static charge
eliminator has removed the paper’s static charge. The toner must be perma-
nently attached to the paper to make the image permanent. Two rollers, a
pressure roller and a heated roller, are used to fuse the toner to the paper.
The pressure roller presses against the bottom of the page, and the heated
roller presses down on the top of the page, melting the toner into the paper.
The heated roller has a nonstick coating such as Teflon to prevent the toner
from sticking to the heated roller.
Power Supplies
All laser printers have at least two separate power
supplies. The first power supply is called the primary power supply, or some-
times just the power supply. This power supply, which may actually be
more than one power supply,
provides power to the motors that
move the paper, the system elec-
tronics, the laser, and the transfer
corona. The high-voltage power
supply usually provides power
only to the primary corona. The
extremely high voltage of the
high-voltage power supply makes
it one of the most dangerous de-
vices in the world of PCs! Before
opening a printer to insert a new
toner cartridge, it is imperative
that you always turn off a laser
printer!

Cross Check
High Voltage—Keep Away!
The power supply inside a laser printer is not the only dangerous high-
voltage toy in the world of PC equipment. You’ve learned about two
other potentially hazardous electrical components that you should ap-
proach with caution.
1.
What are they?
2.
Which of these three items is potentially the most deadly?
To refresh your memory, check out Chapter 8, “Learning PC
Power,” and Chapter 13, “Learning Video and Multimedia.”

Turning Gears
A laser printer has many mechanical functions. First, the
paper must be picked up. Next, the photosensitive roller must be turned and
the laser, or a mirror, must be moved from left to right. The toner must be
evenly distributed, and the fuser assembly must squish the toner into the
paper. Finally, the paper must be kicked out of the printer and the assembly
cleaned to prepare for the next page.
All of these functions are served by complex gear systems. In most laser
printers, these gear systems are packed together in discrete units generically
called gear packs or gearboxes. Most laser printers have two or three gearboxes
that you can remove relatively easily in the rare case when one of them fails.
Most gearboxes also have their own motor or solenoid to move the gears.
System Board
Every laser printer contains at least one electronic board. On
this board is the main processor, the printer’s ROM, and the RAM used to
store the image before it is printed. Many printers divide these functions
among two or three boards dispersed around the printer. An older printer
may also have an extra ROM chip and/or a special slot where you can install
an extra ROM chip, usually for special functions such as PostScript.
On some printer models you can upgrade the contents of these ROM
chips (the firmware) by performing a process called flashing the ROM.
Flashing is a lot like upgrading the system BIOS, which you learned about in
Chapter 7, “Learning Motherboards.” Upgrading the firmware can help fix
bugs, add new features, or update the fonts in the printer.
Of particular importance is the printer’s RAM. When the printer doesn’t
have enough RAM to store the image before it prints, you get a memory
overflow problem. Also, some printers store other information in the RAM,
including fonts or special commands. Adding RAM is usually a simple
job—just snapping in a SIMM or DIMM stick or two—but getting the right
RAM is important. Call or check the printer manufacturer’s Web site to see
what type of RAM you need. Although most printer companies will happily
sell you their expensive RAM, most printers can use generic DRAM like the
kind you use in a PC.
Ozone Filter
The coronas inside laser printers generate ozone (O3). Al-
though not harmful to humans in small amounts, even tiny concentrations
of ozone will cause damage to printer components. To counter this problem,
most laser printers have a special ozone filter that needs to be vacuumed or
replaced periodically.
Sensors and Switches
Every laser printer has a large number of sensors
and switches spread throughout the machine. The sensors are used to detect
a broad range of conditions such as paper jams, empty paper trays, or low
toner levels. Many of these sensors are really tiny switches that detect open
doors and so on. Most of the time these sensors/switches work reliably, yet
occasionally they become dirty or broken, sending a false signal to the
printer. Simple inspection is usually sufficient to determine if a problem is
real or just the result of a faulty sensor/switch.
Solid Ink
Solid ink printers use just what you’d expect—solid inks. The technology
was originally developed by Tektronix, whose printer division was ac-
quired by Xerox. Solid ink printers use solid sticks of nontoxic “ink” that
502
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

produce more vibrant color than other print methods. The solid ink is
melted and absorbed into the paper fibers; it then solidifies, producing a
continuous-tone output. Unlike dye-sublimation printers, all colors are ap-
plied to the media in a single pass, reducing the chances of misalignment.
Solid ink sticks do not rely on containers like ink for inkjet printers and can
be “topped off” midway through a print job by inserting additional color
sticks without taking the printer offline.
These printers are fast, too! A full-color print job outputs the first page in
about six seconds. Of course, all that speed and quality comes at a price.
Xerox’s base model starts at about twice the cost of a laser printer, with the
expensive model selling for about six times the cost! Solid ink printers be-
come a bit more affordable when you factor in the cost of consumables. A
single stick of ink costs about as much as an inkjet cartridge, for example,
but with a print capacity of 1000 pages, that completely beats the cost of
inkjet cartridges over time.
Printer Languages
Now that you’ve learned about the different types of print devices and tech-
niques, it’s time to take a look at how they communicate with the PC. How
do you tell a printer to make a letter A or to print a picture of your pet
iguana? Printers are designed to accept predefined printer languages that
handle both characters and graphics. Your software must use the proper
language when communicating with your printer, so that your printer can
output your documents onto a piece of paper. Following are the more com-
mon printer languages.
ASCII
You might think of the American Standard Code for Information Interchange
(ASCII) language as nothing more than a standard set of characters, the basic
alphabet in upper- and lowercase with a few strange symbols thrown in.
ASCII actually contains a variety of control codes for transferring data, some
of which can be used to control printers. For example, ASCII code 10 (or 0A
in hex) means “Line Feed,” and ASCII code 12 (0C) means “Form Feed.”
These commands have been standard since before the creation of IBM PCs,
and all printers respond to them. If they did not, the PRT SCR (print screen)
key would not work with every printer. Being highly standardized has ad-
vantages, but the control codes are extremely limited. Printing high-end
graphics and a wide variety of fonts requires more advanced languages.
PostScript
Adobe Systems developed the PostScript page description language in the early
1980s as a device-independent printer language capable of high-resolution
graphics and scalable fonts. PostScript interpreters are embedded in the
printing device. Because PostScript is understood by printers at a hardware
level, the majority of the image processing is done by the printer and not the
PC’s CPU, so PostScript printers print faster. PostScript defines the page as a
single raster image; this makes PostScript files extremely portable—they can
be created on one machine or platform and reliably printed out on another
machine or platform (including, for example, high-end typesetters).
Chapter 15: Learning Printing
503

Hewlett-Packard Printer Control Language (PCL)
Hewlett-Packard developed its printer control language (PCL) as a more ad-
vanced printer language to supersede simple ASCII codes. PCL features a
set of printer commands greatly expanded from ASCII. Hewlett-Packard
designed PCL with text-based output in mind; it does not support advanced
graphical functions. The most recent version of PCL, PCL6, features scalable
fonts and additional line-drawing commands. Unlike PostScript, however,
PCL is not a true page description language; it uses a series of commands to
define the characters on the page. Those commands must be supported by
each individual printer model, making PCL files less portable than Post-
Script files.
Windows GDI and XPS
Windows 2000/XP use the graphical device interface (GDI) component of the
operating system to handle print functions. Although you can use an exter-
nal printer language such as PostScript, most users simply install printer
drivers and let Windows do all the work. The GDI uses the CPU rather than
the printer to process a print job and then sends the completed job to the
printer. When you print a letter with a TrueType font in Windows, for exam-
ple, the GDI processes the print job and then sends bitmapped images of
each page to the printer. The printer sees a page of TrueType text, therefore,
as a picture, not as text. As long as the printer has a capable-enough raster
image processor and plenty of RAM, you don’t need to worry about the
printer language in most situations. We’ll revisit printing in Windows in
more detail later in this chapter.
Windows Vista supports GDI printing, but it also includes a new print-
ing subsystem called the XML Paper Specification (XPS) print path. XPS pro-
vides
several
improvements
over
GDI,
including
enhanced
color
management (which works with Windows Color System) and better print
layout fidelity. The XPS print path requires a driver that supports XPS. Ad-
ditionally, some printers natively support XPS, eliminating the requirement
that the output be converted to a device-specific printer control language
before printing.
Printer Connectivity
Most printers connect to one of two ports on the PC: a DB-25 parallel port or
a USB port. The parallel connection is the classic way to plug in a printer, but
most printers today use USB. You’ll need to know how to support the more
obscure parallel ports, cables, and connections as well as the plug-and-play
USB connections.
Parallel Communication and Ports
The parallel port was included in the original IBM PC as a faster alternative
to serial communication. The IBM engineers considered serial communication,
limited to 1 bit at a time, to be too slow for the “high-speed” devices of
the day (for example, dot-matrix printers). The standard parallel port has
been kept around for backward compatibility despite several obvious
weaknesses.
504
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Parallel ports may be far faster than serial ports, but they are slow by
modern standards. The maximum data transfer rate of a standard parallel
port is still only approximately 150 kilobytes per second (KBps). Standard
parallel communication on the PC also relies heavily on software, eating up
a considerable amount of CPU time that could be used better.
Parallel ports are hindered by their lack of true bidirectional capability.
Although one-way communication was acceptable for simple line printers
and dot-matrix printers, parallel communication also became popular for a
wide range of external devices that required two-way communication. Al-
though it is possible to get two-way communication out of a standard paral-
lel port, the performance is not impressive.
IEEE 1284 Standard
In 1991, a group of printer manufacturers proposed to the Institute of Electri-
cal and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) that a committee be formed to create a
standard for a backward-compatible, high-speed, bidirectional parallel port
for the PC. The committee was the IEEE 1284 committee (hence the name of
the standard).
The IEEE 1284 standard requires the following:
■
Support for five distinct modes of operation: compatibility mode,
nibble mode, byte mode, EPP, and ECP
■
A standard method of negotiation for determining which modes are
supported both by the host PC and by the peripheral device
■
A standard physical interface (that is, the cables and connectors)
■
A standard electrical interface (that is, termination, impedance, and
so on)
Because only one set of data wires exists, all data transfer modes in-
cluded in the IEEE 1284 standard are half-duplex: data is transferred in only
one direction at a time.
Parallel Connections, Cabling, and Electricity
Although no true standard exists, standard parallel cable usually refers to a
printer cable with the previously mentioned male DB-25 connector on one end
and a 36-pin Centronics connector on the other (Figure 15.11).
The shielding (or lack thereof) of the internal wiring and other
electrical characteristics of a standard parallel printer cable are
largely undefined except by custom. In practice, these stan-
dard cables are acceptable for transferring data at 150 KBps,
and for distances of less than 6 feet, but they would be danger-
ously unreliable for some transfer modes.
For more reliability at distances up to 32 feet (10 meters),
use proper IEEE 1284–compliant cabling. The transfer speed
drops with the longer cables, but it does work, and sometimes
the trade-off between speed and distance is worth it.
Installing a parallel cable is a snap. Just insert the DB-25
connector into the parallel port on the back of the PC and insert
the Centronics connector into the printer’s Centronics port,
and you’re ready to go to press!
Chapter 15: Learning Printing
505
Although the phrase
“Centronics standard” was com-
mon in the heyday of parallel
ports, no such animal actually ex-
isted. Prior to the development of
IEEE 1284, a very loose set of
standards was adopted by manu-
facturers in an attempt to reduce
incompatibility issues somewhat.
Many techs confuse the con-
cept of duplex printing—a pro-
cess that requires special printers
capable of printing on both
sides of a sheet of paper—with
bidirectional printing. They are
two different things!
Tech Tip
IEEE 1284 Transfer
Modes
The five modes of operation for
parallel printing specified in the
IEEE 1284 standard (compatibil-
ity, nibble, byte, EPP, ECP) are
inching closer to obsolescence as
USB printers take over the mar-
ket. If you find yourself needing
to optimize the performance of a
legacy parallel printer, you can
look up these modes by name, using
various Web search tools.

USB Printers
New printers now use USB connections that you can plug into any USB port
on your computer. USB printers don’t usually come with a USB cable, so
you need to purchase one when you purchase a printer. (It’s quite a disap-
pointment to come home with your new printer only to find you can’t con-
nect it because it didn’t come with a USB cable.) Most printers use the
standard USB type A connector on one end and the smaller USB type B con-
nector on the other end, although some use two type A connectors. Which-
ever configuration your USB printer has, just plug in the USB cable—it’s
literally that easy!
FireWire Printers
Some printers offer FireWire connections in addition to or instead of USB
connections. A FireWire printer is just as easy to connect as a USB printer,
because FireWire is also hot-swappable and hot-pluggable. Again, make
sure you have the proper cable, as most printers don’t come with one. If
your printer has both connections, which one should you use? The answer is
easy if your PC has only USB and not FireWire. If you have a choice, either
connection is just as good as the other, and the speeds are comparable. If you
already have many USB devices, you may want to use the FireWire printer
connection, to leave a USB port free for another device.
Network Printers
Connecting a printer to a network isn’t just for offices anymore. More and
more homes and home offices are enjoying the benefits of network printing.
It used to be that to share a printer on a network—that is, to make it available
to all network users—you would physically connect the printer to a single
computer and then share the printer on the network. The downside to this
was that the computer to which the printer was connected had to be left on
for others to use the printer.
Today, the typical network printer comes with its own onboard network
adapter that uses a standard RJ-45 Ethernet cable to connect the printer di-
rectly to the network by way of a router. The printer can typically be as-
signed a static IP address, or it can acquire one dynamically from a DHCP
server. (Don’t know what a router, IP address, or DHCP server is? Take a
look at Chapter 16, “Learning Local Area Networking.”) Once connected to
the network, the printer acts independent of any single PC. Some of the
more costly network printers come with a built-in Wi-Fi adapter to connect
to the network wirelessly. Alternatively, some printers offer Bluetooth in-
terfaces for networking.
Even if a printer does not come with built-in Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or
Bluetooth, you can purchase a standalone network device known as a print
server to connect your printer to the network. These print servers, which can
be Ethernet or Wi-Fi, enable one or several printers to attach via parallel port
or USB. So take that ancient ImageWriter dot-matrix printer and network
it—I dare you!
506
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Some printers come with
both USB and parallel connec-
tions, but this has become very
rare. If you need a parallel
printer for a system, be sure to
confirm that the particular
model you want will work with
your system!
In almost all cases, you
must install drivers before you
plug a USB printer into your
computer. You’ll learn about
installing printer drivers later
in this chapter.

Other Printers
Plenty of other connection types are available for printers. We’ve focused
mainly on parallel, USB, FireWire, and networked connections. Be aware
that you may run into an old serial port printer or a SCSI printer. Although
this is unlikely, know that it’s a possibility.
■Installing a Printer in Windows
You need to take a moment to understand how Windows handles printing,
and then you’ll see how to install, configure, and troubleshoot printers in
these operating systems.
To Windows 2000, XP, and Vista/7, a printer is not a physical device; it is
a program that controls one or more physical printers. The physical printer is
called a print device to Windows (although I continue to use the term
“printer” for most purposes, just like almost every tech on the planet).
Printer drivers and a spooler are still present, but in Windows 2000/XP and
Vista/7, they are integrated into the printer itself (Figure 15.12). This ar-
rangement gives Windows amazing flexibility. For example, one printer can
support multiple print devices, enabling a system to act as a print server. If
one print device goes down, the printer automatically redirects the output
to a working print device.
The general installation, configuration, and troubleshooting issues are
basically identical in all modern versions of Windows. Here’s a review of a
typical Windows printer installation. I’ll mention the trivial differences
among Windows 2000, XP, and Vista as I go along.
Setting Up Printers
Setting up a printer is so easy that it’s almost scary. Most printers are plug
and play, so installing a printer is reduced to simply plugging it in and load-
ing the driver if needed. If the system does not detect the printer or if the
printer is not plug and play, click Start | Printers and Faxes in Windows XP
to open the Printers applet; in Windows 2000, click Start | Settings |
Printers. For Windows Vista, you need to open the Control Panel and find

exam tests you on installing and
troubleshooting printers, so read
these sections carefully!

the Printer menu item—it is either by itself or, in Cate-
gory View, under Hardware. You can also find the icon
for this applet in the Control Panel of Windows 2000/XP.
As you might guess, you install a new printer by
clicking the Add a Printer icon (somehow Microsoft has
managed to leave the name of this applet unchanged
through all Windows versions since 9x). This starts the
Add Printer Wizard. After a pleasant intro screen, you
must choose to install either a printer plugged directly
into your system or a network printer (Figure 15.13). You
also have the Automatically detect and install my Plug and
Play printer option, which you can use in many cases
when installing a USB printer.
If you choose a local printer (see Chapter 16,
“Learning Local Area Networking,” for a discussion of
networked printers), the applet next asks you to select a
port; select the one where you installed the new printer
(Figure 15.14). Once you select the port, Windows asks
you to specify the type of printer, either by selecting the
type from the list or by using the Have Disk option, just as you would for
any other device (Figure 15.15). Note the handy Windows Update button,
which you can use to get the latest printer driver from the Internet. When
you click Next on this screen, Windows installs the printer.
Figure 15.16 shows a typical Windows XP Printers and Faxes screen on a
system with one printer installed. Note the small checkmark in the icon’s
corner; this shows that the device is the default printer. If you have multiple
printers, you can change the default printer by selecting the printer’s prop-
erties and checking Make Default Printer.
In addition to the regular driver installation outlined previously, some
installations use printer emulation. Printer emulation simply means using
a substitute printer driver for a printer, as opposed to using one made
exclusively for that printer. You’ll run into printer emulation in two

circumstances. First, some new printers do not come with their own drivers.
They instead emulate a well-known printer (such as an HP LaserJet 4) and
run perfectly well on that printer driver. Second, you may see emulation in
the “I don’t have the right driver!” scenario. I keep about three different HP
LaserJet and Epson ink jet printers installed on my PC because I know that
with these printer drivers, I can print to almost any printer. Some printers
may require you to set them into an emulation mode to handle a driver other
than their native one.
Optimizing Print Performance
Although a quality printer is the first step toward quality output, your output
relies on factors other than the printer itself. What you see on the screen may
not match what comes out of the printer, so calibration is important. Using the
wrong type of paper can result in less than acceptable printed documents. Con-
figuring the printer driver and spool settings can also affect your print jobs.
Calibration
If you’ve ever tweaked that digital photograph so it looks perfect onscreen,
only to discover that the final printout was darker than you had hoped, con-
sider calibrating your monitor. Calibration matches the print output of your
printer to the visual output on your monitor and governs that through soft-
ware. All three parts need to be set up properly for you to print what you see
consistently.

Tech Tip
Readme Files
You’ve seen how to get your sys-
tem to recognize a printer, but
what do you do when you add a
brand-new printer? Like most pe-
ripherals, the printer will include
an installation CD-ROM that
contains various useful files. One
of the most important but least
used tools on this CD-ROM is
the Readme file. This file, gener-
ally in TXT format, contains the
absolute latest information on
any idiosyncrasies, problems,
or incompatibilities related to
your printer or printer driver.
Usually, you can find it in the
root folder of the installation CD-
ROM, although many printer
drivers install the Readme file on
your hard drive so you can access
it from the Start menu. The rule
here is read first to avoid a
headache later!

Computer monitors output in RGB—that is, they compose colors using
red, green, and blue pixels, as discussed in Chapter 13, “Learning Video and
Multimedia”—while printers mix their colors differently to arrive at their
output. As mentioned earlier, the CMYK method composes colors from
cyan (blue), magenta (red), yellow, and black.
The upshot of all this is that the printer tries to output—by using CMYK
(or another technique)—what you see on the screen using RGB. Because the
two color modes do not create color the same way, you see color shifts and
not-so-subtle differences between the onscreen image and the printed im-
age. By calibrating your monitor, you can adjust the setting to match the out-
put of your printer. You can do this manually through “eyeballing” it or
automatically by using calibration hardware.
To calibrate your monitor manually, obtain a test image from the Web
(try sites such as www.DigitalDog.net) and print it out. If you have a good
eye, you can compare this printout to what you see on the screen and make
the adjustments manually through your monitor’s controls or display settings.
Another option is to calibrate your printer by using an International
Color Consortium (ICC) color profile, a preference file that instructs your
printer to print colors a certain way—for example, to match what is on your
screen. Loading a different color profile results in a different color output.
Color profiles are sometimes included on the installation CD-ROM with a
printer, but you can create or purchase custom profiles as well. The use of
ICC profiles is not limited to printers; you can also use them to control the
output of monitors, scanners, or even digital cameras. Windows Vista in-
cludes Windows Color System (WCS) to help build color profiles for use
across devices. WCS is based on a new standard that Microsoft calls color in-
frastructure and translation engine (CITE).
■Troubleshooting Printers
As easy as printers are to set up, they are equally robust at running, assum-
ing that you install the proper drivers and keep the printer well maintained.
But printer errors do occasionally develop. This section takes a look at the
most common print problems with Windows.
Printers of all stripes share some common problems, such as print jobs
that don’t print, strangely sized prints, and misalignment. Other issues in-
clude consumables, sharing multiple printers, and crashing on power-up.
Let’s take a look at these general troubleshooting issues, but start with a re-
cap of the tools of the trade.
Tools of the Trade
Before you jump in and start to work on a printer that’s giving you fits, you’ll
need some tools. You can use the standard computer tech tools in your toolkit,
plusacoupleofprinter-specificdevices.Herearesomethatwillcomeinhandy:

Many printers allow you to print a test page either via the controls on the
printer or through Windows. Make sure you read your printer’s manual to
find out how to do this, because printing a test page is often a vital trouble-
shooting tool.
Print Job Never Prints
If you click Print but nothing comes out of the printer, first check all the ob-
vious things. Is the printer on? Is it connected? Is it online? Does it have pa-
per? Assuming the printer is in good order, it’s time to look at the spooler.
You can see the spooler status either by double-clicking the printer’s icon in
the Printers applet or by double-clicking the tiny printer icon in the notifica-
tion area if it’s present. If you’re having a problem, the printer icon will al-
most always be there. Figure 15.17 shows the print spooler open.
Print spoolers can easily overflow or become corrupt due to a lack of disk
space, too many print jobs, or one of a thousand other factors. The status
window shows all of the pending print jobs and enables you to delete, start,
or pause jobs. I usually just delete the affected print job(s) and try again.
Print spoolers are handy. If the printer goes down, you can just leave the
print jobs in the spooler until the printer comes back online. Some versions
of Windows require you to select Resume Printing manually, but others au-
tomatically continue the print job(s). If you have a printer that isn’t coming
on anytime soon, you can simply delete the print job in the spooler window
and try another printer.
If you have problems with the print spooler, you can get around them by
changing your print spool settings. Go into the Printers and Faxes applet,
right-click the icon of the printer in question, and choose Properties. In the re-
sulting Properties window (Figure 15.18), choose the Print directly to the
printer radio button and click OK; then try sending your print job again. Note
that this window also offers you the choice of printing immediately—that is,
starting to print pages as soon as the spooler has enough information to feed
to the printer—or holding off on printing until the entire job is spooled.
Chapter 15: Learning Printing
511
• Figure 15.17
Print spooler

Another possible cause for a stalled print job is that the
printer is simply waiting for the correct paper! Laser printers
in particular have settings that tell them what size paper is in
their standard paper tray or trays. If the application sending
a print job specifies a different paper size—for example, it
wants to print a standard No. 10 envelope, or perhaps a legal
sheet, but the standard paper tray holds only 8.5 × 11 letter
paper—the printer usually pauses and holds up the queue
until someone switches out the tray or manually feeds the
type of paper that this print job requires. You can usually
override this pause, even without having the specified pa-
per, by pressing the OK or GO button on the printer.
The printer’s default paper tray and paper size options
will differ greatly depending on the printer type and model.
To find these settings, go into the printer’s Properties win-
dow from the Printers and Faxes applet, and then select the
Device Settings tab. This list of settings includes Form To
Tray Assignment, where you can specify which tray (in the
case of a printer with multiple paper trays) holds which size
paper.
Strange Sizes
A print job that comes out a strange size usually points to a user mistake in
setting up the print job. All applications have a Print command and a Page
Setup interface. The Page Setup interface enables you to define a number of
print options, which vary from application to application. Figure 15.19
shows the Page Setup options for Microsoft Word. Make sure the page is set
up properly before you blame the printer for a problem.
512

• Figure 15.19
Page Setup options for Microsoft Word

If you know the page is set up correctly, recheck the printer drivers. If
necessary, uninstall and reinstall the printer drivers. If the problem persists,
you may have a serious problem with the printer’s print engine, but that
comes up as a likely answer only when you continually get the same
strangely sized printouts using a variety of applications.
Misaligned or Garbage Prints
Misaligned or garbage printouts invariably point to a corrupted or incorrect
driver. Make sure you’re using the right driver (it’s hard to mess this up, but
not impossible) and then uninstall and reinstall the printer driver and print
a test page. If the problem persists, you may be asking the printer to do
something it cannot do. For example, you may be printing to a PostScript
printer with a PCL driver. Check the printer type to verify that you haven’t
installed the wrong type of driver for that printer!

hazardous chemical is used.
Tech Tip
Check the MSDS
When in doubt about what to do
with a component, check with the
manufacturer for a material safety
data sheet (MSDS). These stan-
dardized forms provide detailed
information about the potential
environmental hazards associated
with different components and
proper disposal methods. For exam-

printer issue—you can find an
MSDS for most PC components.
When in doubt about how to get
rid of any PC component, check
with the manufacturer for an
MSDS.

Chapter 15 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
aspects of printers.
Describe current printer technologies
■
Impact printers create an image on paper by
physically striking an ink ribbon against the paper’s
surface. The most commonly used impact printer
technology is dot matrix. Dot-matrix printers have
a large installed base in businesses, and they can be
used for multipart forms because they actually
strike the paper. Dot-matrix printers use a grid, or
matrix, of tiny pins, also known as printwires, to
strike an inked printer ribbon and produce images
on paper. The case that holds the printwires is
called a printhead. Dot-matrix printers come in
two varieties: 9-pin (draft quality) and 24-pin
(letter quality).
■
Inkjet printers include a printhead mechanism,
support electronics, a transfer mechanism to move
the printhead back and forth, and a paper feed
component to drag, move, and eject paper. They
eject ink through tiny tubes. The heat or pressure
used to move the ink is created by tiny resistors or
electroconductive plates at the end of each tube.
■
Ink is stored in ink cartridges. Older color printers
used two cartridges: one for black and one for
cyan, magenta, and yellow. Newer printers come
with four, six, eight, or more cartridges.
■
The quality of a print image is called the print
resolution. The resolution is measured in dots per
inch (dpi), which has two values: horizontal and
vertical. An example of a resolution is 600 × 600
dpi. Printing speed is measured in pages per
minute (ppm). Modern inkjet printers can print on
a variety of media, including glossy photo paper,
optical discs, or fabric.
■
Dye-sublimation printers are used to achieve
excellent print quality, especially in color, but
they’re expensive. Documents printed through the
dye-sublimation process display continuous-tone
images, meaning that each pixel dot is a blend of
the dye colors. This is in contrast to other print
technologies’ dithered images, which use closely
packed, single-color dots to simulate blended
colors.
■
Two kinds of thermal printers create either quick
one-color printouts such as faxes or store receipts
(direct thermal) or higher-quality color prints
(thermal wax transfer).
■
Using a process called electro-photographic
imaging, laser printers produce high-quality and
high-speed output. Laser printers usually use
lasers as a light source because of their precision,
but some lower-cost printers may use LED arrays
instead. The toner cartridge in a laser printer
supplies the toner that creates the image on the
page; many other laser printer parts, especially
those that suffer the most wear and tear, have been
incorporated into the toner cartridge. Although the
majority of laser printers are monochrome, you can
find color laser printers capable of printing
photographs.
■
Be aware of the cost of consumables when
purchasing a printer. Some less expensive printers
may seem like a good deal, but ink or toner
cartridge replacements can cost as much as the
entire printer.
■
The photosensitive drum in a laser printer is an
aluminum cylinder coated with particles of
photosensitive compounds. The erase lamp
exposes the entire surface of the photosensitive
drum to light, making the photosensitive coating
conductive and leaving the surface particles
electrically neutral. When the primary corona is
charged with an extremely high voltage, an electric
field (or corona) forms, enabling voltage to pass to
the drum and charge the photosensitive particles
on its surface; the surface of the drum receives a
uniform negative voltage of between ~600 and
~1,000 V.
■
The laser acts as the writing mechanism of the
printer. When particles are struck by the laser,
they are discharged and left with a ~100-V
negative charge. The toner in a laser printer is a
fine powder made up of plastic particles bonded to
iron particles. The toner cylinder charges the toner
with a negative charge of between ~200 and ~500 V.
514
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

Because that charge falls between the original
uniform negative charge of the photosensitive drum
(~600 to ~1000 V) and the charge of the particles on
the drum’s surface hit by the laser (~100 V), particles
of toner are attracted to the areas of the photosensitive
drum that have been hit by the laser. The transfer
corona applies a positive charge to the paper,
drawing the negatively charged toner particles on
the drum to the paper. The toner is merely resting
on top of the paper after the static charge eliminator
has removed the paper’s static charge. Two rollers,
a pressure roller and a heated roller, are used to
fuse the toner to the paper.
■
All laser printers have at least two separate power
supplies. The primary power supply, which may
actually be more than one power supply, provides
power to the motors that move the paper, the
system electronics, the laser, and the transfer corona.
The high-voltage power supply usually only
provides power to the primary corona; it is one of
the most dangerous devices in the world of PCs.
Always turn off a laser printer before opening it up.
■
A laser printer’s mechanical functions are served
by complex gear systems packed together in discrete
units generically called gear packs or gearboxes.
Most laser printers have two or three. Every laser
printer has sensors that detect a broad range of
conditions, such as paper jams, empty paper trays,
or low toner levels.
■
Every laser printer contains at least one electronic
system board (many have two or three) that contains
the main processor, the printer’s ROM, and the
RAM used to store the image before it is printed.
When the printer doesn’t have enough RAM to
store the image before it prints, you get a memory
overflow problem. Most printers can use generic
DRAM like the kind you use in your PC, but check
with the manufacturer to be sure.
■
Because even tiny concentrations of ozone (O3) will
cause damage to printer components, most laser
printers have a special ozone filter that needs to be
vacuumed or replaced periodically.
■
Solid ink printers use sticks of solid ink to produce
extremely vibrant color. The inks are melted,
absorbed into the paper fibers, and then solidify,
producing continuous-tone output in a single pass.
The solid ink sticks may be inserted midway
through a print job if a certain color needs to be
topped off.
■
ASCII contains a variety of control codes for
transferring data, some of which can be used to
control printers; ASCII code 10 (or 0A in hex) means
“Line Feed,” and ASCII code 12 (0C) means “Form
Feed.” These commands have been standard since
before the creation of IBM PCs, and all printers
respond to them; however, the control codes are
extremely limited. Utilizing high-end graphics and
a wide variety of fonts requires more advanced
languages.
■
Adobe Systems’ PostScript page description
language is a device-independent printer language
capable of high-resolution graphics and scalable
fonts. Because PostScript is understood by printers
at a hardware level, the majority of the image
processing is done by the printer and not the PC’s
CPU, so PostScript printers print faster. PostScript
defines the page as a single raster image; this
makes PostScript files extremely portable.
■
Hewlett-Packard’s printer control language (PCL)
features a set of printer commands greatly expanded
from ASCII, but it does not support advanced
graphical functions. PCL6 features scalable fonts
and additional line-drawing commands. PCL uses
a series of commands to define the characters on
the page, rather than defining the page as a single
raster image like PostScript.
■
Windows 2000/XP use the graphical device interface
(GDI) component of the operating system to
handle print functions. The GDI uses the CPU
rather than the printer to process a print job and
then sends the completed job to the printer. As
long as the printer has a capable-enough raster
image processor (RIP) and plenty of RAM, you
don’t need to worry about the printer language at
all in most situations. Windows Vista/7 includes
support for the XML Paper Specification (XPS)
print path, which requires an XPS-compatible
driver. Some devices support XPS natively.
■
Most printers connect to one of two ports on the
PC: a DB-25 parallel port or a USB port. The
parallel connection is the classic way to plug in a
printer, but most new printers use USB. The
parallel port was included in the original IBM PC
as a faster alternative to serial communication and
has been kept around for backward compatibility.
Parallel ports are slow by modern standards, with
a maximum data transfer rate of 150 KBps. Parallel
ports lack true bidirectional capability. A standard
parallel connection normally manifests as a female
Chapter 15: Learning Printing
515

DB-25 connector on the PC and a corresponding
male connector on the printer cable. Eight wires are
used as grounds, four for control signals, five for
status signals, and eight for data signals going
from the PC to the device. The parallel connector
on the printer side is called a Centronics connector.
■
IEEE 1284 was developed as a standard for a
backward-compatible, high-speed, bidirectional
parallel port for the PC. It requires support for
compatibility, nibble mode, byte mode, EPP, and
ECP; a standard method of negotiating compatible
modes between printer and PC; standard cables
and connectors; and a standard electrical interface.
■
USB is the most popular type of printer connection
today. USB printers rarely come with the necessary
USB cable, so you may need to purchase one at the
same time you purchase the printer. FireWire
printers are less prevalent than USB but offer easy
connectivity, high speed, and hot-swapping
capability.
■
Network printers come with their own network
card and connect directly to a network. This can be
an RJ-45 port for an actual cable, or it can be a
wireless network card. Some printers offer
Bluetooth adapters for networking. To connect a
printer with a network card directly to a network,
use a print server.
Install a printer on a Windows PC
■
In Windows 2000/XP/Vista, a printer is not a
physical device; it is a program that controls one or
more physical printers. The physical printer is
called a print device. Print drivers and a spooler
are still present, but in 2000/XP/Vista they are
integrated into the printer itself.
■
Select Start | Printers and Faxes in Windows XP to
open the Printers applet; in Windows 2000, select
Start | Settings | Printers. In Windows Vista select
the Printers item from the Control Panel. This
applet can also be found in the Control Panel of
Windows 2000/XP. You install a new printer by
clicking the Add Printer icon to start the Add
Printer Wizard. You must choose to install a local
or a network printer; and you must select a port for
a local printer. You must specify the printer type
from the wizard’s list, or use the Have Disk option.
Windows XP and Vista’s applet features a
Windows Update button you can use to get the
latest printer driver from the Internet.
■
One printer will always be the default printer. If
you have more than one printer installed, you can
make any printer the default printer. The icon for
the default printer has a small checkmark in the
corner. If you have multiple printers, you can
change the default printer by selecting the printer’s
properties and checking Make Default Printer.
■
Printer emulation means to use a substitute printer
driver for a printer, as opposed to one made
exclusively for that printer. Some printers are designed
to emulate other, more widely supported models.
If you don’t have the specific driver for a printer,
you can often use the driver from a similar model.
■
Your monitor creates colors by using RGB, while a
printer outputs in CMYK. This difference can lead
to a printed page differing greatly in color and tone
from what you see on the monitor. Calibrating
your monitor to your printer is an important step
in printing the colors you see on your screen.
Manually calibrate your monitor by eyeballing it,
use ICC color profiles to instruct the printer to
output colors a certain way, or use calibration
hardware and software to automate the process.
Windows Vista includes Windows Color System to
help build color profiles for use across devices.
Recognize and fix basic printer problems
■
When troubleshooting a printer, first check all the
obvious things. Is the printer on? Is it connected? Is
it online? Does it have paper? Then check the
spooler status either by double-clicking the
printer’s icon in the Printers applet, or by double-
clicking the tiny printer icon in the system tray if
it’s present. You may be able to bypass spooler
problems by changing the printer properties
setting to Print directly to the printer.
■
A print job that comes out a strange size usually
points to a user mistake in setting up the print job.
Use the program’s Page Setup feature to fix these
problems. If you know the page is set up correctly,
recheck the printer drivers. Misaligned or garbage
printouts invariably point to a corrupted or
incorrect driver.
■
Printer manufacturers will supply an MSDS for each
of their products; they provide detailed information
about the potential environmental hazards associated
with different components and proper disposal
methods. This isn’t just a printer issue—you can find
an MSDS for most PC components.

etworks dominate the modern computing environment. A vast percentage
of businesses have PCs connected in a small local area network (LAN),
and big businesses simply can’t survive without connecting their many offices
into a single wide area network (WAN). Even the operating systems of today
demand networks. Windows XP, Vista, and 7, for example, come out of the box
assuming you’ll attach them to a network of some sort just to make them work
past 30 days (product activation), and they get all indignant if you don’t.
Because networks are so common today, every good tech needs to know
the basics of networking technology, operating systems, implementation, and
troubleshooting. Accordingly, this chapter teaches you how to build and
troubleshoot a basic network.

■A Brief History of Networking
Technologies
When the first network designers sat down at a café to figure out how to get
two or more PCs to share data and peripherals, they had to write a lot of de-
tails on little white napkins to answer even the most basic questions. The
first big question was: How? It’s easy to say, “Well, just run a wire between
them!” Although most networks do manifest themselves via some type of
cable, this barely touches the thousands of questions that come into play
here. Here are a few of the big questions:
■
How will each computer be identified? If two or more computers
want to talk at the same time, how do you ensure that all
conversations are understood?
■
What kind of wire? What gauge? How many wires in the cable?
Which wires do which things? How long can the cable be? What
type of connectors?
■
If more than one PC accesses the same file, how can they be
prevented from destroying each other’s changes to that file?
■
How can access to data and peripherals be controlled?
Clearly, making a modern PC network entails a lot more than just string-
ing up some cable! Most commonly, you have a client machine, a PC that re-
quests information or services. It needs a network interface card (NIC) that
defines or labels the client on the network. A NIC also helps break files into
smaller data units, called packets, to send across the network, and it helps re-
assemble the packets it receives into whole files. Second, you need some me-
dium for delivering the packets between two or more PCs—most often this is
a wire that can carry electrical pulses; sometimes it’s radio waves or other
wireless methods. Third, your PC’s operating system has to be able to com-
municate with its own networking hardware and with other machines on the
network. Finally, modern PC networks often employ a server machine that
provides information or services. Figure 16.1 shows a typical network layout.
This section of the chapter looks at the inventive ways network engi-
neers found to handle the first two of the four issues. After a brief look at
core technology, the chapter dives into four specific types of networks.
You’ll dig into the software side of things later in the chapter.
Topology
If a bunch of computers connect together to make a network, some logic or
order must influence the way they connect. Perhaps each computer con-
nects to a single main line that snakes around the office. Each computer
might have its own cable, with all of the cables coming together to a central
point. Or maybe all of the cables from all of the computers connect to a main
loop that moves data along a track, picking up and dropping off data like a
circular subway line.
A network’s topology describes the way that computers connect to each
other in that network. The most common network topologies are called bus,
ring, star, and mesh. Figure 16.2 shows the four types: a bus topology, where
Chapter 16: Learning Local Area Networking
521

all computers connect to the network via a main line called a bus cable; a ring
topology, where all computers on the network attach to a central ring of ca-
ble; a star topology, where the computers on the network connect to a central
wiring point (usually called a hub); and a mesh topology, where each com-
puter has a dedicated line to every other computer—the mesh topology is
mostly used in wireless networks. There are also hybrid topologies, such as
star bus or star ring, that combine aspects of the other topologies to capital-
ize on their strengths and minimize their weaknesses. You’ll look at the
most important hybrid topology,
star bus, in a moment, but for now,
make sure you know the four main
topologies!
If you’re looking at Figure 16.2
and thinking that a mesh topology
looks amazingly resilient and ro-
bust, it is—at least on paper. Be-
cause every computer physically
connects to every other computer
on the network, even if half of the
PCs crash, the network functions as
well as ever (for the survivors). In a
practical sense, however, imple-
menting a true mesh topology net-
work would be an expensive mess.
For example, even for a tiny net-
work with only 10 PCs, you would
need 45 separate and distinct pieces
of cable to connect every PC to ev-
ery other PC. What a mesh mess!
Because of this, mesh topologies
have never been practical in a ca-
bled network.

Although a topology describes the method by which systems in a net-
work connect, the topology alone doesn’t describe all of the features neces-
sary to make a cabling system work. The term bus topology, for example,
describes a network that consists of some number of machines connected to
the network via the same piece of cable. Notice that this definition leaves a
lot of questions unanswered. What is the cable made of? How long can it be?
How do the machines decide which machine should send data at a specific
moment? A network based on a bus topology can answer these questions in
a number of different ways.
Most techs make a clear distinction between the logical topology of a
network—how the network is laid out on paper, with nice straight lines and
boxes—and the physical topology. The physical topology describes the typi-
cally messy computer network, with cables running diagonally through the
ceiling space or snaking their way through walls. If someone describes the
topology of a particular network, make sure you understand whether
they’re talking about the logical or physical topology.
Over the years, manufacturers and standards bodies created several
specific network technologies based on different topologies. A network tech-
nology is a practical application of a topology and other critical technologies
to provide a method to get data from one computer to another on a network.
Network Communication
If there was nothing more to computer networking than simply choosing how
to wire a bunch of computers together, then this chapter would already be
over. However, as you might expect, it’s considerably more complex than that.
The computers not only have to be hooked up to one another, but also must
have a means of transmitting data to one another in a way that every computer
in the network can understand. This section looks at how that’s done.
Packets/Frames and NICs
Data is moved from one PC to another in dis-
crete chunks called packets or frames. The
terms packet and frame are interchangeable.
Every NIC in the world has a built-in identi-
fier, a binary address unique to that single
network card, called a media access control
(MAC) address. You read that right—every
network card in the world has its own
unique MAC address! The MAC address is
48 bits long, providing more than 281 trillion
MAC addresses, so there are plenty of MAC
addresses to go around. MAC addresses
may be binary, but we represent them by us-
ing 12 hexadecimal characters. These MAC
addresses are burned into every NIC, and
some NIC makers print the MAC address on
the card. Figure 16.3 shows the System Infor-
mation utility description of a NIC, with the
MAC address highlighted.
Chapter 16: Learning Local Area Networking
523
• Figure 16.3
MAC address

Hey! I thought we were talking about packets? Well, we are, but you
need to understand MAC addresses to understand packets. The many vari-
eties of packets share certain common features (Figure 16.4). First, packets
contain the MAC address of the network card to which the data is being
sent. Second, they have the MAC address of the network card that sent the
data. Third is the data itself (at this point, we have no idea what the data is—
certain software handles that question), which can vary in size depending
on the type of frame. Finally, some
type of data check—such as a cyclic re-
dundancy check (CRC)—is performed
and information is stored in the packet
to enable the receiving network card to
verify if the data was received in good
order.
This discussion of packets raises
the question, how big is the packet? Or
more specifically, how much data do
you put into each packet? How do you
ensure that the receiving PC under-
stands the way the data was broken
down by the sending machine and can
thus put the pieces back together? The
problem in answering these questions
is that they encompass so many items.
When the first networks were created,
everything from the frames to the con-
nectors to the type of cable had to be
invented from scratch.
To make a successful network, you need the sending and receiving PCs
to use the same hardware protocol. A hardware protocol defines many as-
pects of a network, from the topology, to the packet type, to the cabling and
connectors used. A hardware protocol defines everything necessary to get
data from one computer to another. Over the years, many hardware proto-
cols have been implemented, with such names as Token Ring, FDDI, and
ARCnet, but one hardware protocol dominates the modern PC computing
landscape: Ethernet.
Introducing Ethernet
A consortium of companies composed of Digital Equipment, Intel, and
Xerox invented the first network in the mid 1970s. More than just creating a
network, they wrote a series of standards that defined everything necessary
to get data from one computer to another. This series of standards was
called Ethernet, and it is the dominant standard for today’s networks. Ether-
net comes in two main flavors defined by cabling type: unshielded twisted
pair and fiber optic. Because all flavors of Ethernet use the same packet type,
you can have any combination of hardware devices and cabling systems on
an Ethernet network and all of the PCs will be able to communicate just fine.
Most modern Ethernet networks employ one of three technologies (and
sometimes all three), 10BaseT, 100BaseT, or 1000BaseT. As the numbers in
the names suggest, 10BaseT networks run at 10 Mbps, 100BaseT networks
run at 100 Mbps, and 1000BaseT networks—called Gigabit Ethernet—run at
524
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Even though MAC addresses
are embedded into the NIC,
some NICs allow you to change
the MAC address on the NIC.
This is rarely done.

Generic packet/frame

1000 Mbps, or 1 Gbps. All three technologies—sometimes referred to collec-
tively as 10/100/1000BaseT or just plain Ethernet—use a star bus topology
and connect via a type of cable called unshielded twisted pair (UTP).
Star Bus
Imagine taking a bus network and shrinking the bus down so it will fit in-
side a box. Then, instead of attaching each PC directly to the wire, you attach
them via cables to special ports on the box (Figure 16.5). The box with the
bus takes care of all of the tedious details required by a bus network. The bus
topology would look a lot like a star topology, wouldn’t it?
The central box with the bus is
called a hub or switch. The hub provides
a common point for connection for net-
work devices. Hubs can have a wide va-
riety of ports. Most consumer-level
hubs have four or eight, but business-
level hubs can have 32 or more ports. A
hub is the old-style device, rarely used
in today’s networks. A switch is a far
superior and far more common version
of a hub. Figure 16.6 shows a typical
consumer-level switch.
Different networks come in different
speeds. One common speed is 100 Mega-
bits per second (Mbps). We call this
speed a bandwidth. If you put 32 PCs on
a 32-port 100-Mbps hub, you have
32 PCs sharing the 100-Mbps band-
width. A switch addresses that problem
by making each port its own separate
network. Each PC gets to use the full
bandwidth available. The bottom line?
Swap out your old hubs for newer
switches and you’ll dramatically im-
prove your network performance.

Earlier forms of Ethernet
used coaxial cable: 10Base5
used RG-8 coaxial cables with
DB-15 connectors called AUI
connectors and could run up to
500 meters. 10Base2 used RG-62
cable with BNC connectors and
could run up to 185 meters.
• Figure 16.5
Star bus
• Figure 16.6
A switch

Cheap and centralized, a star bus network does not go down if a cable
breaks. True, the network would go down if the hub itself failed, but that is
rare. Even if a hub fails, replacing a hub in a closet is much easier than trac-
ing a bus running through walls and ceilings and trying to find a break!
Unshielded Twisted Pair
Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling is the specified cabling for 10/100/
1000BaseT and is the predominant cabling system used today. Many types
of twisted pair cabling are available, and the type used depends on the
needs of the network. Twisted pair cabling consists of AWG 22–26 gauge
wire twisted together into color-coded pairs. Each wire is individually insu-
lated and encased as a group in a common jacket.
CAT Levels
UTP cables come in categories that define the maximum speed
at which data can be transferred (also called bandwidth). The major catego-
ries (CATs) are as follows:
CAT 1
Standard phone line
CAT 2
Data speeds up to 4 Mbps
(ISDN and T1 lines)
CAT 3
Data speeds up to 16 Mbps
CAT 4
Data speeds up to 20 Mbps
CAT 5
Data speeds up to 100 Mbps CAT 5e
Data speeds up to 1 Gbps
CAT 6
Data speeds up to 10 Gbps
The CAT level should be clearly marked on the cable, as
Figure 16.7 shows.
The Telecommunication Industry Association/Electronics In-
dustries Alliance (TIA/EIA) establishes the UTP categories,
which fall under the TIA/EIA 568 specification. Currently,
most installers use CAT 5e or CAT 6 cable. Although many
networks run at 10 Mbps, the industry standard has shifted to
networks designed to run at 100 Mbps and faster. Because
only CAT 5 or better handles these speeds, just about every-
one is installing the higher rated cabling, even if they are run-
ning at speeds that CAT 3 or CAT 4 would do. Consequently,
it is becoming more difficult to get anything but CAT 5, CAT
5e, or CAT 6 cables.
Shielded Twisted Pair
Shielded twisted pair (STP), as its name implies, consists of twisted pairs of
wires surrounded by shielding to protect them from EMI, or electromag-
netic interference. STP is pretty rare, primarily because there’s so little need
for STP’s shielding; it only really matters in locations with excessive elec-
tronic noise, such as a shop floor area with lots of lights, electric motors, or
other machinery that could cause problems for other cables.
Implementing 10/100/1000BaseT
The 10BaseT, 100BaseT, and 1000BaseT cabling standards require two pairs
of wires: a pair for sending and a pair for receiving. 10BaseT runs on CAT 3,
CAT 4, or CAT 5 cable. 100BaseT requires at least CAT 5 to run. 1000BaseT is

Although Token Ring is very
rarely seen today, CompTIA
wants you to know a little of its
terminology. Just as in Ethernet,
the creators of Token Ring de-
cided to move to a star topology
and put the ring (as opposed to
Ethernet’s bus) in a box that
looks like a hub/switch. They call
the box the media access (or
sometimes attachment) unit
(MAU). Some techs call it a
Multistation Access Unit
(MSAU), but CompTIA uses
MAU, so remember that for
the exam!

Cable markings for CAT level

a special case because it needs all four pairs of wires in a CAT 5e or CAT 6 ca-
ble. These cables use a connector called an RJ-45 connector. The RJ (registered
jack) designation was invented by Ma Bell (the phone company, for you
youngsters) years ago and is still used today. Currently only two types of RJ
connectors are used for networking: RJ-11 and RJ-45 (Figure 16.8). RJ-11 is
the connector that hooks your telephone to the telephone jack. It supports
up to two pairs of wires, though most phone lines use only one pair. The
other pair is used to support a second phone line. RJ-11 connectors are pri-
marily used for dial-up networking (see Chapter 18, “Learning the
Internet”) and are not used in any common LAN installation, although a
few weird (and out of business) “network in a box” companies used them.
RJ-45 is the standard for UTP connectors. RJ-45 has connections for up to
four pairs and is visibly much wider than RJ-11. Figure 16.9 shows the posi-
tion of the #1 and #8 pins on an RJ-45 jack.
The TIA/EIA has two standards for connecting the RJ-45 connector to
the UTP cable: the TIA/EIA 568A and the TIA/EIA 568B. Both are accept-
able. You do not have to follow any standard as long as you use the same
pairings on each end of the cable; however, you will make your life simpler
if you choose a standard. Make sure that all of your cabling uses the same
standard and you will save a great deal of work in the end. Most impor-
tantly, keep records!
Like all wires, the wires in UTP are numbered. However, a number does
not appear on each wire. Instead, each wire has a standardized color. Table 16.1
shows the official TIA/EIA Standard Color Chart for UTP.
Multispeed Cards
All
Ethernet
networks share the same lan-
guage, so you can easily have
mixed or combined networks. All
it takes is a network card capable
of running at multiple speeds or
even over multiple cables. Most
NICs built into motherboards to-
day, for example, are Gigabit
autosensing cards (Figure 16.10).
If you plug into a 100BaseT net-
work, they automatically run at
100 Mbps. If you plug into a
1000 Mbps network, they quickly
ramp up and run at 1000 Mbps.

Tech Tip
Plenum versus PVC Cabling
Most workplace installations of network cable go up above the ceiling and then drop
down through the walls to present a nice port in the wall. The space in the ceiling, un-
der the floors, and in the walls through which cable runs is called the plenum space.
The potential problem with this cabling running through the plenum space is that the
protective sheathing for networking cables, called the jacket, is made from plastic, and
if you get any plastic hot enough, it creates smoke and noxious fumes. Standard net-
work cables usually use PVC (polyvinyl chloride) for the jacket, but PVC produces
noxious fumes when burned. Fumes from cables burning in the plenum space can
quickly spread throughout the building, so you want to use a more fire-retardant cable
in the plenum space. Plenum-grade cable is simply network cabling with a fire-
retardant jacket and is required for cables that go in the plenum space. Plenum-grade
cable costs about three to five times more than PVC, but you should use it whenever
you install cable in a plenum space.

Duplex and Half-Duplex
All modern NICs can run in full-duplex mode,
meaning they can send and receive data at the same time. The vast majority
of NICs and switches use a feature called autosensing to accommodate very
old devices that might attach to the network and need to run in half-duplex
mode. Half-duplex means that the device can send and receive, but not at
the same time. An obvious example of a half-duplex device is the walkie-
talkies you played with as a kid that required you to press and hold the or-
ange button to transmit—at which time you couldn’t hear anything. Half-
duplex devices are exceedingly rare in modern computers, but you need to
understand this option. Some NICs just can’t handle full-duplex communi-
cation when you plug them directly into another NIC by using a crossover
cable—that is, no switch. Dropping both NICs down from full-duplex or
autosensing can sometimes enable these odd NICs to communicate.
Link Lights
All NICs made today have some type of light-
emitting diode (LED) status indicator that gives information
about the state of the NIC’s link to whatever’s on the other end
of the connection. Even though you know the lights are actu-
ally LEDs, get used to calling them link lights, as that’s the term
all network techs use. NICs can have between one and four
different link lights, and the LEDs can be any color. These
lights give you clues about what’s happening with the link
and are one of the first items to check whenever you think a
system is disconnected from the network (Figure 16.11).
Hubs and switches also have link lights, enabling you to
check the connectivity at both ends of the cable. If a PC can’t
access a network, always first check the link lights. Multispeed
devices usually have a link light that tells you the speed of the
connection. In Figure 16.12, the light for port 2 on the top
photo is orange, for example, signifying that the other end of
the cable is plugged into either a 10BaseT or 100BaseT NIC.
The same port connected to a Gigabit NIC—that’s the lower
picture—displays a green LED.

Tech Tip
Crossover Cables
You can actually hook two net-
work cards together without a
hub by using a special UTP cable
called a crossover cable. A cross-
over cable is a standard UTP ca-
ble but with one RJ-45 connector
using the 568A standard and the
other using the 568B. This re-
verses the signal between sending
and receiving wires and thus does
the job of a hub or switch. Cross-
over cables work great as a quick
way to network two PCs. You
can purchase a crossover cable at
any computer store.
• Figure 16.11
Mmmm, pretty lights!

A properly functioning link light is steadily on when
the NIC is connected to another device. No flickering, no
on and off, just on. A link light that is off or flickering
shows a connection problem.
Another light is the activity light. This little guy turns
on when the card detects network traffic, so it makes an
intermittent flickering when operating properly. The ac-
tivity light is a lifesaver for detecting problems, because
in the real world, the connection light sometimes lies to
you. If the connection light says the connection is good,
the next step is to try to copy a file or do something else
to create network traffic. If the activity light does not
flicker, you have a problem.
No standard governs how NIC manufacturers use their lights; as a re-
sult, they come in an amazing array of colors and layouts. When you en-
counter a NIC with a number of LEDs, take a moment to try to figure out
what each one means. Although different NICs have different ways of ar-
ranging and using their LEDs, the functions are always the same: link, activ-
ity, and speed.
Fiber Optic Ethernet
Fiber optic cable is a very attractive way to transmit Ethernet network pack-
ets. First, because it uses light instead of electricity, fiber optic cable is im-
mune to electrical problems such as lightning, short circuits, and static.
Second, fiber optic signals travel much farther, up to 2000 meters (compared
with 100 meters on UTP) with some standards. Most fiber Ethernet net-
works use 62.5/125 multimode fiber optic cable. All fiber Ethernet networks
that use these cables require two cables. Figure 16.13 shows three of the
more common connectors used in fiber optic networks. Square SC connec-
tors are shown in the middle and on the right, and the round ST connector is
on the left.
Like many other fiber optic connectors, the SC and ST connectors are
half-duplex, meaning data flows only one way—hence the need for two ca-
bles in a fiber installation. Other half-duplex connectors you might run into
are FC/PC, SMA, D4, MU, and LC. They look similar to SC and ST connec-
tors but offer variations in size and connection. Newer
and higher-end fiber installations use full-duplex con-
nectors, such as the MT-RJ connectors.
The two most common fiber optic standards are
called 1000BaseSX and 10GBaseSR. The major difference
is the speed of the network (there are also some impor-
tant differences in the way systems interconnect, and so
on). Fiber optic cabling is delicate, expensive, and diffi-
cult to use, so it is usually reserved for use in data centers
and is rarely used to connect desktop PCs.
Coax/BNC
Early versions of Ethernet ran on coaxial cable instead of
UTP. Coax consists of a center cable (core) surrounded
by insulation. This in turn is covered with a shield of

should know that a solid green
light means connectivity, a flash-

tent connectivity, no green light
means no connectivity, and a

there are collisions on the net-
work (which is sometimes okay).
Also, know that the first things
you should check when having

braided cable. The inner core actually carries the signal. The shield effec-
tively eliminates outside interference. The entire cable is then surrounded
by a protective insulating cover. This type of coax looks like a skinny version
of the RG-59 or RG-6 coax used by your cable television, but it is quite differ-
ent. The RG rating is clearly marked on the cable. If it isn’t, the cable should
say something like “Thinnet” or “802.3” to let you know you have the right
cable. To connect the cable to individual machines, a twist-on BNC connector
is used.
Parallel/Serial
It would be unfair not to give at least a token nod to using the parallel or se-
rial ports on a pair of PCs to make a direct cable connection. All versions of
Windows have complete support for allowing two, and no more than two,
systems to network together, using either parallel or serial cables. You need
crossover versions of IEEE 1284 cables for parallel and RS-232 cables for se-
rial. These should be considered only as a last resort option, given the in-
credibly slow speeds of parallel and especially serial cable transmission
compared to that of Ethernet. You should never use direct cable connections
unless no other viable alternative exists.
FireWire
You can connect two computers by using FireWire cables. Apple designed
FireWire to be network aware, so the two machines will simply recognize
each other and, assuming they’re configured to share files and folders,
you’re up and running.
USB
You can also connect two computers by using USB, but it’s not quite as ele-
gant as FireWire. The most common way is to plug a USB NIC into each PC
and then run a UTP crossover cable between the Ethernet ports. You also
can buy a special USB crossover cable to connect the two machines. Finally,
at least one company makes a product that enables you to connect with a
normal USB cable, called USB Duet.
■Network Organization
Apart from the various physical media used to connect networks and the
methods used to transmit data through them, all networks can be broken
down into three basic organizational groups: client/server, peer-to-peer,
and domain-based. Let’s take a look at traditional network organization.
Client/Server
In a client/server network, one machine is dedicated as a resource to be
shared over the network. This machine will have a dedicated network oper-
ating system (NOS), optimized for sharing files. This special OS includes
powerful caching software that enables high-speed file access. It will have
extremely high levels of protection and an organization that permits

Tech Tip
Multimode
and Single-Mode
Light can be sent down a fiber
optic cable as regular light or as
laser light. Each type of light re-
quires totally different fiber optic
cables. Most network technologies
that use fiber optics use light-
emitting diodes (LEDs) to send
light signals. These use
multimode fiber optic cabling.
Multimode fiber transmits multi-
ple light signals at the same time,
each using a different reflection
angle within the core of the cable.
The multiple reflection angles
tend to disperse over long dis-
tances, so multimode fiber optic
cables are used for relatively short
distances.
Network technologies that use
laser light use single-mode fiber
optic cabling. Using laser light
and single-mode fiber optic cables
allows for phenomenally high
transfer rates over long distances.
Except for long-distance links,
single-mode is currently quite
rare; if you see fiber optic cabling,
you can be relatively sure it is
multimode.

extensive control of the data. This machine is called a dedicated server. All of
the other machines that use the data are called clients (because it’s what they
usually are) or workstations.
The client/server system dedicates one machine to act as a server, whose
purpose is to serve up resources to the other machines on the network.
These servers do not run Windows XP or Vista. They use highly sophisti-
cated and expensive NOSes that are optimized for the sharing and adminis-
tration of network resources. Dedicated server operating systems include
Windows Server 2008, big UNIX systems such as IBM AIX and HP-UX, and
some versions of Linux.
Peer-to-Peer
Some networks do not require dedicated servers—every computer can per-
form both server and client functions. A peer-to-peer network enables any or
all of the machines on the network to act as a server. Peer-to-peer networks
are much cheaper than client/server networks because the software costs
less and does not require that you purchase a high-end machine to act as the
dedicated server. The most popular peer-to-peer NOSes today are the vari-
ous versions of Windows and Macintosh OS X.
The biggest limiting factor to peer-to-peer networking is that it’s simply
not designed for a large number of computers. Windows has a built-in limit
(ten) to the number of users who can concurrently access a shared file or
folder. Microsoft recommends that peer-to-peer workgroups not exceed
15 PCs. Beyond that, creating a domain-based network makes more sense
(see the following section).
Security is the other big weakness of peer-
to-peer networks. Each system on a peer-to-
peer network maintains its own security.
With the Windows Professional/Business
versions, you can tighten security by setting
NTFS permissions locally, but you are still re-
quired to place a local account on every system
for any user who’s going to access resources.
So even though you get better security in a
Windows Professional/Business peer-to-peer
network, system administration entails a lot of
running around to individual systems to create
and delete local users every time someone joins
or leaves the workgroup. In a word: bleh.
Peer-to-peer workgroups are little more
than a pretty way to organize systems to make
navigating through Windows networks a little
easier (Figure 16.14). In reality, workgroups
have no security value. Still, if your network-
ing needs are limited—such as a small home
network—peer-to-peer networking is an easy
and cheap solution.
Chapter 16: Learning Local Area Networking
531
The terms client and server
are, to say the least, freely used
in the Windows world. Keep in
mind that a client generally refers
to any process (or in this context,
computer system) that can re-
quest a resource or service, and a
server is any process (or system)
that can fulfill the request.
• Figure 16.14
Multiple workgroups in a network

Domain-Based
One of the similarities between the
client/server network model and
peer-to-peer networks is that each
PC in the network maintains its own
list of user accounts. If you want to
access a server, you must log on.
When only one server exists, the
logon process takes only a second
and works very well. The trouble
comes when your network contains
multiple servers. In that case, every
time you access a different server,
you must repeat the logon process
(Figure 16.15). In larger networks
containing many servers, this be-
comes a time-consuming nightmare
not only for the user, but also for the
network administrator.
A
domain-based
network
pro-
vides an excellent solution for the
problem of multiple logins. In a
domain-based environment, one or
more dedicated servers called domain
controllers hold the security database
for all systems. This database holds a
list of all users and passwords in the
domain. When you log on to your
computer or to any computer, the
logon request goes to an available
domain controller to verify the ac-
count and password (Figure 16.16).
Modern domain-based networks use what is called a directory service to
store user and computer account information. Large Microsoft-based net-
works use the Active Directory (AD) directory service. Think of a directory
service as a big, centralized index, similar to a telephone book, that each PC
accesses to locate resources in the domain.
Server versions of Microsoft
Windows look and act similar to
the workstation versions, but they
come with extra networking capa-
bilities, services, and tools so they
can take on the role of domain
controller, file server, remote access
services (RAS) server, application
server, Web server, and so on. A

Every Windows system contains a special account called the
administrator account. This one account has complete and absolute
power over the entire system. When you install Windows, you
must create a password for the administrator account. Anyone
who knows the administrator password can install/delete any
program, read/change/delete any file, run any program, and
change any system setting. As you might imagine, you should
protect the administrator password carefully. Without it, you can-
not create additional accounts (including additional accounts with
administrative privileges) or change system settings. If you lose
the administrator password (and no other account with adminis-
trative privileges exists), you have to reinstall Windows com-
pletely to create a new administrator account—so don’t lose it!
In Windows XP, open the Properties window for My Computer
and select the Computer Name tab, as shown in Figure 16.19. This
shows your current selection. Windows Vista and 7 show the com-
puter name right on the System Properties dialog box and give you
a link to the 2000/XP-style dialog box (Figure 16.20). Clicking the
Network ID button opens the Network Identification Wizard, but
most techs just use the Change button, which brings up the Com-
puter Name/Domain Changes dialog box (Figure 16.21). Clicking
the Change button does the same thing as clicking the Network ID
button except that the wizard does a lot of explaining that you don’t

need if you know what you want to do. Make sure you have a valid do-
main account or you won’t be able to log in to a domain.
At this point, you’ve prepared the OS to network in general, but
now you need to talk to the specific hardware. For that, you need to
load protocols.
Protocols
Simply moving data from one machine to another is hardly sufficient
to make a complete network; many other functions need to be handled.
For example, if a file is being copied from one machine to another,
something must keep track of all of the packets so the file can be prop-
erly reassembled. If many machines are talking to the same machine at
once, that machine must somehow keep track of which packets it sends
to or receives from each of the other PCs.
Another issue arises if one of the machines in the network has its
network card replaced. Up to this point, the only way to distinguish
one machine from another was by the MAC address on the network
card. To solve this, each machine must have a name, an identifier for
the network, which is “above” the MAC address. Each machine, or at
least one of them, needs to keep a list of all of the MAC addresses on the net-
work and the names of the machines, so that packets and names can be cor-
related. That way, if a PC’s network card is replaced, the network, after
some special queries, can update the list to associate the name of the PC with
its new network card’s MAC address.
Network protocol software takes the incoming data received by the net-
work card, keeps it organized, sends it to the application that needs it, and
then takes outgoing data from the application and hands it to the NIC to be
sent out over the network. All networks use some protocol. Although many
protocols exist, one dominates the world of PCs—TCP/IP.
NetBEUI/NetBIOS
Before we talk about TCP/IP, we need to discuss a little history. During the
1980s, IBM developed NetBIOS Extended User Interface (NetBEUI), the de-
fault protocol for Windows for Workgroups, LANtastic, and Windows 95.
NetBEUI offers small size, easy configuration, and a relatively high speed,
but it can’t be used for routing. Its inability to handle routing limits NetBEUI
to networks smaller than about 200 nodes.
You can connect multiple smaller networks into a bigger network, turn-
ing a group of LANs into one big WAN, but this raises a couple of issues
with network traffic. A computer needs to be able to address a packet so that
it goes to a computer within its own LAN or to a computer in another LAN
in the WAN. If every computer saw every packet, the network traffic would
quickly spin out of control! Plus, the machines that connect the LANs—
called routers—need to be able to sort those packets and send them along to
the proper LAN. This process, called routing, requires routers and a routing-
capable protocol to function correctly.
NetBEUI was great for a LAN, but it lacked the extra addressing capabil-
ities needed for a WAN. A new protocol was needed, one that could handle
routing.

A node is any device that has
a network connection—usually
this means a PC, but other de-
vices can be nodes. For exam-
ple, many printers now connect
directly to a network and can
therefore be deemed nodes.
I use the term node extensively
in the rest of the chapter in place
of PC or networked computer.
This is especially true when I talk
about wireless technologies, be-
cause that’s the term the manu-
facturers use.

TCP/IP
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) was originally devel-
oped for the Internet’s progenitor, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Net-
work (ARPANET) of the U.S. Department of Defense. In 1983, TCP/IP
became the built-in protocol for the popular BSD (Berkeley Software Distri-
bution) UNIX, and other flavors of UNIX quickly adopted it as well. TCP/IP
is the best protocol for larger networks with more than 200 nodes. The big-
gest network of all, the Internet, uses TCP/IP as its protocol. Windows also
uses TCP/IP as its default protocol.
■Configuring TCP/IP
TCP/IP is the primary protocol of most modern networks, including the
Internet. For a PC to access the Internet, it must have TCP/IP loaded and
configured properly. TCP/IP has become so predominant that most net-
work folks use it even on networks that do not connect to the Internet. So
whether you are installing a modem for a dial-up connection to the Internet
or setting up 500 computers on their own private intranet, you must under-
stand some TCP/IP basics. Although TCP/IP is powerful, it is a bit of a chal-
lenge to set up. This section first guides you through the basic components
of the protocol, after which you’ll look at specific TCP/IP settings and what
they do.
Network Addressing
Any network address must provide two pieces of information: it must
uniquely identify the machine and it must locate that machine within the
larger network. In a TCP/IP network, the IP address identifies the PC and
the network on which it resides.
IP Addresses
In a TCP/IP network, the sys-
tems don’t have names but
rather use IP addresses. The IP
address is the unique identifica-
tion number for your system on
the network. Part of the address
identifies the network, and part
identifies the local computer
(host) address on the network.
IP addresses consist of four sets
of eight binary numbers (octets),
each set separated by a period.
This is called dotted-decimal nota-
tion. So, instead of a computer
being called SERVER1, it gets an
address like so:
202.34.16.11
536
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Novell developed the
Internetwork Packet Exchange/
Sequenced Packet Exchange
(IPX/SPX) protocol exclusively
for its NetWare products. The
IPX/SPX protocol is speedy,
works well with routers, and
takes up relatively little RAM
when loaded. Although once
popular, it has all but disap-
peared in favor of TCP/IP.
Microsoft implements a version
of IPX/SPX called NWLink.
Tech Tip
IPv6
The IP addresses I’m showing you here are technically IP version 4, or IPv4, ad-
dresses, but this type of addressing has a bit of a problem—namely, that we’re run-
ning out of possible IP addresses, and there won’t be any left in a few years. No big
deal. Now, before you go running out into the streets shouting about the impending
demise of the Internet or start hoarding canned food in your basement, let me tell you
about the solution. IP version 6, the newest version of the Internet protocol, which
will save us all from an Internetless world, uses a 128-bit address instead of IPv4’s
32-bit address. What this means is that there are more possible addresses than with
IPv4. A lot more. My favorite illustration is to think of all of the molecules that make
up the Earth, and divide them by 7. That’s how many possible IPv6 addresses there
are. The drawback is that IPv6 addresses are not quite as svelte and easy to remember
as in IPv4. For example, an IPv6 address looks like this: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:
8a2e:0370:7334. Not quite as easy to work with as 192.168.1.1, eh? IPv6 also handles
routing and various other things differently than IPv4, but the main things to know
are that the IP addresses look remarkably different and there are enough of them to last
for a while. There’s no solid plan yet for when everyone is going to switch to IPv6, but
it’ll be a big change when it happens.

Written in binary form, the address would look like this:
11001010.00100010.00010000.00001011
To make the addresses more comprehensible to users, the TCP/IP folks
decided to write the decimal equivalents:
00000000 = 0
00000001 = 1
00000010 = 2
...
11111111 = 255
IP addresses are divided into class licenses that correspond with the po-
tential size of the network: Class A, Class B, and Class C. Class A licenses
were intended for huge companies and organizations, such as major multi-
national corporations, universities, and governmental agencies. Class B li-
censes were assigned to medium-size companies, and Class C licenses were
designated for smaller LANs. Class A networks use the first octet to identify
the network address and the remaining three octets to identify the host.
Class B networks use the first two
octets to identify the network ad-
dress and the remaining two oc-
tets to identify the host. Class C
networks use the first three octets
to identify the network address
and the last octet to identify the
host. Table 16.2 lists range (class)
assignments.
You’ll note that the IP address ranges listed in Table 16.2 skip from
126.x.x.x to 128.x.x.x. That’s because the 127 address range (that is,
127.0.0.1–127.255.255.255) is reserved for network testing (loopback) opera-
tions. (We usually just use the address 127.0.0.1 for loopback purposes and
call it the localhost address, but any address that starts off with 127 will work
just as well.) That’s not the only reserved range, either! Each network class
has a specific IP address range reserved for private networks—traffic from
these networks doesn’t get routed to the Internet at large. Class A’s private
range goes from 10.0.0.1 to 10.255.255.255. Class B has two private address
ranges: 172.16.0.1 up to 172.16.255.255 for manually configured addresses
and 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254 (link-local addresses). Class C’s private
addresses range from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255.
Subnet Mask
The subnet mask is a value that distinguishes which part of the IP address is
the network address and which part of the address is the host address. The
subnet mask blocks out (or masks) the network portions (octets) of an IP ad-
dress. Certain subnet masks are applied by default. The default subnet mask
for Class A addresses is 255.0.0.0; for Class B, it’s 255.255.0.0; and for Class C,
255.255.255.0. For example, in the Class B IP address 131.190.4.121 with a
subnet mask of 255.255.0.0, the first two octets (131.190) make up the net-
work address, and the last two (4.121) make up the host address.

Pinging the loopback is the

working properly. To test a NIC’s
loopback, the other end of the

vice such as a loopback adapter/
plug.
The CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam does not require you to
break down IP addresses and
subnet masks into their binary
equivalents or to deal with non-
standard subnet masks such as
255.255.240.0, but you should
know what IP addresses and
subnet masks are and how to
configure your PC to connect to
a TCP/IP network.

A New Kind of Port
The term “port” has several mean-
ings in the computer world. Com-
monly, port defines the connector
socket on an Ethernet NIC, where
you insert an RJ-45 jack. That’s how
I’ve used the term for the most part
in this book. It’s now time to see an-
other use of the word port.
In TCP/IP, ports are 16-bit numbers between 0 and 65,535, assigned to a
particular TCP/IP session. All TCP/IP packets (except for some really low-
level maintenance packets) contain port numbers that the two communicat-
ing computers use to determine not only the kind of session—and thus what
software protocol—to use to handle the data in the packet, but also how to
get the packet or response back to the sending computer.
Each packet has two ports assigned, a destination port and an ephemeral
port. The destination port is a fixed, predetermined number that defines the
function or session type. Common TCP/IP session types use destination
port numbers in the range 0–1023. The ephemeral port is an arbitrary number
generated by the sending computer; the receiving computer uses the
ephemeral port as a destination address so that the sending computer
knows which application to use for the returning packet. Ephemeral ports
usually fall in the 1024–5000 range, but this varies slightly among the differ-
ent operating systems.
Ports enable one computer to serve many different services, such as a Web
server and e-mail server, at the same time. We will discuss the most common
ports and the associated services in Chapter 18, “Learning the Internet.”
TCP/IP Services
TCP/IP is a different type of protocol. It adds a number of special sharing
functions unique only to it, lumped together under the umbrella term TCP/
IP services. The most famous
TCP/IP service is called Hyper-
text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the
language of the World Wide
Web. If you want to surf the Web,
you must have TCP/IP. But
TCP/IP supplies many other ser-
vices beyond just HTTP. By us-
ing a service called Telnet, for
example, you can access a re-
mote system as though you were
actually in front of that machine.
Another example is a handy
utility called PING. PING enables
one machine to check whether it
can communicate with another
machine. Figure 16.22 shows an
example of PING running on a

teresting that many TCP/IP ser-
vices

how to access one! I’ll show you
other services in a moment.
The goal of TCP/IP is to link
any two hosts (remember, a host is
just a computer in TCP/IP lingo),
whether the two computers are on
the same LAN or on some other
network within the WAN. The
LANs within the WAN are linked
together with a variety of connec-
tions, ranging from basic dial-up
connections
to
dedicated
high-
speed (and expensive) data lines
(Figure 16.23). To move traffic be-
tween networks, you use routers
(Figure 16.24). Each host sends traf-
fic to the router only when that data
is destined for a remote network, cutting down on traffic
across the more expensive WAN links. The host makes
these decisions based on the destination IP address of
each packet.
TCP/IP Settings
TCP/IP has a number of unique settings that you must
set up correctly to ensure proper network functioning.
Unfortunately, these settings can be quite
confusing, and there are quite a few of them.
Not all settings are used for every type of
TCP/IP network, and it’s not always obvi-
ous where you go to set them.
Windows makes this fairly easy by let-
ting you configure both dial-up and net-
work connections by using the Network
Connections dialog box (Figure 16.25). To
get there, right-click My Network Places
(Windows 2000/XP) or Network (Windows
Vista/7) and select Properties. In Vista/7,
you have to click the Manage network connec-
tions button, but in 2000 and XP, you simply
select the connection you wish to configure
and then set its TCP/IP properties. Win-
dows labels most wired networks Local
Area Connection, so that’s probably the one
you should look for.
The CompTIA A+ Essentials exam as-
sumes that someone else, such as a tech

support person or some network guru, will tell you the correct TCP/IP set-
tings for the network. Your only job is to understand roughly what they do
and to know where to enter them so the system works. Following are some
of the most common TCP/IP settings.
Configuring TCP/IP
By default, TCP/IP is configured to receive an IP address automatically
from a DHCP server on the network (and automatically assign a corre-
sponding subnet mask). As far as the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam is con-
cerned, Network+ techs and administrators give you the IP address, subnet
mask, and default gateway information and you plug them into the PC.
That’s about it, so here’s how to do it manually:
1.
In Windows XP, open the Control Panel and double-click the
Network Connections applet. Double-click the Local Area
Connection icon. In Windows 2000, click Start | Settings | Network
and Dial-up Connections, and double-click the Local Area
Connection icon. In Windows Vista/7, right-click on Network and
then click Manage network connections. After that, double-click the
Local Area Network icon.
2.
Click the Properties button, highlight Internet Protocol (TCP/IP),
and click the Properties button. In Windows Vista/7, you should
highlight Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) because Vista and
7 both have IPv4 and IPv6 installed by default.
3.
In the dialog box, click the radio button next to Use the following IP
address.
4.
Enter the IP address in the appropriate fields.
5.
Press the TAB key to skip down to the Subnet mask field. Note that the
subnet mask is entered automatically, although you can type over this
if you want to enter a different subnet mask (see Figure 16.26).
6.
Optionally, enter the IP address for a default gateway
(a router or another computer system that will forward
transmissions beyond your network).
7.
Optionally, enter the IP addresses of a primary and a
secondary DNS server.
8.
Click the OK button to close the dialog box.
9.
Click the Close button to exit the Local Area Connection
Status dialog box.
10.
Windows will alert you that you must restart the system
for the changes to take effect.
Default Gateway
A computer that wants to send data to another machine outside its
LAN is not expected to know exactly how to reach every other com-
puter on the Internet. Instead, all IP hosts know the address of at
least one router to which they pass all of the data packets they need
to send outside the LAN. This router is called the default gateway,
which is just another way of saying “the local router” (Figure 16.27).

Setting up IP

Domain Name Service (DNS)
Knowing that users could not remember lots of IP ad-
dresses, early Internet pioneers came up with a way
to correlate those numbers with more human-
friendly computer designations. Special computers,
called domain name service (DNS) servers, keep data-
bases of IP addresses and their corresponding names.
For example, a machine called TOTALSEMINAR1
will be listed in a DNS directory with a corresponding
IP address, such as 209.34.45.163. So instead of access-
ing the \\209.34.45.163\FREDC share to copy a file,
you can ask to see \\TOTALSEMINAR1\FREDC.
Your system will then query the DNS server to get
TOTALSEMINAR1’s IP address and use that to find
the right machine. Unless you want to type in IP ad-
dresses all the time, a TCP/IP network will need at
least one DNS server (Figure 16.28).
The Internet has regulated domain names. If you
want a domain name that others can access on the
Internet, you must register your domain name and
pay a small yearly fee. In most cases, your ISP can
handle this for you. Originally, DNS names all ended
with one of the following seven domain name qualifi-
ers, called top-level domains (TLDs):
.com General business
.org Nonprofit organizations
.edu Educational organizations .gov Government organizations
.mil Military organizations
.net Internet organizations
.int International
As more and more countries joined the Internet, an entire
new level of domains was added to the original seven to indi-
cate a DNS name in a particular country, such as .uk for the
United Kingdom. It’s common to see DNS names such as
www.bbc.co.uk or www.louvre.fr. The Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announced the creation
of several more new domains, including .name, .biz, .info, and
others. Given the explosive growth of the Internet, these are
unlikely to be the last ones! For the latest developments, check
ICANN’s Web site at www.icann.org.
WINS
Before Microsoft came fully on board with Internet standards
such as TCP/IP, the company implemented its own type of
name server: Windows Internet Name Service (WINS). WINS en-
ables NetBIOS network names such as SERVER1 to be correlated to IP ad-
dresses, just as DNS does, except these names are Windows network names
such as SERVER1, not fully qualified domain Internet names (FQDNs) such
as server1.example.com. NetBIOS names must be unique and contain 15 or
fewer characters, but other than that there isn’t much to it. Assuming that a

WINS server exists on your network, all you have to
do to set up WINS on your PC is type in the IP address
for the WINS server (Figure 16.29). Networks based
on Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7 don’t use WINS; they
use an improved “dynamic” DNS (DDNS) that sup-
ports both Internet names and Windows names. On
older networks that still need to support the occa-
sional legacy Windows NT 4.0 server, you may need
to configure WINS, but on most TCP/IP networks
you can leave the WINS setting blank.
DHCP
The last feature that most TCP/IP networks support
is dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP). To un-
derstand DHCP, you must first remember that every
machine must be assigned an IP address, a subnet
mask, a default gateway, and at least one DNS server
(and maybe a WINS server). These settings can be
added manually by using the TCP/IP Properties win-
dow. When you set the IP address manually, the IP
address will not change and is called a static IP ad-
dress (Figure 16.30).
DHCP enables you to create a pool of IP addresses that are given tempo-
rarily to machines. DHCP is especially handy for networks of a lot of laptops
that join and leave the network on a regular basis. Why give a machine that is
on the network for only a few hours a day a static IP address? For that reason,
DHCP is quite popular. If you add a NIC to a Windows system, the default
TCP/IP settings are set to use DHCP. When you accept those automatic set-
tings, you’re really telling the machine to use DHCP (Figure 16.31).

■Troubleshooting Networks
Once you go beyond a single PC and enter the realm of networked comput-
ers, your troubleshooting skills need to take a giant leap up in quality. Think
of the complexity added with networks. Suddenly you have multiple PCs
with multiple users who could, at the drop of a hat, do all kinds of inadver-
tent damage to a fully functional PC. Networked PCs have a layer of net-
worked hardware and resource sharing that adds a completely new
dimension to a user’s cry for help, “I can’t print!”
Where can the problem lie in a non-networked situation if a person cannot
print? Here are the obvious ones:
■
Printer is not connected to the PC.
■
Printer is out of ink.
■
PC doesn’t have the proper driver loaded.
■
PC points by default to a printer other than the one that the user
thinks should print.
That’s about it. Maybe the parallel port configuration is wrong in CMOS
or the USB drivers aren’t correct, but still.… Now do the same thing with a
networked situation where a user can’t print. Here are the obvious extra is-
sues, because all of the local machine issues apply as well:
■
Print server is down.
■
Printer is locked by another user.
■
The client PC doesn’t have network connectivity.
■
The NIC driver is bad or incorrect.
■
The client PC doesn’t have the proper printer drivers installed for
the networked printer.
■
The cable between the client PC’s NIC and the nearest switch is bad.
■
The port to which the cable connects is bad.
■
The switch failed.
■
Somebody in an office down the hall spilled coffee on the printer,
inside the mechanism, and then didn’t fess up to the accident.
That’s a lot of variables, and they just scratch the surface of possibilities.
You live in a networked world—it’s time to elevate your troubleshooting
skills and methodologies to the next level. This section offers a series of steps
you can use when performing any type of PC or network troubleshooting.
You’ll look at ways to apply your tech skills and general communication
skills to get to the bottom of a problem and get that problem fixed.
Verify the Symptom
The one thing that all PC problems have in common is a symptom. If some-
thing odd wasn’t happening (or not happening) to users as they tried to do
whatever they need to do on their computers, you wouldn’t have a problem
at all, would you? Unfortunately, the vast majority of users out there aren’t
CompTIA A+ certified technicians. As a tech, you need to overcome a rather
Chapter 16: Learning Local Area Networking
543
The “Troubleshooting Net-
works” section covers a range
of questions you’re likely to
see on the “Operational Proce-
dure” exam domain. See also
Chapter 20, “The Complete PC
Technician,” for more on
the topic.

nasty communication gap before you can begin to consider a fix. Let’s
bridge that gap right now.
It usually starts with a phone call:
You: “Tech Support, this is Mike. How can I help you?”
User: “Uh, hi, Mike. This is Tom over in Accounting. I can’t get into the
network. Can you help me?”
Tom just started over in the Accounting department this week and has
been a pain in the rear end so far. Ah, the things you might want to say to
this person: “No. I only help non-pain-in-the-rear accountants.” Or how
about this? “Let me check my appointment schedule.… Ah, yes. I can check
on your problem in two weeks. Monday at 4:00 P.M. okay for you?”
But, of course, you had the audacity to choose the beloved profession of IT
tech support, so you don’t get to say the things that you might want to say.
Rather, you need to take a position of leadership and get to the bottom of the
problem, and that means understanding the symptom. Take a deep breath,
smile, and get to work. You have two issues to deal with at this point. First, if
you’re working with a user, you must try to get the user to describe the symp-
tom. Second, whether you’re working on a system alone or you’re talking to a
user on the telephone, you must verify that the symptom is legitimate.
Getting a user to describe a symptom is often a challenge. Users are not
techs and as a result their perception of the PC is very different than yours.
But by the same token, most users know a bit about PCs, and you want to
take advantage of a user’s skill and experience whenever you can. A per-
sonal example of verifying the symptom: Once I got a call from a user telling
me that his “screen was blank.” I told him to restart his system. To which he
responded, “Shouldn’t I shut down the PC first?” I said, “I thought you just
told me the screen was blank!” He replied, “That’s right. There’s nothing on
the screen but my desktop.”
When Does It Happen?
Once you know the symptom, you need to try to inspect the problem your-
self. This doesn’t mean you need to go to the system; many real problems are
easily fixed by the user, under your supervision. But you must understand
when the problem occurs so that you can zero in on where to look for the so-
lution. Does it happen at boot? It might be a CMOS/BIOS issue. Is it taking
place as the OS loads? Then you need to start checking initialization files.
Does it take place when the system runs untouched for a certain amount of
time? Then maybe the power management could come into play.
What Has Changed?
Systems that run properly tend to continue to run properly. Systems that
have undergone a hardware or software change have a much higher chance
of not running properly than a system that has not been changed. If some-
thing has gone wrong, talk to the user to determine whether anything in
particular has occurred since the system last worked properly. Has new
software been installed? Did the user add some new RAM? Change the
Windows Domain? Run a Windows Update? Drop the monitor on the floor?
Not only do you need to consider those types of changes, but you must also
make sure that any unrelated changes don’t send you down the wrong path.
544
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Look for lots of questions on
communication with users on
the Essentials exam.

The fact that someone installed a new floppy drive yesterday probably
doesn’t have anything to do with the printer that isn’t working today.
Last, consider side effects of changes that don’t seem to have anything to
do with the problem. For example, I once had a customer whose system kept
freezing up in Windows. I knew he had just added a second hard drive, but
the system booted up just fine and ran normally—except it would freeze up
after a few minutes. The hard drive wasn’t the problem. The problem was
that he unplugged the CPU fan in the process of installing it. When I discover
a change has been made, I like to visualize the process of the change to con-
sider how that change may have directly or indirectly contributed to a prob-
lem. In other words, if you run into a situation where a person added a NIC to
a functioning PC that now won’t boot, you need to think about what part of
the installation process could be fouled up to cause a PC to stop working.
Check the Environment
I use the term environment in two totally different fashions in this book. The
first way is the most classic definition: the heat, humidity, dirt, and other out-
side factors that can affect the operation of the system. The other definition is
more technical and addresses the computing environment of the system and
other surrounding systems: What type of system do they run? What OS?
What is their network connection? What are the primary applications they
use? What antivirus program do they run? Do other people use the system?
Answering these questions gives you an overview of what is affecting
this system both internally and externally. A quick rundown of these issues
can reveal possible problems that might not be otherwise recognized. For
example, I once got a call from a user complaining she had no network con-
nection. I first checked the NIC to ensure it had link lights (always the first
thing to check to ensure a good physical connection!) only to discover that
she had no link lightssomeone had decided to turn on a space heater,
which destroyed the cable!
Reproducing the Problem
My official rule on problems with a PC is this: “If a problem happens only
once, it is not a problem.” PCs are notorious for occasionally locking up,
popping errors, and displaying all types of little quirks that a quick reboot
fixes, and they don’t happen again. Why do these things happen? I don’t
know, although I’m sure if someone wanted me to guess I could come up
with a clever explanation. But the majority of PCs simply don’t have redun-
dancy built in, and it’s okay for them to occasionally hiccup.
A problem becomes interesting to me if it happens more than once. If it
happens twice, the chances are much higher that it will happen a third time.
I want to see it happen that third time—under my supervision. I will direct
the user to try to reproduce the problem while I am watching to see what trig-
gers the failure. This is a huge clue to helping you localize the real problem. In-
termittent failures are the single most frustrating events that take place in a
technician’s life. But do remember that many seemingly intermittent problems
really aren’t intermittent—you have simply failed to reproduce the events ex-
actly enough to see the consistency of the problem. Always take the time to
match every step that leads to a problem to try to re-create the same error.
Chapter 16: Learning Local Area Networking
545

Isolating the Symptom
With so many bits and pieces to a PC, you must take the time to try to isolate
the symptom to ensure your fix is going to the software or hardware that re-
ally needs it. In hardware, that usually means removing suspect parts until
only one possible part remains. In software, that usually means removing
background programs, booting into Safe Mode, or trying to create a situa-
tion where only the suspected program is running.
Isolation takes on a whole new meaning with networks. One of the greatest
tools in networking is isolation—does this problem happen on other systems,
on other workgroups, on other PCs running DHCP? Whenever a problem
takes place in networking, isolation is the key to determining the problem.
Separating Hardware from Software
Many problems that occur on a PC are difficult to isolate given that it is diffi-
cult to determine whether the problem lies in the software or the hardware.
If you find yourself in this situation, you can take a few steps to help you
zero in on which side of the PC to suspect.
Known Good Hardware
The absolute best way to know whether a problem is hardware or software
related is to replace the suspected piece of hardware with a known good part.
If you can’t tell whether a Windows page fault comes from bad RAM or a soft-
ware incompatibility, quickly replacing the RAM with known good RAM
should help you determine whether the RAM or the software is to blame.
Cable and Loopback Test
A bad NIC can also generate a “can’t see the network” problem. Use whatever
utility was provided with your OS to verify that the NIC works. If you have a
NIC with diagnostic software, run it—this software will check the NIC’s cir-
cuitry. The NIC’s female connector is a common failure point, so NICs that
come with diagnostic software often include a special test called a loopback
test. A loopback test sends data out of the NIC and checks to see if it comes
back. Some NICs perform only an internal loopback that tests the circuitry that
sends and receives, but not the actual connecting pins. A true external loopback
requires a loopback plug inserted into the NIC’s port (Figure 16.32). If a NIC is
bad, replace it—preferably with an identical NIC so you don’t have to reinstall
drivers.
The network cable is a common source of network troubles. You can use
a cable tester if you suspect a cable problem. With the right equipment, diag-
nosing a bad cabling run is easy. Anyone with a network should own a
midrange cable tester such as the Fluke MicroScanner. With a little practice,
you can easily determine not only whether a cable is disconnected, but also
where the disconnection takes place. Sometimes patience is required, espe-
cially if the cable runs aren’t labeled, but you will find the problem.
Uninstall/Reinstall
If you can do so easily, try uninstalling the suspected software and reinstall-
ing. Many hardware/software problems magically disappear with a simple
uninstall/reinstall.
546
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 16.32
Loopback plug

Patching/Upgrading
Many hardware or software problems take place due to incompatibilities
between the two suspect sides. Try upgrading drivers. Download patches
or upgrades to software, especially if the hardware and the software are
more than two years apart in age.
Virus Check
Last (maybe I should have put this first), always check for viruses. Today’s
viruses manifest so many different symptoms that failure to check for them
is a study in time wasting. I recently got a new hard drive that started to
make a nasty clicking noise—a sure sign of a failing hard drive. However, I
ran an extensive virus check and guess what—it was a virus! Who would
have thought? I checked with the hard drive maker’s Web site, and my fears
were confirmed. It just goes to show you—even the best of techs can be
caught by the simplest problems.
Research
Once you have your mind wrapped around the problem, it’s time to fix it. Un-
less the problem is either simple (network cable unplugged) or something
you’ve seen before and know exactly how to fix, you’ll almost certainly need
to research it. The Internet makes this easy. I use one of my favorite tricks
when I get some bizarre error text: I type the error message into my search
engine—that would be Google, of course—and most times find a quick fix!
Make the Fix and Test
Once you have a good idea as to the problem and how to fix it, it’s time to do
the fix. Always make backups—or at least warn the user of the risk to the
system. If possible, try to remember how the system was configured before
the fix so you can go back to square one if the fix fails to work. After you per-
form the fix, do whatever you need to do to make sure the system is again
working properly. Make sure the user sees that the system is working prop-
erly and can sign off on your work.
OSI Seven-Layer Model
A lot of people think about networks and troubleshoot networking issues by
using the OSI seven-layer model. Using this model (or my four-layer model,
described in the next section of this chapter) helps you isolate problems and
then implement solutions. Here are the seven layers of the OSI model:
■
Layer 1
Physical
■
Layer 2
Data Link
■
Layer 3
Network
■
Layer 4
Transport
■
Layer 5
Session
■
Layer 6
Presentation
■
Layer 7
Application
Chapter 16: Learning Local Area Networking
547

The Physical layer defines the physical form
taken by data when it travels across a cable. Devices
that work at the physical layer include NICs and
hubs. Figure 16.33 shows a sending NIC turning a
string of ones and zeros into an electrical signal, and
a receiving NIC turning it back into the same ones
and zeros.
The Data Link layer defines the rules for access-
ing and using the Physical layer. MAC addresses
and Ethernet’s CSMA/CD operate at the Data Link
layer.
The Network layer defines the rules for adding in-
formation to the data packet that controls how rout-
ers move it from its source on one network to its destination on a different
network. The IP protocol that handles IP addressing works on Layer 3.
The Transport layer, Layer 4, breaks up data it receives from the upper
layers (that is, Layers 5–7) into smaller pieces for transport within the data
packets created at the lower layers. In TCP/IP networks, the protocols that
typically handle this transition between upper and lower layers are TCP and
UDP.
The Session layer manages the connections between machines on the net-
work. Protocols such as NetBIOS and sockets enable a computer to connect
to a server, for example, and send and receive e-mail or download a file.
Each different task you can perform on a server would require a different
kind of session.
The Presentation layer presents data from the sending system in a form
that a receiving system can understand. Most Layer 6 functions are handled
by the same software that handles Layer 7 functions.
The Application layer is where you (or a user) get to interact with the com-
puters. These are programs that make networking happen, such as Web
browsers and e-mail applications. Chapter 18, “Learning the Internet,” cov-
ers these applications in a lot more detail.
The key to using the OSI seven-layer model is to ask the tradi-
tional troubleshooting question: what can the problem be? If Jill can’t
browse a Web site, for example, could this be a Layer 7 issue? Sure: if
her browser software was messed up, this could stop her from brows-
ing. It could also be a lower-level problem, though, and you need to
run through the questions. Can she do anything over the network? If
her NIC doesn’t show flashing link lights, that could point all the way
down to the Physical layer and a bad NIC, cable, or hub.
If she has good connectivity to the overall network but can’t ping
the Web server, that could point to a different problem altogether.
Figure 16.34 shows the OSI seven-layer model graphically.
The only drawback to the OSI seven-layer model, in my view, is
that it’s too complex. I like to conceptualize network issues into fewer
layers—four to be precise. Let’s take a look.
Mike’s Four-Layer Model
Network problems, by the very nature of the complexity of a net-
work, usually make for more complex problems. Given that, I have

are often called Layer 3 switches.

created a four-step process that I modestly call “Mike’s Four-Layer Model.”
These four things go through my mind every time I have a problem. I think
about four distinct categories to help me isolate the symptoms and make the
right fix.
Hardware
Hardware is probably the most self-explanatory of the four categories. This
covers the many ways data can be moved from one PC to another. Does the
system have a good connection? How’s the cabling? This also covers net-
work cards: are they installed properly and tested? Plus, the Hardware cate-
gory hits on all of those interesting boxes, such as hubs, switches, and
repeaters, among which all of the wires in the network run. If you can see it,
it’s under this category.
Protocols
This category covers the protocols, such as TCP/IP or NetBEUI. Is the proto-
col installed? Is it configured properly? Does any particular system’s config-
uration prevent it from working with another system?
Network
The network category has two parts: servers and clients. Network operating
systems must differentiate systems that act as server from those that do not.
If a system is a server, some process must take place to tell it to share re-
sources. Additionally, if a system is intended to share, it must be given a
name. This category also includes defining and verifying users and groups;
does your system need them? Do the right accounts exist, and are they
working properly?
Shared Resources
Once all of the systems, users, and groups are working properly, you need
to identify the resources they will share. If a drive or folder is to be shared,
the OS must provide a way to identify that drive or folder as available for
sharing. The rules for naming shared resources are called naming conven-
tions. A great example would be a system that offers its D:\FRED directory
for sharing. This D:\FRED directory needs a network name, such as FRED_
FILES. This network name is displayed to all of the devices on the network.
Sharing a resource is only half the battle. Individual systems need to be
able to access the shared resources. The network needs a process whereby a
PC can look out on the network and see what is available. Having found
those available resources, the PC then needs to make them look and act as
though they were local resources. A network also needs to control access to
resources. A laser printer, for example, might be available for sharing, but
only for the Accounting department, excluding other departments.

Chapter 16 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about local area networking.
Explain networking technologies
■
A PC connected to a network, called a client
machine, must have a NIC. The PC must be able to
initiate and carry out the exchange of data with
other client machines and with one or more server
machines, using either a cable or some type of
wireless transmission method.
■
The most common network topologies include bus,
ring, star, and mesh. Logical topology refers to
how the network is laid out on paper. Physical
topology refers to the actual hardware (clients,
servers, cables).
■
Data is sent in discrete chunks called packets or
frames. The built-in 48-bit MAC address, unique to
each NIC, is vital to the creation and function of
data packets. Each data packet includes certain
vital elements: the MAC of the recipient’s NIC, the
MAC of the sender’s NIC, the data itself, and a
CRC that enables the recipient to verify that the
data arrives intact.
■
A hardware protocol defines many aspects of a
network, from the packet type to the cabling and
connectors used—in short, everything necessary to
get data from one computer to another. The
hardware protocol that dominates the modern
computing landscape is Ethernet.
■
The two main types of Ethernet are based on the
cable type: UTP and fiber optic. All Ethernet uses
the same packet type, so any combination of
hardware devices and cabling systems can work
on an Ethernet network.
■
Most modern Ethernet networks use either
100BaseT or 1000BaseT, both of which use UTP
cable. 100BaseT runs at 100 Mbps; 1000BaseT runs
at 1000 Mbps (or 1 Gbps). These two technologies,
known collectively as 100/1000BaseT, use a star
bus topology, which employs hubs or switches
to make termination simpler and avoid the
vulnerabilities of a bus topology.
■
UTP cables come in different categories intended for
different uses. CAT 1 cable is standard phone wire.
Most UTP networks today use CAT 5e (maximum
speed 1 Gbps) or CAT 6 cable (maximum speed
10 Gbps). 100BaseT requires a minimum of CAT 5
(maximum speed 100 Mbps) to run, while
1000BaseT requires a minimum of CAT 5e.
■
UTP cables use the RJ-45 connector, which is
essentially a wider version of the familiar RJ-11
phone connector. Two TIA/EIA standards, 568A
and 568B, dictate acceptable ways to arrange the
eight UTP cable wires in an RJ-45 jack. You should
choose a wiring standard and stick with it to avoid
network headaches.
■
Standard network cables use PVC for the jacket,
which emits toxic fumes when burned. Plenum-
grade cables use a fire-retardant jacket and should
be used when cables are installed in a plenum space.
■
In an Ethernet network, each PC connects to a hub
or switch via one of the hub’s or switch’s ports. The
maximum distance from the hub or switch to a
connected device is 100 meters. Hubs and switches
act as repeaters, boosting signals as they pass on
data, so they require a reliable power source.
■
Fiber optic Ethernet transmits light instead of
electricity, achieving much greater maximum
distances than other forms of Ethernet. Most fiber
networks use LEDs to send light signals and use
multimode fiber optic cabling. Networks that use
laser light use single-mode fiber optic cabling.
Laser light and single-mode cabling are used most
often for very long distance connections.
■
Most fiber optic cables use one of two connectors:
the square SC type or the round ST type.
Explain network organization and protocols
■
The three types of network organization are client/
server, peer-to-peer, and domain-based. All
Windows PCs can function as network clients and
servers.
■
A client/server network dedicates one machine to
act as a server. The server has a dedicated NOS
optimized for sharing files, with powerful caching
software that enables high-speed file access,
550
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

extremely high levels of protection, and an
organization that permits extensive control of
the data.
■
A peer-to-peer network enables any or all of the
machines on the network to act as a server. Every
computer can perform both server and client
functions. A peer-to-peer network comprising
only client machines requires you to place a local
account on every system, which the system
administrator must add and delete individually.
■
In a domain-based network environment, the
security database for all systems is centralized
on one or more servers called domain controllers.
This database holds a single list of all users and
passwords. When you log on to any computer in
the network, the logon request goes to an available
domain controller for verification.
■
Every Windows system contains a very special
account called administrator that has complete and
absolute power over the entire system. When you
install Windows, you must create a password for
the administrator account. Anyone who knows the
administrator password has the ability to read any
file and run any program.
■
Network protocol software takes the incoming data
received by the network card, keeps it organized,
sends it to the application that needs it, and then
takes outgoing data from the application and
hands it to the NIC to be sent out over the network.
All networks use some protocol; most networks
today use TCP/IP.
■
IBM developed NetBEUI, the default protocol for
Windows for Workgroups, LANtastic, and
Windows 95. NetBEUI was small and relatively
high speed, but it couldn’t be used for routing.
Configure TCP/IP
■
Systems in a TCP/IP network use IP addresses
rather than names. IP addresses are four sets of
eight binary numbers (octets) separated by periods
(dotted-octet notation). The first part of the address
identifies the network; the second part identifies the
local computer (host) address. The subnet mask is a
value that distinguishes which part of the IP address
is the network address and which part is the host
address. The subnet mask blocks out (masks) the
network portions (octets) of an IP address.
■
A traditional TCP/IP network divides IP addresses
into classes, which correspond with the potential
size of the network: Class A, Class B, and Class C.
Class A networks use the first octet to identify the
network address, and the remaining three octets to
identify the host. Class B networks use two and
two. Class C networks use three and one.
■
TCP/IP adds a number of special sharing functions
unique only to it, called TCP/IP services, such as
HTTP, the language of the World Wide Web.
Another example is Telnet, which enables you
to access a remote system as though you were
actually in front of that machine.
■
TCP/IP uses a 16-bit number called a port number
to control the connection between two systems.
Each packet has two ports assigned, a destination
port and an ephemeral port. The destination port is
a fixed, predetermined number that defines the
type of server connected, such as port 80 for a Web
server. The ephemeral port is an arbitrary number
generated by the sending computer; the receiving
computer uses the ephemeral port as a destination
address so that the sending computer knows which
application to use for the returning packet.
■
The goal of TCP/IP is to link together multiple
LANs to make a WAN. You use routers to move
traffic between networks. Each host sends traffic to
the router only when that data is destined for a
remote network, cutting down on traffic across the
more expensive WAN links.
■
On a Windows system, you can configure both
dial-up and network connections by using the
Network Connections dialog box. Simply select the
connection you wish to configure, and then set its
TCP/IP properties.
■
A computer that wants to send data to a machine
outside its LAN is not expected to know all of the
IP addresses of all of the computers on the Internet.
Instead, all IP machines know the name of one
computer, called the default gateway, to which
they pass the data they need to send outside the
LAN. The default gateway is the local router.
■
DNS servers keep databases of IP addresses and
their corresponding names. Virtually all TCP/IP
networks require you to set up DNS server names.
■
If you want an Internet domain name that others can
access on the Internet, you must register your domain
name and pay a small yearly fee. Originally, DNS
names all ended with one of the following top-level
domains: .com, .org, .edu, .gov, .mil, .net, and .int.

■
DHCP automatically assigns IP address settings
(including IP, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS
servers, and WINS server, if necessary). If you add
a NIC to a Windows system, the TCP/IP settings
are set to use DHCP. A manually assigned IP
address is known as a static IP address.
Troubleshoot networks
■
The one thing that all PC problems have in
common is a symptom. If you’re working with a
user, you must try to get the user to describe the
symptom. Then you must verify that the symptom
is legitimate. Try to inspect the problem yourself.
Find out when it occurs so that you can zero in on
where to look for the solution.
■
Systems are much more likely to have problems
after a hardware or software change; check to see if
that has happened since the system last worked
properly. When you discover a change has been
made, try to visualize the process of the change to
consider how that change may have directly or
indirectly contributed to a problem.
■
Check the environment to get an overview of what
is affecting this system both internally and
externally. The larger environment—heat,
humidity, dirt, and other outside factors—may
affect the operation of the system, as may the
computing environment of this system and other
surrounding systems, including the type of system,
OS, network connection, primary applications,
antivirus program, and other users.
■
If a problem happens twice, the chances are much
higher that it will happen a third time. Direct the user
to try to reproduce the problem while you watch
to see what triggers the failure. Many seemingly
intermittent problems really aren’t intermittent—you
just haven’t reproduced the events exactly.
■
Take the time to try to isolate the symptom to
ensure that your fix is going to the software or
hardware that really needs it. Remove suspect
pieces of hardware until only one possible “bad
apple” remains. Remove background programs,
boot into Safe Mode, or try to create a situation in
which only the suspected program is running.
Isolation is one of the greatest tools in networking.
■
If you aren’t sure whether a problem lies in the
software or in the hardware, you can take a few
steps to help you zero in on which side of the PC
to suspect. The best step is to replace the suspected
piece of hardware with a known good part and
then try uninstalling the suspected software and
reinstalling. Try upgrading drivers. Download
patches or upgrades to software, especially if the
hardware and the software are more than two
years apart in age, and always check for viruses.
■
Once you’ve discovered the problem, unless it is
either simple (network cable unplugged) or
something you’ve seen before and know exactly
how to fix, you’ll need to research it. The Internet
makes this easy. One of my favorite tricks is to type
the error into my search engine, because most
times I can find a quick fix.
■
Make backups—or at least warn the user of the
risk—before you try a fix. If possible, try to
remember how the system was set up before the fix
so you can go back to square one if the fix fails to
work. After you perform the fix, do whatever you
need to do to make sure the system is working
properly. Make sure the user experiences the system
working properly and can sign off on your work.
■
You can use the OSI seven-layer model to
troubleshoot network problems. The Physical layer
defines the physical form taken by data when it
travels across a cable. The Data Link layer defines
the rules for accessing and using the Physical layer.
The Network layer defines the rules for adding
information to the data packet that controls how
routers move it from its source on one network to
its destination on a different network.
■
The Transport layer breaks up data it receives from
the upper layers into smaller pieces for transport
within the data packets created at the lower layers.
The Session layer manages the connections between
machines on the network. The Presentation layer
presents data from the sending system in a form that
a receiving system can understand. The Application
layer is where you (or a user) get to interact with the
computers.
■
Mike’s Four-Layer Model is an approach to network
troubleshooting. First, check the hardware, including
connections, NICs, and hubs/switches/routers.
Second, check that the protocols, such as TCP/IP, are
installed and properly configured. Third, check the
network setup, whether it includes a server or is peer-
to-peer. Finally, check the shared resources. Have
you identified the appropriate resources and made
them available for sharing to all relevant users?
Are the individual systems set up to access the
shared resources?

ireless networks have been popular for many years now, but unlike
wired networks, so much of how wireless works continues to elude
people. Part of the problem might be that a simple wireless network is so
inexpensive and easy to configure that most users and techs never really get into
the hows of wireless. The chance to get away from all the cables and mess and
just connect has a phenomenal appeal. Well, let’s change all that and dive
deeply into wireless networking.

■Wireless Networking Components
Instead of a physical set of wires running between network nodes, wireless
networks use either radio waves or beams of infrared light to communicate
with each other. Various kinds of wireless networking solutions have come
and gone in the past. The wireless radio wave networks you’ll find yourself
supporting these days are based on the IEEE 802.11 wireless Ethernet stan-
dard, marketed as Wi-Fi, and on Bluetooth technology. Wireless networks
using infrared light are limited to those that use the Infrared Data Associa-
tion (IrDA) protocol. Finally, the cell phone companies have gotten into the
mix and offer access to the Internet through cellular networks with technol-
ogies such as EDGE and 3G.
Wireless networking capabilities of one form or an-
other are built into many modern computing devices. In-
frared transceiver ports have been standard issue on
portable computers, PDAs, and high-end printers for
years, although they’re absent from most of the latest
PCs and portables. Figure 17.1 shows the infrared trans-
ceiver ports on an older laptop and PDA. Wireless Ether-
net and, to a lesser extent, Bluetooth capabilities are now
ubiquitous as integrated components, or you can easily
add them by using USB, PCI, PCI Express, or PC Card
adapters. Figure 17.2 shows a desktop PCI Wi-Fi
adapter. You can also add wireless network capabilities
by using external USB wireless network adapters, as
shown in Figure 17.3.
Wireless networking is not limited to PCs. Most
handheld computers, PDAs, and smartphones have
wireless capabilities built in or available as add-on op-
tions. Figure 17.4 shows a smartphone accessing the
Internet over a Wi-Fi connection.

To extend the capabilities of a wireless Ethernet network,
such as connecting to a wired network or sharing a high-
speed Internet connection, you need a wireless access point
(WAP). A WAP centrally connects wireless network nodes in
the same way that a hub connects wired Ethernet PCs. Many
WAPs also act as switches and Internet routers, such as the
Linksys device shown in Figure 17.5.
Wireless communication via Bluetooth comes as a built-
in option on newer PCs and peripheral devices, or you can
add it to an older PC via an external USB Bluetooth adapter.
Figure 17.6 shows a Bluetooth adapter with a Bluetooth-
enabled mouse and keyboard.
Wireless Networking Software
Wireless devices use the same networking protocols and cli-
ent that their wired counterparts use, and they operate by us-
ing the carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance
(CSMA/CA) networking scheme. The collision avoidance as-
pect differs slightly from the collision detection standard used
in wired Ethernet. Wireless nodes listen in on the wireless
medium to see if another node is currently broadcasting data. If so, it waits a
random amount of time before retrying. So far, this method is exactly the
same as the method used by wired Ethernet networks. Because wireless
nodes have a more difficult time detecting data collisions, however, they of-
fer the option of using the Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) protocol.
When enabled, a transmitting node that determines that the wireless me-
dium is clear to use sends an RTS frame to the receiving node. The receiving
node responds with a CTS frame, telling the sending node that it’s okay to
transmit. Then, once the data is sent, the transmitting node waits for an ac-
knowledgment (ACK) from the receiving node before sending the next data
packet. Very elegant, but keep in mind that using RTS/CTS introduces sig-
nificant overhead to the process and can impede performance.

Wireless access points are
commonly known as WAPs,
APs, or simply wireless routers.
Wireless networks use the
carrier sense multiple access/
collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)
standard, while wired Ethernet
networks use carrier sense mul-
tiple access/collision detection
(CSMA/CD).

In terms of configuring wireless networking
software, you need to do very little. Wireless
network adapters are plug and play, so any
modern version of Windows immediately rec-
ognizes one when installed, prompting you to
load any needed hardware drivers. You will,
however, need a utility to set parameters such
as the network name.
Windows XP and later built-in tools for con-
figuring these settings, but for previous ver-
sions of Windows, you need to rely on
configuration tools provided by the wireless
network adapter vendor. Figure 17.7 shows a
typical wireless network adapter configuration
utility. Using this utility, you can determine
your link state and signal strength, configure
your wireless networking mode (discussed
next), and set security encryption, power saving
options, and so on.
Wireless Network Modes
The simplest wireless network consists of two
or more PCs communicating directly with each
other without cabling or any other intermediary
hardware. More complicated wireless networks use a WAP to centralize
wireless communication and bridge wireless network segments to wired
network segments. These two methods are called ad hoc mode and infra-
structure mode.
Ad hoc Mode
Ad hoc mode is sometimes called peer-to-peer mode, with
each wireless node in direct contact with every other node
in a decentralized free-for-all, as shown in Figure 17.8.
Two or more wireless nodes communicating in ad hoc
mode form what’s called an Independent Basic Service Set
(IBSS). Ad hoc mode networks are suited for small groups
of computers (less than a dozen or so) that need to transfer
files or share printers. Ad hoc networks are also good for
temporary networks such as study groups or business
meetings.
Infrastructure Mode
Wireless networks running in infrastructure mode use one
or more WAPs to connect the wireless network nodes to a
wired network segment, as shown in Figure 17.9. A single
WAP servicing a given area is called a Basic Service Set
(BSS). This service area can be extended by adding more
WAPs. This is called, appropriately, an Extended Basic Ser-
vice Set (EBSS).

Wireless ad hoc mode network

Wireless networks running in infrastructure mode require more
planning and are more complicated to configure than ad hoc mode
networks, but they also give you finer control over how the network
operates. Infrastructure mode is better suited to networks that need
to share dedicated resources such as Internet connections and cen-
tralized databases.
Wireless Networking Security
One of the major complaints against wireless networking is that it of-
fers weak security. In many cases, all you need to do to access a wire-
less network is walk into a WAP’s coverage area, turn on your
wireless device, and connect! Furthermore, data packets are floating
through the air instead of safely wrapped up inside network cabling.
What’s to stop an unscrupulous PC tech with the right equipment
from grabbing those packets out of the air and reading that data
himself?
Wireless networks use three methods to secure access to the network it-
self and secure the data that’s being transferred. The service set identifier
(SSID) parameter—also called the network name—is used to define the wire-
less network. This is very handy when you have a number of wireless net-
works in the same area.
SSID
One of the main security weaknesses with wireless networks is that, out of
the box, no security is configured at all. Wireless devices want to be heard,
and WAPs are usually configured to broadcast their presence to their maxi-
mum range and welcome all other wireless devices that respond.
Always change the default SSID to something unique, and change the
password right away. Configuring a unique SSID name and password is the
very least that you should do to secure a wireless network. The default SSID
names and passwords are well known and widely available online. This is
intended to make setting up a wireless network as easy as possible, but can
cause problems in places with a lot of overlapping wireless networks. Each
wireless network node and access point needs to be configured with the
same unique SSID name. This SSID name is then included in the header of
every data packet broadcast in the wireless network’s coverage area. Data
packets that lack the correct SSID name in the header are rejected.
Another trick often seen in wireless networks is to tell the wireless de-
vice not to broadcast the SSID. People not authorized to access the network
will have a harder time knowing it’s there.
MAC Address Filtering
Most WAPs also support MAC address filtering, a method that enables you to
limit access to your wireless network based on the physical, hard-wired ad-
dress of the units’ wireless NIC. MAC address filtering is a handy way of
creating a type of “accepted users” list to limit access to your wireless net-
work, but it works best when you have a small number of users. A table
stored in the WAP lists the MAC addresses that are permitted to participate

Changing the default SSID for
the WAP is the first step in set-
ting up a new wireless network.
Many techs shorten the term
“MAC address filtering” to sim-
ply “MAC filtering.” Either term
works.

in the wireless network. Any data packets that don’t contain the MAC ad-
dress of a node listed in the table are rejected.
WEP
Early on, Wi-Fi developers introduced the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
protocol to attempt to ensure that data is secured while in transit over the
airwaves. WEP encryption uses a standard 40-bit encryption to scramble
data packets. Many vendors also support 104-bit encryption. Note that
some vendors advertise 128-bit encryption, but they actually use a 104-bit
encryption key. Unfortunately, WEP encryption includes a flaw that makes
it extremely vulnerable to attack. Although better than no encryption at all,
keep in mind that WEP will not keep out a knowledgeable intruder.
One important note to consider is that WEP doesn’t provide complete
end-to-end encryption. WEP provides encryption only between the WAP
and the wireless device. Encryption is stripped from the data packet as it
travels “up” through the subsequent network layers. For true end-to-end
encryption, you need to upgrade to WPA or WPA2.
WPA
The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol addresses the weaknesses of
WEP and acts as a security protocol upgrade to WEP. WPA offers security
enhancements such as an encryption key integrity-checking feature and
user authentication through the industry-standard Extensible Authentication
Protocol (EAP). EAP provides a huge security improvement over WEP en-
cryption. After all, MAC addresses are fairly easy to “sniff” out, because
they’re transmitted in unencrypted, clear text format. User names and pass-
words are encrypted and therefore much more secure. Even with these en-
hancements, WPA was intended only as an interim security solution until
the IEEE 802.11i security standard was finalized and implemented.
WPA2
Today, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows support the full IEEE 802.11i
standard, more commonly known as Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2), to
lock down wireless networks. WPA2 uses the Advanced Encryption Stan-
dard (AES), among other improvements, to provide a secure wireless envi-
ronment. If you haven’t upgraded to WPA2, you should.
Speed and Range Issues
Wireless networking data throughput speeds depend on several factors.
Foremost is the standard that the wireless devices use. Depending on the
standard used, wireless throughput speeds range from a measly 2 Mbps to a
snappy 100+ Mbps. One of the other factors affecting speed is the distance
between wireless nodes (or between wireless nodes and centralized access
points). Wireless devices dynamically negotiate the top speed at which they
can communicate without dropping too many data packets. Speed de-
creases as distance increases, so the maximum throughput speed is
achieved only at extremely close range (less than 25 feet or so). At the outer
reaches of a device’s effective range, speed may decrease to around 1 Mbps
before it drops out altogether.
Chapter 17: Learning Wireless
561
You’ll occasionally hear the
table that lists allowed MAC ad-
dresses referred to as an Access
Control List (ACL).
Tech Tip
Increasing Wireless
Range
You can increase range in a cou-
ple of ways. You can install mul-
tiple WAPs to permit “roaming”
between one WAP’s coverage
area and another’s—an EBSS,
described earlier in this chapter.
Or you can install a replacement
antenna that increases a single
WAP’s signal strength, thus in-
creasing its range. If that is still
not enough, signal boosters are
available that can give you even
more power.

Speed is also affected by interference from other wireless devices operating
in the same frequency range—such as cordless phones or baby monitors—and
by solid objects. So-called dead spots occur when something capable of block-
ing the radio signal comes between the wireless network nodes. Large elec-
trical appliances such as refrigerators are very effective at blocking a
wireless network signal. Other culprits include electrical fuse boxes, metal
plumbing, air conditioning units, and similar objects.
Wireless networking range is difficult to define, and you’ll see most
descriptions listed with qualifiers, such as “around 150 feet” and “about
300 feet.” This is simply because, like throughput speed, range is greatly af-
fected by outside factors. Interference from other wireless devices affects
range, as does interference from solid objects. The maximum ranges listed in
the next section are those presented by wireless manufacturers as the theo-
retical maximum ranges. In the real world, you’ll experience these ranges
only under the most ideal circumstances. True effective range is probably
about half what you see listed.
■Wireless Networking Standards
To help you gain a better understanding of wireless network technology,
here is a brief look at the standards used.
IEEE 802.11-Based Wireless Networking
The IEEE 802.11 wireless Ethernet standard, more commonly known as
Wi-Fi, defines methods by which devices may communicate by using spread-
spectrum radio waves. Spread-spectrum broadcasts data in small, discrete
chunks over the frequencies available within a certain frequency range.
The 802.11-based wireless technologies broadcast and receive on one of
two license-free industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) radio bands: 2.4 GHz
and 5.8 GHz. Even though the ISM band is 5.8 GHz, we just say “5 GHz”
for reasons I can’t answer. Over the years, the original 802.11 standard has
been extended to 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n variations used in
Wi-Fi wireless networks. Each of these versions of 802.11 uses one of the two
562
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Look for basic troubleshoot-
ing questions on the CompTIA
A+ Essentials exam that deal
with factors that affect wireless
connectivity, range, and speed.
You can see the speed and
signal strength on your wireless
network by looking at the wire-
less NIC’s properties.
In the early days of wireless
networking, many techs and
marketing people assumed Wi-Fi
stood for Wireless Fidelity, a sort
of play on the common sound
signal of high fidelity. It might
have at one time, but the Wi-Fi
Alliance, the governing stan-
dards body for 802.11-based net-
working, just uses the term Wi-Fi
today.
Tech Tip
Spread-Spectrum Broadcasting
The 802.11 standard defines three spread-spectrum broadcasting methods: direct-
sequence spread-spectrum (DSSS), frequency-hopping spread-spectrum (FHSS),
and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). DSSS sends data out
on multiple frequencies at the same time, while FHSS sends data on one frequency at
a time, constantly shifting (or hopping) frequencies. OFDM, the most common
broadcast method, uses multiple data streams, each of which is constantly shifting
(or hopping) frequencies. DSSS uses considerably more bandwidth than FHSS or
OFDM, around 22 MHz as opposed to 1 MHz, respectively. DSSS is capable of
greater data throughput, but DSSS is more prone to interference than FHSS. HomeRF
wireless networks, now obsolete, were the only types that used FHSS; all the other
802.11-based wireless networking standards use DSSS or OFDM.

ISM bands, with the exception of 802.11n, which uses one but may use both.
Don’t worry; I’ll break this down for you in a moment.
Newer wireless devices can communicate with older wireless devices,
so if you are using an 802.11n WAP, all of your 802.11g devices can use it.
The exception to this is 802.11a, which requires that all of the equipment di-
rectly support it. The following paragraphs describe the important specifi-
cations of each of the popular 802.11-based wireless networking standards.
802.11a
Despite the “a” designation for this extension to the 802.11 stan-
dard, 802.11a was actually on the market after 802.11b. The 802.11a standard
differs from the other 802.11-based standards in significant ways. Foremost
is that it operates in the 5-GHz frequency range. This means that devices
that use this standard are less prone to interference from other devices that
use the same frequency range. 802.11a also offers considerably greater
throughput than 802.11 and 802.11b, at speeds up to 54 Mbps, though its ac-
tual throughput is no more than 25 Mbps in normal traffic conditions. Al-
though its theoretical range tops out at about 150 feet, its maximum range
will be lower in a typical office environment. Despite the superior speed of
802.11a, it isn’t as widely adopted in the PC world as some of the following
802.11 versions.
802.11b
802.11b was the first standard to take off and become ubiquitous
in wireless networking. The 802.11b standard supports data throughput of
up to 11 Mbps (with actual throughput averaging 4 to 6 Mbps)—on par with
older wired 10BaseT networks—and a maximum range of 300 feet under
ideal conditions. In a typical office environment, its maximum range is
lower. The main downside to using 802.11b is, in fact, that it uses a very pop-
ular frequency. The 2.4-GHz ISM band is already crowded with baby moni-
tors, garage door openers, microwaves, and wireless phones, so you’re
likely to run into interference from other wireless devices.
802.11g
802.11g came out in 2003, taking the best of 802.11a and b and roll-
ing them into a single standard. 802.11g offers data transfer speeds equiva-
lent to 802.11a, up to 54 Mbps, with the wider 300-foot range of 802.11b.
More important, 802.11g runs in the 2.4-GHz ISM band, so it is backward
compatible with 802.11b, meaning that the same 802.11g WAP can service
both 802.11b and 802.11g wireless nodes. 802.11g is incredibly popular and
is only just now starting to lose out to the newest version of 802.11, 802.11n.

Wi-Fi is by far the most
widely adopted wireless net-
working type today. Not only do
millions of private businesses
and homes have wireless net-
works, but many public places
such as coffee shops and librar-
ies also offer Internet access
through wireless networks.
Tech Tip
Wi-Fi Certification
Technically, only wireless devices that conform to the extended versions of the 802.11
standard (802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n) are Wi-Fi certified. Wi-Fi certifi-
cation comes from the Wi-Fi Alliance (formerly the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility
Alliance, or WECA), a nonprofit industry group made up of more than 175 member
companies who design and manufacture wireless networking products. Wi-Fi certifi-
cation ensures compatibility among wireless networking devices made by different
vendors. First-generation devices that use the older 802.11 standard are not Wi-Fi
certified and may or may not work well with devices made by different vendors.
Tech Tip
The 802.11 Standard
Devices that use the original
802.11 (with no letter) standard
are obsolete these days. You’re
likeliest to find them in service on
some brave early wireless
adopter’s network—or in a mu-
seum. The original 802.11 stan-
dard was hampered by both slow
speeds (2 Mbps maximum) and
limited range (about 150 feet).
The 802.11 standard employed
some of the same features that are
in use in the current wireless
standards; 802.11 uses the
2.4-GHz broadcast range.

802.11n
The 802.11n standard brings several improvements to Wi-Fi net-
working, including faster speeds and new antenna technology implementa-
tions.
The 802.11n specification requires all but handheld devices to use multi-
ple antennae to implement a feature called multiple in/multiple out (MIMO),
which enables the devices to make multiple simultaneous connections. With
up to four antennae, 802.11n devices can achieve amazing speeds. (The offi-
cial standard supports throughput of up to 600 Mbps, although practical im-
plementation drops that down substantially.)
Many 802.11n WAPs employ transmit beamforming, a multiple-antennae
technology that helps get rid of dead spots—or at least make them not so
bad. The antennae adjust the signal once the WAP discovers a client to opti-
mize the radio signal.
Like 802.11g, 802.11n WAPs can run in the 2.4-GHz ISM band, support-
ing earlier, slower 802.11b/g devices. However, 802.11n also has a more
powerful, so-called dual-band. To use dual-band 802.11n, you need a more
advanced (and more expensive) WAP that runs at both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz
simultaneously; some support 802.11a devices as well as 802.11b/g devices.
Nice!

Other Wireless Standards
The 802.11 standards are the big players in home networking, but they’re far
from the only way to cut the cords. There are many other wireless standards
that use all sorts of different methods to provide wireless communication,
from infrared beams to cellular signals. Let’s take a look at a few of these
other methods.
Infrared Wireless Networking
Wireless networking using infrared technology is largely overlooked these
days, probably because of the explosion of interest in the newer and faster
wireless standards. But it is still a viable method to transfer files on some
older devices.
Communication through infrared devices is enabled via the Infrared
Data Association (IrDA) protocol. The IrDA protocol stack is a widely sup-
ported industry standard and has been included in all versions of Windows
since Windows 95.
In speed and range, infrared isn’t very impressive. Infrared devices are
capable of transferring data at up to 4 Mbps—not too shabby, but hardly
stellar. The maximum distance between infrared devices is 1 meter. Infrared
links are direct line-of-sight and are susceptible to interference. Anything
that breaks the beam of light can disrupt an infrared link: a badly placed can
of Mountain Dew, a coworker passing between desks, or even bright sun-
light hitting the infrared transceiver can cause interference.
Infrared is designed to make a point-to-point connection between two
devices only in ad hoc mode. No infrastructure mode is available. You can,
however, use an infrared access point device to enable Ethernet network
communication using IrDA. Infrared devices operate at half-duplex, mean-
ing that while one is talking, the other is listening—they can’t talk and listen
at the same time. IrDA has a mode that emulates full-duplex communica-
tion, but it’s really half-duplex. The IrDA protocol offers exactly nothing in
the way of encryption or authentication. Infrared’s main security feature is
the fact that you have to be literally within arm’s reach to establish a link.
Clearly, infrared is not the best solution for a dedicated network connection,
but for a quick file transfer or print job without getting your hands dirty, it’ll
do in a pinch.
Table 17.2 lists infrared’s important specifications.

Bluetooth) is designed to create small wireless networks preconfigured to do

very specific jobs. Some great examples are audio devices such as headsets
that connect to your smartphones, personal area networks (PANs) that link
two PCs for a quick-and-dirty wireless network, and input devices such as
keyboards and mice. Bluetooth is not designed to be a full-function network-
ing solution, nor is it meant to compete with Wi-Fi. If anything, Bluetooth has
replaced infrared as a means to connect PCs to peripherals.
Bluetooth, like any technology, has been upgraded over the years to make
it faster and more secure. Two major versions of Bluetooth are widespread
today. The first generation (versions 1.1 and 1.2) supports speeds around
1 Mbps. The second generation (2.0 and 2.1) is backward compatible with its
first-generation cousins and adds support for more speed by introducing En-
hanced Data Rate (EDR), which pushes top speeds to around 3 Mbps.
The IEEE organization has made first-generation Bluetooth the basis for
its 802.15 standard for wireless PANs. Bluetooth uses the FHSS broadcast-
ing method, switching between any of the 79 frequencies available in the
2.45-GHz range. Bluetooth hops frequencies some 1600 times per second,
making it highly resistant to interference.
Generally, the faster and further a device sends data, the more power it
needs to do so, and the Bluetooth designers understood a long time ago that
some devices (such as a Bluetooth headset) could save power by not sending
data as quickly or as far as other Bluetooth devices may need. To address
this, all Bluetooth devices are configured for one of three classes that define
maximum power usage in milliwatts (mW) and maximum distance:
Class 1
100 mW
100 meters
Class 2
2.5 mW
10 meters
Class 3
1 mW
1 meter
Bluetooth is not designed to be a full-fledged wireless networking solu-
tion. Bluetooth is made to replace the snake’s nest of cables that currently
connects most PCs to their various peripheral devices—keyboard, mouse,
printer, speakers, scanner, and the like—but you won’t be swapping out
your 802.11-based networking devices with Bluetooth-based replacements
anytime soon.
Having said that, Bluetooth-enabled wireless networking is comparable
to other wireless technologies in a few ways:
■
Like infrared, Bluetooth is acceptable for quick file transfers where a
wired connection (or a faster wireless connection) is unavailable.
■
Almost all wireless headsets are now Bluetooth.
■
Bluetooth’s speed and range make it a good match for wireless print
server solutions.
Bluetooth hardware comes either integrated into many newer portable
electronic gadgets such as PDAs and cell phones or as an adapter added to an
internal or external expansion bus. Bluetooth networking is enabled through
ad hoc–styled PC-to-PC (or PDA-, handheld computer–, or cell phone–to-PC)
connections, or in an infrastructure-like mode through Bluetooth access
points. Bluetooth access points are very similar to 802.11-based access points,
bridging wireless Bluetooth PAN segments to wired LAN segments.

Cellular
A cellular wireless network enables you to connect to the Internet through a net-
work-aware PDA, cell phone, or smartphone. Using an add-on PC Card or USB
dongle, you can connect any laptop to a cellular network as well. Figure 17.10
shows an AT&T USBConnect Mercury 3G device for just that purpose.
In areas with broad cell phone coverage, such as big cities, cellular wire-
less networks offer high-speed access (around 1.5-Mbps download speeds)
anywhere you go. Carriers use many protocols to provide the higher
speeds, and collectively they are known as 3G. Just fire up your smartphone
or portable computer and start surfing the Web! In remote areas where the
3G networks have not been built out, the speed drops down to something
closer to modem connection speeds. (See Chapter 18, “Learning the
Internet,” for the scoop on modems.)
Cellular networks use various protocols to connect, such as Global Sys-
tem for Mobile Communications (GSM), General Packet Radio Service
(GPRS), and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). The 3G networks
make use of protocols such as UMTS/HSPA (AT&T), EV-DO (Verizon), and
UMTS (T-Mobile). These protocols are handled seamlessly by the software
and hardware. What end users see is TCP/IP, just as if they connected
through a wired network.

Chapter 17 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about wireless networking.
Discuss wireless networking components
■
The wireless radio wave networks you’ll find
yourself supporting these days are those based on
the IEEE 802.11 wireless Ethernet standard Wi-Fi
and on the newer Bluetooth technology. Many
cellular phone providers also provide Internet
access through their networks. Wireless networks
using infrared light use the IrDA protocol.
■
Wireless networking capabilities of one form or
another are built into many modern computing
devices. Wireless Ethernet and Bluetooth are
almost ubiquitous as integrated components or can
easily be added by using USB, PCI, PCI Express, or
PC Card adapters. Many handheld computers,
smartphones, and PDAs have wireless capabilities
built in or available as add-on options.
■
To extend the capabilities of a wireless Ethernet
network, such as connecting to a wired network or
sharing a high-speed Internet connection, you need
a WAP. A WAP centrally connects wireless
network nodes in the same way that a hub
connects wired Ethernet PCs.
Analyze and explain wireless networking standards
■
Wireless devices use the same networking
protocols and client that their wired counterparts
use, and they operate by using the CSMA/CA
networking scheme, where nodes check before
broadcasting. Wireless nodes also use the RTS/
CTS protocol. When enabled, a transmitting node
that determines that the wireless medium is clear
to use sends an RTS frame to the receiving node.
The receiving node responds with a CTS frame,
telling the sending node that it’s okay to transmit.
Then, once the data is sent, the transmitting node
waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the
receiving node before sending the next data packet.
■
You will need a utility to set parameters such as
your SSID. Windows XP and up have built-in tools
for this, but otherwise you must rely on
configuration tools provided by the wireless
network adapter vendor.
■
The simplest wireless network consists of two
or more PCs communicating directly with each
other without cabling or any other intermediary
hardware (ad hoc mode). More complicated (and
more common) wireless networks use a WAP to
centralize wireless communication and bridge
wireless network segments to wired network
segments (infrastructure mode).
■
Ad hoc networks are also good for temporary
networks such as study groups or business meetings.
■
Infrastructure mode is better suited to business
networks or networks that need to share dedicated
resources such as Internet connections and
centralized databases.
■
Out of the box, wireless networks have no security
configured at all. Wireless devices want to be heard,
and WAPs are usually configured to broadcast their
presence to their maximum range and welcome all
other wireless devices that respond. Further, data
packets are floating through the air instead of safely
wrapped up inside network cabling.
■
Most WAPs support MAC address filtering, a
method that enables you to limit access to your
wireless network based on the physical, hard-wired
address of the unit’s wireless network adapter.
■
Enabling WEP encrypts your data to secure it
while in transit over the airwaves, but the WEP
encryption standard itself is flawed and cannot
be relied upon to protect your data against a
knowledgeable and motivated attacker.
■
WPA and WPA2 address the weaknesses of WEP
and act as a sort of security protocol upgrade to
WEP-enabled devices. WPA and WPA2 offer
security enhancements such as an encryption key
integrity-checking feature and user authentication
through the industry-standard EAP.
■
Depending on the standard used, wireless
throughput speeds range from a measly 2 Mbps
to a snappy 100+ Mbps. Wireless devices
dynamically negotiate the top speed at which they
can communicate without dropping too many data
packets.
568
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

■
Wireless networking speed and range are greatly
affected by outside factors, such as interference from
other wireless devices or solid objects. A wireless
device’s true effective range is probably about half
the theoretical maximum listed by the manufacturer.
■
802.11a differs from the other 802.11-based
standards in significant ways. Foremost, it operates
in a different frequency range, 5 GHz, so 802.11a
devices are less prone to interference. 802.11a also
offers considerably greater throughput than 802.11
and 802.11b, at speeds up to 54 Mbps, but its range
tops out at only about 150 feet. 802.11a isn’t widely
adopted in the PC world.
■
The 802.11b standard supports data throughput of
up to 11 Mbps—on par with older wired 10BaseT
networks—and a range of up to 300 feet under
ideal conditions.
■
The 802.11g standard offers data transfer speeds
equivalent to 802.11a, up to 54 Mbps, with the
wider 300-foot range of 802.11b. Because 802.11g
is backward compatible with 802.11b, the same
802.11g WAP can service both 802.11g and 802.11b
wireless nodes.
■
802.11n ups the speed even more to 100+ Mbps and
extends the range to greater than 300 feet by using
MIMO (multiple in/multiple out) with extra
antennae. You can also configure it to use the less
crowded 5-GHz band if you are using a dual-mode
WAP.
■
Wireless networking using infrared (IR) technology is
enabled via the Infrared Data Association—IrDA—
protocol stack, a widely supported industry standard,
and has been included in all versions of Windows
since Windows 95. IR is designed to make only a
point-to-point connection between two devices in ad
hoc mode of up to 4 Mbps, at a maximum distance of
1 meter.
■
Bluetooth wireless technology is designed to create
small wireless personal area networks (PANs) that
link PCs to peripheral devices such as PDAs and
printers, input devices such as keyboards and
mice, and even consumer electronics such as cell
phones, home stereos, televisions, home security
systems, and so on. Bluetooth is not designed to be
a full-function networking solution.
■
Cellular wireless networks enable you to connect
to the Internet through a smartphone or portable
computer with an access card with download
speeds of around 1.5 Mbps. Cellular networks use
various protocols, including GSM, GPRS, and
CDMA. The current high-speed cellular network
protocols are collectively called 3G.

and rich blue ocean. Overhead, pterodactyls soar through the air while you talk

in search of a giant monster.… TV show from the SciFi channel? Spielberg’s latest
film offering? How about an interactive game played by millions of people all
over the planet on a daily basis by connecting to the Internet? If you guessed
the last one, you’re right.
This chapter covers the skills you need as a PC tech to help people connect
to the Internet. It starts with a brief section on how the Internet works, along
with the concepts of connectivity, and then it goes into the specifics on the many
different types of Internet connections. Let’s get started!

■How the Internet Works
Thanks to the Internet, people can communicate with one another over vast
distances, often in the blink of an eye. As a PC tech, you need to know how
PCs communicate with the larger world for two reasons. First, knowing the
process and pieces involved in the communication enables you to trouble-
shoot effectively when that communication goes away. Second, you need to
be able to communicate knowledgeably with a network technician who
comes in to solve a more complex issue.
Internet Tiers
You probably know that the Internet is millions and millions of computers
all joined together to form the largest network on Earth, but not many folks
know much about how these computers are organized. To keep everything
running smoothly, the Internet is broken down into groups called tiers. The
main tier, called Tier 1, consists of nine companies called Tier 1 providers. The
Tier 1 providers own long-distance, high-speed fiber-optic networks called
backbones. These backbones span the major cities of the earth (not all Tier 1
backbones go to all cities) and interconnect at special locations called net-
work access points (NAPs). Anyone wishing to connect to any of the Tier 1
providers must pay large sums of money. The Tier 1 providers do not
charge each other.
Tier 2 providers own smaller, regional networks and must pay the Tier 1
providers. Most of the famous companies that provide Internet access to the
general public are Tier 2 providers. Tier 3 providers are even more regional
and connect to Tier 2 providers.
The piece of equipment that makes this tiered Internet concept work is
called a backbone router. Backbone routers connect to more than one other
backbone router, creating a big, interwoven framework for communication.
Figure 18.1 illustrates the decentralized and interwoven nature of the
Internet. The key reason for interweaving the backbones of the Internet was
to provide alternative pathways for
data if one or more of the routers
went down. If Jane in Houston
sends a message to her friend Polly
in New York City, for example, the
shortest path between Jane and
Polly in this hypothetical situation
is this: Jane’s message originates
at
Rice
University
in
Houston,
bounces to Emory University in
Atlanta,
flits
through
Virginia
Commonwealth University in Rich-
mond, and then zips into SUNY in
New York City (Figure 18.2). Polly
happily reads the message and life
is great. The Internet functions as
planned.
Chapter 18: Learning the Internet
573
• Figure 18.1
Internet Tier 1 connections

But what happens if the entire
southeastern United States expe-
riences a huge power outage and
Internet backbones in every state
from Virginia to Florida go down?
Jane’s message would bounce back
to Rice and the Rice computers. Being
smart cookies, the routers would re-
route the message to nodes that still
functioned—say, Rice to University
of Chicago, to University of Toronto,
and then to SUNY (Figure 18.3). It’s
all in a day’s work for the highly re-
dundant and adaptable Internet. At
this point in the game (2010), the
Internet simply cannot go down
fully—barring, of course, a catastro-
phe of Biblical proportions.
TCP/IP—The Common Language
of the Internet
As you know from all the earlier chapters in this book, hardware alone does-
n’t cut it in the world of computing. You need software to make the ma-
chines run and create an interface for humans. The Internet is no exception.
TCP/IP provides the basic software structure for communication on the
Internet.
Because you spent a good deal of Chapter 16, “Learning Local Area Net-
working,” working with TCP/IP, you should have an appreciation for its
adaptability and, perhaps more importantly, its extendability. TCP/IP pro-
vides the addressing scheme for computers that communicate on the
Internet through IP addresses, such as 192.168.4.1 or 16.45.123.7. As a

protocol, though, TCP/IP is much more than just an addressing system.
TCP/IP provides the framework and common language for the Internet.
And it offers a phenomenally wide-open structure for creative purposes.
Programmers can write applications built to take advantage of the TCP/IP
structure and features, creating what are called TCP/IP services. The cool
thing about TCP/IP services is that they’re limited only by the imagination
of the programmers.
There are many different TCP/IP services, and you don’t need to know
most of them for the Essentials exam, but I must mention one service that
you’ve most likely worked with yourself, whether you knew it by that term
or not. The most famous service is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
the service that provides the structure for the World Wide Web (“the Web,”
for short), the graphical face of the Internet. Using your Web browser—a
program specifically designed to retrieve, interpret, and display Web
pages—an almost endless variety of information and entertainment is just a
click away. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve started to look up something
on the Web, and suddenly it’s two hours later and I still haven’t looked up
what I started out wanting to know, but I don’t actually care, because I’ve
learned some amazing stuff! But then when I do go look it up, in just min-
utes I can find information it used to take days to uncover. The Web can ar-
guably claim the distinction of being both the biggest time-waster and the
biggest time-saver since the invention of the book!
At this point, you have an enormous, beautifully functioning network.
All the backbone routers connect with fiber and thick copper cabling back-
bones, and TCP/IP enables communication and services for building appli-
cations for humans to interface across the distances. What’s left? Oh, that’s
right: how do you tap into this great network and partake of its goodness?
Internet Service Providers
Every Tier 1 and Tier 2 provider leases connections to the Internet to compa-
nies called Internet service providers (ISPs). ISPs essentially sit along the
edges of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 Internet and tap into the flow. You can, in turn,
lease some of the connections from the ISP and thus get on the Internet.
ISPs come in all sizes. Comcast, the huge cable television provider, has
multiple, huge-capacity connections into the Internet, enabling its millions
of customers to connect from their local machines and surf the Web. Con-
trast Comcast with Unísono, an ISP in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico
(Figure 18.4). Billed as the “Best Internet Service in San Miguel,” it services
only a small (but delightful) community and the busy tourist crowd.
Connection Concepts
Connecting to an ISP requires two things to work perfectly: hardware for
connectivity, such as a modem and a working cable line; and software, such
as protocols to govern the connections and the data flow (all configured in
Windows) and applications to take advantage of the various TCP/IP ser-
vices. Once you have a contract with an ISP to grant you access to the
Internet, the ISP gives you TCP/IP configuration numbers and data so you
can set up your software to connect directly to a router at the ISP that be-
comes your gateway to the Internet. The router to which you connect at the
Chapter 18: Learning the Internet
575
Microsoft calls the connec-
tions ISPs make to the Internet
access points, which I think is a
very bad name. You’d think we’d
be able to come up with new
terms for things! Instead, some
folks in this industry continue
rebranding things with the same
phrases or catchwords, only
serving to confuse already be-
wildered consumers.

ISP, by the way, is often referred to
as the default gateway. Once you
configure your software correctly,
you can connect to the ISP and get to
the greater Internet. Figure 18.5
shows
a
standard
PC-to-ISP-to-
Internet connection. Note that vari-
ous protocols and other software
manage the connectivity between
your PC and the default gateway.
■Connecting to
the Internet
PCs commonly connect to an ISP by
using one of seven technologies that
fit into four categories: dial-up, both analog and ISDN; dedicated, such as
DSL, cable, and LAN; wireless; and satellite. Analog dial-up is the slowest of

the bunch and requires a telephone line and a special networking device
called a modem. ISDN uses digital dial-up and has much greater speed. All
the others use a regular Ethernet NIC like you played with in Chapter 16,
“Learning Local Area Networking.” Satellite is the odd one out here; it may
use either a modem or a NIC, depending on the particular configuration you
have, although most folks will use a NIC. Let’s take a look at all these vari-
ous connection options.
Dial-up
A dial-up connection to the Internet requires two pieces to work: hardware
to dial the ISP, such as a modem or ISDN terminal adapter; and software to
govern the connection, such as Microsoft’s Dial-Up Networking (DUN). Let’s
look at the hardware first, and then we’ll explore software configuration.
Modems
At some point in the early days of computing, some bright
guy or gal noticed a colleague talking on a telephone,
glanced down at a PC, and then put two and two together:
why not use telephone lines for data communication? The
basic problem with this idea is that traditional telephone
lines use analog signals, while computers use digital signals
(Figure 18.6). Creating a dial-up network required equip-
ment that could turn digital data into an analog signal to
send it over the telephone line, and then turn it back into dig-
ital data when it reached the other end of the connection. A
device called a modem solved this dilemma.
Modems enable computers to talk to each other via stan-
dard commercial telephone lines by converting analog sig-
nals to digital signals, and vice versa. The term modem is
short for modulator/demodulator, a description of trans-
forming the signals. Telephone wires transfer data via ana-
log signals that continuously change voltages on a wire.
Computers hate analog signals. Instead, they need digital
signals, voltages that are either on or off, meaning the wire
has voltage present or it does not. Computers, being binary
by nature, use only two states of
voltage: zero volts and positive
volts. Modems take analog signals
from telephone lines and turn them
into digital signals that the PC can
understand (Figure 18.7). Modems
also take digital signals from the PC
and convert them into analog signals
for the outgoing telephone line.
A modem does what is called se-
rial communication: It transmits data
as a series of individual ones and
zeros. The CPU can’t process data this
way. It needs parallel communication,
Chapter 18: Learning the Internet
577

versus digital signals used by the computer
• Figure 18.7
Modem converting analog signal to digital signal
The CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam expects you to know two
very common Internet terms,
which I’ll be using during this
chapter: bandwidth and latency.
Bandwidth refers to the amount
of data a connection is capable
of transmitting per second, and
latency is the amount of time a
packet takes to get to its desti-
nation and is measured in milli-
seconds.

transmitting and receiving data in discrete 8-bit chunks
(Figure 18.8). The individual serial bits of data are con-
verted into 8-bit parallel data that the PC can understand
through the universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter
(UART) chip (Figure 18.9).
There are many types of UARTs, each with different
functions. All serial communication devices are really
little more than UARTs. External modems can convert
analog signals to digital ones and
vice versa, but they must rely on
the serial ports to which they’re
connected for the job of convert-
ing between serial and parallel
data (Figure 18.10). Internal mo-
dems can handle both jobs be-
cause they have their own UART
built in (Figure 18.11).
Phone lines have a speed based
on a unit called a baud, which is one
cycle per second. The fastest rate
that a phone line can achieve is
2400 baud. Modems can pack mul-
tiple bits of data into each baud; a
33.6 kilobits per second (Kbps) mo-
dem, for example, packs 14 bits into
every baud: 2400 × 14 = 33.6 Kbps.
Thus, it is technically incorrect to
say, “I have a 56-K baud modem.”
The correct statement is, “I have a
56-Kbps modem.” But don’t bother;
people have used the term “baud”
instead of bits per second (bps) so of-
ten for so long that the terms have
become functionally synonymous.
Modern Modem Standards: V.90 vs.
V.92
The
fastest
data
transfer
speed a modem can handle is based
on its implementation of one of the
international standards for modem
technology: the V standards. Set by
the International Telecommunica-
tion Union (ITU), the current top standards are V.90 and V.92. Both stan-
dards offer download speeds of just a hair under 56 Kbps, but they differ in
upload speeds: up to 33.6 Kbps for V.90, and up to 48 Kbps for V.92 mo-
dems. To get anywhere near the top speeds of a V.90 or V.92 modem re-
quires a comparable modem installed on the other line and connecting
telephone lines in excellent condition. In practice, you’ll rarely get faster
throughput than about 48 Kbps for downloads and 28 Kbps for uploads.

Flow Control (Handshaking)
Flow control, also known as hand-
shaking, is the process by which two serial devices verify a conver-
sation. Imagine people talking on a CB radio. When one finishes
speaking, he will say “over.” That way the person listening can
be sure that the sender is finished speaking before she starts. Each
side of the conversation is verified. During a file transfer, two distinct
conversations take place that require flow control: local (between
modem and COM port) and end-to-end (between modems).
The modems themselves handle end-to-end flow control. PCs
can do local flow control between the modem and COM port in two
ways: hardware and software. Hardware flow control employs ex-
tra wires in the serial connection between the modem and the COM
port to let one device tell the other that it is ready to send or receive
data. These extra wires are called ready to send (RTS) and clear to send
(CTS), so hardware handshaking is often called RTS/CTS. Software
flow control uses a special character called XON to signal that data flow is be-
ginning, and another special character called XOFF to signal that data trans-
mission is finished; therefore, software handshaking is often called XON/
XOFF. Software handshaking is slower and not as dependable as hardware
handshaking, so you rarely see it.
Bells and Whistles
Although the core modem technology has changed lit-
tle in the past few years, modem manufacturers have continued to innovate
on many peripheral fronts—pardon the pun. You can walk into a computer
store nowadays, for example, and buy a V.92 modem that comes bundled
with an excellent fax machine and a digital answering machine. You can
even buy modems that you can call remotely that will wake up
your PC (Figure 18.12). What will they think up next?
Modem Connections
Internal modems connect to the PC
very differently from how external modems connect. Almost
all internal modems connect to a PCI or PCI Express expansion
bus slot inside the PC, although cost-conscious manufacturers
may use smaller modems that fit in special expansion slots de-
signed to support multiple communications features such as
modems, NICs, and sound cards (Figure 18.13). Older AMD
motherboards used Audio/Modem Riser (AMR) or Advanced
Communication Riser (ACR) slots, while Intel motherboards
used Communication and Networking Riser (CNR) slots.
External modems connect to the PC through an available
serial port (the old way) or USB port (Figure 18.14). Many older
PCs came with 9-pin serial ports, whereas most external mo-
dems designed to connect to a serial port come with a 25-pin
connector. That means you will probably need a 9-to-25-pin converter,
available at any computer store, to connect your external modem. Serial
ports are now quite rare as virtually all computers today have two or more
USB ports.
Don’t fret about USB versus serial for your modem connection, as the very
low speeds of data communication over a modem make the physical type of
the connection unimportant. Even the slow, aging serial interface more than
adequately handles 56-Kbps data transfers. If you have the option, choose a
USB modem, especially one with a volume control knob. USB offers simple

plug and play and easy portability between machines, plus such
modems require no external electrical source, getting all the
power they need from the USB connection.
Dial-up Networking
The software side of dial-up networks requires configuration
within Windows to include information provided by your ISP.
The ISP provides a dial-up telephone number or numbers, as
well as your user name and initial password. In addition, the
ISP will tell you about any special configuration options you
need to specify in the software setup. The full configuration of
dial-up networking is beyond the scope of this book, but you
should at least know where to go to follow instructions from
your ISP. Let’s take a look at the Network and Internet Connec-
tions applet in Windows XP.
Network Connections
To start configuring a dial-up connec-
tion in Windows XP, open the Control Panel. In Category
View, select Network and Internet Connections from the
Pick a category menu and then choose Set up or change your
Internet connection from the Pick a task menu. The Internet
Properties dialog box opens with the Connections tab dis-
played (Figure 18.15). All your work will proceed from here.
Click the Setup button to run the New Connection Wizard
(Figure 18.16), and then work through the screens. At this point,
you’re going to need information provided by your ISP to con-
figure your connection properly. When you finish the configu-
ration, you’ll see a new Connect To option on the Start menu if

your system is set up that way. If not, open up Network
Connections, and your new dial-up connection will be
available. Figure 18.17 shows the option to connect to a
fictitious ISP, Cool-Rides.com.
PPP
Dial-up links to the Internet have their own special
hardware protocol called Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP). PPP is a streaming
protocol developed especially for dial-up Internet access. To Windows, a
modem is nothing more than a special type of network adapter. Modems
have their own configuration entry in the Network Connections applet.
Most dial-up “I can’t connect to the Internet”–type problems are user er-
rors. Your first area of investigation is the modem itself. Use the modem’s
properties to make sure the volume is turned up. Have the user listen to the
connection. Does she hear a dial tone? If she doesn’t, make sure the mo-
dem’s line is plugged into a good phone jack. Does she hear the modem dial
and then hear someone saying, “Hello? Hello?” If so, she probably dialed
the wrong number! Wrong password error messages are fairly straightfor-
ward—remember that the password may be correct but the user name may
be wrong. If she still fails to connect, it’s time to call the network folks to see
what is not properly configured in the Dial-up Networking settings.
ISDN
A standard telephone connection comprises many pieces. First, the phone
line runs from your phone out to a network interface box (the little box on
the side of your house) and into a central switch belonging to the telephone
company. (In some cases, intermediary steps are present.) Standard metro-
politan areas have a large number of central offices, each with a central
switch. Houston, Texas, for example, has nearly 100 offices in the general
metro area. These central switches connect to each other through high-
capacity trunk lines. Before 1970, the entire phone system was analog; over
time, however, phone companies began to upgrade their trunk lines to digital
systems. Today, the entire telephone system, with the exception of the line
from your phone to the central office, and sometimes even that, is digital.
Chapter 18: Learning the Internet
581
• Figure 18.16
The New Connection Wizard
• Figure 18.17
Connection options in Network Connections

During this upgrade period, customers continued to demand higher
throughput from their phone lines. The old telephone line was not expected
to produce more than 28.8 Kbps (56-Kbps modems, which were a big sur-
prise to the phone companies, didn’t appear until 1995). Needless to say, the
phone companies were very motivated to come up with a way to generate
higher capacities. Their answer was actually fairly straightforward: make
the entire phone system digital. By adding special equipment at the central
office and the user’s location, phone companies can now achieve a through-
put of up to 64 Kbps per line (see the paragraphs following) over the same
copper wires already used by telephone lines. This process of sending tele-
phone transmission across fully digital lines end-to-end is called integrated
services digital network (ISDN) service.
ISDN service consists of two types of channels: Bearer, or B, channels
and Delta, or D, channels. B channels carry data and voice information at
64 Kbps. D channels carry setup and configuration information and carry
data at 16 Kbps. Most providers of ISDN allow the user to choose either one
or two B channels. The more common setup is two B/one D, usually called a
basic rate interface (BRI) setup. A BRI setup uses only one physical line, but
each B channel sends 64 Kbps, doubling the throughput total to 128 Kbps.
ISDN also connects much faster than modems, eliminating that long, annoy-
ing mating call you get with phone modems. The monthly cost per B chan-
nel is slightly more than a regular phone line, and usually a fairly steep
initial fee is levied for the installation and equipment. The big limitation is
that you usually need to be within about 18,000 feet of a central office to use
ISDN.
The physical connections for ISDN bear some similarity to analog mo-
dems. An ISDN wall socket usually looks something like a standard RJ-45
network jack. The most common interface for your computer is a device
called a terminal adapter (TA). TAs look much like regular modems, and like
modems, they come in external and internal variants. You can even get TAs
that are also hubs, enabling your system to support a direct LAN
connection.
DSL
Digital subscriber line (DSL) connections to ISPs use a standard telephone
line but special equipment on each end to create always-on Internet connec-
tions at blindingly fast speeds, especially when compared with analog dial-
up connections. Service levels vary around the United States, but the typical
upload speed is ~768 Kbps, while download speed comes in at a very sweet
~3+ Mbps!
DSL requires little setup from a user standpoint. A tech comes to the
house to install the DSL receiver, often called a DSL modem (Figure 18.18),
and possibly hook up a wireless router. The receiver connects to the tele-
phone line and the PC (Figure 18.19). The tech (or the user, if knowledge-
able) then configures the DSL modem and router (if there is one) with the
settings provided by the ISP, and that’s about it! Within moments, you’re
surfing at blazing speeds. You don’t need a second telephone line. You don’t
need to wear a special propeller hat or anything. The only kicker is that your
house has to be within a fairly short distance from a main phone service switch-
ing center, something like 18,000 feet.
582
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Another type of ISDN, called
a primary rate interface (PRI),
is composed of twenty-three
64-Kbps B channels and one
64-Kbps D channel, giving it a
total throughput of 1.5 megabits
per second. PRI ISDN lines are
also known as T1 lines.
The two most common forms
of DSL you’ll find are asynchron-
ous (ADSL) and synchronous
(SDSL). ADSL lines differ between
slow upload speed (such as
384 Kbps, 768 Kbps, and 1 Mbps)
and faster download speed (usu-
ally 3–7 Mbps). SDSL has the
same upload and download
speeds, but telecom companies
charge a lot more for the privilege.
DSL encompasses many such
variations, so you’ll often see it
referred to as xDSL.

Cable
Cable offers a different approach to high-speed
Internet access, using regular cable TV cables to
serve up lightning-fast speeds. It offers faster
service than most DSL connections, with a 1–10
Mbps upload and 6–50+ Mbps download. Cable
Internet connections are theoretically available
anywhere you can get cable TV.
Cable Internet connections start with an RG-6
or RG-59 cable coming into your house. The cable
connects to a cable modem that then connects to a
NIC in your PC via UTP Ethernet cable. Figure 18.20 shows a typical cable
setup. One nice advantage of cable over DSL is that if you have a TV tuner card
in your PC, you can use the same cable connection (with a splitter) to watch TV
on your PC. Both DSL and cable modem Internet connections can be used by
two or more computers if they are part of a LAN, including those in a home.
LAN
Most businesses connect their internal local area network (LAN) to an ISP
via some hardware solution that Network+ techs deal with. Figure 18.21
Chapter 18: Learning the Internet

The term modem has been
warped and changed beyond
recognition in modern network-
ing. Both DSL and cable fully
digital Internet connections use
the term modem to describe the
box that takes the incoming sig-
nal from the Internet and trans-
lates it into something the PC
can understand.
• Figure 18.20
Cable connections

shows a typical small-business wiring closet with routers that connect
the LAN to the ISP. You learned about setting up and configuring a
LAN in Chapter 16, “Learning Local Area Networking,” so there’s no
need to go through any basics here. To complete a LAN connection to
the Internet, you need to add a second NIC or a modem to one of the
PCs and then configure that PC as the default connection. We’ll revisit
this idea in a moment with Internet Connection Sharing.
Wireless
Every once in a while a technology comes along that, once the kinks are
smoothed out, works flawlessly, creating a magical computing experi-
ence. Unfortunately, the various wireless networking technologies out
there today don’t fulfill that dream yet. When they work, it’s like
magic. You walk into a coffee shop, sit down, and flip open your laptop
computer. After firing up your Internet browser, suddenly you’re
quaffing lattes and surfing Web sites—with no wires at all.
Suffice it to say that connecting to the Internet via wireless means
that you must connect to a cellular network or to a LAN that’s wired to
an ISP. The local Internet café purchases high-speed Internet service
from the cable or telecom company, for example, and then connects a
wireless access point (WAP) to its network. When you walk in with
your portable PC with wireless NIC and open a Web browser, the wire-
less NIC communicates with the fully wired DHCP server via the WAP
and you’re surfing on the Internet. It appears magically wireless, but
the LAN to ISP connection still uses wires.
Cellular networking is even more seamless. Anywhere you can
connect with your cell phone, you can connect with your cellular
network–aware portable or laptop computer.
Satellite
Satellite connections to the Internet get the data beamed to a satellite
dish on your house or office; a receiver handles the flow of data, even-
tually sending it through an Ethernet cable to the NIC in your PC. I can al-
ready sense people’s eyebrows raising. “Yeah, that’s the download
connection. But what about the upload connection?” Very astute, me heart-
ies! The early days of satellite required you to connect via a modem. You
would upload at the slow 26- to 48-Kbps modem speed, but then get super-
fast downloads from the dish. It worked, so why complain? You really can
move to that shack on the side of the Himalayas to write the great Tibetan
novel and still have DSL- or cable-speed Internet connectivity. Sweet!
Satellite might be the most intriguing of all the technologies used to con-
nect to the Internet today. As with satellite television, though, you need to
have the satellite dish point at the satellites (toward the south if you live in
the United States). The only significant issue to satellite is that the distance
the signal must travel creates a small delay called the satellite latency. This la-
tency is usually unnoticeable unless the signal degrades in foul weather
such as rain and snow.
584

One form of wireless commu-
nication does not require local
wires. For wireless broadband,
the ISP must put up a tower, and
then any building within the line
of sight (perhaps up to ten miles)
can get a high-speed connection.

Windows Internet Connection Sharing
Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) enables one system to share its Internet
connection with other systems on the network, providing a quick and easy
method for multiple systems to use one Internet connection. Modern Win-
dows versions (Windows 2000 through Windows 7) also provide this handy
tool. Figure 18.22 shows a typical setup for ICS. Note the terminology used here.
The PC that connects to the Internet and then shares that connection via ICS with
other machines on a LAN is called the ICS host computer. PCs that connect via
LAN to the ICS host computer are simply called client computers.
To connect multiple computers
to a single ICS host computer re-
quires several things in place. First,
the ICS host computer has to have a
NIC dedicated to the internal con-
nections. If you connect via dial-up,
for example, the ICS host computer
uses a modem to connect to the
Internet. It also has a NIC that
plugs into a switch. Other PCs on
the LAN likewise connect to the
switch. If you connect via some
faster service, such as DSL that uses
a NIC cabled to the DSL receiver,
you’ll need a second NIC in the ICS
host machine to connect to the LAN
and the client computers.
Setting up ICS in Windows is very simple. If you are using Win-
dows 2000 or XP, right-click My Network Places and choose Prop-
erties. If you are using Windows Vista or 7, open the Network and
Sharing Center and click on Manage network connections (Vista) or
Change adapter settings (7) in the left-hand task list. Now access the
Properties dialog box of the connection you wish to share.
Click the Sharing tab (Windows 2000, Vista, and 7) or the Ad-
vanced tab (Windows XP), and select Enable Internet connection sharing
for this connection (Windows 2000) or Allow other network users to
connect through this computer’s Internet connection (Windows XP–7,
Figure 18.23). Clients don’t need any special configuration but should
simply be set to DHCP for their IP address and other configurations.
Common Internet Ports
Once you’ve established a connection between the PC and the ISP,
you can do nothing on the Internet without applications designed
to use one or more TCP/IP services, such as Web browsing and
e-mail. TCP/IP has the following commonly used services:
■
World Wide Web (HTTP and HTTPS)
■
E-mail (POP and SMTP)
■
Newsgroups
■
FTP

Each of these services (sometimes referred to by the overused term TCP/
IP protocols) operates by using defined ports, requires a special application,
and has special settings. As a quick reference, Table 18.1 has some common
port numbers CompTIA would like you to know.
■Virtual Private Networks
Remote connections have been around for a long time, long before the
Internet existed. The biggest drawback about remote connections was the
cost to connect. If you were on one side of the continent and had to connect
to your LAN on the other side of the continent, the only connection option
was a telephone. Or, if you needed
to connect two LANs across the con-
tinent, you ended up paying outra-
geous monthly charges for a private
connection. The introduction of the
Internet gave people wishing to
connect to their home networks a
very cheap connection option, but
with
one
problem:
the
whole
Internet is open to the public. People
wanted to stop using dial-up and
expensive private connections and
use the Internet instead, but they
wanted to do it securely.
Those clever network engineers
worked long and hard and came up
with several solutions to this prob-
lem. Standards have been created
that use encrypted tunnels between
a computer (or a remote network) to
create a private network through
the Internet (Figure 18.24), resulting
in what is called a Virtual Private
Network (VPN).

An encrypted tunnel requires
endpoints—the ends of the tunnel
where the data is encrypted and de-
crypted. In the SSH tunnel you’ve
seen thus far, the client for the appli-
cation sits on one end and the server
sits on the other. VPNs do the same
thing. Either some software running
on a computer or, in some cases, a
dedicated box must act as an end-
point for a VPN (Figure 18.25).
To make VPNs work requires a
protocol that uses one of the many
tunneling protocols available and
adds the capability to ask for an IP
address from a local DHCP server to
give the tunnel an IP address that
matches the subnet of the LAN. The
connection keeps the IP address to
connect to the Internet, but the tun-
nel endpoints must act like NICs
(Figure 18.26). Let’s look at one of
the protocols, PPTP.
PPTP VPNs
So how do we make IP addresses appear out of thin air? Microsoft got the
ball rolling with the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), an advanced
version of a protocol used for dial-up Internet called PPP that handles all of
this right out of the box. The only trick is the endpoints. In Microsoft’s view,
a VPN is intended for individual clients (think employees on the road) to
connect back to the office network, so Microsoft places the PPTP endpoints
on the client and a special remote access server program called Routing and
Remote Access Service (RRAS), originally only available on Windows
Server, on the server (Figure 18.27).
On the Windows client side, you right-click on My Network Places and
click on Create a New Connection (Windows 2000–XP) or right-click on Net-
work and select Set up a connection or network (Windows Vista) from the Net-
work and Sharing Center. This presents you with a dialog box where you
can enter all your VPN server information. Your network administrator will
most likely provide this to you. The result is a virtual network card that, like
any other NIC, gets an IP address from the DHCP server back at the office
(Figure 18.28).
When your computer connects to the RRAS server on the private net-
work, PPTP creates a secure tunnel through the Internet back to the private
LAN. Your client takes on an IP address of that network, as if your computer
were plugged into the LAN back at the office. Even your Internet traffic will
go through your office first. If you open your Web browser, your client will
go across the Internet to the office LAN and then use the LAN’s Internet con-
nection! Because of this, Web browsing is very slow over a VPN.

Endpoints must have their own IP addresses.
A system connected to a VPN
looks as though it’s on the local
network but performs much
slower than if the system were
connected directly back at the
office.

Beyond A+
The areas covered by the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam do a great
job on the more common issues of dealing with the Internet, but a
few hot topics (although beyond the scope of the CompTIA A+
Essentials exam) are so common and important that you need to
know them: online gaming, chatting, and file sharing.
Online Gaming
One of the more exciting and certainly more fun aspects of the
Internet is online gaming. Competing online against a real per-
son or people makes for some pleasant gaming. Enjoying classics
such as Hearts and Backgammon with another human can be
challenging and fun. Another popular genre of online gaming is
the “first-person shooters” format. These games place you in a
small world with up to 32 other players. A great example is
Valve Software’s Counter-Strike: Source (Figure 18.29).
No discussion of online gaming is complete without talking about the
most amazing game type of all: the massively multiplayer online role-
playing game (MMORPG). Imagine being an elfin wizard, joined by a band
of friends, all going on adventures together in worlds so large that it would
take a real 24-hour day to journey across them! Imagine that in this same
world, 2000 to 3000 other players, as well as thousands of game-controlled
characters, are participating! Plenty of MMORPGs are out there, but the
most popular today is World of Warcraft (Figure 18.30).

Each of these games employs good old TCP/IP to send information, us-
ing ports reserved by the game. For instance, the Quake series of games uses
port 26000, while DirectX uses ports 47624 and 2300–2400.

Chatting
If there’s one thing we human be-
ings love to do, it’s chat. The
Internet provides a multitude of
ways to do so, whether by typing or
actual talking. Keep in mind that
chatting occurs in real time. As fast
as you can type or talk, whoever is
at the other end hears or sees what
you have to say. To chat, however,
you need some form of chat soft-
ware. The oldest family of chat pro-
grams is based on the Internet Relay
Chat (IRC) protocol, and the single
most common IRC chat program is
probably mIRC. IRC protocols al-
low for a number of other little ex-
tras as well, such as being able to
share files.
Today, companies such as AOL,
Yahoo!, and Microsoft have made
their own chat programs that not
only provide text chat but also add
features such as voice and video,
turning your PC into a virtual re-
placement
for
your
telephone!
Figure 18.31 shows the popular
Microsoft Windows Live Messenger
software.
File Sharing
The last extra Internet function to discuss is also probably the most contro-
versial: file sharing. File sharing basically consists of a whole bunch of com-
puters with one program loaded, such as Lime Wire or Shareaza. The file-
sharing program enables each of the computers running that program to of-
fer files to share, such as MP3 music files and MPEG movies. Once all of the
file-sharing computers log on to the Internet, any of them can download any
file offered by any other in the group.
File sharing through such distributed sharing software becomes almost
anonymous and free—and that’s the problem. You can share anything, even
copyright-protected music, movies, and more. The music industry in partic-
ular has come out swinging to try to stop file-sharing practices. As a result,
the music industry is working on a way to shut down those persons who
share lots of files. But software developers have countered, creating Internet
protocols such as BitTorrent to handle the distribution and make the file
sharers much more difficult to find and punish. Figure 18.32 shows one of
the more popular BitTorrent protocol programs called µTorrent (the µ is the
symbol for “micro,” so you pronounce it “micro torrent”). BitTorrent has
many legitimate uses as well—its protocol is extremely efficient for the

distribution of large files and has become the method of choice for distribut-
ing Linux distributions and large open-source applications such as Apache
and OpenOffice.
These example programs just scratch the surface of the many applica-
tions that use the Internet. One of the more amazing aspects of TCP/IP is
that its basic design is around 30 years old. We use TCP/IP in ways com-
pletely outside the original concept of its designers, yet TCP/IP continues to
show its power and flexibility. Pretty amazing!

Chapter 18 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises,
you should understand the following about the Internet.
Explain how the Internet works
■
A PC tech needs to know how PCs communicate
with the world for two reasons: (1) to troubleshoot
when a process or piece stops working, and (2) to
communicate knowledgeably with a network
technician who comes in to solve a more complex
issue.
■
The Internet is broken down into three tiers. Tier 1
providers own the fiber-optic backbones that
interconnect at network access points. Backbone
routers create an interwoven framework for
redundant communications.
■
TCP/IP provides the basic software structure for
Internet communications. It provides IP addresses
and the naming scheme for computers on the
Internet. This protocol suite also offers a variety of
other services, including HTTP, which provides
structure for the Web.
■
Internet service providers (ISPs) lease connections
to the Internet from Tier 1 and Tier 2 providers. In
turn, ISPs lease connections to allow individuals
and companies to access the Internet. ISPs may serve
customers nationwide, such as Comcast, or they
may be limited to a small community of users.
■
Connecting to the Internet requires hardware for
connectivity and software to govern the connection
and data flow. The router that connects you to your
ISP is your default gateway.
Connect to the Internet
■
Seven technologies are commonly used to connect
a PC to an ISP. These technologies fit into four
categories: (1) dial-up (analog and ISDN), (2)
dedicated (DSL, cable, and LAN), (3) wireless, and
(4) satellite. Analog dial-up, the slowest connection,
uses a telephone line and a modem. ISDN is a much
faster digital dial-up method. With the exception of
satellite, which may use either a modem or a NIC,
all the other technologies use an Ethernet NIC.
■
A dial-up connection needs hardware, such as a
modem or ISDN terminal adapter, and software,
such as Microsoft’s DUN.
■
A modem converts digital signals from the PC into
analog signals that travel on telephone lines, and
vice versa. An example of serial communication,
the modem transmits data as a series of ones and
zeros. On the other hand, the computer processes
data by using parallel communication or data in
discrete 8-bit chunks. A UART chip converts serial
to parallel and parallel to serial. An external modem
uses the UART chip in the computer’s serial port,
while an internal modem has its own built-in UART.
■
Phone lines measure speed in bauds, or cycles per
second. However, the fastest baud rate a phone line
can achieve is 2400 baud. Today’s modems pack
multiple bits of data into each baud. Although not
technically correct, people use the term baud instead of
bps so often that the terms have become synonymous.
■
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
sets V standards to define the fastest data transfer
speed a modem can handle. Currently V.90 and
V.92 are the highest standards, downloading data
at just a little under 56 Kbps. Upload speeds differ,
with 33.6 Kbps being the fastest for V.90 and
48 Kbps proving the fastest for V.92 modems.
■
Modems may be internal or external. The less-
expensive internal modems usually connect to a
PCI or PCI Express expansion bus slot. Some
motherboards include special expansion slots
used for multiple communications features such as
modems, NICs, and sound cards. AMD calls such
slots ACRs, while Intel has named them CNR slots.
Many motherboards come with integrated modems.
External modems attach to the PC’s serial port or
USB port. Most motherboards today include two or
more USB ports. It is a good idea to choose a USB
modem because you won’t need an external electrical
source and it will likely include a volume control knob.
■
Windows includes configuration options to set up
dial-up networks. Windows XP uses the Network
and Internet Connections applet, Windows 2000
592
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

calls this feature Network and Dial-up Connections,
and Vista uses the Set up a connection or network
wizard. To configure dial-up networking, you’ll need
information from your ISP. Dial-up links to the
Internet use the PPP streaming hardware protocol.
■
If you can’t connect to the Internet, look at the
modem’s properties to make sure the volume is
turned up. Listen, too, for a befuddled voice on the
other end that would indicate your modem is dialing
the wrong number. Other things to check: be sure
the line is plugged into a good phone jack, and make
sure the number and password are correct. If you
still can’t connect to the Internet, call the network
technicians to check that the dial-up networking
settings are correct.
■
An ISDN consists of two types of channels: Bearer,
or B, channels that carry data and voice at 64 Kbps,
and Delta, or D, channels that transmit setup and
configuration information at 16 Kbps. Users can
use one or two B channels, but the most common
setup is the BRI, consisting of two B channels and
one D channel to provide a throughput total of
128 Kbps. Except for the steep cost of installation
and equipment, ISDN lines are only slightly more
expensive than regular phone lines, but this service
is limited to an area within about 18,000 feet of a
central office. ISDN uses a terminal adapter that
looks like a regular modem and may be either
external or internal.
■
DSL modems connect to an ISP by using a standard
telephone line and special connections on each end.
Although service levels vary, typical upload speed
is ~768 Kbps with a download speed of ~3+ Mbps.
A tech usually comes to the house to install a DSL
receiver (often called a DSL modem) as well as a
NIC in the PC. DSL is usually limited to about
18,000 feet from a main phone service switching
center.
■
Cable TV companies offer high-speed Internet
access, with an upload speed of about 1–10 Mbps
up and download transmission rates of 6-50+
Mbps. With a TV tuner card, cable enables you to
watch TV on your PC.
■
Wireless Internet service requires connecting to
a LAN that’s wired to an ISP. The other wireless
option is a satellite connection. Although early
satellite technology required uploads through a
slow modem (26–48 Kbps) and fast downloads
through the dish, newer technology uses the
modem only for the initial setup, sending both
downloads and uploads through the dish.
■
ICS enables multiple systems to use one Internet
connection. Included in all current Windows
versions, ICS uses an ICS host computer connected
to the Internet that then shares the connection via a
LAN with client computers. The ICS host computer
must have a NIC or modem to connect to the
Internet and a NIC that plugs into a hub. The other
PCs then connect to the hub.
Explain VPNs
■
VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, enable you
to connect over the public Internet and access a
remote network as if you were physically plugged
into it. PPTP is the protocol used by Microsoft to
provide this service. It works by creating virtual
network cards that have their own IP address that
match what the LAN uses.

before defeat.”

our PC is under siege. Through your PC, a malicious person can gain
valuable information about you and your habits. He can steal your files. He
can run programs that log your keystrokes and thus gain account names and
passwords, credit card information, and more. He can run software that takes
over much of your computer processing time and use it to send spam or steal
from others. The threat is real and right now. Worse, he’s doing one or more of
these things to your clients as I write these words. You need to secure your
computer, your users, and your data from these attacks.

■Security Concepts
When most people think of computer security, they think of Internet attacks,
viruses, and all sorts of real or imagined electronic threats. In their minds,
protecting themselves against these threats is paramount to all else, but, as
with most things in life, it’s important to learn the basics before you move on
to more advanced things. Specifically, techs should learn to protect their
equipment from physical theft, how to properly classify and protect their
data, and how to create proper passwords and authentication schemes.
These security fundamentals serve as a basis for all other computer security.
Data Classification and Compliance
Larger organizations, such as government entities, benefit greatly from orga-
nizing their data according to its sensitivity—what’s called data classification—
and making certain that computer hardware and software stay as uniform as
possible. In addition, many government and internal regulations apply fairly
rigorously to this type of organizations.
Data classification systems vary by the organization, but a common
scheme classifies documents as public, internal use only, highly confiden-
tial, top secret, and so on. Using a classification scheme enables employees
such as techs to know very quickly what to do with documents, the drives
containing documents, and more. Your strategy for recycling a computer
system left from a migrated user, for example, will differ a lot if the data on
the drive was classified as internal use only or top secret.
Compliance means, in a nutshell, that members of an organization or
company must abide by or comply with all of the rules that apply to the or-
ganization or company. Statutes with funny names such as Sarbanes-Oxley
impose certain behaviors or prohibitions on what people can and cannot do
in the workplace.
From a technician’s point of view, the most common compliance issue
revolves around software, such as what sort of software users can be al-
lowed to install on their computers or, conversely, why you have to tell a
user that he can’t install the latest application that may help him do the job
more effectively because that software isn’t on the approved list. This can
lead to some uncomfortable confrontations, but it’s part of a tech’s job.
The concepts behind compliance in IT are not, as some might imagine at
first blush, to stop you from being able to work effectively. Rather they’re
designed to stop users with not quite enough technical skill or knowledge
from installing malicious programs or applications that will destabilize
their systems. This keeps technical support calls down and enables techs to
focus on more serious problems.
Access Control
Access is the key. If you can control access to the data, programs, and other
computing resources, you’ve secured your systems. Access control is com-
posed of four interlinked areas that a good security-minded tech should
think about: physical security, authentication, users and groups, and secu-
rity policies. Much of this you know from previous chapters, but this section
should help tie it all together as a security topic.
Chapter 19: Learning Computer Security
597

Secure Physical Area and Lock Down Your System
The first order of security is to block access to the physical hardware from
people who shouldn’t have access. This isn’t rocket science. Lock the door.
Don’t leave a PC unattended when logged in. In fact, don’t ever leave a sys-
tem logged in, even as a limited user. God help you if you walk away from a
server still logged in as an administrator. You’re tempting fate.
For that matter, when you see a user’s computer logged in and unat-
tended, do the user and your company a huge favor and lock the computer.
Just walk up and press WINDOWS LOGO KEY-L on the keyboard to lock the sys-
tem. It works in all versions of Windows.
Authentication
Security starts with properly implemented authentication, which means in
essence how the computer determines who can or should access it. And
once accessed, what that user can do. A computer can authenticate users
through software or hardware, or a combination of both.
Software Authentication: Proper Passwords
It’s still rather shocking to me
to power up a friend’s computer and go straight to his or her desktop, or
with my married-with-kids friends, to click one of the parents’ user account
icons and not be prompted for a password. This is just wrong! I’m always
tempted to assign passwords right then and there—and not tell them the
passwords, of course—so they’ll see the error of their ways when they try to
log in next. I don’t do it but always try to explain gently the importance of
good passwords.
There’s not a person alive today who doesn’t have to remember the
password to something or other, even if it’s just their email, so I won’t bela-
bor the point here. Suffice it to say that you need to make certain that all of
your users have proper passwords. Don’t let them write passwords down
or tape them to the underside of their mouse pads either!
It’s not just access to Windows that you need to think about. There’s al-
ways the temptation for people to hack the system and do mean things,
such as changing CMOS settings, opening up the case, and even stealing
hard drives. Any of these actions render the computer inoperable to the ca-
sual user until a tech can undo the damage or replace components. All
modern CMOS setup utilities come with a number of tools to protect your
computer, such as drive lock, intrusion detection, and of course system ac-
cess passwords such as the one shown in Figure 19.1. Refer to Chapter 7,
“Learning Motherboards,” to refresh yourself on what you can do at a BIOS
level to protect your computer.
598
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Some criminals attempt to
gain access to a secure system
by pretending to be someone
else, either in person, over the
phone, or in an e-mail. For ex-
ample, a hacker might call an
employee inside an organization
they want to attack pretending
to be tech support in order to
ask for that employee’s user
name and password. This type
of attack is called social engineer-
ing, and it’s one of the most
common methods for discover-
ing passwords.
Tech Tip
Proper Passwords
So, what goes into making a good
password? This is a subject that
security geeks argue over inces-
santly, but there are a few gener-
ally agreed-upon standards. First,
a good password should contain
three elements: letters, numbers,
and special characters (such as
exclamation and question marks,
or even just capital letters). Using
common words makes a password
easier to guess, so adding in num-
bers and special characters makes
cracking a password a much more
difficult task for the evildoer. You
should also make sure your pass-
words are at a minimum twelve
characters long. Just like with bi-
nary numbers, each extra “digit”
on a password makes that pass-
word exponentially harder to
crack, so the longer the better.
Finally—and this is where most
people fall flat on their faces—
don’t use things like your birth-
day, your anniversary, or your
pet’s name as your password.
These are all potentially common
knowledge for everyone who you
know, and the nefarious can dis-
cover this information very
quickly in order to guess your
password.

Hardware Authentication
Smart cards and biometric
devices enable modern systems to authenticate users
with more authority than mere passwords. Smart cards
are credit-card-sized cards with circuitry that can iden-
tify the bearer of the card. Smart cards are relatively
common for such tasks as authenticating users for mass
transit systems, for example, but are fairly uncommon in
computers. Figure 19.2 shows a smart card and key-
board combination.
People can guess or discover passwords, but forging
someone’s fingerprints is a lot harder. The keyboard in
Figure 19.3 authenticates users on a local machine by us-
ing fingerprints. Other devices that will do the trick are
key fobs, retinal scanners, and PC cards for laptop com-
puters. Devices that require some sort of physical, flesh-
and-blood authentication are called biometric devices.
Clever manufacturers have developed key fobs and smart cards that use
radio frequency identification (RFID) to transmit authentication informa-
tion so users don’t have to insert something into a computer or card reader.
The Privaris plusID combines, for example, a biometric fingerprint fob with
an RFID tag that makes security as easy as opening a garage door remotely!
Figure 19.4 shows a plusID device.
NTFS, not FAT32!
The file system on a hard drive matters a lot when it comes to security. On a
Windows machine with multiple users, you simply must use NTFS or you
have no security at all. Not just primary drives but also any secondary
drives in computers in your care should be formatted as NTFS, with the ex-
ception of removable drives such as the one you use to back up your system.
When you run into a multiple-drive system that has a second
or third drive formatted as FAT32, you can use the CONVERT
command-line utility to go from FAT to NTFS. The syntax is
pretty straightforward. To convert a D: drive from FAT or FAT32
to NTFS, for example, you’d type the following:
CONVERT D: /FS:NTFS

Microsoft does not claim that

curity device. Because it enables
a person to log on to a local ma-
chine, though, I think it falls into
the category of authentication
devices.

You can substitute a mount name in place of the drive letter in case you
have a mounted volume. The command has a few extra switches as well, so
at the command prompt, type a /? after the CONVERT command to see all of
your options.
Users and Groups
Windows uses user accounts and groups as the bedrock of access control. A
user account is assigned to a group, such as Users, Power Users, or Adminis-
trators, and by association gets certain permissions on the computer. Using
NTFS enables the highest level of control over data resources.
Assigning users to groups is a great first step in controlling a local ma-
chine, but this feature really shines once you go to a networked environ-
ment. Let’s go there now.
User Account Control Through Groups
Access to user accounts should be restricted to the assigned individuals, and
those who configure the permissions to those accounts must remember the
Principle of Least Privilege: Accounts should have permission to access only
the resources they need and no more. Tight control of user accounts is critical
to preventing unauthorized access. Disabling unused accounts is an impor-
tant part of this strategy, but good user account control goes far deeper than
that. One of your best tools for user account control is groups. Instead of giv-
ing permissions/rights to individual user accounts, give them to groups; this
makes keeping track of the permissions assigned to individual user accounts
much easier. Figure 19.5 shows me giving permissions to a group for a folder
in Windows Vista. Once a group is created and its permissions set, you can
then add user accounts to that group as needed. Any user account that be-
comes a member of a group automatically gets the permissions
assigned to that group. Figure 19.6 shows me adding a user to a
newly created group in the same Windows Vista system.
Groups are a great way to achieve increased complexity
without increasing the administrative burden on network ad-
ministrators because all network operating systems combine
permissions. When a user is a member of more than one group,
which permissions does that user have with respect to any par-
ticular resource? In all network operating systems, the permis-
sions of the groups are combined, and the result is what you call
the effective permissions the user has to access the resource. As
an example, if Rita is a member of the Sales group, which has
List Folder Contents permission to a folder, and she is also a
member of the Managers group, which has Read and Execute
permissions to the same folder, Rita will have both List Folder
Contents and Read and Execute permissions to that folder.
Watch out for default user accounts and groups—they can
become secret backdoors to your network! All network oper-
ating systems have a default Everyone group that can be used
to sneak into shared resources easily. This Everyone group, as
its name implies, literally includes anyone who connects to
that resource. Windows gives full control to the Everyone
group by default, for example, so make sure you know to lock
this down!

and organizational units
only do one thing for you:
They let you keep track of
your user accounts, so
you know they are only
available for those who
need them, and they can

Security Policies
Although permissions control how users access shared resources, there are
other functions you should control that are outside the scope of resources.
For example, do you want users to be able to access a command prompt on
their Windows system? Do you want users to be able to install software?
Would you like to control what systems a user can log into or at what time of
day a user can log in? All network operating systems provide you with
some capability to control these and literally hundreds of other security pa-
rameters, under what Windows calls policies. I like to think of policies as per-
missions for activities as opposed to true permissions, which control access
to resources.
A policy is usually applied to a user account, a computer, or a group.
Let’s use the example of a network composed of Windows XP Professional
systems with a Windows 2003 Server system. Every Windows XP system
has its own local policies program, which enables policies to be placed on
that system only. Figure 19.7 shows the tool you use to set local policies on
an individual system, called Local Security Settings, being used to deny the
user account Danar the capability to log on locally.
Local policies work great for individual systems, but they can be a pain
to configure if you want to apply the same settings to more than one PC on
your network. If you want to apply policy settings en masse, you need to step
up to Windows Active Directory domain-based Group Policy. By using
Group Policy, you can exercise deity-like—Microsoft prefers to use the term
granular—control over your network clients.

Although the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam doesn’t expect you to know
how to implement policies on any type of network, you are expected to un-
derstand that policies exist, especially on Windows networks, and that they
can do amazing things to control what users can do on their systems. If you
ever try to get to a command prompt on a Windows system only to discover
the Run command is dimmed, blame it on a policy, not the computer!
■Malicious Software
The beauty of the Internet is the ease of accessing resources just about any-
where on the globe, all from the comfort of your favorite chair. This connec-
tion, however, runs both ways, and people from all over the world can
potentially access your computer from the comfort of their evil lairs. The
Internet is awash with malicious software—malware—that is, even at this
moment, trying to infect your systems. Malware consists of computer pro-
grams designed to break into computers or cause havoc on computers. The
most common types of malware are grayware, spam, viruses, Trojan horses,
and worms. You need to understand the different types of malware so you
can combat them for you and your users successfully.
Grayware
Programs that intrude unwanted into your computing experience but don’t
actually do any damage to your systems or data—what’s called grayware—
can make that computing experience less than perfect. On most systems, the
Internet Web browser client is the most often used piece of software. Over
the years, Web sites have come up with more and more ways to try to get
you to see what they want you to see: their advertising. When the Web first
got underway, we were forced to look at an occasional banner ad. In the past
few years, Web site designers have become much more sophisticated, creat-
ing a number of intrusive and irritating ways to get you to part with your
money in one form or another.
There are basically three irritating grayware types: pop-ups, spyware,
and adware. Pop-ups are those surprise browser windows that appear auto-
matically when you visit a Web site, proving themselves irritating and un-
wanted and nothing else. Spyware, meanwhile, defines a family of programs
that run in the background on your PC, each sending information about
your browsing habits to the company that installed it on your system.
Adware is not generally as malicious as spyware, but it works similarly to
display ads on your system. As such, these programs download new ads
Chapter 19: Learning Computer Security
603

and generate undesirable network traffic. Of the three, spyware is much less
noticeable but far more nefarious. At its worst, spyware can fire up pop-up
windows of competing products on the Web site you’re currently viewing.
For example, you might be perusing a bookseller’s Web site, only to have a
pop-up from a competitor’s site appear.
Pop-Ups
Getting rid of pop-ups is actually rather tricky. You’ve probably noticed
that most of these pop-up browser windows don’t look like browser win-
dows at all. They have no menu bar, button bar, or address window, yet
they are separate browser windows. HTML coding permits Web site and
advertising designers to remove the usual navigation aids from a browser
window so all you’re left with is the content. In fact, as I’ll describe in a min-
ute, some pop-up browser windows are deliberately designed to mimic
similar pop-up alerts from the Windows OS. They might even have buttons
similar to Windows’ own exit buttons, but you might find that when you
click them, you wind up with more pop-up windows instead! What to do?
The first thing you need to know when dealing with pop-ups is how to
close them without actually having to risk clicking them. As I said, most
pop-ups have removed all navigation aids, and many are also configured to
appear on your monitor screen in a position that places the browser win-
dow’s exit button—the little X button in the upper-right corner—outside of
your visible screen area. Some even pop up behind the active browser win-
dow and wait there in the background. Most annoying! To remedy this, use
alternate means to close the pop-up browser window. For instance, you can
right-click the browser window’s taskbar icon to generate a pop-up menu of
your own. Select Close, and the window should go away. You can also press
ALT-TAB to bring the browser window in question to the forefront and then
press ALT-F4 to close it.
Most Web browsers have features to prevent pop-up ads in the first
place, but I’ve found that these types of applications are sometimes too thor-
ough. That is, they tend to prevent all new browser windows from opening,
even those you want to view. Still, they’re free to try, so have a look to see if
they suit your needs. Applications such as AdSubtract control a variety of
Internet annoyances, including pop-up windows, cookies, and Java applets,
and are more configurable—you can specify what you want to allow on any
particular domain address—but the fully functional versions usually cost at
least something, and that much control is too confusing for most novice-
level users.
Spyware
Some types of spyware go considerably beyond the level of intrusion. They
can use your computer’s resources to run distributed computing applications,
capture your keystrokes to steal passwords, reconfigure your dial-up set-
tings to use a different phone number at a much higher connection charge,
or even use your Internet connection and e-mail address list to propagate it-
self to other computers in a virus-like fashion! Are you concerned yet?
Setting aside the legal and ethical issues—and there are many—you should
at least appreciate that spyware can seriously impact your PC’s performance
and cause problems with your Internet connection. The threat is real, so what
604
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

practical steps can you take to protect yourself? Let’s look at how to prevent
spyware installation and how to detect and remove any installed spyware.
How does this spyware get into your system in the first place? Obvi-
ously, sensible people don’t download and install something that they
know is going to compromise their computers. Makers of spyware know
this, so they bundle their software with some other program or utility that
purports to give you some benefit.
What kind of benefit? How about free access to MP3
music files? A popular program called Kazaa does that.
How about a handy e-wallet utility that remembers your
many screen names, passwords, and even your credit-card
numbers to make online purchases easier and faster? A pro-
gram called Gator does that, and many other functions as
well. How about browser enhancements, performance
boosters, custom cursor effects, search utilities, buddy lists,
file savers, or media players? The list goes on and on, yet
they all share one thing: they’re simply window-dressing
for the real purpose of the software. So you see, for the most
part, spyware doesn’t need to force its way into your PC. In-
stead, it saunters calmly through the front door. If the
graphic in Figure 19.9 looks familiar, you might have in-
stalled some of this software yourself.
Some spyware makers use more aggressive means to
get you to install their software. Instead of offering you
some sort of attractive utility, they use fear tactics and deception to try to
trick you into installing their software. One popular method is to use pop-up
browser windows crudely disguised as Windows’ own system warnings
(Figure 19.10). When clicked, these may trigger a flood of other browser
windows, or may even
start a file download.
The lesson here is sim-
ple: Don’t install these pro-
grams! Careful reading of
the
software’s
license
agreement before you in-
stall a program is a good
idea, but realistically, it
does little to protect your
PC. With that in mind,
here are a couple of pre-
ventive measures you can
take to keep parasitic soft-
ware off of your system.
If you visit a Web site
and are prompted to in-
stall a third-party applica-
tion or plug-in that you’ve
never heard of, don’t in-
stall it. Well-known and
reputable plug-ins, such

• Figure 19.10
A spyware pop-up browser window, disguised as a Windows alert

as Adobe’s Shockwave or Flash, are safe, but be suspicious of any others.
Don’t click anywhere inside of a pop-up browser window, even if it looks just
like a Windows alert window or DOS command-line prompt—as I just men-
tioned, it’s probably fake and the Close button is likely a hyperlink. Instead,
use other means to close the window, such as pressing ALT-F4 or right-clicking
the browser window’s icon on the taskbar and selecting Close.
You can also install spyware detection and removal software on your
system and run it regularly. Let’s look at how to do that.
Some spyware makers are reputable enough to include a routine for
uninstalling their software. Gator, for instance, makes it fairly easy to get rid of
their programs; just use the Windows Add/Remove Programs applet in the
Control Panel. Others, however, aren’t quite so cooperative. In fact, because
spyware is so—well, sneaky—it’s entirely possible that your system already has
some installed that you don’t even know about. How do you find out?
Windows comes with Windows Defender, a fine tool for catching most
spyware, but it’s not perfect. The better solution is to back up Windows De-
fender with a second spyware removal program. There are several on the mar-
ket, but two that I highly recommend are Lavasoft’s Ad-Aware (Figure 19.11)
and PepiMK’s Spybot Search & Destroy.
Both of these applications work exactly as advertised. They detect and
delete spyware of all sorts—hidden files and folders, cookies, Registry keys
and values, you name it. Ad-
Aware is free for personal use,
while Spybot Search & Destroy is
shareware (Figure 19.12). Many
times I’ve used both programs at
the same time because one tends
to catch what the other misses.
Spam
E-mail that comes into your Inbox
from a source that’s not a friend,
family member, or colleague, and
that you didn’t ask for, can create
huge problems for your computer
and you. This unsolicited e-mail,
called spam, accounts for a huge
percentage
of
traffic
on
the
Internet. Spam comes in many fla-
vors, from legitimate businesses

trying to sell you products to scammers who just want to take your money.
Hoaxes, pornography, and get-rich-quick schemes pour into the Inboxes of
most e-mail users. They waste your time and can easily offend.
You can use several options to cope with the flood of spam. The first op-
tion is defense. Never post your e-mail address on the Internet. One study
tested this theory and found that over 97 percent of the spam received during
the study went to e-mail addresses they had posted on the public Internet.
Filters and filtering software can block spam at your mail server and at
your computer. AOL implemented blocking schemes in 2004, for example,
that dropped the average spam re-
ceived by its subscribers by a large
percentage, perhaps as much as
50 percent. You can set most e-mail
programs to block e-mail from
specific people—good to use if
someone is harassing you—or to
specific people. You can block by
subject line or keywords. Most
people use a third-party anti-
spam program instead of using
the filters in their e-mail program.
Viruses
Just as a biological virus gets passed from person to person, a computer
virus is a piece of malicious software that gets passed from computer to com-
puter (Figure 19.13). A computer virus is designed to attach itself to a pro-
gram on your computer. It could be your e-mail program, your word

Fight Spam Right!
Spam filtering software that you purchase and put on your computer
can help, but you have to do some research to see which software offers
the best performance. You want to avoid software that causes false
positives—mislabeling acceptable e-mail as spam—because you miss le-
gitimate e-mail messages from family and friends. So, fire up your
trusty Web browser and do some searching.
Start by going to Google and searching for anti-spam software re-
views. One of the first sites that should come up takes you to PC Maga-
zine’s review list, which is kept up to date. What’s the current Editor’s

processor, or even a game. Whenever you use the in-
fected program, the virus goes into action and does
whatever it was designed to do. It can wipe out your
e-mail or even erase your entire hard drive! Viruses
are also sometimes used to steal information or send
spam e-mails to everyone in your address book.
Trojans
Trojans are true, freestanding programs that do some-
thing other than what the person who runs the pro-
gram thinks they will do, much as the Trojan horse
did in antiquity. An example of a Trojan virus is a pro-
gram that a person thinks is an antivirus program but
is actually a virus. Some Trojans are quite sophisti-
cated. It might be a game that works perfectly well,
but causes some type of damage when the user quits
the game.
Worms
Similar to a Trojan, a worm is a complete program that travels from machine
to machine, usually through computer networks. Most worms are designed
to take advantage of security problems in operating systems and install
themselves on vulnerable machines. They can copy themselves over and
over again on infected networks and can create so much activity that they
overload the network by consuming bandwidth, in worst cases even bring-
ing chunks of the entire Internet to a halt.
You can do several things to protect yourself and your data against these
threats. First, make sure you are running up-to-date virus software—especially
if you connect to the Internet via an always-on broadband connection. You
should also be protected by a firewall, either as part of your network hardware
or by means of a software program. (See the sections on antivirus programs
and firewalls later in this chapter.)
Because worms most commonly infect systems through security flaws
in operating systems, the next defense against them is to make sure you
have the latest security patches installed on your version of Windows. A
security patch is an addition to the operating system to patch a hole in the op-
erating system code. You can download security patches from the Microsoft
Update Web site (Figure 19.14).
Microsoft’s Windows Update tool is handy for Windows users as it pro-
vides a simple method to ensure that your version’s security is up to date.
The one downside is that not everyone remembers to run Windows Update.
Don’t wait until something goes wrong on your computer or you hear on
the news that another nasty program is running rampant across the
Internet. Run Windows Update weekly (or even better, automatically) as a
part of your normal system maintenance. Keeping your patches up to date is
called patch management, and it goes a long way toward keeping your system
safe.

■Virus Prevention and Recovery
The only way to protect your PC permanently from getting a virus is to dis-
connect from the Internet and never permit any potentially infected soft-
ware to touch your precious computer. Because neither scenario is likely
these days, you need to use a specialized antivirus program to help stave off
the inevitable virus assaults. When you discover infected systems, you need
to know how to stop the spread of the virus to other computers and how to
fix infected computers.
Antivirus Programs
An antivirus program protects your PC in two ways. It can be both sword and
shield, working in an active seek-and-destroy mode and in a passive sentry
mode. When ordered to seek and destroy, the program scans the computer’s
boot sector and files for viruses and, if it finds any, presents you with the
available options for removing or disabling them. Antivirus programs can
also operate as virus shields that passively monitor your computer’s activity,
checking for viruses only when certain events occur, such as a program exe-
cuting or a file being downloaded.
Antivirus programs use different techniques to combat different types
of viruses. They detect boot sector viruses simply by comparing the drive’s
boot sector to a standard boot sector. This works because most boot sectors
Chapter 19: Learning Computer Security
609
• Figure 19.14
Microsoft Update

are basically the same. Some antivirus programs make a backup copy of the
boot sector. If they detect a virus, the programs use that backup copy to re-
place the infected boot sector. Executable viruses are a little more difficult to
find because they can be on any file in the drive. To detect executable vi-
ruses, the antivirus program uses a library of signatures. A signature is the
code pattern of a known virus. The antivirus program compares an execut-
able file to its library of signatures. There have been instances where a per-
fectly clean program coincidentally held a virus signature. Usually the
antivirus program’s creator provides a patch to prevent further alarms.
Now that you understand the types of viruses and how antivirus pro-
grams try to protect against them, let’s review a few terms that are often
used when describing certain traits of viruses.
Polymorphics/Polymorphs
A polymorph virus attempts to change its signature to prevent detection by
antivirus programs, usually by continually scrambling a bit of useless code.
Fortunately, the scrambling code itself can be identified and used as the
signature—once the antivirus makers become aware of the virus. One tech-
nique used to combat unknown polymorphs is to have the antivirus pro-
gram create a checksum on every file in the drive. A checksum in this context
is a number generated by the software based on the contents of the file
rather than the name, date, or size of that file. The algorithms for creating
these checksums vary among different antivirus programs (they are also
usually kept secret to help prevent virus makers from coming up with ways
to beat them). Every time a program is run, the antivirus program calculates
a new checksum and compares it with the earlier calculation. If the
checksums are different, it is a sure sign of a virus.
Stealth
The term “stealth” is more of a concept than
an actual virus function. Most stealth virus
programs are boot sector viruses that use
various methods to hide from antivirus
software. The AntiEXE stealth virus hooks
on to a little-known but often-used software
interrupt, for example, running only when
that interrupt runs. Others make copies of
innocent-looking files.
Virus Prevention Tips
The secret to preventing damage from a ma-
licious software attack is to keep from get-
ting a virus in the first place. As discussed
earlier, all good antivirus programs include
a virus shield that scans e-mail, downloads,
running programs, and so on automatically
(Figure 19.15).
610
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 19.15
A virus shield in action

Use your antivirus shield. It is also a good idea to scan PCs daily for pos-
sible virus attacks. All antivirus programs include terminate-and-stay resi-
dent programs (TSRs) that run every time the PC is booted. Last but not
least, know the source of any software before you load it. Although the
chance of commercial, shrink-wrapped software having a virus is virtually
nil (there have been a couple of well-publicized exceptions), that illegal copy
of Unreal Tournament you borrowed from a local hacker should definitely
be inspected with care.
Keep your antivirus program updated. New viruses appear daily, and
your program needs to know about them. The list of virus signatures your
antivirus program can recognize is called the definition file, and you must
keep that definition file up to date so your antivirus software has the latest
signatures. Fortunately, most antivirus programs update themselves auto-
matically. Further, you should periodically update the core antivirus soft-
ware programming—called the engine—to employ the latest refinements
the developers have included.
Virus Recovery Tips
When the inevitable happens and either your computer or one of your
user’s computers gets infected by a computer virus, you need to follow cer-
tain steps to stop the problem from spreading and get the computer back up
safely into service. Try this five-step process.

Recognize and Quarantine
The first step is to recognize that a potential virus outbreak has occurred. If
you’re monitoring network traffic and one computer starts spewing e-mail,
that’s a good sign. Or users might complain that a computer that was run-
ning snappily the day before seems very sluggish.
Many networks employ software such as the open-source PacketFence
that automatically monitors network traffic and can cut a machine off the
network if that machine starts sending suspicious packets. You can also
quarantine a computer manually by disconnecting the network cable. Once
you’re sure the machine isn’t capable of infecting others, you’re ready to
find the virus and get rid of it.
Search and Destroy
Once you’ve isolated the infected computer (or computers), you need to get
to a safe boot environment and run your antivirus software. You can try
Windows Safe Mode first, because it doesn’t require anything but a reboot.
If that doesn’t work, or you suspect a boot sector virus, you need to turn to
an external bootable source, such as a bootable CD or flash memory drive.
Chapter 19: Learning Computer Security
611
Be sure to turn off System
Restore before cleaning up a
virus—otherwise Windows
might keep a copy of the virus
in the system backup files!

Get into the habit of keeping around an antivirus
CD-R—a bootable CD-R disc with a copy of an
antivirus program. If you suspect a virus, use the
disc, even if your antivirus program claims to have
eliminated the virus. Turn off the PC and reboot it
from the antivirus disc. (You might have to change
CMOS settings to boot to an optical disc.) This will
put you in a clean boot environment that you know
is free from any boot sector viruses. If you only sup-
port fairly recent computers, most have an option to
boot to a USB flash drive, so you can put a boot envi-
ronment on a thumb drive for even faster startup
speeds.
You have several options for creating the
bootable CD-R or flash drive. First, some antivirus
software comes in a bootable version, such as the
avast! Virus Cleaner Tool (Figure 19.16).
Second, you can download a copy of Linux that
offers a LiveCD option such as Ubuntu. With a
LiveCD, you boot to the CD and install a complete
working copy of the operating system into RAM,
never touching or accessing the hard drive, to give
you full Internet-ready access to many online
antivirus sites. (You’ll obviously need Internet ac-
cess for those tools.) Kaspersky Labs provides a nice
option at www.kaspersky.com.
Finally, you can download and burn a copy of the Ultimate Boot CD. It
comes stocked with several antivirus programs, so you wouldn’t need any
other tool. Find it at www.ultimatebootcd.com. The only downside is that
the antivirus engines will be out of date, as will their virus encyclopedias.
Once you get to a boot environment, run your antivirus program’s most
comprehensive virus scan. Then check all removable media that were ex-
posed to the system, as well as any
other machine that might have re-
ceived data from it or that is net-
worked to the cleaned machine. A
virus or other malicious program
can often lie dormant for months
before
anyone
knows
of
its
presence.
E-mail is still a common source
of viruses, and opening infected
e-mails is a common way to get in-
fected. Viewing an e-mail in a pre-
view window opens the e-mail
message and exposes your com-
puter to some viruses. Download
files only from sites you know to
be safe, and of course avoid the

Tech Tip
BartPE and Windows PE
For those who like to create custom tools, you can make your own boot environment and
stock it with the latest antivirus software of your choice. Use one of two preinstalled envi-
ronment (PE) tools, BartPE and Windows PE.
BartPE is a third-party tool written by Bart Lagerweij that enables you to create a
graphical bootable version of Windows XP, complete with software. You need a legit-
imate copy of Windows XP (Home or Professional) to create the bootable media, as
BartPE pulls from the Windows setup files. You can then add various plug-ins to get
antivirus support. Find it here: www.nu2.nu/pebuilder.
Microsoft made available Windows PE 2.0 (Windows PE 3.0 for Windows 7
should be available by the time you read this) for Windows Vista for installation as-
sistance on multiple computers. The boot environment created also enables you to
run some software, though it’s not as easy as in BartPE. Download Windows PE
from Microsoft.

less reputable corners of the Internet, which are the most likely places to
pick up computer infections.
Remediate
Virus infections can do a lot of damage to a system, especially to sensitive
files needed to load Windows, so you might need to remediate formerly in-
fected systems after cleaning off the drive or drives. Remediation simply
means that you fix things the virus harmed. This can mean replacing cor-
rupted Windows Registry files or even startup files.
If you can’t start Windows after the virus scan is finished, you need to
boot to a Windows 2000/XP installation disc, run Setup, select Repair, and
then select Recovery Console to boot to the Recovery Console in Windows
2000/XP. If you’re running Vista or 7, just boot into a repair environment off
of the installation media
Once in the Recovery Console, you’ll have access to tools to repair the
boot sector (or boot blocks, as CompTIA calls them) through the FIXMBR and
FIXBOOT commands. You can run BOOTCFG to rebuild a corrupted
BOOT.INI file. EXPAND will enable you to grab any replacement files from
the Windows CAB files.
With the Windows Vista repair environment, you have access to more
repair tools, such as Startup Repair, System Restore, Windows Complete PC
Restore, and the command prompt (Figure 19.17). Run the appropriate op-
tion for the situation and you should have the machine properly remediated
in a jiffy.

Educate
The best way to keep from having to deal with malware and grayware is ed-
ucation. It’s your job as the IT person to talk to users, especially the ones
whose systems you’ve just spent the last hour cleaning of nasties, about how
to avoid these programs. Show them samples of dangerous e-mails they
should not open, Web sites to avoid, and the types of programs they should
not install and use on the network. Any user who understands the risks of
questionable actions on their computers will usually do the right thing and
stay away from malware.
Finally, have your users run antivirus and antispyware programs regu-
larly. Schedule them while interfacing with the user so you know it will
happen.
Firewalls
Firewalls are an essential tool in the fight against malicious programs on the
Internet. Firewalls are devices or software that protect an internal network
from unauthorized access to and from the Internet at large. Hardware fire-
walls use a number of methods to protect networks, such as hiding IP ad-
dresses and blocking TCP/IP ports. Most SOHO networks use a hardware
firewall, such as the Linksys router shown in Figure 19.18. These devices do
a great job.
Every version of Windows since Windows XP Service Pack 2 comes with
an excellent software firewall, called the Windows Firewall (Figure 19.19). It
can also handle the heavy lifting of port blocking, security logging, and
more.
614
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
Almost all routers come with
built-in firewalls that enable you
to create Access Control Lists
(ACLs). An ACL might filter by
port number, IP address, MAC
address, time of day, day of the
week, or even Web addresses.
• Figure 19.18

Windows Firewall

You can access the Windows Firewall by opening the Win-
dows Firewall applet in the Control Panel. If you’re running the
Control Panel in Category View, click the Security Center icon
(Figure 19.20) and then click the Windows Firewall option in the
Windows Security Center dialog box. Figure 19.21 illustrates
the Exceptions tab on the Windows Firewall, showing the appli-
cations allowed to use the TCP/IP ports on my computer.

Chapter 19 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the
exercises, you should understand the following
about computer security.
Describe key security concepts
■
Data classification systems vary by the organization,
but a common scheme classifies documents as
public, internal use only, highly confidential, top
secret, and so on. Using a classification scheme
enables employees such as techs to know very
quickly what to do with documents, drives
containing documents, and more.
■
Compliance means that members of an organization
or company must abide by or comply with all of the
rules that apply to the organization or company.
From a technician’s point of view, the most common
compliance issue revolves around software, such as
what sort of software users can be allowed to install
on their computers. Compliance keeps technical
support calls down and enables techs to focus on
more serious problems.
■
Controlling access to programs, data, and other
computing resources is the key to securing your
system. Access control includes four interlinked
areas requiring your attention: physical security,
authentication, users and groups, and security
policies.
■
Store computers with sensitive data in a locked
room and never walk away from your computer
while logged in. Log out or lock the computer by
pressing WINDOWS LOGO KEY-L.
Define and describe various forms
of malicious software
■
Malware includes grayware, spam, viruses, Trojan
horses, and worms—all of which can wreak havoc
on your system.
■
Irritating Web browser problems include pop-ups,
spyware, and adware. Many pop-ups remove the
navigation aids from the browser window or
mimic Windows dialog boxes. To safely close a
pop-up, right-click the pop-up’s taskbar icon and
choose Close, or press ALT-TAB until the pop-up
window is active and then press ALT-F4 to close it.
■
Spyware can use your computer’s resources to run
distributed computing applications, capture
keystrokes to steal passwords, or worse. Spyware
typically disguises itself as a useful utility, so be
vigilant about what you install. Some spyware can
be removed via Add or Remove Programs, but for
stubborn spyware, use a third-party tool such as
Lavasoft’s Ad-Aware or PepiMK’s Spybot Search
& Destroy.
■
Unsolicited e-mail is called spam. Never post your
e-mail address on the Internet; over 97 percent of
spam comes from e-mail addresses posted online.
Spam filters can block spam at the mail server or at
your computer. You can set most e-mail programs
to block e-mail sent from specific people or to a
specific person.
■
A virus is a piece of malicious software that is
passed from computer to computer and is
designed to attach itself to another program on
your computer. Trojans are freestanding programs
that do something other than the user expects it to
do when run, such as expecting a game to run but
erasing CMOS settings instead. A worm is a
freestanding program that takes advantage of
security flaws and copies itself over and over
again, thereby bogging down a network.
Explain how to protect computers from malicious
software and how to recover affected computers
■
To help protect a computer from malware, make
sure to run up-to-date antivirus software, use a
firewall, and apply all security patches for your
software and operating system. Run Windows
Update automatically, or at least weekly if you
choose to configure it for manual updates.
■
Antivirus software works in active mode to scan
your file system for viruses and in passive mode by
monitoring your computer’s activity and checking
for viruses in response to an action, such as
running a program or downloading a file. The
software detects boot sector viruses by comparing
the drive’s boot sector to a standard boot sector.
To detect executable viruses, a library of virus
signatures is used.
616
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials

■
Polymorph viruses attempt to change their
signature to prevent detection by antivirus
software. Fortunately, the scrambled code itself can
be used as a signature. A checksum, based on file
contents, can be created for every file on the drive.
If the checksum changes, it is a sign of a virus
infection. Most stealth viruses are boot sector
viruses that hide from antivirus software.
■
The best way to prevent damage from a virus is to
keep from getting a virus in the first place. Use
your passive antivirus shield, scan the PC daily,
know where software has come from before you
load it, and keep your antivirus definitions
updated. Don’t view e-mail messages in a preview
pane, and only download files from sites you know
to be safe.
■
When the inevitable happens and either your
computer or one of your user’s computers is
infected by a computer virus, you need to follow a
process to stop the problem from spreading and
get the computer back up safely into service.
■
First, recognize the symptoms of a computer virus
attack, such as a suddenly very sluggish computer.
Follow up by quarantining the infected computer
to make certain the virus doesn’t spread. Third,
boot the computer in Safe Mode or an alternative
safe boot environment and run your antivirus
software. To finish up, remediate the formerly
infected machine by fixing boot sector problems
and so on, and educate your users so infection
doesn’t happen again.
■
Hardware firewalls protect networks by hiding IP
addresses and blocking TCP/IP ports. Windows XP
and later come with a built-in software firewall
that is accessible from the Control Panel Security
Center applet.

hen a mission-critical computer goes down, regardless of the industry,
people get upset. Workers can’t work, so they feel guilty. Employers
can’t get product out on time, so they feel anxious. Supervisors blame
employees for fouling things up, or at least the employees fear such blame, even
if they did not break the machine.
Into this charged atmosphere comes the tech, ready to fix the computer and
move on to the next challenge. Accomplishing this task, though, requires three
things: First, a good tech must know the broken machine inside and out—how
it’s supposed to work when working properly. Second, the tech has to calm the
workers and supervisors, and get answers to questions to gain relevant
information about the problem. Third, the tech must troubleshoot the problem
and fix the machine.
This chapter starts with an overview of how computers work and then dives
into a section on dealing with customers and how to get them to tell you what
you need to know and smile about it. The chapter wraps up with a proven
troubleshooting methodology to help you figure out the source of problems and
point you to the fix quickly.

■How Computers Work
You’ve spent a lot of time going through this book, reading about technolo-
gies and components in great detail. Each chapter contained troubleshoot-
ing information and methodologies for the components explained in that
chapter. In Chapter 5, “Learning CPUs,” for example, you learned all about
CPUs, from how they work to some of the many different types available.
Knowing a CPU’s features as well as the difference between the available
brands will help you make informed decisions when buying a CPU. In
Chapter 9, “Hard Drive Technologies,” you learned more about hard drives
than you probably ever thought you would. With each chapter, you added
more and more information about the pieces that make up the personal
computer today.
In this chapter, I want you to distill that knowledge, to think about the
computer as a coherent machine. Each of the computer’s components works
together to enable people to produce some amazing things.
To master the art of troubleshooting as a PC tech, you need to approach a
technical problem and answer one question: “What can it be? What can be
causing this problem?” (Okay, that was two questions, but you get the idea.)
Because every process involves multiple components, you must understand
the interconnectedness of those components. If Jane can’t print, for example,
what could it be? Connectivity? Drivers? Paper jam? Slow network connec-
tion? Frozen application? Solar flares? Let’s look at the process.
Way back in Chapter 3, “The Visible PC,” you learned about the
four parts of the computing process: input, processing, output, and
storage. Let’s take a moment to review the computing process, this
time to see how you can use it to help you fix computers.
When you run a program, your computer goes through three of the
four stages of the computing process: input, processing, and output
(Figure 20.1). Input requires specific devices, such as the keyboard and
mouse, that enable you to tell the computer to do something, such as
open a program or type a word. The operating system (OS) provides
an interface and tools so that the microprocessor and other chips can
process your request. The image on the monitor or sound from the
speakers effectively tells you that the computer has interpreted your
command and spit out the result. The fourth stage, storage, comes into
play when you want to save a document and when you first open pro-
grams and other files.

Printing Process
You learned all about the printing process in Chapter 15, “Learning
Printing,” but now think in terms of the computing process. Does the
computing process translate when applied to printers? How? If a user
can’t print, how does knowledge of the computing process help you
troubleshoot the printing process?

Making this process work, though, requires the complex interaction of
many components, including multiple pieces of hardware and layers of
software. As a tech, you need to understand all the components and how
they work together so that when something doesn’t work right, you can
track down the source and fix it. A look at a modern program reveals that
even a seemingly simple action or change on the screen requires many
things to happen within the computer.
Games such as Second Life (Figure 20.2) are huge, taking up multiple
gigabytes of space on an Internet server. They simply won’t fit into the RAM
in most computers, so developers have figured out ways to minimize RAM
usage.
In Second Life, for example, you move through the online world in a se-
ries of more or less seamlessly connected areas. Crossing a bridge from one
island to another triggers the game to quickly update the information you’re
about to see on the new island, so you won’t be out of the action and the illu-
sion of being in the game world remains intact. Here’s what happens when
you press the W key on your keyboard and your character steps across the
invisible zone line.
The keyboard controller reads the grid of your keyboard and, on discov-
ering your input, sends the information to the CPU through the wires of the
motherboard (Figure 20.3). The CPU understands the keyboard controller
because of a small program that was loaded into RAM from the ROM BIOS
on the motherboard when the PC booted up.
The CPU and the application determine what should happen in the
game, and on discovering that your character is about to cross the zone line,
622

Second Life
Second Life is a massively
multiplayer online role-playing
game (MMORPG) that offers a
unique twist on the genre. You
can create just about anything
you can imagine, as far as your
time and talent can take you.
Second Life has a functioning
economy that spills out into the
real world, meaning you can buy
and sell things within the game
and turn that into real U.S. dol-
lars, although the more common
scenario is to spend real money
to get virtual possessions.

they trigger a whole series of actions. The application
sends the signal to the OS that it needs a specific area
loaded into RAM. The OS sends a signal to the CPU that
it needs data stored on the hard drive plus information
stored on the Second Life servers. The CPU then sends
the commands to the hard drive controller for it to grab
the proper stored data and send it to RAM, while at the
same time sending a command to the NIC to download
the updated information (Figure 20.4).

Input Process
You learned about keyboards and many other input
devices in Chapter 12, “Learning Input/Output,” but
now apply the computing process to input devices for
troubleshooting purposes. Obviously, keyboards do
the “input” part of the computing process, but what
can the problem be if you press a key and nothing
happens? What other input devices can you recall
from Chapter 12, “Learning Input/Output”? If they
seem not to work, where in the computing process
could the problem lie?

The hard drive controller tells the hard drive to cough up the data—
megabytes worth—and then sends that data through the motherboard to
the memory controller, which puts it into RAM and communicates with the
CPU when it’s finished. The network card and network operating system
communicate with the Second Life servers and download the necessary up-
dated information. The CPU then uses the application and OS to process the
new data, sending video data to the video card and sound data to the sound
card, again through the wires on the motherboard (Figure 20.5).
The video card processor puts the incoming data into its RAM, processes
the data, and then sends out commands to the monitor to update the screen.
The sound card processor likewise processes the data and sends out com-
mands to the speakers to play a new sound (Figure 20.6).
For all of this to work, the PC has to have electricity, so the direct current
(DC) provided by the power supply and the alternating current (AC) pro-
vided to the power supply must both be the proper voltage and amperage.
Finally, because Second Life is a network application, the OS has to send
information through the NIC and onto the Internet to update everyone

Hard Drive Technologies
You learned about several hard drive technologies way back in Chapter 9,
“Hard Drive Technologies,” so turn there now and see if you can answer
these questions. If an application stumbles or hesitates on the “load from
the hard drive” section of the computing process, what could be the prob-
lem? Which of the available hard drive technologies offers better through-
put? What would you recommend to a client who wanted to upgrade?
Tech Tip
Video Counts
Windows Vista has raised the bar
on video demands in a big way,
so the video card in your users’
systems can make a remarkable
difference in their experience.
Vista uses the video card to pro-
duce many of the cool visual ef-
fects of the interface. This means
that a low-end video card in an
otherwise serviceable machine can
cause Vista to misbehave. Unless
your client is gaming, there’s no
reason to drop $300+ on a video
card, but assembling or recom-
mending a system with yester-
day’s video is not necessarily a
good thing!

else’s computer. That way, the other charac-
ters in the game world see you move forward
a step (Figure 20.7).
What do you see or hear with all these
electrons zipping all over the place? Out of a
seemingly blank vista (Figure 20.8), a castle
begins to appear, building itself piece by piece
as your computer processes the new informa-
tion and updates the video screen. You hear
music begin to play from your speakers.
Within a few seconds, with the data describing
the new island fully downloaded and pro-
cessed, the world on your monitor looks very
different (Figure 20.9). That’s when all goes
well. Many megabytes of data have flowed
from your hard drive and across the Internet,
been processed by multiple processors, and
sent to the monitor and the speakers.
To keep the action continuous and unbro-
ken, Second Life, like many current online
games, uses a process of continuous or stream
loading: your computer constantly down-
loads updated information and data from the
Second Life servers, so the world you see
changes with every step you take. When done right, stream loading can do
some amazing things. In the GameCube game Zelda, for example, the game
anticipates where you will go next and loads that new area into RAM before
you take the step. You can be in one area and use a telescope to zoom in on

and clearly obvious (such as not powering up due to not having a power
cord plugged in), you should use the computing process to help you
zero in on the problem. But the computing process only defines the
pieces and their interaction; good troubleshooting requires more than
just rummaging around to find the problem. You need to combine the
computing process with a troubleshooting theory to get the job done.
■Troubleshooting Theory
Troubleshooting theory is nothing more than a set of mental steps you
use along with the computing process to diagnose and fix a computer.
Troubleshooting theory includes talking to users to determine how and
when the problem took place, determining a cause, testing, verification, and
documentation. Techs use a number of good troubleshooting theories.
Luckily for those taking the CompTIA A+, CompTIA clearly defines their
vision of troubleshooting theory in the 220-701 exam:

Analyze Your Apps
What applications do you use on your computer? What applications do
your clients or potential clients use? Analyzing them in terms of the
computing process can help elevate your troubleshooting game by a
huge factor. Take for example Microsoft Excel, a program designed to
let you take numbers and turn them into charts, among other things.
When you sit down to work in Excel, you load it from the hard drive
into memory and then put information in via the keyboard and format
things with the mouse. Every click requires the CPU to analyze and up-
date RAM and the video card information.

Identify the Problem
There’s a reason you’re standing in front of a com-
puter to repair it: something happened that the user
of the computer has identified as “not good” and
that’s why you’re here. The first step to identifying
any problem is talking to the user. Get the user to
show you what’s not good. Is it an error code? Is
something not accessible? Is a device not respond-
ing? Then ask the user that classic tech question (re-
member your communication skills here!): “Has
anything recently changed on the computer that
might have made this problem appear?” What
you’re really saying is: “Have you jacked with the
computer? Did you install some evil program? Did
you shove in a USB drive so hard you broke the
connection?” Of course, you never say these things,
simply ask nicely without accusing so the user can
help you fix the problem (Figure 20.11).
In most troubleshooting situations, it’s important to back up critical files
before making changes to a system. To some extent, this is a matter of proper
ongoing maintenance, but if some important bit of data disappears and you
don’t have a backup, you know who the user will blame, don’t you?
If you run into a partially functional system where you might have to re-
install the OS but can access the hard drive, you should definitely back up
essential data, such as e-mail, browser favorites, important documents, and
any data not stored on a regularly backed-up server. Because you can boot
to a copy of Windows and go to the Recovery Console, you should never
lose essential data, barring full-blown hard drive death.
Establish a Theory of Probable
Cause (Question the Obvious)
Now it’s time to analyze the issue and come up with a theory as to what is
wrong—a theory of probable cause. Personally, I prefer the word “guess” at
this point because very few errors are so obvious that you’ll know what to
do. Fall back on your knowledge of the computing process to localize the is-
sue based on the symptoms. Keep your guesses…err…theories…simple.
One of the great problems for techs is their tendency to overlook the obvious
problems in their desire to dig into the system (Figure 20.12).
Outside the Case
Take a moment to look for clues before you open up the case. Most impor-
tantly, use all your senses in the process.
What do you see? Is a connector mangled, or a plastic part clearly dam-
aged? Even if that connector or part works fine, the physical abuse could
provide extra information. If the user can’t connect to a network, check the
cable. Was something rolled over it that could have broken the thin, internal
wires? Is that a jelly smear near the jammed optical drive door? (No pun in-
tended, really!) A visual examination of the external computer is important.
628
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 20.11
Tech asking nicely
The CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam assumes that all techs
should back up systems every
time before working on them,
even though that’s not how it
works in the real world.
Dead hard drives retain their
data, so you can recover it—if
you’re willing to pay a lot of
money. Having a good backup
in place makes a lot more eco-
nomic sense!
When taking a service call
over the phone, first ask for the
user’s name and the problem.

When you put your hand on the system unit, does it
feel hot? Can you feel or hear the vibrations of the fans? If
not, that would be a clue to an overheating or overheated
computer. Modern computers can run when overly hot,
but generally run very sluggishly. If you run through ba-
sic malware fixes, but a computer still runs poorly, think
about excessive heat as a potential problem.
If you spend a moment listening to the PC, you might
get some clues to problem sources. As you may have no-
ticed while working with computers, a properly running
hard drive doesn’t make a lot of sound; just a regular
hum from the spinning platters. If you hear clicking or
grinding sounds from a drive, that’s a very bad sign and
a very important clue! Excessive thrashing or disk access
can likewise lead to some potential problem areas, such
as insufficient RAM or a badly fragmented drive.
Finally, don’t forget your nose. If you smell the un-
mistakable odor of ozone, you know that’s the smell elec-
tronic components give off when they cook or are simply
running much too hot.
Inside the Case
Use all your senses when you go inside the system unit
as well. Do you see any physical damage? Check the
motherboard capacitors if you have a dead PC. Properly
working capacitors should be nice and flat on top. They
definitely shouldn’t look like partly melted batteries or
be bulging at the seams. Fans should be spinning. The
power supply shouldn’t be blistering hot. You should be
able to localize sounds better with the case off, and any
smell of cooking components will definitely be stronger.
As you do your inspection, both outside and inside the case, don’t jump
to conclusions too quickly. When you see a problem that looks obvious, stop
and give yourself an “Are you sure?” moment. Consider the possibility that
a problem you’ve seen 50 times before might not be the same thing. Of
course, it probably is the same problem, but that moment of consideration
might save you trouble later.
Okay, so you’ve decided on a theory that makes sense. It’s time to see if
your theory is actually the problem at hand—give it a test to see if it fixes the
problem.
Test the Theory to Determine Cause
The biggest challenge to fixing a computer is that the theory and the fix
pretty much prove themselves at the same time. Let’s go back to the situa-
tion where the power plug isn’t in the wall. You observe that nothing hap-
pens when the PC power button is pressed. You check the back of the power
supply and see that the power cable is plugged in. You then look at the wall
outlet…not plugged in! So you quickly plug it in and tada! It works! You’re a

and can implode if you drop

hero! In this simple case, your theory and your test are done in virtually the
same move (Figure 20.13).
Of course, most problems aren’t that easy. In many cases, testing your
theory does nothing more than verify that something is broken. Let’s say
you install an update for your video driver. You reboot, log in to Windows,
and suddenly the screen freaks out. Ah, a bad video driver, right? So to test,
you reboot the computer and press F8 to get the boot options menu. You se-
lect VGA Mode (2000/XP) or Low Resolution Mode (Vista/7) and reboot.
Now the computer boots up just fine. You know the problem, but how do
you fix it? Roll back the video driver? Reinstall an older driver? Try down-
loading another copy of the new driver and installing the video driver
again? Any of these solutions may be the right one. Choose one and go for it
(Figure 20.14).
Uh oh, your first guess was wrong: the video is still messed up. No wor-
ries, just try another one of your theories. In most cases you’ll just pick an-
other and try again, but sometimes there’s a point where the problem is
bigger than you. It might be a problem on a server that you’re not autho-
rized to configure. It might be a problem with a user account, and techs in
your company aren’t allowed to change user accounts. It might be a

problem with an in-house program and you don’t
have the skills to fix it. In these cases, you must esca-
late the problem.
Escalation is the process your company (or
sometimes just you) goes through when you—the
person assigned to repair a problem—are not able
to get the job done. It’s okay to escalate because no
one can fix every problem. All companies should
have some form of escalation policy. It might mean
calling your boss. It might mean filling out and
sending some in-house form to another depart-
ment. Escalation is sometimes a more casual pro-
cess. You might want to start researching the
problem online; you might want to refer to in-house
documentation to see if this problem has appeared
in the past. (See “Document Findings, Actions, and
Outcomes” later in this chapter.) You may want to
call a coworker to come check it out (Figure 20.15).
Verify and Prevent
Fantastic! Through either your careful work or escalation, you’ve solved the
problem, or so you think. Remember two items here. First, even though you
think it’s fixed, the user/customer might not think it’s fixed. Second, try to
do something to prevent the problem from happening again in the future, if
possible.
Verify Full System Functionality
Verifying
full
system
functionality
is
CompTIA’s way to tell you to make sure the user is happy. Let’s say a user
can’t print. You determine that the printer spool is stalled due to a locked-up
laser printer. You reset the printer and the jobs all start printing. Job done,
right? Well, during your theory testing, you
switched the default printer to another laser printer
on the third floor. The user doesn’t know how to set
the default printer back to the one you just fixed.
The best way to verify full system functionality is
to have the user do whatever she needs to do on the
repaired system for a few minutes while you watch.
Any minor errors (such as incorrect default printers)
will quickly become apparent, and you might learn
some interesting aspects of how the user does her job.
Knowing what your users do is critical for good techs
to help them do their jobs better (Figure 20.16).
If Applicable, Implement Preventive Measures
A very
smart tech once told me, “A truly good support
tech’s work goal should be to never have to get out
of his chair.” That’s a pretty tall order, but it makes
sense to me. Do whatever you can to keep this
problem from repeating. For some problems, there
are obvious actions to take, such as making sure
anti-malware is installed so a computer doesn’t get

infected again. Sometimes there’s no action to take at all: noth-
ing can prevent a hard drive that decides to die. But you can
take one more critical action in almost every case: education.
Take advantage of the time with the user to informally train
him about the problem. Show him the dangers of malware or
tell him that sometimes hard drives just die. The more your us-
ers know, the less time you’ll spend out of your chair.
Document Findings, Actions,
and Outcomes
I think the famous historian George Santayana would have
made a great PC technician when he said, “Those who cannot re-
member the past are condemned to repeat it.” As a tech, the last
step of every troubleshooting job should be documentation. This
documentation might be highly formalized in some organiza-
tions, or it might just be a few notes you jot down for your own
use, but you must document! What was the problem? What did
you do to fix it? What worked? What didn’t? The best guide to
use for documentation is: “What would I have liked to have
known about this problem before I walked up to it?” Good docu-
mentation is the strongest sign of a good PC tech (Figure 20.17).
Documenting problems helps you track the troubleshooting
history of a machine over time, enabling you to make longer-
term determinations about retiring it or changing out more
parts. If you and fellow techs fix a specific problem with Mary’s
machine several times, for example, you might decide to swap out her
whole system rather than fix it a fourth time.
Documenting helps fellow techs if they have to follow up on a task you
didn’t finish or troubleshoot a machine you’ve worked on previously. The re-
verse is also true. If you get a call about Frank’s computer, for example, and
check the records to find other service calls on his computer, you might find
that the fix for a particular problem is already documented. This is especially
true for user-generated problems. Having documentation of what you did
also means you don’t have to rely on your memory when your coworker asks
what you did to fix the weird problem with Jane’s computer a year ago!
Documenting also comes into play when you or a user has an accident
onsite. If your colleague Joe drops a monitor on his foot and breaks both the
monitor and his foot, for example, you need to fill out an incident report, just
as you would with any kind of accident: electrical, chemical, or physical. An
incident report should detail what happened and where it happened. This
helps your supervisors take the appropriate actions quickly and efficiently.
■Tech Toolkit
Way back in Chapter 2, “Operational Procedures,” you learned the basic
parts of a tech toolkit—a Phillips-head screwdriver and a few other useful
tools, such as a Torx wrench and a pair of tweezers. Any good tech makes a
point to carry around at least these tools (Figure 20.18). Over time, you’ll add
632
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
• Figure 20.17
Ford documents a successful fix.

more tools as your experience grows. But your
toolkit won’t stop at Phillips screwdrivers and Torx
wrenches. You should include two other types of
tools in your tech toolkit: utilities and field replace-
able units (FRUs).
Utilities
Windows comes with plenty of handy utilities, but
there are times when you need to use stronger tools
than these. The PC industry has thousands of third-
party utilities that techs might use to diagnose and
repair PCs. Sadly, there is no single selection of
tools I can tell you to get: the tools one experienced tech uses differ from the
tools I use based on experience, skills, and job functions. That doesn’t mean
you haven’t been hearing my opinions! Throughout this book you’ve seen
quite a few third-party utilities, and many of them are on the CD that comes
with your book for you to use right away. Given that you already have my
opinion on so many tools, let’s instead talk about the types of third-party
tools you’ll find in most tech toolkits.
Many techs like to challenge me on the idea of carrying around tools.
They say, “I know what I like; I’ll just download them!” Well, sometimes
you don’t have Internet access and sometimes you need tools ready to go
(see malware cleaners). Granted, there are a number of tools that I would
never carry on me. For example, device drivers change so often that keeping
a copy on disk is a waste of time. The tools I’m listing here are the ones I
promise you want on disk, ready to go when you run into trouble.
Malware Cleaners
Ask any tech who works for Best Buy’s Geek Squad, “What do you spend
the most time doing on jobs?” and they will reply, “Cleaning malware.” The
first tech utilities you want in your toolkit are malware cleaners. To truly do
it right, put your malware cleaners on a bootable optical disc because
malware can sometimes attack a malware cleanup tool as you install. If
you’re not sure what to try first, grab a copy of the Ultimate Boot CD and try
some of their fine cleanup tools.
Anti-Malware
After you clean the machine, make sure you have a copy of an anti-malware
program that you can install so the user’s machine doesn’t get corrupted
again. We talked about some of the popular freeware versions, but plenty of
techs strongly prefer the pay versions and keep copies to sell to their
customers.
Boot Tools
You need a tool that’s better than the System Configuration utility at control-
ling what programs autostart on your Windows PC. OK, in this case, one tool
stands out so strongly that you have to get it: Mark Russinovich’s superb
AUTORUNS. It’s vastly superior to the built-in System Configuration utility

and gives you incredible control of everything that’s autostarting. Sure there
are others, but I love AUTORUNS. Get it at www.sysinternals.com.
Password Clearer
If you lose a Windows password, especially the Administrator password,
and you can’t log on to a system, you’re in trouble. A number of tools let you
reset any user’s passwords. These programs don’t let you see a password,
only reset them, so if you have a user with encrypted folders, those won’t be
recoverable. None of these programs are easy to use, but when the alterna-
tive is not logging in, they will save you. Pretty much all of these programs
run from a boot CD.
ZIP File Tool
Windows can read many compressed file formats (such as ZIP), but so many
others are in use that it’s often a good idea to have your own copy handy.
I like 7-Zip (www.7-zip.org/), but there are plenty of equally popular
alternatives.
Backup
Odds are good that from time to time you’ll need to do a backup for a sys-
tem. I keep an external hard drive with a backup tool so I can go in fast and
make backups of the most critical files.
Don’t Forget Your Thumb Drives!
I guess I’m showing my age when I talk about putting all these tools on CD
media. Sorry, I’m old. Almost all of these tools work equally well on USB
thumb drives. I keep my tools on CD media because I still run into the occa-
sional system that doesn’t have CMOS settings for a bootable thumb drive.
Field Replaceable Units (FRUs)
Always carry several field replaceable units (FRUs)—a fancy way to say spare
parts—when going to a job site or workstation. Having several known good
components on hand enables you to swap out a potentially bad piece of
hardware to see if that’s the problem. Different technicians will have differ-
ent FRUs. A printer specialist might carry a number of fusers, for example.
Your employer will also have a big effect on what is an FRU and what is not.
I generally carry a couple of RAM sticks (DDR, DDR2, and DDR3), a PCI
video card, a NIC, and a spare power supply.
634
Mike Meyers’ CompTIA A+ Guide: Essentials
The CompTIA A+ Essentials
exam expects you to know that
FRUs are computer components
such as cards, memory, hard
drives, processors, or power
supplies that can be easily
replaced in the field.
Tech Tip
Why PCI?
I keep a PCI video card in my kit
because every computer made in
the past ten years has PCI slots. If
you run into a system with video
problems, you can almost always
simply slap in the PCI video card
and discover quickly whether the
AGP or PCIe video card or card
slot is a problem. If the computer
boots up with the PCI video card
but fails on the PCIe card, for ex-
ample, you know that either the
PCIe card or the slot is causing
the problem.

Chapter 20 Review
■Chapter Summary
After reading this chapter and completing the exercises,
you should understand the following about working as
a tech.
Describe how computers work
■
Good techs must know how their systems are
supposed to work when working properly, must
be able to calm workers and supervisors and get
answers to relevant questions, and must be able to
troubleshoot and fix computer problems. A question
you must be able to answer is, “What can be causing
this problem?”
■
When you run a program, computers work through
three stages of the four-stage computing process:
input, processing, and output. Input requires
special input devices such as a keyboard or mouse.
The operating system provides the interface and
tools so the CPU and other chips can process
requests. The output devices, such as the monitor,
speakers, and printer, tell you the computer has
interpreted your commands. For all this to work,
the PC must have electricity and proper AC/DC
voltage and amperage.
■
When you press a keyboard key, the keyboard
controller reads the grid of your keyboard,
discovers your input, and then sends the
information to the CPU. The CPU understands the
keyboard controller because of a small program
that was loaded into RAM from the ROM BIOS on
the motherboard when the PC booted up.
■
Good techs understand the components involved
in inputting, processing, and outputting, including
the devices that store data, such as hard drives.
Implement a troubleshooting methodology
■
The first step in fixing a computer problem is to
identify the problem by talking to the client. To
determine what the computer is doing or not doing,
first allow the client to describe the situation, then
ask leading questions to elicit answers.
■
Most people feel defensive when asked to explain
computer problems, so it is your job to put them
at ease by asking the right kinds of questions.
Questions such as “What did you do?” generally
aren’t much help. A better question might be,
“When did it last work?” By taking the user
explicitly out of the question, you show that
you won’t accuse them or judge their actions.
■
Refrain from using computer jargon, acronyms,
or abbreviations. Users are unlikely to be familiar
with them and may get confused and think you are
talking down to them. Ask simple questions that
don’t use technical lingo. Have the user physically
show you the problem, demonstrating what is
happening or what is not happening.
■
Once you have ascertained the problem the user is
having with the computer, it is important to back
up critical data. Unless the hard drive is dead, you
should have no reason to lose any data that was
accessible before.
■
Once you have secured the user’s data, you need to
establish a theory of probable cause. In other words,
look at the machine and determine why it’s not
working correctly. Don’t overlook the obvious, such
as a disconnected power or network cable. Use all of
your senses: look for damaged components, feel for
excessive heat or lack of vibration, listen for any
unusual or telltale sounds, and sniff the air for the
unmistakable smell of ozone.
■
If you run into something more complex than a
disconnected cord, don’t be afraid to try multiple
solutions. Take a chance and see if it works. If you
have run out of ideas, escalate the problem; no one
person can solve all problems.
■
After you have successfully solved the user’s
problem, have the user sit down and perform the
task. This enables you to verify full system
functionality with the user.
■
Once everything is verified and the customer is
happy, make sure to document your findings
thoroughly. Keeping records is important. If you or
a colleague encounters a similar problem in the
future, the answer will be readily available.
Describe a technician’s toolkit
■
Troubleshooting is more art than science, and as
such, there is no step-by-step list of actions to
follow. You need to be flexible.
Chapter 20: The Complete PC Technician
635

■
A well-stocked tech toolkit consists of a Phillips-head
screwdriver, flat-head screwdriver, Torx wrench, nut
driver, tweezers, grabber tool, flashlight, magnifying
glass, and anti-static wrist strap. You should also
carry several FRUs. The FRUs you carry will depend
on what kind of tech you are, but the FRUs most
techs should carry include a few sticks each of DDR,
DDR2, and DDR3 RAM, PCI video card, NIC, and
power supply.
■
Malware is the most common source of consumer
computer problems today. Make sure your kit is
well stocked with antivirus and other (preferably
boot-time) malware removers.
■
Lost logon passwords are a common problem, so
your kit should include some form of password
clearing utility. Remember, these just clear the
existing password; they do not show it to you.
■
Other handy tools to have are zip/archive
extractors and backup utilities. Having these and
the rest of your kit and a handy bootable thumb
drive can make your job much easer onsite.

ike Meyers has put together a bunch of resources that will help you prepare for the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam
and that you will find invaluable in your career as a PC Tech. The CD-ROM included with this book comes
complete with a sample version of the Total Tester practice exam software with one full practice exam, all the Chapter
Review questions from the book, a searchable electronic copy of the book, a document from CompTIA with a list of
acronyms that you should know for the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam, a complete list of the objectives for the CompTIA
A+ Essentials exam, a copy of several freeware and shareware programs that Mike talks about in the book, and a sample
of LearnKey’s online training featuring Mike Meyers. The practice test and video software are easy to install on any
Windows 98/NT/2000/XP/Vista/7 computer, and must be installed to access the Total Tester practice exam and LearnKey
video sample. The eBook and CompTIA A+ acronyms and objectives lists are Adobe Acrobat files. If you don’t have
Adobe Acrobat Reader, it is available for installation on the CD-ROM.
■System Requirements
The software on the CD-ROM requires Windows 98 or higher, Internet Explorer 5.0 or above, and 50 MB of hard disk
space for full installation. To access the online training from LearnKey, you must have Windows Media Player 9,
which will be automatically installed when you launch the online training.
■Installing and Running Total Tester
If your computer’s CD-ROM drive is configured to Autorun, the CD-ROM will automatically start upon inserting
the disk. If the Autorun feature does not launch the CD’s splash screen, browse to the CD-ROM and double-click
the Launch.exe icon.
From the splash screen, you may install Total Tester by clicking the Install A+ Practice Exams button. This will
begin the installation process, create a program group named Total Seminars, and put an icon on your desktop. To
run Total Tester, go to Start | Programs | Total Seminars or just double-click the icon on your desktop.
To uninstall the Total Tester software, go to Start | Settings | Control Panel | Add/Remove Programs and select
the A+ Total Tester program. Select Remove, and Windows will completely uninstall the software.
About Total Tester
The best way to prepare for the CompTIA A+ Essentials exam is to read the book and then test your knowledge and
review. We have included a sample of Total Seminars’ practice exam software to help you test your knowledge as
you study. Total Tester provides you with a simulation of the actual exam. There is a suite called A+ 701 split that
contains a sample 701 exam that can be taken in either practice or final mode. Practice mode provides an assistance
window with hints, references to the book, an explanation of the answer, and the ability to check your answer as

you take the test. Both practice and final modes provide an overall grade
and a grade broken down by certification objective. There is also a suite
called A+ 701 review. This suite has five exams. Each exam covers Chapter
Review question from four chapters. To launch a test, select Suites from the
menu at the top, then select an exam. Additional practice exams are
available for both of the CompTIA A+
exams. Visit our Web site at
www.totalsem.com or call 800-446-6004 for more information.
■Accessing the eBook, CompTIA A+
Acronyms, and CompTIA A+ Exam
Objectives Lists
You will find these documents useful in your preparation for the exam. To
access these PDF documents, first be sure you have a copy of Adobe Acrobat
Reader installed. If you don’t have Acrobat Reader installed on your system,
you can install it from the CD-ROM by clicking the Install Adobe Acrobat
Reader button. Once you have installed Acrobat Reader, simply select the
document you want to view from the CD-ROM’s splash screen to open and
view the document.

programs that are mentioned in this book. The CD-ROM includes a list with
short descriptions of the programs. To use these programs, select the Share-
ware and Freeware option on the CD-ROM splash screen. The next menu
lists each program. Select a program and follow the installation instructions
to load the utility on your system.

Layer 2 The Data Link layer
Identifies devices on the
Physical layer. MAC addresses are part of the Data
Link layer. Bridges operate at the Data Link layer.
Layer 3 The Network layer
Moves packets between
computers on different networks. Routers operate at the
Network layer. IP and IPX operate at the Network layer.
Layer 4 The Transport layer
Breaks data down into
manageable chunks. TCP, UDP, SPX, and NetBEUI op-
erate at the Transport layer.
Layer 5 The Session layer
Manages connections be-
tween machines. NetBIOS and Sockets operate at the
Session layer.
Layer 6 The Presentation layer
Can also manage
data encryption; hides the differences between various
types of computer systems.
Layer 7 The Application layer
Provides tools for
programs to use to access the network (and the lower
layers). HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and POP3 are all examples
