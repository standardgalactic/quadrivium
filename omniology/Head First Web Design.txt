Paper covers rock
Wow, you really can erase 
things when you use a pencil 
instead of a text editor. Who 
would have thought?!
Tired of butting heads with a picky client? Yeah, you know the type... 
every time you show them their latest crazy design idea, they've already moved on to 
another look... another color scheme... another entire web site. So how do you deal 
with fickle clients or those tricky hard-to-get-right websites? You start with paper, 
pencil, and a big fat pink eraser. In this chapter, you'll learn how to work smart before 
you dig into your HTML editor. Coming up with a theme and visual metaphor for your 
site, mocking up sketches in pencil, and using storyboards will turn you into a nimble, 
flexible web designer. So get out your sketchpad, and let's pre-produce!

Mark’s Trip to Japan
Mark loves to travel. After college, he took a year off to backpack around 
Japan and experience everything the island nation had to offer–from 
sushi to samurai. Now that he’s back, he wants to document his 
experience with a great looking website.

Since Mark has so much content, 
we can’t just dive into the project 
and start laying down code willy 
nilly. We need to know exactly 
what we are designing first. In 
pre-production, we plan things 
out before we go digital. A 
little detour now will save 
us a lot of time when 
we start putting together 
Mark's site later.
But where to start? How about 
at the very beginning–with the 
site’s design vibe. A visual 
metaphor, if you will.

4    Chapter 2
visual metaphors
Think before you code
Pre-production is all about getting things right before you put down 
one line of XHTML. Its all about getting your site’s design right 
on paper so that when you get to the point where you go to code, 
you know exactly what you are building, and you can be incredibly 
focused and efficient during development. Its also all about making 
sure that you work out any potential design problems before you 
invest a ton of time writing line after line of XHTML and CSS, only 
to find that you need to scrap everything and start again because 
your design has a critical problem.
Thinking about a visual metaphor
Jobs on the Wall just needs to be a 
simple job posting site. One main column 
is all you need with some ancillary 
(helper) information in the sidebar.
Visual metaphors start with a layout 
and color scheme that reinforces 
the content and topic of your site.
The finished site reinforces the “job 
posting board” metaphor complete 
with cork board texture and Post-
It note navigation.

pre production
A clear visual metaphor helps reinforce 
your site’s theme
A visual metaphor takes advantage of familiar visual elements (such as 
images, interface elements, icons, colors, or fonts) to reinforce the site’s 
theme. Say, for example, you are creating a children’s online community site 
geared towards ages 7 to 10. You might think about using bright and bold 
primary colors with cartoony interface elements and fonts. These design 
elements reinforce the subject matter of the site: kid oriented, fun, etc.
A visual metaphor can range from subtle (using colors that give the user an 
abstract feeling that the designer wants to associate with the site’s theme) to 
direct (using graphics that tie right into the site’s name or identity–like using 
graphics of rocket ships for a site called Rocket Ship Designs).
Hold on a second. What 
the heck is the difference 
between a site’s theme and a 
site’s visual metaphor?
Bright bold colors and an arctic 
theme help set the visual metaphor 
for this site.
Cartoon penguins 
and comic-book 
style typography 
are definitely 
geared toward a 
younger audience.

6    Chapter 2
site themes
A theme represents your site’s content
The word theme is used to refer to all kinds of different things in the world of 
web design-–which can be kind of confusing. In this case, a theme is your site’s 
purpose and/or content. So, the theme of amazon.com is an online merchant 
that focuses mostly on books. The visual metaphor uses design elements (color, 
graphics, typography, etc.) that reinforce the site’s theme.
IconBuffet creates and sells icons 
for use in web design and other 
interface development. Icons are 
featured throughout and a takeout 
container is used to reinforce the 
site’s name.
Silverback is an application for 
performing user testing on websites. 
Because a Silverback is also a type 
of animal, the jungle and gorilla 
theme is used throughout.
IconBuffet’s visual metaphor is 
subtle–but the design reinforces 
the clean, simple icons they produce, 
and their logo is great literal 
interpretation of the site’s name.
Unlike IconBuffet, Silverback’s visual 
metaphor is more apparent. They 
make the page look like a gorilla’s 
surroundings, complete with jungle 
color scheme, leaves at the top of 
the page and an amazing logo/icon 
of a gorilla with a clipboard. Hence, 
“Gorilla Usability Testing.”

a site’s theme is its content/purpose, while the visual metaphors 
are the design elements that are used to reinforce the theme.

Identifying themes and visual metaphors
Take a look  at the screenshots below. Write down the site’s 
theme and circle (yes, draw in the book) some of the design 
elements that are used in the site’s visual metaphor. Remember, 
a site’s theme is its content/purpose, while the visual metaphors 
are the design elements that are used to reinforce the theme.
Serious Eats is a food website and 
blog. The logo and bite marks on the 
navigation tabs help reinforce the 
food theme throughout the page.
The Morning News is a news-based 
web magazine. Its multi-column, 
newspaper-style layout and simple 
design reinforce the news theme.
Bite marks used throughout 
the page remind you that 
this is a site about food.
The colors are bright and 
“appetizing.” Green, orange, 
red, peach–colors you’d want 
to eat.
A multi-column layout similar to that 
of a news paper. Also, the columns are 
staggered, with some spanning the width 
of two, others just one.
Generous use of 
whitespace and a 
grid-based layout 
also help reinforce 
the newspaper 
theme.

Do a quick brainstorm for Mark’s site and write down any design, 
content or visual element ideas you come up with. Remember, 
write down everything–you can filter out bad ideas later.

Brainstorming: The path to a visual metaphor
Developing a visual metaphor is all about brainstorming–spending 
some time really thinking about your content, audience, and what 
visual elements you want to see on the page. There is no right or 
wrong way to do a brainstorm, just remember one thing: don’t 
discredit any idea or concept until after you are done 
brainstorming. Once you have all your ideas down, you can go 
back through later and eliminate any that obviously won’t work.
Write down 
everything that 
comes to your mind. 
Don’t judge an idea 
until the end.
The brainstorm list can 
include design ideas, content 
considerations, site sections and 
even color and imagery.

10    Chapter 2
from brainstorms to visual metaphors
A visual metaphor leverages 
familiar visual elements 
(colors, fonts, icons, etc) to 
help reinforce a site’s theme.
Develop a theme and visual metaphor for a project
Coming up with a theme and a visual metaphor can be tricky. Once you 
know what content you have to work with and have a few brainstorms 
under your belt, you need to start thinking about the best way to convey and 
display that content to the user. Color, layout, and element placement are all 
important factors when deciding the best way to reinforce a site’s theme.
Chose some color palettes
1
Design layouts based on content
2
Use visual elements to reinforce 
the theme
2
The use of imagery, iconography and text 
can help reinforce the site’s theme by 
making the site “look like the content.”
Pick colors that work well with 
the content and support the 
theme of the site. Use services like 
http://kuler.adobe.com to build 
palettes and see how different 
colors will work together.
Make layout decisions based on content. 
The more columns you have, the more 
space you have to fill. Also remember 
that whitespace is important. You don’t 
have to fill every available pixel.
This is where your brainstorm will help 
the most. Use that list to decide what 
should go where and what ideas won’t 
make the cut.

It’s ok if you came up with 
something different. We’re just 
trying to get you to think!
We want to emphasize the trip Mark took. 
This could also turn out to be a great 
resource for others planning a trip or 
traveling to Japan.
Mark took great pictures. We 
need to show them off!
Japan’s geography is very 
unique.
Simplicity is key. A few main 
nav items is all we need.
Again, simplicity. We really

Page elements can shape your visual metaphor
Once you have a general site theme and have started 
to think about what you want on your site, you need 
to consider where all that content is going to go. 
How you layout your site will affect the overall visual 
metaphor by dictating what can and can’t appear on 
a given page. For example, if you only have a single 
column, it may be difficult to make your site “feel” 
like a newspaper or magazine. But add a few more 
columns and you can make that page mimic the grid-
like, multi-column layouts of your typical daily paper.
Links to main 
sections of site.
Links to content 
within main sections.
Used for links 
and ancillary 
content.
This is where 
the meat of 
the page goes 
and is what 
visitors come to 
find.
A great place for 
copyright info 
and links. Recently, 
footers have been 
used for content like 
images. Twitter feeds 
markup validation.
Used to separate 
elements and 
draw the eye to 
key parts of the 
page. Whitespace is 
often overlooked. 
It can both help 
and hurt a design.

page elements
Sub Navigation displays 
content that lies under a main 
navigational item. This is usually 
only needed for larger sites and 
more complex content.
Body content is where 
all the magic happens. This 
is where you put the stuff 
people are coming to see. 
Whether it’s images, a blog 
post, or a YouTube movie, all 
that stuff goes in the body.
Navigation is essential 
for users to get around your site. 
Design, placement ,and contents of 
this element will help convey your site’s 
theme in different ways.
Whitespace (which is also called 
negative space) is the area between 
all the different design elements on your 
page. Whitespace helps to breaks up blocks 
of content (which contributes to contrast - 
something that we’ll talk about a little later 
in the book), gives the user’s eye a little rest, 
and focuses the users eye towards content.

you are here 4    15
pre production
The footer portion of 
your layout can hold anything from 
copyright information to duplicate 
navigation links. Users will often look 
to this section for links or content 
that can’t be located anywhere else on 
the site.
Sidebars can hold everything 
from link lists to extra body 
content. They can also be useful 
for ancillary navigation and archive 
links for blogs.
Q: Do I need to use all these for every site?
A: Nope, these are just examples of the general page elements you might end 
up using. Remember, each website is different. In all cases, your content (and your 
theme) will determine what page elements you end up using in your final layout. In fact, 
if you try to use all of these page elements, you are going to end up with a design that 
doesn’t make any sense to you (or to your users).
Q: Does every site need a theme and visual metaphor?
A: The answer is yes and no. Not every site needs a gorilla-themed metaphor or a 
snazzy newspaper layout to reinforce it’s content. But in most circumstances, your site 
is going to have some sort of theme, even if it is only expressed through the content 
and writing on the site. Remember, content is a design element and can be used just 
like whitespace and sidebars.
Q: What if I don’t start with any content? Or I want to just start a blog.
A: Even if you don’t have any content (images, articles, videos, etc.) initially, you 
still need to make a conscious decision about the overall theme of the site. If you’re 
starting a blog, what kind of topics are you going to write about? If it’s more of a journal, 
well then there’s your theme. All websites have a theme, even if it’s just about you.
Now we can get back to Mark's 
site. Which visual metaphor will 
work best for his 
Japan theme? Let's 
take a look at the 
color and layout 
choices...

combinations and see how they will work with our content. Check out the following layout and 
color mockups and write down your thoughts on how well each of them represent Mark’s content.

combinations and see how they will work with our content. Check out the following layout and 
color mockups and write down your thoughts on how well each of them represent Mark’s content. 
Remember to think about the themes and visual elements you identified in the previous exercise.
These colors don’t really seem 
to fit the theme of a Japanese 
travel site. The light pastels just 
don’t work.
Although single column sites are 
simple, this isn’t enough space to 
highlight all the content that 
Mark has brought back from his 
trip.
The two column layout should give 
us enough room, but this color 
pattern still isn’t working. The 
earth tones are nice, but a little 
dark for the theme. Japan is an 
island–shouldn’t we see some blue 
in there?

you are here 4    19
pre production
The blue works well with the theme. 
The other colors are more neutral 
and will allow us to be creative when 
placing visual elements.
Three columns should work well for 
Mark. Not only is this an interesting 
look, it will allow him to present lots of 
information to the user.
This layout/color combination gives 
us all the room we need to display 
Mark’s content along with a simple 
color palette that emphasizes 
blue–representing the Japan as an 
island nation.
A large map of Japan would look really 
good in the header. When a visitor comes 
to the site, there would be no doubt as 
to the theme and content of the page.

And the CSS...
A CSS comment
All these elements 
share the same rules.
Remove the bullets from the 
unordered list.
“margin: 0 auto” centers the whole site in the browser.
Both column <div>s and 
the sidebar use the “float: 
left” declaration to create a 
three-column look.
Make sure the footer displays 
below the columns.

Hmmmmm...I don’t know if I like the

detail. I really can’t tell where you guys 
are going for here...
The end result when you join

What? We spent 
all that time, and he

24    Chapter 2
saving time with storyboards
Joe: Is there anyway we can reuse some of the work we have 
already done?
Frank: I guess we could use some of the XHTML, but any 
new details are going to have to be done in CSS–and that 
won’t be quick.
Joe: What about Photoshop? We could build the sites there 
and show him PDF versions of the designs. If he likes them, 
we already have a leg up on the visuals and imagery needed 
for the final sites.
Jim: Yeah, that could work–but it’s still time-consuming and 
what if he doesn’t like any of them? We’re back to where 
we started. By the time we finish a handful of comps in 
Photoshop, we could have done them in XHTML and CSS. 
We need something we can get to Mark fast! 
Frank: What if we just draw them on paper? We can sketch 
them on paper, add a little color, and send them to Mark to 
get his approval. If he doesn’t like them, we can draw some 
more and will have wasted no time at all.
Jim: That’s not a bad idea and because they're on paper, 
Mark could draw on them too, giving us a better idea of what 
he’s looking for.
Joe: You know, this could work. Because we’ll save time by 
not building sites that could just get shot down–we could 
deliver two or three different designs on paper and give Mark 
some nice choices.
Frank: Well it can’t hurt to try. I don’t want to waste 
anymore time building XHTML and CSS if we don’t have to.
Jim: The drawings don’t have to be really detailed. They just 
have to give Mark an idea of what the finished site is going 
to look like. I also don’t think he’s going to pitch a fit if we do 
something that will save time (and his money).

Ok, it’s clear that Mark isn’t really 
happy with our design, and we have to come 
up with something different. The problem 
is that I don’t want to spend all this time 
producing more XHTML and CSS.

pre production
Use storyboards to develop ideas and 
save time without code
One of the most important things in pre-production is the storyboard 
(sometimes called concept art). Storyboards are used to visualize your design in 
its entirety. They give you a chance to see how colors interact with one another, 
how interface elements play off one another, how your navigational system 
looks, how your visual metaphor plays out, and whether content is represented 
in the best way possible.
Storyboards give you a painless way of catching any potential design problems 
before you get to the stage where you build your design in XHTML and they 
become major obstacles. Storyboards are also a great way to play with design 
ideas and visually brainstorm.
Don’t be afraid to write on your 
boards. Marking them up is one 
of the advantages of testing 
designs on paper.
The storyboards aren’t an exact 
version of the final site, but they 
are where many of the main design 
elements are considered.
You may even want to create your 
storyboards in a photocopy of an empty 
browser window. This is a great way to 
give your client the necessary context.

26    Chapter 2
you’re not designing for yourself
Don’t design for yourself!
Remember, when you are designing for a client, it isn’t 
about you—it's about the clients needs. And taking the 
client’s needs into account obviously starts as early as 
storyboarding. Getting your client involved in the design 
process could be as simple as sitting down for a meeting, 
having them fill out a design survey or sending them 
early storyboard designs throughout the pre-production 
process. Not only will this allow you to build designs 
that your clients really like, they will be appreciate being 
involved in the process.
Okay, even if we used storyboards, 
we’d still have gotten it wrong. 
How can we come up with a design 
Mark likes?

pre production
Somewhere I’d like to 
see a map of Japan. The 
geography is so cool, and I 
think it needs to be on the 
site somewhere.
Mark’s design thoughts
Its time to go back to the drawing board with Mark’s design. 
However, this time we’re going to do things right. We’re 
going to go straight to the source (Mark) and find out exactly 
what he wants to see in his site’s layout and design.
I want to see as 
much of my content 
as possible in the final 
design.
I have lots of 
images. I think one 
would look good as the 
main header image.
I’d really like a simple, 
two-column layout, like 
a lot of these blogs

creating a storyboard
Creating a storyboard
Creating storyboards is pretty straightforward, and everyone has 
their own methods for creating designs on paper. However, there 
are a few things to consider when putting together your boards. 
Here are some tips for getting started:
Find some paper and make your grid
Grab a piece of paper (8.5 x 11 is perfectly fine) 
and sketch out or fold the paper to create a grid. 
You might even want to use a piece of graph paper, 
which has the grid built right in. Why a grid? Well, 
grid’s are amazingly important to the design process. 
A grid (which we’ll talk about a lot more later in the 
book) provides a way to line up elements when you 
are creating your storyboard.  Grids also provide a 
foundation that allow you to layout your site with 
solid order and visual logic.
1
You can use a printed 
blank browser to see how 
the site would look with 
window chrome.
Sketch out your design
Here is where the rubber hits the road. 
Draw out your site’s interface in as much 
or as little detail as your project needs. All 
of the site’s text can be replaced 
by lines or a box with the words 
“text appears here.” The point of 
the storyboard is not to see the 
actual content–it's to play with and 
finalize the layout.

Add color and finalize your storyboard
Its important that you add color to your storyboards—really important. So break 
out your pencil crayons and add color to your storyboard. Yes, we know, the colors 
you use in your storyboards are not going to be exactly what will appear in the 
final (digital) design. However, they will be close enough to see how colors play off 
of one another and make any changes if necessary.  When you are finished with 
the colors, tie up any loose ends you have–and Voila! One supremely awesome 
storyboard!
3
Here is what the 
storyboard looks like 
with browser chrome.
Sketch out two storyboards for Mark. Make sure that each meet his needs but are different 
enough to give him a choice.
This is the point in the process where you need to show the 
client your work. Give them two, maybe three, options and 
let tell them to give you as much feedback as possible (even 
drawing on them if need be).

30    Chapter 2
the final storyboard
This is great! I like 
the simple layout, and the 
map of Japan in the header 
is perfect. Can’t wait to see 
the finished design.
We put this storyboard in a 
browser, so Mark could get an 
idea of how the finished site 
would look on screen.
The design Mark 
didn’t like
Q: Can I use Photoshop or another 
image editing program to do my 
storyboards?
A: You can create your storyboards 
any way you want. The whole idea is 
to mock-up design ideas as quickly as 
possible. Photoshop will inevitably give 
you more control and detail but might take 
you longer to do. However, having digital 
versions of your designs, whether you 
create them in a program or scan your 
sketches into the computer, will allow you 
to quickly email ideas to your client for 
review. In the end, do what you’re most 
comfortable and efficient with.
Q: Why can’t I add text to my 
storyboards?
A: Text (content) is not important 
during the storyboarding stage. Your main 
focus should be on large layout elements 
and possibly color schemes. Copy (text) 
will come later after you design your 
navigation and information architecture. 
For now, just put dummy text–sometimes 
called Lorem Ipsum text–or thick lines that 
represent text. 
 
 
 
Q: What is the best way to add 
color?
A: If you're hand-drawing your boards, 
colored pencils work the best. They are 
cleaner and more detailed than markers 
and won’t bleed through your paper. If 
Photoshop is more your style, then the sky 
is the limit.


visual elements (images, icons,

Inaccessibility Kills
Who’s missing out on experiencing your website, right now? 
You may have a beautiful, well-laid out, easily navigable site... but that doesn’t mean 
everyone’s enjoying it. Whether it’s someone who’s visually-impaired, or just a user who 
has trouble distinguishing blues from greens, your site must be accessible. Otherwise, 
you’re losing users and hurting your business. But don’t worry: accessibility isn’t 
difficult! By planning the order of your markup, using ALT attributes and LONGDESC 
tags, and thinking about color, you’ll widen your audience immediately. Along the way, 
you may even get WCAG certified. What’s that? Turn the page, and find out...

276    Chapter 8
introducing audio-2-go
Audio-2-Go: inaccessible accessibility
Audio-2-Go is a site that sells audio books for the blind and visually 
impaired. But the owner’s got a problem: his site doesn’t work for 
those who can’t see! It turns out that the firm who did his site didn’t 
know anything about accessibility, and now he’s losing customers 
faster than you can say, “But I can’t see what your site looks like!”
It’s up to you to take Audio-2-Go to its audience: those who depend 
on accessibility every day.
These books 
are available in 
audio form for 
the visually 
impaired.
Do you see this site in full color, 
at high-resolution? Then you’re 
probably not in Audio-2-Go’s 
core audience!

accessibility
Accessibility means making your 
site work for EVERYONE
So, what exactly is accessibility? When a website can’t be used by 
someone with a disability, the site’s inaccessible. When your site can 
be used by someone with a disability, then your site is accessible. 
So, basically, accessibility is both the process and the techniques 
used to create a site that can be used by someone with a disability. 
Web accessibility usually deals with visual, auditory, physical, speech, 
cognitive, and neurological disabilities. And, on the Web, accessibility 
also includes designing for older individuals whose abilities are 
changing due to age.
Accessibility is 
thinking about how 
DISABILITIES 
affect how people 
experience and enjoy 
YOUR website.
It sure seems like 
nobody considered 
I’d be using a screen 
reader for this site...
This site is a real pain 
to use without a mouse. 
Nobody thought about 
my disability...
Poor motor skills in 
his hands
Legally blind
Both these 
users are having 
problems using the 
Audio-2-Go site.

278    Chapter 8
understanding screen readers
How does your site READ?
When you think about disabilities, one of the first things you probably think 
about is the visually impaired or the blind. Those disabilities have a huge effect 
on how your site is perceived. All your visuals become more or less irrelevant... 
in how they look, but not in how they sound.
The majority of people who are blind use a screen reader to browse the web. 
A screen reader is a piece of software that reads the text of a website out loud. 
While there are quite a few screen readers on the market, the most popular 
is JAWS (http://www.freedomscientific.com/jaws-hq.asp), a Windows-only 
product. Mac users often use VoiceOver, a screen reader built right into the Mac 
OS X operating system (http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/voiceover/).
Regardless of the product, a screen reader literally reads your page out loud:
Link: Google Search 
book cover dot jpeg...
Heading level 2: 
Listen. All of our 
books are narrated by 
the author...
Link: a2g header 
logo dot jpeg...
A screen reader reads text 
on a webpage based on the 
HTML markup.
Links and 
images are 
read as image 
names... not 
so great for 
the disabled.
Screen readers 
tell you what 
the heading 
level is before it 
reads the text.

you are here 4    279
accessibility
You can’t begin to understand accessibility until you experience a website as someone who is 
blind or visually impaired does. Open up JAWS (they’ve got a great free demo) if you are on 
a Windows machine, or VoiceOver if you are on a Mac, and turn your screen reader loose on 
your favorite website. Oh... and before you start the reader, make sure you close your eyes. 
Now that you’ve got a bit of an idea about how the blind and visually impaired experience the 
web, its time to see how Audio-2-Go’s website measures up. Open up your screen reader and 
turn it loose on the Audio-2-Go website (http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfwd/audio2go/). 
Write down three things you learned about the site, and then what you think the overall site is 
about... based just on what you heard from the screen reader.

280    Chapter 8
computers are stupid
A site’s message should be clear...to EVERYONE
Audio-2-Go’s message isn’t so clear verbally, is it? The whole point of a website is 
to communicate something to your audience. That means your job is to make sure 
your content is just as clear to someone using a screen reader as it is to a sighted 
user. But when you “listen” to Audio-2-Go, a lot’s lost in translation.
Here’s what a few visually impaired users thought about the Audio-2-Go site:
My reader started listing 
what sounded like image 
names, or maybe filenames. 
Aren’t there any books on 
this site?
I had no idea where I was. 
I never even heard the 
name of the page... just 
some text and a bunch of 
weird sounding names.
I heard a bunch of book names, and 
then some information about signing up. 
That was confusing... shouldn’t I hear 
that introduction text before hearing a 
bunch of book names?
Without your 
help, a screen 
reader will read 
image names, 
which is pretty 
confusing.
Titles, headings, 
and descriptions 
are vital for 
screen readers.
The order of your markup matters 
a LOT to screen readers... and 
can have a big effect on confusing 
visually impaired visitors.

you are here 4    281
accessibility
Face it: computers are stupid!
If you want to get a handle on screen readers, and accessibility in general, you 
have to accept that computers are stupid! A computer, or a piece of software, 
can’t figure out that your image really represents a book, and that humans want 
to know the title of that book. So even though your page displays a book, and an 
image that looks like a book, that’s not what a computer sees.
DCS1243.jpg...
Awww... It’s a cute 
orange kitten with 
big eyes.
A human can look at a 
picture and describe 
what they see in clear 
descriptive terms.
Without any other information, 
all a computer sees is a filename 
and an extension.
How can you tell the computer what your image really is, 
in a way you think a screen reader might understand?

282    Chapter 8
alt attributes
A computer will read your image’s ALT text
So, what happens when a screen reader comes upon an image? Most of the time 
it simply reads the file name...which is absolutely no good to someone who is blind 
or visually impaired. Fortunately, img element’s have an attribute that lets you 
provide your own description: the alt attribute. If a screen reader sees an image 
with an alt attribute, the reader reads the value of the alt attribute instead of the 
image name. Perfect, right?
Well, only if your alt text is any good.
Fortunately, good alt text is pretty easy to create. You want a short, descriptive, 
clear phrase. In other words, just succinctly describe the image:
<img alt=”cute orange kitten” src="romulus.jpg" />
Awww... It’s a cute 
orange kitten with big 
eyes.
cute orange kitten
A human still sees 
the image of a cute 
orange kitten.
The alt attribute goes 
inside the <img> tag 
and is used for short 
descriptions. alt is also 
required on all <img> 
tags in order to pass 
XHTML validation.
The computer (and screen 
reader) now see the alt 
text and read that instead 
of the filename.

Create an <img> tag based on the information for each image and the alt text that was

Download the code for the Audio 2 Go site from the Head First Labs website. Open up 
index.html in your text editor and add the ALT tags from the last page. Then, fire up your 
screen reader and check out the Audio-2-Go site again. Any better?

accessibility
I thought alt text was supposed to be short. Isn’t that 
description of the Google Story book a bit long? It’s gonna 
take like 10 minutes just to read the home page. Just 
‘cause people are visually-disabled, doesn’t mean they’ve 
got hours to sit around listening, right?
EVERYONE’s time is valuable.
Nobody wants to see or hear a page that’s filled with 
text that’s not relevant. Lengthy alt values are going 
to bog down your page and give information that’s 
not really needed. What we need is a way to provide 
additional information about an element, but let a 
viewer or listener choose whether they want to access 
that additional information.
The longdesc attribute lets you do just that. 
longdesc gives screen readers an option to go to 
additional information about an element... like a 
longer description (longdesc... makes sense, right?):
<img alt="cute orange kitten" 
     longdesc="romulus.html" src="romulus.jpg" />
longdesc indicates a page that has more detail... lots of 
cloying details about that cute orange kitten are available, 
but only if a user wants that information.
A short alt text gives a concise 
description of an image.
cute orange kitten
Would you like 
more information?
Most screen readers let you choose to hear 
the longdesc page of information.

286    Chapter 8
adding longdesc to XHTML
Convert your long ALT text to a LONGDESC
Add a LONGDESC attribute to the 
Google book image tag.
1
Create an HTML file called googlestory.html 
and add a longer description.
2
<img alt=”The Google Story” longdesc=”googlestory.html” 
     src="googlestory.jpg" />
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" 
	
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"> 
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"  
      xml:lang="en" lang="en"> 
<head> 
  <title>The Google Story</title> 
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"  
        content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/> 
</head> 
<body> 
  <p>The Google Story: An inside look into one of the 
     World's greatest technology startups.</p> 
</body> 
</html>
Make sure you properly mark up 
your content. Remember, this is 
still and HTML file... Let’s keep 
things valid!.
Add your long description 
between the paragraph tags. 
You could even add more 
content from the book’s 
back cover if you wanted to.
Let’s convert the too-long alt text for the Google book to a longdesc... 
complete with a separate XHTML page. Here’s what you should do:
Now the alt text is 
short and to the point.
longdesc is added and 
points to a page with 
more information.
The file you reference in longdesc 
should be normal XHTML.
A longdesc page looks pretty 
bland... but these are meant to 
be read more than seen.

you are here 4    287
accessibility
Q: Does the page with the full text 
description need to have the same design 
as the site?
A: Nope. Description pages will only be 
viewed by users with screen readers. So all 
you need is (semantically correct) marked up 
text. No CSS required.
Q: Will sighted users see the 
LONGDESC link?
A: longdesc is only “visible” for 
people using screen readers. Sighted users 
won’t even know it’s there unless they view 
the source code for your page.
Q: Does longdesc work with all screen 
readers?
A: Unfortunately, longdesc is only 
recognized by newer screen readers. Older 
screen readers didn’t have the feature built 
into them. Thankfully, current versions of 
JAWS, by far the most popular screen reader, 
support longdesc.
Test Drive
Give Audio-2-Go another screen-reading try
Add the longdesc attribute to the image for The Google Story and create the 
corresponding XHTML file to hold the actual description. Save your files and give 
Audio-2-Go’s main page one more run through with a screen reader.
Now your reader lets you 
check more out about the 
book, without forcing you to 
listen to a long description if 
you don’t want to.

Tabbing through a page should be ORDERLY
Whether you’re sighted or not, the Tab key should take you through a web 
page in the same order that your eyes would. That means, generally, the tab 
order should flow top-to-bottom, left-to-right. That’s the way most sites are 
laid out, and the way we process sites visually.
For Audio-2-Go, then, we need to make sure the left-side text (Sign Up, 
Download, and Listen) comes before the book offerings. That gives users 
more context and tracks with what they might be seeing visually. All we 
need ToDo to fix this problem, though, is add a tabindex attribute to our 
elements and explicitly order our elements:
The books are items in a list. So 
for each book link, we provide a 
tabindex attribute.
These books will come after any 
elements with a lower tabindex 
and before any elements with a 
higher tabindex.
All of the Audio-2-Go site needs a tabindex overhaul. Open up index.html, and give a 
tabindex to all the elements that you feel need one. Keep trying out your page using just 
your keyboard until you’re sure you’ve got the page just right.

elements in the order they are detailed in 
your XHTML, regardless of your CSS style.
Q: So why not just put things in my 
XHTML in the order they’ll appear on the 
online page?
A: That’s not a bad idea... in fact, we’ll 
talk about that a little later. Although with 
CSS making it easy to change display order, 
tabindexes still aren’t a bad idea to use.
Q: The tabindex attribute can be 
geared toward people who prefer a 
keyboard over a mouse because they’ve 
got less motor control over their hands. 
But what about people that have no use 
of their hands whatsoever?
A: There are lots of web users who for 
one reason or another—such as paralysis 
or amputation—simply cannot use a mouse. 
Instead, they’ll use alternate input systems 
like pointing devices such as a head-mouse, 
head-pointer or mouth-stick; voice-
recognition software; or an eye-gaze system. 
Most of these systems will also pick up on 
your tabindexes... so that makes a logical 
tab order even more important. 
Q: Not everyone who’s got a visual 
impairment is blind–does accessibility 
apply to these people as well?
A: Absolutely. Visual disabilities not only 
include total blindness, but also include 
people who have types of low vision (also 
known as “partially sighted”). This includes 
poor acuity (vision that is not sharp), tunnel 
vision (seeing only the middle of the visual 
field), central field loss (seeing only the 
edges of the visual field), and clouded vision.
Q: Do visual disabilities include color 
blindness?
A: Yup. Basically, color blindness is a 
lack of sensitivity to certain colors—such as 
red/green or blue/yellow. Sometimes color 
blindness results in the inability to perceive 
any color whatsoever.
Q: Do we have to pay any attention to 
hearing disabilities?
A: Both deafness and hard of hearing 
are things that someone who is designing 
an accessible website needs to worry about. 
This is especially important when you’re 
working on websites that include rich media 
content, such as video or audio.
Q: What other kinds of disabilities 
should be considered when designing an 
accessible website?
A: Two disabilities to consider are 
cognitive and neurological. These include 
learning disabilities, such as dyslexia, 
attention and focus disorders, such as 
ADD, developmental disabilities that impact 
intelligence, and even memory disorders 
(things like unreliable short-term memory, 
missing long-term memory, or even the 
inability to recall language).
Q: How do you deal with all the 
cognitive and neurological disorders?
A: There are simple strategies that let you 
address cognitive and neurological disorders 
when designing an accessible website. For 
those with developmental disabilities, include 
graphics and images as an alternate way of 
communicating information. Also, sites with 
clear visual logic (something we covered 
back near the beginning of the book) help 
enormously to address many of the problems 
experienced by people with a wide variety of 
cognitive and neurological issues.

is accessibility worth it?
This whole accessibility thing is 
creating a lot of extra work. Is 
it really worth it?
Accessibility is ALWAYS worth the extra time.
It’s really easy to ask yourself why you should care about 
accessibility. It’s unlikely that your audience will have disabilities 
that impact how they experience your site, right? Is this really that 
big of a deal?
Actually, you almost certainly have someone with a 
disability trying to access your site. The U.S. Census Bureau 
categorizes 19.6% of the U.S. population as having some sort 
of disability. And if that’s not convincing, consider just a few more 
reasons why accessibility is essential!
The law requires you to be accessible 
Section 508 of the U.S. Federal Rehabilitation Act requires that Federal 
agencies make their electronic and information technology, including websites, 
accessible to people with disabilities. In addition, many universities are requiring 
that all of their official web content be accessible.
1
Everyone benefits from accessibility 
Many of the enhancements and techniques used to make websites accessible to 
people with disabilities benefit those users without disabilities. Accessible websites 
are often easier to navigate, more user-friendly, and download faster.
2
Accessibility can help your business 
Design studios with a strong understanding of accessibility will have an 
enormous advantage over those that don’t. For example, federal agencies who 
are required to abide by accessibility standards are sometimes unable ToDo so 
themselves. This means that if you have experience with designing accessible 
websites, you’ll have the opportunity to win those jobs.
3
Accessibility is the right thing ToDo 
Accessible websites represent an important step toward independence for many 
of the disabled. They provide crucial access to fundamental governmental and 
educational services and information that would otherwise be unavailable to 
individuals with certain disabilities. Designing with accessibility in mind makes 
the web a better place for everyone.

Hey, I just got this email. 
This looks like a great business 
opportunity... but what in the 
world is WCAG?
Audio-2-Go 
owner
You’re a web expert by now. What can you find out 
about the WCAG online? What does this mean for the 
Audio-2-Go site? Summarize your thoughts below:

298    Chapter 8
wcag priority 1 checklist
WCAG Priority 1
WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. The W3C, 
the folks who come up with most web standards, have defined a set of 
guidelines that will allow you to build accessible sites. Follow the WCAG 
guidelines, and your site will be a lot more accessible than if you don’t.
WCAG Priority 1 is the set of guidelines that the W3C considers as a 
baseline requirement. Ignore Priority 1 and you’ll definitely leave out some 
part of a disabled audience. Here’s what the Priority 1 guidelines look like:
http://www.w3.org/TR/
WCAG10/full-checklist.html
This document has Priority 
2 and 3, too. Audio-2-
Go just has to meet the 
Priority 1 guidelines.

accessibility
Whoa... that list is huge! It’s going 
to take forever to make the Audio-2-Go 
site WCAG Priority 1 compliant... and we’ve 
already done so much work, anyway.
The WCAG has to cover every conceivable possibility on 
almost every type of site possible. That means it deals with 
lots of things that may not affect your site.
On top of that, lots of the WCAG checkpoints are things 
you should already be doing, like “Use the clearest and 
simplest language appropriate for a site’s content.” So 
many of these checkpoints may already be done! To 
meet Priority 1, you just have to take care of applicable 
checkpoints that aren’t already complete.
The WCAG is exhaustive... but your 
changes may not need to be.
Take a look at the checklist on the previous page, or visit the WCAG checkpoints online at 
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/full-checklist.html. Below, write any changes you think 
need to be made to Audio-2-Go to fulfill the Priority 1 checkpoints.

Your job was to figure out what we still needed ToDo with 
Audio-2-Go to make it WCAG Priority 1 compliant.
 Provide a text equivalent for every non-text element. (1.1)
 Ensure that all information conveyed with color is also available without color. (2.1)
 Organize documents so they may be read without style sheets. (6.1)
This includes graphics and icons. Those stars that 
represent ratings on each book could be a problem... 
and what does the site look like without color?
This is sort of like tabindexes... it’s about 
order. But this time, the order has to make 
sense in the markup itself. We’ve got some 
problems here.
We’ve already done this by providing alt and 
longdesc attributes to our images.
ToDo
Provide a text equivalent for all 
non-text elements.
All color information must be 
displayed without color as well.
Organize documents so they can 
be read without stylesheets.
Here’s the Audio-2-Go ToDo list we came 
up with. How does it compare with the list 
of things you thought we needed ToDo?

Q: What is the difference between WCAG Priority 1 and 
Section 508?
A: There are a few main differences. First, WCAG is a 
recommendation that was written by the W3C, the Internet’s 
governing body. Although the W3C has no authority to enforce its 
recommendation, it is considered the standard in making sure sites 
are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Section 508 is a US 
Government requirement that is based on the WCAG Priority 1 
standards. 508 requires all government agencies and companies that 
do business with the government to comply with the law. 508 is not 
enforceable in the private sector as long as a company isn’t doing 
business with the government.
Q: Can you be arrested for not complying with WCAG?
A: Not at all. WCAG is strictly a guide for making your website 
accessible. Plus, the W3C doesn’t have authority to arrest you (or 
fine you, for that matter). Still, ignoring WCAG is like ignoring a part 
of your audience, and that’s not a good thing. Even a few days spent 
on accessibility can have a huge impact on your site.
Q: Who decides if my site meets the guidelines?
A: For the most part, you decide. If you have followed along with 
guidelines and made an effort to make your site as accessible as 
possible to users with disabilities, you can call yourself accessible. 
Because Section 508 is a law, there are online services you can 
use that check and make sure your code is accessible. They will 
often allow you to post “badges” on your site that advertise the fact 
that your site meets the 508 requirement. Similar services are also 
available for the WCAG.
Ignoring accessibility is 
ignoring a part of your 
AUDIENCE. It hurts you, your 
site, and your users. 
Think about accessibility as 
a CRITICAL PART of every 
website that you design.

color blindness
Color shouldn’t be your ONLY 
form of communication
8% of males in the United States have some 
type of color blindness. The disability is far 
more common in men than in women.
ToDo
Provide a text equivalent for all 
non-text elements.
All color information must be 
displayed without color as well.
Organize documents so they can 
be read without stylesheets.
You already know that color has an emotional impact. It’d be hard to 
imagine a site without color... but that’s just how some people view at 
least a part of your websites. That’s why you must convey everything 
on your site with more than just color.
The rating stars for each book are 
colored based on the rating. Color 
is the only means of getting that 
meaning, which violates WCAG.
I’m really having a 
hard time distinguishing 
some parts of this site. I 
definitely can’t make out 
those colored stars.

Life through web-safe eyes...
You’ve probably heard about web-safe colors before. Those are the 
colors that most people say are going to look consistent on different 
resolutions and monitors. Here’s a palette of web-safe colors:
Life through color-blind eyes...
But is this palette really “web-safe”? Take a look a the same palette 
through the eyes of someone with color blindness:
These two palettes look completely 
dissimilar... which one do your users see? 
How do you think color-blindness 
can affect your choice of color 
palette? Do the triadic and tetradic 
color palettes offer any help in 
dealing with color blindness?

common types of color blindness
Original
Deutanopia (no green cones)
Audio-2-Go, via color-blind eyes
Here is the original color scheme viewed 
by someone with no color blindness.
This view shows a diminished color 
scheme, but most of the elements 
are still distinguishable.
Let’s take a look at Audio-2-Go through a few different sets of eyes. 
Depending on the cones available in the viewer, our nicely designed 
Audio-2-Go site can look totally different:

you are here 4    305
accessibility
Protanopia (no red cones)
Tritanopia (no blue cones)
This is a rarer type of color 
blindness that affects yellow tones. 
The stars are completely useless in 
this view... which definitely violates 
WCAG Priority 1.
Protanopia looks very similar to 
Deutanopia when comparing the 
Audio-2-Go site. The page looks 
bland, and the stars seem to blur 
together a fair bit.

306    Chapter 8
adding labels to the stars
<div id="featured-books"> 
  <ul> 
    <li><a tabindex="7" href="/books/1"> 
      <img alt="the elements of cooking" src="elements.jpg" /></a><br /> 
      <span class=”rating high”>Rating: 8</span> 
    </li> 
    <li><a tabindex="8" href="/books/2"> 
      <img alt="state of denial" src="sod.jpg" /></a><br /> 
      <span class=”rating medium”>Rating: 5</span> 
    </li> 
    <li><a tabindex="9" href="/books/3"> 
      <img alt="the google story" src="google.jpg" /></a><br /> 
      <span class=”rating medium”>Rating: 6</span> 
    </li> 
    <li><a tabindex="10" href="/books/4"> 
      <img alt="mary poppins" src="mp.jpg" /></a><br /> 
      <span class=”rating low”>Rating: 3</span> 
    </li> 
    <li><a tabindex="11" href="/books/5"> 
      <img alt="business of creativity" src="creativity.jpg" /></a><br /> 
      <span class=”rating high”>Rating: 9</span> 
    </li> 
    <li><a tabindex="12" href="/books/6"> 
      <img alt="designing web usability" src="dwu.jpg" /></a><br /> 
      <span class=”rating medium”>Rating: 6</span> 
    </li> 
  </ul> 
</div>
Those stars are a real problem
We’ll class the span “rating” and then give it 
another class depending on the rating (low, 
medium and high respectively)
Add a line break and 
a span to hold the 
rating number.
So the stars at Audio-2-Go are a problem. It’s not bad that they’re 
in color, but it’s bad that they only convey information through color. 
Remember one of the easiest ways to fix bad graphics or navigation? 
Add text! 
So for the ratings, we can simply add in a textual rating. Then, we can 
add the stars as a background image, just like we did with navigation 
back in Chapter 6:
Q: So we can’t use visual indicators, like the stars, anymore?
A: You definitely can. You just can’t only use visual indicators. So if you use the visual 
of a thermometer, you’d need to put a textual description next to that thermometer.
<html> 
<script src=”...
js” /> 
<img 
src=”siteLogo.
png” /> 
</html>
index.html

Background images are  your friend
#featured-books li .rating { 
  padding: 4px 0 4px 30px; 
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; 
  font-size: small; 
  text-transform: uppercase; 
}
.high { 
  background: url('../images/star_high.png') no-repeat left; 
}
.medium { 
  background: url('../images/star_medium.png') no-repeat left; 
}
.low { 
  background: url('../images/star_low.png') no-repeat left; 
}
Now there’s a 
graphical and 
textual indication 
of a book’s rating.
Depending on the class, we will display the 
appropriate colored star.
We need a new high-level 
class for ratings.
The rating class needs a 
30px left padding to clear 
the way for the star.
ToDo
Provide a text equivalent for all 
non-text elements.
All color information must be 
displayed without color as well.
Organize documents so they can 
be read without stylesheets.
still
Now we can add the stars back into the page, using CSS and the 
background property. So we need to make some additions to our 
stylesheet, screen.css:
#tabs {
...
}
screen.css
Test Drive
Color, without depending on color?
Update your versions of index.html and screen.css. Then reload the Audio-2-Go page 
and check out the featured ratings of the books. 
We can tick off 
this checkpoint now.

308    Chapter 8
content order
There’s more to ordering than just tabindexes
You’ve already used the tabindex attribute to make sure that the Tab 
key moves through your document in the right order. But the WCAG 
goes further: since there are certain accessibility devices that don’t use 
standard keyboards, your actual markup has to be in order.
In other words, to meet WCAG Priority 1, you’ve got to order your 
XHTML in the sequence your content should be viewed, regardless of 
any CSS and tabindexing.
	
       Just because your XHTML is standards compliant doesn’t 
mean your XHTML meets this WCAG checkpoint.
Having your site validate as valid XHTML just means that your markup 
is correct and without errors. The WCAG checkpoints make sure that 
you are using that markup to make your site as accessible to as many 
people as possible. The two are related, but not at all the same.

This is the same 
change we made 
to the main page: 
we need text, not 
just images, for 
the book ratings.
This page was already ordered 
correctly, with headings, then 
the Top Books list, and then 
the features. So we didn’t need 
ToDo any re-ordering.

wrapping up accessibility
Test Drive
Test Audio-2-Go’s accessibility
It’s all well and good to implement accessibility measures, but you also need to test your site. 
So, how can you do this?  Well, there are a couple of ways:
Get a copy of the assistive technologies in question (like a screen reader), and take the site 
for a test drive yourself. Or, even better, you can use software, such as Cynthia Says, that 
automatically checks a site for WCAG compliance: http://www.contentquality.com/
Update both the home page and the Books page, and see how Audio-2-Go looks.
Give Audio-2-Go a test with the 
Cynthia Says validator.

accessibility
You’ll never believe the email 
I just got! You really hit it out of 
the park with the updates you made. 
And I hope you don’t mind not paying 
taxes anymore...
Looks like being accessible 
is really paying off!


Accessibility is both the process and the techniques 
used to create a site that can be used by someone with 
a disability.
A screen reader is a piece of software used by the blind 

and the visually impaired that reads the text of a website 
aloud.
The 

ALT attribute (which is part of the IMG element) 
allows you to provide an alternate text description for an 
image—which is read by the screen reader.
LONGDESC

 is an attribute of the IMG element 
which provides a link to a page which contains a text 
description of an image that is too long for an ALT 
attribute.
People who have lost motor control of their hands often 

use the tab key instead of a mouse to move from link to 
link on a webpage.
TABINDEX

 lets you manually set the position of a 
specific link in a tab sequence.
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 

from the W3C were the first major effort to establish 
guidelines for accessible design—it consists of fourteen 
guidelines, each with three checkpoint levels.
You don’t have to worry about items on the WCAG 

checklist that don’t apply to your site.
Organize the markup of your page so that it reads 

logically if it were not rendered with a style sheet.
Make sure that all information conveyed with color is 

also available without color.
If you use tables in your site, make sure that columns 

and rows have headers.
Use software like Cynthia Says to check the accessibility 

of your site.
ToDo
Provide a text equivalent for all 
non-text elements.
All color information must be 
displayed without color as well.
Organize documents so they can 
be read without stylesheets.
For data tables, identify row and 
column headers.
Man, the book 
ratings make so 
much more sense to me 
now.
Audio-2-Go 
is behaving much 
better with my 
JAWS reader. 
I’m glad I can 
finally Tab through 
the site. Time to 
check out some books.
The WCAG checklist is complete!
