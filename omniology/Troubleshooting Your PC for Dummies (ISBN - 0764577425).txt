About the Author
Dan Gookin has been writing about technology for 20 years. He has con-
tributed articles to numerous high-tech magazines and written more than
90 books about personal computing technology, many of them accurate.
He combines his love of writing with his interest in technology to create books
that are informative and entertaining, but not boring. Having sold more than
14 million titles translated into more than 30 languages, Dan can attest that
his method of crafting computer tomes does seem to work.
Perhaps Dan’s most famous title is the original DOS For Dummies, published
in 1991. It became the world’s fastest-selling computer book, at one time
moving more copies per week than the New York Times number-one best seller
(although, because it’s a reference book, it could not be listed on the NYT
best seller list). That book spawned the entire line of For Dummies books,
which remains a publishing phenomenon to this day.
Dan’s most recent titles include PCs For Dummies, 9th Edition; C All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies; Dan Gookin’s Naked Windows XP; Buying a
Computer For Dummies, 2005 Edition; and Dan Gookin’s Naked Office. He also
publishes a free weekly computer newsletter, “Weekly Wambooli Salad,” full
of tips, how-tos, and computer news. He also maintains the vast and helpful
Web page www.wambooli.com.
Dan holds a degree in communications and visual arts from the University
of California, San Diego. He lives in the Pacific Northwest, where he enjoys
spending time with his four boys in the gentle woods of Idaho.

Introduction
W
ow! This book made it to the second edition. Who’d have thunk that
there was that much PC trouble out there?
Ah. The innocent. The naïve. The newbies. . . .
For the uninitiated, I have news for you: Trouble lurks around your computer
like teenagers at the mall. That’s why you need this book! It uncovers the
secrets and the power lurking beneath the goofy-colored Windows shell.
Trouble will run scared and naked as you merely show this book’s cover to
your computer monitor. No more waiting on hold to get the answers! No more
reinstalling Windows! The truth, well, it’s in here!
Computers aren’t supposed to die or crash or hang or bomb or toss a hissy
fit for no apparent reason. But, as any computer owner knows, computers
often don’t do what they’re told. In it-was-working-yesterday syndrome, for
some reason your computer decides that today is a different day and so it
will act up. And in the who-owns-the-problem? issue, you have to decide
whether the printer isn’t working because of the printer itself or because of
Windows or because of the application that’s trying to print. I won’t even
bore you with random Internet-disconnect problems, dead mice, monitors
thrust into stupid mode, and a myriad of other problems — because these
and other issues are all adequately covered, cured, and remedied throughout
this handy little book.
Oh! And that Dummies thing? Face it: Anyone who uses a computer feels
intimidated enough. It’s not that you’re a dummy, but dealing with these plas-
tic and silicon monsters certainly makes anyone feel like a dummy. Relax!
It’s the For Dummies approach that lets you recognize that it’s you who is in
charge of your PC’s destiny. You can tame the beast! This book shows you how.
About This Book
This is a problem-solving book. After all, if every problem mentioned in this
book were to land on a computer at one time, even I would toss the thing out
the window and take up yodeling or log rolling instead. The idea here is simple:
You have a problem, and you look up the solution.

You can use the index to discover where solutions to specific problems lie, or
you can just browse through Part II, which covers many solutions based on
the particular piece of the PC that’s being troubled. Each section within a
chapter mentions the problem and covers potential solutions. Sample sec-
tions include
 In the presence of unwelcome silence
 Fixing missing Hibernation mode
 The whatever-submenu on the Start menu is missing!
 The mouse is getting s-l-o-w
 Things to check when the printer isn’t printing
 Where did the download go?
 Why doesn’t it shut down?
 “Windows doesn’t remember my password!”
And many, many more. You don’t have to learn anything. You don’t have to
complete worksheets or take quizzes. Just find your problem, look up the
answer, and follow a few quick and easily explained steps, and you’re back on
your way with a working computer in no time.
How This Book Works
This book explains how to do things in a step-by-step manner. Occasionally,
solutions have a large number of steps, or sometimes you have only one or
two things to do, but, fortunately, it’s all numbered and explained in a cheer-
ful and entertaining manner.
Whenever you’re told to type something, that something appears in special
type. For example:
1. Type WINVER in the box.
This instruction tells you to type the text WINVER into the box. The next
step may be to click the OK button with the mouse or press the Enter key.
But all you need to worry about for this step is to type WINVER.
The steps tell you exactly which button to click or which gizmo to tickle with
the mouse:
2. Click the OK button.
2
Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Sometimes, these steps are shortened:
3. Click OK.
This line still means “Click the OK button with the mouse.”
Keyboard shortcuts or key-combination commands are given like this:
Press the Alt+F keys on the keyboard.
This line means to press and hold the Alt key on your keyboard and then tap
the F key. Release the Alt key. It works the same way as pressing Shift+F to
type a capital letter F, but the Alt key is used rather than Shift.
Likewise, you may use the Ctrl key in combination with other keyboard 
characters.
The key between the Ctrl and Alt keys in the lower-left corner of your key-
board is the Windows key, which is abbreviated as “Win” throughout this
book. So, whenever you see
Win+F
it means to press and hold the Win key and then tap the F key.
Choosing items from the menu works like this:
Choose Edit➪Paste.
This line means to use the mouse to click the Edit menu and then click again
to choose the Paste item from that menu. (You can also use the keyboard to
work the menus, in which case you press the Alt key and then the underlined
letter of the menu or command to choose that command.)
What You’re Not to Read
I just can’t help being technical at times. So, when I break into a high-tech
song, I let you know. Reading that material may increase your knowledge for
playing computer trivia, but, otherwise, such asides and tidbits are written
because — after 20 years of writing computer books — I just can’t help myself!
The trivia and asides are always marked as optional reading. Don’t bother
trying to figure out what’s important and what’s just the author babbling.

Introduction

Foolish Assumptions
I must assume a few things about you, O dear, gentle reader: You use a 
computer. Specifically, you use a computer (or PC) that runs the Windows
operating system, Windows XP Edition, either the Home or Professional 
version. This book mentions the SP2 update where appropriate.
This book assumes that you’re using Windows XP in the graphical XP mode.
That is, not the Windows Classic or NT mode. The difference is in the way
you log in to Windows as well as the Start button’s menu display.
The name of the menu on which your programs are located is called the All
Programs menu in this book. In some versions of Windows XP, this menu
appears as Programs only.
In this book, I assume that you view the Control Panel in Classic mode. To
switch to Classic mode, look on the left side of the Control Panel window, in
the Control Panel task pane area. Choose the link labeled Switch to Classic
View to see things as this book describes them.
This book doesn’t cover previous versions of Windows. For information on
Windows 98 and Windows Me, try to find this book’s first edition.
How This Book Is Organized
This book contains four major parts to whet your troubleshooting appetite.
Each part contains chapters that help further explain the part subject. Then,
each chapter is divided into individual sections that address specific issues.
Everything is cross-referenced. You don’t have to read the entire book, from
front to back. You may start reading anywhere and receive the full enjoyment
that you would if you were to start on the first page or wherever the binding
falls open when you try to lay this book on its back.
Part I: What the @#$%&*!?
The chapters in this part of the book serve as a handy introduction to the
entire notion of troubleshooting your PC. I give you some explanations, some
quick things to try, plus helpful tips and advice on where to go when you
can’t find the answers.
4
Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor 
Irks and Quirks
The chapters in this part make up the book’s core. Each chapter covers a
specific aspect of the computer, either some piece of hardware or something
you do, such as use the Internet. Each chapter contains general troubleshoot-
ing information and some specific (and common) questions and answers
along with their possible solutions.
Part III: Preventive Maintenance
Nothing beats being prepared. The chapters in this part tell you how to best
prepare for the potential of PC peril and how to optimize your system, and
you get some general good advice on what to do “just in case.”
Part IV: The Part of Tens
The traditional For Dummies Part of Tens contains several chapters with
some good advice, all bundled into neat lists of ten.
Icons Used in This Book
This icon flags something I would consider a tip (though just about all the
information in this book falls into the Tip category).
This icon serves as a special reminder to do something or to remember
something.
This icon serves as a special reminder not to do something or to definitely
not forget something.
This infamous icon alerts you to the presence of highly technical stuff dis-
cussed in the text nearby. It’s optional reading only!

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
Read on! If you don’t know where to start, start at Chapter 1, which is why I
made that text Chapter 1 and not Chapter 4.
The first part of the book serves as a basic orientation, and Chapter 2 is an
excellent introduction to some immediate troubleshooting fixes you can try.
Otherwise, look up the problem and find the solution. It’s in here somewhere.
As an author, I agree to support my books. If you have any questions about
this book or need something explained further, you can e-mail me at
dgookin@wambooli.com. That’s my real e-mail address, and I do respond to
every e-mail sent to me. I cannot, however, troubleshoot your computer for
you! That’s what this book is for! But I can help answer questions about the
book or just say “Hello, thank you for writing,” if that’s all you want.
I also offer a free weekly newsletter, which you can subscribe to. The news-
letter offers updates, news, Q&A, how-tos, opinions, and lots of supplemental
information to this and all my books. It costs nothing, and it contains no ads
or junk. Check it out, at

Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part I
What the
@#$%&*!?

In this part . . .
T
here is a lightbulb in Livermore, California — the
Centennial Light. The lightbulb has been burning for
more than 100 years. Solid. Steady. Fivescore years of
luminosity. Amazing. (You can visit the lightbulb at
www.centennialbulb.org.)
The Centennial lightbulb is an exception. Lightbulbs are
not expected to illuminate for more than a given amount
of time, often less than a year. If you’ve ever bought a light-
bulb, you know and accept this fact. You don’t operate
under the assumption that just because some bulb in
Livermore has glowed happily for more than a century,
you will see the same performance from the lightbulbs
you buy at Home Depot. That would be ridiculous. Even
so, most people expect their computers to behave flaw-
lessly from the moment they come out of the box to some
mythical PC death date several years hence.
The ugly truth: There is no such thing as, nor will there
ever be, any computer that runs flawlessly for any length
of time. No, only the Centennial Light owns the market on
electronic longevity. Computers? They crash. That’s reality.
The chapters in this part of the book show you how to
deal with it.

Chapter 1
It’s Not Your Fault! Well, It Might
Be Your Fault (How to Tell
Whether It’s Your Fault)
In This Chapter
 Discovering whether it’s your fault
 Investigating what causes PC problems
 Emotionally dealing with a crash
D
uring my 20-odd years of helping folks use their computers, I have
noticed one unfortunate and common belief:
People tend to blame themselves for just about anything that goes wrong
inside a PC.
This is not always true, of course. Computers crash for a number of reasons,
and most of the time it’s really not your fault. Yet, when the computer some-
times does something strange or unexpected, even I catch myself saying
“What did I do now?”
Alas, the sad truth is that with a computer, you should expect the unexpected.
So, before you plan on doing any troubleshooting, please set the proper frame
of mind. Rather than immediately jump to the what-have-I-done? conclusion,
practice saying the following mantra:
Oh, my. The computer is behaving in a random and unexpected manner. I sup-
pose that I shall have to look into this to see what can be done to remedy the 
situation.

There. It’s totally neutral, merely an observation coupled with a determina-
tion on your behalf to fix things. With that proper attitude set, you’re ready to
begin your troubleshooting odyssey.
Computers shouldn’t crash, of course. They’re not designed to. Really! But
they do, for two reasons, neither of which is really your responsibility:
 The software has bugs in it.
 There is an utter lack of cooperation.
Why It’s Not Your Fault
It can be argued (and it is, by software and hardware developers) that using
software is your fault. Yes, you can stumble across a bug. Zip-flash! The pro-
gram crashes, and your data is gone, and you attempt seppuku with a letter
opener. Stuff happens. Is it really your fault? No. You were the trigger, but the
fault isn’t your own. Put that letter opener away!
10
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 
Computer foul-up terms not worth memorizing
Glitch: Whenever the computer does something
strange or unexpected or behaves in a manner
inconsistent with normal operation, that’s a
glitch. Glitches happen to everyone. Often, you
fail to notice a glitch unless it does something
that directly affects what you’re doing. For
example, you don’t notice a sound glitch until
you try to make your computer squawk. The
sound may have not been working for weeks,
but you notice it missing only when you other-
wise would expect it. Such is the agony of the
glitch.
Bug: A bug is an error in a computer program.
Despite the efforts of the best programmers,
most computer software is riddled with bugs.
Bugs are what cause computer glitches. Bad
bugs can cause a computer to hang or crash.
Note that most of the worst bugs happen 
when you mix two programs together and they
interact in some new and unexpected way. The
term comes from the early days of computing,
when a real bug (a moth) got stuck in the 
circuitry.
Hang: A totally unresponsive computer is said
to be hung, or hanged. You could also use the
term frozen, though hang is the accepted term
used by computer nerds for generations.
Crash: Crash is another term for a dead 
computer — specifically, what happens to a
hard drive when it ceases operation. A crash is
typically more sensational than a hang.
Remember that a hang is a freeze. A crash is
typically accompanied by spectacular warning
messages or weird behavior (and may indicate
more than just a dying hard drive). In fact, a
crashed computer may still be teasingly func-
tional. Only the foolhardy continue to use a
crashed computer.

In addition to bugs is the lack-of-cooperation issue. Software and hardware
vendors can check their products in only certain PC configurations. Chances
are — given the tremendous number of people who own computers and all
the software and hardware combinations you can have — that somehow you
will stumble across that one particular blend that wreaks havoc in the com-
puter. Is that your fault? Technically, no, because the manufacturer should
build reliable stuff.
So there you have it. The computer is a device that’s not designed to crash, but
through the odd chance of a software bug or some weird software-hardware
mixture, it does crash, and crash often. Yes, I would quite agree that the reason
it happens is not your fault.
How It Possibly Could Be Your Fault
You’re not off the hook!
Rarely in my travels have I found someone who has somehow influenced
the computer to go wacky. In fact, only a few things have been known to be
directly related to human problems. These causes are covered in this section.
11
Chapter 1: It’s Not Your Fault! Well, It Might Be Your Fault
Why do computers have bugs?
In the real world, bugs — or, more accurately,
insects — are a necessary part of the ecosys-
tem. In a computer system, bugs are evil and
entirely unnecessary. Yet they exist.
A bug is an error in a computer program. It’s an
accident, caused by an oversight on the part of
the programmer, sloppy programming, or a lack
of anticipation. For example, a programmer may
not anticipate that a user may have a last name
that’s more than 25 characters long and that
when you type that 26th character, the program
waltzes off into La-La Land. Or, the programmer
may type variable_AM1 when he really meant
to type variable_AM2 or something similar.
No programmer creates bugs on purpose. In
fact, most programming involves removing bugs
as opposed to writing new code. So, a pro-
grammer types a set of instructions, runs them,
fixes them, runs them, fixes them, and back and
forth until all the bugs are (hopefully) worked
out. Programmers even invite others (beta
testers) to check their programs for bugs. After
all, the programmers can’t possibly figure out
every possible way their software will be used.
The object is to make the final product as
bugfree as possible.
When you discover a bug, which is the case
with most PC trouble, you should report it to the
software developers. They’re the ones — not
you — responsible for fixing the bug!

You did something new to the computer
Computers are very conservative; they don’t like change. The most stable
computer I have in my office has only Microsoft Word installed on it. Nothing
else is used on that computer — not the Internet, no games, no nothing! The
computer still crashes, but not as often as other systems in my office.
The key to having a more stable computer is not to install new software or
hardware. Unfortunately, this advice is nearly impossible to follow. It’s not
that the mere act of installing something new causes the computer to crash.
No, it’s just that installing something new introduces another combination
into the system — a new potion into the elixir, so to speak — and an incom-
patibility or conflict may come from that. It’s what I call the it-was-working-
yesterday syndrome.
For example, one of my readers writes in and says, “The sound is gone from
my computer! I had sound yesterday, but today it’s all gone!” The first thing 
I ask is whether the person installed any new hardware or software. The
answer is generally “Yes,” and that’s what prompted the problem.
Sometimes, you can forget that you have installed new stuff, which makes the
problem seem random. After all, the computer is acting goofy, and it’s easy to
overlook that you downloaded some corny animation from the Internet yes-
terday. Yet that one change was enough to alter the system.
 Yes, if you had one computer for every program, you would probably
live a relatively crashfree high-tech existence. But I don’t recommend
spending your money that way.
 Try to keep track of the times that you add, update, or change the hard-
ware and software in your computer system.
 If possible, do research to determine the new stuff’s compatibility with
your existing computer system. Do that before you install. The manufac-
turer’s or developer’s Web page lists known technical issues.
 These types of new hardware and software installations are why utilities
such as System Restore are so popular. For more information, see the
section in Chapter 4 about using System Restore.
You were bad and deleted files 
you shouldn’t have deleted
Delete only those files you created yourself. It’s when people go on file-hunting
expeditions that they can get into trouble. In fact, deleting a swath of files is
typically the only reason I recommend reinstalling Windows. After all, if you
12
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

surgically remove a great portion of your operating system, reinstalling is the
only way to get it back. (For all other problems, you generally have a solution
other than reinstalling Windows.)
Here is what’s okay to delete:
 Files (icons) in the My Documents folder
 Files in any folders in the My Documents folder
 Any folders created in the My Documents folder or its subfolders
 Zip files you have downloaded and installed
That’s it!
Never, ever, delete any other files anywhere else on your computer. I know
that you may want to! The urge may be irresistible! You may go on a “clean-
ing” binge and yearn to mow down files like some crazed gardener with a
high-speed weed whacker. Don’t!
 Oh, and you can delete any shortcut icons you may find. Deleting a
shortcut icon doesn’t delete the original file.
 You can delete any icon on the desktop. Most are shortcuts anyway.
 You can also delete items from the Start menu, though I recommend
against it.
13
Chapter 1: It’s Not Your Fault! Well, It Might Be Your Fault
Creating a system log file
One way I keep track of my computer’s foibles is
to create a system log file. That’s nothing fancy,
just a plain text file in which I jot down any
changes, updates, modifications, or other non-
productive things I do on the computer.
The log file is created by right-clicking the
mouse on the desktop. From the pop-up menu,
choose New➪Text Document. The New Text
Document icon appears; immediately rename it
by typing Log File.txt or something equally
descriptive. Then, keep that icon parked on your
desktop for quick and easy access.
When you change something on your computer,
add an entry to the file: Double-click to open the
Log File icon. At the end of the file, add your text.
For example:
March 10 -- Updated printer
driver software
or
March 11 -- Downloaded screen
saver
That way, you can review the changes you have
made to your computer and correlate them to
any new bugs the system may have. You may be
amazed at the “coincidences” between your
log file and any problems with the computer.

 Zip files are also known as compressed folders in Windows.
 Most programs you download come in zip file archives. After you extract
the files, you can delete the zip file archive.
 I create a special folder, called Downloads, in the My Documents folder.
(I suppose that I should call it My Downloads, just to fit in with every-
thing else.) That’s where I store all my downloaded files, zip files, and
e-mail attachments. It’s also a great folder to clean out to free up some
space on the hard drive.
 No, I don’t ever recommend reinstalling Windows. See Chapter 20 for the
reasons.
Other ways to remove files you 
didn’t create yourself
The main complaint I get with my “Delete only those files you created your-
self” maxim is that people find on the computer other files that they’re just
itching to delete themselves. These files include
 Internet cookies
 Temporary files (especially temporary Internet files)
 Wallpapers and extra media files
 Programs that are unwanted or no longer used
 Pieces of Windows they want to get rid of
 Stuff I can’t think of right now
Avoid the temptation to manually delete these files! It gets you into trouble!
“But, Dan!” you whine, “a friend said that it’s okay to manually delete my
Internet cookies!”
Well . . . there are proper ways to delete the cookies, rid yourself of tempo-
rary files, clean and scour unwanted programs, and remove things you 
don’t need. Use those proper ways! Do not attempt to manually delete things
yourself. You will get into trouble if you do.
 See Chapter 18 for information on dealing with cookies.
 Also see Chapter 23 for information on properly removing unwanted
files from your computer.
 It’s not your fault that the computer crashes — especially if you follow
my advice in this section!
14
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

How old is your PC?
The older your computer is, the more likely it is to crash. I have no idea
why. Systems that run stable for years may suddenly experience a growing
number of glitches. It happens so often that I refer to it as “tired RAM.” And,
alas, no electronic equivalent of Geritol is available for your PC’s tired RAM.
When your PC gets old, you have to prepare for inevitable quirkiness from it.
You can try replacing the parts piece by piece, but eventually you wind up
spending more on parts than you would for an entirely new system. No
matter how much you love your computer, when it comes time for it to go,
let it go.
 The average computer lasts between four and six years.
 If you’re in business, plan on replacing your PCs every four years. The
boost in productivity from the new models alone is worth the expense.
 For the home, keep your PC as long as you can. If it still works, great!
Even if you do buy a new system, you can still use the old system for the
kids to do homework or play games.
 I have a “bone yard” full of old computer pieces and parts. It’s not all
junk either; recently, I used parts from several old computers to create a
file server for my network.
 The main problem with older computers: parts! I have an older PC that
can only “see” 8GB of hard drive storage, yet the smallest hard drive I
can find for sale is 20GB. Oops.
15
Chapter 1: It’s Not Your Fault! Well, It Might Be Your Fault
Things to say when the computer crashes
Frack! Wonderful, forceful, yet completely 
G-rated term. Sounds like you-know-what, but
utterly non-offensive. Has that quasi-German
feel to it.
Oh, come on. . . . As though the computer could
hear you, but at least shifts the blame from your-
self to the device. (My personal variation is
“Come on, you pig!” for when the computer is
behaving stubbornly slow.)
What the —? A natural and common response
to an unexpected situation. Can be followed by
“Frack” or a frack-like equivalent.
Please! Please! Please! Pleading with the com-
puter is very emotional, but it really doesn’t help.
Most users typically follow the pleading with
“Oh, you sorry son-of-a-[female dog].”
You stupid @#$%&!? piece of @#$%!! Very def-
initely getting it out of your system, this satisfy-
ing phrase just feels good to say. Note how
blame is placed entirely on the computer. That’s
keeping the proper perspective.

 The first things to fail on any old PC are the things that move the most,
such as any disk drive, the mouse, or the keyboard.
 A failing hard drive is typically the sign of a PC entering its twilight
years. You will notice that the disk drive takes longer to access files and
that Check Disk (or similar disk utilities) begin to report more disk
errors and bad sectors. See Part III for information on what to do next.
 Mice can fail long before the rest of the computer. This problem may not
be a portent of the PC’s ultimate demise; see Chapter 13 for more mouse
information.
 When your PC does die, bid it adieu. Salvage what you can; no point in
tossing out the monitor, mouse, keyboard, modem, or other “pieces
parts” that could work on another computer. Properly dispose of the
rest of the computer according to the PC disposal laws of your locality.
What You Can Do about It
Whether it’s your fault or not, it’s your job to do something about a computer
glitch. This book is your best tool for helping you find a solution, so the next
step is to continue reading.
Before you do, be aware that you go through certain emotional phases as you
experience and deal with your computer’s often irrational behavior. I have
categorized them in chronological order:
 Guilt: Despite my insistence, just about everyone feels guilty when the
computer fouls up. “Is it my fault?” “What did I do?” Even after years of
troubleshooting other people’s computers, I still blame myself. It must
be a human gene or some instinct we have — probably proof that
mankind was created by robots from another planet eons ago.
 Anger: Yeah, hit the monitor! Get it out of your system. “Stupid PC!
Stupid PC! Why do you always crash when I’m doing something impor-
tant! Arghghgh!” Yes, you have a right to expect obedience from your
personal electronics. Too bad the drones in the manufacturer’s Human
Usability Labs don’t express their anger so readily.
 Fear or depression: “This dumb thing will never work.” Wrong! This
book helps you eliminate your fear and get over the depression phase.
 Acceptance: Hey, it’s a computer. It crashes. It could be your fault, but
chances are that it’s something else. You must deal with the problem.
Be stronger and wiser than the computer.
16
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

 Confidence: “I have Troubleshooting Your PC For Dummies! I can solve
any problem!” This book lists many solutions to many common glitches,
but also helps you to troubleshoot just about any problem. And I have
rarely met a PC problem that cannot be solved, some simply by restart-
ing your computer.
 Success: Your computer is back to normal, and everything is right with
the universe. World peace is just around the corner! It’s raining money!
And bluebirds will help you get dressed in the morning. Let’s all sing.

have yet to meet a computer problem that doesn’t present me with a bou-
quet of panic as I open the door. That’s fine. Get over it. Then, rather than
dwell on the whos, whys, or hows of the problem, try a few of the quick-and-
dirty techniques presented in this chapter to see whether you can remedy
the situation. Then, get on with your work!
Some Quick Keyboard Things You Can Do
The keyboard is the computer’s ears. After you have tried shouting at the
thing, do some typing instead. The computer most definitely “hears” that.
Well, unless the keyboard is dead. But there are ways around that as well!
Test the keyboard
To see whether the keyboard is responding, press the Caps Lock key. If the
keyboard is alive and well, the Caps Lock light blinks on and off as you tap
the Caps Lock key. That shows you that the keyboard is alive and paying
attention.
Figure 2-1 illustrates where you find the Caps Lock key and Caps Lock light on
most computer keyboards. (Some may be exceptions.)

20
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 
 If the keyboard is dead, use the mouse to restart the computer, a subject
covered later in this chapter. Restarting the computer awakens most
snoozing keyboards.
 Alas, in some cases the keyboard can be alive, yet the computer is 
ignoring what it’s saying. I have seen this situation more often with USB
keyboards than with the keyboards that plug directly into a keyboard
port on the PC. In these cases, the Caps Lock light does indeed blink on
and off, but the computer is still deader than a doornail. Time to restart
the computer.
 More keyboard troubleshooting information is offered in Chapter 13.
Use Ctrl+Z for immediate file relief
If you ever botch a file operation — moving, deleting, copying, renaming —
immediately press the Undo key combination, Ctrl+Z. That undoes just about
any file operation you can imagine.
 You must be prompt with the Ctrl+Z key press. The Undo command
undoes only the most recent file operation. If you delete a file and then
rename a file, the Undo command undoes only the renaming. You have
to find another solution for any earlier problems that need fixing.
 Most people forget that editing items and submenus on the Start menu is
really a file operation. When you screw up something on the Start menu,
such as dragging an icon off the Start menu and onto the desktop, press-
ing Ctrl+Z fixes it right away. Remember that!

Chapter 2: Stuff to Try First
 Whoops! You cannot undo a Shift+Delete file operation. That’s why
Windows warns you that deleting a file in that manner renders the file
permanently deleted.
 If Ctrl+Z, or the Undo command, doesn’t work, give up. It means that
either it’s too late to undo the operation or the operation wasn’t
undoable in the first place. You have to try something else.
Escape! Escape!
The Esc key on your keyboard is called Escape for a reason: It often gets you
out of tight situations! Most scary things that happen on a PC can instantly
be canceled or backed away from by pressing the handy Esc key.
Using the keyboard in Windows when 
the mouse doesn’t work
Windows needs a mouse, so if you can’t get
your mouse to work, you need to rely on the key-
board to finish up whatever tasks you can and
then restart the computer. Here are some handy
key combinations you can use in place of some
mouse techniques:
Ctrl+S: Saves a document to disk. Always save!
If you can’t work the commands in the Save As
dialog box, just save the file wherever you can;
you can move it to a better location the next
time you start Windows or recover the mouse.
Esc: Cancels a dialog box; closes some 
windows.
Enter: Does the same thing as pressing the OK,
or “default,” button in a dialog box.
Tab: Moves between various gizmos in a dialog
box. Try using the arrow keys or spacebar to
activate the gizmos.
Alt+F4: Closes a window.
Win (the Windows key): Can be used to pop up
the Start menu. You can then use the arrow keys
and Enter to select items from the menu.
Ctrl+Esc: Pops up the Start menu when you
have an older computer keyboard without a
Windows key.
You can use other keys all throughout Windows
to do just about anything the mouse can do, but
that’s missing the point here: When something
is amiss, you should try to save your stuff and
then restart Windows. Don’t use a dead mouse
as an excuse to show off your keyboard skills.
See the section nearby on restarting Windows
when the mouse doesn’t work. That typically
fixes most mouse problems.

The Drastic Measure of Restarting
Windows (Yet It Works)
Drastic is perhaps too severe a word. To me, it conjures up images of amputa-
tion or — worse — having to drink a barium shake. Ick. Yet, for some cosmic
reason, the “drastic” step of restarting Windows tends to work out many of
the more frustrating and seemingly devious computer foibles.
 Restart is the term used by Microsoft. Old-timers may use the term reset
or even reboot to describe the same thing.
 Real old-timers may even call it a warm boot. Boots were popular with
early computer users, though many of them chose to wear sandals.
Restarting Windows
Believe it or not, a simple restart of Windows can fix most problems: mouse,
keyboard, modem, network, or graphics. Try it! If it doesn’t work, you can
move on to other solutions offered later in this book.
To restart Windows, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Choose Turn Off Computer.
The Turn Off Computer dialog box appears, shown in Figure 2-2.
3. Choose Restart.
After successfully completing these steps, Windows shuts everything down
and immediately restarts. Hopefully, that clears up whatever dilemma existed.
Figure 2-2:
Various
options for
quitting
Windows.

23
Chapter 2: Stuff to Try First
 If you have any unsaved documents open, you’re asked to save them
before Windows restarts.
 Be sure to remember to remove any floppy disk from Drive A; otherwise,
your computer may restart from that disk.
 Some CD discs can be used to start the computer as well. If your PC is
configured to allow a CD to start the computer, you should remove that
CD from the drive.
 Refer to Chapter 8 for more solutions to startup problems.
 Close any command-prompt (DOS) windows before you restart. Any
command-prompt programs that are still running halt the shutdown
process in its tracks. You must properly quit the command-prompt pro-
gram and then try to restart Windows.
 If you’re connected to the Internet, the act of restarting Windows discon-
nects you. That means if you’re doing anything on the Internet, such as
downloading a file, the task is interrupted and you have to start over
when the computer comes back on.
 You must restart Windows! Don’t just log off. You must choose the
restart option as described in this section.
 Sometimes, you may even have to turn the computer off to fix the prob-
lem. See the later section “Restarting when everything is dead.”
Maybe you want to wait for that download
If you’re connected to the Internet and down-
loading a program, you may want to wait a bit
before restarting Windows. Even if the keyboard
is dead and the mouse doesn’t work, sit back
and watch the download. If the data is still
moving, you’re okay. Wait for the download to
complete. Then, after the information is fully
received (or sent), you can attempt to restart
Windows.
The reason this strategy works is that Windows
can do several things at once. Although the
mouse or keyboard may be dead, and other pro-
grams are running amok, the Internet connec-
tion may not be affected. Information may still
fly in or out despite other parts of the computer
playing possum. If you’re lucky, you may get that
file downloaded and not have to start over.
To determine whether the download is working,
keep an eye on the progress meter. If it’s
moving, the data is flying. Good. Otherwise, if
the meter is still for a few minutes, go ahead and
restart Windows.

24
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 
Restarting Windows when the mouse is
dead but the keyboard is alive
If the mouse pointer is stuck to the screen like some dead bug on a car’s
windshield, you have to rely on the keyboard to restart Windows. This task
isn’t as hard as it seems (and I suppose I’m saying that because of my years
of experience in doing this):
1. Press the Win key to pop up the Start menu.
If your keyboard lacks a Win key, press the Ctrl+Esc key combination.
2. Press U to choose the Shutdown command.
3. Use the arrow keys to highlight and select the Restart option.
4. Press the Enter key.
If you’re prompted to save any documents, do so. Don’t fret if you can’t work
the Save As dialog box; just save the document to disk and worry about relo-
cating the file after the computer starts (and the mouse is, hopefully, back in
action).
 You can also use the steps in this section when the mouse is behaving in
a stubborn or slow manner.
 If you have a USB mouse (one that connects to the PC by using a USB
port rather than the mouse port), the problem may be with another
USB device misbehaving. Consider disconnecting the USB scanner, disk
drive, or other USB device to see whether that action remedies the stuck
or sluggish mouse.
 You can use the computer’s hard drive light as a way to read its pulse.
When the hard drive light is flashing, the computer is still alive and
working. If the light is dead, or if the light pulses regularly over a long
period, the computer most likely is locked up.
 Be patient! The computer may be unbearably slow. Even so, as long as
you’re getting a response, it’s better to shut down properly than to just
unplug the sucker.
Restarting when everything is dead
Ah! Life at the end of Dismal Street. The keyboard is clacking, but the com-
puter is slacking. You could roll the mouse to the North Pole and back, but
the mouse pointer on the screen is oblivious. Time to be severely drastic:

25
Chapter 2: Stuff to Try First
1. Press the computer’s power button to turn it off.
If briefly pressing the power button doesn’t work, press and hold it for
several seconds. On some computers, this press-and-hold action turns
off the power.
Yes, if things appear hopeless, just unplug the PC. Or — better still —
flip the switch on the surge protector (or power strip or UPS).
2. After the computer is off, wait a few seconds.
Honestly, I don’t know why you wait, but you should. One tech guy told
me that you wait to ensure that the hard drives properly “spin down,”
which is analogous to my washing machine, where I definitely don’t
want to stick my hand in there until the thing has done its spin-down.
Another techy type told me that you have to wait for the RAM to drain. 
I don’t recall whether he was intoxicated, but it sounds good to me.
Finally, I think that the wait period prevents some people from doing a
quick on-off double flip of the power switch, which has the potential of
damaging some of the computer’s components. No, it’s just best to wait
a spell before turning the thing on again.
3. Turn the computer back on.
Punch the button on the computer or turn the power strip or UPS back
on. If you do the latter, you may still have to thump the computer’s
power button to wake it up.
Hopefully, the restart resurrects your keyboard or mouse and gets you back
on your way. If not, you can try ever more things, as covered in this book.
 Older PCs had big red switches or on-off rocker buttons that really,
really, did turn off the power. Amazing.
 Some older PCs even had reset buttons, which you could use rather
than power switches to wake up dead or even catatonic PCs. I miss reset
buttons.
 Yes, I know: Some computer cases still have reset buttons on them. But
the buttons don’t seem to work like they did in the old days. Alas.
What to do about “restart guilt”
Many people feel this pang of guilt when they’re forced to restart their com-
puter — even when they have no other course of action. I call it restart guilt. It
most likely occurs because older versions of Windows came back to life with
an ominous message:
Windows was not shutdown properly.
Oh, no! Which computer gods have ye offended? Peril! Doom!

Happily for everyone, the folks at Microsoft recognized restart guilt and
removed the “Windows was not shutdown properly” message from the most
recent versions of Windows. Even so, the computer recognizes that it was
improperly shut down and performs a quick check of the system to ensure
that everything is okay. (Specifically, the Check Disk program is run to ensure
that there was no file or disk damage.)
Don’t feel guilty about this! If you’re forced to unplug the computer to get its
attention, so be it. I’m sure that computer scientists in the 1950s eventually
had to resort to unplugging their mammoth systems to wrest control when
something went haywire. You’re no different. (Well, you may not be wearing a
white lab coat while you compute.)
 The Check Disk program (or utility) scans the computer’s hard disks for
errors, missing files, corrupted data, and other annoying things. In the
case of shutting down a computer improperly, Check Disk locates the lost
file clusters that inevitably appear during an improper shutdown. The
lost file clusters are deleted, which is the best course of action to take.
 Also see Chapter 22 for soothing words of advice when you just can’t get
the computer to quit all by itself.
 If the computer starts in Safe mode, you may have a hardware glitch or
some other anomaly that needs fixing. Flip on over to Chapter 24 for
more information.
 No, it’s not required or necessary to restart in Safe mode after any crash
or system reset.
26
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 
What kind of idiot would just turn off a computer?
Obviously, if the computer is dead, the mouse is
dead, and the keyboard is dead, if all hope is lost
and that Costco-size jug of gin is looking good,
what else can you do? You have to just turn 
off the computer. You’re no idiot to act that way.
No, all the warnings and the reason for calling the
drastic step of turning off a computer “improper”
have their roots in the old days of DOS.
It was common years ago for people to use the
reset button to quit a DOS program. Because
DOS could run only one program at a time,
pressing the reset button or Ctrl+Alt+Delete was
often the fastest way to start another program.
So, when some DOS user was done with
WordPerfect, for example, he would whack the
reset button (or rapidly flip the power switch off
and on), DOS would restart, and he would be off
to run another program. This was bad.
It was bad because when programs are not
allowed to properly shut down, file fragments
and lost clusters begin to litter the hard drive.
One such system I serviced had 20 percent of
the hard drive’s space wasted with lost clusters.
So common was this practice that the warning
message was added to Windows to ensure that
people wouldn’t get lazy again and just turn off
their computers, rather than properly shut them
down. And, it has worked — almost too well.

t happens countless times a day, every day of the week: You phone techni-
cal support for your printer. After wading through the bog of voice-mail
menus, you finally get to a tech person who says “Oh, that’s a Windows prob-
lem.” So you phone Microsoft and someone there says “You really need to
call your computer dealer because you didn’t buy Windows directly from us.”
And then you phone your dealer, who says “That’s a printer problem.” And so
it goes.
The reason for the tech-support confusion (which may or may not be gen-
uine) is that no one quite knows whether you have a hardware or software
problem. If it’s a hardware problem, the printer (or hardware) manufacturer
can help you. If it’s a software problem, the software developer should help
you. When you’re troubleshooting things yourself, knowing the hardware-
software difference can save you oodles of time in tracking down the solution
to the problem. This chapter shows you how.
Whose Problem Is It?
Step 1 in any troubleshooting investigation should be eliminating the possi-
bility that you have a hardware problem. After all, if the device is working
properly, you can fairly assume that it’s the software controlling the device
that’s fouling things up.

 Hardware is anything physical in your computer. If you can touch it, it’s
hardware.
 Even the disk drives are hardware. The programs (software) are encoded
on the disks, but that doesn’t transform the disks into software.
 Software controls the hardware. Specifically, a program called a driver is
used to control every bit of hardware in the PC. If the hardware itself
functions fine, the real problem lies in the driver. Either the driver needs
updating, or other software in the computer is conflicting with the driver.
 Drivers are also known as device drivers.
Is it a hardware problem?
Specific examples of hardware and software problems (plus their solutions!)
are located throughout Part II of this book. Generally speaking, however,
hardware problems crop up suddenly and are not random.
For example, when the printer breaks, it stops working. That’s a hardware
problem. But, if you cannot print when you use Outlook Express though you
can print in every other program, that’s a software problem. The printer is
being affected by one particular program, Outlook Express. Otherwise, the
hardware apparently works just fine.
If the computer shuts itself off half an hour after you start using it — no matter
which programs you run — that’s a hardware problem. It isn’t random. It’s
generally one half-hour, and it’s most likely caused by something getting too
hot inside the case — again, hardware.
If the tray on the CD-ROM drive no longer slides open — yup: hardware.
The Enter key doesn’t work. Hardware.
Only when the problem seems more random or unpredictable is the software
to blame, though that’s not a hard-and-fast rule (which is one reason that
troubleshooting is so tough).
How hardware fails
Hardware can fail electronically or physically. Both ways are fairly easy to spot.
Electronic failure of hardware usually happens within one month of purchase.
If the electronics don’t work, were cheap, or were improperly assembled or
installed, or the hardware is just bad, it fails right away. That’s good because
the warranty on just about any computer covers such failures, and whatever
goes kaput is replaced free of charge.
28
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

The physical failure of hardware happens only when the hardware moves.
Fortunately, a PC has few moving parts on it: the disk drives and keyboard.
When a disk drive stops spinning, it’s dead! It needs replacement. Fortunately,
the disk drive usually has a period of intermittent errors, stops and starts, and
hits and misses before this happens, which gives you plenty of warning.
Removable disk drives may have problems with their doors or eject mecha-
nisms, which are obvious to spot.
Finally, the keyboard can fail. Cheap ones can go quickly, usually all at once.
The better-made keyboards may lose a key here and there, but they can be
fixed. Well, better than fixing, any keyboard can be replaced, and it’s inexpen-
sive to do so.
 A cheap keyboard is one that utterly lacks a “clack” or “click” when you
type; the keys feel mushy. That’s because the keyboard is most likely a
touch-membrane model with spring-activated keys. If the membrane,
which is like a flimsy rubber sheet, breaks, the keyboard is finished.
 Nearly all hardware is replaceable, which is often cheaper than fixing
things. For example, a CD-ROM drive can be fixed, but often it’s just
cheaper to get a newer, better CD-ROM drive as a replacement.
 Avoid repair outfits that attempt to fix electronic components. Yes, even
electronic components (the motherboard, plug-in cards, and so on) can
easily and cheaply be replaced if they’re damaged. I speak from experi-
ence here: I paid a guy close to $1,000 to solder new chips to an old laser
printer’s motherboard. The cost of a new laser printer at the time?
$1,200 — an expensive lesson.
Is it a software problem?
Of the two types of problems, hardware and software, software is more
common because it’s the software that does everything in a computer.
Alas, software trouble is more devious than hardware trouble. Consider that
most software has unknown bugs in it and no software developer fully tests
programs in all possible configurations. Tracking the problem can be tough.
The good news is that software problems can be predictable. If you find that
choosing some option in a program causes the computer to lock up — and it
behaves that way time and time again — it’s a software bug. If the mouse
stops working in only one program, it’s a software problem.
The insidious thing, of course, is that it may not be that particular program
causing the problem. For example, Internet Explorer may lock up tight when-
ever you visit a certain Web page, but it may be a Web plug-in that’s causing
29
Chapter 3: Telling a Hardware Problem from a Software Problem

the thing to crash — very nasty, but at least you have properly identified the
problem as software and not as hardware.
Some good questions to ask yourself
To help determine whether you have a software problem or a hardware prob-
lem, consider asking yourself some basic questions:
 Have you installed any new hardware recently?
 Have you installed any new software recently?
Remember that computers don’t like change. Change introduces new ele-
ments into the mix. Sometimes, something works without a hitch. But, if
you have a busy computer — one with lots of software installed and many
peripherals — adding something new may be that final pebble in the gears
that grinds your PC to a halt.
 Adding something new introduces the it-was-working-yesterday 
syndrome.
 The reason for the popularity of such utilities as System Restore in
Windows XP and Norton GoBack is that they effectively uninstall new
hardware and software and restore your computer to the state it was in
when it last worked best.
 See Chapter 4 for more information on using the System Restore utility.
 Remember that adding new hardware also adds new software. Most
hardware requires device drivers in order to work. This explains why it’s
tough sometimes to determine whether it’s the hardware that doesn’t
work or whether it’s just the software not cooperating.
30
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 
Another unfortunate software problem: Viruses
A sad fact of computing is that some software
programs are specifically designed to do nasty
things to your computer. Called viruses or
worms, they can arrive piggyback on a simple
e-mail message and open like a mushroom
cloud, to distribute havoc and chaos every-
where in your computer system.
The best way to fight viruses is with antivirus
software. Windows isn’t supplied with any
antivirus software, so you have to pick up 
a third-party product. I recommend Norton
AntiVirus because it’s simple to use and easy to
install. It’s available at most software stores or
over the Internet.
See Chapter 24 for more information on fight-
ing viruses as well as other nasty Internet 
problems.

Hardware Things to Check 
When You Smell Trouble
The first things to check when you suspect hardware trouble are the connec-
tions, cables, and whatnot that link all the various pieces and parts of your PC:
 Is everything properly plugged in and receiving power? (Are the power
strip on-off switches in the On position, for example?)
 Are cables snuggly plugged into their sockets?
 Are cables snuggly plugged into the proper sockets? (The mouse and
keyboard ports look identical on every PC, but there is a difference!)
 Are both ends of the cable connected?
I could relate a story from my old computer consulting days: Once upon a
time, I made $60 in two minutes by plugging a modem’s phone cord into a
phone jack in the wall. The business wasn’t happy paying my fee, but the
people there learned an expensive lesson.
Listen!
Is the computer making noise? All computers have internal fans designed to
regulate the temperature inside the box. If the fan goes, the computer gets
too hot and fails.
Do you hear the fan? Poke your head around the back to see whether the fan
is spinning, just to be sure. If not, you have hardware trouble.
 Not all PCs have a fan. The Apple iMac computers come without a fan. 
I know that some older microcomputers and laptops come without inter-
nal fans. I suppose that a PC here or there could be without a fan, so if
you know of one, please don’t write in to tell me that I’m wrong.
 Some PCs can get hot even with the fan spinning. For such systems, you
can get fan “upgrades” by adding a second fan to the PC’s case.
 Laptops have internal fans, but they still run notoriously hot. To help
keep your laptop cool, consider an external cooling pad. The pad con-
tains several fans, and you set your laptop atop the thing. The result is a
cooler-running and much happier laptop.
 Sometimes, the fan is integrated into the power supply. In that case, you
need to buy a new power supply to replace the fan.
31
Chapter 3: Telling a Hardware Problem from a Software Problem

 If you have to wait for the power supply to arrive in the mail, but still
need to use the computer, you can operate it without the case’s lid, as
shown in Figure 3-1. See how I have used a little fan to help keep the PC’s
innards cool? I don’t recommend this solution for the long term.
Touch!
Is the computer hot? Electronics do get hot, but they’re designed to dissipate
the heat. Heat is a Bad Thing for electronics. It causes errors. In fact, your
computer manual probably has a “recommended operating temperature”
guide somewhere — maybe even on the console’s back panel.
 If the computer is hot, turn it off. Get it fixed.
 Also check a peripheral’s power brick to see whether it gets too hot.
Power bricks (more properly, transformers) do get warm, but should
never be hot. If they’re hot, they’re broken and need to be replaced.
 Heat also refers to the room temperature. Generally speaking, the hotter
the room, the more likely the computer is to malfunction. If it’s hotter
than 80 degrees where your computer sits, turn the thing off.

To do a quick check of the monitor, first ensure that it’s properly connected
and turned on: A monitor plugs into both a power source and the computer.
A CRT, or “glass,” monitor plugs directly into a socket. LCD monitors typically
plug into a power brick (transformer) and then into the wall socket.
The monitor may look dead, but the brightness may just be turned down all
the way. Fiddle with the knobs to try to get a reaction.
Modern monitors are quite smart. If yours doesn’t receive a signal from the
computer, it displays a message telling you so. It says “No input” or “No
signal” or something cryptic and obtuse, but conveys the general meaning of
“I’m not connected to anything sending me a signal.”
Some monitors have more than one input. My Mitsubishi monitor has an A-B
switch for viewing output from more than one source. Some high-end moni-
tors have both VGA and BNC connectors for the signal, plus corresponding
buttons on the panel to choose either one.
 It’s quite common for the power light on a monitor to turn green when
the monitor is up and running. When the monitor isn’t receiving a signal,
the light turns yellow or flashes.
 The light also turns yellow when the computer is in Sleep, Stand By, or
Hibernate mode.
Speaking of which, tap the Ctrl or Enter key on the keyboard to see
whether the computer is just sleeping and has shut down the monitor.
 On some computers, you have to punch the Power/Sleep button to wake
it up.
 If you still have your hearing, most CRT (glass) monitors make a high-
pitched whistle, to indicate that they’re on. The top of the CRT monitor
is also warm to the touch.
Other hardware tricks to try
This book is full of hardware tricks and tests you can use to determine
whether your problem is hardware or software. See the proper chapter in
Part II for more information on specific pieces of hardware.

Chapter 3: Telling a Hardware Problem from a Software Problem

Using Software to Check 
for Hardware Problems
Don’t you hate it when you install some game or new piece of software in
the computer and you invariably get this question: “Which type of graphics
system does this computer have?” I feel like shouting at the program, “Hey!
You’re in there! Why don’t you just look around and find out!?”
It’s quite possible to use software to test the computer’s hardware. Smart
software knows where to poke around and what kind of responses are
expected. If something is amiss, software can generally report it. After all,
why not make the computer do the work. Isn’t that what it’s for?
The Device Manager
Windows comes with a handy tool called the Device Manager, which you
can use to detect any hardware errors that are bugging Windows. You see,
despite its lousy reputation, Windows is quite tolerant of sloppy hardware.
Many claim that it’s a fault of Windows — and it may be, but that’s not my
point: Checking with the Device Manager generally confirms that you have a
hardware problem.
To display the Device Manager’s window, heed these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel.
You may find a link to the Control Panel from the Start button’s menu.
2. Open the System Properties icon.
3. Click the Hardware tab.
4. Click the Device Manager button.
The Device Manager is shown in Figure 3-2.
In Figure 3-2, you see the telltale sign that something is wrong with the com-
puter: The display adapter (graphics card) in this computer isn’t working
properly. The circle (which is yellow) flags any misbehaving hardware right
there in the Device Manager window. Further examination shows that the dis-
play adapter needs a new driver.
So, is it a hardware or software problem? Officially, it’s software because the
Device Manager recommends getting a new driver. It seems like a hardware
problem because the hardware isn’t being recognized, so the device is being
ignored by Windows. But it’s really a software issue.
34
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

 See Chapter 24 for more information on how to use the Device Manager.
 You can find information on how to reinstall a device driver (software) in
the various chapters of Part II that deal with specific devices (video and
sound, for example).
Diagnostic tools
In addition to the Device Manager (see the preceding section), you can use
software diagnostic tools to determine the status of just about any hard-
ware component in your system. So, when you suspect trouble, you can run
the diagnostic program to determine whether your hardware is operating
properly.
Because these tools are a hardware thing, they generally come with the hard-
ware itself and are not a part of Windows. To find the tools, look for the bonus
disks that came with your computer when it was new. Otherwise, you can find
the disks with the hardware device inside the box it came in.
For example, my network card’s diagnostic program came on the floppy disk
that accompanied the network card. Figure 3-3 shows the Diagnostic tool in
use. Certain video cards also come with diagnostic and troubleshooting tools.
You must look for them!
Figure 3-2:
The Device
Manager

misbehav-
ing doodad.
35
Chapter 3: Telling a Hardware Problem from a Software Problem

The PC itself may have a diagnostic tool in its Setup program, the program
that’s run when the computer first starts. A message appears, such as “Press
the <F2> key to enter Setup.” (The key to press could be any key. Commonly,
the Delete key or F1 is also used.) Inside the Setup program, you may find a
diagnostic tool you can use to test all the PC’s components.
 One thing you cannot test for in most PCs is the RAM. Programs must
run in RAM, so a diagnostic program that tests RAM is a questionable
thing in the first place. How can the program test memory if the program
must reside in memory to begin with?
 Computers with failing RAM are generally a total mess anyway. It’s best
to have your dealer or the manufacturer test your PC’s RAM; it has the
proper equipment to give your computer’s memory a good once-over.
 Diagnostic programs were all the rage in the early 1990s — not that
anyone needed them suddenly; it was just one of those computer crazes.
(And, it’s probably why the TV show Star Trek: The Next Generation used
the word diagnostic more than any other computer term of the day.)
 You can get two types of diagnostic programs. One is only a report 
program. It simply reports what hardware resources you have in your
computer. The program doesn’t test anything. The other type of diag-
nostic program tests your hardware and reports the results.
 It’s funny how the word diagnostic tends to lose its meaning the more
you say it.

In This Chapter

T
his chapter is brought to you by the letter R. Many happy words begin
with R, like recovery. And rescue. Good words like repair and restore. How
about refund, rejoice, and recreation? Really!
I don’t know why most of the handy tools and helpful troubleshooting tricks
are associated with R words. In fact, it didn’t dawn on me until I finished writ-
ing this chapter. (Its original title was “Escape from Doom and Peril with
These Fine Utilities,” which is a good title, but not as catchy.) After writing
about Restore, Reinstall, Recycle, and Recover, I just couldn’t help myself.
Enough recess! Remember your resolve! Read on!
Restoring from the Recycle Bin
To ease the panic that sets in when you can’t find a file, you need to do two
things: First, use the Find or Search command to try to locate the file (this
topic is covered in Chapter 9); second, check the Recycle Bin to see whether
the file was accidentally deleted:

1. Open the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop.
2. Choose View➪Details.
These steps display the Recycle Bin window, similar to what’s shown in
Figure 4-1. Information about the deleted files appears in four columns: name,
location, date, and size. Those labels help you quickly locate files you have
deleted, as covered in this section.
 The Search command in Windows, the one you would normally use to
locate lost files, doesn’t look in the Recycle Bin. Keep that in mind!
 To recover a deleted file, click it and choose File➪Restore from the
menu.
 To recover more than one file, press the Ctrl key and hold it down as you
click the files you want to restore.
 You must restore a file to its original location, the folder from which it
was deleted. If you need to move the file to a better location, do so after
restoring it. (Make a note of the location to where the file is restored.)
 You cannot restore files that were deleted using the Shift+Delete key-
stroke. Those files cannot be recovered by using any of the tools in
Windows. (Various third-party tools, such as Norton Utilities, may be
able to recover these files.)
 Rubbish is yet another R word, underused by Americans but right at
home in the commonwealth.

Restoring a file you deleted recently
To find a file that you suspect was just deleted, click the Date Deleted head-
ing in the Recycle Bin window (refer to Figure 4-1). When the triangle next to
Date Deleted points down, the most recently deleted files appear at the top of
the list: Scroll to the top of the list and pluck out the files you want recovered.
Restoring a deleted file when you 
know its name
To locate a file by name, click the Name heading in the Recycle Bin window.
That sorts the files alphabetically by name, either from A to Z or from Z to A,
depending on how many times you click the Name heading.
To quickly scroll to a given filename, type its first letter on the keyboard. To
find all files beginning with N, for example, press the N key.
Restoring a deleted file when you know
which application created it (by file type)
Searching for files by type allows you to locate a file when you don’t know its
name but you do remember which program created it. To do so, click the
Type heading in the Recycle Bin window to sort the files by their file type 
(or by which program created them).
39
Chapter 4: The “R” Chapter (Reinstall, Restore, Recycle, Recovery)
Showing more columns in the Recycle Bin
For some reason, I don’t feel that pretty icons
show me enough information when it comes to
the serious issue of restoring a file. That’s one
reason I prefer Details view for the Recycle Bin
(refer to Figure 4-1). If you want even more infor-
mation displayed about the dormant files, you
will be pleased to know that the number of
columns displayed, and therefore the informa-
tion about each file, is adjustable.
To see more columns in the Recycle Bin
window, such as the Type column, choose
View➪Choose Details from the menu. In the
Choose Details dialog box, put a check mark
next to the columns you want to view in the
Recycle Bin window. You can scroll through the
list to see the variety of information that’s avail-
able. (Obviously, checking every item would
make the window quite wide.)
Click OK to when you’re done with your 
selections.

Using System Restore
The System Restore utility in Windows is an excellent way to recover from
just about any mishap, but specifically it works best for those it-was-working-
yesterday situations. With System Restore, you can turn back the clock on
your entire computer system — yes, back to the good old days when things
were working normally.
Knowing when to set restore points
The System Restore utility lets you take your computer back in time only by
setting various restore points. Windows sets them automatically as you use
your computer. More importantly, you should set them yourself before you
make any extensive changes to the system.
For example, set a restore point before you add or upgrade any hardware or
software. Set a restore point before you mess with any Windows settings —
graphics, sounds, or wallpaper. Set one before you modify your Internet or
network settings or when editing the Start menu, rearranging files, uninstalling
programs — before doing just about anything other than getting your work
done, set a restore point. You will thank yourself later.
Setting a restore point
Never rely on Windows to automatically set a restore point for you. To do the
job manually, heed these steps:
1. Start System Restore.
From the Start menu, choose Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪
System Restore.
If System Restore doesn’t start up, it’s either disabled or you have
another problem with your computer. See Chapter 21 for information
on troubleshooting System Restore.
The System Restore display is rather dry and dull, so I’m not putting an
illustration of it in here. Yet.
2. Choose the option labeled Create a Restore Point.
3. Click the Next button.
4. Enter a restore point description.
The restore point description appears when you later use System
Restore. Therefore, it helps to be descriptive here.
40
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

Good restore point descriptions are “Installing new Zip drive,” “Changing
resolution for new monitor,” “System acting funny,” and anything that
may remind you in the future of what the problem could be.
Bad restore point descriptions are “Installing” and “Stuff” and “Chad is
singing again, and if I pretend I’m busy doing something on the computer,
perhaps he will go away.”
5. Click the Create button.
The new restore point is created, and the current day, date, and time
appear on the screen. Nifty.
6. Click the Close button.
You’re done. System Restore closes its window and sneaks off.
Now you can proceed to mess with your system or add a new gizmo or appli-
cation. Those are the times when the system may not behave as you have
expected. Not to worry! You have the safety net of a recent restore point,
which you can bring the system back to if things don’t work as expected.
 Don’t neglect using the restore point description! It’s valuable informa-
tion that may come in handy later if something goofs up.
 Windows attempts to create automatic restore points as long as you
leave the system on for a length of time. I leave my computers on
24 hours a day, so I notice restore points created just about every day,
typically around midnight.
 Windows may not, however, create restore points if System Restore is
disabled or has been disabled by a computer virus. See Chapter 21 for
information on what to do in that case.
Restoring the system
When things don’t go as planned or your PC suffers from it-was-working-
yesterday syndrome, you can attempt a system restore. (My first advice
is to restart Windows, which is covered in Chapter 2, and then do a System
Restore.)
Follow these steps to restore your system:
1. Close any open windows or programs, to safely save any unsaved
information.
Restoring the system restarts the computer, so it’s best to close and
save now before you begin the restore process. See Chapter 21 for a
nifty tip on shutting down programs.
41
Chapter 4: The “R” Chapter (Reinstall, Restore, Recycle, Recovery)

2. Start System Restore.
From the Start menu, choose Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪
System Restore.
If there is a problem or System Restore doesn’t start, see Chapter 21
for help.
3. Choose the option labeled Restore My Computer to an Earlier Time.
4. Click the Next button.
5. Pick the date you want to take the computer back to.
If you have set a specific restore point, choose the date where you set
that restore point.
If more than one restore point is set on a date, as shown in Figure 4-2,
choose it from the list.
Sometimes, System Restore may fail if you choose a restore point too far
in the past. In that case, consider selecting more recent restore points
and working your way back to restore the system to an earlier date.
6. Click the Next button.
Read the scary warning. The bottom line is that the System Restore
process is fully reversible, so if System Restore makes things worse,
you can undo its changes.
7. Click the Next button.
Windows restores, restarts, and. . . .
Hopefully, things wind up just fine, and the kinks are worked out of the
system. After the system restarts, a screen eventually appears and tells
you “Restoration Complete,” with a summary of what happened.
8. Click the OK button.
I have suggested this operation to many of my readers with computer prob-
lems, and most of the time it meets with tremendous success. If not, further
troubleshooting is needed. In fact, if System Restore doesn’t fix the problem,
it’s most likely a hardware problem that needs further attention (replacement,
for example).
Undoing a System Restore
If the System Restore operation fails to address the issue or you just would
rather have not performed the operation in the first place, you can undo the
changes: Start System Restore and on the first screen select the option Undo
My Last Restoration. Click the Next button and continue through the steps to
undo whatever it was that System Restore had done.

Restoring Files from a Backup
Backing up a hard drive used to be a required (though bothersome) necessity
for anyone using a computer. In the early days, hard drives were not only
expensive, but they were also often unreliable. Backing up your data ensured
that a safety copy existed.
Backup is more of a lost art now. I bemoan this topic even more in Chapter 25.
See that chapter if you want to hear my caterwauling about why people don’t
back up.
Of course, if you do back up, you have the benefit of owning that second,
safety copy of your stuff. It means that you can restore files or even your
entire system from the backup copy.
Information in this section describes how to restore files from a backup. This
information is based on the Windows backup program, though it’s loosely
similar to all backup programs.
 Backing up is the process of creating a duplicate of the information on
your computer’s hard drive. The backup itself is the copy. See Chapter 25
for more detailed information.
Figure 4-2:
Choose the
restore
point here.
43
Chapter 4: The “R” Chapter (Reinstall, Restore, Recycle, Recovery)

 Tools such as System Restore would be completely unnecessary now if
more people made backups of their hard drives.
 For the restore operation to work, you must have a recent backup handy.
Restoring a single file, folder, or folders
If you can’t find a particular file or have lost it or permanently deleted it, you
can always recover it from a recent backup. Follow these (general) steps:
1. Start the Backup program.
To start Backup in Windows, click the Start button and choose Programs➪
Accessories➪System Tools➪Backup. If you’re using another backup 
program, start it in whatever manner necessary.
2. Enter Restore mode.
In Backup, you first must click the Next button in the Backup or Restore
Wizard. Then, on the next screen, you choose the item labeled Restore
Files and Settings. Click the Next button to continue.
In other backup programs, you may have to click the Restore tab or
switch to whichever part of the program deals with restoring files from
the backup archive. In some cases, you may even need to start a sepa-
rate Restore program, run separately from the main backup program.
3. Select the backup media or location.
Backing up can be done to a second hard drive, flash media drive, a disk
drive on the network, Zip disk, CD-R or CD-RW disc, or any type of remov-
able disk. This step involves not only inserting that media into the drive
(or device) but also telling the backup program where to look for it.
For Windows Backup, a list of recent backups is displayed in the What to
Restore window.
4. Choose the backup set.
Often, multiple backups are stored on a single disk. This step involves
choosing the most recent backup from which you will restore files.
In Figure 4-3, the Windows Backup program shows the most recent
backup sets. The last one is chosen from the list.
5. Browse to find the files or folders you want to restore.
An optional step in some backup programs is to pick and choose which
files you want to restore. For example, you may have deleted only one
file, in which case you need to restore only one file. The restore opera-
tion should let you choose which specific files you can restore.
In cases of dire disaster, all files are restored.
44
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

In Figure 4-4, you see how the Backup program in Windows is manipu-
lated to select only one file for restoring: Folders are shown in the left
window, files on the right. Files or folders to be restored have a check
mark by them. In Figure 4-4, only the file named CLEAR.C is selected for
restoring.
6. Review the summary.
As the Backup program prepares to read the backup media and restore
the file, there are still a few options you may consider. One is whether to
restore the backup files to their original locations. Doing so overwrites
any files of the same name already at those locations, so you must be
careful.
Figure 4-4:
Plucking out
a single file
to restore.
Figure 4-3:
Choosing 
a recent

45
Chapter 4: The “R” Chapter (Reinstall, Restore, Recycle, Recovery)

In Windows Backup, if you elect to restore files to a new location, click
the Advanced button in the Backup or Restore Wizard. By doing so,
you’re pelted with an array of options for restoring the file. Otherwise
the file is restored in the manner described in the wizard’s window.
7. Complete the operation.
Perform whatever deed necessary to make the restore take place: Click
the Start or Go or Restore button.
If the files are stored across several disks, you’re asked to replace disks
as the restore operation continues.
And you’re done.
I would say that of all the utilities I have ever used on any computer, the
restore half of Backup is the most satisfying. It’s not enough knowing that you
have the backup copy. It’s a great feeling when you actually get to restore a
file and recover something that you thought was lost forever.
Be careful about overwriting existing files when you restore a folder! Make
sure that you really want to restore the entire folder and all its contents
before you choose a Replace All option. (You cannot recover any file that
has been overwritten.)
Restoring an application
Alas, it’s fairly difficult to pluck out a single application from a backup disk
set. Applications in Windows don’t really install themselves in a specific
place. Therefore, trying to locate all the bits and pieces of a program that
may be scattered all over a hard drive is a questionable operation.
Rather than restore an application, just reinstall it. See the section
“Reinstalling applications,” later in this chapter.
Restoring the entire hard drive
When disaster strikes, you can use your backup disks to restore your entire
hard drive — for example, if your computer is infected with one of those
nasty, nonremovable viruses. Or, suppose that your 12-year-old “computer
genius” cousin decides to “optimize” your Windows folder. It’s those severe
times that call for a full hard drive restore operation.
Restoring a full hard drive involves these steps:
46
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

1. Create special boot disks to reinstall the operating system, or disks you
can use to run the backup program and restore files.
2. Reformat the hard drive (often included with Step 1).
3. Boot with the special boot disks to restore files from the backup to the
hard drive. Or, reinstall the operating system and then the backup pro-
gram to restore the hard drive.
4. Restore from any partial or incremental backups since the last full hard
drive backup.
Those steps are not only scary, they’re also time-consuming! That is why I
don’t recommend such an operation for silly things. Unfortunately, most of
the tech-support people working today recommend the reformat-restore
operation like it’s routine. It’s not.
 Most backup programs come with a special boot disk, or they let you
create your own disk, so that you can start the computer, run the pro-
gram, and restore files when the hard drive may be utterly corrupted.
 Windows Backup program doesn’t need a special restore disk. Just rein-
stall Windows onto the new hard drive and then use the Backup program
to restore the backup files from your backup disks.
 Most PCs now come with a boot image, or Restore, CD, which you can
boot on the computer to reinstall the system the way it appeared when
you first bought the computer. Just stick the CD into the drive and restart
the computer. If you’re presented with the option to start from the CD,
do so. That restores the entire system. After that point, you can reinstall
your backup program and then restore the rest of your computer system
from the backup disks.
 If your computer didn’t come with restore disks, contact the manufac-
turer to find out what to do in the event of total disk disaster.
Reinstalling Stuff
Sometimes, the solution to a problem is as easy as reinstalling software. You
just find the original copy or distribution disks or CDs, pop ’em in the com-
puter, and reinstall. Problem fixed (most of the time).
 A special instance where reinstalling isn’t what I recommend is for
your computer’s operating system, Windows. Too often, “reinstalling
Windows” is presented as a solution by lazy tech-support people —
especially when a better, less-time consuming, and less-destructive
option is available. (Reinstalling Windows is one of my pet peeves,
which I bemoan throughout this book.)
47
Chapter 4: The “R” Chapter (Reinstall, Restore, Recycle, Recovery)

 Another thing to reinstall is a device driver. That’s the software used by
Windows to control a piece of hardware. Because reinstalling a device
driver is specific to the hardware you’re troubleshooting, that information
is located elsewhere in this book. Use the index to locate the hardware
for which you need a new device driver.
Reinstalling applications
Consider reinstalling an application for any of the following reasons:
 The application is behaving in a manner inconsistent with the way it
once behaved.
 All the files “owned” by that application are now owned by something
else, something you don’t want them to be owned by.
 Files belonging to the application were deleted so that the application
no longer runs or displays error messages as it starts.
 The application was accidentally uninstalled.
 The application was infected with a virus.
 The application develops a longing to tour the world’s beaches and find
“the perfect wave.”
There may be more reasons as well. In my experience, I have had to reinstall
only two programs. One was a graphics program that apparently didn’t like
another graphics program I later installed. Reinstalling the first program fixed
the incompatibilities. The second instance was an older program that no
longer worked, but somehow reinstalling it fixed things up nicely.
To reinstall your application, simply insert the Install or Setup disk in the
proper drive. Go ahead and install the program over itself; you rarely need to
remove or uninstall the original from the hard drive. (Only if the Setup pro-
gram tells you that the original needs to be removed do you need to do so.)
 Generally speaking, consider visiting the Web page for the application’s
developer. Check for a FAQ list or any tech support you can find online
that maybe has a specific solution to your problem.
 The support Web page for all Microsoft products is http://support.
microsoft.com.

Bringing back bits of Windows
For problems involving Windows applets (Calculator, Paint, and FreeCell, for
example), the solution is often to uninstall and then reinstall the program.
This isn’t as common as it once was, but it often clears up small, annoying
problems that may happen with those common Windows programs.
The first step to reinstall a Windows applet is to uninstall it. Follow these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel’s Add/Remove Programs icon.
An Add/Remove Programs dialog box appears.
In the Windows XP category view, click the Add or Remove Programs
link to open the Add/Remove Programs dialog box.
2. Click the Add/Remove Windows Components button on the left side
of the window.
Please wait. The Windows Components Wizard appears.
3. Choose the main category from the scrolling list.
You find most applets in the Accessories and Utilities category.
4. Click the Details button.
This step displays whatever group of programs is held inside a category.
The Accessories and Utilities category contains both the Accessories
and Games categories. (It’s funny that no Utility category is in there.)
5. When you finally get down to the bottom level, locate on the list the
program you want to uninstall.
6. Remove the check mark by that program, as shown in Figure 4-5.
This step selects the program for removal.
Figure 4-5:
Uninstalling

applet.
49
Chapter 4: The “R” Chapter (Reinstall, Restore, Recycle, Recovery)

7. Click OK to close the various dialog boxes until you return to the
main Add/Remove Programs dialog box. Then click OK to close it.
8. Restart Windows.
This step is optional, though it does officially remove the previously
installed files. If you don’t restart Windows, they may still be on the
hard drive. Better not chance it: Restart Windows (refer to Chapter 2
for details).
After restarting your computer, you reinstall the program, to give
Windows a fresh — and, hopefully, better-running — copy. Now, you
need to reinstall the program you just removed. Continue.
9. Repeat Steps 1 and 2.
You want to be in the Windows Components Wizard.
10. Repeat the steps you just took to remove the applet (Steps 3 through 6),
and this time add the applet back in (reinstall).
11. Click OK to close the various sub-dialog boxes.
12. Click OK to close the Add/Remove Programs Properties dialog box.
Windows may ask for the CD-ROM to be inserted so that it can reinstall
the programs. If your computer came with Windows preinstalled, the
files are found on the hard drive.
After reinstalling, the program should work just fine. At least, that has been
my experience.
 If Windows is unable to locate the files, try looking for them in the
Windows\Options\CABS folder on Drive C.
 Uninstalling unused programs is another way to conserve hard drive
space. This topic is covered in Chapter 23.

The Windows XP Recovery Console
The final R for this chapter stands for Recovery;
specifically, a tool called the Windows Recovery
Console. Sadly, the Recovery Console isn’t for
everyone. It’s a command-line utility, ugly like
the days of DOS. In fact, you may never use it;
instead, it might be your guru or a tech-support
person who wrestles with the thing. For this
reason, I have hidden information about the
Recover Console near this book’s rump, in

hen you buy a computer, purchase software, or sign some type of

work as expected and to fix things when stuff invariably breaks. It’s a good
thing; worth the extra expense.
Alas, the quality of technical support has dwindled over the past several
years. It has grown expensive and often intolerant, especially of the needs
of beginners. Although you find good support departments here and there,
technical support for consumer computers is rapidly getting a reputation as
bad as the computer manuals of days gone by.
This chapter shows you the ups and downs of technical support and why you
should use it only as a last resort.
 In the computer biz, there’s a difference between technical support and
customer service. Customer service deals with sales, sale support, prod-
uct questions before purchase, and product return. Technical support is
where you go when you have questions or problems with a product.
Know the difference before you make the call!
 Looking for proper service and support is the fourth of five steps to take
when you’re buying a computer. See my book Buying a Computer For
Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.) for more information.

When to Use Tech Support
This advice is simple: Use tech support as a last resort, if at all.
 Most problems are easily “fixable” without having to call support.
 Use this book to help you troubleshoot many of the common computer
foibles that everyone experiences.
 Technical support is also available for any peripheral or add-on hard-
ware you may buy. In that case, call the manufacturer, as listed in your
manual or on your invoice.
 Above all, you paid for support when you bought the product. They owe
it to you. If you can fix it yourself, great. But don’t feel guilty about call-
ing support when you need it.
Boring tech-support history 
that you don’t have to read
In the old days, technical support was purely technical. By that, I mean that
the only people who would call tech support were technicians themselves,
the office computer guru, a programmer, or a hacker. They knew computers.
And, the folks giving the technical support were typically the software pro-
grammers or product engineers themselves. They knew the answers, and,
more importantly, the people calling knew the right questions to ask. The
system worked rather well.
As computers became more of a consumer commodity, tech support 
changed to accommodate more beginners. In fact, the folks at the old DOS
WordPerfect toll-free tech-support line told me that the most common phone
call they received was by someone who hadn’t yet taken the product out of
the box. Sure, those people needed help, and in those days the WordPerfect
folks were willing to help them. (Sadly, the bean counters eventually took
over, and WordPerfect had to cut back on its technical support.)
Computer companies now have to justify having technical support. The toll-
free numbers are almost gone. Free support has dried up except for the first
90 days. After that, you have to pay a flat-rate toll, a per-call fee, or a per-
minute fee. Even then, paying the fee doesn’t guarantee that your problem
gets solved or even that you don’t have to wait on hold.
52
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

Before you call tech support
Using a computer is a tough thing. These beasts are not simple. Anything can
and does go wrong. The tech-support people know this, and they brace them-
selves for anything. They have to! Callers range from the timid beginner who
still has the computer in the box to the hacker whose computer has been
utterly disassembled and desoldered. You can make the tech-support person’s
job easier by doing a little research before you call. Follow my suggestions:
Find out who owns the problem. Narrow things down. Is it hardware or soft-
ware? That way, you can call the proper place. Refer to Chapter 3 for more on
making this determination.
Try as many solutions yourself as possible. Use this book to help you 
troubleshoot as much as possible. Tech-support people are blown away if
you have already looked in the Device Manager or worked in the System
Configuration Utility. They may have you look there again — if so, be patient.
(They’re typically following a script and must check things off before taking
you to the next level.)
53
Chapter 5: Your Last Resort: Tech Support
Yes, there’s a time limit
Technical support is often “farmed out” to busi-
nesses other than the original manufacturer or
developer. So, although you may think that
you’re calling the software developer, hardware
manufacturer, or online service, you really end
up being connected to some other company,
one that specializes in handling technical 
support.
For the most part, the people answering the
tech-support phones are knowledgeable about
the product and capable of solving the prob-
lems. Unfortunately, because they base their
business on the number of calls answered per
hour (or per shift), their financial goal is beating
the clock, as opposed to really solving your
problem.
The average amount of time a typical tech-
support person has to deal with your problem is
12 minutes, more or less. After that, he’s under
tremendous pressure to “dump” you. I have
experienced this situation too often myself. And,
my readers have related to me the disappoint-
ing results of being dumped: After 12 minutes,
the person simply says “Reinstall Windows” or
“Reformat the hard drive” and then hangs up.
Most definitely, that is not the solution to your
problem. It’s the solution to his problem, which
is to get rid of you before the 12 minutes are up.
When you phone tech support, keep an eye on
the clock. If you have spent more than 12 min-
utes and no solution is working or the tech-
support person suggests reinstalling Windows
or reformatting the hard drive, you should
protest. Ask to speak to a supervisor. Often, the
supervisors aren’t under the same time limita-
tions as the grunts who have to answer the
phones. That should lead to an answer.

Determine whether the problem is repeatable. Be prepared to demonstrate
to tech support that the bug isn’t random and can be reproduced. I did this
once, and the tech-support guy was amazed when the same foul-up happened
on his computer.
Be prepared to give information, and lots of it. Do your homework before
you call. This book tells you many places to look for solving problems. Go
through those steps and gather as much information as possible. You don’t
have to spill it all at once to the tech-support person, but have it ready for
when you’re asked.
Finally, it pays to know which number to call. This is something I find frus-
trating: The tech-support number is typically hidden somewhere in the
manual. Sometimes, it’s right up front or in a tech-support index. But most
often it’s in a not-so-obvious place.
 When you find the tech-support phone number, flag it! Highlight it.
Better still, write it in the front of the manual. Add it to your Address
Book. You can even spray-paint it on the wall.
 See Chapter 24 for more information on the Device Manager and the
System Configuration Utility (MSCONFIG).
Finding your version of Windows
One important thing to relate to tech support is which version of Windows
you have. It also helps to know the version of any application or utility that
you figure is causing the problem.
To find out the Windows version, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
The General tab in the System Properties dialog box lists all the infor-
mation about Windows that you need to know, as shown in Figure 5-1.
Beneath the System heading are listed the Windows version (or release)
and then, below that, the edition and then the specific version.
In Figure 5-1, the computer is running Windows XP, Professional Edition,
Version 2002, Service Pack 2.
3. Close the System Properties dialog box.
You don’t have to cough up all the information displayed on the General tab
in the System Properties dialog box. Offer only what they ask for. For exam-
ple, don’t spew off the serial number unless they request it.
54
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

Finding the version number 
in an application program
Windows may not be the problem. It may be some other program you run. In
that case, you may need to tell the tech-support person which version of that
program you’re running. This information is not the same thing as the version
number for Windows; each piece of software has its own version number.
To find out the version of any specific application, choose the Help➪About
command. (The About command is usually followed by the program’s name.)
That command displays a dialog box with the program’s full name, release,
and version information — and maybe even a quick button to click for con-
necting to tech support.
Making the call
Phone them up. Wait on hold. Listen to the silly music.
Be prepared to talk to a screener before you get true tech support. Sometimes,
an initial person breaks in and gets your name, phone number, customer ID,
and serial or registration number, and a description of the problem before
you speak with a live tech.
Do some doodling in the Paint program while you wait.

55
Chapter 5: Your Last Resort: Tech Support

When the techie answers, calmly and politely explain the problem. Then,
follow the instructions as best you can. Don’t bother saying “But I already
tried this.” Just follow along and, hopefully, your problem will be solved.
 For some reason, when you opt to pay for tech support, it happens
sooner and faster than when it’s “free” support.
 Keep an eye on the clock. Do this for two reasons. First, if you’re paying
for the call, you probably want to check the time you spend waiting on
hold. Second, after the call starts, you need to keep an eye out for the
12-minute period to elapse and then see whether tech support is giving
you the brush-off. (See the sidebar “Yes, there’s a time limit,” earlier in
this chapter.)
Tech Support on the Web 
(Better than You Think)
As long as your problem isn’t with the Internet in the first place, you can find
some excellent tech support freely available on the Web. Most software
developers and hardware manufacturers have support areas on their Web
sites. There, you can review common questions and answers, troubleshoot
products, e-mail questions, or download new software solutions. In fact, it’s
only after checking the Web that I bother calling tech support by phone.
Finding the manufacturer’s Web site
After discovering whether the problem is hardware or software, your next
step is to find a Web site to seek out technical support. Sometimes, this part
is easy: Choose Help➪About or Help➪Support from the menu, and often the
developer’s Web page is listed right there. Neat-o.
For hardware manufacturers, the problem is a bit rougher. First, if the hard-
ware came with your computer, contact the computer manufacturer (the
computer manufacturer commonly lists contact information in the System
Properties dialog box):
1. Right-click the My Computer icon.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
The System Properties dialog box dangles open.
3. If necessary, click the General tab.
4. Click the Support button.
A dialog box is displayed that lists tech-support and contact information.
56
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

If this trick doesn’t work, you have to hunt down the hardware manufacturer
by using a search engine, like Google:
http://www.google.com/
Just type the manufacturer’s name into the text box and click the Search
button on the Google main page. Somewhere within the results is the page
you’re looking for.
When you get to the manufacturer’s page, look for a technical-support link.
Then, you can begin the process of searching for the information you need.
 You should also use these steps for finding support information for any
extra hardware you buy for your computer. If the tech-support Web page
isn’t listed in the manual, use the Internet to search for the Web page.
 Be sure to use as few words as possible when you search for information
on the Internet. Be direct: “S3 graphics driver upgrade” or “missing
icon,” for example.
 Another tip: If you search broadly at first, check to see whether any
options can refine your search or “search within results.” For example, if
the search results on the tech-support Web page yield 400 answers, con-
sider searching through those answers for something more specific to
your situation.
 If you bought your computer locally, just phone the dealer for support.
This is one case where it’s easier to call and bug them than to use a Web
page. But, for manufacturers, going to the Web page is easier by far.
 Also check on the manufacturer’s Web page for an FAQ — Frequently
Asked Questions — list.
Using the Microsoft Knowledge Base
Microsoft has perhaps the most extensive and exhaustive troubleshooting
database on the Internet. They call it the Microsoft Knowledge Base, and it’s
similar to information the Microsoft tech-support people use when you
phone them (and pay) for an answer.
Visit the Knowledge Base by typing this address:
http://support.microsoft.com/
Type a brief, punchy question or problem description; for example, “Windows
shutdown” or “Missing toolbar.” Click the button, and soon a list of potential
solutions appears, perhaps one of which will save your butt.
57
Chapter 5: Your Last Resort: Tech Support

 Definitely, definitely, most definitely use the Microsoft Knowledge Base
first, before phoning up Microsoft.
 Much of the information in the Knowledge Base is a rehash from what
you find in the Windows help system. To use the help system in
Windows, choose Help and Support from the Start button’s menu.
 Note that some problems have multiple solutions. Each one is for a differ-
ent system configuration, so try to match your computer’s configuration
to the best possible solution.
 It helps to know Microsoft-ese when you’re typing questions for the
Knowledge Base. For example, you may use the word hang, but the
Knowledge Base uses the word freeze. Be sure to try another, similar
word if your initial search yields no results.
Downloading a new driver
Occasionally, your Internet search ends with the task of installing new soft-
ware to make things work right. For example, to fix that CD-ROM glitch, you
may need new software — a driver. To get rid of a printer problem or to make
your printer happy with other software, you may need a new printer driver.
Whatever the reason, your task is to download and install new software.
Here’s my advice for getting that done:
 Bookmark the Web page! Press the Ctrl+D key combination to add the
Web page to your Favorites list. You do this just in case things go wrong
and you need to return.
 Print any instructions for installing the new software. In Internet
Explorer, choose File➪Print to print the current Web page.
 When you have found the software you need, you click a link so that the
software can be sent to you online (downloaded). A Save As dialog box
appears. In that dialog box, choose a memorable location for the file. 
I use a folder named Downloads, which is created in the main My
Documents folder.
 If the download fails or Windows tells you that it’s “corrupted,” you have
to try again. If the file is still corrupted after the second download, con-
tact the developer and tell someone there that something is wrong with
the file.
 Drivers control hardware, so, to learn more about installing specific dri-
vers, see the index in this book for the hardware in question. Instructions
for installing or updating drivers are included throughout this book.
 Drivers should be free. I have found only one Web site where they
wanted to charge me for a new driver — and for hardware I already
owned. I immediately tossed out the hardware and bought something
58
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

else. I wrote a letter to the hardware manufacturer’s president — not
that it did any good. Don’t be suckered into paying for a driver or soft-
ware upgrade.
Windows XP and Remote Assistance
I have answered technical and troubleshooting questions from my readers for
more than a dozen years now. The biggest hurdle in trying to help someone is
not being able to see what that person sees on the screen.
For example, someone may write, “The buttons are wrong; they’re all over
the screen.” After two or three exchanges of e-mail, I discovered that the
reader’s taskbar was on the top edge of the screen, not on the bottom. Now,
had I been standing right there looking at the screen, it would have been a
click and a swipe of the mouse to fix things. But, via e-mail, it took four or five
messages to get things right.
Being there is a big part of getting proper tech support. To help out, Windows
XP has a feature named Remote Assistance. By using Remote Assistance, you
can allow anyone on the Internet who also has Windows XP to take control of
your computer and see what you see on the screen. That makes it a heck of a
lot easier to fix things, as this section demonstrates.
 I recommend using this feature only if you really, really trust the person
who’s looking at your computer. If so, you may find a ready solution for
some of your PC’s problems.
 Remote assistance isn’t worth diddly squat if your computer cannot
connect to the Internet.
 Speaking of the Internet, the faster the connection, the more effective
remote assistance is. I have done it with 56K modems at about 49 Kbps
true speed, and it was tolerable, but not ideal.
 Sadly, the Remote Assistance feature isn’t available on Windows 98 or
Windows Me.
Setting up your system 
for remote assistance
Before asking for remote assistance, ensure that this option is turned on.
After all, you can’t let anyone else in when your computer lacks a door for
someone to walk through. Follow these steps to ensure that Remote
Assistance is activated:
59
Chapter 5: Your Last Resort: Tech Support

1. Open the Control Panel.
You can get to this window from the Start button’s menu, or from any
Windows Explorer or folder window’s Address bar drop-down list.
2. Double-click to open the System icon.
3. Click the Remote tab in the System Properties dialog box.
4. Click to put a check mark by the item labeled Allow Remote
Assistance Invitations to Be Sent from This Computer.
5. Click the OK button.
The System Properties dialog box bows out.
Your PC is now set up for remote assistance.
You can also disable the Remote Assistance feature by repeating these steps
and removing the check mark. I recommend doing this after you get remote
help, to keep your computer secure.
Getting someone to help you
Obviously, you don’t want just anyone barging into your PC to give you “assis-
tance.” The person must be properly invited. Follow these general steps:
1. Get on the Internet.
You gotta be on the Internet for this to work; connect to the Internet as
you normally do.
2. Find someone to help you!
Ideally, the person must be another Windows XP user signed up for the
Windows Messenger program. That way, the operation works smoothly
on both ends (and that’s the only configuration I have tested).
Phone that person up and tell her to get online and to connect to the
Windows Messenger program. Then, she needs to wait while you set
things up on your end.
3. Summon the Help and Support Center.
You can choose Help and Support from the Start menu or press the
Win+F1 key combination.
On the right side of the Help and Support Center window, you see the
heading Ask for Assistance.
4. Click the link to invite or ask a friend for help (the exact text may vary).
A special, Remote Assistance screen opens.
If you’re warned that your computer isn’t set up for remote assistance,
refer to the preceding section for information on setting things up.
60
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

5. Pick your pal out of the Windows Messenger list.
The person should appear on the list, per your instructions from Step 1.
This is the easiest way to get help from someone. You can try sending
him an e-mail message, but things just work better when both of you are
online and connected with Windows Messenger.
6. Invite the person to help.
A message is sent to your pal, who is fortunately already connected, per
Step 1. The pal has to accept the invitation, in which case you see a
Waiting for a Connection dialog box.
Eventually, you’re asked whether you want the person to view your
screen and chat with you. Click the Yes button, or take whatever step
necessary to invite that person to help.
The Remote Assistance dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-2. This
is your control panel for granting the person access to your computer.
It’s also where you can chat while you’re connected.
On the other system, the person is receiving a snapshot of what your
screen looks like.
The person may chat with you via the chat window and have you do
things, which she can see on her computer. Or, she may opt to control
your computer for herself, in which case she can move your mouse and
type things. If so, you see the dialog box shown in Figure 5-3.

7. Click the Yes button to allow the other person to control your 
computer.
You can cancel what the other person is doing at any time by pressing
the Esc button on your keyboard.
Hopefully, everything goes well and she fixes your problem without dis-
covering where you hide the filthy pictures on your computer.
8. When you’re done, click the Disconnect button in the Remote
Assistance dialog box.
9. Close any windows you may have opened.
Hopefully, whatever problems you have had were solved by the nice Remote
Assistance person.
 If you have Windows XP, you probably have already signed up for your
.NET (“dot-net”), Passport, and Windows Messenger accounts.
 No one can get into your computer unless you invite him.
 You can cancel the connection at any time by clicking the Disconnect
button or pressing the Esc key.
 If you don’t want the person to meddle with certain areas of your hard
drive, such as your personal finance folder, let him know ahead of time.
 Yes! It’s slow over plain modems! It’s very slow, but workable.
Performing remote assistance 
on another system
To help out another Windows user, start by arranging the Remote Assistance
session. The person should let you know when you need to be online and
ready to help. Follow these steps:
Figure 5-3:
Allowing 
the other
person to
control your

62
Part I: What the @#$%&*!? 

1. Connect to the Internet.
2. Start up the Windows Messenger.
The person contacts you via the Windows Messenger program. You have
other ways to contact people, such as by sending them e-mail and so
forth, but it’s much easier if you’re already in Windows Messenger.
3. Wait for the invite to appear on the screen.
It appears like any other pop-up message in Windows Messenger.
4. When the invitation appears, click it.
A Conversation (chat) window appears, similar to the one shown in
Figure 5-4. But, unlike in a normal chat window, you find an invitation to
help the other person via remote assistance.
5. Click Accept.
The connection is made to the other computer, and the Remote
Assistance window appears, which details what the other person sees
on his screen, as shown in Figure 5-5.
At this point, you can type in the Chat History window (on the left side
of the window in Figure 5-5) and tell the other person to do things. What
he sees on his screen shows up in the window so that you can see what’s
going on.

Click the Actual Size button to see the image clearly; otherwise, the
Scale to Window option squishes everything to fit in the Remote
Assistance window.
6. To take over the other computer, click the Take Control button.
This step allows you to use your mouse and keyboard to manipulate the
other computer. The results are displayed in the Remote Assistance
window. Note that the person has to say Yes to the Take Control ques-
tion before you can take over.
7. Press the Esc key when you’re done controlling the computer.
8. Click the Disconnect button to break the connection when you’re
done troubleshooting.
Be sure to close any other windows that may be left open.
Again, the idea here isn’t to mess with the computer, but rather to see what
he sees. In fact, it’s often better to tell the person what to do and then watch
the results than try to work a mouse over a slow modem connection.

In this part . . .
F
ace it: Even at times of brutal desperation, human
beings are essentially lazy. It’s nothing to feel guilty
about, and nothing worth “getting over.” It’s just one of
those random and ugly facts about people. For example,
only in the movies does the good guy go back and rescue
his stumbling girlfriend when the monster is chasing
them. In real life, the guy runs to the shelter and bends
over all red-faced, panting and wheezing. Then, only after
someone hands him a cold beer does he wonder, “Hey!
Where’s Linda?”
Why experience the solution when you can just look it 
up instead? It’s human nature to prefer the ready-made
solution. After all, so many computer problems are
common or similar enough that someone somewhere
must have had the same thing happen to them. Then, all
you need to do is look up that answer and get on with
your life. That’s the function of the chapters in this part of
the book. They’re organized into problem areas, scenar-
ios, or specific hardware or software. Look up a common
question. Get an answer. Get on with your life.

t’s difficult to find any computer glitch that doesn’t fall under the category

favorite annoying PC or Windows problems plus their solutions. Obviously, 
I couldn’t list everything that bugs you with your computer; there aren’t
enough trees in the world to produce the paper needed to print that particu-
lar book.
 Yes, even though a particular problem may be on your personal This
Just Bugs Me list, it may not be in this chapter.
 See the index or use the table of contents to discover in which chapter
the problem and solution lie.
Funny Startup Noises
Oh, those startup noises just make me laugh!
Well, no, not really. I suppose that I should say peculiar or unexpected noises
as opposed to funny noises. No, if the computer made funny noises, the trou-
bleshooting process would be far more entertaining.

Officially, the computer makes only the following noises when it starts 
(I leave it up to you to determine whether you think they’re funny):
 The fan inside the computer case whirs to life and makes a soft, warbling
drone. The fan (and sometimes you have more than one) is responsible
for keeping the console’s components cool.
 The hard drive spins up to speed, which makes a high-pitched humming
sound that few people over 40 can hear.
 The computer beeps once as it comes to life. The single beep means that
everything is okay. It’s like the computer gets all excited and — golly,
gee! — if this were an MGM musical from the 1940s, the computer would
burst into song and have a big dance number with all the other office
equipment. But, no: It’s just a beep. That’s the best Mr. PC can do.
The computer could make additional noises, funny or no:
 The monitor may honk when it comes to life. Especially for larger CTR
(glass, not LCD) monitors, you may hear a loud honking noise. Actually,
it’s more of an “UNK” noise than a car horn tootling. This is normal.
 CRT monitors generally make a high-pitched whistling sound. Again, if
you’re over 40, there’s no point in trying to hear it.
 The printer may hum a few bars of “Oink-grunt-oink” as it comes to life.
 Zip drives, as well as other external disk drives, honk and whir when
they’re first initialized.
 The scanner may also power up and play “Clink, grindily grind.”
That’s pretty much it for the early-morning computer cacophony. You’re most
likely familiar with all these noises and note that something’s wrong when a
noise goes missing or a new noise gets introduced.
 No, sadly, wearing earplugs merely masks the symptoms. It doesn’t solve
any noise-related problems.
 See Chapter 10 for information on troubleshooting sound problems
other than startup sounds.
In the presence of unwanted noises
Noise problems are invariably hardware related, especially at startup. New
noises generally indicate a problem with whichever device seems to be
making the noise. Alas, these problems must be fixed by your dealer or the
computer manufacturer. Especially if the computer is still under warranty,
avoid a homebrew solution.
68
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

 If the computer beeps more than once, the beeps indicate a problem
with the computer’s startup electronics. This problem must be fixed by
your dealer or the manufacturer. Tell them what the beep pattern was:
several short beeps or long-short beeps, for example.
 Beeps may also sound off after you upgrade some hardware. That’s
simply the computer’s acknowledgement that its basic configuration has
changed. The extra beeps are typically accompanied by a text message
on the screen explaining that new hardware has been found (or some-
thing like that).
 Hard drives can get louder over time. That means that their bearings are
giving out. Of course, the real question is when will they give out. A hard
drive in one of my systems was loud for an hour after I turned the com-
puter on, but then it got quiet. So the problem could be intermittent. See
Part III of this book for more disk drive information.
 Spinning parts in the computer can be affected by the weather. If it’s an
especially cold morning and the furnace hasn’t quite heated up your
office, the hard drives may peal an especially annoying squeak on
startup. This squeak should go away when things heat up.
 A squealing monitor needs to be fixed by a professional. Or replaced. Or
told that squealing doesn’t work and that it has to find another, more
polite way to ask for assistance.
 You can replace a pinging fan yourself, if you’re good with electronics.
In some cases, however, replacing the fan involves replacing the entire
power supply, which can be done by anyone handy with a screwdriver
or who has ever set up a backyard barbecue. Even so, if the system is
still under warranty, have the dealer or manufacturer fix it.
 Here’s another good way to repair a noisy fan: Clean it! Unplug your
computer and open its case. Then, take a vacuum and suck out all the
dirt, hair, and byte-bunnies that accumulate in all PCs. Ensure that you
also clean the vents that the fan blows air through.
 Never open or try to repair a PC’s power supply or the monitor. Despite
whatever noises they make, these items cannot be fixed by mere 
mortals.
In the presence of unwelcome silence
Whether the computer makes too much noise or no noise at all, it’s still a
hardware problem, one most effectively repaired by your computer dealer or
manufacturer. Worse, a missing sound typically means a dead something-or-
other inside your computer. Pee-yew! So, the unwelcome silence is followed
by more error messages and trouble. Take the thing in and get it fixed.

Chapter 6: “This Just Bugs Me!”

 Some computers don’t beep when they first start up. Other computers
may beep only if they’re connected to speakers.
 One day, the sound stopped entirely in my old IBM PC. I heard no beep
at startup and no music when I played my favorite game. The next time 
I opened the case, I discovered the problem. I was living in a rather
decrepit apartment in El Cajon, California, and a mouse family (the
rodent type) had moved into my computer and built a cozy nest atop
the warm hard drive. The speaker apparently bothered them, so they 
ate the speaker’s cardboard cone. I solved the problem by replacing the
speaker and then moving to another apartment complex.
The Display Is Stuck in “Dumb” Mode
I believe dumb mode to be the lowest possible resolution on a modern com-
puter monitor: 640 by 480 pixels. This mode renders everything on the display
very large, and it doesn’t give you much screen real estate to get any work
done. Obviously, it’s a problem that needs fixing.
 Dumb mode may also be caused by your computer entering Safe mode
when it starts up. Not only does Windows alert you when Safe mode first
starts, but you also see the words Safe Mode appear in the four corners
of the screen.
 See Chapter 24 for more information on Safe mode.
 Yes, I am aware that even lower graphic resolutions are available 
(320 by 160, for example). The 640-by-480 resolution is the lowest
mode supported by Windows. So there.
Checking the screen resolution
Before jumping to any conclusions, see whether you can fix the resolution
the way the manual says to (if there were a manual):
1. Right-click the desktop.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
This step summons the Display Properties dialog box, which you can
also get to via the Control Panel.
3. Click the Settings tab.
In the bottom of the dialog box, you find a slider gizmo, used to change
the resolution from Less to More. Figure 6-1 gives you an idea of what’s
where.
70
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

4. Adjust the resolution higher.
Grab the slider gizmo and try moving it to the right. The resolution dis-
played below the gizmo tells you the potential screen resolution. The
preview window gives you an idea of how the new setting affects the 
display.
If nothing works, you need a new display driver. See the next section.
5. Click the Apply button to test the new setting.
Unlike the OK button, the Apply button lets you preview your changes
without closing the Display Properties dialog box.
If you don’t like the new settings or they don’t seem to work, return the
resolution to its old setting.
6. Click the OK button.
This step locks in the new resolution and banishes the Display
Properties dialog box.
In the long list of who-does-what in Windows, you are the one in charge of
screen resolution. You can pick and choose whichever resolutions the
Display Properties dialog box lets you. No program, not even Windows itself,
can change that resolution to something else. After you have made a setting,
it sticks that way.
The only time the resolution changes is if a problem occurs with the display
driver or, occasionally, if some games change the resolution and then don’t
change it back after you close them. (That’s becoming less of a problem, 
however.)
Figure 6-1:
Setting the

71
Chapter 6: “This Just Bugs Me!”

 More is not always better. If you set the resolution too high, you may
lose the number of colors available.
 Higher resolutions also tend to flicker more and cause eyestrain. Only
the highest-speed, high-memory graphics adapters can handle the
higher resolutions. If you’re in doubt, don’t set the resolution to higher
than 1024-by-768.
 LCD monitors are optimized to handle specific resolutions, such as 
800-by-600 or 1024-by-768 or whatever else the manual recommends.
Trying other resolutions yields butt-ugly results.
Updating your graphics device driver
Dumb mode is often caused by Windows losing track of your PC’s graphics
device driver. How can the computer lose something like that? I don’t know.
But I do know that human beings are far more capable than computers and
they often lose important things like eyeglasses or car keys. Anyway.
Without a specific driver, Windows uses what’s known as the standard VGA
driver, which gives you only 640-by-480 boring and dumb pixels to play 
with — not enough.
Fortunately, although Windows has lost track of the video driver, the driver
most likely still exists on your computer. The solution is to go to your graph-
ics adapter’s Properties dialog box and reinstall the existing driver software.
You can do that in two ways.
First, you can do a System Restore to reinstall the video driver: Go back in
time to when you remember the display working properly. It could be yester-
day or last Friday or whenever you last used your computer. Refer to the
Chapter 4 discussion on using System Restore.
Second, and whenever System Restore doesn’t work, you can follow these
steps to manually replace the computer’s graphics device driver:
1. Right-click the desktop.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
This step displays the Display Properties dialog box. You can also
see this dialog box by opening the Display icon in the Control Panel.
(Right-clicking the desktop is quicker.)
3. Click the Settings tab.
This is gloriously illustrated in Figure 6-1. Gaze upon its beauty.
4. Click the Advanced button.
A rather technical-looking dialog box appears, which is to be expected
because the button was (after all) labeled Advanced.
72
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

5. Click the Adapter tab.
The true power behind your computer’s graphics is the graphics adapter
hardware, not the monitor. The Adapter tab lists information about the
graphics hardware installed inside your computer.
6. Click the Properties button.
Deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole. . . .
7. Click the Driver tab inside your graphics adapter’s Properties
dialog box.
Though each graphics adapter’s Properties dialog box is different, each
one has a Driver tab, similar to what you see in Figure 6-2.
8. Click the Update Driver button.
This step starts a wizard, which looks for a better driver than the silly
one you’re using now.
9. Obey the wizard!
Follow each step the wizard offers, by clicking the Next button after
each step.
The wizard may ask to search the Windows Update service. If so, ensure
that your computer is on the Internet or ready to be connected. Note
that this step isn’t necessary if you’re merely reinstalling the graphics
driver already on your computer.
Figure 6-2:
Install or
update the
video driver
here.
73
Chapter 6: “This Just Bugs Me!”

The wizard attempts to locate a better driver for your graphics adapter.
Chances are, for this particular problem, that Windows will find the
driver already on your computer. If so, use that driver, and everything
will be fine.
10. Take whatever steps are necessary to finish installing the driver.
This step may include finding the original Windows CDs or the CDs that
came with your computer or graphics adapter that contain drivers. It
may also involve restarting your computer.
In some cases, Windows may not be able to find a better driver. If so, 
consider visiting the Web page for the graphics adapter or the computer
manufacturer to see whether you can find and download a newer or better
device driver.
 If your computer has two display adapters, it’s a guessing game to deter-
mine which one is the one that requires a new driver. My advice: Update
them both.
 If the display is still in dumb mode after you restart Windows, visit the
Display Properties dialog box to see whether you can then change the
resolution to something higher (refer to the preceding section).
Annoying Programs in the System Tray/
Notification Area
One of the most vexing issues that vexes even the most vexless PC user
seems to be those ugly little booger icons in the system tray, or what
Windows XP calls the system notification area, shown in Figure 6-3. Whatever.
It’s littered with teensy icons collecting like dust bunnies under the sofa.
Although many people seem to tolerate the miscellaneous miscreants, a few
downright can’t stand the boogers and want to stomp them out of existence.
If that’s you, heed the advice given in this section.
System tray/Notification area
Chevron thing
Figure 6-3:

74
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

 The system tray/notification area is on the far right end of the taskbar,
and the taskbar sits on the bottom of the screen.
 In Windows XP, the icons in the system tray/notification area are hidden
if they’re not used. The chevron-thing button (refer to Figure 6-3) can be
clicked to show all the icons.
 The term notification area is new with Windows XP. Before that, the area
was referred to as the system tray. I use both terms.
“So what the heck are those icons,
anyway?”
Each icon appearing in the system tray or notification area represents some
program running in Windows — usually, a utility or some other “background”
operation or process. The icon offers you a way to check that program’s
progress or to get quick access to its settings or more information. And that
sounds really nice.
In real life, however, the system tray/notification area has become an elec-
tronic hippie commune for any old random icon that wanders by. After seeing
about ten or so icons there, I begin to think “What the heck is this?” It’s from
that thought that the urge to purge grows into an obsession.
Required icons for the system tray/
notification area
What do you need to have in the system tray/notification area? Nothing.
There’s no requirement, and if you’re crafty enough, you can eliminate all
icons from that area. (A blank box remains, but that’s it.)
Killing off teensy icons in the 
system tray/notification area
Apparently, word got to Microsoft that the system tray was bugging people,
so Windows XP contains a handy, built-in trick for manually hiding all the
icons and system tray/notification area detritus. Here’s what to do:
1. Right-click the mouse in the notification area.
Don’t click an icon in the notification area — click in the notification area
proper. If this step confuses you, just click the time shown in the notifi-
cation area.
75
Chapter 6: “This Just Bugs Me!”

2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
If you don’t see the Properties command, you have clicked an icon and
not in the notification area proper.
If you’re successful, you see the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties
dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-4.
3. Ensure that the Taskbar tab is up front in the Taskbar and Start Menu
Properties dialog box.
Refer to Figure 6-4. The bottom part of the dialog box deals with the noti-
fication area.

Beware of utilities to help you manage 
system tray icons
When I present the answers to system tray/
notification area icon problems in my free
weekly newsletter, a few people respond that
tools are available to help manage the icons.
Beware of these tools! I have tried a couple,
and I was not happy with the results.
One such utility interfered with the way some of
my programs operated, which forced me to
delete the utility in order to restore my sanity.
Another program merely hid the system tray,
which wasn’t a good solution.
My advice: Try my techniques described in 
this chapter before you resort to some other
solution.

4. If you don’t want the clock to be displayed, uncheck the box by the
option labeled Show the Clock.
5. Click the Customize button.
The Customize Notifications dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-5.
This box is where you can permanently hide any or all of the icons.
6. To hide an icon, click to select it.
This step displays a drop-down list in the Behavior column, as shown in
Figure 6-5 (to the right of the CleanSweep Internet Sweep item, first on
the list).
7. From the drop-down list, choose the option labeled Always Hide.
8. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 for all icons on the list that you want hidden.
9. When you’re done playing Easter Egg Hunt with the icons, click the
OK button.
10. Click OK again to close the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties
dialog box.
Note that even with everything hidden, the notification area doesn’t vanish
completely. The chevron-thing (the Hide/Show arrow) on the left lip of the
notification area still appears, which allows you to see the icons. But at least
they’re not “on stage” all the time.

Sleep Mode Poops Out, Hibernate 
Poops Out, We All Poop Out Now
Problems with Sleep mode (also known as Stand By) as well as Hibernation
all stem from the same root: your computer’s power-management system.
That’s a set of electronics that controls the computer’s special low-power
and power-saving modes of operation. For some reason, this hardware and
software causes many PC users grief beyond despair.
The PC can’t recover from Sleep mode
Some computers go to sleep and never wake up. The problem was so bad
with Windows 95 that I recommended not using Sleep mode! But, since then,
things have gotten better. Still, there are times when the computer just can’t
seem to wake up from Stand By mode. Rather than thump the computer on
the head, there are a few things to try.
First, if your computer is a laptop, ensure that the battery light as well as the
“moon” light are lit. These indicate that the computer has power and that it’s
still in Sleep mode, respectively. When either button is out, the laptop’s bat-
tery has drained and, well, there’s your problem! Plug the laptop into the
wall, and you can use it again.
Second, determine whether this is a one-time event. Turn off the computer
(refer to Chapter 2). When the computer comes on again, let it sit until Stand
By mode comes back on. Then, see whether the same thing happens and the
computer cannot revive itself. If so, see the section “Fixing the power-
management software,” a little later in this chapter.
If the problem with Stand By is a one-time thing, what happened, most likely,
is that some program kicked the bucket during the sleep process. The problem
is with that one program, not with Stand By mode itself or your computer’s
power-management hardware. (And, it’s tough to determine which program
walked the green mile, so just let it be.)
Third, when all else fails, just avoid using Stand By mode or just use Stand By
on the computer’s monitor instead. Leave the system and its hard drives on,
but after a given interval, have the computer shut off the monitor for you.
“The Hibernation button is missing!”
This problem happens so often that I believe there’s a Hibernation button
convention somewhere and all the buttons leave their computers to attend it.
Some thoughts:
78
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

 Hibernation is not available on every computer.
 Even when the Hibernation option is available, it must be enabled. This
is done by using the Power Options icon in the Control Panel. Click the
Hibernate tab and then put a check mark by the option labeled Enable
Hibernation. Click OK to activate hibernation on your computer.
 The Hibernation option is not visible in the standard Turn Off Computer
dialog box. To see it, you must press and hold the Shift key. By doing
so, the Stand By button relabels itself to Hibernate. Then, you must
click that button — all while pressing the Shift key — to get hibernation
to work.
When the Hibernation button is missing, please review the preceding three
points. Chances are that the second or third point is the solution you’re look-
ing for. Otherwise, keep reading in the next subsection to find out how you
can update your computer’s power management software.
Fixing the power-management software
Oddly enough, the power-management hardware in your computer isn’t 
controlled from the Control Panel’s Power Options icon. Nope, instead, you
must use the Device Manager to locate your computer’s power-management
hardware, from which you can reinstall the driver that controls things. This
process is tough, but it’s often the necessary step you must take to fix your
PC’s power-management troubles. Obey these steps:
1. Go visit the Control Panel.
You can get there from the Start button’s menu.
2. Open the System icon.
The System Properties dialog box appears.
3. Click the Hardware tab.
4. Click the Device Manager button.
The Device Manager window appears, as shown in Figure 6-6.
5. Open the item named System Devices.
It’s toward the bottom of the list.
6. Look for the power-management or ACPI item.
This is the tricky part; your PC’s power-management system is uniquely
named, so you have to search for it. In Figure 6-6, it’s named VIA Tech
Power Management Controller, though on most PCs it’s named Microsoft
ACPI-Compliant System. Regardless, the icon should have either Power
Management or ACPI by its name.
79
Chapter 6: “This Just Bugs Me!”

7. Open the power-management item to display its Properties dialog box.
8. Click the Driver tab in the Properties dialog box.
9. Click the Update Driver button.
10. Obey the wizard to select a new driver.
Follow the instructions on the screen. If you need to connect to the
Internet to visit the Windows Update site, do so.
11. Click the Next button to work your way through the wizard, and
answer questions as you go.
12. When the process is complete, restart your computer as indicated or
follow whatever directions are given by the wizard.
Close any windows or dialog boxes that you have left hanging open.
Reinstalling the software should fix your power-management issues. If not,
my next best advice is to visit your computer manufacturer or dealer’s Web
site and look for any updates or new software there. Only when nothing new
can be found would I consider phoning up tech support for a solution. When
you need to do that, refer to Chapter 5 in this book beforehand.
Oh, That Annoying Logon Dialog Box!
Must you log in to Windows? I’m afraid that the answer is “Yes” pretty much
all the time. Sorry!
Figure 6-6:
The lovely

80
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

I once recommended removing or bypassing the Logon screen. In fact, if
you’re the only one using Windows XP and your account lacks a password,
the Logon screen just doesn’t appear. But, leaving your computer open that
way is a major security risk, and I don’t advise it.
The future of computing is password protected. You’re better off getting used
to entering passwords now than having to get into that habit later.
You Can’t Open a File, or the 
Open With Fiasco
Some files were not meant to be opened. They’re data files or support pro-
grams for other things you do on your computer. There’s nothing wrong with
poking around and trying to double-click every file you find. It’s just that you
had better be prepared to reset if anything new and wacky happens to your
PC while you’re poking around.
When you attempt to open an unknown file, you get the “I cannot open this
file” dialog box, as shown in Figure 6-7. What do you do in this situation?
Easy: Click the Cancel button.
Sure, you could have Windows venture out to the wilds of the Internet and
search for whatever. Windows may find a program to open the file, so if you’re
curious, take a look. I have never done this myself. I either give up or, if some-
one e-mailed me the file, ask that person to send me the file again in a format
my computer can read.
You definitely don’t want to select a program from the list. If the icon can’t be
opened now, it can’t be opened then either.
Figure 6-7:
Windows
XP is at 
a loss.
81
Chapter 6: “This Just Bugs Me!”

One handy trick to try in this situation is to right-click the file’s icon rather than
try to open it. When you do, you can access the Open With submenu, which can
be handy for peering into the contents of some file types. Here’s what you do:
1. Right-click an icon.
2. Choose the Open With submenu.
The submenu displays a list of programs qualified to open the icon.
Or, you can choose the Choose Program command to view a list of appli-
cations and select one to try to open the file.
This trick not only lets you specify which program to use for opening known
files, but it also lets you experiment with opening unknown files without
utterly lousing up your system.
Try opening unknown files by using the Notepad program. Notepad is
designed to display pure text, so, for some text-based icons, it works very
well. But, when all you see is gunk in Notepad, the file most likely needs to
be opened by some other program.
82
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
Common file formats your computer can read
Most of the time, I hear about file-opening pro-
grams because of strange e-mail attachments
or files downloaded from the Internet. If you
can’t open a file, do what I do: Request that the
person resend the file in a format your computer
can read. Here are some of those common for-
mats that just about any PC can read:
DOC: Generally, this is a “Document” file for-
mation, though specifically most files ending
with DOC are Microsoft Word files. Because
Word is the most popular word processing pro-
gram, many documents are saved and traded in
this file format. (You can also open DOC files in
the WordPad application.)
GIF: This common graphics file format can 
be viewed by the Paint program or Internet
Explorer.
HTML: These documents are Web pages, which
can be read by Internet Explorer. Just about any
major application can save its documents in
HTML format.
JPG: This is another common graphics file
format.
PDF: This is the Adobe Acrobat file format. The
P stands for Portable, which implies that you
can read a PDF file on any computer. (DF is
Document Format.) If your computer doesn’t
have the Adobe Acrobat Reader program, you
can get it free at www.adobe.com/reader.
RTF: Using the rich text format for documents,
any word processor can read these documents,
which makes RTF even more common than
HTML.
TXT: With plain-text documents, nothing gets
simpler.

That Wicked File Is Read-Only
Read-only is one of a handful of file attributes that can be applied to a file. In
this case, the read-only attribute tells Windows that the file can be opened,
examined, printed, and copied, but cannot be changed in any way — look,
but don’t touch, like the snake pit at the zoo.
Read-only files happen for two reasons. First, they’re created that way. For
example, any file on a CD-ROM disk is read-only, which it inherits from the
read-only aspect of the CD-ROM drive (where the RO in ROM means Read
Only). Second, you can change a file’s read-only attribute at any time by using
the file’s Properties dialog box. That is also how you remove the Read-Only
attribute from a file and restore it to normal.
Follow these steps:
1. Right-click the file’s icon.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. Remove the check mark by the attribute labeled Read-Only.
See Figure 6-8, which shows the file’s Properties dialog box for Windows
XP, though it’s similar to the older versions of Windows.
4. Click OK.
The file is restored to non-read-only status.
Figure 6-8:
A file’s
Properties
dialog box.
83
Chapter 6: “This Just Bugs Me!”

Keep in mind that the read-only status may be set on a file for a reason. It’s
one of the few ways you can protect a file in Windows.
Full-Screen DOS Prompt
If you ever find yourself facing a computer that’s showing an ugly text 
screen — not beautiful, graphical Windows — you have stumbled into
The World of DOS. It’s text, man — text!
DOS screens don’t pop up as much as they used to. Still, it can happen. The
first thing to try is pressing the Ctrl+Enter key combination. This keyboard
command switches a DOS window from full screen to windowed mode, where
DOS just looks like any other window (but uglier). After you’re in windowed
mode, you can close the DOS prompt window like any other window.
 You must quit DOS programs before you can close the DOS window. If
not, a horrible error message appears and tells you just that. Even so,
if the window is something you need to close, click the Yes button to 
terminate the DOS program.
 You can use your keyboard to close any DOS window: At the DOS
prompt, type EXIT and press the Enter key.
 If you try pressing Alt+Enter and typing EXIT and nothing happens,
somehow the computer was started in DOS mode. In that case, simply
restart the computer; turn it off, wait, and then turn it on again.
 To restart the computer from the DOS prompt, press Ctrl+Alt+Delete 
(all three keys) simultaneously.
 If the computer appears stuck in DOS mode, type WIN and press the
Enter key to run Windows.
84
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
The Microsoft Word read-only bug
Microsoft Word has a bug in it (although
Microsoft doesn’t call it a bug, I do). When 
you open a document created by another 
word processor, Word automatically makes 
that document read-only. It does this to 
ensure that you don’t overwrite the original, 
non-Word document with a Word document. To
overcome this bug, simply change the name of
the document when you save it back to disk; use
the File➪Save As command and enter a new
name as well as a new file type for saving the
document.

85
Chapter 6: “This Just Bugs Me!”
“My computer always boots into DOS!”
Don’t despair if your computer always boots into
DOS. The problem can be fixed — well, unless
you have an old DOS computer that doesn’t
even load Windows. But, if you have Windows
98 or Windows Me, you can easily fix the boots-
into-DOS problem.
First, at the DOS prompt, type WIN to start
Windows. After you’re in Windows, run the
Notepad program. Choose File➪Open to display
the Open dialog box.
In the bottom of the Open dialog box, choose All
Files from the Files of Type drop-down list. Then,
in the File name box, type C:\MSDOS.SYS. Type
that command exactly as I have written it here:
C, colon, backslash, MSDOS, period, and SYS,
and then click the Open button. This command
opens a special boot file into Notepad.
In the file that appears on the screen, look for
the line that reads BootGUI=0. That line is in
the [Options] area. Change the 0 to a 1 so that it
reads BootGUI=1. That’s the command to start
Windows rather than DOS.
Choose File➪Save to save your change. Then
quit Notepad. Restart the computer, and it boots
into Windows rather than DOS.

othing makes you yearn for instant assistance like something unex-

computer is programmed to indiscriminately remember just about every-
thing you do. Remember that time you walked naked into the kitchen late at
night and your insomniac great-aunt was sitting there? So does the computer.
Well, maybe it’s not that bad. But, remember how handy it has been in the
past for the computer to recall a file you just opened or to remember a Web
page or someone you just sent e-mail to? That’s computer convenience! Alas,
the computer isn’t discriminating with the stuff it remembers. Sometimes,
places you didn’t really intend to visit can pop up again — just like your aunt
in the kitchen!
This chapter summarizes some of the many places where, well, “evidence”
can be found that you have been somewhere shameful. Remember that the
computer doesn’t judge intent; no, it merely keeps track of your wanderings.
If that concerns you, the tips and techniques presented in this chapter help
you eliminate any potential cause for embarrassment.
 This chapter covers how to remove remnants of places you have been

Deleting Recent Documents from the 
My Recent Documents Menu
The My Recent Documents submenu appears on the Start button’s menu and
lists all the files you have recently opened or viewed. Although this menu can
be handy for opening any files you have recently worked on, it’s also a severe
security risk.
Do you really want to have a list of recently opened documents available? If
you find yourself using the list, by all means, keep it. Otherwise, get rid of the
dumb thing and cover your tracks, by following these steps:
1. Right-click the Start button.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
This step displays the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties dialog box,
which you can also open through the Control Panel.
3. Ensure that the Start Menu tab is selected.

7. Click OK to close the Customize Start Menu button.
8. Click OK to close the Taskbar and Start Menu Properties dialog box.
Now you can check the Start menu, and the My Recent Documents menu
is gone.
And we all sing and dance a merry song of thanks.
Note that there’s a difference between the My Recent Documents menu and
the My Documents shortcut that may also appear on the Start menu. One is 
a shortcut to the My Documents folder. The other is a submenu that lists
recently open documents.
Historically Speaking
Wherever you go on the Web, Internet Explorer (IE) makes a note of it, like
some busybody neighbor or relative who must check up on you all the time.
Internet Explorer notes which Web sites you visit and which pages you look at.
At least it doesn’t nag you about wearing a sweater. . . .
Supposedly, all this checking is done to make it easier to retrace your steps if
you want to go back and visit someplace again. But it also serves as a trail of
bread crumbs that just about anyone can follow to see what it is you look at
on the Internet — obviously a potential source of embarrassment.
Clearing places from the history
To remove any Web site or specific Web page from the Internet Explorer his-
tory list, follow these steps:
1. Click the History button in Internet Explorer.
The history list appears on the left side of the browser window, as
shown in Figure 7-2. Web sites appear as folders. The pages you visit in
the site appear as Web page icons beneath the folder, as shown in the
figure.

2. Right-click any item you want to delete.
3. Choose Delete from the pop-up menu.
4. Click Yes in the warning dialog box if you’re asked to confirm.
And the offending entry is gone.
Alas, the entry still may appear on the Address drop-down list. If so, try using
the Clear List button, as described in the section “Deleting Recent Documents
from the My Recent Documents Menu,” earlier in this chapter.
 The Ctrl+H key combination can also be used to hide or show the history
list.
 The number of days the history list keeps track of is initially set to 20.
This value can be adjusted, as covered in the section “Disabling history
altogether,” just ahead in this chapter.
 Removing a history item isn’t the same thing as removing an Internet
cookie. For cookie information, see Chapter 18.
Clearing all the history
People who don’t read history are doomed to repeat it. And, why not? Let’s
just go and make those same mistakes over and over. It builds character, or
something like that.
Figure 7-2:
This history

dering past.

Chapter 7: “Gosh! This Is Embarrassing!”
When the entries on the history list appear to be overwhelming, consider
zapping them all:
1. Open the Control Panel’s Internet Options icon.
Or, from Internet Explorer, choose Tools➪Internet Options. This step 
displays the Internet Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-3. On the
General tab, you can control the history.
2. Click the Clear History button.
That removes everything.
Of course, if your spouse or computer partner is astute, they will have recog-
nized that you zapped the history list. If so, be honest: Just tell them that
things were in there that you would rather no one else see. Nothing wrong
with that — it happens to everyone.
Disabling history altogether
If the history list is a complete and utter bother, just get rid of it: On the
General tab in the Internet Options dialog box (refer to Figure 7-3), set the
Days to Keep Pages in History option to 0. Click OK.
Although this technique eliminates history tracking for previous days, note
that Internet Explorer still keeps track of the history today. So, if you have
been somewhere today and you don’t want anyone to know about it before
midnight, you still have to manually delete the entries, as covered in the sec-
tion “Clearing places from the history,” earlier in this chapter.

Undoing the AutoComplete Nightmare
Remember that really smart-but-annoying person you once worked with?
Whenever you started a sentence, he finished it for you. You would say “Let’s
go back to . . . .” and he would hurriedly say “The drawing board!” That saved
you excess thinking time and tongue energy molecules, but frustrated your
brain because you could never complete a sentence. I suppose that the fellow
believed he was being handy. Call the chap Otto: Otto Kompleet.
In Windows, the AutoComplete feature is one of those nifty utilities that
makes typing long, complex things — like Web page addresses — easier. What
Windows does is to keep track of the places you have been and the addresses
(and filenames) you have typed. When you start typing again, Windows auto-
matically completes the address for you, by guessing what it is you want to
type. Or, a drop-down list of alternative suggestions may appear.
Suppose that late one night Phil’s wife wants to visit Mary’s Boutique on the
Internet. She starts typing Marysbo, and suddenly the Address bar fills with
Mary’s Bondage and Discipline Dungeon. Oops! It’s time she had a talk
with Phil!
Yes, AutoComplete can also be a source of embarrassment. Fortunately, you
have several ways to deal with it, as covered in this section.
Turning off AutoComplete
When anything vexes you in Windows, the direct solution is usually to turn
it off. Why not? Such features should be optional. On my computers, I find
AutoComplete to be annoying; I’m startled when some other Web page
spelling or suggestion comes up. No problem. AutoComplete can be turned
off (or at least curtailed) by following these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel’s Internet Options icon.
2. Click the Content tab.
3. Click the AutoComplete button.
The AutoComplete Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-4.
Did you notice the two happy buttons labeled Clear?
4. To turn off AutoComplete, uncheck everything.
Click. Click. Click. Click.
5. Also click the Clear Forms and Clear Passwords buttons.
That removes anything stored in AutoComplete’s memory. In fact, you
can just perform this step (and Steps 7 and 8) to remove things stored in
AutoComplete’s memory.

Did you see the annoying message about the Clear History button? How
hard would it have been for Microsoft to add a second Clear History button
right there in the AutoComplete Settings dialog box? It was apparently
too hard, so you must exercise your mouse-clicking muscles.
6. Click OK.
7. Click the General tab.
8. Click the Clear History button.
Now, everything is gone from AutoComplete.
Theoretically, this technique should work. No previous addresses or other
information appear on the Address bar as you type. If something does, you
can see the next section for a more direct and drastic solution to the problem.
 Using AutoComplete for Web addresses means that Windows remem-
bers any address you have typed or the addresses of all Web pages you
have visited, which can be recalled as you type new addresses.
 Using AutoComplete for forms means that any Web forms you complete
that have similar fields (Name, E-mail Address, and Telephone, for exam-
ple) are also filled in automatically as you visit various Web pages.
 Of course, the Forms option also covers entering information in search
engines. If you have been searching for ladies’ undergarments in extra-
large gentlemen’s sizes, that too appears if the Forms item is checked.

Removing an MRU list
MRU is Microsoft-spiel for Most Recently Used. This concept is the root of the
drop-down list dilemma or the AutoComplete quandary. Those files or text
you type are kept in various MRU lists and stored in a very dark and dank —
and technical — place in Windows called the Registry.
Hopefully, the commands listed earlier in this chapter help you to get rid of
the things you don’t want on the various MRU lists. If not, you can venture
into the Registry and manually delete things on your own. It’s not that hard,
but it does take a certain amount of intestinal fortitude:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Choose Run.
The Run dialog box pops up.
You can quickly summon the Run dialog box by pressing the Win+R key
combination on your keyboard. (Win is the Windows key.)
3. Type REGEDIT in the Open text box.
4. Click OK.
The Registry Editor shows up on the screen, as pictured in Figure 7-5. It
looks — and works — like a Windows Explorer window. You open vari-
ous folders to display more folders and eventually display the entries in
the Registry itself.
Figure 7-5:
The Registry
Editor.
94
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

To remove MRU items, you need to know where they are. This process involves
being able to read a path to the MRU list and understanding which folders to
open to get there. For example, here’s the location where the addresses you
type in Internet Explorer are stored:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\
TypedURLs
Here’s how to get there:
1. Open the HKEY_CURRENT_USER folder.
2. Open the Software folder.
3. Open the Microsoft folder.
4. Open the Internet Explorer folder.
5. Open the TypedURLs folder.
Refer to the path again. Note how each item in the path represents a folder to
open. The folders are separated by backslash (\) characters. Now, look at the
screen. You see the list of recently typed URLs or Web page addresses or any-
thing you typed in the Address box. Figure 7-6 shows what it looks like on my
screen, though it’s a rather brief list because I just cleared my history.
To delete a specific entry, such as that offensive World Peace Web site, select
it and press the Delete key. (Click the “ab” icon to select an entry.) Click the
Yes button when you’re asked whether you’re sure that you want to delete
the value. You’re sure.

Table 7-1 lists a few other places in the Registry where you can find MRU
lists. You can use them to go pluck out specific files that may be offending
people — or stuff you just don’t want other folks to know about.
Note that it’s assumed that each location in Table 7-1 begins with HKEY_
CURRENT_USER\Software.

Recent File List
If you don’t see your application listed in Table 7-1 (and I don’t have the space
to list everything), use the Ctrl+F key combination to summon the Registry
Editor’s Find command. Search for a bit of text you have seen on the recently
used file list. For example, if you have just opened the file NAUGHTY.DOC, you
can search the Registry for that name. When you find it, you probably also find
the MRU list for that application. If so, you can delete the entry manually.
Be sure to close the Registry Editor when you’re done.
 Avoid the temptation to monkey with the Registry beyond my simple
words of advice offered in this book.
 No, I can’t recommend any other good book on the Windows Registry.
I get this question often via e-mail, including requests that I write a
Windows Registry book myself, but there really isn’t that much to the
Registry, and it can be a scary place if you’re not careful.
 Set a system restore point before you do any messing around in the
Registry (refer to Chapter 4).

Dealing with Nasty Wallpaper!
When you right-click an image on the Internet, you see on the pop-up menu
the option Set As Background (or something similar). It turns the image into
the desktop background, or wallpaper, which you can see when you use
Windows. Sometimes, this is an accident. It need not be a nasty image, but
whatever image it is, you probably want it off the desktop. Here’s how:
1. Right-click the desktop.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
This step conjures up the Display Properties dialog box, which you can
also get to through the Control Panel.
3. Click the Desktop tab.
The Desktop tab is what sets an image, pattern, or straight color to use
for the background or wallpaper. The current, offensive background
image is previewed in the dialog box, as shown in Figure 7-7.
4. Select a new background from the scrolling list.
Or, select None if you want a solid color.
5. Click the Apply button.
The background on the desktop changes, by removing the old image and
replacing it with a new one. That should fix the problem.
Figure 7-7:
Removing
an image
from the
desktop.

6. Click OK to close the Display Properties dialog box.
Generally speaking, these steps should fix whatever unwanted desktop images
you have. To permanently remove the image, find the file and delete it.
Hiding Something on the Screen
I’m sure this never happens to you: You’re looking at something diverse and
interesting on the computer when someone else walks into the room. Do you
panic? Do you freak out and yell at them? Or, do you quickly and stealthily
know how to hide the entire contents of the screen?
Hopefully, you know the trick to instantly hide everything on the screen: Press
the Win+M key combination, where Win is the Windows key. Win+M automati-
cally minimizes every open window and leaves only the desktop displayed.
 Alas, you have no Win+M key equivalent if your computer’s keyboard
lacks a Windows key.
 The mouse equivalent for this command is to right-click the taskbar and
choose Minimize All Windows from the pop-up menu. Alas, sometimes
that’s just too slow.
 Oh, you can always switch off the monitor, though that tends to arouse
suspicion.

I
t must take more oomph for a computer to get up in the morning than
any human would know about. Consider the computer’s electronic con-
temporaries: The television has no problem turning on. (Indeed, if there’s a
TV problem, it’s not turning the thing off!) The toaster? Starts right up. VCR
player? Works — sometimes even turns itself on when you shove in a tape.
But, the computer? It must be a Herculean effort — a full-on electronic brawl —
required to get the thing going.
The fact that the computer starts at all should be considered miraculous, espe-
cially considering the sheer number of things that go on in order to get the
beast up and running. There’s no reason for the delays, of course; because we
tolerate a lengthy startup time on our computers, there’s no rush for any man-
ufacturer to speed up the process. Yet, for some reason, the delay is always
long enough to build up some anxiety. Will the thing start? Why doesn’t it start?
And, what the heck does that message mean? All those issues are covered in
this chapter.
How the Computer Starts
If you understand how the computer starts, you had better be able to pinpoint
various problems that can occur during the startup process. This information
isn’t required reading, but it helps if you’re familiar with what happens and
where and how to be properly able to point the finger of blame.

Computer hardware is dumb. It needs software to tell it what to do. The prob-
lem, however, is that it’s the hardware that starts up first. So, the hardware in
a PC is geared toward immediately finding and loading an operating system so
that the computer can become a useful tool and not a kingdom of confused
characters searching for more instructions.
First: The first software the computer runs is encoded computer chips inside
the computer’s memory. Those chips are collectively referred to as the com-
puter’s chipset. The various chips tend to specific tasks, monitor things, and
provide communications on a very low level. But, before all that happens, the
chipset performs a special diagnostic test, called the Power-On Self Test, or
POST. This test ensures that all the basic input/output devices (monitor and
keyboard, for example) are working.
If it goes right: Various copyright text appears on the screen.
What can go wrong? When the POST fails, the computer either beeps
several times or, if the monitor is working, an error message is displayed.
Note that any error you get at this stage is always a hardware error.
Second: If the chipset is working properly, has passed the diagnostic, and
found all the devices it was expecting, it attempts to find an operating system
on one of the disk drives.
If it goes right: The operating system takes over and continues starting
up the computer.
What can go wrong? If an operating system isn’t found on any disk, a
“Missing Operating System” error is displayed. Or, the text “Non-system
disk” is displayed. This message is nasty.
Third: The operating system begins loading.
If it goes right: You see the pretty Windows startup logo, or “splash screen.”
What can go wrong? Anything at this point can go wrong because soft-
ware is in charge of the system. For example, in Windows a problem can
be detected and you’re thrust into the dreaded Safe mode. Or, Windows
may detect new hardware and attempt to install it. Or . . . just about
anything!
Fourth: The operating system loads other startup programs, such as device
drivers, startup applications, antivirus utilities, the Task Scheduler, plus
other programs you specify.
If it goes right: Eventually, you’re prompted to log in to Windows and
start your merry Windows day.
100
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

What can go wrong? Lots and lots of things: You may find that you have
missing devices or bad device drivers, an improperly uninstalled program
can display various “missing file” or “missing DLL” error messages, and on
and on.
Fifth, and finally: You can start using your computer.
If it goes right: There is rejoicing throughout the land.
What can go wrong? Everything.
It’s important to know these steps because a different solution exists for the
various problems that can occur as the steps progress. For example, a blank
screen with a blinking cursor when you first turn on the computer means that
even the chipset isn’t working properly. That makes the solution relatively
easy to find because you eliminate every other possibility.
 An older term for the computer’s chipset was BIOS. However, the BIOS
was originally one chip, and it did only one thing. Today’s computers
sport many chips, and together they comprise the computer’s basic
hardware. Together, the entire thing is called the chipset.
 BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System.
 The chipset’s instructions don’t include loading the computer’s operating
system from disk. Instead, a program called a boot loader is found on the
disk drive, and it’s the boot loader that really loads the operating system.
 Boot loaders can often do more than merely load another operating
system from disk. On some computers, the boot loader lets you select
an operating system to start.
 System Commander, Partition Magic, or even the Linux program LILO
are all examples of boot loaders that let you select an operating system
to start.
Immediate Trouble
Nothing beats a novel that gets into the action right away or a film that begins
in the middle of things with a chase scene (Star Wars comes to mind). It’s the
same with a computer: Nothing beats instant trouble. No sense in waiting for a
long, dreary process to find out that something is wrong or missing. No, instant
trouble is right there on the screen before you even have a chance to mangle
the mouse.
On the downside, instant trouble is often the unfortunate sign of impending
expensive repair or replacement. Not always, but often.
101
Chapter 8: Startup Problems

“I see nothing — just a blinking prompt!”
When the computer first starts, text should be displayed on the screen.
Typically, you see a copyright notice. The computer make and model number
may be displayed. (You may see a graphic image, but it’s really a special text
mode where the “characters” are bits of a larger image that are puzzle-pieced
together on the screen.)
Traditionally, a memory count takes place when the computer first starts.
You may see the counter tick away on some computers.
Depending on which hardware options are installed, you may see text regard-
ing those options: hard drive, mouse, or video adapter, for example.
Eventually, the parade of text ends with a prompt to press a certain key —
usually, Delete or F1 — to enter the computer’s Setup program. You have
about two beats of a lamb’s tail to decide about that, and then automatically
the computer’s operating system is loaded, takes off, and displays that color-
ful, graphic Windows logo. That’s the way it’s supposed to happen.
When all you see is a blinking prompt, it means one of the following things:
Problem: A motherboard failure has occurred. Something is wrong with 
the motherboard — an electronics fault, no power, or some other type of 
corruption.
Solution: Take the computer into the dealer and have someone replace the
motherboard. That can be expensive.
Problem: The computer is too hot. You can tell by feeling the case or check-
ing to see whether the fans are spinning. A computer doesn’t operate if its
internal temperature is too hot.
Solution: Fix the fans. Some microprocessors have fans, and these can be
replaced. Ensure that your dealer replaces only the microprocessor fan and
not the entire microprocessor, which would be expensive. (However, if the
dealer replaces the fan and the microprocessor is damaged, the microproces-
sor needs to be replaced as well.)
Problem: The hard drive has no operating system. This problem happens on
those systems that show logos and not startup text. Occasionally, you may
even see a “Missing Operating System” error.
Solution: See the section “The dreaded Missing Operating System message,”
a couple of sections from here.
102
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

 Some computers, such as eMachines, start with a graphic logo. You can
change this in the computer’s setup program so that you can see the
startup text instead. That’s a good option to choose if you’re experienc-
ing startup trouble.
 Make a note of which key combination starts the computer’s Setup pro-
gram. Text on the screen informs you of which key or key combination
to press to enter this program. On most PCs, it’s the Del or Delete key,
F1, F2, Alt+S, or F10. Whatever the key, make a note of it, for example, in
the manual that came with the computer or on this book’s Cheat Sheet.
 Sometimes, cables come loose, which may lead you to believe that you
have a major component failure, but it’s just not the case. If you’re bold
enough, unplug the PC and venture into its case. Check to ensure that all
the cables are properly connected and that all expansion cards are prop-
erly “seated” into their slots.
The nefarious Non-System Disk 
error message
The exact wording of the error message varies, but the cause is the same:
You have left a nonbootable floppy disk in Drive A. The solution: Remove the
disk and press the spacebar to continue booting from the hard drive.
 This error can also happen if you attempt to boot from a nonbootable
CD. Same solution.
 If you get the CD error often or dislike the floppy drive error, you can
fix it on most PCs. See the section “The computer stupidly starts from
another drive,” later in this chapter, for information on changing the
boot order.
 If a hard drive produces this error, it means that the hard drive lacks an
operating system. See the next section.
The dreaded Missing Operating 
System message
The most terrifying error message I have ever seen is “Missing Operating
System.” It’s a hardware error message that comes from the chipset, though
it could also be a boot loader message. Basically, it means that no operating
system is on disk to load. Uh-oh.
103
Chapter 8: Startup Problems

There are many things you can do, however:
Boot from a bootable CD: For example, your computer may have come with
a recovery disk, or you may have another bootable Windows CD. If so, try to
start the computer with it. Again, this technique confirms that the computer
is working fine; the problem may only be with the hard drive.
Use an emergency boot disk: Windows used to have a tool for making such a
recovery disk, but because Windows XP is so huge, it doesn’t fit on a floppy
disk any more. Instead, you can still find emergency boot disks or CDs with
some of your utility programs.
For example, Norton Utilities comes with an emergency boot disk that you
can use to start the computer and, hopefully, make some repairs. Disk parti-
tioning software also comes with emergency startup disks in case something
goes wrong with that software. Finally, some third-party backup programs
have boot disks you can use so that you can restore your computer system
from a set of backup disks.
Reinstall your computer system: The final step, which is most drastic and
terrible, is to merely start over and attempt a full system recovery. Most PCs
come with a recovery CD, which you can use to reinstall basic system soft-
ware and return your computer to the same state it was in when you took it
out of the box.
I wish that I had better news on this error message. Generally speaking, the
only way your operating system (Windows) can disappear and go for a powder
is if you have somehow messed with it. This situation can happen if you attempt
to modify or change the hard drive’s partition tables, boot sector, or master
boot record or, well, if you just up and delete all of Windows.
 Another culprit? Computer viruses. The Monkey virus can delete the FAT
resource on a hard drive, which is the map that tells Windows where to
find files. When the FAT is gone, so is the hard drive.
 Norton has a utility that may recover a hard drive if the FAT is damaged —
but don’t bet your data on it: Back up the hard drive and use antivirus
software as a precaution.
 Hardware-wise, this problem may occur if the hard drive fails outright.
However, that problem generates a BIOS error message on most systems
when the hard drive fails to initialize.
 Does this stuff scare you? Then it’s a good time to consider a backup
strategy (see Chapter 25).
104
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

The computer stupidly starts 
from another drive
Starting the computer from a disk drive other than the hard drive isn’t really
trouble, though it can often be annoying and may lead to some surprise.
Traditionally, the PC boots first from the floppy drive A, to check for the 
presence of a disk there and, if so, an operating system on that disk. Then,
Drive C is checked.
Today’s computers often check Drive A, the hard drive, and a CD-ROM drive. I
have noticed that if I keep a CD-ROM in the drive, some of my test computers
quiz me when they’re started: “Do you want to boot from the CD?” or “Press
any key to boot the CD.” This option is valuable if anything happens to the
hard drive.
If you would rather not mess with such messages, you can change the boot
order. Most computers let you do this through their Setup programs: Read
the screen when the computer first starts. Take note of which key (or keys)
to press to enter the Setup program.
In the Setup program, look for boot information. You may see an option there
to change the boot order, by specifying which disk drives you want the PC to
check for an operating system and in which order.
Be sure to save your selection to the Setup program’s memory if you make
any changes.
 Not every PC’s Setup program has boot options that let you change the
order of which disk is checked for an operating system.
 I generally disable booting from Drive A on my computers; that way, I
can be lazy and leave a disk in the drive, and it doesn’t stop up my com-
puter’s boot process.
 If you have an emergency and you need to boot from a floppy or CD, you
can rerun the Setup program and, once again, change the boot order.
That way, you can use an emergency boot disk, if the need arises.
Dealing with the Boot Menu
It’s entirely possible to have multiple operating systems on the same computer.
For example, one test PC I have has Windows XP, Windows Me, Windows 3.1,
DOS, and Linux all on the same system. This arrangement is accomplished
through a software program I use, called System Commander, but it can also be
done in Windows XP (and Windows 2000, though it’s not specifically covered in
this book).
105
Chapter 8: Startup Problems

When you have your system set up to boot into multiple operating systems,
you see a boot menu appear as the computer starts. (On a computer with
one operating system, you would see that sole operating system start.) You
can then select from a list which operating system you want.
Normally, this choice is a good thing. After all, today’s hard drives are roomy,
and the ability to support several operating systems is entirely possible.
In Windows XP, the Boot menu feature is controlled from the Startup and
Recovery dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-1.
Here’s how to display that dialog box:
1. Right-click the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Choose the Properties command from the pop-up menu.
The System Properties dialog box appears.
3. Click the Advanced tab.
Advanced doesn’t imply anything dangerous or scary. I view it as a word
Microsoft uses to throw in all the leftovers it couldn’t stick in any other
category.
4. In the Startup and Recovery area, click the Settings button.
It’s the lowest of the three Settings buttons in the dialog box. This step
displays the Startup and Recovery dialog box, as shown in Figure 8-1.

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

The drop-down Default operating system list displays the available 
operating system on your computer. (At least, it displays the operating
systems that Windows itself knows about.) This is where you choose
which operating system you want to boot from automatically; for exam-
ple, when you’re away from your computer when it starts.
The Time to Display List of Operating Systems option tells Windows how
many seconds to display the list before the default operating system is
automatically chosen.
5. To disable the menu, remove the check mark by the option Time to
display List of Operating Systems.
This way, Windows always boots into the operating system you have
selected.
6. Click OK when you’re done making changes to this dialog box.
Again, the list of operating systems appears only if you have installed multiple
versions of Windows on a PC and Windows itself is managing those operating
systems.
 If you’re using another system to control which operating system starts,
such as System Commander or the Linux LILO program, you have to
check its documentation for the various options and settings.
 Now would certainly be a good time for a hot, soft peanut butter cookie.
Getting at the Windows Advanced
Options Menu (Startup Menu)
Not to confuse you or anything, but your computer has a third startup menu.
In addition to the Setup menu and Boot menu, there’s also the Windows
Advanced Options menu. Here’s a rundown:
Setup menu: This is part of the computer’s Setup program, and it appears
when you press a certain key when the computer starts. The Setup menu, or
Setup program, is used to configure your computer’s hardware.
Boot menu: This menu appears courtesy of the boot loader. The menu allows
you to select an operating system to start, but only when more than one
operating system is installed in the computer. Or, if you have configured the
Windows XP Recovery Console, the Boot menu also displays that option.
Windows Advanced Options menu: Also known as the Startup menu, this
menu is used for troubleshooting your computer’s startup woes. It’s generated
by Windows itself, so this is the last of the three startup menus available. You
see it only if you know the trick.
107
Chapter 8: Startup Problems

The trick? Why, the F8 key! To see the Windows Advanced Options menu,
press the F8 key immediately after you hear the computer beep or you see
the menu to select an operating system or you see the “Starting Windows”
message on the screen. If you’re paranoid, just keep pressing the F8 key until
you see the Windows Advanced Options menu, a sample of which is shown in
Figure 8-2.
You have to be quick! If you’re too late, you don’t see the Windows Advanced
Options Menu.
The Windows Advanced Options menu typically displays one or more of the
following items, depending on your version of Windows and which options
are installed:
 Safe mode: The computer is started, but Windows doesn’t load any 
specific hardware drivers. Please see Chapter 24 for all the details and
reasons why.
 Safe mode with networking: This option is the same as Safe mode, but
with networking abilities enabled so that you can use the network and,
possibly, restore a network backup or download updated files from a
server.
 Safe mode with command prompt: The computer is started in DOS
mode in Windows and uses only basic configuration files. Note that this
is the only DOS mode, or command prompt, startup option available to
Windows XP.
 Enable boot logging: A text file is created as the computer starts, listing
which programs or processes start and whether they’re successful. The
file is named NTBTLOG.TXT, found in the Windows folder. You can use
the file to pinpoint problems the computer may have when starting,
though the information there is decipherable only by highly trained
tech-support people or Vulcans.
 Enable VGA mode: Select this option if you’re having video troubles
in Windows. The option looks similar to Safe mode, but unlike in Safe
Figure 8-2:
The
Windows
Advanced
Options
menu, or
Startup
menu.
108
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

mode, the rest of the computer starts up normally (only the video driver
is disabled). That way, you can fix a video problem and still have the rest
of your computer in working order.
 Last known good configuration: This option uses a type of System
Restore “on the fly” to return the computer to a state where it last started
properly. This option is good to choose if you’re unable to start the 
computer to run System Restore after some upgrade. Alas, unlike a real
System Restore, this option doesn’t fix or uninstall bad drivers or missing
files. (You need to run System Restore in Safe mode for that to happen.)
 Directory services restore mode: You can happily avoid using this option.
 Debugging mode: This option is used to check for problems on one
computer using a second computer connected via a serial cable. Both
this and the preceding selections are advanced options most likely used
by people in white lab coats and thick glasses who are best equipped to
deal with such things.
 Disable automatic restart on system failure: This option helps you
avoid the endless-loop situation when Windows automatically restarts
on a hardware failure. In such a situation, the computer forever starts up
and restarts. Selecting this option ends the madness.
 Start Windows normally: Just continue loading Windows as though you
didn’t press F8 to see the Startup menu.
 Reboot: Restart the computer.
 Return to OS choices menu: On computers that have multiple Windows
operating systems (OSs) installed, this option returns you to the operating
system selection menu (or the boot menu, as covered in the preceding
section).
Make your choice based on your troubleshooting needs. Various sections
elsewhere in this book recommend choices and options to take for this menu.
 On some computers, you can press and hold the Ctrl key rather than the
F8 key.
 If you see the Please Select an Operating System to Start menu (the Boot
menu), you have to press the F8 key again to get at the Startup menu.
 Any additional options not mentioned in the preceding list are generally
advanced configuration items. Mess with such options only when directed
to do so by a support technician.
 Believe it or not, the Windows Advanced Options menu doesn’t appear,
nor does the F8 key work, when you boot your computer into another
operating system, such as Linux.
 If the computer starts in Safe mode no matter what, see Chapter 24 for
more information.
109
Chapter 8: Startup Problems

 The Automatic Restart on System Failure problem has supposedly been
licked by Microsoft. Reportedly, no option is available in Windows itself
to turn on that feature, yet the menu option remains, most likely for old
time’s sake.
Hunting Down Mystery Startup Messages
Suppose that your computer starts as it normally does. However, along its
tired journey, some oddball messages pop up. It’s stuff you have never seen!
Is Windows causing the message? Is the message something to be concerned
with? And, most importantly, how do you get rid of the dumb message?
For some reason, Selective Startup is on
Selective Startup is a debugging tool set by the System Configuration Utility
(MSCONFIG). Here’s how to turn it off:
1. From the Start menu, choose the Run command.
The keyboard shortcut here is Win+R.
2. In the Run dialog box, type MSCONFIG and click the OK button.
The System Configuration Utility dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 8-3.
3. Choose the option labeled Normal Startup – Load All Device Drivers
and Services.
4. Click the OK button.
Windows may beg you to restart the computer after making this change. Do so.
Figure 8-3:
The System
Configura-
tion Utility
(MSCONFIG).
110
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

If this technique still doesn’t work, check the BOOT.INI tab in the System
Configuration Utility. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding steps and then
click the BOOT.INI tab, as shown in Figure 8-4. Ensure that the /SAFEBOOT
option isn’t checked. Indeed, ensure that none of the options is checked.
Then, click the OK button.
See Chapter 24 for information on the System Configuration utility.
The missing DLL or VxD file mystery
A typical nontext message that crawls under your skin appears in a dialog
box. Windows announces to you that a DLL or VxD or some sort of file is
missing or doesn’t exist. As with most text screen error messages, this one
means that something wasn’t installed or was uninstalled properly. The idea
is to find which idiotic program is displaying the message and squelch it.
The System Configuration Utility is the best tool for tracking down the causes
of unknown messages. Follow these steps to employ it and eliminate the
annoying error message:
1. Write down as much as you can about the message.
If the missing file has a name, write it down. If another program is men-
tioned, write it down.
2. Search for the file in question.
See Chapter 9 for information on finding files. You know the file’s name;
it was displayed in the warning dialog box. Now you need to check to
see whether the file exists. If you can find it, note in which folder it lives.
Figure 8-4:
The System
Configura-
tion Utility’s
BOOT.INI
tab.
111
Chapter 8: Startup Problems

3. Start the System Configuration utility.
Refer to Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding section.
Your job now is to try to find the program associated with the bum startup
program. It may be started directly or run when another program starts.
The name of the folder in which the missing file exists can be your clue
to which program “owns” the file.
4. First, check the Startup tab.
Scroll through the list of programs and see whether you can find the
“bad” one in there.
If you find the bad program listed, remove the check mark. This step
prevents that program from starting and the error message from being
displayed.
5. Second, check the Win.ini tab.
WIN.INI is an older Windows initialization file, used before Windows 95
introduced the concept of the Windows Registry, yet it’s still a source of
trouble.
6. Look for and open the [windows] folder.
If the folder isn’t there, you’re done; skip to Step 8.
7. Look for the run= or load= entries.
Those two entries are used to specify startup programs, such as
load=ptsnoop.exe
If either one lists your program, uncheck that entry to remove the 
program and the error message.
8. Close the System Configuration Utility when you’re done.
These steps should help you eliminate the programs that cause most of the
annoying “missing DLL” file messages. If not, you can also choose Programs➪
Startup to see whether the errant program appears on that menu. See the 
following section.
 Missing DLL/VxD file messages appear right after installing or uninstalling
a program. If you just installed a program and you get the message, try
installing the program again. If that doesn’t work, phone the developer
and have someone there fix the error.
 See the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the Internet for information
regarding missing DLL files for Windows. Visit http://support.
microsoft.com/ and select your version of Windows. Search for the
DLL or VxD file’s name, and any information about the file appears in 
the search results, along with information on how to fix any problems.
(Also refer to Chapter 5.)
112
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Stopping Things from Automatically
Starting
Windows can stick programs in three places to start them automatically.
The first two are covered in the preceding section; the System Configuration
Utility’s Startup tab lists programs that Windows itself automatically starts
for you. The [windows] section of the old WIN.INI file could also be used to
secretly start programs, though that’s exceedingly rare for Windows XP.
For you, a mere mortal user, you have the Startup folder on the Start button’s
Programs menu: After clicking the Start button, choose All Programs➪Startup.
The menu you see, similar to what’s shown in Figure 8-5, lists a bunch of pro-
grams designed to start automatically whenever the computer starts — a nifty
thing to have.
Well, it’s nifty until a program is in there that you don’t want to start automat-
ically. In that case, I recommend either deleting the program or moving it to a
NotStartup folder.
113
Chapter 8: Startup Problems
“What’s a DLL file?”
The DLL file is one of the most regrettable mis-
takes made by the people who originally created
Windows. The idea seemed worthwhile and
wholesome: Much of computer programming
involves the redundant rewriting of a few
common routines. For example, most applications
use the Open, Save, Print, and several other
dialog boxes. Rather than re-create that pro-
gramming code over and over, the wise 
programmers at Microsoft decided to save every-
one time and bother. So, they created the
Dynamically Linked Library (DLL) file concept.
A DLL file contains common routines to be used
by all programs. For example, the COMMDLG.DLL
file contains the programming needed to use the
Open, Save, Print, and other common dialog
(COMMDLG) boxes. Other DLL files were created
so that programmers could link into them and
everyone could share all the same code and be
happy and go on to live lives of religious and 
spiritual fulfillment.
Alas, the DLL solution became a problem in itself
because just about everyone figured out how to
make better DLL files. There were conflicts!
There was competition! There was hoohaw! And
eventually the simple solution turned out to be a
gigantic pain in the rear. I have heard a rumor that
the next version of Windows will do away with
DLL files. If so, there will be much rejoicing.

Deleting a program from the Startup folder
To delete the program, right-click its entry on the Startup menu. Choose
Delete from the pop-up menu, and the program is gone.
 Only a shortcut icon is deleted. The program isn’t removed from the
hard drive. (To remove a program, you must uninstall it.)
 If you make a mistake, press Ctrl+Z right away, and your deleted menu
item is yanked back.
Be aware that Windows XP has many Startup folders. Just because you have
deleted the file from one account doesn’t automatically delete it from every
user’s account.
To remove the unwanted startup program from everyone’s account, follow
these steps:
1. Right-click the Start button.
2. Choose Open All Users from the pop-up shortcut menu.
A window appears that displays program shortcuts and folders common
to all user accounts on your computer.
Figure 8-5:
The Startup
folder.
114
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

3. Open the Programs folder.
4. Open the Startup folder.
5. Remove the unwanted programs.
Click to select a program’s icon and then press the Delete key on your
computer’s keyboard.
6. Close the window when you’re done.
Creating a NotStartup folder
Better than deleting a Startup menu item is disabling the program from start-
ing. You do that by moving the menu item from the Startup folder to a special
folder you create, called NotStartup. Such a folder is shown in Figure 8-5 (just
below the Startup folder).
Here’s how to create your own NotStartup folder:
1. Right-click the Start button.
2. Choose the Open command from the pop-up menu.
This step opens a window into the Start button’s menu folder. That’s
where folders appear as submenus and shortcut icons appear as menu
commands. It’s sneaky, but also a very good way to edit the Start menu.
3. Open the Programs folder.
You see menu items (shortcut icons) and menus (folders), including the
Startup folder.
4. Choose File➪New➪Folder from the menu.
The new folder appears highlighted in the window.
5. Type NotStartup as the folder’s new name.
If this step doesn’t work, reselect the New Folder icon by clicking it once
with the mouse. Press the F2 key, and then you can rename the folder.
The NotStartup folder is now a new menu off the main All Programs
menu. You can pop up the Start button and look at the menu to confirm
this, if you like. Or, you can continue by moving those items you want
disabled from the Startup folder to the NotStartup folder.
6. Open the Startup folder.
7. Click to select the program that you don’t want to run when the com-
puter starts.
If it’s more than one program, press the Ctrl key as you click the mouse.
This step lets you select more than one icon.
115
Chapter 8: Startup Problems

8. Choose Edit➪Cut from the menu.
9. Click the Up button to return to the main Programs folder.
10. Open the NotStartup folder.
11. Choose Edit➪Paste.
The shortcut icons are moved — and disabled from starting up every
time Windows starts.
12. Close the Programs window.
The beauty of this system is that you can easily reenable the programs by
moving them from the NotStartup folder back to the Startup folder. Nothing
is ever lost.
And now, the bad news: In Windows XP, there’s more than one Programs
folder. If you want to make this change for all accounts on your computer,
you have to repeat the preceding steps. But, in Step 2, choose Open All Users
rather than the Open command. Then, repeat all the steps as written. That
operation builds the NotStartup folder for everyone to use.
Don’t bother peppering me with questions about why Windows XP has two
sets of folders for everything! That’s trouble I would rather not shoot in this
chapter.
Where else do startup programs lurk?
The Startup folder is obviously not the only place Windows tucks programs
that automatically start. No, Windows is pretty sneaky about knowing where
to hide programs that can start — and it has quite a few of them.
The place to disable these programs is the System Configuration Utility,
which is covered throughout this chapter as well as in Chapter 24. What the
System Configuration utility shows you is merely information that exists deep
within the Windows Registry. One such place is the devious Run entry.
Before messing with the devious Run entry, first run System Restore to set a
restore point. That’s in case you really screw up; the restore point gives you a
chance to undo anything major (refer to Chapter 4). Then, follow these steps:
1. Choose the Run command from the Start menu, or press the Win+R
keyboard combination.
The Run dialog box appears.
2. Type REGEDIT and click the OK button.
The ominous Registry Editor program comes forth. (Cue the scary music
and howling-wolf sound effects.)
116
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

3. Open the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key.
4. Open the Software folder.
5. Open the Microsoft folder.
6. Open the Windows folder.
7. Open the CurrentVersion folder.
8. Finally, open the Run folder.
The contents of the Run folder appear on the right side of the window,
as shown in Figure 8-6. Each of those items, flagged with an “ab” icon, is
the name of a supersecret startup item.
9. Remove unwanted items.
To remove a startup item, click it with your mouse. After the item is
selected, press the Delete key on your keyboard to remove that item.
Do this only if you really want to remove the item! Some of those startup
items are programs that your computer needs and you want. Be careful!
10. Close the Registry Editor when your desires of wanton destruction are
quenched.
Many of the items listed in the Run area of the Registry are also found on the
Startup tab in the System Configuration Utility. Try removing them in that
program first before descending into the Registry.
Sometimes, even this type of drastic file removal doesn’t work! Specifically, in
the case of spyware, you may find that programs you remove — even in the
Registry — come back to life to haunt you. In that case, you must use anti-
spyware software to fully and properly remove the annoying program. See
Chapter 24.

Chapter 8: Startup Problems

Mystery startup programs from beyond
The total number of programs and processes running in your computer can
be viewed by using the Task Manager window. To summon the Task Manager,
press Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
The Task Manager’s Applications tab lists all running programs in your com-
puter, similar to what’s shown on the taskbar. But, the truth is that many
dozens of programs are running in your computer at one time. To see the log,
click the Processes tab.
Figure 8-7 shows the Processes tab in the Task Manager window. There are
34 of them, each an individual program or piece of a program that is busily
doing something in Windows. This begs the question “Where the heck did all
those programs come from?”
The processes listed in the Task Manager aren’t really traditional programs in
the sense that you run them the way you run other programs in Windows. In
fact, you may notice that many of the processes are run by a single program
called SVCHOST.EXE. That’s a general service program that runs all sorts of
servers and software assistants inside Windows.
Figure 8-7:
Processes
running in
your
computer.
118
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Notice that curious End Process button, which makes it seem like a normal
and regular thing to select and end various processes. It’s not. Although it’s
true that some processes could be viruses and that not all the processes run-
ning are necessary, randomly killing off a process isn’t advisable.
 If you want to shut down an unwanted process, refer to Chapter 21 for
the proper techniques to go about doing so.
 For more information on what the items in the Image Name column
mean, see the appendix in this book.
Disabling a window that appears every
time you start the computer
Occasionally, I get e-mail from a reader who is bugged beyond tolerance for
a silly old folder window that appears each and every time the computer
starts. There it is! There it is again!
Folks, Windows is designed to redisplay any windows you had open the last
time you shut down. So, if you quit Windows but leave a My Documents
window open (or even minimized as a button on the taskbar), don’t be sur-
prised when that same window appears (open) when you restart Windows.
It’s supposed to happen that way!
 If you don’t want a window to appear when Windows restarts, close it
before you shut down Windows.
 There’s an oddball chance that the Windows Explorer program 
may have been installed in the Startup folder. Windows Explorer
(EXPLORER.EXE) is the name of the program that displays folder win-
dows on the screen. When a copy of that program is in the Startup
folder, or any of the various spots used to start programs when
Windows starts, that may also be producing the phantom folder on
startup. This situation, however, is extremely rare.
 The open folder may be a remnant of a recently uninstalled program, or
from some other operation that was somehow botched. Remember that
things go awry in a computer because something has changed. Review
your PC’s recent changes to perhaps locate the problem’s source.
119
Chapter 8: Startup Problems

“My PC Annoyingly Phones the Internet
Every Time It Starts!”
Many programs have the urge to contact the Microsoft mothership, or any of
a number of motherships, every time the computer starts. This is entirely
normal, though to most folks it’s kind of surprising to find the computer
using the modem every time Windows starts.
Some programs, such as antivirus utilities, may dial in to the Internet to obtain
updates when your computer first starts.
Some programs dial in to the Internet to complete the installation process.
For example, if you have recently installed a Microsoft mouse, it wants to
confirm with Microsoft various configuration information as a final step in
the setup process.
Again, all these things are normal. My only beef is that the program should
be forthright about its intentions. A dialog box should appear and tell you,
“This program needs to contact the Internet for important update informa-
tion.” Alas, few of these surprise programs do so.
 Should you let the program dial in? It’s up to you. I have toyed with the
Microsoft mouse program long enough that it finally gave up.
 Watch out for those registration programs that run fresh after you install
new software or hardware. You don’t have to register on the Internet if
you don’t want to.
 Obviously, if you have a broadband (always-on) Internet connection, this
situation happens to you too, but you don’t really notice it as much as
the dial-up Internet users do.

You would think that a Roman coin, one that’s about 2,000 years old,
would cost more than $10. At one time, it did! But that was before folks
all over Europe started using inexpensive metal detectors. They discovered,
buried there in the ground for hundreds of years, jars and jars of ancient
money — so much so that finding a Roman coin today is easier than finding
an American coin of just 200 years ago.
Finding things is important. The guy who buried his coins 2,000 years ago
was being smart about saving his money, but hasty about remembering
where he put the treasure. Saving files on your PC works much in the same
way. You can look up. You can look down. You can trod all over the hard drive
with a pickax and shovel. Eventually, you just find yourself with a yard full of
holes — unless you get the proper tool (a metal detector) to find the coins
you’re looking for. In Windows, that tool is the Search command.
Finding and Searching
In the top drawer of the Windows treasure chest is a wonderfully powerful
file-finding command. It’s fast. It’s convenient. It’s always correct. If only it
were easy to use, most of this chapter would be unnecessary. Alas.

122
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
Why do your files get up and go?
Files disappear for two reasons: You forgot where you put the file, or the file
was deleted. Yeah, this is one of those few cases where it really could be your
fault! Unless you believe in the File-Deleting Fairy. . . .
In the case of file downloads from the Internet, sometimes the files never
appear. That’s because you’re supposed to save the download to disk, not
open the download — but that’s a sorrowful woe for another chapter.
The quick Search command
In a hurry? You can use tricks to immediately search for stuff. Two key com-
mands come to mind:
 Win+F: Press the Windows key plus the F key to summon the Search
Results window.
 F3: Press the F3 key to bring up the Search Results window — but this
technique works only when no other windows are open or you’re view-
ing a folder window.
Either of these keys displays a Search Results window, which looks like a reg-
ular file folder window, but with the Search Companion panel off to the left,
as shown in Figure 9-1.
Figure 9-1:
The Search
Companion
panel.

123
Chapter 9: Finding Lost Files and Things
You can also summon the Search Companion panel in any folder window by
clicking the Search button. The keyboard shortcut here is Ctrl+E.
The next few sections assume that you have the Search panel ready to go and
look for stuff.
 Configure the Search Results window so that Details view is showing:
Choose View➪Details from the menu. That’s the best way to sift through
the results.
 See the dog in Figure 9-1? Don’t let its pleasant nature lead you to believe
that it’s accommodating.
 Nope, there’s no way to get rid of the dog. Yeah. I know how you feel:
You slogged through (more than) four years of college and then three
years of law school. You paid $3,000 to get the computer of your dreams
for your law office. And there you are, trying to do some good and a silly,
insipid, animated puppy is trying to help you out. Don’t let the clients
see it; the world doesn’t need another lawyer joke.
 The F3 key may not always summon the Search Results window. In some
applications, the F3 key has other functions. (That’s why it’s called a
function key.)
Searching for something you created 
or downloaded today or yesterday
I tend to lose things immediately, so first I try to search for files created in the
past day or so. Hopefully, one of them is the one that’s missing.
Toss all that fun and graphic frivolity of the Search Companion out the
window, my friend. The best way to find files is to get at the raw controls.
Heed these steps in the Search Companion panel:
1. Choose All Files and Folders.
2. Choose My Computer from the Look In drop-down list.
You want to ensure that Windows looks everywhere for your file, though
if you’re certain that it’s in the My Documents folder or on Drive C, choose
those options instead; that makes the search go a wee bit faster.
3. Click the downward-pointing chevron by the option When Was It
Modified?
4. Choose Specify Dates.
You must be specific — today or even yesterday!

5. Choose Created Date from the drop-down list.
6. Type yesterday’s date in the From field.
The date shown is today’s date, so modify the day (and month, if needed)
to reflect yesterday.
The To field contains today’s date, so it need not be changed.
7. Click the Search button.
Files flow into the window (see Figure 9-2), each one of them created
today or yesterday. Hopefully, you don’t see too many; Figure 9-2 says
that 89 files were found. Golly.
8. If you know the approximate time you created the file, click the Date
Modified heading.
Scroll through the list to seek out files created during the approximate
time you were downloading. That should find you the file you want.
You can also use the Size column to locate the file if you can remember
about how big it was. For some reason, I remember how large download
files are (probably because of the time it takes to receive them).
Figure 9-2:
Search

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

125
Chapter 9: Finding Lost Files and Things
If you found the file, great! Right-click its icon and choose Send To➪My
Documents from the pop-up menu. That action moves the icon to the 
My Documents folder — perhaps not the best place for the file, but at least a
place where you can see it! Close the Search Results window, and then you
can move the file from the My Documents folder to wherever you feel would
be a better place for it.
If the search results came up with disappointing results, maybe the file just
wasn’t saved to disk. That happens. You can try modifying the dates to search:
Specify a date earlier than yesterday, for example, and then try again.
Files you download from the Internet must be saved to disk. Choose the Save
button, not the Open button, when you’re downloading files.
Searching for something when you 
know only the file’s contents
The more you know about a file, the easier it is to find. For example, I knew
I had an Excel spreadsheet that documented my recent travel expenses. I
forgot the name of the file, but I remembered that it was an Excel spreadsheet
and that it had the phrase “not including hookers” in it. That certainly makes
finding the file easier.
 Alas, on the downside, when you have Windows search each file for a
chunk of text, the searches can last forever. So, when you do need to
search for a bit of text, please try to specify as much additional informa-
tion as possible: filename (or part of it), program that created the file or
file type, size, or date or approximate date, for example.
 The Search command can locate documents only by text, not by any
other information. Graphics files, for example, cannot be searched, even
if the graphics image is a text picture.
 Be sure to specify the My Documents folder and check to ensure that
subfolders are being searched. Rarely is it necessary to search every-
where on the hard drive for a document containing a bit of text.
As you would expect, Windows buries the option for finding text in a docu-
ment. I suppose that hiding that option was done in the name of making
things easier, but I doubt it.
To find a file based on a bit of text, follow these steps:

1. Bring up the Search Companion panel, as described earlier.
If you have just finished one search, click the Back button in the Search
Companion panel to start over with a new search.
2. Choose the item labeled Documents (word processing or spreadsheet,
for example).
Only documents contain text. All the other choices are for system files
or files that contain things far scarier than plain text.
3. Click the item labeled Use Advanced Search Options.
This item is found in the bottom of the next panel that appears.
4. Type your text into the box labeled A Word or Phrase in the Document.
You may need to use the scroll bar in the Search Companion panel to
find and use this option.
Type the text as you remember it. Don’t worry about proper uppercase
or lowercase right now; Windows is smart enough to find any matching
text — even stuff that’s remotely close.
5. Click the Search button.
Windows scurries off to hunt down the file.
If the file you want isn’t listed in the results, choose one of the additional
options in the Search Companion to help refine your search. The more infor-
mation you can specify, the more successful (and brief) the results.
How to find a found file’s folder
After you find the wayward file, you most likely want to open up the folder
it lives in, either to scold the file or to properly cut and paste it back into a
more appropriate folder.
When Windows finds a file, it lists the file’s folder information right by the
file’s icon. This information is best seen in Details view, as I recommend ear-
lier in this chapter. (Choose View➪Details in the Search Results window.)
But, listing a file’s folder information can be vague or confusing. There has
to be a better way to open that folder . . . .
Ta-da! Presenting the better way: Right-click the file’s icon. That displays a
pop-up menu, from which you can choose the command Open Containing
Folder. That opens the folder containing the found file, with the file’s icon
highlighted, or selected, inside the window. See? Computers really do make
life easier!

“Wow! This Search command is awesome!
Is there anything it cannot find?”
The Search command is good for locating files anywhere on your computer
system, in any disk drive. Except — the Search command does not look inside
the Recycle Bin.
Files inside the Recycle Bin are considered deleted, even though they aren’t
really gone forever. Even so, the Search command doesn’t look in the Recycle
Bin for lost files. (Refer to Chapter 4 for more information on finding files in
the Recycle Bin.)
The Search command does, however, scan through compressed folder, or zip
file archives. Those files must be freed from their archive prison to be useful,
but Search locates them.
Recovering Other Lost Things
Most places that deal with the public have a lost-and-found department. With
computers, there must also be a Hopelessly Lost and Never Found department.
When the Search command comes up empty, you can try my suggestions from
this section to see about recovering files in more obtuse and creative ways.
 Don’t forget the Undo key, Ctrl+Z! If something just disappears, try
Ctrl+Z to see whether you can call it back.
 Sometimes, you just have to accept things: When a file is gone, it’s gone.
Pity.
“The shortcut points to nowhere!”
Shortcuts are handy copies of a file, but without all the extra bulk. File lite:
Same great taste, but only a few bytes of hard drive space. I probably don’t
need to justify creating a shortcut here because you already have one and,
well, its original file has gone bye-bye.
When you see the Missing Shortcut dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-3, don’t
panic! Windows begins a minisession of the Search command and tries to
locate the mislaid original file.
127
Chapter 9: Finding Lost Files and Things

Most of the time, the search is successful. Windows finds the original file and
asks whether you want to redirect the shortcut to that file. If so, a tearful
reunion ensues. Sometimes, however, the search results may show similar
files, but nothing that really works. In that case, too bad.
Finally, if the original file is truly gone and nothing similar remains, you see
a dialog box, as shown in Figure 9-4. Click the Delete It button; the shortcut
points nowhere.
 If you renamed or moved the original file, click that Browse button in the
Missing Shortcut dialog box (refer to Figure 9-3). Then, repoint the short-
cut icon back at the original by using the Browse dialog box. This advice
assumes, of course, that you know where the original was moved.
 Windows is smart enough to recognize when you rename or move an
original file so that all the shortcuts are updated. Or, at least that’s
what’s promised in the brochure.
 Windows isn’t smart enough to delete shortcuts when you delete their
original files.
 Don’t forget to look in the Recycle Bin for the original! If you find it,
restore the deleted file, and your shortcut works again.

“The whatever-submenu on the 
Start menu is missing!”
This tragedy happens immediately after user enlightenment; you suddenly
discover that you can, indeed, edit and tidy up that bloated, messy Start
menu! And so you go at it: pruning, grafting, creating, destroying. But when
you’re done, you discover that some submenu is missing. It’s gone!
Or, you may just start using the computer one day and discover that some
menu or menu item is missing from the Start menu.
Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of files?
The Shortcut knows!
Shortcut icons remember who owns them. You
can discover this information as well, even if the
original file has long since left for more digital
pastures: Right-click the shortcut icon. Choose
the Properties command from the pop-up menu.
The shortcut’s Properties icon appears, as
shown in the following figure. There, you can
divine lots of information about the shortcut.
The Target box lists the original file’s full path-
name. That’s where Windows expects to find
the original. Don’t worry about hunting it down;
just click the Find Target button and that folder
is opened for you. This technique doesn’t work
if the original was deleted; you end up with the
same dialog boxes as shown in Figures 9-3 and
9-4. However, it does give you a good idea about
where the original file belonged.

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
The official tech-support response for this situation is as follows:
Tough!
Sadly, if you remove a chunk of the Start menu, it’s gone. If you catch yourself
right away, you can press Ctrl+Z, the Undo command, to get that menu back.
But, beyond that, you’re just stuck out of luck.
 If you catch yourself accidentally moving a menu with the mouse, imme-
diately press Ctrl+Z to undo it. Otherwise, you have to look for the menu
and carefully drag it back by using the mouse.
 If the menu was deleted, look in the Recycle Bin for it.
 On rare occasions, you may need to reinstall a Windows component to
get a certain menu back. For example, the Games menu may disappear if
all the Windows games have been removed. To reinstall the games, use
the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel. Refer to the section
in Chapter 4 about bringing back bits of Windows.
 To turn off personalized menus in most Office 2000 applications (Word
and Excel, for example), choose Tools➪Customize. In the Customize
dialog box, click the Options tab. Then, remove the check mark next to
the option labeled Menus Show Recently Used Commands First. Click
Close.
 For Office XP (Word 2002 or Excel 2002, for example), choose Tools➪
Customize to display the Customize dialog box. Click the Options tab
and put a check mark by the item Always Show Full Menus.
Forgotten Passwords
The best way to remember your passwords is to write them down! The 
obviously dumb thing to do is write them down on a sticky note, titled
“Passwords,” and paste that note to the side of your monitor. That’s silly.
It’s better to write all the passwords down and put them in your office’s fire
safe or between the covers of Upgrading and Repairing PCs or some other
book that no one else reads.
Another fine place to hide passwords is in your daybook or on a calendar.
Jotting a password down on a page or date looks innocent and random, but
only you make the connection between that bit of text and your password.
Beyond that help, there may be times when you just downright forget a pass-
word. It’s missing! Where did it go! Think back to before the tequila binge last
weekend. Then mull over this section.

131
Chapter 9: Finding Lost Files and Things
Missing Internet passwords
Because you’re most likely automatically logged in to the Internet, chances
are that when you really need to know your password, such as when you’re
setting up a new e-mail program, you won’t remember it.
I keep all my ISP’s records in a locked file cabinet. When I forget what my orig-
inal Internet password is, I just open the file cabinet and look it up. Unless
you have planned ahead like that, the only other solution is to phone your
ISP and request the password. They may tell you the password over the
phone, or they may e-mail you the password. (Of the two, I would prefer to
hear the password spelled out over the phone.)
Immediately after getting the lost password, use your ISP’s configuration Web
page to change your password to something else. Like other organizations,
ISPs may not hire the most trustworthy people. Therefore, it’s a good idea to
immediately change your password after it has been recovered.
Missing Web page passwords
More and more Web sites have passwords used to protect your account and
verify your identity. It’s not recommended that you use the same dang doodle
password for all those Web sites (though many folks do). When you use mul-
tiple passwords, it’s easy to forget them. Another flaw is that you can configure
your Web browser to automatically type your password, which means that,
after a while, you forget it.
What’s a good password?
The best password is cryptic, containing a mix-
ture of letters and numbers, and also something
that you can easily remember. The experts sug-
gest creating a password composed of two
common yet unrelated words that are connected
by a number. For example:
smart9dodo
hillarious1funeral
annoying5wealth
delicious77fungus
Even better is to capitalize one or more letter. In
fact, some Internet sites and office networks
require that you have a password more than six
characters long with a combination of numbers
and upper- and lowercase letters.
Isn’t this crazy? No! Security is important. As you
start doing more online, you appreciate the added
value of having a hard-to-crack password. The
only better thing you can do is to frequently
change your good password. The experts rec-
ommend doing so at least four times a year.

Most Web sites have a feature where your password is mailed to you if you
forget it. Take whatever steps necessary to have the Web page send you the
forgotten password. Then, wait and in a few minutes or so the password
should arrive in your e-mail inbox.
Web sites may also employ a password hint. The hint is text you type that,
hopefully, reminds you of your password. For example, if your password is
the number and street of the house you grew up in, the hint may be “Address
of first house.” That’s a good hint because it reminds you of the password,
but doesn’t let others know what that address could be.
Using password recovery in Windows
The saying goes that if you forget your password in Windows, you’re screwed.
Microsoft can’t help you. I can’t help you. Gurus on the Internet can’t help
you. Some even laugh at you. I have heard rumors of password-cracking 
programs, but my guess is that those things are really viruses in disguise
(also known as Trojan horses). What’s a human to do?
First, you can add a hint to your password prompt in Windows. Follow these
steps:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the User Accounts icon.
3. Click to select your account.
4. Click the item titled Change My Password.
You use the next screen, as shown in Figure 9-5, to enter a new pass-
word, and also enter the password hint.
5. Fill in the blanks on the screen.
Type your old password and then the new password twice. To keep the
same password, type it three times. Then type the password hint, which
should help clue you in to what the password is, if you forget it.
Don’t make the password hint the same as the password! That’s like
taping your house key to the front door — or leaving it in the lock!
To see the password hint, click the blue question mark button when you see
the graphical Windows logon screen, as shown in Figure 9-6. This option isn’t
available in the other, traditional logon screen.

Chapter 9: Finding Lost Files and Things
Second, after creating the hint, you can make a Password Reset disk. This
disk can always be used to unlock your computer whenever you forget a
password. But, like with a house key, you must put the disk in a safe place or
else any nimrod can get into your computer.
Here’s how to create the Password Reset disk:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the User Accounts icon.
3. Click to select your account.

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
4. In the Related Tasks panel (on the left), click the item titled Prevent a
Forgotten Password.
This step runs the Forgotten Password Wizard.
5. Obey the wizard’s instructions!
Follow along as the wizard helps you create the Password Reset disk;
click the Next button as necessary.
You need a floppy disk or any other type of removable media (but not a
CD-R) to use as the Password Reset disk.
The wizard doesn’t erase the disk!
6. Click the Finish button when you’re done with the wizard.
The Password Reset disk has been created; remove it from the drive and
properly label it. Or, don’t properly label it, but label it so that you can iden-
tify it and others may not. (I mean, it wouldn’t be very secure to label the
disk Password Reset and leave it lying around for anyone to use.)
To use the disk, simply try to log in to Windows without typing your pass-
word. When you do, you’re asked whether you want to use the Password
Reset disk. Just follow the instructions to do so.
The administrator’s passwords
The administrator is the main account in Windows XP. It plays a heavier role
in Windows XP Professional than it does in Windows XP Home, but in both
versions of Windows the administrator’s account remains the primary user
account for the computer.
Unlike your own account, the administrator’s account is used only when
modifying or repairing your computer. In fact, you may not even see the
administrator’s account on the logon screen unless you’re starting your 
computer in Safe mode.
If you have never set a specific administrator’s password, try using your own
account’s password. That probably will work. Otherwise, if you have forgotten
the administrator’s password, there’s nothing you can do, short of reinstalling
Windows on your computer.
That’s a lie: There are things you can do. Primarily, you must restart your
computer by using either a special DOS boot disk or a Linux CD. Special
hacker software is then used to read information from the hard drive that
helps crack the password, but these techniques require advanced knowledge
of computers and they often damage the computer. My advice: Use the
Password Reset disk as described in the preceding subsection. Do it now.

Sounds Like Trouble
In This Chapter
 Troubleshooting the no-sound problem
 Setting up your sound scheme
 Things too loud!
 Things too soft!
 F-f-f-fixing the stuttering sound
E
arly computers were mute. In fact, the “bell” the computer rang was on
the teletype machine, not inside the computer itself. When the micro-
computer first came out in the late 1970s, it had a speaker — much cheaper
than installing a bell. The hobbyists of that era soon discovered that the
speaker could be programmed to make all sorts of noise.
Sound has evolved to become an indispensable part of computing. The com-
puter talks, sings, plays music, and does a number of other interesting audio
things — all of which you miss when the sound system stifles itself. Because
sound has evolved in the PC (it was sort of a happenstance thing), the root of
the sound problem could lie in a number of places: the CD-ROM drive, sound
adapter, speakers, or software, for example. This chapter helps you narrow
down the options and get your PC bleeping again.
 Refer to Chapter 8 for information on beeps (or no beep) you may hear
when the computer first starts.
 Indeed, sound has evolved on the PC. The original IBM PC had a speaker
that could beep or play simple songs. The Tandy 1000 computer intro-
duced an integrated sound card into its PC design in 1986. When CD-ROMs
became a part of the PC’s hardware inventory, external speakers became
the requirement. Then, along came the Web in 1996 or so with streaming
audio. And, in 1999? MP3 files. Sound has come a long way.
 The ASCII code for the bell is ^G (Control-G). The ASCII code for page
eject is ^L (Control-L). A common college prank of the 1970s had sopho-
more computer science majors concocting a program that sent an infinite
number of ^G^L commands to the system printer, usually at 2 a.m. Ha-ha.
On today’s computers, you can still hear the bell: Open a DOS prompt
window and type ECHO and a space and then press Ctrl+G. Press the
Enter key. BEEP!

It Is the Sound of Silence
Sound is so much a part of the computing experience that we miss it when
it’s gone. So, a frantic search begins! There’s no specific place to start look-
ing, so obey the steps in this section in order and, hopefully, one of them will
lead to a noisy solution.
 As with most immediate boo-boos, try restarting Windows to see
whether that gets the sound back.
 Don’t forget the System Restore command! When you hear (or don’t
hear) sound trouble, immediately attempt a System Restore to go back
to a louder time.
Checking the speakers
The sound trail starts at either side of your head, with your ears. Not to make
light of excess cerumen build-up, but do ensure that your ears are clear of
debris. That’s the first step. Next, check your PC’s speakers.
Check the speaker connections. Here’s that patch of ground where your
computer becomes a stereo system. The question: Are your speakers prop-
erly plugged in — plugged into the computer; plugged into each other;
plugged into a subwoofer; and plugged into the power source? Use the dia-
gram in Figure 10-1 to help you check things. (If you think that the figure is
ugly, wait until you see all the cables behind the PC!)
From the computer, the sound goes out the speaker jack, which may also be
labeled Line Out or Phones (as in headphones). This is where the speakers
plug in.
On the back of the speaker, the wire goes into an input jack, though most
speakers have this wire permanently attached.
Another wire goes from one speaker to the other. In Figure 10-1, the Left Out
wire goes to the input jack on the left speaker.
Finally, speakers need power, so a power cable goes from the main speaker
(the one on the right in Figure 10-1) to a power source.
If you have a subwoofer, the nightmare gets worse: Sound must go from the
speakers to the subwoofer, and the subwoofer must be powered as well.
136
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

137
Chapter 10: Sounds Like Trouble
 If your PC has a DVD player, check to see whether it also has a DVD
player expansion card. If so, plug your speakers into that card and not
into the regular sound jacks! Turn your PC around and look for the DVD
expansion card, which should have speaker jacks as well as an S-Video
connector (plus other connectors). Plug your speaker into the speaker
jack on that card.
 Make sure that everything is plugged in snugly!
 Subwoofers are also called bass boosters.
 As you’re facing the monitor, the “right” speaker is the one that sits on
the right side of the monitor. The “left” speaker is the one sitting on the
left side. This arrangement can be confusing because when you work on
the speakers, you’re often working behind your computer, where left and
right are backward.
 The speakers plug into the speaker jack.
 The speaker jack may also be labeled with a symbol, one that usually
has an arrow pointing away from it.
 Newer systems have color-coded audio jacks. The speaker jack is typi-
cally coded lime green.

 Figure 10-1 shows the right speaker as the main one, though the left
speaker may be the main one on some models.
 In some situations, the subwoofer is the main speaker, and it connects
directly to the PC. Then the left and right speakers connect to the 
subwoofer.
 Yeah, it’s nuts.
 I hate to mention it, but you can often “test” the speakers by touching the
input plug — the one that plugs into the computer — to the computer’s
case. If the speakers are okay, you hear a slight hum as you do that, which
is the sound of the speakers picking up the computer’s electric field. I’m
sure that audiophiles would cringe at the thought, but it works.
Any knobs on the speakers? Some speakers have volume control knobs. Are
they up? How about a power knob? Is the speaker on?
Are the speakers getting power? Yes, this is a speaker-connection issue, but
note that some speakers use batteries as their source of power. Be sure to
check the batteries.
Or, to hell with batteries! Go get a power converter for your speakers. They
should have a little power plug that the converter can plug into. Listed some-
where on the speaker are its power requirements, which you should note and
then go to the electronics store to get the proper converter.
Are the speakers getting enough oomph? If the speakers make noise, but
only feebly, check the volume control, which is covered later in this chapter.
If the volume is all the way up, however, what’s most likely happening is that
the sound is unamplified. Check your PC’s rump to see whether it has another
hole for the speakers to plug into.
If none of these steps works, try running the speakers through a subwoofer.
Or, if they’re running through a subwoofer, ensure that the subwoofer is on!
If nothing seems to help, get a new set of speakers.
Checking the master volume control
So, the speakers work, huh? Maybe it’s the computer itself to blame? Check
to see whether Windows has muted the situation:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Choose Run.
The Run dialog box unfurls. You can also bring it forth by using the
Win+R keyboard shortcut.

139
Chapter 10: Sounds Like Trouble
3. Type SNDVOL32 into the box.
4. Click OK.
This step brings up the Play Control window, as shown in Figure 10-2.
So? Is anything muted? Check the Mute options, such as the CD Digital item
shown in Figure 10-2.
Is any specific volume turned down? If so, adjust the volume slider higher.
Test-play a sound: Choose Help➪About Volume Control from the menu. An
About dialog box appears. Now, try to click the Play Control window. The
computer should beep when you try to do this because the About window
is on top of the other one. That’s the easiest way to test the sound.
Click the OK button to close the About dialog box.
Adjust the sound levels as necessary and then close the Play Control dialog
box when you’re done playing with it.
Last stop: The Device Manager
Now you’re getting your elbows dirty. You need to summon the Device
Manager and examine the Sound, Video, and Game Controllers option. Follow
these steps:
1. Open the System icon in the Control Panel.
2. Click the Hardware tab in the System Properties dialog box.
3. Click the Device Manager button.
The Device Manager’s window appears.
Figure 10-2:

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
4. Open the item titled Sound, Video, and Game Controllers.
There, you see a list of anything having to do with sound in your com-
puter, as shown in Figure 10-3.
If you notice immediately a yellow circle flagging a particular device,
something is definitely wrong: Double-click to open the flagged device
and follow the information you see in that dialog box.
If the Device Manager’s seas are rather calm, you can always poke around.
5. Open the item for your computer’s sound card.
This is the tricky part: The name isn’t that obvious. In Figure 10-3, it’s
Creative AudioPCI blah blah blah, though a few other entries appear as
likely candidates. Don’t worry if you get this wrong the first time; you’re
just poking around.
When you’re successful, you see a Properties dialog box for your com-
puter’s sound system.
6. Click the Driver tab.
Even if you have no problems, sometimes it works like a charm to
replace or update the driver — the software that controls your com-
puter’s sound system. Clicking the Update Driver button does this, as
shown in Figure 10-4, though I recommend choosing that option only if
nothing has helped thus far.
The Update Driver button runs a wizard that helps you locate or install
a new driver for your sound system. Hopefully, that technique fixes the
problem.
7. Close all open windows when you’re done troubleshooting.

Anything else to check as far as sound goes?
If you have read through all the previous sections in this chapter, you have
completely shot all the potential trouble that could exist in your PC’s sound
system, from top to bottom. If the problem hasn’t been solved, return to the
speakers and start over again.
 For solutions to problems with playing a music CD, see the section in
Chapter 15 about CD-ROM catastrophes.
 If your problem is with playing a specific audio file, consider that the file
may be corrupted — or you may not have the proper software to play
that file.
Sounds to Scheme Over
As long as the sound software and hardware are, well, “sound,” you can do a
variety of things with sounds in Windows. It’s all controlled from the Control
Panel, through the Sounds and Audio Devices icon.
Figure 10-5 shows the Sounds tab in the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties
dialog box. You see a scrolling list of events to which you can assign sounds
in Windows.
For example, to play a specific sound when you get new mail, you scroll
through the list and find the New Mail Notification event. Click to select that
event, and the selected sound file appears in the dialog box. Click the Play
button to hear the sound or use the Browse button to pluck out a new sound.

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
If you go through the trouble of assigning your own, unique sounds to events,
do yourself a favor and save them to disk as a theme:
1. Click the Save As button.
2. Enter a name for your sound scheme.
Be Microsofty and call it My Sound Scheme.
3. Click the OK button.
Now, that scheme shows up on the list. Your stuff is saved!
If anything ever happens to your sounds, such as someone else messes with
them, you can instantly restore all of them at one time by choosing your
sound scheme from the drop-down list.
 If you don’t save your sounds as a scheme, you have to individually
restore each and every sound on the list.
 Check out some of the other available sound schemes, one of which may
only require subtle modification to become your personal sound scheme.
Other Sound Weirdness
You know what sounds weird? Lots of things! Read this section for some
sound weirdness cures and tonics.
Figure 10-5:
Controlling
your

“Sound gets suddenly loud!”
Holy smokes! That was loud!
When the computer suddenly grows thunderous on you, check the usual sus-
pects: the volume control in the system tray/notification area, volume knobs
on the speakers, and even the master volume control.
Then, check the program you’re running. Some games make their own sounds,
which means that the sound setting must be made in that game independently
of Windows. See the game’s options or settings to see whether you can reset
the sound level to something your neighbors would be more comfortable with.
The microphone gets muted
When using a microphone with a computer, you run into a potential problem:
The microphone may pick up the sound coming from the speakers. The result
is feedback, which can morph from a soft echo to a loud, piercing squeal!
To prevent feedback, you mute the microphone. The problem is that some
programs do that for you! The solution, unfortunately, is to use the master
volume control — keep that window open — so that you can unmute the mic
when you need it.
 You can also write to the software developer and ask that person to
include a nonmuting or unmute option for future releases of the program.
 Another nifty option is a microphone with an on-off switch on it so that
you can “hardware-mute” the thing.
 Refer to the section “Checking the master volume control,” earlier in this
chapter, for more information.
Annoying MIDI files play on 
Web pages or in e-mail
This is my own personal rant: I dislike sudden music coming from Web pages
or even e-mail. The music isn’t in the form of WAV files. It’s in the form of MIDI
files, which are files played over the computer’s internal synthesizer. I love
turning that option off so that the unexpected music doesn’t startle me.
143
Chapter 10: Sounds Like Trouble

To turn off MIDI music for your computer, mute the MIDI column in the
master volume control, as shown in Figure 10-2. Or, if you prefer to hear the
music, but not as loudly, just slip that volume slider down a tad. There.
 The MIDI column may be labeled SW Synth on some computers. That
stands for software synthesizer, which is essentially the same thing.
 If you don’t see the MIDI column, choose Options➪Properties in the Play
Control window. Scroll through the list to find the MIDI option and check
it. Click OK.
 MIDI sounds differ from WAV files just as sheet music differs from buying
a CD. WAV files are recorded (or generated) sounds. MIDI files just tell
the computer’s internal synthesizer to play various notes or instruments
for certain durations.
 And now you know that your computer has an internal synthesizer.
That stuttering sound
This problem is a puzzling one, but one I have experienced myself: The sound
playback seems choppy, or the sounds themselves stutter rather than play
smoothly. Alas, I have no specific solution, although it’s definitely a problem.
On my computer, I discovered that if I move the mouse while sound is play-
ing, the sound gets interrupted. The reason was a conflict between the mouse
software and the sound software; the sound “hardware” was really a software
emulator that pretended to be hardware. The solution was to upgrade to a
“real” sound card and disable the cheap motherboard sound.
To disable your computer’s onboard sound, run the Setup program when the
PC first starts. On one of the menus, you can find an option to disable the
onboard sound system. When there’s no option to disable the sound system
in the computer’s Setup program, you can use the Device Manager. Follow the
steps in the preceding section. After Step 4, choose the Disable option from
the Device Usage drop-down list, at the bottom of the General tab in the
Properties dialog box. Click OK to disable the onboard sound.
Then, install a third-party sound expansion card, or use one of those new
external USB sound systems. That should fix the stuttering.

F
ew can argue that computers are not technical. They’re — very technical!
Swirling around any computer is a maelstrom of technical terms and
jargon. Windows helps insulate you from such lingo so that you can use your
computer all day and never worry about the stack or the heap or any of sev-
eral dozen various buffers. But, one technical term pops up more than others:
That’s resource.
Because there’s an error message that goes something like “Resources are
low,” many people find themselves obsessing over resources. Logically, if
resources are low, you must endeavor to fill them up again. That’s when the
trouble starts — so much trouble that I have devoted this entire chapter to
help you troubleshoot and solve the low-resource quandary.
What Are System Resources?
After boiling the term system resource for several hours, to vent off all the
steam and impurities, what you’re left with is plain old memory. RAM. System
resources are simply one way your computer uses memory. The resources
part is what Windows uses the memory for: windows, icons, fonts, graphics,
and other pieces parts.

As you use Windows, it consumes resources. When you have several win-
dows open on the screen, they devour resources. Using lots of fonts? There
go the resources!
Some programs are real resource hogs. Microsoft Word is one. When Word
runs, it sets aside memory for oodles of resources — whether it needs them
or not.
Bottom line: When you run lots of programs, you use lots of resources. When
those resources get low, some programs may not be able to run. The quick
solution is to simply close a few programs and try again. Or, restarting
Windows often flushes out all the resources and lets you run the program.
Monitoring resources
In older versions of Windows, the System Monitor program was used to check
up on resources and see how much of them were left and what Windows was
using. In Windows XP, the System Monitor program has vanished, but you can
still check on resources. Here’s how:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Administrative Tools icon.
This step opens the Administrative Tools window, which is like another
Control Panel, but one that contains advanced toys for you to use to
seriously mess up your computer.
3. Open the Performance icon.
The Performance window opens, which displays a graphical chart of
how Windows is using some of the computer’s resources, as shown in
Figure 11-1.
In Figure 11-1, and most likely on your screen, the Performance window
is monitoring three resources: memory, disk usage, and microprocessor
usage. These are shown on the bottom of the window, each associated
with colors: yellow for Memory; blue for Physical Disk, and green for
Processor.
Try opening a few windows or popping up the Start menu to see how that
affects the graph being drawn — a real-life example of how resources are
used in windows.
4. Click the Add button to monitor additional resources.
Or, you can use the Ctrl+I keyboard shortcut. The Add Counters dialog
box appears, as shown in Figure 11-2.
146
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

5. Select resources to monitor in the Add Counters dialog box.
The Add Counters dialog box allows you to select which resources and
stuff to monitor. You select the resource from the drop-down list labeled
Performance Object. Then, select individual aspects of that resource
from the counters list, or just click All Counters to see everything.
Use the Explain button in the Add Counters dialog box to understand
what each item represents, though often the explanations are really
cryptic and designed only for the Vulcans or the Krell.

6. Click the Add button to add the specified resource.
For example, to further monitor memory usage, select Memory from the
Performance Object drop-down list and then select Available Bytes from
the counters list. Click the Add button. This action adds that item to the
System Monitor. (You may have to move the Add Counters dialog box
out of the way to see it.)
7. Close the Add Counters dialog box when you’re done.
Click the Close button.
8. Close the Performance window, as well as any other open windows,
when you’re done gawking.
There’s really nothing you can do in the Performance window other than
look. But, when you know what to look for, you can easily spot problems and
pinpoint solutions.
For example, if running one particular program causes all resources to sud-
denly dwindle, you know that there’s a great demand for resources in that
program.
Suppose that when you quit a certain program, you notice that the resources
are not reduced, meaning that the program isn’t releasing resources as it
quits. This is known as a memory leak, and it’s covered later in this chapter.
Perusing performance
Another place in Windows where you can monitor performance is the Task
Manager, which is a little easier to get at than the Performance window.
Specifically, the Performance tab in the Task Manager’s window is home to
a quick summary of key resource information in Windows, as shown in
Figure 11-3. Granted, it’s not as exciting or as interactive as the Performance
window (refer to Figure 11-1), but it does boil down the information to the
bare essentials.
The top chart monitors microprocessor (CPU) usage, similar to one of those
Boop machines that monitors heart patients in a hospital (though the Task
Manager does not go “boop”). This line represents the same information as
the Processor line in the Performance window.
The lower chart in the Task Manager/Performance window (refer to Figure 11-3)
shows page file usage, which tells you how often and how much stuff is being
written to or read from virtual memory. Increased activity here could show
signs of memory trouble.
148
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Below the two scrolling graphs are four areas of text information that look
really impressive, but I have no idea what it could all mean or what’s really
vital to watch. No, the real solution to the memory leak problem lies on the
Task Manager’s Processes tab, which is covered in the next section.
 Virtual memory is disk storage used to supplement regular memory, 
or RAM.
 If you want to see the CPU usage jump, open a few windows or play a
sound.

Chapter 11: The Mystery of System Resources (and Memory Leaks)
“Omigosh! My performance meter just 
suddenly and randomly spiked!”
Yeah, it does that. You can sit there and watch
your PC’s performance graph do nothing, and
then suddenly it peaks up and is very active. But
then, it returns back to where it was.
No, nothing is wrong. This behavior is entirely
normal for a computer. If you click the Processes
tab in the Windows Task Manager (refer to Figure
11-4, a little later in this chapter), you see dozens
of programs all running at once in your com-
puter. A performance spike simply means that
one of those programs went about doing its task 
and occupied the PC’s microprocessor for a 
wee amount of time. That goes on all the time. It 
doesn’t mean that your computer has a virus or a
worm; it’s just standard operations.

Leaky Memory
One thing the performance meters and various charts and gauges can help
you fix is a memory leak. This is a nasty problem that some programs have
where your computer’s resources are gradually or rapidly consumed, leaving
you with a slow or sluggish computer or a system that shuts down at odd or
inconvenient times. Fortunately, memory leaks can be fixed.
What’s a memory leak?
I remember a gag letter I wrote in to one of those Q&A computer columns in
the newspaper: “I think my computer may have a memory leak. Should I put
down a towel?” Ha-ha. I have heard jokesters telling naïve computer owners
to tape over the ports and holes in the back of a PC so that a memory leak
doesn’t happen. Ha-ha.
Leak is perhaps the wrong term. A better description is hole, or a place
where memory is poured in and never returns. And the hole grows larger
and hungrier — like children, but without that cuteness thing. Despite my
better descriptions, the leak jargon is still widely used.
A memory leak means one of two things. First, it could be a program that is
simply dead in memory. Windows cannot remove the program, so it just ropes
off that memory so that other programs don’t touch it. The memory is “occu-
pied,” but not being used; therefore, it’s wasted. The solution is to restart the
computer to free the dead memory, which is why you see the warning message
that tells you to restart Windows after a program has crashed.
The second type of memory leak is nasty. It happens when a program contin-
ues to use memory and cannot be stopped. For example, you close a program,
yet some small part of it remains in memory and consumes more of it. Over
time, the program uses up all the memory in the computer and everything
stops. That’s a true memory leak, and you can discover it by observing a
dwindling number of resources over time with no apparent cause.
The cure for the memory leak is to kill the program that’s consuming memory.
Hopefully, that frees up the used memory. If not, the only other cure is not to
run that program in the first place.
Tracking down a memory leak
Memory leaks are easily spotted on the Task Manager’s Processes tab. That
tab lists not only the major applications, but also every dang doodle program,
or process, the computer is running. Figure 11-4 shows a sample.
150
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Memory leaks are spotted on the list by noting a program that shows grow-
ing values in the CPU or Mem Usage columns. For example, if the Windows
Explorer program is crashing, you may notice that the Explorer.Exe Image
Name (program) on the list is using 25 percent CPU time, which suddenly
ticks up to 26 and then 27, yet you’re not doing anything on your computer.
To halt a process gone awry, click to select it and then click the End Process
button. You’re asked to confirm; click the Yes button. Then, when you have
control over your system again, restart Windows.
 If a program is running intensively, it shows a high value in the CPU
column. That’s normal. It’s only when a program uses more CPU time
than seems logical that you have a problem.
 Yes, the System Idle Process is busy when the system is idle.
 Be sure to reset after ending a process! If you don’t, remnants of the
process may interfere with the computer’s operation and lead to other
crashes.
 I have caught only one memory leak and fixed it in this manner (which is
more a credit to Windows than to me). The computer was being sluggish,
so I looked at the processes and noticed one hogging lots of CPU time.
Ending that process instantly made the computer peppy again. Still, I did
restart Windows, just to be sure.

Chapter 11: The Mystery of System Resources (and Memory Leaks)

Things You Can Do to Improve Resources
Rather than strive to improve your dismal resources situation, you should do
some healthy things to improve your computer’s overall performance. There’s
a link between resources and performance: Improving one improves the other.
Your system will never have 
100 percent free resources
Before discovering how to improve resources, understand this minor bit of
wisdom: Your system will never have 100 percent free sources.
To run Windows, you must use system resources. In fact, the only time you
could possibly have 100 percent free resources is when the computer is
turned off. Otherwise, something is always going on in the computer, which
consumes the resources.
Number-one strategy: Add more RAM!
Resources equal memory! Adding more memory to your computer fixes many
low-resource problems.
 A great place to purchase memory online is www.crucial.com. It’s not
the cheapest, but the memory is high quality, the Web site is excellent,
and the support is outstanding. I recommend the site and use it myself.
 Windows XP really needs about 256MB of memory to do well. However,
512MB or more is even better.
Remove excess fonts
Sure, you can have 10,000 fonts installed, but that definitely drains resources
and slows things down, to boot. The solution: Install only those fonts you 
regularly use.
For the rest of the fonts, either keep them on the CD-ROM they came in or
create an Excess Fonts folder, which you can store in the My Documents
folder. Just move into that folder the fonts you seldom use; move them as you
would cut and paste any file.
Don’t move system fonts out of the Fonts folder. Windows needs these fonts,
and if you copy them out, the computer doesn’t display information properly.
152
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

 System fonts are flagged with an A icon in the Fonts folder.
 You can get to the Fonts folder from the Control Panel; open the
Fonts icon.
 Also avoid moving the following fonts, which are often used by Web
pages:
• Arial
• Comic Sans MS
• Tahoma
• Times New Roman
• Trebuchet
• Verdana
153
Chapter 11: The Mystery of System Resources (and Memory Leaks)
What’s this virtual memory thing?
One key item that slows down all Windows
computers is their virtual memory. Having noth-
ing to do with virtue, virtual memory is simply
disk storage used to bolster physical memory,
or the RAM, in your computer.
When your computer has lots of RAM, virtual
memory isn’t a problem. But, when memory is
low, all that disk swapping can slow things
down. The solution is to add more RAM, but you
may also be able help the situation out a bit by
adjusting the virtual memory setting.
To get at the virtual memory settings, open the
Control Panel’s System icon. Click the Advanced
tab. Click the Settings button in the Performance
area. This action summons the Performance
options dialog box. Click the Advanced tab, and
then click the Change button in the Virtual
Memory area. At long last, you arrive at the
Virtual Memory dialog box, shown nearby.
The best option to select is the one labeled
System Managed Size. But, if you’re having lots
of paging problems and general sluggishness,
you may consider a manual setting that is much
higher. Situations like this one are rare in
Windows XP, mostly because the system-
managed size is fairly smart. So, apply wisdom
when you’re making your selection.
Be sure to properly close all open dialog boxes
and windows when you’re done fiddling.

Disable unneeded background programs
Background programs — such as antivirus utilities, disk optimizers, animated
desktops, and Active Desktop items — also consume resources. If resources
are low, consider disabling or halting such programs.
 Refer to the section in Chapter 8 about stopping programs from auto-
matically starting for more information on disabling programs.
 Also refer to the appendix to find information about running processes,
and which ones you need or can do away with.
Mind what you install; uninstall 
what you don’t use
If you’re like me, you occasionally download and install programs from the
Internet just to see what they do. If so, great. But, be mindful to uninstall the
program if you don’t use it.
All installed programs use resources. By uninstalling the program, you free
up those resources. So, occasionally scour your Program Files folder as well
as the Add/Remove Programs icon in the Control Panel. Look for programs
you no longer intend to use and uninstall them.
Uninstall the programs! Don’t succumb to the urge to simply delete them.
That strategy is wrong and causes big heaps of trouble later.
I recommend the CleanSweep utility, from the Norton people. It’s perhaps the
best tool you can use to completely uninstall older programs.

The Slow PC
In This Chapter
 Getting to know slow
 Dealing with a slow computer
 Tips for improving speed
 Some slow computer Q&A
O
ne welcome feature in a new computer is its speed; new computers are
notably faster than the ones they replace. The speed difference is attrib-
uted to technology, of course. Replacing a tired old Pentium III computer with
a Pentium 4, for example, makes everything run faster — or at least seem to.
The problem with a slow PC isn’t that technology is brushing by. That’s more
of a fact than a problem. No, the true slow PC is sluggish for a number of rea-
sons, some of which definitely can be helped, as discussed in this chapter.
 See Chapter 17 for information on improving slow Internet connections.
 I recommend drinking coffee for slow mornings or to help your own
brain maintain speed during long meetings. I don’t recommend coffee for
your computer.
Slow Is Relative
Computers aren’t designed to be slow. In fact, if you were to peer into a tiny
window and observe the microprocessor, you would discover that it spends
most of its time doing nothing. It waits. That’s because most things the com-
puter does aren’t that speed intensive.
When you word-process, the computer spends electronic epochs waiting for
you to type the next letter — even if you’re a fast typist. And, no matter how
fast your Internet connection, the computer is literally twiddling its thumbs
while waiting for the next byte of data to stroll in.

There are intensive operations, of course: Any time you manipulate graphics,
you’re making the computer do some real work. Even the fastest computers
have to wait while images are rendered. And, some mathematical calculations
cause the microprocessor to fire all its burners. Even then, for the most part,
the computer sits and hums.
 It’s because the computer sits and waits that you find things like barking
dogs or tap-dancing wizards to amuse you while you type in your word
processor.
 Speed apparently isn’t a true issue when it comes to computer perfor-
mance. Developers could make software go even faster than it does now,
but there’s little demand for it. Also, increasing program speed would
mean that the programs would take longer to develop, so as long as
people don’t mind waiting, developers have no incentive to make things
faster.
Why things can get slow (and what 
you can do about it)
Your computer can slow down for a number of reasons, almost too many to
mention. Slothfulness boils down to one of the causes listed in this section:
Malfunctioning hardware: The hard drive may be on its last legs, in which
case it has to read and reread information because of errors. That adds 
overhead.
Corrupted programs: Most sudden slowness is caused by some corrupt pro-
gram, which may be tainted on the disk or somehow become besmirched in
memory. In any event, the program’s response time dwindles, which affects
overall PC speed.
Viruses: Computer viruses can also slow things down, either by corrupting
existing files or consuming resources in memory or on the hard drive, or they
may just be designed to slow down your computer.
Most of the time, some corrupt program brings the computer down and
crawling on its knees. Fix or eliminate that program, and the problem goes
away. Typically, recovering speed is simply as easy as restarting Windows.
Please be patient! Yes, restarting Windows probably fixes the situation. But,
give the slow computer its due. Obey the rules! Shut down like you normally
do, even if it seems to take longer. Give the computer a chance before you
impatiently punch the power switch or defiantly unplug the sucker.
156
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

 Corrupt programs may be spotted by their memory leaks. Refer to
Chapter 11.
 Refer to Chapter 2 for information on restarting Windows, the penicillin
to cure most PC ills.
 Sluggish hardware needs to be fixed or replaced. Alas, there’s no easy
way to spot sluggish hardware, which tends to get slower over time.
 Some third-party utilities, such as Norton, have various disk-diagnosing
programs that can indicate pending hard drive doom.
 Also check with the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the Web to see whether
the slowness can be attributed to any known flaws in Windows or other
Microsoft products: http://support.microsoft.com/.
 Little-known fact: A hard drive can misread data on a disk up to three
times before it reports an error. The operating system itself can tolerate
as many as five errors of this type before it reports a problem with the
drive.
Any way to speed things up?
The old joke went that you could double your computer’s speed by plugging
it into a 240-volt socket. I actually got e-mail from a man who believed this to
be true and wanted to know where he could get a power adapter. Of course,
following through would have resulted in a blown-up power supply.
Computers do some things fast and some things slow. Aside from getting a
newer computer, you can do only a handful of legitimate things to improve
overall performance:
 Eliminate what you don’t need. Uninstall programs you don’t use.
 Review your startup programs, as covered in Chapter 8. Ensure that 
utilities you don’t need are disabled and not using RAM or disk space.
 Install more RAM. Computers can always use more RAM.
 Check for viruses.
 Keep an eye out for memory leaks.
 Defragment (especially good for older drives).
In your applications, try to avoid using lots of fonts or pasting images into
a word processor until the text editing is done. Word processors, such as
Microsoft Word, really slow down when you add graphics into the mix. Write
your text first and then add images.
157
Chapter 12: The Slow PC

For image editing as well as other demanding applications, try not to run
other programs at the same time. That conserves resources and gives more
power to the programs that demand it.
Above all, try to avoid software fixes that claim to speed up your computer.
Although some of them may subtly tweak resources and give you better per-
formance, most of the ones I have encountered are shams. These programs
seldom perform as promised and end up turning your PC into a billboard for
endless advertisements or porn.
 I don’t recommend upgrading the microprocessor as a solution to a slow
PC. Older PCs that could theoretically benefit from a newer CPU are 
typically not compatible with the new microprocessors. And, the replace-
ment CPUs you can get often don’t give you the same bang for the buck
as a better upgrade, such as more RAM or a second hard drive.
 Also refer to Chapter 11, on system resources. Low resources can also
cause a system to run slowly.
 See Chapter 23 for more information on defragmenting a hard drive.
 Internally, the computer uses only 5 or 12 volts to run things, so doubling
the input voltage from 120 to 240 volts — even if you could — wouldn’t
improve your speed situation.
Some Slow Q&A
Anyone who has used a PC for any length of time has encountered the slow
PC. After initial disbelief, you probably act like I do and seriously wonder
whether a black hole is nearby and slowing down the entire space-time 
continuum.
Do you slam your keyboard into the desktop? I have tried it. Doesn’t work.
And, yes, a few times I just flipped off the power to the UPS because the com-
puter was taking geological time to restart. I know. Naughty me, but sometimes
the stupid device wears my patience paper-thin.
Q: It’s suddenly slow, and it wasn’t like that yesterday!
Sudden slow is good. Sudden slow means that some program has twisted
itself into a confusing garden of electronic salad. A simple reset fixes this
problem.
In Windows XP, try checking the Task Manager’s Processes tab to see
whether you can find the process hog and kill it off. At least that method
tells you which program was running amok, if only for future reference.
Refer to Chapter 11.
158
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

I have noticed that some USB devices may fly south and attempt to take other
USB devices with them. For example, the scanner may be on the fritz, and
so the USB keyboard no longer responds quickly. Consider disconnecting
(from the computer) the USB devices that you’re not using and see whether
that improves the situation.
Q: The computer is just always slow.
Remember that speed is relative. Or, as it was put to me long ago by a friend
with a much better computer: You never know how crappy your system is
until you sit down at a better one.
 Buy more RAM!
 Consider running fewer programs.
 Also consider using a thorough disk drive analysis utility, such as Norton
Utilities, to see whether the hard drive is becoming too errorprone. If so,
consider replacing the hard drive.
Q: The computer gets slower the longer I leave it on.
This is definitely a sign of a memory leak. The best way to track this one
down is as follows:
 First, don’t run any software. Just let the computer sit and stew. Note
whether it’s getting slow. If so, it’s Windows itself that’s slow, one of the
supersecret startup programs (refer to Chapter 8) or perhaps a virus
that’s causing the problem.
 Second, run your programs one at a time. Pause. Note whether that
particular program is causing the computer to slow down. If not, restart
the computer and run your next program. Run them one at a time to
search for the culprit.
When you find the program that’s slowing down the computer, check with the
developer to see whether it has any information about causes or fixes. Refer
to Chapter 5 for more information on tech support.
Q: The computer has gotten slower and slower in recent weeks.
This problem is most likely caused by some nasty programs infiltrating your
computer, such as a virus or worm or spyware. These programs consume
resources and run without your knowledge, so it isn’t readily obvious what’s
to blame for the slowdown.
See Chapter 24 for information on tools to fight viruses and spyware.
159
Chapter 12: The Slow PC

Another problem may be hardware-oriented. A full hard drive can slow down
a computer. To check the hard drive’s capacity, follow these steps:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Right-click the hard drive you want to examine.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
On the General tab, you see a graphical pie chart showing you the
amount of disk space used versus what’s remaining, as shown in
Figure 12-1. When only a little pie is left, you’ve got disk woes!
4. Close the Properties dialog box as well as the My Computer window.
Refer to Chapter 23 for more information on what you can do to help remedy
a full hard drive.
Slowness can also just be a sign of “tired RAM” or an older computer in gen-
eral. It’s time to buy a new one.
Q: The computer’s clock is slower than normal time.
Yes. Computers make lousy clocks. The clock in your typical PC is off anywhere
from several seconds to a few minutes at the end of each day, depending on
what you do with the computer. This is normal.

In Windows XP, you can configure the computer to automatically set the time:
In the Control Panel, open the Date and Time icon to display the Date and
Time Properties dialog box. Then, click the Internet Time tab to see some-
thing that looks like Figure 12-2.
To synchronize your PC’s clock with a live time server, click the Update
Now button. (You must put a check mark by the option Automatically
Synchronize with an Internet Time Server for that button to work.) Click OK
when you’re done.
 The best atomic and Internet clock utilities can be set to automatically
dial or connect at specific times every day, which keeps the clock very
current.
 If your computer is on a local-area network, check with your network
administrator about time servers you can use to keep the PC’s clock
accurate.

W
hat do the keyboard, monitor, and mouse all have in common?
Anyone? Anyone?
Yes! They comprise the PC’s basic input and output, the old I/O. Remember
those songs you used to sing in computer camp? Well, perhaps not. In any
case, the keyboard is the primary way you (the human) communicate with
the computer. Supplementing that, of course, is the mouse. And, the com-
puter communicates back to you by using text or images displayed on the
monitor.
Without a keyboard, mouse, or monitor, your computer would have to 
communicate with you via its flashing lights or beeping speaker. You
(the human) could always kick the computer, but that has rarely been an
effective communications technique.
Therefore, all three of these devices — keyboard, mouse, and monitor —
have similar troubleshooting issues, problems, and resolutions: Hence, this
combined chapter.
 This book assumes that you are human or, if visiting from elsewhere,
that you’re assuming human form.
 In 1978, a divider was installed beneath the table to prevent the world
chess champion Anatoly Karpov and the challenger Viktor Korchnoi
from kicking each other during the match.

The Best Way to Tell Whose Fault It Is
When it comes to the keyboard, mouse, or monitor, a common question pops
up: Is the device itself or the computer to blame? For example, is your mouse
itself wacky, or is it the mouse port or the motherboard or mouse software?
The easy way to find out is to swap it out.
First, turn off the computer.
Second, remove the device that’s causing trouble — the keyboard or mouse
or monitor. Set it aside.
Third, install a working replacement device. It can be a keyboard, mouse, or
monitor from another computer or a friend’s computer. Ensure that you know
the device is working properly.
Fourth, turn on the computer and see whether the device works. If the
swapped-in component works just fine, you have solved your problem:
Replace the keyboard, mouse, or monitor with something that works.
 Keyboards and mice are relatively inexpensive to replace.
 Before replacing, see other sections in this chapter for some potential
solutions to keyboard and mouse problems.
 You can try having your monitor fixed, especially if it’s a high-end model.
Most TV repair places can fix computer monitors.
 Never try to fix the monitor yourself, even if you have the proper
footwear. Monitors and PC power supplies are two things you should
never disassemble or otherwise mess with.
 Or — what the heck? — toss that old CRT monitor and get yourself a
fancy new LCD monitor.
 There’s no need to turn off the computer if your mouse or keyboard
(or even the monitor) is a USB device. You can plug or unplug any USB
device without damaging the computer.
 Never plug a mouse or keyboard into the standard mouse or keyboard
port when the PC is on. Doing so can damage the keyboard, mouse, or
computer.
 You can plug a monitor in or out from a working computer. I have done
it a few times. But I feel better about turning the thing off whenever I
attach or detach any hardware.

Keyboard Kraziness
Keyboards don’t have the run-amok potential of other computer peripherals.
I think that the reason they stay so well-behaved is that they know how
cheap replacement models are. So, unless your hands weigh 75 pounds each,
your computer’s keyboard will most likely outlive just about anything else on
the computer.
 A simple reset should cure most keyboard strangeness, such as one key
producing another key’s character.
 Keyboard-mapping and macro programs are available, such as QuicKeys,
from CE Software, Inc. (www.cesoft.com/). You can use them to cus-
tomize keyboard behavior as well as assign lots of text or complex 
commands to simple key combinations.
The keyboard’s Control Panel home
Any messing or adjusting of the keyboard is done in the Control Panel by
opening the Keyboard icon (see Figure 13-1). This area is where you adjust
things such as the keyboard’s repeat delay and repeat rate.
 The repeat delay is how long you have to hold a key down before its
character is repeated.
 The repeat rate is how quickly the character is repeated.
Figure 13-1:
The official

166
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
According to Figure 13-1, pressing and holding the P key down after a short
delay quickly prints a bunch of Ps: ppppppppppppppppppppppp. (Supposedly,
that’s how kitty cats do it.)
The language problem
You can configure your keyboard to mimic the behavior of foreign language
keyboards. For example, in France, they have keys on the keyboard for the ç
and Ç keys. In the United Kingdom, Shift+3 produces the £ character rather
than #. And many foreign language keyboard layouts have “dead keys,” which
are used for diacritical marks, such as ü or á, or are just not used for anything.
All this foreign language nonsense is controlled through the Control Panel’s
Regional and Language Options icon. If you suspect that your keyboard is
misbehaving in a strange, foreign manner, check its language.
Open the Control Panel’s Regional and Language Options icon. Click the
Languages tab, and then click the Details button. You see the Text Services
and Input Languages dialog box, beautifully depicted in Figure 13-2.
Choose the keyboard layout you want to use from the Default Input Language
drop-down list.
To add new layouts, use the Add button.
Click OK to close the various dialog boxes after you have made your choices.
Figure 13-2:
Here’s
where you

layouts.

167
Chapter 13: Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor Dilemmas
The Language toolbar then appears on the taskbar, which is how you control
the various languages and keyboard layouts, as shown in Figure 13-3. You
can click the language button (labeled EN in Figure 13-3) to switch between
languages and layouts.
When the Language bar is visible, you can use the keyboard’s left Shift+Alt
keyboard combination to switch languages and layouts. You notice that the
two-letter button changes each time you press left Shift+Alt. For example, it
changes from EN (English) to ES (Spanish).
Mouse Mayhem
I once wrote “You need a mouse to use Windows.” Well, you kinda do. I have
discovered that many things done with a mouse — especially with regard to
clicking menus and buttons — can be done faster with keyboard shortcuts.
But, that’s another story. If the mouse doesn’t work, I would bet that you
would rather keep using the mouse as opposed to train yourself how to use
keyboard shortcuts, whether they’re faster or not.
Give me mouse control!
Most common mouse options (speed, pointer appearance, and special
effects, for example) are set by using the Mouse icon in the Control Panel.
Alas, the options and settings and their locations vary depending on which
type of mouse you have, so some poking around in the Mouse Properties
dialog box (see Figure 13-4) may be required in order for you to discover
which settings need adjustment.
 If you have trouble seeing the mouse, select a new mouse pointer from
the Mouse Properties dialog box. The Pointers tab is the place to look.
 The mouse can be made left-handed, if you like. Refer to either the
Buttons or General tab for the details.
 For more mouse configuration information, refer to my book, PCs For
Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).

Common mouse maladies and cures
Most mouse mishaps can be cured with a simple restart of Windows. Why
does the mouse go nuts? I don’t know. But whenever my mouse pointer is
missing or the mouse freezes or just acts plain weird, restarting Windows
solves the problem.
If you have a USB mouse, unplugging the USB connection and plugging it in
again sometimes wakes the mouse back up.
If restarting doesn’t work, check the Device Manager, which displays any con-
flicts and offers some fixes or suggestions. Here’s what to do:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the System icon.
3. Click the Hardware tab.
4. Click the Device Manager button.
The Device Manager window lists all your PC’s hardware, as shown in
Figure 13-5. The item labeled Mice and Other Pointing Devices contains
information about your computer’s mouse.
5. Open the item named Mice and Other Pointing Devices.
You see beneath that item an entry for every mouse or pointing device
installed on your computer. (Yes, you can have more than one.)
The first thing to notice here is whether the mouse hardware is flagged
with a yellow circle and exclamation point. If so, the hardware has defi-
nitely gone haywire; continue with Step 6 to see what specifically is wrong.
Figure 13-4:

169
Chapter 13: Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor Dilemmas
6. Open your mouse’s hardware entry to see its Properties dialog box.
The Mouse’s Properties dialog box appears. Any known trouble is listed
in the Device status area. You can also use the Troubleshoot button on
the General tab to help diagnose mouse maladies.
If you need to change the mouse’s device driver, click the Driver tab and
then click the Update Driver button. Heed the wizard’s instructions to
properly reinstall or update the mouse driver.
7. Close the Properties dialog box, Device Manager, and other open win-
dows when you’re done.
In my travels, rarely have I had to install any specific mouse device drivers.
It’s really Windows itself that controls the mouse. The only reason to reinstall
or update a mouse driver would be to use any special, nonstandard features
on the mouse, such as extra buttons or “Internet” buttons.
Oh, and those wacky nonstandard mice — including the infamous 3D flying
mouse — they need their own software to do their tricks.
 Mouse pointer jumping around? Hard to control? See “Cleaning the
mouse,” later in this chapter.
 Your laptop’s mouse is typically a touchpad. Yes, you can install an
external mouse on your laptop, in which case it sports two pointing
devices.
 You can find software for the various breeds of the Microsoft mouse at
the Microsoft download center, at www.microsoft.com/downloads/.
 Logitech mouse support is on the Web at www.logitech.com/.

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
Your mouse is getting s-l-o-w
Mice can slow down if they’re dirty. Consider cleaning your mouse, as dis-
cussed later in this chapter. A more common cause is simply age. Old mice
slow down. They get crappy. They break. Kaput.
If the mouse is older than about four years (sometimes not even that old)
and it’s getting frustratingly slow, replace it. Buy a new mouse. That fixes the
problem.
Beyond fixing the slow mouse problem, nothing is more satisfying than
repeatedly pounding the mouse into the table with an aggressive fist.
Monitor Madness
Monitors are possibly the most peaceful of computer peripherals. Unless, of
course, you’re watching a science fiction TV show from the 1960s. In that
case, the monitor is most likely the thing that explodes whenever the com-
puter becomes confused. But that’s mere fiction! Ha-ha.
Monitors don’t explode. They implode. And, that’s only the CRT (cathode ray
tube) type of monitor. LCD monitors don’t explode or implode. But, the CRT
monitor’s glass encloses a vacuum. If you poke a hole in the monitor’s glass —
thwoop! — implosion. I don’t feel that I need to devote any space here to trou-
bleshooting that problem.
Beyond the rare CRT implosion, your monitor rarely, if ever, screws up. No, it’s
the image on the screen that bugs you most of the time. Those problems are
covered in Chapter 6, in the section about the display being stuck in dumb
mode. For now, here’s a small assortment of monitor hardware problems:
The monitor buzzes or hums. Monitors buzz and hum naturally. Loud hum-
ming can be a problem, however. If the humming distracts you from doing
your work, repair or replace the monitor.
Connections get loose. If the image is missing or appears in all one color or
“weak,” check the monitor cable. Ensure that one end is snugly plugged into
the monitor and that the other end is snugly plugged into the PC.
The image is distorted. This could be a sign of interference from some other
electronic device. Strong magnetic fields can distort the image on a monitor.
If the monitor is exposed for long periods, the magnets damage the monitor
permanently. To fix this problem, move the monitor away from whatever is
causing the interference.

171
Chapter 13: Keyboard, Mouse, and Monitor Dilemmas
The image gets fuzzy. Monitors lose their crispness over time. The sure sign
of an old monitor is a fuzzy image. If the image doesn’t improve the longer
the monitor stays on, retire the monitor and get another.
Another way to fix a fuzzy, flickering, or generally frazzled monitor is to
adjust the refresh rate. You can use the buttons on the front of the monitor
or change the screen’s resolution or number of colors.
The monitor is only half of your PC’s graphical equation. The other half is the
graphics adapter or hardware inside the PC’s console. If the monitor checks
out okay but the image is still ga-ga, suspect the graphics adapter. You can
tell by trying out another monitor on your computer. (Remember: Swap out to
test!) If the other monitor is ga-ga, you know that the graphics adapter hard-
ware needs replacing. You may want to have a technician or your dealer swap
you in a newer, better graphics adapter.
A Time to Clean
Another thing that the keyboard, mouse, and monitor have in common is that
they’re easy to clean. And — boy! — is that ever necessary. I have been using
the same keyboard for almost 14 years now. Although the robust sucker has
lasted me through five different computers, it’s just filthy! Time to clean:
 The best way to keep your stuff clean is not to eat in front of your com-
puter. I know that’s a hard admonishment to keep. (I’m typing this with
one hand as I dig into a bowl of peanuts with the other.)
 Also, if you sneeze, cover your mouth and nose so that nothing ends up
on the screen.
 Smoking? Bad for the computer. And you.
 Keep cats away from computers. Computer mice attract cat hair, and it
eventually screws up the mice. Cat hair also loves to stick to the monitor.
 Yes, I like my keyboard. I have two more just like it for when this one
breaks. It’s an IBM keyboard from the early 1990s. Metal. Heavy. Full
action. Hearty click noise.
Yes, you can clean your keyboard
They’re hard to find, but when you see one of those tiny keyboard vacuum
cleaners, get it! It deftly sucks the dirt, crud, hair, and potato chip chunks
from the inner crevices of your keyboard.

172
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
One good way to clean the keyboard: Flip it over and give it a good, vigorous
“You’ve been naughty” shake. Have a whisk broom and dustpan handy to dis-
pose of the results of this action.
Another good way to clean between the keys of your keyboard is with a blast
of air. No, don’t let Uncle Dale use his air compressor. Instead, go to an office
supply store and get a can of compressed air. A few shots help blow all that
stuff out of the keyboard.
To clean the key caps, use an old toothbrush — or if you’re angry with your
spouse, use their toothbrush — and some household cleaner, like 409 or
Fantastik. It you can stand the smell, ammonia is perhaps the best key cap
cleaner. Put the cleaner on the toothbrush and then brush away at the key
caps. Don’t use much liquid because it drips into the keyboard’s guts.
Finally, in a last desperate step, you can give your keyboard a bath. For exam-
ple, if you spill orange soda pop into the keyboard, try to save matters by
bathing the keyboard. First, turn off the computer. Second, unplug the key-
board. Third, immerse it in some warm, soapy water. Let it sit for a spell.
Then remove the keyboard and let it drain. Keep it out overnight so that it’s
utterly dry when you reconnect it. If it doesn’t work, that’s okay; at least you
gave it your best shot. Buy a new keyboard.
Cleaning the mouse
Mice pick up crud from your desktop or mouse pad and, boy, does that really
gum up the works!
For a traditional mouse, remove the ball from its belly to clean it. A cover
twists off so that you can remove the ball. Rub the ball with a damp cloth,
though the real filth is on the rollers that detect the ball’s movement.
To carefully clean the rollers, get an X-Acto knife and a pair of tweezers.
Carefully scrape the gunk away from the rollers by using the X-Acto knife.
The gunk generally comes off in large chunks, which you can then extract
using the tweezers. Replace the ball when you’re done cleaning.
Optical mice get dirty too! To clean them, use a pair of tweezers to pull out
the hair and gunk in the optical mouse’s “eyehole.” In fact, any time an opti-
cal mouse gets weird on you, flip it over and clean the eyehole. Chances are
that a strand of hair is wreaking havoc with the LED sensor.
 While you’re at it, clean your mousepad as well as the mouse. Use a stiff
brush to clean the cloth pads. Or, heck, just toss the old pad out and get
a new one.
 If cleaning doesn’t help, get a new mouse.

Cleaning your monitor
The only part of the monitor worthy of cleanliness is the screen — the part
where information is displayed. Sure, you could clean the monitor’s housing,
but rarely have I seen that done, nor is it even necessary (unless you opt to
clean off that dandelion-like effect all those yellow sticky notes have).
Start by spraying some window cleaner on a soft cloth. Then, use the cloth
to gently wipe the sneeze globs and bits of bean dip from the front of the
monitor. This action works for both glass and LCD monitors, though you
should be especially gentle on LCD monitors because they really do have
liquid inside them.
 Never spray cleaning solution directly on the screen.
 It helps to have a nice, bright yet plain image on the screen while you
clean. I open up the Paint program and fill the screen with a nice, white
palette so that I can see all the gunk on the monitor.
 For cleaning LCD monitors, I recommend a substance called Klear
Screen, from Meridrew Enterprises (www.klearscreen.com).
 On the other hand, dust disappears unless you turn the monitor off. If
you’re just doing a good dust job, turn the monitor off and you see all
that “pixel dust.”

Printer Problems
In This Chapter
 Getting to know printer trouble
 Using Print Preview
 Finding key printing spots in Windows
 Fixing various printer maladies
 Stopping a print job
 Taking care of general printer maintenance
T
hough a printer is considered part of the basic computer system, it’s
really a device all unto itself, complete with its own assortment of demons
and vices. This is one reason that printers are always packaged separately,
unlike some computers where the monitor or keyboard may be integrated
into the console. You see, because it’s a separate device, it’s far easier to fling
an unruly printer out of a high window. I believe that was part of the original
design, and it’s good to see that after 25 years of personal computing, the
separate printer unit remains a standard today.
Printer problems can come in many areas, so it’s one of the tougher things
to troubleshoot. The problem could be in Windows, your application, the
printer’s cable, or the silly printer itself. This chapter helps you narrow down
the potential culprits and then shoot the appropriate trouble.
So Is It the Printer?
You can easily tell whether the problem is with the printer or the software
you’re using: Does the problem happen when you print from the one program
or from all of them?
If every program has the same printer problem, it’s a printer problem, with
either the printer hardware or the printer software (the driver). If it’s only
one program that can’t print, the problem is with that particular piece of soft-
ware. Contact that software developer — ignore its vain attempts to shuttle
you off to the printer manufacturer — and get the problem solved.

Your best friend, Print Preview
When the printer acts up or the hard copy looks strange, don’t blame the
printer first! Double-check to see that the printer isn’t just blindly obeying
your orders by using the application’s Print Preview command, File➪Print
Preview.
How does the document look in Print Preview? How are the colors? The mar-
gins? The fonts?
If the screw-up is visible in the Print Preview window, blame yourself or the
application. If Print Preview looks like you intended, blame the printer driver
or the printer itself. Read on!
 Hard copy is another term for the stuff that comes out of the printer —
printed information as opposed to information on the screen.
 The Print Preview command has a companion toolbar button in many
applications.
 Not every program has a Print Preview command.
176
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
It helps to know this painful information 
on how printing works
Printing happens in a PC like this: You give the
command to print, Ctrl+P. That tells the applica-
tion to print the document. But, it’s not the appli-
cation itself that does the printing. Instead,
instructions are passed along to something
called the printer driver.
The printer driver is a part of the operating
system, installed when you first set up
Windows. The driver’s job is to control the
printer, by telling it what to print. So, although
some things — document content, margins,
colors, and styles, for example — are controlled
by your application, it’s the printer driver
common to all of Windows that’s really in
charge of the printing job.
As the printer driver takes over, a wee little
“printer guy” icon shows up in the system
tray/notification area (on the right end of the
taskbar).
The printer driver’s job is to talk directly with the
printer and send it the proper instructions that
tell it to print what you want. Hopefully, if all
goes well, your stuff gets put down on paper
and you become O So Very Happy with the
results.
After the document is printed, the printer driver
goes back to sleep and the wee printer-guy icon
disappears from the system tray/notification
area.
Problems? They can occur anywhere along the
line. Having a general idea of how the process
works, however, can help you pinpoint who or
what is to blame.

 Graphics applications in particular seem to lack a Print Preview com-
mand. That’s because the graphics image you see on the screen is 
supposed to be identical to the one that’s printed.
Controlling the printer from 
your application
The printer, like all hardware, is dumb all by itself. It needs your carefully
guided instructions to tell it what and how to print. That’s the job of the Print
dialog box, but also the Page Setup dialog box in most applications.

Figure 14-1 shows the Page Setup dialog box for the Paint application in
Windows.
The Page Setup dialog box in other applications contains similar commands,
though often more of them and perhaps organized a bit differently. Typically,
you can set the following items in the Page Setup dialog box:
 Margins: These define the area where printing takes place. Most printers
require a minimum half-inch margin, either 1⁄2 or 1⁄4 inch, inset from the
edge of the paper.
 Paper size: Most often, you print on letter-size paper, but this spot is
where you tell both the application and the printer that you’re printing
on another size of paper, such as legal or envelope.
 Paper source: Some printers have different trays for different sizes of
paper. Or, if the paper is manually fed into the printer, that’s where you
set that option.
 Orientation: You have only two choices: normal, which is called Portrait
orientation, or long-ways, which is called Landscape orientation.
 Layout options: These settings can include options for binding, center-
ing the page, scaling the image (larger or smaller), headers, footers, and
multiple pages per sheet.
Not every application has a Page Setup dialog box. In some applications, the
only control you have over printing is with the Print dialog box, a sample of
which is shown in Figure 14-2.
Figure 14-1:
Various
printer
options 
in the 
Page Setup
dialog box.
178
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Yes, you find additional printing options here:
 Select a printer: Windows affords you the luxury of using one of any
number of computers, either directly connected to your PC or via a net-
work. It’s in the Print dialog box that you choose which printer you want
to print on.
 Configure the printer: The Print dialog box is a part of Windows, but it
typically contains extra tabs or an Advanced, Properties, or Preferences
button (refer to Figure 14-2) that lets you set custom printing options,
such as graphics resolution, color settings, printer language, and other
often trivial settings.
 Choose the pages to print: Normally, you print all the pages, though the
Print dialog box lets you select a single page, individual pages, or ranges
of pages to print.
 Select the number of copies: You can also print multiple copies of the
same document. When I create my annual Christmas letter, I specify sev-
eral dozen copies to print, one for everyone on the list.
 Collation and other options: Each Print dialog box is different, with dif-
ferent options and settings depending on the printer or application. An
option common to many of them is collation, which prints multiple copies
either one page at a time (seven Page 1s followed by seven Page 2s) or 
in sets (Pages 1 through 5 and then another set of Pages 1–5). Another
option is printing in reverse order, which is nice if the copies come out
of the printer face-up.
Figure 14-2:
Options in
the Print
dialog box.
179
Chapter 14: Printer Problems

The Page Setup and Print dialog boxes are two places you can use to config-
ure your printer from your application. Of course, after you click the Print
button (in the Print dialog box), control passes to the printer driver. So, any
problems from that point on are blamed on the driver itself or on the printer,
as covered in the rest of this chapter.
 Setting the page margins isn’t the same thing as setting paragraph margins
inside a word processor. Refer to your word processor’s Help system for
more margin information, or just read the best book on Microsoft Word
ever written, my own Word For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
 Yes, many applications switch options between the Print and Page Setup
dialog boxes. In some programs, you select paper orientation in the Page
Setup dialog box; in other programs, you do that in the Print dialog box.
 Selecting a printer other than the default, or main, printer may affect the
outside margins on a page. If so, you have to print again, by returning to
the Page Setup dialog box to fix your margins.
 Acquaint yourself with some of your printer’s more esoteric options. If
additional tabs are in the Print dialog box or if you see a Properties or
Preferences button there, click it to peruse those extra options.
 Be especially observant of the location where you can turn color print-
ing on or off for a color printer. For example, the printer chosen in
Figure 14-2 is a color printer, yet the option for printing in color isn’t
apparent in the dialog box. Therefore, the option must lie elsewhere,
such as behind that Preferences button.
 Some applications may also have a Document Setup or Page Setup com-
mand on the File menu. You can find additional page-configuration items
in that dialog box.
 Which dialog box has priority? The Print dialog box does. Any changes
you make there directly affect the printer. Oftentimes, however, some
coordination is required between the Page Setup and Print dialog boxes.
For example, if you’re printing in Landscape mode, you need to tell both
the application (via the Page Setup dialog box) and the printer (via the
Print dialog box) to print in that mode and on that paper.
Envelope printing tips
The best way to print an envelope is to use a program that’s designed to print
envelopes! After all, a specialist knows more about their specialty than the
jack-of-all-trades. For example, the Envelope printing tool in Microsoft Word
is a great way to print envelopes. But, printing an envelope on the fly in
something like WordPad takes skill and, well, knowledge of the following
pointers:
180
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

 Know that an envelope is merely a specialized type of paper. Specifically,
in the USA, envelopes are known as number 10 or Envelope #10. If you
choose that type of “paper” in the Page Setup dialog box, your document
automatically formats itself to envelope dimensions.
 Use the Print Preview command to see how the envelope paper is ori-
ented on the page. You want to ensure that this orientation matches
how the envelope is fed into the printer.
 Use the program’s margin settings (the paragraph margins, not the page
margins) to set the locations for the address and return address.
 Use Print Preview again to determine that you have placed the address
and return address in the proper position and orientation.
 Pay special attention to how the printer eats envelopes (which side is
“up” and how the text gets positioned, for example).
 Print a test envelope first. Better still, mark which end of the envelope
went into the printer first and which side of the envelope was “up.” 
That way, you can confirm that the envelope was inserted in the proper
orientation.
Where the Printer Stuff 
Hides in Windows
To properly futz with a printer in Windows, you need to know where these
printer things are and what they do:
 The Printers and Faxes folder
 Your printer’s window
 The little printer guy
Each one has something to do with printing, as described in this section.
Finding the Printers and Faxes folder
The Printers and Faxes folder is where Windows stores information about all
the printers connected to your computer, either directly or indirectly. This
folder is where you can add new printers, though in Windows, printers on
your computer network are added automatically. It’s also the location for any
fax modems you may have on your computer, considering how faxing works a
lot like printing.
181
Chapter 14: Printer Problems

To open the Printers and Faxes folder, open the Printers and Faxes icon in the
Control Panel. You may also be able to find this item on the main Start button
menu panel thing. Either way, the Printers and Faxes folder you see looks
similar to Figure 14-3.
You can do several things in the Printers and Faxes folder as far as trouble-
shooting is concerned:
 Click the Troubleshoot printing link to run a Windows troubleshooter
for your printer. This item is found in the See Also task pane, on the left
side of the Printers and Faxes window.
 Open your printer’s Properties dialog box: Right-click your printer’s
icon and choose Properties from the pop-up menu. This method is
good for adjusting and tweaking the printer. You can also print a test
page from the dialog box.
 Instantly halt printing by right-clicking your printer icon and choosing
Pause Printing from the pop-up menu. See the section “Halting a printer
run amok,” later in this chapter, for more information.
 Delete and reinstall a printer: Click to select an icon and then choose
File➪Delete from the menu. That command removes the printer. You
can then use item labeled Add a Printer Task to reinstall that same
printer. Often times, this technique fixes printer driver problems.
 Choose which printer you want to use as your main, or default, printer.
Just click the printer to select it and choose File➪Set as Default Printer
from the menu. The default printer has a white-on-black check mark by
its icon, as shown in Figure 14-3.
Figure 14-3:
The 
Printers 
and Faxes
folder.
182
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Your printer’s window
When you print, you can open your printer’s icon in the Printers window to
view the progress of the documents being printed. The documents appear
there, in the order you printed them, marching off to the printer one by one
while you move on to do something else.
Figure 14-4 shows a printer window, though no documents are listed in it —
my printer is too fast to list any. So, just pretend.
 The items waiting to be printed are called print jobs.
 The printer’s window is primarily a place where you can change the
order of the print jobs. Make this change by simply dragging one 
document above another.
 You can also remove jobs from the list by selecting the job and choosing
Document➪Cancel from the menu. Also see the section “Halting a printer

Little printer guy
You never really need to keep an eye on the Printers folder while you print.
Whenever something is printing (or, to be technical, whenever the printer
driver is sending information to the printer), a printer icon appears in the
system tray/notification area. You can double-click that icon to instantly open
your printer’s window and review the documents waiting to be printed.
The little printer guy goes away when the last byte of data has been sent to
the printer.
And Then, the Printer Goes Wacky
Printers are dutiful little creatures, handily going about their work without
care or notice . . . until they screw up. Then the printer can become the most

hated piece of office equipment in the building. Vile creatures. Cruel and
unkind. And, stubborn? I don’t care how fancy the display is on your printer,
when it’s acting stupid, it has nothing useful to say.
General troubleshooting advice
The first thing to try when the printer goes haywire is a printing trouble-
shooter. This is the Microsoft Q&A way to help track down most printer 
problems. Follow these steps:
1. Open the Printers and Faxes window.
You can get there from the Start menu, if there’s a Printers and Faxes
item there, or from the Control Panel’s Printers and Faxes icon.
2. Choose the link labeled Troubleshoot Printing in the See Also panel.
Note that this link can be seen only when a printer icon is not selected.
By clicking the link, you start the Printing Troubleshooter, which is part
of the Windows Help and Support Center, as shown in Figure 14-5.
3. Answer the questions by selecting the proper response from the list.
The first question, as shown in Figure 14-5, is “What problem are you
having?” This wording was chosen over the alternative, “What the hell is
wrong with you?” and the overly insensitive “Go away!” phraseology.

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

4. Work your way through the troubleshooter and answer the questions
as best as you can; click the Next button after making a selection.
Some of the time, this step works.
Eventually, the troubleshooter either leads you to the promised land or you
get stuck in a “Duh, gee, I don’t know” type of loop. In that case, you need
some more active troubleshooting. Keep on reading in this chapter.
 Also check to see whether your printer came with any self-diagnostic
software or utilities or its own troubleshooter-like program.
 If you need to reinstall a printer driver, the easiest way to do that is to
delete your printer from the Printers folder and then add it again.
 You may want to check with your printer manufacturer’s Web page to
see whether it has any updated printer drivers. Refer to Chapter 5 for
more information on finding those Web pages.
Things to check when the 
printer isn’t printing
Ah, the usual suspects: Check all the cables. One cable must plug between
your computer and the printer — both ends must be snug. The other cable
plugs between your printer and the wall socket. Snug. Snug. Snug.
Is the printer turned on?
Is the printer selected? Some printers have the ability to be powered up, but
deselected or taken offline. You typically push a Select or On-line button to
ensure that the printer isn’t ignoring the computer. (This option is on high-
end printers, mostly.)
Do you have a device between your printer and the computer, such as an
external disk drive or CD-R or scanner? These printer-port devices must be
turned on for the printer to print.
Ensure that you have chosen the proper printer from the list in the Print
dialog box. I once sent three copies of a document to a printer in another
office before I figured out that I had the wrong printer selected and that was
the reason nothing was printing on my own printer.
Also check the printer’s display or panel for errors. Some low-end printers
simply blink their lights if they have a paper jam or low-ink problem.
The computer network must be up and running for you to print on a network
printer. Sometimes, you may need to turn your computer off and on again for
it to “find” the network printer. You also need to check the computer’s firewall
185
Chapter 14: Printer Problems

software to ensure that it’s allowed to print on the network printer. (You may
need assistance from your network manager to help set that up.)
There are lines or blanks on the page
Two types of problems appear, both of which are native to inkjet-type print-
ers. The first problem is the lines that appear on the page, such as a smeary
line or smudge down the length of the page. The second problem is lines of
text or an image where “bands” of information are missing. For example, only
the top and bottom parts of each line of text are printed, and there’s a white
line down the middle.
In either case, the smeary smudge or the blank lines, the solution is to clean
the inkjet’s printer nozzles. This isn’t something you do with Mr. Clean and a
scrub brush. Instead, you need to look in the printer’s manual, or sometimes
just under the lid or cover, to find the instructions for cleaning the nozzles or
printer heads.
On my Epson inkjet printer, I need to press the ink droplet button and hold 
it for two seconds to clean the print nozzles. After I release the button, the
printer grinds and grunts for about 12 seconds. After that, printing the same
page over again yields much better results.
Do not remove the ink cartridges and attempt to manually clean them yourself.
The result is a terrible mess, plus the expense of having to purchase new ink
cartridges.
The “weird text atop the page” problem
Printers that print strange text across the top of the first page, or ugly text on
every page, have a driver problem. Most likely, the wrong printer driver was
installed when the printer was set up, such as 401B when you really need a
401A — like that.
The easiest way to change or update printer drivers is to reinstall the printer.
Obey these steps:
1. Open the Printers and Faxes window.
Instructions for doing this step are found throughout this chapter.
2. Click to select your printer’s icon.
3. Choose File➪Delete from the menu.
Click the Yes button if you’re asked to confirm your choice. Poof! The
printer is gone. Well, its driver is gone. The physical printer doesn’t 
disappear.
186
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

4. Choose File➪Add Printer from the menu.
The Add Printer Wizard appears.
5. Obey the wizard to reinstall your printer.
You need to know the printer’s make and model and some other details,
which you fill in as the wizard quizzes you.
6. Keep following the directions and clicking the Next button as necessary.
Eventually, you’re done and the printer is reinstalled.
The key is to be sure that you properly select your printer from the manufac-
turer and model list presented in the Add Printer Wizard. It’s when you don’t
do that, or you make a “best guess,” that you end up with printing problems.
Consider checking with the printer manufacturer’s Web site to see whether it
has updated printer files or even a printer setup utility you can download
and use.
 When the problem is a network printer connected to a specific com-
puter, you must update the driver on that computer, not on your own
computer.
 If the weird text appears only when you print from one application, it’s
the application’s doing and not the printer driver’s.
 Use the File➪Print Preview command to ensure that it’s not the applica-
tion itself that’s producing the weird characters.
 If the characters at the top of the page appear to have their heads cut
off, your page’s top margin is set too high; use the Page Setup dialog box
to increase the top margin.
The color is all wrong (too pink, 
too blue, too green, and so on)
Adjusting the color of printer output is an obsession with some people. But,
this type of error doesn’t involve the subtleties between PMS 133 and PMS
140. If the color is wrong, such as too green or not enough red, your printer is
probably low on one type of ink.
 Sadly, unless you have a printer with separate ink cartridges, you have
to replace the entire three-color ink cartridge when only one color gets
low. I know: It’s a rip-off. But the printer was cheap, wasn’t it?
 PMS is an acronym for the Pantone Matching System, a set of numbers
matched to specific colors. PMS is used by graphics professionals to
ensure that their printed results are exactly the color they want.
187
Chapter 14: Printer Problems

 You can try checking the Print dialog box for an Advanced, Properties,
or Preferences button and see whether you find controls there for manipu-
lating the color. Most of the time, a discolored image is the sign of low ink.
“My black-and-white image 
prints dark blue”
Most color printers come with a three-color ink cartridge and then a single
black ink cartridge. Their controls can also switch so that you can use only
the black cartridge, which is the case if you’re printing a black-and-white or
grayscale image. Simply tell the Print dialog box that you want to use only the
black ink.
 The color doesn’t have to be dark blue. It could be dark green or dark
red or any tone other than black.
 Some older, cheaper inkjet printers lack the black ink cartridge alto-
gether. They create “black” the same way little kids do: by mixing all the
other colors together. Obviously, with this type of printer, obtaining a
true black tone would be fairly impossible.
Halting a printer run amok
I have done this tons of times: You print and then . . . you realize that you
want to take it back and stop printing at once! Here’s what you do:
1. Scream “Stop, you jerk!”
This step doesn’t really help, but it sure feels good.
2. Double-click the printer icon in the system tray/notification area.
This step is the fastest way to open your printer’s window and cancel
the document being printed.
If you don’t see the little printer guy, all the information has been sent to
the printer and is now living inside the printer’s memory. Skip to Step 6.
3. Locate on the list the document you want to halt.
The one at the top of the list is the one that’s “printing.”
4. Select the document and choose Document➪Cancel from the menu.
5. Wait until the document disappears from the list.
After it’s gone, you notice that the printer is still printing. That’s because
most printers have internal memory in which to store several pages of a
document. And, yes, the printer continues to print. Oh, gads!
188
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

6. Turn off the printer.
Yes, this is a mean thing to do. But, it works. It stops the printer from
printing, and it erases the document in the printer’s memory. It doesn’t
harm the printer, though it may make some inky spots with some low-end
inkjet-style printers.
7. Turn the printer on again.
As long as you purge all the printing documents from your printer’s
window (refer to Step 4), nothing else is printed.
8. Eject the page from the printer.
This step removes the last bit of the document that was printing and
prepares the printer to print again.
These steps are your only hope if you run off and print something you want
to cancel. Well, that — or you can stop at Step 4 and just wait for the printer
to spew out two or three more pages. (I had to halt my printer once when I
realized that it was printing 300 pages of random text. Ugh.)
A reader has told me that some printers now come with Print Job Cancel 
buttons on them, or on a menu you can access from the printer’s control 
console. Consider yourself blessed if your printer sports such a feature.
Press that button or access the menu to cancel printing, which should be
your first (and only) step.
Printer Maintenance Chores
Printers run relatively maintenance free, which is amazing considering how
many moving parts are inside. The only regular maintenance you need to per-
form on the printer is the routine changing of the ink cartridges or toner.
If you have a nice inkjet printer, which means that you paid more than $300
for it, I recommend buying brand-name or approved replacement ink car-
tridges. The reason is that these high-end printers rely on the high-end 
cartridges to help keep the inkjet nozzles clean.
If you have a cheaper printer, you can save some money by using those ink
cartridge refilling syringes that are advertised on TV and sold in office supply
stores. They work just fine and aren’t really that messy, but the ink is of a
lower quality, so you don’t want to use them in a high-end inkjet printer.
For laser printers, you can get a few extra sheets out of the thing by “rock-
ing” the toner cartridge when the first Toner Low warning comes. Simply
remove the toner from the machine and rock it from left to right gently in
your hands. This technique somehow redistributes the toxic “inkstuff” so
189
Chapter 14: Printer Problems

that you can print a while longer before you have to shell out beaucoup
bucks for another toner cartridge.
As far as jams go, simply clear them as best you can. Printer jams happen
because the paper is damaged, too thin, or too thick. If the paper is too old,
it may contain moisture that can make a laser printer grunt.
In my travels, I have discovered few printers that can print on paper stock
heavier than 25 pounds. One printer could do it, but it was a laser printer
where the paper passed in a straight line from the front to the back of the
printer. Other printers, where the paper scrolls up and down and back and
forth, cannot handle thick paper stock, which jams and causes you undue
delay and stress.
We could all use a little less stress.

Dealing with Disk Disaster
In This Chapter
 Determining whether a hard drive is in trouble
 Dealing with a failing hard drive
 Troubleshooting CD-ROM drives
 Messing with the autoplay feature
 Figuring out floppy disk dilemmas
P
erhaps nothing else in a computer can induce that frozen pang of dread
better than a disk error. Disks are where you store your stuff. Disk errors
mean that, potentially, you may lose your stuff. Even when my first PC’s feeble
63-watt power supply blew up (blue smoke and all), I was merely surprised.
Then I laughed, “Ha! Ha!” I knew that my data was still safe on the hard drive.
Many types of disks dwell in the typical PC. The most important type is the
hard drive, which is where the operating system lives, where your applica-
tions live, and where your stuff lives. Obviously, its care is important, but you
probably have other disks as well: CDs, DVDs, and floppies. I cover them all
here in this rather beefy chapter on dealing with disk disaster.
Note: You should also refer to Part III of this book, which deals with preven-
tive maintenance, backup, and other disk tools.
Smells Like Hard Drive Trouble
Securely spinning in the bosom of your typical PC, the hard drive is expected
to last anywhere from four to five years. After that time, the hard drive begins
to call it a day, errors increase, and things move slower. That’s expected.
Anything wrong before that is not only unexpected, but unwelcome as well.

192
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
“A hard drive is missing!”
Whoops! How did the hard drive escape?
Your first option, as usual, is to restart the computer to see whether the miss-
ing hard drive can be found. That generally fixes the problem.
If the hard drive is an external model, ensure that it’s properly connected and
getting power. I have noted that some external USB or IEEE 1340 (FireWire)
drives must be attached directly to the computer console for them to work.
If you’re certain that the hard drive is a second physical drive inside the con-
sole, turn off the computer and open up the console to see whether it’s still
properly connected. Or, if that makes you uneasy, consider having your dealer
do it.
Sometimes, the hard drive icon may be hidden in the My Computer window;
choose View➪List to change the way the drives are displayed. That reveals
any icons hiding behind other icons.
Hard drive, hard disk — what’s the diff?
The terms hard drive and hard disk are fairly
interchangeable, and I’m sure that nerds at
cocktail parties would argue the differences
down to the tiniest micron. But, that’s a moot
point.
The hard drive is a chunk of electronics about
the size of a thick paperback book (though the
size does vary). That unit contains several spin-
ning disks, all stacked on the same spindle and
all of which store data on both sides. That whole
thing is a hard drive, but for technical reasons,
refer to it as a physical drive. Most PCs can
have two or more physical drives installed inter-
nally and as many external physical drives as
you can afford.
As far as the operating system is concerned, a
physical hard drive can be one or more logical
drives. You can partition the physical drive
inside your computer into two logical drives: C
and D. So, one physical disk can be one or more
logical disk drives.
You can find lots of technical folderol having to
do with disk drives, partitioning, and such, but
my point is that when a single physical hard
drive goes, it can bring down one or more of the
logical drives as well. Conversely, a corrupt file
on a logical drive may not affect any other logi-
cal drives on the same physical drive.
So, the terms hard drive and hard disk aren’t
really important, although it helps to know that
a physical hard drive can be divided into logical
hard drives.

If you boot with a floppy disk, or start an older version of Windows, you
cannot access any high-capacity hard drives. The drives appear to be miss-
ing, but it’s merely that the older software cannot recognize the drive as a
real disk drive and not a slice of cheese. The solution here is to start the 
computer normally.
 External drives must receive power. Some external drives must be turned
on before the computer starts so that they’re recognized.
 Daisy-chaining some types of drives (connecting two or more drives,
one after the other) may render the last drive invisible to the operating
system.
 USB and IEEE 1340 drives must be plugged into a powered hub, either
the computer’s console or a hub that plugs into the wall for power. If
plugging the drive into the hub doesn’t work, plug it directly into the
computer console.
Hard drive failure warning signs
Most of the time, hard drives let you know well before they die. If your com-
puter were a novel, the hard drive death scene would go on for pages and
pages. That’s good news — well, good news about impending bad news.
You may see several signs of impending hard drive doom. They may come in
this order, in any order, or all at once, or only one may occur:
First sign: An increasing number of errors and bad sectors occur. As you run
your programs, you may see access or read errors or the infamous Blue
Screen of Death. Or, when you run Check Disk or other disk utilities, errors
may be reported. At first, they’re fixed — which is great. But as time rolls on,
the number and frequency of errors increase.
Second sign: Drive performance suffers. Disk access becomes sluggish.
Defragmenting the drive doesn’t help.
Third sign: The drive becomes louder and louder. I caught one recent and
rather sudden drive failure because I noticed a clicking sound as the drive
was accessing data. The clicking got louder over the next hour, and immedi-
ately I backed up the entire drive. Good thing too because the next morning,
the hard drive was dead.
Other sounds include an increasing whistling or grinding noise that may
diminish over time, but still is a sign that the drive may be on its last leg.

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
 The monitor, too, can make a loud, annoying noise when it’s starting to
go berserk. Refer to Chapter 13 for information on how to tell whether
it’s the monitor, and not the hard drive, that’s hurting your ears.
 See Chapter 23 for more information on Check Disk.
 Hard drives also tend to die when you turn the computer on, so if you
suspect trouble — by all means! — leave the computer on until you can
do a backup.
What to do when you suspect trouble
Whenever you suspect trouble, immediately you should back up your data. If
you have a backup program, run it at once!
If you don’t have a backup, but have a second physical hard drive, back up
the data to that second hard drive; just copy all your important files over to
the drive. But, it must be a separate physical drive, such as an external disk
drive or a disk drive on another computer on the network. Don’t back up to
another logical drive (or partition) on the same physical drive.
Hands down, you have to replace the defective drive. You’re buying, at mini-
mum, your computer a second hard drive. If possible, try to get an internal
hard drive. Have your dealer set it up as the main hard drive, and have that
person reconfigure the existing hard drive as the second hard drive. Then,
you can copy information from the old hard drive to the new hard drive and
eventually dispense with the old one.
If the drive is deceased, is its data dead as well?
Sometimes, the information on the hard drive
goes with the hardware, and sometimes the
information on the hard drive is still intact. That
is why it’s best to copy that stuff from the failing
hard drive while you have the chance. If the
hard drive goes, however, it’s still possible to
recover your data. Possible, but expensive.
Various outfits in most major cities specialize in
disk disaster data recovery. Most of these
places can take an old hard drive and, as long
as you didn’t blast the thing with a shotgun, fully
recover all the data and either place it on a
CD-ROM or a new hard drive or print it all for
you.
Although this sounds like a wonderful service,
data recovery is very expensive. It’s primarily
used for large companies or the government or
other situations where the files are critical and
no other backup exists. If your stuff is precious
to you, back up your hard drive, as covered in
Chapter 25. Save the data recovery job for those
few places that can afford it.

Chapter 15: Dealing with Disk Disaster
Know your CD-ROM drive letter
If you’re going to be working with your CD-ROM,
and especially if you end up phoning tech sup-
port, you need to know which drive letter
belongs to your CD-ROM drive. This PC puzzle
is one that most users haven’t yet solved.
In most documentation, the CD-ROM drive letter
is referred to as Drive D. That’s because Drive
D is the CD-ROM (or DVD) drive in about 70 per-
cent of the computers sold. Drive C is the one
and only hard drive. Drive D, the next letter,
belongs to the CD. But that’s not always the
case.
If you have a hard drive D, the CD-ROM drive
letter may be E.
If you’re a clever user and have reassigned your
CD-ROM drive letter, it could be any letter of the
alphabet, up to Z! On two of my computers, the
CD-ROM is drive letter R. So, how can you tell?
Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
Choose View➪Details from the menu. You see
your computer’s disk drives organized as shown
in the nearby figure. Look in the Type column for
any CD-ROM Disc or Compact Disc entries.
That’s your CD-ROM drive. Note which letter it
is, such as F in the figure. (Drive D is a DVD
drive, though you cannot tell from the My
Computer window.)

196
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
 Under no circumstances should you expect or accept someone’s offer to
fix the drive. No, just replace the defective drive. It’s not worth the cost
or trouble to fix the drive.
 See Chapter 25 for information on backing up a hard drive.
 It helps to get a second, larger hard drive in any computer. The cost isn’t
that much.
 Yes, you can add a second hard drive yourself, but it’s often a real
pain. Hard drives must be configured as master and slave, which can be
confusing — especially if you get two drives from different manufactur-
ers. No, unless you consider yourself experienced at this sort of thing,
have your dealer do it.
CD-ROM Catastrophes!
Since the mid-1990s or so, the CD-ROM drive is a standard feature on every
PC. Almost all new software comes on CDs, and with the addition of CD-R/RW
and DVD drives, these removable, shiny media are a valued and trusted part
of any PC system.
And, like anything else in the computer, they can go kaput at the most ugly
of times.
The all-purpose, do-or-die, tried-and-true
CD-ROM troubleshooter
When the CD drive doesn’t read a disc, play music, or do anything, you can
follow these steps to effectively troubleshoot the drive:
1. Push the eject button on the drive.
What should happen: If the tray slides out or the disc spits out (depend-
ing on the type of drive), you can be absolutely certain that the drive is
getting power.
If nothing happens: The drive is dead. There are two things you can do:
First, you can (if you know your screws and nuts) turn off the computer
and check the drive connections to see whether they’re loose. If they’re
all snug, do the second option: Replace the drive with one that works.
2. Insert a music disc.
The computer is smart enough to know that you play music discs when
they’re inserted. Notice that most CD-ROM drives even have a headphone
jack and volume control. You use them to hear whether the music CD is
playing.

What should happen: You hear the music play over the headphones.
This means that the drive is working and what’s missing is the con-
nection between the drive and the motherboard (for data) or the 
connection between the drive and your PC’s sound card (for music).
If nothing happens: The drive is dead, or the connections are loose. You
can check the connections, and that may fix the problem. If not, replace
the drive.
3. Insert a cleaning disc.
Go to Radio Shack or Wal-Mart or wherever and pick up a CD drive clean-
ing disc. This disc buffs out the laser lens and possibly fixes a CD drive
that skips or reads data intermittently.
What should happen: The drive suddenly works again.
If nothing happens: It’s time to get a new drive.
That’s pretty much it for troubleshooting. Generally speaking, only a few
things can go wrong with a CD-ROM drive: Its connections become loose, in
which case the drive seems to have power, but inserting a disc has no effect;
the drive has no power, which generally means that the drive is dead; or, the
drive intermittently reads data, which means that the lens needs cleaning.
 Don’t use a CD drive cleaning kit on a CD-R/RW or DVD-R drive. Those
drives have self-cleaning laser heads, and using a cleaning disc on them
can damage the drive.
 Speaking of which, a CD-R/RW drive that cannot write may have a hard-
ware problem and need replacing. But first, try burning another disc.
CD-R discs do go bad. When they do, toss them out and try again with
another disc.
 Yes, CD-ROM drives do die. Remember that anything with moving parts
is more likely to die than something fully electronic.
 If the CD-ROM drive ever goes AWOL, consider running the Add New
Hardware Wizard (from the Control Panel’s Add New Hardware icon) 
to reinstall it.
 If you can’t eject a disc, use the “beauty mark” hole on the front of the
drive. Stick a straightened paper clip into the hole. Push gently. This
action ejects the disc — even when the computer is off or the drive
totally lacks power.
Turning autoplay on or off
Windows comes configured to automatically play any CD you stick into the
CD-ROM drive. This means that music discs should play automatically and
that the autoplay programs on most data CDs run a Setup or Install program
when the disc is inserted.
197
Chapter 15: Dealing with Disk Disaster

198
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
You can turn the AutoPlay feature on or off, or you can control how the disc
is to be treated when Windows recognizes what types of files it contains.
Here’s how to do that:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Right-click your CD-ROM drive’s icon.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
The CD-ROM drive’s Properties dialog box appears.
4. Click the AutoPlay tab.
You’re presented with a slate of options, as shown in Figure 15-1. Here’s
what to do:
• If you want nothing to happen, choose the item labeled Select an
Action to Perform. Then, from the list, choose the item labeled
Take No Action. That way, the computer does nothing whenever
you stick in a CD.
• If you want Windows to do different things depending on the disc’s
contents, choose the contents from the drop-down list. For exam-
ple, to automatically play a music CD, choose Music CD from the
list. Then, select from the list in the dialog box the program or
media player to use.
5. Click the OK button after you have made your choices.
6. Close the My Computer window.
If you have a second CD-ROM or DVD drive, you need to repeat these steps
for that drive as well. Remember that a DVD drive can also read CD discs.

CD-R and CD-RW drive stuff
CD-R and CD-RW drives present other problems in addition to that of the
normal CD-ROM drive. That’s because, as their name implies, these drives can
actually write discs, either the CD-R recordable discs or the CD-RW read-write
discs — or both!
The biggest problem folks have with their CD-R drives is that they cannot get
the drive to record. I cover specific steps to accomplish that task in my book
PCs For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.). But, you must ensure that the drive
is configured for recording. Here’s how to check:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Right-click your CD-ROM drive’s icon.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
This step displays a Properties dialog box for that CD-ROM drive.
4. Click the Recording tab.
The Recording tab has lots of information on it, as shown in Figure 15-2.
But, the key is the item labeled Enable CD Recording on This Drive.
5. Ensure that there’s a check mark by the item labeled Enable CD
Recording on This Drive.
6. Click OK.
7. You can close the My Computer window as well.

Obviously, if there’s no Recording tab in Step 4 in these steps, the drive is not
a CD-R/RW drive. Don’t argue with me about it! Contact your dealer!
Here are some thoughts:
 I don’t recommend using CD-RW discs any more. First, they’re more
expensive than CD-R discs. Second, they don’t always reliably erase, and
the number of times they can be reused is limited. Third, using them
seems to be more time-consuming. Therefore, I recommend that you
simply buy and use CD-R discs instead.
 My advice is to “burn” data to a CD-R disc in big chunks, and the larger
the chunk, the better. Using a CD-R drive like a regular disk drive may
result in less usable storage space on the drive; the extra overhead
required to keep track of all the small recording sessions adds up.
 Though it appears that you can delete files on a CD-R disc, the space
used by the files isn’t recovered. No, Windows merely “masks” the
deleted file. Don’t be surprised when you delete 50 megabytes of stuff
from a CD-R or CD-RW and don’t see an extra 50 megabytes of storage
appear on the drive.
 CD-R discs fail, just like other types of discs. If the CD-R disc cannot be
written to, throw it out.
 The CD-R drive may appear to be dead, but most likely the disc is full.
Try replacing the disc and see whether it still works.
Floppy Disk Woes
Pity the poor floppy disk. My friend Reza, from the United Kingdom, believes
them to be doomed. Alas, they may be underused and ignored on many PCs,
but they’re still standard equipment. Quite a few smaller programs and utili-
ties still come on floppy disks. They’re cheap; easy to mail; easy to transport.
But, they can cause woe and distress just like any other disk in the system.
“The floppy disk doesn’t format!”
All floppy disks need to be formatted before you can use them. Even those
preformatted disks should be formatted by your own floppy drive. If they
can’t be formatted, toss them out!
Floppy disks are cheap enough that you shouldn’t waste any of your time
trying to get one to format.

Why don’t some of them format? The answer is alignment. Floppy drives aren’t
manufactured with the same rigid precision as other disk drives in your PC.
Because of that, the alignment from drive to drive varies. A disk formatted in
one drive (at the factory, for example) may not work in your own PC’s drive.
Likewise, you may find that your floppy disks can’t be read on other drives
because of bad alignment.
Floppy disks are unreliable
Please don’t use floppies as your primary form of disk storage. The hard drive
is where you’re supposed to put all your vital stuff. Floppy disks are for trans-
port or backup use, for that second copy.
The reason you shouldn’t rely on floppy disks is that they just aren’t as reli-
able as other disks. The floppy drive read/write head literally rubs the disk
media every time you use the disk. Eventually, the head rubs the magnetic
material off the disk and renders the disk useless.

O
, shame! The powerful computer is slowly consuming the gentle, patient
art of photography. While the camera companies continue to strive
toward making things easier, computer users’ graphical efforts are often met
with disgrace and shame. Grandma bemoans, “It took me 40 minutes to down-
load that baby’s picture, and all I can see on the screen is one big eye!” Then,
to make matters worse, she adds, “I thought you were supposed to be some
sort of computer genius!”
The problems surrounding graphics images, scanning, and digital photography
aren’t centered as much on computer problems as they are on misunder-
standing. Graphics is a big arena. There are plenty of places where things can
go wrong and problems can crop up. This chapter helps smooth down those
rough edges and offers soothing words of advice for grappling with graphics.

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
Unraveling Resolution
Most of the basic graphics questions and problems orbit the mysterious planet
of resolution. Before you can understand why an image appears too large on
the monitor or prints too tiny on paper, you need to understand resolution.
This section helps break down the concept of resolution, as well as other
graphical terminology, into easy-to-digest, byte-size chunks.
What are pixels?
All graphic images — whether on the screen, in a file, or printed — are com-
posed of tiny dots. On the computer screen, these dots are called pixels, which
is a contraction of picture elements. A typical pixel is shown in Figure 16-1.
Most of the talk about computer graphics deals with pixels: An image is format-
ted with so-many pixels across (horizontally) and so-many down (vertically).
The monitor’s resolution is set in pixels (refer to Chapters 6 and 13).
The printer, on the other hand, doesn’t use pixels. Instead, the printer uses
dots, which are merely a printed representation of the pixels on the screen.
Every printer is capable of printing so-many dots per linear inch.
Dots and pixels are really the same thing: an individual piece of an electronic
photograph. The difference is only in the name; the same pixel on the moni-
tor becomes a dot on the printer.
Figure 16-1:
A single

205
Chapter 16: Correcting Graphics Disgrace
The mysterious depths of color
Each pixel on the screen is assigned a specific color or tone. Back in the old
days of monochrome monitors, there were no colors: The pixel was on or
off, which translated into black or white. (A typical black pixel appears in
Figure 16-1.) With color monitors, the pixel’s color value is more diverse:
It ranges from a basic 16 colors on up to millions of colors.
Obviously, having a high color depth is good; more colors render images
more realistically than a limited range of colors can. Images with fewer colors
look flat and phony — like a cartoon.
Though a higher color depth is better, there’s a premium to pay: Having more
colors requires more video memory to store the pixels’ information; plus,
more microprocessor speed is required in order to manipulate that vast
amount of information; plus, more hard drive space is required in order to
store the image. That’s why the system resource requirements are so great
for graphics and photo-editing applications.
The number of dots per inch
An image’s resolution comes into play when you set the number of pixels, or
dots, per inch for an image. You see, this value varies. Unlike other measure-
ments in computers — characters per kilobyte, speed in GHz, crashes per
hour — the number of pixels that can be crammed into an inch isn’t a con-
stant thing.
The higher the resolution, the more pixels or dots per inch.
The lower the resolution, the fewer pixels or dots per inch.
Figures 16-2, 16-3, and 16-4 illustrate the same image taken at different resolu-
tions, or numbers of dots per inch.
In Figure 16-2, the resolution is low enough that you can see the pixels. (The
stair-stepping phenomenon is called aliasing.) In Figure 16-3, the resolution is
double that of Figure 16-2, and Figure 16-4 is doubled again.
 The more dots per inch, the higher the resolution and the more realistic
the image appears.
 Higher-resolution images take up a tremendous amount of disk space.
Those pixels cost RAM!
 If you’re editing an image by using photo-editing software, such as
Adobe Photoshop Elements, you want a very high resolution. The
more pixels that are available, the easier it is to work with the image.

Chapter 16: Correcting Graphics Disgrace
 The fewer dots per inch, the lower the image’s resolution and the less
realistic it appears.
 Lower-resolution images have the advantage of taking up less disk
space.
 More color depth can be used to compensate for lower resolution,
which is how television sets work. But, more color depth also makes the
file size larger without necessarily increasing any detail in the image.
“Why does the image look 
so large on my monitor?”
When you use the term resolution to refer to a computer monitor, the values
discussed are the number of pixels horizontally and vertically. For example,
the monitor’s resolution is 800 x 600 pixels or 1024 by 768 pixels. But, those
numbers mean nothing. The true resolution is the number of dots per inch.
The typical PC monitor has a resolution of about 96 dots per inch (dpi).
Suppose that you have a graphics image that uses 300 dots per inch as its
resolution. That image appears three times larger on the PC’s monitor when
it’s displayed at a 1-to-1 ratio, dots per pixel, as shown in Figure 16-5.

tion of

Figure 16-2.

208
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
If the image’s size is less than the monitor’s “resolution” — 1024 by 768 pixels,
for example — you can still see the whole thing on the screen. But, most images
with a 300 dpi resolution have much larger dimensions than 1024 x 768 pixels.
Therefore, the whole thing cannot show up on the monitor at once.
Changing the monitor’s resolution
Your monitor’s resolution isn’t stuck at 96 dpi. It can be adjusted up or down,
depending on the monitor and graphics adapter’s abilities. Follow these steps
to see whether you can change your monitor’s resolution:
1. Open the Control Panel’s Display icon.
This step summons the Display Properties dialog box. You can also
beckon this dialog box by right-clicking the desktop and choosing
Properties from the pop-up menu deal.
2. Choose the Settings tab.
3. Click the Advanced button.
A dialog box detailing your video hardware, both monitor and graphics
adapter, pops into view.
4. Locate the Display area on the General tab.
Figure 16-5:

209
Chapter 16: Correcting Graphics Disgrace
You can see the DPI Setting drop-down list, as shown in Figure 16-6. In
the figure, it’s shown as Normal Size (96 DPI).
5. Choose Custom Setting from the drop-down list labeled DPI Setting.
The Custom DPI Setting dialog box can be used to adjust the monitor’s
resolution, as shown in Figure 16-7. The more pixels per inch, the smaller
the images appear on the monitor. The fewer pixels per inch, the larger
images appear.
6. Select a new resolution in the Custom DPI Setting dialog box, or just
leave well enough alone.
You can also use the mouse to drag the ruler in the Custom DPI Setting
dialog box to the left or right.

210
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
7. Click the various OK or Cancel buttons to back out of the open dialog
boxes. Close the Control Panel window, if necessary.
Note that the monitor’s resolution isn’t exactly 1 inch per one inch. For exam-
ple, if you get to Step 5 in this set of steps, put a ruler up to the monitor to
see whether those tick marks in the Custom DPI Setting dialog box (refer to
Figure 16-7) are really one inch wide. I would bet that they aren’t! This is why
some graphics mavens follow these steps to set their monitor’s resolution to
exactly one inch per inch.
The Macintosh uses a monitor resolution of 72 dpi. This is one reason that
graphics designers prefer that platform: One pixel on the Mac’s monitor is
equal in size to one typesetter’s point.
How the resolution affects the image size
The image resolution and its physical size depend on the device used to
either capture or display the image. This concept is strange to understand,
so pay heed!
Suppose that an image has physical dimensions of four inches by five inches.
If that image is captured at 100 dpi, its resolution is 100 dpi. But, the image’s
dimensions are 400 pixels by 500 pixels.
Once again, suppose that the same image (4 x 5 inches) is captured at 300 dpi.
Its dimensions are now 1200 x 1500 pixels. That image would be too large to
display on a monitor that shows 1024 x 768 pixels. But, consider what happens
when you print the image on a printer with a resolution of 600 dpi: The image
is printed twice as small: 2 inches by 2.5 inches.
 The image’s real size depends on the resolution of the device used to
render the image.
 The best way to set the resolution is to know in advance where the
image will end up. For e-mail, a resolution of 100 dpi, or roughly what
the computer’s monitor displays, is fine. For printing, try to match the
printer’s resolution. For photo editing, higher resolutions are best to
ensure that enough pixels are present to properly edit the image.
“How can I see the whole image?”
Most graphics applications have a Zoom command or tool, which can be
used to reduce or enlarge the image that’s displayed. For example, an image
taken at 300 dpi appears three times larger than normal on a 96 dpi monitor.
If you use the Zoom tool to zoom out and reduce the image’s visual size, you
can see the entire thing on your monitor.

211
Chapter 16: Correcting Graphics Disgrace
Likewise, when an image is too small, you can use the Zoom tool to enlarge it.
However, the computer cannot create pixels where none exists. So, zooming
in on a low-resolution image results in the kind of pixel-laden image you see
in Figure 16-2.
Setting Resolution
One of the decisions you must make when you create a graphics image is the
resolution. What is the proper number of dpi for that image? The real key
here is to know where the image will end up. After all, there’s no point in
oversizing an image’s resolution when you don’t really need to.
“At what resolution should 
an image be for e-mail?”
Images captured for the Web or for e-mail need have no higher a resolution
than the computer’s monitor. Because PCs are set at 96 dpi, 96 dpi is a fine
resolution, though most professionals choose 100 dpi simply because it’s a
round number.
At 100 DPI, you need to gauge the scale of the image. That’s because most
graphics programs do the math for you and though you set the resolution at
a certain DPI value, the program displays the results in pixels horizontal and
vertical. What I do is this:
Set the image’s longest edge to a value between 300 and 400 pixels.
This action ensures that the image fixes on the screen, no matter what the
monitor’s resolution. If the image doesn’t look good at that size, set a higher
size. But, be aware that sizes larger than 600 or 800 pixels may not appear on
some folks’ monitors.
 Most digital cameras, and indeed some scanners, have a Web or E-mail
setting, which is a rather low resolution, but one specifically designed
for viewing the image on a monitor.
 If you need the image for purposes other than the Web or e-mail, create
a copy of the original image and reduce the copy to a size and resolution
best suited for the Web.
 Not every computer monitor is the same! In addition to size and resolu-
tion matters, not every monitor has the same color balance. What the
image looks like on your monitor will be different on other monitors.

212
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
“At what resolution should an image be 
for photo editing or enlarging?”
For photo editing you want lots and lots of those juicy pixels available, so the
higher the resolution, the better.
For snapping digital pictures, set the camera to its highest available resolution,
which is typically the camera raw format. At that resolution, the images are
huge in size (several megabytes), but that abundant and glorious information
makes all the difference when you’re photo editing or reproducing or enlarging
the images.
“How can I change my 
image’s resolution?”
Technically, you cannot change an image’s resolution. Pixels are stuck like stars
in the firmament. New ones cannot be plucked from the ether, just as a magi-
cian doesn’t really pull coins out of the air. So, if you snap an image at 100 dpi,
you cannot magically convert it to 800 dpi for output on a high-quality digital
printer.
Or, can you?
Photo-editing programs have commands for increasing resolution. But, they
cheat. They approximate pixel values. Some programs do this quite well;
Photoshop is the master, by using complex algorithms and software trickery
to approximate and interpolate pixels where none existed before. Keep in
mind that the result is never as good as when the image was captured at the
proper resolution in the first place.
“How can I resize an image?”
Changing an image’s size is done in photo-editing or any type of graphics appli-
cation. The key is to find the resizing command. For example, in Photoshop
the command is Image➪Image Size. That command allows you to resize an
image based on its horizontal and vertical pixel measurements. (It may also
let you set the image’s resolution.)
When you’re changing an image’s size, be sure to constrain the image. That is,
when you resize the number of horizontal pixels, ensure that the vertical pixels
are resized in a similar way so that the image doesn’t appear stretched or
skewed.

213
Chapter 16: Correcting Graphics Disgrace
Figure 16-8 shows the Image Size dialog box from Photoshop Elements. See
the linked chains to the right of the Width and Height areas? That means the
values are linked, or constrained, so that when one is resized, the other
dimension follows accordingly. The Constrain Proportions option (at the
bottom of the dialog box) is what ensures that things remain together.
Glorious Graphics File Formats
Beyond the confusion of image resolution, there exists the multiple mania of
graphics file formats. You may think that one format would be enough, but
there are literally hundreds of computer graphics file formats. These document
the different computer platforms as well as the gradual improvement of graph-
ics technology over the years. The good news is that only a few of the graphics
file formats are popular now, which narrows the choice and waters down the
confusion.
Graphics file format reference
Out of gazillions of graphics file formats, there are only six common ones you
need to confuse yourself over.
TIFF: This is the most compatible, common graphics file format, though it’s
best suited for documents or sharing images between different applications.
TIFF images are too large to use for sending e-mail photos. But, for long-term
storage or archiving images, I highly recommend using TIFF.
JPG: This is the most common graphics file format. JPG, or JPEG, renders
real-life images, like photographs, very well. Unlike TIFF, JPG files can be com-
pressed so that they don’t take up huge amounts of disk space. The smaller
file size also makes JPG images the ideal format for the Internet.
Figure 16-8:
Resizing an

214
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
GIF: This is an older file format, though it’s still popular on the Internet. GIF
images aren’t as good as JPG, however, because of a limited number of avail-
able colors. Therefore, you see graphic designs or art rendered in the GIF
format, but not photographs.
PNG: This is the graphics format of the future. Called PNG, it’s perhaps the
most versatile graphics file format developed. It’s slowly gaining adoption on
the Web; however, I wouldn’t recommend it for e-mail because not every e-mail
program can properly recognize and display PNG images.
BMP: This is the old Windows graphics file format, where BMP stands for
bitmapped image. The file size for BMP images is too large to make them
practical for use in e-mail, though many folks make the mistake of e-mailing
BMP images all the time.
Native: This is whatever format your photo-editing software uses to save its
images. In Photoshop Elements, it’s the Photoshop, or PSD, file format.
Generally speaking, this is the best file format to save images you edit.
 For the Internet, use the JPG file format.
 JPG is pronounced “jay-peg.” Note that the files can also end with the
JPEG extension.
 GIF is pronounced “gif” with a hard G, as in “give.” Some folks say “jiff”
instead.
 BMP images are still used by Windows. In fact, the Paint program that
comes with Windows uses BMP as its native format.
The JPG compression stuff
JPG graphics files achieve their small size thanks to built-in compression.
When the image is saved to disk, a dialog box appears, such as the one
shown in Figure 16-9, from Photoshop Elements. The dialog box prompts you
to set the compression, either 1, or Low, for lots of compression or 10, or
High, for no or little compression.
The low compression values yield smaller file sizes, which is good. But the
image tends to get very fuzzy and ill-defined at tight compression values.
The higher values ironically indicate little compression. That means that the
file size is larger, but the image quality is better.
I have never been in a situation where I have had to use compression values less
than 5. I don’t like the way the images look at those settings, so I save images
at 6 or higher. For images where I want lots of detail I use 8, 9, or 10 values.
For other images, values of 6 or 7 are just fine.

215
Chapter 16: Correcting Graphics Disgrace
JPG graphics use what’s called a lossy compression routine. That is, every
time a JPG image is saved to disk, some of the image’s information is lost. The
more you open and resave JPG images to disk, the worse the image looks
over time. If you just open and view an image, this isn’t a problem. If you
plan on editing or reusing an image, save it in the TIFF file format instead.
“What’s the best graphics 
file format for e-mail?”
JPG.
“How can I convert my image from the
[whatever] format into JPG?”
Some wonderful graphics conversion programs are available, but in Windows
the only way to convert graphics images is to use the Paint program. It’s
clumsy, but it works:
1. Start the Paint program in Windows.
The program can be found on the Start button’s menu: Choose All
Programs➪Accessories➪Paint.
2. Choose File➪Open.
3. Use the Open dialog box to locate the file you want to convert.
From the drop-down list labeled Files of Type, choose the All Pictures
Files option. That directs Paint to display any picture file it can open.
Figure 16-9:
Setting a
JPG image’s

sion.

4. When you find the file to convert, click the Open button to open its
image inside the Paint program.
There it is.
5. Chose File➪Save As.
6. Use the Save As dialog box to find a proper location for the file.
I offer specific instructions on using the Save As dialog box in my book
PCs For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
7. Choose the graphics file type from the drop-down list at the bottom of
the Save As dialog box, by selecting Save As Type.
There, you find JPEG, GIF, TIFF, and PNG as options. For e-mail, you want
to choose JPEG.
8. Click the Save button to save the file.
Now, you can use your e-mail program to send the picture in the best graphics
file format. Don’t forget where you saved it!
 The Paint program may also be called MS Paint or Windows Paint.
 The Paint program can open BMP (Native), JPG, GIF, TIFF, PNG, and ICO
graphics file types. (ICO files are icon graphics images.)
 A great alternative graphics program is IrfanView, which is free, from
www.irfanview.com.
 These steps can also be used to convert between any of the five popular
graphics file formats: TIFF, JPG, GIF, PNG, and BMP. Just choose the
proper format in Step 7.

survived! For my research into this chapter, I read the technical description
of how the typical PC connects to the Internet. The reading was tough —
even dangerous. No pictures. And, it wasn’t a Dummies book, either. I read
lots of jargon about layers and protocols and bits hither, thither, and yon.
The process is all so complex that it makes you wonder how it ever happens
at all, but you know that it does. In a way, I could compare it to the differences
between reading about sexual reproduction in biology class versus a backseat
experience in a GTO at a drive-in movie, but I think that my publisher would
strenuously object.
Fortunately, you don’t ever have to learn the ins and outs of what goes on
behind the scenes when you make an Internet connection happen. With any
luck, it just does. When it doesn’t, you can turn to this chapter for some solu-
tions or soothing words of advice.
Just a Sampling of the Zillions of Things
That Can Go Wrong with Connecting to
the Internet with a Dial-Up Modem
It’s supposed to work like this: You start an Internet program, and your com-
puter automatically connects to the Internet and dishes up whatever data it
is you’re requesting: a Web page, e-mail, file — whatever.

218
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
This section, presented in a somewhat logical order, describes the things that
can go wrong or may go wrong, or they’re just general questions about con-
nection calamities and losses.
Please note that these issues deal with dial-up Internet connections only.
“Windows doesn’t remember 
my password!”
You go to connect to the Internet and, sure enough, you have to reenter your
connection password. Again and again. And the Save option is dimmed, mean-
ing that you cannot save the password. What’s up?
The problem is that your account doesn’t have a password in Windows XP.
When you log in properly and provide the Login dialog box with a name and
password, Windows activates the password chain, which is simply a location
where Windows remembers all your various passwords.
The solution? Log in properly; give your account a password in Windows XP.
Here’s how:
1. Open the Control Panel’s User Accounts icon.
2. Click your account in the User Accounts window.
Your account name and its pretty little icon appear in the window.
3. Click the link labeled Create a Password.
4. Fill in the blanks on the next screen to assign yourself a password and
password hint.
Enter the password twice, as the window beckons you to. Also enter a
password hint, which should not be the same thing as the password, but
a hint to remind you of the password.
For example, a good password has a combination of letters and numbers
and is generally more than six characters long. So, if you once lived at
123 Ash Street, a password could be 123ash. The hint would be “My
address when I was 15.” Good password, good hint.
5. Click the Create Password button when you’re done.
6. Close various windows and such.
By having a password-protected account in Windows, you can direct all the
other places where passwords are entered to remember the passwords. That

way, for example, you never have to keep typing the Internet or e-mail pass-
word. Everything is locked up under that main, Windows XP account password.
 The username and password used to log in to Windows is different from
the username and password you use on the Internet.
 Also refer to Chapter 9 for information on creating the password reset
floppy disk.
Automatic-connection dilemmas
People automatically complain about two things in connecting to the
Internet: They want it to happen, or they want it not to happen.
For example, if you enjoy automatic connection, when you start an Internet
application, such as Internet Explorer, the connection box just pops up, and
the modem dials in to the Internet. That’s automatic connection in action.
On the other hand, some people prefer to have the Connect dialog box pop
up and then have to click the Dial button to manually connect to the Internet.
Either way is possible, controlled from the Internet Options dialog box, as
shown in Figure 17-1. Here’s how to dig that up:
Figure 17-1:
The 
Internet
Options/
Connections
dialog box.
219
Chapter 17: Internet Connection Mayhem

220
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
1. Open the Control Panel’s Internet Options icon.
You can also get to this dialog box by choosing Tools➪Internet Options
inside the Internet Explorer Web browser program.
2. Click the Connections tab.
3. Choose the option labeled Never Dial a Connection.
4. Click OK.
You can close the Control Panel window too, if needed.
The Never Dial a Connection option isn’t stupid; it doesn’t mean to never dial
a connection. In fact, it should be relabeled Never Automatically Dial a Connec-
tion. That way, you have to manually connect to the Internet, which is why
you would choose such a setting. Control!
Here’s a description of each of the connection choices listed in the Internet
Properties/Connections dialog box:
Never Dial a Connection: Windows doesn’t automatically connect to
the Internet. You must manually dial in by using the Connect dialog box.
You do this by opening the Internet Connection icon in the Network
Connections window. Or, the Connect dialog box may appear whenever
any program attempts to connect to the Internet.
Dial Whenever a Network Connection Is Not Present: This option is
the one that most people with traditional modems should select. It tells
Windows to connect to the Internet whenever you open an Internet 
program.
Always Dial My Default Connection: This option is puzzling because it
sounds like the one you should check, but you should check the preced-
ing option instead.
Most people get into trouble in the Internet Properties/Connections dialog
box when they choose Always Dial My Default Connection rather than Dial
Whenever a Network Connection Is Not Present.
You can still connect to the Internet if you choose the Never Dial a Connection
option. You must summon the Connect To dialog box, like this:
1. Open the Network Connections window.
If you’re lucky, there’s a Network Connections item on the Start button’s
menu. Otherwise, you open the Control Panel and then open the Network
Connections icon.
The Network Connections window is shown in Figure 17-2. The dial-up
modem connections are listed in the Dial-Up area.

221
Chapter 17: Internet Connection Mayhem
2. Open your ISP’s connection icon in the Dial-Up area of the Network
Connections window.
This step displays the Connect dialog box, as shown in Figure 17-3.
3. Click the Dial button to make the connection.
After some annoying screaming from the modem over the PC’s speaker,
you’re connected to your ISP and the Internet.
Note that some national online services, such as AOL, may require you to
connect to the Internet by using their own icons and their own methods.
If so, follow those instructions and not what’s written here.

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
 If you have a DSL, cable, or other broadband Internet connection, you
should choose Never dial a connection from the Internet Properties/
Connections dialog box. That’s right: You don’t need to “dial” anything;
you’re always connected.
 The default connection is your preferred connection if you have more
than one. You can always select another connection, from either the list
in the Internet Options dialog box (refer to Figure 17-1) or from the
Network Connections window (refer to Figure 17-2).
The PC dials in to the Internet 
at seemingly random times
In many instances, your computer attempts for some reason to dial into the
Internet. It seems random because you may not be doing anything directly
related to the Internet at the time. Or, it may happen when you start the com-
puter. Is the computer possessed? Call the digital exorcist!
Obviously, something in your computer is trying to connect. What it could be
is anyone’s guess. The way I deal with the problem is to turn off the automatic-
connection feature, as described in the preceding section. That way, when I
see the Connect dialog box, I click the Cancel button and the computer stops
dialing into the Internet.
What if you’re always connected?
High-speed, or broadband, Internet connec-
tions are always on. If you have DSL, cable,
satellite, wireless, or even a T1 type of connec-
tion, your computer is always connected to the
Internet. In that case, you don’t ever see the
connection dialog box because the connection
is made instantly whenever you turn on your
computer. That’s the advantage to having a
high-speed Internet connection.
If you would rather not connect to the Internet
with a high-speed connection, choose File➪
Work Offline from the menu of whichever
Internet application you’re using. What this
command does is to temporarily suspend the
connection for that application; the command
makes the program pretend that it’s not talking
to the Internet. You see Working Offline
displayed on the application’s title bar.
To reconnect the application, choose File➪
Work Offline again, and the connection is
reestablished. Or, you may see a dialog box
asking you to reconnect. It’s a mere formality;
with a high-speed connection, you’re always
connected.
(The only way to truly disconnect a high-speed
connection is to turn off the DSL or cable
modem. Or, if the connection is through some
type of Ethernet cable, disconnect the Ethernet
cable. That temporarily suspends Internet
access both to and from your PC. You rarely
have any reason to do this, however.)

223
Chapter 17: Internet Connection Mayhem
 Some startup programs may connect to the Internet because they con-
fuse your Local-Area Network (LAN) address with the Internet. So, rather
than try to connect directly with some other computer that’s local to
you, the computer dials the Internet and looks for that computer. It’s
dumb, but it happens.
 The same type of situation may happen if you print to a networked
printer; your computer may attempt to dial up the Internet to try to find
the printer.
 Also consider contacting the printer manufacturer or software devel-
oper to see whether anyone there has any information on the product
dialing into the Internet. Refer to Chapter 5 for tech-support information.
 Consult with your network administrator if you suspect that your com-
puter is dialing the Internet to find a local computer. Consider changing
the local IPs to the 10.0.0.x range of addresses. Again, the network
person knows how to do this.
Connection mysteries in Outlook Express
Two mysteries must be unraveled regarding Outlook Express (OE) and your
Internet connection: The first is when OE fails to automatically connect
(which may or may not be wanted), and the second is when OE immediately
disconnects after picking up your mail, which is mostly unwanted.
Whatever the case, you need to wander off to the Options dialog box in OE:
Choose Tools➪Options. This command displays the Options dialog box.
Ensure that the General tab is selected, as shown in Figure 17-4.
Figure 17-4:
Setting 
the OE
connection
options, 
Part I.

224
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
The main thing you need to notice is the drop-down list near the middle of
the dialog box. It’s titled If My Computer Is Not Connected at This Time, and
three options are on the list:
 Do not connect.
 Connect only when not working offline.
 Connect even when working offline.
The first item is obvious: If you start OE and don’t want to dial into the
Internet, choose that option. OE should (and I’m sorry, but this is a “should”
situation) not dial into the Internet. Sometimes, it does — specifically, if you
also have checked the option labeled Send and Receive Messages at Startup.
Better uncheck that item too if you really don’t want to connect.
Another way to avoid connecting — even if you have a broadband connec-
tion — is to choose File➪Work Offline. This command tells OE to pretend that
it’s not connected to the Internet, even if it is. When you choose that option,
the second two items in the drop-down list come into play, and OE connects
or not depending on which option you have chosen.
Confused? If so, and if you really don’t want OE to connect, remove the check
mark by Send and Receive Messages at Startup and choose Do Not Connect
from the drop-down list.
 Be careful to note the commands on the drop-down list. One says If My
Computer Is Not Connected at This Time. That means that if the computer
is connected, the instructions on that list are ignored — unless you
choose File➪Work Offline, in which case OE pretends that it’s not con-
nected anyway.
 And Pooh said “Oh, bother!”
 If you detest that the Windows Messenger program always starts up
when you run OE, uncheck the item Automatically Log On to Windows
Messenger.
Disconnection mysteries 
in Outlook Express
One frustrating option in Outlook Express (OE) is found on the Connection
tab of the Options dialog box, as shown in Figure 17-5. It’s the Hang Up after
Sending and Receiving option.
If you choose that option, OE itself kills your dial-up Internet connection, no
matter what else is going on.

225
Chapter 17: Internet Connection Mayhem
I have had readers who are happily surfing on the Web discover that they
have been disconnected simply because OE has automatically picked up
some new e-mail and then disconnected. It can be a frustrating thing, espe-
cially if you don’t know where to look for turning it off. Now you know.
Missing modem guys!
Whenever a dial-up connection is active in Windows, what I call “the little
modem guys” appear in the system tray/notification area, as shown in the
margin. These guys not only let you know that you’re connected to the
Internet, but they also provide instant access to the Connect dialog box,
which can be really handy.
The first thing to assume is that the modem guys have just been shoved off
to the side, which is normal behavior. Click the Show More chevron to see
whether the fellows are merely hiding.
The second reason is that you may not have the option to show the modem
guys turned on. Check it by following these steps:
1. Open the Network Connections window.
You can do this by opening the Network Connections icon in the Control
Panel.
2. Right-click your Dial-Up Networking icon.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
Figure 17-5:
The
Connection
tab in the 
OE Options
dialog box.

4. In the dial-up connection’s Properties dialog box, click the General
tab, if necessary.
What you see should look like Figure 17-6.
5. Click to put a check mark by the option labeled Show Icon in
Notification Area When Connected.
6. Click OK to close the Properties dialog box.
You can optionally close the Network Connections and Control Panel
windows.
You may also want to refer to the section in Chapter 6 about annoying pro-
grams in the system tray/notification area for more information on things
that wither in the system tray/notification area.
Hanging up the modem without 
restarting the computer
Somewhere, someone along the line told computer users that in order to
hang up their Internet connections, they had to restart Windows. This is
dumb, dumb, dumb. Computers are much smarter than that. Such nonsense
is like telling someone to turn her car off when she pulls up to a stop sign.
It’s just not necessary.
To hang up the modem, you must click the Disconnect button in the Status
dialog box, similar to what’s shown in Figure 17-7. That hangs up the modem
and disconnects you from the Internet — no restart required.
Figure 17-6:
Controlling
the little

226
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Now, the real question is “How do you get to the Status dialog box?”
The first way is to find the little modem guys in the system tray/notification
area. Double-click them to see the Status dialog box. Or you can just right-
click them and choose Disconnect from the pop-up menu.
The second way is to open the Network Connections window (instructions
are in the preceding section) and then right-click your dial-up connection
icon and choose the Disconnect command from the pop-up menu. That
method also works just swell, though using the little modem guys is most
likely faster for you.
Losing the Connection
Internet connections drop for a gazillion reasons — anything from squirrels
on the line (I kid you not) to someone else in the house picking up the phone
extension. The phone connection is a delicate thing, and just about anything
short of wishful thinking can bring it down.
 Do you suspect your phone lines to be to blame? If so, you can have your
phone company test the wires all the way up to your house for reliability.
The wires inside your house, however, must be tested by an electrician.
See whether your ISP can recommend an electrician familiar with digital
communications.
 By the way, the phone company can do nothing to improve slow service.
It only guarantees a certain speed over its phone wires — nothing faster.
(You have to see what the speed is for your area, which depends on the
age of the equipment and, well, how lazy your particular phone com-
pany is.)
Figure 17-7:
Hang up 
the modem

227
Chapter 17: Internet Connection Mayhem

 Sometimes the connection works better at night. Radio interference
from the sun can wreak havoc with communications.
 For you people living in Oregon, the sun is that big, bright thing in the
sky that most of us see during the day.
 At two times during the year, satellite modems get interference from the
sun: during the fall and vernal equinoxes. It typically happens about
noon or so, when the satellite passes between the earth and the sun.
 Call waiting can sure knock you off the Internet. See your phone book or
features manual for information on disabling call waiting in your area.
See the following section.
 The connection can drop because of inactivity. (See the section
“Adjusting the Connection Time-Outs,” later in this chapter.)
 Sometimes, your ISP may drop the connection, especially during a busy
time of day. AOL doesn’t admit to it, but that doesn’t mean that it never
happens.
 The modem may drop the connection because of the heat. In this type of
situation, you can connect for only about 20 to 30 minutes before getting
disconnected. Ensure that your PC’s fan is working and that your com-
puter is in a well-ventilated place.
Disabling the Annoying Call Waiting
Windows can be taught to automatically switch off the call waiting feature so
that you don’t get accidentally disconnected by it when you’re on the
Internet. You do that by heeding these steps:
1. Open the Phone and Modem Options icon in the Control Panel.
The Phone and Modem Options dialog box comes forth.
2. Click the Dialing Rules tab.
3. If locations are entered, select the current location and click the Edit
button. Otherwise, click the New button to create a new location.
The location feature is best used on PC laptops, where the computer’s
location can change from place to place. On a desktop system, you need
only enter the computer’s permanent location.
After creating the location, click the Edit button to proceed to the 
next step.
4. Put a check mark by the item labeled To Disable Call Waiting, Dial.
It’s near the bottom of the dialog box, as shown in Figure 17-8.
228
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

5. From the drop-down list, select the proper dialing sequence for your
area to disable call waiting.
This information can be found near the front of your area’s phone book.
6. Click OK to close the Edit Location dialog box.
7. Click OK to close the Phone and Modem options dialog box.
You can optionally close the Control Panel window as well.
After you make these adjustments, Windows automatically disables call wait-
ing for each call the modem makes.
 For more information on using a PC laptop, get my book Laptops For
Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
 If you would rather keep call waiting on, but have the computer not dis-
connect and instead notify you, you can check out the following Web
pages for specialized software:
www.buzzme.com
www.callwave.com
www.catchacall.com
 The AOL service also has a feature, called AOL Call Alert, that notifies
you of a pending call while you’re dialed into AOL.

Humble Words of Advice for When Your
Broadband Connection Goes Bonkers
Broadband modems — those of the cable, DSL, and satellite varieties — are
really more like remote network connections than modems. Therefore, any
problems they have are most likely to be network-related problems other
than the typical problems that plague dial-up users.
The first thing to check when you suspect a problem with your broadband
modem is the modem’s lights. You see a power light, a network light, and
maybe a few other lights just for show. The one that’s most important is
the connection light, which may be the one that blinks as data is sent and
received. When that light goes out, it means that the network connection is
down. Phone your DSL provider to let it know, and follow its instructions on
what to do next.
When all the lights are on and no connection can be found, it could be that
your broadband provider is having trouble. In other words, its computers that
are kaput! In that case, all you can do is wait. Be sure to phone up the provider
after a few minutes of no Internet action to confirm that it’s having problems.
The final thing you can do when everyone else says “Nope — nothin’ wrong
here!” is to disconnect your broadband modem. Wait a while (about a minute).
Then, reconnect the thing. In many cases, that fixes the problem.
 Broadband modems are fairly robust and reliable. If your broadband
connection has been up and running for a few weeks, chances are that
it will perform flawlessly for a long time.
 When the broadband modem is inside the computer, such as on some
satellite modems, you have to turn the computer off, wait, and then turn
it on again to restart the modem.
 Yes, it’s okay to leave the broadband modem on all the time. In fact,
many ISPs and broadband providers want you to keep the modem on.
 Broadband modems go down during power outages. Consider plugging
the broadband modem into a UPS, or uninterruptible power supply. That
way, the modem stays on during brief power outages. (Sometimes, it
takes a while for the broadband connection to reestablish after a power
outage, but not if you’re using a UPS.)
Adjusting the Connection Time-Outs
To ensure that you don’t waste precious Internet connect-time, Windows has
built in a connection time-out system to disconnect your dial-up modem after
230
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

a period of inactivity. You can adjust this value up or down, or even turn it
off, which is nice. What’s not nice is that there are two places to look in
Windows XP for the time-out information. Better take these one at a time.
First comes the modem time-out settings:
1. Open the Control Panel’s Phone and Modem Options icon.
2. Click the Modems tab in the Phone and Modem Options dialog box.
3. Choose your modem from the list.
It’s probably selected already, especially when you have only one
modem in the computer.
4. Click the Properties button at the bottom of the dialog box.
Another Properties dialog box opens, one specific to your brand of
modem.
5. Click the Advanced tab.
6. Click the Change Default Preferences button.
Finally, you hit pay dirt in the modem’s Default Preferences dialog box,
as shown in Figure 17-9.
To set an automatic disconnect, put a check mark by Disconnect a Call If
Idle for More Than [blank] Mins. Then, enter the amount of minutes to
wait for a disconnect.
Figure 17-9:
The modem
time-out
setting is

231
Chapter 17: Internet Connection Mayhem

7. Make the settings your heart desires.
8. Click OK to close the Default Preferences dialog box.
9. Click OK to close the modem’s Properties dialog box.
10. Click OK to close the Phone and Modem Options dialog box.
Okay! Okay! Okay!
That’s just the first location, and they hid it most effectively, don’t you
think? The second location deals with your ISP’s connection information,
which you can get to from the Internet Options icon, also located in the
Control Panel:
11. Open the Internet Options icon in the Control Panel.
12. Click the Connections tab in the Internet Properties dialog box.
13. If necessary, choose your ISP from the list.
If you have only one ISP, it’s already selected for you.
14. Click the Settings button.
A dialog box for your ISP’s Settings appears. Believe it or not, you can
check in two places for time-out values.
15. Click the Properties button.
You’re not there yet!
16. Click the Options tab in your ISP’s Properties dialog box.
There it is! Located in the Redialing Options area is the first idle-time-
before-hanging-up item. It may be specific to redialing, but why take
chances? Set the idle time-out value to a specific number of minutes or
to Never to not hang up automatically.
17. Make your adjustments to the idle time value.
18. Click OK.
Now comes the second, more serious, time-out value setting for your ISP.
19. Click the Advanced button.
Ah, the Advanced Dial-Up dialog box is just chock-full of time-out and
idle values, as shown in Figure 17-10.
Figure 17-10:
Even more
time-out
options!
232
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

To disable the idle disconnect, uncheck the Disconnect If Idle for [blank]
Minutes option, as shown in Figure 17-10. Or, check that item and enter
the number of minutes of inactivity after which the computer should 
disconnect.
In this dialog box, you also find the handy Disconnect When Connection
May No Longer Be Needed item. That’s the item that tells Windows to
automatically display the Disconnect dialog box when you close your
last Internet application’s window — a handy item to turn on.
20. Make the necessary settings and adjustments.
21. Click OK to close the Advanced Dial-Up dialog box.
22. Click OK to close your ISP’s Settings dialog box.
23. Click OK to close the Internet Properties dialog box.
24. Close the Control Panel window while you’re at it.
Be sure to bring in the trash cans before the neighbor’s dogs get
into them!
Obviously, if you have a broadband connection, you don’t need to worry
about time-out values; you’re connected all the time anyway. Nya! Nya! Nya!
Improving Your Internet 
Connection Speed
You can do little to improve your Internet connection speed. I know that
many products out there claim to improve download times and connect
speeds and many Web pages, advertisements, and magazine articles give you
lists of things to tweak and adjust. But the time savings that are made, if any,
are minute.
The ugly fact is that connection speed is a hardware thing. Unless you get
faster connection hardware, the speed is roughly the same all the time.
Honestly, this isn’t even a troubleshooting issue.
 Even a fast Internet connection can meet with a slow Internet from time
to time. When major parts of the Internet go down or servers are turned
off for backups or upgrades, the overall speed of the Internet drops.
Again, you can do little about it.
 Some “tips” have you delete temporary Internet files, check your proxies,
reset the modem, reboot the computer, and do a host of other chants
and genuflections. Do they help? I’m not sure. But if such actions make
you feel better, by all means continue.
233
Chapter 17: Internet Connection Mayhem

 If your Internet connection gets slower over time, you can try to discon-
nect, reset the modem, and start over again.
 To reset an internal modem, simply restart Windows. You reset an exter-
nal modem by turning it off and on again. Be sure to wait before turning
the modem on again; you want to avoid a fast off-on flip of the switch,
which may not have any effect on the hardware.
 Download accelerators are available, which, although they don’t change
your connection speed, do make downloads take less time because of
how the information is managed.
 Cable modems do slow down the more people are on the circuit. So, if
you’re on the Internet and then all the neighbor kids come home from
school, that would explain a drop in connection speed.

nternet Explorer gets lots of the blame for things that aren’t really its fault.
You see, a Web browser is merely a window through which you can view
information on the World Wide Web. If a Web page screws up — which happens
often — you really have to blame the Web page itself and not Internet Explorer
for merely passing on the bad news.
Yeah, verily, even though you can pass blame off on the Web, Internet Explorer
does have enough quirks and oddities that warrant its own chapter in this
troubleshooting book.
 Throughout this chapter, I use the abbreviation IE to refer to Internet
Explorer.
 Though the information here is about IE (Internet Explorer — just 
checking to see whether you’re reading all the bullet points), much
of it applies to other Web browsers as well.

Maintaining and Configuring 
Internet Explorer
Internet Explorer is a relatively easy program to use and configure. It has only
a few areas where it tends to frustrate people. I have listed the more popular
frustrations and solutions in this section.
Changing the home page
The home page can be anything you want to see when you first start Internet
Explorer. Here’s how to set the home page to something special or to nothing
at all:
1. Start IE.
That’s Internet Explorer, in case you were silly and skipped reading this
chapter’s introduction.
2. Visit the Web page you want as your home page.
For example, visit Yahoo! or my own Web page, www.wambooli.com/.
Displaying that Web page now makes choosing it as your home page
much easier.
3. Choose Tools➪Internet Options.
You set the home page in the Internet Options dialog box, in the top part
of the General tab, as shown in Figure 18-1.
You have three choices:
• Use Current: Choose the current page as the home page. You
notice that the current page’s address appears in the box.
• Use Default: This choice would be the Microsoft preference, which
is probably the MSN home page.
• Use Blank: This option tells IE to start with a blank page — an item
popular with many folks.
4. Select whichever option you want.
For example, to switch to the page you were viewing, click the Use
Current button.
5. Click OK.
Now, that page is the first thing you see when you start IE.
These steps should reset your home page, but the change may not be for
good, as the following subsections demonstrate.
236
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

“I cannot change the home page!”
Sometimes, changing the home page may not be possible. These times
include any of the following circumstances:
 Your computer has been infected by a virus that disables your home
page selection. The solution is to run antivirus software to remove the
problem and regain control.
 Your computer has been infected with spyware or software that has
changed your home page. The official term is hijacked your home
page. The solution here is to run anti-spyware software, as covered in
Chapter 24.
 You have installed software that changes the home page for you, either
on purpose or against your wishes. The page may be a feature of a “Web
enhancement” program. The solution here is to remove that program.
 IE has been customized to prevent you from changing or using a home
page. It happens at large companies or other large institutions where the
system administrator restricts your computer’s features for security
purposes — or just to be mean.
“Why does it tell me that there’s a 
new version of Internet Explorer?”
From time to time, Microsoft releases newer versions of its software and feels
compelled to let the world know. When this happens, you don’t see your 
Figure 18-1:
Selecting a
home page.
237
Chapter 18: Web Weirdness with Internet Explorer

regular home page when IE starts. Instead, you’re redirected to an update
page. That’s normal; annoying, but normal.
 After choosing to update the software, your Web page should return to
normal. Sometimes, it doesn’t, in which case you can reread (or just
read) the section “Changing the home page,” earlier in this chapter,
about changing the page back.
 It’s up to you whether you want to upgrade to the newer version of any
program. I generally don’t do it unless the newer version offers me some
feature that I think I need or fixes a problem I’m having.
 Other Web browser software also pulls this same home-page-direction
stunt, so don’t go off blaming Microsoft for being evil or anything.
Adjusting the temporary file size
IE stores megabytes and megabytes of temporary files on disk. Officially, this
area is known as the cache (say “cash”). By storing images, sounds, text, and
other information on your computer’s hard drive, you make those Web pages
you visit frequently load faster. After all, it takes less time to load an image
from the temporary file cache than it would to squeeze that same image
through the wires connecting you to the Internet.
The problem? The temporary file size can get huge! The bigger it is, the longer
it takes IE to search through it, so cutting down on the size may truly improve
your Web browsing performance.
Here’s how to view or adjust the temporary file size for IE:
1. Choose Tools➪Internet Options.
The Internet Options dialog box appears. The center part of the General
tab deals exclusively with temporary Internet files.
2. Click the Settings button.
Various settings litter the Settings dialog box, as you would expect and
as shown in Figure 18-2. The key setting to adjust here is the amount of
disk space used for storing temporary files. That adjustment is made by
using the slider in the center of the dialog box or by manually entering a
new size in the MB (megabytes) box.
3. Adjust the size as needed.
Normally, the file size is set to about 1.5 percent of your hard drive’s
total capacity. You can adjust this setting to 1 percent, for example, and
see how that number affects things; just move the slider left or enter a
new value in the MB box.
238
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Another item to change is the first one. I would select Every Visit to the
Page to keep IE from wandering off to look for new copies of stored stuff.
If you select Never from the list, which effectively disables the cache,
you must use the Refresh command (or press the F5 key) to load a new
version of a Web page. It’s definitely an option not worth selecting.
4. Click OK.
Some folks say to delete the temporary files as another way to speed up Web
performance. I’m not certain whether that method works, though it does
increase disk space.
If you want to delete the files, simply click the Delete Files button in the
Internet Options dialog box.
Common Puzzles and Solutions
Here are a few of my favorite and most common Web browsing puzzles and
their solutions. Consider this the short list; the full list would consume many
more pages — perhaps an entire book in itself!
“The text is too small to read!”
I don’t know why some Web page designers seem hell-bent to make us old
folks squint at the computer monitor. Unless it’s the text that says “Copyright,”
way down at the bottom of the Web page, then — dernit! — I want to read it!
Figure 18-2:
Temporary
Internet file
control.
239
Chapter 18: Web Weirdness with Internet Explorer

Fortunately, IE has a solution for any Web page where you may find the text
too teeny to interpret: Choose View➪Text Size➪Larger.
If that doesn’t work, try View➪Text Size➪Largest.
What that command does is to temporarily boost the size of the text you
see on the screen. (Graphical images aren’t affected, so if the text is really
a graphic, the size doesn’t change.) Then, you can read at your leisure.
Note that this command is a page-only thing and that IE doesn’t remember
the next time around which pages you magnified.
Pop-up porn puzzles
Nothing is more shocking or irritating than a pop-up parade of porn
windows. Or, they can be any advertisements, but most often it’s shocking
pornography — not just once, but as many as 64 different windows all 
hogging up the screen. Closing the windows is like pounding down a lump
in the carpet.
I have known many people who just shut down Windows whenever the
porn pop-up parade begins. The newest version of IE, however, includes some
anti-pop-up blocking tools. To ensure that the pop-up blocker is on, choose
Tools➪Pop-up Blocker➪Turn On Pop-up Blocker. That should fix the problem.
You can make adjustments to the Pop-up Blocker by choosing Tools➪Pop-up
Blocker➪Pop-up Blocker Settings. That command displays a dialog box, as
shown in Figure 18-3. Use the Filter Level drop-down list (at the bottom of the
dialog box) to set how aggressively you want IE to block those dang pop-up
windows.
Not every pop-up window is bad, however. Some Web sites use pop-up win-
dows to display extra information. In that case, you may want to type the
Web page’s address in the text box labeled Address of Web Site to Allow.
Then, use the Add button to put that Web site on the list of OK pop-up sites.
 Other Web browsers also offer anti-pop-up features.
 Pop-up windows that appear when you try to close a Web page window
or attempt to visit another Web page are referred to as mouse traps. The
IE pop-up blocker should quash those. If not, use the Back button in IE
to back out of the suspect Web page and then close the window.
 Beyond porn pop-ups, another way to fight porn is to get antiporn soft-
ware for IE. I recommend either NetNanny or Cybersitter:

Where did the download go?
Saved a file to disk, didja? And now, you can’t find the file. It happens. Mostly,
it happens because folks are so eager to save to disk that they forget where
they saved to disk. But it’s an easy solution: Use the Search or Find command
in Windows to locate any file that was recently created. Refer to Chapter 9 for
more information.
 When you download a file, be sure to choose the option that saves the
file to disk. Don’t choose the option that runs or opens the file.
 Sometimes, it’s necessary to right-click the file’s link and choose the
Save Link to Disk option.
 Some types of files cannot be downloaded to disk. Certain MP3, Real
Audio, Flash, and other media file formats can be played only over the
Internet. Any attempt to download them results in a tiny file, which is
merely an Internet shortcut back to the original file’s location on the
Internet.
JavaScript errors, or “Error on page”
JavaScript is a programming language used to automate certain things on a
Web page. One of its features is that it can open new windows, which is how
you get those annoying pop-up window advertisements (or “infestations”).
JavaScript does good things too, such as display rollover buttons and change
graphical images on a Web page — stuff you normally wouldn’t care about
until you get a JavaScript error message.
Figure 18-3:
Knock 
down pop-
ups here.
241
Chapter 18: Web Weirdness with Internet Explorer

The telltale sign of a Javascript error is the text “Error on Page,” which
appears in the lower-left corner of the IE window.
Normally, you wouldn’t notice such a thing, and there really isn’t anything you
can do about it; the error is on the Web page, and that could exist anywhere
on the Internet on the planet earth. If you’re curious, you can double-click the
warning icon to see more information, as shown in Figure 18-4, but that’s really
of use to no one except the Web page designer or programmer.
If you find that these errors appear in the form of pop-up windows that you
must address, you can stifle them. Try these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Internet Options to display the Internet Options 
dialog box.
2. Click the Advanced tab.
3. Put a check mark by the item Disable Script Debugging.
If there are two such options, put the check mark by both of them.
4. Click OK.
You never see the error messages again.
These steps don’t disable JavaScript! They merely turn off the error message
display so that it’s just one less thing to be annoyed by.
 JavaScript isn’t the same thing as Java. No, Java is a programming lan-
guage that creates programs you can run on the Internet, such as Yahoo!
Games or MSN Games.
 Don’t bother reporting the JavaScript error to the Webmaster. I mean, well,
you can try. But it has been my experience that such reports go unnoticed.
Disabling ActiveX
ActiveX is an IE add-on that allows you to run programs over the Internet. In
many cases, the programs are helpful and innocent. But, the ActiveX programs
can also do damage, such as run nasty software on your computer or infect
your PC with a virus or install other unwanted junk. I feel that it’s best to dis-
able Active X. Here’s how:
Figure 18-4:
Yawn.
242
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

1. In IE, choose Tools➪Options to display the Internet Options dialog box.
2. Click the Security tab.
3. Ensure that the Internet icon is selected.
4. Click the Custom Level button.
The Security Settings dialog box is displayed, as shown in Figure 18-5.
5. Set the options for any ActiveX control or plug-in to Disable.
There are seven items. Choose Disable for all of them.
6. Click the OK button to confirm your settings and dismiss the Security
Settings dialog box.
7. Click OK to close the Internet Options dialog box.
After making these changes, use IE for a while and visit a few Web pages. As
you do, you may receive a warning about the page not being displayed cor-
rectly or not functioning properly because you disabled the ActiveX controls.
In many cases, that’s good news; because you don’t know what the ActiveX
control could do, saying “No” is a good idea. But, for Web sites you trust, you
may want to override the settings.
For example, if you use the Google Gmail program, you need to have ActiveX
controls working in order to read your mail. To tell IE that ActiveX controls
are okay on that page, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options in IE to display the Internet Options dialog box.
2. Click the Security tab.
3. Click the Trusted Sites icon.
Figure 18-5:
Disable

243
Chapter 18: Web Weirdness with Internet Explorer

4. Click the Sites button.
The Trusted sites dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 18-6. This is
where you can specify those sites where it’s okay for Active X controls
to run.
5. Type the name of the Web site in which you want ActiveX controls to
be run.
You can use the asterisk character (*) as a wildcard to permit subdomains
to be accessed on various Web sites. For example, in Figure 18-6, you see
*.microsoft.com, which allows all Microsoft sites (support.microsoft.
com and updates.microsoft.com, for example) to be accessed with no
restrictions.
6. Click the Add button.
This step puts that site on the list.
If you cannot add the site, ensure that the check box at the bottom of
the dialog box isn’t checked.
7. Click OK to close the Trusted Sites dialog box.
8. Close the Internet Options dialog box.
Now, you can visit those sites you trust and have them run ActiveX controls,
yet ActiveX controls on unknown sites are cut off — a good thing.
 If you find yourself locked out of more Web sites because of ActiveX
restrictions, consider changing the options for ActiveX controls from
Disable to Prompt.
 The check box at the bottom of the Trusted Sites dialog box, labeled
Require Server Verification (https:) for All Sites in This Zone, is used to
ensure that only secure Web sites appear on the list. This isn’t really
necessary for sites you know and trust, such as Microsoft or Google.
Also see the nearby sidebar, “About that HTTPS thing.”

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Printing Web pages
What seems like one of the easiest things to do can confound Internet users
like nothing else: that is, print a Web page. For some reason, this simple activ-
ity can drive people nuts. It’s not the actual printing or even finding the Print
command. It’s the results that drive people batty.
Most Web pages don’t have a fixed width, so their margins are whatever the
window size could be. Those Web pages print nicely. But, fixed-width Web
pages, or Web pages that are wider than a sheet of paper can handle, don’t
print as smoothly. Here are some things you can try:
 Choose File➪Page Setup. In the page Setup dialog box, locate the
Orientation area (in lower-left corner) and choose Landscape mode.
That may just get all the information on a page. (Choose File➪Print
Preview to confirm.)
 Save the Web page to disk. Choose File➪Save As and ensure that Web
Page, Complete is chosen from the Save As Type drop-down list. Then,
after getting the page on disk, open it in Microsoft Excel. You can then
print the whole thing across several pages, which Excel does nicely.
(Word works too, but not as well as Excel.)
 When you’re only after the text, use the mouse to carefully drag over
and select the text you want. (This procedure takes patience and prac-
tice.) Then, open your word processor and paste in the text. You may
have to do a little editing and tuning, but that way, you have more con-
trol over the text and can print it as slick as any other document.
245
Chapter 18: Web Weirdness with Internet Explorer
About that HTTPS thing
That HTTP thing you see at the start of some Web
page addresses is the abbreviation for the proto-
col used to receive the Web page. My Lord, that
is technical! Let me try again: HTTP is what tells
the Internet how to send a Web page to your
computer. Better? Anyway.
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol,
and a protocol is a set of rules and such for send-
ing information to and fro over the Internet. The
extra S you see in HTTPS stands for secure.
Such Web pages send and receive information
in an encrypted manner that is more secure than
normal HTTP over the Internet.
For example, if you do online banking or pay for
something online, you note an S at the end of the
HTTP in the Web site’s name. You may also notice
a padlock icon appearing on the bottom status
bar in Internet Explorer (or any Web browser).
That also assures you that the information you’re
sending is safe and that the Web site you’re
accessing can be trusted.

Content Advisor Woes
Internet Explorer has a feature called the Content Advisor. Its role is to con-
trol what you see on the Internet, by helping to restrict access to sites that
have what you may consider to be offensive content — like that Vegetarian
Recipes site.
I don’t recommend activating the Content Advisor. Instead, I suggest using
third-party programs, such as NetNanny and Cybersitter, which I cover in
“Pop-up porn puzzles,” earlier in this chapter. Just leave the Content Advisor
alone!
The main problem with the Content Advisor is that it’s password-protected.
So, if you make some settings and go overboard with them — but you forget
your password — tough luck! So, rather than risk using Content Advisor and
getting stuck, I feel that it’s better just to avoid the issue in the first place and
never enable the Content Advisor.
246
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
Removing the Content Advisor password
(when you have forgotten it)
It’s possible to eradicate the Content Advisor
Password, if you set it (against my advice) and
then forget it later. Here are the tricky steps:
1. Choose Run from the Start menu.
2. Type REGEDIT into the box and click the OK
button. This step runs the Registry Editor.
3. Open the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE folder.
4. Open the following folders, one after the
other: Software, Microsoft, Windows,
CurrentVersion, Policies, Ratings.
5. Click to select an item, named Key, on the
right side of the window.
6. Press the Delete key on your keyboard to
remove the Key item.
7. Click the Yes button to confirm the deletion.
8. Close the Registry Editor window.
9. Restart Windows.
10. After Windows restarts, run Internet Explorer.
11. Choose Tools➪Internet Options.
12. Click the Content tab.
At this point, you can get back into the Content
Advisor and make whatever adjustments you
need. To truly disable it, click the General tab and
remove the check mark by the item labeled
Supervisor Can Type a Password to Allow Users
to View Restricted Content. Click OK to close the
Content Advisor. Then, you can go back and click
the Disable button in the Internet Options/Content
dialog box. Good riddance to the password!

If you can remember the password, you can disable the Content Advisor:
1. Choose Tools➪Internet Options from the IE menu.
2. In the Internet Options dialog box, click the Content tab.
3. Click the Disable button.
4. Type your password (which you remember).
5. Click OK.
A dialog box appears, to tell you what you just did.
6. Click OK to get rid of the dialog box that tells you what you just did.
I don’t go into the details of Content Advisor, mostly because I seldom get
any troubleshooting questions on the subject. If you do set up restrictions,
however, you may occasionally see a message that tells you something like
“Sorry! Content Advisor doesn’t allow you to see this site.” Oh, well.
Dealing with Cookies
So it comes down to this! Cookies, huh? What do you think that this chapter
should end with — dessert? You are gravely mistaken! Cookies are nothing
you eat. On the Internet, they’re simply a bad name for a controversial Web
browsing feature.
What’s a cookie?
A cookie is merely information a Web page saves to disk — and it isn’t even
that much information; it’s more like random notes. The information is stored
on your computer in a special Cookies folder.
When you go to visit the same Web page again, it can open the cookie it
saved. That way, for example, Eddie Bauer remembers your pants size and
that you enjoy seersucker. Or, Amazon.com says “Hello, Dan Gookin!
Welcome back! Boy, have we got some books for you!” I find that handy.
Some people, however, find the whole cookie thing annoying. They would
prefer not to have a Web page save anything. And that’s fine because you can
delete cookies, disable them, turn them off, and stomp them into cookie dust!
This information is all covered in this main section.
 Web pages can open only the cookies they saved. Cookies saved from
other Web pages cannot be opened. (Even if they could, the content is
usually so specific that no critical information would be compromised.)
247
Chapter 18: Web Weirdness with Internet Explorer

 All cookies expire. Some are automatically deleted when you close IE.
Some are deleted in several hours or in a day or so. Some last for up to
six months. But they all have expiration dates, and they are, with few
exceptions, automatically deleted on those dates.
The official way of deleting cookies
If you’re in for the cookies, you can delete them, swiping them from your
hard drive like some frenzied couch potato urgently starting a crash diet:
1. Choose Tools➪Internet Options from the IE menu.
The Internet Options dialog box appears, with the General tab selected
(refer to Figure 18-1).
2. Click the Delete Cookies button.
An annoying confirmation dialog box shows up.
3. Click OK in the annoying confirmation dialog box.
Lo, all your cookies have been smote.
An unofficial (yet effective) 
way to delete cookies
Though I admonish my readers never to delete any file they didn’t create
themselves, sometimes you can delete a file you didn’t intentionally create.
One of those instances happens to be with Internet cookies, which you kinda
created, but not directly.
Yes, you can zap any or all of your cookies to kingdom come. First job: Find
the cookies.
In Windows XP, each user has his own set of cookies for each user’s account.
You need to find your own account’s cookie jar, which can be done this way:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Open the Drive C icon.
3. Open the Documents and Settings folder.
4. Open your account’s folder.
On my computer, the folder is named Dan Gookin, which, coincidentally,
happens to be my name.
5. Open the Cookies folder.
248
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Second job: Delete the cookies. There’s nothing simpler:
6. Select one or all of the cookie icons in the folder.
7. Press the Delete key on your keyboard.
They’re gone.
A-ha! A trick: I prefer to delete ancient cookies myself. So, with Details view on
the screen (choose View➪Details), I click the Date Modified column header to
sort the cookies by date. Then, I drag the mouse to delete any old, ancient
cookie on the list — anything older than three months.
Close the Cookies window when you’re done eating.
 The keyboard shortcut for selecting all the files in a window? Ctrl+A.
 Yes, cookies are simple text files. Most are only a handful of bytes long.
 The cookie is given your computer’s or your account’s name, followed
by an at sign (@) and then the Web page domain name. Note that some
Web pages save several cookies.
 You can delete an INDEX.DAT file along with the cookies. Don’t worry
about this file; IE rebuilds the DAT file when it needs to.
Preventing cookies in the first place
Why bother with cookies and deleting them? If they really bug you, turn them
off at the source. Heed these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel’s Internet Options icon.
2. Click the Privacy tab.
Yes, cookies are a matter of privacy, not really security.
3. Click the Advanced button.
The Advanced Privacy Settings dialog box appears (see Figure 18-7), but
it should really be called the Cookie dialog box.
4. Click to put a check mark by Override Automatic Cookie Handling.
You must do this step to enable the other options in the dialog box.
5. Choose Block for the Third-Party Cookies option.
That pretty much shuts down cookies from advertisers on any Web
pages you visit. If you don’t mind cookies, this is an excellent option to
choose.
249
Chapter 18: Web Weirdness with Internet Explorer

6. Choose Block for the First-Party Cookies option.
This option is necessary only if you really, really hate cookies.
Otherwise, I leave this option set to Accept.
7. Click OK to close the Advanced Privacy Settings dialog box.
8. Close the Internet Properties dialog box.
No more cookies!
 Cookies that are “stored on your computer” are any cookies that a Web
page wants to save. They don’t, however, include per-session cookies.
 Per-session cookies are deleted when you close the IE window.
 First-party cookies are cookies owned by the Web page you’re viewing.
 Third-party cookies are cookies saved by the advertisements on the Web
page you’re viewing.
 Avoid choosing the Prompt option in the Advanced Privacy Settings
dialog box (refer to Figure 18-7). Many, many Web sites use cookies.
Being prompted for all of them can certainly drive you nuts!

Death to all
cookies!

ome people just live for e-mail. Therefore, you could understand that not
getting e-mail or having trouble with an e-mail program (chiefly, Outlook
Express) can be the cause of much teeth gnashing and anguish. Nay, even
hair-pulling can accompany the many frustrations that mix with the joys of
Internet e-mail.
This chapter concentrates on e-mail as the Windows Outlook Express pro-
gram delivers it (or not, as the case may be). I am aware that lots of people
have frustrations with Hotmail and questions about Yahoo! Mail or perhaps
problems with other e-mail programs in general. But, Outlook Express is the
one program that ships with Windows, so, to keep this chapter short,
poignant, and beautiful, I concentrate only on its own troubles.
 The abbreviation OE is used in this chapter to refer to Outlook Express.
 There’s a difference between OE and the Outlook program that ships
with Microsoft Office. The programs do similar things, but they’re differ-
ent programs. This book covers only OE.

General Outlook Express Nonsense
E-mail is such a simple thing, yet your e-mail program is perhaps the most
complex application you will ever use. I could pack an entire book full of OE
tips and tricks, and not a single one of them would be considered advanced
or obtuse. That’s just the nature of the e-mail beast.
It was a tough task, but I was able to pinpoint a few key nonsensical issues
with OE and stuff these and their solutions into this section.
“The links don’t work!”
Most e-mail programs have the ability to properly interpret Web page
addresses as active links in e-mail. So, when someone types http://www.
wambooli.com/ into an e-mail message, the e-mail program properly changes
that text into a link you can click. Clicking the link opens that Web page in
your Web browser program. Or, it’s supposed to.
Sometimes, however, the links don’t work. There could be a number of reasons
why, so mull over the following solutions.
Ensure that HTML options are on. This is perhaps the most common reason
that the links don’t work: You have disabled them! Check out these steps:
1. Inside OE, choose Tools➪Options.
2. Click the Read tab in the Options dialog box.
3. Remove the check mark by the item labeled Read All Messages in
Plain Text.
4. Click OK to close the Options dialog box.
That should fix it. If not, keep working through the next set of steps:
Change the Internet connection type. You need to ensure that Windows is
properly configured to dial in to the Internet so that the links in your e-mail
can work. This advice is for dial-up Internet users only! Check to confirm that
things are properly set, by following these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Internet Options icon.
3. Click the Connections tab.
252
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

4. Ensure that the option Always Dial My Default Connection is selected.
5. Click the OK button.
Optionally, close the Control Panel’s window.
Now, give the link a try in OE and see whether it works. If not, you have still
more things to try:
Fix OE. This trick is a bit technical, but folks tell me that it works. Obey these
steps carefully:
1. Close OE in case you have it open.
2. Choose Run from the Start button’s menu.
Or, you can press Win+R on the keyboard. Either way, the Run dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 19-1.
3. In the text box, type REGSVR32, and then a space, and then
URLMON.DLL.
Don’t follow URLMON.DLL with a period! Make sure that it looks like
what you see in Figure 19-1. Carefully review your typing!
4. Click the OK button.
If all goes well, you may hear a tone and then you see a RegSvr32 dialog
box that says “DllREgisterServer in URLMON.DLL succeeded.”
If you get any other error message, you most likely mistyped the com-
mand in Step 3. Start over again in Step 2.
5. Click the OK button to dismiss the RegSvr32 dialog box.
6. Open the Control Panel.
7. Open the Internet Options icon.
8. Click the Programs tab.
9. Click the button labeled Reset Web Settings.
Figure 19-1:
Run this
complex
command to
help fix a
broken OE.
253
Chapter 19: E-Mail Calamities with Outlook Express

10. Click the Yes button in the Reset Web Settings dialog box.
Note that this step resets your Web home page as well as other settings
you may have made for cookies and Internet security.
11. Click OK when you’re told that your Web settings have been reset.
12. Click OK to close the Internet Properties dialog box.
Or, before you close the dialog box, you can review the settings on
the General, Security, Privacy, and Content tabs to reset things the
way you like.
These past few steps fix nonworking links in an e-mail message in Outlook
Express. Consider following some of the advice I offer in Chapters 17 and 18
to readjust your Internet settings.
Note that some pop-up blocker utilities may also prevent OE from opening
links in e-mail messages. Try disabling your pop-up blocker software and see
whether that helps. (See Chapter 24 for more information on pop-up blocker
software.)
“Spell check doesn’t work!”
Rotten spelling and e-mail often go hand in hand. And I’m not referring to silly
spellings, like CU L8R (“see you later”), but rather to common things like
recieve, acceptible, or preceed. To fix these mistakes in OE, you use the Spell
Check button when you’re finished composing e-mail. But, why is that button
dimmed and the command unavailable?
The answer is that spell checking is provided not by Outlook Express itself,
but by another program, either Microsoft Word or the Microsoft Works pro-
gram. (You can add Microsoft Office to the list because Office includes the
Word word processor.) If you don’t have any of those programs, spell check-
ing in OE doesn’t work.
 The solution for OE is to get Word or Works or Office. Then, spell check-
ing works.
 Note that there’s a difference between Word and Works. One is the word
processor that comes with Microsoft Office — a high-end program. The
other, Works, is for beginners and home use — or so they say.
 Other e-mail programs, such as my favorite Eudora, come with built-in
spell checking, and no other programs are required. Check out the free
version of Eudora at
www.eudora.com/

Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

“The Contacts panel is missing!”
Outlook Express divides its screen into several panels, as shown in Figure 19-2.
These panels are customizable and utterly controllable by you, though most
folks prefer to keep things set up as shown in the figure.
The problem? The Contacts list (in the lower-left corner) as well as the
Folders list (just above Contacts) have X Close buttons on them. So, it’s pos-
sible to accidentally close those panels and then freak out at their absence.
To get the missing panels back, choose View➪Layout. This command dis-
plays the Window Layout Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 19-3. You
can restore any or all or even more of the OE window by choosing the proper
items from the dialog box.

Figure 19-2:

255
Chapter 19: E-Mail Calamities with Outlook Express

For example, to restore the Contacts list, put a check mark by Contacts and
then click OK.
 You can also turn the Preview pane on or off by using the Window
Layout Properties dialog box.
 Because OE appears behind the Window Layout Properties dialog box,
you can experiment with various views and arrangements. Just click to
add or remove a check mark and click the Apply button to see how the
OE window is affected.
Receiving duplicate messages
If your ISP is sending you two copies of every message, you should check
with them first to find reasons that it may be happening. It could be a prob-
lem on their end.
If the problem isn’t with the ISP, you can check another place (isn’t that
always true?):
1. Choose Tools➪Accounts from the OE menu.
2. Click the Mail tab.
3. Select your mail account from the list.
Or, it may be the only account on the list.
Figure 19-3:

256
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

4. Click the Properties button.
Your e-mail account’s Properties dialog box appears.
5. Click the Advanced tab.
In the bottom of the dialog box is a Delivery option, as shown in Figure
19-4. If the option Leave a Copy of Messages on Server is checked, that
explains your duplicate pick-up.
6. Uncheck the box by Leave a Copy of Messages on Server.
That fixes it.
Displaying the BCC field
The problem? OE doesn’t normally display the BCC field when you go to
create a new message. BCC, the Blind Carbon Copy field, is used to send
e-mail to people secretly; e-mail addresses put in the BCC field don’t appear
when the final message is received. The stealth nature of this feature makes
the BCC field ideal for sending to a batch of people and not having each of
them see the whole list of e-mail addresses — very tidy.
The solution: Choose View➪All Headers from the New Message window. That
command displays the BCC header, and away you go.
For more information on the BCC header, refer to my book PCs For Dummies
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Figure 19-4:

257
Chapter 19: E-Mail Calamities with Outlook Express

Fragmenting large messages
Another obscure option that OE has is to split large messages into separate
chunks. I assume that this feature has some pressing, possibly historical, pur-
pose. But, most of the time, what happens is that your recipient complains
that rather than get that MPEG movie of you at Niagara Falls, he gets 50 smaller
junk files from you that make no sense.
Here’s how to prevent OE from splitting up a long message:
1. Choose Tools➪Accounts.
2. Click the Mail tab.
3. If your e-mail account isn’t selected, click it on the list.
4. Click the Properties button.
5. Click the Advanced tab.
Yes, it’s the same dialog box shown earlier, in Figure 19-4. This time, note
the Sending area. Is that item checked?
6. Uncheck the Break Apart Messages Larger than [blank] KB item.
This step tells OE not to split apart large messages.
People complain that you send 
them unreadable messages
Outlook Express sends e-mail using the Web page formatting language, HTML.
That way, you can add pictures, formatted text, and other fun things to your
e-mail, to make it more exciting than plain text.
The problem is that not everyone uses OE. Some people use e-mail programs
that cannot properly interpret the HTML-formatted e-mail that OE sends.
For those cases, you need to send those folks plain, or unformatted, e-mail.
To switch over to plain text in a New Message window, choose Format➪Plain
Text. You may see a warning dialog box, but it’s just telling you what you
need to know; click OK.
To send out all your e-mail as plain text, follow these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Options in the OE main window.
The Options dialog box appears.
2. Click the Send tab.
258
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

3. Choose Plain text from the Mail Sending Format area.
4. Click OK.
I consider the sending of plain text to be a courtesy to other, non-Windows
users on the Internet. People forget that fancy formatting and colored text
may look good on your computer, but may appear too small or even invisible
on someone else’s screen.
 When you choose plain-text formatting, the formatting toolbar in the
New Message window disappears.
 To get an idea of how your message may look in an e-mail program that
doesn’t support HTML messages, click the Source tab in the New Message
window. Yuck.
Folder Folderol
Folders are a great way to organize your e-mail — and I’m talking about folders
beyond just the basic Inbox, Outbox, Sent Items, and Deleted Items folders. As
you can see from Figure 19-2, I have many folders that I play with for stashing
and hoarding my e-mail. You should too — but this isn’t the place to lecture
you about folders. Instead, let me just get to the two key OE folder issues I
often get quizzed about.
The mystery of the Drafts folder
The Drafts folder should really be called the I’m-not-quite-ready-to-send
folder. But it’s too late to change that now! Instead, the Drafts folder merely
poses a puzzle to those who often find their e-mail in there.
How does a message get into the Drafts folder? The Drafts folder is the
Outlook Express dead-letter office. It holds e-mail you don’t want to send.
Rather than click the Send button for a message, you instead closed the mes-
sages window. OE asked whether you wanted to save the message, and you
said Yes. So, OE stuck the message in the Drafts folder, where it’s lingering
until you’re ready to try to send it again.
How does one get a message out of the Drafts folder? Open the message,
edit it if you will, and click the Send button. That sends the message off.
 Newer versions of OE tell you that the message is being saved in the
Drafts folder. Most of the Drafts folder questions I get via e-mail are from
users of older versions of OE, where it didn’t explain how the messages
got into the Drafts folder.
259
Chapter 19: E-Mail Calamities with Outlook Express

 You can also drag a message out of the Drafts folder and into any other
folder. Or, if you find that dragging doesn’t work, select the message and
choose Edit➪Move to Folder from the menu. Then, choose the destina-
tion folder from the Move dialog box.
Copying an e-mail folder to a “real” folder
E-mail folders aren’t the same thing as real folders in Windows. They’re fake
folders. In fact, an e-mail folder is nothing more than a very large text file
hidden somewhere on your PC’s hard drive. It only looks like a folder in
Outlook Express.
This folder puzzle brings up an interesting issue: How would someone save
all the messages in a folder to a real folder out there on the hard drive? The
answer is: with much time and patience.
Although you can save any individual message to disk (choose File➪Save As),
you cannot save groups of them to disk at a time. You’re stuck with going
through the folder and individually saving each message in a “real” folder on
the hard drive.
 An e-mail folder in OE is basically a long text file. OE itself splits up the
text file so that it appears that there are separate messages — but what
you’re really looking at is simply a very long text file.
 The location of the mail folder or text file is kept secret in Windows;
Microsoft really doesn’t want you messing with the files.
 They’re not exactly text files. But, they contain enough text that you can
open them in Notepad or WordPad and be able to read some of the mail.
 If you want to search for the file’s location, use the Search or Find com-
mand, as described in Chapter 9, and look for a file named INBOX.DBX.
That’s the official name of your e-mail Inbox folder and file.
Any way to undelete a message?
When you delete a message in OE, the message is put into the Deleted Items
folder and not really deleted. To undelete the message, open the Deleted
Items folder and right-click the message you want to undelete. Then, choose
Move to Folder from the pop-up menu. That command allows you to recover
the so-called deleted message to a specific folder.
260
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Unfortunately, if you empty the Deleted Items folder, the e-mail is gone for
good and cannot be recovered. Alas.
 No, not even Norton Utilities or any other unerase program can recover
e-mail deleted from the Deleted Items folder.
 To empty the Deleted Items folder, choose Edit➪Empty ‘Deleted Items’
folder. (This command is available only if messages are in the Deleted
Items folder.)
 You can also have OE automatically dump out the Deleted Items folder
every time you quit OE: Choose Tools➪Options and in the Options
dialog box, click the Maintenance tab. Put a check mark by Empty
Messages from the ‘Deleted Items’ Folder on Exit. Click OK.
Attachment Adversity
Along with e-mail comes . . . attachments! What a remarkable invention.
Attachments make boring old e-mail all the more exciting. You can see pic-
tures of the grandkids. Get a silly tune from Uncle Charlie. Or, have Aunt Ruth
forward you another e-mail virus. It’s a thrill-a-minute with e-mail attachments!
This section gives you some attachment highlights for troubleshooting. If you
want more detailed information on attachments in general, you should see
my book PCs For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), which goes into all sorts
of painless e-mail attachment detail.
You just cannot open this attachment!
Try as you can, the attachment doesn’t open. Either you have no option to
open it or, when you open it, Windows presents you with an Open With What?
dialog box, and no apparently obvious or useful choice is available. What to
do? What to do?
My advice: Give up. I’m serious. If your computer cannot open the attachment,
Windows simply lacks the necessary software. Other than rush out and buy
that software (and remember that you don’t exactly know which software it
is), there’s nothing you can do.
In this situation, I respond to the message by telling the sender that I cannot
open the attachment and asking whether they can resend it in a more common
format. For pictures, JPEG or JPG is the most common format. For documents,
HTML, RTF, and PDF are common.
261
Chapter 19: E-Mail Calamities with Outlook Express

 Those PSS files are PowerPoint Slide Show files, which people often e-mail
to others without considering that not all of us have the PowerPoint
program. (You can, however, pick up a free PowerPoint viewer from
www.microsoft.com; follow the links for Microsoft Office downloads.)
 PSD files are Photoshop images. Have the sender resend the image in
JPG format.
 WPD and WPS files are WordPerfect files: Attention, WordPerfect users:
Save your documents as either plain-text (TXT) or RTF files. Thank you.
 MPG, MOV, and AVI are movie files. They represent three different movie
file formats. Your computer is guaranteed to play at least two of them,
and the third format is the one that everyone always e-mails to you.
But my Macintosh friend swears 
that it’s a real JPG image!
The Macintosh, as well as other computers, uses a different method to identify
files on disk. In Windows, the last few characters of a file’s name (following a
period) indicate which type of file you have. So, MONALISA.JPG is a JPG file —
a graphics image. But, MONALISA.TXT is a TXT file, which is a text file.
A file extension — the .jpg part of a file that lets a Windows computer know
that you have a JPG image — isn’t required on a Macintosh. So, if some Mac
dweeb sends you a file named MONALISA, your PC will have a tough time fig-
uring out what type of file it is.
If the Mac dweeb swears that it’s a JPG file, rename the file to MONALISA.JPG
(or whatever the file’s first name is, followed by JPG).
You just can’t go around randomly naming files. If someone sends you a file
named SOMETHING, ask what type of file it is. That way, you can properly
rename the file so that Windows recognizes it.
 Text files end in TXT.
 Graphics files can end in GIF, BMP, TIFF, JPG, and a host of other file-
name extensions. You must check with whoever sent you the file to see
which type it is.
Beware of AOL .ART files
AOL uses a proprietary graphics format named ART. These files appear as
graphical images when AOL users e-mail them to each other or view them on
their own computers. But, ART files are utterly incompatible with computers
that don’t have AOL installed. (You must use AOL to view an ART file.)
262
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

If you’re an AOL user and want to send graphics, ensure that the image isn’t
an ART file. Likewise, if you receive an ART image from an AOL user, under-
stand that you cannot view it.
The solution lies on the AOL user’s side. In the Web Graphics section of the
Preferences, choose Setting B, Never Compress Graphics. That action fixes
the ART problem and makes your images more compatible with other soft-
ware and other people on the Internet.
“The attachment never got there!”
For a number of reasons, a file attachment may not make it to its recipient:
 An attachment may be too large and get rejected (based on its size) by
either your own ISP or the recipient’s ISP.
 If the recipient is using AOL, AOL doesn’t accept certain types of file
attachments.
 Antivirus or firewall software can prevent an attachment from arriving.
 The recipient may be using an e-mail program that doesn’t allow or
understand attachments.
 The recipient may not notice or may ignore the attachment.
In most cases, you can try sending the attachment again. If that fails, you
have to use a floppy disk, Zip disc, or CD-R and mail it through regular
postal mail.
Printing an e-mail attachment
OE has no method to print an e-mail attachment. Sure, you can print e-mail,
but if you just want to print the attachment, you have to save the attachment
to disk, open a program to view the attachment, and print from within that
program.
“I forward a message, and the image 
is replaced by a little red X!”
Two types of images can appear in an e-mail message: attached and embed-
ded. When you see the red X, you’re dealing with an embedded image. In that
case, you cannot forward the image, and it cannot be saved to disk. That’s
just the nature of an embedded image.
263
Chapter 19: E-Mail Calamities with Outlook Express

The solution here is to reply to the message and have the original sender
attach the image and not embed it. Here’s the difference:
To attach an image, choose Insert➪File Attachment. That way, anyone can
receive the image and save it to her hard drive, just as though it were her
own file.
To embed an image, choose Insert➪Picture. That command sticks the image
into the message body, like a picture of a Web page. The recipient can see the
message, but he may not be able to save it to disk or forward it.
Vain Efforts to Filter Spam
Congratulations if you’re one of the few who has figured out how to use the
message rules or Blocked Senders list in OE to help cut down on that filthy,
unwanted e-mail known popularly as spam.
I would love to get into the whole message-rules creation stuff, but that’s not
the point of this book. Instead, here’s a major section about various problems
that come up when you get resolutely bold in your spam-fighting efforts.
Reviewing your message rules
Alas, I don’t have the space to get into creating message rules here, though I
can help guide you with fixing them:
1. Choose Tools➪Message Rules➪Mail.
This step displays the Message Rules/Mail Rules window, as shown in
Figure 19-5.
2. Review each rule: Click a rule to select it.
Read through the rule description. Fortunately, the descriptions are
English-like, so they make sense. Watch out for rules that delete mail.
Ensure that the proper mail is getting deleted and that the rule cannot
be misinterpreted.
If you’re concerned about deleting mail, change the various mail-deleting
rules so that the mail goes instead to a specific folder, where you can
review it later.
3. Select and review the next rule.
And so on, until you have reviewed them all.
4. Close the Message Rules window.
Click OK.
264
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Be careful with rules! I once made an overly aggressive rule that deleted all
my incoming mail. Oops! Before you assume that it’s a light mail day, double-
check your rules!
Unblocking accidentally blocked senders
Rather than create rules, many people simply choose Message➪Block Sender,
which instantly deletes any new mail from a specific person. It’s a handy trick
to use because most of your unwanted e-mail does come from the same idiots
most of the time.
Occasionally, you may add someone unintentionally to the Blocked Senders
list. If so, you can easily remove that person and unblock his e-mail:
1. Choose Tools➪Message Rules➪Blocked Senders List.
You see a dialog box listing all blocked senders.
2. Scroll though the list for the person you accidentally added.
3. Highlight the name you want to unblock.
4. Click the Remove button.
This step puts the person back to unblocked status — and restores
peace in the family if she just happens to be a relative.

Chapter 20
General Windows Disruption 
(Or, “Is This PC Possessed?”)
In This Chapter
 Dealing with weird things on the screen
 Windows run amok!
 Taskbar done gone crazy!
 Properly opening a file
 Fighting programs that don’t uninstall
 The “reinstalling Windows” question
 The “reformatting the hard drive” question
A
ny time you have a visual operating system, such as Windows, you see
weird stuff on the screen. Perhaps it’s not weird, but more like unex-
pected or unwelcome. It’s like the computer is possessed at times. You may
be in the driver’s seat, but something else is definitely steering!
I don’t need to lead everyone down the fearful path of superstition and panic.
Although everyone definitely goes through PC rituals (I like pressing and hold-
ing the Enter key when I save a file), most of the weird or common disruptions
can be blamed on logical, explainable things. Granted, there are probably lots
of them, but I tried to limit this chapter’s coverage to the most common,
interesting, and, well, plain weird.
“That Looks Stupid”
Sure, it looks stupid! And, calling something stupid is quite offensive. But, you
know what? Stupid is easy to recognize. I know stupid when I see it. This sec-
tion covers some of the most stupid-looking things in all of Windows.

Screwy colors
Perhaps you intended that bright red-and-pink theme for Windows? Certainly,
the colors are striking. No? Not to you? Then, to your 4-year-old, perhaps? The
dark purple and black-on-black theme makes such a statement. Obviously, the
kid has talent!
Colors can grow screwy in two ways. The first is the most definite way, which
is when you go nuts inside the Advanced Appearance dialog box, as shown in
Figure 20-1. Windows really doesn’t care about your taste, so you can choose
some really odd combinations there — and live to regret it later.
How to undo the nonsense? If you can see the screen just fine, follow these
steps as written. If you’re having trouble seeing things, start the computer in
Safe mode to make your corrections (refer to Chapter 24 for more informa-
tion on Safe mode):
1. Right-click the desktop.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. Click the Themes tab.
4. Choose Windows XP from the Theme drop-down list.
5. Click OK.
That should fix it.
Figure 20-1:
Don’t go
nuts in 
this-here
dialog box.
268
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Well, it may not fix the screen, but it restores Windows to its standard screen
setup. At least you can get work done.
 If you have your own set of custom colors defined, I recommend saving
that set to disk as its own theme: On the Display Properties/Themes tab,
click the Save As button. Give your settings a name and click OK. That
way, you can restore your favorite colors and screen settings whenever
you like.
 For handling problems with the screen’s resolution, refer to Chapter 6.
Fuzzy icon trouble
It’s not that the icons get fuzzy, but rather that your desktop icons — and the
Start button — seem to flash or rapidly change color — like the transporter
effect from Star Trek. That’s the sign of a bad or corrupted video driver. Refer
to Chapter 6 for information on upgrading or restoring your video driver.
Jiggling icons
The infamous jiggly icon weird thing happens like this: You go to point the
mouse at an icon, and the icon moves away from the mouse. You try again,
and the same thing happens. It’s like the icons are afraid of the mouse.
Annoying? Or, could it be amusing?
You see, this jiggly icon thing is someone’s idea of a joke. I consider it to be 
a virus, not a prank. The virus exists as an e-mail attachment that’s probably
hanging on some message in the Outlook Express Inbox.
The quick solution: Go through your Inbox and remove every message. Just
empty the Deleted Items folder: Choose Edit➪Empty ‘Deleted Items’ Folder.
That fixes it in a drastic way.
If you want to be less drastic, just go through your Inbox and look for any
e-mail with an attachment. Graphics attachments are okay, but anything else
is suspect as the cause of the virus. Delete ’em.
Of course, buying and using antivirus software would prevent this and other
viruses from happening in the first place.
269
Chapter 20: General Windows Disruption (Or, “Is This PC Possessed?”)

Getting more stuff on the screen
You can’t make the screen bigger. I wish you could! But no such thing as a
screen-stretcher exists; a 17-inch monitor can display only so much informa-
tion. If you want more stuff on the screen, the solution is to increase the
screen’s resolution.
Chapter 6 contains information on setting the screen’s resolution. Look there
for more information.
Resetting the screen’s resolution to something higher makes things look
smaller on the screen. You can do two things:
First, in your applications, you can take advantage of the Zoom command,
usually found on the View menu. The Zoom command magnifies the contents
of the window so that everything is easier to read.
Second, you can make Windows own icons appear larger:
1. Right-click the desktop.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
This step conjures up the Display Properties dialog box.
3. Click the Appearance tab.
4. Click the Effects button.
5. Put a check mark by the Use Large Icons item.
6. Close the various dialog boxes.
When the last one is closed, you see the new, larger icons on the screen.
You can also use a command to change the icon size on the Start button’s
menus, though these are already set to Large in most configurations. To
check the icon size on the Start button menu, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the Start button.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
3. Click the Customize button.
You see two Customize buttons. Click the top one, next to the Start
menu item.
The Customize Start Menu dialog box appears. The icon size item is
right there on top on the General tab.
270
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

4. Choose Large Icons (if it’s not chosen already).
5. Click OK and then OK again.
The window has slid off the screen
Moving a window on the screen is so easy that few beginning Windows books
even bother to explain it in any detail: You use the mouse to drag the window
around. Simple. But it’s not so simple when you can’t pinch the top part of
the window by using the mouse. In fact, I have known some folks who get so
desperate to get the window back that they just end up reinstalling Windows.
Bad move!
The trick to getting any window to move when it’s off the screen is the same
trick you use to move a window when the mouse is broken: Use the keyboard!
These steps assume that a window you want to move is on the screen. Click
that window to make it “on top” and selected and then follow these steps:
1. Press Alt+spacebar.
This command activates the window’s Control menu.
2. Press M, for move.
Now, you can use the keyboard’s arrow keys to move the window.
3. Press the left, right, up, or down arrow to move the window in that
direction.
4. When you’re done moving the window, press the Enter key.
The window is too large for the screen
Resizing a large window is next to impossible when you can’t grab its edges
with the mouse. The solution here is to use the keyboard to help resize the
window:
1. Ensure that the window isn’t maximized.
You cannot resize a maximized window; click the Restore button (the
middle button in the window’s upper-right corner) to unmaximize the
window.
2. Press Alt+spacebar.
This keyboard command drops down the window’s Control menu.
271
Chapter 20: General Windows Disruption (Or, “Is This PC Possessed?”)

3. Press S, for size.
You can now move each of the window’s four sides in or out. You do that
by first choosing a side and moving the side in or out.
4. Press the left, right, up, or down arrow to move that side of the window.
For example, press the left-arrow key to choose the left side of the
window.
5. Use the left–right or up–down arrow keys to move the window’s edge.
For example, if you chose the left side of the window, press the left or
right arrow keys to move that side of the window.
6. Press Enter when you’re done resizing that edge.
7. Repeat Steps 2 through 6 to resize another edge of the window.
For example, to resize the bottom edge of the window, press Alt+
spacebar, S, and then the down-arrow key to select the bottom edge.
Then, use the up- or down-arrow keys to move that edge in or out.
These steps may seem confusing, but if you work through them and mess
with the window’s size, they make sense. Just be thankful that such an alter-
native window-resizing technique exists.
The window is too tiny
Windows remembers the size and position of any window you open on the
screen. When you return to a program or open a folder again, Windows sticks
the window back in the spot in which it originally existed and at the same
size as when you last used the window.
The problem is that sometimes Windows restores a window that you have
resized to be very tiny. Most people just maximize the window at this point,
but the problem is that Windows doesn’t remember maximized windows. No,
instead, the window is opened again at its tiny size.
The solution is to resize the window without maximizing it: Use the mouse to
drag out the window’s edges (top, bottom, right, left) to the size and position
you prefer on the screen. With the window larger — but not maximized — you
can close it. Then, when that window is reopened, it opens to the larger size.
The taskbar has moved
On my long sheet of Windows regrets is the ability to move the taskbar. I’m
certain that someone at Microsoft thought it would be handy to have a taskbar
272
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

on the left, right, or top of the computer screen. In practice, in my experience?
I have never seen a taskbar anywhere except the bottom of the screen. Even
so, the ability to move the taskbar exists, and many people do accidentally
move it — and then desperately want it back on the bottom.
You can move the taskbar just as you can move any window on the screen:
Drag it with the mouse. The key, however, is to close all open windows so that
you can easily grab the taskbar with the mouse.
To move the taskbar back to the bottom of the screen, follow these steps:
1. Point the mouse at the taskbar (on a spot that has no buttons).
2. Press the mouse button.
3. Drag the mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen.
If these steps don’t work, you can try using the keyboard and mouse together:
1. Click the taskbar once.
Click a blank spot that has no buttons.
2. Press Alt+spacebar.
This step pops up a menu, as shown in Figure 20-2. If not, start over
again with Step 1.
3. Press M, for move.
4. Press and hold the down-arrow key until the mouse pointer is close to
the bottom of the screen.
If this step doesn’t move the taskbar, press the left-arrow key and hold it
down. If that doesn’t work, press the right-arrow key and hold it down.
5. Click the mouse when you’re done.
The object is to use the keyboard to move the mouse pointer to where you
want the taskbar. Use all four arrow keys — left, right, up, and down — to
move the taskbar.
Figure 20-2:

273
Chapter 20: General Windows Disruption (Or, “Is This PC Possessed?”)

 Yes, you can accidentally move the taskbar. It happens all the time.
 Also, mean people move or hide the taskbar. They call it a practical joke,
though there’s nothing practical about it, nor is it funny.
 If the moving taskbar frustrates you, lock it down. See the section
“Locking the taskbar,” later in this chapter.
The taskbar has disappeared
The taskbar cannot disappear, but it can hide. It can also grow so thin as to
seem invisible, although it’s still there.
First, make sure that you’re not using a program in full-screen mode, which
would hide the taskbar. Most full-screen programs keep one button or menu
item available to allow you to de-full-screen the program. Or, you can try
pressing the F10 key to summon the menu bar and try to restore the screen.
In Internet Explorer, press the F11 key to unzoom from full-screen mode.
Second, see whether the taskbar is simply too skinny to see. Check each edge
of the screen for a thin, gray strip. If you find it, you have found the taskbar:
Point the mouse at the strip, and it changes into an up-down pointing arrow
(or a left-right pointing arrow if the taskbar is on the side of the screen).
Press the mouse button and drag the mouse toward the center of the screen.
As you drag, the taskbar grows fatter. Release the mouse button when the
taskbar is the proper size.
Third, the taskbar may be automatically hidden, which is an option. To check,
point the mouse to where the taskbar normally lives and wait. The taskbar
should pop right up. (If not, try pointing at the other three edges of the screen
to see whether some joker moved and hid the taskbar.)
If the taskbar pops up, you can switch off its autohide feature:
1. Right-click the Start button.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
The Taskbar and Start Menu Properties dialog box appears.
3. Click the Taskbar tab.
You see a dialog box specifically customized to deal with taskbar ways
and woes, as shown in Figure 20-3.
4. Remove the check mark by the item labeled Auto-Hide the Taskbar.
5. While you’re at it, click to select the item labeled Keep the Taskbar on
Top of Other Windows.
6. Click OK.
274
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Locking the taskbar
There’s a solution for all this taskbar madness! After many releases, finally in
Windows XP you can blissfully lock down the taskbar:
1. Right-click the Start button and choose Properties from the pop-up
menu.
2. Click the Taskbar tab.
3. Ensure that there’s a check mark by the item labeled Lock the Taskbar.
4. Click OK.
You get two subtle visual clues that the taskbar has been locked. The first 
is that the extra “lip” atop the taskbar disappears. The second is that the
dimple dots that separate toolbars on the taskbar go away; yes, the various
toolbars on the taskbar cannot be resized after the taskbar is locked.
“The menu, button, or some other element
in the program, is missing!”
Without listing the 50,000 variations for every program and application, gen-
erally speaking you can fix missing visual elements by checking either the
View or Window menu.
Figure 20-3:
Control the

275
Chapter 20: General Windows Disruption (Or, “Is This PC Possessed?”)

The View menu can contain commands that control which toolbars and but-
tons are visible.
The Windows menu controls which of the windows or palettes are visible.
Before giving up, consider checking the View or Windows menu for the miss-
ing things you yearn for.
You Open the File and You Get Crap
It’s supposed to work like this: You choose File➪Open and pluck out a file,
and there it sits on the screen, all happy and eager to be edited or otherwise
messed with. But, what really happens is this: You choose File➪Open or you
double-click some icon to open it, and you get . . . crap! Not the content, but
visually: junky text. It’s definitely not what you saved. What happened?
First, it’s not your fault. (You may remember that from Chapter 1.)
Second, you may be using the wrong format to open the file, which is a
common screw-up in most Open dialog boxes.
Suppose that you try to open a file in Word just to recover text. If so, choose
the option Recover Text from Any File (*.*) from the Files of Type drop-down
list in Word’s Open dialog box, as shown in Figure 20-4. So, you open the file
and mess around and you’re happenin’.
Figure 20-4:
Beware the
Files of 
Type drop-
down list!
276
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Then, you go to open the document you have been working on and . . . you get
crap! Okay, maybe it’s not pure ugliness, but you may notice that your for-
matting is gone or that perhaps random characters have infiltrated the text.
Or, in a graphics program, the colors may be all screwed up.
Relax! What happened is that you misused the Open dialog box and opened a
file of one type as another. For example, if you open a Word document but
choose Recover Text from Any File (*.*) from the Files of Type drop-down list
in Word’s Open dialog box, you see plain text on the screen — not a formatted
Word document.
The solution is to close the document. Don’t save any changes! Then, reopen
the document by first selecting the proper document type from the Files of
Type drop-down list in the Open dialog box.
 This error is quite common, particularly with Microsoft Word.
 Sometimes, files do get corrupted. If the file still opens as garbage, it prob-
ably is garbage. That happens, usually because of some type of disk error.
Run ScanDisk on your hard drive to check for errors; see Chapter 23.
Uninstalling Uninstalled Programs
You never delete a program from Windows. No, you’re supposed to uninstall
it instead. You use the Add/Remove Programs icon on the Control Panel,
choose the installed program, and then schedule it for proper termination
and removal. That’s the proper way to remove the software.
Secretly, what the Add/Remove Programs window does is to run the installed
program’s Uninstall routines. That’s a special program — often, the same pro-
gram that installed the software — which goes about removing bits and pieces
of the program, redoing settings, and doing other necessary things in a com-
plex operating system like Windows. All those tasks are necessary, which is
why simply deleting a program is considered a no-no.
Another way to uninstall
Many programs put their uninstall utility on the Start thing’s Programs menu,
right there with other commands. For example, the Zone Alarm firewall soft-
ware, from Zone Labs, puts its Uninstall command right there on the Start
menu along with other commands, as shown in Figure 20-5. Choosing the
Uninstall command removes the program. Of course, not every program’s
developer is as smart as Zone Labs.
277
Chapter 20: General Windows Disruption (Or, “Is This PC Possessed?”)

 Using firewall software is covered in Chapter 24.

Use CleanSweep, my boy!
When you’re having serious uninstall issues, my best suggestion is to buy the
Norton CleanSweep program. CleanSweep does a much, much better job of
analyzing a program’s installation so that uninstalling the same program with
CleanSweep yields fewer problems. Plus, CleanSweep archives uninstalled
programs so that you can reinstall bits and pieces of it later, if that proves
necessary. I highly recommend this product, though you should be aware
that it works best on applications installed after CleanSweep is installed.
For more information on CleanSweep, see www.symantec.com/.
Giving up and deleting the damn programs
This suggestion is rather sneaky: You may notice that after you attempt to
uninstall a program the “real” way, remnants of the program still litter your
hard drive. In this case, my advice is simple: Delete the remnants. Specifically,
delete any files left in the application’s main folder.
Suppose that you do away with a program named Last Continent to be
Discovered Online (LCDO). You have resigned from the service. You have
uninstalled the program. Yet, you notice that you still have an LCDO folder
with plenty of files installed. In that case, feel free to delete that folder and 
its contents.
This action may have adverse side effects, so be prepared to undelete the
folder if necessary. Or, better, just rename the folder and see whether it
affects anything. Rename the LCDO folder to LCDO.KILL, for example. If this
Figure 20-5:
The uninstall
program is
on the Start
thing’s
Programs
menu.
278
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

trick doesn’t seem to bother the rest of Windows, feel free to delete the folder
and its contents.
 I recommend that you don’t delete any program that you didn’t create
yourself. However, if a program doesn’t fully uninstall and you need the
disk space, you can delete remnants of the program from its old folder.
 Don’t delete any program remnants saved in the Windows folder or any
of the subfolders beneath the Windows folder.
 Sometimes, the remnants are left around in the hope that you may rein-
stall the program later. For example, I uninstalled a game, but noticed
that it kept personal data — saved missions and high scores — in the
folder.
 You can freely delete remnants such as shortcut icons: Right-click any
shortcut icon and choose Delete from the pop-up menu to rid yourself of
that icon. You can do that on the desktop as well as on the Start menu.
 Feel free to delete any .zip or .exe files you downloaded. After installing
that software, you can delete the original download — if you like. (I tend
to keep those files.)
 Sometimes, new computers come with folders full of yet-to-be-installed
programs. For example, the Online or similar folders may contain icons
for various online systems. Delete ’em all!
 Also consider checking with the System Configuration utility (MSCONFIG)
and its Startup tab to see whether bits and pieces of the program are
still being started there. (LCDO is notorious for this.) See Chapter 24 for
more information on the System Configuration Utility.
The uninstalled program remains on the
stupid Add/Remove Programs list
Here’s a pain in the arse: You do everything properly and go about uninstalling
a program the way Lord Gates intended, yet the stupid program name still
appears on the list of installed programs in the Add or Remove Programs
dialog box. How maddening! How rude! How wrong!
The solution is surgical:
1. Carefully note the name of the program as listed in the Add/Remove
Programs dialog box.
2. Close the Add/Remove Programs dialog box.
3. Choose Run from the Start menu.
279
Chapter 20: General Windows Disruption (Or, “Is This PC Possessed?”)

4. Type REGEDIT into the box.
5. Click OK.
This step runs the Registry Editor.
6. Open the following folders:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Software
Microsoft
Windows
CurrentVersion
Uninstall
This location is where Windows keeps the installed program list for the
Add/Remove Programs dialog box.
7. Look for your program’s folder inside the Uninstall folder.
The folder is named with the program name or perhaps the developer’s
name. If you can’t find the folder, give up! The program most likely has
some other tricky way of removing itself and has already outguessed
you here.
8. Select your program’s entry.
9. Press the Delete key on the keyboard.
10. Click the Yes button when you’re asked to confirm.
The item is now gone from the list.
The Big, Scary Question of 
Reinstalling Windows
At some point, reinstalling Windows became acceptable. And, I’ll be honest:
Reinstalling Windows works. It absolutely restores your computer to the way
it was when you first got it or when Windows was last upgraded. It’s a guaran-
teed fix, but it’s a cheat.
It’s a cheat because you usually have a simpler, easier way to fix the problem
than to resort to reinstalling Windows. For example, consider going to the
doctor for an irregular heartbeat, and she recommends a heart transplant.
Or, go to a mechanic because your engine knocks, and he recommends
replacing the entire engine. Reinstalling Windows is the same overblown,
waste-of-time solution.
280
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Fundamentally, an operating system should never need to be reinstalled. Just
quiz a Unix wizard on how many times he has to reinstall Unix, and you get
this puzzled, insane look. Even in the days of DOS, reinstalling DOS was never
considered a solution. But, with 12-minute time limits on tech-support phone
calls (refer to Chapter 5), suddenly reinstalling Windows isn’t only a potential
solution, most often it’s the solution.
Poppycock!
 Reinstalling Windows is a solution only when the system has become so
corrupted that no other solution exists. For example, if your computer is
attacked by a virus or somehow major portions of Windows are destroyed
or deleted, reinstalling Windows is an option.
 Reinstalling Windows is also necessary to recover from a botched oper-
ating system upgrade.
 Yes, often, reinstalling Windows does fix the problem. But it has also
been my experience that it has caused more problems than it has solved. 
I feel that tech-support people who recommend it should be held per-
sonally and legally responsible for the consequences of such a drastic
recommendation.
 No, reinstalling Windows isn’t the same thing as rebuilding the kernel in
Unix. The kernel is one file, similar to Windows own KERNEL32.DLL file.
In fact, you can reinstall single files in Windows, which is one way to
avoid reinstalling every file. You do this by using the System File Checker
(SFC) utility, which is covered in Chapter 24.
“Are there any benefits to 
reinstalling Windows?”
I have been to various Web sites that tout the virtues of reinstalling Windows.
It’s almost a religious experience for them, like getting a high colonic. The
sites remind me of reading those ancient alchemy, or “medical,” documents
that heartily recommend drinking mercury to cure a fever.
Argument 1: Reinstalling Windows removes much of the junk that doesn’t get
uninstalled when you remove programs. So (blah, blah, blah), you end up with
a cleaner system.
Rebuttal 1: Well, yeah, you end up with a cleaner system until you reinstall all
your applications, which reintroduces all the junk right back into the system.
Cleaner system? No. Wasted time? Definitely!
281
Chapter 20: General Windows Disruption (Or, “Is This PC Possessed?”)

Argument 2: Reinstalling Windows results in a faster system.
Rebuttal 2: No argument there. But, the reason that it’s faster is that reinstalling
has the marvelous effect of defragmenting the entire hard drive, especially
nonmovable clusters. So, like, duh! The system is faster — for a time. Frag-
mentation eventually does creep back in.
Rebuttal 2 1⁄2: Also, don’t forget the time wasted reinstalling Windows. Count
your computer system down for at least half a day.
Argument 3: Reinstalling Windows fixes a number of problems.
Rebuttal 3: You can fix problems without reinstalling Windows.
I could go on. And, I would love to, but I have run out of arguments in favor
of reinstalling Windows. If you hear of any, please e-mail them to me for this
book’s next edition: dgookin@wambooli.com. Thanks!
What about reformatting the hard drive?
Reformatting the hard drive is another evil activity that’s foisted on the com-
puting public as a necessary thing. It’s not. In fact, you should never, ever,
have to reformat your computer’s hard drive. It’s something they do at the
factory. It’s something a computer technician does. It’s no longer anything a
computer user has to do.
As with reinstalling Windows, in only one circumstance do I suggest reformat-
ting a hard drive: when a virus has attacked the computer so thoroughly that
the only solution to rid it of the virus is to reformat the hard drive. And, that’s a
pretty rare thing; an ugly thing; a thing that I hope never happens to you.

A
fter several trial versions of Windows, Microsoft finally hit its stride with
Windows XP. It’s not a bad version of Windows, nor is it a bad operating
system, as far as operating systems go. The proof of this is that many of the
old jokes about Windows just don’t get laughs any more. Few people really
remember the pain associated with a “General Protection Fault.” Fewer still
have even seen that infamous Blue Screen of Death. It’s all trivia now.
As part of its new robustness, Windows is laden with a slew of interesting
places to visit and things to try that can help you review your PC’s state,
diagnose errors, or help resolve certain problems. This chapter covers those
things and gives you more resources to review while you attempt to diagnose
exactly what the heck is wrong with your PC.
Windows Event Logs
Whenever a little kid gets a booboo, he rushes off to find his mother or any
handy parental-unit-type person. The booboo is displayed. In return, verifica-
tion and sympathy are given. Perhaps a bandage is prepared, and finally a kiss
is applied to make everything better. The child then goes off and continues
performing the same activity that caused the booboo in the first place. Such
is life.

In your computer, electronics imitates life. When a booboo happens,
Windows XP makes a note of it. Sometimes, the note is helpful; sometimes,
it’s not. But all of the time the note confirms that the booboo has happened,
and validation is an important part of that process.
In the computer, the booboo is referred to as an event. The thing that keeps
track of events is the event log. Here’s how to view the thing in Windows:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Administrative Tools icon.
You may also be able to get to Administrative Tools from the main Start
thing menu, if Windows is configured that way.
3. In the Administrative Tools window, open the Event Viewer icon.
This step opens the Event Viewer window, which is shown in Figure 21-1.
The left side of the window lists three event logs that Windows keeps
track of: Application, Security, and System. The right side lists the indi-
vidual events, as shown in the figure.
Here are some of the types of events that can be listed in the Event
Viewer:
• Error: Could indicate a major problem. Basically, an Error event
means that something went wrong.
• Warning: For events not as serious as error events, but things you
should potentially be aware of.
Figure 21-1:
The Event
Viewer tells
the tale.
284
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

• Information: Indicates that a successful or normal operation has
begun, been completed, or perhaps anything else that happens and
is noted in the event log.
4. To view the details of an event, double-click the mouse to open that
event.
For example, in Figure 21-2, you see the details of a failed disk operation.
The date and time are given, along with the other information. The
Description area details the message and often shows you a link you can
click for more information on the Web. Finally, a data dump is listed at the
bottom of the dialog box, which is information only a techy would love.
Many details in the dialog box also appear in the Event Viewer window’s
columns.
5. Close the various windows when you’re done looking around.
The Event Viewer is good in two instances. First, when you suspect that
there’s a problem, you can quickly open the Event Viewer to ensure that
you’re not crazy. For example, when I recently experienced CD-ROM drive
problems, a quick check of the Event Viewer confirmed that the computer
was having trouble.
Second, the Event Viewer can alert you to certain problems you may not
know about. For example, I noticed just now that I was getting W32Time
Warning errors (Figure 21-1). That explains why my computer’s clock is
Figure 21-2:
Details of a
specific

285
Chapter 21: Windows Can Be Your Friend

wrong. After reading the event log, it explained that the time server I’m using
is no longer available. A quick trip to the Date and Time icon in the Control
Panel fixes that up just fine!
 The Event Viewer is also part of the Computer Management console in
Windows XP.
 You can quickly start the Event Viewer by using the Run command. Type
EVENTVWR.MSC into the box and click the OK button.
 The technical information at the bottom of each event detail is really of
use only to the programmer or to someone who has access to the pro-
gram’s code. Tech-support people don’t need to see it. I don’t want to
see it. You may remember what I say in Chapter 5: Give the tech-support
people only what they ask for. That keeps them happy.
Shutting Down All Running Programs
One of the most common yet frustrating tasks a computer user faces is giving
the order to “shut down all running programs” when installing new software.
Believe it or not, such a thing isn’t an ordeal. But, it’s a serious question that
folks raise, and one that’s answered in this section.
How to shut down all your 
running programs
Most programs you install like to install themselves with no other software
running on the computer. So, they say, right there in the setup instructions,
“Please quit all other programs now, before you install the Mondo Number
Whacker 3000.” Of course, they don’t tell you how to shut down other pro-
grams or even why.
The why I’m guessing at: Most new programs need to restart Windows to fully
install. Because the computer is restarting, it’s a good idea to save your docu-
ments. By quitting other programs, you’re ensuring that your documents are
saved.
The second why-reason is that some installation programs monitor what the
computer is doing so that the software can be successfully uninstalled at a
later date. Having a second program running, and writing stuff to disk, during
that operation may screw things up. It’s just best to shut down your other
running programs. Here’s how:
286
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

1. Press Alt+Tab.
This command switches your focus to the next running program or open
window.
2. If pressing Alt+Tab does nothing — you just return to the same Install
or Setup program window, for example — you’re done. Otherwise:
3. Close the program or window.
4. Start over with Step 1.
By using Alt+Tab, you can successfully switch to each running program and
shut it down, one after the other. When Alt+Tab doesn’t appear to work any
more, you’re done shutting things down and can continue with the installation.
Don’t bother trying to shut down any processes. No, the advice is to shut
down other running programs. Windows has lots of processes going, and I
don’t recommend that you kill them all off just to install a new program.
(Processes are killed in the Task Manager’s Processes tab.)
Disabling your antivirus, 
firewall, and so on
After you shut down any running programs, the next annoying thing you’re
requested to do for a new software installation is to shut down or disable
your antivirus software. You may also be asked to disable the Internet fire-
wall. Yeah, in other words, strip naked and bare your computer’s soul to the
cruel universe!
Well . . . it’s not that terrible.
Most antivirus and firewall programs leave their marks as icons in the system
tray/notification area. Shutting them down or disabling them is as easy as
finding their tiny icons and right-clicking them. From the pop-up menu that
appears, choose a Suspend, Disable, or even Shutdown command, to tem-
porarily do away with that icon’s papa program.
For example, in Figure 21-3, the tiny icon representing the Norton AntiVirus
program appears. After you right-click the icon, a menu pops up. Choosing
the Disable command from that menu temporarily suspends the antivirus
program, which allows you to install a new program.
Similar steps can be taken for your firewall. For example, to shut down the
Zone Alarm firewall, right-click its icon and choose the Shutdown command
from the pop-up menu.
287
Chapter 21: Windows Can Be Your Friend

Immediately after installing the new software, be sure to restart Windows.
That way, you ensure that your antivirus, firewall, and any disabled software
are restarted as well.
Processes and Services Here, 
There, and Everywhere
The Processes tab in the Windows Task Manager window displays all the pro-
grams and individual processes going on in your computer. It’s a like a peek
into the computer’s brain; you see everything, even supersecret programs
that the operating system runs behind the scenes, as shown in Figure 21-4.
To see the Task Manager window, press Ctrl+Alt+Delete on the keyboard. You
can also use the Run command from the Start menu (or press Win+R) and type
TASKMGR into the box. Then, click the Processes tab to see which processes
are running on your computer.

Processes

shown in
the Task
Manager.
Figure 21-3:
Disabling
Norton
AntiVirus.
288
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Some processes are linked to the programs that are running, which are dis-
played in the Applications window. Otherwise, the processes are started by
programs that run when the computer starts, some processes are represented
as icons in the system tray/notification area, and some processes are part of
Windows and carry out specialized tasks.
You can end a process by selecting it in the Processes window and clicking
the End Processes button. But, I suppose, that’s a bad thing to do. Indeed,
there’s a better way to disable and even prevent some specific processes
from running.
Close the Windows Task Manager window, if it’s open.
The processes, or services, that Windows runs are controlled from the
Services console, which can be accessed from the Administrative Tools
window. Here’s how:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Administrative Tools icon.
Your version of Windows may also be configured to show Administrative
Tools as a menu item on the Start button’s menu.
3. In the Administrative Tools window, open the Services icon.
This step opens the Services console window, which is shown in
Figure 21-5. The left side of the window is pretty much useless; all the
action happens on the right, which lists all the services available to
Windows or those installed by various applications. Various columns
display information about the services, but you can get specific infor-
mation by clicking a resource, as shown in the figure.
4. Double-click the Messenger service to open it.
Locate the Messenger service on the list, and then double-click it to dis-
play the dialog box that controls that service, similar to what’s shown in
Figure 21-6.
In the Messenger Properties dialog box (refer to Figure 21-6), there are
buttons available to start, stop, pause, or resume the service’s activity.
For stopping a service, clicking the Stop button here is preferred over
ending the service’s process in the Task Manager window.
Note that you can also prevent a service from even starting by choosing
Disabled from the Startup Type drop-down list (in the middle of the dialog
box’s General tab).
5. Click OK to close the Properties dialog box, and close the Services
window and any other open windows.
289
Chapter 21: Windows Can Be Your Friend

You may be directed to disable or stop a service as part of some trouble-
shooting activity. Or, some Web pages recommend disabling certain services
merely as a way to optimize your PC’s performance. I cannot vouch for any
Web sites, but when you find them, you then know where to go to carry out
their recommended tasks.

290
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

 Don’t go around disabling or stopping services unless you’re directed to
do so by a reliable source.
 The Services thingy is also part of the Computer Management console in
Windows XP, just like the Event Viewer (covered earlier in this chapter).
 You can quickly start the Event Viewer by using the Run command. Type
SERVICES.MSC into the box and click the OK button.
Checking System Restore
The System Restore tool should always be on and running. If it’s not, you
need to check a few things or even fix the program. This section offers some
suggestions and help.
Confirming the status of System Restore
The System Restore control center is found in the System Properties dialog
box. Here’s how to get there from wherever you are:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the System icon.
3. Click the System Restore tab.
The System Restore tab displays summary information about System
Restore. Most importantly, there you find a check box labeled Turn Off
System Restore on All Drives.
4. Ensure that there’s not a check mark in the box labeled Turn Off
System Restore on All Drives.
Unless you’re running an alternative System Restore-like utility, keep
Windows System Restore on!
5. Close the dialog box and various windows when you’re done with them.
The following subsections delve deeper in the System Restore tab of the
System Properties dialog box.
 When you turn System Restore off, Windows automatically deletes all
the Restore Points for that drive. Don’t expect them to magically reap-
pear if you decide to reenable System Restore later!
 One alternative program to System Restore is the Go Back utility, sold by
Symantec (the Peter Norton people).
291
Chapter 21: Windows Can Be Your Friend

Setting the amount of disk space 
used by System Restore
Face it: System Restore is just a quick-and-dirty utility that helps people
become lazy. If you seriously backed up your computer’s hard drive, you
wouldn’t need System Restore. But, it exists, so you may as well take advan-
tage of it.
On the downside, System Restore is a great consumer of hard drive space.
When disk space is low, or when you back up anyway, you may consider
reducing the copious amount of storage space System Restore consumes.
Here’s how:
1. Open the System Properties dialog box and the System Restore tab
therein.
Refer to the preceding section.
2. If more than one hard drive is listed in the window, click to select it.
3. Click the Settings button.
You see a dialog box illustrating how System Restore consumes space on
the hard drive, as shown in Figure 21-7.
4. Adjust the slider to the left to decrease the amount of disk space used
by System Restore.
Or, if you find yourself using System Restore often, increase the disk
space it uses by moving the slider to the right. The more room, the
more Restore Points the utility can remember.
292
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 
Peering deeply at the System Restore service
The System Restore program automatically cre-
ates restore points as you use Windows. That’s
because System Restore is run as a service,
going on all the time in Windows XP. To find the
service, refer to the section, “Processes and
Services Here, There, and Everywhere,” earlier
in this chapter. You’re looking for a service
called System Restore Service. (This is a look-
only exercise.)
If there are any problems with the System
Restore Service, they appear in the Event log.
Refer to the section, “Checking the Event Logs,”
earlier in this chapter. In the Event Viewer win-
dow, choose the System event category. Then
on the right side of the window, click the Source
column heading to sort the list by the source.
Any System Restore errors or events appear
under the source System Restore Services.

5. Click OK.
6. Repeat Steps 2 through 5 for any additional hard drives monitored by
System Restore.
7. Close up everything when you’re done.
Note that on hard drives other than Drive C, an extra option appears in the
Settings dialog box. You can click to put a check in the box labeled Turn Off
System Restore on This Drive, which disables System Restore monitoring for
that drive only.
 System Restore points take up a lot of disk space!
 You can help free up the disk space used by Restore Points by using the
Disk Cleanup program. See Chapter 23.
 System Restore tries to keep Restore Points for at least 90 days, after
which they’re automatically removed.
 After a restore point has been removed, it cannot be recovered!

t is the height of good manners to know when it’s time to leave. Alas,
Windows has no manners, so it’s up to you to shut ’er down when you’re
done. But, even though you go through those proper procedures, something
in the box refuses to shut down. Good-bye already!
So, you sit and wait and wait and wait. “Shutting down Windows,” it says.
Yeah, right. And the check is in the mail, and the government is here to help
you, and so on. What’s to believe? With any luck, you can find the cure for
your PC’s shutdown constipation in the text that follows.
What to Do When Your Computer 
Doesn’t Shut Down
Give the computer about two or three minutes before you’re certain that it’s
stuck. Then, just turn the sucker off. I know — that’s “bad,” but what else can
you do?
Well, yeah: You can get the situation fixed. Windows is supposed to shut down
and, in many cases, turn off the computer all by itself. When it doesn’t work
that way, you need to fix things.

 If the power button doesn’t turn the computer off, press and hold that
button for about three seconds. That usually works.
 If the power button still doesn’t turn the computer off, unplug it. Or, if
your computer is connected to a UPS (uninterruptible power supply),
turn off the UPS.
“Why doesn’t it shut down?”
Windows refuses to shut down for the very same reason that some guests
refuse to leave a party: rude behavior. Inside the computer, usually some
stubborn program has been given the signal to shut down, but — like the
guest who doesn’t leave despite your walking around in your pajamas and
bathrobe — it refuses to leave.
Get a hint, will ya?
The solution is finding that stubborn program and either forcing it to quit
before you shut down or just not running the program in the first place. As
luck would have it, the list of programs that could possibly not get the hint to
quit is quite long.
 Some older versions of antivirus software were usually to blame for not
letting the computer shut down all the way. The programs would moni-
tor the shutdown to ensure that no viruses were installed, but then they
would “forget” to quit themselves.
 In fact, if you’re looking for anything to blame, older software is generally
your number-one suspect. Though Windows is supposed to shut down
all open programs before it quits, you probably should manually close
older programs before you give Windows the command to shut down.
Common things that stop up shutdown
Of course, it’s not always Windows fault. Any of the following situations can
also lead to shutdown constipation:
 Older, out-of-date, or conflicting device drivers may hang a computer on
shutdown.
 Software you have recently uninstalled, but that still has sad little pieces
of itself remaining around to gum up the works, may be the culprit.
 Any devices flagged as nonfunctioning by the Device Manager can also
be causing the problem. See the appendix in this book for information
on the Device Manager.
296
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

 A bad hard drive may be the problem.
 A virus or worm may be the problem.
 If your computer plays a sound file when it shuts down and the sound
file is corrupted or damaged, that could also cause the system to hang;
Windows just sits there and waits for the sound file to “fix itself.”
If the shutdown problem is new, consider what you have installed, removed,
or updated recently. Odds are that the new software, the removed software, or
changes in hardware may be causing the conflict that’s preventing the system
from shutting down.
Try this first! (System Restore)
The first thing to do: Try a System Restore. Odds are that restoring the
system to a point where it shuts down properly fixes the problem.
To fix a problem with a corrupt 
shutdown sound
If the problem happens because Windows is playing a sound at shutdown and
that sound is screwing things up, follow these steps to fix it:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Sounds and Audio Devices icon and click the Sounds tab.
3. Scroll through the list of events until you find the Exit Windows item.
If no sound is listed there — and no icon is by the Exit Windows event
name — you’re okay. Skip to Step 6.
4. Click the Play button.
This step tests the sound to see whether it’s working, though it’s no
guarantee that the sound isn’t the thing that’s hanging the computer
on shutdown.
5. Choose (None) from the drop-down list of sounds.
By choosing no sound, you effectively disable the sound playing at 
shutdown.
6. Click OK.
If the computer continues to hang when it’s shut down, you know that the
problem lies elsewhere. Continue reading in the next subsection.

Chapter 22: Shutdown Constipation

Restart Windows quickly
Sometimes, the problem may be with some program you’re running — one of
those memory leak situations discussed in Chapter 11. If you’re having that
type of trouble, follow these steps:
1. Start Windows as you normally would.
2. Wait for all the startup activity to settle down.
3. Shut down Windows.
If Windows shuts down normally without any hang-ups, you’re assured that
it’s probably some other program you’re running and not Windows itself to
blame. The job then becomes one of elimination to see which program is
hanging the system.
Of course, this technique doesn’t disable the many other startup programs
that are not a part of Windows. Keep reading for more information on those.
Try shutting down in Safe mode
One trick you can try is to start the computer in Safe mode. After you’re
there, try shutting down. If the computer shuts down successfully, you can
be sure that the problem is not with Windows and most likely not with your
computer hardware. No, the problem is either a device driver or a third-party
program that’s not shutting down properly.
See Chapter 24 more information on Safe mode.
Check logs and error messages
Refer to the Event Viewer to see whether any errors or troublesome events
have been logged just before shutdown. Also read the screen to see whether
any programs display an error message just before the problem occurred.
After checking the messages, simply try to disable the program or service
that is displaying the message. If you can kill the thing off, try shutting down.
When shutdown is successful, you have found the bad program or service.
 Windows is quite good about writing error messages to the event logs,
even right before it shuts down.
 Refer to Chapter 21 for information on the Event Viewer as well as
instructions on how to stop a process in Windows XP.
298
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

 Also see Chapter 24 for information on disabling programs by using the
System Configuration Utility.
 Defective programs should be reinstalled, or check with the developer
for information on updates or new versions.
Disabling Some Things to See 
Whether They’re at Fault
Three main areas cause woes in Windows:
 The graphics adapter
 The power-management hardware
 The networking hardware
Fixing any of these is easy; you just reinstall the software or update the soft-
ware driver with a newer version. You can obtain the newer version from the
manufacturer’s Web page at no cost. The problem, of course, is to properly
identify which of those suckers could be at fault.
Disabling the graphics adapter
To see whether the video driver is causing the problem, you need to disable
the video hardware in your computer. Obey these steps:
1. Open the System icon in the Control Panel.
2. Click the Hardware tab.
3. Click the Device Manager button.
This step opens the Device Manager window.
4. Open the item labeled Display Adapters.
You see a list of graphics adapters installed in your computer. These are
the hardware devices that control graphics.
5. Double-click to open your computer’s graphics adapter.
The graphics adapter’s Properties dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 22-1.
6. From the Device Usage drop-down list (at the bottom of the dialog box
in Figure 22-1), choose the option labeled Do Not Use This Device
(Disable).
299
Chapter 22: Shutdown Constipation

You may also want to just skip over this step and click the Troubleshoot
button to see whether the troubleshooter can find any problems. My
experience shows that disabling the video hardware works faster.
7. Click OK to close the Properties dialog box.
A warning dialog box appears and begs you to restart your computer now.
8. Click the Yes button to restart Windows.
You’re asked whether you want to restart Windows. You do.
9. Click the Yes button to restart Windows.
Or, if you’re not prompted, just restart Windows as you normally would.
Granted, it may not be restarting — which is the core of the problem
here. If so, just unplug the computer or do whatever is necessary to
restart the sucker.
When Windows comes back on the screen, it may or may not look any
different. Regardless, the video driver has been disabled, and now you
can seriously test to see whether it’s causing your problem.
10. After Windows comes back up, shut it down again.
You’re testing to see whether shutdown works with the video driver 
disabled.
If the system shuts down just fine, you need to update or upgrade your video
driver. Refer to Chapter 6, the section about updating your graphics device
driver, for more information.
Figure 22-1:
Disabling
the video
software.
300
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

If the system still refuses to shut down, the problem is not the video system.
You need to repeat the preceding steps, but in Step 6, click the Enable button
to restore your graphics hardware. (You may not need to restart Windows.)
Disabling power management
Turn off that power-management stuff and see whether that’s the cause of
your shutdown woe. Open the Control Panel’s Power Options icon. Set every-
thing to Never. Shut down Windows (as best you can). Then, restart and try
shutting down again. Often, the power-management feature may be stopping
you up.
 Also, access your PC’s Startup program and see about disabling power
management there.
 Another term for the PC’s power-management system is ACPI. That
stands for Advanced Configuration and Power Interface.
 Check with the Device Manager to see whether you have a problem
with power management. See the preceding section, Steps 1 through 4,
to display the Device Manager. The power-management hardware is
listed under System Devices.
Disabling the network
The final punk in the nasty trio of problem bullies is your computer’s network-
ing hardware. The main situation here is usually that the dang thing wasn’t
properly installed in the first place. It’s probably not sharing an IRQ or is
trampling on some other device’s DMA or something else technical-sounding.
The first way to check your networking hardware or software is to see
whether any diagnostic programs are available. Check the Programs menu
(off the Start thing panel) to see whether your PC dealer or manufacturer has
a menu item for the networking hardware. If so, check there for a diagnostic
tool or utility. That tells you right away whether there’s a problem — though
it probably doesn’t tell you how to fix it. (Generally, the hardware needs to be
reconfigured and reinstalled.)
The next thing to do is to run a networking troubleshooter. Open the Device
Manager as covered earlier in this chapter. Then, open the Network Adapters
item to see your network hardware listed. Double-clicking your network hard-
ware displays a Properties dialog box, similar to what’s shown in Figure 22-2.
301
Chapter 22: Shutdown Constipation

Click the Troubleshoot button to begin the troubleshooter.
Finally, you can try disabling the networking hardware. This action works just
like disabling the video hardware, as covered in the section, “Disabling the
graphics adapter,” earlier in this chapter. The difference is that you’re open-
ing the Network Adapters item in Step 4.
Be very careful when disabling and reenabling your networking hardware.
Setting up a computer for networking isn’t the easiest or most pleasurable
thing to do. If any of this causes pangs in your chest, definitely consider
paying someone else to do it!
The Annoying Shutdown/Instant Restart
Problem
A sadly common problem in Windows XP is its frustrating ability to restart
right in the middle of a shutdown. The good news is that such a thing can be
fixed. The bad news is that the shutdown/restart problem is a symptom and
not the cause. The true cause is hardware trouble, but first follow these steps
to fix the shutdown/restart problem:
1. Open the Control Panel’s System icon.
You can open this icon from the Control Panel’s window, and also by
right-clicking the My Computer icon on the desktop and choosing
Properties from the pop-up menu.
Figure 22-2:
The
networking
hardware’s
Properties
dialog box.
302
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

2. Click the Advanced tab in the System Properties dialog box.
3. In the Startup and Recovery area, click the Settings button.
Mind which button you click! Three buttons are on the Advanced tab, all
annoyingly named Settings. Clicking the proper one displays the Startup
and Recovery dialog box, as illustrated in Figure 22-3.
4. Remove the check mark by the item labeled Automatically Restart.
This step effectively removes the restarting symptom.
5. Click OK.
6. Close any other dialog boxes and windows that you opened.
The symptom has been addressed, but the problem has not been cured. The
next time you start Windows, immediately check the Event Viewer and review
the System messages to see what exactly is going wrong at shutdown. That
helps you nail down the problem, or at least arms you with enough informa-
tion for tech support.
 Refer to Chapter 21 for information on using the Event Viewer.
 Also refer to Chapter 8 for information on the boot menu. That helps you
to stop the restart problem when Windows first starts.

Chapter 22: Shutdown Constipation

Help Me, Microsoft!
Microsoft takes careful notes on all the problems that happen with Windows,
by keeping a large database, or Knowledge Base, of all the trouble and the
solutions offered. That’s good. Even better is that Microsoft makes all this
information available to anyone with Internet access. The Microsoft Knowledge
Base Web site can be accessed at
support.microsoft.com/
This Web site can be especially useful for diagnosing shutdown problems.
After all, you’re probably not the only person in the world who has had this
type of issue. (Nope, no one is picking on you!)
Use the Search text box on the main Knowledge Base Web page. Type the
word shutdown, plus any other words key to your problem. (If you cannot
think of any extra words, shutdown is fine by itself.) Click the Search button
and see what the Knowledge Base comes up with.
Controlling the Power Button’s Behavior
In the old days — and I’m talking pre-1990 here — computers all came with
an On-Off button or switch. That button did exactly what you would expect:
On was on. Off was off. Today, with all the emphasis on power management
and energy efficiency and la-di-da, the computer’s On-Off button has become
the power button.
On all computers, the power button most definitely turns the computer on.
Good.
On a small number of computer models, the power button definitely turns
the sucker off. But, on most other computers, the power button can have any
of a number of functions. That’s why it’s the power button and not the on-off
switch.
Forcing the power button 
to turn the computer off
Yeah, it may seem like the power button isn’t turning the computer off, but
that’s because you don’t know the secret:
Press and hold the power button for about eight seconds.
304
Part II: Troubleshooting Minor Irks and Quirks 

Even when the computer seems locked up beyond all hope, the hardware is
down in Hades playing rummy with a washing machine and 8-track tape deck,
and the software has taken your credit card number and set off dancing and
singing to the mall, the power button always turns the computer off if pressed
and held for eight seconds. Magic.
Changing the power button’s function
When the computer is behaving nicely, you can program the power button on
many PCs to obey your whim. The options that are available depend on your
computer’s power-management hardware. To see what’s available, as well as
to change the power button’s function, comply with these steps:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Power Options icon.
3. Click the Advanced tab.
If the function of your PC’s power button can be changed, you see a
Power Buttons area in the dialog box, as shown in Figure 22-4. If you
don’t see the area, your computer lacks this feature.
4. Choose a new function for the power button from the drop-down list.
Five options are available, as shown in Figure 22-4. These are described
in Table 22-1.
Figure 22-4:
Change the

305
Chapter 22: Shutdown Constipation

If you really want the power button to turn off the computer, choose
the Shut Down option. If you have a laptop and you want it to go into
Hibernation mode when you press the button, choose that option.
5. Click OK after making your choice.
Table 22-1
Power Button Options

Nothing; the power button is ignored.
Ask me what to do
The standard Turn Off Computer dialog box is displayed, 
just as though you chose the Turn Off Computer command 
from the Start button’s menu.
Stand by
The computer is put into Standby (Sleep) mode.
Hibernate
The computer is put into Hibernation mode.
Shut down
The computer begins the shutdown process, by closing 
programs and shutting down Windows. When that’s done, 
the computer turns itself off.
Even though you can change the function of the power button, you still need
to shut down Windows properly (or as best you can) whenever you’re done
working on the computer.
 Not all of the five power button options show up on every computer.
 If you set the power button to Do Nothing, the only way to turn off the
computer is to properly shut down Windows. If that doesn’t work, you
have to unplug the sucker.
 Selecting the Do Nothing option for the power button doesn’t affect the
8-second rule; no matter what option you choose for the power button’s
function, pressing and holding it for 8 seconds turns off the computer.
 Laptop computers have many more options available in the Power
Options Properties dialog box, including options for a sleep button
(if one is available) as well as options for what to do when the user
closes the laptop’s lid.

Part III
Preventive
Maintenance

In this part . . .
I
know only a few people who truly practice the art of
preventive maintenance. They’re the ones who read
their cars’ manuals and who stick to the oil- and filter-
changing schedules. They read the handbooks for their
new washer-dryers and actually perform the few recom-
mended maintenance checks. They clean the coils on their
refrigerators every three months. They wash out their
lawn mowers. Call them diligent. Call them anal-retentive.
But you can’t call them desperate because when it comes
to troubleshooting, they really don’t need any.
There is such value to preventive maintenance. It’s that
confidence you would expect from Dad in a 1950s sitcom:
“Oh, darn!,” says Dad, driving the family’s Buick on a 2-lane
highway in the middle of nowhere. “There goes that tire!
Fortunately, I just filled the spare with air, not to mention
that little Timmy and I spent all last week practicing how
to change a flat tire. We’ll be on the road again in minutes.
And I’ll bet no one will say the word fudge.” You too can
experience such self-assurance, as long as you practice a
few bits and pieces of preventive PC maintenance.

isk drives hold more importance for your computer because they contain
all your stuff — not only the operating system (important) and your
applications (more important), but also all the documents and data you
create and rely on every day (most important). So, although you can be a
whiz-bang at troubleshooting common hard drive burps and glitches, and
perhaps you can install a new hard drive in less than 30 seconds, what would
work best for you is an ounce of preventive disk drive maintenance. That
saves some agony and hair-pulling later.
Disk Maintenance Tools
Windows gives you two tools for maintaining your hard drive and helping its
performance: Check Disk, which is also known as ScanDisk, and Defrag.
 The Check Disk utility is used to scan a hard drive for errors, potential
problems, and damage. It then tries to fix the situation as best it can.
 The Defrag utility is used to optimize the hard drive’s performance.
A third disk maintenance tool is Backup. It’s covered in Chapter 25.

 Check Disk and Defrag aren’t the best tools available for maintaining
your hard drive. You can find better versions of these tools in third-party
utilities, such as Norton Utilities Disk Doctor and Disk Optimization tools.
 Another good alternative for the Defrag tool is Vopt (“vee-opt”), from
Golden Bow Systems:
www.goldenbow.com
 You must have an Administrator-type account to run the disk utilities
Defrag and Check Disk. Those utilities don’t run otherwise.
 Hard disk performance decreases as the amount of stuff on your hard
drive increases. You can’t do anything about this; it’s just a simple truth.
It takes longer to access and sift through more information than it does
for little information.
Accessing the disk tools
Windows keeps all its handy disk tools near to the bosom of your PC’s hard
drives. Here’s how to get at this common tool chest:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Right-click the icon for hard drive C.
Or, you can open any hard drive’s icon, such as Drive D, if you want to
use the tools on that hard drive instead.
Note that these tools are available for use only on a hard drive.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
4. Click the Tools tab.
You see a list of the three common disk maintenance tools, as shown in
Figure 23-1. The error-checking tool is Check Disk. The defragmenting
tool is Defrag. And then, you see a button for backup, if your version of
Windows has Backup installed.
The following subsections cover the tools found on the Tools tab in the disk
drive’s Properties dialog box.
 You can also find the Defrag and Backup commands on the Start menu:
Choose Programs (or All Programs) and then Accessories➪System
Tools, and then look for the program name, either Backup or Disk
Defragmenter.
 Some versions of Windows XP Home don’t come with a backup program.
310
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

 Some third-party utilities may install buttons or options on the Tools
tab. Figure 23-1 shows the standard Windows configuration, so if you see
anything extra, it’s specific to your computer and not a part of Windows
in general.
Is not the disk drive riddled with errors?
The Check Disk program is designed to check for and repair common errors
on a hard drive. It’s not really a performance-enhancing tool.
On most systems, Check Disk is run automatically, thanks to a maintenance
robot that Windows runs every few days (via the Task Scheduler). But, you
can always run Check Disk manually — and you should, especially if you don’t
leave your computer on all the time and the maintenance robot doesn’t have
time to run.
Follow these steps to run Check Disk:
1. Don’t do anything else.
This isn’t a rule — it’s just good advice: Check Disk works best when it has
your computer all to itself while it runs. Doing something else, especially
something involving disk activity, may cause Check Disk to stubbornly
restart, which wastes time.
Figure 23-1:
Where
Windows
hides the
disk tools.
311
Chapter 23: Maintaining Your Disk Drives

312
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 
2. Start Check Disk from the Tools tab in the disk drive’s Properties
dialog box; click the Check Now button.
Refer to the steps in the preceding section.
The Check Disk dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 23-2. Feel free to
check either option in the dialog box, which merely expands upon the
things Check Disk looks for (and adds time to the total operation).
If you don’t check the box labeled Automatically Fix File System Errors,
Check Disk stops and prompts you to fix the errors, if any are encountered.
Sometimes, choosing the option Automatically Fix File System Errors
requires that Windows be restarted.
3. Click the Start button to check your disk drive.
Check Disk does its thing. Watch the pretty green squares. Try not to
read anything into the display.
After the check is complete, a simple “I’m done” dialog box appears.
4. Click the OK button to close the dialog box.
You can also close any other dialog boxes or open windows.
What does it all mean? Who really knows? When nothing exciting happens,
consider your disk checked and everything okay. Feel free to move on.
When errors are found, you’re alerted via a warning dialog box. Heed the
instructions in the dialog box. Check Disk tries its best to fix things it can
fix. But, note that a hard drive with serious problems simply needs to be
replaced. Refer to Chapter 15 for more information.
Does Check Disk increase performance? No. It fixes errors. So, if the errors
are stopping up performance, Check Disk improves things. For the most part,
running Check Disk doesn’t make anything run faster.
Figure 23-2:
Starting
Check Disk.

313
Chapter 23: Maintaining Your Disk Drives
 You have to check each hard drive in your system individually. Keep
in mind that just checking Drive C, for example, doesn’t ensure that
Drive D has also been checked.
 Sometimes, ScanDisk runs automatically when the computer first starts
up, especially if the computer was suddenly, unexpectedly, or improp-
erly shut down. This is a good thing.
 The Norton Disk Doctor utility does some of the same things as Check
Disk, but in a more cautious and thorough manner. Disk Doctor is also
capable of recovering from some errors that seize Check Disk cold.
 Check Disk was the name of the old, original DOS disk-checking utility,
though in DOS it was called CHKDSK. (Well, actually, it’s still called
CHKDSK in Windows XP!)
Fragment me not
Defragmenting a hard drive isn’t only a necessary maintenance tool, it’s a
performance-boosting one. By eliminating most fragmented files and reshuf-
fling popular files to the beginning of the disk (like the head of the line), you
see a modest performance improvement.
File fragments aren’t bad things. Windows tries to make the best use of the hard
drive, so what it does is to split some files into smaller pieces — fragments —
so that disk space is used more efficiently. But, all those little pieces require
overhead to keep track of and to reassemble when the file is accessed. After
a while, disk space may still be used efficiently, but disk performance drops
like the GPA of two teenagers in love. To fix the problem, you need to run a
tool like Defrag every so often.
To run Defrag, abide by these steps:
1. Open the My Computer icon on the desktop.
2. Right-click the icon for hard drive C.
It doesn’t really matter which hard drive you right-click for Defrag; you
choose which drive to defragment in a later step.
3. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
4. Click the Tools tab.
5. Click the Defragment Now button.
The Disk Defragmenter window appears, as shown in Figure 23-3. A list
of available hard drives, or disk drives, that can be defragmented (no
CDs or DVDs) appears in the top part of the window. The middle of the
window contains an entertaining display while Defrag runs.

6. Choose a drive to defragment.
You can clean up only one drive at a time. In Figure 23-3, Drive C is
chosen.
7. Click the Analyze button.
Defragmenting can be done on any disk drive at any time, but for the
best payoff, the percentage of fragmented files needs to be quite large.
How large? I don’t know. But Windows does, and it tells you in a dialog
box displayed on the screen.
8. Obey the dialog box.
For example, if the computer believes that defragmenting is a good thing
at this time, click the Defragment button. Otherwise, click the Close
button and skip down to Step 11.
You can optionally choose the View Report button here. In the Analysis
Report window, scroll down to the Volume Fragmentation area to review
how fragmented the drive is.
9. Sit back and watch defragmenting in action!
It takes a while for the computer to clean up the hard drive. The graphical
display keeps you occupied, though I usually get up and do some yard
work while the operation takes place.
Defragmenting can take anywhere from several minutes on up to a few
hours to complete. How much time it takes depends on how fragmented
the hard drive is, which is related to how long it has been since you last
defragmented the drive. That could be ages.
Figure 23-3:
Thrill-a-
minute disk

ing goes

314
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

Feel free to click the Stop button if the insanity of waiting too long over-
comes you. Also click Stop if you notice that Defrag keeps trying to start
over again. (Read more about that in the following bulleted list.)
10. Click the Close button when you see the dialog box telling you that
defragmentation is complete.
11. Close the Disk Defragmenter window when you’re done.
Or, you can choose another drive to defragment, starting over again with
Step 6.
Because Defrag dramatically improves performance, I recommend running
it at least once a week, or as often as the program indicates that defragment-
ing is necessary. The more often you run it, the less time it takes Defrag to
do its job.
 Defrag needs at least 15 percent free disk space to work properly. If you
have less than that amount of disk space free, Defrag doesn’t run. See
the following section for more information.
 The key to testing a Defrag utility is to run a second one after the first
one. For example, running Golden Bow’s Vopt after running Windows XP
Defrag results in even more optimization. That’s because Vopt is a better
disk defragmenter than Defrag; it takes less time to do a better job:
www.goldenbow.com
 Defragmenting takes time! Be sure to set aside several minutes to a few
hours for your hard drive to fully defragment.
 If Defrag poops out on you, just get Norton Utilities and use its Disk
Optimizer or get Golden Bow’s Vopt and use it instead.
 Defrag runs best when it’s the only program running. Other programs
may interfere with Defrag, by slowing it down or sometimes causing it
to start over.
 Refer to the later section “Scheduling Automatic Maintenance” for infor-
mation on automating the defragment process.
Increasing Disk Storage
Another potential problem with a hard drive is that disk space suddenly runs
dry! At first, this situation is suspect with me because today’s hard drives hold
lots of information and it would take a busy person to fill things up quickly.
But, with popular graphics files, videos, and especially online music, you can
see the free space on an 80GB hard drive dwindle like you would watch ice
melt in the sun.
315
Chapter 23: Maintaining Your Disk Drives

Checking disk space
To quickly peek at your hard drive’s disk usage situation in both numerical
and graphical terms, use the disk drive’s Properties dialog box, as shown in
Figure 23-4.
To see this dialog box, open the My Computer icon on the desktop. In the My
Computer window, right-click your hard drive’s icon and choose Properties
from the pop-up menu.
The remainder of this section references this dialog box, so remember how
you opened it.
Some space-saving suggestions
If you’re collecting more than one type of a specific file — such as graphics,
video, or music files — consider putting all that stuff on CD-R discs. Archiving
is the name of the game! Just wait until you have a collection of enough files
(more than 500MB, for example), and then burn ’em all on a CD-R.
If you absolutely must have all that stuff on a hard drive, however, consider
getting a second hard drive for your computer. It’s relatively cheap and easy
to install — especially an external model. A second hard drive is a valuable
addition, specifically when space is scarce.
Figure 23-4:

316
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

Finally, do not use disk compression on your hard drive to get more space.
In the hard drive’s Properties dialog box (refer to Figure 23-4), note the item
labeled Compress Drive to Save Disk Space. Avoid it! Do not put a check mark
there! Compressed files on hard drives are something I never want to trouble-
shoot. Please use one of the preceding suggestions or any of the other disk
cleaning advice in this chapter before you even think about disk compression.
 After you burn your stuff to a CD-R, you can freely delete it from the hard
drive and save yourself oodles of space.
 The most common disk compression troubleshooting question I get is
“How can I uncompress 65GB of data from my 50GB drive?” My answer
is “Only by getting a second, larger hard drive” — which, incidentally, is
one of my earlier suggestions. That would have saved some time.
Disk Cleanup
Your greatest weapon in the hard drive space battle is the Disk Cleanup tool.
It puts several handy features in one place, which allows you to instantly
reclaim lots of hard drive space in one easy step. Here you go:
1. Click the Start button thing.
2. Choose All Programs.
3. Choose Accessories➪System Tools➪Disk Cleanup.
Windows modestly asks which drive you want to clean. This drive
should be C, the busy drive. (Clean other drives on your own.)
4. Click OK to select Drive C.
A brief analysis is made. Sit and hum.
Eventually, results are posted in a dialog box, as shown in Figure 23-5.
Note the items you can select plus how much disk space is freed by
selecting them. In the figure, you see that half a megabyte of crap is sit-
ting in the Recycle Bin. Wow!
5. Click to check off those items you want to delete, and thereby clean
up disk space.
Scroll down the list and note the Compress Old Files option — a great way
to save space. (File compression isn’t the same as disk compression.)
6. When you’re ready to free disk space, click the OK button.
Are you serious?
317
Chapter 23: Maintaining Your Disk Drives

7. Click Yes when you’re asked whether you’re sure.
You’re sure. By clicking the Yes button, you put Disk Cleanup to work for
you, to eliminate rogue and unwanted things from your hard drive and
generously give that valuable storage space back to you.
8. Click the Yes button, if prompted, to restart Windows.
The program ends with no fanfare; it just quits. But, your hard drive is much
slimmer! (My Windows 98 system crashed when I last ran Disk Cleanup. Yes,
it happens to everyone.)
If you click the More Options tab, just before Step 6, you can see three short-
cuts to other places in Windows where you can delete stuff to clean up disk
space. Here are the options listed:
Windows components: Clicking the Clean Up button here gives you
access to the Windows components part of the Add/Remove Programs
dialog box. There, you can pluck through the many applications, or
applets, that Windows uses, to remove those that you don’t want to free
up space.
Installed Programs: Clicking the Clean Up button here takes you to the
Add/Remove Programs window. There, you can remove programs you 
no longer use. Note that you can click to select a program listed in the
Add/Remove Programs window and Windows tells you how often you
use that program. Removing unused or rarely used programs can save
on disk space.
System Restore: Clicking the Clean Up button in this case displays a 
Yes-No dialog box that prompts you to remove older Restore Points.
Figure 23-5:
A few of 
the many

Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

It’s a good idea to uninstall things you don’t need, especially if disk space is
tight. Otherwise, don’t worry about it. Also, I recommend against removing
older restore points. Instead, refer to Chapter 21 for information on adjusting
the amount of disk space used by System Restore.
 The Disk Cleanup button in the disk drive’s Properties dialog box (refer
to Figure 23-4), can be clicked to run the Disk Cleanup program on that
particular drive.
 No, you can’t run Disk Cleanup on a CD or DVD disc; the files on those
discs are read-only, and you cannot delete them.
 The Windows components and Installed Programs options (on the More
Options tab) can also be accessed from the Add/Remove Programs
dialog box. You open that dialog box by using the Control Panel.
 Note that selecting certain options from the scrolling list causes an addi-
tional button to be displayed in the dialog box. For example, clicking the
Compress Old Files option brings up an Options button. Clicking that
button displays more options or allows you to refine your choices, if
you’re a refined type of person.
 Use the View Files button to review what’s being deleted before you click
the OK button. This button appears only when certain file categories are
chosen from the scrolling list.
 The Downloaded Programs option refers to internal upgrades (add-ons
or plug-ins) for Internet Explorer. The option doesn’t refer to any share-
ware or other utility you have downloaded.
Other things to try
Please, O, please, don’t sit and stew over your disk space usage. The disk is
there for you to use, and Windows works fine with either a full or empty hard
drive. In fact, if space gets too low, Windows lets you know. If you’re like most
people, your computer will most likely die before you get a chance to fill up
its hard drive.
Even so, and even with Disk Cleanup and all that, you can try a few more
things to keep disk space usage low:
Decrease the size of the Internet cache. Set the Internet cache, or temporary
file, allocation to a small size:
1. Open the Internet Options icon in the Control Panel.
2. On the General tab, click the Settings button.
The Settings dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 23-6.
319
Chapter 23: Maintaining Your Disk Drives

3. Set the cache size by adjusting the slider labeled Amount of Disk
Space to Use.
4. Click OK and then close the Internet Properties dialog box.
Decrease the space used by the Recycle Bin. Here’s how you can change the
disk space allocation for your deleted files:
1. Right-click the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop.
2. Choose Properties from the shortcut menu.
The Recycle Bin Properties dialog box is displayed, as shown in
Figure 23-7. The Global tab sets the usage for all drives. Other tabs set
drive usage individually, but only if you choose the Configure Drives
Independently option.
3. Adjust the slider to the left.
Sliding the gizmo to the left means that less disk space is used by the
Recycle Bin. You can then use more disk space for your own junk.
Or — if you want to risk it — you can click to select the option labeled
Do Not Move Files to the Recycle Bin, Remove Files Immediately When
Deleted. Choosing that option means that there’s no chance of file recov-
ery, but you do get more disk space that way. (No, I don’t recommend it.)
4. Click OK after making your adjustments.
Remove the Online Services folder. Many new computers come with a folder
named Online Services. It may be on the desktop directly, or it may be a
folder in the Program Files folder. Wherever — it’s something you can freely
delete.
Figure 23-6:
Adjust 
the Inter-
net cache 
size here.
320
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

The Online Services folder contains program stubs that let you sign on to 
various online services, such as AOL, CompuServe, and whatever else is out
there. If you don’t plan on using those services, zap that folder.
If you get a warning about deleting program files, it’s okay. Those programs
install only larger programs that you don’t plan on using anyway. Yes, you
have my permission to delete them — despite my constant admonition never
to delete any file you didn’t create yourself.
Scheduling Automatic Maintenance
You can use the Task Scheduler in Windows to arrange for ScanDisk and
Defrag to be run automatically, according to your own schedule. In fact, you
can arrange to have Backup and even other disk utilities running on a regular
basis. This section explains everything.
 You can use the Windows Task Scheduler to have specific programs run
at certain times or on a regular schedule.
 Yes, the computer needs to be on for the programs to run. You cannot
schedule the computer to turn itself on, at least not by using the Task
Scheduler.

Recycle
Bin’s

321
Chapter 23: Maintaining Your Disk Drives

322
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 
 Using the Task Scheduler is considered an advanced thing.
 Go for it!
The Scheduled Tasks window
You cannot schedule tasks for Windows unless you can dig up the Scheduled
Tasks window. Grab a mouse and start digging:
1. Open the Control Panel.
2. Open the Scheduled Tasks icon.
And there you have the Scheduled Tasks window, as illustrated in
Figure 23-8. The tasks appear as icons. New tasks are added by using
the Add Scheduled Task icon, which runs a wizard (covered in the next
subsection).
3. Close the Scheduled Tasks window when you’re done a-gawkin’.
Using the Scheduled Tasks window is covered in the following subsections.
Adding a task
To create a new scheduled task, you need to know the name of the program
you want to run and then use the Scheduled Task Wizard to set things up for
you. That’s easy. But, for computer maintenance, there’s no option for speci-
fying the two key disk programs Defrag and Check Disk. That’s hard, but I help
you out in the following steps.
Figure 23-8:
The
Scheduled
Tasks
window.

323
Chapter 23: Maintaining Your Disk Drives
To add a new task to the Task Scheduler, heed these steps:
1. Open the Scheduled Tasks window.
Refer to the preceding subsection for the details.
2. Open the Add Scheduled Task icon.
This step runs the Scheduled Task Wizard, which helps set up the task.
3. Click the Next button.
4. Locate the program you want to schedule by selecting it from the
Application list, and then click the Next button.
You find Disk Cleanup in there, as well as Backup and any other software
you have installed. You don’t find Defrag or Check Disk. To find them,
as well as other programs not on the list, complete this sneaky set of
substeps:
a. Click the Browse button.
b. Use the Select Program to Schedule dialog box to find the program.
This dialog box works like any Open or Browse dialog box. Use its
controls to locate the program you want. For example:
c. Open Drive C (if necessary).
d. Open the Windows folder.
e. Open the System32 folder.
f. Click to select the program named DEFRAG.EXE.
Or, to run Check Disk, select the program named CHKDSK.EXE.
g. Click the Open button.
5. Optionally, rename the task.
The wizard names the task after the program, though you’re free to
change it.
6. Select how often you want to perform the task.
Choose Daily, Weekly, or any of the other options, as shown in Figure 23-9.
Don’t worry about specific times of day, the day of the week, or so on.
That comes next.
7. Click the Next button.
8. Set specific items for the schedule.
For example, if you chose to schedule your task daily, you now set the
time of day and so on. For scheduling the task weekly, you choose
the time of day, days of the week, and so on. The times selected depend
on what you selected in Step 6.

9. Click the Next button.
10. Enter your user name and password (twice).
This step is required because every program must be “owned” by a user
on the system. When the program runs, it’s as though you were running
it yourself. This is a security feature.
11. Click the Finish button.
You’re done.
The task now appears as an icon in the Scheduled Tasks window, and it’s all
set to run on schedule.
Test-running a task
Immediately after creating a new task, you should test the task. That way, you
can ensure that everything was created properly and that further fine-tuning
isn’t necessary.
To test-run a task, right-click the task’s icon in the Scheduled Tasks window.
Choose Run from the pop-up menu. This command runs the task as though
its scheduled time has come around. Sit back and watch and ensure that
everything goes as planned. If not, you may need to tune the task.
When things go normally, the task should end and that’s that. Otherwise,
you may need to adjust things. To do so, right-click the task in question and
choose Properties from the pop-up menu. Review the settings in the dialog
box and ensure that everything is as you like it.
Figure 23-9:
Scheduling
options for
the task.
324
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

Checking on your task’s progress
Tasks should run as scheduled. But, how would you know? Obviously, you
don’t want to set your alarm clock for 4:30 a.m. on Saturday and try to ensure
that Check Disk is running. That’s insane! Especially after that party Friday
night. You and that lampshade, I tell ya. . . .
There’s a simple way to confirm that tasks are running, as well as to check on
how the tasks work. In the Scheduled Tasks window, choose Advanced➪View
Log. This command displays a text file, kept on disk, that lists all Scheduled
Task activity.
The newest items are found at the bottom of the list. Scroll down to check on
your task’s status. Figure 23-10 shows the log, as it appears in the Notepad
program. There, you can see that the Check Disk program, CHKDSK.JOB, was
started and finished — hopefully, on schedule.
Any problems appear on the list, so be sure to review it every so often to
ensure that things are running just fine.
You can also choose Advanced➪Notify Me of Missed Tasks to have the Task
Manager alert you to any tasks that, for whatever reason, have not run.
(Usually, they don’t run because the computer was turned off.)
Removing a task
This job is cinchy: To remove a task, and stop it from running ever again, delete
its icon from the Scheduled Tasks window. Do this like you would delete any-
thing: Click to select the icon and press the Delete key on your keyboard.
Thwoop! It’s gone.
Figure 23-10:
The task 
list log.
325
Chapter 23: Maintaining Your Disk Drives

Better than deleting a task, just consider disabling the task instead:
1. Right-click the task’s icon in the Scheduled Tasks window.
2. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
The task’s dialog box appears.
3. Click the Task tab, if necessary.
4. Remove the check mark by the item labeled Enabled (Scheduled Task
Runs at Specific Time).
5. Click the OK button.
When a task has been disabled, the tiny clock image on its icon changes to
a white X in a red circle. That shows you that the task exists, but it doesn’t
ever run.
You can reenable the task by repeating the preceding steps and putting the
check mark back in Step 4.

unning a computer is easy. Running a computer successfully requires
effort. That has always been true, and the more complex and capable a
computer is, the more difficult it is to manage the whole thing. Microsoft has
done a good job of making Windows as effortless to use as possible. But,
that’s no excuse for ignoring things or letting problems persist until even
good ol’ forgiving Windows tosses in its hand and goes kaput.
Windows comes with a whole clutch of utilities, tools, programs, and tech-
niques you can employ to help keep your computer happy. Many of these are
discussed or demonstrated elsewhere in this book. This chapter is merely a
locus where the rest of those utilities are explained and detailed.
Also included here are some third-party utilities, ones that I highly recommend
to help you fight the endless battle with the bad guys on the Internet.
Weapons within Windows
Windows comes with so many useful and interesting utilities that I could write
an entire book on each of them. The following sections detail a few of the
more common utilities, with an emphasis on using them for troubleshooting
your PC.

The System Configuration Utility
(MSCONFIG)
The System Configuration Utility, as shown in Figure 24-1, is your main
weapon in fighting the PC’s startup battle. This handy dialog box provides a
platform from which you can view just about anything that goes on when
Windows first starts up.
To start the utility, type MSCONFIG in the Run dialog box. (You can summon
the Run dialog box by pressing Win+R or choosing Run from the main Start
menu.)
The General tab contains three options for starting Windows:
 Normal Startup: This option runs the normal Windows startup.
 Diagnostic Startup: Run the computer in Safe mode.
 Selective Startup: Choose various options to enable or disable during
startup (used mostly by tech support).
The SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI tabs list settings made by older Windows 
programs (though most of those programs no longer run in Windows XP).
The tabs remain for compatibility reasons.
The BOOT.INI tab contains startup information specific to Windows XP,
including some diagnostic options.
The Services tab contains a list of services that Windows normally starts,
which you can temporarily disable for diagnostic purposes.
Figure 24-1:
The 
System
Configura-
tion Utility.
328
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

Finally, the Startup tab contains programs that Windows automatically 
starts — programs you don’t find by choosing Programs➪Startup Menu.
The System Configuration utility provides that central location from which
you can disable just about anything that happens when Windows starts. Keep
in mind that this utility is for troubleshooting only! By turning certain things
off, you can determine that the thing is causing trouble. Then, you have to fix
the problem or permanently disable the thing elsewhere.
 Refer to Chapter 8 to troubleshoot Startup programs.
 Chapter 21 discusses permanently disabling services. Refer to the section
“Processes and Services Here, There, and Everywhere.”
The Device Manager
The Device Manager is the place where Windows lists all your computer’s hard-
ware, gives you access to the software that controls all that hardware, and
tells you whether that hardware is functioning. Obviously, this is a handy and
useful window to know.
Here’s how to display the Device Manager:
1. Open the Control Panel’s System icon.
2. Click the Hardware tab.
3. Click the Device Manager button.
The Device Manager lists hardware by category, as shown in Figure 24-2. To
see specifics, you must open a category. To see your PC’s specific disk drive
information, click the plus sign [+] to the left of the Disk Drives item.
To find information on a specific piece of hardware, you must double-click to
open that hardware item. Doing so displays the item’s Properties dialog box,
where you can make adjustments to the hardware or just check to see whether
it needs attention.
You can use the Driver tab in the Properties dialog box to install or update a
new driver (software) for the device. You do that by clicking the Update Driver
button (though it’s assumed that you already have the driver downloaded or
available on a CD or floppy disk).
You can also disable a device, which prevents Windows from loading software
or recognizing the device the next time Windows starts up. That way, you can
troubleshoot the device or its driver software; if the computer works better
without the device enabled, you have a problem with the device.
329
Chapter 24: Useful Tools and Weapons

When a device isn’t working, it’s flagged in the Device Manager. That category
with the bad hardware is open and the hardware flagged by a yellow circle
icon. In the middle of the yellow circle is an exclamation point. That’s your
key to instantly find bad hardware. To get further information, double-click to
open that item. In its Properties dialog box, you see a detailed description of
what’s going wrong.
 The Device Manager does not list printers. For those, you must open the
Printers window. That’s where new printers are installed, drivers updated,
and problems dealt with. Refer to Chapter 14 for the details.
 The Device Manager doesn’t list all hardware problems. Some hardware
trouble cannot be detected by Windows, so just because the hardware
isn’t flagged as bad, don’t assume that it’s working properly.
 Similar information about devices also appears in the various Control
Panel items. For example, the Display Properties dialog box also has a
link to information about your PC’s video hardware, the same as the
information found in the Device Manager.
 The supersecret, budding-guru, command-line way to summon the
Device Manager is to type DEVMGMT.MSC into the Run command’s
dialog box.
System Information
The System Information tool is a handy thing to have — plus, it’s a great
launching spot for running many other tools or utilities in Windows.
Figure 24-2:
The Device
Manager.
330
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

Start the System Information program by clicking the Start button and choos-
ing All Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪System Information.
The System Information tool’s main job is to report about your computer, as
shown in Figure 24-3. This dialog box provides a central location for listing all
sorts of information about your computer’s hardware, software, environment,
and the various applications you run.
For example, to see whether your computer has any hardware conflicts, open
the Hardware Resources item (click the [+] to its left) and then select Conflicts/
Sharing. The System Information tool then lists any shared or conflicting
devices in your computer.
Another bonus to this tool is its incredible Tools menu. Plenty of other handy
Windows tools are listed on that menu, including some or all of the following:
 DirectX Diagnostic Tool: A massive (and relatively unknown) utility for
analyzing various gaming components of your PC, as controlled by the
DirectX standard.
 Disk Cleanup: Discussed in Chapter 23.
 Dr. Watson: Covered later in this chapter.
 File Signature Verification Utility: Confirms that signed files are valid.
A signed file contains a digital signature, designed to ensure that the
file is sent by a responsible source and performs the advertised duty
(that the file isn’t a virus or worm or Trojan horse, for example).
 Hardware Wizard: Runs the Add New Hardware Wizard.
 Net Diagnostics: Runs a troubleshooter or diagnostic tool (as part of the
Help system).
Figure 24-3:

System
Informa-
tion tool.

Chapter 24: Useful Tools and Weapons

 Network Connections: Opens the Network Connections window.
 Registry Checker: Similar to ScanDisk, but used for the Registry.
 ScanDisk: Checks your disk drives for errors (refer to Chapter 23).
 System Configuration Utility: Covered elsewhere in this chapter.
 System File Checker: Covered elsewhere in this chapter.
 System Restore: Discussed in detail in Chapter 4.
The System File Checker
The System File Checker is perhaps the most powerful tool in Windows, one
that is, sadly, neglected by too many people. In fact, if more of those tech-
support wieners knew about it, they would rarely recommend reinstalling
Windows. Ever!
SFC stands for System File Checker. What it does is to verify the condition of
the core files that make up the Windows operating system. When any file is
missing or corrupted, it’s replaced with a fresh new copy. So, in a way, running
SFC is like reinstalling Windows, but only when necessary and without having
to delete anything.
The SFC utility is a command-line program, though it also uses graphical 
windows. Even so, to run SFC, you must start up a command-prompt window.
Follow these steps:
1. Get a copy of the original Windows XP CD.
You must have a copy of the CD to run SFC. This is the original CD you
used to install Windows.
If you don’t have the Windows CD, don’t run SFC! The program relies
upon the original CD for replacing files. No CD, no SFC.
2. From the Start menu, choose All Programs➪Accessories➪Command
Prompt.
This step opens a Command Prompt, or DOS, window on the screen.
Commands must be typed — and spelled properly. If you make a mistake,
use the Backspace key to back up and erase.
You can type in upper- or lowercase. This book uses UPPERCASE for the
examples.
The Enter key is pressed after typing a command to send that command
off to Windows.
332
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

3. Type SFC /SCANNOW and press the Enter key.
That’s SFC, a space, a slash, and then SCANNOW with no space between
SCAN and NOW. The line doesn’t end in a period. Press the Enter key
after confirming that you have typed it all correctly.
Follow the instructions on the screen.
This operation can take quite a while!
4. If any files need replacing, SFC asks for the Windows CD to be
inserted. It does this so that it can read a replacement file from
that disc.
Inserting the CD may start the Upgrade or Install program. Just close
that window and continue.
SFC may pull some false alarms and not recognize the CD after it’s
inserted. If so, click the Retry button. (This may happen several times.)
5. When SFC is finished, you see another command prompt that is wait-
ing for you to type another command.
SFC is done. You can close the command-prompt window.
6. Type EXIT and press the Enter key.
The EXIT command closes the command-prompt window.
I recommend running SFC only when you suspect system trouble that even
System Restore seems unable to fix. In that case, SFC may be able to pull
needed files from the Windows CD and put the system back into order.
I don’t recommend running SFC as regular system maintenance! Consider it a
disaster-recovery tool only.
Automatic Updates
Every so often, Microsoft releases updates for Windows, also called patches.
These are introduced to address specific issues, mostly security-related prob-
lems or exploited weaknesses in Windows or programs like Internet Explorer.
This isn’t unusual: Every major operating system developer releases patches
and updates — though some not as frequently as Microsoft!
Once upon a time, automatically updating Windows with the various updates
or patches was a risky thing. But, it’s my opinion that Microsoft has recently
gotten better at playing the patching game. Therefore, I think that it’s a good
idea to turn the Automatic Updates feature on. Here’s how to check on that:
333
Chapter 24: Useful Tools and Weapons

1. Open the Control Panel’s System icon.
You can also display this icon by right-clicking the My Computer icon on
the desktop and then choosing the Properties command from the short-
cut menu.
2. Click the Automatic Updates tab.
The dialog box looks like the one shown in Figure 24-4. This is where you
can tell Windows how often or whether to automatically update your
computer.
3. Set Automatic Updates for your needs.
If you have updated or have Windows XP SP2, I highly recommend that
you set Automatic Updates to Automatic, as shown in Figure 24-4.
Otherwise, choose whichever options best suit you.
4. Click OK when you’re done.
Obviously, Automatic Updates requires an Internet connection. If you have
broadband, the update checking goes on automatically. Otherwise, it works
in the background, by sneakily downloading information whenever you’re
connected to the Internet.
 You can also display the Automatic Updates dialog box by opening the
Automatic Updates icon in the Control Panel.
 If you’re using an older version of Windows, I advise you not to update. If
the system is running smoothly — plus, if you have a firewall and antivirus
software installed, you’re probably okay and don’t need any updates
that may imbalance your computer system.
Figure 24-4:
Automati-
cally update
Windows.
334
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

 If your computer is running in a mission-critical situation, don’t update 
it — especially if it’s not connected to the Internet.
 In fact, most security warnings are related to the Internet. If your com-
puter isn’t on the information superhighway, most of the security
releases don’t apply to you. Choose the option labeled Turn Off
Automatic Updates.
Dr. Watson
I am not a Dr. Watson fan — ever since he first showed up in Windows Version 3
for DOS, back in 1993. At first, he sounded like some miraculous Peter Norton-
like tool for finding out what’s wrong with Windows. (Yes, it had trouble even
back then.) But, no, Dr. Watson is merely a disaster-reporting tool — a CNN
for your computer that neither makes the news nor resolves any issues.
To start Dr. Watson, type DRWTSN32 into the Run dialog box. This action 
displays the complex-looking Dr. Watson interface, as shown in Figure 24-5.
Looks powerful, right? But keep in mind that Dr. Watson only reports on the
situation; he doesn’t fix anything.
Overall, I assume that the Dr. Watson tool has some value, though I person-
ally don’t find it good for much.

Welcome to Safe Mode
The only question I have is “Why does Windows need a ‘safe’ mode?” Shouldn’t
it be safe to use Windows all the time? And, if it’s called Safe mode, does that
make the normal mode of operation Dangerous mode?”
Once again showing a knack for improperly naming things, Microsoft gives
Windows users Safe mode. (It’s an industry-wide, not just Microsoft, problem
with naming things.) Safe mode really should be called Diagnostic mode or
even Slim mode because in Safe mode you can run Windows with no extra
drivers or options, which are often the cause of any trouble you may be 
experiencing.
Starting in Safe mode
You have many ways to get into Safe mode in Windows.
The first way happens under Windows own decree: The computer just starts
up in Safe mode. You can tell by the low resolution plus the words Safe mode
in all four corners of the screen, as shown in Figure 24-6. When that happens,
Windows is telling you that something is wrong. Indeed, it may even announce
why it’s going into Safe mode before you even see Safe mode.
Figure 24-6:
Safe mode.
336
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

The second way you can enter Safe mode is manually, when the computer
starts. Immediately after the “Starting Windows” text message appears, you
can press the F8 key to see a startup menu. (I cover this subject in Chapter 8.)
You can select one of the Safe mode options from that menu to start your
computer in Safe mode.
Finally, you can direct the computer to start in Safe mode from the System
Configuration Utility. On the General tab, if you select the Diagnostic startup,
Windows starts in Safe mode the next time around. (Conversely, if you would
rather have Windows not start in Safe mode, select Normal from the list in
the System Configuration Utility.)
 Accept and realize that you use Safe mode to fix things. That’s it. You
don’t work on projects there. You don’t gather and reply to e-mail.
You fix something and then start the computer in Normal mode.
 Starting Safe mode may be one of the few times you see the Adminis-
trator’s account appear as a login option for Windows. Log in as the
Administrator only if you’re directed to do so in order to fix some 
problem.
Fixing things in Safe mode
The idea behind Safe mode is that, with various options and features disabled,
it’s easier for you to work at fixing them. You can change certain settings that
the computer doesn’t allow you to change when you’re in Normal mode.
For example, I recommend using Safe mode if someone has changed the set-
tings on the Appearance tab in the Display Properties dialog box. Suppose
that someone has changed the text to be very small or changed the graphics
to be very big or use black-on-black text. You can fix all this in Safe mode and
restore your settings.
If the computer just spontaneously goes into Safe mode, check the Device
Manager. If your computer has a problem, the device appears flagged with a
yellow circle and an exclamation point. Open that device by double-clicking
it and then read what the problem is. Follow those instructions to fix the
problem.
Generally speaking, disabling a device in the Device Manager or reinstalling
an older device driver is the solution that puts the computer back to normal.
Note that you change just about any Windows settings in Safe mode. Those
changes may not appear immediately, as they would when Windows is run
337
Chapter 24: Useful Tools and Weapons

338
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 
normally. The changes are made nonetheless; you see their effects when you
restart the computer and return to Normal mode.
 Yes, many things don’t work in Safe mode. Those things, such as network-
ing, are disabled to provide a better environment for troubleshooting.
 Refer to Chapter 4 for more information on running System Restore to fix
problems in Windows XP.
 The changes you make may not have any visual effect in Safe mode, but
they have an effect when you return to Normal mode.
You’re done with Safe mode
When you have finished making Safe mode corrections, simply restart your
PC. Do this part properly! Even Safe mode must be restarted the way Windows
normally is.
When your computer comes back to life, the problem should be fixed. Then,
you can get on with your duties.
If the computer continues to boot into Safe mode, check the Device Manager.
Read any startup messages that appear. Open the System Configuration
The Windows XP Recovery Console
There’s a special tool you can use specifically
for troubleshooting massive Windows prob-
lems. This tool belongs only to the Windows XP
operating system, so it’s called the Windows XP
Recovery Console. It’s nothing fancier than a
beefy version of the command prompt (like
DOS), but with a whole boatload of utilities for
fixing problems in Windows.
To install the Recovery Console, you need the
original Windows CD. (It cannot be installed
without the CD.) Insert the CD into your CD-ROM
drive. Open the Run dialog box and type the fol-
lowing command, where D is the drive letter of
the CD-ROM drive containing the Windows CD:
D:/I386/WINNT32.EXE /CMDCONS
Follow the instructions on the screen to com-
plete installation.
After installing, the Recovery Console appears
as an option when you start your computer. One
option is to run Windows XP; the other, to run
the Recovery Console. (You may see other oper-
ating systems as well, depending on how your
computer is configured to start.)
When you run your computer with the Recovery
Console, you can use its command-line tools to
fix certain problems in Windows or to diagnose
certain situations that would be difficult to
observe when Windows runs normally. The list
of available commands is extensive; use only
those that you’re recommended to use by your
dealer, tech support, or computer guru.
To close the Recovery Console and restart your
computer, type the EXIT command at the prompt
and press the Enter key.

to the Normal Startup option to see whether that helps.
As a next-to-last resort, connect to the Internet and visit the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (refer to Chapter 5) to see whether you can find a solution

Internet Tools
Hooking your computer up to the Internet opens the entire online universe
for your perusal, information, and play. That’s good. What’s bad is that being
on the Internet opens up your personal computer for lots of nasty things to
creep in and “play.” Yes, that’s something you want to avoid.
Windows has a handful of tools and techniques to help keep you safe from
the nasty things on the Internet. But, most of the tools you really need must
come from somewhere else.
I have split up the necessary tools you need into five categories:
 Antivirus
 Anti-spam
 Anti-spyware
 Anti-hijacking
 Firewall protection
Each of these categories is covered in the five following subsections, along
with my recommendations on how best to protect your PC.
Antivirus
Viruses are nasty programs that come into your computer to do evil things.
They may, for example, program your computer to relay spam or unwanted
e-mail. The virus may program your computer to attack other computers. Or,
it may simply propagate itself, by sending more viruses out to everyone in
your e-mail address book. Viruses are nasty!
To protect yourself against viruses, you need antivirus software. This software
isn’t a part of Windows, though many computer dealers often bundle either
the Norton AntiVirus program or the McAfee Virus Protection program. Many
other sources of antivirus programs are on the Internet. Table 24-1 lists some
popular ones.

Norton AntiVirus
www.symantec.com/avcenter/
Use antivirus software to scan your system, but not all the time. Some antivirus
programs allow you to manually scan the system every so often. That’s good.
But, antivirus programs that constantly scan the system waste resources.
Unless your computer is in a high-risk situation, such as in a very public
place, don’t bother with a constant scan.
Configure your antivirus software to scan all incoming files, such as e-mail
attachments and programs downloaded from the Internet. Those two door-
ways are the most common paths for viruses and other nasty programs to
mince into your PC.
With antivirus software installed and running on your PC, you have one less
thing to worry about and one less major problem to troubleshoot.
 Cleaning up after a computer virus requires great effort and lots of time.
It’s not something you want to do. In fact, many folks pay huge sums of
money to others to clean up a virus mess.
 Virus programs generally require you to subscribe to a service to keep
your computer up-to-date when fighting the latest viruses. Do not
neglect to pay for these services! They’re worth every penny!
 You can have two antivirus programs installed on your PC, though you
don’t run both at the same time. For example, use Norton to do a full
system scan, and then use Kaspersky to do the same thing. Often times,
one antivirus program catches something the other one misses.
 Avoid Web-based antivirus scans. Sure, some of them may be good and
legitimately do their job. I just don’t feel right recommending such a
thing to you.
 Refer to Chapter 21 for information on disabling antivirus software so
that you can install new programs on your computer.

Anti-spam
I suppose that spam is a common enough term these days that I don’t need
to explain it, but I will anyway: Spam is unwanted e-mail. Or, call it junk e-mail.
It floods nearly 50 percent of the average computer user’s e-mail inbox every
day. In fact, they say that more than 90 percent of all e-mail that’s sent will be
spam, or unwanted and unrequested advertising.
The best way to deal with spam is to create e-mail filters, which Outlook
Express called Mail Rules, to help weed out which messages are advertising
and which are legitimately intended for your own eyeballs. This task can
be tough because spam-senders are often very clever at disguising their 
messages.
 Refer to my book PCs For Dummies (Wiley Publishing, Inc.) for more
information on creating mail rules to block spam and other suspect
e-mail messages.
 I suggest avoiding such major spam-fighting tools as Earthlink Spaminator.
Those packages tend to be overly aggressive at blocking legitimate e-mail
as well as spam.
 I also recommend avoiding those e-mail verification services that require
legitimate e-mail users to do a puzzle or reply to a secret message before
they can send you e-mail. Although such services are popular and they
do work, many people (such as myself) who are very busy don’t have
time to deal with such things.
 Legitimate e-mail that is misinterpreted as spam is referred to as ham by
the computer geeks.
 A good program that helps eliminate spam before it even gets on your
computer is Mailwasher. Unlike having to writing e-mail filters, you can
train Mailwasher to sort out the good from the bad e-mail. This program
is free to download and use for 30 days. I recommend it!
www.mailwasher.net
Anti-spyware
Spyware is a rather new category for computer software. Basically, it’s
unwanted programs that are installed on your computer to monitor your
Internet habits. Based on that information, specific advertising is then targeted
to you. Although this doesn’t sound malevolent, many spyware programs are
devious and impossible to uninstall. Plus, often people don’t really want such
software on their computer without their knowledge.
341
Chapter 24: Useful Tools and Weapons

The best way to get rid of spyware is with anti-spyware software. Table 24-2
lists some packages I recommend. Be careful out there! Some programs that
advertise themselves as anti-spyware programs are, in fact, spyware of the
worst type!

 Computer feeling slow? Chances are that massive quantities of spyware
software are running on your computer — sometimes, multiple copies of
the same program running at once!
 It seems like fighting spyware would also be a function of antivirus soft-
ware, but it’s just not the case. Spyware, though it’s just as evil, isn’t the
same thing as a virus. Even so, recently I have noticed that many antivirus
programs now offer anti-spyware protection as well.
342
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 
How you can tell whether your 
computer has spyware
The frustrating thing about spyware is that you
cannot really tell what’s spyware and what isn’t.
Consider this: Most spyware isn’t advertised as
such. It’s given away freely on the Web, often as
some friendly tool or shopping helper. Though
some spyware sneaks into your computer, most
of it is downloaded by choice: shopping assis-
tants, calendar minders, free utilities, free wall-
paper or desktop backgrounds, free screen
savers, or any of a number of seemingly inno-
cent programs.
The problem occurs, and you probably first
notice that you have a problem, when you try to
uninstall the software you downloaded. That’s
when you discover that the program keeps
coming back — like an unwanted cat! Nothing
you try removes the program! You complain to
the developer, and it claims that you agreed to
keep the program on your computer when you
downloaded it — which you did, but who reads
all those software licensing agreements?
The next step you need to take is to get the anti-
spyware software that this book recommends.
Run that software. Then, remove the unwanted
program. Then, use the SpywareGuide link
(shown in the nearby “Anti-spyware” section)
to confirm any and all programs you want to
download from the Internet, to ensure that
you’re not downloading more spyware into your
computer.

 To confirm whether a given program is spyware, you can use the spyware
database at SpywareGuide:
www.spywareguide.com/
 Some spyware advertises itself as helpful programs you download. I
could name a few of these programs, but the likelihood is that my pub-
lisher or I would be sued for calling those well-known spyware programs
“spyware” in a book. This gives you just a small taste of how nasty these
programs — and their developers — can be.
 The best way to remove some unwanted program, which is usually spy-
ware, is with anti-spyware software.
Anti-hijacking
I almost included this category with spyware because it’s that similar. On
the Internet, a hijacking program is one that takes the home page you have
selected and changes it to some other page on the Internet — generally,
some advertising portal or, often, pornography.
The annoying thing: You didn’t make the change. You don’t even remember
making the change.
Even more annoying: You cannot change the home page back. Or, if you do,
the next time you run Internet Explorer, the annoying home page is back from
the dead! Creepy!
What’s happening is that your Web browser’s home page has been hijacked.
This can be done legitimately; most Web browsers, including Internet Explorer,
temporarily reassign the home page if an update or newer version is available.
But, that happens only once. Otherwise, hijacking occurs all the time and
often to Web pages that have nothing to do with legitimate computer products.
There are two ways to fix a hijacked home page. The first is to run anti-spyware
software. Most of those products have anti-hijacking features installed because
hijacking the home page is a common spyware technique. The second way is
to get anti-hijacking software. The one I recommend is Hijack This, though it’s
very technical. You can find it at
www.spywareinfo.com/~merijn/downloads.html
Finally, there’s a technical thing you can try. Most hijacking is done by modi-
fying a file named HOSTS.TXT in Windows. The file is used to associate certain
IP addresses with host names, which can be handy for some networking opera-
tions, but is mostly used to hijack Web pages.
343
Chapter 24: Useful Tools and Weapons

To open HOSTS, browse to this folder:
windows\system32\drivers\etc
The HOSTS file is plain text, so you can use Notepad to open it. When you do,
peruse the bottom of the file for any new entries. What you may see in the
case of a hijacked Web page is something like this:
365.10.23.145      google.com
What this entry does is to redirect any traffic intended for the Google domain
to the server at the IP address 365.10.23.145 — which is probably some bad
guy’s address.
When your home page has been hijacked, look for an entry matching the
home page Web site. If you find it there, just delete that line in Notepad.
Then, save the HOSTS file back to disk.
Note that this may be only a temporary solution: The program that rewrote
the HOSTS file may do it again when the computer restarts. That’s why I 
recommend using anti-spyware or anti-hijacking software first.
 Refer to Chapter 18 for information on changing the home page — 
legitimately — in Internet Explorer.
 Yeah, if you know what you’re doing, the HOSTS file can be a fun place to
play. But, don’t mess with it! Most anti-spyware programs assume that
any modification to the HOSTS file is bad.
344
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 
A quick way to tell whether a tool is crap
It’s a scary world out there on the Internet. Tons
of tools and helpers are available, many of
which seem like they do good. Or, do they? It’s
often hard to tell whether a promising tool does
what it advertises or whether it may cause more
trouble than it’s worth.
Whenever I encounter a computer utility that I
want, I do a brief test. First, I go to Google and
do a quick search for the tool’s name. For 
example, if the tool is named AntiBlorf, I type
“AntiBlorf” into the Search text box on the
Google main page (www.google.com) and
click the Search button. I then peruse the
results to see whether anything might be wrong.
Generally speaking, if a program is junk, the
search results shown by Google indicate so. In
the listing, you find references to the program
name you entered, along with various bad
words and accusations. Typically, the opinion-
ated links go to various online forums, where
disappointed users discuss the software. Or, if
the software is good, users praise the program.
Either way, you get some good feedback right
away.

Firewall protection
The Internet was designed by people who were very trusting of each other.
Picture the Internet as a big neighborhood where all the neighbors originally
liked each other so well that they not only left their doors and windows un-
locked, they also left them all open all the time. In a trusting environment —
and especially one in a nice warm climate — that’s a perfectly acceptable
thing to do. But, not these days.
The Internet is still designed with all open doors and windows. To close those
doors and windows, you need extra software on your computer, in the form of
a firewall. The firewall guards those open doors and windows — officially called
ports — to limit access both in and out to only those programs you allow.
Windows XP comes with a firewall, though its abilities are rather limited.
The SP2 update comes with a better firewall, though it monitors only incoming
traffic. Therefore, to truly protect your computer, you need a third-party fire-
wall. Norton makes one. McAfee makes one. And, you can get a decent free
one, from Zone Labs, named Zone Alarm.
www.zonelabs.com
The idea behind using a firewall is to train it to recognize which programs are
okay to use the Internet and which are not. This is done as you use the firewall
software. As you do, you see a pop-up window asking whether such-and-such
a program can access such-and-such a service on the Internet, similar to what’s
shown in Figure 24-7. You then click a button to allow or deny access or, if
access has already been denied, you click OK, as shown in Figure 24-7. That’s
how the firewall is trained, and how it works.
Figure 24-7:

Chapter 24: Useful Tools and Weapons

When you get a request for Internet access — in or out — from an unknown
or unlikely program, you click the Deny button. Deny! Deny! Deny! That’s how
you keep the bad guys out of your computer.

The Benefits of Backup
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to back up
 Backing up stuff
 Choosing a backup strategy
B
ackup is drudgery only if you have never, ever, had a disk problem at
any time in your entire life, and maybe even before then. Otherwise,
those who use Backup and have benefited from its goodness sing the Daily
Praises of Backup song every doo-dah day:
O Sing we now of old Backup
That good utility;
Our data’s safe, no disk blow-up
Will cause anxiety
So, I won’t sit here and debate myself while you read. Instead, if you’re wise,
you’ll heed my backup advice. If you’re foolish, you’ll rip these pages from
this book’s binding and make yourself a most excellent paper hat.
What to Back Up, What Not to Back Up
A backup is nothing more than a safety copy — a duplicate — of your files,
data, and important stuff. It exists “just in case.” So, if anything happens to
the original, you can always rely on the good old trusty backup. Sounds kind
of wholesome, doesn’t it?
The main problem with backing up is that performing the operation is time-
consuming. (In the old days, backing up to floppy disk was labor-consuming
as well because you had to continually exchange floppy disks.) Backing up is
time-consuming because it must create a fresh copy of all the information on
your hard drive. But, does it need to be all the information?

Back up everything! Purists argue that a full hard drive backup is the only way
to fully restore your computer. After all, if a virus infects a slew of files, the
easiest way to restore those files is from a full backup.
Back up just your stuff! On the other hand, why back up files that you can
easily copy from an installation CD? If the worst happens, you can reinstall
Windows and reinstall drivers and applications. Then, use the backup disks
to reinstall all your own stuff. That too works, and it saves backup media and
time as well.
Which option do you choose? How about a compromise? When you first do a
backup, back up everything — the entire hard drive. From then on, just back
up your own stuff. If you ever revamp the system or install upgrades, do
another full disk backup.
Then again, the choices and options available for backing up are limitless, so
it depends on your patience, experience, and willingness to do the backup in
the first place.
 There’s no need to back up the applications installed on your computer;
it’s easier just to reinstall them. No, the most important thing on your
computer is your data — the stuff you created and stored.
 You can restore Windows and your software only if you have a copy of
the original installation CD or a reinstall disk that came with the com-
puter. Don’t throw that stuff out!
348
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 
Various backup terms
Backup programs may use some interesting ter-
minology. Sometimes, the backup manual
explains the terms; sometimes, it doesn’t. If not,
here are my own handy definitions of various
backup terms.
Full backup: This term refers to a complete
backup of the entire hard drive. All the files
backed up are marked “backed up” by the com-
puter. That way, you can easily spot new files
created after the backup.
Specific backup: Only those files that are
selected are backed up.
Incremental backup: This term refers to a
backup of only those files created or modified
since the last full backup.
Differential backup: This type is the same as an
Incremental backup in that only files modified
since the last backup are archived. However,
unlike an incremental backup, the files backed
up are not marked as having been backed up 
(a rare option to select).
Copy: Files are backed up, but they’re not
marked as having been backed up, as they
would be for a full backup.

 Keep copies of all the software you install on your computer. I keep the
original CDs in the boxes the software came in.
How to Back Up
A backup is nothing more than a file copy. Here’s how to back up any file:
1. Open the My Documents folder.
2. Click to select any document.
It doesn’t matter which one.
3. Press Ctrl+C to copy the file.
4. Press Ctrl+V to paste the file.
The file is copied into the same folder, but given a new name with the
prefix Copy of.
What you have done is to duplicate a file. It isn’t a shortcut because the
duplicate is identical to the original: same size, type, dates, and contents,
but different names because two files in the same folder cannot share the
same name.
The problem with this type of backup is that there’s no safety. Sure, you can
use the backup if something happens to the original file. But, if the folder is
deleted or the entire hard drive is damaged, the backup or file copy is useless.
No, the key to backing up is to store the backup on another media: a CD-R,
DVD-R, a Zip disc, a flash drive, a disk drive on the network, or a second
physical drive inside of or attached to the computer.
You may freely delete the duplicate file you just created.
 Media is a general term describing a place where information can be
written, such as a hard drive, floppy disk, CD-R, or Zip disc.
 Also included in backup media is the tape drive, though tape drives aren’t
as common (or as cheap) as they were just a few short years ago.
 The best backups are those you can make to a separate media, such as
any removable disk or an external disk drive. That way, you can remove
and lock up the disk, just to be safe.
 Simply copying a file counts toward creating a backup. In fact, when I “back
up” this book’s files at the end of the day, I simply copy the files’ folder
to a flash memory drive. I just copy and paste using Windows Explorer.
349
Chapter 25: The Benefits of Backup

 If you have a second physical hard drive, you can back up your files to 
it rather than to a removable disk. This method isn’t as safe as using a
removable disk (which can be locked in a fire safe), but it’s better than
merely copying the files to the same disk. Refer to Chapter 15 to find out
how to tell a physical disk from a logical disk.
 Expensive software and hardware backup solutions are available, though
they’re mostly used by large institutions or corporations. These solutions
include DAT drives, RAID drives, and other high-end methods of data
protection that you needn’t worry about.
Backing up without backup software
To merely copy a group of files (to back up without using backup software), you
just need to drag and drop the clutch of icons from one disk to another — from
the hard drive to the CD-R disc or from the hard drive to a Zip disc. It’s a
simple file-copy operation, and it works.
This process has two limitations. The first is that it’s up to you to determine
whether all the files will fit on the destination disk. For example, you cannot
copy 1,300MB of your stuff to a 720MB CD-R disc. It just doesn’t work. Ditto
for copying 400MB of files to a 250MB Zip disc. No amount of suitcase-sitting
gets those extra bytes on the disc. No way!
The second limitation is simply automation: “Real” backup software automates
the process. Plus, it may even let the backup span across multiple disks,
which certainly saves some time.
In any event, suppose that you want to back up using the old file-copy
method:
First, decide what you want to back up. Because space is limited, perhaps you
should back up only the contents of the My Documents folder. Or, if you sup-
pose that’s too big, back up perhaps only a handful of folders in which you
have current projects.
Second, determine the size of those folders. You can do this task by examining
the folder’s Properties dialog box. The following steps assume that you’re
trying to gauge the size of the My Documents folder:
1. Open the My Documents icon on the desktop.
To calculate the folder’s size, you must visit the parent folder, the folder
that contains the folder you’re working in. You do that by clicking the Up
Folder button.
2. Click the Up Folder button.
3. Right-click the My Documents folder.
350
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

4. Choose Properties from the pop-up menu.
If you see the Target tab in the folder’s Properties dialog box, you have
stumbled across one of the many Windows shortcut icons. Heed these
steps:
a. Click the Find Target button.
b. Repeat Steps 3 and 4.
You should see the General tab of the folder’s Properties dialog box, as
shown in Figure 25-1. Note the size! In Figure 25-1, it’s 124MB, which is
enough to fit on a 250MB Zip disc or a CD-R disc.
5. Close the Properties dialog box.
6. Close any other open windows, except for the original window you
opened.
Third, prepare the backup disk. Insert a CD-R disc into the drive and prepare it
for receiving information (format the disk). Or, insert a Zip disc or scout out a
location for the files on a second hard drive.
Fourth, copy the files. Use any one of the numerous Windows file-copying com-
mands to duplicate the files on the backup disk.
Fifth, put the disk in a safe place. Remove the disk from the drive. (Burn the
CD-R/RW disc.) Properly label it. Date it. And then, store it in a safe place.
Sixth, repeat these steps every so often. The more often you back up, the
better the chances of recovery if anything nasty happens.

A folder’s

351
Chapter 25: The Benefits of Backup

If these steps are all you follow to back up your stuff, that’s great. The draw-
backs are obvious, however. First, you can effectively back up only stuff that
fits on a single disk. Second, you really can’t tell the difference between
what’s backed up and what’s new, so performing an incremental backup
between major backups is fairly impossible. Third, if you’re that religious
about things, you may as well get real backup software anyway.
 Honestly, for backing up a single folder, project folder, or today’s work,
the file-copy is perhaps the best way to go.
 Not every My Documents folder handily fits on a removable disk. In fact,
the computer I’m writing this book on has 1,200MB of files in the My
Documents folder and its subfolders — far too many to stick on an indi-
vidual disk. In those cases, you must use real backup software, which
can archive files across multiple disks — and keep track of everything.
 I keep all my backup disks and tapes in a fire safe. It’s not expensive or
anything fancy. Most office supply stores carry them.
Backing up with real backup software
The difference between merely copying files and using real backup software
is immense. Real backup software tries as best it can to automate the
process, and it can access a variety of backup devices, from special tape
drives to CD-R, Zip discs, and other removable disks. Plus, you have filters
and other ways to select which files get backed up and how often. Backup
software can organize backups by “set.” You can do scheduling. It’s pretty
amazing stuff, and most of the programs are easy to use.
The following steps outline how you would perform a backup of your stuff
using the less-than-impressive Backup program that comes with Windows XP.
1. Start the backup program; from the Start button’s menu, choose All
Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪Backup.
This step normally runs the Backup or Restore Wizard. Otherwise, the
Backup Utility window is seen. (To return to the wizard, which I recom-
mend, choose Tools➪Switch to Wizard Mode from the Backup Utility
window’s menu.)
2. Click the Next button.
3. Choose the option labeled Backup Files and Settings.
The next screen narrows down your choices for what to back up, as
shown in Figure 25-2. The first three options are very clever, as
described on the screen and in the figure.
Choose the last option to back up specific folders or projects. When you
make this selection, in this or any Backup program, your next step is to
352
Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

select the files you want to back up. When you choose one of the first
three options, the computer already knows what to back up.
4. Click the Next button.
5. Select the backup media.
Backup media is fancy talk for the location where the backup file will be
stored. You see, all the files and stuff you back up are balled into one
huge thing — like a giant rubber band ball. The backup program can
put that all on one large storage place or split it into pieces for storing
across several CD-R discs, for example.
Please do not choose the floppy disk option for backup! Even on a new
Windows computer, it would take more floppies to store your backup
files than any Office Max has at any given time. Nope: Choose a removable
drive for the backup file.
(As this book goes to press, Windows Backup does not recognize or
back up to CD-R discs. This may change in the future.)
You can use the Browse button to choose a location on a specific drive.
Browse to the My Computer window, and then open the drive’s icon to
use that drive.
6. Type a name for the backup set.
Here’s where I take advantage of the long file-naming rules in Windows. I
like to name a backup set by the date and contents. For example:
2005-10-01_My Documents
This filename tells me that the backup set was from October 1, 2005, and
that it contains the My Documents folder and its subfolders. I suggest
that you be equally as clever when assigning a name to your backup.

7. Click the Next button.
Review the summary screen. Use the Back button to go back and make
changes, if necessary.
8. Click the Finish button.
You’re not really done.
9. Watch the screen.
Or, you can go off and do something. Depending on what you’re backing
up, the operation could take a while. Figure 25-3 shows a sample Backup
Progress window. Pay attention to the Estimated Remaining Time, as
shown in the window. That tells you whether you have time to take a hot
bath or whether you need to stick close to the PC.
10. Swap backup disks, if prompted.
Remove the old disk, insert a new disk, and continue.
11. Avoid reading the detailed summary screen.
12. Click the Close button.
The backup is done. But you aren’t!
13. Remove the last backup disk, if necessary.
14. Store the backup disks in a safe place.
Now you’re done.
Now you can sleep easier, knowing that your stuff is backed up. That safety
copy means that any accident, hardware failure, virus, or runaway 13-year-old
“computer genius” can damage your hard drive all it wants. You can restore
your stuff quickly and easily.

Part III: Preventive Maintenance 

 Some versions of Windows XP Home don’t have a Backup program. If so,
you may want to check the Windows CD to see whether the program is
there. If so, you can install it per the instructions on the CD.
 Backup’s sister, Restore, is covered in Chapter 4.
 One third-party backup program I can recommend is Dantz Retrospect
Professional. You can download a free 30-day trial version from
www.dantz.com/
 Try to keep within earshot of the PC when you’re backing up. There are
audible warnings in case something goes wrong and audible prompts for
inserting new disks, if necessary.
 Audible means that the computer makes noise.
 It’s best to back up to removable media, such as CD-R or CD-RW discs.
 I recommend using CD-R discs rather than CD-RW. The former are
cheaper than the latter. So, rather than keep and reuse CD-RW discs,
it makes more sense to just throw away an old CD-R when you’re done
with it. (Or, dispose of it properly per your location’s recycling laws.)
 Get a fire safe for holding your backup disks. You can find inexpensive
fire safes at most office supply stores. Note that it helps to put the back-
ups in the safe and close the safe’s door for things to work best.
When to Back Up
If you can get yourself into a regular backup schedule, great! It doesn’t have
to be rigorously followed. After all, if you use your computer only every so
often, there’s no point in backing up new stuff that doesn’t exist.
For everyone, at least once, do a full backup of everything on your com-
puter. That only needs to be redone after you install new software or update
something.
Here’s the schedule I recommend for diehard office environments:
 On Friday, a backup of everyone’s documents and settings (see the
second option in Figure 25-2). Use three sets of backup media: A, B, and
C. Rotate the sets so that you do a full backup with a different set every
week.
 Every day, do an incremental backup and back up only those files that
were changed, modified, or added during the day. You set an incremental
backup by clicking the Advanced button (after Step 7 from the preceding
section). Then, choose Incremental from the drop-down list.
355
Chapter 25: The Benefits of Backup

These two steps are the most thorough way to cover all bases. Any disk
mishap means that you’re out of only a day’s worth of work.
For the casual user, the same type of schedule can be employed, but do the
full backup once a month and the incremental backup once a week. Because
you’re probably not creating as much stuff as you would in an office environ-
ment, you don’t need to be as rigorous about backing up. However, if you want
to be really safe — and for those folks who fall between each system — also
perform this operation:
At the end of the day, do a full backup of your main project folder.
For example, at the late evening hour when I finish today’s work, I shall close
down Word and back up this book’s folder by copying it to a flash memory
disk. I could also schedule a sophisticated backup program to do that for me
automatically, but it’s not really a bother to perform the operation myself.
 I suppose that any schedule works as long as you stick to it.
 Also check out your backup program’s automation features to see
whether you can schedule backups for times when you’re away from 
the computer.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
don’t feel that a list has any legitimacy unless it has at
least ten items in it. Top three lists? A joke. Anyone can
come up with three things. It’s silly. Top five? Nope. Odds
are that if five things are on the list, there are most likely
five more and the person concocting the list has done
only half the research. Ten things? Whether they’re the
top ten or just ten things, you know that they’re all good
things — or at least that the list will have enough good
things to make up for the mediocre things. The odds are
in your favor!
In this, the traditional final part of a Dummies book, I 
present you with various chapters that contain lists of
10 things dealing with troubleshooting your PC. Actually, I
started out with 20 things in each chapter and then pared
it down to only the best 10. That way, I’m certain that you
won’t feel ripped off.

Chapter 26
The Ten Rules of Tech Support
In This Chapter
 Don’t abuse technical support
 Keep paper and pencil handy
 Behave
 Try to get a name and number
 Prepare
 Know your computer
 Be brief
 Be patient
 Try to get a case number
 Say “Thank you”
I
believe you’ll find that the task of phoning tech support is made all the
easier if you keep the following rules in mind.
Don’t Use Technical Support As an
Excuse for Not Reading the Manual 
or Using the Help System
Always look up your problem first in the manual or the online help. Second,
visit the company’s Web site and look for a Technical Support link, FAQ list,
or troubleshooter. If you can find the answer there, great! Even if you don’t,
the tech-support people will appreciate that you have made the effort.

Have Something to Write On
This advice not only gives you a pad to doodle on while you wait on hold, but
also means that you can take down notes and instructions as you’re given
them. You may also need to write down a case number, in case your issue is
unresolved and you need to call back. That saves a great deal of repetition
later and helps serve as a record of your tech-support call.
Be Nice
Each new call is a mystery to the tech-support person. The person doesn’t
know you, doesn’t know your problem, and doesn’t know how long you have
been waiting on hold. None of those things is that person’s fault, and he 
doesn’t need to hear you scream about any of it.
The tech-support person is there to help you. That person didn’t cause the
problem and isn’t out to get you. The friendlier and more informative you can
be, the better for the other person.
Be Sure to Get the Person’s Name and a
Number Where You Can Call Back
Before diving into the problem, get some basic information about your 
tech-support person. Generally speaking, the person says his name when
he answers the phone: “This is Satrajit in technical support. How can I help
you?” Write down “Satrajit” on your notepad.
If possible, ask for a direct line on which to call back in case the call breaks off.
Sometimes they have it, and sometimes they don’t. Accept whatever answer
the person gives you.
 If a tech-support person says that she doesn’t have a direct line or that
she cannot be contacted directly, it’s most likely a lie. Don’t get mad! The
company typically has a policy not to give out direct lines, so she’s being
forced to lie on purpose. This is policy, not an excuse to ignore you.
 You can also try to get an employee number up front.
360
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Prepare: Do the Research before You Call
Exhaust every possibility and potential solution on your own before you
phone tech support. Ensure that you’re referring to things by their proper
terms. If not, carefully describe what things look like.
Have These Items Handy: Serial Number,
Order Number, Customer Number
Often, tech support needs confirmation of who you are and that you have a
legitimate product before you can continue. You should get items like serial
numbers beforehand — especially if the serial number is on the computer’s
butt and the computer’s butt is up against the wall under your table.
It also helps to know which version of Windows you’re using. Do this:
1. Click the Start button.
2. Choose the Run command.
Or, press the Win+R key combination, which summons the Run dialog box.
3. Type WINVER into the text box.
4. Click OK.
The WinVer program displays a dialog box that details which version of
Windows you’re using.
You may also see which is your CD-ROM drive, whether it’s D or E or whatever.
Don’t Spill Your Guts
The tech-support person needs to know about the problem, not about what
doom and peril await you if you can’t get your computer working in time.
Remember that most tech-support people are under the clock; they may
have only 12 minutes to deal with you, so be as direct as possible.
361
Chapter 26: The Ten Rules of Tech Support

Be Patient
Tech support always assumes that you don’t know anything about your com-
puter. Don’t bother saying, “But I really know computers. My wife calls me a
‘computer genius.’” That doesn’t speed things up!
Often, tech-support people must follow a script and check things off despite
your insistence that you have already done such a thing or another. Just follow
along and eventually they catch up with you.
Get a Case Number
Before the call is over, try to get a case number, especially if the result is incon-
clusive or doesn’t meet with your liking. The case number ensures that the
next time you call, the support person can read over the incident and you
have less repeating and reexplaining to do.
 You don’t need a case number if the problem is solved.
 Some tech-support people give case numbers whether the problem is
solved or not. Write it down and keep track of it for later.
Thank the Person
Whether your tech-support person solves the problem or not, thank the
person for her time and efforts at assisting you. I’m not sure why, but it’s just
one of those things that was beaten into me as a child. (Heck, I even thanked
the bullies who stole my lunch money.)

Ten Dumb Error Messages
In This Chapter
 Illegal operation
 Invalid page fault
 General protection fault
 Fatal exception
 Windows protection error
 KERNEL32.DLL errors
 The blue screen of death
 Stack overflow
 Divide by zero
 Command interpreter errors
H
oo, boy, this could be one long chapter! If only computers had just ten
dumb error messages. But they don’t. They have thousands. Back when
I wrote the original DOS For Dummies (in 1991), I asked for and received from
Microsoft a list of all possible error messages in DOS Version 5 — all 20,000 of
them. And, that was only DOS! Over the evolution of Windows, I can imagine
that several hundred thousand error messages are possible — so many that I
doubt Microsoft has them all listed.
This chapter lists what I consider to be the most popular, annoying, or just
frustrating dumb error messages. Obviously, it’s not the entire list. That
would take too much room to print — and too much booze for me to write
them all down.

The Program Has Performed an Illegal
Operation and Will Be Shut Down; 
If the Problem Persists, Contact the
Program Vendor
In our modern “What is legal?” society, this error message often induces
uncalled-for terror in the bosom of its victims. What is legal, anyway?
Relax! In the computer world, the word illegal is used to describe a program-
ming operation that isn’t allowed. The computer programmers could have
used the words prohibited or corrupt instead, but they didn’t.
Another popular word to use is invalid, as demonstrated by the next several
error messages. The word is pronounced “in-VALid,” as in “not valid.” It’s not
“IN-valid,” as in “incapacitated by illness.”
Anyway! The program has done something beyond your control. Too bad.
Shut down the computer. Restart Windows. Start over.
Don’t bother contacting the “program vendor.” Odds are that the vendor
doesn’t want to hear from you, knows about the bug, and won’t fix it. You can
try if you want, but my experience has shown that they really, really don’t
care. And, that’s too bad.
Invalid Page Fault
This message has to do primarily with virtual memory, or disk storage that’s
used to bolster physical RAM. When a program attempts to access a chunk of
virtual memory that doesn’t exist, has been damaged, or is used by another
program, you see the “Invalid Page Fault” gem of a message. There’s nothing
you can do about it.
Page is a term closely associated with virtual memory in Windows. Though
virtual memory is one big, contiguous chunk of disk space, it’s accessed
through smaller chunks, called pages.
General Protection Fault
Who knows? Apparently, something is wrong, but Windows is unsure about
the specifics; hence, the word general. From the word protection, you can
364
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

assume that one program tried to stomp on some other program’s turf.
Windows responds by immediately killing the offending program and issuing
this error message.
This is one instance where the Dr. Watson tool can be effective. Watson must
be running in order to catch this one, and even if it is, good luck trying to find
someone who can interpret Dr. Watson’s results. (I’m not a big Watson fan;
refer to Chapter 24.)
San Andreas Fault
I’m just checking to see whether you’re paying attention.
365
Chapter 27: Ten Dumb Error Messages
Optional and fatal exceptional information
The 0D in Fatal Exception 0D is a number, not a
code. In this case, it’s a hexadecimal number,
which we humans would read as 13 — unlucky
13. Likewise, the 0E in Fatal Exception 0E is
another number, 14. Here are the official Fatal
Exception Family Error Numbers, their official
names, and their brief meanings:
00 Divide Fault: Some idiot program tried to
divide a number by zero.
02 NMI Interrupt: This hardware problem is too
complex to explain in the space provided.
04 Overflow Trap: The washing machine is dump-
ing water faster than the pipes can handle it.
05 Bounds Check Fault: Something is out of
whack, so far that the whack woke up the
microprocessor, which generated this error.
06 Invalid Opcode Fault: The microprocessor
has encountered an instruction of a type it
hasn’t seen before. Yet, unlike the intrepid voy-
agers in a Star Trek episode, the microproces-
sor decides that it’s time to cash in the chips and
call it a day.
07 Coprocessor Not Available Fault: Because all
Pentium computers come with a coprocessor
installed, either the program is being run on a
very old computer or the program is just being
stupid.
08 Double Fault: The service changes sides in a
tennis match.
09 Coprocessor Segment Overrun: The floating-
point number is so large that it floats up and
lodges in the cooling fan. The system has to
stop while it unheats.
0A Invalid Task State Segment Fault: This mes-
sage is rare ever since they banned alcohol
from the fraternities over at Task State.
0B Not Present Fault: This message is com-
monly found in areas unaccustomed to earth-
quakes.
0C Stack Fault: See “Leaning Tower of Pisa
Error.”
10 Coprocessor Error Fault: The microprocessor
misses the plane because the coprocessor is
still in the bathroom and she has the tickets in
her purse.
11 Alignment Check Fault: The computer sends
a donation to the wrong political party.

Fatal Exception 0D
The first of the Fatal Exception brothers (and I suppose that Fatal Exceptions
0A, 0B, and 0C exist, but they have apparently passed on to a higher realm —
possibly Unix), Fatal Exception 0D occurs when a program does something
unusual or unexpected. In this case, the problem can be local to the display,
to multimedia, or to other device drivers being corrupt or evil.
Fatal Exception 0E
A variation on the Invalid Page Fault error, this one crops up (again) when the
program does something unusual or unexpected or somehow touches invalid
or forbidden data. This error and the Invalid Page Fault error have subtle dif-
ferences between them — subtle enough not to care about.
Perhaps the biggest difference between this error and the Invalid Page Fault
error is that your Fatal Exception 0E requires that the computer be restarted
in order to recover. Nasty.
Windows Protection Error
Whereas the other faults and errors described in this chapter seem to be
rather vague (or involve virtual memory), this error is straightforward: You
have a problem with a VxD, or virtual device driver. The solution is to boot
into Safe mode and reinstall the virtual device driver in question (refer to
Chapter 24).
Numerous other problems can also induce a Windows protection error. The
error message text states the specific source, such as memory, or a specific
file or the Registry, for example.
Errors Involving KERNEL32.DLL
The kernel file gets blamed for lots of problems, but it causes relatively few of
them. In fact, it’s because the kernel file is so robust that many mishaps are
caught and error messages displayed. In other words, KERNEL32.DLL is the
messenger, and we don’t kill the messenger, boys and girls.
Errors tossed back at the KERNEL32.DLL file include problems with the
swap file, damaged files, injured-password lists, smashed Registry entries,
366
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

microprocessor troubles, bad software programs, corrupted drivers, viruses,
and low disk space. The KERNEL32.DLL file catches lots of flack.
 As usual, restarting Windows fixes this problem.
 If you clock your CPU (run the microprocessor at a higher speed [MHz]
than it’s rated), you can get frequent KERNEL32.DLL errors.
 Hardware trouble — such as a hot PC, a broken power supply, static, or
radio frequency noise — can also produce KERNEL32.DLL errors.
Blue-Screen-of-Death Errors
When it’s a big and important error, Windows doesn’t mess around with a
dialog box or cute graphics and icons. No, it goes straight back to its soul:
DOS! And the error message is displayed on a text screen; white text on a
blue background. It’s called the Blue Screen of Death. Generally, these errors
are either fatal or important enough that they require immediate attention.
 If the error message says something along the lines of “Wait for window
or press any key (or Ctrl+Alt+Delete) to reboot,” then reboot. You can
try waiting — especially if you feel that you can fix the problem or the
problem will fix itself — but it’s normally Ctrl+Alt+Delete+Pray.
 Sometimes, the error message is simply urgent and not life threatening.
For example, you may be asked to reinsert a disk that the computer was
using. If so, obey the instructions, and the computer continues working.
Stack Overflow
Technically a programmer’s error, a stack overflow happens when a program
runs low on a specific type of memory. The memory is called the stack, and
it’s used to store information for the program — like a scratch pad.
The problem is that the stack has only so much room and a sloppy or damaged
program can use up that room quickly. When that happens, the microprocessor
must take over and rescue the program, lest it bring down the entire computer
system. The microprocessor steps in by halting the program and issuing a
“stack overflow” error message.
There’s nothing you can do about it other than complain to the program
developer.
367
Chapter 27: Ten Dumb Error Messages

Divide By Zero
Another error caught by the microprocessor is the divide by zero error. When
you try to divide something by zero on your pocket calculator, you get an E
to indicate an error. The computer equivalent of the E is that the microproces-
sor steps in, stops the program, and issues a divide-by-zero error message.
No, there’s nothing you can do about this error message either. You can try
complaining to the software developer, but it usually blames you for it.
Bad or Missing Command Interpreter
This error is more of a DOS issue, but because the command prompt is still a
part of Windows, you may see it from time to time.
The command prompt itself is a program named COMMAND.COM or CMD.
COM (same thing). It’s the program that displays the command prompt and
runs other DOS programs and commands. Nerds would call it “the shell” pro-
gram, for some obscure beach reference. Anyway.
When a DOS program closes, it’s supposed to return control to COMMAND.
COM. If memory space is tight or the program that was just run is corrupted,
COMMAND.COM often can’t be found. In that case, the DOS session hangs up
and issues a “Bad or missing command interpreter” message.
Fortunately, this message doesn’t mean disaster or instill the terror that it
once did with DOS users. When you see the message, simply close the DOS
window and get on with your life.

Ten Things You Should 
Never or Always Do
In This Chapter
 Never work in Safe mode all the time
 Never reinstall the operating system
 Never reformat the hard drive
 Never delete random files
 Never let other people use your computer
 Never steal software
 Always shut down Windows properly
 Always back up
 Always set Restore Points
 Always scan for viruses
You should always brush your teeth before you go to bed. No! You should
always brush your teeth when you get up in the morning. No, better still,
just walk around all day with a toothbrush in your mouth. Constantly brush
your teeth! And floss!
Oh, boy! I hate lectures. But, I thought that I would end this book with one
just because I have been really good this time and haven’t done much finger
wagging. You see, it really isn’t your fault! If you still have shame, consider
reading through these ten things you should or shouldn’t do. That should
sate your guilt gland.

Never Run Your Computer 
in Safe Mode All the Time
Safe mode is for troubleshooting and fixing things. It’s not the computer’s
standard operating mode. And though you can get work done in that mode,
that’s not what that mode is there for.
 I know that this advice makes sense, yet I get e-mail from people who do
run their computers all the time in Safe mode.
 Perhaps it’s the name. Maybe it should be called Fixing mode or
Troubleshooting mode.
 Refer to Chapter 24 for more Safe mode stuff.
Never Reinstall Windows
Reinstalling Windows is a bad idea, especially considering that most problems
can be fixed without having to reinstall. Only if your computer is ravaged by
a virus or some other catastrophe is reinstalling the operating system ever
necessary.
 Lazy tech-support people suggest reinstalling Windows just to get you
off the line. Don’t give up that easily!
 Also refer to Chapter 20.
Never Reformat the Hard Drive
You have no reason to do this. It’s not a routine chore. It’s not required. It’s
not a part of owning a PC.
As with reinstalling Windows, reformatting a hard drive is necessary only if
the system is utterly destroyed by some catastrophe. Otherwise, this is a rare
and unnecessary thing to do.
370
Part IV: The Part of Tens 

Never Randomly Delete 
Files You Didn’t Create
I think that the emphasis in this heading is more on “randomly” than on “files
you didn’t create.” In many instances in this book, you have permission to
delete certain files that you didn’t create or cause to come into being. My
point is merely to be careful with what you delete. Don’t be hasty. Don’t
assume just because you don’t know what something does that it’s okay to
delete it. That gets people into trouble.
Never Let Other People 
Use Your Computer
Windows XP is designed for multiple people to use the system — as long as
each person has their own account. So, give them their own account! Don’t
let them use your account. There’s no point in that!
Treat the computer like you would your wallet: Never loan it out to anyone
unless you expect to have it returned in a different condition. Your computer
is a private thing. Keep it private.
 Especially avoid letting visitors — relatives, specifically — use your
computer. All it takes is one grandnephew to infect your computer with
all sorts of viruses.
 If visitors really want to use a computer, they can bring their own or go
to the library.
 Be firm. Say “No.”
Never Use Pirated Software
Pirated or stolen software — or any software you didn’t pay for — is often
the source of computer viruses. Sure, it may be “free.” But, who knows what
idiot put what virus on that CD-R?
Pirated games are perhaps the single greatest source of viruses in the PC
world. You just run a terrible risk — not to mention that it’s legally and
morally wrong to steal.
371
Chapter 28: Ten Things You Should Never or Always Do

Always Shut Down Windows Properly
Use the Shut Down Windows dialog box to make the operating system die a
peaceful death. The idea is to try to avoid the situation where you just turn
off the computer. That leads to major problems down the road.
Of course, if the system doesn’t let you shut down properly, you have to just
flip the power switch. Refer to Chapter 22 for some help.
Always Back Up
Whether it’s just copying today’s files to a removable disk or using real
backup software, you would be wise to have a spare copy of your data
handy (refer to Chapter 25).
Always Set Restore Points before
Installing New Software or Hardware
The System Restore utility is a must-use tool for whenever you upgrade your
system. Remember that change introduces problems in many computers.
Having the ability to “go back in time” with System Restore is a blessing. Set
those Restore Points!
Refer to Chapter 4.
Always Scan for Viruses
I highly recommend using antivirus software. It’s a must. In fact, it’s shocking
that such a utility isn’t a part of Windows. (Oh, but I could go on. . . .) Instead,
I recommend investing in a good antivirus program, such as Norton AntiVirus
or any program that offers updates via the Internet.
Computing in this decade is a dangerous thing. Make it safer. Use antivirus
software. Refer to Chapter 24.
Keep your antivirus subscription up-to-date! New viruses are introduced all
the time. Be safe! Protect yourself.

Windows Startup Program

I
t would take a mighty thick appendix to list the thousands and thousands
of Windows startup programs that are available. Even then, the list is con-
tinually growing, with new applications and programs (not to mention new
viruses and worms) being developed all the time.
Rather than list everything here, I present you with a selection of Web pages
you can visit. These pages list startup programs, describe what the programs
do, and specify whether the program is legitimate or spyware or a virus. Also,
these pages are updated often, so you know that the information you’re getting
is fresh.

by no means complete; other Web pages documenting the startup programs
undoubtedly exist.
