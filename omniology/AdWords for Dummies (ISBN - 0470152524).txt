About the Author
Howie Jacobson, PhD, has been an Internet marketing strategist since 1999.
He specializes in helping clients use Google AdWords to grow their busi-
nesses. Due to the fact that he was forced to study statistical methods in
graduate school, Jacobson took to direct marketing as soon as he tripped
over it in 2001.
He is the creator of “Leads into Gold,” a home-study course that teaches
small-business owners how to become their own direct-marketing agencies.
He is also co-creator of The System Seminar’s home-study course, “Internet
Marketing for Smart Beginners,” along with System founder Ken McCarthy
and Cindy Kappler.
Jacobson has presented at several System Seminar events, at Perry
Marshall’s AdWords Seminar, and at workshops and seminars around the
world. He is a regular contributor to HorsesMouth.com, a performance-
improvement site for financial advisors, as well as a former writer for
Vault.com. He is the second-tallest member of Perry Marshall’s AdWords
Coaching faculty, and has worked with Marshall since 2003. He leads tele-
phone seminars on beginner and advanced AdWords topics and provides
online coaching and support at his Web site, www.askhowie.com.
Jacobson also runs www.loweryourbidprice.com, a company that produces
software tools that help AdWords advertisers and AdWords consultants save
time, reduce costs, and increase profits.
Luckily for you, Jacobson began his career as a schoolteacher. He learned
through trial-by-fire how to be engaging, clear, and entertaining while provid-
ing value and motivating results. He is also a business coach and trainer,
skilled in turning learning into action, helping his own clients and a horde of
others in association with Bregman Partners, Inc., and The Avoca Group.
Jacobson combines his marketing expertise with his background in and pas-
sion for health and fitness at FitFam.com, a resource for parents struggling to
raise fit and healthy kids in a crazy-busy world. 
He lives in Durham, North Carolina, with his wife, two kids, big goofy dog, and
little mountaineering hamster. His lifelong ambition is to bring about world
peace through marketing — and after that’s accomplished, to play Ultimate
Frisbee in the 2044 Olympics in Maui.

Dedication
This book is dedicated to the people I annoyed and ignored the most during
the writing of it: my children Yael and Elan, and my wife. Mia, I love you more
than any of my favorite song lyrics can say. Yael, continue to strive for justice
and keep making the world a more beautiful and unpredictable place. Elan,
keep growing strong and true, and share your belly laugh with everyone you
meet.
I also dedicate this book to my mother, Lucie Jacobson, whose example
reminds me to give generously and live big, and the memory of my father,
Joel R. Jacobson, a courageous man with a kind heart and a great squash
serve.
Author’s Acknowledgments
If I were to properly acknowledge on one page all the help I received while
writing this book , I’d be using Times New Roman 0.01-point font and you’d
be reading this with an electron microscope.
My wonderful editors at Wiley Publishing: Melody Layne, Steve Hayes, 
Jean Rogers, and Barry Childs-Helton. They have been patient with my 
whining, accepting of nothing but my best, and always ready with advice and
reassurance. 
My technical advisors at Google, Jason Rose, Fred Vallaeys, and Emily Harris,
answered my frequent volleys of questions with celerity and grace. We
haven’t met, but I like to think of them riding their Segways from the office to
the gourmet lunch rooms at the Googleplex.
Big hugs to the many AdWords experts who shared their wisdom, stories,
and sometimes even keywords. Perry Marshall is such a fine AdWords
teacher, business associate, and friend that I wonder what good deeds 
I performed in my previous life to deserve him. David Bullock and Glenn
Livingston shared their best stuff with me freely and often — I apologize to
their clients and spouses for all the time I monopolized while asking them
questions. David even agreed, in a moment of weakness, to become the tech-
nical editor for the book. Luckily, I asked and he agreed just before he was
featured in Black Enterprise Magazine and became the most sought-after
Taguchi expert in the country.

Timothy Seward, my neighbor in North Carolina, has taught me more about
Analytics than I thought there was to know. If I’d been paying for his time,
he’d be retired by now. The fabulous Joy Milkowski shared her methodolo-
gies with me and helped me rewrite the chapter about creating compelling
ads. The friendship we developed during this project has been an added
bonus. Don Crowther, one of the cleverest and under-the-radar marketers on
this or any other planet, shared more cool ideas with me than I could ever
have hoped.
Bryan Todd and I have argued and philosophized about metrics more than
either of us cares to admit. Kelly Muldoon shared her experience with geo-
graphic targeting, and always has the right amount of sympathy and choco-
late for any situation. Michael Katz, the world’s expert on e-newsletters, was
so helpful during this project that I almost forgive him for being funnier than
me. Thanks also to my many clients who shared case studies with me —
sorry about all the ones I couldn’t use.
Rob Goyette, Steve Goyette, and Erik Wickstrom were never more than a cell-
phone call away whenever I had a question about PHP, HTML, or the MLB
MVP. Working with these talented programmers and marketers is like having
three genie-filled lamps.
Ken McCarthy is, quite simply, the source. He understood the potential of the
Internet long before the dotcom craze, and he has been quietly creating busi-
ness leaders and success stories for over 14 years. The combination of mas-
terful teacher and brilliant business strategist is a rare one; throw in loyal
friend and passionate righter of wrongs and you have Ken.
Brad Hill believed in me enough to get this whole adventure in motion, and
he has encouraged me to become the writer my elementary school teachers
always said I’d become. Danny Warshay has been a business and life mentor
since we met as roommates in Jerusalem in 1986. And Peter Bregman gave me
my introduction to the business world when I was a naïve, befuddled PhD
freshly minted from grad school. He always encouraged me to ask questions,
no matter how stupid, and except for that time when I asked the HR Director
from American Express what exactly she meant by “P&L,” it all worked out.
Without Peter’s guidance and wicked humor, my life would be unimaginably
less rich.

two years, you’re not going to stay in business. The age of the Yellow Pages is
coming to an end, and online advertising — led by AdWords — is taking over.
For those who take the time to master this new advertising medium, it’s an
exciting time. AdWords represents a revolution in the advertising world. For
the first time ever, businesses large and small can show their ads to qualified
prospects anywhere in the world, when those prospects are hungriest for
their products and services. AdWords allows fine geographic targeting, like a
Yellow Pages ad, but (unlike the Yellow Pages) also allows advertisers to edit,
pause, or delete their Google ads any time they like, in real time.
Unlike a traditional advertisement, Google ads cost money only when they
are clicked — that is, when a live prospect clicks the ad to visit your site. And
perhaps most important, AdWords enables advertisers to test multiple ads
simultaneously and to track the return on investment of every ad and every
keyword they employ.
Since a click can cost as little as a penny and each click can be tracked to a
business outcome, even small, cash-strapped businesses can find AdWords
an effective way to grow without betting the farm on untested marketing mes-
sages. Google’s ads reach across the entire Internet; in addition to the 200
million Google searches per day (almost 60% of all Internet searches), Google
provides search results for AOL, Earthlink, Netscape, and other big Internet
service providers. And through its AdSense program, Google’s ads appear on
sites all across the Internet — in thousands of newspaper Web sites and hun-
dreds of thousands of blogs, as well as on Gmail pages.
Yet few small businesses have ever advertised through AdWords. The pay-
per-click technology, combined with the unfamiliar form of direct-response
marketing, has so far kept most small businesses away from the potential
benefits of AdWords. If few businesses are using it, even fewer are using it
wisely. Marketing executives at large companies have been slow to embrace
the direct-response model, having been trained in brand advertising that has
little place in a results-accountable medium like AdWords.

About This Book
I’ve consulted with hundreds of AdWords clients over the past several years,
working with everyone from complete beginners who didn’t know how to 
set up their account to power users spending over a million dollars a month
in clicks. Nothing in this book is theoretical — every concept and strategy
has been tested under fire in some of the most competitive markets on Earth.
When you play the AdWords game, you don’t have much room to spin failure
into success. You either make money or lose money, and the numbers tell the
story.
This book strives to explain clearly, in layperson’s terms, the AdWords
mechanics and best practices for businesses large and small. You will dis-
cover how to build smart and elegant campaigns based on an understanding
of the direct-marketing principles.
This book isn’t meant to be read from front to back. (I didn’t even write it
from front to back.) It’s more like a reference. Each chapter is divided into
sections, so you can jump in anywhere and find out how to accomplish a spe-
cific AdWords task.
You don’t have to remember anything in this book. Nothing is worth memo-
rizing, except the mantra, “Thank you, Howie.” The information here is what
you need to know to create and manage successful AdWords campaigns —
and nothing more. And wherever I mention a new term, I explain it in plain
English. When the movie comes out (I’m thinking Kevin Spacey plays me,
although Daniel Day Lewis would also be a good choice), these explanations
will be in bold subtitles. I rarely get geeky on you, because AdWords is by and
large a user-friendly interface. Occasionally I do show off by explaining a
technical phrase — feel free to skip those sections unless you’re preparing
for a big game of Trivial Pursuit — Cyber Edition.
Conventions Used in This Book
I know that doing something the same way over and over again can be boring
(the opening credits of The Brady Bunch comes to mind), but sometimes con-
sistency can be a good thing. For one thing, it makes stuff easier to under-
stand. In this book, those consistent elements are conventions. In fact, I use
italics to identify and define the new terms.
Whenever you have to type something, I put the stuff you need to type in
bold type so it’s easy to see.

AdWords For Dummies 

When I type URLs (Web addresses) within a paragraph, for the rare snippets
of code I show you, and for keywords, I use a monospace font that looks like
this: www.dummies.com.
What You Don’t Have to Read
This is the hardest part of the book for me, because each word I wrote is my
baby, and they’re all wonderful. Nevertheless, I am contractually obligated to
let you off the hook at least a little, so here goes.
You can skip all the paragraphs marked with the Technical Stuff icon. I just
put that in because I like the icon, and to give you confidence that I know
what I’m talking about. The sidebars aren’t crucial to the plot either, although
many of them feature tips and examples from very sharp AdWords users.
If you already have an AdWords account, you can actually skip Chapters 2
and 3, which show you how to set up Starter and Standard Edition accounts,
respectively. I discuss the principles behind the settings in these chapters, so
if your account is running on the Google default settings, you may want to
skim these chapters just to avoid some classic beginners’ mistakes.
Foolish Assumptions
As I gaze into my polycarbonate ball (crystal balls are breakable, and I can be
clumsy), I see you as clearly as if you were sitting here with me in this hotel
lobby in Wisconsin at 5:30 in the morning. You have a barely noticeable scar
just above your right elbow where you cut yourself against a pool wall when
you were eleven, and you are wearing a plaid watch band.
The foolish assumptions that informed my writing include the guess that the
main market for your ads reads and speaks English. If not, no big deal: Just
substitute Spanish or Russian or Azerbaijani for English as you read
(although the reference to Azerbaijani muffins may confuse you).
I’m also assuming that your AdWords goal is business-related, especially in
the way I talk about the desired outcomes of your campaigns — that is, leads,
sales, profits, and so on. If you’re advertising on behalf of a nonprofit, you can
easily substitute your own desired outcomes, including signatures on an online
petition, additions to your mailing list, or attendance at an event. Your out-
comes can be nonmeasurable as well, such as convincing Web-site visitors 
3
Introduction

to reduce their energy consumption, support a political candidate or posi-
tion, eat healthier food, and so on.
I make several foolish assumptions about your level of computer savvy. I
assume you can make your way around a Web site, including clicking, typing
in Web addresses, completing forms, and so on. I assume you have access to
a working credit card (no, you can’t borrow mine) so you can sign up and pay
for AdWords.
I don’t assume that you’re using a PC or a Mac. You can benefit from this
book whatever computer platform you use: Mac, PC, Linux, Hairball (all right,
I made that last one up). Some third-party software works on Windows PCs
only, but you can accomplish 99% of the tasks in this book using just a Web
browser and text editor.
I also assume you can get Web pages created. You don’t have to create them
yourself, but either through your efforts or someone else’s, you can design,
upload, name, and edit simple HTML Web pages.
How This Book Is Organized
I sent my editor an unabridged dictionary and told her all the words from the
book are in it, and she could decide which ones go where (that’s her job,
after all). It turns out I was wrong: Google wasn’t even in the dictionary (the
one I got for my college graduation in 1987), so it was back to the drawing
board.
On my next try, I divided this book into parts, which I organized by topic.
Google AdWords is the big topic, but much of the book focuses on what you
have to do before and after AdWords in order to be successful. You don’t
have to read it in order. In fact, every time I wrote “as you saw in Chapter 4,”
my editor sent a slight electric shock through the Internet into my keyboard.
So start anywhere you like, and go anywhere you like. If you’re looking for
information on a specific AdWords topic, check the headings in the table of
contents, or skim the Table of Contents.
By design, this book enables you to get as much (or as little) information as
you need at any particular moment. Having gotten through college English by
reading the jacket blurbs of great novels (this was before Google appeared in
the dictionary), I understand the value of strategic skimming. By design,
AdWords For Dummies is a reference that you reach for again and again when-
ever you encounter a new situation or need a fresh poke of inspiration.

AdWords For Dummies 

Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser
Before you drive your AdWords vehicle to success, let’s get you pointed in
the right direction. Forget everything you learned about marketing in busi-
ness school, and understand that AdWords is fundamentally a direct-market-
ing medium. You’ll discover what that means, and how it differs from the
brand advertising that we see all around us, and how to play the direct-mar-
keting game to win.
Once you’re oriented and pointed toward success, I show you how to start
your engine — first with training wheels if you wish (with the simple Starter
Edition), then with the full-featured and powerful Standard Edition.
Part II: Launching Your 
AdWords Campaign
The two bricks of your AdWords campaign (to switch metaphors abruptly)
are keywords and ads. Before you activate your first campaign, I introduce
you to the single most important element of AdWords (actually, of just about
all online marketing): choosing the right keywords. I show you how to do this
through various online research tools and methods, most of which are quick,
free, and easy.
Next you master the ads themselves. Since AdWords is the most competitive
advertising space in existence (slapping your ad in the middle of 20 others
offering more or less the same thing), you must deploy advanced strategies
for creating compelling, action-triggering ads. Otherwise no Web traffic, no
leads, no money. I focus on text ads, since they are the most common and (in
their simplicity) provide the best opportunity to illustrate direct-marketing
principles. I also cover image ads, video ads, and local business ads con-
nected to Google Maps.
Part III: Managing Your 
AdWords Campaigns
Keywords and ads are the bricks. If you hired me to build you a house and I
just dropped a dump truck full of bricks on your empty lot, you wouldn’t be
happy. The chapters in this part give you the blueprints to turn your bricks
into a sound and effective structure, and the tools to build and maintain it.
5
Introduction

You’ll learn how to structure campaigns and ad groups, manage keyword
bids, and target the right traffic.
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink
This is my favorite part of the whole book, the part where my family dragged
me away from my keyboard as I kicked and screamed, “Wait, I haven’t told
them about live chat yet.” Once you’ve set up your campaigns and paid for
visitors to your Web site, you learn how to use lead-generating magnets to
collect contact information from visitors — and to use e-mail to stay in touch
and build a relationship. I also cover Web site strategies to extract maximum
value from each visitor.
Part V: Testing Your Strategies 
and Tracking Your Results
Actually, this is my favorite part of the whole book (okay, my other favorite)
because I show you how to fail your way to success inexpensively, quickly,
and predictably. When you test multiple approaches, one is almost always
better than the other. As long as you keep testing properly and paying atten-
tion to the results, you can’t help but achieve constant incremental (and
sometimes enormous) improvement in your profitability.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Part of my hazing in the For Dummies fraternity included creating top-ten lists
that will, alas, never make their way onto Letterman. They include beginners’
mistakes you want your competitors to make instead of you, and case studies
that bring the principles of the book to life. The Part of Tens is a resource you
can use whenever you’re stuck, except for wedding toasts and term papers
about the causes of World War I.
Be sure to check out www.dummies.com/go/adwords to see this book’s two
bonus chapters as PDF files. These two bonus chapters provide you with top
ten lists of the best AdWords tools available and tips for writing great ads.
Icons Used in This Book
Unfortunately, I could not convince my editor to let me use an icon of a sumo
wrestler wearing a tutu hurtling toward you on ice skates to indicate “this
6
AdWords For Dummies 

paragraph makes absolutely no sense, but you should pay close attention to
it anyway.” So I stuck with the standard For Dummies icons:
Hopefully my tips don’t hurt as much as the one in the icon, but are just as
sharp. I use this bull’s-eye to flag concepts that can cut months from your
AdWords learning curve.
I use this icon to remind you to remove the string that’s cutting off the circu-
lation to your index finger. (What were you thinking?) Also, this icon high-
lights points and items that should be on your AdWords to-do list; little tasks
that can prevent big problems later on.
I’ve heard too many stories of AdWords beginners turning on their cam-
paigns, going to bed, and waking up to $16,000 craters in their credit cards. I
use the bomb icon when a little mistake can have big and nasty conse-
quences.
I’m probably less geeky than you are. I’ve learned enough code writing to be
dangerous (ask my Webmaster, who probably has installed a one-click backup
for my sites by now), but not enough to be useful. So I use this icon only to
impress you with my knowledge of certain geeky terms, and when I share a
snippet of code that your Webmaster can deal with if you don’t want to.
I’ve created a companion Web site to this book at www.askhowie.com. Many
of the processes you’ll implement can be hard to describe on paper, but simple
to show in a video tutorial. (If you’re not sure what I mean, try describing to
someone how to tie their shoes.) I include video footage of my own computer
screen, so you can see and hear exactly how to do what I tell you to. Also, the
Web addresses of articles, resources, and tools change from time to time.
When I suspect that the current URL won’t be valid by the time you read this,
I send you to my site, which will either automatically redirect you to the right
location, or provide an even better resource that wasn’t available when I was
writing the chapter.
Where to Go from Here
I’m thinking that a nice bowl of gazpacho would be nice right about now.
Fresh Roma tomatoes, cilantro, onions, some cumin, and maybe a few chunks
of cucumber, sweet corn and avocado floating on top. Wanna join me?
You can start reading wherever you want, but I’d like to point out a couple of
fundamental chapters that you will want to understand fully before spending
money on AdWords. Chapter 1 gives you the direct-marketing mindset you
need to use AdWords effectively, while Chapter 4 guides you to a deep under-
standing of your market. Skim Chapters 10 and 11 before turning on the traf-
fic to your Web site.
7
Introduction

Once you have the lay of the land, you may want to implement the tracking
described in Chapter 14 as soon as you’ve set up a Standard Edition account
(explained in Chapter 3). Knowing the profitability of each element of your
AdWords campaign makes everything easier and more fun.
The companion Web site www.askhowie.com is a good place to go for more
information, detailed video tutorials, updates, and an e-mail newsletter on
AdWords tips and strategies. If you encounter something online that is differ-
ent from the book, check the Web site section devoted to that chapter for an
update.
If you’re aching to tell me how much you love this book and how you’d like 
to fly me, first-class, to Cape Town, Fiji, or Maui to teach a workshop, give a
keynote, or just enjoy a well-deserved vacation, feel free to e-mail me at

Google Advertiser

In this part . . .
T
his part introduces Google AdWords and shows you
how to get started. While almost everyone is familiar
with the Google search engine, few people understand
how easy it is to pay to display your ad listing on the cov-
eted first page of search results — and how challenging it
can be to do so profitably.
Chapter 1 discusses online search as a revolution in
advertising and reveals the marketing-mindset shifts
required for success. You’ll discover how to get into your
customers’ minds and see through their eyes, so your
advertising will be customer-centric and effective.
Chapters 2 and 3 take you through the mechanics of 
creating — and immediately pausing — a single campaign.
(Patience, grasshopper.) Chapter 2 begins with the Starter
Edition. (The Starter Edition was recently released, and it
gives you a much simpler, though less powerful, way to
use AdWords. It’s a good way for the hyper-nervous to
begin.) Chapter 3 goes step-by-step through creating an
account with the Standard Edition. These chapters pro-
vide the foundation upon which your AdWords success is
built — customized campaigns whose settings support
the achievement of your goals.

H
ave you ever bought an ad in the Yellow Pages? I remember my first
time — I was terrified. I didn’t know what to write. I didn’t know how
big an ad to buy. I wasn’t sure which phonebooks to advertise in. I had no
idea what headings to list under. I had to pay thousands of dollars for an ad I
wouldn’t be able to change for the next 12 months. And I had recurring night-
mares that I mistyped the phone number and some baffled florist in
Poughkeepsie got thousands of calls from my customers.
Why am I telling you this? (Aside from the fact that my therapist encourages
me to release negative emotions?) Because I want you to appreciate the sig-
nificance of Google AdWords as a revolution in advertising.
You can set up an AdWords account in about five minutes for five dollars. Your
ads can be seen by thousands of people searching specifically for what you’ve
got, and you don’t pay a cent until a searcher clicks your ad to visit your Web
site. You can change your ad copy any time you want. You can cancel unprof-
itable ads with the click of a mouse. You can run multiple ads simultaneously
and figure out to the penny which ad makes you the most money.
You can even send customers to specific aisles and shelves of your store,
depending on what they’re searching for. And you can get smarter and smarter
over time, writing better ads, showing under more appropriate headings,
choosing certain geographic markets and avoiding others. When your ads do
well, you can even get Google to serve them as online newspaper and maga-
zine ads, put them next to Google Maps locations, and broadcast them to cell
phones — automatically.

AdWords gives you the ability to conduct hundreds of thousands of dollars of
market research for less than the cost of a one-way ticket from Chapel Hill to
Madison. And in less time than it takes me to do five one-arm pushups (okay,
so that’s not saying much).
AdWords can help you test and improve your Web site and e-mail strategy to
squeeze additional profits out of every step in your sales process. It can pro-
vide a steady stream of qualified leads for predictable costs. One recent best-
seller by Timothy Ferriss, The Four Hour Work Week: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere,
and Join the New Rich (Crown Publishers), teaches a very achievable AdWords-
based system for becoming financially independent in just a few months.
But AdWords can also be a huge sinkhole of cash for the advertiser who
doesn’t understand it. I’ve written this book to arm you with the mindsets,
strategies, and tactics to keep you from ever becoming an AdWords victim.
Introducing AdWords
The Google search engine, found at www.google.com, processes hundreds of
millions of searches per day. Every one of those searches represents a human
being trying to solve a problem or satisfy an itch through finding the right
information on the World Wide Web. The AdWords program allows advertisers
to purchase text and links on the Google results page (the page the searcher
sees after entering a word or phrase and clicking the Google Search button.
You pay for the ad only when someone clicks it and visits your Web site. The
amount you pay for each visitor can be as low as one penny, or as high as
$80, depending on the quality of your ad, your Web site, and the competitive-
ness of the market defined by the word or phase (known as a keyword even
though it may be several words long) typed by the visitor.
Each text ad on the results page consists of four lines and up to 130 charac-
ters (see Figure 1-1 for an example ad):
 Line 1: Blue underlined hyperlinked headline of up to 25 characters
 Line 2: Description line 1 of up to 35 characters
 Line 3: Description line 2 of up to 35 characters
 Line 4: Green display URL (URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator,
the way the Internet assigns addresses to Web sites) of up to 35 
characters
12
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

The fourth line, the display URL, can differ from the Web page your visitor
actually lands on. I cover this in detail in Chapter 6.
Where and When the Ads Show
You can choose to show your ads to the entire world, or limit their exposure
by country, region, state, and even city. You can (for example) let them run
24/7 or turn them off nights and weekends. You also get to choose from
AdWords’ three tiers of exposure, described in the following sections.
Google results
When someone searches for a particular keyword, your ad displays on the
Google results page if you have selected that keyword (or a close variation)
as a trigger for your ad. For the ad shown in Figure 1-1, if someone enters
kids asthma prevention in Google, they can view the ad somewhere on
the top or right of the results page (see Figure 1-2).
Search partners results
Your ads can also show on Google’s search partners’ network. Companies
such as AOL and Earthlink incorporate Google’s results into their own search
pages, as in Figure 1-3.

 Earthlink: www.earthlink.net
 Netscape Netcenter: www.netscape.com
 Shopping.com: www.shopping.com
AdSense sites and Gmail
Additionally, hundreds of thousands of Web sites show AdWords ads on their
pages as part of the AdSense program, which allows Web site owners to get
paid by showing AdWords ads on their sites. (See Figure 1-4 for an example.)
Think of an online version of a newspaper or magazine, with ads next to the
editorial content. The content of the page determines which ads get shown.
On sites devoted to weightlifting, for example, Google shows ads for workout
programs and muscle-building supplements, rather than knitting and quilting
supplies. Google lets you choose whether to “syndicate” your ads on these
“syndication” networks.
While anyone with a Web site can use the AdSense program, Google has a
special relationship with some of the most popular content sites on the Web,
including
 About: www.about.com
 business.com: www.business.com
 Food Network: www.foodnetwork.com
 HGTV: www.hgtv.com
 HowStuffWorks: www.howstuffworks.com
 InfoSpace: www.infospace.com

Gmail is Google’s Web-mail service. It displays AdWords results to the right of
the e-mails you receive. If you choose to syndicate your ads, your prospects
who use Gmail may see them if the text of the e-mail is deemed relevant to
your offer. For example, Figure 1-5 shows an e-mail that I (almost) sent to the
MacArthur Foundation, humbly explaining why I should receive one of their
“genius grants.” To the right, you can see ads for small business grants, a
Cow Ringtone, triggered by my mention of a self-esteem program for cows,
and two resources for college grant-seekers.
AdWords in the Total Google Context
Google rose from nothing to become the world’s most popular search engine
in just a few months because it did one thing faster and better than all the rest:
help Internet searchers find what they were looking for. I don’t want to over-
load you with the details of Google’s search algorithm (especially since it’s a
such a secret that if I told you, I’d have to kill you, as well as the fact that I
would have to understand words like eigenvector and stochastic in order to
explain it), but you will become a better Google advertiser when you get the
basic principles. The most important word in Google’s universe is relevance.
Figure 1-4:
AdWords
ads on a
Web page.
16
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

When you type a word or phrase into Google, the search engine asks the
World Wide Web for the best page to show you. The big innovations Google
uses are a couple of calculations: One, called PageRank, is basically a mea-
sure of the popularity of a particular page, based on how many other Web
pages link to that page and how popular those pages are. (Sort of like high
school — the definition of a popular kid is one who is friends with other popu-
lar kids.) The other calculation is known as Page Reputation, which answers
the question, “Okay, this page may be popular, but for which topic?” The
Page Reputation of a Web page determines whether it will appear in a given
search; the PageRank determines whether it will be the first listing, the third,
or the four million and eleventh.
The entire Google empire is based on this ability to match the right Web
pages, in the right priority order, with a given search phrase. The day Google
starts showing irrelevant results is the day after you should have sold all your
Google stock.
When Google started, it only showed the results of its own calculations.
These results are known as organic listings. Organic listings appear on the left
side of the Google results page (see Figure 1-6, which includes organic listings
only, and no AdWords entries).

Chapter 1: Profiting from the Pay-Per-Click Revolution

In the early days of AdWords, your ad was shown based on a combination of
two numbers: your bid price, or how much you were willing to pay for a click
(that is, someone clicking your ad and visiting your Web page), and a very
important metric called Click-Through Rate (CTR): the percentage of
searchers who clicked your ad after seeing it. Now, Google also takes into
account the quality of the fit between the ad and your Web site. If searchers
exit your site so fast they leave skid marks, Google figures that they didn’t
find what they were looking for, and you get penalized for irrelevance.
Pay Per Click: Your Online 
Gumball Machine
AdWords is a PPC (Pay Per Click) advertising medium. Unlike other forms of
advertising, with PPC you pay only for results: live visitors to your Web site.
AdWords allows you as the advertiser to decide how much you’re willing to
pay for a visitor searching on a given keyword. For example, if you sell vin-
tage sports trading cards, you can bid more for Babe Ruth rookie card
than John Gochnaur card if you can make more money selling the Babe
Ruth card.

Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

For many businesses, advertising is like a slot machine: You put in your
money, pull the handle, and see what happens. Sometimes you do well; some-
times you don’t. Either way, you don’t learn much that will help you predict
the results of your next pull. PPC has changed all that for businesses with the
patience and discipline to track online metrics. Just as a gumball machine
reliably gives you a gumball every time you drop a quarter, PPC can reliably
deliver a customer to your Web site for a predictable amount of money. Once
you run your numbers (explained in Part V), you know exactly how much, on
average, a visitor is worth from a particular keyword. You may find that you
make $70 in profit for every 100 visitors from AdWords who searched for
19
Chapter 1: Profiting from the Pay-Per-Click Revolution
A really short history lesson
The first Pay Per Click (PPC) search engine,
goto.com (whose name changed to Overture
and now is known as Yahoo Search Marketing),
ran on a straight auction basis. Whoever
wanted to show an ad in the top position simply
bid more per click than everyone else for a
given keyword. Google rose to preeminence in
the PPC world because it figured out that letting
badly written, unappealing ads rise to the top
just because an advertiser was willing to spend
a lot of cash was bad for everyone. Bad for the
search engine, because the search engine
doesn’t get paid unless a Web visitor likes the
ad enough to click it. Bad for the advertiser,
because unappealing ads usually come from
the same lazy or confused thinking that pro-
duces unappealing and unprofitable Web sites.
And most important, bad for the search-engine
user, who was now getting unappealing and
irrelevant listings muddying the results page,
and would therefore start searching for a better
search engine.
AdWords elegantly solved this problem by
rewarding advertisers whose ads were popular
with searchers. If your ad was twice as popular
as a competitor’s (meaning it got clicked twice
as often), your cost per click (the amount of
money you paid Google when a searcher
clicked your ad and visited your Web site) was
half what your competitor was paying for the
same position on the page.
For example, suppose you and your competitor
both bid $1.00 on the keyword elephant
ride, and 1000 people see each ad. Forty
people click your ad, and 20 people click your
competitor’s. Your ad would appear above your
competitor’s for a cost per click of around $0.51
— if it’s twice as popular, it costs half as much.
Highly relevant and compelling ads rose to the
top of the page, while unappealing ads faded
away as they proved unprofitable. Google also
began AdWords with a cutoff on CTR: If your ad
couldn’t compel at least 5 out of the first 1000
viewers to click it, Google would disable it and
make you rewrite it before it could be shown

Over the years, Google has been tweaking the
AdWords program to provide more and more
relevant search results to its users. This book
contains the very latest updates as I write, but
please realize that Google never stops moving.
While it’s impossible to predict the exact
changes Google will implement, you can be
sure that it’s always moving in the direction of
greater relevance for its users. If your ads and
Web pages always provide real value to real
people, and don’t exist just to “game” the
AdWords machine, you’re probably going to be
just fine no matter what Google dreams up next.

each click from this keyword and still break even or better on the first sale.
The Direct-Marketing Difference: Getting
Your Prospects to Do Something
Direct marketing differs from “brand” marketing, the kind we’re used to on
TV and radio and newspapers, in several important ways. AdWords repre-
sents direct marketing at its purest, so it’s important to forget everything you
thought you knew about advertising before throwing money at Google.
Direct marketers set one goal for their ads: to compel a measurable response
in their prospects. Unlike brand marketers, you won’t spend money to give
people warm and fuzzy feelings when they think about your furniture coast-
ers or ringtones or South Carolina resort rentals. Instead, you run your ad to
get hot prospects to your Web site. On the landing page (the first page your
prospect sees after leaving Google), you direct your prospect to take some
other measurable action — fill out a form, call a phone number, initiate a live
chat, drop everything, race to the airport and hop on the first plane to Hilton
Head, and so on.
On the Web, you can track each visitor from the AdWords click through each
intermediate step straight through to the first sale and all subsequent sales.
So at each step of the sales cycle, on each Web page, in each e-mail, with
each ad, you ask your prospect to take a specific action right now.
Brand advertisers rarely have the luxury of asking for immediate action. The
company that advertises home gyms during reruns of Gilligan’s Island has no
illusion that 8,000 viewers are going to TiVO the rest of the episode and drive,
tires squealing, to the nearest fitness store to purchase the GalactiMuscle
5000. They count on repetition to eventually lead to sales.
Contrast that approach with infomercials, which have one goal: to get you to
pick up the phone NOW because they realize that once you get distracted,
they’ve lost their chance of selling to you.
The Internet outdoes the immediacy and convenience of the infomercial by
maintaining the same channel of communication. Instead of jumping from TV to
phone, AdWords and your Web site function together as a seamless information-
gathering experience.

You can measure your results
Because your prospects are either doing what you want them to do or not,
you can measure the effectiveness of each call to action. For example, let’s
say you sell juggling equipment to left-handed people. You show your ad to
30,000 people in one week. Your ad attracts 450 prospects to your Web site,
at an average CPC of $0.40. Your landing page offers a 5% off coupon in
exchange for a valid e-mail address, and by the end of the week your mailing
list has 90 leads — 20% of all visitors. You follow up with an e-mail offer that
compels 10 sales totaling $600.00.
The following table shows an example of an AdWords ad campaign’s overall
metrics.

What does this horrific flashback to SAT prep mean to your business? These
numbers give you control over your advertising spending, allow you to pre-
dict cash flow (just play a game of Monopoly with my daughter if you don’t
appreciate the value of positive cash flow!), and enable you to assess addi-
tional market opportunities by comparing them to this pipeline. (If you’re not
rubbing your hands together and going, “Muahahaha” like a cartoon villain, I
still have some explaining to do.)
In this hypothetical case, you have found a gumball machine that gives you
$1.33 every time you drop 40 cents into the machine. You’ve set it up once,
21
Chapter 1: Profiting from the Pay-Per-Click Revolution

and it happens automatically as long as Google likes your credit card. ROI is a
metric that simply converts your input amount to a single dollar, so you can
easily compare ROI for different campaigns and markets. ROI answers the
question, if you put a dollar into this machine, how much comes out? ROI of
333% means that you get $3.33 out for every dollar you put it. If you found a
gumball machine that managed that trick, you’d never go back to slot
machines again.
Now suppose the market becomes more competitive, and your CPC rises. If
you were advertising in your local newspaper and the ad rep told you that
prices were going up by 25%, what would you do? Would you keep advertis-
ing at the same level, or cut back, or stop showing your ads in that paper
completely? Unless you’re measuring the ROI of your ads, you have no way to
make a rational decision.
Say your AdWords CPC from the example shown in the preceding table
increases by 25%. Now your cost per visitor is 50 cents. Do you keep adver-
tising? Of course — you’re still paying less for a lead than the value of that
lead — 83 cents less. Your ROI is down from 333%, to a still respectable 267%
(total advertising cost is now 450 × $0.50 = $225, and $600 ÷ $225 = 267%).
But wait — there’s more! (Did I mention how much I enjoy a good infomercial?)
AdWords makes it simple not only to see your metrics, but also to improve
your profitability by conducting tests. The ability to test different elements of
your sales process is the next important element of direct marketing.
Keep improving your marketing
So far in this chapter, I’ve only discussed inputs (how much you pay to adver-
tise and how many Web site visitors) and outputs (how much you receive in
sales). But it’s really the intermediate metrics (called throughputs by people
like me who sometimes find it useful to pretend we went to business school)
that give us an opportunity to make huge improvements in our profitability.
For example, imagine you improve the CTR of your ad from 1.5% to 2.2% with-
out lowering the quality of your leads. Big whoop, right? An improvement of
0.7% — who cares? Actually, it’s an improvement of 68% — for the same $180
advertising spend, you now get 660 visitors instead of 450. If everything else
stays the same, your visitor value of $1.33 means your sales increase to $880,
for an ROI of 489%.
But wait — there’s more! What’s to stop you from improving your landing
page by 20% by testing different versions? Instead of getting 20 leads out of
100, you’re now collecting 24. Six hundred sixty visitors now translate into
22
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

158 leads. If 11% of them make a purchase from your e-mail offer, that’s 17
sales. At an average of $60 per sale, you’ve now made $1020.
But wait — there’s more! How about testing your e-mail offer too? Let’s say
you get a 36% improvement, and now 15% of e-mail recipients make a $60 pur-
chase. That’s 23 sales at $60, for a new total of $1380.
Thanks to the miracle of compounding, the three improvements (68% × 20% ×
36%) give you a total improvement of 230%. This isn’t pie-in-the-sky math
either — when you test the elements of your sales process scientifically, it’s
hard not to make significant improvements. See Chapter 13 for the stunningly
simple explanation of how to do it.
It’s dating, not a shotgun wedding
In case you got a little lost in the numbers in the previous section, I want to
make sure you got the moral of that direct marketing story: It’s a process of
multiple steps. Seth Godin (marketing guru and author) compares direct mar-
keting to dating. You wouldn’t walk up to a stranger in a museum and pro-
pose marriage. (If you did, and you’re happily married 17 years later, please
don’t take offense; I’m not talking about you.) In fact, there are a lot of things
you wouldn’t suggest to a stranger in a museum that you might very well sug-
gest to someone who knew you a little better. (If you’re not sure what these
are, check out Dr. Ruth’s contribution to the For Dummies series.)
Direct marketing operates on the premise that you have to earn your prospects’
trust before they become your customers. As with dating, you demonstrate
your trustworthiness and likeability by asking for small commitments with
low-downside risk. Your ad, the first step in the AdWords dating game, makes
a promise of some sort while posing no risk. Your visitor can click away from
your Web site with no hassle or hard feelings. AdWords’ Editorial Guidelines
commit you to playing nice on your landing page: an accurate display URL,
no pop-ups, and a working Back button so your visitors can hightail it back to
their search results if they don’t like your site.
Your landing page makes a second offer that involves getting permission from
your prospects to communicate with them in the future. Here’s the deal you’re
offering: “I’ll give you something of value if you let me contact you in the future.
And any time you want me to stop contacting you, just let me know and I’ll
stop. And I’ll never share your contact information with anybody else who
might try to contact you.”
Sometimes you can go right for the sale on the landing page, and sometimes
it’s better to focus on turning your visitor into a lead — someone with whom
23
Chapter 1: Profiting from the Pay-Per-Click Revolution

you can follow up later. Chapter 10 offers guidelines for creating an effective
landing page.
As your prospect gets to know you and trust you, you increase the value you
provide while asking for larger and larger commitments. Depending on your
business, your sales/dating process could consist of surveys, reports, free
samples, try-before-you-buy promotions, teleseminars, e-mails, live chat, soft-
ware downloads, and more. When you ask for the sale you are, in effect,
proposing marriage — or a long-term relationship, anyway.
Following up with your best prospects
Direct marketing focuses on prospects — people who raise their hands and
tell you they’re interested in what you’ve got. When someone clicks your
AdWords ad, they’ve just identified themselves to you as someone worth
developing a relationship with. Returning to the dating analogy, this is like a
stranger smiling at you at the museum. You respond by striking up a conver-
sation about the artwork you’re both looking at (“Do you think the green
splotch in the upper-left-hand corner represents a rebirth of hope or an
exploding drummer?”) If the two of you hit it off, you don’t want to leave the
building without getting a phone number.
In dating, the phone number is the litmus test of interest. If you can’t get the
phone number, or if you call it and discover you’ve really been given the
number for the West Orange Morgue (now why are you assuming that actu-
ally happened to me?), you know that relationship has no future.
Your prospect has the online attention span of a guppy. When we go online,
we typically multitask, we have multiple windows open, we’re checking e-mail,
IMing, watching videos, listening to MP3s, and searching and browsing and
surfing. Not to mention answering the phone, opening the mail, eating and
drinking, and dealing with other people. How many times have you visited a
Web page, gotten distracted, and never found it again? How many times have
you bookmarked a Web page, intending to visit again, and haven’t gotten
around to it?
Get the prospect’s e-mail address as soon as you can. Before they get dis-
tracted. Before they browse back to Google and click one of your competi-
tors’ ads. Before they spill a cappuccino latte all over the keyboard.
With their e-mail address and permission to follow up, you’ve done all you
can to inoculate yourself from the short Internet attention span. You now
have a chance of continuing the conversation until it leads to a sale.

How to Think Like Your Prospect
I began this chapter with a pathetic rant about my experiences as a Yellow
Pages advertiser. Now let’s look at the Yellow Pages from the point of view of
the user — the person searching for a solution to a problem. But I’m done
whining, so I’m not going to complain about figuring out which heading to
look under, deciding which listing to call, dealing with voice mail (no, really,
I’m done whining). Instead, imagine a totally new experience: the Magic
Yellow Pages.
In the Magic Yellow Pages, you don’t have to flip through hundreds of pages.
In fact, the book doesn’t have any pages — just a blank cover. You write down
what you’re looking for on the cover, and then — Poof! — the listings appear.
The most relevant listings, according to the Magic Yellow Pages, appear on
the cover. Subsequent pages contain more listings, in order of decreasing 
relevance.
But wait — there’s more! The listings in the Magic Yellow Pages don’t have
phone numbers. Instead, touch the listing and you’re magically transported
to the business itself. Don’t like what you see? Snap your fingers and you’re
back in front of the Magic Yellow Pages, ready to touch another listing or type
another query.
This is how AdWords functions from the point of view of your prospects:
They have all the power. They conjure entire shopping centers full of compet-
ing shops by typing words — and they window-shop until they find what they
want or give up.
Their search term represents an itch that they want to scratch at that very
moment — some unsolved problem. They are looking for the shortest dis-
tance between their itch and a good scratch. Maybe they want information.
Maybe they want a product. Maybe they want to be entertained. Maybe they
want to be told that their problem isn’t so bad.
It’s your job to figure out what they really want, based on the keyword they
type, and give it to them quicker and more obviously than your competitors.
In the Magic Yellow Pages, the rules are, “Give the prospect what she wants
and nobody gets hurt.” Winning the game of AdWords comes down to figur-
ing out what your prospect — the person you can help — is thinking and feel-
ing as they type their search. When you understand this, you bid on the right
keywords, you show compelling ads, and you present clear and irresistible
offers on your Web site. See Chapter 4 to discover how to conduct quick and
easy keyword research, so you can become the champion itch-scratcher in
your market.

Setting Up Your Starter 
Edition Account
In This Chapter
 Who should start with the Starter Edition
 Letting Google be your Web site
 Linking to your own Web site
 Finding your way around the Control Panel
 Activating and managing your account
 Moving on up to the Standard Edition
I
n late 2006 Google figured out that the standard AdWords interface was
freaking some people out: lots of steps, too many choices, and not enough
guidance before the machine started cranking and costing them money. In its
wisdom, Google created a Starter Edition that eliminates all but the most
basic steps and decisions.
In this chapter, I describe the limited functionality of the Starter Edition to
help you figure out if you should start slow or jump into the Standard Edition
right off the bat. If you decide to skip to Standard, you can skip the rest of
this chapter (no refunds, though).
I take you through the signup process and show you how to proceed if you
have your own Web site, and even if you don’t. (I told you this was the Starter
Edition!) I’ll take you on a guided tour of the Starter Edition Control Panel 
(if you want, you can hang a tape recorder around your neck and wear sun-
glasses and a Hawaiian shirt to enhance authenticity), and then show you
how to manage and — when you’re good and ready — activate your account.
Finally, I help you decide when to take the plunge into the Standard Edition,
so you can continue to read and benefit from this riveting book.

Who Should Start with 
the Starter Edition
When I was a boy, there was no Starter Edition and we walked 10 miles to
school uphill through broken glass every day. We toughed it out, and it made
us stronger — or not. But those days are over. Now you have a choice.
The Starter Edition is just that — a place to start out. It has quite a few limita-
tions when compared to the Standard Edition (see Chapter 3 if you want to
jump right in with the Standard Edition).
The Starter Edition is a good place to start advertising with AdWords if
 You only sell one product and have one Web page: The Starter Edition
is for advertisers who want to send all their traffic to a single Web page
and can target an entire country. If you have more than one product (for
example, clown noses in both red and blue), or more than one sales
funnel (for example, you sell red noses to clowns and politicians), the
Starter Edition will be too limited.
 You want to sell your product in just one region: If you want to adver-
tise to multiple geographic regions, you must start with the Standard
Edition. If you can begin by showing your ads to one region only, the
Starter Edition is fine. With the Starter Edition you can target as follows:
• Entire Country (for example, United States)
• Entire State (for example, North Carolina)
• Metropolitan Area (for example, Raleigh-Durham-Fayetteville)
• City (for example, Durham)
If you need to show different ads to Durham and Chapel Hill, you’ll need
the Standard Edition. (Having lived in this college-basketball-worship-
ping part of the country for two years, I don’t recommend trying to sell
Duke Blue Devil sweatshirts to UNC Tarheel fans, even if the two cam-
puses are only 7 miles apart.)
 You don’t want to sift through complex reporting: Choose the Starter
Edition if you aren’t ready to look at the really interesting numbers, like
cost per lead and return on investment. The only metrics you’ll have to
deal with in the Starter Edition are how many people saw your ad, how
many clicked it, and how much you paid Google for the privilege. If you
want to find out how much money each of your ads and keywords makes
for you, you need the Standard Edition.
In order to use the advanced conversion tracking (meaning, how many of
your visitors did what you want them to do), you’ll need a way to put
HTML code on your Web site. If you don’t know how to do that yourself
28
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

or have access to a Webmaster, these advanced features will be unavail-
able to you in any case.
 You want to use text ads only: With the Starter Edition, you show only
plain vanilla text ads (no pretty pictures, video, cell phone ads, or danc-
ing monkeys). Most advertisers find that text ads are the bread and
butter of their online advertising, so this may not be a big deal for you.
Even if you plan to make graphical and video ads eventually, I strongly
recommend you start with the text ads to get your message right —
before you jump into expensive and slow-to-change media such as art
and video.
 You want simple keyword bidding: The Starter Edition does not allow
you to bid higher for some keywords than others. If you want precise
control of your spending on each keyword, you need the Standard
Edition.
 You don’t need to choose specific Web sites to show your ads: With the
Starter Edition, you can’t show your ads on Web sites that belong to
Google’s Content Syndication (AdSense) network. If you sell something
that people aren’t actively searching for and will only stumble upon acci-
dentally, you need the Standard Edition.
Of course, you can always begin with one simple campaign and upgrade to
the Standard Edition when you’ve gotten the hang of it.
Signing Up Couldn’t Be Easier
Got 10 minutes, a credit card at least $5 shy of your credit limit, and a con-
nected Web browser? Then you’re ready to play. If you already have a Web
site that you use to sell your product, keep reading. If not, skip to the later
section, “If you don’t have a Web site.”
If you have a Web site
You already have a Web site where you sell your product, and now you’re
interested in advertising with Google’s AdWords. To start out with the Starter
Edition, follow these steps:
1. Point your browser to http://adwords.google.com and click the
Click to Start button, as shown in Figure 2-1.
(The button could also be labeled Begin or Start Now. I’ve gotten all
three — Google appears to be testing which button text works best.)
2. Select the Starter Edition radio button.
3. Select the I Have a Webpage radio button.
29
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Starter Edition Account

4. Skip down to the bottom of the page and click the Continue button.
You are taken to the simplified one-page signup form, consisting of six
sections.
5. In the Location and Language section, enter your region and select a
language preference.
If you are advertising within the United States, you can target the entire
country or type a city name or Zip code in the Search for a City Name or
Postal Code text box and click the Search United States button. Here are
some acceptable formats:
South Orange, NJ
Madison, Wisconsin
27705
Google then provides you with options based on your selection (see
Figure 2-2). Choose the geographic area that most closely matches your
chosen market.
If you select the radio button for Another Language, you’ll get a menu
with about 20 different languages you can choose. For the purposes of
this book, I’m going to assume you’ll stick with English for now, as my
Portuguese is rather rusty. Aprovação?

6. In the Write Your Ad section, enter your landing page.
Enter the URL of the page that your visitor will land on after clicking
your ad. This is the page that will convince them, within seven seconds,
to stay and look around or click away forever. (I talk about landing
pages, with much sagacity and long-windedness, in Chapter 10.)
Unless you really know what you’re doing, don’t change the prefix from
http:// to https://. The s in https:// means the Web site is secure
from an e-commerce standpoint. The data you enter is encrypted, so
online criminals have a hard time charging your card for their new 48-
inch plasma TV screen. You can tell if a site is secure by looking for a
small lock icon at the bottom right of the screen, in the status bar.
There’s almost never a reason to send a visitor to a page that asks for
their credit card right away. Slow down and get to know each other
before going for the wallet.
I once spent hundreds of dollars of Google traffic that I sent to the wrong
page and didn’t realize it for weeks. Make sure the URL is exactly right by
opening another browser window and typing the URL into the address bar.
When your Web page appears, copy the URL in the address bar, switch
back to the Google AdWords page, and paste the URL into the text box.
Figure 2-2:
Geographic

term 27705.
31
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Starter Edition Account

Don’t worry about duplicating the http:// prefix; Google automatically
formats your URL properly.
7. Write your ad copy.
Whoa, Bessie! All of a sudden, out of the blue, Google is asking you to
think! (Don’t you hate when that happens?) Don’t worry — you can just
enter some placeholder text right now. As long as you don’t break
Google’s rules (no profanity, no superlatives, no abbreviations, no drugs
from Canada without Square Trade certification, no unproven claims,
that sort of thing), you can pretty much write whatever you want. So
don’t sweat this. Think of Paul McCartney’s placeholder lyrics when he
began to compose the Beatles’ hit song “Yesterday”: “Scrambled eggs,
oh my baby, how I love your legs.”
You can enter the headline and two lines of text yourself, or click the radio
button in the Give Me Ideas tab and follow the Google Wizard of AdWords.
If you decide to do it yourself, just place your cursor anywhere in the box
and start typing. The existing text will conveniently disappear.
The Google Wizard takes 10 steps — you can skip any of the questions
that don’t make sense to your business. Feel free to accept any of Google’s
suggestions for now — you’ll improve them before any of your prospects
see them.
Google allows you 25 characters in your headline and 35 characters in
your next two lines. (Think Haiku, not Tolstoy.)
8. Choose your keywords.
Enter a single keyword in the text box. Don’t worry about brainstorming.
Just pick the first one that comes to mind to describe what you’re selling.
Google offers a short tutorial here, tantalizingly titled Top secret keyword
tips (which, by the way, is an excellent model for your ad headline). I know
you want to read it — go ahead, it’s quite smart, but there’s no need to
get ahead of yourself. Signing up for an AdWords account is like getting a
Ph.D.: Quality is irrelevant; the only thing that matters is whether you’re
done or not. (Hey, it worked for me. Stop looking at me like that.)
9. Choose your currency.
Choose the currency you use to buy groceries. This is about your
account, not your customers.
10. Set your monthly budget.
Play it safe here and click the radio button next to $30 per month, or
choose an even lower number next to the bottom radio button. You’ll 
set your actual budget when you’ve done more research and are ready
to go live.
If you set a budget lower than Google likes, you’ll receive a pop-up warn-
ing when you complete the form by clicking the Continue button. Ignore
it by choosing OK.
32
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

Your initial advertising budget is entirely for testing. Don’t expect to make
money from your first ads and campaigns. I’m not saying you won’t, but
counting on it is like counting on winning at roulette in Las Vegas to pay
your plane fare home. You are paying for cheap market research.
Once you’ve used AdWords to figure out your market and adjust your
sales process to profitability, you no longer care about limited your
budget. Once you can buy a dollar for 60 cents, you want to make that
deal as many times as Google will let you.
11. Decide how much contact you want with Google.
At the bottom of the page, you’ll see two prechecked boxes offering you
personalized ideas for improving your ad performance and AdWords
newsletters with generic tips. Your inbox, your call. At least Google
doesn’t send you 200 V!@gra offers every hour.
12. Click the Continue button to go to your account.
You’ll land on a page like that shown in Figure 2-3.
13. Set up your AdWords account.
Google wants to know if it knows you already. If you already have an
account for any of the three billion other Google services (like Gmail,
AdSense, Orkut, Google Docs and Spreadsheets, Picasa, and so on), you
can link your AdWords account to the same login. Google will give you
the choice of using your existing account for AdWords, or creating a
brand new one. If this is your first brush with Google’s personalized 
services, or if you want to create a completely new account, Google
gives you that option.

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Starter Edition Account

To use an existing Google account:
a. Select the radio button next to I Have an E-mail Address and
Password I Already Use with Google Services Like AdSense, Gmail,
Orkut, or the Personalized Home Page.
b. Enter your e-mail and password and click the Continue button.
To create a new Google account:
a. Select the radio button next to I Do Not Use These Other Services.
Enter your e-mail, enter your password twice, and type the funny-
looking characters you see in the box to prove you’re not a malicious
or annoying software program. If you are visually impaired and can’t
make out the letters, click the Handicapped icon to the right for an
auditory equivalent. You’ll hear male muttering in the background,
and a female voice reading out some numbers for you to type.
b. Once you’re done, and you’ve carefully examined the Terms of Use
and the Privacy Policy, click the Create Account button.
You’ll be taken to a page like the one shown in Figure 2-4, with instruc-
tions to check your e-mail to verify your account.
14. Verify your account by clicking the link in the e-mail message from
Google AdWords.
Check your inbox for an e-mail from adwords-noreply@google.com
(see Figure 2-5), and click the link that looks like this:
https://www.google.com/accounts/VE?service=
adwords&hl=en-US&c=-465874116307188756527
The bottom of the e-mail contains your AdWords account number, a 
10-digit number that looks something like 123-456-7890. Write this down

somewhere — you’ll need it if you ever need to contact AdWords about
your account.
15. Click the Click Here to Continue button to keep riding this wild
AdWords roller coaster.
You’ll arrive at the very first screen we started at. You may ponder the
philosophical implications of this fact, with a little help from T.S. Eliot:
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.
Or, you can just log in, using the e-mail address and password you cre-
ated. You did write them down and hide them in a safe place, right?
You’ll find a friendly page welcoming you to AdWords. It displays your

vate your ad, or review it.
16. Click the Review Ad First button to enter — drum roll please — your
AdWords Control Panel.
If you don’t have a Web site
Google will help you create a basic “Yellow Pages” Web page for your busi-
ness. You won’t be able to make online sales on this Web page, but you can
provide enough information on the page for your visitors to call you, send
you an e-mail, or visit your actual business location.

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Starter Edition Account

If you run a local business and conduct all transactions in person, this simple
Web site may be all you need for a little while. When you get to the Web page
where you enter your business information, you can click the See a Sample
Page link to check out the Mario Loves Pasta, Inc. page, which gives you an
idea of what your one-page Web site can look like. Note the live e-mail link,
hours of operation, phone numbers, address, and payment accepted. The ziti
look great, don’t they? Sadly, the phone numbers aren’t real. I wonder if
Mario will respond to e-mail?
To set up your Starter Edition account if you don’t already have a Web site,
follow these steps:
1. Point your browser to http://adwords.google.com and click the
Click to Start button (refer to Figure 2-1).
(The button could also be labeled Begin or Start Now. I’ve gotten all
three — Google appears to be testing which button text works best.)
2. Select the Starter Edition radio button.
3. Select the I Don’t Have a Webpage. Help Me Create One radio button,
and then scroll down and click the Continue button.
Google takes you to a page where you enter the information you want on
your business’s AdWords Web page.
4. In the Provide Basic Business Information area, enter your business’s
name, address, phone, and e-mail address in the appropriate text
boxes.
Enter your business name and address in the text boxes. Click the Test
Address link to see if it maps properly. The page refreshes to include a
close-up map of your location. You can choose further down the page to
include this map or not.
Enter the e-mail address and phone number you want Web visitors to
use. If you check the box next to Help Me Count the Calls I Receive FREE,
Google does a very neat thing for you. They assign a phone number to
your Web page that forwards to your actual business line, and they give
you statistics on how many calls your Web site generates. You can
choose a local or toll-free number.
Imagine if the Yellow Pages did that for you! You could stop paying for
ads in the directories that don’t lead to calls, and buy bigger ads in the
books that generate business.
5. Select the check boxes of all the payment methods your business accepts
in the What Forms of Payment Does Your Business Accept? area.
You get a baker’s dozen of choices, including a check box for you to add
other methods Google didn’t include, like Discover, local credit cards,
and “will work for back massages.”
36
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

6. Select whether you want the page to show your business’s operating
hours in the What Are Your Operating Hours at This Location? area.
When you select the I’d Like to Specify Operating Hours radio button,
the page immediately updates to enable you to enter the business hours
for each day of the week. You can input different hours for each day of
the week, close or open your shop with a check in the Closed check box,
and even use military time if you think there’s a danger of some confused
soul showing up at 3:00 am wondering why she can’t buy a leopard-skin
lion tamer’s costume.
If you want to take a lunch break, put a check in the check box that says
Enter Two Sets of Hours for a Single Day, just below the days. Your page
will refresh with double start and end times.
7. Write a few paragraphs about your business in the Describe Your
Business section.
As you write the description, think about three things:
a. What do your prospects need to know to help them make a decision?
b. What differentiates your business from their other choices?
c. What action do you want your Web visitor to take after viewing
this page?
Include details that support your claims, and communicate in a style
that represents how your establishment actually feels to customers. If
you want prospects to physically visit you, give a clear description of
your location, and where to park. Think about how you decide whom 
to call or where to shop. You’re probably looking for the first ad that
answers your burning questions and ends your confusion. Provide that
information to your Web visitors.
8. Include a clear Call to Action in your business description, such as
• E-mail me for today’s specials
• Mention coupon code “405” for a 10% discount on your first order
• Call to find out which water filter is right for you
9. Select a radio button to determine the layout of your Web page in the
Choose a Layout area.
You can choose to include a map, a picture, both, or text only. If you
include a picture, you can upload one from your computer. Click the
Browse button to bring up your computer’s files, and find the picture
you want. It must be in .jpg or .gif format, and can’t be larger than
500k. If you’re not sure what any of this means, find a graphics person 
to help you get the best picture into an appropriate file format.
37
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Starter Edition Account

10. Select a radio button in the Choose a Background Color area.
Your choices include gray, rose, blue, or yellow. You can go back and
change this at any time. Click the Preview My Webpage link to preview the
page you created (note that you’ll need to disable any pop-up blockers).
11. Click the Continue button.
Now you’ll continue creating your ad and the rest of your account, as
described in the earlier section, “If you have a Web site.” The only differ-
ence is, the URL of your ad will begin with http://biz.googlepages.
com and will end with a suffix of your choosing, up to 15 characters.
Touring Your Starter Edition 
Control Panel
When you log in for the first time, Google will show you the ad you created
and the keyword you selected, along with your monthly budget, language and
geographic range of the ad. (See Figure 2-6.)
The alerts at the top
Your new account arrives with an alert at the top of the page, which will
remain until you dismiss it. This first alert is simply an invitation to read
Google’s Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the Starter Edition. Once
your campaign starts running, the alerts are likely to be more relevant: Your
credit card is about to expire, some ads have been disapproved, Google has
changed a policy, things like that. It’s a good idea to dismiss the old alerts,
both to give yourself more room on the screen for campaign management,
and to train yourself to pay attention to them.
The ad
Your ad appears near the top left of the Control Panel, enclosed in a thin rec-
tangle. It looks just as it will look in the Google search results on the right
side of the page.
Testing your ad
Before you do anything else, click your ad and see where Google takes you. 
Is it where you want to send your visitors? Does it reach your home page
instead of a specific landing page? Does it go to Page Not Found? Does it go to
38
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

a different Web site entirely? I’ve seen all these calamities cost advertisers
dearly — this quick check should nip the problem in the bud.
If your ad takes you somewhere you don’t want to go, click the Back button
to return to AdWords; then click the Edit link below the ad to fix the URL.
Editing your ad
To change an existing ad, click the Edit link below the ad. You’ll see the same
screen you used to create the ad in the first place. Make any changes you like
and click Save.
By default, Google displays your root URL only — that is, only up to the .com
or .org or .whatever — in the fourth line of the ad. Use your URL to attract
visitors to your Web site. For example, if you sell red staplers and are adver-
tising on the keyword red stapler, the second URL below would be more
attractive to prospects:
www.StaplerHeaven.com
www.StaplerHeaven.com/Red-Staplers
Change the URL by clicking the Edit link next to the fourth text box (the one
with your Web site name in green) near the bottom of the page. Your display
URL (the one that shows in your ad) doesn’t have to be identical to your land-
ing URL (the page your visitors go after clicking). See Figure 2-7 for an example.

glimpse of

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Starter Edition Account

Writing a second ad
As I will repeat until you’re sick of hearing it, the key to success in Internet
marketing is ongoing split testing. (Split testing is creating two variations [in
this case, of your ad], sending half your traffic to each, and seeing which one
generates a better response.) Not only that, the key to success in Internet
marketing is ongoing split testing. The Starter Edition gives you the ability to
create a second ad to run alongside the first by following these steps:
1. In the Control Panel page, click the Create Another Ad Variation link
below your existing ad.
You’ll get a choice on the next page — whether to create a variation on
your current ad or a brand new ad for a different set of keywords.
2. Click the radio button next to A Variation on My Current Ad.
3. Scroll down to make any changes you want to the existing text, and
click Save.
Google will return you to the campaign Control Panel. You’ll immediately
notice a new tab: Ad Variations. Now you can monitor the difference be-
tween your two ads by counting clicks. One of the ads will probably receive
more clicks than the other. When your ads have accrued enough clicks to
make a statistician happy, you can replace the “losing” ad with another chal-
lenger. For the full sermon on split testing, please turn in your hymnal to
Chapter 13.

The Keywords
The keyword tab allows you to add and delete keywords, and see which ones
are getting impressions and clicks.
Adding keywords
Click the Add More Keywords link, and then add two variations of your existing
keyword. Put one in square brackets and the other in quotes (as in Figure 2-8).
The brackets limit the search to an exact match — only someone who typed
that exact phrase in that exact order, with nothing before or after it, will see the
ad. The quotes limit the search to a phrase match — that exact phrase must
appear in the search, but it can be part of a longer search string. For example:

Search that will trigger the ad

41
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Starter Edition Account

See Chapter 5 for everything you wanted to know about keywords, but
weren’t sure how to search for it.
Once you’ve saved your additions, Google returns you to the campaign Control
Panel. You’ll notice a difference right away: the column headers, Keyword,
Impressions, Clicks, and Total Cost are now blue, clickable links. If you click
one of them, you sort the entire table based on that column. A downward-
facing triangle appears next to the word you clicked. Your table is sorted in
descending order of that column’s values. Click the same word again and the
triangle flips. Now the table shows the ascending order. This comes in very
handy when you’re managing large campaigns with hundreds of keywords.
Deleting keywords
Delete keywords by — this tip is worth the whole price of the book right here —
clicking Delete next to the keyword you want to delete. Don’t thank me — I’m
just doing my job.
Monitoring keyword performance
As your campaign runs, you’ll notice some interesting things. Some keywords
will register lots of impressions and others very few. Some will get lots of
clicks while others get ignored. For now, just notice these data points. The
Starter Edition doesn’t really give you enough information to make good busi-
ness decisions. When you’re ready to start acting on the market trends, it’s
time to remove the training wheels and graduate to the Standard Edition.
Content network
Below your keyword list, you’ll see a row heading called Content Network.
This doesn’t refer to a bunch of satisfied people who all know each other —
I’ll pause while you smile grimly and consider chucking this book across the
room — but rather the Web sites that have signed up to show Google ads in
the middle of their content.
You can let it run for a bit just for curiosity’s sake, but a best practice is 
to turn it off for now. Here’s why: You may get a lot more content searches
than keyword searches, which can overwhelm your monitoring. Keyword
searches, because they’re tied to specific words, give you much better
market data than impressions and clicks from a bunch of Web sites that are
unknown to you.
Once your campaigns are humming based on keywords, see Chapter 7 to find
out how to set up content network campaigns that won’t muddy your reporting.
42
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

Deploying the Goldilocks 
maximum CPC strategy
In addition to ad copy and keywords, you have control over one more aspect
of your campaign: how much money you agree to give Google for each visitor
it sends to your Web site.
You can let Google’s Budget Optimizer do it for you, which is the default
option. Google will try to give you as many clicks as possible for the monthly
budget you’ve chosen. I recommend overriding Google’s control over your
bidding. You can learn a lot from bidding too high and too low, if you perform
experiments and pay attention to the results. The just-right bid will hover
around the average value of a visitor to a Web site in your market. Visitor
value, which I cover in Chapter 14 until you beg me to stop, is perhaps your
most important business number.
Testing your bids can benchmark you against your competitors to determine
how profitable your Web site is, once someone lands on it, compared to others
in your space. If your Web site is considerably better at making money from 
a visitor than your competitors, you can offer to buy their traffic from them
and pay them more as your reseller than they’d make selling their own stuff!
If you want to set the maximum CPC yourself, click Edit Settings in the main
campaign Control Panel, and next to Bidding, uncheck the Budget Optimizer
option. Enter a bid in the box next to the currency, and save your settings at
the bottom of the page. Pay attention to format here — 25 translates into
$25.00, not $0.25. Don’t get careless and saddle yourself accidentally with a
$4,000 bill to pay.
Impressions, clicks, and cost
These three crucial numbers, shown in Figure 2-9, are at the heart of your
campaign. Smart advertisers pay close attention to those numbers to save
time, money, and heartache.
Impressions
Technically, an impression is a single instance of a search results page that
contains your ad. It doesn’t mean the searcher has seen the ad, just a search
results page with your ad on it. If the searcher has a small screen with high
resolution and your ad appears below the scroll (meaning they’d have to
scroll down in order to view it), it’s still counted as an impression. If they
click the first listing they see, before they’ve looked at yours, it still counts.
43
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Starter Edition Account

Impressions can indicate the potential size of your AdWords market. If you
are bidding on popular keywords, you can expect lots of impressions. But 
if your bidding strategy places your ad very low in the ad rankings, and it
shows up on page 4 of the listings, you’ll see very few impressions — even
though the market itself may be huge.
Clicks
A click is a single instance of a unique visitor clicking your ad and arriving at
your landing URL. Clicks are good, right? The more clicks, the more visitors
to your Web site. Well, not so fast. Clicks cost you money, remember? You
make that investment back only when the visitor buys something from you.
The goal of your ad is twofold:
 To get all the people who will eventually buy from you to click your ad
 To discourage all the people who will never buy from you from clicking
your ad
Obviously, you can’t know in advance who will buy and who won’t. But you
can make some pretty good guesses until you graduate to the Standard
Edition and implement conversion tracking (see Chapter 14).
For example, if you’re advertising a pony tail holder worn by Paris Hilton, and
you mention Paris Hilton in your ad and select Paris Hilton as a keyword,
chances are you’ll find a lot of visitors who have no interest in your hair acces-
sory but a lot of interest in, shall we say, a multimedia Paris Hilton experience.
Figure 2-9:

44
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

As you gain AdWords experience, you’ll learn how to turn the prospect tap
higher or lower to maximize profits.
Cost
Your cost equals the total number of clicks multiplied by the average cost per
click. If you are paying $2.05 per click and your campaign has racked up 17
clicks, your cost so far will be $2.05 × 17 = $34.85.
You should track how long it takes you to use up your monthly budget. If it’s
all gone in 3 days, you’re looking at 27 days with no activity. You should also
track, as best you can, whether an increase in AdWords spending produces
more sales and profits for you.
After you graduate to the Standard Edition, you’ll benefit from much more
powerful reporting tools that show you the profitability of each ad and each
keyword.
You can change the date range to see how your campaign has performed at
different times. On the campaign management Control Panel, click the
Change link next to the date range at the top left of the green header. You’ll
be given a choice of presets: all time, today, yesterday, last 7 days, last week
(Mon-Sun), last business week (Mon-Fri), this month, or last month. You can
alternatively click the second radio button to select any range you want. This
second option is useful if you’ve changed something on January 17 and you
want to compare the 5 days before and after the change.
The statistics don’t represent what your prospects are doing in real time.
Google cops to a three-hour delay in click reporting. You can see impressions
faster than that, usually. But don’t panic because your expected traffic surge
hasn’t materialized two minutes after writing that irresistible ad. Patience,
Grasshopper.
Graphs and reports
If you’re a visual sort of person, check out the Graphs tab on the right of the
green header bar. You will be shown clicks, cost, and impressions per day.
If you want to view your campaign data in beautiful printed form for some
late night reading in bed, or want to share some statistics with colleagues
without having them log in to the account, you can download reports of
impressions, clicks, and costs by keyword and ad. You get a choice of for-
mats; chances are, if you have Microsoft Excel installed on your computer,
you’ll choose .csv (for Excel).

Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Starter Edition Account

Activating Your Account
Are you ready to spend some coin and take your campaign live? Click Activate
Account and complete the form that comes up, as shown in Figure 2-10.
To activate your account, follow these steps:
1. Use the drop-down list to select your billing country.
The most common choices are at the top, followed by long list of just
about every country there is.
2. Select your country from the Time Zone Country or Territory drop-
down list, and then select your time zone from the Time Zone drop-
down list.
Google won’t let you change your time zone once you’ve set it, so be
careful here. No second chances!
3. Enter the promotional code at the back of this book to recoup the cost
of this book in free clicks.
4. Click the Continue button.
5. Choose a payment method.
Google charges your credit card on a pay-as-they-click system. Chances
are, your only real choice here is a credit card: JCB, American Express,
MasterCard, or Visa. I spent about 10 minutes searching for a country
that allowed other options, and gave up after pretending to be from the
USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Netherlands, China, Azerbaijan, and Brunei
Darussalam. (If you happen to live in a country from which Google
accepts PayPal or silver or yak cheese, please let me know for the
second edition.)

Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

6. Accept Google’s Terms and Conditions.
Google’s long and complex Terms and Conditions constitute a legal con-
tract, so read it carefully before agreeing. I’m not a lawyer, so you’ll get
no guidance from me on this one. I just signed up and hoped for the best.
7. Click OK.
You’ll be taken to a screen where you can fill out billing information. If
you’ve ever bought anything online, that process will be straightforward
and simple.
Google’s preferred phone-number format includes dashes, but no paren-
theses or periods:
919-555-3167
not
(919) 555-3167
Once you complete the form, your account is live — and your ad should
start showing on the right side of the Google search results page for the
keywords you’ve selected.
After you complete your account setup, wait 15 minutes, and then browse to
www.google.com and do a search on your keyword.
Look at the top and the right of the search results page. If you don’t see your
ad, scroll down and click the More Sponsored Links link. Keep going through
the pages until you see your ad or you get to the end of the listings. This
exercise gives you an idea of the competitiveness of your market. If you see a
lot of competitors, don’t get discouraged. It means a lot of people think they
can make money here. The information in this book will put you way ahead of
most of them. When you see no or few competitors for a keyword, that may
indicate a market that’s too small or too unresponsive.
When nobody can see your ad
If your ad doesn’t appear in the right column within 30 minutes of account
activation, you may have a problem. Usually, correcting it is simple — once
you’ve figured out what it is.
If your ad isn’t receiving any impressions (indicated by a 0 in the last row of
the Impressions column), you may be a victim of one of the following:
 Editorial disapproval: Have you violated Google’s editorial guidelines? If
you throw exclamation points around like crazy, promise “the best” or
“the cheapest” stuff, capitalize like you’re screaming in a chat room, use
copyrighted terms, offer cheap drugs from Canada or $25 Rolexes or
nuclear-weapon-making instructions, or commit any of a dozen other
infractions, your ad won’t show.
47
Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Starter Edition Account

Google lays out their rules here:
• Editorial Guidelines: https://adwords.google.com/select/
guidelines.html
• Content Guidelines: https://adwords.google.com/select/
contentpolicy.html
 Low ad rank: Based on your monthly budget, which you set when you
created the account, and your optional choice of a maximum bid price,
which you can edit at any time, your ad may be relegated to page 19 of
search results, the equivalent of scribbling it onto the back of a gas sta-
tion receipt in yellow crayon and tossing it into a dumpster.
In the Standard Edition, you can see exactly in what positions your ads
show. At this point, you can try raising your minimum bid — and monthly
budget — and see if that gets you onto the first page of search results.
 Poor keyword performance: If your keyword is pink slippers big
enough to fit an African elephant or some other phrase that
few or no people would ever search for, you could wait a long time before
seeing a single click. In Chapter 5, I’ll introduce you to the spy tools that
help you find out exactly what people are typing into their online searches.
When just you can’t see your ad
Sometimes your ad is receiving impressions, but try as you might, you can’t
find it yourself. Before you start humming the Twilight Zone theme, consider
the possibilities described in the following subsections.
Google thinks you’re searching outside your geo-targeting
Remember when you first set up your account and you had to choose a geo-
graphic location within which to advertise? Google may be interpreting the
information it’s reading on your computer (specifically, its Internet Protocol
[IP] address, to mean you yourself are outside of your targeted area). IP
addresses are loosely connected to different parts of the world.
To find out where the Internet thinks you are, go to www.ipligence.com
and scroll down until you can see the map at the bottom right, shown in
Figure 2-11.
There are many reasons why Google could get confused about where in the
world you are. First, IP addresses aren’t exact — they’re not like Zip or postal
codes. Second, if you are connecting to the Internet through a service that’s
somewhere other than where you are, Google can be misled. Third, little
green aliens from outer space sometimes take over my fingers when I’m
typing stuff I really don’t know anything about so that the paragraphs look
long enough to be authoritative.
48
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

Every machine connected to the Internet has a unique IP address, a string of
four numbers separated by dots. Google’s IP address, for example, is
216.239.51.100. The IP address is the “real” Internet address. We humans give
Web sites names, like Google and WalletEmptyingJunk.com, so we can find
them more easily. The Internet machines map these names onto the numbers
to send our browsers and e-mails to the right places.
Confused? Try this experiment: Open a Web browser, type 216.239.51.100
into the address bar, and press Enter. If you’ve entered the numbers and dots
correctly, you should arrive at Google’s home page.
Your IP address may be unique to your computer, shared by other computers
on your network, or even shared by many of the computers served by your
Internet service provider (ISP).
You chose a different language
If you have chosen to advertise in Spanish (for example), you may not be able
to find your ad if your Google searching preference is set for English. To
change it (you can always change it back), go to www.google.com and click
Preferences next to the search box. Click the radio button Search Only for
Pages Written in These Language(s) and put a check next to the relevant lan-
guage. Click Save Preferences to return to your search.

Managing Your Account
The final frontier of the Starter Edition is the My Account tab at the top left.
Click it and you’ll see three subtabs: Billing Summary, Billing Preferences, and
Account Preferences, as shown in Figure 2-12. Explore them at your leisure —
they’re pretty self-explanatory.
If you run an online pharmacy, you’ll need a PharmacyCheckerID before
Google will let you advertise. Go to the Account Preferences subtab, find the
PharmacyCheckerID section, and click the Edit link to go to a new page. Click
the Read Our FAQ link to find out how to apply.
Upgrading to the Standard Edition
If you’ve created and activated a Starter Edition Account, written two ads,
selected three keywords, and set a monthly budget and minimum CPC, I
hereby declare you ready to upgrade to the Standard Edition.
At the bottom of any page in the Campaign Management tab, click the
Graduate to Standard Edition link. Chapter 3 gives all the details about
moving up to the Standard Edition.

Edition Account
In This Chapter
 Graduating from the Starter Edition
 Starting with the Standard Edition
 Navigating the setup process
 Introducing AdWords Mission Control
You’re about to set up a fully functioning AdWords account! Whether you
took my humble advice and created a starter account first, or decided to
skip the training wheels and climb directly on the two-wheeler, I congratulate
you on this momentous step in your online advertising career. I’m so glad I’m
here to share it with you.
In this chapter, I walk you through setting up a Standard Edition account,
both as an upgrade from the starter edition and from scratch. If you already
have an existing account, you can skip ahead to the “Running Mission Control
with the Campaign Management Tab” section, where you explore the three
basic features of the Standard Edition: campaign management, keyword
selection, and ad writing.
Setting Up Your Standard 
Edition Account
If you already have a Starter Edition account, you see Google’s pitch to try the
full-featured Standard Edition front and center every time you log in. If that’s
you, keep reading. If you’ve decided to jump right into the Standard Edition,
good for you — skip to the “Opening a new Standard Edition account” section,
later in this chapter.

Graduating from the Starter Edition
You can graduate from the Starter Edition to the Standard Edition at any time,
simply by clicking the link at the bottom of any page of your account. On the
next page, review the benefits of the upgrade, and note the warning at the
bottom: You can’t go home to the Starter Edition again. When you’re ready to
take the leap (this really isn’t a big deal, I promise), click Continue.
The next page reminds you yet again that the change to Standard Edition is
permanent. Boldly click the Yes, Graduate link and hum “Pomp and
Circumstance” as the next page loads. Congratulations, you’ve done it! Skip
to the “Running Mission Control with the Campaign Management Tab” sec-
tion, later in this chapter, to find out how to use your awesome new powers
responsibly. (Can you tell I just watched Spider-Man 3?)
Opening a new Standard Edition account
If you’ve decided to jump straight into the Standard Edition, follow these steps:
1. Open your Web browser and go to http://adwords.google.com.
2. (Optional) Choose a language other than English (US) from the drop-
down list at the top right, and Google will translate the page into that
language.
3. Click the Start button at the top right.
(Sometimes the button is labeled Click To Begin or Let’s Get Started. I’ve
never seen it read Drink Me, but I’m hopeful . . . .)
4. Select Standard Edition and click the Continue button.
5. (Optional) Select one or more languages from the list box.
If you’ll be advertising exclusively in English, do nothing. To choose mul-
tiple languages, hold down the Ctrl key while you click (for PC users) or
the Ô key (for Mac users).
6. Leave the Countries and Territories radio button selected, and click
the Continue button.
With the Standard Edition, you can target your ads with flashlight-like
(not really laser-like) precision. I’ll show you how to do this in Chapter 7.
7. Select the country or countries where you’d like your ads to be seen:
a. Select the country in the Available Countries and Territories list
box, and then click the Add button to copy your selection to the
Selected Countries and/or Territories list box.
Select multiple countries just as you would choose more than one
language, by Ctrl+clicking or Ô+clicking.

b. To remove a country or territory from the Selected Countries
and/or Territories list box, select it and click the Remove button.
c. When you’re done, click the Continue button.
8. Fill in the text boxes to create an ad; click the Continue button when
you’re finished.
Now Google wants you to create your first ad. What, you’re not ready to
whip out a masterpiece of persuasive prose at the drop of a cursor? No
worries. Type pretty much anything here — you won’t show it to the
world for a while yet. The following list provides guidance on what to
enter in those text boxes:
• In the Headline text box, type the problem or opportunity.
• In the Description Line 1 text box, enter a short description of big
benefit.
• In the Description Line 2 text box, write a short description of your
product/service.
• In the Display URL text box, type your Web site’s name.
• In the Destination URL text box, enter the URL of the exact Web
page you want customers to visit first.
The display URL is what your prospect sees in the ad itself. It must be
“real” enough to go somewhere relevant if they were to type it in, but it
doesn’t have to be the same as the actual destination URL. Think of the
display URL as the name of your online store; would you rather buy a CN
Netcom amplifying phone headset from www.StuffThatSitsOnYour
Desk.com or www.PhoneSupplies.com/Netcom-Headsets? You can
use the destination URL to track your Web-site traffic and to show differ-
ent pages to different markets.
See Figure 3-1 for an example. But please don’t sweat it at this point. Just
write something that doesn’t violate Google’s editorial or content guide-
lines (see Chapter 2) and move on.
9. Type your chosen keywords into the list box and click the Continue
button when you’re finished.
For now, just type a single keyword that someone searching for your
business might type; for example:
used cars
glow in the dark poker chips
functional fitness training
Next to the box where you input keywords, Google asks if you want
more. If your URLs point to a working Web site, Google quickly scans the
site and suggests other keywords, based on your Web site copy and
Google’s database of related searches. If it can’t find your Web site, you
can enter your main keyword and Google will give you variation and
related searches from its database.
53
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Standard Edition Account

Google is, at its core, a very large data processor. By tracking the behav-
ior of searchers, it gets smarter all the time — and can offer better sug-
gestions to advertisers and better search results to shoppers. Google
notices, for example, how long a person will stay away after clicking an
ad or free listing. If you click my ad, look at my Web page for 3 seconds
and then click back to Google for another search, that tells Google you
didn’t think much of my site. Enough data like that, and my bid prices
will increase to penalize me for not giving Google’s users what they want.
The keyword-suggestion tool can be helpful, but don’t use it right now.
Until you understand how to create tightly focused ad groups, the tool
will create a messy and unfocused campaign. Use the tool later to refine
your campaigns. Right now, just pick one or two closely related terms, if
you like, and continue.
10. Select your currency from the Pay for This Account Using drop-down
list, and then type how much you’re willing to spend in the Enter Your
Daily Budget and the Enter Your Maximum CPC text boxes.
Ready to have some fun? It’s trial-and-error time, thanks to Google’s
Traffic Estimator. Enter any numbers you like for daily budget and maxi-
mum CPC and click View Traffic Estimator. It will show you estimated
CPC, the position of your ad (1 puts you at the top of the first page, 9–10
put you at or near the bottom of the first search-results page or top of
the second page, and 11+ puts your ad squarely on page 2 or worse), the
likely number of clicks per day, and your daily cost.
Typically, an ad on page 2 gets one-tenth the impressions of the same ad
on page 1, so (unless the clicks are ridiculously expensive on the first
page), page 1 is where you want to be.
To view the maximum traffic you could possibly expect from that key-
word, enter a maximum CPC of $100 and a daily budget of $10,000.

Make sure you change these back before continuing!
Google will show you the most you’ll pay for a click if your ad is in the
top position, and the maximum number of clicks each keyword will gen-
erate in a day. Keep in mind, your ad may out- or under-perform this esti-
mate, depending on how well it connects with your prospects.
Settle on a CPC you can live with financially that puts your ad some-
where on the first page. You can make adjustments when you have
actual results to base them on.
11. Click the Continue button.
12. Review your selections on the next page, decide whether you want
e-mail from Google about AdWords strategies and tips, choose an
appropriate answer from the How Did You First Hear about Google
Adwords drop-down list, and finally, click the Continue to Signup
button.
If you don’t have a Google Account, you’re prompted to create one. If you
already have a Google Account for Gmail or other Google services, you can
use it for your AdWords account. If you are a Gmail junkie, for example, you’ll
want to connect the accounts so you don’t sign yourself out of AdWords
every time you check your mail.
For more information about navigating the Google Account business, see
Chapter 2.
The rest of the setup process is exactly the same as the Starter Account process
described in Chapter 2. After you click the link in your activation e-mail, you’ll
get to the login page. Enter the e-mail address and password you selected,
and you’re ready to explore the Standard Edition AdWords control panel.
Your ads won’t show up on-screen until you activate your account by giving
Google five bucks and a working credit-card number. You can do that now by
clicking the link in the warning box with the reddish-pink background and fol-
lowing the account activation wizard (Google is very user-friendly when it
comes to taking your money), or take the tour first and pay later. Even if you
activate now, you can pause your campaigns so you don’t get charged for a
lot of traffic before you know what you’re doing.
Running Mission Control with the
Campaign Management Tab
The first screen you’ll see when you go to http://google.com/adwords
and enter your user name and password is the Account Snapshot screen
(shown in Figure 3-2), unless Google decides it’s a bad idea and drops it after
55
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Standard Edition Account

this book is published. The snapshot screen shows the summary statistics of
all the campaigns in the account: total cost, total number of clicks, total
impressions, and overall CTR. My first impression: This information is essen-
tially useless. The only number that makes sense to summarize over all cam-
paigns is total cost. The rest of the numbers only make you smarter when
you break them down to individual campaigns, ad groups, ads, and keywords.
You’ll spend the majority of your AdWords time in the Campaign Management
tab. After this chapter, most of the book shows you how to improve your
online advertising using its various features. For right now, I’ll show you the
cockpit without asking you to go for a test flight.
You can view your account from three levels, from overview to granular. The
All Campaigns view lists your campaigns and gives you basic metrics on each
one. The individual campaign view provides the same level of detail about the
different ad groups in a particular campaign. The ad group view shows you
the finest details about every ad and every keyword in that ad group. This last
view is where you’ll spend most of your time. Use the other two views to help
you prioritize which ad group will give you the biggest return for time spent.
All Campaigns view
The main campaign summary page lists your campaigns and gives summary
data about each of them. When you create your second campaign, all the
column headings (Campaign Name, Current Status, and so on) become clickable
so you can sort your campaigns in various ways. For example, you probably

the time you

56
Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

want the campaigns that cost the most to be in your face more; click the Cost
heading to sort from most to least costly. Click Cost again to reverse the order.
Campaign Name
By default, AdWords assigns your campaign exciting and informative names
like Campaign #1 and Campaign #2. For your own sanity, please replace
these generic names with descriptions that will still make sense when you’re
running dozens of campaigns at once. You can change the name of a cam-
paign by selecting the check box next to the name and then clicking the Edit
Settings button above the list of campaigns.
Current Status
Campaigns can be active, paused, or deleted by checking the box next to the
campaign or campaigns you want to change, and clicking the Pause, Resume
or Delete buttons above the list of campaign names.
 Active: Active campaigns currently display your ads to searchers. They
cost you money and bring visitors to your Web site.
 Paused: Paused campaigns are on hold, but can be reactivated by a
single click. Pausing a campaign automatically pauses all the ad groups
in that campaign. No impressions, no clicks, no visitors.
 Deleted: Deleted campaigns can also be reactivated by a single click. So
what’s the difference between pausing and deleting a campaign? Beats
me. If you delete a campaign, you can’t actually make it go away. You can
hide it by choosing Show All But Deleted Campaigns from the drop-down
list that currently reads Show All Campaigns (see Figure 3-3). This can
be helpful if you don’t want to clutter your screen with old campaigns,
but still want to see active and paused campaigns. Also, it’s helpful to
delete campaigns if you’re writing AdWords For Dummies and you don’t
want the world to see every detail of your AdWords account in your
screen shots.
Current Budget
Google shows you the daily budget you set for each campaign. It’s grayed out
and bracketed in paused and deleted campaigns. You can change your daily
budget for any campaign by checking the box next to the campaign name and
clicking the Edit Settings button above the list of campaigns.
Clicks
A click represents one person clicking your ad and arriving on your landing
page. Google doesn’t count multiple clicks from the same computer on the
same day (or tries very hard not to) — that’s so your competitors can’t sit
behind their desks and develop carpal tunnel syndrome trying to bankrupt
you by clicking your ad repeatedly. Two clicks equals two unique visitors to
your site.
57
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Standard Edition Account

Impr.
Impr. is short for impressions, or the number of times your ad was included
on a page that Google showed to a searcher.
CTR
CTR (Click-Through Rate) is the ratio of clicks to impressions, expressed as a
percentage. It’s one of your most important AdWords numbers, so if you’re
confused, take a little time to get clear. You can calculate CTR by dividing
clicks by impressions. For example, if 200 people see your ad, and 12 of them
click it, here’s the math:
12 ÷ 200 = .06 = 6.00%
You’d then brag at the AdWords Saloon, “My CTR is six percent.” And every-
one would understand that your ad was so compelling, 6 out of every 100
people who saw it ended up on your Web site.
Avg. CPC
The Avg. CPC (Cost Per Click) column tells you how much, on average, you
paid Google to get a visitor to your Web site. You may have different average
CPCs by campaign, ad-group, keyword, and ad. A big part of AdWords man-
agement is deleting or improving elements of your advertising that cost you
more than you make back, so your average click cost is an important metric.
Figure 3-3:

Part I: Becoming a Google Advertiser 

Cost
Your cost is simply all the money you’ve spent on clicks. In this screen, it’s
broken down by campaign. When you drill deeper, you can see how much
each ad and each individual keyword costs you. (After you’ve set up conver-
sion tracking, described in Chapter 14, you can also track how much each ad
makes you.)
You can change the date range in the All Campaigns or any other view by
selecting one of the presets in the drop-down list just below the date, or by
selecting the lower radio button and inputting any two dates. For some
reason, Google insists that your start date be before your end date (that’s a
little un-quantum-physics, don’t you think?). Get into the habit of checking
your date range first, whenever you work on campaign management. Other-
wise you panic if you see only six clicks, when the cause isn’t a broken cam-
paign, but a view set to Today instead of This Month.
Individual Campaign view
Click your campaign name to see your account at the ad-group level. You can
see all your ad groups’ statistics, including two new columns: Default Bid and
Avg. Pos.
 Default Bid: Your default bid is the maximum CPC you selected when
you created the account. You can change this bid for specific campaigns,
the ad groups, or even individual keywords. You can also bid more or
less based on the source of the traffic: Google, search partners, or con-
tent partners. In Chapter 7, you’ll discover smart strategies for bidding
different amounts on different keywords.
 Avg. Pos: The average position of your ad refers to where it appears in
relation to all other ads showing for the same keyword. At the ad-group
level, an average position of 5.7 means that on average, your ad shows
most often in position 6, less often in position 5, and occasionally higher
or lower. If your average position is greater than 8, your ads are not
showing nearly as much as they might — only very determined
searchers ever go on to the second page of Google results.
You can see some trends, even with extremely small numbers. For example,
my new Cold Calls ad group (in Figure 3-4) has received 2 clicks out of 41
impressions, for a rather nice 4.87% CTR. This CTR translates into 49 visitors
to my Web site for every thousand people who view the ad after searching for
keywords in the Cold Calls ad group. Each click cost me just under $0.20 on
average, so I can expect to pay $9.80 for those 49 visitors.
59
Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Standard Edition Account

Don’t make any assumptions or decisions based on numbers as low as I’m
describing here. As a general rule, you want to see at least 30 total clicks
before ascribing validity to the data. I know of one business owner who drove
his business into the ground making knee-jerk changes based on tiny num-
bers. See Chapter 13 for more than you ever wanted to know about statistical
significance.
As in the All Campaigns view, once you have more than one ad group in a
campaign, the column headers will turn clickable and sortable.
Individual ad-group view
In the Individual Campaign view, click the name of an ad group to drill down to
the most detailed and powerful view, the individual ad group (see Figure 3-4).
Summary tab
The summary tab shows you several things at a glance:
 Look below the ad for an indication that you are running more than one
ad. In Figure 3-4, you can see 1 of 2 — View All. That’s good — you
almost always want to be running two ads simultaneously, to find out
which one is better (I’ll show you how to do this in Chapter 13). For now,
you’ll see 1 of 1.
Figure 3-4:

 Check the date range at the top left of the green header bar. You can
change it by clicking the Change Range link, amazingly enough.
 Check how your ads are doing by network. In this example, my Google
search results are 2 clicks and 41 impressions, and my content network
is disabled.
Keywords
The real power of this view resides in the Keywords tab, located just to the
right of the active Summary tab. Click Keywords right in the tab to move into
keyword view. In Chapter 5 you discover the power of this screen — and
learn to drive it like a pro.
Ad variations
One tab to the right from Keywords is the Ad Variations tab. Click it to view
your ad. (Figure 3-5 shows an ad group with two ads running simultaneously,
to give you a taste of what’s in store.) You’ll see how that ad is doing, and on
what networks it’s been showing.
Click the ad itself to go to your landing page. Click the Edit link under the
actions column to change the ad. Delete it by marking the check box to its
left and clicking Delete. Create a new text ad by clicking the Text Ad link next
to Create New Ad just below the date range.

Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Standard Edition Account

The numbers are far too low to take seriously at this point — but notice the
difference in CTR: 8.69% to 0%. If the first ad gets 10–15 clicks while the second
ad hasn’t gotten a single one, I’d declare the second ad DOA and try to beat
my control with a new one. By the way, what’s the difference between the two
ads? Can you see it? The first ad has a comma in the Description Line 2 while
the second has doesn’t. When you only have 130 characters to play with,
little things matter!

T
his part is dedicated to finding and counting your
prospects, so you can determine whether you have a
business that can benefit from AdWords (or any other
online-traffic-generation program), and then connecting
with your prospects on an emotional level, so they see
your ads and Web site and immediately get the urge to
reach for their wallets. The biggest business mistake is
ignoring your market and trying to sell what you’ve got,
regardless of whether anybody needs or wants it.
Chapter 4 introduces you to the underground world of
online market research. You’ll see how to assess the 
profitability of a market in an afternoon, so your online
adventures can be close to risk-free.
You explore the heart and soul of online marketing in
Chapter 5: keywords. Keywords are the words and
phrases that people type into search engines, YouTube,
and eBay when they’re looking for something to read,
watch, or buy. When you understand the keywords your
prospects use to find you, and the hidden desires repre-
sented by those keywords, you will be successful.
Chapter 6 builds on the keyword foundation and shows
you how to write ads that inflame the desires represented
by keywords. It covers fundamentals, clever variations,
and even some sneaky tricks to make your ads more 
compelling and profitable.

T
he Internet is the ultimate spy tool — (ahem) I mean, market-research
opportunity. If you know where to look (and you will by the end of this
chapter), you can determine pretty precisely how many people are looking
for your product, how much they’re willing to pay for it, and how much money
your competitors are making from those people. You can also see how your
competitors are marketing — their ads, Web sites, e-mails, promotions, pric-
ing, customer service — and learn a lot about what works and what doesn’t.
On the Internet, we’re all marketing naked. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to
become a peeping tom of prospects and competitors. Enjoy the view!
Assessing Market Profitability (Don’t
Dive into an Empty Pool)
In the movie Field of Dreams, the Ray Kinsella character builds a baseball dia-
mond in his Iowa cornfield based on a voice that mysteriously repeats, “If
you build it, he will come.” That philosophy made for a great movie, but I
don’t recommend it as a customer-acquisition strategy. If you build it, you’re
probably end up with a garage full of it — unless you take the time to figure
out whether anybody’s going to want it enough to pay for it.

Ken McCarthy, creator of The System Seminar for Online Marketing (www.
thesystemseminar.org), once asked during a lecture, “If you were an
Olympic diver, what would be the most important skill you could possess?”
The answers varied — the ability to hold a triple gainer, strong core align-
ment, powerful legs, and so on — but Ken kept shaking his head no to each
try. Finally, when we were getting really frustrated, he shared his answer:
“The ability to tell if there’s enough water in the pool before diving.”
In other words, find out if there’s a market before you commit large amounts
of time and money to creating a business or a product (or to learning fancy
marketing tricks to attract buyers). As Perry Marshall points out, amateur
marketers create a product and then look for people to sell it to — while pro-
fessional marketers find customers and then look for something to sell them.
Whether you are starting a new venture online, or you have an existing busi-
ness that you’re looking to expand online through AdWords, don’t spend any
time writing ads or creating Web sites or sourcing products or setting up fac-
tories or hiring employees or printing letterhead until you’ve looked into the
pool and determined that you can dive without hitting the concrete floor at
60 miles per hour.
In the old days of business, that sort of market research was a drag. Labor-
intensive, expensive, imprecise, and slow. But if you want to sell online through
paid search, you can save yourself months of agony and thousands of dollars
in less time than it takes to fly from Bath, New York to Bath, England.
Glenn Livingston, a former consultant to Fortune 100 companies, has been
doing online market research on a do-it-yourself budget with impressive results:
he has entered 12 online markets and achieved profitability quickly in all 12.
That’s quite a batting average, considering that 78.6% of all new businesses
fail within six months. (See Conveniently Making Up Statistics For Dummies for
a full explanation of this calculation. Actually, I have no idea what the failure
rate is, and neither does anyone else.) Considering that Glenn offers seven
hours of free audio training on his state-of-the-art market-research techniques
at www.ultimateadwordsresearch.com, I’m glad he was able to boil
down those techniques to four critical factors for inclusion in this book:
“Traditional marketing wisdom says you make your money when you
choose your market. Any fisherman will tell you that the best rod and bait in
the world won’t do you any good in a mud puddle, so let’s talk about how to
find the best fishing holes.
“While there are literally dozens of factors to consider when choosing a
market, here are four of the absolute most important things to know before
you go fishing . . .
66
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

“How big is your market? (Market Size)
“How much is the average visitor worth? (Average Spend)
“What’s the total dollar volume? (Market Size x Average Spend)
“How stable is the market? (Market Stability & Trends)”
Glenn boils down initial market research into one key question: “Are other
people making money there?” Because the Internet is so decentralized,
nobody knows exactly how big and juicy a given market is. And, as the diet
ads say, individual results may vary. Glenn created some guidelines that
allowed him to evaluate a market on a lazy Sunday afternoon, and have a
very good idea of the potential profitability of the market by dinnertime.
Remember when your high school Social Studies teacher got mad at you for
skipping all the comments on your essay and just flipping to the letter grade
on the last page? You’re about to discover why — in the case of PPC (Pay Per
Click) marketing, the “letter grade” — the potential profitability of the market —
can get you into a lot of trouble if you don’t understand the data behind it.
For example, certain markets can be profitable for advanced marketers and
not beginners. Some markets can produce good results with a dozen keywords,
while others require tens of thousands. No tool can ever replace your own
judgment.
Determining market size 
by spying on searches
Would you like to know how many times people searched for keywords
related to your business last month? How about which keywords were the
most popular? And suppose you could do it in about 20 seconds — are you
willing to spend the time before setting up your AdWords campaigns?
The number of searches is a critical number if you plan to make AdWords a
significant part of your business acquisition strategy. Think Yellow Pages
again — if no one is looking for the listing Unicycles, then a unicycle shop that
relies on the Yellow Pages is going to have trouble paying the rent. Of course,
many items and services are sold that aren’t searched for — just not with
AdWords. For example, lots of people buy CDs with guided meditations. But
very few people searched for them (about four a day), so you could reason-
ably expect one sale every one to two months from AdWords traffic if your ad
and Web site were very good. And with that tiny trickle of traffic, your testing
of alternate ads (see Chapter 13) and landing pages (Chapter 15) will provide
conclusive results some time around the next ice age.
67
Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market

Go to www.askhowie.com/freewords, type a keyword into the search box,
and click Research. After a few seconds, you’ll see a list of the top 100 key-
words that include the one you typed, as shown in Figure 4-1. Select and copy
the entire list, including search volume numbers. Then open an Excel spread-
sheet, highlight cell A1, and paste. You should see one column of numbers
and another of keywords.
Quickly scan the keywords and delete any rows unrelated to your market. For
example, if you sell books and supplies to rabbit owners, you will remove
terms like Velveteen Rabbit and Who Framed Roger Rabbit from the list.
Examine the remaining keywords, paying attention to several things:
 Which keywords are more popular (higher on the list) than others?
 Are there just a few keywords that result in the vast majority of
searches?
 Do some of the keywords represent sub-markets within the main 
market (for example, rabbits for hobbyists versus rabbits for commer-
cial purposes — Pets or Meat)?

68
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Google doesn’t make the number of searches public information, so you will
have to use a different source to estimate the size of the AdWords search
market. Yahoo! currently makes its numbers available at http://inventory.
overture.com, but the tool has been unreliable and disappears from time to
time. Check www.askhowie.com/chapter-4 for updates and locations of
the best free and paid keyword research tools. I’ve configured www.askhowie.
com/freewords to redirect to whatever keyword tool is working best at any
given time. The one in Figure 4-1 gets its data from the $70 per month Keyword
Discovery database. I find that these numbers must be multiplied by 100–300
to predict actual Google search impressions.
Figure 4-1 shows that people searched for back pain 1,571 times the previ-
ous month. The top related terms include lower back pain (630), upper
back pain (207), and low back pain (205). This information is helpful —
not just now, while you’re assessing the potential risks and rewards of enter-
ing the market, but later on, when you choose keywords and write sales copy.
For example, over three times as many people searched for lower back
pain than low back pain. If you were writing the headline of a Google ad
promising relief from back pain, that information would lead you to choose
lower back pain as the term that mirrors the language of your market.
You would also use that information to create the copy on your Web site, and
in offline marketing materials such as brochures, print ads, business cards,
and so on.
The total number of searches for the top 100 keywords, which appears at the
bottom of the page, is a good indication of whether it’s a good market to enter.
Beginning AdWords marketers should stay between 500 and 5,000 searches
per month (which translates into 50,000–1,500,000 Google searches). After
you’ve had success in these less competitive but still vibrant markets, you
can begin to tackle markets with more than 5,000 monthly searches in the
free keyword tool.
Estimating profitability by snooping 
on your competitors’ keyword bids
Most smart businesses will spend money on customer acquisition until they
reach the break-even point. If you know that every time a Google user visits
your Web page, you make 35 cents (on average, not for every single visitor),
and you have the ability to sell additional products and services to that cus-
tomer in the future, you probably would be willing to pay 35 cents to get the
Google user to visit. That is, you’re willing to break even on the first sale to
69
Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market

gain a valuable business asset: a customer with whom you can build a relation-
ship. (Chapter 14 celebrates the break-even concept to your heart’s content.)
If you are selling a product that promises customers will save or make money
by using it, you can usually charge more for it than if the product does not
promise financial reward. It’s hard to translate money into happiness. It’s
easy to compare the price of the product (say, a $750 AdWords telephone
consultation with me) with the thousands of dollars you’ll save on your
AdWords campaigns. That’s why marketing consultants make more than life
coaches. Keep this distinction in mind as you explore your markets.
If the average bid is under a dime, you can assume that very few people have
figured out how to sell high-ticket or high-margin products or services. For
example, about 75,000 people search for home remedies each month, yet
the average bid hovers around 10 cents. Home remedy seekers are do-it-
yourselfers, looking for cheap and ingenious tips rather than expensive do-it-
for-me solutions. Compare that to starting a business, which goes for
over two dollars a click. This comparison points out an important distinction
between markets: the “buying dollars for dimes” market versus everything
else.
In some markets, bid prices bear little relation to the value of a visitor. Big
companies (which I define as any organization where the person in charge of
AdWords campaigns isn’t using a personal credit card to pay) tend to over-
bid. Some businesses are so good at earning money from visitors that they
can afford to lose money to acquire a customer. But in general, the average
bid price for a keyword gives you a good idea how much a click is worth, on
average, to your competitors.
Google doesn’t share its bid prices publicly, but you can estimate them using
the Traffic Estimator tool in your AdWords control panel. The tool is erratic
in its ability to predict your actual bid prices, but as long as you’re using it to
compare markets in a very preliminary “Is this worth my time?” sort of way,
you needn’t worry about pinpoint accuracy.
Sizing up the entire market by tallying
total advertising spend
By doing a little keyword research and entering your results into the MPG 
calculator that you can download from www.askhowie.com/mpg, you can
assess the Total Market Health (TMH) — man, am I a fabulous acronym
builder (FAB) or what? — of your market by combining the total number of
70
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

bids with a weighted average of bid prices. This gives you a rough estimate 
of how much money is being spent in the market by PPC advertisers.
The process will take you fewer than ten minutes per market (I’ve done it so
often I can do it in under five minutes), and it looks more complicated than it
is. If you’ve never used a spreadsheet program before, you may want to have
an Excel jockey friend on hand to help you the first time.
1. Go to www.askhowie.com/mpg and download the MPG Calculator.
You’ll need Microsoft Excel or the free spreadsheet Calc available at
www.openoffice.org to open the MPG.
2. Once you’ve downloaded and opened the MPG, enter the keyword
you searched using the free keyword tool described in the “Determin-
ing market size by spying on searches” section, earlier in this chapter.
3. Enter the total monthly search volume from the spreadsheet with the
top 100 keywords into the MSV column of the MPG.
4. Log in to your account at http://google.com/adwords.
5. Click the Tools link and choose Traffic Estimator from the Optimize
Your Ads section.
6. From the spreadsheet with the top 100 keywords, select and copy the
entire column containing the keywords.
Do not include the search volume numbers, just the keywords 
themselves.
7. Paste those 100 keywords into the box at the top of the Traffic
Estimator.
8. Leave Max CPC and Daily Budget blank, select the language and loca-
tion targeting based on the market you’ve going after, and click
Continue.
9. Above the table on the next page, look for the Average CPC for those
keywords.
10. Divide the Average CPC in half and enter that number in the
Maximum CPC field. Click Get New Estimates.
11. Keep reducing your Maximum CPC until the Estimated Ad Positions
are 4–6 for the majority of your highest volume keywords.
12. Now take the Average CPC estimated by Google and paste it into the
CPC column of the MPG.
The MPG calculates the TMH for the market defined by that broad keyword.
It will be a number between 0 and 5000 (some markets may top out above
71
Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market

5000, but that will be rare). Try this exercise with different markets, and espe-
cially with different variations of your main keywords. Which appears more
profitable: car insurance or auto insurance? Back pain or back
ache? Beekeeper or apiarist?
What sort of TMH are you looking for? The longer you do this, the better your
feel will become, but for right now you can follow Glenn’s rule of thumb:
AdWords beginners should enter niche markets with TMHs between 100 and
200. At 200, the markets become more competitive, and below 100, there’s
not enough money to go around. One exception to this rule is the “dollars for
dimes” market. If you’re helping people make or save money, you can prob-
ably make a go of it with a TMH between 50 and 200.
Don’t get freaked out if Google’s Traffic Estimator tool initially predicts very
high CPCs — those numbers are the bid prices for the top positions, which you
probably don’t want, and reflect the “ignorance tax” Google imposes on adver-
tisers who don’t follow the strategies you’re learning here. (See the “Bid per-
sistence: Will you still love me tomorrow?” section, later in this chapter.) Chris
Carpenter, creator of the popular Google Cash e-book (available at www.google
cash.com), cautions against making market profitability predictions in markets
where lots of newbie advertisers are failing on a daily basis. His reasoning:
There are tons of newbie advertisers that enter the market everyday. They
throw up an ad for a day and then when they lose money, they take the ad
down.
So if you went to the Google Traffic Estimator and saw that people are
spending $1 or even several dollars per click for a keyword (health
insurance, for example), you might think that they’re making money in
that market. But there is a good chance that they are not.
For many keywords, especially broad, high-traffic keywords that have bid
prices of $1 per click and up, nobody is making money.
I have been monitoring over 100,000 keywords for the last six months using
software that I created. It shows me for each keyword, which Adwords ads
have shown up consistently day in and day out, and which have been put up
and taken down right away, or a couple of days later.
There are many keywords where I see a new ad coming and going every
day, but no ads staying up there day in and day out. So that means that even
though some of these keywords cost over $1 per click, no one has a
profitable Adwords campaign using these keywords.
At press time, Chris’s tool, Google Cash Detective, wasn’t available to the gen-
eral public. If you’re interested in advanced predictive PPC market research,
check www.askhowie.com/detective for the latest on the public availabil-
ity of the tool.

Giving your market a stress test 
to determine future health
If Oprah ever reads my hilarious yet touching and wise essay, Manifesto of an
Average Ultimate Frisbee Player, surely she will invite me to be a guest on her
show. For several weeks after this, many people will search online for Oprah
Frisbee guy and a few variations. But would it be wise to build a business
based on that keyword family? Probably not, since my fame (and it is coming,
I tell you) is likely to be fleeting. If your business success depends on short-
lived trends or fads, you’ll never turn your AdWords campaigns into business
assets. They won’t be reliable. Similarly, if your market is trending downward
(Ken McCarthy discovered that very few people in the 21st century are search-
ing for buggy whips anymore, even though they had been all the rage 100
years earlier), you can’t rely on past data.
Luckily, Google publicly shares a tool that allows you to view trends in your
market to help you decide whether it’s stable, growing, or declining.
Visit Google Trends (www.google.com/trends) and search for the major
keywords in your market. Is the traffic stable over the past few years?
Trending upward? Good. If it’s trending downward, beware. You’ll see sea-
sonal cycles in the Google Trends graphs, as shown in Figure 4-2. Don’t 
worry about dips that occur regularly each year. Be worried if the overall
graph trends downward.
Aside from being fascinating and addictive (at least for people who subscribe
to American Demographics magazine), Google Trends gives you a longer-term
picture of your market. Why, for example, did searches on back pain spike
in July of 2005? I don’t know, but I’ll but some chiropractic market analyst has
an answer. The cities, regions, and language tabs provide more useful infor-
mation. For instance, the regions tab reveals that 9 of the 10 countries ranked
for most back pain searches were part of the British Empire at one point in
their history. Coincidence? Maybe.
Sometimes, Google superimposes news headlines on the graph, as in Figure
4-3. William Shatner’s hospitalization for back pain in October 2005 (point B
on the graph) appears to have triggered little additional interest, but the
December 2006 ABC news report on lower back pain and yoga (point C)
either anticipated or sparked another explosion of interest going into the new
year. I don’t know what any of this means, but if I were selling products to
help your aching back, I would spend a lot of time looking at graphs like
these. And whatever your market, I recommend you do the same.

Taking the Temperature of Your 
Market — Advanced Methods
The search data described in the preceding section represents the demand side
of your market. The following sections look at the supply side — information
about the businesses selling in that market, and how much they’re making.
To continue paying homage to Ken McCarthy’s swimming-pool metaphor, it’s
not enough for the Olympic diver to be able to tell that the pool contains
660,253.09 gallons of water. If the water is frozen solid, diving in is not a good
idea. If the market consists of hundreds of thousands of monthly searches but
no buyers, you’re diving in a frozen market — and it won’t feel good when you
land on your head (or your empty wallet).
The average bid price, described earlier in this chapter, is one indicator of
the responsiveness of a market. But this issue is so important that you
should take some time and corroborate your first impression with several
other data sources.
Number of advertisers on Google
In the popular imagination, entrepreneurs get rich by creating products and
services that nobody else has ever thought of. In real life, that rarely happens.
Truly original products and services often languish for years until they catch
on. Rather than celebrating when you discover that no one else is selling
what you want to sell, you should become somber and a little nervous. Then
take a deep breath, relax your shoulders, and continue with your day. (I didn’t
want to leave you all nervous and tense — you might get back pain, and I’m
not selling anything in that market. Much better for me if you get gout.)
Go to www.google.com, search for your keyword, and count the number of
sponsored listings. You can do this by clicking More Sponsored Links just
below the column of AdWords ads on the right (see Figure 4-4). The first 10
listings appear on that page. Click the Next button at the bottom to bring up
listings 11-20. Keep clicking Next on each subsequent page until you run out
of Next links to click. Figure 4-5 shows the end of the long line of ads for the
keyword lower back pain. Seven ads on Result Page 9 translates to 87 ads.
For some reason, Google doesn’t always display the More Sponsored Links
link the first time you search. Refresh the page until that link appears by
choosing View➪Refresh or View➪Reload in your browser.
You’ll see slightly different results depending on your geographic location —
a number of listings in my example were for local chiropractors — but the
general trend will be clear.
75
Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market

Glenn Livingston (of www.ultimateadwordsresearch.com) cautions
AdWords beginners to avoid competing on keywords with more than 25 com-
petitors. Once you’ve cut your teeth in less competitive markets, you can
begin to assault the lofty domains of high profit. After all, if someone’s doing
well there, why not you?

Bid persistence: Will you still 
love me tomorrow?
Beware of markets full of here-today-gone-tomorrow advertisers. After all,
advertisers are trying new things all the time, thanks to Google’s no-commit-
ment, low-cost model. Just because you can gather more market data on a
Sunday afternoon than Procter & Gamble was able to amass during the entire
Carter administration doesn’t mean the data is stable. Bids especially are vul-
nerable to sudden change, since each bid represents not an entire market
segment but one merchant’s decision that day.
A simple way to establish bid persistence is to print out the first two pages of
the sponsored listings, and then print out the listings again at least three weeks
later. To reduce your risk as much as possible, repeat this exercise again three
weeks after that. If you see that the listings are stable over those six weeks, it
means that these folks are either very careless or they’re making money.
Going deeper with the AdWords 
Keyword Tool
Earlier in this chapter, I describe how to use the Traffic Estimator to assess
Total Market Health. Now I show you how to use another AdWords tool to
figure out if you can afford to use AdWords to test your initial sales process.
Google is famous for being wildly inaccurate in predicting your actual bid
prices, because your actual bid depends on the quality of your Web site (as
well as on the invisible hand of capitalism). The Keyword Tool, like the Traffic
Estimator, gives you a dollar amount based on the history your competitors
have amassed, which makes it more, not less, valuable at this point in your
research.
To use the AdWords Keyword Tool, follow these steps:
1. Log in to your Standard Edition AdWords account and navigate to an
individual Ad Group by entering the Campaign Management area,
clicking a campaign name, and then clicking an ad group within the
campaign.
2. Select the Keywords tab and click the Keyword Tool link (see Figure 4-6).
3. Enter your main keyword, select Cost and Ad Position Estimates from
the Choose Data to Display drop-down list, and click the Get More
Keywords button.
77
Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market

Figure 4-7 shows the estimated CPC for back pain and — hundreds of related
keywords — as well as the position you can expect for that CPC. If your default
CPC for that ad group is too low, enter a higher Max CPC in the box and click
the Recalculate button. You can also enter smaller CPCs and recalculate to
find out how little you can expect to pay for various positions. The lower the
CPC, the less profitable it has been in the past for other AdWords advertisers.
You’re looking for a sweet spot, where the Max CPC is low enough that you
can afford to pay for enough clicks to test and improve — and high enough
that you can be sure others are making money in this market.
Discovering buying trends at online stores
Another source of Internet market data are the popular online stores. To dif-
ferent degrees, they reveal what their merchants are selling and/or what their
patrons are buying.
PayPal
Many online merchants conduct business using PayPal as their Web host and
merchant account. PayPal graciously provides us with revealing glimpses of
their bloomers by listing the number of sales each shop has made (which is
one reason not to use PayPal shops if you’re in a competitive market).
Figure 4-6:

Keyword
Tool

78
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

To score this data, go to www.paypal.com and click the tiny Shops link near
the bottom of the page. On the next page (see Figure 4-8), you can enter a key-
word and search for shops, or you can browse the category listings to the left. In
most cases, the category listings are too broad to help you assess the strength
of a niche market. You can see 16 pages of PayPal shops — at 25 listings per
page, that’s a minimum of 376 merchants selling products related to back pain.
Spend some time looking at which merchants are making the most — and
fewest — sales. Mattresses and magnetic wraps (passive devices) seem to be
more popular than hypnosis products and advice (products that require active
participation). Save yourself the grief of creating another failing online store
by making sure that at least a few people are making sales of products similar
to yours.
Amazon
Remember way back when Amazon.com was just a bookstore? Now it sells
electronics, kitchen gadgets, outdoor furniture, clothes, shoes, musical
instruments, groceries, jewelry, sporting goods, toys, and pretty much every-
thing else that can be put in a box and sent by UPS. Amazon has succeeded
partly because it analyzes every bit of customer data it collects. If you’ve
shopped at Amazon before, and you have its cookie on your computer, it’ll
show you a home page calculated to vacuum the maximum amount of money
from your wallet, based on what it thinks you’ll want to buy next.

Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market

You want to search Amazon anonymously — so if you, too, get a personal
greeting from Amazon (and you thought you were special, huh?), click the
link at the top that says If you’re not Jack Bauer, click here. 
On the sign-up page that follows, don’t fill anything in. Instead, click the
amazon.com tab at the top left to re-enter the site as a stranger. Now, when
you search, Amazon won’t filter the results based on your shopping history.
Instead, it’ll serve you the most profitable products in each category.
A cookie is a tiny piece of code that a Web site will store in your computer so
the Web site will recognize you in future visits. Amazon always greets me by
name when I log on, and shows me the items I looked at last, along with new
recommendations. If I delete all my cookies in my Web browser Options or
Preferences menu, the next time I show up, Amazon will treat me like a new
customer, about whom it knows nothing.
As in PayPal Shops, you can type in a search term or just browse by category.
A category search of Exercise & Fitness (see Figure 4-9) shows the three most
profitable products front and center: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill, and an
elliptical trainer. On the right, it offers a low-cost item (a yoga mat) and a
slightly higher-priced step system.

Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Drill down into categories and subcategories to see what Amazon knows it
can sell in each market niche. You can also search by keyword; a search for
back pain on the entire Amazon.com site (shown in Figure 4-10) displays,
on the left, 28,000 books, 1436 products in Health and Personal Care, 211
items in Sports and Outdoors, 88 in Home and Garden, and so on. Click each
category to find the bestselling items within it.
I want to see what’s hot in Health & Personal Care related to back pain. When
I click that category, Amazon shows me the most popular items it or its part-
ner stores carry (see Figure 4-11). In this case, it’s a Spine-Worx Back
Realignment Device, a Body Back Buddy — which presumably can double as
a coat rack, and lumbar support for the cheap desk chair your company buys
because ergonomically sound chairs cost too much.
You might be tempted to throw in the towel if you see the product you want
to sell, or a very similar one, listed on Amazon for 30% less than you can buy
it for. Don’t worry — you have a huge competitive advantage over Amazon if
you’ve chosen a specific market niche. Amazon will bid on AdWords, but your
ads will be better. Your campaigns will be more efficient and more tightly tar-
geted, and you will understand your customers’ fears and desires better than
Amazon does.

The bottom line of all your research is to answer the question, “Are people
making money online in this market using PPC?” If the answer is no, let go of
this market for now, and repeat the research process with a different market.
If the search volume is high enough, and the customers are ready to spend
money, then you’re ready to go to a higher and more intensive level of
research, to find out what your prospects want — and what drives them
crazy about their current situation.
Eavesdropping at the Watering Hole
The size and temperature of your market tell you whether to enter that
market. Knowing how many people are searching and buying doesn’t help
you market to them yet. You just know they’re out there, poking around and
buying stuff from your competitors. The next three research questions guide
you to develop the right product and sell it using the right concepts.
Your future customers will tell you what they want to buy, how they want to
buy it, what color and size and shape it should be, what kind of delivery options
they prefer, and how much you should charge for it. They will talk for hours
about what bugs them about other options, and what the perfect solution to
their problems would be. All you have to do is find out where the conversa-
tions are happening, sit down, and start listening.
Remember those nature specials on public television that show all the ani-
mals gathered around the watering hole in the savannah? They’re all hanging
out, drinking, socializing, eating some grass, sharing the day’s gossip. Your
market has a watering hole where your buyers gather, too. If you want to find
out what to sell to your market and how to sell it, you’ve got to hang out at
the watering hole.
Your market’s watering hole is where your prospects come to gather informa-
tion and develop relationships that will help them in their business. The offline
component of a watering hole includes lunches, golf meetings, conferences,
phone calls, trade journals, water cooler gossip (a literal watering hole!), and
the daily routines of business. The online component has two big parts: online
groups and the Blogosphere (a cool word meaning “the world of blogs”).
Online groups
The two big providers of free groups are Yahoo! and Google. Spend some time
on each site, searching for groups related to your keywords and your market.
83
Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market

Join the most active groups, read the message archives, and follow the daily
threads. Verify that the people in the groups are your prospects.
Resist the urge to do any selling in these groups. You’re at their watering
hole, remember? If you start pitching your product or services, or contribute
comments that are off-base or self-serving or unhelpful, you’ve just identified
yourself not as a zebra, giraffe, springbok, or wildebeest, but as a crocodile! If
you want to come back and sell to these groups later, after you’ve mastered
their jargon and understood their concerns, they’ll freeze you out if you
pushed too hard at the beginning.
Yahoo! Groups
Begin at http://groups.yahoo.com. To join Yahoo! Groups, you need a
free Yahoo! account. If you don’t yet have one, you’ll be prompted to create
one. You can start searching for groups without an account, but you’ll need
to create an account before you can join a group. If you have a Yahoo! account,
log in and start searching. You can apply to join groups right away.
After you’ve done some searching, you’ll discover why Google, not Yahoo!, is
the preferred search engine. Yahoo! focuses exclusively on keywords, and
ignores meaning and context. When I typed Juggling into the Groups search
box, the first two groups listed (shown in Figure 4-12) were a support group
for work-at-home moms and another for Christian homeschoolers with more
than two children. They were in the top positions not for relevance, but
because they were the two largest groups that had the word juggling in their
description. Both groups, of course, used the term juggling metaphorically. So
neither is a particularly useful watering hole to learn about your prospects’
views on replaceable wicks for juggling torches or the proper weight of a sili-
con stage ball. The next three groups, however, are closer to the mark: a
group dedicated to Contact Juggling, a group of Christian clowns, and the
main Yahoo! juggling group. The Contact Juggling group’s archives are public,
while the other four groups require membership.
In addition to the keyword search, Yahoo! also gives you a directory of cat-
egories that may be more useful. At the top of Figure 4-12, you can see the
categories Hobbies & Crafts > Hobbies > Juggling. Click Juggling to view 192
different juggling-related groups. The first two groups look familiar. When you
click juggling2, you’re taken to the group’s home page, where you can read a
description of the group, see how active the members are (by viewing the
message-history chart), and decide if it’s worth your time to join this group.
To join, click the Join This Group! on the right. On the next page, select the
e-mail address you want linked to this group, choose how you want to receive
messages (individual e-mail, daily digest, or Web only), select the e-mail format,
copy some text to prove you’re a human and not a software program, and click
Join. I recommend choosing the daily digest over individual e-mails — if it’s an
active group, you could easily spend your entire day dealing with off-topic
84
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

threads about whether other threads are off-topic, and nonsense like that.
You can always change your preferences after you’ve joined, and you can
also quit any group easily.
Once you join, you can read through the archives and view profiles of group
members. Figure 4-13 shows posts in the Juggling2 group.
If you wanted to launch a competing product to the Dube Airflight Clubs, you
could gain valuable insight into what people like and don’t like about them.
The posts shown in Figure 4-13 indicate that clubs striking in midair is a prob-
lem for some jugglers.
If you wanted to (say) sell against Airflight, you could create thinner clubs
less likely to bang into each other, or softer clubs that wouldn’t hurt so much
if they hit people in the head. And you would save this post in an idea file for
when you started writing AdWords ads. You might come up with an ad that
targets the problem you found:

Google Groups
To search Google Groups, go to http://groups.google.com. Google
Groups hasn’t been around as long as Yahoo! Groups, so you won’t find
Google communities as established as the Yahoo! ones. But Google Groups
get direct feeds from many of the independent “usenet” groups that have
existed since the late 1980s, and so provide much more comprehensive cov-
erage of the market. When you search Google Groups for juggling, you
don’t get the irrelevant listings that Yahoo! served up. The first groups
Google shows you are a unicycling group, a non-Google group called
rec.juggling (which I talk about in a minute), and a discussion list for the
Vancouver Juggling Club (shown in Figure 4-14).
To join a Google Group, click Apply for Group Membership on the right. If
you’re logged in to your Google account, you get taken to a signup page where
you choose your e-mail delivery schedule, provide a nickname, and apply.
Once you’ve been approved for membership, you can read and reply to mes-
sages, search the message archive by keyword, and post new questions.
Google formats its group messages on the Gmail template — meaning that
replies are kept next to the original message in chronological order. (See
Figure 4-15.)

The Yahoo! Juggling Group moderator sent a welcome e-mail informing me
that the group doesn’t get much activity these days, and if I wanted to be 
in the thick of the juggling watering hole, I should try www.jugglingdb.

Google. In fact, I already saw a link to this group for the Google Groups 
search results.
The first page of messages on that forum is shown in Figure 4-16.
Even before joining this group, you can read all the posts, search for mem-
bers by country (useful for figuring out geographic ad targeting in AdWords),
and look at the Juggling FAQs and lists of current vendors. If you’re starting
or expanding an online business, this sort of homework is required if you
prefer making money to gambling. And it’s so cheap and easy and quick, I
hereby grant you no excuses for not doing it.

The Blogosphere
When a technology merits a For Dummies book, you know it’s important.
Blogging has now achieved For Dummies status, with good reason. By July of
2006, Technorati was tracking over 50 million blogs, and estimated that
175,000 new blogs are created each day. Granted, many (most?) of these
blogs are completely irrelevant to everyone but their creator and two or
three friends, but that still leaves hundreds of blogs written by professionals
in any given industry for other professionals in that industry. Other blogs
touch on issues related to your product and service every now and then.
Blogs are great places to learn about your customers because, for some
reason, people write blogs like online diaries — little held back, little left to
the imagination. When they rant about a vendor or a product they don’t like,
they go all out. Also, bloggers love to link to and comment on one another’s
blogs in a particular market space, so true conversations develop.
Arguments, discussions, reviews, comparisons — read influential bloggers’
posts and you’ll quickly feel the pulse of a market segment’s desires.
How do you find the blogs and blog posts relevant to your business? Two
sites are particularly helpful: Technorati and Google’s Blog Search.
Technorati
Technorati is a search engine for blogs. Go to www.technorati.com and
enter your keyword at the top. Technorati gives you three ways to search for
blog posts:
 Search for posts with your keyword in the text: Choose In Blog Posts

I find the Blog Directory search to be most helpful — it returns a list of often-
influential blogs that deal with your market. The list in Figure 4-17 shows sev-
eral blogs that write about home gym equipment. If you’re selling home gym
equipment, go visit them (by clicking their URL) and find out what they’re rant-
ing about and what’s tickling their fancy. Pay attention to visitor comments, if
any (few comments probably means few readers and not much influence), and
follow the blogroll — the list of blogs that this blog thinks is important.

Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market

The top listing for Home Gym Equipment is a post called Track Your Walks.
Technorati shows us that 257 other blogs link to this one, making it highly
authoritative. When you click the post title, you’re taken straight to that post.
In this case, it’s the Walking expert for About.com at http://walking.
about.com. Since a lot of people read and rely on About.com for advice,
you’d want to read this blogger’s reviews of home exercise equipment before
entering that market.
You can sort the blogs by relevance (based on how closely the blog’s descrip-
tion matches your keyword) or by authority (a measure of how many other
blogs link to that blog). Because the Blogosphere represents a network, you
can usually find your way to the center of that network just by observing
who’s quoting whom. Blogging expert Dave Taylor (of www.askdavetaylor.
com) likens the Blogosphere to a giant party. The person in the middle of the
room surrounded by gaping hangers-on is probably the most influential
person. Sidle over to that group and you’ll learn a lot about your market. On
the other hand, you can also find blogs that don’t link to other blogs, that just
try to sell you stuff, that rant and rave but have no influence whatsoever.
That’s like a person loudly talking at a party, but no one is listening.
Technorati isn’t very smart about returning relevant search results in blog
posts — it will look at individual words rather than the meaning of the whole
phrase. If your keyword is more than one word, put quotes around your
search term to ensure that all the words appear together in the post.

Google blog search
http://blogsearch.google.com returns results not only from blogs, but
also online forums. It works just like a regular Google search, without the
Web pages, and sorted by relevance or date.
Say you invented a device that improves automobile and truck gas mileage
by adding supplemental hydrogen to the engine’s air intake valve. Enter your
big keyword, hydrogen boost, into Google’s Blog Search to return the
results shown in Figure 4-18.
Clicking the first post leads us not to a blog, but to a forum dedicated to
really big Toyota trucks and SUVs: www.ih8mud.com. The posts on the
forum indicated that many doubted whether the hydrogen-boost kit would
actually work as advertised, that the kit required too much power from the
alternator, and that price tag of $900 seemed too steep.
By reading over the posts, you can get a sense of the objections you’ll have
to overcome in your sales process. Second, you see the specifications that
you need to improve: Instead of 20–30 amps, can you design a unit that draws
only 8–10? Third, you see that $900 is more than this segment of the market is
willing to pay for a product like yours.

Loitering on Web sites
Your competitors’ Web sites are great places to learn what to do and what
not to do. When I talked about bid persistence earlier in this chapter, I advised
you to print out a list of the top AdWords advertisers in your market three
times over six weeks. Grab those printouts now, and circle the Web sites that
appear on all three pages — both the sponsored and organic listings. It’s time
to hang out with successful businesses and see what they’re up to.
First, look at your competitor’s Web site as if you’re a potential customer. Can
you find what you’re looking for? Does the site confuse or bore you? Is it easy
to contact the site owner and ask questions? Do you trust the site? Can you
order easily?
Remember that the home page may not be the landing page you get to by
clicking its ad. Check out its landing page, and see how it draws you in — or
not. Pay attention to how that landing page connects to the rest of the site.
Does it try to make a sale, or capture your contact information? What are the
featured products? What are their shipping and return policies?
Also, do other sites link to your competitor’s Web site? Google loves sites
with a lot of “inbound links.” You can find out who’s linking to a Web site by
typing link: and then the URL in Google. For example: link:www.
monkeybargym.com returns 71 linking pages (see Figure 4-19). The top few
are from the site itself, but the rest are from other Web sites. A high number
of inbound links will help to increase their organic Google traffic — as well as
decrease their PPC bid prices.
Sleeping with the enemy
But wait, there’s more! Don’t just float around on your competitors’ sites — if
you can afford it, become their customer. Get into their sales funnel. Discover
how they treat their customers, and whether (and how) they try to grow the
relationship. You may discover that their initial sale is a loss leader — that is,
they lose money on the front end because they have an effective system for
selling additional products on the back end.
Do they send e-mail offers for additional products? Do they give coupon
codes for dollars off? Do they request feedback? Do they ship promptly? Does
the merchandise do what they say it does?
So what do you do if your competitors do everything right? Here’s a little
online marketing secret: Your competitors are also your best potential busi-
ness partners. If you can figure out how to share customers, everyone can
increase profits by promoting different offers to different market segments.
You can play nice with competitors only when you can figure out ways to dif-
ferentiate yourself from them.

Cutting Through the Clutter 
with Positioning
You know how big your potential market is. You know how hungry they are.
You’ve discovered what they care about — and what frustrates them about
the existing situation and options. You’ve figured out what kind of pricing
structure and market response you need to be profitable. And you’ve scoped
out the competition to see what needs are not yet being filled.
Armed with this information, you’re now ready to construct the most impor-
tant sentence in the life of your business: your positioning statement.
Marketing master Ken McCarthy (TheSystemSeminar.org) explains position-
ing this way:
“Successful marketing is a multi-dimensional process. What do I mean by
that? Remember the three dimensional chess board featured on Star Trek?
Instead of one board and two dimensions, there were multiple boards on
different levels and pieces could move up and down in space as well as
backwards and forwards.

Chapter 4: Discovering Your Online Market

Many advertisers obsess about THEIR product and THEIR advertising. That’s
all well and good, but what these business owners fail to include in their
calculations is the total space of the market they hope to enter. Rarely do
prospects see only your product and your advertising. They’re usually aware
of other offers that — on the surface — appear similar to yours. Further,
because we’re all so busy and have so many things on our minds, we don’t
have a lot of extra processing power to think deeply about any company’s
offer.
Here’s the key: You can’t expect your prospects to do any heavy mental
lifting. If it’s not crystal clear why your offer is unique, it will be added to the
rummage sale pile in their minds where all the other products go that they
don’t quite understand and will probably never buy.
Your goal as a business is very simple: You want your offer to occupy a
completely unique place in the cubbyhole system of your prospect’s mind
and you want to figure out how to telegraph that unique value in seconds.
Better marketing and advertising is not just about building a better mousetrap
(or creating a better ad), it’s about figuring out where your offer fits in the
market space and why you’re uniquely qualified to hold a place in it, then
communicating that message simply and powerfully, over and over again.
Let me give you two examples of how this works. The ultimate romantic city
destination for lovers — what place pops into your mind? Probably Paris.
An innovative computer hardware company that’s especially friendly to
creative types — which company is already there staking out that space?
Probably Apple.
A good rule of thumb is that there’s probably only one space per category in
everyone’s mind. Second place is the same as last place.
Your mission as a smart marketer is to go boldly where few marketers tread
and figure out what place your offer can own and then make sure every ad
you run reinforces that message. Positioning is the thing that separates the
marketers who are standing on the winner’s platform from the ones who are
perennially treading water.”
Your ad copy, your Web site, your e-mails, the way you answer your 
telephone — all these marketing elements must flow out of your positioning.
The easiest way to establish top positioning is to carve up a market segment
that no one else has claimed. For example, there are many competing mer-
chants in the fitness space. That niche is far too big to attack with limited
resources. What about home gym equipment? Also big — and full of estab-
lished competitors. What about home gym equipment for parents with young
children? Indoor playgrounds the size of a home gym that both parents and
toddlers can enjoy safely — and that parents can use for a real workout while
watching their kids? No company I’ve ever heard of has told that story before.
94
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

If your research tells you that parents with young children are frustrated
about their exercise options, you may stake your fitness-industry positioning
on catering to that market. You may find that your initial idea doesn’t fly —
they don’t have enough room in their house for a gym that big, or they doubt
that it’s safe for kids. But as you watch the market, you’ll discover things they
will search for and buy. And your positioning, based on those discoveries,
will make you the obvious choice when they see your Google ad.
Ken McCarthy likens online market research to sitting next to a busy road
and watching the cars go by. First you find the potholes, by seeing what
people want and aren’t getting. Then you create products and marketing mes-
sages to fill those potholes.
This concept of positioning as the foundation of your entire business is hugely
important for your success, but if I gave it all the pages it deserves, this book
would be called Weightlifting For Dummies. Instead, I’ve asked Ken to make
his copywriting, positioning, and marketing strategies available online. Go to

Choosing the Right Keywords
In This Chapter
 Understanding the importance of keywords
 Reading your prospects’ minds through their search behavior
 Discovering tools for keyword research
 Mastering keyword formats and variations
 Discouraging the “wrong” people from visiting your site
 Increasing traffic by discovering new keywords
You’re in control of most parts of your online marketing. You write your
ads. You design and create your Web site. You write checks for advertis-
ing. You set your prices, hours of operation, and policies. But one of the most
important elements of your online strategy isn’t created by you at all, but by
your prospects: the keywords they use to search for your solution to their
problem. Your job isn’t to invent keywords, but to identify the keywords they
are already typing. If you can’t find those keywords, the AdWords game is
over before it starts. No keywords means no impressions, no clicks, no leads,
no sales.
After you’ve discovered those keywords, however, your job isn’t over. Now
you’ve got to figure out “the want behind the word.” Each keyword repre-
sents a different mindset — a different set of assumptions about how to fulfill
a need, and a different state of buying readiness. For example, the singular
and plural keywords can imply huge differences. Someone searching for used
car is probably closer to buying than someone who types used cars. The
plural searchers typically are at the early stages of their quest, while the sin-
gular searchers have, in their minds, a picture of one item that they’ll buy
when they find it.
I use the singular/plural example because it’s surprising, perhaps, that one
letter can make such a big difference. Other keyword variations, such as syn-
onyms, are equally significant:
 car versus auto
 used versus pre-owned

If you’ve ever received high-quality sales training, you know to pay attention
to prospect cues and clues before making your pitch. You might steer one
prospect to a 1991 Mustang convertible, a second to a 1985 Mercedes sedan,
and a third to a 2002 Odyssey minivan. With AdWords, your prospects’ key-
words are your only initial clues to their innermost desires. Different key-
words should trigger different ads, take prospects to different landing pages,
and make them different offers.
This chapter shows you how to interpret keywords to help you read your
prospects’ minds. Armed with this fundamental understanding, you’ll dis-
cover how to conduct keyword research to find the words and phrases that
will bring you qualified search traffic. You’ll learn how to manage your key-
word lists in AdWords, separating them into ad groups and using the positive
and negative keyword formats to get as many good prospects as possible
while discouraging nonbuyers from seeing and clicking your ads.
Decoding Keywords to Read
Your Prospects’ Minds
The golden rule of marketing, in my book (hey, this is my book — cool!), was
first articulated by Robert Collier in his 1934 book, The Robert Collier Letter
Book: “Join the conversation already going on in your prospects’ mind.” His
example: If you want to sell a winter coat to a man walking down the street
talking with a friend, don’t jump out and interrupt him with a statement
about what a great winter coat you’ve got here. Instead, start walking along
with the pair, listening and nodding at their conversation. Here and there ask
a question, offer a relevant comment, and watch for an opening. When talk
comes around to vacations, steer it gently to trips to cold climates. Once
your prospect is primed, you can show him your coat. (Please remember
that’s a metaphor, not a suggestion to lurk in doorways and stalk strangers!)
Since Google has not (yet) hooked up electrodes to our brains while we
browse the Web, the keyword is your best guide to the conversation already
going on in your prospects’ heads.
Perry Marshall of www.perrysmarshall.com is fond of saying that every
keyword represents an unscratched itch. We search to solve a problem.
Maybe we literally itch and are looking for an ointment. Maybe we’re bored
and are looking for excitement. Maybe we’re worried and looking for peace of
mind. Maybe we accidentally dropped our cell phone in a cup of coffee.
Maybe we want to find a summer camp for our kid. Whatever it is, the fact
that we’re searching means we don’t have enough information to take action
immediately. There’s a gap between what we know and what we need to know
in order to make a decision.

Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

www.squidoo.com, a nifty Web site created by Seth Godin, says it well:
We believe that when you go online, you don’t search. You don’t even find.
Instead, you are usually on a quest to make sense.
That’s the goal of most visits to Google or Yahoo! or blogs or Wikipedia.
How do you make sense of the noise that’s coming at you from all
directions?
You won’t take action, you won’t buy something, book something, hire
someone, or take a position on a political issue until you’ve made sense of
your options.
Searching online should really be called poking online. Because that’s what
you do. You poke around. You poke in Google and you poke at some ads.
After looking at a bunch of links and pages, then, finally, you get it. You
understand enough to take action — to buy something or make a decision.
Your mission as an AdWords advertiser is to help your prospects make sense
of their options. And to do it faster and more completely than anyone else. The
word client comes from the Middle Ages, where it originally meant, “person
seeking the protection or influence of someone powerful.” Think of yourself
as the expert in your market, the protector of the hordes of confused seekers,
the one who will take your prospects by the hand and guide them through the
hype and confusion and lies, and take them to the promised land of clarity
and truth.
Squidoo’s description suggests that “poking” is often inefficient because the
searchers encounter lots of false starts and dead ends, confusion, frustration,
and mistrust. What if you were able to figure out, just by the keywords they
used, where your prospects are and what paths they need to follow to
achieve understanding? Then you become their protector, and they become
your clients — trusting you to show them the next piece of information they
need to make a decision and act on it. That’s the ultimate goal of your
AdWords strategy — to show each prospect that you understand him or her,
and can give them what they want each step of the way — including the part
where they pull out a credit card and pay you for it. You achieve this goal by
learning how to interpret keywords. Your best teachers will be Google, your
own practice of empathy, and the data you collect.
Learn from Google
Google won the search-engine wars, in part, because it got very good at figur-
ing out what people were looking for based on what they were typing. And
the more data Google collects, the smarter it gets. Every time you perform a
Google search and click a link, Google follows you and adds your actions to
its database. It knows which sites you visit as part of your search. It knows
how long you stay and how many pages you browse. If the advertiser has
installed Google analytics or conversion tracking or Web site optimizer,
99
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

Google knows if you’ve signed up for a mailing list, or bought something, and
even how much you spent. The next time someone searches on that or a simi-
lar keyword, Google tweaks the search results to reflect what you told Google
through your actions.
To fully appreciate the differences that Google has discovered, try this experi-
ment: Perform a search on any keyword and print the first page of search
results. Then search for a synonym and print that page. Compare the two
pages — what percentage of the listings has changed? For example, try
searching for vermiculture and then its synonym worm farming.
If you take the time to visit the landing pages on each results page, you will
learn something of what Google knows about the mindset difference between
vermiculture and worm farming. Perhaps one group is professional,
while the other is made up of amateurs. Maybe vermiculturists are just worm
farmers with more education and higher credit limits. Could be that vermi-
culturists are into composting, while worm farmers are into selling fish bait.
(If I didn’t have 12 more chapters to write — and had some worm-farming
supplies to sell — I might spend the time to find out.)
If you are preparing to advertise your business on Google, researching the
keyword differences in your market will significantly increase your chances
for success.
Decision mindset
Perform Google searches for the top keywords in your market and scan the
results for clues. In particular, look for clues about what values will dominate
their decision-making process. What data will they consider before making a
decision, and how will they evaluate and prioritize that data? What’s the first
question they need answered to alleviate feelings of impatience, confusion, or
frustration?
The following subsections help you determine your potential customers’
mindsets.
Buyer or tirekicker
Are they serious about buying or just fantasizing? Big mansion sounds like
a dream, while 9 BR Colonial Princeton NJ looks like a serious quest.
Market-savvy or innocent beginner
Are they familiar with standard industry terms, or new to the industry? For
example, whenever I go to the home-improvement store, I have to describe
the tool or part I’m looking for with lots of hand gestures, analogies, and facial
contortions, because I don’t know the name of anything in the store except for
hammer, Snickers bar, and toilet-bowl flange (please excuse me as I process
100

this flashback). Whether I walk out with a frown or a ratcheting 11mm box
wrench depends on the patience, empathy, and experience of the clerk I
manage to find hiding in Aisle 53. (Do they hide from you, too, or it is just me?)
For example, someone who wants to make their own beer might search for
beer making or homebrew. The very fact that some folks are familiar with the
“insider” term homebrew suggests they are at least somewhat market-savvy.
The savvier the prospect, the more knowledgeable you must appear about the
market and the product choices. Even experts are looking for leadership.
Discretionary or nondiscretionary purchase
How badly does your prospect want or need what you’ve got? How hard do
you have to work to convince that person to buy? Imagine a long sales letter,
an e-mail follow-up course, a video demonstration, and an hour of audio testi-
monials for . . . a box of large paper clips. Overkill. Paper clips are an office
necessity, needed when they’re needed. Compare that to motivational
posters for the office, a product that didn’t even exist until some entrepre-
neur figured out that managers are lousy at motivating employees and would
pay money to get a picture to do it for them.
Problem-conscious or solution-conscious
For example, get more clients represents the problem (not enough
clients), while CRM software (CRM stands for Customer Relationship
Management) is one solution to that problem. Your ads can focus on prob-
lems (empathizing, agitating) or solutions (describing, proving, advocating).
Remember: Join the conversation already going on in your prospect’s mind.
Suppose that every prospect is searching for a solution, and you have a com-
peting solution to the same problem. In that case, you start by talking about
the solution they’re already thinking of. My Leads into Gold campaign does
this with prospects searching for cold calling scripts. One ad headline
reads, “Stop cold calling.” Another: “Cold Calling Doesn’t Work.” You can also
raise questions about the solution: “Does Cold Calling Work?” Or position
yourself as an expert above the fray: “Cold calling scripts compared.”
Solution-conscious shoppers think they know what they need, but are often
wrong. To the extent that your ads and Web site can educate them through a
consultative approach, you can shift them away from preconceptions that are
limiting their thinking. Problem-conscious shoppers typically open their
minds to a broader array of solutions.
Price shopping or feature shopping
If someone searches for Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR
Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 Lens (Black) you can bet
they’re looking for a price, shipping info, and a store they can trust. Compare
that to a search for 8 MP SLR digital camera — which indicates more of
an interest in general camera types (and possibly price ranges) than in spe-
cific brands and features.
101
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

Need it now or planning for future need
Your prospects’ time frame is important, because you always have a choice
to send them to a “buy now” page, or a “sign up for my 56-day e-mail course”
page. Don’t pitch a course on avoiding plumbing emergencies to someone
with a busted pipe flooding their basement. And don’t try, on the landing
page, to sell a luxury beachfront property in Tasmania to someone searching
for retirement property.
Sale or service
As I mention earlier in this chapter (unless you’re reading it backward, in
which case “retpahc siht ni retal noitnem I sa”), singular and plural keywords
often point to big differences in desired outcome. Someone who wanted to
teach a pet cockatiel to stop eating the curtains, for example, would probably
begin with cockatiel rather than with cockatiels. Someone looking to
buy several cockatiels would be more likely to begin with the plural.
Practice thinking like your prospect
Following the Google trail is a start. The next step is to put yourself into your
prospect’s head, walk a mile in their moccasins, see through their eyes, and
feel through their kidneys (or whatever), for all of them and each of them.
Why did they type those particular search terms at that moment? What went
through their minds during the seven seconds prior to the search? What
were the triggers? How long have they been thinking about this problem?
What tasks did they just interrupt to conduct this search? What environmen-
tal distractions are competing for their attention right now?
Who are they? What do they care about? What are their hopes, fears,
dreams? What are their deepest, most secret desires? Can I stop writing
romance-novel back-cover teaser questions?
The practice of market empathy is one of the hardest marketing tasks you’ll
ever have to accomplish. Before you can pretend to be someone else, you
first have to pretend you aren’t you. You, after all, are a very small but very
loud market sample, and the more you listen to yourself, the less room you
have in your brain for thinking about others. When you think your prospect
is the same as you, the “Market to Yourself Syndrome” follows: You speak in
industry jargon, you assume everyone knows the purpose and history and
significance of your product, and you believe everyone can see the dramatic
differences between your product and the competition. Since it’s obvious
you’re talking to yourself, your prospects politely ignore you.
The more words in the keyword phrase, the more information you have
about your prospect. Look at the following four-word keywords, each includ-
ing the words treatment for gout. What differences might exist in the
minds of the three different searchers?
102
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

 natural treatment for gout
 alternative treatment for gout
 symptom treatment for gout
I’m intrigued by the difference between “natural” and “alternative” — the two
terms overlap a lot. I feel the alternative seeker is more desperate than the
natural seeker. Natural implies high standards, while alternative tells me that
conventional treatments haven’t worked. “Symptom” may be a quick-fix tell, a
searcher who wants immediate relief rather than to address the root causes.
What can you do with this information? If my livelihood depended on selling
as much stuff as I could to these three people, I might craft my ad pitches
accordingly:

Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

Mastering the Three Positive
Keyword Formats
You can’t possibly guess all the variations of keywords your prospects will
type when they’re trying to find you. Fortunately, Google doesn’t force you to
be specific, although it allows you to be. AdWords lets you input positive key-
words (that is, keywords that will trigger your ad, as opposed to negative
keywords that will prevent your ad from showing) three different ways: broad
match, phrase match, and exact match. They look like this:
 Broad match: Buddha statue
 Phrase match: “Buddha statue”
 Exact match: [Buddha statue]
Broad match
Broad match keywords show your ad when the actual keyword is similar to
yours. Buddha statue shows for the following actual searches (note the dif-
ferences in spelling and capitalization):
 Buddha statue
 statue of the Buddha
 Buddah statue
 Korean statue of buddha
 Buddhist statues
Broad-match keywords are useful when you don’t know what people are
searching for, and you want to make sure you capture all relevant searches.
The downsides of broad matching are the inability to match ad copy to the
keyword, as well as lower CTR and higher bid prices.
Phrase match
Putting the broad match in double quotes converts it to phrase match, meaning
the characters between the quotes must appear exactly as they are somewhere
in the actual search. “Buddha statue” matches the following searches:
 Buddha statue
 “Buddha Statue”
104
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

 Chinese Buddha statue
 grinning Buddha statue
Phrase matches generally have higher CTR and lower CPC than broad matches,
because they eliminate synonyms and changes in tense, number, and order.
The most accurate matching occurs with the third syntax: exact matching.
Exact match
You indicate an exact match with square brackets, generally found to the
right of the P key on your keyboard. [Buddha statue] will only show for
the following searches:
 Buddha statue
 buddha Statue
 “Buddha statue”
Exact-match keywords are the most precise. You know exactly what the
searcher typed when you register an exact match impression.
If you include the broad, phrase, and exact matches of the same keyword in
your ad group, phrase trumps broad — and exact trumps both. In other
words, if your keyword list includes
 Buddha statue
 “Buddha statue”
 [Buddha statue]
and someone searches for life-sized Buddha statue, that searcher trig-
gers the phrase match (in quotes), but not the broad or exact match. And
Buddha statue triggers the exact match.
The goal: From vague to specific
Exact match is a powerful way to exclude searches you don’t want to attract.
But it’s a double-edged sword — exact match can also eliminate searches you
do want, but haven’t thought of yet. In a perfect AdWorld, the vast majority of
your traffic comes from exact matches (since this means you know what your
prospects are thinking and typing) and you still capture other relevant
searches. When you start advertising on AdWords, you may not have enough
traffic for your exact matches, so you’ll have to use broad- and phrase-match
keywords for a while. If you keep track of the actual search terms people use
105
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

to get to your Web site (see the later section, “Using your server log to get
smarter”), you’ll be able to replace broad-match keywords with the exact key-
words that triggered your ads.
Over time, you replace keyword guesswork with precise knowledge. For
example, if you sell used Toyota trucks and your only keyword is used
Toyota trucks, you may be getting traffic from a lot of other keywords,
including these:
 used Toyota pickup trucks
 used Toyota Tacoma trucks
 used Toyota trucks for sale
 used Toyota trucks for sale in Hawaii or Guam

After you start seeing these searches in your server log, you add them as
phrase- and exact-match keywords. The number of impressions for used
Toyota trucks goes down as these keywords pick up the slack. Eventually,
you may be able to retire your broad-match keywords entirely.
“Why would I want to retire my broad-match keywords?” I hear you ask. Well,
do you want to sell used Toyota trucks to customers in Guam or Hawaii?
(Remember, this is a hypothetical — I’m not assuming you sell used Toyota
trucks. Just play along, okay?) If not (say, because you’d have to ship the goods
overseas), then you’re attracting the wrong prospects — and needlessly lower-
ing your CTR and increasing your bid price for clicks. So how can you turn off
your ad for the Hawaii and Guam searchers? One solution, which I cover later
in this chapter, is the use of negative keywords. You can add -Hawaii to your
keyword list to tell Google, “Hide my ad if the word Hawaii is in the keyword.”
Oh, and you’ll have to do that for Guam as well. And maybe Papua, New
Guinea? Patagonia? Tikrit, Iraq? Instead of spending all your time defending
your CTR against every possible place name where you don’t want to do
business, you may eventually be able to eliminate these searches by choos-
ing only the keywords that qualified prospects are typing.
I show you how to move from vague to specific keywords later in this chap-
ter, in the “Sorting Keywords into Ad Groups” section.
Researching Keywords:
Strategies and Tools
In the perfect AdWords campaign, every click leads to a sale, and you don’t
miss any clicks that could have led to a sale. In real life, of course, such a
106
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

perfect campaign is impossible. But it’s the goal of everything you’re doing.
Your keyword selection represents a balancing act between hyper-aggressive
and hyper-conservative:
 Hyper-aggressive: If you choose every keyword in the universe, you
won’t miss anybody, but your CTR will be microscopic and your bid
prices will be astronomical.
 Hyper-conservative: If you bid only on the very obvious keywords,
you’ll miss a lot of sales from prospects who approach the search
process differently from you.
The ideal balance point is the one that maximizes your business goals, what-
ever they are. If you are advertising a for-profit business, your goal may
simply be the highest possible profits. You may sacrifice some profits for
quality of life, and go for the highest ROI. If you’re building a company to sell,
you may prefer to build a huge subscriber base to earning profits up front.
Whatever the goal, the same three-part strategy applies:
1. Start with the obvious keywords.
Make a list of the keywords you would search if you were your customer.
2. From there, go laterally into synonyms and related searches.
Conduct the research described in Chapter 4, use the Google Keyword
Suggestion Tool, and one or more of the tools described a little later in
this chapter.
3. Tweak or fire underperforming keywords — and keep looking for new
ones.
Part III shows you how to manage your AdWords campaigns to continually
improve your results.
Eventually, you’ll have a stable of reliably profitable keywords pointing to the
appropriate ads, taking visitors to effective Web sites.
The Free Keyword Tool
You can use the Free Keyword Tool (mentioned in Chapter 4 in the section on
the size and health of your online market) at www.askhowie.com/freewords
to generate related search terms. Simply type the main keyword in the box and
click Submit to receive a list of 100 related terms. You can research each of the
top 100 terms by clicking it — the tool will return the keywords (and their
search volumes) for all keywords that include the one you typed. You can
explore the keyword landscape, and download keywords to your computer
in a file that you can open in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel
or Google Spreadsheets.
107
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

Google’s keyword tools
In Chapter 4 you used the Google Keyword Tool that’s part of your AdWords
Standard Edition to get the “lay of the land” of your market. You can use that
tool to find thousands of keywords related to your main ones. Google searches
Web sites similar to yours and references its huge search database to help you
discover the words other people have used to get what you can give them.
KeywordDiscovery and WordTracker sites
These two Web-based services, available at www.keyworddiscovery.com
and www.wordtracker.com, respectively, are comprehensive and compet-
ing keyword research tools. Every serious AdWords user I know relies on one
of these not-so-cheap tools. They both give you hundreds — or thousands —
of keywords related to broad search terms. They tell you how many times the
keywords have been searched in the recent past. They allow you to down-
load keywords and counts into spreadsheets or text files. They let you create
projects to store your words.
Neither is cheap, although WordTracker thoughtfully offers a week-long sub-
scription for around $30.
Thesaurus tools
Remember the frantic high-school-essay writer’s best friend, Roget’s
Thesaurus? It got us through some pretty rough papers by giving us 12 ways
to say accomplish and 19 ways to say want. (Although my history teacher
thought hanker too colloquial and prefer too wishy-washy.) Well, the old the-
saurus is now online, in two free incarnations, and can lead you to keywords
you would otherwise miss.
Online Thesaurus
Go to http://thesaurus.reference.com to access the online version of
Roget’s New Millennium Thesaurus. Type your keyword (one word, generally)
into the text box near the top of the page and click the Search Button.
For example, when you type the keyword insurance, one of the synonyms,
coverage, can open up a huge new set of keywords. Just about anywhere
you can use insurance, you can now use coverage:
 health insurance and its synonym health coverage
 automobile insurance Omaha Nebraska and its synonym
automobile coverage Omaha Nebraska
108
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Every synonym in the online thesaurus is hyperlinked to a list of its syn-
onyms. Clicking coverage takes you to another set of results for the word
compensation.
For your purposes, the majority of thesaurus results are irrelevant. Look for
words that jog your brain into thinking, “Oh, that’s a good keyword, too.”
LexFN.com
The Lexical FreeNet connected thesaurus, located at www.lexfn.com, can
perform several cool tricks. Type a keyword into the Word 1 box, select the
Show related radio button, and click the Submit Query button. You will find
synonyms, words that are triggered by your word, more specific and more
general categories related to your word, and words that are part of your key-
word and words that your keyword is a part of, as shown in Figure 5-1.
If you sell stage makeup for theatrical performers, several of the results of
this LexFN search will point you in promising directions (greasepaint, for
example), while others will help you brainstorm negative keywords (see the
later section, “Deploying Negative Keywords”).
KeyCompete.com
If you’re serious about using AdWords, KeyCompete.com is one of several
paid tools I recommend highly. Go to www.keycompete.com and type a key-
word in the search box; then click the Search button. You’re taken to a list of
Web sites bidding on that keyword, as shown in Figure 5-2. Click any of the
Web site links to see a long list of their other keywords.
In other words, if your competitor has done a good job of researching key-
words, you can use this sneaky tool to take advantage of all their hours of hard
work. You can buy individual keyword results for $5, or purchase a single day’s
access for $19. An annual subscription is $299. If you need to compete against
established competitors in an AdWords market, this tool is a no-brainer.
Using your server log to get smarter
Quietly, uncomplainingly, your Web site has been storing a gold mine of visitor
data, patiently waiting for you to realize its value. If your Web site has been wel-
coming visitors for any length of time and you haven’t perused your server log
yet, you’re in for a treat. Among lots of other useful data, your server log will
tell you exactly what search terms visitors typed to land on your site. All the
tools I’ve talked about in this section are useful as idea generators — but only
your server log tells you exactly what keywords are already getting people to
your site.

Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Because Web servers differ significantly, unfortunately I can’t tell you exactly
how to find and read your own server logs. If you are technically savvy about
your Web site, you already know where to find the server log. If you’re not
sure how to view your server logs, contact your hosting provider.
What you want to look for in your server logs are the key phrases and key-
words that people typed into a search engine just before visiting your site.
You want to select a reporting period that makes sense (last month, last year,
and so on). Figure 5-3 shows the server logs for key phrases and keywords
that lead visitors to my site, www.leadsintogold.com, for one year. Some
of the keywords with very few clicks are potential long-tail keywords I can
add to my AdWords campaigns.
Long-tail keywords refer to phrases that are rarely typed, and will therefore
bring you very few visitors, but collectively can generate many sales. The con-
cept of the long tail (the phrase itself refers to the shape of the graph of the
statistical distribution of events) was popularized in the book The Long Tail,
by Chris Anderson, who argued that in a digital world with no production or
shipping costs, the combined profits generated by long-tail products can be
greater than the profits from the blockbuster bestsellers. Amazon.com, for
example, can be more profitable than brick and mortar bookstores because
such a large proportion of Amazon’s sales come from obscure books that
physical stores wouldn’t be able to stock due to shelf space limits.

111
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

Similarly, long-tail keywords, as long as you don’t spend too much time gener-
ating or managing them, can give you the slight edge that leads to market
domination over time. Here’s how: The long-tail keywords are very cheap,
with almost no competition. This traffic stream lowers your average bid
price, giving you more visitors for the same amount of money. Assuming you
convert these visitors to sales at a rate equal to or higher than that of your
other visitors (a pretty good assumption, since they’re coming in on very tar-
geted and specific keywords), you make more money per visitor. You can
afford to advertise more — and to pay more for advertising — compounding
your slight edge into a real lead. Finally, the increased traffic means you can
split-test and improve all the elements of your sales process (see Chapter 13
for more on split-testing) more rapidly than your competition, leapfrogging
you ever farther ahead over time.
Finding Sneaky Variations
for Fun and Profit
So far you’ve been looking at semantic variations — keywords with similar
but slightly different meanings. Now you can explore the wide world of
sneaky variations — slight keyword tweaks that can mean the difference
between lackluster and sizzling campaigns.
Some quick ways to vary keywords
For openers, here are a couple of simple sources of keyword variation — geo-
graphic location and human typographical error:
 Geography: As we saw in the used Toyota trucks example, keywords
sometimes include geographical terms. If you ship home gym equipment
anywhere in the U.S., you want to capture searches for home gym
Alaska to home gym Vermont. You may even want to get more granular
than the state level: home gym Chicago and Chicago home gym.
 Misspellings: Let’s face it — we all couldn’t win the spelling bee in ele-
mentary school. And we’re often typing so quickly, we mess up wodrs
and phraess (oops) as we search. Don’t take my word for it — check out
this hilarious page, courtesy of Google, that lists the misspelled
searches for Britney Spears over a three-month period:
http://www.google.com/jobs/britney.html
112
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

If you bid on misspellings that your competitors ignore, you have a twofold
advantage:
 Significantly decreased competition: When I search for low
cholesterol recipes in Google, I find 12 sponsored listings. When
I enter low cholesterol recipies I see only two. Ten advertisers,
including heavyweight Lipitor.com (a Pfizer Web site about its choles-
terol medication), did not think to show their ad for a common mis-
spelling. You have a much higher chance of compelling a click if you’re
in a beauty pageant against only one or two other competitors.
 Lower CPC: Because there’s less competition, you don’t have to bid as
much to appear on the coveted first page. In the low cholesterol
recipies example, the misspelled keyword costs about half as much as
the correctly spelled term.
Misspellings won’t generate huge search traffic. The Britney Spears example
shows the correct spelling receiving almost half a million searches, and the
most popular misspelling (britanny) getting 10% of that. Most of the misspelled
keywords (have you ever noticed how the word “misspelled” just doesn’t look
right?) occurred four times or fewer. The goal in using misspellings isn’t to
double your traffic. Instead, it’s to lower your average cost of customer acquisi-
tion. The goal of the AdWords game — as with a lot of business — is to turn
cheap raw materials (in this case, clicks) into valuable products (in this case,
hungry customers with working credit cards). You can use misspellings to
lower your average CPC slightly and increase your traffic slightly, which gives
you slightly more money to spend on advertising and slightly more traffic to
run through your split-testing machine (see Chapter 13) — and become slightly
better at turning visitors into customers. The cumulative effect of all these
slight advantages is enough to snowball into market dominance.
Let’s say you bid on one keyword only: mortgage. To show in Ad Position 6,
you must bid an average of $1.45. Assuming 1852 clicks, you pay a total of
$2,685.40.
Your competitor can also afford to bid an average of $1.45, but let’s say they
also bid on the term morgage. They must bid $0.23 to show in position 6, and
they receive only 14 clicks on the misspelling. They pay an extra $3.22 for
those clicks, giving them a grand total of 1866 clicks for $2,688.62 (your total
plus their extra 14 clicks). Their average CPC is $1.44 — one cent lower than
yours. That single penny, over many thousands of clicks, can put them firmly
in Position 6, while you can only afford Position 7. Now they get more clicks
than you because they’re closer to the top of the page. Their CTR may be in a
higher postition, so their quality score shifts to reflect the improved perfor-
mance. Their bid price, relative to yours, goes lower again. One misspelled
keyword won’t make much difference, but if you take the time to discover a
few dozen more discount variations, you can convert that slight edge into a
significant advantage.
113
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

Different versions
If you sell different versions of the same basic product, you will improve your
CTR by including specific search terms. A business selling light bulbs might
bid on the following general terms:
 fluorescent light bulb
 compact fluorescent light bulb
 flood light
 floodlight
 lightbulb
 floursescent bulb
Their customers may be searching for much more specific items:
 36” fluorescent light bulb
 dimmable compact fluorescent light bulb
 14 watt compact fluorescent light bulb
 red 150 watt flood light
 green 150 watt flood light
If you sell 20 different colors or shapes or sizes or types of a product, be sure
to include all those variables in your keyword list.
Different points of view
A realtor may advertise for the keyword real estate Carrboro NC
and miss the following keywords that include the perspective of different
searchers:
 buy real estate Carrboro NC
 buying real estate Carrboro NC
 sell real estate Carrboro NC
 selling real estate Carrboro NC
 looking for real estate Carrboro NC
 shopping for real estate Carrboro NC
 house hunting real estate Carrboro NC
A regular verb and a gerund (the verb with -ing at the end) can signify com-
pletely different mindsets. Until you’re sure you don’t want the customer with
a particular mindset, include them all.
114
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Singular and plural
The difference between a singular and plural word can mean a lot of things.
Sometimes, people looking for information type the plural (digital 
cameras), while more serious shoppers use the singular (digital
camera). If the plural keyword is significantly cheaper to bid on than the sin-
gular, you know that other advertisers have found it harder to make money
from the less-expensive keyword. If you optimize your sales process to bring
the information-seeker to the point of purchase, you can take advantage of
the cheap, plentiful “pre-transaction” keywords such as general plural terms.
.com
Every year, the number of Internet users grows. Since a steady stream of Web
newbies are searching for your products, you can profit by knowing the
search “mistakes” they often make. Web neophytes can confuse the Google
Search box with the Address Bar (where you type the URL of the Web site).
So if you sell red flood lights, you can snag some inexpensive traffic by bid-
ding on (say) redfloodlights.com.
LowerYourBidPrice.com — sneaky 
keywords made easy
I’ve developed a keyword-manipulation tool, the AdTool, which makes it easy
to generate thousands of “sneaky” keyword variations from a single keyword.
You can add U.S. cities and states before and after all your keywords, you can
substitute synonyms with the click of a button, you can add hundreds of mis-
spellings, convert singular to plural and vice versa, add .com to the end of
your keyword, and add quotes and brackets automatically (if you’re as bad a
typist as I am, this one feature will save you hours).
Let’s say you’ve brainstormed 1000 keywords that all contain the word
mortgage. Now you discover that 5% of searchers spell mortgage without a
“t” as morgage. The AdTool will let you replace mortgage with morgage in
all 1000 keywords — and add those new 1000 keywords to your campaigns.
You can also use it to generate hundreds of keyword phrases using the phrase
combiner. For example, someone who sells collegiate team clothing might sell
20 different items (hats, jerseys, sweatshirts, and so on) related to 12 different
sports (baseball, basketball, lacrosse, and so on) for 150 colleges and universi-
ties (Duke, UNC, Princeton, and so on) 20 × 12 × 150 = 36,000 keywords.
In Figure 5-4, I’ve included four colleges, five sports, and five items. The
AdTool instantly generated 209 variations, including two-word phrases like
Duke hat and Princeton sweatshirt.
115
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

The AdTool is available for a full-featured 21-day trial for $3.95 at www.
loweryourbidprice.com. It includes many other features that I don’t want
to hurt your brain with right now. But since I developed it for my own per-
sonal use, it’s grown to do just about everything I recommend in this book.
Sorting Keywords into Ad Groups
After you’ve generated your keywords, your next step is to organize them
into ad groups. Your mission, should you choose not to waste money and
time, is to match your ad closely with the keywords in that group. In the first
part of this chapter, I emphasize that each keyword has a mindset that goes
with it. The mindset represents what the searcher wants and how she or he
wants it; if you put all your keywords into a single ad group, you can’t write
an ad that will appeal to all those different mindsets. I’ll give you six reasons
to organize your keywords into coherent groups:
 You can scratch the right itch: Perry Marshall puts it this way: “Think of
a group of keywords as a bundle of desires. Some desires go together
better than others. Some are alike and some are very different. Each ad
group must clump together the most similar desires, so the ad can
mimic and inflame those desires. You want every one of the people who
views your ad to say, ‘Yeah, that’s for me.’”
Say you run an online golf store, selling clubs, balls, bags, shoes,
instructional books and videos, training aids, and so on. You can bid
on thousands of keywords and send them all to your home page,
www.jimsgolfemporium.com. The keywords could include
• golf
• golf clubs

116
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

• putters
• golf shoes
• improve your golf swing
• improve your golf game
• correcting a slice in golf
and many others. Each of these keywords represents an “itch.” The
search results page is nothing other than a race among all the listings to
scratch that itch first. If your ad is a generic golf ad, you can’t compete
with an ad that names the itch and promises to scratch it good.
If you had typed left-handed titanium drivers, which headline
would catch your eye — Golf Clubs and Clothing or Lefty Titanium
Drivers?
The big reason to separate similar keywords into ad groups — to show
an ad that scratches the itch — is supported by other reasons:
 Google bolds keywords in the search results: Type any word or phrase
into Google and look at the results page. Every keyword you typed
(except for a, an, the, for, and suchlike) appears in bold in every listing,
whether sponsored or organic. Bold text catches the searcher’s eye.
 Talk to your prospects in their language: If your prospect is searching
for foods that prevent gout and you put that exact phrase in the
headline, you’ve scored an empathy point. The way they search is the
way they talk to themselves. Tap into their lingo and you demonstrate
understanding.
 Improve your ads by split testing: If you don’t segment your market,
you’re missing key split test data. Maybe you have two ads running neck
and neck (see Chapter 13 for the details on split testing), with a CTR of
1.4. In actuality, Ad #1 has a CTR of 3.6 with people who typed tiger
woods putter and only 0.03 with people who typed golf shoes.
 Show visitors the right landing page: The golfer searching for left-
handed titanium drivers doesn’t want to land on your home page and
have to play hide-and-seek with your site navigation. Google has made
us impatient and lazy — your visitors will go back to Google before
trying to make their way through a confusing site. With a tight ad group,
you can send all the traffic to a perfectly matched landing page — either
for a selection of left-handed titanium drivers, or the best-selling men’s
and women’s drivers, or an article on how to choose a left-handed tita-
nium driver. The easier you make it for your visitors, the more likely
they are to follow your lead.
 Easy campaign management: Managing different ad groups is easier
than handling one larger group. If your AdWords campaign consists of
1000 keywords, all in one ad group, you’ll have a miserable time trying
to manage that campaign. You’ll have trouble comparing keyword per-
formance because you’ll have too much data to look at. You may end up
spending time inputting keywords you already have but can’t find.
117
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

Divide keywords into concepts
Separating the list of golf keywords into concepts, or “bundles of desires,” you
get big groups and smaller groups within the big groups. The big buckets are
 Clubs
 Accessories
 Clothing
 Instruction
You can divide, say, Clubs into the following categories:
 Left-handed and right-handed
 Men’s and women’s and juniors’
 Putters, drivers, fairway woods, irons, and wedges
 Power and accuracy
 Different brands
The combination of these splits could be the ad groups:
 Left-handed men’s putters
 Right-handed women’s drivers
 Junior fairway woods
For accessories, a big subcategory is “golf balls.” Your ad groups are prob-
ably named for the brands. Pay special attention to the most-searched
brands.
Don’t get paralyzed here, looking for the one right way to organize your key-
words. You can’t know for sure at this point. Your data will help you optimize
your campaign over time — right now, take your best guesses (the market
research described in Chapter 4 will help here), and create ad groups that
are tight enough to be coherent and not so numerous as to defy effective
management.
Spend more time on the high-traffic keywords than the long tails. Think of the
high-traffic keywords as your prize pumpkins, the ones that can win you a
gold medal at the state fair. The low-traffic keywords are the apples on the
trees in the orchard — collectively, they are valuable, but you couldn’t spend
10 minutes a day on each apple.
118
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Organizing your keywords
I manage my keywords for all my AdWords campaigns with three tools: a text
editor, the AdTool (from www.loweryourbidprice.com), and Microsoft
Excel.
Step 1: Collect keywords with a text editor
As I’m doing my initial market research, I just copy and paste all my key-
words into a text file. Your PC or Mac almost certainly comes with a text
editor. Notepad is bundled with PCs and can be accessed by choosing
Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪Notepad. On the Mac, the default editor is
called TextEdit, and can most easily be found by typing textedit into the
Spotlight search box at the top right and choosing the application called
TextEdit. I prefer a simple text editor to a complicated word processing pro-
gram like Microsoft Word because the word processors sometimes add funny
stuff (formatting commands, invisible characters, whatever) to the text. With
plain text, what you see is what you get.
If you’re so familiar with Word that you can’t bear the thought of learning
another program, just save the Word file as .txt instead of .doc in the drop-
down menu in the Save screen. Don’t forget to save the text file somewhere
you can find it easily — and remember: Word won’t show you files that end in
extensions other than .doc unless you specifically ask it to.
Step 2: Input the words into the AdTool and generate new ones
Copy the keywords list in your text editor and paste them into the AdTool. You
can then Peel and Stick the Keywords into individual Excel sheets by ad group.
One of the AdTool’s tabs is called Peel & Stick. This phrase entered the
AdWords landscape courtesy of Perry Marshall, who used it initially to
describe the process of removing a single keyword from an ad group and
building a new ad group around that one key keyword. More broadly, peeling
and sticking refers to tightening ad groups by moving keywords into new ad
groups — and writing ads that more specifically target those keywords.
The AdTool’s Peel and Stick function allows you to peel keywords out of your
giant keyword bucket according to common words or letters.
After you’ve generated all your keywords, go to the Peel & Stick tab. Choose a
word that is contained by all the keywords you want to peel out of the big
group. For example, suppose I peel keywords containing course for the golf
ad campaign and then e-mail them to myself. I can then stick them straight
into AdWords, edit them further, or save them for future work. For that
matter, instead of e-mailing the list, I could copy it to my Clipboard and paste
it into a text or spreadsheet file.
119
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

Step 3: Sort the keywords with Excel
I use Excel to help me view my keywords as sorted by ad group. The first
sheet is my summary sheet. It includes the names of all my ad groups, and
the search volume for each group. Figure 5-5 shows a very neat division of ad
groups in the Golf Lesson market, courtesy of Glenn Livingston of
www.ultimateadwordsresearch.com.
Each subsequent sheet shows the keyword list for that ad group, as in
Figure 5-6.
A spreadsheet laid out this neatly makes it a breeze to input the keywords into
AdWords. Just select column A by clicking the A at the top of the column,
copy the entire column, and paste it into the AdWords Add Keywords tool.
Go to www.askhowie.com/keywords5 for a video demonstration of using
Excel for keyword management.
Use each keyword only once in your AdWords account. If you include the
same keyword in two different ad groups, or campaigns, Google will show
only one ad, based on the keyword’s quality score. Google won’t let you com-
pete against yourself by showing both ads. Also, when you have duplicate
keywords, your campaign management becomes a mess. You can’t be sure
how much traffic your keywords are getting, because the traffic is divided
among your ad groups. If you want to delete a nonperforming keyword, you
have to hunt for it in more than one place. So begin your account with a clean
structure; you’ll find it easy to follow through with best practices later on.

Deploying Negative Keywords
In the movie The Verdict, Paul Newman plays Frank Galvin, an outgunned
lawyer representing an injured client in a medical malpractice lawsuit. When
Galvin realizes that the defendant is hiding incriminating evidence, he
requests delivery of the damning documents. The defendant delivers the evi-
dence in a way that ensures (he hopes) it won’t be found before trial —
buried somewhere in truckloads of meaningless paper. Your AdWords traffic
is the same — there are a few gems (your future customers and referrers)
buried in a giant stream of nonbuyers. Negative keywords are your first line
of defense, a filtration system that keeps the wrong folks away while letting
the right folks see your ad.
Let’s say you sell wooden kits for building bat houses. You bid on the key-
words bat and bats and discover that, for some reason, you’re getting large
numbers of impressions but very low CTRs. What’s going on? Are your ads
ineffective? Maybe. But the first problem you’ve got to solve is related to key-
words, not ads.
Who else might be searching for bat or bats? Go to www.lexfn.com and
type bat in the search box labeled Word 1. Click Submit Query, as shown in
Figure 5-7.
Baseball, cricket, and squash fans are also typing bat into Google, without
the remotest interest in attracting mosquito-eating flying mammals by build-
ing houses for them. The actual search numbers for the top 10 bat-related
keywords, according to LowerYourBidPrice.com, are shown in Table 5-1.

If you are bidding on bat as a broad match, you’re going to show your ad to a
lot of the wrong people. If they don’t click, they don’t cost you money directly,
but by lowering your CTR, they have a negative impact on your quality score.
The lower your quality score, the more you need to bid to remain in a desirable

position. Fortunately, Google provides a solution to help you filter out traffic
you don’t want: negative keywords.
Negative keywords are words and phrases that automatically disqualify your
ad from showing should they appear in a search. In the bat house example,
you would designate the following negative keywords:
 baseball
 softball
 ball
 easton
 milken
You don’t need to include base ball or soft ball because ball already
takes care of all variations in which ball is a separate word.
Brainstorming negative keywords
You should spend some serious time finding negative keywords. One of the
most common and costly AdWords mistakes is focusing all your attention on
positive keywords. Positive keywords bring you traffic, while negative key-
words filter it for you so only the quality searchers ever get to your ad. A
comprehensive list of negative keywords will increase the quality of your traf-
fic and improve your CTR significantly. Several sources of negative keywords
are discussed in the following subsections.
Thinking about who isn’t your customer
No database or tool can replace your own insight and common sense. For
example, bath house may be a reasonable typo of bat house — you may
want to include the negative keyword bath. Consider other searches that
may be triggered by your broad-match keywords. Do you want to show your
ad to people concerned about bat bites, for example? They may be searching
for an exterminator or a medical Web site, but perhaps you can entice them
with an ad like this:
Bat Problems?
Don’t kill them - Help them move!
Bat House Kits - vs. Yard Pests.
www.BatHouseKits.com
If your best efforts at selling to bite keywords fail, then turn bite into a nega-
tive keyword and move on.

You can generate a more complete list by looking at the top 100 search terms
from the free LowerYourBidPrice.com tool. What searches are unrelated to

Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

your market or your offering? Include those as negative keywords to keep
those searchers away.
Searching Google for negative keywords
For example, a Google search on bat brings up the following concepts, all
unrelated to flying mammals:
 British American Tobacco (BAT) company
 The BAT! Email Client
 Balanced Audio Technology
 Infogrip BAT Keyboard
 Brockton Area Transit (BAT) Authority
 BATch files
Finding negative keywords with the AdWords keyword tool
First, go to the ad group you’re working on, by logging in to your account,
and choosing the campaign and ad group from the Campaign Summary
screen. From within that ad group, click the Keywords Tab and select the
Keyword Tool. Enter your keyword, making sure the Use Synonyms check
box is checked, and click the Get More Keywords button. (See Figure 5-8.)

124
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

In this example, the suggestion tool yields several more negatives:
 file
 glove
 gloves
 command
What about guano and vampire? Both terms relate to your kind of bat, but
may bring you high school students looking for articles to rip off for term
papers (or, for that matter, Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans). Can you turn them
into customers? Perhaps — but you’ll want to keep these traffic streams sepa-
rate from the others so you can send them to the appropriate landing pages
(and then track your success).
Adding negative keywords
Add negative keywords quickly to your keyword list by clicking the Keywords
tab from within an ad group, then selecting Quick Add, just below the date
range. You add negatives to your keyword list by typing a hyphen before the
word or phrase, as shown in Figure 5-9.

125
Chapter 5: Choosing the Right Keywords

Adding, Deleting, and Editing Keywords
All these keywords won’t do you any good until you place them in your ad
groups. If you’ve opened up an AdWords account, you have at least one key-
word in each ad group. Here’s a look at how to add, subtract, edit, and
manage keywords in the individual ad-group interface.
Log in to your AdWords account and navigate to an individual ad group. Click
the Keywords tab at the right to view the list of all your keywords, as shown
in Figure 5-10.
Growing your keyword list
In your AdWords account, you can add keywords to your ad group in two ways:
 Quick Add: Add keywords by clicking the Quick Add link, just above the
keyword list. Google gives you a text box into which you can type or
paste keywords, one word or phrase per line, as shown in Figure 5-11.
You can add them straight away by clicking the Save button, or you can
see how much traffic Google expects to give you for each of them by
clicking the Estimate Search Traffic button.
Don’t worry about adding a keyword that you already have in your ad
group — Google kindly filters out duplicates for you.
 Keyword Tool: The Keyword Tool link, next to the Quick Add link,
allows you to type or paste keywords or let Google do it for you.
I strongly recommend using Google’s vast keyword capabilities before
you get to this point. Don’t let Google add words directly into your
account. Instead, use this tool to generate lots of keywords, and then
manipulate and filter them in a text file or spreadsheet.
Editing your keywords
Click the Edit Keywords link (next to the Keyword Tool link) to bring up your
entire list in a text box. Here you can remove, add, and change keywords, as
well as change your default bid (the amount you’ll pay for a click unless you
set specific maximum CPCs for individual keywords). Note that negative key-
words do not trigger bids, so you don’t need to worry about bid prices for
them.
Below the Save Changes button, Google instructs you on changing cost-per-
click bids and destination URLs manually. That’s right — each non-negative
keyword can have its own bid and its own landing page.

Individual CPC bids
Use Google’s syntax keyword**0.25 to override your default bid for a spe-
cific keyword (see Figure 5-12 for an example). You can accomplish the same
task much faster, with less possibility of typing or syntax error, through the
Edit Keywords interface on the main ad group page.
To change bids easily and safely, select the keyword or keywords you want to
re-bid by clicking the check box to the left of each keyword. To select all the
keywords, check the Keyword check box at the top of the column. Now click
the Edit Keyword Settings button just above the keyword column to find a
page like the one shown in Figure 5-13.

Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Change bids by replacing the number next to the currency sign. Google tells
you which bids are too low to show on page 1, marking each one with a V icon.
Individual landing pages
You can change destination URLs (landing pages) for each keyword as well.
Since each keyword represents a slightly different mindset — and buying
readiness — the perfect AdWords campaign would send each visitor to a
landing page tailored specifically to his or her keyword. In a perfect world,
however, you would have so much money you wouldn’t be reading this book
(and I would be playing Ultimate Frisbee instead of writing this book), so let’s
not get carried away by fantasies of unlimited resources. Fact is, you have a
certain amount of time to spend on AdWords, and no more. Creating individ-
ual landing pages for low-traffic keywords is not the best way to spend your
precious AdWords minutes.
At this point, you may be wondering why Google bothers you about different
landing pages at the same time you set your bids. It’s because the fit among
your keyword, ad, and landing page helps determine your ad’s Quality Score —
which determines your minimum CPC for Google and the search network. In
other words, if your ad isn’t showing on the first page of search results, your
only option isn’t to raise your bid. You can also improve your ad, improve your
landing page, and find a better keyword. Raising your bid is simply the quickest
and least time- and energy-consuming way to get back onto the first page.
In the old days (pre-2004), Google would disable keywords that didn’t achieve
a minimum 0.5% CTR. Now they impose a lazy-tax on advertisers who show
uncompelling ads that invite searchers to unhelpful and irrelevant landing
pages. So instead of being disabled, your ads are now dubbed Inactive. Like a
maitre d’ angling for a tip to get you a table at a “full” restaurant, Google
holds out its palm and says, “You wanna show your ad to my people? That’ll
be 10 bucks a click.”
In the Edit Keywords tool, you can change the URL after a keyword, like so:
keyword**http://www.yoururl.com/xyz
In Figure 5-14, I’ve added two keywords whose traffic I’m sending to
www.leadsintogold.com/fa, a Web page I set up specifically for financial
advisors who work for big houses such as Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley.
In the Edit Keyword Settings screen, change destination URLs by typing the
new URL in the long text box next to http://.

his sentence contains the same number of characters — 130, including
spaces — that Google allows you in an ad.
You get four lines of 25, 35, 35, and 35 characters to tell enough of your story
to compel the right people to choose your ad over all the other ads and
organic listings on the Google search page. If you’re advertising on the con-
tent network, your ad is competing with articles, videos, games, and more.
I’ve heard professional copywriters say that the Google ad is the most chal-
lenging form of salesmanship-in-print they’ve ever attempted.
Depressed? Don’t be. Writing effective ads is hard for everyone, not just you.
Spend some time preparing, practicing, and (especially) testing your ads, and
you’ll quickly rise to the top of your industry. As business philosopher Jim
Rohn says, “Don’t wish it were easier — wish you were better.”
This chapter helps you stop wishing and start improving. First, I explain the
three-pronged goal of your ad. Most advertisers focus on one prong only, to
their detriment. You discover how to balance the first two goals for maximum
profits by bringing in the right kind of traffic (not just the maximum possible
traffic), and how to reach the third goal of setting visitor expectations so
your prospects are primed for your Web site. Next, you discover how to tune
your ad to your prospect’s radio station, WII-FM (What’s In It For Me?), based
on their keyword. I share with you the missing link between your ad and your
Web site — the call to action. I cover some basic strategies for effective ad
writing, as well as a few top-secret (until now!) “black belt” techniques that

you’ll need if you’re playing in a hyper-competitive market. Finally, I intro-
duce you to some alternatives to the standard text ad: image, mobile text,
local business, and video ads.
Understanding the Three 
Goals of Your Ad
A good ad attracts the right people — your best prospects — to your Web
site. Your ad has three goals:
 Generating clicks from qualified visitors
 Discouraging the people who are unlikely to become your customers
from clicking your ad
 Setting your prospects’ expectations so that your Web site satisfies 
(and possibly even delights) them
The following sections discuss these three goals in detail.
Attracting the right prospects while
discouraging the wrong people
The AdWords medium encourages a stepladder approach. The job of the ad
is to deliver a drooling prospect to your Web site. They don’t even have to be
drooling over what you want to sell them, just over what you’re offering them
in the ad. Sometimes the ad offer and the first sale are identical — selling a
product they’re searching for by name and model. Other times, you’re dan-
gling a magnet that will attract the quarters and ignore the wooden nickel. (I
talk more about lead-generating magnets in Chapter 10.)
Your four-line ad can’t make a sale, any more than a door-to-door salesperson
can ring the doorbell, utter one sentence, and sell a $1000 vacuum cleaner. The
first sentence is meant to make the prospect listen to the second sentence.
Likewise, the Google ad isn’t long enough to capture the prospect’s attention,
pique their interest, stroke their desire, and make them pull out their credit
card. Let your Web site and e-mails and phone calls accomplish the heavy lift-
ing. Craft your ad to make or imply a promise that your landing page can keep.
The rest of this chapter shows you how to write an attractive ad. Right now,
though, I’m going to tell you how to make your ad unattractive. After all, a
click means you just paid Google. Clicks from the wrong people can cost you
a lot of money without putting any of it back in your pocket.
132
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

You may remember magazine ads that featured a huge red headline of the
word sex, with the subhead, “Now that I’ve got your attention . . .” The ad
would go on to sell some product totally unrelated to the headline. Similarly,
many people use names of celebrities (Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, for
example) in their ads to grab attention. Don’t try that with AdWords. In
cyberspace, folks are serious about their searches. If they feel misled by your
ad, they’ll cost you a click and never visit you again. For example:
Free Britney Spears Pics
Hundreds of exclusive photos
and videos - all completely free!
www.BootzRus.com/BritneyGoesWild
If your site actually sells custom inserts for cowboy boots, this ad will almost
certainly achieve a higher CTR than the more traditional ad that follows:
Custom Cowboy Boot Inserts
Instant relief of bunions and corns
Cures athlete’s foot - free shipping.
www.BootzRus.com/CowboyBootInserts
But how qualified is the traffic from the first ad? Aside from their anger at
being duped when they arrive at a site featuring cowboys with corns and not
the celebrity gossip or racy pictures they expected, how likely would they
have been to want boot inserts in the first place?
The Britney mistake doesn’t usually look that stark and ridiculous, but I see it
all the time in my clients’ campaigns. Big promises are great, but when they’re
too vague, they attract the wrong people. For example, Nova-Mind.com sells
mind mapping software to help writers and others brainstorm creatively and
efficiently. Here’s an ad I made up that would probably beat all their other ads’
CTRs, but wouldn’t lead to many sales:
Be More Creative
Amazing Technique Helps You
Brainstorm Brilliant Ideas
www.Nova-Mind.com
This ad promises a big benefit — one that the software theoretically can
deliver on — but doesn’t qualify the benefit with any information that would
allow someone to say, “Oh, that’s not for me.”
Here’s one of their real ads:
Mind Map Software
Organize your Creative Thoughts and
Mind. Download a Free Trial now!
www.Nova-Mind.com
133
Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

The headline states what the product is and by implication disqualifies
people who don’t own or like or use computers. The free trial offer is appeal-
ing, but suggests that the product itself isn’t free. Free is a powerful word,
and must be used cautiously in AdWords. People who have no desire to pay
for something will still take one if it’s free. If the ad had promised a free down-
load without qualifying it as a trial, they would have increased CTR at the
expense of the quality of the traffic.
Writing a personals ad
Think of your ad like a personals ad. If you’re putting personals ads in local
papers or Match.com, your goal isn’t to attract every bozo in the county.
Instead, you want to weed out the incompatibles and make every date a
potential winner. Personals ads achieve this qualification by stating who
should not apply:
Divorced White Male, 53, in good health, seeks Single White Female, non-
smoker, under 45; no cats or whistling cockroaches; must not be allergic to
peanuts or mangos; must like Berlioz, Bartok, and organic kohlrabi.
Negative qualifiers not only weed out the wrong folks; they also attract the
right folks: (“He’s right — I could never live with a whistling cockroach. We’re
a lot alike. I wonder what he looks like. . . .”)
Your ad can qualify based on location (Roslindale IT Consultant), price
(Downloadable Book — $17.77), limited options (Red and Gold Only), plat-
form (Not Mac-Compatible), profession (For Teachers), personality (No
Whiners!), and many other characteristics. Brainstorm a list of qualifiers by
answering the question, “Who shouldn’t buy from me?” If you sell a stand-
alone version and a prospect is searching for an enterprise edition, don’t
even waste a nickel of your cash or a minute of their time. If your negative
keywords didn’t turn them away (see Chapter 5), let your ad do it before they
cost you money.
Which side do you want to err on?
Every ad has to choose between Mistake #1 and Mistake #2. Mistake #1 is the
false positive: Someone clicks who isn’t your customer. You’ve just wasted
the click price. Mistake #2 is the false negative: You send away someone who
would have bought from you.
Which mistake is worse depends on how much each mistake costs you and
how often it occurs. If your clicks cost five cents and your average sale is
$800, you can afford a lot of false positives (800 × 20 = 16,000 to be exact) for
each sale. On the other hand, if clicks cost $32 each, your campaign can hem-
orrhage cash if you aren’t very particular about who, exactly, you invite to
your site.
134
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Ultimately, the decision to widen or narrow the ad comes down to the value
of a visitor from that ad to your Web site. One ad will simply make you more
money (after subtracting your advertising spend) than all the others. Your
mission is to keep writing ads until you find that one.
Telling your visitors what to expect
The third goal of your ad is to manage expectations. If your ad conveys play-
fulness, don’t send your visitor to a dry and hyper-professional-looking land-
ing page. If you advertise a free download, make it easy to find that
download. If you highlight a benefit, focus the landing page on that benefit.
Show your prospect that you keep your promises, even the little ones you
make in your ads.
Tuning Your Ad to the Keyword
Imagine that your goal is to sell a photocopier to a local business owner
named Al Schmendrick. Which ad headline has the best chance of success?
A. Big Sale on Business Machines This Week
B. Are You Tired of Clearing Paper Jams from Your Old Copier?
C. Hey, Al Schmendrick: Are You Tired of Clearing Paper Jams from Your
Old Copier?
If my kids’ college tuition depended on the sale, I’d choose headline C in a
heartbeat. Why? It’s all about the prospect, and it’s very likely to get his atten-
tion. In fact, if Al Schmendrick doesn’t read the paper that day, or skips the
page that contains my ad, I’d bet that one of Al’s friends will tell him about it.
The meta-message of your ad to your best prospect is, “This ad is all about
you.” Marketing consultant Dan Kennedy talks about the “message-to-market
match.” The keyword defines the market — who they are and what they want.
Your ad is the message that must address their self-identity and desires. As I
talk about in Chapter 5, the tighter your ad groups, the more precisely your
tone, message, and offer can match what each market will respond to.
Marching to a Different Drummer
AdWords is arguably the most competitive advertising real estate on earth.
Where else can you find dozens of competitors crammed sardine-like into the
135
Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

same space, vying for eyeballs and actions? If you said “the Yellow Pages,”
you’re almost right. AdWords functions like the Yellow Pages, except in four
important respects that make AdWords far more competitive:
 In the Yellow Pages, customers might find your ad on the third page of
listings, but it could be the very first ad they see. Position is less impor-
tant than size and look. An AdWords ad on page 8 is essentially invisible.
 The Yellow Pages separates the free and paid listings into white and
yellow pages. Google shows both on the same page. I’ve heard from
AdWords clients who also have first-page organic rankings who tell me
that their organic listing generates three times as many clicks as their ad.
 Because AdWords is a results-accountable medium (meaning, you can
tell when your ad works and when it doesn’t), many AdWords competi-
tors have become proficient through trial and error. Most Yellow Pages
ads are just plain awful, because businesses haven’t discovered the
direct-marketing principles that allow for continuous improvement. (For
more on this, visit my Web site www.leadsintogold.com.)
 In the Yellow Pages, you don’t pay less or move to a better position if
your ad is more effective than a competitor’s. The Yellow Pages is like
golf: Your score doesn’t directly affect your competitor’s score. AdWords
rewards relevance with lower prices and higher position, making it more
like tennis.
The most important rule when trying to stand out in a crowd is, “When they
zig, you zag.” As you compose your ad, keep your prospect’s big question in
mind: “Why should I click your ad instead of all the other ads and organic list-
ings on this page, instead of typing a different search term — and instead of
blowing off this search entirely and just logging on to Second Life for three
hours?”
Studying your competition
Search for your top 5–10 keywords and print the results pages. Study these
sheets — they may represent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of
dollars of market research and testing. Get a notebook and jot down your
observations about each of the ads:
 What’s the big promise?
 What’s the tone?
 What’s the emotional appeal?
 What’s the logical appeal?
 How does each ad position itself as different from the rest?
 What features are highlighted?
136
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

 What proof is offered?
 What is the call to action?
Positioning your offer
Different isn’t enough — your ad must be better. Your goal is to write an ad
that sets you apart from the other ads in a way that connects you with your
market. For example, say you sell industrial fans. You check out the AdWords
competition and discover that the keyword industrial fan brings up ads
that focus on models, features, and price. You can differentiate your company
by writing an ad citing benefits and ROI.
You can position your offer as unique in many ways. Your market research
(detailed in Chapter 4) can give you ideas about what your market wants and
what the competition is currently providing and talking about. Now you can
apply Ken McCarthy’s “Holes in the Road” theory from Chapter 4 and write
ads that address unmet needs.
When most businesspeople think of competition, they think first of price. If
you can produce your goods and services more efficiently than others, you
can compete on price. After all, Wal-Mart does it. But being the cheapest isn’t
usually the most compelling sales argument. Do you want the cheapest floor-
ing in your living room? Do you want to drive the cheapest car? Do you want
the cheapest heart surgeon operating on you? Besides, price wars often end
up as a damaging race to the bottom for all involved, including the customer
who finds that the business can’t deliver quality at the price quoted.
If a segment of your market is searching for a particular model, like the Lifeline
USA Power Wheel or the Canon PowerShot S400 Digital ELPH, they may have
decided on that particular model already, and are now comparison-shopping
for the best deal. In that case, an ad that mentions price can be effective.
Two fundamental ways to position your ad
One way to position your ad is to slice the niche differently.
For example, if you sell martial arts training videos, books, and equipment,
you might assume that the entire world of martial arts students and enthusi-
asts is your market. If you claim a slice of that market and speak to them
specifically — for example, college-age women, senior citizens, bouncers —
you can position yourself as their supplier of choice. Each of those niches
might be small, but you can own all of them if they self-identify with their
keywords.
The second way to position your ad is to make a better first offer.
137
Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

Even though the goal of the ad is to make a first sale, you can offer other
things that your prospects may want or need before they buy. Reviews, free
samples (physical, informational, or software), advice, video demonstration,
discussion, and so on can be dangled in front of prospects who haven’t yet
made up their minds. As long as the “magnet” attracts your prospects and
leaves non-prospects cold, you can generate the right clicks by offering an
intermediate step of value.
No matter what you sell, you can always position yourself as an expert in the
field. Search, by definition, implies some gap between your customers’ desires
and the information they have about how to fulfill those desires. If your ad
offers to guide and educate, rather than simply to sell, your offer can stand out.
Motivating Action in Four Lines
Everyone makes decisions rationally, right? People weigh the pros and cons,
consider their values and priorities, and maximize benefits while minimizing
costs. People balance risks and rewards, and get better over time as they
learn from their experiences.
That doesn’t sound like anybody I know.
The truth is, all people make decisions emotionally, in their guts. They justify
those decisions using logic, but the part of the brain that can handle matrices
and cost-benefit analyses is just slower than the part that acts out of fear and
greed. Before they consciously ponder, that old reptile brain decides
instantly whether someone is friend or foe, prey or predator.
The AdWords ad heightens the emotional aspect of decision making because
the rational brain has very little to go on: three lines of text and a Web address.
Marketing consultant David Bullock, of www.davidbullock.com, puts it
this way:
How do you connect to the “right” click?
One second is all that you have to get the attention of your online visitor.
That’s it.
The fastest way to meet your revenue goal is to figure out what to say, write,
or display in this little 1-inch space to get, hold, and motivate the viewer to
click your AdWords ad.
Simply, the idea is to develop a stunning emotional appeal that gets the
“right” click.
By definition, emotional appeal is the mental state that arises spontaneously
rather than through conscious effort and is often accompanied by
physiological changes; a feeling: the emotions of joy, sorrow, reverence,
hate, and love.
138
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

As you boil it down, most of the decisions people make are based on fear
and desire. All emotional states arise from one of these two states. We are
either moving toward something or away from some situation.
Your ad has to hit the visitor/searcher right between the eyes, make an
instantaneous connection and move the visitor to spontaneously gravitate
towards your offer. It is not a matter of logic. Your visitor has no time to
think about not clicking your AdWords ad. Your goal is to get them to your
landing page and move forward in your customer-acquisition process.
Either you hit the mark or you are off. You either get the click or you don’t.
Period. End of story.
Your four lines must focus on emotions first and logic second. Your prospect
will use logic to construct a search strategy (choosing keywords, searching
for information, refining the search to longer and most specific keywords,
and so on), but moves toward and away from search results and Web sites
based on a subconscious emotional response.
To write effective ads, you have to understand the conversation that just
took place inside the head of your prospect as they typed the keyword that
brought your ad to them. What is their story? What are they telling them-
selves about their situation and how to improve it?
And I mean story quite literally. Go check out a book of fairy tales, or rent a
couple of Disney movies to remind yourself what a story contains: a hero
(that’s them), a problem, a trigger to action, obstacles and villains, and a
happy ending. If your ad can connect to the right place in their story, you can
grab their attention and lead them the rest of the way.

Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

Home-based business offers tap into the business opportunity market, which
is actually several different markets, each with its own set of motivations and
internal stories. Examine the first four ads to identify what they’re up to:
 Home Business: A no-nonsense ad that uses words like legitimate and
serious to emphasize the soberness of this opportunity. The syntax
implies that the entrepreneur in question is already doing this, making it
by definition “do-able.” The ad connects with the prospect whose story
is, “I don’t believe in something for nothing. If I want to be successful, I
have to be willing to work for it. (But not too hard, I hope.)”
 I Was Scammed 37 Times: This ad allows the reader to bond with Danny
over his misfortunes, and to feel superior to him even as they take his
advice. The word scammed appears three times, tying into the cynicism
of the serial opportunity seeker who too has felt scammed yet keeps
hoping that the perfect business opportunity is just around the corner.
The word absolute is a powerful emotional trigger, making the tone one
of righteous indignation. Prospects who subconsciously want a protec-
tor will be drawn to this ad.
 Home Based Business — Free: The emotionally laden phrase in this ad
is, “You won’t get rich.” The word realistic and the modest income claims
support the notion that this opportunity, unlike others, is achievably
modest. It is designed to give hope to those who have been burned or
turned off by big promises. This ad connects with the story, “If some-
thing’s too good to be true, it probably is.” The URL reflects the theme of
realistic expectations by calling it a project and promising a payday
rather than a windfall.
 Don’t Lose $49 Bucks: This ad is similar to the second one, but speaks
directly to the prospect’s fear of loss by concretizing and quantifying the
risk. Even without knowing how they might lose this $49, the prospect
for this ad is suspicious enough to want to find out. The ad appeals to
the “cautious risk-taker” who believes that having inside information can
make them safe. Their story goes like this: “The world is a dangerous
place for suckers, but I will be rewarded for my educated boldness.”
The two ads at the bottom of the right column (Home Income Opportunity
and Your Passport to Wealth?) are interesting because of their choices of
emotionally laden words. CEO implies power and status, and speaks to a frus-
trated employee of a large company who envies and probably resents the
CEO. The word passport attracts prospects who view exotic travel as market
of success. They crave movement and excitement over security.
An old marketing acronym, AIDA, names the four states that have to occur, in
order, in your prospect before you can make a sale:
 Attention: Attention is compelled by a headline that names the prospects
or their pain, or connects with one of the big three motivators: greed,
fear, or curiosity.
140
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

 Interest: Interest is raised by naming features and benefits (price, free
shipping, options, works in zero gravity, you know the drill).
 Desire: The desire is the happy ending, or a promised step in that direc-
tion. (They can’t slay the dragon until they find the enchanted sword.)
 Action: The action is the click, to go from the Google results page to
your landing page.
All this highfalutin’ theory is great, but let’s get down to business. You have
four lines to accomplish these marketing tasks. The following sections break
down the task of each line so you can begin to create magnetic ads.
Grabbing them with the headline
The goal of the headline is to get your prospects’ attention while leaving
everyone else unimpressed. Classic headline gambits include the following:
 Name Them:
• Considering a Unicycle
• Mind Maps for Teachers
• Actor’s Disability Insur.
 Mirror Their Itch:
• Suffering from Gout?
• Rotten-Egg Water Odors?
• Disorganized?
 Pick Their Scab with a Provocative Question:
• Suffering IBS for Years?
• Do You Hate Filing?
• Got a Jerk for a Boss?
 Arouse Curiosity:
• Are You Right-Brained?
• Are You a Slacker Mom?
• Copywriting Secret #19
 Warn Them:
• I was scammed 37 times
• Howie Jacobson Exposed
• Biodiesel Scandal
141
Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

 Make a Big Promise:
• Write and Publish a Book
• The “Beat Gout” Diet
• Jump Higher in 14 Days
 Offer Unbiased Information:
• 8 Shower Filters Tested
• Flat-Panel TV Reviews
• Compare Autoresponders
Use the keyword if appropriate
If you include the keyword in your headline, you can almost always increase
your ad CTR. For example, an ad with the headline “Homebrew for Beginners”
achieved a 3.88% CTR for the keyword [homebrew] but pulled only 1.01% for
[home brew].
Matching the ad to the exact keyword tells your prospects that you understand
them (even if you don’t). NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) experts tell us
that we build rapport by using the same words as others rather than para-
phrasing. Also, Google bolds keywords on its results page. If you search for
healthy recipe you’ll see several advertisers who take advantage of this
fact, while others offer healthy recipes and don’t get the benefit of bolding.
If your competitors are all using the keywords in their headlines (or, in the
case of keywords of 20–25 characters, as their headlines), then you’ll want to
choose a different strategy to stand out. But it’s a rare ad that won’t benefit
from inclusion of keywords somewhere in the headline, description, or URL.
Develop a swipe file
A swipe file is a collection of successful advertising pieces from which you
can draw inspiration. Professional copywriters rarely invent headlines and
bullets from thin air; instead, they modify old standards. For example, John
Caples famously (among direct marketing geeks, anyway) sold a piano home
study course with the headline, “They laughed when I sat down at the piano
but when I started to play . . . !” Today, copywriters model this formula in
selling everything from baking magazines (“They laughed when I got up to
bake”) to dog training (“They laughed when I issued my $10,000 dog-trainer
challenge . . .”).
Perry Marshall recommends building your own AdWords swipe file quickly
and inexpensively by visiting your local library or supermarket and copying
the text on the covers of popular magazines. If you prefer to stay at home, go
to www.magazines.com to view covers of current issues. Here are some
headline formulas from this week’s issues of Cosmo, O, Woman’s Day, and
Vogue, followed in parentheses by possible AdWords adaptations:
142
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

 19 dresses that show who’s boss (7 skateboards that show who’s boss)
 The season’s hottest styles (The season’s hottest cameras)
 Weird male behavior decoded (Weird dog behavior decoded)
 Break your bad food habits (Break your bad skiing habits)
 Shhh! We’ve got a big secret to less stress (Shh! A big packaging secret)
Using the description lines to make
them an offer they can’t refuse
AdWords consultant Joy Milkowski (www.adwordstoolbox.com) has put
together a menu of ad elements you can deploy in your two description lines.
She recommends choosing two, plus a call to action. (See the “Sending Out a
Call to Action” section for more information.)
Take some time and brainstorm a few elements for your ad for each of the fol-
lowing menu items. Don’t worry yet about fitting your copy into the AdWords
space restrictions. Just get the concepts first, and whittle away the extra
words later.
Your menu of ad elements
I’m going to find examples of Joy’s ad elements in phrases from real ads for a
single keyword: data recovery.
 Address a Pain Point: If your customers are searching because they
want to prevent or alleviate a problem, you can stoke their interest and
build rapport by showing them you understand their situation.
• Lost data?
• No Need to Panic
 Offer a Solution: It’s a marketing cliché that people buy holes, not drills,
yet businesses routinely neglect to advertise the solutions they provide.
One way to get at the solution your customers want is to fill in the
blanks, “We provide _________ to ___________ and what this means to
you is _______________.” What you wrote in the last blank is the solu-
tion. The solutions listed as follows are tame. I would enliven them by
adding a “what this means to you” phrase (in parentheses following
each solution).
• Restore Lost or Deleted Data (so you can keep billing your
customers)
• Fast data recovery for SQL Server (so you can keep your business
running)
143
Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

 List Features: If your product or service is significantly different from
your competitors’ offerings, list the differentiating features. Banks that
are open on Sunday and late on weekdays, environmentally friendly dry
cleaners, and single-volume print-on-demand presses are all examples of
companies seeking an advantage by doing things a little differently.
• HD, RAID, Tape, CD/DVD, Memory Card
• 24/7 Support
• On-Site Clean Room
 Short Value Proposition: A value proposition is the answer to the ques-
tion, “What do you do that makes you the best choice for me?” The first
example is a no-quibble guarantee, while the second sets out a specific
performance goal.
• No Data, No Cost
• We Recover Most Data in 24 Hours
 Differentiator: You can compare your business favorably to others,
either overtly or by implication. Google generally frowns upon superla-
tives (best, cheapest, biggest), but usually is OK with qualifiers such as
better, cheaper, bigger. Two of the following examples trash the competi-
tion by implication: “We actually do it” implies that others don’t, while
“no junk fees” suggests that competitors tack on extra charges to pad
their margins.
• Others say $379, we actually do it!
• Fastest Turnaround Time
• No Junk Fees
 Price: In a price-sensitive market, you can signal that you’re the best deal
by naming a specific price, by telling your prospect that you have low
prices, or by offering free shipping. For some reason, free shipping is a
very popular online feature. People will pay $20 for the product if they can
avoid a $7.95 shipping fee (not consciously, but it happens all the time).
• $379
• Low Flat Rates
• Free Shipping
 Sale/Promotion: Do you have anything free or on sale? Can you offer
two for the price of one? What about throwing in a copy of AdWords For
Dummies with every purchase? (Just a thought.) Retail stores have
attracted customers with sales since Grog drew a crowd by offering a
free club with every spear.
• Free Evaluation!
• Free Consulting
• Free Trial
144
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

 Credentializer: You can mention any awards you’ve received, well-
known clients, certifications, media mentions. For example, when I
searched for diet tips, the phrase “As Seen on Oprah” appeared
twice in the first eight sponsored listings.
• Since 1980
• Industry-Leading 90% Success Rate
• 12 yrs. Crashed Hard Drive Recovery
• Experts on RAID
Benefits before features
No one formula for effective ad writing exists, and you have to make sure the
elements you combine make sense together and all pull in the same direction.
In general, though, you won’t go wrong by putting the big benefit on the first
line and the differentiating feature on the second line. The second line will
also contain the other crucial element of your ad: the call to action.
Sending Out a Call to Action
You usually want your prospect to click your ad. (In some cases, you may
prefer that they phone; if so, include your phone number in the ad. Several of
the data-recovery ads had phone numbers, probably on the assumption that
someone typing data recovery is in a state of near-hysteria and wants to
contact a real person ASAP.) Joy Milkowski suggests two tactics to compel the
click: Offer something in exchange for action and create a sense of urgency.
Making an offer with action words
When you offer something, use action words. Your prospect is searching with
a “gatherer” mentality. Offer something bright and shiny to shift them into
“hunter” mode. Active action words include
 Get, buy, or purchase
 Order, call, or sign up
 Try or download
More passive action words help the prospect make a decision:
 See, learn, compare, or discover
 View, listen, or watch
145
Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

The following examples are from ads that appeared when I searched for the
keyword data recovery. Note how they all begin with action words.

Fanning desire with urgency qualifiers
Ken McCarthy points out that nothing stokes desire as much as unattainabil-
ity. If we can’t have it, we want it all the more. Joy uses urgency words to
compel immediate action:
 Now
 Today
 By (date)
 While it lasts (in conjunction with a sale price)
Mastering the Medium
and Voice at Haiku U.
Once you’ve chosen your approach and selected elements that will compel
action from the right prospects, you’ve got to fit that content elegantly into
135 characters. Joy Milkowski calls this step, “Sell to me in 10 words or less.”
Stop thinking sales pitch and start thinking haiku — the Japanese poetic art
that paints a compelling mental picture in 17 syllables.
First, forget everything your high-school English teachers taught you about
grammar. Your ad must read like a conversation, not an essay. Notice that Joy
didn’t use the more grammatically correct construction, “Sell to me in 10 words
or fewer.” Write like you talk — or better yet, write like your market talks.
Apple Computer is running very effective ads featuring two actors portraying
a Mac and a PC. The Mac actor is a hip young dude, while the PC actor is a
pocket-protector-wearing nerd who awkwardly stumbles and bumbles
through life. If huge multinational companies develop personalities in the
minds of consumers, your business too needs a voice. Your ads are the first
words in this voice that your prospects will hear.
146
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

The best business personalities are slightly exaggerated but basically accu-
rate extensions of the business owner or leader. Start adopting that voice in
your ads. An Internet marketer calling himself “The Rich Jerk” used the fol-
lowing ad when the name of another Internet marketer (whose name I’ve
omitted) was typed as a keyword:
I’m Rich. You’re Not.
How much money did [name] make?
Who cares? I make millions.
therichjerk.com
This ad works both to attract a certain type of person and to strongly repel
everyone else. In some markets (like Internet marketing, for example), your
tone can be brash. In others, you must come across as professional and no-
nonsense. You can be caring, efficient, funny, angry, matter-of-fact, exasper-
ated, excited, clinical, or poetic. Test different voices to find out which one
connects best with your market. But your best voice will most often be your
genuine voice — just smoothed and amped a bit to cut through the clutter of
Timid Timmies and Me-Too Mollies. Your prospects are looking for authentic-
ity in a world full of fakeness. Connect to them as your unique self and you’re
already cutting through the clutter.
Almost everything about your business can be copied, except for you. No one
else has your thoughts, your experiences, your unique point of view. Most
businesspeople hide this aspect of themselves to appear professional. It’s
possible to do both — be real and be professional. Take advantage of your
only true differentiator and be yourself whenever possible.
AdWords consultant Garrett Todd of www.impresscallers.com cautions
against rampant creativity. Extensive testing has shown him that classic
direct-marketing approaches outperform offbeat, creative ads. He shared his
top two formulas with me:
 Who Else Wants to . . .
Music On Hold
Who Else Wants to Reduce Hang-Ups
and Impress On-Hold Callers?
www.Impress-Callers.com
 If . . . Then . . .
Music On Hold
If You Want to Reduce Hang-Ups
Then Try Custom Music On Hold.
www.Impress-Callers.com
Garrett reports that the first ad generates an impressive 11.02% CTR. Note
that his display URL includes a hyphen; he found that separating the two
words increased CTR. The www prefix also improved CTR.
147
Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

Rob Goyette of www.vaelos.com, another crackerjack AdWords user, found
that his most successful problem headline was
Got [problem]?
For example:
Got Gout?
Naming Your Online Store Effectively
Many advertisers spend dozens of hours brainstorming and agonizing over
their headline and two description lines, and never play with their URLs.
That’s a big mistake; your URL makes up 25% of your entire ad, and is often
the most important line. Your URL is the name of your store. It conveys lots
of meta-information about who you are and whom you serve.
For example, I used to funnel some cold calling traffic to Free-Lead-
Generation-Course.com, which offered a 7-day e-mail course instead of a
sales-letter Web site. My CTR was comparable to ads that sent traffic to
LeadsintoGold.com, but the free course generated about half as many sales.
Buying more domain names
Even if you have one main Web site, you can buy other URLs and test them
in your ads. Domain names cost about $8.00 a year these days (I use www.
getgoingonline.com). You can redirect the extra URLs to your main site.
As long as the display URL takes your prospect somewhere relevant, Google
doesn’t mind.
Glenn Livingston offers the examples shown in Figure 6-2 of huge differences
in CTR due solely to changes in the display URL:
Figure 6-2:
Different
Display
URLs can
double CTR.
148
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

The domain suffixes also tell a story. The business-focused .com some-
times can be beaten by the non-profit .org, and even .org domains can
in fact front for-profit businesses. If you offer reviews or comparisons,
TheAntiWrinkleInstitute.org may pull better than JanesWrinkle
BustingCream.com.
Adding subdomains and subdirectories
Joy Milkowski improved her die-cutting client’s CTR by changing the display
URL from www.MyClient.com to www.MyClient.com/die-cut. (Her client’s
URL wasn’t actually myclient.com — most successful AdWords advertisers
view their ads and keywords as maps to secret fishing holes, kept close to the
chest and never shared with potential competitors. And with AdWords’ low
barrier to entry, pretty much everyone is your potential competitor.)
In the preceding example, /die-cut is a subdirectory, or folder, within the
Web site. You can also test subdomains, which look like this:
die-cut.myclient.com
If you’re not sure how to create subdomains or subdirectories, ask your
Webmaster.
Testing capitalization and the www prefix
Check out the two ads shown in Figure 6-3. The top ad received 4.64% CTR,
compared to only 2.22% CTR for the second ad. The only difference was
the URL.
The top ad included the www and capitalized the first letter of each keyword —
and attracted more than twice as many clicks per impression as the lower ad.

Wielding “Black Belt” Techniques
for Hyper-Competitive Markets
I know you bought this book to learn the basics of AdWords, to get into the
game. But if your market is highly competitive, you have to start at Big
Leagues level just to get any impressions on your keywords. If your keywords
are expensive, you may need one of more of the following three techniques
just to stay solvent as you crack the AdWords code:
 The “fake” www domain is easy enough to try, as long as someone else
in your market hasn’t thought of it already. (Hey, here’s an idea: Buy up
every copy of this book you can find, just to make sure your competition
doesn’t learn about this technique.)
 Dynamic keyword insertion is almost a Google secret. For good
reason — do it wrong and you’re looking at an AdWords bill that could
fund a flight to Mars. So read carefully — and don’t even consider using
it until you’ve installed and mastered conversion tracking and analytics
on your Web site.
 Subdomain redirects were pioneered by Perry Marshall, who has many
happy clients using it for all their domains. It’s a way to test hundreds of
URLs without having to buy them. This technique is a little complicated,
but worth it in many cases.
The fake www-domain technique
You may have noticed the trick that Glenn Livingston of www.ultimateadwords
research.com used in creating his winning display URLs earlier in this
chapter. He added www- to a popular keyword and showed that to searchers.
It works because it tricks the eye into seeing your domain as the “main” Web
site in the category. Someone searching for digital cameras will view
www.DigitalCameras.com as the most relevant and authoritative domain
to visit. Glenn bought the domain http://www.www-digitalcameras.
com and simply omitted the “real” www from the display URL. The searcher
sees www-DigitalCameras.com and can easily confuse it for www.
DigitalCameras.com.
This technique is a cheap trick, but it’s possibly worth the price of several
cases of this book.
150
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Dynamic keyword insertion
Do you ever wonder how eBay and Amazon manage to bid on practically
every keyword in existence and show those keywords in their ads? They
don’t have thousands of employees creating millions of different ads. Instead,
they use a special format to stick the keyword right into a generic ad, as
shown in Figure 6-4. And now you can do it too!
To use dynamic keyword insertion, first make friends with the squiggly brack-
ets. On most keyboards, you can find them by using the Shift key with the
square bracket keys, just below the - and = keys near the top right. They look
like this:
{ left squiggly bracket
} right squiggly bracket
Dynamic keyword insertion requires two decisions:
 How you want to handle capitalization of keywords?
 What do you want to appear on-screen in case the keyword is too long to
fit into the ad?
Let’s say you sell mobile phone ringtones, and you know lots of people are
searching by typing their favorite performer or composer or type of music
followed by the word ringtone. The list of potential keywords could be
enormous. Without dynamic keywords insertion, you would either spend
hundreds of hours creating tightly focused ad groups (see Chapter 5), like
Mozart ringtone, Beethoven ringtone, Bach ringtone, Beyonce
ringtone, and so on, or you would have a few big ad groups with thousands
of those keywords and very vague ads with headlines like these:
 Classical Music Ringtones
 R&B Ringtones
 Hip-Hop Ringtones
Figure 6-4:
These ads
dynamically
insert the
keyword.
151
Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

To use dynamic keyword insertion, create medium-sized ad group buckets:
 Classical Music
 Pop Music
 Country Music
 Rap Music
and so on. Put all your classical music terms — Beethoven, Hilary Hahn,
violin concerto, Leonard Bernstein, Philharmonic — in the Classical
Music ad group. Then create the following headline:
{KeyWord:Classical Music Ringtones}
Note that the colon is not followed by a space!
Now if someone searches for one of your keywords, they will see that key-
word in the headline if it contains 25 characters or fewer:
 Hilary Hahn Ringtones
 Bach Requiem Ringtone
 Missa Solemnis ring tone
If the keyword is too long (Alicia de Larrocha Mozart piano sonata
in C ringtone), they will see the default keyword Classical Music
Ringtones instead.
To capitalize every word of the keyword, capitalize the K and W in KeyWord:
{KeyWord:Alternate Text}
Capitalize just the first word by capitalizing the K only:
{Keyword:Alternate Text}
If you want the keyword to appear in all lowercase, don’t capitalize any 
letters:
{keyword:Alternate Text}
If their keyword doesn’t fit, the alternate text will appear exactly as you’ve
typed it — capitalized or not.
If you are careless about your keyword list, you could end up spending a lot
of money that you won’t make back. An extreme example to make the point:
Let’s say my friend Battery Bob accidentally includes Paris Hilton in the
keyword list for his cell phone battery ad group.
152
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Without dynamic keyword insertion, the worst that happens is a million
teenagers looking for gossip or racy photos see and ignore the following ad:
Cell Phone Batteries
All Makes and Models
Low Prices - Same Day Shipping
www.BatteryBob.com
But with dynamic keyword insertion, here’s what they might see:
Paris Hilton Videos
All Makes and Models
Low Prices - Same Day Shipping
www.BatteryBob.com
Uh-oh, Battery Bob. You just spent $12,000 on clicks in about six hours, with
no sales to show for it. (The real Battery Bob would never make such a mis-
take, of course.)
You can deploy dynamic keyword insertion not only in the headline and
description lines, but also in the display URL for marketing purposes and
the destination URL for advanced conversion tracking. Rob Goyette has
written an excellent technical introduction to this tactic, available at www.
vaelos.com/dk.
Subdomain redirects
The third “black belt” ad technique gives you a chance to test hundreds of
display URLs for the price of one. A subdomain is the part of your URL that
can appear before the main domain name. For example, books is the sub-
domain of this Web site:
http://books.fitfam.com
Using a Web service called www.zoneedit.com, you can quickly and easily
create new subdomains without needing to know Web design or HTML or
server architecture or how to make vegan oatmeal cookies. (I actually do
know how to make delicious vegan oatmeal cookies — send a blank e-mail to
cookies@fitfam.com for the recipe — but I assure you I could still work
ZoneEdit.com without this knowledge.)
My wife sells handmade soap featuring different essential oils and other nat-
ural ingredients. Her main Web site address is www.comfortsoap.com. Let’s
say she wants to test a different domain that works well with various sub-
domains, www.soapforyourfamily.com:
153
Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

lavender.SoapForYourFamily.com
oatmeal.SoapForYourFamily.com
cruelty-free.SoapForYourFamily.com
Using ZoneEdit.com, which is free for the first five domains (not subdomains,
so their free service may be all you’ll ever need), she can create subdomains
and then redirect them to specific pages on her www.comfortsoap.com
Web site. She can even mask the pages so the subdomain is what appears in
the visitor’s browser’s address and title bars. Using this method, she can test
different URLs (which is better, Natural.SoapForYourFamily.com or
ChemicalFree.SoapForYourFamily.com?). She can also use different dis-
play URLs in different ad groups: the lavender group, the Shea-butter group,
the neroli group, and so on.
Visit www.askhowie.com/zoneedit for a video tutorial on using
www.zoneedit.com for subdomain redirection.
Following Google’s Text-Ad Guidelines
I’ll warn you about some commonly broken rules in the following sections,
but you should still take ten minutes to read Google’s editorial guidelines at
https://adwords.google.com/select/guidelines.html
Punctuation
Google’s rules for punctuation in your AdWords ads are pretty simple:
 No more than one exclamation point in your text, and not in the headline.
 No repeated punctuation (Tired??!!).
 No unnecessary punctuation ($$ instead of money or $#!! standing in for
an expletive).
Capitalization
The capitalization rules for AdWords ads are that you can’t use excess capi-
talization such as FREE or SIDE EFFECTS.
However, you can capitalize acronyms (MPH) as well as the first letter of each
word in your ad and in your display URL (LeadsIntoGold.com is accept-
able; LeadsintoGOLD.com is not).
154
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

Spelling and grammar
Google doesn’t like ads that look like they were written by toddlers. Make
sure all words are spelled correctly. If you don’t have an ear for grammar,
get someone who does to take a look at your ad. Spell checkers can’t pick up
mistakes like using than for then or weather for whether.
Copyright and trademark usage
You can’t use copyrighted and trademarked terms in your ads without the
permission of the rights holder.
This is a thorny and complicated issue for Google. If you sell one brand of
mobile phone, can you compare it to a competing brand in your ad? Can you
use copyrighted terms in your URL? In my experience, Google has not consis-
tently enforced these rules. When I was advertising a natural approach to cer-
tain health problems, I ran ads that mentioned the names of prescription
drugs. Google disallowed those ads, probably because the pharmaceutical
company that makes the drugs had already complained to Google (or perhaps
threatened a lawsuit). In other cases, I used copyrighted and trademarked
terms without a problem.
Competitive claims
If you say your business is the best, fastest, cheapest, most successful, and
such, you need to prove it to Google (and the world) on your landing page.
Offers
If you offer it in your ad, your visitor must be able to get it easily from your
landing page. Giving away a free trial download? Put the link in an obvious
place on the landing page. If Google’s editors visit your site and decide your
offer is fraudulent, your ad will be disallowed.
No offensive language
Unlike George Carlin, I can’t tell you the seven words you’re not allowed to
use on Google. But if they get bleeped out of movies on TV, that’s a pretty
good clue to omit them from your ads.
155
Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

If you want to be offensive, find acceptable synonyms. Perry Marshall found
that replacing sucks with stinks revived a disallowed ad in 2005. Yet The Rich
Jerk has been getting away with “Gurus Suck” as his headline for several
months, so maybe Google is loosening up.
Links
Your display URL must “accurately reflect” (to use Google’s exact language)
the URL of your Web site. You can’t display a URL that you don’t own and
aren’t sending traffic to. That is, if someone typed your display URL into their
browser instead of clicking your ad (thoughtfully saving you money!), they
should still get to the same Web site, if not the exact same landing page.
Your destination URL must work properly and must resolve to a working Web
page, as opposed to an e-mail address or document or multimedia file.
Exploring the Other Ad Formats
Google is constantly exploring new places and media for their ads. You can
now create graphical ads for Web sites, text ads for mobile phones, local
business listings that appear on search results pages and next to Google
Maps, and video ads.
Getting the picture with image ads
Image ads are graphical files that display on content sites, but not on
Google’s or their search partners’ results pages. Publishers can choose to
display image ads instead of text ads. Perry Marshall has found that image
ads typically generate higher CTRs than text ads, but convert to leads and
sales at a much lower level. If you’re a Web site publisher who gets paid for
clicks on the Google ads on your site, image ads can be very profitable
because of their high CTRs. For you, the AdWords advertiser, the high CTR
can be a double-edged sword. Unless you monitor ROI from each ad, you may
be funding Google’s expansion at the expense of your own.
Joy Milkowski of www.adwordstoolbox.com offers the following four sug-
gestions if you decide to try image ads:
1. Focus on a Pain or Problem
The same principles apply to this format as to all your marketing material —
does it clearly suggest/address a pain or problem? Often I see adds trying to
“feature dump” instead of offering to solve an issue in simple, easy to read
language.
156
Part II: Launching Your AdWords Campaign 

2. Keep the Design Clean and Simple
Are you trying to be too busy or use colors that are too bold in order to try to
get noticed? If yes, chances are you may be turning prospects OFF. Our eyes
are drawn to clean, easily decipherable images and language. Image ads,
normally, are not the place to go “Las Vegas.”
3. Show People, Not Products
Careful with using pictures of your product on the ad — often the space is so
small that you end up either confusing the viewer or making your product
seem less than adequate. Instead, I recommend using people. Get the viewer
looking at a person — it’s hard to NOT notice a person looking right at you!
4. Include an Offer and a Call to Action
Your image ad needs an irresistible offer as well as a compelling call to
action. Remember, you’re still in a direct response world. Don’t let your ego
look at the pretty pictures and elevate branding above measurable
response.
Compared to text ads, image ads are more expensive and time-consuming to
create, more expensive to display, and take longer to generate results. For
these reasons, test your message, tone, offer and call to action with text ads
before creating image ads.
Making the phone and the doorbell 
ring with mobile text ads
Google is going mobile, creating content that can be accessed and acted
upon seamlessly from your smart mobile phone (and even from your mobile
phone of average intelligence but with a nice smile). If your ad includes a link
to a Web site, you have to make sure the site is created in a phone-compatible
way. If you just want prospects to pick up the phone and call, or drive over
and pay you a visit, create your ad and include an offer and call to action.
To create a mobile text ad, click the Mobile Text Ad link from within the Ad
Variations tab of an ad group.
You can view your mobile text ad from your SMS-enabled phone by first
registering your phone with Google at http://google.com/mobile. You
can do this from your computer, or just point your phone’s browser to
http://mobile.google.com. You’ll be able to conduct searches and view
maps, as well as access several other Google services such as Gmail and
Google News.

Chapter 6: Writing Magnetic Ads

Waving to the neighbors 
with local business ads
If your business caters to a local market, you can still use AdWords to attract
clients and customers. For instructions on using regular text ads for geo-
graphically limited markets, see Chapter 7. Right now you’ll see how to create
a local business ad that will appear as Google Maps business listings as well
as other search results.
From within the Ad Variations tab of an ad group, click the Local business ads
link just above the ad variations. On the next page, enter the business name
and address. If you have multiple locations, you have the option to add addi-
tional addresses to your ad. If your business is not yet listed in Google’s Local
Business Center, you’ll receive the following error message:
No businesses matched the address you entered.
In that case, visit https://www.google.com/local/add/login to add
your business.
If your business is listed (mine isn’t, so I’m going to use the Dogstar Tattoo
Co. in Durham, NC as an example in Figure 6-5), you can continue to create
your ad.
You can add a business image and even change the icon that appears next to
your ad. Figure 6-6 shows what the ad will look like on the Google search page.

When someone searches for your keyword in a local area on Google Maps
(http://maps.google.com), your ad may appear on the left, below, or
above the business listings. Clicking it brings up the ad (including phone
number and image) as a callout from the map location, as shown in Figure 6-7.

an image (Google is very picky about the size of this image, so make sure
your graphic designer knows the dimensions Google will accept), enter dis-
play and destination URLs, name your ad, and upload your video.
My nine-minute, 30MB QuickTime video took about seven minutes to load
with a fast cable-modem connection, so have a book handy if you plan on
uploading lots of large videos.
Adriel Brunson of www.rfyvideo.com, a video advertising expert of many
years, studied and experimented with Google video ads in 2006, and sent me
this evaluation:
When Google offered video ads in AdWords, everyone who understood the
power of video on the Web cheered. Unfortunately, we may have cheered
too soon.
We wanted video ads in AdWords campaigns on Google search pages. What
we got were video ads that only played on AdSense sites that allow
graphical ads. Nothing for regular Google search pages.
Google’s AdWords video program does offer powerful options. You can
create both keyword and site-targeted campaigns. You can search for
AdSense sites matching your keywords. If you find any that allow graphical
AdSense ads, you can target those sites.
However, few AdSense publishers allow graphical ads. Most choose the
default text-only option. Even the AdSense experts recommend text-only ads
to blend in with the site navigation and content. No graphical ads, no video.
My recommendation is to create regular AdWords campaigns and drive traffic
to a page with a good headline, a good video, and well-written sales copy.
With a regular Google AdWords keyword-targeted campaign, you’ll get more
control over the traffic, plus you can test everything in the chain — the
keywords, the ad, the headline, the video placement, the text and links
around the video. You can even test different video edits if you want.
With Google AdWords video ads, you have little or no control over these
elements.
Go with a tested AdWords campaign and a landing page with good video.
It’s a much better option all the way around.
Because Google runs a blind advertising network based on keyword search
(meaning you as an advertiser can’t tell in advance where your ads will show,
and the publishers can’t predict accurately which ads will display on their
pages), I recommend using Google video — if you must — only in site-targeted
campaigns (more on this approach in Chapter 7).
You can expect big changes from Google video now that Google has bought
YouTube. Stay abreast of those changes by subscribing to Adriel’s newsletter
at www.rfyvideo.com.

AdWords
Campaigns

In this part . . .
T
he AdWords fantasy is that you find the perfect key-
word, write the perfect ad, and retire to Fiji while the
money rolls in relentlessly. The reality is that as important
as keywords and ads are, the structure of your AdWords
campaigns will determine success or failure.
In Chapter 7, you find out how to navigate a dizzying array
of settings, including which network(s) will display your
ads, how to budget and set bid prices, where in the world
and what time of day to show the ads, and others.
Chapter 8 covers the strategy most neglected by AdWords
users: creating tight Ad Groups of similar keywords and
relevant ads. You discover how to perform ongoing tune-
ups of your keyword lists, bids, and ads, so your AdWords
vehicle runs ever more powerfully and efficiently.
Chapter 9 introduces you to the tools that Google has
thoughtfully provided to make your AdWords life easier
and more fulfilling. Okay, just easier.

W
hen I install a piece of software on my computer, I often get a screen
that asks me whether I want to go ahead with the Typical Installation
(always recommended) or the Custom Installation (for advanced users only).
To my recollection, I’ve never chosen Custom. I always worried that I would
install a version of Microsoft Word that wouldn’t let me type the letter M, or
didn’t have a built in English-to-Esperanto translator, or would omit some
other crucial feature.
Google gives you an overwhelming number of choices for configuring AdWords
campaigns — but it doesn’t really bring them to your attention. Google isn’t
trying to bamboozle you; instead, the default settings are designed to protect
clueless advertisers from themselves. But you, my friend, are no longer a clue-
less advertiser. By virtue of buying this book (or at least spilling coffee on it at
Barnes & Noble), you are hereby officially dubbed “clueful advertiser.”
In this chapter, you see how to tweak the AdWords default settings that aren’t
appropriate for power users. You discover how to bid intelligently on your
own, instead of relying on Google to set your bids for you. (I know Google’s
motto is “Don’t Be Evil,” but I still wouldn’t give them complete control over
my advertising spending.) And you learn how to show your ads to different
geographic areas with laser precision, and how to separate your search and
content traffic for maximum clarity and ROI.

Getting the Most Out of Your Campaigns
If you want to set up one AdWords campaign, put it on autopilot, and never
look at it again, feel free to skip this section. The changes I suggest will usu-
ally mean more, not less, work for you — more decisions, more overseeing,
more risk, even, if you drop the ball. Google gives you a vehicle with an auto-
matic transmission that does your thinking for you. On highways it works
fine, although it will never be as efficient as a well-handled manual transmis-
sion. When you take it out for a race, though, you’re going to need precision
control based on experience - something no computer can do for you. Ready
to strap on your AdWords seatbelt and hit the track?
Changing the default campaign settings
From within your AdWords account, choose a campaign and click Edit
Campaign Settings. You’ll see a page where you can change various settings
for that particular campaign, as shown in Figure 7-1. Some of these options
are shown to you when the campaign is born, while others hide on this page,
waiting for you to find them. Let’s explore the options that you haven’t yet
seen.

Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

Delivery method
If you exceed your daily budget on a regular basis, you have two choices: tell
Google to pace your ads evenly through the day (standard), or show the ads
as often as possible until you run out of money (accelerated).
Both methods can make sense, depending on the viewing patterns of your
market. If your market is global, you probably want to show your ads evenly
so you can get your message to your prospect in Singapore as well as the one
in Saskatoon. If you run a local campaign for office workers, you may want 
to accelerate the ad showing if more people buy in the morning than the
afternoon.
However, the choice begs an important question: why are you limiting your
advertising spend? The concept of a budget for advertising doesn’t make
sense if each ad is making money. If I offered you a dollar bill in exchange for
your half-dollar, how many times would you want to complete that transac-
tion? Does infinity sound about right to you? It wouldn’t make sense for you
to say, “Let’s only trade my 50 cents for your dollar 24 times, because my
daily budget is 12 dollars.”
Limit your daily budget for testing purposes, when you’re not yet profitable
and you’re adjusting your keywords, ads, and Web-site sales process to
become profitable. Another case where limiting your budget makes sense is if
demand exceeds supply and you can only service so many paying customers.
Or if you work for a big company used to advertising that’s not directly tied
to results, and you’re given an ad budget. Or if you haven’t read this book
and don’t yet know what you’re doing.
(In fact, as you’re assessing the competition, if you find that their ads disappear
and reappear on the Google search results page as you refresh the page, you
can be fairly confident that a) they aren’t profitable yet; or b) they don’t under-
stand results-accountable marketing and won’t be much of a threat to you.)
Keyword bidding
Keep the default here (Default bidding – maximum CPC) if you’re going to pay
attention to your keywords and monitor your account on a regular basis.
Don’t let Google optimize your budget.
Ad scheduling
Click the Turn On Ad Scheduling link and gasp to discover that Google gives
you the option to schedule your ads by 15-minute increments, any day of the
week, as shown in Figure 7-2. You can run your ads from midnight to 2:45 a.m.
Monday, 3:00–3:15 a.m. Tuesday, and so on. By clicking the Switch to Advanced
Mode link near the top of the page, you can even adjust your maximum bids
by time period. You may want to be in a higher position on weekends, or just
after The Daily Show, or during Monday Night Football, and so on.
165
Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads

Position preference
If you select the Enable Position Preferences check box and save your
changes, you are taken to a position preference introduction page. When
position preference is activated, you can designate a position range for each
keyword, accomplishing two goals: your ad will not show for a given keyword
unless it falls within that position range, and Google will try to keep your ad
within that range, given your budget limitations.
Essentially, position preference is like setting your maximum CPC, except you
focus on the outcome (position) instead of the input (how much you’re will-
ing to pay for that position). I prefer to control the money — rather than the
position — since the only metrics that matter at the end of the day are
money in and money out.
To play with position preference, drill down into the Keyword tab of an ad
group, and make sure the settings are showing for each keyword. (If the cell
at the top of the column reads Show Settings, click it.) Then click the Edit link
in that column for the keyword whose position you want to set (see the
cursor position in Figure 7-3).

In Figure 7-4, I’ve configured the keyword [no more cold calls] to trig-
ger ads that appear between positions 4 and 8 (including both endpoints).
Ad serving
Hold on for a short fire and brimstone sermon about the Ad Serving setting:
Please do not Optimize your ads. I don’t care where you are. Run, don’t walk
to a Web browser, log in to your account, choose a campaign, click the Edit
Campaign Settings link, and move the radio button from Optimize to Rotate
(refer to Figure 7-1). Then click the Save Changes button.

Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads

Done? Okay, now I can get rational and calm again. Let me explain why you
made this change, and why it’s so important. When you run two ads in the
same ad group, Google shows them to different people and gives you statis-
tics on how each ad performed (see Chapter 13 for the gory — er, glorious —
details of split-testing). If Google optimizes your ad serving, the ads with
lower CTR get shown less and the ads with higher CTR get shown more.
Eventually, the poor performer stops showing, and Google declares a winner
by default. You set the test up once, and it runs without you from then on.
What could be bad?
First, your tests take much longer when you don’t give each ad an equal chance
to be “voted on” by searchers. You need a threshold number of impressions
and clicks for each ad to determine a statistical winner. If one ad gets fewer
and fewer impressions and clicks, it takes longer to declare that winner.
When you can’t declare winners as they happen, you learn slower. Think of
how fast bacteria adapt to antibiotics — because they go through so many
generations in a short time frame. The more iterations per time frame, the
more your ads can evolve and improve. AdWords is a playground where both
evolution and intelligent design rule.
You also lose money, because your campaigns are improving more slowly
than they might. Ad groups that could achieve profitability in a few days,
based on traffic, will take weeks or even months to start making money.
In the second-to-worst-case scenario, you don’t learn anything about your
market because you don’t even pay attention to the differences between the
winning and losing ads. You don’t learn which headlines work best, so you
can’t improve your Web site, your e-mails, your expensive offline advertise-
ments, and so on.
If you allow Google to optimize your ads, the absolute worst-case scenario
involves Google killing off the more effective ads by mistake. Google decides
ad effectiveness on the basis of CTR, not on whether the visitors who click an
ad end up buying. Often the highest CTR ads lose money because they attract
too many non-buyers.
Networks
As we saw in Chapter 1, you can show your text ad in any of three places:
Google pages, search partner pages, and the content network. The default
setting for each campaign includes all three networks. The trouble with this
setting is that the three sources of traffic generally behave very differently,
respond to different language and different offers, and don’t command the
same bid prices. You can set different bids for the content network, but a
cleaner way to separate the networks is to put each one in its own campaign.
See the later section, “Separating your account into three types of cam-
paigns” for details.
168
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

Locations
Google allows you as much geographical precision as you could possibly
need. The default setting is by country: Google gives you a list of countries
and you choose the ones whose inhabitants will see your ads. Straight-
forward and uncomplicated, this setting is common for online businesses
who can serve customers pretty much anywhere. If you sell downloadable
software, or telephone consulting, for example, you don’t have any reason to
exclude customers from Belgium or Israel or New Zealand, assuming lan-
guage compatibility. In my experience, certain African and Asian countries
tend to be hotbeds of credit-card fraud, however — and if you don’t think a
particular country will add a great deal to your bottom line, you may want to
leave it off your list.
Countries and territories
In its list of available countries and territories, accessible by clicking the Edit
button next to Countries and Territories, Google lists the most commonly
selected 24 countries at the top, beginning with the United States and contin-
uing alphabetically from Australia to United Kingdom. The following is a list
of dozens of countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Choose countries by
selecting them and clicking the Add button (as shown in Figure 7-5). You can
select multiple countries by holding down the Ctrl (Windows) or Ô (Mac)
keys as you click the country names. When your list is complete, click the
Continue button to return to the Edit Settings page.
You must save your changes on the Edit Settings page for them to take effect.
Regions and cities
If you want to target prospects more precisely, select the Regions and Cities
Option after clicking Edit on the main setting page and Change Option on the
Location Targeting Page. When you continue, you’ll be able to choose regions
from within a single country, as shown in Figure 7-6.
Figure 7-5:

Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads

If the country is the United States, you can select the States/Regions/Metro-
politan Areas radio button, and then select the areas you want from a list box.
Or you can select the Cities radio button and enter your own list of cities in
the format of city name state abbreviation: Durham NC or Roanoke VA. You can
toggle back and forth between these two radio buttons to complete your list.
Customized
If you run a local business, the regional and city targeting may not be precise
enough for you. After all, no matter how good a dry cleaner you may be, few
customers will drive 45 minutes across town to drop off their dress shirts.
Enter Customized targeting to the rescue. You get to that page by editing the
location targeting options, clicking the Change Option link, and clicking the
Customized radio button on the Location Targeting Options page. You’re given
two options: a circular area, or a wild and wacky polygon of your creation.
 Circular: After entering a physical address or centering the map at your
desired location (zoom way in by clicking the + button at the top left of
the map), you can enter a radius around that spot in miles or kilometers.
Figure 7-7 shows a radius of 30 miles around Charlottesville, Virginia.
 Multi-Point Option: Occasionally, a circle will not be precise enough.
What if, in Figure 7-7, I don’t want to show my ads in the Gordonsville
area and points northeast? Google sends a multi-point option to the
rescue. Below the map, click the Multi-Point Option link. Your map
reverts to global scale, and you can either enter coordinates like you’re
a World War I ace, or zoom in to your map location and draw a polygon
that defines your target area, as shown in Figure 7-8.

Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads

Separating your account into 
three types of campaigns
By default, Google wants to show each of your ads to as many people as pos-
sible. It’s good business for them, and possibly for you as well. But until you
separate out the traffic streams and evaluate each one individually, you’ll
never know. For most keywords, Google search converts best, search part-
ners second best, and content network worst. So it makes sense to test your
ads and keywords where they have the greatest chance of success before
rolling them out globally. Google is a little bit like Frank Sinatra’s “New York,
New York”: If you can make it there, you might be able to make it anywhere.
Separating your traffic by network is a little more complicated than it ought
to be, but that turns out to be a good thing. If it were easy, everyone would be
doing it and you would not be able to gain a competitive advantage.
Google Search
Your first campaign should probably be Google Search only. Creating a
Google Only campaign is simple. On the Edit Campaign Settings page,
uncheck the boxes next to Search Network and Content Network. Google has
a little snit when you uncheck that last box — and tries to convince you to
keep it checked and “pay less for content bids” (see Figure 7-10). Click OK to
ignore the entreaty, and then save your changes.

Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

This campaign will now show your ads only on Google pages; not AOL search,
not Earthlink, not Amazon.com. To confirm this setting, visit the Keywords
tab of one of the ad groups in this campaign and make sure the status of the
Content Network Total is Disabled.
Figure 7-11 shows an ad group with a messy campaign that mixed Search and
Content results. While the content network received more than 5 times the
impressions of the search network (78,396 vs. 17,565), it generated fewer than
1⁄5 of the clicks (36 compared to 203). My CTR on Search was a respectable
1.15%, but only 0.04% for Content. As a result, the noise from all those unclicked
impressions overwhelms my valuable data. My two ad CTRs are 0.32% and
0.17%, respectively, far below the Search average of 1.15%. I can’t tell at a
glance which ad works best for Search.
Search Network
As you’ve seen, Google happily shares its search results with AOL, Earthlink,
and other Search Partners. Google and AOL users are different from each other
in meaningful ways, and those differences can affect how they respond to your
ads. You probably can’t predict how those differences will affect response, so
the safest route is to separate the two streams and market to them separately.

173
Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads

On the Edit Campaign Settings page, uncheck the Google Search box but
leave the Search Network box checked . . . just kidding! You can’t do it;
Google won’t let you. You can’t target AOL without also targeting Google. You
can separate the streams by following this process:
1. Create two identical campaigns (see Chapter 9 for some timesaving
Campaign Modification tools).
The two campaigns should have the same settings, same ad groups, and
same keywords. Add the letter G (for Google) to the end of one of the
campaign names, and add S (for Search) to the other.
2. Change their Networks settings as follows:
• Campaign G: Check Google Search, uncheck Search Network,
uncheck Content Network.
• Campaign S: Check Google Search, check Search Network, uncheck
Content Network.
3. For the Campaign S, reduce all your bids to about five cents below the
Campaign G bids.
You’ve created two campaigns that compete with one another for exposure.
When they compete head to head on Google, the Campaign G will win because
it has the higher bids. Only Campaign S will show for the Search Network,
since Campaign G isn’t configured to show for that network. Voilà!
Content Network
You can add the content network by creating a third identical campaign, this
one with C after the name. For Campaign C, uncheck Google Search and
check Content Network.
Figure 7-12 shows a neat AdWords account with three campaigns each receiv-
ing different streams of traffic. The Google Search only campaign has the high-
est CTR, 0.79%, the Search Network is second with 0.50%, and the Content
campaign comes in lowest with 0.22%. Had those three traffic streams been
intermingled, I would have seen only a cumulative CTR of 0.33%. Notice also
the difference in average CPC: a Search Network click cost more than a Google
click, while the Content click was cheapest. Because this is a young AdWords
account, it’s too early to tell whether different ads work better with different
traffic streams, but experience tells me that’s often the case.
While people searching on Google expect organic listings and ads (after all,
that’s why they’re searching), ads on the Content Network are interruptions.
If you’re reading an article in the New York Times or managing your Gmail,
you haven’t asked a bunch of advertisers to vie for your attention. Your
Content ads must be extremely relevant, urgent, or curiosity provoking to
compete against the editorial content of a Web page. Your search ads may
only need to highlight a problem and offer a solution.
174
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

Your bidding strategy for the Content Network must achieve the goal of get-
ting your ad at or near the top position. Unlike a search-results page, AdSense
pages typically show from one to five text ads. Figure 7-13 shows the top of
the tuaw.com blog, with four AdSense ads between the header and the first
post. Three of them are iPod ads, but the fourth (“Find It All Right Here”) is
simply an ad that seems to get clicks (and make Google money) pretty much
anywhere. So your Mac- or iPod-related ad needs to be in positions 1, 2, or 3
to get any play on this popular blog.
Keyword and site targeting
If you show your ads on the Content network, how does Google decide which
AdSense publishers show your ads? You tell Google whether you want to bid

on pages that are optimized for your keywords, or whether you want to
choose specific sites for your ads.
In the old days (before June 2007), if you select Keyword Targeting, you
couldn’t tell which sites were showing your ads. Imagine sending a check to a
national TV network so your commercial would be shown on their affiliate
stations, but they refuse to tell you where and when (and even whether) your
ads will run. That’s what Google’s Content Network was like.
Just as this book was entering the “make another change and we’ll break your
fingers” stage, Google unveiled a new report that shows you which AdSense
Web sites are showing your ads and how well the ads are converting on each
AdSense page. To generate the Placement Performance report, you must first
set up Conversion Tracking (which you find out how to do in Chapter 14). See
www.askhowie.com/sitereports for instructions as well as examples of
the power of this long-awaited feature.
Your first campaign uses Keyword Targeting by default, and you can’t change
it. Once your first campaign is configured, you can create a Site-Targeted
Content Network campaign by clicking the Site-Targeted link next to + Create
a New Campaign on the Campaign Summary page.
Name your new campaign and your first ad group, choose the language or
languages your customers speak, and select your geographic target. Basically,
you’re selecting a group of people in some geographic area, from a small town
to the entire world, who visit certain Web sites. You can choose Rap/Hip-Hop
fans in the Midwest, Progressives in South Carolina, Evangelicals in Chicago,
and so on. Interest groups merged with geography can provide very tight,
responsive markets for your ads.
On the next page, you’re prompted to create an ad. You can create a second

ad to appear. Google doesn’t assume you know any specific sites. The wizard
prompts you to select from categories such as games or health, enter topic
words, name specific Web sites, or describe your audience and let Google
suggest Web sites matching that demographic, as shown in Figure 7-14.
If you type the topic Gout (as shown in Figure 7-15), Google returns a list of
55 Web sites, along with information like impressions per day and supported
ad formats (text, image, video). You can filter the results by clicking Choose

only those Web sites that have elected to serve ads of that size and shape.
If your desired audience is in the United States and you choose to target the
entire country, you can choose Web sites based on demographics. In the

Bidding Smart
Earlier in this chapter, I urged you not to let Google automatically determine
your bids. Eventually, when you have conversion tracking and analytics set
up (see Chapters 14 and 15), you can adjust your bids intelligently in response
to back-end conversion. When you first bid on a keyword, you want to balance
three objectives: getting valid data quickly, generating high CTRs for your
best keywords, and not losing the shirt off your back by paying too much for
too many unprofitable clicks.
Initial bidding strategies
AdWords and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) expert Don Crowther of
www.greatresults.com divides his keywords into three tiers for bidding
purposes:
 Money Makers: Specific keywords with large amounts of traffic, often
3–5 words long, that you expect will generate high CTRs.
Examples: gout foods to avoid, left-handed titanium
driver, iPod shuffle blue case
Bid to get those keywords in positions 1–3, the higher the better. Don
reports that position 1 can return a much higher CTR than any other
position. Think about it — position 1 is the first link the happy clickers
will see, so it’s likely to get more unqualified traffic than any other posi-
tion. Ordinarily you want to discourage unqualified clicks, but the first
thousand impressions help Google determine your keyword’s quality
score. A high CTR at the beginning may lower your maximum CPC by
telling Google your keyword is well matched to your ad.
After the first thousand impressions, lower your bid to achieve positions
4–8 and then continually adjust according to ROI (see Chapter 14 for
details on conversion tracking).
 Generic Terms: Category terms that lots of people use at the beginning
of their search process; these are usually one-to-two-word, short-tail 
keywords.
Examples: gout, golf club, iPod
Bid for positions 4–8 for generic terms. Rarely will you convert enough
of these searches to sales to justify the extra expense of positions 1–3,
and the traffic for these words can bankrupt you if you generate too
many clicks before optimizing your sales process.
179
Chapter 7: Deciding Where and When to Show Your Ads

 Long Shots: Keywords that may be extremely expensive or competitive,
or just tangentially related to your ad.
Examples: [gout cure] (top bid $2.77), [golf vacations] ($8.27),
[video ipod] ($6.61)
Bid wherever you can get some reasonable showing without breaking
your budget. Typically that will be around positions 7–10 (the second
page of search results typically cuts impressions by a factor of 10). Don
notes, “Sometimes I’ll be in spot 63, and I recognize that, and don’t
worry about it.” Some keywords are hyper-competitive, and your com-
petitors may have been testing and improving their campaigns for years.
Learn what you can from them, but don’t expect to be able to match
their results on your first try.
If your campaign is showing on the Content Network, you should bid to
appear in positions 1–3 for text ads, and position 1 for image and video ads.
Otherwise your ads won’t appear enough to for you to learn (or profit) from.
When you have data . . .
The initial bidding strategies should give way to data-informed bids as soon
as possible. After you set up conversion tracking and analytics (described in
Chapters 14 and 15, respectively), run keyword reports and adjust each key-
word to be profitable. One position will give you the highest ROI for each 
keyword, and you can usually find it through trial and error within a few hun-
dred clicks.
If your business doesn’t lend itself to conversion tracking because you can’t
track sales online, you’ll make adjustments on a much less precise basis. Aim
for positions 4–8 one month, 7–10 another month, and see what happens to
your business — keeping in mind any possible feedback lags due to the length
of your sales cycle. If your offline sales are a big part of your business, you can
learn about a fairly expensive strategy for including that data in your Google
reports at www.askhowie.com/offline. This strategy isn’t worth it for
small sales, but if your average sales exceed $150, it may pay for itself quickly.

hen you place an ad in the Yellow Pages, you can’t change it until the
next edition comes out. After the ad is in the Yellow Pages, your job is
to answer the phone, take care of customers, and pay the electricity bill.
Your AdWords account, on the other hand, frequently needs changes and
requires much more of your attention than a static advertisement. If you like
metaphors, you can equate your AdWords account to auto maintenance. If
you never change the oil, the engine will eventually die. However, with regu-
lar maintenance and tinkering, you can get it to a high-performance state
over time — and keep it there. Your AdWords account demands more atten-
tion up front, and then less and less as time goes on.
In this chapter, you discover tactics for improving your AdWords campaign
performance over time. I show you how to identify unprofitable keywords,
and what you can try before you fire them. I help you improve CTR by group-
ing similar keywords and targeting your ads more tightly to those keywords. I
divulge a strategy for resuscitating keywords that have been rendered inac-
tive because Google doesn’t like them. Finally, I show you a triage system that
allows you to focus your campaign management where it will bring the high-
est return.

Nurturing, Relocating, 
and Firing Keywords
Keywords connect people with ads. If the connection is right, the right
people find the right ads. As your AdWords campaigns mature, you’ll dis-
cover the best relationships between keywords and ads. Think of your key-
word list as a commission-only sales force, with each keyword a different
sales rep driving up and down the Internet looking for business:
 Stars: Some of keywords are stars, bringing in customers and profits on
a regular basis.
 Solid performers: These are good performers, making their numbers
without complaint but not setting the world on fire.
 Long tails: Still other keywords are harmless stay-at-homes, making you
nothing but costing you nothing either.
 Underperformers: A large number of your keywords underperform and
may be converted into solid producers by relocation to better territories.
 Negative ROI: Inevitably, you’ll find keywords that just aren’t worth
keeping — they may bring you some business, but their expense
accounts far exceed the value of their leads.
The following sections look at what to do about each of these keywords.
Star keywords
I’m going to take a wild guess about your AdWords account: I predict that 95%
of your Web site traffic is coming from fewer than 10 keywords. Maybe fewer
than five. I know this not because I’m psychic (I knew you were thinking that),
but because in the five years I’ve been helping people with AdWords, I’ve rarely
seen an account that wasn’t tilted in that direction. In fact, it’s not uncommon
for an online business to live or die based on a single keyword.
Your most important AdWords job is to identify these star keywords and give
them everything they need to be happy and healthy. Limos, special diets,
bathtubs filled with Perrier — these keywords must receive ongoing attention
if they are to perform at a high level.
Of course, keywords aren’t really pampered Hollywood stars, so my sugges-
tions in the previous paragraph are meant to be understood metaphorically.
What keywords really want are relevant ads in the right positions taking the
searcher to an appropriate landing page. All your keywords want this; your
182
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

job as an advertiser is to give it to them to the extent you can. But if you’re
building your campaigns correctly, with hundreds or thousands of long-tail
keywords, it’s easy to lump your star keywords in with the hoi polloi and lose
a lot of potential sales.
Give each star keyword its own ad group and landing page. The ads in that ad
group include the keyword at least once, possibly twice, and you check your
split tests regularly for a winner (see Chapter 13). The landing page tells your
visitors within 1.3 seconds that they’ve come to the right place; to the Web
site that has the answer to their deepest and most pressing desires.
If you didn’t connect with the Hollywood-stars metaphor, here’s one inspired
by my visit to the North Carolina State Fair last fall: Your hundreds or thou-
sands of keywords are like apples in your orchard, while the star keywords
are your prize milk-fed pumpkins. Each pumpkin gets as much attention as an
orchard of apples. (If you need more metaphors, you’re on your own.)
Finding star keywords
To identify your star keywords, follow these steps:
1. Log in to your AdWords account at www.google.com/adwords and get
to the Campaign Summary page (you may be taken there by default).
2. Sort your campaigns by clicking the Impr. (impressions) column, so
the campaign that has received the most impressions is at the top.
3. Click the top campaign name and repeat the sorting process with the
ad groups in that campaign.
4. In the most-trafficked ad group, click the Keywords tab.
You should see all your keywords already sorted by impressions, as
shown in Figure 8-1. The top one or two keywords are probably receiving
a lot more traffic than the rest.
Figure 8-1 tells a typical story: The top two keywords, [gout diet] and
gout diet, together have received 82% of the total impressions for this ad
group. A closer examination shows that [gout diet] is significantly under-
performing in terms of traffic: Its average position is 8.9, putting it on the
second page of search results much of the time. Were I to raise its bid, that
keyword alone would probably account for 95% of the impressions for this
group. (Whether that would be a profitable move depends on the cost per
conversion for that keyword, which you can explore in Chapter 14).
Moving a star to its own trailer
I know, back to the movie-star metaphor. It just amuses me to imagine [gout
diet] running around in dark sunglasses and a designer shirt. Giving a star
keyword its own ad group is a four-phase process:
183
Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management

1. Create a new ad group in the same campaign as its current ad group,
write an ad that connects strongly to the keyword, and add that key-
word only to the keyword list.
If it’s an exact match, with brackets, don’t worry about negative key-
words. If it’s a phrase or broad match, include negative keywords.
2. Bid a couple of cents higher on the keyword in the new ad group than
you were bidding in the old ad group, either by lowering the old bid
or raising the new one.
3. Create a new landing page specifically for that keyword.
4. When the keyword in the old ad group stops getting traffic in favor of
the new ad group, pause the keyword in the old ad group.
If you run into problems, you can always pause the new ad group and
unpause the old keyword.
Solid performers
Your solid performers are keywords that consistently generate decent num-
bers of impressions, but nowhere near the stratospheric output of the stars.
In Figure 8-2, the first four keywords generate two-thirds of the total impres-
sions. The next eight keywords are the solid performers, each generating
between 1400 and 6900 impressions.
Figure 8-1:

184
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

Keywords of a feather should flock together
Look at your keywords and see if you can group them into more tightly
focused ad groups, based on word similarity and CTR. For example, the key-
words in Figure 8-2 need to be divided into more tightly targeted ad groups,
based on word similarity and CTR.
The CTRs for the eight solid performers are as follows:
Keyword
Click-Through Rate
“cold calls”
2.25%
cold calls
2.01%
cold call techniques
0.81%
[cold call techniques]
1.20%
cold call scripts
1.14%
“cold calling techniques”
0.53%
[cold calls]
4.56%
making cold calls
1.91%
The range of CTRs is huge, with the best performing keyword, [cold calls],
generating Web site visitors at almost nine times the rate of the worst per-
Figure 8-2:
The

calls” to

185
Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management

former, “cold calling techniques”. And they’re all showing for the
same ad or ads. What this means is that the ads in this group have the poten-
tial to achieve a very nice 4.56% CTR, if they’re showing for the right key-
words. The keyword “cold calling techniques” is poorly matched to
the ads in this ad group, and should be moved to a different ad group with an
ad and landing page more specifically targeted to that desire.
The keywords in this ad group that don’t generate enough traffic to warrant
their own group should be divided as follows:
 Cold Calling Techniques ad group
• cold calling techniques
• [cold calling techniques]
• “cold calling techniques”
• Any other phrases that include the three words cold calling
techniques in any order
• Phrases with the three words with technique misspelled or
mistyped (for example, cold calling tehcniques)
• Phrases with the words cold call techniques (then split
those out if the CTRs are different)
 Cold Calls ad group
• [cold calls]
• “cold calls”
• cold calls
• making cold calls
• [making cold calls]
 Cold Call Scripts ad group
• cold call scripts
• “cold call scripts”
• [cold call scripts]
• Phrases with the three words with scripts misspelled or
mistyped (for example, scirpts)
• Any other phrases that include the three words cold call
scripts in any order
Determining your ad’s true potential
Sort the keywords in your ad group by the Clicks column. The keyword that’s
received at least 30 clicks with the highest CTR represents your ad’s potential.
186
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

All keywords that receive significantly lower CTRs don’t belong with that ad.
Typically, you’ll find that the highest CTR keywords are the ones echoed in
the headline of the ad.
Long-tail keywords
The long-tail keywords are the ones receiving low numbers of impressions, and
the occasional click. They just don’t get enough traffic to justify their own ad or
landing page, but collectively are worth bidding on because they are cheaper
than other keywords and convert better because there’s less competition.
These two factors lower your global average cost of customer acquisition, and
can mean the difference between a struggling and a dominant business.
Each one isn’t anything to write home about, but collectively they may be
doing more for your business than any of your top performers — just like the
hardworking character actors and lighting directors and third associate key
grips and assistant best boys who don’t get all the credit but without whom
the movies don’t get made. The names in the credits at the end of the movie
are the long-tail keywords.
Your long-tail keywords can be in big, undifferentiated groups with a generic
“problem/promise” ad: Headline describes the problem, Description Line #1
makes a big promise, Description Line #2 includes a feature and call to
action. (See Chapter 6 for details of ad writings)
You will improve performance by grouping the long-tail keywords by concept.
For the gout-campaign example, I used the following concepts to group long-
tail keywords:
 Diet: Keywords related to diet indicate, as best as I can tell, potential
customers who desire to take control and change aspects of their
lifestyle. Ads that reassure that such changes are quick and easy do well
with this group.
 Food: Food keywords, on the other hand, reflect a narrower mindset
related to specific foods to ingest or avoid, rather than a wholesale diet
change. Ads that ask ignorance-uncovering questions (What are the 3
worst gout foods? Is cherry juice for real?) will motivate this group.
 Remedy: People who type remedy are looking for home remedies and
folk medicine, as opposed to drugs or prevention. They like “secrets”
and “what doctors won’t tell you.”
 Symptom relief: People searching for gout pain, arthritis gout,
gout symptoms, and gout treatment view gout as a disease not entirely
under their control. An ad that immediately offers information about
diet and lifestyle change will alienate this group. Instead, empathize and
offer quick results.
187
Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management

Some of your long-tail keywords may receive no impressions at all for months
at a time. That’s okay. Since you pay commissions only on clicks, the sales-
person who never makes sales calls doesn’t cost you a bit.
Underperforming keywords
As we’ve seen, a keyword will underperform if it points to an ad that doesn’t
address the right desires, or if that ad is positioned too high or too low (based
on that keyword’s maximum CPC). If the problem is too few impressions,
check your average position for that keyword. Your ad may be showing on
page 4, where few searchers are willing to go. Or your ad may be lower than
third position in a Content Network campaign.
Sometimes your keywords deliver lots of impressions but few clicks. In that
case, the problem is the ad itself: what it says or where it’s showing. Move
your keyword to an ad group that addresses the desire represented by that
keyword. Increase your bid to a more desirable position.
Negative-ROI keywords
Once you set up conversion tracking (described in Chapter 14), you’ll discover
that some keywords appear to be doing well within the AdWords account —
lots of traffic, good CTR — but don’t convert to sales well enough to justify
the cost of their clicks. This type of underperformance is especially insidious
because it’s hard to identify. I’ll show you how to spot these Expense-Account
Gluttons that cost you more than they make for you in Chapter 14.
You deal with negative-ROI keywords by first trying the tactic just described
for underperforming keywords: point them to better ads. If the increased CTR
doesn’t make them profitable, add negative qualifiers like price and other dis-
incentives to click (see Chapter 6). If nothing works, you have to let them go.
Don’t worry about them — someone else will blissfully (and cluelessly) con-
tinue losing money on those keywords. Just don’t let it be you.
Resuscitating Poor-Quality Keywords
In July 2006, Google rolled out a change to its bid-price algorithm that left
many advertisers bruised and confused. Its nickel keywords were now dis-
abled, and required bids of at least $10.00 to reactivate. The big change was
the addition of a new metric — Keyword Quality Score. Google returned to its
188
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

roots as the provider of quick and relevant results, and began penalizing
advertisers whose ads and Web sites weren’t appropriate for the keyword.
The quality-score algorithm continues to evolve, and no one outside the hal-
lowed halls of Google knows exactly what it is, but the trend is clear: You’ve
got to give the people who see your ad a good experience all the way through
to your Web site. To Google, a good experience means customers can find
what they want quickly and easily, with no hassle.
Figure 8-3 shows the difference between keywords with Great and OK quality
scores. The average bid for a Great keyword is 4 cents, compared to 10 or 15
cents for an OK keyword. If you could scroll down the page, you’d feel my
pain at seeing a bunch of Poor-quality keywords asking me to ante up at 50
cents a throw.
The product I sell from this ad group is not expensive and does not lead to a
big back end. If I can’t get the click in under 10 cents, I can’t survive in this
market. My important keywords (the star and solid performers) must receive
Great quality scores. The majority of the long-tail keywords must be deemed
either Great or OK.
Figure 8-3:
The
keywords
with a Great
quality
score are
much less
expensive to

189
Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management

To resuscitate a keyword, follow these steps:
1. Move it to a new ad group.
2. Write a new ad with a message targeted specifically for that keyword.
3. Link the ad to a new landing page written with that searcher in mind.
(See Chapter 10 for landing-page dos and don’ts.)
Managing the 80/20 Way
This chapter is deceptively short, because the work it asks you to do can be
time-consuming. It’s maintenance, not setup — and it’s tempting to do main-
tenance once and not peek under the hood again until you smell oil. (Yup, back
to the car metaphor.) Especially after you’ve divided your campaigns into
many focused ad groups, you can find yourself drowning amid the priorities
competing for your attention. This section gives you some guidance in answer-
ing the only question that ever matters at this point: “What do I do now?”
The 80/20 Principle states that 80% of your efforts lead to only 20% of your
results, while the remaining 20% of your efforts is responsible for 80% of your
results. The top 20% of your keywords will generate 80% of your clicks and
sales. Don’t get hung up on the exact numbers — you’ll probably find that the
ratio in AdWords is closer to 95/5 or 99/1.
In any case, the moral is the same: Consciously spend your time and focus
your attention on the parts of your AdWords account that have the biggest
impact on your profitability.
Each AdWords account is different, so I can’t give you a formula for how to
spend your time. The key skills here are threefold:
 Knowing the key priorities for your business.
 Sorting your campaigns, ad groups and keyword lists by those priorities.
 Always addressing the issue that can provide the biggest boost to your
bottom line.
The factor limiting the growth of most online businesses is the size of the reach-
able market. In AdWords, the reachable market consists of people searching for
your keywords or visiting Web sites that display your ads. The AdWords metric
for this market is impressions — instances of exposure to your ad.
190
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

After you log in to your account, click into a campaign. Look at the statistics
for each ad group. You’re looking to answer the question, “Which ad group’s
improvement will have the biggest impact on my business?” In general, I focus
on the ad group with the highest potential number of impressions. In Figure 8-4,
for example, the Causes of Gout PS group’s average position is 8.3, meaning it
shows on the second page of search results and not at all in the content net-
work. If I increased my bids, the traffic would increase, probably to 10 times
its current amount.
If the average position of an ad group is 7 or better within a search campaign,
or 3 or better in a content campaign, then you are theoretically getting as
many impressions as possible. If an ad group averages position 8 or worse (4
for content), your ads aren’t getting seen by as many people as possible.
First, sort by impressions, and note any ad groups whose average positions
are too low. They are potential sleepers, if you can afford the bids needed to
get your ads in front of people.
Figure 8-4:

ment.
191
Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management

Let me plug a microphone into my head so you can hear my thinking about
Figure 8-4:
“Okay, let’s see. I have four big ad groups, with over 100,000 impressions
so far this year. The most expensive group is the top one. I’ve spent over
$400 on it since January. Its CTR gets an OK rating, but I definitely can
improve it. If I doubled the CTR, I would increase my Web traffic by 5500
people over the next couple of months. If I doubled the CTR on my next
biggest group, Gout Diet, the same amount of effort would get me only
2000 more visitors. Oh, and look at the fourth group, Gout. The CTR is
miserable, just 0.26%. I could probably improve it by a factor of 8, getting
it to 2.00% with a little split-testing and rearranging of keywords. That
would give me about 3000 additional visitors (280 × 8). And it’s usually
easier to improve a bad ad than an OK one, so maybe that’s a good place
to start.”
I click the Gout ad group and view the keyword tab (see Figure 8-5).
“Oh, look, the top eight keywords’ CTRs are doing pretty well. While I’m
here, I’ll pause “the gout” because it got 332 impressions and not a
single click. The big problem here is the content network — my ads are
generating lots of impressions but few clicks.”
Figure 8-5:
My keyword
list tells that
my CTR
problem is
caused by
the content
network.
192
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

Look at the total number of impressions in Figure 8-5: 19,122. Compare that to
the total in Figure 8-4, which was over 100,000. That means about 80,000
impressions are from content.
“Obviously my ads are aimed at people who are searching for a solution
to their gout problem, rather than people who are reading about gout and
need a powerful ad to interrupt them into taking action.
“And goodness gracious me!” (Yes, sadly, that is how I talk to myself. 
You have no idea how annoying it can be.) “Except for the gout recipes
keywords, my quality scores are just OK. I need to move the other high-
potential keywords into their own ad groups and write better ads and
send them to more tightly targeted landing pages. Then my dime bids can
get my ads on the first page and skyrocket my traffic without harming 
my ROI.”
When you install conversion tracking, you’ll have another data point upon
which to act. When you find an ad group that delivers negative ROI (see
Chapter 14), do something at once. Either attempt a fix, or pause it, or delete
it. But again, the order in which you act depends on the potential value of the
improvement. A miniscule improvement in an ad group that gets lots of
impressions is more valuable than a big improvement in an ad group consist-
ing of seldom-seen long-tail keywords.
As you spend time in AdWords, you’ll get the hang of where to focus, and
you’ll develop your own rhythm and intuition for what needs adjustment. The
main thing to keep in mind is the 80/20 question: “What can I do now that will
make the biggest difference in results?”
Split-testing ads and adjusting your bids are the sexy parts of AdWords man-
agement. Putting the right keywords together with the right ads and landing
pages is more like nailing up the studs of a house than putting in the fancy
trim. (Yes, campers, one final metaphor for today!) Nobody visits a show
house and says, “My, those two-by-fours sure are straight.” AdWords
Consultant Greg Marsden e-mailed me these words of wisdom (so blame him
for the metaphor):
Simply put, it’s the solid scalable architecture of your campaigns that needs
to come first before you pick the curtains out and decide what color to paint
the door of your store. Virtually everyone I’ve worked with on AdWords
completely misses that point and spends almost all of their time, effort and a
ton of wasted money on frantically changing their ad texts just trying to find
a “‘super ad” that’ll magically double CTR and save the day.
193
Chapter 8: Improving Your Campaigns through Keyword Management

Greg went on to relate that three items on his to-do list increased the amount
of traffic to his Web site by 50% with no loss of quality:
 Separating content and search traffic (see Chapter 7).
 Building separate keyword lists for content and search.
 Expanding and tightly grouping keywords, particularly on the 
content side.
You can see the details of Greg’s case study in Chapter 17.

hen my father was 12 years old in 1930, his Uncle Freddie offered to
take him to a Newark Bears minor-league baseball game. With the
Depression raging, he couldn’t afford the ticket on his own, so he accepted
the offer from his notoriously stingy (and occasionally just notorious) uncle.
Upon arriving at the ballpark, Uncle Freddie hustled them away from the
turnstiles, around the stadium to the fence abutting the farthest outfield
bleachers. Once there, Freddie knelt down and instructed my father to climb
on his back and grab the top of the fence.
With a last-gasp boost by Freddie, my father vaulted the fence and toppled
into the ballpark, right on top of a pair of cops hired to keep order at the rau-
cous venue. One of the policemen roughly lifted my father up by the collar and
inquired of the quivering youth, “Don’t you know these games are free for kids?”
A whole industry of third-party tools has grown up around Google AdWords.
Some of them, in my opinion, are indispensable (see my recommendations in
Bonus Chapter 1, available as a PDF file at www.dummies.com/go/adwords).
Others are convenient and may be worth it because of the time they save.
But many are simply duplicates of free tools included (but buried) within
your AdWords account. You may never need most of them. But in memory of
my father’s early brush with the law, I hereby introduce you to a bunch of
tools that come free with AdWords. Don’t let Uncle Freddie sucker you into
missing out or paying extra.
The purpose of this chapter is to give you an overview of each of the free tools
included with your AdWords accounts and its function, so you know to use it
when you need it. This chapter is not intended to be an in-depth explanation of

each tool’s complete functionality. Visit www.askhowie.com/gtools for video
tutorials that show you how to use them, one step at a time.
Improving Your Campaigns 
with the Optimizer Tools
Google offers free tools for your ad campaign on the Tools page. To go to the
Tools page, log on to your AdWords account, go to the Campaign
Management page, and then click the Tools link under the Campaign
Management tab.
Google provides four tools under the heading Optimize Your Ads that, oddly
enough, focus entirely on keywords rather than ads. I don’t know if Google
intended this title as a bit of cryptic wisdom, but wise it is: The quality of the
ad is completely dependent on the match between it and the keyword that
triggers it.
Keyword tool
You’ve met the Keyword tool in Chapters 4 and 5, so in this chapter I’ll
explore some additional features. It’s great for generating ideas for additional
keyword families that you might not have thought of, both from the pages of
your competitors and from Google’s vast database of search behavior (for
example, people who search mortgage often end up on pages related to
home loans and many people who type home loan return to Google a little
later and search on mortgage as well). You can also use it to brainstorm neg-
ative keywords that your best prospects would not be typing.
You can generate new keywords either by entering one or more keywords in
the text box under the Keyword Variations tab, or entering a Webpage URL
under the Site-Related Keywords tab. Either way, Google will return a list of
keywords related to your market. You can select the data that will display
next to each keyword: search volume, bid price and ad position estimates, or
search volume trends.
Search volume
If you request search volume data, Google returns two columns next to each
keyword. The first shows the relative search volume for the keyword during
the previous full month for which data is available. The numbers are updated
quickly; I took the screenshot shown in Figure 9-1 on June 1 and it already
included all of May. Google doesn’t give you absolute numbers here, just
comparisons. The Traffic Estimator tool (see the “Traffic Estimator tool” 
section) provides projected numbers of impressions.
196
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

The Advertiser Competition column shows, again in relative terms, how
many competitors are bidding on that keyword. If the entire rectangle is
shaded, the keyword is highly competitive, at least in terms of number of
competitors. Don’t let large numbers of competitors scare you away from a
keyword or a market without researching further: The competitors may be
easy to beat through split testing (see Chapter 13) and intelligent campaign
architecture (see Chapters 7 and 8).
The right-hand column allows you to add any or all of the keywords to the ad
group of your choosing. Notice that the column header prompts you for
Match Type: Broad, Phrase, or Exact. The broad match keyword is the
default. Try changing it to exact and see how the search volume and competi-
tion data change.
Don’t confuse the broad, phrase, and exact terms at this stage of your keyword
research — they are likely to perform very differently. If you do use this tool for
adding keywords to your ad groups, do it carefully. I recommend scrolling to
the bottom of the page and downloading the keywords to a text file or spread-
sheet first, before dumping them into an ad group. You’ll have much more con-
trol and will create better organized and better performing campaigns.
Cost and ad position estimates
You can also choose to display cost and ad position estimates for the key-
word list, based on a Max CPC of your choosing. Select Cost and Ad Position
Estimates from the Choose Data to Display drop-down list, and then enter a
Figure 9-1:

value for the maximum CPC in the US Dollars (USD $) text box. If a visitor to
your Web site is worth $0.43, for example, you can use this tool to find key-
words that will break even at worst. Enter .43 and click the Recalculate
button.
The Recalculate button didn’t work about half the time I was playing with it. If
this bug hasn’t been fixed by the time you read this, simply click the Get More
Keywords button again to display the estimated average CPC and ad positions
for your keywords (shown in Figure 9-2). You can sort by Estimated Ad Position
to find the profitable keywords that will position your ad advantageously.
Figure 9-3 shows the phrase match keywords that you can afford to show on
the Content network. If you’re building a comprehensive list, remember to
repeat the process for all three keyword types: broad, phrase, and exact.
To find out Google’s estimate of the CPC for each keyword for position #1,
enter 100 (for $100) in the US Dollars (USD $) text box.

Search Volume Trends
The third option in the Choose Data to Display drop-down list is Search
Volume Trends. This option gives you the average search volume along with
two potentially interesting modifiers: the trend over the past 12 months for
which data has been collected (the lag is usually a couple of months), and
the month in which the search volume was highest.
The mortgage market is steady, with most keywords’ trend lines staying
pretty flat. A keyword like gifts shows huge seasonal fluctuation. The key-
words birthday gifts and wedding gifts are steady, but Christmas
gifts, personalized gifts, and unique gifts skyrocket in December
and January and languish for the rest of the year, as shown in Figure 9-4.
I recommend a quick check on the seasonal trends in your marketplace as
part of your online due diligence, so you don’t start beating up on perfectly
good campaigns in February because they’ve stopped sending you traffic.

Chapter 9: Getting It Done with AdWords Tools

Possible negative keywords
The Possible Negative Keywords option from the Choose Data to Display
drop-down list shows you related searches and gives you an easy way to hide
your ads from searches containing irrelevant words. For example, if you sell
soccer equipment and clothing in the United States, you would find many
negative keywords upon entering Soccer in the text box, as shown in Figure
9-5. If you sell Diadora shoes but not Adidas, consider adding -Adidas to
your keyword list.
Edit your campaign’s negative keywords
This tool can save you time and hassle if each campaign represents a broad
market. If one campaign includes ad groups for homeschooling math curric-
ula, scuba gear, magic tricks, and seminars on how to take advantage of 
frequent-flier-miles programs, you have no need for campaign-wide negative
keywords. If, on the other hand, your Whiteboards campaign consisted of ad
groups for Magnetic Whiteboards, Porcelain Whiteboards, Commercial
Whiteboards, Whiteboard Cleaners, Whiteboard Pens, and so on, you can use
this tool to consolidate all the negative keywords in one master list. If you
create a new ad group, you don’t need enter the negative keywords into that
group’s keyword list. Some negative keywords might include these:
Figure 9-4:

netmeeting
Microsoft
java
msn
These keywords refer to online virtual whiteboards, not the ones that hang
on your office walls and get ruined by the schlemiel who uses a permanent
marker by accident.
You can generate campaign-wide negative keywords in one of two ways. You
can enter the negative keywords manually, or “sweep” them out of individual
ad groups into the campaign.
 Manual exclusion: First, select a campaign from the Campaign drop-
down list near the top of the page. If your campaign is new, place the
negative keywords into the text box and click the Add Keywords button.
You’ll see them appear in the table at the bottom of the page.
 Clean Sweep: If your ad groups already contain negative keywords, you
can consolidate them using Clean Sweep. You can choose to sweep nega-
tive keywords found in every single group (choose All Ad Groups from
the Campaign drop-down list), at least 75% of them, at least 50% of them,
or keywords found in any ad group. Once Clean Sweep has run, you can
decide which negative keywords to apply to the campaign as a whole
and which to leave in their original groups only.

Chapter 9: Getting It Done with AdWords Tools

Site Exclusion tool
The Site Exclusion tool allows you to choose particular Web sites (and parts
thereof) where you don’t want your ads to show. This tool is relevant only for
campaigns that show in the Content network.
If you want to keep your ads off an entire Web site, enter the top-level domain
with and without the www prefix: www.fitfam.com and fitfam.com. To
keep your ads from showing in a specific cheesy subdomain or directory
within a Web site, include that information: cheesysection.fitfam.com
or www.fitfam.com/cheesysection and fitfam.com/cheesysection.
You can also specify a particular page, such as www.fitfam.com/
embarrassingpage.html for exclusion.
You must set site exclusion separately for each campaign.
Traffic Estimator tool
The Traffic Estimator can quickly help you avoid markets and market seg-
ments that simply don’t generate enough search volume to justify a cam-
paign, as well as help you estimate your sales volume and profitability. This
tool calculates search traffic only, from Google and its partners. It does not
include clicks you may receive from sites on the Content network.
Begin by entering a keyword or keywords into the text box at the top of the
page. Next, enter a very high Maximum CPC. I always start with Google’s max-
imum, $100, to find out what Google thinks I’ll have to pay to get position #1.
Ignore the daily budget for right now; since you’re talking about $100 clicks,
you can enjoy fantasyland a little longer.
Now, choose your customers’ languages and locations, just as you would in
setting up a new campaign (see Chapter 7). Click Continue to see how much
Google thinks you’ll pay for the top spot for each keyword, and how many
clicks each one will generate. Google assumes your ads’ CTRs will be the
same as those of current advertisers bidding on these keywords. If your ads
are more attractive, your average CPCs will be correspondingly lower.
In Figure 9-6, the top position for Whiteboard keywords can be had for $3–5
per click. Assuming your ads are as appealing (or unappealing) as everyone
else’s, Google thinks you’ll be parting with $480–$660 per day for the privi-
lege of showing your ads in position #1 to viewers in the U.S. and Canada.
Based on its data for ads showing at that position for these keywords, Google
estimates 108–117 visitors per day to your Web site (let’s call it 112.5 on aver-
age). If your Web site can turn exactly 3% of your visitors into paying cus-
202
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

tomers, and your average order amount is $500 at a 50% profit margin, then
your gross daily profit from this campaign will be, on average, $843.75 ($500 ×
.50 margin × 3.375 sales). Subtracting the daily advertising spend (let’s call it
$520), your net at the end of each day is $323.75.
Download this table as a spreadsheet readable by Microsoft Excel by clicking
the Download as .csv button at the bottom of the page. After you’ve saved
the table, enter a saner amount in the Maximum CPC text box at the top left,
and then click the Get New Estimates button. In Figure 9-7, you can see the
results of capping your maximum bid at $2.00.
Now you get around 80 clicks per day for around $120. Assuming the same
Web-site conversion process, you average 2.4 sales per day, for a daily profit
of $600.00. Subtracting your AdWords costs leaves you with $480 net profit.
Bidding lower and generating fewer clicks appears more profitable, based on
this simulation.
The Web-site conversion for clicks not from position #1 is likely to be higher,
because your ad attracts fewer happy clickers and more serious prospects.
The lower bid is likely to be even more profitable than the preceding scenario
projects.

203
Chapter 9: Getting It Done with AdWords Tools

Keep playing with the Maximum CPC until you find the scenario that pro-
duces the highest net profit. You can become even more granular by adding
individual Max CPCs to the keywords, using the keyword**1.50 format on
the first page of the Traffic Estimator. Until you track the actual sales perfor-
mance of keywords (so you know exactly the optimal bid for profitability),
the Traffic Estimator is a good place to start.
Saving Time with the Campaign
Modification Tools
In case you’ve forgotten, Google is pretty good at search. So it should come
as no surprise that Google lets you search for keywords and snippets of ad
text within your account, and lets you move or copy those keywords and ads
from one location to another.
To access the Campaign Modification tools, log on to your AdWords account,
go to the Campaign Management page, and click the Tools link under the
Figure 9-7:

Campaign Management tab. Look under the Modify Your Campaign heading
and click the appropriate tool’s link.
Copy and moving keywords
To copy or move keywords, click the Copy or Move Keywords and Ad Text
link on the Tools page. Select Search for Keywords, and then choose either to
move or copy those keywords to a different ad group. Typically you’ll move
keywords within campaigns and copy them to different campaigns.
Narrowing the search terrain
When you click Continue, you’ll see a dizzying range of search choices and
delimiters (see Figure 9-8). You can search all campaigns, choose specific
campaigns based on words in the name (a good reason not to name them
Campaign #1, Campaign #2, and so on), and select campaigns based on status
(active, paused, or deleted). You can also narrow the search to ad groups
with specific words in their names.
Figure 9-8:

205
Chapter 9: Getting It Done with AdWords Tools

Instead of narrowing your search landscape based on your input, you can
click the Pick from a List link and choose particular campaigns and ad
groups.
Selecting keywords
After you’ve told Google which campaigns and ad groups to search, the next
step is to indicate the keywords you’re looking for. You can enter one or
many keywords in the text box, and search for them exactly as written — as
whole words within larger keyword phrases, or as any part of the keyword.
For example, selecting Matches Exactly from the Keyword drop-down list and
entering Cold in the text box would find just the keyword Cold. Selecting the
Contains option from the Keyword drop-down list would give you Cold
Calling, Cold Calls, and Scold. Selecting the Contains Full Word option
from the Keyword drop-down list eliminates Scold, but keeps all the key-
words that contain the whole word Cold.
The more powerful search functions relate to the CPC and performance his-
tory of the keyword. You can find all keywords in your account with a current
CPC of $2.00 or greater by leaving the $ text box blank and choosing Is
Greater Than or Equal To from the Current Keyword CPC drop-down list and
entering 2 in the $ text box. You can also select an option from the
Performance History drop-down list to search for keywords by the following
elements of their historical performance: cost, number of clicks, CTR, aver-
age CPC, average position, and number of impressions.
You can also select or eliminate keywords according to match type (by
selecting the Broad Match, Phrase Match, or Exact Match check boxes) and
status (by selecting the Active, Paused, or Inactive check boxes). Spend some
time playing with the various settings and see what keyword lists Google
gives you when you click Continue at the bottom of the page.
After you’ve generated a list of keywords (as shown in Figure 9-9), you can
select and deselect individual ones, or do a batch move or copy. Click the
Continue button to choose the destination ad group. If you want to move
associated ad texts as well, select the Yes - Pick Ad Texts in the Next Step
check box, and then click the Continue button.
If you elected to move or copy ad text, you’ll be prompted to select the ads to
move or copy in the next step. When you’re done selecting ads, you go
straight to a choice of one ad group — into which you dump all your choices,
as shown in Figure 9-10. If you want to move keywords and ads into multiple
groups, repeat the process for each group.

Chapter 9: Getting It Done with AdWords Tools

Copying and moving ad text
The process for selecting ad text is almost identical to the keyword process.
The main difference is a new set of criteria for ads. You can search the entire
ad, or any of the five lines: Headline, Description Line 1, Description Line 2,
Display URL, or Destination URL. You can also specify Active or Paused ads.
Once you run the search, Google shows you the ads that fit your search para-
meters. Again, you can click the Continue button to move or copy those ads,
or select the check box at the lower left that allows you to select keywords
associated with those ads.
Getting Feedback from Google 
with the Ad Performance Tools
When you put an ad in your local paper or hire a kid to wear a chicken suit in
July and hand out flyers for your Buffalo Wings Shack, it’s pretty easy to tell
whether the ad appears or the kid shows up and shakes his tail feathers. The
world of online advertising is not so apparent, so Google provides some tools
to help you monitor where and when your ads are showing.
To use the Ad Performance tools, log on to your AdWords account, go to the
Campaign Management page, and click the Tools link under the Campaign
Management tab. Click the link for the tool you want to try out under the
Analyze Your Ad Performance heading.
The Conversion Tracking tool is important enough to merit its very own
chapter, so I don’t belabor it in this chapter. Flip to Chapter 14 to find out all
about the Conversion Tracking tool.
Ads Diagnostic tool
Want to find out whether searchers are seeing your ads for your favorite key-
words? Click the Ads Diagnostic Tool link on the Tools page. With the Ads
Diagnostic tool, you can enter a keyword, choose parameters, and ask Google
to indicate the ads that appear for a given search term. In Figure 9-11, Google
will show the ads that appear in the Chicago, IL area for the phrase-match
keyword IT consultant.
208
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

Note that you are not limited to the straight www.google.com search; you can
also check other Google domains such as froogle.com, maps.google.com,
google.co.za (the South African Google home page), and so on by entering
the URL in the Google Domain text box. You can specify a geographic loca-
tion, just as you do when targeting a campaign, choose the language(s) your
customers speak, and even specify individual IP addresses for laser targeting.
This is very useful for advertisers who can’t see what their far-flung
prospects in other regions or countries are viewing during searches.
Google offers a second option to diagnose a missing ad. Option 2: Search
Results Page URL, at the bottom of the page, allows you to paste the entire
URL of a search page into the Search Results Page URL text box. To use this
option, open another Web browser window, perform a Google search, and
then select and copy the entire text of the URL in the Address bar.
To be sure you’ve selected the entire address, perform the following steps:
1. Right-click anywhere within the URL in the Address bar and choose
Select All.
2. Right-click again and choose Copy.

3. Return to the Ad Diagnostic tool, right-click your cursor in the Option
2 text box and select Paste.
4. Click the Continue button.
For either option, when you click the Continue button, Google shows you not
only the ads that will show for that keyword, but also the ads that you would
like to show, but aren’t. Google also provides tips and strategies for fixing the
problem, as shown in Figure 9-12.
Your ad might be slacking off for a number of reasons:
 Ad not showing on first page: Your ad is showing, but not on the first
page. Google suggests raising your minimum bid, increasing your CTR,
or targeting more specific keywords.
 Ad not shown because of low quality keyword: Google gives each key-
word a quality score (see Chapter 7). If your keyword quality is Poor or
OK, Google penalizes you by making that keyword more expensive. Your
options here include improving the keyword-to-ad-to-landing-page match
(opening your mind) or bidding higher (opening your wallet).
Figure 9-12:

ads aren’t

and what

210
Part III: Managing Your AdWords Campaigns 

 Ad not shown because one of your other ads is showing for this key-
word: Google lets your campaigns and ad groups compete against each
other, but will let only one win at a time. You won’t see two of your ads
showing for the same keyword, even if you bid on that keyword in multi-
ple ad groups or campaigns. Google chooses the one with the highest
ranking, which generally means the one that makes Google the most
money (they aren’t stupid). If you want the missing ad to show, either
decrease the duplicate keyword(s) or raise your bid on this keyword.
 Ad not shown because of paused campaign, ad group, or keyword: If
you’ve paused a part of your account, Google will stop showing it.
Obvious, yes, but when accounts get large, it’s easy to forget that you
never turned that ad group back on after pausing it for maintenance.
 Ad not shown because negative keyword or Non-Family Safe classi-
fication is preventing your ad from showing: If you’ve dumped a lot 
of negative keywords into your campaigns or ad groups, you may have
inadvertently caused a conflict between a positive and negative key-
word. The Non-Family Safe classification means that your ad is deemed
inappropriate for minors, and will be shown only to searchers who turn
off the adult filters (few do). Unless you’re selling adult entertainment (I
love that euphemism!), make sure your ads would be at home on Captain
Kangaroo.
 Ad not shown because disapproved ads or keywords: If your ad is dis-
approved due to a violation of Google’s editorial guidelines (see https://
adwords.google.com/select/guidelines.html for the actual doc-
ument you “signed” when you gave Google your first five dollars), you
can use the next tool to discover possible remedies.
Disapproved ads
I’m such a good boy, I can’t show you screen shots for disapproved ads. The
best I can do is let you see what happens when I try to write one, as shown in
Figure 9-13.
Some ads can be fixed by requesting exceptions. If you sell MAS90 account-
ing software, originally created by Best Software, you may be able to use 
the Best brand name. If you use a medical term in an ad, you may trigger the
“Uh-oh, it’s a Canadian Pharmacy” policy. Click the Request an Exception link
and explain to a live Google editor why this rule doesn’t apply to your ad or
keyword in 300 characters or fewer (now’s not a good time to go into your
childhood).
211
Chapter 9: Getting It Done with AdWords Tools

My Change History tool
The My Change History tool was created for those suffering from CRetTNS
(Can’t Remember to Take Notes Syndrome). You can find specific changes by
filtering out the irrelevant ones. Google allows you to filter changes by date,
campaign and ad group, users (in case you set up more than one user for
your account), and type of change.
I find this tool useful when I want to examine my campaign or run a report to
see the effects of a particular change. You can specify start and end dates in
the Campaign Summary control panel and in reports. The My Change History
tool helps you remember which dates to select to get a clean experiment.
For example, let’s say you lowered a bunch of bids around the beginning of
March, but you can’t remember exactly when, and you want to see the effect
this change has had on your business.
Figure 9-14 shows three Max CPC changes, two on February 13 and one on
March 2 at 1:30 p.m. You can now look at the two weeks prior to March 2 and
the two weeks following March 2 (for example) to compare your statistics for

these two phases of the experiment. You can look at impressions, clicks,
average position, total cost, conversions, sales, and such. If the only differ-
ence in the two periods is the change you identified, you have learned some-
thing by isolating that variable in time using the My Change History tool.
Even though you can fall back on this tool, please spend a buck on a note-
book and pretend you’re in high-school chemistry class again. Taking notes
on your questions and changes helps you monitor your account more seri-
ously, and puts you in an observant and curious AdWords mindset.

U
p to this page, the book has been devoted to
AdWords. In other words, you now know how to
give money to Google. This is the part that shows you
how to make money from paying customers — hopefully,
more than you spend on AdWords.
In Chapter 10, I cover the vital importance of dedicated
landing pages that quickly begin scratching the itch
expressed in the keyword and inflamed in the ad. You’ll
uncover how to get your visitors to say, “This is for me”
within one second of their arrival at your site.
I expound on my favorite topic, e-mail follow-up, in
Chapter 11. No matter how wonderful your Web site, if
you don’t stay in touch with prospects and customers,
they’ll forget all about you. This chapter gives you the
strategies to stay in touch with your Web site’s visitors
long after they’ve left your site, and shows you stunningly
powerful and inexpensive tools that put follow-up on
autopilot.
Chapter 12 covers a wide array of other Web-site strate-
gies, all of them based on the time-tested principles of
direct marketing: engagement, calls to action, and ascend-
ing levels of value exchange and intimacy.

W
hen (potential) customers click your ad and your Web site appears,
they will decide whether to stay and shop or return to Google within 7
seconds. Everything about your landing page will either persuade your visi-
tor to stay and play, or hit the Back button and never darken your door again.
Don’t just send customers to your site’s home page. You have the ability to
send your visitors to the page of their dreams, the one that quickly grants
them their fondest wish, that scratches the itch they’ve never quite been able
to reach before, that dreams the impossible dream — sorry, I was channeling
Richard Kiley there for a minute. Deep breath. Orchestra fades. Where was I?
The text, the pictures, the design, the loading speed, the contact information,
the logos, multimedia, and opportunities for interaction all combine to create
a gestalt, an instant impression of Perfect Fit, Run Away Screaming, or some-
thing in between. Old-school direct marketers have favored text over graph-
ics, based on years of experience with ugly magazine ads and Courier-font
direct-mail sales letters. That works for some markets, but not most. The 
Web is a different medium from print, one in which design speaks as loudly 
as words.
Your AdWords landing page must impress two suitors: Google, and your Web
site’s visitor. This chapter shows you how to make landing pages that are highly
relevant to the keywords and ads that point to them. You discover the most
important purpose of a landing page, along with several strategies for achieving
that purpose. You find out a few sneaky tricks for building multiple landing
pages by doing the work just once. I show you the elements of a landing page
than you can tweak to improve performance, and discuss briefly the things you

need to know about search engine optimization to increase the quality scores of
the keywords pointing to your landing pages.
Making Your Visitor Shout 
“That’s for Me!”
Perry Marshall of www.perrysmarshall.com shares a wallet-walloping 
calculation that should convince you to spend a lot of quality time working
on your landing pages:
Let’s say you pay 50 cents for a click and Barbara in Oregon goes to your
Web site and spends eight seconds seeing what you’re selling . . . then
leaves.
50 cents divided by 8 seconds is $225.00 per hour.
Barbara in Oregon’s attention is pretty expensive, wouldn’t you say?
Now, maybe Barbara was never your customer. She clicked because your ad
aroused her curiosity, or was cute, or implied or promised something for
nothing. Oh, well, can’t win them all. But most Web-site owners are told to be
satisfied with conversion percentages that are pathetically low: half a per-
cent, one percent. The Web is a numbers game, they’re told. Get enough traf-
fic and even a mediocre site can pay the rent.
The Web is a numbers game, true. But who says you have to be satisfied with
the numbers? The entire premise of AdWords — in fact, the feature that rock-
eted it past what is now Yahoo Search Marketing within months of its birth —
was the ease with which campaigns could be tested and improved. This
improvement doesn’t have to stop at the AdWords border with your Web site.
You can deploy the market intelligence you gain by testing keywords and ad
copy to create compelling landing pages that continue to attract and guide
your best prospects.
The goal of each landing page is to build an instant emotional bond with your
prospects, show them you understand their needs and can take away their
pains. From that platform, you present your offer and guide them to take
action. Your home page, the one that says, “Welcome to Acme Online Sock
Emporium,” is hardly ever the right place to take AdWords traffic. If someone
walked into your retail Sock Emporium and told you, “I’m looking for red-and-
white-striped, over-the-calf dress socks,” you wouldn’t take them back to the
front door and say, “Welcome to Acme Sock Emporium, for the finest in men’s
and ladies’ dress and casual socks, sporting socks, and never-washed vintage
baseball stirrup socks worn by members of the 1958 Championship New York
Yankees.” Instead, you’ll lead them directly to the wall displaying the red-and-
white-striped, over-the-calf dress socks and ask them, “What size?” That level
of specificity is the purpose of your landing page.
218
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Your retail sock store is probably not located next to other sock stores. But
your online store’s landing page is precisely two clicks away from just about
every other online sock store in existence. If your landing page doesn’t look
like the next point on the shortest distance between your prospect’s A and B,
whoosh! Barbara from Oregon is here one second, Oregon the next. (Hah!
Chapter 10 and my first pun. My sister owes me a dollar.)
Achieving relevance based on keywords
As I discuss in Chapter 5, keywords are the keys to your search visitors’
desires. You bundle similar desires into ad groups, and send the traffic from
each ad group to a landing page focused on that desire. Everything true
about ad copy is also true about Web-site copy; the message, the tone, the
balance of features and benefits, the next call to action all must connect with
the conversation already going on in your prospect’s mind. The only differ-
ence is, on the Web site you are free from the space constraints and most of
the editorial shackles imposed by Google. With great power comes great
responsibility, as Peter Parker, another famous Webmaster, learned the hard
way in the Spider-Man comics. Use the power of your Web site to focus not on
your business, but on your customer’s desires as suggested by their key-
words and the ad that triggered their visit.
If your traffic is derived from AdSense, you don’t have a specific keyword to
build on. Instead, you know which ad interrupted them like a talking white
rabbit and caused them to detour into the rabbit hole of your site. In that
case, your landing page should continue the conversation begun by the ad.
For example, if you sell computer training videos on DVD, part of your AdWords
account and landing pages might look like the example shown in Table 10-1.

Product-focused landing pages
If you sell physical products, like home office telephone systems or paper
shredders or runners’ watches with GPS, your landing page presents the
most specific product you can offer, based on keyword and ad. The keyword
runners watch takes visitors to your entire display of runners’ watches.
Casio runners watch produces a page dedicated to that brand (or, if you
don’t carry Casio, make it a turn-the-corner page that explains why your
watches are superior to Casio’s). And a search for Casio GPR-100 should
take them to a page devoted to that particular watch.
Concept-focused landing pages
Many online stores do not sell a wide variety of merchandise. Instead, they
sell one or two items that solve a certain range of problems. For example,
maybe you’ve invented a clever filing system that automatically purges old
files, or reminds people when to pay the energy bill, or sends flowers and
chocolate to key people on Valentine’s Day. You probably will generate most
220
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

of your traffic not from searches for the solution (since people don’t yet
know it exists), but from descriptions of the problem:
paper clutter
messy filing system
messy office
Or they search for the one aspect of a potential solution that resonates with
them at that moment:
bill pay reminder system
self-purging files
holiday and birthday reminders
Each of the six keywords listed previously should go to a specific landing
page that addresses that problem or need. The final destination will be the
same for all buyers, but the paths they take from problem to solution will
depend on where they’re starting.
Turn-the-corner landing pages
Sometimes the thing you’re selling is related only tangentially to what your
prospect is looking for at first. The entire field of consultative sales is based
on the premise that your prospects don’t really know what they need, and
your value as a salesperson is to help them discover “the need behind the
need” and help them solve their problem at the most fundamental level. For
example, many visitors to www.leadsintogold.com searched for ways to
improve their cold-calling performance. The Web site doesn’t offer any sug-
gestions or tools for cold calling, except to stop doing it. The job of my land-
ing page is to get my visitor to turn the corner from “I’ve got to learn how to
make better cold calls” to “Cold-calling is a flawed strategy, and here’s a strat-
egy that will work much better.”
Using PHP to increase relevance
Through the magic of a programming language called PHP, which either
stands for Personal Home Page or PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (thrilling fans
of recursiveness everywhere), you can increase the relevance of your landing
page based on your visitor’s keyword, geographic location, type of computer,
and several other factors.
PHP marketing consultant Rob Goyette of www.vaelos.com has been quoted
as saying, in a phrase borrowed from Napoleon Hill, “Anything the mind 
can conceive, PHP can achieve.” Following are some of Rob’s favorite uses of
PHP on landing pages. You may be able to use dynamic keyword insertion
(described in the next section) on your own, but the rest of the applications
require considerable PHP expertise combined with marketing savvy. As they
say in the car ads, “Professional driver on closed course. Do not try this at
221
Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site

home.” Meaning, of course, that the following sections describe what’s pos-
sible with PHP, but you will need to be or work with an experienced Web site
programmer to achieve those results. I can’t go into detail about program-
ming Web sites, because I don’t know squat about it — I mean, it’s beyond
the scope of this book.
Dynamic keyword insertion
Chapter 6 shows how you can include the exact keyword in your ad through
a technique called dynamic keyword insertion. You can configure your land-
ing page to perform the same trick. For example, if your visitor surfed over to
your site on the keyword messy office, you can insert that phrase any-
where you like in your headline, your page text, your call to action. You’ll
need to configure the destination URL for each keyword individually; then
add PHP code where you want the keyword to appear on the landing page.
If your Web site consists of .html files (rather than .php), you will need to
enable PHP in your .htaccess file. If you don’t know what this means, ask
your Webmaster or Web site host.
Magically changing the landing page based on keywords
The first Harry Potter book featured a cool gizmo called the Mirror of Erised.
Each person who looked into the mirror saw an image of what their heart
desired most. An advanced PHP application turns your landing pages into
Mirrors of Erised based on keywords. This function allows you to create one
single landing page that changes itself like a magic mirror. You save a lot of
time by not having to create new pages for each keyword. A site selling col-
lege sports clothing and gear could create PHP code that would show Duke
basketball shirts and sweatshirts to visitors who arrived with Duke and bas-
ketball in their keyword, and similarly create a UNC page for UNC fans.
Likewise, baseball, lacrosse, basketball, Missouri, Gators, and
Princeton would all trigger the dynamic creation of other pages, specifi-
cally mirroring the desires suggested by the keywords. The program would
also serve a default page for keywords not in its database.
Split-testing with cookies
Split-testing, which I cover in Chapter 13, is one of the most powerful tools at
your disposal. You can use cookies (tiny snippets of code that identify an
individual computer as having visited before — like having your hand
stamped at a carnival, except each stamp has your name and address on it)
along with PHP to discover which of two different landing pages is doing a
better job of converting visitors into leads and sales. You can test headlines,
bullets, offers, guarantees, frequently asked questions, placement of forms
and buttons and links, as well as colors, fonts, inclusion or exclusion of video
or audio, or just about anything else. Done correctly, you don’t have to worry
about your visitors seeing multiple versions of the same page. When a visitor
222
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

returns to your page, the cookie your site placed on his or her computer will
tell your Web server to show the first version the visitor saw (provided the
visitor is using the same computer).
Survey to report/sales letter
Ask your customers what they’re looking for before showing them content.
Insert their answers into your page, or show them different content based on
their answers. If you sell a diet plan, you can show different sales letters to
vegetarians and meat eaters, people who travel a lot and people who don’t,
and people with diabetes or wheat allergies or berry phobias. If your site
asks visitors to opt-in (see Chapter 11) in exchange for a free ebook or report,
PHP can customize those as well.
Based on location
When you surf the Web, the sites you visit know a lot about you, including
where your ISP is located. You could program your landing page to show
Duke basketball tank tops to visitors from Hawaii and fleece hooded sweat-
shirts to visitors from Wisconsin. You can display local phone numbers and
store locations, and even translate your site into different languages based on
the physical location of your visitor.
Based on operating system
You can show different pages to Windows, Mac, and Linux users, a valuable
feature if you sell software. Instead of prompting your visitor with too many
choices, simply provide the download link appropriate to the visitor’s operat-
ing system.
Scraping the Internet
You can triangulate your visitor’s geographical location with other informa-
tion you can find and scrape from the Internet, such as the local weather and
traffic reports. I could program www.fitfam.com to greet you with, “Hey, it’s
noon your time, and it’s sunny and warm today. Here’s a great exercise you
can do in your back yard that will only take five minutes.”
Visit www.vaelos.com/coolphp for simulated examples of each of these
PHP applications. You’ll be amazed when you visit that page, when you dis-
cover what a Web site can tell about you without you telling them anything.
Scratching your customer’s itch
Showing a “That’s for Me” page will keep your visitor on your site for 30 sec-
onds rather than 8. Your next task is to scratch their itch by fulfilling the
promise of your ad.
223
Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site

Giving them what they want
If your prospects know exactly what they want, then give it to them. Are they
ready to buy an Olympus DM-20? Put a photo, a price, a shipping policy, and
a Buy Now button right on the landing page. Are they looking for more infor-
mation to help them decide what to do next? Give them the information. Do
they need to talk to a real human being? Put a phone number on your site
and hire someone to answer it 24/7, or during business hours, or whenever
your customers call.
Agitating the problem
I don’t want to get too disgusting here (actually, I don’t mind, but my editor
does), but I have to point out something important about this itch metaphor.
Scratching an itch feels good for a while, but actually makes the itch worse.
Sometimes you can scratch so hard that it turns red and swollen and bleeds.
Sometimes in the sales process you have to agitate the problem and make
your prospect feel even worse before they will take action.
If you sell a product that prevents rather than cures, you must be willing to
paint the awful picture of what happens when the preventable event — hard
drive crash, flood, heart disease, death without a will, yellow teeth, whatever
— occurs. Scratching the itch in a case like that means taking advantage of
your visitors’ momentary spasm of responsibility and making them quake
with fear at the prospect of not addressing the issue this very minute, and
trembling with relief at having found you.
Guiding them with a headline
Each page on your Web site is about something. The headline — a prominent
phrase or sentence near the top of the page — helps your visitor decide
whether to spend time on a page by summarizing the content, promising a
benefit, or tickling curiosity. Imagine a newspaper without headlines, just arti-
cles. How would you decide what to read and what to skip? The headline is a
relevance shortcut that also primes the reader for the message to follow.
Establishing credibility
In his popular book Blink: The Power of Thinking without Thinking, (published
by Little, Brown and Company), Malcolm Gladwell shows how we make snap
judgments about most things before we’ve even thought about them. The
neural pathways that establish an emotional reaction are pre-thought. Before
your prospect has read a word, identified the subject of a photograph, or lis-
tened to a word of audio, they’ve already decided whether they like you and
trust you. They’ll never be able to tell you why they feel the way they do,
because those decisions are outside of consciousness. They’ll come up with
justifications for their gut reactions, but are usually clueless as to the real
causes.
224
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Overall look and feel
Visitors will react instinctively to the design of your landing page. They will
assume things about you based on logos, colors, shapes, border styles, text
fonts and sizes, and movement. Different markets respond to different gestalts.
If you’re selling a “secret” of some sort, don’t put up a standard corporate Web
site. If you want to appear like an established company, spend some money on
elegant design elements rather than putting up an ugly sales letter. If you offer
bereavement counseling, use a subdued color palette. If you sell violent video
games, consider light text on a black background. And so on.
The Web site www.probasketballreferee.com tested two landing 
pages, identical in every respect except for the border and the header. 
(See Figure 10-1.) The second page, lacking the graphic elements, received
twice as many opt-ins as the first.
Photographs can enhance credibility, especially in a medium comprised
entirely of electrons. Show visitors your face, your store, your warehouse,
your products. Asepco, a firm that manufactures valves for the pharmaceuti-
cal industry, put a photo slide show on its site that documented the odyssey
of one of its valves from the mountain where the ore was mined to the fin-
ished product. It changes location frequently, so check www.askhowie.
com/valve for the updated Web address.
Basically, you want to subliminally get across the message that “this trust-
worthy business will be around tomorrow.” To achieve this, visit successful
competitors’ sites, talk to graphic designers, and test different designs just as
the Pro Basketball Referee site did.
Specific visual cues
In addition to the overall look and feel, you can add specific graphical ele-
ments that lend credibility by association, as shown in Figure 10-2. These
include credit card logos, PayPal, credit card processors like VeriSign; ship-
pers’ logos (such as those of UPS, FedEx, and the Postal Service); as well as
Web-site certifications such as the Better Business Bureau’s BBB Online
Reliability Program, Hacker Safe, and Trust-e.
Another type of visual reassurance is the presence of subliminal “I Am Not a
Crook” links, including privacy policy, Web site terms and conditions, ship-
ping and refund policies, disclaimers, and so on. I’m not sure anyone actually
reads these documents, but their very presence can be reassuring.
Finally, the more contact options you include, the less you look like a fly-by-
night with something to hide. Post office boxes don’t cut it; instead, get a real
mailing address that gives the impression of an office. Give a phone number.
Put your e-mail address where people can find it.

When you display your e-mail address on your Web site, put it in an image file
rather than a live link. This will prevent spambots from harvesting it and
sending you hundreds of unwanted e-mails every day.
Defining the Most Desirable Action 
for the Landing Page
Before creating your landing pages, as well as every page on your site, ask
yourself the big question: What’s the one thing I want my visitor to do as a
result of visiting this page? The actions that are possible include reading,
watching, and listening; clicking a link, completing a form, making or request-
ing a phone call, or engaging in live chat.
Most clients I’ve worked with can identify a “point of no return” for their cus-
tomers; a place in the sales cycle that, once reached, typically leads to a sale.
For example:
 “Once they request the free DVD, 90% of them become customers.”
 “Once I get them to call, I sell 75% of them right there on the phone.”
 “After they request a quote, almost all of them sign up for the service.”

227
Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site

If you’ve got a step in your sales process that converts lookers to buyers,
then everything about your landing page should be engineered to get as
many visitors to that step as possible. And in most cases, the first step on the
way to the point of no return is getting your visitor’s e-mail address.
“Bribing” your visitor to opt in
Sometimes your landing page can go for the sale. In other cases, your
prospect needs more information or more time before taking out a credit
card. In either case, the big goal of your landing page is to make sure your
visitors do not leave your site without giving you a way of contacting them in
the future. If that way also includes a financial transaction, so much the
better. But it’s often more profitable to aim for a second date than to propose
marriage on the first date.
Business on the Internet is a multi-step process — a series of small, safe,
mutual commitments that allow your prospect to begin to trust you — and
allow you to qualify the prospect. This process is the business equivalent of
dating. Your job is to get on your prospects’ wavelength so quickly and com-
pletely that they regard you as their “one and only.” Remember, the page
after your landing page is three clicks away from your competitor, using the
Back button. The deeper they go, the more of a psychological commitment
they’re making to you.
An opt-in, in Internet marketing parlance, refers to a visitor who has given you
an e-mail address, at the very least, before leaving your site. Essentially, an
opt-in is permission to call them for a date. In the old days of the Internet
(pre-2001), all you had to do was offer a free newsletter to get opt-ins. These
days, with everyone protecting their e-mail inboxes from mountains of spam,
visitors hesitate to sign up for anything. The last thing they need is more
e-mail from someone else trying to sell them something, even if you’re not
peddling fake Rolexes and enlarged body parts.
In order to get their e-mail address and permission to follow up, you need to
demonstrate value and promise future value. www.leadsintogold.com
contains a long letter about cold calling and its alternatives, which many
people have told me is eye-opening in its own right. In several places on the
home page, I offer visitors a chance to download two free chapters of Leads
into Gold, so they can sample the product before making a buying decision
(as shown in Figure 10-3). The request for the opt-in makes sense, since I
need their e-mail address to send them the free chapters. It is natural, not
forced, so it works well. Note that I also ask for their names, which gives me
the ability to address my follow-up e-mails to them personally (“Dear Ralph
Lauren”).
228
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Perry Marshall’s successful opt-in page at www.perrysmarshall.com offers
an e-mail course, “5 Days to Success with Google AdWords.” Perry includes
two additional items in his opt-in form: phone number and toughest AdWords
challenge. These optional fields can provide Perry with valuable information.
If he or his staff take the time to call even 2% of his leads, he’ll gain insights
into their situations and their desires at the moment they arrive at his site.
And the Biggest Challenge field tells him exactly what to offer on his site, in
his prospects’ own words. Perry calls this “reading them a page from their
own diary.”
The folks at www.novamind.com sell mind-mapping software. The top goal of
their Web site is to entice visitors to download the free 30-day trial version of
the product. Because they know that visitors who try the software typically
buy the software, they don’t even require an e-mail address.
If you can afford to spend real money on leads, you can collect snail mail
addresses by offering a physical packet: a CD, DVD, book, report, 5-day
supply of wrinkle cream, and such. E-mail is very cheap at the moment, but
not very stable. A physical mailing address is not subject to spam filters or
the whims of unreliable servers and switches. Also, the avalanche of spam
e-mail that floods most people’s inboxes daily makes it hard for your legiti-
mate sales messages to get the attention they deserve. The motto for e-mail
could be, “When you absolutely, positively don’t really care if the message
ever gets through.”
Figure 10-3:

229
Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site

Getting permission to continue the relationship is such a fundamental goal
that I’ve devoted all of Chapter 11 to the opt-in and e-mail follow-up.
Engaging visitors in real time
The opt-in allows you to follow up with your visitors by e-mail, in what online
geeks refer to as an asynchronous fashion. This fancy word (asynchronous,
not fashion) means there is a gap between when the message is created and
when it is received. This book is an extreme example of asynchronous com-
munication, as I’m writing it long before you will read it (unless you believe,
based on my prescience and wisdom, that I am actually a time traveler from
the year 2036 who came back to the first decade of the 21st century and
couldn’t land a better gig than this book).
This form of communication fits well with the pie-in-the-sky dream of the
Internet as a business medium where you never have to deal with customers:
You just create a Web site, write a bunch of e-mails that get sent out automati-
cally, and check your inbox for incoming orders. That strategy can work, to a
degree, but everyone I’ve worked with has found that adding real-time live
engagement to their Web site boosts sales significantly.
The telephone is a much-underused online marketing tool. Get a toll-free
phone number, place it prominently on your Web site next to the calling
hours (“24 hours a day, 7 days a week” is a good policy), and offer them a
reason to call. Figure 10-4 graces the top of the www.european-wall-
tapestries.com home page, while Figure 10-5 appears at the top right of
the www.myweddingfavors.com site.

Ari Galper, proprietor of www.unlockthegame.com, wants to engage his visi-
tors either on the phone or in a medium known as live chat. You can see from
Figure 10-6 that the blue-bordered chat invitation, with a photo of Sharon
announcing, “I’m Online,” is the most prominent element on his Web site.
When a visitor enters a question and clicks the Chat with Sharon button, a
window opens in which Sharon and the visitor can type back and forth in real
time, like AOL, Yahoo, or Skype chat services.
The visitor sees the chat box only, but the online merchant using live chat
technology can see in real time all the visitors to the Web site, and what each
visitor is doing and has done on the site. Live chat is the equivalent of a shop-
keeper sitting in an invisible perch in the store, watching how all the cus-
tomers are browsing, navigating, and buying.
Ari cautions against using live chat to go for the hard sell. Instead, chat with
your visitors to find out their questions, their objections, and their goals. If a
question comes up repeatedly, you know your Web site isn’t doing a sufficient
job in answering that question. You can improve your conversion rates by
adding more useful and relevant information to your site. And even though
you’re not focused on making more sales in the chat, a consultative approach
usually works better than a half nelson, especially in an online environment
where your visitor has all the power. They can click you out of their lives in a
second, and there’s nothing you can do about it.

Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site

The www.unlockthegame.com chat box includes a second feature, known
as Click to Call. When your visitors enter their phone numbers and click Call
Now, the live-chat service uses the Internet to connect their phones to yours
(one at a time, of course). Both phones ring, and you can be talking within
seconds. Ari reports that many visitors who are reluctant to pick up the
phone and dial his number will enter their own number and click. Somehow,
he surmises, clicking is perceived as less risky than dialing.
If you are a one-person shop and wonder how you will ever get anything done
if you have to field customer phone calls and chats all day, fear not. You can
turn off the live-chat feature at any time and your visitors will simply see a
box where they can ask a question and hear back from you later. And you can
hire and train people for live-chat customer service just as you can for the
telephone. But even if you can afford only a half hour a week to engage with
customers, you should do it. The insights you’ll gain into your market can’t
be gotten any other way.
The live-chat feature has been transformative for many of my clients, but the
technology is not a cure-all. Just sticking a chat box on your Web site without
understanding — and honoring — the principles of consultative sales will do
more harm than good. Ari has posted a helpful article on the subject on my
Web site; go to www.askhowie/chatwise to learn more about the strategy
and philosophy, recommended live-chat vendors, and where to find out-
sourced customer service staff trained in live chat.
Selling the Most Desirable Action
Once you’ve defined your sales process, your next big question is, “What
stands between customers and the next step?” If you want them to download
your free report, what do they need to be feeling and thinking in order to go
ahead and do it? If you want them to call, what might cause them to hesitate
and then bail? If you’re asking for the sale, what action-freezing second
thoughts might they be entertaining?
In the sales world, it’s a cliché that you have to work as hard to sell a $10
item as a $10 million item. On the Internet, you have to work just about as
hard to give something away for free. Your landing pages must answer your
prospects’ questions, reassure their doubts, assuage their fears, and guide
them clearly to what they should do next.
I have an entire library filled with books and manuals dedicated to the cre-
ation of effective sales copy. The masters of persuasive copy know a lot of
tricks and techniques, but the basis for their effectiveness is a deep knowl-
edge of what their prospects want to have and want to avoid. As you can read
in Chapter 4, marketing tricks without having your finger on the pulse of a
substantial market is like doing a technically perfect triple gainer into an
232
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

empty swimming pool. So the following copywriting tasks can be accom-
plished effectively only against the backdrop of market insight.
Using bullets
Sales bullets are the foundation for all effective sales copy, whether they
appear in actual bullet form on the page or not. Ken McCarthy, my copywrit-
ing teacher, gave me a very useful phrase to focus on whenever I sit down to
write sales copy: “Bullets Wound.” (Wound here rhymes with swooned.) In
other words, the purpose of the bullet is to highlight and stretch the gap in
your visitor’s mind between their current and ideal situations. The cure for
the bullet is the next action you want them to take: read, click, download,
call, chat, buy, whatever. Figure 10-7 shows some of Ken’s bullets from a Web
page describing the curriculum of the System Seminar.
Translating features into benefits
As sellers, we become intimately acquainted with the facts of our products
and services. It glows in the dark; it comes in extra-large; it has a self-cleaning
button; it’s made from shea butter; and so on. After a while, we are in danger
of operating under the illusion that our prospects understand why these fea-
tures are important and beneficial. They don’t have a clue, and if we fail to
Figure 10-7:

curiosity,

promises,
and bring
facts to life.
233
Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site

translate features into benefits, then we are asking our prospects to do inter-
pretive work they have no interest in doing.
Here’s a quick formula for figuring out whether a particular statement is a fea-
ture or a benefit. Write down the statement. Look at it. Ask yourself whether
your most impolite and brash customer could conceivably read it and snarl,
“So what?” If so, you’ve got yourself a feature, not a benefit.
To turn a feature into a benefit, write down the feature, add the words “ . . . and
what this means to you is . . .” and then complete the sentence. Ken McCarthy
thinks of this as “bringing the facts to life.” For example, one of my clients,
poly-D, is a company that manufactures a metered dispensing system (MDS)
for household, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications. Isn’t that exciting?
Actually, the technology is exciting — and by the time you read this, I expect
that you’ll have at least one MDS-containing product in your home. But call-
ing the feature a “metered dispensing system” asks the prospect — for exam-
ple, brand managers in charge of cleaning products, toiletries, and food and
beverage lines — to do way too much work.
The first pass at turning a feature into a benefit often creates not a true bene-
fit, but a clearer feature set. For example, the MDS uses a button-operated
vacuum pump to dispense the liquid, gel, or ointment it contains.
It’s the job of the product marketer to bring each of these features to life. The
fact that MDS dispenses product via a button-operated vacuum pump means
the product
 Can be dispensed one-handed
 Gives a consistent dose
 Eliminates leaks and spills
 Gets 98% of the liquid, gel, or ointment out of the package
Each of those features is now ready to turn into a benefit:
 One-handed dispensing: Tired parents can hold a sick, thrashing tod-
dler in one arm and pour the medicine into a cup with the other.
 Consistent dose: The tired parents don’t have to worry about finding a
measuring spoon or misreading the dosing directions.
 No leaks or spills: The tired parents don’t end up with cough syrup run-
ning down their pajama tops or oozing between their toes into the shag
carpet.
 98% product evacuation: The tired parents don’t have to hold the cough
syrup upside down for five minutes, waiting for the final drips to exit the
bottle. No waste — they get to use what they’ve paid for.
234
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

The sales material we created for poly-D brings the features of the MDS to life
for the brand managers, as well as for the end user. We didn’t assume the brand
managers would be able to translate the experience of a tired parent with a sick
kid into a benefit relevant to them, so we did it for them. In the white paper
available at www.poly-d.com we explained that the MDS instantly gave their
existing products a new and dramatically different marketing story. We helped
them see how effective their advertising campaigns would be, with a real con-
sumer benefit to tout. Make sure your benefits relate directly to what you know
or believe your prospects want. Your goal is to help your prospects visualize
the movie of their future, a future made rosy by the action they’re about to take.
Provoking curiosity
If the next action involves education of your prospects, you have to whet
their appetites for the information you have and they don’t. Bullets that pro-
voke curiosity include teasers (“The most dangerous seat on an airplane —
page 5”), hidden information (“Best-kept secret in the travel industry”),
promise of valuable knowledge (“How to spot slot machines that pay off most
often”), warnings (“Surprise! Choosing the wrong private school for your
child can cost you a bundle in tax breaks”), and questions (“Would you know
how to keep your ticket safe if you won the lottery?”).
Useful But Incomplete: If I wanted you to go to www.askhowie.com/copy
and view all the bullets in Ken McCarthy’s sales letter, I would tease you with
a partial list in Figure 10-7 and imply that the really good stuff is just behind
the curtain.
Including third-party testimonials
For several reasons, third-party testimonials can sell more powerfully than
you can. They can pull off this bit of magic because they are
 Believable: Your visitors have (unfortunately) been taught many times
that salespeople will lie through their teeth to make a sale. Until you
prove otherwise, you’re presumed to be in that category. Your cus-
tomers who say nice things about you don’t have anything to gain by
lying. On the contrary, they’re risking their own “credibility capital” by
going out on a limb and endorsing you.
 Polite: Grandma said that it’s impolite to brag. If you can get your satis-
fied customers to do it for you, you can look bashfully pleased instead of
boastful — while still getting your message across.
 Benefit-based: Testimonials are already formulated to highlight benefits,
since they are created by customers rather than yourself.
You can deploy four testimonial media on your landing page: video, audio,
written text, and contact for more information. Video can be extremely effec-
tive if done well, but tends to be expensive, time-consuming, and a pain for
235
Chapter 10: Giving Your Customer a Soft Landing on Your Web Site

your customers to give you. Ken McCarthy uses video testimonials effectively
at the www.thesystemseminar.org sales page. Because all his customers
were in one place — his seminar — it was cost-effective to hire a video crew
and collect the testimonials.
Audio testimonials can be almost as powerful, and are much less expensive
and time-consuming to produce. You can collect audio testimonials just by
asking your customers to pick up a telephone and talk. Try it now: Call (214)
615-6505, extension 6900 and say something nice about this book. I may post
your comment at www.askhowie.com/readercomments. You’ll have to pay
long-distance charges (because I’m a cheapskate), but you can set up a toll-
free audio line for just a few dollars a month. Visit www.askhowie.com/
audio for recommended services and advanced testimonial-gathering strate-
gies. You can listen to audio testimonial examples at www.leadsintogold.
com near the bottom of the page.
Written testimonials by themselves are the least powerful, simply because
you might have written them yourself. But adding the written text below an
audio or video, you can have the best of both worlds: believability and multi-
ple modes of message delivery.
Finally, you can let your visitors know you have “references available upon
request.” This can work for big purchases later in the sales cycle; on the land-
ing page, focus on delivering needed information immediately.
Giving clear instructions 
in the call to action
Somebody once said, “A confused mind always says ‘no.’” In fact, if you’re
reading this book out loud, you just said it. Make sure your instructions for
the action you want visitors to take are so clear and free of ambiguity that a
reasonably intelligent hamster could follow them.
Not only will you explain exactly how to fill out the form, where the form is
located, and what to click, but you will also tell them what happens next.
What page will be served after they click “Send me the two free chapters!”?
What will appear in their inboxes; in what time frame? Do they need to add
you to their spam filters’ white lists? If they phone you, who will answer?
What extension should they ask for?
Tony Robbins likes to say that humans have a simultaneous need for certainty
and excitement — a balance between what is known and what is unknown. At
the point where someone is considering entering into a relationship with your
Web site, your job is to reduce the already-considerable uncertainty.

I
ndulge me for a moment and try this experiment. Think about the Web
sites you browsed yesterday (or the most recent day you were online).
Roughly how many were there? What were they? Take a minute and write
down as many as you can remember. When you’re done, open your Web
browser and view your browsing history. How many sites did you forget?
How many of those sites are you likely ever to visit again?
The point of this experiment: If you’re anything like me, you visited a lot of
sites, found some of them interesting, but got distracted and left without
leaving yourself a convenient and reliable way back. Your Web site visitors
are the same. You work like crazy to build a great AdWords campaign, pay
real money for visitors, and most of them vanish like dust in the wind (to
quote one of my favorite folk-rock songs of the 1970s).
You haven’t bored your Web site’s visitors, or offended them, or disqualified
them. They just weren’t ready to transact business with you at that moment.
Or they got distracted by a phone call, incoming e-mail sound, fax, co-worker,
daydream, flashback, or UFO sighting. What a shame, too. You spend so
much time, money, and energy to get them into a sales funnel that turns out
to operate more like a sieve.
In this chapter, I’ll show you some strategies and tools for following up with
prospects after they leave your Web site. You’ll discover easy methods for
deploying effective follow-up sequences that you create once and put on
autopilot. You’ll see how to use e-mail autoresponders and newsletters to
become your prospect’s one and only. And you’ll be able to integrate tele-
phone and mail strategies as well to keep your business on the radar screen.

Overcoming Your Prospects’ Miniscule
Online Attention Span
Your average Web-site visitor has the attention span of a guppy — deal with
it. Online attention spans are notoriously short, but merchants have known
for a long time that a sale delayed is generally a sale lost. The infomercial
must get a couch potato to the phone, credit card in hand, before the thumb
touches the TV remote. The direct mail subscription pitch must compel
action before the reader puts the letter down to grab a cold drink from the
kitchen, because soon that letter will be in a middle of a pile, instead of at the
top. And the salesperson at the car dealership wants the prospect to commit
today, before comparison shopping a better deal in the next county.
Pressure tactics don’t work online
The traditional sales approach to any sort of buyer hesitation and reluctance
has been to wrestle prospects to the ground, lock them into a half nelson (full
nelsons prevent them from signing the credit-card slip), and shove a vacuum
cleaner hose into their pocket or purse and suck out the money. In the offline
world, this translates into pressure tactics, fake scarcity, fake urgency, aggres-
sively overcoming objections, and various sleazy tricks. Salespeople are
taught that “I’ll think about it” means “No, and you can kiss your commission
goodbye.”
That attitude is crazy. Sure, prospects lie to avoid conflict and to keep from
hurting our feelings. But sometimes prospects are telling the truth when they
say they need to think it over. If they are forced into a decision before they’re
ready, the decision will almost certainly be no. If the high-pressure tactics
work, the buyer’s remorse refund rate will be astronomical. And those cus-
tomers will not be likely sources of referral business, because they want to
protect their friends from unpleasant experiences.
I could debate the relative effectiveness of these tactics in the face-to-face
world, but it’s clear that they don’t work so well on the Internet. Don’t like a
Web site? It’s gone at the click of a button, no hard feelings. Give yourself a
reality check about online manners and inhibitions by visiting a Yahoo! chat
group some time. Perfectly mild-mannered folks who wouldn’t dream of so
much as coughing if someone cut in front of them in the supermarket line
turn into raving lunatics online, slinging mud and brimstone safe in the shel-
ter of their anonymity. Trust me: The second your visitor is annoyed by your
site, he or she disappears faster than Roadrunner in a cloud of smoke. (Insert
your own sound effects.)
238
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Build a relationship so you can make the
sale when your prospect is ready to buy
Your mission, should you choose to run a successful online venture, 
is fourfold:
 Get your prospects’ contact information. You want their e-mail at the
very least, more if you can get it. The more you ask for, the fewer
prospects will convert to leads (I define a lead as someone you can
follow up with), and the more serious they will be.
 Receive their explicit permission to stay in touch. People don’t always
realize that you will be using their contact information to contact them,
probably because it occurs so rarely in the offline world. Prospects are
used to dropping their business cards into a fishbowl for a chance to
win dinner for four, or giving the supermarket all their contact informa-
tion in exchange for a loyalty card, and never hearing a peep after that. If
you assume that an e-mail address represents an open invitation to visit
their inbox, you’ll be rudely awakened faster than they can hit the
Report Spam button in their e-mail program. Enough spam complaints
and your Web site is basically out of business.
 Provide such helpful and credible advice, guidance, and support that
your visitors never ever go searching on that topic again. Perry
Marshall refers to this as “taking your prospect off the market.” When
prospects are actively searching for information, they go wide, looking
at a lot of sites and getting the lay of the land. They don’t want to
become the world expert; they’re just looking for someone to trust, to
hold their hand and lead them. Your follow-up will determine if you
become that trusted resource or not.
 Build a relationship that leads naturally to a win-win outcome.
Database marketing consultant Lori Feldman (www.thedatabasediva.
com) reminds us, “The purpose of a business is to grow a customer.” Not
just to get the sale. A sale is a one-time transaction. A customer is a
living, breathing asset. The relationship you build with leads may lead to
sales, referrals of their friends, testimonials, and more. But the goal of
the relationship is not to close the deal, but to determine if a sale is a
win-win outcome or not. The most expensive customers in your data-
base are the ones you shouldn’t be selling to. They take up too much
time, demand too much special help, and don’t buy anything else 
from you.
239
Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

Spinning a Web with an Opt-In
In Chapter 10, I identify the opt-in as one of the top goals of any landing page.
An opt-in refers to a prospect who has opted into your database with the
expectation of receiving follow-up communications from you. Depending on
the market, the quality of traffic to your landing page, your offer, and how
you describe that offer, you can aim for an opt-in rate from 20–50%, some-
times higher. If your opt-in rate is lower than 20%, you’re doing something
wrong. This chapter will help you fix your opt-in process.
Unlike a spider who spins a web to ensnare — and subsequently eat — its
prey, you spin a customer-catching Web site to ensure a second date with
your prospects. The opt-in takes all the pressure off the first visit. They can
buy if they like, but, hey, no big deal if they don’t. If your Web site has to
make the sale on the first visit, your prose is likely to come across as desper-
ate. And desperate is not attractive; not at junior high school dances, and not
in sales. The more desperate you seem, the more it looks like there’s some-
thing wrong with you.
The most common method of acquiring an opt-in is through a form on your
Web site. Figure 11-1 shows an understated form, one that I use on www.
fitfam.com/home to get visitors to download my Action Guide, “How to
Raise Fit and Healthy Kids in a Crazy-Busy World.” Opt-in forms can also be
bold and attention-getting, as in www.loweryourbidprice.com, which
shows an offer for a free eight-part mini-course called, “How to Lower Your
AdWords Bid Prices.” The graphics suggest a coupon, and the hand-scrawled
ellipse highlights the action button.
Whatever e-mail service you use to send e-mails and manage your list will
help you generate the HTML code or Javascript that puts the form on your
Web site. Later in this chapter, I show you the vendor I use and recommend a
few others for comparison.

Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

If you thought you could do e-mail marketing using Outlook Express or Yahoo
Mail, you were mistaken. If you have more than 20 leads in your database,
you will need a specialized application to get the e-mails out, manage your
list in accordance with anti-spam rules, and keep your sanity.
Generating an opt-in form using AWeber
For the purposes of this chapter, I’m going to use my preferred vendor, AWeber
Communications, to show you how to set up and manage e-mail follow-up. If
you already have a shopping cart with e-mail capabilities, you will have to
adapt the instructions accordingly. If you don’t yet have an e-mail-marketing
provider, sign up for an account at www.aweber.com. (For a video tutorial and
overview of the e-mail marketing process, visit www.askhowie.com/email
first.) Currently, AWeber costs $19.95 per month, or $14.95 a month if you buy a
year in advance. Just to put this cost in perspective, you can now send unlim-
ited e-mails to up to 10,000 people at a time, as many times as you want. If you
give $15 to the U.S. Postal Service, you can buy 36 first-class stamps and still
have 24 cents left over for envelopes and paper.
Before you build the opt-in form, you need a place to send your visitor once
they’ve completed the form. This page should confirm the success of their
opt-in (“Thank you for signing up for the Nose Hair Removal Secrets 42-Day
E-mail Course”), describe what they’ll be receiving next and where and when
to look for it (“Check your e-mail inbox in about 5 minutes for Installment 1:
Don’t Use a Butane Lighter While Waiting at a Gas Station”), and suggest a next
action (“While you’re waiting, let me tell you about an amazing new way to
remove nasal hair without tweezers, dry ice, or gas flames . . . “). Don’t worry
about getting it perfect — for our purposes right now, all you need is a work-
ing URL to send your lead. Name the page something like www.yoursite.
com/signupthanks.html and remember the name.
When the thank-you page is done, you’re ready to sign up for an AWeber
account as follows:
1. Go to www.aweber.com and click the Order button at the top.
Choose any plan you like, from one month to a full year — you get 30
days during which you can get a full refund. If you like it, the annual plan
is the best value; e-mail marketing is a long-term tool.
2. After placing your order, you’ll be taken to a page with a link to log in
to the Control Panel. Click that link.
AWeber immediately sends you an e-mail with your login and password.
3. Enter your new login and password, and then click Account at the top
right and change your password to something you’ll remember.
4. Return to the Home page and click the Getting Started — Setup Guide
link.
241
Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

5. Choose Web Form Wizard to create your first opt-in form.
6. On the next page, click the green Create Web Form button in the
center of the page and fill out the form details (see Figure 11-2).
7. In the Form Name text box, enter a name for your form that you’ll
remember later.
Only you see the form name, so don’t worry about being clever. Just
describe it so you can find it later among the many forms you will create.
8. Select the type of form you’re using.
The form type can be in-line (that is, within the Web page itself), or a
pop-up, pop-under, or pop-over/hover. Google won’t let you use pop-ups,
exit pops or pop-unders on a landing page, and they really annoy people,
so forget about those options. The pop-over/hover isn’t actually a pop-
up; instead, it’s a graphic that’s technically part of your Web page even
though it appears to float above it. Google has mixed feelings about this;
sometimes it disables your ads if they point to pages with pop-overs,
and sometimes it doesn’t. Stick with an in-line form for now.
9. Enter a URL that you created for your “Thank you for opting in” page
in the Thank You Page text box.
The page must exist already, or else AWeber gets persnickety. If you
don’t have a thank you page ready, either enter your home page for now,
or leave the AWeber default page. Just don’t forget to come back and
change it later. I talk about strategies for this page later in this chapter.
10. As the instructions say, leave the Forward Variables check box blank
if you don’t know what it means.
Later on you can use this feature to customize the thank you page, just
as you can do with PHP on the landing page (see Chapter 10).
11. (Optional) Enable ad tracking by entering some unique description for
this form in the Ad Tracking text box.
You can use ad tracking to segment your list based on the particular
form your lead used to opt in. This ability to segment comes in handy,
say, if each ad group leads to a different landing page. You can name the
traffic source or the page in the Ad Tracking field so you can find all the
leads who were interested in red wagons as opposed to green tricycles.
If you place a form more than once on the same page (at the top of the
right sidebar and below the landing page text, for example), you can
even track which form collected the opt-in.
12. Leave the Start on Message drop-down list at the default for now:
(Default) 1 Autoresponse.
An autoresponse is an automatic e-mail that your leads get from you. The
default setting means they will receive all the autoresponse e-mails in
the sequence, starting with the first one.

13. Click Next to design the form:
The instructions for this part are pretty straightforward on the AWeber
site:
a. If you hover your mouse pointer over the Name field on the left,
you see a plus sign. Click it to add that field to your form.
b. Just below the Name field, you can click the Add New Field link to
add more fields if you want to collect a visitor’s address, phone
number, pet’s name, favorite flavor of Vice Cream, annual income,
innie or outie belly button, and so on.
c. When you add a new field, you see a check box labeled Subscriber
Update. Check this box if you want your lead to be able to change
this information later.
d. You can change the order of the fields by clicking and dragging
them up or down. Edit a field by holding your mouse over it and
clicking the pencil icon. Four options appear to the left:
Required: Does your prospect have to fill out this field to opt in, or
is it optional?
Type of Field: In addition to plain text, you can include drop-down
lists and radio buttons for multiple choice questions, check boxes
for yes/no, and a larger text area to give the prospect the visual
cue that they can write a short novel here.
Figure 11-2:

243
Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

Label and Default Value: The Label text box is used in conjunction
with the Default Value field (see the following) to segment your list
later. For example, if you put this form on your Juggling Scarves for
Kids page, you can include a hidden field called Product and make
the default value Jr. Juggling Scarves. Later, you can search for this
value and send a scarf coupon to people on your list who opted in
from this page and haven’t yet bought the scarves (see Figure 11-3).
14. (Optional) Click the Submit button at the bottom of the form to
rename it.
I generally give the button a title that sounds like my prospect making a
request: “Send Me the Action Guide!”
15. When you’re done editing the form, click the Save button (bottom
right), and you’re ready to get the code for your opt-in page.
Placing the form on your Web site
After you create your Web form on the AWeber site, you need to get the code
that you’ll place in your opt-in Web page. In the AWeber List Settings tab,
select Web Form from the submenu. If you’ve created your first form, you will
see it in the list. Click Preview to see what the form looks like all by itself. If
Figure 11-3:

your list.
244
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

everything is in the right order and you’re ready to stick it on a page in your
site, close the pop-up window and select Get HTML.
AWeber gives you a new window with two code options. The top one, shown
in Figure 11-4, is in Javascript, and consists of a single line of code that you
place on your page’s HTML where you want the form to appear. The script
goes to AWeber’s Web site and pulls the form onto your page. As long as you
don’t need to change the look and feel of the form, this is a good option. It
allows you to collect statistics on how many times the form was displayed,
which you need to determine your opt-in rate.
If you want more control over the design of the form, select and copy the raw
HTML code from the lower box. Your Web designer can use this code to make
the opt-in form blend in with the rest of your page. You can see an example of
a designed AWeber opt-in form, visit www.poly-d.com and click through to
the White Paper offer.
Visit www.askhowie.com/forms to see examples of both codes.
Generating opt-ins via e-mail
You can also generate opt-ins via e-mail. For example, if you send a blank
e-mail to askhowie@aweber.com, within about a minute you’ll get an e-mail
with the subject line, “RESPONSE REQUIRED: Confirm your request for infor-
mation from askhowie” or something like that. When you click the first link
within that e-mail, you’ll be added to my list and will start receiving my e-mail
messages. (See the following section for a discussion of this double opt-in
process.)

Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

Importing and adding leads yourself
AWeber and most other e-mail marketing services allow you to import exist-
ing lists and add new leads manually as well. The better services — the ones
you want to use — will send all these prospects a RESPONSE REQUIRED type
of e-mail to make sure they want to receive your messages. It’s a pain, but if
your service doesn’t require this, I predict that a lot of your e-mail messages
will not make it through the spam filters. It’s counterintuitive, but I won’t use
a service that doesn’t make me verify my imported lists.
You and I are honest and ethical, of course, and would never send out thou-
sands of spam messages to people who don’t want them. But if the e-mail 
service I use allows other people to do just that, the spam filters will catch 
my e-mails as well as those of the spammers, because they are all being sent
from the same server. Using a lax e-mail service is like putting the return
address Seedytown on your envelopes. Don’t risk it.
How to “Bribe” Your Prospects to Opt In
The mechanics of the opt-in are straightforward: Place a form on your site,
tell people to fill it out, send them to a thank-you page, and start e-mailing.
The only thing missing is the answer to your prospect’s question, “Why on
earth should I give you my name and contact information?” People protect
their inboxes like geese protecting their nests. The last thing they want is a
bunch of annoying e-mails trying to sell them something. The keys to achiev-
ing a high opt-in rate are to
 Give away something of value.
 Make the opt-in in a logical next step in the relationship rather than a
form of online extortion.
 Offer your visitors something they really want.
 Reassure them.
Give away something of value
When I was little, my dad used to take me to Sonny Amster’s bakery on
Vauxhall Road in Millburn on Sunday mornings to get rolls and bagels for
brunch. My most vivid memories of those trips were the hundreds of free
cookies I consumed. Mr. Amster understood the power of giving away a free
sample before asking for the sale. He knew that if he could give away some-
thing of value before asking for the sale, he was likely to ring up a bigger
order than if he insisted on payment before the munching began.
246
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Not only did my dad sometimes add a dozen cookies to our order, he felt
compelled to buy as an act of reciprocity. As Robert Cialdini explains in his
book, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (published by Collins), when
someone does something nice for us, we feel a powerful urge to balance the
scales by doing something nice in return. This principle is often used to
manipulate us, but works even better when it’s genuine.
You can give away something of value as a prequel to the opt-in. If you sell
unicycles and generate traffic with a Unicycle Beginners ad group, give away
a free guide on the seven steps to learning to ride. Put Steps 1 and 2 right on
the landing page, and offer the remaining five steps in an e-mail. Make the
first half of an article about choosing your first unicycle available on your
site, and ask for an e-mail address to send them the second half. Put a video
on your site showing the first step, and offer a series of how-to-ride videos in
exchange for the opt-in.
Make the opt-in a logical next step
To grasp the concept of a logical next step, return with me to the metaphor of
the museum where people go to find the love of their life. You’re standing next
to an attractive person whom you’d like to know better, looking at the post-
modern painting of a 12-foot-high piece of lined notebook paper. The person
glances in your direction, smiles, and says something like, “I wonder what
music the artist was listening to while she was painting this.” You say, “I’ll tell
you what I think if you give me your e-mail address.” End of conversation, no?
The request for their e-mail address had nothing to do with the prior conver-
sation. On your Web site, your opt-in will not work if it’s just a thinly veiled
attempt to build your list.
If you need inspiration, consider the tech-support hotline model. Have you
ever waited on hold for 20 minutes for tech support, listening to cheesy
music or endless repetitions of “Your call is important to us, and we will
answer your call in the order it was received”? And then you get a live
person, start explaining the problem, and 30 seconds later you hear a click
and a busy signal? After years of this treatment, I finally got a technician who
began the call by asking for my phone number and e-mail address “in case we
get disconnected.” Boy, I was never so happy to give away my information
before. I had been given a logical reason to share that information, so I did.
Why do you need your visitors’ e-mail addresses? What are you going to send
them via e-mail? Why do they want it? If you ask for a phone number, how will
they benefit from your call? Spell it out: “Leave your phone number if you’d
like to talk about which perennials will thrive in your garden.”

Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

I asked Seth Godin (www.sethgodin.com), author of the very important
book, Permission Marketing: Turning Strangers into Friends and Friends into
Customers (Simon & Schuster), his thoughts about trying to compel your visi-
tors to opt in because you’re trying to build your list. Seth didn’t beat around
the bush:
What you want is irrelevant. Of course, it matters what you want if you have
power, if you can force people to do what you want. The reality is that the
new paradigm demands humility. You will either engage people on their
terms or you will fail to engage them. Your choice.
Offer your visitors something 
they really want
Every marketing campaign consists of three factors:
 The market: In the case of your AdWords landing page, the market is ini-
tially determined by the keyword and then funneled through your ad.
 The creative: This is everything you show your market to get them to
accept your offer — text, graphics, audio, video, and so on.
 The offer: This is the bait, the thing they really want.
Marketers like to spend a lot of time massaging the creative part, because it’s
fun and because it’s the part over which they have the most control. But the
success of your campaigns will depend (95% of it, anyway) on one thing: how
well the offer matches the market. In other words, is this bait something they
want or not?
In dating, someone gives you their phone number for one reason only: they’re
hoping you give them a call some time. Your job is to become so appealing
that your prospects actually want to hear from you again. They look forward
to your e-mails. They get value (and perhaps entertainment) from every point
of contact.
You already know what your AdWords traffic wants, because they told you by
clicking your ad. You can use the ad to split-test features of your offer (free
report, e-mail course, PDF delivered by e-mail, fax, small lead-lined box flown
to your door by 72 carrier pigeons, whatever). See Chapter 13 for the details
of split testing, and read the later section, “Creating a lead-generating
magnet,” for a discussion of types of things you can offer in exchange for
your visitors’ contact information.
248
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Reassure them
Basically, human beings are motivated by three things: seeking pleasure,
avoiding pain, and conserving energy. Of the three, pain avoidance is usually
the strongest. Most of the time we’re just acting out of damage control,
asking ourselves, “What’s the worst that can happen here and how can I pre-
vent it?” At the threshold of opting in, our prospects want to be reassured
that we won’t spam them; that they can stop the flow of e-mails easily at any
time; and that we’ll respect their privacy and not sell, rent, barter, or give
away their contact information to anyone else.
Legendary copywriter Gary Bencivenga puts the following sentence below
his www.bencivengabullets.com opt-in form: “No obligation . . . Nothing
to buy . . . Your e-mail address will never be shared or rented.” Ken McCarthy
offers this reassurance at www.thesystemseminar.org form: “I respect
your privacy and will not share your e-mail address with anyone. You can
easily unsubscribe at any time — Ken McCarthy.”
To sell or get the opt-in?
When I present the opt-in strategy to clients, they sometimes object on the
grounds that the opt-in strategy will get in the way of the main objective of
the site: the sale. They understand the sales funnel, and worry that a side-
ways step will upset the process and destroy sales.
A sale is a fragile thing, and you can certainly sabotage your sales by creating
a clumsy opt-in process. And you’ll get fewer initial sales if you go for the opt-
in first, rather than the sale. But if your sales conversion of a new visitor is
0.5% (meaning 1 out of every 200 visitors buys from you) and your opt-in per-
centage is 20% (meaning 1 out of five visitors opts-in to your list), you will
almost certainly make more sales from ongoing follow-up than from the one-
shot approach.
If your prospect wants to buy right now, don’t put an opt-in in their way.
Online sales include all the information you could ask for, including the lovely
credit card number and expiration date. Consider the sale a super opt-in.
Make sure your thank-you page offers a path back to the sales funnel, rather
than a dead end.
The thank-you page
Perry Marshall uses two clever techniques on his thank-you pages to keep
the sales process going while the prospect is still hot. You can see his 
thank-you page by opting in to his five-day AdWords e-mail course at www.
249
Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

perrysmarshall.com. Even though the first autoresponse e-mail actually
hits your inbox within 30 seconds of clicking Start Your Mini-Course Now,
Perry tells you to check your inbox “in about 10 minutes.”
The second technique in use on this page is the dynamic redirect. The page
tells the visitor, “In a few seconds I’m going to tell you about the latest tools
for making the most of Google . . . .” And the page is coded to send you
straight to a sales letter about 15 seconds after it first appears.
Here’s the code, which you place between the <HEAD> and </HEAD> tags in
the page’s HTML code:
<meta HTTP-EQUIV=”REFRESH” content=”0; url=http://
www.yourdomain.com/nextpage.html”>
Replace the two elements in bold. Instead of 0, put in the number of seconds
you want this page to show before redirecting. Replace the example URL with
the next page.
The thank-you page is also a great place to explain to your leads what to
expect from you now, and what they have to do to get it. When you download
the two free chapters from Leads into Gold at www.leadsintogold.com,
you’ll be taken to a download page that includes the download link and
instructions on downloading the chapters in PDF format.
It also includes a mini-sales pitch for the autoresponder sequence you just
signed up for (and may not have known about):
Important Note: I’ll be sending you a series of e-mail tips to help you get the
most out of the two free chapters. They have incredibly valuable insights,
and a lot of subscribers think I’m crazy for giving it away for nothing.
I’ve always been a show-off — just ask my sister.
Here’s the thing: Your ISP’s spam filter may consider these e-mails to be
spam, and will prevent you from reading them.
To ensure you receive the e-mails (you can unsubscribe at any time), please
add me to your trusted list of senders. Here’s how . . .
Notice that I put the download link right on the thank-you page. That strategy
raises an interesting question: Do I care if someone can get to that page by
giving me a fake e-mail address? If I put the link in an e-mail, I know that the
e-mail must be real for them to get the two free chapters. In this case, I want
to get the two free chapters into as many hands as possible, because those
chapters do such a good job of selling the rest of the product. If you follow up
with leads manually, or don’t want your lead-generating magnet available
except to your subscriber list, then don’t put the link on the thank-you page.

Creating a lead-generating magnet
You have many choices about what sort of lead-generating magnet (LGM) to
create. You can offer information, a free sample, a demo version, a limited
time free trial, or a coupon. If your Web site is a catalog store with many
items available for purchase, the LGM can be as simple as an invitation to
receive a 5% discount off the first purchase. Software vendors can offer demo
versions, either time-limited or with features disabled.
If you sell high-margin consumables — such as skin care products, health 
supplements, and perfumes — you may find a free trial to be a cost-effective
way to build your customer list. Jevene Cosmetics (www.jevene.com), for
example, offers a free sample for $7.95 shipping and handling — presumably
enough to break even on that shipment. It includes an interesting twist, waiv-
ing the shipping and handling fee entirely if the visitor also agrees to receive a
promotional CD-ROM from Video Professor. Now you can remove wrinkles and
manage your QuickBooks at the same time! Weird combo, but I bet it works.
Informational LGMs
The economics of the Internet favors giving away information. After you’ve
created the LGM, digital copies are all free, so you incur no marginal expense
by giving away a million as opposed to a hundred. When your business
includes a healthy back end, you can afford to pay more up front to mail 
letters and packages.
Formats
Informational LGMs can take many formats:
 Free Report/White Paper (PDF)
 Newsletter (PDF, Web page, e-mail)
 Book (self-published)
 Magazine/Journal
 Resource Guide
 Analysis/Planning Template
 Electronic Book
 Recorded Message
 CD/Audiocassette
 DVD/VHS cassette
251
Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

 Restricted Access Website
 Audio/Video download
 E-mail Course
 Live Seminar/Workshop
 “Cheat Sheet”
Content types
There are three basic types of information LGMs that lend themselves very
well to the triple purposes of attracting, building trust, and selling. These are
special reports, consumer guides, and how-to guides.
 Special Report (often called White Paper in the corporate world): The
free report is the tool of choice when your prospect is not yet educated or
motivated enough to take action of any kind. By contrast, the consumer-
awareness guide works better when the prospects know they have a
problem, know they need to solve it, and are looking at you and your
competitors side by side.
The free report essentially names a problem faced by your prospects,
gets them emotionally involved in the horrible current and future conse-
quences of the problem, unveils a generic solution, and then introduces
and sells your version of the solution.
Visit www.askhowie.com/reports for examples of a special report for
consumers (by an indoor air specialist writing to parents of children
with asthma) and a business to business white paper (about maximizing
profits from your customer list).
 Consumer Guide: The consumer guide is most effective when your
prospect is actively shopping for a solution and trying to figure out
which solution to buy. A variation is the Consumer Alert, which warns
prospects about all the ways they can get scammed or make the wrong
decision. A popular format for this is the “Seven questions to ask before
choosing a . . . .” You name your profession, and teach your prospect
how to find a qualified and honest practitioner.
 How-to Guide: The third kind of informational LGM is the how-to guide.
It doesn’t have to refer to your product at all. What it does is teach your
prospects how to solve a problem somewhat related to the problem that
your product solves.
For example, if you sell bookkeeping services for small businesses, your
prospects typically have grown to the point where they are overwhelmed by
the amount of start-up stuff they haven’t outsourced or hired for. Think about
what other problems owners of growing small businesses have: inefficient
purchasing systems, not enough time to market and sell, nagging questions
about incorporation options, and so on. If you can offer information that
solves those problems, you can be pretty sure that the people who raise their
hands in interest are good prospects for you as well.
252
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

If you need to bid on turn-the-corner keywords, create a How-to Guide that
qualifies your prospects and gets them into your funnel, even if it doesn’t
directly sell your products or services. You now have the ability to build the
relationship through the most revolutionary communications medium of the
last 50 years: e-mail.
Staying on Your Prospects’ 
Minds with E-mail
Imagine for a moment that Google changes its policies and bans all your ads.
Imagine further that it changes its search algorithm, thereby excluding your
Web pages from its listings. What would happen to your online business?
Aside from pointing out the foolishness of putting all your business eggs into
one Google basket, the scenario I just described points out the importance of
having a customer list. As Fred Astaire sang to Ginger Rogers on a ferry deck
in Shall We Dance, “They can’t take that away from me.”
As Ken McCarthy says, one goal of your list is to support your business if all
your traffic disappears. The glue that binds your list to you is e-mail. In spite
of all the spam, a person’s e-mail inbox is an intimate space. Think of how
much more upset people get about spam than junk mail to appreciate just
how intimate we want it to be. Writing e-mails that grow the relationship is
one of the most important skills you need to succeed online.
You can send two kinds of e-mail: autoresponses and broadcasts. They serve
different purposes, and can complement each other to create a powerful
e-mail customer-building strategy. Before I cover these methods, I want to
discuss a much-debated topic in e-mail marketing: verified opt-in.
Verifying your lead
Suppose you come to my Web site and sign up for my newsletter. You enter
the name U. Big Dope along with the e-mail address of some person you
don’t much like. What happens next is that your “friend” gets an e-mail from
me addressed to U. Big Dope. You’re anonymous, your acquaintance is
mad at me, and I’m innocently confused by the whole thing. I may end up get-
ting blacklisted by spam filters for enough of these lapses. (This actually hap-
pened to me a couple of years ago, but the actual name was much more
offensive than U. Big Dope. The perpetrator targeted a couple of guys in
his office as recipients of this prank, for which I got blamed. Needless to say,
I’ve tended toward verified opt-in ever since.)
253
Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

AWeber and other e-mail-marketing services have “solved” this problem, sort
of, by creating a higher category of opt-in: verified or double opt-in. In this
system, people who opt in receive one e-mail with a link they can click to
really join the list. Essentially, this step says, “I’m going to make sure you are
who you say you are by sending you this e-mail. If you didn’t request this
information, you don’t have to do anything. Sorry about that.”
Verified opt-in protects you from accusations of spamming. No matter how
often you send out e-mails, some of your leads will wake up one morning with
no recollection of your existence, find your e-mail in their inbox, and report it
as spam with a single click. If they opted in using verified opt-in, you can
prove to the spam police that you weren’t e-mailing without permission.
Also, verified opt-in gives you a higher quality list. The more hoops people
have to jump through to receive your e-mails, the hungrier they are for your
information.
The one big problem with verified opt-in is that it depresses sign-ups.
Especially if your market acts impulsively, your prospects may have cooled
down in the 10 minutes it took your e-mail to meet their eyes. Instructions on
your landing page and customization of the confirmation e-mail can improve
your conversion rate, but you won’t build as big a list with verified opt-in.
In AWeber, the default for a Web-form signup is unverified. You can change
that setting any time for each list, but once verified, you can never change it
back again. So think about your market, about how likely they are to mess
with you or forget you, and how important it is for your business to have an
easy time delivering e-mails through spam filters. As I said, I got burned once,
and haven’t looked back. All my lists are verified now.
Following up automatically with 
an e-mail autoresponder
The e-mail autoresponder is one of the coolest tools ever invented, right up
there with Pez dispensers and bicycle brakes. You can preload a series of
e-mail messages, and when someone opts in to your list, they receive the
series in order, according to the schedule you set. You can merge fields to
make the e-mail look exactly like a personal correspondence. Done right,
your autoresponder sequence will mimic what you would write to each
prospect if you had all the time in the world. You can schedule e-mails days,
weeks, months and even years in advance. Figure 11-5 shows a very short
autoresponder sequence of four e-mails, scheduled as follows:
Message 1: immediately
Message 2: 3 days later
254
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Message 3: 3 days after message 2
Message 4: 3 days after message 3
But wait, there’s more! You can create multiple lists, and set rules about sub-
scribing and unsubscribing based on certain conditions. For Leads into Gold,
my sequence consists of 18 messages sent over about two months. But what
if someone buys on Day 17? Do I want to keep asking them to buy? Obviously
not. I created a rule that says, “When someone on the list buys Leads into
Gold, remove them from the prospect list and add them to the customer list.”
My customer sequence consists of 12 messages, also spread over about two
months, that give advice, offer support, and tell them about other things they
may want to buy.
I’ll show you how to perform this magic again using AWeber, the service I use
and recommend. You discover how to use the AWeber Control Panel to build
an opt-in form earlier in this chapter. If you haven’t yet signed up for an
AWeber account, go to www.aweber.com and order now. You have 30 days in
which to change your mind and get a full refund.
Changing your list name
From the AWeber home page, click List Settings to change the name of your list
to something relevant to your business. If you use verified opt-in, the list name
will be the main clue your prospects will see as they decide whether to opt-in.

Would you agree to receive e-mails from someone named default389178? If
your ideal name is taken, think of variations — you have 15 characters to play
with. My list names for my Gout e-book include gout-recipes, gout, and
goutbook. For my marketing business, I use list names like adwords, 
adwordscoaching, askhowie, coachmarketing, email-club, 
emailstrategy, guide, and question. I improved my verified opt-in 
percentage when I changed the name of my Leads into Gold prospect list 
from 2freechapters to leadsgold-2free.
Changing to verified opt-in
To change to verified opt-in, follow these steps:
1. From the List Settings tab, click the Verified Opt-in tab in the submenu.
2. Next to Web Form Submissions, click the OFF link to turn on Verified
Opt-in for your Web forms, as shown in Figure 11-6.
3. Say yes to the pop-up warning and you’re in complete compliance
with e-mail-marketing best practices.

Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Next, you need to customize the verification message your prospects will
receive. Your job is to get them to open the e-mail by choosing or creating the
right subject line, and then getting them to click the link that puts them on
your list. Click the Subject box to bring up the Pre-Approved Subject drop-
down list and scan the subjects first. Which one most closely connects with
what you promise? Is it a subscription? A request for information? Do you want
to include a capitalized pre-head like RESPONSE REQUIRED? Do you want to
include or omit the @aWeber e-mail suffix? (Hint: Omit it.)
The advantage of using a pre-approved subject line is, well, they’re pre-
approved. I prefer to write my own custom subject lines, enter the text in the
Custom Subject text box, and wait for the AWeber folks to approve them. One
of my favorites is, “Making sure you signed up on purpose for {!listname}.” That
helps them connect to me while saying exactly why I’m sending this e-mail.
In the Custom First Paragraph text box, simply repeat the offer and tell them
what to do. For example:
Hi {!firstname_fix},
Congratulations on your purchase of Leads into Gold!
To receive the promised bonuses, simply click the
link below.
Save your changes by clicking the Save button at the bottom right, then
review the verification message you’ve edited. When you’re satisfied, click
the Messages tab to start creating your autoresponder sequence.
Planning your e-mail sequence
When Abraham Lincoln was asked how long a man’s legs should be, he
famously retorted, “Long enough to reach the ground.” When I am asked how
long an e-mail sequence should be, I give the same answer and watch my
clients’ heads spin in confusion. Actually, I paraphrase Honest Abe and say,
“Long enough to turn your best prospects into buyers.” It really depends on
the circumstances: the market, the keyword, the offer, the first sale.
Ask yourself: What is your prospects’ interest cycle? How long will they focus
on this itch before losing interest? Some itches go away by themselves after a
few minutes or hours. In those cases, your best strategy is to go for the sale
right away. Other itches can linger for years — soundproofing a noisy restau-
rant, losing 15 pounds, learning to play the ukulele. Your e-mail scheduling
strategy depends on their interest cycle and the urgency of their need.
Your choices for e-mail content are so vast, I could write a book just on e-mail-
autoresponder marketing. (Hey, maybe that will be my next For Dummies
book!) Here are several strategies to choose from as you create your sequence:
257
Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

 Consumption of your LGM: Just because people downloaded your spe-
cial report or software demo doesn’t mean they’re going to read it or
start using it. In fact, thanks to ferret-on-caffeine attention spans, they
probably don’t remember where they saved the file, or that they have
the software. Your first e-mails should help them consume your LGM in
manageable chunks. Reassure them: “If you haven’t gotten to the white
paper yet, I understand. You’ll get to it when you get to it. When you do,
I’d love to hear your thoughts.”
Remind them why they wanted your LGM in the first place. Tell them
about the great strategy on page 9. Show them a cool way to create a
color-coded mind map using your software.
 Soliciting engagement: My most successful autoresponder message of all
time goes out one day after my prospect has opted in. I’ve used this for
my products and for various clients, and it always gets a great response:
Hi Betsy,
Yesterday you visited FitFam.com and downloaded the Action Guide.
(If you haven’t gotten your copy yet, it’s at www.FitFam.com/home/
Actionguide .)
I just wanted to ask you, was it helpful? What were you looking for
when you came to the site? (If you haven’t read it yet, I
totally understand. You’ll get to it when you get to it.)
If you’ll hit reply, I’d love to hear from you. I want to make sure
the information on the site is as helpful as possible.
All the best,
Howie Jacobson, Ph.D.
www.FitFam.com
This chatty e-mail starts a dialog with prospects. They reply out of cour-
tesy, because it looks to them like I sat down and wrote this just to them,
and it would be rude not to reply. I always reply to their reply, thanking
them for their feedback, and asking more questions about their situation.
Before you know it, I’m doing consultative selling with zero sales resis-
tance. I’ll offer to help them over the phone, and very often can take the
prospect to the next step in the sales funnel just by virtue of this e-mail.
 Teaching and guiding: My Leads into Gold e-mail sequence contains
some very long e-mails. Each one is a short chapter on direct marketing.
For people hungry for information on how to grow their business, these
e-mails make me a valuable resource. Some of them reason, “If this is his
free stuff, imagine how good his paid stuff must be.”
 Offering more good stuff: If you have a second white paper, or an audio
interview, or a free teleseminar, you can build goodwill and establish
yourself as the expert by offering them to your prospects. Remember,
258
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

most people start their search wide, looking in lots of places for informa-
tion, but quickly narrow their informational intake filter to let in one pri-
mary source. Your goal is to be that one source.
 Selling: Yes, you can make offers and convince your prospects to take
you up on those offers in e-mail. You’ll be more successful in converting
on those offers if they are the minority of your e-mails, and if the e-mails
that do sell also educate or entertain (preferably both).
The best way to learn about what works is to get on a bunch of lists and
experience various autoresponder sequences. Create folders in your e-mail
program for each sequence, print out the e-mails and study them. What’s the
ratio of valuable content to sales pitch? Is the tone professional, folksy, in-
your-face, or humorous? Are their motives transparent or veiled? Are the
messages short, medium, or long? What’s the purpose of each e-mail? Was it
effective for you? Would it work in your market? And so on.
Go to www.askhowie.com/autoresponders for a list of autoresponders to
study and model.
Pay special attention to the two most important elements on an e-mail: the
Subject line and the From line:
 The From line: Before we read an e-mail, we look to see who sent it. If
your leads know you only as Pat the Welder, they probably won’t open an
e-mail from Patricia McLaughlin. You can change the From address at the
bottom of the Aweber List Settings page. The name next to the checked
From/Reply box is the one your prospects will see in the From line.
 The Subject line: The subject line serves one function: to get the user to
open the e-mail and read it. You can use curiosity triggers, benefit trig-
gers, and any of the strategies discussed in Chapter 6. Your subject line
is the headline of your e-mail, the thing your prospect spends a millisec-
ond scanning before deciding whether to read the message or delete it.
Creating an autoresponder sequence using AWeber
Once you’ve renamed your list and set your verified opt-in preferences
(described earlier in this chapter), you’re ready to create e-mail messages.
Click the Messages tab to see a list of your current messages (none, if you
haven’t created any yet). Click the Add Message button to create your first
autoresponse.
If you are already collecting leads, they will receive your autoresponse
e-mails. If you’re just playing around, create a second list that nobody will 
see but you, as shown in Figure 11-7. You can create new lists by clicking the
small Add New link next to the list name at the top left.
259
Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

Creating a message
For now, my advice is to stick with plain text e-mails, not HTML. Plain text
e-mails get delivered at higher rates, they’re simpler to create, and they
mirror the normal e-mails your prospects send and receive every day. They
won’t necessarily stand out and scream, “You can ignore me because I’m not
from a real person.”
If you select the Click Tracking check box, you’ll be able to see how many 
leads click links within your e-mails, which can be very useful information. 
The downside, if you’re using plain text messages, is that your pretty links
(www.fitfam.com/actionguide, for example) will turn into hideous AWeber
links with lots of funny characters, and may scare people into not clicking.
Type your subject (the default, “Insert Your Subject Here” is not recom-
mended) in the Subject text box, and then type your plain text message or
import it from a text file or Word document into the Plain Text Message box.
AWeber shows you its recommended width of 68 characters per line. If you
click Wrap Long Lines after inputting your message, AWeber will automati-
cally reformat it to that width.
I often make my e-mail messages half that width, or about 35 characters per
line, to make them very easy on the eye and encourage my readers to scroll
all the way to the end. After creating the message, save it (by clicking the
Save button at the bottom right) to return to the message list.

Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Using personalization fields
You can personalize the e-mail message to each lead, using dozens of differ-
ent fields, some of which are shown in Figure 11-8. I generally include the first
name in the salutation, as follows:
Hi {!firstname_fix}
The _fix at the end capitalizes the first letter of the name and makes the
rest lowercase, in case someone typed in his name as HOwie and you don’t
want to show him those two capital letters in every e-mail.
To view the actual e-mail generated by the message in Figure 11-8, visit
www.askhowie.com/personal and complete the form. It’s verified opt-in,
so you’ll have to confirm the first e-mail to receive the second. How close to
your actual city did AWeber get? In my case, within about 270 miles — not
very impressive. Oh well.
Click Test to send yourself a copy of the message. Do this with every e-mail
you ever put into AWeber. Click every link within those e-mails. You’ll save
yourself a lot of “oops” e-mails, the ones where you say, “Gee, I’m sorry that
the links didn’t work in the last e-mail I sent out.” Take the time to get it right,
so you don’t raise unnecessary doubts about your competence.

Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

Scheduling your next message
For all autoresponder messages after the first one, you have to decide when
you want the e-mail to be sent. AWeber allows you to choose any number of
days, from 0 through 999, following the previous message. If you have a
sequence that sends an e-mail a day for 5 days, then once a week for 4 weeks,
and then once every 28 days forever, you configure it as follows:
Message 1: Instantaneous
Message 2: 1 Day Delay
Message 3: 1 Day Delay
Message 4: 1 Day Delay
Message 5: 1 Day Delay
Message 6: 7 Day Delay
Message 7: 7 Day Delay
Message 8: 7 Day Delay
Message 9: 28 Day Delay
Message 10: 28 Day Delay
And so on . . .
Generally, you want to send more frequent e-mails at the beginning of the
sequence, and drop down to a stay-in-touch-once-a-month frequency after a
month or so. The last thing your prospect wants is to go on vacation for a
couple of weeks and return to an inbox full of you. (Actually, an inbox full of
“Send this e-mail to 20 people within 10 minutes or your nose will fall off”
might be worse, but you get the point.)
Scheduling an e-mail is simple: Click the Add Message button at the bottom of
your list of e-mails to create a new one. At the top of the next page, the first
field you can edit has the default number 4 in it. If you leave it as is, this mes-
sage will be sent four days after the previous message. To send this message
the very next day, change it to 1 (see Figure 11-9). If you’re using a different
autoresponder service, make sure you understand their format. Some of them
ask you to schedule based on the signup date, rather than the previous e-mail.
Your autoresponse e-mails fall into one of two categories: obvious parts of a
sequence, or simulated real time e-mails. If you offer an e-mail course, the
messages that deliver the course don’t have to “pretend” to be a note you
just dashed off. Something as simple as

Hi Howie,
Here’s Part 1 of the 17-Part E-mail Course, “How to Clean Your Fingernails”
+ + + + + + + + + + + + +
Part 1: Finding Your Fingernails
Many of my clients have such dirty fingernails, they can’t even find them
anymore. Here’s where to look: at the ends of your fingers, just opposite the
part with the fingerprint . . .
And so on . . .
will get the job done. After the course is over, you can start communicating in
a more chatty and natural way:
Hi Howie,
I was recently talking to a client who complained, “Fran, my fingernails are now
spotless, but my toenails are a mess. What do you suggest?”
Goodness, but I guffawed when I heard that one. Did he think I had another
17-part course about toenails?
The answer, obviously, is “Wear shoes and nobody will notice.”
But then we started talking about the spring wedding season approaching, and it
occurred to me that you might find occasion to don footwear with open toes in
the coming months.
And so on . . .
Try to keep these messages “evergreen” by avoiding references that will date
them. Don’t say, “I was watching the Oscars last night,” because someone on
your list will receive your message in September and dismiss you as a liar or
TiVo addict. Do read over your messages once or twice a year to nip stale-
ness in the bud. If you talk about a celebrity who has died since you wrote
the e-mail, it may come across as offensive, if not just outdated.
The goal of the autoresponder is to automate what you would do anyway if
you had a million hours a day and nothing better to do. As you plan each
message and each sequence, ask yourself, “Knowing what I know about this
lead, what would I write to them today?”
The purpose of your first autoresponder sequence is to turn your lead into a
buyer (or at least to help your lead to decide if they should become a buyer).
Your e-mails continue to hammer at pain points, educate, offer solutions,
build credibility, invite feedback — everything you would do if you were the
account manager and this lead was a hot prospect.

Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

Using autoresponders to move leads and 
customers through your sales funnel
Say you sell three products, and you want your customers to buy them in this
order: Product 1, Product 2, Product 3. You can set up three autoresponders
as follows:
 Prospect List: a sequence of e-mails to get your opt-ins to buy Product 1.
 New Customer List: a sequence of e-mails to get your customers to buy
Product 2.
Here’s the coolest feature of all: when someone buys Product 1, AWeber
automatically adds them to the New Customer list and unsubscribes them
from the Prospect List. You don’t have to subject your customers to a sales
pitch for a product they already bought. You can also avoid the worse-case
scenario of offering a better deal for something they already bought.
 Returning Customer List: a sequence of e-mails to get your customers
who already own Products 1 and 2 to buy Product 3.
Setting up automatic unsubscribe
To set up automatic unsubscribe, follow these steps:
1. Create a second AWeber list by clicking Add New next to the list name
at the top left.

264
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

2. On the next page, click the green Create List button and complete and
save the forms on the Success page.
This new list will be for new customers who just bought your first product.
3. Change the list to your first list by selecting it from the drop-down list
next to Change List, as shown in Figure 11-10.
4. Once you’re managing the list that leads will unsubscribe from when
they subscribe to the new list, go to the List Settings tab and click
Automation from the submenu.
5. From the drop-down list in the center of the page, select Unsubscribe
from List {name of first list} When Lead Subscribes To {name of
second list} (see Figure 11-11).
6. Next, select the new list name from the drop-down list under the List
column.
7. Click the Save button to save the changes and read the Action you’ve
saved, to make sure it’s what you want AWeber to do.
If you have an online shopping cart, you can set it up to forward the cus-
tomer information to AWeber after a sale is made. AWeber will then perform
the automated rule, removing the customer from the prospect list and adding
the name to the customer list. If you don’t yet have an online shopping cart,
go to www.askhowie.com/cart for some recommendations.
Don’t be an accidental spammer
No discussion of e-mail would be complete without a foray into the wacky
world of spam (junk e-mail). I know you get hundreds of them a week, if not
each day, and you’re saying to yourself, “But I would never send out an e-mail
offering a fake Rolex. I don’t even know where to find fake Rolexes.” Or you’re
saying, “I’ve had enough of this chapter. I’m going to put this book down and
try that new Indian restaurant, the one next to the beauty shop and the pizza
place.” (Sorry, I can’t reveal how I do that trick.)

Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

Spam has become such a huge annoyance to e-mail users that many Internet
Service Providers (ISPs) have become hyper-aggressive in their spam filter-
ing. Your e-mails may be going to leads who opted in, they may be completely
appropriate, and your leads may be hungering for them, but the big dumb fil-
ters are programmed to stop everything that doesn’t come from Aunt Sadie
and Uncle Lou.
If AOL or Earthlink incorrectly tags your e-mails as spam, you may find your-
self sending 2000 e-mails and having only 400 get delivered. Spam is a big
topic, but the following tips will help you steer clear of the worst mistakes
made by innocent marketers.
Use plain text instead of HTML
Spammers use HTML to do all sorts of nefarious things in e-mails. A brand of
spamming known as phishing creates e-mails that look exactly like they were
sent by big companies such as financial institutions, or eBay and PayPal.
Their goal is to get unsuspecting customers to click to fake sites that look like
the real ones and enter sensitive data. If your e-mails are in plain text, it
shows you’re not hiding anything. Spam filters like that transparency, and
bother plain text e-mails less.

Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Keep links to a minimum
Avoid putting lots of links in your e-mails. Remember, each e-mail should
compel a single action. Too much choice is bad marketing, regardless of
spam considerations. You can repeat a link at the top and bottom of a long
e-mail, but don’t give your reader half a dozen choices.
Avoid common spam trigger words
Words like free, mortgage, pornography, spam, make money, 
enlargement, and others alert filters that a message may be spam. In 
the past, you could fool a filter with punctuation tricks, such as fr.ee and
m@ke m0ney, but the filters now look at tricks like these as spam markers.
So what do you do if you’re in the mortgage business, or a similar legitimate
enterprise that uses spammy words? One solution is to put your e-mails on
your Web site, and write short e-mails with links:
Hi Bartleby,
Today’s installment of “Affording a New Home” is available at

It talks about the three mistakes that can cost you big time, as well as a time-
saving resource you’ll wish you had discovered years ago.
Enjoy,
Maury Gage Lender
Putting your e-mails online will reduce readership, so you’ll have to work
hard to entice your reader to click the clink and view your message.
Don’t send attachments
If you have a legitimate attachment, like a PDF document or software demo
download, put a link in your e-mail to a Web page where that file can be
downloaded. Files attached to your e-mails can contain viruses. Also, large
attachments can crash your readers’ e-mail servers or just get your messages
hung up in cyber-limbo.

Random e-mail tip
Leave a space after a URL before adding punc-
tuation. Web browsers often include periods
and commas that appear at the end of the URL,
so someone might click your working link and
end up with that nasty “Page Not Found” error.
Wrong: www.askhowie.com.
Right: www.askhowie.com .

For more tips on beating an undeserved spam rap, visit http://www.
askhowie.com/spam . (See that extra space before the period? Just a 
subtle reminder, courtesy of the “Random e-mail tip” sidebar, elsewhere in
this chapter.)
Broadcast e-mails
The other e-mail workhorse for your online business is the Broadcast. This
works just like a combination of regular e-mail (you pick a recipient, type
something, and send it) and the AWeber system (you can merge fields just
like the autoresponses; you can schedule it to go out at a particular date and
time; you can send it to hundreds or thousands of people at once).
To send a broadcast, go to the AWeber site, click the Messages tab, and
choose Broadcast from the submenu. Click the green Create Broadcast
Message button in the center of the page to get started. The first thing you
notice is that this form is exactly the same as the form for creating an auto- 
responder, with only tiny yet crucially important differences:
 Instead of choosing a sending interval, you are prompted to enter a date
and time. The default is right now.
 You can segment this list by creating a view and sending only to those
leads who meet certain criteria (see the “Managing your e-mail list” sec-
tion, later in this chapter for instructions on creating and using views.)
The default views in the drop-down list use time and deliverability as the
two criteria. You can send a broadcast e-mail to all leads who subscribed
within a certain time frame. You can also resend a broadcast to leads
who for some reason haven’t been able to receive your regular e-mails
due to spam filters or other problems.
 Instead of sending the message to just one list, you now can send it to
multiple lists. You can also exclude lists. Just click the Send To Multiple
Lists Or Exclude Lists link to open a table where you can choose the lists
to include or exclude.
I use broadcasts to let my customers know about special events, time-sensitive
information, and to send out newsletters. I also use broadcasts to fill up my
autoresponders while making sure that my newest leads don’t miss anything
good.
Special events
Just today I sent an e-mail to several of my marketing-related lists, letting
them know that the System Seminar tuition will be increasing in two weeks,
and they should act now to save $700. Obviously, I can’t put a message like
that in an autoresponder.

Writing great newsletters
E-newsletter wizard Michael Katz, of www.
bluepenguindevelopment.com, is one
of the few people whose newsletters I read it as
soon as they arrive. Michael teaches profes-
sional service providers like coaches, consult-
ants, trainers, accountants and other people who
sell their expertise to build relationships with
prospects through regular e-mail newsletters.
Here’s Michael on the four commandments of
e-newsletters:
What I’m about to tell you is so valuable, that I
frankly wouldn’t blame you if after reading it,
you felt compelled to take $5.00 out of your
wallet, stuff it in an envelope and send it directly
to me. Here’s why: What I’m going to share with
you now are the four guidelines which we use
to make sure that all the newsletters we’re
involved in stay on track. Here they are:
 Make It Useful:
With a business to business newsletter in
particular, it’s difficult to get any traction
with readers if you don’t give them some
kind of actionable “aha” with every issue
you send. They are barraged with e-mails,
and eager to click the delete button as often
as possible.
Your goal therefore, is to give them pause.
To make them live in fear that if they delete
your newsletter, they will miss some insight
that would have made a significant impact
on their success. Useful information rises
to the top of the pile, and when your news- 
letter is on top, you need not worry about
how big the pile is.
 Make It Interesting:
I don’t know who started the rumor that sig-
nificant and profitable businesses must also
be serious and boring, but it seems to have
caught on nonetheless. That’s good news
for you and me. Because with all the dry as
dust E-Newsletters out there, all trying to
sound like the front page of the Wall Street
Journal, we can make our newsletters
shine with little effort.
Personal anecdotes, conversational lan-
guage and the occasional joke here and
there will keep your readers involved long
enough for them to hear the “real” infor-
mation you’re trying to give them. They
probably won’t read it just because it’s
interesting, but they certainly won’t read it
if it’s not.
 Make It Simple:
An effective newsletter isn’t a doctoral
thesis; it’s not even a case study. It’s what I
like to call, “a nugget.” One insight or tip or
concept that your readers can take in,
understand, and hopefully remember long
enough to put into practice. If you give me
too much information (even if it’s good), I’m
likely to stockpile your newsletters until I
delete them in one, “I’ll never get around to
reading these old ones anyway” frenzy.
Give your readers something small enough
to understand and remember.
 Make It Authentic:
Done right, your E-Newsletter is the voice
of your company. It reflects your unique
personality and culture, whatever that hap-
pens to be.
I’ve walked into enough companies to know
that each of them — even the ones in
seemingly straight laced, hard to differenti-
ate industries — has its own language,
pace, sense of humor and approach. Don’t
hide all that in an effort to sound “profes-
sional.” Marketing is the opposite of fitting
in — do yourself a favor and fit out!
For more of Michael’s wit and wisdom, go to
www.bluepenguindevelopment.com
to read his latest newsletter and join his list. He
might even reveal how to pronounce ezine.

You can use broadcasts for sales, announcements, coupons, news, opportuni-
ties; anything that is time-sensitive and of interest to a significant segment of
your list.
E-newsletters
E-newsletters, also called ezines (which nobody knows how to pronounce),
are regular communications from you to your customer base. You can create
a publishing schedule or just send one out when the mood strikes. The most
successful e-newsletter publishers I know stick to a schedule and never devi-
ate. Because you can schedule a broadcast for a future date, you can create
six newsletters and have AWeber send them out weekly while you drink yak
milk and climb K2.
Repurposing broadcast e-mails to build your autoresponder sequence
Say you’ve created an autoresponder sequence that lasts five months, then
stops. One day you’re driving on the highway and this idea hits you for a
great next e-mail for that sequence. You rush home and type the e-mail into
your autoresponder sequence, 30 days after the last message. Let’s call it the
180th day of the whole series.
Now everyone on that list who hasn’t been on your list for more than 179
days will receive that message. But it’s sad that the people who have been on
your list for more than six months will never see your message. You could
put it in your autoresponder and send it as a broadcast, but then all the new
people will get the same e-mail twice.
The solution, as revealed to me by Perry Marshall during the intermission of a
Blue Man Group performance in Las Vegas, is simple and elegant: Calculate
how many days after subscribing someone will receive the autoresponse
e-mail. Send the e-mail today as a broadcast, and make a note on your calen-
dar to enter it into your autoresponder sequence that many days in the future.
Continuing with our example, let’s say today is March 16. You will add the
message to your autoresponder sequence on day 180. Send the broadcast to
your list today, and on September 16, add the message to day 180 of your
sequence. That way, everyone on your list will receive the message once, and
no one will receive it twice.
Managing your e-mail lists
You can manage your e-mail lists by clicking the Leads tab on the AWeber
site. You can search and sort by any of the data you collect. Click Select Field
in any of the drop-down lists to view your choices. You can select filters and
a sort order and save that view, in case you need to come back to it again.
Once you generate the view (or just click Display View with All Leads show-
ing to see your entire list), you can manage individual leads.
270
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

You can stop the autoresponder sequence for a lead by checking that
person’s box in the Stop column. You can reset the last message they’ve
received to put them backward or forward in the sequence. You can erase
them entirely — when someone complains to me about spam but don’t
unsubscribe via the link that appears at the bottom of every single e-mail I
send them (what, me frustrated and bitter?), I erase them from the list to pre-
vent future problems.
If you click the e-mail address, you can edit more information about your lead
in the pop-over window: name, e-mail, ad tracking, last message delivered,
and a miscellaneous notes field.
As your list grows, you will benefit from tutorials on advanced list manage-
ment techniques. You can find these and other AWeber tutorials at www.
askhowie.com/aweber along with other articles about e-mail marketing.
Going Offline to Build the Relationship
When you start conducting business online, it’s easy to be seduced by the
automation and anonymity of e-mail and Web site. Imagine, a business that
never requires you to talk with customers, lick a stamp, buy an envelope, or
write a check. You could die and keep making money for years!
What many online-only businesspeople don’t realize is they’re sacrificing
growth for convenience, or perhaps laziness. If you collect phone numbers, you
can follow up via the telephone. Ditto for the fax machine, which is making a
comeback as a permission-based follow-up medium that’s considerably less
cluttered than the e-mail inbox. (And faxes are less likely to be blocked than
mass e-mail messages.) The mail, including the postal service as well as private
carriers like FedEx and UPS, is a great way to stay in touch with prospects.
I can’t begin to cover offline follow-up strategies in this book about AdWords.
(Remember AdWords? This is a book about AdWords.) But they are so near
and dear to my heart, I want to share one quick and clever way to use e-mail,
your Web site and the telephone together to grow your business:
1. Choose a time and date for a teleconference call.
2. Go to www.freeconferencecall.com and sign up for a free 96-person
conference call line.
3. E-mail your list to let them know about a teleconference you will be
holding to answer their biggest questions. Include a link to a page on
your Web site where they can take a short survey to register for the call.
4. Look over the survey results and pick the questions you will answer on
the call.
271
Chapter 11: Following Up with Your Prospects

5. Ask a friend or colleague with a nice voice to interview you by asking
you the questions you’ve chosen. If you’re brave, they can also moder-
ate and help you field live questions from teleconference participants.
6. Record the call, using the www.freeconferencecall.com recording
feature (free, but not such great quality), or an audio-recording service
such as www.audioacrobat.com.
7. Download the recording, and either edit it with the free Audacity pro-
gram (available at http://audacity.sourceforge.net) or the
audio editing software of your choice, or post it as an .mp3 file to your
Web site.
8. E-mail your list, letting them know that the teleconference is available
for them to listen to online or download to their PC or iPod.
9. If you’ve said some good stuff, pay a transcription service to turn the
recording into a Word document. (You can find freelance transcription-
ists by posting a project at www.guru.com or any similar freelance 
brokerage site.) Edit it, make it graphically pretty, turn it into a PDF 
document, and put it on your Web site.
10. If you’ve shared some great material that your prospects and customers
want, you can do any or all of the following:
a. Give it away free on your site.
b. Give it away free as an LGM in exchange for an opt-in.
c. Turn it into a CD and/or printed manual and sell it as a product.
d. Use it as a bonus to compel some other desired action.
e. Let other people reproduce the CD and manual and include them
as bonuses with their products.
f. Come up with a brand new use that no one has ever thought of
before.

Building a “Climb the Ladder”
Web Site
In This Chapter
 Understanding the goals of your Web site
 Discovering Web-site tools that turn visitors into buyers
 Using multimedia to get closer to your customers
 Turning your business into a testimonial farm
 Using PHP to personalize your site for returning customers
Your business is just a system for turning complete strangers into great
customers. AdWords finds you the strangers, your ad invites them in,
and your landing page opt-in and e-mail give you the ability to keep the con-
versation going. Your Web site contains the content that will turn leads into
buyers, buyers into repeat customers, and customers into referral sources
and advocates.
One way to look at your Web site is purely numerically: traffic in, money out.
In a nutshell, the game of online marketing can be reduced to that equation.
Your Web site, in this view, is a tool for extracting cash from visitors. You set
up conversion tracking and analytics and reports to find out how good your
Web site is at extracting a purchase from which visitors (see Chapters 14 and
15). You run split tests to increase the amount of money you get per visitor
(see Chapter 13). But when you actually design and build your Web site, sales
and money should be the farthest thing from your mind. Instead, you focus
on growing customers.
The big goal of your Web site is to develop the relationship between you and
your customers. Sales are part of that relationship, and an important part —
after all, you can’t take satisfaction or good will to the bank or the grocery store
or the music store on Broad Street with the gorgeous Weber mandolins — er,
excuse me, where was I?

Oh, yes: the relationship. The typical online business can identify several
stages of customer: first-time buyer, second-time buyer, third-time buyer
(now the customer is a habit, not a fluke), referral source, and advocate. You
may be protesting that your business is different, because you only have one
thing to sell to a customer. That may be true, for now, but the real competi-
tive advantage online is not the best AdWords campaign, or the best Web
graphics, but the best relationship with customers. If your customers are
worth more to you than your AdWords competitors’ customers are worth to
them, you eventually win — and win big.
Your Web site can be a potent partner in farming the seeds of leads into fruit-
bearing customers. (Hey, that last sentence was poetically metaphorical.
Excuse me while I high-five myself.) This chapter shows you how to use vari-
ous tools on your Web site to grow customers, clients, and an enthusiastic
volunteer sales force.
Identifying the Rungs of 
Your Business Ladder
Take a few moments now to sketch the perfect trajectory of a new visitor to
your Web site. What’s the first measurable outcome you desire? An opt-in? 
A sale? To engage you in a chat? To ask a question via a form? To call your
business phone?
Once they’ve taken that step, what’s the next one? If they’ve opted in, it may
be a sale, or a second opt-in to a new list, or attending a teleseminar, or
scheduling a phone call. If they’ve already bought, maybe you have an upsell
they should get. Maybe you want them to send you a testimonial, or to refer
five friends, or to use the product they’ve bought, instead of putting it on a
shelf unopened.
What’s the top rung of your customer ladder? Think of the top 20% of your
current customers — what puts them in that category? If you have customers
who’ve maxed out your business, can you build a new rung at the top so 
they can ascend even higher? A private coaching club? A membership site? 
A chocolate-themed cruise?
Every business is different; take a few minutes now to identify the rungs of
your business before continuing. Once you know where you want to go, it’s
much easier to help them get there. Let’s look at a few rungs that are
common to most businesses:
 The Lead: The bread and butter of the online business is the lead — the
visitor with whom you can communicate even after he or she leaves
your site. In Chapter 11, I cover strategies and tactics for getting visitors
274
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

to opt in to your list. I also share how you can use e-mail to bring them
back to your Web site. E-mail is great, but limited. The e-mail inbox is too
competitive and distracting a space to hold an intimate conversation. It’s
like trying to have a date in a restaurant booth surrounded by comedians,
competitors, fake-Rolex peddlers, and all their friends and family. Also,
spam filters make it hard to say much of anything related to selling. The
wise online marketer uses e-mail to bring leads back to the Web site.
The lead has uttered a soft, tentative “Maybe” in response to your over-
tures. Your job is to make the leads glad for the chance they’ve taken,
and provide value far beyond their expectations. You are aiming for the
three magic verbs: know, like, and trust. When your leads think they
know you, feel warmly toward you, and believe you to be trustworthy,
they will take a chance with a first purchase.
 The First-Time Buyer: The one-time customer has taken a leap of faith.
The “Yes” is followed by “Okay, show me what you’ve got.” Don’t think of
the first sale as closing anything. You customer just opened the door and
invited you into the front hall. The customer hasn’t taken your coat, or
invited you to sit down. Now is the time to prove yourself.
 The Second-Time Buyer: The second sale shows that you’ve passed the
first customer test. Your product or service did what you said it would,
or more, and you haven’t alienated the person with poor customer serv- 
ice. Your job now is to take your prospects off the market entirely, so
they will never consider patronizing a competitor’s business. They must
feel that you are their protector, watching out for their best interests
and more concerned for their needs than your own.
 The Third-Time Buyer: The third-time buyer has established a trend
and a habit. These buyers have committed part of their own self-esteem
to proving themselves right, and will continue to buy from you as long as
you don’t ignore or mistreat them. Your goal is to get them to the point
where they feel comfortable telling their friends about you.
 The Referrer: Visitors to your Web site who have been referred by
someone they trust is completely different from search engine or pay-
per-click traffic. They come with positive expectations and an optimistic
filter, and will doubt and argue less than a complete stranger. When your
customers take the time and effort to send others to you, you have a
business than can survive just about any change in Google’s algorithm.
There’s just one more rung to take them to. . . .
 The Loyal Advocate: Is there a business in your town that you feel so
good about, you would be angry if a competitor opened up? Those feel-
ings are what you want to inspire in your customers. You want them act
as your advocates, your advisors, your eyes and ears around the market- 
place. You want them to post comments and questions to your blog, to
agree to be recorded and filmed for testimonials, and to shout to the
world that you run a great business.

Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site

Using Web Tools to Help Your 
Visitors up the Ladder
Let’s simplify human behavior for a moment. Peter Bregman (www.bregman
partners.com), author of A Short Guide to Leading a Big Change, points out
that people take action when three things are true:
1. They know what to do (knowledge)
2. They can do it (capability)
3. They want to do it (motivation)
This chapter focuses mostly on the third element, motivation. How to get
people to know, like, and trust you; to show them that the action you want
them to take will help them avoid pain and gain pleasure; and that it’s the
easiest and quickest and cheapest way for them to get there. But the first two
points are just as important. If your Web site is poorly designed, it doesn’t
matter how magnetic or persuasive you are. You can’t convince someone to
click a Buy button they can’t find.
Design
The design of your Web site will either guide your visitors toward rungs of
your ladder or make those rungs invisible or inaccessible. I’ve seen too many
Web pages that look like they were designed to prevent sales: tiny fonts, dis-
tracting graphics, gratuitous Flash animation (as Lemony Snickett would say,
“‘Gratuitous’ here means ‘your Web designer spent a lot of time and money
learning how to use that animation software and by golly, they’re going to use
it every chance they get’”), navigation systems determined by a template
rather than what will get the visitor’s attention, and shopping carts that
require more clicks than a Wheel of Fortune booth in Point Pleasant Beach.
Is your navigation self-evident? If visitors wanted to buy kettlebells (big hunks
of iron with handles used by hardcore fitness fiends), could they figure out
how to find them from your home page? Do you use graphics and borders to
shine a light on the most-looked-for links on your pages? Or do they have to
drill through pages like Shop and Weights and Free Weights and
Miscellaneous to find your Kettlebell selection?
I often coach online entrepreneurs who show me Web sites where the most
important links are buried in long navigation bars or hidden below the scroll
bar. When I tell them that I can’t find how to get to the page for restaurant
owners, they say things like, “It’s in the submenu on the left. Just click Most
Popular Pages and you’ll see it.”
276
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

As Mike Psenka of Universal Data (www.universaldata.net) points out, if
you have to train your visitors to use your site, the navigation isn’t, to use a
software-design buzzword, self-evident. For Mike, self-evident isn’t nearly
strong enough a term. He strives to create software and reporting that is, in
his words, “User Ridiculously Obvious.” Take a look at your Web site with
new eyes: Is it User Ridiculously Obvious?
The next time you’re surfing and searching, pay attention to sites that seem
easy and obvious to use. Notice where they place their buttons and links, and
what they call them. Avoid the mystery buttons with icons and no names.
Keep your design clean and functional — use everything you need, but no
more. Look at the difference between the home pages of American Airlines
(Figure 12-1) and JetBlue (Figure 12-2). The Continental page is busy, with lots
of links, multiple offers, and several competing graphics. The big graphic at
the top is animated, and keeps changing as you try to figure out where to go
to conduct your business.
JetBlue’s home page is simple and sparse, with few colors and a big obvious
form for the number-one action on this page: booking a flight. The headline,
“Free TV with purchase,” next to a graphic of the video monitor in the back of
an airplane seat, emphasizes the JetBlue difference: 36 TV channels on every
flight.
Figure 12-1:
American
Airlines’

is clut-
tered and
confusing.
277
Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site

When you start clicking into the site, the differences become even more
apparent. Clicking American’s Reservations navigation button brings down a
long sub-menu with a huge array of options. (Figure 12-3). By contrast, when
you click Where From to start booking your flight on the JetBlue site, a beau-
tifully designed list of departure cities appears above the page, as shown in
Figure 12-4. User-friendly? User Ridiculously Obvious.

And if you’re not convinced of the power of simplicity, perhaps you haven’t
seen this page: www.google.com. Google got to be the 900-pound gorilla of
search partly by making it so easy to conduct a search. No competing graphics
or links — just a plain box in the center of a nearly empty page. Other search
engines competing with Google in the late 1990s were trying to cram every
pixel on their home page with juicy content. Google won by not intimidating or
confusing its users, as well as by delivering quick and relevant content.
Sales copy
Sales copy refers to the words you use to convince your visitor to take some
action. You sell opt-ins, you sell free downloads, you sell phone calls, and of
course you sell products and services.
Even in the dawning multimedia era of the Web, words matter. Your sales
copy is what ultimately persuades visitors to take actions. We’re creatures of
inertia and hesitation when it comes to doing business. We don’t want to get
burned (again). We don’t want to make big mistakes that will be cumbersome
and costly to undo (again). As you write, focus on two elements: proof of per-
formance and risk reduction. I will buy from you, assuming I want the big ben-
efit you’re promising, if I believe it will work for me and if I’m not taking a risk.
Figure 12-4:

menus are

Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site

Proof can come in many forms. If you can demonstrate effectiveness, that’s
the best. Think of the vacuum-cleaner salesperson who shows that the
vacuum can suck up a bowling ball — hard to argue with that! Online, many
products defy demonstration, although video is expanding the horizon. The
next best thing is to get testimonials and endorsements from real customers,
describing in their own words what your product or service has done for
them.
How long your sales copy should be has been the subject of a long (and
utterly pointless) debate in marketing circles for decades. It should be exactly
long enough to get the job done, and not one word longer. The comprehen-
siveness of your sales pitch depends on the price of the product (more expen-
sive items generally require more substantiation), the severity of the need
(the ER doctor doesn’t need to give a long speech about why it would be good
to staunch the flow of blood from the patient’s aorta), and your visitor’s famili- 
arity with the product or the producer (I could probably sell J.K. Rowling’s
next book in five words — “Buy J.K. Rowling’s New Book” — but it would take
me considerably longer to convince you to buy my new Yiddish-style
magic/fantasy novel, Chaim Mendel and the Enchanted Phylacteries of
Thomashevsky).
Think about the length of your sales copy this way: How long would you talk
on a live sales call if your prospect was interested? Would you say 25 words
and then shut up? Don’t underestimate your prospect’s capacity for interest
in solving a problem or attaining a goal.
Articles
Not every word on your Web site needs to convince. You build credibility,
trust, and reciprocity by sharing your expertise. Remember, your sales copy
is only as good as your reputation. Well-written and helpful articles establish
your reputation as someone who knows what’s good, and who seeks to be
helpful.
Articles support the sales process not only by building your credibility. You
can write articles that build the need for what you’re selling. For example, if I
sell meditation CDs for parents and kids, I could include articles about medi-
tation: health effects, methods, instructions, stories about transformation
brought about by meditation, and so on. If I sell special dichromatic green
light bulbs for use during meditation, I can include articles about the healing
properties of green light.
Articles can also dispel confusion and help your visitors take action. If you
sell four brands of flat-screen TV, your visitor may become overwhelmed at
all those choices — and do nothing. You can write reviews that compare the
brands and models, and help visitors decide which one is right for them.

Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Blog
A Weblog, or blog, is a way of publishing Web content without requiring any
design or coding skills. If you can write an e-mail, you can publish a blog. The
way blogs have evolved, with bloggers linking to each other and carrying on
hyperlinked discussions and arguments back and forth, lend themselves to
platforms for expertise.
From its origins as a communications outpost for the hopelessly techie and
its phase as a self-absorbed tell-all medium for high school kids, blogging has
evolved into a powerful business tool. To be a credible blogger, you not only
have to know your stuff, but have your pulse on the rest of your market.
You’ll discuss industry trends, amplify or argue points made by other blogs
and Web sites in your industry, and act like a key opinion leader in your
space.
Another feature of blogs is reader interactivity. Your visitors can add com-
ments and questions, engaging in a conversation with you and each other. It’s
your blog; you benefit from being the host of the party.
Dave Taylor of www.intuitive.com teaches clients to blog for business
purposes. Go to www.askhowie.com/blogrules to find his article on the 7
Don’ts of Business Blogging.
Your keywords’ quality scores can benefit from an active blog on your site.
Google spent much of 2006 and 2007 raising the relevance requirements of
AdWords listings. You can improve the relevance of your landing page if it
links to dozens or hundreds of other relevant pages. Google schedules its
inspections of your site according to how often it thinks you update the site.
An active blog, including comments by visitors, induces Google to visit more
frequently. The more your site changes, the more up-to-date and relevant
Google assumes it to be.
Live chat
I introduce live chat in Chapter 10, as part of a landing-page strategy. Live
chat can live on every page of your Web site, so your visitors can ask ques-
tions whenever they feel confused or overwhelmed, or are close to a buying
decision. E-mail responses take too long. Phone calls are too scary. Chat com-
bines the instantaneous nature of the phone with the safety (and relative
anonymity) of e-mail.
Chat as an engagement tool
You can include chat boxes wherever they will be the most beneficial on your
site. Some good places to include a chat box are
281
Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site

 On sales letter pages: If it’s a long letter, place chat buttons alongside or
within the page in several places, so the reader doesn’t have to scroll
back up to the top to engage you.
 On your order pages: Chat boxes can prevent cart abandonment by
allowing your visitors to voice final objections and get reassurance
before placing the order.
 On articles pages: You or your staff can answer questions and demon-
strate your knowledge and concern.
With some chat software, you don’t have to wait for visitors to initiate the
chat. You can invite visitors to chat; the invitation appears on-screen as a
pop-up they can accept or decline.
Effective chats aren’t aimless conversations, as the word chat may mistakenly
imply. Ari Galper of www.unlockthegame.com recommends making them
closed-loop conversations. Here’s his flow, in a nutshell:
1. Introduction
2. Find out their situation
3. Reassure them that their problem can be solved
4. Wrap-up — recommend your solution
Ari teaches specific phrases that interrupt gently, generate trust, and create a
space for discovery and problem-solving rather than heavy-duty selling. I’ve
posted an in-depth interview with Ari on using live chat to improve Web site
conversion on my Web site. Go to www.askhowie.com/chatwise to listen
online, or to download the interview to your computer or MP3 player.
Chat as a tool for improving your Web site
When a visitor asks a question about your Web site, they are telling you where
your site is missing the boat. Ari told me that one of his recurrent questions
for a particular product was, “Does it comes with a guarantee?” After telling a
number of visitors where they could read about the guarantee, he realized
that the fact of the repeated question meant it wasn’t obvious enough. He
made the guarantee stand out more by changing its background color and
border, the questions went away, and his conversation rate went up.
You can also use the chat interface to “spy” on your visitors as they browse
your site. Figure 12-5 shows the interface for Ari’s www.unlockthegame.com
Web site provided by live-chat provider Live Person (www.liveperson.com).
The top window shows a dozen current visitors, sorted by length of time on
the site. The highlighted visitor’s browsing history appears in the lower
window. Additional tabs below the bottom window show you each visitor’s
282
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

chat history, as well as information about geographical location, operating
system, and Web browser. A recent release of Live Person includes informa-
tion about which AdWords campaign, ad group, and keyword brought the visi-
tor to your site. You can even see what’s on the visitor’s computer screen by
selecting the Page Viewer.
The capability to watch your visitors’ browsing behavior can be enlightening.
Imagine a shopkeeper who couldn’t see the aisles in the store, and never real-
ized that an applesauce spill in Aisle 7 was preventing the sale of canned
fruits and fruit juices. The path each visitor takes on your Web site tells you
something about how you’re guiding them, intentionally or not.
You can find gaps in your Web site by first asking the question, “What’s the
perfect path?” If a visitor came to your landing page, opted in, and then fol-
lowed your Web site in a logical way to the next sale, what would that look
like?
When you start observing the actual behavior of your visitors — how they
jump around from page to page, refresh pages, go back to your home page,
leave completely, and so on — you can identify the obstacles and poor sign-  
age that’s confusing or alienating your visitors. When you identify a page
that’s breaking the flow, you can fix it.

Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site

Audio
The biggest drawback to the Internet as a business medium is its impersonal
nature. Since people can’t look each other in the eye and shake hands, trust
will always be a big hurdle in developing business relationships online.
Psychologists tell us that most human communication is nonverbal — body
language and tone of voice. The sound of your voice on your Web site can go
a long way toward making you more real and trustworthy.
You can easily spend thousands of dollars on Web-audio equipment, and in
some cases the investment can be well worth it. But if you just want to see if
the additional of a human voice can improve your conversion, start with a
tool you already own and know how to use: the telephone.
Audio Acrobat offers a service for $20 a month that allows you to create
audio files for your Web site by talking into a telephone or recording them on
your computer. You can easily embed the files in your Web site or send them
via e-mail. Visit www.askhowie.com/audio for a demonstration of the serv- 
ice, as well as a video tutorial that shows how to get audio onto your Web
site within minutes.
Four ways to spice up your Web site with audio include these:
 Welcome messages and guidance: Robert Middleton puts his message
and personality right in the center of his home page with an audio intro-
duction. He qualifies the prospect, introduces himself and his Web site,
acknowledges common objections, and ends with a clear call to action.
The message lasts about a minute, and gives the visitor time to browse
the home page and see Robert’s smiling face to the left of the audio
button. By the time the message is over, Robert’s visitors have been wel-
comed, agitated, reassured, guided, and gently pushed toward the next
step. Experience it for yourself at www.actionplan.com — and make
sure your computer speakers are turned on.
 Mini audio sales letters: Mike Stewart takes the introductory audio mes-
sage approach one step further with a mini sales letter. He includes two
snippets of audio testimonial, and explains why information publishers
need to add audio to their product mix. You can listen at www.internet
audioguy.com by clicking the Play button at the right.
 Testimonials: Audio is a perfect medium for testimonials, which I cover
near the end of Chapter 10. The more testimonials you can collect, the
more credible your sales message. Ken McCarthy of www.thesystem
seminar.org once remarked at a seminar that business owners should
think of their business as a machine to create testimonials. I’ve collected
many testimonials for Leads into Gold by requesting them at the end of a
surprise bonus consultation that I offer. I e-mail some of my customers
and offer them a 15-minute action consultation, and I set aside half an
hour. After the consultation, I ask if they would do me a favor and phone
284
Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

in what they would say to someone who was on the fence about buying
Leads into Gold. You can hear some of the best ones at www.leads
intogold.com near the bottom of the page.
Audio Acrobat (www.audioacrobat.com) allows you to create multiple
testimonial lines, each with its own phone number, so you can provide
recorded instructions specific to the product or service your caller is
praising.
 High perceived value in your content: You can answer questions, inter-
view experts or have other people interview you, read articles you’ve
written, comment on current issues, solve common problems, and do it
all over the phone without having to suffer writer’s block. I discuss a tele-
seminar strategy at the end of Chapter 11; you can extend this method to
collecting and deploying many kinds of valuable audio content.
One way to increase the perceived value of your online audio is to offer the
same audio for sale as a CD. Your visitors have the choice to buy the CD for
$24.95, or they can simply download the audio in MP3 format for free.
If you find you need to edit your audios, you’ll find that a well-constructed
sound-editing program is easier to use than a word processor. For PCs, I love
Sony’s Sound Forge Audio Studio program because it’s cheap, powerful, and
simple. The URL for Sound Forge is ridiculously long, so I’ll post it at www.
askhowie.com/sonyaudio as a live link. A more complicated but free 
program is the open-source sound editor Audacity, available at http://
audacity.sourceforge.net. Audacity is also available in a Mac version.
Stick with two forms of online audio:
 Streaming audio: One format, used by Robert Middleton at www.
actionplan.com, is streaming audio that can be heard online but 
not saved or downloaded. It’s great for short clips, but a pain for long
messages.
You can use the inconvenience factor to your advantage, by offering a
downloadable version of the streaming audio in exchange for contact
information. You can also sell the same audio on your Web site as a ship-
pable CD, but allow people to download it for free. Knowing something
has a price automatically increases the perceived value of a free item.
 MP3 files: The second format is the MP3 file, a format that can be played
online through a player or downloaded and saved on a computer, where
it can be synced with an iPod or other MP3 player. Think of your cus-
tomers listening to your wisdom while driving in their cars or working
out at the gym — what a rush!
Stay away from Real Media and Microsoft’s Windows Media as formats —
their players annoy users with constant pop-ups and reminders to buy or
upgrade. MP3 is a universal format that sounds great and plays on virtually
all players.

How to use Web video to increase sales
by Joe Chapuis (www.webvideozone.com)
Adding video to your Web site can help attract
visitors, add value, and increase site visibility.
But you’ve got to do it right. If you’re not careful,
putting video on your Web site can actually
backfire, chasing people away and causing a lot
of headaches for you in the process.
It’s never been easier to create and add video
to your Web site. But just like with anything else,
there is a learning curve, and there are pitfalls.
Just because it can be done, doesn’t mean it
should be done. You need to know when and
where to use Web video — and when not to.
In addition, not everyone has the same pro-
grams and players on their computers. For
example, if you produce all of your videos in
QuickTime .mov format, people who don’t have
(or want to use) QuickTime will never see your
video.
Your goal should then be to create videos that
are accessible to the greatest common denom-
inator. You’ll want to make sure any video you
offer is viewable to as many visitors as possible,
while minimizing hassles and tech problems for
your viewers.
And while it’s true that placing video on the Web
is now quite easy, that doesn’t necessarily
mean it’s always a good idea. Sometimes, your
message can be better told using text with a
few images. In other instances, an audio mes-
sage will suffice. Video isn’t the end-all solution
for everything you have to say.
So before you rush into posting video on your
Web site, consider these important points:
1. Web video done poorly is worse than no
video at all.
This is especially true if your video clips
don’t play properly, or if the quality of the
video reflects poorly on you or your site. In
these cases, it would be better not to use
Internet video on your site.
2. Internet video may not work for all visitors.
Some Web surfers are still using Windows
98 or older operating systems. Many of
these older systems do not support the
playing of video very well. One solution is 
to offer your video clips in as many different
video formats as possible. Unfortunately,
this can be a frustrating and time-
consuming process for you.
3. Know your target market.
Not everyone experiences the Internet the
same way. People access the Web at very
different connection speeds. While more
than half of the U.S. Web-connected popu-
lation now enjoys a high-speed broadband
experience (and for these people, video is
no problem), there are still many people
connecting via painfully slow telephone
modems.
By knowing who you are targeting, you 
can better determine if video makes sense
for your site, as well as the best way to
deploy it.
4. Video requires a lot of storage space.
On average, a one-minute video clip of
average quality and resolution often
requires at least 2MB of Web hosting
space. If you offer that same clip in the six
most popular formats, it is possible that you
would need 20MB of space — just for that
one minute of video! And if you offer a total
of 20 minutes of video, and provide it in all
different formats, you could easily consume
400MB of Web space.
5. Video is a bandwidth hog.
If 100 people click to view your 5-minute
video at the same time, they could jointly
require and consume 2GB of bandwidth, all
at the same time! Depending upon your
hosting package, that alone could exceed
your allocated monthly bandwidth.

Video
As more and more Web users upgrade from dialup to broadband connec-
tions, the Internet is ready to serve as an interactive multimedia channel.
YouTube has already trained us to watch video online. If you sell products,
you can combine the visual and auditory richness of a QVC or infomercial
with the click-to-buy immediacy of a Web page with AdWords’ ability to show
the right message to the right person.
You can use video to demonstrate products, to show even more of your per-
sonality to your visitors, to display powerful testimonials, to chat with your
market, and much more. With a decent video camera and good lighting, cer-
tain types of video content are almost as easy to create as text and audio.
Saying “make yourself at home” with video
Online video can serve as a warm welcome to your Web site; a way to say
hello, orient your visitor, and create an immediate emotional bond. If you
think of your Web site as your home, and your visitors as, well, your visitors,
287
Chapter 12: Building a “Climb the Ladder” Web Site
Imagine what would happen if 1,000 people
clicked to view your 5-minute video . . . your
Web host would likely crash, due to the
inability to fulfill the huge bandwidth
request. And your Web host won’t be very
happy. And neither will you, when they send
you their bill.
6. Clicking away from your site and your
Internet video is effortless.
Even with the fastest Web connection,
viewing high quality video on a computer
monitor can be tedious — especially com-
pared to watching that same video on TV.
For best results, Web video clips should be
short (under 3 minutes) and to the point.
Once the novelty wears off (and it will, once
video becomes commonplace — very
soon), people are going to be less willing to
sit there and watch some idiot skateboard-
ing off his roof.
In order to grab and hold attention, and get
some kind of result, Internet video needs to
be: compelling, useful, and/or entertaining.
7. Be careful when choosing an Internet video
format.
Whether the video you plan to offer is a
computer screen tutorial, or live video
footage shot with a camcorder, you may
want to offer your video in multiple formats,
making it viewable by as many people as
possible.
But at the same time, too many choices may
confuse and overwhelm your audience. In
addition, there are time and cost consider-
ations for creating and deploying your
videos. If you offer five different choices,
you need to create and upload five different
videos (and what happens if you need to
make a change to the video?).

webvideozone.com, which offers tools, tips

Giving a shop tour with video
Josephine Canovas is a professional horse breeder and trainer in Spain. She
sells Andalusian horses internationally. Obviously, most of her customers will
not travel to her horse farm to view the horses and their living conditions.
She uses video to show, rather than tell, about her horses and the care they
receive. At www.andalusians-for-you.com/break-page-1.html you
can view raw video of the stable and its daily happenings.
Running a Home Shopping Channel on your site
The Web boasts several significant advantages over TV shopping shows:
 The production costs are much lower.
 You are showing products to people who are searching for those prod-
ucts, rather than just channel surfing during commercials.
 Your visitors can program your channel to show the exact product
they’re interested in right now, rather than wading through hours of
knives and dehydrators to get to the levitating steamer basket.
 You can make money with small market items because you’re attracting
high-quality traffic and you don’t have to keep paying to air your show.
 You can complete the transaction in the same medium as you’re selling.
When you watch TV, you can’t buy the product using the TV — you need
to pick up the phone.
At www.myweddingfavors.tv (shown in Figure 12-6), you can watch a home
shopping style show and choose among Beach Favors, Seasonal Favorites,
Bridal Shower Favorites and others. When the hosts show and describe an
item, the Web page changes to display that item to the right of the video,
along with buttons for More Info, E-mail a Friend, and Buy This Item.
Displaying customer testimonials
Ken McCarthy of www.thesystemseminar.org has been collecting video
testimonials during his seminars since 2002. He makes them available on a
brilliant site, www.askagrad.com. The home page of the site invites visitors
to self-identify based on their current situation, and then serves the video tes-
timonials most relevant to that group. If you visit the site and describe your-
self as a Smart Beginner, you’ll be taken to a page that includes a testimonial
that I gave in 2002 (shown in Figure 12-7), when I had short hair and no dragon
tattoo across the bridge of my nose. Oh, wait, I still don’t have a dragon tattoo
on the bridge of my nose. I must have been thinking of someone else.

Teaching with video
Whatever your business, you have expertise that other people lack. When
you make that expertise available online, you gain credibility as an expert
helper, not just a self-interested peddler. Video offers the highest emotional
bandwidth for your visitors to assess your knowledge and your character.
Oliver Sachs wrote in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat about a group
of patients in the aphasia ward who were laughing hysterically at a speech
given by then-president Reagan. Although the patients had lost the ability to
understand language, they ascertained he was lying by observing his facial
expressions, gestures, and vocal tones and cadences. Just as video can
destroy trust, it can also build trust when your goal is to be helpful and
straight with your market.
The Kabbalah education site www.arionline.info features instructional
videos that introduce the subject of Kabbalah and the instructors. Through
music, spoken word, and moving images, the videos not only instruct but elicit
emotional reactions. Just as many of us have developed crushes on total
strangers because we see them in Hollywood movies (I still have a thing for
Amy Irving in Crossing Delancey, heaven help me), skillful video can create rela-
tionships with customers you haven’t met yet, and may never meet in person.
The For Dummies people wouldn’t let me include actual videos on these
pages, even though I know it can be done from watching Harry Potter movies.
Even thought I can’t show you any video examples in these pages, you can go
to www.askhowie.com/video for links and discussion of good and bad uses
of Internet video.
Recognizing and welcoming 
returning visitors with PHP
In Chapter 10 I show you how the PHP programming language can serve your
visitors customized Web pages straight from the AdWords click. You can also
use PHP to recognize returning visitors, so you can present them with rele-
vant information and offers.
You’ve seen this in action if you’re an Amazon.com customer. You’re greeted 
by name, which is nice, but the really powerful application is the personalized
recommendations based on your previous shopping history. In Figure 12-8,
Amazon.com asks me if I’m aware that it sells organic food. Actually, I wasn’t
aware of it, because I’ve never bought groceries from Amazon.com before. So
how did it know/figure out/guess that I’m into healthy eating? Hmmm, do you
think my prior purchases of Disease-Proof Your Child: Feeding Kids Right by 
Joel Fuhrman (St. Martin’s Griffin) and The China Study: The Most Comprehensive

Part IV: Converting Clicks to Clink 

Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted and the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight
Loss, and Long-Term Health by T. Colin Campbell and Thomas M. Campbell II
(Benbella Books), had anything to do with it?
Amazon.com uses its enormous database of customer behavior to make 
targeted offers. You can accomplish the same thing, on a much simpler scale,
by engaging a PHP programmer to create a script that recognizes people
who’ve visited your site before, and make the next offer. Rob Goyette of
www.vaelos.com gives the following example of a simple returning cus-
tomer page headline for an online sporting goods store: “Welcome back,
Howie, I hope you’re enjoying your new ping-pong table. Do you want to see
our line of tournament-quality paddles and balls?”

O
ne of my favorite things about the Internet is how
cheaply and quickly I can fail — and how much I can
learn from each failure. This part reveals simple strategies
that virtually guarantee success if you implement them
diligently, no matter how many failures you encounter.
Chapter 13 explains how to continually improve your ads
by running multiple ads simultaneously and showing the
different versions randomly to Google searchers. (Hint:
Write two ads — Google does this automatically if you
know how to change the default campaign settings.)
Here’s where you also get a handle on split-testing pages
on your Web site.
The immensely powerful AdWords conversion-tracking
feature is covered in Chapter 14. I show you how to add
code to your Web site so Google can tell you how much
money you’re making or losing from every single ad and
keyword. Armed with this intelligence, you can dramati-
cally improve profitability and reduce your AdWords
spend.
In Chapter 15, I introduce Google Analytics, a comprehen-
sive Web site statistics program that ties in with AdWords
to give you even more information about how to design an
effective Web site.

M
ost people find that writing an effective AdWords creative is challeng-
ing. In the old days (2004, actually), advertisers found their ads swat-
ted down constantly by the 0.5% CTR (Click-Through Rate) threshold. That is,
not even 5 in 1000 searchers would click their ad, and Google felt that an ad
so unattractive did not deserve to remain active.
The difficulty of successful ad creation is understandable — you’ve got 130
characters to convince someone to choose your offer over 19 other close-to-
identical ads on the same page. Plus, writing good ads is tough in the best of
circumstances.
Many elite Internet marketers attend the annual System Seminar (www.
thesystemseminar.org). At one of these events, Perry Marshall of www.
perrysmarshall.com demonstrated the need for split testing by challeng-
ing audience members — professional marketers all — to choose the more
effective ad or headline from a series of 10 split tests. The best of us got no
more than 4 or 5 out of 10 correct. As we held our hands up high and proud
for having achieved 50 percent on the test, Perry shot us down: “If I had
flipped a coin, I would have done as well as you. Congratulations. You guys
are as smart as a penny.”
If you want to be smarter than a penny, you must apply the most powerful
tool in the marketer’s arsenal: split testing.

In this chapter, I show you how to set up split testing with AdWords and ana-
lyze the results. I tell you about split-testing landing pages, as well as your
entire sales process. Also, you discover only what you need to know about
statistical significance (which, in this case, relates to your confidence level
that the split-testing results are repeatable) to make the best choices about
your ads.
Capturing the Magic of Split Testing
Nothing leads to improvement faster than timely and clear feedback. While a
million monkeys typing would eventually produce the entire works of
Shakespeare, they would get there much faster if they got a banana every
time they typed an actual word, and an entire banana split when they man-
aged a rhymed couplet in iambic pentameter. (Can you tell I’ve been reading
Shakespeare For Dummies, by John Doyle and Ray Lischner?) And for every
nonword, someone would chuck a copy of Typing Shakespeare For Monkeys
at them.
Now suppose the monkeys could keep and understand a written record of
the characters that produced bananas, banana splits, and no reward. After a
while, you would see more and more real words and Shakespearean phrasing,
and fewer xlkjdfsdfsr. Ouch!
AdWords contains the world’s simplest mechanism for getting timely and
clear feedback on your ads. You can create multiple ads, which AdWords
shows to your prospects in equal rotation, and you can receive automatic
and ongoing feedback.
Split testing is not an AdWords innovation — direct marketers have been test-
ing customers’ response rates since Moses got two tablets of command-
ments. Readers’ Digest used to choose headlines for its articles by sending
postcards to readers, asking which articles they would be interested in read-
ing in an upcoming issue. The list of articles was actually a list of headlines
for the same article.
Here’s how split testing works in AdWords:
1. Run two ads simultaneously within a single ad group.
2. Monitor the effectiveness of both ads at eliciting the customer
response you want.
Continue monitoring until one of those ads has proven itself better at its
calling.
3. Declare the proven ad the winner (or, in marketing geek-speak, the
control).
296
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

4. Retire the less successful ad, replace it with a new challenger, and
repeat the contest.
If the challenger does better, it becomes the new control. If the control
maintains supremacy, you send a different challenger up against it.
The beauty of this split-testing system is that you can’t help but improve
your results over time. If a new ad proves worse than your control, simply
delete it. And the added beauty is that you don’t even have to know what
you’re doing to improve your ad’s effectiveness. While market intelligence,
creativity, and writing skill help, mere trial and error — when funneled
through split testing — can boost your results significantly.
One of my early AdWords projects was an ad for a direct-marketing home-
study course for small businesses (see the series of ads in Figure 13-1). An
early ad, headlined “Cold calling — now illegal,” achieved a 0.7% CTR. The
final ad I used — “Cold calling not working?” — nearly quadrupled that with a
2.7% CTR. The big lesson from this long series of ads is this: I had no idea
what I was doing at the time, yet I still succeeded. Take a few minutes and
examine each of the ads carefully. Be honest — could you predict which of
these ads would do better than the rest? I couldn’t. I still can’t. But the num-
bers don’t lie, and I was able to turn a marginal product into a success thanks
to split testing.

Conducting Split Testing with AdWords
Split testing with AdWords follows the four-step process outlined by in the
preceding section. You can prepare yourself to launch a series of split-testing
ads by getting curious about what messages will be most compelling to your
prospects. Turn each message into an ad and get ready to have fun.
Creating a challenger ad
Creating your second ad is even easier than creating your first (see Chapter 3
for step-by-step instructions):
1. From the Campaign Management tab, click the campaign that contains
the ad group you’re working on.
2. Click the Ad Group to which you are adding an ad.
3. Click the Ad Variations tab.
4. Next to + Create New Ad, click the Text Ad button, as shown in 
Figure 13-2.
An ad template with sample copy appears on-screen.
Figure 13-2:

on the Ad
Variations
tab.
298
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

5. Type over the existing copy and URL with your challenger ad’s copy
and URL.
6. Click the Save Ad button.
7. Below the ad at the top of the Ad Group summary page, click the
small View All link to confirm the existence of a second ad.
After your challenger ad is in place, you want to make sure that your two ads
will compete fairly. Google assumes you’re too busy (or lazy) to monitor your
split tests, so the default setting is for AdWords to show the ad with the
higher CTR more, and gradually let the poorer-performing ad slip into 
oblivion.
You want to override this setting for two reasons:
 An ad with a lower CTR may still be the more profitable ad (see Chap-
ter 14 for details of this apparent paradox).
 When you let AdWords evaluate the ads without your supervision, you
don’t learn anything that makes you a smarter advertiser. The faster you
declare winning and losing ads, the faster your marketing improves.
Here’s how you override the AdWords default setting that may kill an ad with-
out your approval. (Note: You establish this setting on the campaign level, so
you may need to do this with each campaign.)
1. From the Campaign Management tab, click the campaign that contains
the ad group you’re working on.
2. Click Edit Campaign Settings.
A page with various campaign-level settings appears.
3. Under Advanced Options, the fourth setting is called Ad Serving.
Select the Rotate: Show Ads More Evenly radio button.
4. Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the Campaign Settings
page.
Now you’re split testing properly. Once you install conversion tracking 
(see Chapter 14), you have the ability to compare the profitability of your
ads. Until then, the only thing you can compare is the CTR.
Monitoring the split test
Just as you wouldn’t put a cake in a 350° F oven and not pay attention to
when it was done, you wouldn’t set up a split test and then ignore the results.
There are three ways to check up on your cake to make sure it doesn’t burn
and the fork comes out clean:
299
Chapter 13: How You Can’t Help Becoming an Advertising Genius

 Haphazardly: Check up on your cake when you think of it. As long as
you catch it before the smoke alarm does, the cake might turn out okay.
 Annoyingly: Set your watch to beep every few minutes to remind you to
check the cake.
 Geekily: Install a sensor in the oven that alerts you when the cake is
done.
These three methods are available for monitoring your AdWords split tests as
well:
 With the haphazard method, you can look at each ad group once a day,
once every three days, once a week, whenever Dartmouth wins a foot-
ball game, and so on. The interval you choose should relate to the
amount of traffic your ads are getting. For example, if you get 50 click-
throughs per day, you might want to check your ads every day. A huge
stream of traffic will give you a winner much quicker than a trickle, all
other things being equal. But even if your traffic is massive, wait at least
a couple of days before declaring a winner. Visitors checking out your ad
at three o’clock in the morning on Sunday are likely to be very different
from Monday afternoon visitors. You want to collect a representative
sample to be sure your results are accurate.
 With the annoying, repetitive method, you can create reports within
AdWords and schedule those reports (see Chapter 14).
 With the geeky, pass-the-buck method, you can subscribe to a third-
party service that monitors all your split tests and e-mails you when you
have a winner (see the section, “Automating your testing with Winner
Alert” later in this chapter).
Declaring a winner
Okay, so you’re watching your split tests with eagle eyes and keen concentra-
tion. How do you know when one ad has outperformed another? After all, as
the investment ads say, “Past performance doesn’t guarantee future results.”
Fortunately, the testing process is simple and straightforward when you’re
running a single test of two different ads. You just want to answer the ques-
tion, “Is this result real, or just a random coincidence?” That’s where your
friend and mine — statistical significance — makes a welcome appearance.
Understanding statistical significance
If I flip a coin twice and it lands heads both times, should I assume that coin
will always come up heads? Of course not — two flips don’t give me enough
data to reach that conclusion. What about four flips, all heads? Less likely,
but still plausible? What about ten flips, all heads? Are we getting a tad suspi-
cious now? It could still be due to random chance — after all, every single flip
300
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

of a fair coin has an equal chance of landing heads or tails — or, possibly, this
is no fair coin. If I get to 20, 30, 100 flips with no tails in sight, I can be pretty
sure something’s up.
In your AdWords split testing, you’re looking for information that will tell you
that something’s up. You want to know that one ad is truly better than
another, and that the difference in CTR is not due to randomness. If you run
two ads with identical text but different URLs (www.ComfortSoap.com
versus www.YouProbablyNeedaShower.com), and the first URL gets
clicked three times and the second not once, is that enough data to retire the
second ad and bring in a new challenger? Just as with the coin, you can never
know for absolute certain. Statistical significance tells you the probability
that you’re making the right choice.
Testing for significance
If you’re doing it yourself, here are the steps to assessing the significance of
your results and deciding whether to declare a winner:
1. From your AdWords account, click through to the Ad Group you want
to test.
2. Click the Ad Variations tab, and write down the following numbers:
• Number of clicks for Ad #1
• Impressions for Ad #1
• Number of clicks for Ad #2
• Impressions for Ad #2
3. Go to www.askhowie.com/split and enter the four numbers in the
appropriate fields.
4. Look at your confidence interval and see whether you have a winner.
I’m willing to accept a 95% threshold for my split testing. I can live with the
knowledge that 1 out of every 20 split tests is giving me a bogus sense of 
confidence. Below that, and I want to keep running the test until I achieve 
significance, or until I’m satisfied that there really is no difference between
the two ads.
What if you have no winner?
Let’s say you’re testing two ads, and they’re running neck and neck for days.
Weeks. Months. In this case, you’re losing money by continuing the test. Sure,
at some point the data might tip one way or the other, but the simple fact is,
the difference isn’t going to be important in real life. Drop the challenger
(keeping the control makes sense because it’s got more history behind it)
and get a new challenger. Pull the plug on a test when each ad has at least 
100 clicks.

Chapter 13: How You Can’t Help Becoming an Advertising Genius

Strategies for Effective Split Testing
Many AdWords beginners understand the concept of split testing, but do it
haphazardly and without strategy. They learn that split testing is too confus-
ing and complicated, and give up on the most powerful weapon in their mar-
keting arsenal. The following sections discuss three strategies to assure a
streamlined and effective split-testing process.
1. Start wide, get narrow
When you begin split-testing in an ad group, choose two very different ads.
You may want to focus on different markets (stay-at-home dads versus
divorced/widowed dads with full custody), different emotional responses
(greed versus fear), or different benefits (lose weight versus prevent heart
disease). Get the big picture right before drilling down to the details. It does
you no good to test easy versus simple in a headline if your prospects don’t
care about ease or simplicity, but just whether it can run on batteries.
Once you discover the right market, key benefits, and the emotional hot 
buttons of that market, you can start testing more specific elements (see the
upcoming section, “Generating Ideas for Ad Testing”).
2. Keep track of your tests
Remember high-school chemistry class? You had to buy a marble notebook
and keep track of all your experiments, including date, hypothesis, experi-
ment design, and results.
Chances are that your bright ideas about ad testing are not new. If you don’t
keep track somehow, you’ll find yourself repeating experiments to which you
already know the answer. Keeping track of your results in a marble notebook,
or its digital equivalent (a Word document, private blog, or Excel spreadsheet),
is crucial to moving forward efficiently.
3. Split testing is just asking questions
Split testing can become so mechanical, it’s easy to forget the purpose is to
make you smarter by learning what makes your customers tick — er, click.
Perry Marshall distinguishes between true market research and what he calls
“opinion research.” Opinion research is what people say they’ll do. Market
302
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

research is what they actually do. Split testing is a powerful form of market
research that will provide answers to whatever questions you ask. As the
computer programmers are fond of saying, “Garbage In, Garbage Out.” If you
ask intelligent questions, you’ll get useful answers.
So before you run a split test, take a moment to write down (in your lab note-
book, of course) the question you want your prospects to answer for you.
Then design a split test that asks that question.
The following figures show some examples of good questions and the split
tests that were set up to answer them:
How much traffic do I give up if I put the price of the product in the ad? 
(See Figure 13-3.)
Will positioning my product as a “professional shares his secrets” increase
clicks, compared to flagging the benefit of family fun? (See Figure 13-4.)
Generating Ideas for Ad Testing
You want to test broadly different ideas before getting into details. Don’t
worry about whether description line 2 should have a comma in it before
you’ve figured out the answers to your big questions. Imagine that you’re
searching for the most delicious plum in the world. First you test the orchard
to make sure it has plum trees and not orange trees. Once you’ve found the
plum orchard, start testing trees to find the tree with the best plums. Once
you’ve found the best tree, see whether you prefer the plums near the top or
Figure 13-4:

tells-all”
approach 
is a clear
winner.
Figure 13-3:

Chapter 13: How You Can’t Help Becoming an Advertising Genius

closer to the ground. On the north or the south side. Then taste the fruit on
different limbs, and once you’ve found the most promising limb, see which
branch yields the best fruit.
David Bullock’s (www.davidbullock.com) list of big questions from
Chapter 6 comes in handy here:
 Who is looking?
 What are they looking for?
 Why are they looking for it?
 What will be the end result of their search?
 What does the searcher want the ultimate outcome to be?
 What is the emotional good feeling they seek?
 What emotional outcome are they trying to avoid?
 Who does the searcher care about?
 What does the searcher care about?
In other words, split test the ads to discover the demographics and psycho-
graphics of your market. Who are they — working mothers or single career
women taking care of aging parents? What big benefit are they looking for in
your product — saving time or assuaging guilt? Are they angry at their com-
pany or do they feel grateful? Who do they want to help them with this 
problem — Walter Cronkite or Jon Stewart?
Use your split tests to answer these questions as best you can. Write down a
hypothesis and brainstorm two ads that will prove or disprove it. Once
you’ve tested the big ideas, turn your attention to the little things that can
make a big difference:
 Order of lines: If you’re highlighting the benefit on line 1 and explaining
a feature on line 2, try switching the order of the two lines.
 Display URLs: If you buy a bunch of domain names related to your main
domain, you can point them all to the same Web site and test which
domain name attracts the right customers. If you have the .com and
.org for the same domain, will one outperform the other?
 Capitalization: Finding the right capitalization of your URL to make its
meaning stand out is an art form. For example, I found that
LeadsintoGold.com did better than leadsintogold.com in almost
every test.
 Synonyms: Try variations of your benefits: simple/easy/quick/no sweat.
304
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

 Punctuation: Perry Marshall talks about the cadence of an ad — the way
the searchers hear it in the mind’s ear can subtly influence whether they
resonate with it. Use punctuation to make the phrase more melodic and
persuasive. Figure 13-5 shows what happened when I used a comma to
put the emphasis on You instead of on Instead:
The ad with the comma is four times as effective as the other one. Without
testing, there’s no way I would have predicted the effect would be so 
profound.
Tools for Split Testing
With the proper tools, split testing can be the most powerful tactic in your
entire marketing strategy. The following tools allow you to split test faster to
improve faster.
Automating your testing with Winner Alert
My AdWords account is quite large at this point. I have 27 separate cam-
paigns. Many of the campaigns include dozens of ad groups. Each of these
groups is running a split test pretty much all the time. I probably have to
monitor well over 100 split tests simultaneously. If I were to go into each ad
group and pull out the data, and enter it into a statistical significance calcula-
tor, it would take me the better part of a day just to assess the tests. And that
doesn’t even include the time it takes me to think up new ad variations to
challenge the winners.
If you’re just starting out and you’re running fewer than 10 ad groups at a
time, you won’t feel my pain. But once your campaigns grow, you’ll either
stop tracking the results of your tests, or you’ll wait too long to find winners.
Waiting too long means you’re ignoring profit-growing market data, and
you’re showing prospects suboptimal ads.
Figure 13-5:
In this 
split test, 
a comma

the CTR.
305
Chapter 13: How You Can’t Help Becoming an Advertising Genius

To help alleviate this problem, I created a tool called Winner Alert that auto-
mates the process of tracking the statistical significance, and e-mails you
whenever one of your split tests produces a winner. It’s a great tool, and
when you’re ready for it, you can try it free for a month. Go to www.
askhowie.com/winner for video demos and your coupon code.
Turbocharging your testing with Taguchi
The Taguchi Method lets you test hundreds of variations in a fraction of the
time it would take if you used a standard A-B split. It’s not for beginners; the
methodology is so complicated, it’s easy to fall into the Garbage-In-Garbage-
Out trap and believe you have the answer to Life, the Universe, and
Everything because the printout looks so impressive.
You should consider Taguchi testing if and only if your keywords get at least
several thousand daily impressions each, and if the person setting up your
test has experience using Taguchi for marketing. Taguchi testing was origi-
nally developed to reduce manufacturing errors, and many practitioners mis-
apply a manufacturing mindset to the marketing process. David Bullock is the
premiere Taguchi marketer who applies the method to AdWords. You can find
an article he wrote to protect you from incorrect and unnecessary use of
Taguchi at www.askhowie.com/taguchi.
Split Testing Web Pages
You can split test other elements of your Web site (and your sales funnel)
using AdWords’ split-testing capabilities. For example, you can run two visu-
ally identical ads with different destination URLs. If you have conversion
tracking set up (see Chapter 14), you’ll be able to see which Web page pro-
duced more leads and sales just by comparing your two ads’ cost-per-
conversion.
Once you’ve mastered the techniques in Part V, you can benefit from some
third-party tools that make it almost as easy to test and track Web pages as it
is to split test Google ads. Bonus Chapter 1 (available as a PDF file at www.
dummies.com/go/adwords) describes a couple of the best of these tools —
and tells you where to get them.

S
ay you’re split-testing two ads, and one gets a conversion rate of 1.00%,
while the other converts only 0.77%. The first ad is definitely a keeper,
right? Without conversion tracking, you might think so. But what if the first
ad attracts lots of non-buyers, while the second ad gets clicks from buyers?
Remember that a click on your ad means one thing for certain: You’ve just
paid Google. When you think about it this way, your AdWords strategy shifts
from trying to get the highest CTR to enticing only the most qualified
prospects to your site. In order to tell which ad leads to sales and not just
clicks, you need to install conversion tracking.
By conversion, Google simply means an action that you want a visitor to take
on your Web site. When you can track a visitor’s actions on your site, you
know what clicks lead to sales. Conversion tracking also allows you to bid
more intelligently on keywords. You may find that a high-traffic keyword
that’s costing you a lot of money isn’t actually generating leads and sales. You
can then lower your bid, change your offer, or fire the keyword. Without con-
version tracking, all your campaign-management efforts are shots in the dark,
tinkering with inputs without really knowing what’s happening at the other
end. It’s like learning to shoot free throws in basketball with no feedback
about whether your shot went in or missed left, right, too far, or too short.
Conversion tracking is simply a snippet of code added to your Web site that
places a cookie on your visitors’ computers. This cookie tells Google where
the visitors came from, down to the keyword and the ad, and what they did
on your site. You can see which ads and keywords are making you money,

and which aren’t. In this chapter, I show you how to set up conversion track-
ing correctly (do it wrong and you’ll suffer from the GIGO — Garbage In,
Garbage Out — Syndrome and make lots of bad decisions). You’ll see how to
read and interpret the data generated by conversion tracking, and how to
improve your account based on this new intelligence. You’ll also discover
how to design quick-scan reports that can be generated automatically and
e-mailed to you on a regular basis.
Setting Up Conversion Tracking
From the Campaign Management tab, click Conversion Tracking from the sub-
menu (see Figure 14-1). Before getting started on the next page, watch the
step-by-step Flash demo (either from the link in the body of the page, or from
the link Understanding Conversion Tracking under Helpful Documentation on
the right. When you’re ready, click the Start Tracking Conversions button to
continue.
Choosing a conversion type
Google identifies five different types of conversion that you may want to track:
sales, leads, signups, views of a page, and other, as shown in Figure 14-2. You
can track as many different conversions as you want. The following list gives
you a look at the five types of conversions so you determine when it makes
sense to use each one:
 Purchase/Sale: If you sell products online, you can determine exactly
how much money you make from each ad and keyword.
 Lead: If you collect contact information so you can follow up with Web
site visitors, you can track leads. If you don’t sell products online, and
use the Web mostly for lead generation, you can get very powerful infor-
mation on cost-per-lead for your ads and keywords.
 Signup: Google distinguishes between signups and leads; I don’t. If
someone subscribes to my online newsletter, then by golly, I think of
them as a lead. If you maintain two lists, you can distinguish them by
treating one as a list of leads and the other as a list of signups.

 Views of a Key Page: Let’s say you have a certain page that you want
visitors to see because you’ve noticed a connection between traffic to
that page and the success of your business. Maybe it’s the About Us
page; maybe a powerful testimonial; maybe your daily menu. You can
determine which ads and keywords reliably generate visitors who get to
that page.
 Other: I can’t think of any others. If you can, this is the one to use.
Choose one of these types for your first conversion to track, and click
Continue at the bottom of the page. On the next page, you’ll be able to design
the block of text that lets your Web site visitors know that Google is monitor-
ing their online activity. The default is one line of white text on a gray back-
ground. Google will automatically adjust the text color — either white or
black — to be visible against the background you choose. Customize this text
block to keep it from standing out on your Web page. Generally, I leave the
default alone and just click Continue at the bottom.
Selecting language and security level
Before generating the tracking code, you need to tell Google two more things:
the language of your Web page (English, Spanish, Russian, and so on), and
the security level of the page on which you will place the code.
 Language: From the drop-down menu, select the language of your text
block. Google will translate the “Google Site Stats — send 
feedback” text block into that language.

Chapter 14: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking

 Security Level: The tracking code goes on the page following the con-
version. You are concerned only with the security level of that confirma-
tion page, the one where you put the code. You have two choices, based
on the URL prefix:
http:// - normal security
https:// - heightened security
In other words, if the URL of the page your visitor goes to following the
conversion starts with https://, then choose the https:// option from
the Select a Security Level drop-down list. Not doing so will cause your
visitor to see a nasty little security-alert pop-up.
Generating and copying the code
You now can generate the code that goes on your Web page (for example, if
you’re tracking sales, you’d insert the code into your “Thanks for your pur-
chase” page). Scroll to the bottom of the page and click anywhere in the text
box to select the entire code snippet, as shown in Figure 14-3.
I recommend copying the conversion code and pasting it into a plain text docu-
ment (a .txt file, not a .doc or .rtf) for safekeeping, rather than immediately
dropping the code into your Web page. That way you’ll have a saved version of
the code if you ever need it again. Make sure you give the text document an
obvious-but-descriptive name, such as Google Conv Tracking.txt.
Figure 14-3:
Clicking

310
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

That’s it! You’ve generated the tracking code. You don’t need to click the
Continue button; simply go back to the Campaign Summary tab in the
Campaign Management submenu. You should see two new columns — 
Conv. Rate and Cost/Conv. — filled completely with zeroes. Once you place
the code on your Web site, Google will replace the zeroes with your conver-
sion numbers.
Assigning a value to a conversion
Before I show you where and how to put the conversion code onto your Web
site, let’s talk about the Advanced Option: Conversion Value link just to the
right of the text box.
Click that link if you want to assign a monetary value to the conversion. The
easiest example is a sale: If you sell a product for $37, that conversion is
worth $37 to your top line. Enter the value of the conversion, click Refresh,
and click in the text box to the left to copy the code that includes the conver-
sion value.
You can enter the sale price or your net profit as the conversion value, what-
ever makes more sense. I prefer to use net profit, so I can see that a keyword
with a CPC of $0.35 is worth $0.75 in my bank account, after expenses.
You can create conversions of many different values. If you sell three ver-
sions of the same product, you can put different-valued conversion code on
the thank-you pages for each version, as shown in Table 14-1.

Putting code on your Web site
The code snippet goes on the Web page that your visitor reaches after suc-
cessfully taking the action you’re measuring. In other words, if you want them
to opt in, the code goes on the “Thank you for opting in” page. For conver-
sion tracking to be accurate, three things must be true about this page:
311
Chapter 14: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking

1. Every visitor who performs the desired action goes to the confirmation
page (into which you insert the conversion code) following that action.
2. A visitor who doesn’t perform the desired action will not get to the con-
firmation page.
3. Visitors can’t refresh the confirmation page to create false multiple con-
versions. (See www.askhowie.com/norefresh for details.)
If the conversion is a page view, then the code goes on the viewed page itself.
In other cases, the confirmation page is the next page. If you are using an
e-mail-management service such as AWeber (see Chapter 10), put your code
on the page you designate as the Thank You page in the autoresponder setup.
Where to place the snippet
The conversion-tracking code should go just above the </body> tag on your
confirmation page, as in Figure 14-4.
Visit www.askhowie.com/conversioncode for a video tutorial on putting
code on your Web site.
Common tracking-code mistakes
The following list gives you a rundown of the common mistakes people make
when inserting the conversion code (by reading this list and taking it to
heart, you can avoid these mishaps!):
Figure 14-4:

Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

 Putting the code in the header or footer. If you place the tracking code
in the header or footer of a page, it may show up on every single page in
your Web site. Every page view will then be counted as a conversion.
 Putting code on the wrong page. Don’t put the tracking code on the
conversion page itself, but on the page that is served following success-
ful conversion. (An exception is a page view conversion, where the con-
firmation page and the page itself are one and the same.)
 Putting the code on the same page multiple times. With complicated
Web pages, it’s easy to forget that you’ve already placed the tracking
code on the page.
If you’re not sure whether your tracking code is currently on your Web
page, view the source code of the page. Here’s the drill:
1. Choose View➪Source in your browser.
The source code appears in a text editor window.
2. Choose Edit➪Find, and enter Google Code in the Find What text box.
3. Click the Find Next button to search the code.
Tracking sales from a shopping cart
You can configure conversion tracking to record the total amount your visi-
tors spend by using dynamic fields generated by your e-commerce system.
For example, if you use Yahoo! Stores or eBay/PayPal shops, you can modify
the code snippet to tell Google how much a visitor spent on your site. You
can also get this information from a shopping cart written in ASP (Active
Server Pages), JSP (Sun Java Server Pages), or PHP.
If you aren’t a proficient coder and don’t know what CGI means, please don’t
try this yourself. Send your Webmaster to https://adwords.google.
com/select/setup.pdf for full documentation on configuring dynamic
shopping carts for conversion tracking.
Testing conversion tracking
To see whether Google is tracking the conversion you set up, you have two
choices: the quick and (possibly) expensive way, or the natural way. The
quickest way to confirm correct setup is to search Google for your keyword,
click your ad, and perform the desired action. You should see that conver-
sion in your campaign summary screen as a non-zero number somewhere in
the two new columns (see the following section). If you don’t want to waste a
click, your other choice is to wait for a real visitor to convert. Unless your
clicks cost several dollars each, I recommend spending the money yourself
and making sure you’re getting useful data.
313
Chapter 14: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking

Introducing Two New Columns
Once you’ve triggered conversion tracking by generating the code snippet,
Google shows you two new columns in the campaign management pages:
Conv. Rate (conversion rate) and Cost/Conv. (cost per conversion), as shown
in Figure 14-5. Until you place the conversion code on your site and visitors
start converting, you will see zeroes in those columns. Also, expect a 24-hour
delay in reporting a conversion.
Conversion rate
The conversion rate is the percent of visitors from that campaign, ad group,
ad, or keyword who complete a conversion. Let’s drill down to the ad group
level to make this clear. In Figure 14-6, you can see six ad groups in the Gout
campaign. Two of the groups have led to sales, which is the only conversion
I’m tracking in this case. A sale equals one conversion. The first group, Gout
Disabled Keywords, received 2211 clicks and converted 0.81% of them to
sales. When I do the math (2211 × 0.0081), I find that this ad group is respon-
sible for 17.9 sales. (I’m going to round up to 18 sales because I don’t see how
I can make nine-tenths of a sale.) You can also hover your cursor over the
conversion rate percentage to see the actual number of sales.
The next ad group, Gout Diet, turned 958 clicks into 7 sales (958 × 0.0071).
None of the other groups led to sales during this time period.
Cost/Conv.
The second new column, Cost/Conv., refers to how much you spent on
AdWords, on average, for each conversion. In the Gout Disabled Keywords
group, for example, I spent $9.71 to make a sale. Whether that’s good or bad
Figure 14-5:
The
columns
Conv. Rate
and Cost/
Conv.
appear after

conversion
tracking.
314
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

depends on how much I earned from each sale. In this case, the Gout e-book
sells for either $17.77 or $37.77, depending on whether the visitor purchases
the basic or deluxe version. Assuming the worst case — that all the sales
were the basic version — I’m still making a gross profit of $8.06 per sale. I’ll
take that.
Actually, I’m making less than $8.06 per sale, since I have to pay for credit-
card processing. When your margins are tight, make sure you’re accounting
for all costs as you determine your ROI.
The second ad group is bringing in customers for $11.29 each, or a profit of
$6.48 per sale. Still okay, but not as good as the first group. In general, the
lower this number, the better you’re doing. The exception is if the cost-per-
conversion is zero.
Look at the next four groups to see this clearly: no sales, so a $0.00 cost per
conversion. Zero is the worst number to see in this column, because it means
you’ve achieved nothing. Luckily, my AdWords expenditures for these groups
are low (see the numbers in the Cost column). Also, they haven’t generated
enough clicks during this time period to yield statistically significant results
(see Chapter 13 for a discussion of split testing and statistical significance).

Chapter 14: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking

Tracking ROI of Ads and Keywords
The information at the level of campaigns and ad groups is nice, but not par-
ticularly useful. Where conversion tracking becomes a powerful driver of
action is at the levels of specific ads and keywords.
Identifying the profitable ads
After you have conversion tracking in place, you can compare two ads com-
peting in the same ad group, not just to see which one attracts more clicks,
but which one attracts more qualified clicks. The method I outline works
both with text ads purchased on a CPC basis and image ads bought on a cost-
per-thousand-impressions basis, because you will reduce all the data to a
single number: profit per thousand impressions.
I began this chapter with a hypothetical example of two ads with CTRs of
1.00% and 0.77%, respectively. Without conversion tracking, you would
declare the 1.00% ad the winner and start testing a new ad. As you can see in
Figure 14-7, you could be making a big mistake.
The conversion in this case was an opt-in, to receive two free chapters of the
Leads into Gold home-study course. The first ad, the one with the “better”
CTR, converted fewer than 1 in 10 visitors to leads. The second ad, while
attracting fewer clicks, converted 1 out of 3 visitors to leads. You can see the
difference in dollars and cents when you compare the two ads’ cost per con-
version metrics. Each lead cost me $9.19 when the first ad was shown, com-
pared to only $2.38 when the lead saw the second ad.
Why is the second ad so much more effective at delivering qualified
prospects? Look at the call to action in the second description line: “Free
report and 2 chapter download.” Visitors are enticed by the promise of a two-
chapter download; the real question isn’t why so many of them converted,
but why so many more didn’t opt in to download the two chapters.
Figure 14-7:
The lower-
CTR ad is
almost four
times more
profitable
than the

CTR ad.
316
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

Higher CTR often means lower site conversions
Lest you think the previous example was a fluke, I’m going to draw back the
curtain a little more on my AdWords campaign. Figure 14-8 shows a second
set of ads, almost identical in language, in which the same inverse relation-
ship exists between CTR and site conversion.
Why should the word effective improve my site conversion from 10.5 to 14%
compared to the word powerful? I can’t know for sure, but my guess is that
powerful is a more attractive word and therefore casts a wider net than effec-
tive, while effective attracts more of the serious business owners who are pre-
disposed to take the time to study my Web site and accept my offer.
Please take the moral of this story to heart: CTR is usually far less important
than the cost per conversion. But until you set up conversion tracking, you’re
like the guy in the joke (for some reason, it’s always a guy in the joke) who’s
looking for his keys under the street lamp, even though he lost them in the
dark on the other side of the street. When asked why he’s looking in the
wrong place, he answers, “Because the light’s better here.” As business
strategist Peter Senge reminds us, “We can’t expect what we don’t inspect.” If
you want higher CTRs, you can get them without paying attention to conver-
sion. But if you want higher profits, you must inspect your site conversion
data.
Balancing CTR and cost per conversion
CTR still matters. It’s related to profitability, because of Google’s bid price
formula: The higher the CTR, the lower the CPC. Also, you might run an ad
with a miserable CTR that nevertheless converts at a high level. But because
it sends so little traffic to your site, the high conversion rate contributes little
to your bottom line.
You can balance an ad’s CTR and cost per conversion by calculating a metric
based on initial input and ultimate output: How much are 1000 impressions
worth to you? Table 14-2 presents an example.

Which ad do you keep? If you look solely at CTR, it’s easy: Ad #1 is the clear
winner. But now that you’ve added conversion tracking, you can compare the
ads’ respective cost per conversion. By that measure, Ad #3 is the winner,
generating a conversion for $1.67, compared to the Ad #2’s cost per conver-
sion of $3.70 and Ad #1’s bloated $4.17.
The trouble with Ad #3 is the tiny amount of traffic it generates. What you
really want to know is which ad makes the most money? To calculate profit
per ad, you need two more numbers: total number of conversions and value
of a conversion.
Calculating the total number of conversions is easy: just multiply number of
clicks by the conversion rate and divide by 100. Ad #1’s total conversion is
300 × 12 ÷ 100 = 36.
The value of a conversion answers the question, how much is one of that
action worth to your business? If you’re tracking hard sales data, Google can
give you this information in the Reports section (see the “Creating Easy-to-
Understand Reports” section, later in this chapter). If you’re tracking
throughput data such as leads or page views, you may need to estimate the
value of a conversion to your business. In this example, let’s assume that a
conversion is a $45 sale, of which you get to keep $40 after cost of goods and
processing fees. Now you can redo Table 14-2 as shown in Table 14-3.

When you deposit your check in the bank, it doesn’t give you extra money for
having a high CTR or a low cost per conversion. When split-testing ads within
a single ad group, the most important number is the amount of money you
make per thousand impressions, after paying for your clicks.
The preceding example reflects a situation where your first sale is your only
sale. If you make the lion’s share of your profits from back end sales (meaning
sales after the first one), if those sales occur online, you can still use the aver-
age cost per impression metric to choose a winner. If you can’t track the
lucrative back end sales through Google, you may just want to treat your
AdWords campaigns as pure lead generation: whichever ad produces the
most leads (in the case just cited, Ad #1) is the winner.
Keywords
You can also track ROI for each keyword in your Google search, and search
partners’ campaigns. Armed with this information, you can tighten your ad
groups, lower or raise your bids on individual keywords to improve ROI or
increase traffic for profitable keywords, and pause or delete keywords that
cost more than they make.
Figure 14-9 shows an ad group for Leads into Gold. The overall cost per conver-
sion for this ad group is $23.80, far too high to be profitable. Let’s say that my
break-even is $18.00 per conversion. All the keywords whose cost per conver-
sion is greater than $18.00, or at $0.00, are current money losers. They include
cold calls at a whopping $75.70 per conversion, all the way down to cold
calling techniques at an almost-acceptable $19.94. The keywords with
cost per conversion between $17.15 and $4.73 are all fine, but the one below
those are generating no conversions at all, just costing me Google clicks.
The keyword-conversion data can be fed back into campaign management
(see Chapters 7 and 8) to continually lower your costs and increase your
profits.
Dealing with multiple conversions
The trouble with the Leads into Gold example we examined in Figure 14-9 is
that I’m actually tracking more than one conversion at a time. I have the
tracking code on the page following an opt-in, as well as on the pages follow-
ing the sales of the three editions of the product: $247, $337, and $489. The
campaign-management console adds all the conversions together, and 
doesn’t distinguish between an opt-in and a $489 sale. Obviously, sales are
more interesting to me than opt-ins, as I can go to a grocery store and buy
food when a sale happens.
319
Chapter 14: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking

When you run multiple conversions (and you should, if you have more than
one desired outcome on your Web site), you can’t rely solely on the conver-
sion data presented in two columns in the campaign-management tab. No,
grasshopper, you now need to enter the Wonderful World of Conversion
Reports.
Creating Easy-to-Understand Reports
Google allows you to create reports that distinguish between leads, signups,
page views, and sales. You can see which ads and keywords are making you
money, and exactly how much. You can identify the keywords that are doing
their job — that is, generating more money than they cost. And you can auto-
mate the reporting to receive exactly the numbers you need in your inbox on
a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
To create a report, follow these steps:
1. From within your AdWords account, click the Reports tab.
2. Click the Create a Report Now link in the center of the page to create
your first report, as shown in Figure 14-10.
If you’ve already run reports, you’ll see a list of the last five reports that
have run, as well as any saved report templates at the bottom of the
page.

Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

Types of reports
Google enables you to choose from several different types of reports, 
including:
 Keyword Performance: This report tells you how each keyword is
doing. As we saw earlier in this chapter, the two conversion columns in
the campaign-management console mushed all the conversions together
into one undifferentiated pile. In a report, you can separate out multiple
conversions and assign a monetary value to each one.
 Ad Performance: This type of report lets you know which ad in a split
test is the most profitable, based on ROI and total profit. Depending on
your Web site’s sales process, you may place more value on generating
leads or on sales numbers; you can configure reports that give you
exactly the numbers you need in order to make profitable decisions.
 URL Performance: This report evaluates your destination URLs. You can
split-test landing pages this way, but it’s messy. You’re better off using a
third-party tool (see Chapter 13 for the details of split-testing) to test
landing pages; you can swap pages in and out in one place, rather than
in the destination URLs of perhaps dozens of different ads.
 Ad Group, Campaign, and Account Performance: These three report
types (Ad Group, Campaign, and Account Performance) are useful
mostly for their ability to show you hourly results. You can find out what
time of day you receive the most impressions, the highest CTR, the most
clicks, and the highest and lowest CPC. This information can help you
schedule ads so they don’t show at certain unfavorable times of day.

Chapter 14: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking

Settings
Your settings choices change depending on the report type. Basically, you
have to make three choices:
 View (unit of time): How do you want the data chunked by time? You 
can view a summary of all the data; or look at individual years, quarters,
months, weeks, or days. Some of the reports allow you to look at the data
on an hourly basis. Hourly (by date) shows each individual hour. Hourly
(regardless of date) combines the data to show the average hourly activ-
ity — that is, over the entire date range you’re looking at, how does your
traffic at 3:00 a.m. differ from traffic at 10:00 a.m. or 3:00 p.m.?
 Date range: Over what time period do you want to examine the data? You
can choose a default time frame from the drop-down menu, or specify an
exact range. Depending on your traffic, you want to choose a time period
that can give you statistically significant results. In other words, if you
receive only 100 impressions a day, it doesn’t make sense to view one day
at a time. Instead, choose a period that allows trends to emerge — say, a
week or a month.
 Campaigns and ad groups: You can choose to show every ad group in
every campaign, or look at select ad groups. I like to choose a single ad
group per report, so I can focus on just the relevant data that can help
me make decisions. As you’ll see, the amount of data you can generate
with reports is staggering. The art of running reports is not to generate
as much data as possible, but as little as allows you to take intelligent
action. When you choose to manually select campaigns and ad groups
from a list, a drop-down list of campaigns will appear. You can add the
campaign directly, or click a campaign name to view its ad groups,
which you then can add individually.
Advanced settings
Configure the advanced settings to create truly useful reports:
 Add or Remove Columns: You can select the data to appear in your
report. Depending on report type, you may have half a dozen options, or
as many as 50. See the upcoming section, “Customizing Your Reports to
Show the Most Important Numbers,” for suggestions on which columns
to display and which to ignore.
 Filter Your Results: You can limit the scope of the report by showing
keywords, or ads, or ad groups, or campaigns that match any of a
number of search criteria, as shown in Figure 14-11. Here are just two
examples:
322
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

• You can choose to display only active ads in active ad groups in
active campaigns.
• You can look at content targeted campaigns only, or keywords
whose average CPC is (say) greater than $3.25.
If you find yourself overwhelmed by gigantic report spreadsheets, spend
some time looking at filters to see whether any of them will reduce com-
plexity while retaining the key information.
Templates, scheduling, and e-mail
You don’t have to go through the whole report-creation process every time.
You can save reports as templates and schedule them to run automatically
on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. I like to schedule reports to run weekly
that show me activity for the previous 30 days. I can print them out, study
them, and archive them in a binder to understand trends and compare
results from one month to the next.
I create new reports to answer questions, test hypotheses, and explore my
campaigns from different angles. When I find a new report to be valuable, I
schedule it to run on a weekly or monthly basis. My accounts don’t justify
daily reports, but if you get a lot of traffic on a daily basis, you may want to
devote 10 minutes a day to glancing at the day’s reports. In general, you want
to spend more time monitoring new campaigns than mature ones.
Create a report as a template to save yourself the time and effort of making
the same choices over and over again for different reports. You can create a
template with specific columns and filters, and just change the ad group,
instead of creating each new ad group report from scratch.
You can view reports in HTML format from the Report Center, and/or down-
load them in several formats. I like the HTML view for sorting by different
columns, just like the campaign-management interface; I like the .csv Excel
format for printing and performing additional calculations.

Chapter 14: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking

Customizing Your Reports to Show 
the Most Important Numbers
Some numbers matter more to your business than others. Let’s explore 
customizing the columns for the Keyword Performance and Ad Performance
reports.
Customizing Keyword Performance reports
Your column choices for keyword reports are shown in Figure 14-12.
Basically, your goal is to remove as many columns as you possibly can and
still get the information you need. So before you choose columns, get clear
on what are the important questions you want a report to answer:
 If you have an e-commerce Web site, your most important keyword ques-
tion will likely be, “Which keywords are making money and which are
losing money?”
 If the primary purpose of your site is lead generation, you want to know
how much each lead costs you.
 If you are generating traffic for clients, you are probably most interested
in page views.
Sometimes you want to see a bunch of statistics next to each other. I often am
interested in leads versus sales for particular keywords, so I’ll select leads
count, sales count, and sales value. I may discover that a certain keyword
Figure 14-12:
You can
choose from
dozens of
columns 
to create
keyword
performance
reports.
324
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

attracts a disproportionate number of buyers, even though it doesn’t compel
more opt-in conversions.
For example, in Figure 14-9 earlier in this chapter, we saw that most of the
keywords in the ad group weren’t generating positive ROI, based on the aver-
age value of a conversion. The keyword cold calls was the top offender at
over $75 per conversion. The problem with this data is that I can’t distinguish
between an opt-in and a sale. When I run a keyword-performance report —
choosing the conversion metrics of cost per conversion, value per click, sales
count, and sales value (shown in Figure 14-13) — I discover a much more
nuanced and useful picture.
The keyword cold calls turns out to be my best, not worst, keyword. I pay
an average of $0.86 per click and make an average of $2.18 from each click.
None of the other keywords led to sales at all.
The bottom-line number for keywords is value per click, also known as visitor
value. This number answers the question, “How much money is a visitor to
my Web site worth to me, on average?” You should know this number for
each of your sales channels. When you know your visitor value, you know
exactly how much you can spend on advertising. The higher your visitor
value, the more you can afford to pay for traffic. And when you discover that
a promotion produces less or more revenue than you would expect given
your averages, you can decide whether it’s worth repeating.

Chapter 14: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking

Perry Marshall often talks about the Unlimited Traffic Technique: Start with
AdWords, but don’t end there. Use AdWords to improve your sales process —
meaning, to increase your visitor value. Once your visitor value is high
enough, you can buy all the traffic you want. You can hire search engine opti-
mization consultants to boost your organic rankings. You can advertise your
site on other Web sites, on the radio, in magazines, wherever — because you
know exactly how much a visitor is worth to you.
Customizing Ad Performance reports
Your Ad Performance reports should answer the primary question, “Within
each ad group, which is the best ad?” In an e-commerce situation, this means
the ad that puts the most money into your bank account per impression. As
of this writing, Google does not include a Value/Impression column in its
reports, so you need to figure this out manually or add a column in a spread-
sheet. Figure 14-14 shows my recommended selections for an e-commerce ad
performance report. I eliminate as many details as possible so I can see all
the numbers on one page.

Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

In Figure 14-15, you can see the results of the choices I made in Figure 14-14.
Some columns are mandatory in the report, such as Ad ID and Destination
URL, but I can easily remove them in Excel because they don’t help me. I can
also move columns around in Excel, putting related numbers next to each
other. Most important, I can create additional columns that give me the num-
bers I really need.
In this case, I created a new column (in bold) called Value/Impression*100,
which is how much every impression is worth to me, multiplied by 100 so I
can make better sense of the data. The absolute number is less important
than the comparison of the ads that I’m testing. In rows 13 and 14, the two
ads in question are identical, except for the end of the Display URL: the one
with VitalHealthInstitute.com/BeatGout is almost twice as profitable
as the one with the URL VitalHealthInstitute.com on its own: $0.63
versus $0.32.
Rows 15 and 16 feature two ads, identical except for quotes around “Gout
Cure” in one. The ad without quotes is almost three times more profitable
than its competitor, $0.35 versus $0.12. Rows 17 and 18 show again that
adding a subdomain to the main Display URL has increased profits, $0.24
versus $0.14.
You can create a Value/Impression*1000 Column in Excel by dividing the
sales value by the number of impressions, and multiplying by 1000. Go to
www.askhowie.com/valueimp for a video tutorial on creating the
Value/Impression*1000 column in Excel.

Chapter 14: Slashing Your Costs with Conversion Tracking

Discovering What to Do with the Data
Before taking action based on the data, make sure the data is accurate.
Google is usually not the culprit when data is faulty; instead, you most likely
made an error in placing the code on your Web pages. If you’re measuring
opt-ins and sales, it won’t take long to verify the data. Count the number of
leads Google says you’ve acquired over a given period of time, and compare
it to the number of opt-ins to your autoresponder or newsletter list for the
same date range. If the two numbers are fairly close, you can be confident
that you’re reading useful data. (Expect the numbers to be slightly off to
account for time delays between initial click and conversion.) Similarly, com-
pare the sales count and sales value for an e-commerce site with the actual
sales data from your shopping cart or merchant account. Again, they should
be close, not necessarily identical.
Use the report data to split-test your ads — not on CTR, but on profitability
(refer to Figure 14-15). As a rule of thumb, wait until each ad has generated at
least 30 clicks before declaring a winner to make sure your results are statisti-
cally significant and not just a fluke occurrence.
You’re looking for keywords that aren’t paying for themselves, or aren’t as
profitable as they could be. When you find these keywords, you can adjust
your bid price (and average position) to reflect their value, you can move
them into a different ad group and match them to a different landing page
(see Chapter 8), or you can pause or delete them to stop the bleeding.
If you find a keyword that costs $0.35 per click and has a value per click of
$0.27, you’re losing 8 cents every time someone clicks your ad. Before delet-
ing the keyword, lower your Maximum CPC to $0.26. You may find your visi-
tor value increasing because lower positions tend to generate higher-quality
clicks. Worst case, you’re slightly better than break-even for the keyword.
If your break-even bid doesn’t generate enough traffic because it puts you on
page 9 of search results, or is below Google’s minimum bid, then you can try
moving the keyword to a different ad group and matching it more closely to
the ad and the landing page. Sometimes getting the keyword quality score to
Great is all you need to do.
The goal of keyword bid management is to maximize profits per keyword.
Test your high traffic keywords in different positions. Pay for position 1 for a
week, and then drop it to position 7 for another week. Tally your sales and
costs: Which position is more profitable? Over time, you’ll find the sweet spot
for each keyword. Obviously, if your campaigns contain thousands of key-
words, you’ll want to focus on the top traffic keywords.

I
n Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping (Texere Publishing), Paco
Underhill share the insights gleaned from 20 years of his study of the 
science of shopping. Some of these include
 Putting shopping baskets all over bookstores.
 Making the women’s clothing aisles wide to avoid the irritation of 
“butt-brush.”
 Putting fitting rooms next to the men’s clothing section since men buy
mostly on the basis of fit, while women consider many other factors.
These findings may seem like common sense to you, but I wouldn’t have
come up with them in a hundred years. And neither did the giants of retail
until they hired Underhill to study shopper behavior and redesign their
stores. Underhill’s company Web site, www.envirosell.com, describes the
methodology for a typical engagement:
Twelve Staples stores were studied in different markets across the country
for two days each.
• Shoppers were observed throughout their visit by in-store observers.
• Video, focused in different areas of the store, recorded shopping 
patterns for eight hours each research day.

• Shoppers were intercepted and interviewed after they completed their
shopping visit.
• A manager and an associate from each store were interviewed by
researchers to gather their insights on the store.
I bring this up to explain how incredibly lucky you are as a Web site propri-
etor to not to have to go through this to improve the effectiveness of your
site. You can observe your customers without hiring armies of consultants,
without intercepting them for interviews, and without watching hours of
video. All you have to do, in fact, is install Google Analytics tracking code on
your site and you’ll be able to evaluate and redesign your online store with
greater accuracy, less risk, and greater speed than you could ever manage
offline.
You can view — in minute detail — the parts of your site that frustrate or
detour your visitors. You can compare this month to last month. You can
define goals and funnels and watch your visitors convert or bail at every
point on the navigation path. You can identify pages that don’t work, and
replace them in minutes. And you can automatically connect all this data to
your AdWords cost-and-conversion data to segment your traffic by keyword
(and other characteristics).
In this chapter, I draw heavily on the expertise generously provided by
Timothy Seward of ROI Revolution, online at www.roirevolution.com.
(Especially since Google completely overhauled Analytics three weeks before
my book deadline — thanks, Sergey and Larry!) Including even one-tenth of
what Timothy has taught me would have turned this book into a medicine
ball, so I’m limiting the information on Analytics in two ways:
 I just show you how to track AdWords traffic. You can configure
Analytics to tell you cool stuff about all your visitors; in fact, it will tell
you all about organic search-engine traffic by default. I’m going to ignore
all that and let you explore it on your own. (Once you understand how
Analytics deals with AdWords traffic, the rest isn’t hard.)
 I don’t get into complicated installations, including integration with 
e-commerce shopping carts or the tracking of downloads or outbound
links. If you are (or know) someone who’s a code jockey or has years of
IT experience, feel free to play with these settings. Otherwise, start
simply — and hire an Analytics expert when you’re ready for advanced
tracking.
Instead, I show you how to install and configure Analytics to get clean and
actionable data. I introduce you to some very powerful data screens, and
show you how to set up experiments and answer interesting questions with
these data. Once you have the data, you discover what to do with it to get
more leads and sales.
330
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

Installing Analytics on Your Web site
The Google Analytics installation process consists of three steps:
1. Creating and configuring an Analytics account
2. Adding tracking code to your Web pages
3. Creating filters to keep your data clean and useful
Creating an Analytics account
Within your AdWords account, click the Analytics tab. Click the Continue
button to enter Web site information for your first profile (each Web site
requires its own profile), as shown in Figure 15-1. You can create multiple pro-
files, but for right now let’s keep it simple.
Enter the Web site URL, and give this account a name. Very important: Make
sure the check boxes are checked next to Destination URL Auto-tagging and
Apply Cost Data. Auto-tagging adds information about which keywords your
visitors typed and which ads they clicked to arrive at your site.
Google warns that a small percentage of Web sites can’t handle Auto-tagging. If
you start getting errors when you click your ads, turn off Auto-tagging and tell
the following to your Webmaster: “Please configure my site to allow arbitrary
URL parameters.” When your Webmaster has done this, turn Auto-tagging
back on.
Figure 15-1:
Make sure
the two
check
boxes are
checked 
so your

data is
included.
331
Chapter 15: Making More Sales with Google Analytics

Checking the Apply Cost Data check box connects AdWords bid costs to your
Analytics data, so you can calculate the costs and values of various Web site
conversions.
On the next page, read the epic novel titled Google Analytics Terms of Service —
and if you agree with each and every provision, check the agreement box at the
bottom and click the Create New Account button to get started.
Adding tracking code to your Web pages
On the next page, you’ll see a text block containing the Analytics tracking
code. Click inside that box to select the whole thing, then copy it and paste it
into every page on your Web site that you are planning to track. The code
goes just above the </body> tag, near or at the bottom of the source code
for each page. Your source code may end something like this:
<script src=”http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js”
type=”text/javascript”>
</script>
<script type=”text/javascript”>
_uacct = “UA-1234567-1”;
urchinTracker();
</script>
</body>
</html>
Don’t copy my code! No ethical objections, just practicality: Each account
comes with a unique number, which follows the UA- prefix in the code.
If your Web site is built on a template, you can add this code just once and it
will automatically be added to every page. If you don’t know what I’m talking
about, just e-mail the code to your Webmaster and tell him or her, “Place this
code just above the </body> (close-body) tag on every page of my site.”
When you click Continue, Google prompts you to check the status of your
tracking code. Unless you’ve added it already, when you check you’ll get a
message telling you that the tracking code has not been detected on your
home page (as shown in Figure 15-2). The pink warning box will remain at the
top of your Analytics control panel until it’s satisfied that you’ve added the
code correctly.
Be cautious about installing the Analytics tracking code yourself if any of the
following conditions exist:
 You want to track visitors across more than one domain (for example,
http://unicyclesforkids.com and http://whoneedstwo
wheels.com).
332
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

 Your site includes subdomains (such as http://stunt.unicycles
forkids.com and http://distance.unicyclesforkids.com).
 You want to track visitors on a secure server (such as https://
unicyclesforkids.com).
 You want to track file downloads (PDFs or MP3s, for example).
 You have a third-party shopping cart or an e-commerce site.
 Your visitors can pay you with PayPal or Google Checkout.
 Your site uses frames (if you’re not sure, ask your Webmaster).
 Your site generates pages dynamically but the URL remains static 
(if you’re not sure, gently let go of your mouse and move away from 
the computer).
Check out Michael Harrison’s cautionary blog post at www.roirevolution.

generated junk data long after the error was corrected.
If you want to add more Web sites to your Analytics account, click the + Add
Web Site Profile link and repeat the process.
Configuring Analytics
While you’re waiting for tracking validation, you can configure your Analytics
account to allow other users full or restricted access, and to eliminate junk
data. From the Analytics home page, choose the profile you want to configure
and click Edit. From this page, you can edit your profile information, create
conversion goals and funnels, apply filters, and manage additional users.

333
Chapter 15: Making More Sales with Google Analytics

Adding users
You may want to give other people full or restricted access to your Analytics
account and data. You can add more users and specify their rights to change
and view the account. For example, you can give your Webmaster access to
Webmaster reports only, and you can allow an assistant to view data but not
change the account configuration.
Add users by clicking the Access Manager link near the bottom of the
Analytics control panel (refer to Figure 15-2). Click Add User at the top right,
enter their e-mail and name, and choose an access type: View Reports Only,
or Account Administrator. See Figure 15-3. If you’ve selected View Reports
Only, select the profile(s) you want the user to see, and then click Finish.
You can configure limited access to reports by creating a new profile that’s a
copy of your main one. Click + Add Web site Profile in the Analytics Control
Panel and select Add a Profile for an Existing Domain. Enter a name the new
profile (for example, enter My Web site - Raphael if Raphael is the user who
will have limited access to reports), and click Finish. You should see an addi-
tional profile in your list.
Click Edit to select the reports that the user can see. Scroll down to Available
Reports, and uncheck the reports to exclude. Later in this chapter, I intro-
duce you to some of the reports, charts, and graphs, so you can make
informed decisions about user access.

Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

Choosing a default page
Every Web site has a default page, defined as the page your Web server
shows to visitors who enter your Web site name only. For example, someone
typing www.askhowie.com is automatically redirected to the page http://
askhowie.com/index.php. In this case, index.php is the default page. If
you aren’t sure of the name of your default page, ask your Webmaster.
If you don’t tell Analytics your default page, then views of your root domain
(www.askhowie.com) will be counted separately from default page views
(www.askhowie.com/index.php), even though these two pages are actu-
ally the same.
From the Profile Settings page, click Edit to configure the Main Web Site
Profile Information. Enter your Web site’s default page, not including the root
domain. You will enter something like this:
index.html
index.htm
index.php
Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page when you’re done.
Filtering out internal traffic
A Jewish folk tale from the mythical town of Chelm tells of when Schlemiel
and his wife opened a lemonade stand on the outskirts of the town market.
Early in the day, one customer bought a glass for 25 cents. After that, nobody
bought. Finally, Schlemiel picked up the 25-cent coin and gave it to his wife,
requested a glass of lemonade. Shortly thereafter, Mrs. Schlemiel returned
the coin to her husband in exchange for a glass. So they went back and forth
the rest of the day, until the entire supply of lemonade was gone. They cele-
brated their good fortune at having sold out their stock, but couldn’t figure
out where all the money had gone, and why they had only 25 cents to show
for their efforts.
You may laugh, but if you don’t create a filter to exclude internal traffic to
your site, you’re making the same mistake. Internal traffic refers to visits to
the site by insiders — you, your Webmaster, your colleagues. You don’t want
these visits to contaminate the important data: the visits by prospects and
customers.
A filter to exclude internal traffic is pretty simple to set up:
1. From the Analytic’s Profile Settings page, scroll down to the Filters
section and click + Add Filter.
2. Select Add New Filter for Profile.
3. In the Filter Name text box, enter Internal traffic.
335
Chapter 15: Making More Sales with Google Analytics

4. From the Filter Type drop-down menu, select Exclude All Traffic from
an IP Address.
Google fills in the next field with 63\.212\.171\.12 (shown in 
Figure 15-4).
5. Replace the numbers with your own IP address and the addresses of
anyone else you consider internal traffic.
Each computer has its own IP address, so if you work at multiple com-
puters, you’ll want to filter them all. You can find your IP address at
www.whatismyip.com. It consists of four blocks of numbers, separated
by periods.
If your IP address is 12.34.56.78, for example, you enter the following
into Analytics:
12\.34\.56\.78
The \ character is called a backslash, located just above the Return or
Enter key on most keyboards.
When you’ve created filters for all internal users, you can apply those 
filters to all Analytics profiles (see the next step).
6. Select Apply Existing Filter to Profile and you can choose from a list
of filters to apply to that profile.
Analytics allows you to create many different kinds of filters. You can find a
list if you select Custom Filter from the Filter Type drown-down menu. For
now, don’t worry about adding more filters. When you start receiving data,
you’ll quickly see pages that are unnecessarily segmented by Analytics, and
you can create filters to correct the problems.

For more information about how to configure filters and how to determine
that you need them, check out www.roirevolution.com/filters on the
ROI Revolution blog.
Configuring goals and funnels
A goal refers to something you want your Web site visitors to do — such as
fill out a form, buy something, visit a particular page, download a file, and so
on. Except for file downloads and clicks on links to other Web sites, you con-
figure a goal by identifying the page your visitor goes to after completing the
conversion.
If the goal is an opt-in to your newsletter, the Goal page is the thank-you page
visitors arrive at after completing the opt-in form. For a goal page to work,
two things must be true: The only way someone ends up on that page is by
doing what you want them to do, and everyone who takes that action ends
up on that page.
Creating a goal
Next to the first goal, labeled G1, click the Edit link. On the next page (shown
in Figure 15-5), enter the Goal URL, name, and make sure the goal is active.
Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the Save Changes button. If you’d
like to define a navigation funnel for that goal (an optional step), see the fol-
lowing section for details.
Defining a funnel
Google defines a funnel as “a series of pages leading up to the Goal URL.”
Sometimes you won’t be able to define a funnel. Your visitors may choose
their own path to a particular goal, or there may be many equally plausible
paths to the same goal.
If the goal is a purchase, you can usually identify several required steps that
must occur in order. Shawn Purtell of www.roirevolution.com offers the
hypothetical example for an online cheese shop in Figure 15-5.
If you’re not sure of the path, set up your best guess as a funnel. Even if
you’re completely wrong, you’ll see graphically how visitor behavior on your
site deviates from the ideal.
Determining a goal value
If your goal is an ecommerce goal, a configuration beyond the scope of this
book, leave the value blank or at $0.00. If the goal is a lead, a page view, or a
download, you can estimate the value of that goal and input it in the Additional
Settings section. For example, say you generated $24,000 in income last month
337
Chapter 15: Making More Sales with Google Analytics

from 750 leads. Each lead is worth, on average, $32 ($24,000 ÷ 750 = $32). You
can set the value of that goal at 32.00 (making sure to omit any currency sign),
and then save your changes by clicking the Save Changes button.

E-commerce setup
If your Web site includes an e-commerce shopping cart, you definitely want to
get it hooked up to Analytics. You’ll discover which keywords are making you
money and which are not. You’ll find the optimal path for your AdWords visi-
tors, from keyword through ad through landing page all the way through your
site.
Unfortunately, there are simply too many variables for me to explain how to
do it: brand of shopping cart, Web server, and so on. If you think you can con-
figure it yourself, you can learn a lot from Google’s tutorials at www.google.
com/support/analytics. If you’re looking for a consulting company to set
up your Analytics correctly, you can choose with confidence from Google’s
own list of accredited Analytics partners, located at www.google.com/
analytics/support_partner_provided.html. Google vouches for 
all 10 (the current number of North American partners); I can’t speak highly
enough about the talents of my Analytics advisor, Timothy Seward of ROI
Revolution. Visit www.roirevolution.com to sign up for their free Webinar,
get their newsletter, or pick up tips on their blog.
Actually, the fact that e-commerce Analytics is so complicated is a good 
thing — the harder something is, the bigger your competitive advantage
when you implement. Analytics can provide you with black-belt skills in a
white-belt world.
Making Sense of the Data
Analytics allows you to track much more than AdWords traffic, but if I got
into the entire range of Analytics’ capabilities, this book could double as
Weightlifting For Dummies. I’m going to limit this section to AdWords only, and
ignore organic search traffic, banner ads, newsletters, offline promotions, and
direct entries. But once you’ve mastered the AdWords part of Analytics, you
will definitely want to explore the whole range of possibilities.
Checking for data integrity
Before studying your Analytics data, compare the number of clicks between
AdWords and Analytics to see if your Analytics profile is working properly. I
once placed Analytics code on a redirect page and the actual landing page by
mistake — and got reports of twice as many visitors as I actually received.
Comparing the clicks in your AdWords control panel and your Analytics
tables can tell you if there’s a problem, but not what that problem is.
339
Chapter 15: Making More Sales with Google Analytics

Shawn Purtell of ROI Revolution cautions that the numbers should be close,
but probably won’t be identical. Analytics and conversion tracking handle
repeat visitors differently, and if a visitor clicks today and converts in a week
or a month, the data in the two systems will log those events in different time
frames. As long as the data are basically telling the same story, you’re okay.
Viewing your data in the Dashboard
Once your tracking is correctly set up and verified, it’s time to start amassing
insights on your visitors’ behavior. From the Analytics tab in your AdWords
account, click the View Reports link for the profile you want to examine.
You’ll begin with the Dashboard, which you can customize by adding views
that you’ll want to see a lot.
The Dashboard consists of, as you might expect, the just-the-facts graphs and
charts that give you a quick picture of how your Web site is doing, as shown
in Figure 15-6. It includes a graph of visits by day, as well as more in-depth
information about those visits.
Visits-by-day graph
You can play with the visits-by-day graph, which by default shows you the
last 30 days of data, by clicking the arrow to the right of the second date. You
can change the date range by length and start date, either by clicking a date
or several in the Calendar view, or (much easier and more elegantly), select-
ing the Timeline tab above the calendar. Click your cursor inside the box and
hold your mouse down to drag it backward or forward, or click and select
either edge to expand or contract the date range.
Below the Date Range boxes is a check box labeled Compare to Past. Check
that box to superimpose a previous date range over the current one. For
example, you can quickly compare your Web traffic in May and March.
Figure 15-6:
The

340
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

Analytics will automatically generate a range of the same number of days as
the current one.
Many other screens also feature a top graph similar to the visits-by-day
graph, and you can manipulate them all the same way — by changing starting
and ending points, and by comparing two time periods.
Playing with Analytics is really simple, once you’ve seen it done. Head over to
http://askhowie.com/dates for a series of short video tutorials that will
have you playing with your data in no time.
Site Usage statistics
The Dashboard shows you important data about how often your site is 
visited in the Site Usage section. The Site Usage section provides the follow-
ing data:
 Visits, Pageviews, and Pages/Visit: For a given period, how many visi-
tors came to your Web site, and how many pages did they all look at? In
Figure 15-6, 118 visitors were served a total of 173 pages over the week,
for an average of 1.47 pages per visitor.
 Avg. Time on Site: How long did the average visitor hang around before
leaving your Web site? Figure 15-6 shows a rather pathetic time of one
minute, 56 seconds.
 Bounce Rate: Google defines a bounce as a single-page visit. If people
leave your landing page without going deeper into your site or opting in
to a list, your landing page isn’t doing its job. Figure 15-6 shows a
bounce rate of 63.56%, which means that the majority of visitors to this
site are indifferent to the landing page, and I’ll probably never get the
chance to do business with them.
 % New Visits: What percentage of your visitors have never been to 
your site before? (Remember, Analytics tracks computers, not people.)
Figure 15-6 shows 45.76% of the visitors are new to your site.
Visitors Overview graph
The Visitors Overview graph shows you the number of unique visitors, rather
than the number of visitors. If Sean from Toronto comes to your site on
Sunday, Tuesday, and the following Saturday, that counts as three visits, but
only one visitor (assuming, of course, that he used the same computer all
three times).
The Visitors Overview and following sections can all be removed from the
dashboard by clicking the small X in the right-hand corner of the header.
341
Chapter 15: Making More Sales with Google Analytics

Map Overlay
A world map shows you at a glance where in the world your visitors live. The
darker the shading, the more visits from that location. Click on a land mass to
zoom in to a continent. Keep clicking to go deeper, into countries,
states/provinces/regions, and cities.
Traffic Sources Overview
This graph shows you the comparative traffic production of direct visitors
(those who type your URL directly into their browser), search engine traffic
by engine, and other referring Web sites. Click the small View Report link for
a detailed breakdown of which search engines and referring sites. Note that
Analytics distinguishes between paid search (cpc) and organic for Google,
Yahoo, and MSN.
Content Overview
You can see the five most viewed pages on your site, based on the number of
pageviews (how many times visitors saw that page). The % Pageviews column
shows what percent of all the pageviews on your site were generated by that
particular page.
Goals Overview
The Goals Overview gives you a quick look at the number of visitors complet-
ing your defined goals.
The AdWords Campaign screen
In the Dashboard, you can see the number and percentage of visits generated
by each AdWords campaign. Click the View Report link to go deeper into the
AdWords reporting, the part of Analytics I describe in the rest of this chapter.
In addition to a link off the Dashboard, you can access this screen directly
from the left navigation by clicking Traffic Sources, then AdWords, and finally
AdWords Campaigns.
The top chart, as usual, shows visits over time. Below, a table segments your
traffic by campaign and shows the number of visits, pages/visit, average time
on your site, percentage of new visits, and bounce rate for each campaign.
Click a campaign name to get the same information on the ad group level, and
click an ad group to see the same data for each individual keyword. Figure 15-7
shows how Analytics drills down into the French campaign (which cost a total
of $74,544.64) to the Brie ad group (accounting for $40,164.41, or 53.88% of the
total) and even deeper to the individual keyword brie (which cost $1718.42,
or 2.31% of the advertising spending for the entire campaign).

If the traffic comes from the content network, it’s labeled (content targeting),
and appears at the top of the keyword list. You can search for specific key-
words using the search box below the keyword list.
Clicking on an individual keyword brings up actionable data in three tabs:
 Site Usage tab: How visitors from that keyword behaved on your site:
average time on site, bounce rate, pages/visit, and percentage of new
visits. Interesting, to be sure, but the next two tabs will really blow your
mind (if you’re into that sort of thing).
 Goal Conversion tab: How visitors from that keyword converted to each
of your defined goals, and the goal value per visit (that is, how much the
average customer who types that keyword is worth to you). Armed with
this information, you can set your AdWords bids so that no keyword is
costing you more than you’re making back on your site.
 Clicks tab: The monetary value of a click generated by that keyword:
including total number of clicks, value of each click (RPC — Revenue-
Per-Click, the average revenue you received for each click based on
ecommerce sales and the value you assigned to your goals), your profit
(or loss) margin, and the overall ROI of that keyword.

Ad content segmenting
Choose Ad Content from the Segment drop-down list to see the same data,
this time by individual ad. (You can find the Segment drop-down list above
the Site Usage, Goal Conversion, and Clicks tabs.) Only the headlines are
shown, so if you’re running different ads with identical headlines, you’re not
going to find this particular view very useful.
Views
To the right of the Site Usage, Goal Conversion, and Clicks tabs, you’ll find
five views to choose from. From left to right, they are Table, Pie Chart,
Horizontal Bar Graph, Comparison Against Site Average, and Mini-histogram
(that’s a line chart, not a medical test).
Showing you all the views here would fill up another book. Check out www.
roirevolution.com/graphs for a more in-depth discussion of the
Analytics graphs. Play around with different segmenting options and views,
and feel free to explore. You can’t break anything in the Analytics report sec-
tion — it’s all read-only.
The Keyword Positions view
From the left navigation, choose AdWords and then Keyword Positions.
Below the obligatory line graph of visits over time, you’ll see a list of your
keywords, and the number of visits generated by each one. Click any key-
word, and a magical view appears to the right of the keyword list. This view
shows you how many clicks were generated by that keyword in each position
on the search-results page. The view itself is a mockup of the search-results
page, on which ads can appear on top of the organic results to the left
(labeled Top 1, Top 2, and Top 3) or down the right side (labeled Side 1
through Side 10), as shown in Figure 15-8. You can use this information to find
and bid on your keyword’s “sweet spot” on the search-results page.
Figure 15-8:

You can also determine position for ads showing on the content network. If
an advertiser runs an AdSense tower of five ads, your ad could be in posi-
tions one through five in that ad block.
Automating Analytics reporting
At the top of almost every screen, Analytics gives you the option to export or
e-mail the results in one of four formats: PDF (for Adobe Acrobat Reader),
XML (a Web language), CSV (for Microsoft Excel) and TSV (Tab Separated
Values, for other spreadsheet applications). You can also add the view to the
main Dashboard.
When you create an e-mail report, you can customize it and schedule it to be
sent to whomever you want at regular intervals. You can even include a date
comparison, so you can see changes in the key numbers each week or month.
Under the Schedule tab, just check the box labeled Include Date Comparison.
Acting on Your Data 
to Make More Money
Throughout this chapter, I show you examples of data that you can act on to
improve Web site conversion. In this section, I recap some of the low-hanging
fruit that you can pluck with even a simple, non-e-commerce Analytics setup.
Optimizing your site for your visitors
The more you know about your visitors, the more successfully you can create
a Web site that serves their needs and invites their business. Begin with the
Web Design Parameters screen in the Webmaster view. View and print your
visitors’ browser versions, screen resolutions, and connection speeds for the
past week, month, and three months. Note the most popular types of each
characteristic.
The next step will take a little work, but it’s well worth the effort. Go and navi-
gate your Web site using the browsers, resolutions, and connection speeds
used by your visitors. How long does you site take to load via dialup? What
part of your landing page is visible on an 800 x 600 screen? What does your
order form look like in Safari or Firefox?
345
Chapter 15: Making More Sales with Google Analytics

If you interact with your site using only your own computer, you have no idea
what your visitors are experiencing. Take the time to put yourself in their
shoes, or on their mouse, and you may discover simple design tweaks that
will double conversion literally overnight.
Improving site “stickiness”
If visitors leave your site after viewing only one or two pages, you may have 
a “stickiness” problem. A sticky site is one that keeps visitors engaged for 
a long period of time, so they have a chance to get to know you, answer 
their questions, and feel more comfortable with the idea of doing business
with you.
The Average Pageviews per Visit metric, available on many screens, is a good
indicator of how sticky your site is. If you spend all your energy on your
AdWords campaigns yet lose visitors within a page or two on your site, you
know where you need to improve.
From Timothy Seward of ROI Revolution: “To calculate your target for
pageviews per visit, count how many pages it would take to complete the
core goal of your site. For example, if your site is an ecommerce site, then
count how many pages it takes from the homepage to make it all the way to
the receipt page. That resulting number is a good target to shoot for.”
Loyalty and recency
Loyalty refers to the number of times visitors return to your site. Recency, like
it sounds, refers to how recently they’ve been back. Most successful busi-
nesses display high loyalty and recency metrics: Their customers come back
again and again, and a large percentage of their customers have purchased
recently.
Click Visitors on the left, then Visitor Loyalty, then Loyalty. You’ll see a bar
chart showing the number and percentage of visitors who have visited your
site once, twice, three times, all the way up to 25–50 visits (as shown in
Figure 15-9). If your online business depends on repeat customers to be prof-
itable, you should improve the effectiveness of your e-mail follow up
sequences and other means of generating repeat traffic.
346
Part V: Testing Your Strategies and Tracking Your Results 

The report just below Loyalty is Recency. A healthy site attracts its visitors
back at regular intervals, whether it be daily, weekly, or monthly. Figure 15-10
shows a site that encourages visitors to return on roughly a bi-weekly or
monthly basis. The site, www.peaceweavers.com, does so by means of a
regular newsletter and an updated photo blog.
As AdWords matures and competition heats up, the value of the first transac-
tion will trend toward break-even. If you want to be successful, you must cul-
tivate recency and frequency in your customers. E-mail autoresponders and
broadcasts (see Chapter 11), special events, teleseminars, referral contests,
quizzes, new articles, and sales can all make your Web site a recurring desti-
nation rather than a one-shot deal.

Chapter 15: Making More Sales with Google Analytics

Evaluating Web site changes
You can apply the date range comparison function to goal tracking and goal
conversion. For example, say that you made a change to your opt-in landing
page on July 1, and you want to determine the effect of that change. You can
compare the goal conversion for your opt-in for July 1–30, compared to June
1–30 of the same year.
In your AdWords Campaign report (or most other reports), first click the date
range at the top right of the screen. Set the date range by clicking and select-
ing the start and end date, and then check the Compare to Past check box. By
default, you’ll see the previous week or month, depending on your current
date range. To change the comparison range (for example, to the same month
last year), choose the Timeline tab and drag the slider to the left until you
reach the beginning of the comparison date range.
The graph now contains bars of two different colors, representing the differ-
ent time periods. In Figure 15-11, the total number of visits and unique visi-
tors were up from March to April, but the time on site, average pageviews,
and bounce rate all got slightly worse. The owner of this site needs to spend
more time improving the site, rather than generating new traffic.

Page and funnel navigation
The visually coolest part of Analytics is the navigation. You can see how 
visitors abandon the funnel you’ve defined, and where they go. You can also
analyze any page on your site in terms of where visitors come from before
landing on that page — and where they go afterward (shown in Figure 15-12).
Page navigation
Click Content from the left navigation. Identify your most viewed pages on
the left, under the Top Content header, and click each URL to see how that
page fits in your visitors’ navigation. You can learn how visitors found that
page by clicking the Navigation Summary link. You’ll discover that some of
your pages are sending visitors in the wrong direction, and you can take
steps to correct the problem. You can make links bigger and more noticeable.
You can move buttons and forms left or right, above the fold, or repeat them
several times on a page. You can highlight text, use arrows or animation to
draw eyeballs, or deploy audio or video.
Funnel Visualization
From the Goals section in the left navigation, choose Funnel Visualization.
You can select any of your (up to four) goals. You will see how well your
funnel moves visitors from entry to goal achievement, and where and why
they are abandoning your funnel, as shown in Figure 15-13.
Timothy Seward offers the example of a detour from the shopping cart check-
out page to the guarantee page instead of the completed sale. Upon discover-
ing that, a clever merchant would add the guarantee to the checkout page
and keep their visitors on track to a sale.

Reverse Goal Path
Also under Goals, check out Reverse Goal Path. This view shows you how vis-
itors actually get to your goals; not what you think your funnel is, but what
your visitors think it is. You may uncover your visitors’ unanswered ques-
tions and objections by studying the reverse path to each goal. If a lot of visi-
tors are coming through your privacy policy page, a page usually ignored by
viewers, perhaps your site doesn’t seem trustworthy enough. You may want
to add credibility elements such as logos, anti-spam assurances, and more
professional design.

In this part . . .
T
his part covers important stuff that didn’t quite fit in
the rest of the book. I gathered these tidbits and
assembled them into top-ten lists.
I gathered together the worst beginner’s mistakes I’ve
encountered in my years as an AdWords consultant and
coach for Chapter 16. Avoid these and you’ve shaved two
years off your learning curve.
Chapter 17 contains case studies that highlight the princi-
ples revealed in this book. You’ll find a broad range of
businesses, challenges, and solutions that are meant to
bring the concepts to life and inspire you to make your
own AdWords success stories.
Because I had so much fun writing Chapters 16 and 17, I
wrote two more top-ten lists and made them into Bonus
Chapters 1 and 2. You can view and download these chap-
ters as PDF files at www.dummies.com/go/adwords.
In Bonus Chapter 1, I share a bunch of the online tools I
use personally and recommend highly. Some are free and
some are paid; start with the free ones and start paying
for tools out of your AdWords profits.
Bonus Chapter 2 was my excuse to contact some of the
best copywriters in the world and get them to return my
e-mails. You’ll get a first-class education from these tips
on writing great Google ads.

A
dWords can have a steep learning curve, as well as an expensive one. 
In this chapter, I quickly run through the most common and expensive
mistakes I’ve seen as an AdWords consultant and fixer.
Neglecting to Split Test Your Ads
Even the world’s best marketers are wrong more often than they’re right. If
you run a single ad, the chances of that ad being the best of all the possible
ads in the universe are laughably small. When you compare two very different
ads head to head, one of them will almost always be better than the other —
more compelling, more attractive, or more in tune with the innermost desires
of your market.
When you’ve run the test long enough to have statistically significant data,
you gracefully retire (or unceremoniously fire, whichever you prefer) the
losing ad and put up another challenger. You continue the process, directing
the survival of the fittest ad until you find the one unbeatable control that
maximizes your business goals.
In the old pre-Internet days, split testing was complicated and expensive, a
high-level business process reserved for huge companies with giant main-
frame computers and millions of dollars on the line. Now, Google AdWords

makes split testing as easy as sending e-mail; when I see advertisers neglect-
ing this fundamental improvement strategy, I feel like the mom telling her kid
to eat his peas because there are children starving somewhere else in the
world. I want to shake them and shout, “Don’t you realize how lucky you are
to be able to split test so easily and cheaply and achieve such quick and con-
clusive results?”
If you aren’t split testing at this point, contact my office. I’ll pack my
WrestleMania Split Test Avenger outfit, fly (business class only, please) to
your place of business, and shake some sense into you.
Practical advice:
 When you set up a new ad group, always have two different ads ready.
 Think of split tests as experiments you’re conducting to satisfy your
curiosity. Keep a journal of questions, prioritize them, and always have
another split test waiting in the wings.
 Split test wide variations first, and then narrow down to smaller details.
 Check for statistical significance before declaring a winner. Don’t mis-
take randomness for rock-solid trends.
 Split test landing pages and e-mail sequences as well as AdWords ads.
With the right tools, these split tests are almost as easy as the AdWords
split-testing interface.
See Chapter 13 for best practices in split testing.
Letting Google Retire Your Ads 
without Testing
Another campaign setting that you need to override is the Ad Serving option
in the Advanced Options section. From your campaign management console,
click into a campaign and then click the Edit Campaign Settings link near the
top. On the next page, Campaign Settings, find Ad Serving under Advanced
Options (on the left). Do not optimize ad serving. Do not let Google show
better performing ads more often. Instead, select the radio button next to
Rotate: Show Ads More Evenly.
If you’re split testing, you have two goals: You want to identify the winner as
quickly as possible, and you want to learn something from the test that will
help you connect better with your market in the future.
354
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

When you let Google take control behind the scenes and quietly retire your
low-CTR ads, you allow tests to drag on unnecessarily. It’s like holding a race,
not specifying its length, and running it until the winner is miles away and the
losers are gasping for breath at the side of the road. A much more efficient
method is to establish a finish line and identify the winner as soon as the
tape is broken. When Google retires your ads behind your back, you lose the
market intelligence that your split tests often provide.
Finally, as I show in Chapter 14, the ad with the best CTR is often the least
profitable. Yet Google chooses winners based on CTR, not conversion.
Split Testing for Improved CTR Only
Ads that generate high CTR can be wonderful. They attract more visitors to
your site at lower cost, and rank higher than other ads bidding the same
amount. They also teach you about your market’s desires and fears.
But when you split test two ads and choose the winner based solely on CTR,
you are in danger of worshipping a false god. Understand that the AdWords
game is based on one rule: Get more outputs for your inputs than anyone
else. Okay, CTR is a key throughput — but leads, customers, and dollars are
what you’re after.
A mention of Paris Hilton in your ad text may generate a high CTR, but just
like the old magazine ads with the four-inch red headline of the word sex, she
may be attracting eyeballs belonging to nonbuyers. Remember that lots of
clicks translates into lots of money for Google, not for you. Getting the right
clicks is more important than getting lots of clicks.
When you split test your ads, make sure you run conversion reports, and
don’t rely on CTR alone.
Ignoring the Display URL Line 
in Your Ad
After the headline, the Display URL line is the most important one in your ad.
It constitutes as much as 25% of the entire ad. Yet the typical beginner simply
puts the name of his or her Web site, and doesn’t even try capitalizing — let
alone adding subdomains or subdirectories, or experimenting with other
URLs that redirect to the main Web site.
355
Chapter 16: The Ten Most Serious AdWords Beginner’s Mistakes

The Display URL is the name of your store, in the eyes of the searcher. Search
is an activity based on speed — people want quick results, and they want 
the right information and the right product served to them right away. If
someone is looking for a three-hole punch, and their choices are thunder
mountainofficesupplies.com or threeholepunchesforall.com, they
will assume that the latter site is likelier to satisfy their desire — and do it
more quickly.
To test different domain names, you can use a redirect service such as
www.zoneedit.com or just buy a bunch of domains at www.getgoing
online.com and redirect them manually.
Even easier and cheaper is the use of subdomains (such as holepunches.
ecoofficesupply.com) and subdirectories (say, ecoofficesupply.
com/3holepunches). Again, www.zoneedit.com makes quick work of cre-
ating and managing multiple subdomains, and your first five domains with
them are free.
Creating Ad Groups with 
Unrelated Keywords
The easiest way to set up an ad group is to write an ad, dump every keyword
you can think of into that group, and send it to your home page. Heck, that
should take you about 10 minutes of work if you’re using some of the power-
ful keyword tools I talk about in Chapter 5. It’s much more complicated and
time-consuming to create tight ad groups, based on a narrow set of related
keywords matched closely to the ads and the landing page. But your results
will be well worth the extra time and effort.
Keywords unrelated to ads and landing pages produce poor CTR and conver-
sion results — and cost a lot of money because of the poor quality score
penalty. Remember that each keyword represents a mindset; take the time to
group your keywords by similar mindsets, and write your ads and landing
pages to address the desires and fears attached to those mindsets.
You can tell when your ad groups are too broad if the CTRs of different key-
words in the same group vary wildly. You may discover that the successful
keywords are found in the ad headline and repeated in the description or
URL. Peel the underperforming keywords out of that ad group and stick them
into their own group, with an ad written just for them.
356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Muddying Search and Content Results
Many beginners rely on Google’s default settings when creating campaigns.
Remember that Google’s defaults usually serve to simplify your account and
to increase Google’s revenue. Sometimes those two goals are compatible with
your goals, and sometimes they aren’t. One of the campaign settings you
need to change right away, because you prefer profitability to simplicity, is
Networks. (See Figure 16-1.)
If you run all three steams of traffic (Google, search partners, and content
network) through the same ad group, you lose the ability to distinguish
among the very different kinds of traffic. Content network traffic consists of
people who were interrupted while they were reading or surfing or watching
something else. Search network traffic consists of people who are actively
looking for your keywords. Not only do they arrive at your site driven by dif-
ferent motivations and desires, they respond differently to your ads and
offers.
In many cases, content traffic overwhelms search traffic. When that’s true,
you lose the ability to split test ads properly; your accurate CTR and conver-
sion data from the search traffic is drowned out by the flood of content traf-
fic. Figuring out what your market is telling you is like trying to hear a cricket
at a heavy-metal concert.

Chapter 16: The Ten Most Serious AdWords Beginner’s Mistakes

When you choose winning ads and identify profitable keywords based on
poorly converting search traffic — and try to apply those lessons to your
search marketing — in essence you’re surveying penguins to try to sell to
chimpanzees. The two market channels are very different, and should be
studied and treated differently.
See Chapter 7 for detailed instructions on how to split Google, search part-
ner, and content network traffic into three different campaigns.
Ignoring the 80/20 Principle
The 80/20 principle, applied to AdWords, states that the vast majority of out-
puts (impressions, clicks, leads, sales, and such) are caused by a very small
minority of inputs (ad groups, ads, and keywords). Instead of diffusing your
efforts, focus on the vital few rather than the insignificant many.
When you follow my advice and create Best Practice AdWords campaigns,
you inevitably create a fair amount of complexity. With so many variables to
monitor and juggle and adjust, it’s common to become overwhelmed and
wonder, “What do I do now?”
I often see consulting clients who have spend days massaging an ad group
that has no potential to make a significant contribution to their bottom line,
while ignoring the big keywords in the important ad groups.
Keep reminding yourself that the AdWords game is about maximizing outputs
from fixed inputs. In this case, inputs are impressions and advertising cost.
Spend your time fixing the things that will make the biggest difference:
1. Sort your campaigns by impressions.
2. Sort that campaign’s ad groups by impressions.
Assess the ads in that group — do you have a clear winner?
3. Sort keywords by impressions, and look at the top five keywords.
Are they making you money? Do you need to adjust their bids? Peel and
stick them into a new ad group? Pause or delete them?
Here the number of impressions is your limiting factor. If you have two ad
groups, one with 50 impressions a day and the other with 20,000, a 50%
improvement in conversion might translate into one additional sale a month
for the smaller group and one to two more sales a day for the larger group.
Where do you want to spend your time?
One exception: you may be artificially limiting impressions in two ways:
358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 By ignoring potential high-traffic keywords
 By bidding for a position on page two or worse
Make sure you check your average position for each keyword, ad, ad group
and campaign before assuming you’ve maxed out its traffic.
Declaring Split-Test Winners Too Slowly
Once you set up split testing, you want to identify winners as quickly as pos-
sible, so you can learn and improve faster than your competition. If you can
double your CTR and maintain the same quality of traffic, you get twice as
many visitors for the same amount of money. When you double your Web
site’s traffic, you can run your landing-page and sales-page split tests twice as
fast as well. The faster you split test, the faster you improve.
I commonly look at new clients’ accounts and point out that they have been
running a split test for weeks longer than they need to. Not only are they
showing an inferior ad half the time, they’re also wasting the most precious
resource of all: meaningful insights about their market.
Set up reports to run on a regular basis that just look at ad performance.
Make it a habit to run the numbers through the statistical significance tester
at www.askhowie.com/split and identify split tests that have yielded con-
clusive, action-producing results.
You can automate this process and receive e-mail notification of split-test
winners by subscribing to www.winneralert.com.
Declaring Split-Test Winners Too Quickly
If your ad group receives a lot of traffic, your split tests may achieve statisti-
cal significance after only an hour or two. The problem with this speedy out-
come is that the people searching during that particular window of time may
be different from people searching at other times. If you choose a winner
based on the traffic from 2:00 to 4:00 in the morning on Sunday, you may be
picking an ad that has less appeal to people searching at noon on Wednesday.
To be safe, run each split test for at least a week, so you don’t put too much
weight into a cyclical blip. You can run reports by date and time to identify
differences in impressions, CTR, and conversion by day of the week and time
of day.
359
Chapter 16: The Ten Most Serious AdWords Beginner’s Mistakes

If your week-long split test threatens to become too expensive because of the
volume of traffic, you can limit your traffic geographically by creating a cam-
paign that targets a few low-population metropolitan areas but shows your 
ad 24/7.
Forgetting Keywords in Quotes 
(Phrase Matching) or Brackets 
(Exact Matching)
When you put a keyword in quotation marks, you tell Google that the quoted
words or phrase must appear exactly as written somewhere in the keyword.
Brackets are even more specific: They signify that the searcher must enter
the keyword exactly as it appears within the brackets, with nothing added or
removed.
When you use broad match keywords only (putting no quotes or brackets on
the keyword), you don’t really know what your visitors actually entered as
search terms. You lump many different searches into a big vague basket and
miss out on some valuable market intelligence.
Phrase and exact match keywords often achieve higher CTRs than broad
matches, because you can create ads that speak directly to the exact words
and phrases your visitors type.
Because of the hierarchy among broad, phrase, and exact match keywords,
be aware that phrase match keywords cannibalize their broad match coun-
terparts, and exact match keywords steal impressions from both. If the CTRs
differ among the three match types for high-traffic keywords, peel the under-
performers and stick them into their own ad groups. (See more about key-
word matching in Chapter 5.)
Ignoring Negative Keywords
Negative keywords keep certain searchers from seeing your ads. If you get
significant traffic from broad or phrase match keywords, you may find that
Google is matching your ad to some irrelevant searches. If you want to deter
tire-kickers from costing you clicks, you may want to add negative keywords
like free and complimentary.
360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

If you target upscale buyers, you can improve your ROI by eliminating dis-
count and cheap, as well as certain brand names that have low-end conno-
tations. If some of your search terms are ambiguous (for example anthrax
refers to both a disease and a heavy-metal band) or could refer to two differ-
ent niches of the same market (auto glass and plate glass windows),
save your click money by adding negative keywords to your keyword list.
Monitor your keyword-conversion performance over time to find new nega-
tive keywords. If you sell golf clubs and none of your golf instruction
keywords convert, you can add instruction as a negative keyword.
Keeping the Keyword 
Quality Score Hidden
Google introduced the keyword quality score in 2006, without much fanfare
or documentation. It’s not even shown in the default ad group Keyword tab
screen. You must add the Quality Score column to the ad group Keyword tab
to be able to manage this crucial metric.
Quality score tells you how much you must bid in order to show your 
ad for a given keyword. Poor quality scores put you at a huge competitive
disadvantage in your market; for this reason, I advise my clients to fix their
quality scores before dealing with anything else on their sites or AdWords
campaigns.
AdWords was the first advertising medium in the world to penalize advertis-
ers for showing irrelevant content to their users. Their algorithms are based
on years of comprehensive data collection — the keyword quality scores con-
tain information based on far more than your measly account. Ignoring it
means you are missing the opportunity to make your whole sales process
more customer-friendly and effective.
Activate the quality-score column by going to the ad group, clicking the
Keyword tab, and clicking the Customize Columns link. Select Quality Score
from the Customize Columns drop-down list.

Spending Too Much or Too Little 
in the Beginning
Marketing Consultant Joy Milkowski of www.adwordstoolbox.com
reminded me of another big beginner’s mistake: Over- or under-spending
during the first weeks and months of your AdWords campaigns.
If you open your wallet too much by specifying too high a monthly budget or
daily spend, you’ll lose all your money before you have time to learn the
ropes. When you’ve figured out that something isn’t working, turn it off right
away while you make changes. Chances are — even with this book under
your belt — you will take some time to get the feel of AdWords and develop
proficiency. If you rush, you’ll blow through your budget several times and
walk away going, “This stuff doesn’t work.”
If you ever took a driving lesson, you may remember that your instructor
made you drive slowly for a long time, showing you how to steer and brake
and stop fiddling with the radio dial, before ever letting you open up on a
highway. Your AdWords budget is your MPH — take it easy until you learn
how to drive safely.
Other clients are so hesitant that they set daily and monthly budgets far too
low to generate enough traffic. They don’t get enough impressions to split
test and improve their ads and keywords, and they give up in frustration.
Without enough statistically significant data, they don’t know how to improve
their campaigns and quit in frustration. That’s like learning to drive by never
going faster than five miles per hour. The experience of going 55 MPH (or 85,
which I wouldn’t know about, especially not on I-95 in Maryland just south of
DC, I swear) is qualitatively and not just quantitatively different from inching
along in an empty parking lot. The super-slow experience just doesn’t trans-
fer to the real thing.
The happy medium involves setting a learning budget and sticking with it. Do
your homework (see Chapter 4) to estimate the amount of traffic you can
expect. Your advertising spend (as well as the daily or weekly attention you’ll
need to give your account) depends on the velocity of that traffic. At first,
don’t expect to make money, or even come close to breaking even. You’re not
advertising to earn it back; instead, you’re running market tests so you can
come out swinging when you open up your wallet and your traffic. Your goal
is to get your ROI into the black within a few months.

T
he best way to see the strategies and concepts from this book in action is
by viewing actual examples. I can’t show you all the details, because suc-
cessful advertisers guard their keywords, strategies, and metrics like the
recipe for Coca-Cola. I’ve compiled case studies from consultants who hope
you’ll think they’re clever enough to hire them, from clients who hope you’ll
go to their Web sites and buy their products, and from friends egotistical
enough to want to see their names in a book. Among these three groups,
you’ll see enough gems to keep you busy for a while.
Adding a Welcome Video 
to the Landing Page
Ken Evoy, president of www.sitesell.com (a turn-key Web hosting and 
e-commerce business-building system), thought that he had fully optimized his
Web-site conversion process through years of comprehensive testing. Nothing
he tried could beat his control site. But he found that adding a short, friendly
Welcome to My Website video to his home page dramatically increased sales
for his Site Build It! service. The video helped increase sales by 30% by 
explaining the product and building an emotional connection with visitors.
With the help of Web video consultant Joe Chapuis of www.webvideozone.
com, Ken created a 3-minute video shortcut for the SiteSell homepage that
walks prospects through a quick tour of his site and service. Ken explained,
“Site Built It! is a big product that takes a lot of words to explain. Video
enables us to get so much more information across so much more efficiently.”

Ken added the video to the top of his home page, using the Flash video
player available at www.webvideozone.com. Joe Chapuis explained the
importance of video placement: “If you want someone to watch your video,
you need to have it at the top of the page where it will get noticed, as well as
on a Web page that prospects are likely to visit.”
Ken reported that sales increased by 30% since he added video to the home
page: “Video is incredibly powerful, especially for a product like SBI. . . . We
have never been able to communicate so precisely, effectively, nor with such
emotion.”
As Seen on TV Ads and Web Copy
Dremu.com sells skin-care, wrinkle-removing, and anti-aging products formu-
lated with emu oil. They have used an ad strategy that I call media credential-
izing to generate high CTRs and robust sales conversions. Their ads include
phrases like these:
as seen on NBC
as seen in Vogue and Allure
as seen on [name’s] show
Mass-media convey much more credibility than online media. Anyone can
have a Web site — heck, your nephew who flunked high-school math proba-
bly has a Web site — but not anyone can get interviewed on television or get
quoted in a magazine or newspaper. The money Dremu spent on PR to get a
few local media mentions or TV spots has paid off many times over, not in
immediate sales following the media appearance, but in the consistent use of
the original exposure to build credibility.
On the Dremu.com Web page is a list of media that have included mention of
Dremu’s Deception cream. On the same page, www.dremu.com/deception,
you can watch a video clip from a local ABC-TV affiliate demonstrating the
product. The media appearances have snowballed — national news and
entertainment outlets scour local media for interesting stories, and consider
the fact that a story has run somewhere else proof that it’s newsworthy.
Within four months of including media appearances in their ads and Web
pages, Dremu.com’s sales volume had doubled.
Dremu.com also bid on the names of celebrities who have been quoted as
using or recommending their products. When Cindy Crawford introduced her
new line of anti-aging products, Heavenly Beauty, via late-night infomercials,
Dremu.com bid on Cindy Crawford Heavenly Beauty and saw a huge
spike in sales whenever the infomercial ran. Apparently, Heavenly Beauty had
not included AdWords in its marketing mix, so many of the people who

looked her up online were directed to a different anti-wrinkle cream with an
equally impressive client list.
Plugging in the Blender 
with Risk Reversal
Sometimes you do 99% of the things right and still can’t achieve success, a
situation that seems to fly in the face of the 80/20 Rule, the Golden Rule, and
the Rule of Thumb. I think of that situation as the blender bafflement:
I’m preparing to make a delicious and nutritious fruit smoothie. I’ve got
water, rice milk, pitted organic medjool dates, frozen berries, a banana,
walnut pieces, a little bit of frozen spinach (you can’t taste it), ground flax
seeds, and my awesome Vitamix blender. I put the lid on the blender (I hate it
when globs of smoothie hit the ceiling and drip down my neck for the next
half hour), and press the switch. Nothing happens.
The blender isn’t plugged in, of course. The plug is just two inches away from
the outlet — and gee, in the grand scheme of things, that’s good enough, isn’t
it? Especially since everything else is configured perfectly. But no — blender
bafflement is unforgiving.
John Lercari of www.thememoriesplace.com was suffering from a bit of the
blender bafflement. The Memories Place sells customized rugs and throws
with photographs on them, and despite all his best efforts, John could not
figure out how to achieve his goal of doubled sales. Then he hit upon the con-
cept of risk reversal from a classic marketing book, Jay Abraham’s Getting
Everything You Can Out of All You’ve Got: 21 Ways You Can Out-Think, Out-
Perform, and Out-Earn the Competition (St. Martin’s Griffin). John realized that
no one in his industry offered a satisfaction guarantee on their products.
After all, if you don’t like the shower-curtain-sized photo of you and your
brother drinking beer and playing beach volleyball, it’s not like John can turn
around and sell it to anyone else.
When John went back through his records, he confirmed something he already
knew — almost all his customers were delighted with their rugs and throws and
pillows and other items, and he could count the number of refund requests and
complaints over the last couple of years on the fingers of one hand. He promi-
nently added a guarantee to his site: “If you are not completely satisfied with
your throw from The Memories Place, we will remake it for you.” He pointed out
that this guarantee was unlike anyone else’s in the industry — featuring it on
pop-overs, navigation buttons, and text throughout his site. Without changing
anything else, his daily sales tripled overnight. The two inches between the
blender plug and the wall outlet was, in John’s case, the concern in his
prospects’ minds that they wouldn’t like the finished product and would be
stuck with it. When he erased that concern, sales increased significantly.

Getting the Basics Right
Kelly Conway of www.ctrexpert.com kindly saved me several hours of
work by providing the following case study. Notice the simple steps that
cumulatively produced stellar results.
I met David O’Hara, a product-development expert, when he was looking for
help in selling one of his products, the Breatheasy blood-pressure reduction
system, via PPC advertising. David’s goal for this ad campaign is to drive
visitors to a landing page where he makes a one-time sale of either a CD or
downloadable product. Two landing-page examples include
www.highbloodpressurehq.com and
www.highbloodpressurehq.com/about_me.html
The campaign includes 30–40 ads, which we continuously split-test.
Examples include:

101 Clicks | 3.63% CTR | $0.16 CPC
The state of the ad campaign, at the time that David contacted me, was
similar to many other campaigns I’ve seen. He was bidding on 600–800
keywords, all of which were in a single ad group. None of the keyword
phrases were making use of anything other than Google’s broad-match
option. David’s initial request was to get the minimum cost-per-click of many
of his keywords below the $1 and $5 Google was requesting.
366
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Improve Web Site to Increase Keyword Quality Score and Lower 
Bid Prices
The campaign’s overall CTR had been around 0.50%. My immediate goal
was to raise that number dramatically. I knew by doing that, I would be
able to decrease the minimum bid and our average CPC. The initial cost
per click was $0.23. However, David still had hundreds of keywords he
wasn’t bidding on due to the $1 and $5 minimum-bid requirements. In
addition, I recommended that David add content to his Web site so that
Google would find his keywords more relevant. He went to work on that
while I worked on increasing the CTR.
Add Quotes and Brackets to Every Keyword
First, I created phrase- and exact-match versions for every keyword in the
campaign. Those keyword variations often have less competition, which
means their bid prices can be lower. Additionally, they often attract better-
targeted visitors than the broad-match versions of the same phrases.
Delete Poorly-Performing Keywords
Next, in order to quickly raise the campaign’s CTR, I needed to delete the
keywords that were performing poorly. I deleted phrases that, after 200 or
more impressions, had resulted in no sales and had not achieved at least a
0.80% CTR.
Interim Results after Two Weeks
Implementing these strategies helped us increase the campaign’s cumulative
CTR to 1.02% by the end of the second week. Additionally, we managed to
lower our average CPC by nearly 10%, to $0.21, during that period. By the
end of the first month, our overall CTR was 1.67%. Google reported our
average ad position for the first month as 5.6; indicating that our ads
appeared, on average, in fifth or sixth position within Google’s sponsored
listings.
Segment Keywords into Ad Groups
The next step was to segment the keywords into groups of related phrases.
This work was time consuming, but not difficult. I reviewed all of our
keywords and identified 18 targeted groups. For example, a person
searching for “hypertension cure” may have a very different mindset
from someone who searches for “lower blood pressure quickly”,
though both are good prospects for David’s product. Segmenting the overall
market allowed us to write specific ads targeted to the apparent internal
dialog of each person searching for a solution. A valuable side benefit of
this exercise was that the resultant shift in perspective from the market as a
whole to market segments allowed us to unearth additional search phrases
that doubled the size of our keyword list.
367
Chapter 17: Ten AdWords Case Studies

Continued Split-Testing
We had, of course, been split-testing ads all along. One particular ad (the
first one displayed above) had consistently out-pulled all contenders. In the
new groups, we split-tested that control ad against ones specific to each
group’s market segment. In about half of the cases, the control ad still won;
proving that you never know what will work best until you test. We continue
to write market-specific ads and split test them against the control, however,
and new winners emerge each week.
Discouraging Unqualified Traffic
In the interest of increasing sales conversions, we took a few actions that
reduced our CTR. For example, as soon as we got the overall CTR above
1%, we introduced several negative keywords (such as “-free”). This
combination of forward and backward steps resulted in an overall CTR of
3.88% over the first five months of the campaign. At that point, several of
our ad groups had achieved a CTR over 4%; the highest was 4.98%. Dozens
of specific keyword phrases garnered double-digit CTR.
Current Results
In summary, over the first five months of this campaign, we increased the
CTR by 597% (0.65% to 3.88%), while reducing the average CPC 22% (from
$0.23 to $0.18) and maintaining an average ad position just over 5; as low
as 3.5 in one ad group. Additionally, at the five-month mark, no keyword
phrase had a minimum bid amount over $0.40. As a result of all this work,
David’s blood pressure is even lower today than when we started.

Letting Visitors Choose Their 
Own Sales Funnels
Glenn Livingston of www.ultimateadwordsresearch.com never begins a
Web project without conducting a “Will I Make Money, and If So, How?”
survey. One of his projects provides information on body language — how to
interpret it and how to use it. After performing keyword due diligence to
determine whether the size and hunger of the market would make the project
financially worthwhile, Glenn launched the site by driving AdWords clicks to
a survey that promised a free copy of the finished product in exchange for
answering questions that would help the author provide useful information.
The survey found several different market segments, and correlated those
segments to specific keywords. Once the survey was complete and Glenn fin-
ished the product, he wrote different sales copy for each segment, focusing
on their hot-button issues and highlighting bullets of specific interest to
them.
368
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

When someone enters the site, www.howtousebodylanguage.com, from
the home page, Glenn offers them a free subscription to his Body Language
Newsletter, and asks them via drop-down menus about their interest. Where
they go then is based on their choices; they are taken to the appropriate
sales letter.
This site makes several thousand dollars a month in almost entirely passive
income, and has generated a large list of people interested in body language
and persuasion, upon which Glenn can build a large back-end business.
15-Cent Click to $1700 Customer 
in Minutes
Mike Stewart of www.internetvideoguy.com doesn’t spend hours creating
new ads or designing amazing Web sites. He doesn’t research hungry markets
or spend hours creating long e-mail follow-up sequences. He buys cheap
clicks on AdWords on keywords related to recording teleseminars and phone
calls. He split-tests his ads but doesn’t generate enough impressions to make
significant changes very often.
Mike’s landing page (at www.teleseminartools.com) features a prominent
two-minute video commercial for a home talk show recording studio priced
at $1695. The video cost almost nothing to make, compared to tens or hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars for television commercial production. But the
decreased quality doesn’t matter on this site, because the AdWords traffic is
so highly qualified. A commercial airing during a break in The Office is shown
to everyone watching the program; only a tiny percentage of the viewers will
be interested in a given product at a given time. That’s why commercials on
mass media need to be repeated so often. But a commercial on an AdWords
landing page can specifically respond to the itch represented by the keyword.
For the low-traffic keyword teleseminars and its variations, Mike gener-
ated 134 clicks at $0.15 CPC over a three-month period, for a total advertising
spend of around $20.00. These clicks generated 13 sales totaling over $22,000
over the same period. Mike cautions that these numbers are possible for two
important reasons:
1. The keyword teleseminars generates a customer who is likely to be
qualified for the offer.
2. The product for sale lends itself to a video demonstration.
Mike teaches others how to create inexpensive Internet commercials at
www.internetvideoguy.com.

Local Search with Video Web Site
One of Mike Stewart’s clients is www.carpetdepotdecatur.com, a local
carpet store in Decatur, Georgia. The owner, Brad Flack, bids on about 30 key-
words in the Atlanta market only, and drives traffic to a Web site that uses
video to introduce the store and answer frequently asked questions. The ads
are simple, and include the call to action, watch online video.
The video on the home page features Brad introducing himself and explaining
the benefits and dramatic difference of his store. He references the map
below the video screen and the phone number above it, and invites viewers
to call or visit the store. Below the video is the first blue hyperlink, offering a
“Measure Your Home” how-to video.
Customers now come to the store feeling like they already know Brad from
viewing several minutes of video. He has stopped running ads in the Yellow
Pages, since most customers use Google first, and some rely on online search
exclusively. Since none of his competitors are advertising with Google at this
point (and he hopes they don’t read this book!), his ad is the only one that
prospects see. With no competition, clicks are cheap and his number-one
position is guaranteed.
Generating B2B Leads 
Without Cold Calling
Joe DiSorbo of www.webgistix.com uses the Web to generate targeted busi-
ness to business leads for e-commerce companies who want to automate or
outsource the packing and shipping of orders. Because his service is a com-
plex business to business sale, he uses the Web strictly to generate leads. Joe
explains how he went from AdWords zero to hero in 12 months by employing
very basic strategies. He explains:
Prior to using AdWords, we engaged in the painfully slow process of surfing
the Internet, locating a potential target (an existing e-commerce company),
finding their contact information on their Web site, and then cold-calling
them to pitch our services. We opened an AdWords account in May 2005,
made a list of all possible keywords, and got started.
Our first twelve months using the system can be broken into three distinct 
4-month periods with significant jumps in CTR.
370
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Phase 1 — The Beginning (May 2005 through Aug 2005)
Impressions: 146,028
Clicks: 467
CTR: 0.32%
CPC: $0.71
During the first four months we established two things:
1. People were actually searching online for fulfillment services and
clicking our ad.
2. We didn’t yet know how to attract and convert enough prospects to
make AdWords cost-effective.
We started with a single campaign that contained a single ad group. That ad
group consisted of every related keyword we could think of (broad match
only and a single ad). When we ran a new ad, we shut off the original one.
We didn’t know how much the campaign was going to cost so we limited our
daily budget and kept our bid prices low, which gave us a low position. Over
that period our highest CTR was 0.77%.
The good news was that prospects were in fact clicking on our advertisements
and coming to our Web site. Some even filled out a form and requested more
information. Once we had their information, we could call them back. These
calls were much easier to convert to sales than the cold calls we had been
making previously.
Phase 2 — The Big Leap (Sept 2005 to Dec 2005)
Impressions: 169,616
Clicks: 2,583
CTR: 1.52% (376% increase over Phase 1)
CPC: $1.62
During the second four months our AdWords efforts started to pay off.
Beginning in September 2005 our CTR increased to 1.52%. We had
significantly more people visiting our Web site and were converting more of
them to sales. Over that period we tried various ways to increase our
response rates. Three tactics in particular improved our campaigns the
most:
1. We got rid of the poorly performing and non-related keywords. This
lowered our overall impressions but improved the connection
between keywords and the ad.
2. We broke out like words into their own ad group so we could 
customize each headline for each set of keywords.
3. We began split-testing ads.
371
Chapter 17: Ten AdWords Case Studies

Because these changes were working well, we added new keyword groups
in November 2005. Impressions rose along with CTR as we applied our
newfound skills to the new ad groups.
Phase 3 — Continuous Refinement (Jan 2006 to Apr 2006)
Impressions: 393,021
Clicks: 10,990
CTR: 2.80% (83% Increase over Phase 2, 774% increase over Phase 1)
CPC: $1.23
In January 2006 our CTR took another big leap upward. We had been split-
testing vigorously for the past 4 months and refining our ad groups and
keywords. The big leap came when we tested a display URL that matched,
or was closely related, to the search term the person typed in. Now, both the
headline and the display URL were related directly to what the person was
searching for.
Up to this point we had been using our corporate domain, Webgistix.com,
only. Once we started using targeted URLs we again saw a big increase in
CTR. We went out and bought all the URLs we could get related to our
industry and started using them in the display URL for our top search terms.
These included:
Keyword
Display URL
Fulfillment Center
www.FulfillmentCenter.biz
fulfillment costs
www.fulfillmentcosts.biz
kitting
kitting.biz
pack and ship
packandship.info
literature fulfillment
literaturefulfillment.biz
ecommerce fulfillment
ecommercefulfillment.biz
In addition to customized display URLs, we set up Web sites with those URLs
to act as landing-page gateways to the main www.webgistix.com site. We
optimized those Web sites for different keywords, creating, in effect, landing
sites instead of just landing pages. We kept the corporate logo at the top, but
the important text and URL reflected the keyword. The Web site http://
fulfillmentcenter.biz is optimized for the keyword “fulfillment
center”.
This change increased our Web-site conversion from 1% to 3% instantly,
without any split testing.
The overall business result has been 80% sales growth three years in a row.

Understanding and Answering 
Customer Objections
Jaco Bolle of www.savefuel.ca sells a small generator that can be installed
in cars and trucks to add hydrogen gas to the engine for better gas mileage
and lower emissions. When he came to me for help in improving his Web site
conversion, he faced several marketing challenges:
1. Very few people have heard of supplemental hydrogen.
2. Most people are skeptical when they hear that they can improve their
gas mileage by adding hydrogen to their gas tank.
3. People associate hydrogen gas with the Hindenburg disaster and are
scared to generate it near their vehicle engine.
Through informal market research (talking about the product with everyone
we could find and reading posts in online forums dedicated to hydrogen tech-
nology and fuel savings), we identified these and other objections that were
preventing sales. Then we put together a nine-day e-mail course, titled
“Supplemental Hydrogen Secrets Revealed.” Each day addresses a different
objection head-on — educating and entertaining the reader, building a bond
of trust, and moving them closer to buying.
The first e-mail has the subject line, “Hydro-Gen, Iran and Poison Ivy.” It lists
the big benefits of hydrogen supplementation, includes several testimonials,
and is chatty and engaging. The references to Iran and Poison Ivy in the sub-
ject line, which were included to pique curiosity and get the e-mail read, are
echoed in this text from the e-mail:
For most of us, saving money and time (fewer fill-ups) is a pretty good
motivation all by itself. But in this case, there [are] a couple of very strong
“non-selfish” reasons to want to consume less fuel.
Everyone has a different take on world politics, but I’ve never met anyone
who thought that the U.S. should become more dependent on Middle Eastern
oil. It’s a little crazy to think that we’re worried about Iran’s nuclear program
and that we’ve been funding that program at the pumps for years.
And I don’t know about you, but I’m starting to believe the signs of global
warming. There [have] been reports on the news about poison ivy plants
growing faster and being itchier as the carbon dioxide levels in the
atmosphere rise.
373
Chapter 17: Ten AdWords Case Studies

On the third day we tackled the big objection: safety. An excerpt from the
e-mail, titled “The Hindenburg, Die Hard, and Sad Toddlers: Is Hydrogen
Safe?”, follows:
Of course, we get a lot of questions at SaveFuel.ca about the Hindenburg.
People want to know, “Is my car going to burst into flames over central New
Jersey if I install a Hydro-Gen unit?”
It’s a good question. It’s the first thing I’d ask before installing anything in my
car: Is it safe?
First of all, nothing is without its hazards. Forks, staplers, bicycles, cars,
toasters — they all can be misused in dangerous ways. So the real question
is, Is the Hydro-Gen safe if used properly?
Here’s why the Hydro-Gen is safer than the gasoline or diesel you 
currently use:
+ + + Hydrogen is less of a fire hazard than gasoline + + +
The Hydro-Gen uses a small amount of electricity to turn water into its two
component elements, hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen is much less
flammable than gasoline. Gasoline bursts into flames at anywhere from
228–501 degrees Celsius (442–933 degrees Fahrenheit), while hydrogen
doesn’t ignite until 550 degrees Celsius (1,022 degrees Fahrenheit).
All those scenes in the Die Hard movies where the car flips over and bursts
into flames — that’s ordinary gasoline, not hydrogen. Now, cars don’t
actually burst into flames very often in real life, but still — gasoline is far
more likely to ignite than hydrogen gas.
Here’s another thing: If you were ever forced to memorize the first row of 
the periodic table, you’ll recall that hydrogen is the first — and therefore
lightest — element. How light? Fifteen times lighter than air. Twice as light
as helium.
Did you ever give a helium balloon to a small child at the amusement park?
And they let go? That balloon really took off, didn’t it? Next time you comfort
a sad toddler about the loss of their helium balloon, imagine a balloon twice
as buoyant in air, filled with hydrogen.
Because it’s so light, hydrogen disperses upwards. Quickly. It doesn’t stick
around and burn, like gasoline does. If you watch a video of the Hindenburg
fire, you’ll notice something amazing: That giant ship burns hydrogen only
for 30 seconds. Rescuers run to the scene almost immediately.
(Check it out yourself in this video: http://tinyurl.com/lue73)
Here’s a startling fact: 62 out of 97 passengers on the Hindenburg survived
the disaster on May 6, 1937, many of them relatively unharmed. The ones
who died either fell, or were burned by dripping diesel fuel.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Note the chatty yet authoritative tone, the use of story to make the point, and
the non-salesy nature of the e-mail. This e-mail ends with a by-the-way call to
action: “ . . . if this e-mail has just put your mind at ease regarding safety,
here’s the lift to order a Hydro-Gen and get started saving gas and money
right away: www.savefuel.ca/oxy-hydrogen.”
Another e-mail addresses concerns about the unit voiding a vehicle’s war-
ranty or harming the engine. Day 5’s installment answers the objection, “This
sounds too good to be true. If hydrogen supplementation works, then the big
car companies would be using it.”
Slowly, the autoresponder sequence answers objections, provides more and
more testimonials, explains the technology, and culminates with an ironclad
risk-reversal guarantee. Borrowing language from a Robert Collier sales 
letter of the 1930s, we write, “By ordering, you obligate me, not yourself. If it
doesn’t work the way I say it will, I insist that you return the Hydro-Gen for a
full and prompt refund.”
The result of this e-mail sequence, coupled with several other improvements
to site, including tested headlines, the addition of live chat and live phone
operators available 20 hours per day, was a doubling of the site conversion,
from roughly 1.75% to 3.5%. Jaco relates that a competitor approached him in
despair, asking whether he would consider selling the competitor’s product
on the www.savefuel.ca Web site.
Making Money in an Impossible Market
David Bullock of www.davidbullock.com believes so strongly in rigorous
testing of the sales process that he decided to put his methodology to the test
in a nearly impossible situation: buying AdWords clicks for $0.25 and sending
the traffic to a Web page promoting an affiliate product that produces $4.25
per unit sale for David. In order to break even in this scenario, David’s site
needed to produce 1 sale for every 17 clicks. In other words, if the affiliate 
site — over which he had no control — could convert a very healthy 5% of its
visitors to paying customers, David could not have made money on the front
end, even if he had been able to send every single visitor to that site!
His goal for the campaign was a net profit of $30/day, stable and predictable.
He gave himself one advantage: He chose an inexpensive product with built-
in continuity — an impulse purchase that would lead customers to buy more
over time.
During the intense testing phase, David limited his Web site traffic to 100
clicks per day. His conversion at the start of the experiment was 2%: one sale
for every 50 visitors to his site.

Chapter 17: Ten AdWords Case Studies

Task #1: Lowering the bid price
The first task was to lower the bid price. At a quarter a click, there was no
way to turn this campaign into a financial success. David employed two
strategies: improving the ad CTR and firing underperforming keywords.
He employed Taguchi multivariate testing to find the ads with the highest
CTR. Taguchi testing uses matrices to create several ad variations at a time,
simulating the actual testing of thousands of ads. This method works only
with a very significant traffic stream. If you only get a few hundred impres-
sions a week, Taguchi testing will actually slow you down. From an initial
figure of 0.25% in January 2006, David’s CTR rose to 0.95% in February, 1.25%
in March, and 1.73% in April. It now holds steady at approximately 2.00%, an
eightfold improvement.
Second, he tracked his initial list of 335 keywords, and fired words that
weren’t leading to sales. Ultimately, the campaign contained only 85 key-
words. David’s CPC is now $0.12, less than half its original cost.
Task #2: Improving Web-site conversion
David focused his tests on three elements of his landing page: the headline,
the presence or absence of a photograph of the product, and the text on the
page. The original headline was “How to Buy X.” The eventual winner
became, “How to Get X Without Any Hidden Harmful Y” (sorry, he’s not going
to reveal the product or the Web site).
He found that an image of the product improved conversion, and that a long-
copy Web page did better than a short-copy Web page. Once the page format
was established, David performed Taguchi testing on the first few paragraphs
of the copy to establish the right words in the right order.
Now the site sends 50% of its AdWords visitors straight to the affiliate site
where they can purchase the product. One visitor out of every 24 makes a
purchase. His overall conversion rate from click to sale is 4.37%, significantly
higher than the breakeven requirement of 3.32%. And because of the continu-
ity, the back-end profits make the site even more lucrative. In April 2007
David spent $109 on AdWords and earned $1122 in affiliate income. In addi-
tion (he’ll be embarrassed for me to reveal), it took over an hour for him to
look up all these numbers because he locked down this campaign over a year
ago and hasn’t touched it since.
A single AdWords campaign to a single Web page selling a product he doesn’t
make, stock, or ship — and it pays the mortgage month after month. All
because David focused on the fundamentals and tested and tracked his
results rigorously.

Ten-Plus Tools to Make Your
AdWords Life Easier
In This Chapter
 Keyword research tools
 Account management and automation tools
 User-friendly reporting tools
W
hile the online AdWords interface includes many helpful tools, devel-
opers have created many third-party tools for keyword research,
account management and automation, and reporting that can make your life
easier and give you valuable data on the competition and the internal work-
ings of your own account.
Keyword Variant Generator
www.leadsintogold.com/keywords
www.askhowie.com/kvg
I’ve created a handy tool that adds phrase-match, exact-match, and negative
syntax to lists of keywords. Called the Keyword Variant Generator (KVG), this
tool is a programmed Excel spreadsheet that allows you to dump up to 3000
keywords into Column A, and generate the same keywords in quotes in
Column B, brackets in Column C, and preceded by a hyphen in Column D, as
shown in Figure BC1-1. You can then copy and paste these new variations
into your ad group keyword lists.
If you’ve tried adding quotes, brackets, and hyphens manually (which I did
for many months before getting smart and programming the functions), you
know how time-consuming and annoying the process can be. You end up with
k[eyword] and “keywor”d and have to correct everything by hand. Copy-
and-paste is much quicker and not prone to typos.

The KVG sells for $39.95 (you can read the exciting sales letter at www.

no sane person should be without it), but for you, dear For Dummies reader,
it’s my gift. Go to www.askhowie.com/kvg to download your very own

The FreeWordizer
www.askhowie.com/freewords
I’ve written about this tool in Chapters 4 and 5, but it’s so important to your
online success that I have to cover it again just in case you skipped those
chapters because you wanted to find out how the book ends. I created the
FreeWordizer to provide a reliable source of powerful and free keyword
research in an online tool. Yahoo Search Marketing, the business formerly
known as Overture, has provided such a tool in an on-again off-again fashion
for years, and during the writing of this book it disappeared for several days,
amid swirling rumors of its final demise. It did reappear, but many of us in the
keyword business got jolted out of our complacency and looked around for
alternatives.
The two keyword research tools that provide the most useful data are Keyword
Discovery and WordTracker (both are discussed later in this chapter). I find
Keyword Discovery’s results more applicable to my business, although
WordTracker is fine as well. When I had the FreeWordizer built, I arranged to
make the top 100 Keyword Discovery keywords available for free.

The interface is simple: a text box and a Research button. The instructions
are equally simple:
1. Type a keyword into the text box.
2. Click Research.
After a few seconds (sometimes more, but hey, it’s free), you’ll see a list of
the top 100 keywords that contain the word or phrase you entered, along
with the number of searches during the previous 12 months, as shown in
Figure BC1-2. Click any of those terms to drill deeper, in exactly the same
fashion.
In Figure BC1-2, you wouldn’t use the keywords given because they represent
very different markets. If you entered the keyword book to target customers
who want to learn how to publish a book, you would then click the sixth
result, book publishing, which received a not-too-shabby 744,704 searches
over the past year. You can see the results of that search in Figure BC1-3.

The Split Tester
www.askhowie.com/split
When you run two ads or landing pages simultaneously, and send half of the
traffic to one and half to another, you’re conducting a scientific test designed to
tell you which branch of the sales process is more effective. Google will tell you
which ad achieved a higher CTR, but it won’t tell you when your results are
conclusive. How do you know when your test is done? When can you say for
sure that Ad #1’s CTR of 2.6% is truly better than Ad #2’s CTR of 2.3%? Five
clicks? 15? 30? Every click you get after the magic one is wasting precious time.
The answer is found in the zany world of inferential statistics. With a small
number of clicks, you’re just not sure if your results are real or are just random
chance. You need a certain number of clicks to be reasonably certain one ad is
out-pulling another. That number depends on the difference between your
CTRs.
You can input your results into a statistical package or split-testing Web page
to find out whether to keep your test running or start a new test. Visit www.
askhowie.com/split to be redirected to the free split-tester tool, shown in
Figure BC1-4.

In Figure BC1-4, the first ad received 34 clicks from 400 impressions, while the
second ad garnered 17 clicks from 395 impressions. The Spit Test Analyzer
returns a 95% Confident rating, meaning that this difference can be explained
by randomness only 5% of the time.
I make marketing decisions based on the 95% confidence rating, because the
value of making quick decisions outweighs the downside of being wrong one
out of every 20 tests. If you aren’t comfortable at 95%, you can let the test run
longer to go for a 99% confidence rating.
KeyCompete
www.keycompete.com
KeyCompete allows you to “spy” on your competitors’ AdWords keywords. It
works in two ways: You can enter a keyword and get a list of Web sites bid-
ding on that keyword, and you can type in a Web site and get a list of their
keywords. The first feature is a convenience only, since you can find out
who’s advertising on a keyword by searching that keyword on Google. The
second feature is the powerful one, since you can duplicate hours of your
competitors’ keyword research and testing in just a few seconds. As the
KeyCompete Web site notes, “Advertisers with larger keyword lists win more
traffic at a lower cost per visitor than their competition.”
In Figure BC1-5, I’ve typed the name of one of my Web sites, www.vital
healthinstitute.com, since it wouldn’t be fair to show you the keywords
from someone else’s AdWords account. KeyCompete returns a list of key-
words that I’m using in AdWords, ranked by how well my site does for each
keyword in the organic search engines.

actual keywords used by real players in your market.
KeyCompete is not cheap, fortunately. The $299 per year annual subscription
will keep this tool exclusive enough to be useful. You can sign up for a one-day
trial for $19 if you just need to set up one campaign. I find myself checking out
KeyCompete several times a week, and my clients are always impressed when
I toss them a few keywords they haven’t thought of yet (now you know my

short period in the spring of 2005 where the site catapulted into the top
10,000, as well as periods in 2003 where it all but dropped out of site.
You can use Alexa to compare Web sites. After entering a URL, click Traffic

to enter four additional URLs. Figure BC1-7 shows a graph comparing the
home pages for CNN, Fox News, and The New York Times from April 2006 to
April 2007.
You can use the Alexa data to see how successful a company’s marketing
campaign has been, at least in terms of generating traffic to its site. Perry
Marshall points to www.coffeefool.com as an example: its Alexa ranking
rose precipitously in October 2006, coincident with its AdWords ads showing
up on a large percentage of Gmail pages.

Keyword Discovery
www.keyworddiscovery.com
Keyword Discovery is the most comprehensive keyword research tool on the
market. It’s expensive — $70 per month — and a bit clunky about exporting
and saving the search results. You can also get the top 100 Keyword Discovery
words for free from the FreeWordizer (covered earlier in this chapter).
In addition to lists of closely related keywords and its historical search
volume, Keyword Discovery also includes the very helpful “related key-
words” feature. You can enter a search term and request terms that are
related or synonymous, yet don’t contain the keyword itself. You can then
drill down into each of these terms to create tightly focused ad groups based
on keywords you might not have thought of by yourself.
WordTracker
www.wordtracker.com
WordTracker is the other heavyweight keyword research tool. Similar to
Keyword Discovery, but considerably less expensive at under $300 per year,
WordTracker pulls its data from different sources. Some marketers find the
WordTracker results more accurate, while others prefer Keyword Discovery.
Unless you’re playing in a hyper-competitive market, either will probably suit
your needs.

AdWords Reporter
www.adwordsreporter.com
If you’re a visual sort of person, AdWords Reporter can turn your gigantic
and confusing AdWords reports into meaningful graphs. You can see your
traffic, sales metrics, campaign performance, and other metrics over time,
even superimposed to help you identify relationships. For example, you
might discover that your CTR increases when your ads run in position 5
instead of position 6. In Figure BC1-8, I’m tracking transactions (vertical bars)
against ad position (horizontal-ish line) for each day in March for the Gout
campaign. In the table above the graph, you can see the ROI from each ad
group. Only the bottom three groups produce a positive ROI; armed with this
information (the tool itself is color coded, so the good groups appear in
green and the not-so-good ones in red), I can quickly identify poorly perform-
ing groups in need of remediation.

AdWords Reporter is a Windows-based tool that downloads to your desktop.
You feed it a new report every month (see Chapter 14 to set up recurring
reports) and it returns pretty (and potentially profitable) pictures. It took me
about two minutes to configure the report, following the directions on the
tool’s Web site. I downloaded the report to my hard drive, imported it into
AdWords Reporter, and within seconds I was able to understand my AdWords
account in a whole new way.
AdWords reporter costs $149 for the Professional Edition, which is probably
all you need unless you are in charge of multiple client accounts or run
AdWords for a larger organization. And if your boss is paying, then why not
go for the Enterprise Edition for twice the price?
AdWords Desktop Editor
www.google.com/adwordseditor
You can download a free application that allows you to manage your
AdWords account on your computer desktop without needing an Internet
connection. Your changes won’t show up until you reconnect and upload
those changes, and your updated account statistics won’t appear on your
desktop until you log on and download them. You can search, sort, and filter
campaigns, ad groups, and keywords much more quickly and easily with the
AdWords Editor than you can online. You can make bulk changes to keywords
and ad copy, something that currently cannot be done online. You can use
familiar copy and paste shortcuts to manage keyword lists and ad text, and
you can also save drafts of ads and keyword lists without uploading instantly.
The editor makes it simple to switch back and forth quickly between cam-
paigns, and even different accounts, in the case where you operate multiple
AdWords accounts or manage several client accounts. (See Figure BC1-9.)
You can add individual ad groups to a single campaign or multiple cam-
paigns, specifying the maximum CPC for search and content separately 
(see Figure BC1-10).
In Figure BC1-10, I’ve created five new ad groups. The top two will join the
AdTool campaign, the third inserts into LIG, the fourth into Gout, and the fifth
into Snoring. The ad group names follow the campaign names, and the num-
bers just after that indicate the default maximum CPC for each group. The
last group, Sleep Apnea, has two numbers: The first is the default maximum
CPC for search and the second is the same for content.
BC1-10 AdWords For Dummies 

The search feature is robust, as you might expect from Google. You can select
from dozens of criteria, as shown in Figure BC1-11. In this figure, I’m looking
for all ads related to Gout that include index1.htm in the destination URL.
This is very useful if I plan to change that URL on my Web site and want to
make sure I’m not paying for clicks to an error page.

This search returns 16 separate ad groups in two campaigns. Once I select
them all, I can replace the text index1.html with index3.htm in all 16
cases, within seconds (see Figure BC1-12).
Another exciting feature (if you get excited by the same things I do) of the
AdWords Editor is the Keyword Grouper, accessible from the Tools menu.
You can peel keywords with something in common from all the groups within
a campaign and put them into their own new ad group. In Figure BC1-13, the
editor will let me create a new group consisting of three keywords, each con-
taining the word tophi. I can create new ads for this group, or copy existing
ones.
In addition to letting you think up keywords, the editor also generates sug-
gestions when you click the Generate Common Terms button. This feature is
not so useful, unfortunately, since it includes words like And, For, Of and In,
and produced a list of thousands of poor choices. You’re better off thinking
about your keywords than sifting through a massive pile of data.

Ten Advanced Ad Writing Tips
from the Pros
In This Chapter
 Brainstorming unusual and compelling ads
 Breaking the rules to differentiate your ad
I
n Chapter 6, you can read the best practices for writing compelling and
effective AdWords ads. Sometimes, though, you need to break the rules in
order to follow a higher directive — such as don’t be boring or stand out.
AdWords and copywriting experts Perry Marshall, Don Crowther, and Bob Bly
share some of the techniques they use when everyone else in their market is
following the best practices.
Appealing to the Senses
Perry Marshall of www.perrysmarshall.com reminds us that AdWords ads
are very much like poetry, distilling complicated thoughts into a few words
and sounds. You want to write ads that allow readers to create their own sen-
sory responses, instead of just reading vague and abstract concepts. See
which ad comes alive more:
 Wide selection of colors
 Plum purple, lemon yellow, & more
Successful AdWords ads evoke an immediate emotional response in addition
to rational appeal. Neurolinguistic Programming practitioners identify three
modalities by which people take in the world: auditory, visual, and kines-
thetic (body). Ads that appeal to multiple modalities can trigger interest in a
wider range of readers.

Street Fighting Secrets
Smack. Slam. Splat.
Your Fist Against His Jaw
www.StreetFightingSecrets.com
This ad evokes sound in the second line and a body feeling and visual image
in the third line. (This ad might be disapproved by a Google editor because of
the violent image in the third line.)
Creating Ads that Stand Out Visually
Our eyes naturally focus on anything that breaks the prevalent pattern. If you
look at a tiled ceiling, it won’t take you long to find the one or two broken or
stained tiles, even without effort. For many generations, survival of our
species depended on noticing the unusual in our environment.
You can use this tendency to your advantage by creating ads that look differ-
ent from all the other listings on the page. Perry Marshall points to an ad that
uses lots of white space to attract the eye:
Get Love Back
-
-
www.GetLoveBack.com
The two description lines are blank, and draw the viewer’s attention more
powerfully than any words could. The remaining two lines repeat the same
sentiment, echoing and amplifying a powerful desire.
You can also use quotes, commas, hyphens, parentheses, question marks,
and other punctuation to add space and visual flair to your ads. Just remem-
ber to follow Google’s editorial guidelines (summarized in Chapter 6).
Testing Geographically Specific Ads
Don Crowther of www.greatresults.com suggests writing ads and landing
pages that speak directly to a geographic market. You can run geographically
specific ads in either of two ways:
 Create a geographically targeted campaign (see Chapter 7) and write
ads specific to that region. For example, your headline might read,
“Milwaukee Weight Loss.”
BC2-2 AdWords For Dummies 

 Use cities and states in your keywords. For example, create an ad group
devoted to Milwaukee Weight Loss, with keywords like
• Milwaukee weight loss
• Lose weight Milwaukee
• Wisconsin diet clinic
In either case, Don Crowther advises, “Write a landing page specific to the
challenges of weight loss in Milwaukee (cheese, beer, can’t walk out your
door six months of the year).”
Don notes that this is a great way to test expensive keywords where you don’t
want to put down $2,000 a day. When you restrict your campaign reach to a
couple of markets — Kansas City, Orlando, Portland OR, Burlington VT — you
can see meaningful results without having to pay thousands of dollars for an
onslaught of clicks. If this limited campaign proves profitable, you can open it
up to larger markets.
Naming Your Offer to Imply Value
When your call to action names the thing your visitor will get, make sure you
give it a name that implies value. Copywriter Bob Bly of www.bly.com offers
the following examples:
A product catalog becomes a product guide. A software catalog becomes 
an international software directory. A collection of brochures becomes a
free information kit. A checklist becomes a convention planner’s guide. 
An article reprinted in pamphlet form becomes “our new, informative
booklet — HOW TO PREVENT COMPUTER FAILURES.” And so on.
Bly focuses on the benefit the customer will receive, rather than the usual
name of the piece. Perry Marshall recommends that his industrial clients
create one-page Cheat Sheets that promise to simplify a complex subject
quickly. By split-testing different names for your offer, you can discover the
one that has the most appeal for your market.
Trying Something Crazy
Don Crowther advises AdWords advertisers to split-test, learn, and tweak ads
based on results. No amount of creativity can make up for listening to your
market. But Don also recommends that once a month, you put all that knowl-
edge aside and create a totally new ad from scratch. At the very worst, you’ll
BC2-3
Bonus Chapter 2: Ten Advanced Ad Writing Tips from the Pros

learn something new about what your market doesn’t respond to. At best,
you’ll discover a new hook or appeal that improves your conversions. Ad test-
ing is a closed environment: You write an ad and part of your market says Yes
or No to that ad. You can’t interview the people who didn’t click to find out
what they didn’t like and why. So the closest you can come to an open-ended
market survey using AdWords is to throw jokers into the mix every so often.
Don notes:
Most of the time, ten months out of the year, your new ad will fail. But two
months of the year, your ad will perform reasonably. Then, you can go and
apply all the other techniques you have learned and start kicking that ad up
to a higher level. You sometimes can end up with an ad that is way above
anything you have been able to test in the past.
You can think of ad testing as drilling for oil. After a while, you have a pretty
good idea where the big oil deposit sits, and you keep drilling holes in that
vicinity looking for the easiest access. That’s equivalent to detailed testing
based on prior results. What this type of testing doesn’t tell you is whether
there’s an even bigger oil deposit a thousand miles away. So every so often
you bring your drill to an area where you have no reason to expect success
and stick it in the ground. The speculative drill is your totally new and differ-
ent ad. You might strike it rich, and writing another ad is certainly quicker,
cheaper, safer, and more environmentally friendly than prospecting for fossil
fuels.
If you’re having ad writer’s block, type random keywords into Google and
model an ad for a totally unrelated market. Write a short poem. Create an ad
that sounds like a Valley Girl or a Hell’s Angels rider or Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Parody an ad from TV. Get your creative juices flowing and see what happens.
Fighting the Hype
Searchers are looking for the shortest distance between their desire and its
fulfillment. Much of the time, they want impartial expert advice before
making their purchase. If your competitors are screaming about how great
they are, your understated ad automatically makes you seem more trustwor-
thy. If you model your landing page after review sites, you can promise to
compare, review and educate your visitors about their options in your ad.
You can use questions:
Do stop-snoring gizmos work?
Ask me - I’ve bought them all.
And forced him to try them...
www.SnoringMansWife.com
BC2-4 AdWords For Dummies 

I just made that one up, but I like it so much I’m going to create a Web site
and AdWords campaign just to try it (as soon as I finish this book).
If your ad promises useful and impartial information, make sure that your land-
ing page delivers. Don’t begin to sell your solution until you’ve openly shared
the pros and cons of various options. You can use the consultative sales
approach in AdWords and your Web site to build trust and guide people —
honestly — about which solution most closely fits their needs. Your referral
traffic may exceed your AdWords traffic once you become known as a trusted
and credible source.
Using Jargon
A general rule of direct-marketing communication is to write and speak as if
you were trying to get an eight-year-old to understand your message. That
tactic is useful in some circumstances, but you will often get better results in
AdWords by speaking directly to the people who know as much about the
industry as you do. Bob Bly explains:
A major error is writing AdWords copy that speaks on a layman’s level
when your mailing is targeted to industry professionals. For example: 
DP professionals know what CICS, MVS, and ISDN are. You don’t — so the
natural tendency is to want to explain them in your copy. But being too
elementary turns readers off and signals that you’re not really in touch with
their business.
You don’t have to be selling to engineers or other professionals to employ
jargon. Every hobby, every business, every niche uses its own patois (wow, 
I learned that word for my SAT prep in 1982 and this is first time I’ve ever
used it) to speed up communication and make it more precise — among
those in the know.
Do you know what glow and ribbon poi are? If you were a serious juggler, you
would. And you would respond more favorably to this actual ad:
Need Juggling Balls?
Devilsticks, Diabolo Balls, Clubs
Glow, Fire & Ribbon Poi. Free Del!
www.oddballs.co.uk
than this one that I just made up:
Need Juggling Balls?
Balls, Bean Bags, and Other
Stuff You Can Throw in the Air
www.JugglingStuff.com
BC2-5
Bonus Chapter 2: Ten Advanced Ad Writing Tips from the Pros

People want to do business with people just like them. Jargon, acronyms, and
abbreviations function as social glue by eliminating people who don’t under-
stand them. If you spell out a phrase instead of using an acronym, you’re
subtly signaling that you aren’t talking to the in crowd. If you’re selling to
engineers, the more clearly you don’t talk to non-engineers, the more appeal-
ing your ad to your target market.
Pointing Out What Your Product Is Not
Sometimes the best way to explain what you are is to contrast it to what
you’re not. Perry Marshall points to a line in a coffee ad, “Want Cheap Coffee?
We’re Not It.” Another favorite of Perry’s uses sarcasm to differentiate:
Spanish? Oh, Please.
Just What You’ve Always Wanted:
Another Dopey Spanish Program.
www.LoserSpanish.com
Especially if the thing you’re not is a point of irritation for your market, you
can score points and compel clicks on the basis of curiosity alone.
Being contrarian in your ads works if you can pull it off on your Web site as
well. Jon Hinds advertises his Monkey Bar Gym as the alternative to ordinary
gyms: “100% Natural, Functional Training for Performance, Not Cosmetics.”
Everything about his site (www.monkeybargym.com) contrasts his training
methods with the big gyms: “We focus on movement, not on muscle. We don’t
have machines or mirrors. Anyone can kick your butt in a workout. Our work-
outs heal you.” Every industry has problems, and if you can articulate a fresh
solution that eliminates or minimizes those problems, you can create an
AdWords ad that hints at the difference in a compelling way.
Using Popular Culture
We live in a culture of mass media and celebrities. If you can quote a famous
person (real, fictional, or even animated), song, or movie line, you can get
people’s attention and stand out. Perry Marshall cites the following examples:
The California Hotel
Can Check Out Anytime You Like
But You Can Never Leave

BC2-6 AdWords For Dummies 

Spiral Staircases
“Climbing the Stairway to Heaven”
(She Bought It From Us)

“Go Ahead, Make My Day”
Dirty Harry’s Streetfighting Manual
For Hard, Leathery, Remorseless Men
www.DirtyHarryManual.com
Forgot Your Oil Change?
Homer’s Engine Locks Up – D’OH!
We Fix It
www.ApusCarRepair.com
Citing an inside joke like Homer Simpson’s tag phrase or a line from a famous
1970s song or movie serves to create some warmth in the relationship
between advertiser and customer; a way to bond rather than simply transact.
Also, like in the use of jargon, a reference that feels a little obscure (even if it
isn’t) can draw people together inside a circle of knowing. If your ad brings a
smile to someone’s face, that’s as good a reaction as you can hope for.
Making Your Content Ads Shocking
The easiest way to learn about content network, or AdSense ads, is to sign up
for a Gmail account at www.gmail.com and start sending yourself messages.
I’m not suggesting anything weird, like pretending to be yourself writing from
the future with warnings and advice. Instead, write a couple of words like
cookie dough or exercise equipment or Andalusian horses and send it to your-
self. When you receive the e-mail, look to the right for the sponsored listings.
These AdWords ads are the most successful ones for those keywords in the
content network (at least, they are the ones that make Google the most
money).
Perry Marshall points out that AdSense and search ads need to accomplish
totally opposite tasks: AdSense ads must interrupt the reader, while search
ads have to continue the thought that prompted the search. In your Gmail
experiment, you may see some ads that have nothing to do with the key-
words in your e-mail. Those ads are so successful at interrupting attention
that they compel clicks in just about any context.
BC2-7
Bonus Chapter 2: Ten Advanced Ad Writing Tips from the Pros

Make your content network ads more audacious. Two ever-present ads I see
in Gmail are the www.realage.com ad with the headline “Prepare to be
Shocked” and the www.coffeefool.com ad with the headline “Coffee
Exposed.” These ads show up next to e-mails having nothing to do with
health, aging, or coffee, so they must be very good at interrupting lots of
trains of thought.
Perry Marshall recommends learning Interruption Marketing from the head-
lines at the supermarket checkout counter. When you have a cart full of gro-
ceries and a screaming toddler pawing at a box of chocolate cereal you could
swear you put back on the shelf about five times, it takes a mighty good head-
line to interrupt your life and get you to open the magazine. Whether it’s a
Cosmopolitan headline tantalizing you with the ten things women wished men
knew in bed or the Star’s description of the Italian Prime Minister’s three-
headed alien love child, it has to arouse curiosity and at least some sense of
urgency.
Bob Bly of www.bly.com speaks about the Four U’s of good ad copy:
 Unique
 Urgent
 Ultra-Specific
 Useful
He recommends rating your ad on each U on a scale of 1–4, with 4 meaning
the ad is very strong for that characteristic. While each of the U’s are impor-
tant, the first two are more important for content ads, while the last two typi-
cally produce strong search ads.
