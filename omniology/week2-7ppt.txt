The Senses 
Hearing and the vestibular system

Sound waves are transmitted through air by the compression 
and expansion of air molecules in the form of pressure waves.  
  
Auditory system detects complex sounds and breaks them 
into their basic sound frequencies. Sound frequencies are 
converted to action potentials by the ear and relayed to the 
brain (auditory areas) for interpretation.

Pinna and external auditory canal  (air filled) focus sound waves on the tympanic membrane, which 
rocks the malleus, incus, and stapes (air filled), causing ripples in the cochlear fluid (fluid filled) and 
auditory transduction.

Middle ear amplifies sound waves & couples vibrations of tympanic membrane with oval window. Vibrations at 
oval window sets off the ripples in the cochlear fluid within the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. These ripples 
cause the basilar membrane to vibrate.

Stereocilia of hair cells are embedded in the tectorial membrane. As the basilar membrane bounces up & down, 
stereocilia bend.  Bending in one direction depolarizes the cell; in the other direction hyperpolarizes the cell.

After a hair cell (= receptor) activates the 
afferent neuron, axons from these neurons join 
to form the cochlear nerve. 
 
The region of the basilar membrane that 
vibrates the most correlates with the frequency 
of the sound. The louder the sound, the more 
vibration and the greater frequency of action 
potentials produced in the afferent neurons.

Sense of Balance: Vestibular System  
Two receptor organs in the inner ear sense movement of 
the head. 
They detect: 
 
- angular acceleration (shake or nod your head);  
 
- linear acceleration (elevator drops, or body leans to 
one side).  
 
Semicircular canals: respond to changes in head rotation. 
Otolith organs:  
     saccule detects vertical movement. 
     utricle detects horizontal movement.

OTOLITH ORGANS: sheets of hair cells that detect 
changes in linear acceleration or position of the  
head. Since the otoliths are heavier than the fluid 
around the hair cells, a change in position causes 
them to move and pull on the stereocilia  
 
otoliths – calcium carbonate crystals 
embedded in gel at the tips of stereocilia 
 
UTRICLE detects movement in the horizontal plane 
(acceleration during take off in a plane or car). 
 
SACCULE detects vertical movement (jumping). Cells 
are at a 90 degree angle compared to utricle.

Key Concepts 
 
 
The auditory system detects complex 
sounds and breaks them into their basic 
sound frequencies. The fundamental 
frequency components are transduced into 
action potentials and transmitted through 
the auditory pathways to the brain for 
interpretation.  
 
 
The vestibular system aids in maintaining 
the body’s balance by detecting the 
position and motion of the head in space. 
The sensory cells are in the ampullae of the 
semicircular canals and in the utricle and 
saccule.
