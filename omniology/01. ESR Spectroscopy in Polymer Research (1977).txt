Preface 
Thirty years ago, Zavoisky, in Moscow (USSR), reported the first successful experi-
mental observations of the ESR phenomenon. Its application to polymer problems 
began about 20 years ago. ESR belongs to the most specific and useful methods in 
the study of polymer reactions. 
The main purpose of this book is to collect the present available information on 
the applications of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in polymer research. 
The book has been written both for those who want an introduction to this field, 
and for those who are aheady familiar with ESR and are interested in application to 
polymers. Therefore, the fundamental principles of ESR spectroscopy are first out-
lined, the experimental methods including computer applications are described in 
more detail, and the main emphasis is on the application of ESR methods to polymer 
problems. Many results obtained are only briefly treated for lack of space. 
The authors hope that this book will provide a useful source of information by 
giving a coherent treatment and extensive references to original papers, reviews, and 
discussions in monographs and books. In this way we hope to encourage polymer 
chemists, organic chemists, biochemists, physicists, and material scientists to apply 
ESR methods to their research problems. 
Although we have carefully reviewed the literature, including a search of Chemi-
cal Abstracts for 1960-1975, it has not been possible to include all published papers 
on the subject matter treated. We apologize for inevitable omissions. We thank hun-
dreds of scientists who have responded to our request and sent us reprints of their 
publications. We also invite those who have more material to offer to send it or in-
form us about additional references. We would also appreciate the readers' remarks, 
and new material gathered will be considered for subsequent new editions.

Generation of Free Radicals 
1.1. Free Radicals, Biradicals, and Radical Ions 
Most reactions initiated by thermal energy, light, ,),-radiation, and mechanical forces involve the 
formation of free radicals. In such reactions a two-electron chemical bond is cleaved either sym-
metrically or unsymmetrically: 
A:B-A· + B· 
A:B--A+ + :B-
In reaction (1.1) free radicals are formed, whereas in reaction (1.2) ions are formed. 
(1.1) 
(1.2) 
A "free radical" is defined as an atom, a group of atoms, or a molecule in a certain state 
containing one unpaired electron which occupies an outer orbital, e.g. atomic hydrogen (H·), 
hydroxyl (HO'), or methyl (H3C·) radicals. Free radicals are usually very reactive an account of 
the strong tendency of their unpaired electrons to interact with other electrons and form electron 
pairs (chemical bond). 
Some common molecules contain an odd number of electrons in their normal state e.g. 
nitrous oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (N02), or chlorine dioxide (Cl02), and are, according to 
the above definition, free radicals although they may be stable and longlived. 
A "biradical" is a species containing two unpaired electrons in outer orbitals, e.g. methylene 
radical (H2C:) or oxygen (02) in its ground state. 
A "radical ion" is a free radical with positive or negative charge, e.g. protonated amine radi-
cal (H3N·+) or naphthalene anion (ClOH8·-). 
Some of the transition metal ions have unpa4ed electrons in their inner orbitals and have, 
therefore, some properties in common with free radicals. 
1.2. Basic Properties of Free Radicals 
An unpaired electron, as in a free radical, has magnetic properties due to the intrinsic angular 
momentum which is known as "the electron spin". The unpaired electron is a magnetic dipole 
which is assigned to a spinning motion of the electric charge. In a magnetic field, the electron 
spin has a tendency to align itself in the direction of the applied field by making a precession 
motion around an axis in the direction of the field. This is the basis for paramagnetic properties 
of matter. Very few stable molecules are paramagnetic because electrons have a tendency to form 
pairs with opposing (antiparallei) spins. The effect of this interaction is that the magnetic dipoles 
of the electrons cancel each other out. Only when a molecule contains an uneven number of 
electrons in the outer orbitals, e.g. NO, N02, and Cl02, or contains two electrons with parallel 
spins in its lowest energy state, e.g. molecular oxygen (02), does it have a magnetic moment. The 
theory of free radicals is presented in several publications96, 231, 769, 892, 894, 1435, 1710, 1769). 
Free radicals can be detected by measuring "Magnetic Susceptibility" and "Electron Para-
magnetic Resonance (EPR)" = "Electron Spin Resonance (ESR)". 
Recently, "Electron Spin Echo (ESE),,790, 1147, 1156, 1495, 1497, 1498) and "Chemi-
cally Induced Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (CIDNP),,141, 150-152, 162,677,681,1351,2384), 

1. Generation of Free Radicals 
have been applied to the study of free radicals in polymers and related problems. These methods 
will not be further discussed here, as both measured effects, ESE and CIDNP, do not belong to 
ESR spectroscopy. 
1.3. Free Radical Reactions 
Typical free radical reactions are chain reactions which occur in three steps: 
1. "The initiation step" is a radical formation process, e.g. the radicals are formed in pairs 
by homolytic cleavage of a two-electron bond (1.1). 
2. "The propagation step" is a transfer reaction of free radicals in which the site of free 
radical is changed. There are four types of propagation reactions: 
1. "Atom transfer reactions", e.g. abstraction of hydrogen by a free radical: 
A·+RH-AH+R· 
(1.3) 
2. "Addition reactions", involving the addition of free radical to a double bond: 
A· + C=C- A-C-C· 
(1.4) 
This type of reaction is the basis for the free radical polymerization and is known as "the 
chain propagation step". 
3. "Fragmentation reactions". A typical example of these reactions is known as the 
"/3-scission", in which an unpaired electron in a molecule splits a bond in (3 position and 
produces a free radical and a molecule containing a double bond: 
(1.5) 
4. "Rea"angement reactions", in which a free radical changes position in a molecule, giving

3. "Termination reactions" which occur in all systems where free radicals are present. There 
are two types of termination reactions: 
1. "Combination" of two radicals: 
R·+R·-R-R 
(1. 7) 
2. "Disproportionation" e.g. involving the transfer of hydrogen: 
R· + RCHz-CHR- R-H + RCH=CHR 
(1.8) 
Both (1.7) and (1.8) are common termination reactions in free radical polymerization. 
1.4. Interaction of Electromagnetic Radiation with Matter 
When electromagnetic radiation passes through matter its intensity decreases, primarily as a 
result of scattering and energy absorption by some of the irradiated molecules. The radiation 
chemist may use two types of electromagnetic radiation: 
1. Low energy photons (visible and ultraviolet radiation). 
2. High energy photons (X-ray and gamma radiation). 
2 

1.4. Interaction of Electromagnetic Radiation with Matter 
1.4.1. Interaction of Low Energy Photons with Matter 
These processes are investigated in "photochemical research,,255, 256, 381, 485, 492, 687,761, 
762,1077,1295,1298,1335,1445,1623,1814,1928, 2014, 2316, 2317, 2396, 2399). 
Molecules in their ground state, i.e. their lowest energy state, may absorb low-energy 
photons and form "excited singlet states" (S1, S1, S3 ... ). In a singlet state the spins of the 
electrons are paired. The main photochemical reactions occur from the lowest excited singlet 
state (S 1). The very fast rate of internal conversion (1011 to 1014 s-1) from high excited states 
(S2, S3 ... ) to the lowest excited singlet state (S1) makes photochemical reactions involving 
higher states unlikely (Fig. 1.1).

Fig. 1.1. Modified diagram for the most important processes involving electronically excited 
states and preionization states 
The lowest excited triplet state (T1) is mainly formed by a radiationless transition (intersystem 
crossing) from the lowest excited singlet state (S 1). The formation of a triplet state by direct 
absorption of a photon is a forbidden transition. In the triplet state the spins of electrons are 
unpaired. Higher triplet states (T2, T3 ... ) may only be formed when a molecule in its lowest 
triplet state (T 1) absorbs a new photon. 
A necessary condition for a photochemical reaction is the absorption by a molecule of a 
light quantum of sufficient energy. A photochemical reaction usually occurs in two stages: 
1. "The primary photochemical reaction" which is directly due to the absorbed light quan-
tum and involves electronically excited states (singlet or triplet). 
2. "Secondary (dark) reaction" of the various chemical species as molecules, ions with free 
radicals, which are produced by the primary photochemical reactions. 
The bond dissociation energies are listed in Table 1.1, whereas the energies of light quanta 
(photons) of different wavelengths are shown in Table 1.2. 
It is seen that bond energies in common polymers are in the energy range of low-energy pho-
tons. When a polymer molecule absorbs a photon, it is usually expected that a particular bond may 
dissociate with the formation of free radicals. The majority of polymers contain only C-C, C-H, 
C-O, C-N, and C-CI bonds. They are therefore not expected to absorb photons of wavelength 
longer than 1900 A. The fact that free radicals are formed after irradiation of many polymers

for the absorption of light quanta and act as photo sensitizers 1 777, 1779, 1782-1785, 1814).

1.5. Interaction of Charged Particles with Matter 
1.4.2. I nteraction of High Energy Photons with Matter 
These processes are investigated in "radiation chemistry,,106, 241, 250, 359, 430-432, 437, 
505,566,844,907,980,1224,1233,1599,2062,2102, 2410, 2414, 2434). There are three 
ways in which high-energy photons can transfer their energy to matter: 
1. "A photoelectric process", which involves complete absorption in a single step of a high-
energy photon (hv) by the sample. In this process electrons may subsequently be rejected from 
the systems with an energy (E) given by the equation: 
E = hv - Ee 
(1.9) 
where Ee is the electron binding energy. The ejected electrons have an angular distribution which 
is energy-dependent. At low photon energies, the electrons are ejected mainly at 90° to the path 
of the incident high-energy photons. When the photon energy rises, ejection in the forward direc-
tion occurs with increased probability. 
2. "Compton scattering" occurs when the energy of the incident photons increases above 
10 keV. This process involves an elastic collision of high-energy photon (hv) with an electron 
(Fig. 1.2). 
hv 
Fig. 1.2. The Compton scattering process 
The energy of the scattered photon (hv') is represented by the equation: 
hv' = 
hv 
(1 - cos 0) 
1 + hv/mc2 
(1.10) 
where m is the stationary electron mass, c is the velocity of light, and @ is the angle between the 
incident and scattered photons. 
3. "Pair production" occurs when the high-energy photons (hv) have an energy equal to at 
least 1 MeV. The energy is annihilated in the field of a nucleus with high atomic number to 
produce an electron-positron pair. Since the polymers usually contain only atoms of low atomic 
numbers, this process is of little importance in the radiation chemistry of polymers. 
1.5. I nteraction of Charged Particles with Matter 
These ~rocesses also belong to "radiation chemistry"180, 469, 553, 762, 1223, 1224, 1407, 
1824, 177,2410,2414). Of interest ,are mainly two types of charged particles: 
1. Electrons with a negative charge, 
2. Protons with a positive charge. 
"Electrons" are more heavily charged particles than protons. They can lose their energy by 
means of a transfer of energy to molecular electrons. When the amount of energy transferred to 
a molecular electron is lower than its lowest ionisation potential, it may still'be sufficiently large 
5 

1. Generation of Free Radicals 
to displace the electron from its ground state to "a preionization state". In other words, excited 
molecules are created through direct radiation-chemical interaction: 
(1.11) 
These states are similar to the corresponding excited states produced by absorption of a light 
quantum in the same medium absorption (Fig. 1.1): 
M+hv'~M* 
(1.12) 
It may be assumed that the subsequent reactivity of such excited molecules (M*) is the same 
whether the excitation is brought about by a photochemical or a radiation-chemical act. This 
assumption is supported by experimental evidence. In many chemical compounds, including 
polymers, the products of photolysis are at least quantitatively similar to the products of radio-
lysis. The difference between the products of photolysis and those of radiolysis may be accounted 
for by the formation in the latter case of a charge separation and energy transfer to suitable 
molecule (D) of lower ionization potential. Figure 1.3 summarizes the various processes leading 
to charge separation and excited-state formation in the radiation chemistry of liquids and 
solids2414, 1415).

When the incident particle is a slow electron which has not enough energy to excite the pre-
ionization states of irradiated molecule, it may still be capable of exciting low-lying states dif-
fering in multiplicity from the ground state (i.e. triplet state) through a forbidden transition 
(Fig. 1.1): 
M + slow electron ~ 
M* (triplet) 
(1.13) 
Such triplet states do not usually possess enough energy to dissociate by breaking chemical bonds. 
But since these states possess two unpaired electrons, the chemical behavior of triplet states is 
analogous to that of biradicals. 
The triplet states may moreover produce chemical rearrangements. The number of excita-
tions to triplet state caused by slow electrons represent as much as 15% of the total number of 
ionizations. All electrons ejected from the molecules of the irradiated sample lose their kinetic

1.6. Physical Sources of Free Radicals 
energy by ionizing and exciting other particles along their path. In a substance which is incapable 
of capturing slow electrons, the only reaction is the neutralization of positive ions. However, if 
the substance contains traces of impurities having high electron affinity, the impurities may 
capture the majority of slow electrons and various important reactions may be observed, e.g. 
energy transfer processes. 
High energy electrons produce not only excited states but also ionized states in atoms and 
molecules. In this way positive radical ions ("free radical cations") are produced which are 
formed when electrons leave their orbital, e.g.: 
(1.14) 
"Protons" - positively charged particles in the energy range below 10 MeV - interact with 
matter mainly electrostatically. These interactions depend upon the distance of approach to the 
particular molecular electron, the impact parameter, and the velocity with which the encounter 
takes place. The application of positively charged particles in radiation chemistry of polymers 
has not yet aroused much interest. 
1.S. Physical Sources of Free Radicals 
1.6.1. Ionizing Radiation 
There are three main categories of ionizing radiation devices developed and used in practice435 , 
567,1055): 
1. Charged particle accelators. 
2. Radioisotope sources. 
3. Nuclear reactors. 
1.6.1.1. Charged Particle Accelerators 
There are a few types of these devices: 
1. "Van der Graaff accelerators" are of different constructions. The 3 MeV (million electron 
volts) Van der Graaff accelerator is especially useful for radiation chemistry. This device produces 
electrons of variable energy from less than 1 to 3 MeV with beam currents from about 10 }.LA to 
a maximum of 1 mA1381). 
2. "Medium energy electron accelerators" produce an electron beam in the wide range 
(Table 1.3), with an output of electron of the order of several miliampers when driven by a 
klystron power source and a radio frequency power feedback is applied. 
This type of accelerator operates in a pulsed manner at the rate of several hundred pulses per 
second and a pulse duration from nsec to msec. 
3. "X-ray generators". There are several commercial types of low-energy electromagnetic 
radiation sources. They produce X-rays in the energy range of 40-300 eV. 
1.6.1.2. Radioisotope Sources 
There are two commercial sources of the ionizing radiation for research in the field of radiation 
chemistry: cobalt-60 and cesium-137180). 
1. Cobalt-60 emits -y-radiation with the half-life of the order of 5.2 years and the average 
energy of 1.25 MeV. 
2. Cesium-137 also emits -y-radiation with the energy of 0.66 MeV and the half·life of about 
30 years.

1. Generation of Free Radicals 
3. Spent fuel elements from nuclear reactors have also been used as radiation sources. They 
change their radiation characteristics with time, on account of the different decay rates of the 
various fission products. 
1.6.1.3. Nuclear Reactors 
They provide a very intense mixed radiation of gamma quanta and neutrons. For that reason 
nuclear reactors have no wide application in the radiation chemistry. 
1.6.2. Light Irradiation 
To initiate photochemical reactions electromagnetic radiation in the range 2000-3000 A is 
usually applied. Emission spectra and the intensity of emitted light radiation depend on the con-
struction of light sOUIceS. Extensive description of the characteristics of a variety of commercial 
lamps used in photochemical research is given in several publications381 , 864, 1176, 1179, 1814). 
Experimental techniques in vacuum ultraviolet (1000-2000 A) are seldom applied in poly-
mer research and require special light sources381 , 1279, 1450). 
1.6.3. Other Physical Sources for the Production of Free Radicals 
Other sources for the production of free radicals include silent electric discharge, radio frequency 
discharge, and field ionization358, 489,1452), and mechanical forces accompanying milling, 
stretching, breakage, etc. may bring forward the formation of free radicals. 
1.7. Chemical Sources for the Production of Free Radicals 
There are hundreds of different chemical reactions used to produce free radicals for research. One 
of the most widely applied in ESR research is the redox reaction obtained by mixing aqueous 
hydrogen peroxide and titanium trichloride (See Chapter 4.6.3). The hydroxyl radicals (HO·) 
are the main species formed which react further, e.g. by abstraction: 
Ti3+ + H20 2 -
Ti4+ + HO· + HO-
HO· + RH -
R· + H20 
(1.15) 
(1.16) 
Another example is the formation of free radical anions (negative radial ions) by one-electron 
transfer reduction of an organic compound, e.g. formation of a colored naphthalene ion in the 
reaction of naphthalene with sodium (see Chapter 4.7.1):

Principles of ESR Spectroscopy 
2.1. Introduction 
This chapter presents the background, nomenclature, and theory of ESR spectroscopy. It is 
written as a necessary introduction for readers who are not familiar with the ESR techniques 
and ESR literature. The basic interpretation of ESR spectra requires understanding of quantum 
·mechanics and the use of matrix, vector, and tensor calculations. We have attempted to present 
this material with a minimum of mathematical treatment. Polymer chemists who are interested 
in carrying out experiments in ESR spectroscopy are advised to improve their knowledge by 
reading some of the review papers20, 87, 105, 147,291, 333, 448, 554, 556, 585, 595, 648,

and monographs33, 40, 84, 89,107,109,217,234,394,472,625,758-760,886,894,898,

Examples of hundreds of ESR spectra of different organic free radicals and radical ions are col-
lectes in Atlas of Electron Spin Resonance Spectra222).

2.2. Interaction Between the Electron Spin and Internal Magnetic Field 
The electrons in atoms and molecules form pairs. For each electron in a certain orbital with the 
spin quantum number 
there is another electron in the same orbital with the spin quantum number 
The paired electrons do not give an ESR signal. An unpaired electron has no other electron as 
partner in the same orbital, and for that reason it gives an ESR signal. 
The electron is characterized by its rest mass m = (9.109558 ± 0.000054) x 10-28 g, 
charge e = (4.803250 ± 0.000021) x 1O-10 esua), intrinsic angular momentum, and its magnetic 
moment.

2. Principles of ESR Spectroscopy 
"The intrinsic angular momentum of the electron" is known as the spin vector with the 
symbol (S)b). The values of its component in any direction are ±! h, where 
2 
h = ~ 
= (1.0545919 ± 0.0000080) x 10-27 erg s 
211" 
and h is Planck's constant h = (6.626196 ± 0.0000050) x 10-27 erg s. 
"The magnetic moment vector for the unbonded electron" <JIe)c) is related to the spin 
vector (S) by the following equation: 
(2.1) 
where g is dimensionless constant called "the Lande g-factor" or "electron free-spin g factor" 
~ = 2.0023192778 ± 0.0000000062, f3e is "the Bohr magneton" 
f3e = ~ 
= (9.274096 ± 0.000065) x 10-21 erg G-1 
2 mc 
where c is velocity of light 
c = (2.997925 ± 0.000010) x 1010 cm s-l. 
(2.2) 
The minus in eq. 2.1 indicates that the vector of the magnetic moment (Ile) of the electron is in 
opposite direction to the spin vector (S). 
When an electron is in a magnetic field (H), its magnetic moment vector CIle) has two possible 
orientations (Fig. 2.1), which correspond to the two possible orientations of the spin vector (S); 
parallel and antiparallel to the applied magnetic field H. 
The angle (8) between the magnetic moment vector CIle) of an electron and the direction of the 
magnetic field (H) can have only two possible values: 350 i5' and 1440 45'. The orientation in

2.2. Interaction Between the Electron Spin and Internal Magnetic Field 
which the magnetic moment is antiparallel to the field is the orientation of maximum energy. 
The electron energy (E) in the magnetic field (H) is given by the equation: 
(2.3) 
where P.e is the electron magnetic moment (vector) (erg G- 1) and H* is the magnetic field 
(vector) (G). Substituting eq. (2.1) into eq. (2.3) we obtain: 
E = &,PeSH (erg) 
(2.4) 
The spin quantum number (MS) of one electron is 1/2: the spin vector (8) in a magnetic 
field can have one of the two possible values: + 1/2 and -1/2. It follows that the energy of an 
electron in a magnetic field (H) is either 
(2.5) 
or

2. Principles of ESR Spectroscopy 
(H), whose quanta (hv) have an energy equal to gepeH, induce transition between the two states 
of the electron: 
(2.8) 
where v is the frequency of the radio waves (cycles s-1). Microwaves have wavelengths from a 
millimeter to a meter. A commonly used X-band spectrometer operates at about 3 em wave-
length corresponding to a frequency of about 9500 Mc s-l, which requires a magnetic field (H) 
about 3400 G. The shorter wavelengths of the Q-band spectrometer have a frequency of about 
35000 Mc s-1, and the magnetic field (H) of 12500 G. The Q-band spectrometer is commonly 
used for studies at very low temperatures. 
Only electromagnetic waves with the frequency 
v = gePeH 
h 
contain the right amount of energy to produce transition between the two energy states of the 
electrons. This coincidence of the energy of the microwave quantum (hv) and the energy differ-
ence between the two states of the electron (&) is called resonance. 
2.3. Spin Relaxation 
The ESR emission or absorption can only be detected when there is a popUlation difference 
between the two spin levels. The transition between the two energy levels 
E1 (Ms = +~) andE2 (Ms = -1) 
can occur by either emission on absorption. The rates of both processes are proportional to: 
1. The popUlation of the state considered, 
2. The microwave energy density, 
3. The square of the transition matrix element. 
The microwaves of the oscillating magnetic field (hv) induce two types of transition: 
1. From the upper state (E1) to the lower state (E2) (the emission process) 
2. From the lower state (E2) to the upper state (E1) (the absorption process) 
When the unpaired electron popUlation is equally divided between the upper N (E 1) population 
and the lower N (E2) population, the emission of microwave quanta is higher than the absorption 
of these quanta, and no observable signal is obtained. When the popUlation of the unpaired elec-
trons is higher in the state (~) than in the state (E1) a radio frequency absorption is observed. 
These arguments also apply to the electron and nuclear spins (see Chapter 2.6). The ratio of the 
two populations in thermal eqUilibrium is determined by the Boltzmann equation: 
(2.9) 
where k is the Boltzmann constant k = 1,38044 x 10-16 erg degree- 1• 
The ESR signal recorded in an ESR spectrometer increases with increasing ratio N(E2)/N(E1), 
because the absorption more and more predominates over the emission. The signal intensity is 
also increased when the temperature decreases. 
The popUlation difference Lin is expressed by the equation: 
14 

2.3. Spin Relaxation 
LIn 
(2.10) 
where N is the total number of unpaired electrons in both populations: N = N (E1) + N (E2). 
The signal intensity is directly proportional to the quantity .6.n, which varies inversely to the 
absolute temperature. For that reason the intensity of the absorption signal at liquid nitrogen 
temperature (77 K) is approximately four times higher than at room temperature (300 K). 
The probability of the transition between the energy levels El and E2 is proportional to the 
microwave energy density. With increasing incident microwave energy, the ESR signal intensity 
increases to a maximum. Further increase of power decreases and broadens the signal up to a 
moment when the signal completely disappears. This is the result of a saturation process, where 
the population N 1 (E1) is equal to N2 (E2). The return of the system to equilibrium is called a 
"relaxation process". Such processes are exponential and characterized by "relaxation times". 
One of the processes which restores the equilibrium ratio of N (E 1) and N (E2) consists of 
"the spin-lattice" interaction with the relaxation time (T 1). This process involves thermal equilib-
rium of the spin system with the vibration of the crystal lattice. Another important process which 
influences the eqUilibrium ratio is "the spin-spin interaction" with the relaxation time (T 2)51). 
It involves the decay to random condition of the spin phase coherence in the microwave magnetic 
field, which oscillates in the xy plane. The calculation of the relaxation times T 1 and T 2 is neces-
sary for the study of transition probabilities between the two spin levels, and it presents a rather 
difficult problem 95, 404, 977, 989). Spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times also provide a 
means of distinguishing the molecular movements in the crystalline phase from those in the 
amorphous regIons of polymers 724, 841, 1964).

spectrometers which usually record directly the absorption spectra, the ESR spectrometers draw 
at once "the first derivative of the energy absorption curves" (Figs. 2.3b and 2.4b). 
This curve is obtained by varying of the magnetic field and measuring the corresponding variation 
of energy absorption. It is often of considerable interest to obtain "the second derivative of the 
energy absorption spectra" by tuning the amplifier to double modulation frequency (Figs. 2.3c 
and 2.4c). The shape of the second-derivative recordings is very sensitive to the nature of the 
absorption line. 
2.4.1. Line Shape 
There are two important types of line shape in the ESR absorption curves: "Lorentzian line 
shape" and "Gaussian line shape". The main difference between the two types of line shape is 
that the outer wings of the Lonrentzian line are much longer and drop more slowly than those 
of the Gaussian on (Figs. 2.3 and Fig. 2.4). Measurable experimental parameters characterizing 
the two types of spectral lines are given in Table 2.1. 
In several cases the shape of an absorption line is a mixture of the two types51). The mathemati-
cal description of the exact shape of an absorption line is very complicated. There are two methods 
which simplify this treatment and distinguish the two types: 
1. "The slope of the derivative curve", presented in Figure 2.5 1357). 
For a Gaussian curve the ratio of slopes a: b = 2.2 and for a Lorentzian curve a: b = 4. 
2. "The normalization plot" is shown in Figure 2.6986).

In this method, the base line is divided into units of m, where m is the point on the abscissa 
where the curve reaches a maximum, and the ordinates are normalized to unity. 
2.4.2. Line Width 
ESR lines measured under specified conditions have a finite "width". There are two usual ways 
of expressing line width: 
18 
l. ''The half width at half-height (.6H1/ 2) of the absorption line (Figs. 2.3 and 2.4 and 
Table 2.1). 
2. "Peak-to-peak width" (.6Hpp)-the full width between the extremes of the Iust-derivative 
curve (Figs. 2.3 and 2.4 and Table 2.1). 

2.4. The Shape of ESR Resonance Lines 
The width is influenced not only by interaction between the electron spin and the external 
magnetic field applied, but also by interaction of the electron spin with the environment inside 
the sample. This fact allows to obtain information about the spin environment from the line 
width. Typical environment effects are, for example, electron spin exchange between molecules 
and crystal lattice vibration. ESR lines can be broadened homogeneously when all spins have the 
same environment (Fig. 2.7 a) and broadened inhomogeneously when spins are in different 
environments (Fig. 2.7 b). 
a 
b 
Fig. 2.7. Hole burning in inhomogenously broadened line: a. Initial line, b. Localized saturation 
develops and appears as a hole 
In the last case a selective saturation of some particular popUlation of spins, for which the inten-
sity becomes zero, is observed. The resonance line shows typical "holes", and the process is called 
"burning a hole,,230). Most of the recorded ESR spectra are inhomogeneously broadened. This 
effect may be caused by irregularities in the external magnetic field and also by heterogeneities 
in the sample. Most powdered samples, for example, show anisotropies in the dipolar interaction 
which alters the inhomogeneous broadening. Similar effects are observed when there are impuri-
ties in the sample or when a single crystal contains lattice defects. In solution inhomogeneously 
broadened lines are due to the viscosity of the liquid phase. 
The width of homogeneously broadened lines is determined by the equation: 
(2.11) 
where ~Hl/2 is the line width (G), At is the lifetime of spin state (sec), ~E is the difference in 
energy between the two electron levels. It is seen from Eq. 2.11 that increase of the lifetime of a 
state results in a decrease of line width. When a sufficient amount of microwave power is added 
to the sample the lifetime of the spin state decreases and a broadening of the absorption line 
(Fig. 2.8) is produced. 
----
increasing of microwave power

19 

2.4. Principles of ESR Spectroscopy 
This process is known as "saturation broadening". In the recording of a spectrum a wide line is 
much more difficult to detect than a narrow line of the same intensity. 
The width of lines is dependent on the symmetry of the radicals examined 1441, 1442). The 
reduction in the symmetry of the radical leads to weakening of the spin-orbital coupling and to 
an increase in the spin-lattice relaxation time, and consequently to narrowing of the lines. 
2.4.3. Intensity 
The intensity (I) of the absorption line as a function of the outer magnetic field (H) for Lorentzian 
and Gaussian line shape is given by the equations: 
I = 
10 
Lorentzian shape 
T~(H-Hr)2 + 1 
(2.12) 
) 2 2 
I = 10e-b(H-Hr 
T 2 
Gaussian shape 
(2.13) 
where 10 is the intensity of the absorption line at its center, Hr is the field of resonance at the 
line center, T2 is the spin-spin relaxation time, b is a constant. 
The integrated intensity of the ESR signal represents the total energy absorbed by the sample 
at resonance conditions. This intensity is expressed by the total area under the resonance curve 
and it can be used for the determination of the concentration of free radicals in the sample as 
the number of unpaired spins per gram or per milliliter. 
2.5. g-Value 
Various ESR spectrometers use different frequencies and various types of samples require dif-
ferent frequencies for the experiment. For that reason the position of ESR lines cannot be indi-
cated by the frequencies. The line position are instead denoted in terms of "g-value", which is 
expressed as a function of microwave frequency (v) and outer magnetic field (H) at resonance. 
From Eq. 2.8 we obtain the conditions for the resonance of an electron spin: 
(2.14) 
As mentioned before the ~ value of a free electron is 2.002322, whereas the g-values for free 
radicals in atoms, molecules, and crystals depend on their electronic structure. A compilation of 
g-values published up to March 1964 have been collected by Fischer in Landolt-Bornstein 
Tables667) (a new edition will be published in 1977) and in other publicationsSS9, 2179, 2180). 
The application of a double cavity in the ESR apparatus simplifies the measurement of 
g-values. Special standard compounds with precisely determined g-value are used as reference 
(see Chapter 3.3). These standard compounds are inserted into the double cavity and their 
spectra are recorded by a dual-channel recorder. The separation of the centers of the two spectra 
represents the magnetic field difference at the two positions of the sample. One of the standard 
samples is replaced by a sample to be examined and the field difference (AH) (corrected for the 
standard sample field difference) between the centers of the ESR spectra is measured. The g-value 
of the unknown sample (gu) can be calculated from the equation: 
(2.15) 
where gs is the g-value of the known standard sample and H is the external magnetic field. De-
tailed descriptions of measurements and necessary corrections have been given1149, 1909, 1930). 
20 

2.5. g-Value 
For various reasons, studies of the ESR spectra of randomly oriented radicals in a solid are 
likely to provide a less detailed picture of their structure and electron distribution than studies 
of radicals in single crystals or in solution. There are many systems, e.g. polymers and frozen 
aqueous systems at low temperature, where studies of single crystals or in solution are not pos-
sible so that polycrystalline or amorphous matrices must be used. For that reason, studies of 
randomly oriented radicals are still the most common in ESR spectroscopy of polymers. 
In single crystals the g-value is dependent on the direction of the external magnetic field in 
relation to the crystallographic or molecular axes, e.g. x, y, and z. Consequently in polycrystal-
line samples (powdered samples) a set of gl, g2 and g3 values (Fig. 2.9) is necessary to define the 
anisotropy of the g-value, which can be expressed by the following equation 1164):

2. Principles of ESR Spectroscopy 
where 4> and e are the polar angles of the field direction with respect to the coordinate system 
of the principal directions of the g-tensor. 
With Ho in the g1g3 plane the observed g-factor varies sinusoidally with e, passing through the 
value of g2. Similarly for all angles 4> of Ho with respect to the glg3 plane there is a value of e 
for which the observed g-factor is equal to g2. For crystals having axial symmetry, expressions 
gil (crystal axis parallel to Ho) and g.l (crystal axis perpendicular to Ho) are commonly used 
(Fig. 2.10). 
g-Value varies sinusoidally from gil to g.l with variation in e. The anisotropy ofthe g-value causes 
an asymmetry of the ESR absorption line (Figs. 2.11 and 2.12)1024, 1034, 1164, 1343, 1895). 
The idealized shapes shown in continous lines arise because there is a whole plane of orientations 
with the magnetic field perpendicular to the symmetry axis, but only one orientation with the 
magnetic field in the parallel position. For the nonsymmetrical system there is similarly a plane 
of orientations for which the g-value corresponds to the intermediate value g2, but only one 
orientation each for gl and g3. More realistic line-shapes are obtained by including broadening 
corresponding to random Gaussian distribution of neighboring dipoles, which are mainly the 
nuclei of neighboring molecules. The resulting shapes for the absorption and first derivative 
curves are shown as dotted lines in Figures 2.11 and 2.12. The interpretation of ESR spectra of 
free radicals in the crystalline solid state requires a detailed understanding of the nature of aniso-
tropic interactions. 
For free radicals in solution the g-value is shifted and measured as an average value229, 1018, 
1164,1536). The deviation of the g-value of an organic radical from that of a free electron gives 
significant information. The g-value depends upon the type of free radical, e.g. the g-value for a 
peroxy radical R02· is higher than that for an alkyl radical R·. 
2.6. Interaction Between the Electron and the Nuclear Spins 
The magnetic interaction between the electron and the nuclear spins in the same molecule gives 
an ESR spectrum with a number of lines instead of one single line. This type of interaction is 
called "hyper fine coupling" and produces ESR spectra with "hyper fine splitting,,21 79, 2180). 
By analyzing the number of lines, their separation, and their relative intensities it is usually pos-
sible to determine the type and number of nuclear spins which interact with the electron, i.e. the 
structure of the free radical. The line separation depends on the interaction between the electron 
spin and each nuclear spin, and on the magnetic moments of the involved nuclei. From the num-
ber of absorption lines in the hyperfine ESR spectrum and their relative intensities, it is possible 
to identify the number of equivalent nuclei in the molecule and to determine the structure. 
"The spin angular moment vector of a nucleus" (I)a) and its magnetic moment vector (#-IN) 
is given by the equation:

The nuclear spins of many nuclei are listed in Table 2.2. 
The spin angular moments (I) in the external magnetic field have the restricted orientations: 
I, I - 1, I - 2 ... -I. In this way, the nuclei have a limited number of spin quantum numbers 
Ml = 2 I + 1, i.e. they splif an electron magnetic level into 2 I + 1 sublevels. 
The magnetic momenf of the electron (#-Ie) is about thousand times larger than the magnetic 
moment of the nuclei (#-IN)' The applied external magnetic field (H) is normally many times 
larger than the local magnetic field at the electron produced by the nuclei. In a strong external 
field, the magnetic interaction is influenced by the interaction between the electron and the 
nucleus, the so-called "contact interaction". This interaction is determined by the "isotropic 
hyperfine coupling constant" (A) (measured in Hertz = cycles s-l). 
There are two other kinds of hyperfine interactions 721): 
1. "Dipolar hyper fine interaction" which is caused by the presence of a nucleus near the 
electron but not just in the immediate vicinity of the electron. 
2. "Fermi contact interaction" which is referred as electrostatic interaction of electron and 
nucleus. It is proportional to the electron density at the nucleus. 
The last two kinds of hyperfine interaction will not be further discussed here. They are well-
treated in the basic monographs on ESR spectroscopy. 
2.6.1. Hyperfine Structure Spectrum due to a Single Proton 
In the external magnetic field, the magnetic moment of the proton has two possible orientations 
± 1/2, which affect the magnetic energy levels of an electron (E1 and E2) and split them into four 
sublevels (El> En, Em and ElY)' This process is called "the Zeeman hyperfine splitting" for 
proton (Figs. 2.13a and 2.13b). 
First-order splitting of the lines occurs when the hyperfine coupling constant energy (hA) is very 
much smaller than the electron energy (gei3eH). The transition between four sublevels El> En, 
ElIl and ElY gives the "hyperfine spectrum", but there are certain selection rules which deter-
mine the possible transitions between various levels. The allowed transitions are (Figs. 2.13a and 
2.13b): 
1. Between energetic levels El and ElY and levels Ell and Ell!> because they require the 
absorption or emission of energy and change in angular momentum by the electron only. 
2. Between energetic levels El and En and levels Elll and ElY, because they require the 
absorption or emission of energy and change in angular momentum by the nucleus only.

2.6. Interaction Between the Electron and the Nuclear Spins 
Transition between energetic levels EI and Enl and levels En and EIV are not allowed 
because they require a simultanous absorption or emission of energy by both the electron and 
the nucleus. In conclusion the selection rules give: 
1. The allowed transitions for: L1MS = ± 1 and L1MI = 0, 
2. The forbidden transitions for: L1MS = ± 1 and L1MI = ± 1. 
At a constant external magnetic field (Fig. 2.13a), the transition from level EIV to level EI occurs 
at a higher frequency than the transition from level Enl to level En. The difference between the 
two frequencies is called "the hyperfine frequency" (L1v) and is equal to A. 
At a constant frequency (Fig. 2.13 b), the transition from level EI to level EIV occurs at a 
lower magnetic field than the transition from level En to level Enl. 
In the commercial spectrometers, the microwave frequency is maintained constant but the 
magnetic field is varied. In this case the energy (L1E = hv) of the transition between energy 
levels EI - EIV and En - Em must be equal: 
hVJ-IV = hVJI-I1I = hv 
(2.19) 
In a constant magnetic field the transition in energy differs by the isotropic hyperfine coupling 
constant (A):

(2.22) 
The value .o.H = a is called "hyper fine splitting constant" and expresses in gauss (G) the separa-
tion between the two hyperfine lines of the spectrum (Fig. 2.13 b). 
In the case when there is no nuclear interaction (A = 0), the transition for the electron 
(S 
1/2) occurs at one resonance field (1\) (Fig. 2.2): 
(2.23) 
When the magnetic moment of an unpaired electron (S = 1/2) is affected by the magnetic field 
of a nucleus with I = 1/2 (proton), the transition occurs at two resonance fields (Fig. 2.13b): 
for MI = + 1/2, 
(2.24) 
(2.25) 
For the system with S = 1/2 and I = 1 (the iH-deuterium), the transition occurs at three 
resonance fields (Figs. 2.14a and 2.14 b):

Generally speaking, for a system where a single nucleus interacts with one unpaired electron, 
2 I + 1 lines of equal intensity are obtained. They are separated by the constant hyperfine split-
ting (a). Using the hyperfine splitting constant (a) we can express the hyperfine coupling fre-
quency (.o.v) as: 
(2.29) 
for g = 2 
.o.v = 2.8a (Mc s-1) 
(2.30) 
2.6.2. Spectra with Hyperfine Structure due to Equivalent Protons 
In the majority of free radicals the unpaired electron interacts with a number of magnetic nuclei, 
producing spectra with several lines. When a free radical interacts with n equivalent nuclei of 
spin I, the number of levels for each MS value is 2 nI + 1.

2.6. Interaction Between the Electron and the Nuclear Spins 
When one unpaired electron interacts with two equivalent protons (with I = 1/2), the analy-
sis of the resulting spectra may be considered as follows: It follows from the interaction between 
the unpaired electron and the first proton that the MS = + 1/2 and MS = -1/2 levels must be 
split by ~ 
(Figs. 2.15a and 2.15b). 
Interaction with the second proton splits each level again by ~ 
. The intermediate levels 
(MI = 0) coincide and the relative probability for the transitions between the two levels be-
comes a factor 2 (Fig. 2.15b). 
For three equivalent protons (with I = 1/2) the method of spectral analysis is analogous. 
The repetition of splitting gives four levels, both for the Ms = + 1/2 and Ms = -1/2. The coin-
cidence of the intermediate levels gives a threefold relative probability for the transitions between 
these levels (Figs. 2.16a and 2.16b). 
The interaction of the unpaired electron with n equivalent protons results in n + 1 lines 
whose relative intensities are proportional to the coefficients of the binomial expansion of 
(1 + x)n (Fig. 2.17). 
Summing up, it is seen that when we have a single set of equivalent protons, having only one 
hyperfine coupling constant A, the energy levels for hyperfine interaction are obtained by repeti-
tive equal splitting of the hyperfine levels Ms = + 1/2 and Ms = -1/2. The maximum possible 
number of lines (when there is no second-order splitting, see Chapter 2.6.4) is determined by 
lli(2 nili + 1) where lli indicates a product over all values of i, ni is the number of equivalent nuclei 
with spin Ii. It is important to point out that the overall shape of the spectra is influenced by the 
ratio of splitting to line width (Fig. 2.18).

coupling constants (AI and A2, where Al > A2), the energy level diagram may be constructed 
in the samy way as before. The fIrst splitting ~ 
1 is due to the proton with hyperfine splitting 
constant AI. The second splitting is due to that with ~ 
2 (Figs. 2.19a and2.19b). 
Summing up, it is seen that when we have two nonequivalent setsofn andm protons respectively, 
the maximum number of lines in the ESR spectrum is (n + 1) (m + 1). The positions of lines in 
the spectrum are a function of the hyperfine splitting constants an and am (3i). The position of 
the lines at the field Hk in the spectrum is given by: 
(2.31) 
where He is the magnetic field at the center of the spectrum, Mi is the sum of the MI values for 
the protons of the i-th set. 
When: an > am the obtained spectrum is well resolved. 
an > am but am is sufficiently large the crossing of line groups is observed. The analysis 
of such spectra is much more complicated. 
an"" am (the difference is small) some of the lines are overlapping and the spectrum 
consists of a lower number of resolved lines than expected. 
The separation of the energy levels is determined by IIi(nili + 1)n where IIi indicates a product 
over all values of i, and ni is the number of equivalent nuclei with spin Ii. 
The positions of the lines in the isotropic spectrum should be symmetric about a central 
position. Asymmetry of line positions may result from: 
1. Anisotropy of the g-tensor of the radical 
2. Superposition of two spectra with different g-values 
3. Anisotropy of the hyperfIne interaction tensor 
4. Second order splitting when the hyperfine splittings are large 
5. Variation in spectrallinewidth which arises from a slow tumbling rate of the radical 
6. A factor due to the spectrometer. 
In many cases, in the presence of an odd number of nonequivalent nuclei with I = 1/2, the 
spectrum has no apparent center line663, 1797). The sum of the hyperfine splitting· constants 
for all nuclei with I = 1/2, is equal to the separation in gauss between the outermost lines, which 
may be very weak and are therefore missed. When the line resolution is poor or when there ap-
pears to be more lines than expected, it is useful to carry out a computer simulation of the 
spectrum based on assumed hyperfine splitting constants and line-width624, 1202, 2074). 
2.6.4. Second Order Splittings of Lines 
When hyperf"me coupling energy (hA) is very large in comparison with the electron energy 
~tleH) or when a small magnetic field is used, additional splitting of some line may occur, 
which is called "second-order splitting" (Fig. 2.20). 
The detailed treatment of these phenomena is not discussed here, because it requires the 
application of perturbation theory.

3.1. ESR Spectrometers 
There are several commercial ESR spectrometers operating at different frequencies produced today, 
e.g. Varian (USA) E-Line spectrometer, Jeol (Japan) JES-3BX and JES-PE-3X spectrometers, 
and Bruker (Germany) B-ER-414,B-ER-418 and B-ER-420 spectrometers. The commercial ESR 
spectrometers operate at a fixed microwave frequency and scan the ESR spectra by linear varia-
tion of the magnetic field. A typical ESR spectrometer has the following main components 
(Fig. 3.1). 
1. The source of microwave radiation is a klystron producing microwave oscillation in a 
small frequency range. ESR spectrometers have been constructed for the following bands:

There are differencies between the European and American names for the bands. To avoid mis-
understandings the frequency should always be given. The large majority of ESR spectrometers 
are designed for a frequency around 9.5 GHz (X-band). The most common second frequency is 
35 GHz (Q-band). Some properties of ESR spectra are frequency-dependent and it is advantageous 
to study these spectra at different frequencies. The frequency of monochromatic radiation is 
determined by the voltage applied to the klystron. Stabilization of the frequency is made by an 
automatic frequency control (AFC) system which works on the voltage. The power of the kly-
strons used in ESR spectrometers is usually a few hundred milliwatts. The heat generated by the 
klystron is removed by circulating water. The life-times of modem klystrons exceed 7000 hours. 
2. The magnet is a source of static magnetic field. It should have a large field region, a wide 
air gap, and good field homogeneity. For g = 2 a field of 3.4 kG is necessary for resonance of 
free electron spins at 9.5 GHz (X-band) and a field of 12.5 kG at 35 GHz (Q-band). The field has 
to be very stable and kept within ± 10 mG. The stability of the magnet is often obtained by 
regulation with a Hall crystal in the magnet gap. The crystal gives a voltage proportional to the 
field and any change can be corrected with a feed-back circuit to the current. 
3. The cavity system contains the sample. The quality factor Q of a cavity measures its 
power to store microwave energy: 
Q = 2 (maximum microwave energy stored in the cavity) 
energy lost per cycle 
(3.1) 
When sample and sample holder are introduced in the cavity, the Q-value may change appreciably. 
Since the signal is proportional to Q, it is necessary to consider the best way to introduce the 
sample without decreasing Q too much. Cavities can be designed in different shapes and sizes 
for various purposes. The most common cavity is the TE102 rectangular cavity used for large 
samples and especially for liquid samples. Another cavity design is a cylinder type TE011 useful 
39 

3. Experimental Instrumentation of Electron Resonance 
Fig. 3.1. Block diagram of a 100 kHz ESR spectrometer with AFC and phase sensitive detection 1 09) 
for gaseous systems and liquid samples in capillaries. The microwave energy enters and leaves the 
sample cavity by the same hole, called the iris. 
4. The modulation system at the commonly used frequency of 100 kHz consists of small 
Helmholtz coils, one on each side of the cavity along the axis of the static field. 
5. The detection is usually a semiconducting silica crystal for measuring the microwave 
power absorbed by the specimen. A super-heterodyne electronic system is applied for sensitive 
detection. 
6. The recording system allows the display of the phase-detected signal on an oscilloscope 
for quick observation or on a paper-chart for permanent record. It may also be stored in a com-
puter for further data handling, such as the integration or the multi-scan time averaging. A com-
puter is also convenient for storing time-dependent signals which change so rapidly that mechani-
cal recorders cannot follow. 
There are certain requirements for a good ESR spectrometer. It should have the maximal 
sensitivity and stability and it should have a good resolution. A spectrometer to be used for 
many different types of experiments should also be highly versatile. 
The sensitivity should allow detection of very small numbers of unpaired electrons. The 
sensitivity of good commercial ESR spectrometers in the X-band amounts of 5 x 1010 spin G-1 
for 100 kHz modulation and 5 - 15 x 1011 spin G-1 for 80 kHz, in the K-band 3 x 1010 spin 
G-1 for 100 kHz modulation, and in the Q-band 6 x 109 spin G-1 for 100 kHz modulation. 
The stability should allow the recording of linear and reproducible spectra. The resolution 
should allow the separation of lines which are very close to each other. The versatility should 
allow for large changes of the spectrometer parameters and provide for many different acces-
sories to be added for special experiments. For further details of the construction and the opera-
tion of ESR spectrometers the reader should consult original papers, reviews, and books, 
e.g.33, 986, 1760, 1919,2417).

3.3. Measurements of Spin Concentration 
For study of rapid chemical reactions occurring in a few milliseconds, a rapid scan ESR 
spectrometer is used 1654,2052,2053). Block diagram of a modified ESR spectrometer for this 
purpose is shown in Figure 3.2. 
With the single shot saw tooth generator, the duration of the scan is raised in the range from 
10-3 to one second. The signal, amplified by a power amplifier, is fed to a Helmholtz coil The 
sweep of the two-element synchroscope is synchronized with the original single shot. The release 
of the camera shutter is also synchronized with the single shot. One of the advantages of the 
rapid scan method is its ability to investigate phenomena occurring rapidly as a single event, e.g. 
the decay of electrons trapped in an irradiated solid matrix.

3.2. Field Sweep Calibration 
In order to measure line widths and hyperfine splittings, an accurate calibration of the field is 
necessary. This is easily made by using a standard sample in which the line positions have been 
carefully determined. The standard sample can be introduced in the dual cavity and the spectra 
recorded simultaneously. Various compounds containing stable unpaired electrons are used as 
standards42): 
1. Mn2+ in SrO powder characterized by 6 lines, 1.6 G wide, totally over 420 G, splittings 
84 ± 0.2 GI853). 
2. Peroxylamine disulphate ion in solution characterized by 3 lines 250 mG wide, outer 
splitting 26.18 G, splittings 13.1 ± 0.004 G635). 
3. Tetracyanoethylene anion radical (TCNE) in solution (Varian standard sample) charac-
terized by 9 lines, 100 mG wide, outer splitting 1.6 G, splittings 1.57 GI820). 
4. Wurster's blue perchlorate characterized by 39 lines listed for half spectrum, total spec-
trum 86 G, accuracy ±0.01 G21 03). 
Direct measurements and statistical analysis of line width is given in paper1931). 
3.3. Measurements of Spin Concentration 
The number of spins (per gram, per milliliter, or per mm length of sample) is proportional to the 
area under the absorption curve. The derivative signal has to be integrated to obtain this area. 
This is equivalent to the first moment of the derivative signal. The integration is made graphically, 
41 

3. Experimental Instrumentation of Electron Resonance 
electronically, or digitally with a computer. The accuracy of all methods decreases when the 
signals are noisy or have long wings, and when the base line drifts or is affected by a background 
signal. These problems can most easily be overcome by using a digital computer. 
A method for graphical calculation of spin concentration is to divide the spectrum into 
constant intervals and measure the amplitude in each interval. These amplitudes are cumulatively 
added and each partial sum written down. The last value should be zero, otherwise it has to be 
divided by the number of intervals and cumulatively substracted from the partial sums. The 
second integral is then obtained by adding all the partial sums2432). 
The intensity of the ESR spectra is influenced by several experimental factors such as: 
1. The overall spectrometer gain 
2. The microwave frequency 
3. The modulation amplitude at the sample 
4. The concentration of free radicals in the sample 
5. The g-factor ofthe sample 
6. The transition probability 
7. The mling factor of the sam pIe 
8. The sample temperature 
Since many factors influence the intensity of the ESR signal, the absolute determination of 
free radical concentration involves many errors and requires many corrections, and it is carried 
out very rarely. 
The usual method for measuring the concentration of free radicals in an unknown sample 
is to compare its ESR signal with that of a sample containing a known quantity of free radi-
cals33,2103). 
A standard sample should have the following properties: 
1. Line width and line shape of its ESR spectrum similar to that of the unknown sample. 
2. Its number of spins should be similar to that of the unknown sample. 
3. Physical shape and dielectric loss of the reference sample similar to those of the unknown 
sample. 
4. Stability both with time and temperature. The number of spins, the line width, and the 
g-value should remain constant. 
5. A short relaxation time (T 1) to avoid easy saturation of the signal. 
Since line width and spin concentration vary over several order of magnitude it may be necell-
sary to prepare a set of standard samples. Various secondary standard samples are used33, 42): 
1. Synthetic ruby crysta12015). It can be placed in the cavity permitting simultaneous 
observation of standard and unknown samples. 
2. Charred dextrose973). This standard sample does not change properties between 4 K and 
500K. 
3. Powdered coal (pitch) diluted with KCL Varian supplies two such standards (peak-to-peak 
line width 1.7 G, g = 2.0028) of different concentrations (1 x 1013 and 3 x 1015 spins 
em-1) with each spectrometer. 
4. Mn2+ in Mg01123, 2234, 2405), Ca01925) and CaC031015). 
The secondary standards are calibrated against less stable samples (primary standards) with spin 
concentration that are determined by independent methods: 
1. Freshly recrystallized DPPH (a,a'-diphenyl-~picrylhydrazy1)985, 986, 1234,2483). 
2. Fresh, deep blue CuSOt · 5 H20 crysta1986, 1015, 1141). 
3. Fresh MnS04 • H2020 5). 
4. K2NO(S03h in aqueous solution1063). 
5.02 gas634, 2186, 2406). 
Recalibrations with one type of primary standard in the same laboratory are reproducible within 
10% while absolute accuracy may not be better than 50%. Relative comparison with a secondary 
standard can be done with an accuracy of 5-10%. 
A number of factors influence the measurements and can lead to systematic errors if not 
accounted for: 
1. Filling factors of the samples should be identical. The ratio of radio frequency field and 
modulation field is not linear, so a linear sample cannot easily be compared with another of a 
42 

3.4. Measurements of ESR Spectra at Different Temperatures 
different diameter or with a point sample. The samples should be carefully positioned in the 
maximum radio frequency field. 
2. Materials with a high dielectric constant such as water and quartz may distort the micro-
wave field. 
3. Materials with high dielectric loss change the cavity characteristic. 
4. The scanned width should be sufficiently large. 
S. The signals should not be partially saturated. 
6. The sweep rate should not distort the spectrum. 
7. g-Value, resonance frequency and temperature should be identicaL 
8. The spin quantum number and (for S > 1/2) the transition should be the same (for Mn2+ 
1= S/2)1727). 
The dual cavity allows the use of samples with similar filling factors and position in the radio-
frequency field 1171). The change of samples is also simple. Differences in the two signal measur-
ing channels are eliminated by exchange of samples. A careful analysis of the errors in spin con-
centration determination has been given in papers405 , 2022). 
3.4. Measurements of ESR Spectra at Different Temperatures 
Low temperatures are used to a large extent in ESR measurements, because they provide a great 
deal of information about the spin system. Apart from the temperature dependence of g-factor 
and hyperime interaction, some of the advantages of low temperature are1913): 
1. An increase of spectrometer sensitivity, because of the increase of the thermal equilibrium 
population difference between the Zeeman levels. 
2. The spin lattice relaxation time increases and yields information about the coupling 
between the spin system and the lattice. 
3. Several double resonance methods, like the ENDOR technique, require reasonably long 
relaxation times and correspondingly low temperature. 
4. Similarly, most methods of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) require slow 
relaxation rates.

3. Experimental Instrumentation of Electron Resonance 
Measurements of ESR spectra at different temperatures (77 -300 K) are made by applying 
a temperature variation and control device (Fig. 3.3)1032). 
This sample arrangement is a heat exchanger. Dry nitrogen is passed through a copper coil im-
mersed in liquid nitrogen and conducted to the quartz Dewar insert through a Vycor transfer 
tube, which contains a heater. The cooling gas passes around the quartz sample tube and is di!t-
charged through the top of the Dewar in the cavity. Temperature control is achieved by varying 
the flow rate of the cooling gas and controlling the heater current. Temperature control may be 
obtained using thermocouple or platinum resistors. The Varian E-257 and &268 Variable Tempera-
ture Units are examples of devices using this method. 
Dangerous phenomena of explosions have been observed involving irradiated Dewars of 
liquid nitrogen with various atmospheric impurities including oxygen and water vapor from the 
ambient air and solid catalysts1849). 
For measurements of ESR spectra in the temperature range 4.2-77 K it is necessary to use 
a special low temperature continuous flow cryostat (Fig. 3.4).

The sample is cooled by a controlled flow of cold helium gas. Temperature measurements in this 
region is conventionally achieved by monitoring the resistivity of a carbon resistor. Such cryostats 
are commercially available, e.g. Leybold-Heraeus ESR-Verdampferkryostat, or Oxford Instruments 
ESR-9 Continuous Flow Cryostat. These kinds of experiments are difficult to perform on account 
of the necessity of using liquid helium which is not always available and not easy to handle950,1461). 
For measurements of ESR spectra in the temperature range 1.2-4.2 K the sample has to be 
immersed in the bath of liquid helium. Lowering the vapor pressure yields a corresponding 
decrease of the bath temperature. Various cryostats for 1.2-4.2 K120, 1187, 1912, 1926, 1939, 
2002,2211,2338) and below 1 K643) temperature range are described in original papers.

3.6. Preparation of Samples for ESR Experiments 
3.5. Computer Application into ESR Spectroscopy 
Application of different computer programs to evaluate ESR experiments have been reported 
in several papers334, 396,626,656,674,686, 830, 832, 1061, 1162, 1318, 1322, 1342, 1521, 
1594,1654,1757,1758,1825,2101,2172,2320,2442). 
A program for evaluation of ESR spectra with unresolved hyperfine structure must be 
calculated for: 
1. Various line numbers, intensity distributions, and ratios of component width to splitting 
on the assumptions that the components are symmetrical and give the same width and splitting 
(this is for many free radicals and ion-radicals in the liquid state). 
2. Anisotropic g-factors (for free radicals and ion-radicals in solids, biopolymers, etc.). 
3. The assumption that the unresolved components differ in width (for free radicals and 
ion-radicals in glass matrices, amorphous polymers, etc.). 
Varian Associates (Palo Alto, California, USA) have prepared the EPR/ADAPTS system 
written in E-BASIC computer language. It is easy for an inexperienced computer operator to use 
for solving his specific ESR problems. Operator errors in the entering of data are reported so that 
they can be corrected immediately. An ESR application software package is also included in the 
system; it contains a set of 21 programs designed to perform many of the routine tasks demanded 
by the majority of ESR experiments. The tapes may be divided into four specific categories: data 
acquisition, data display, data reduction and special functions. These programs are all sorted as 
files on a 123-K disk, and are loaded into a CPU memory. All loading is done by the use of 
DASMR assembly language routines when speed is essential to obtain the required data through-
put. A description of these programs is given in Appendix (p. 57 -60). 
Lebedevet al.1323) have published the Atlas of Electron Spin Resonance Spectra which 
contains theoretically computer calculated multicomponent symmetrical spectra. 
3.6. Preparation of Samples for ESR Experiments 
3.6.1. Gases 
There are three types of gases which can be studied by ESR 318): 
1. Paramagnetic molecules: 02, NO, N02, CI02 
2. Reactive atoms: H, N, ° 
3. Free radicals in a gas phase. 
The ESR study of gases is carried out for two main reasons: 
1. The theory of coupling in molecular species. 
2. Gas phase chemistry involving reactive intermediate radicals. 
The ESR spectra of paramagnetic gas molecules are generally more complicated (see Chapter 6) 
than those for solids and liquids, because the magnetic field does not uncouple the strong inter-
action between the magnetic moment of the unpaired electron and the angular momentum of 
the rotating molecule40, 393, 1005, 1704, 2186). The main experimental problem is to produce 
a sufficient concentration of free radicals in the gas to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio without 
losing resolution1438, 2087). Measurements at a pressure of 10-20 mm Hg (10 17 _1018 mole-
cules cm-3) sometimes give line broadening. Pressures of 0.1-1 mm Hg (1015 _1016 molecules 
cm-3) give spectra with better resolution. For that reason it is necessary to have a gas-handling 
system which permits pressure adjustment to optimize signals and resolutions. Two methods are 
commonly used: 
1. Differential pumping to remove excess molecules. 
2. Dilution with inert diamagnetic gases such as helium or argon. 
Atomic gases are produced by several different methods: 
1. Electrical discharge. 
2. Electrodeless discharge. 
3. Pyrolysis, e.g. by high-temperature arc or flames.

On account of the short lifetime of these radicals the production devices should be arranged 
close to the cavity system (Fig. 3.5). 
In order to investigate reactions which occur in gas phase, special flow devices are placed in 
the microwave cavity (Fig. 3.6). 
3.6.2. Liquids 
The studies of free radicals in liquids are devoted to the following problems: 
1. Radicals generated by radio lysis and photolysis of liquids. 
2. Negative and positive radical ions produced in solution. 
3. Intermediate species in chemical reactions. 
Radicals generated by radio lysis are obtained by two main techniques: 
1. Radicals generated in a radiation source and then pumped through the resonant cavity 
(Fig. 3.7). 
2. Radicals formed in the cavity by direct introduction of high energy electrons into the 
cavity (Fig. 3.8). 
From an experimental point of view, both methods are complicated. 
Radicals generated by photolysis are obtained by direct irradiation of the sample in the 
cavity equipped with a quartz window in one wall (Fig. 3.9) or by irradiating the sample outside 
the cavity. 
Far UV-photolysis (7.. < 1800 A) of liquid samples in a rigid phase at 77 K requires specially 
designed apparatus for measurement of ESR spectra2418). This instrument gives spectra resolved 
up to six different times after the UV flash (Fig. 3.10). 
The sample is placed in a commercial ESR spectrometer and irradiated with flashes from a 
xenon tubeS63). At a f1xed magnetic f1eld the spectrometer output describes the radical decay 
curve. After each flash the output is monitored by six different sampling channels and recorded 
by a multi-channel recorder. 
A practical method for measuring triplet states by ESR has been described in detail834). The 
intensity of the 6m = 2 spin resonance for a given number of randomly oriented triplets is com-
puted as a function of zero-f1eld splitting and line width. Then it is compared with the intensity 
of a standard sample with known yield. 
A photolytic continuous-flow method operating at room temperature makes possible the 
observation of radicals formed by the addition of photochemically generated primary radicals 
to different monomers203S , 2042). 
Negative free radical ions are produced by chemical methods, e.g. by mixing an alkali metal 
with an aromatic compound in a polar solvent such as 1,2-dimethyloxyethylene (DME), tetra-

times preferred because the ESR spectra obtained are not complicated by the presence of alkali 
metals408). Different types of electrolytic cells are described in the references243• 911). Positive

free radical ions can be produced in solution, e.g. by dissolving aromatic hydrocarbons in con-
centrated sulphuric acid243). 
Intermediate species in chemical reactions are observed mainly in flow systems426). These 
systems are widely used for the investigation of redox reactions, e.g. to initiate polymerization 
(see Chapter 4.6.3). Figure 3.12 shows a typical arrangement for such experiments. 
Containers Ll and L2 hold the redox reagents and the monomer in solution. These solutions 
are pumped, or flow by gravity, from the containers to the mixing cell which is placed in the ESR 
spectrometer cavity. The flow rate is regulated and measured in the flow meter. In order to ob-
tain good results the mixing cell should be correctly designed. At present modifications of the 
Dixon-Norman mixing cell are widely used (Fig. 3.13)556, 557, 2393). 
This cell consists of two tubes with a flat cell on top. The inner tube contains a spray head, from 
which one solution (e.g. the reductant) is injected into the second solution (e.g. the oxidant). 
Free radicals are immediately formed after mixing the two solutions in the ESR spectrometer

cavity. The flow rate of the solvents should experimentally be selected, and the rates between 
1 and 10 cm3 s-l are habitually used. 
The flow system method is mainly limited by the solvent used, water being the most frequent 
choice. A second limitation is due to the necessary presence of the redox system components in 
the reaction mixture. The presence of these components may be the source of secondary reao-
tions complicating the overall kinetic analysis and may reduce the attainable spectroscopic reso-
lution494, 1455,2043). This method has also been developed for the study of short-lived free 
radicals formed in UV-irradiated solutions1382, 1383,2035,2042). 
3.6.3. Solids 
Free radicals in solids are produced by photolysis, radio lysis, pyrolysis, and electrical discharge. 
The generation of free radicals by photolysis and radio lysis can be directly made in the 
cavity or the radicals can be transferred into the cavity after their production outside. In the 
latter method the sample manipulation is relatively simple and straight-forward down to liquid 
nitrogen temperature. Transfer operations are more difficult at liquid helium temperature. In 
most experiments with radicals down to 77 K, the radicals are generated externally and trans-
ferred to the cavity for measuring the ESR spectra. At lower temperatures it is usually better to 
irradiate the sample in the cavity to minimize manipulations. 
Samples which are solids at room temperature, such as crystals, polymers, or glasses, are 
readily irradiated as it is shown on Figure 3.8. Many compounds which are liquid at room 
temperature are prepared in the form of small beads by freezing drops of the sample at liquid 
nitrogen temperature. Several different arrangements for direct irradiating of samples in the 
cavity and outside the cavity are described in the literature33, 1518, 2379). 
Measurements of the orientation dependence of the ESR spectra of single crystals require 
the application of a movable amount with cross leaders for fine adjustment of the sample posi-
tion in the cavity 1 032). 
Inserting the sample directly into liquid nitrogen frequently causes problems, because the 
nitrogen gas bubbles produce an excessive noise in the recording of spectrum. This effect may be 
suppressed by blowing helium gas into the liquid nitrogen. 
3.6.4. Stabilization of Free Radicals 
The life-times of many organic free radicals and ionic radical intermediates are too short for ob-
servation by ESR spectroscopy. For that reason it is very important to stabilize free radicals and 
radical ions165). The following methods are applied: 
1. Stabilization of free radicals by cooling to low temperatures, e.g. liquid nitrogen 
(-196°C = 77 K)150l). 
2. Stabilization of free radicals on synthetic zeolites1615). Synthetic zeolites seem to be 
good stabilizing matrices for free radicals at relatively high temperatures. Application of this 
method in radio lysis is limited as the radiation induces formation of paramagnetic centers in the 
zeolites10, 288,1231,1611,2068,2313,2354,2427). 
3. Stabilization of free radicals and ionic radicals in organic glass matrices. Organic glass 
matrices are widely applied for stabilization of ionic radical intermediates (see Chapter 4.2.2). 
It has been found that free electrons are trapped only in amorphous frozen (glassy) states but 
never in crystalline states2030). 
4. Stabilization of free radicals in organic crystalline matrices, e.g. alcohols. Methanol and 
other alcohol glasses are frequently used as trapping matrices in radiation and photochemical 
studies. Irradiation effects in frozen alcohols have been reported in several papers34, 111, 416, 
417,499-501, 1138, 1514,1995,2093). Generally, electrons and hydrogen abstraction radicals 
RCHOH of the alcohols are formed by ionizing radiation. In the case of methanol this may be 
explained in the following mechanism111 , 499, 500): 
(3.2) 
50 

3.6. Preparation of Samples for ESR Experiments 
(3.3) 
(3.4) 
It has been found from application of spin trapKing methods that methoxy and hydroxymethyl 
radicals are formed in about equal amounts141 ,1896). Methoxy radicals are not observed in 
X-irradiated frozen methanol matrices because they probably give rise to hydroxymethyl radicals: 
(3.5) 
During UV-irradiation the hydroxymethylradicals are photolyzed to formylradicals34, 1054): 
(3.6) 
These results show that application of alcohol glasses as trapping matrices should receive con-
siderable attention. 
3.6.5. Apparatus for High Pressure Annealing of Samples 
The simultaneous measurements of ESR spectra of free radicals at high pressure and at different 
temperatures directly in the cavity resonator of an ESR spectrometer are difficult from experi-
mental point of view. This problem can be solved by the following method21 04). Samples are 
irradiated at low temperature and the starting concentration of free radicals is determined by 
ESR spectroscopy. Then the sample is inserted into the press (Fig. 3.14) and heated to the nece!l-
sary temperature.

After annealing at certain pressure and temperature, the sample is cooled down, the pressure is 
read, and the concentration measured by ESR at lower temperature. If the sample is transferred 
into the press and then again into the ESR spectrometer at a temperature at which the decay is 
negligible, and if the heating rate is sufficiently fast, the rate constant of free radical decay may 
be determined with high accuracy from the concentration difference and the annealing time. 
3.6.6. Loading Apparatus for ESR Stretching Experiments 
The radical formation during the tensile deformation (constant stress, constant strain, or con-
stant elongation) is made in the specially designed loading apparatus, which is placed in the cavity 
assembly of the ESR spectrometer (Fig. 3.15)1556, 1558).

The ends of the specimen are held in brass chucks on either side of the microwave cavity. At the 
lower end a load transmitting brass rod is connected to a stress transducer. At the upper end a 
second rod is attached to a lever connected to a motor-driven loading framework, as is shown in 
Figure 3.15. To stretch fibers in vacuo or in a stream of nitrogen, the specimen is placed in a glass 
tube, of which the part in the microwave cavity is made of vitrous quartz. 
3.6.7. Milling Devices for Grinding Samples 
Several different constructions of milling devices are described in literature369, 578, 1747, 
1878, 2057). A simple vibration mill is shown in Fr-ure 3.16. 
The vibration frequency is 50-60 cycles min- and the milling time 4-6 h. In order to trap the 
free radicals formed, the milling process is carried out at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). 
After milling, the glass ampoule is turned 1800 to an upright position and inserted in the ESR 
cavity for measurement. For this purpose the ampoule is equipped with a special quartz finger.

3.7. Special Techniques for ESR Spectroscopy 
3.6.8. Preparation of Samples Containing Free Radicals by Sawing Technique 
In this method polymer blocks are cut in liquid nitrogen with a metal saw and the saw dust of 
polymer produced by this sawing is transferred in liquid nitrogen to a quartz tube and then 
inserted into the microwave cavity. Before the ESR measurements the liquid nitrogen is re-
moved by evacuationl879, 2057). 
3.7. Special Techniques for ESR Spectroscopy 
During the last few years new techniques for ESR spectroscopy have been developed, as: 
1. "Electron double resonance" (ELDOR) in which the magnetic resonance of the specimen 
is affected by a second resonance frequency. It, therefore, leads to higher resolution of hyperfine 
structure than might otherwise be obtained. This technique has been applied to study relaxation 
mechanisms88, 91, 621, 894, 990). 
2. "Electron-nuclear double resonance" (ENDOR) is the detection of changes in a monitored 
ESR signal, due to the induction of nuclear resonance of nuclei coupled to the paramagnetic 
center. The detailed description of ENDOR theory and application has been given in several 
publicationsll, 88, 91,503,534,645,714,715,720,798,881,894,900,988, 992, 993,1067, 
1115,2405). ENDOR corresponds to ordinary NMR applied to nuclei close to unpaired electrons, 
where electrons serve as a means of observing the nuclear resonance. Block diagram of ENDOR 
spectrometer is shown in Figure 3.17. 
The radhfrequency (rf) generator having power (200 W) and NMR radio frequency (2-30 MHz), 
and large power output is connected by ferrite-core transformers to the side coils of the special 
constructed cavity (Fig. 3.18). 
Readers can find the basic description of ENDOR spectrometers in references37, 502, 829, 1409). 
A partial saturation of some partiCUlar electronic transitions by a microwave frequency 
produces an ESR signal of a given amplitude. When the second field having an NMR radiofre-
quency is slowly altered, a change takes place in the spin popUlation of the electronic levels at 
values corresponding to the resonance of a given type of nuclei. This change affects the amplitude 
of the original ESR signal, and it is the magnitude of this "difference in amplitudes" which is 
observed as function of the rf frequency. This effect is commonly known as ENDOR. At two 
frequencies of the rf generator (VI and v2), the recorder plots two separated peaks (Fig. 3.19). 
This type of spectrum is called "ENDOR spectrum". The difference v2-vl is numerically equal 
to the hyperfine coupling constant (A). The ENDOR method is especially used when the hyper-
fine lines are not well-resolved in the ESR spectrum, and when the identity of an interacting 
nucleus is to be established by measuring of the nuclear g-factor. 
When the unpaired electron interacts with more than one proton, or with more nuclear spin 
systems, the ENDOR lines appear at frequencies corresponding to the hyperfine coupling con-
stants, no matter how many equivalent spins are present in each spin system. 
The differences between ESR and ENDOR spectra are shown in an example of the triphenyl-
methyl radical (Fig. 3.20). 
In this radical three proton spin systems are found which correspond to the ortho-, para-
and metha-protons: 
Each ortho and metha system contains 6 protons, the para system contains 3 protons. The total 
number of ESR hyperfine spectral lines is: 
53 

3. Experimental Instrumentation of Electron Spin Resonance 
N = (2 x (6 + 1) x 1/2)2(2 x (3 + 1) x 1/2) = 196 
In the spectrum shown in Figure 3.20a, about 100 lines are resolved. It is evident that the deter-
mination of the coupling constant for such complex spectrum is rather difficult. 
The three coupling constants are easily determined from the ENDOR spectrum (Fig. 3.20b), 
but from this spectrum it is not evident how to assign the coupling constants. For that reason

3. Experimental Instrumentation of Electron Spin Resonance 
the ESR spectrum is more helpful. For example, the highest coupling constant corresponds to 
the 3 protons, because the corresponding splitting 2.78 ± 0.02 G gives a quartet (3 + 1 lines) in 
the ESR spectrum, indicating that 3 protons are involved. The septet corresponding to the 
6 ortho-protons with a coupling constant 2.55 ± 0.03 G is also observed. The coupling 1.156 G 
caused by the 6 metha-protons is not directly observable in the ESR spectrum, but is very clear 
in the ENDOR spectrum. It is seen that ENDOR is valuable for accurate determination of hyper-
fine coupling constants of complex radicals when the spectra are compared with ESR. ENDOR 
spectroscopy is more useful than ESR spectroscopy in two main respects. One is that the spectra 
are simpler, as each group of equivalent protons produces only one single ENDOR line regardless 
of the number of equivalent protons in the group. The second advent age is that the resolution is 
more improved. 
3. "Optical detection of magnetic resonance" (ODMR). The basic idea of this method is 
that radiofrequency transitions which occur in the course of the magnetic resonance can be 
monitored by the changes which they cause in the polarization, intensity, or spectral distribu-
tion of either emitted or absorbed light503, 975,1530). Thus the ODMR combines the high 
selectivity of optical spectroscopy with the sensitivity of ESR spectroscopy. This method has 
not yet been applied to the study of free radicals in polymers.

Appendix 
Appendix 
MSAV: Multiscan Average 
MSA V provides the user with a means to acquire and sum together several scans of EPR 
data in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Assuming the spectrometer noise is 
random, it will add as the square root of the number of scans, i.e • .IN, while the EPR 
signal (not random) will add directly as the number of scans, N. Thus, an improvement 
in the signal-to-noise ratio equal to the square root of the number of scans can be achieved 
by multiscan averaging. 
MSAVST: Multiscan Average Using Standard Parameters 
MSA VST operates in the same manner as MSA V. All necessary input parameters are re-
trieved from a standard parameter file, STPARA, and the acquisition of data is begun. The 
purpose of this program is to maintain a standard set of multiscan averages in a file called 
STPARA. Hence, any future efforts in averaging spectra can be accomplished without 
having to answer the questions asked by loading the program MSA V. 
MSA VRP: Multiscan Average Repeating Parameters in Data File 
MSA VRP operates similarly to the MSA VST program described above, but reuses the 
parameters in the data file rather than the parameters in STPARA. The data file para-
meters are generally those used to obtain the most recent MSAV. For example, if the 
operator completes a MSA V, changes samples, and wishes to do an identical experiment, 
typing MSA VRP will initiate a multiscan average without the necessity of reentering the 
earlier input parameters. 
RESUME: Resume Multiscan Average 
This program allows the user to add scans to the data file if necessary. If the user, for 
instance, has performed a 40-scan MSA V on a dilute sample and found that the resultant 
signal-to-noise ratio was only fair, 40 additional scans may be added to improve this ratio 
by ..j2 with the RESUME option. 
Data Reduction 
Each of the five data reduction programs reads the data file created by the program and 
generates a plot file. The plot file may be displayed on the EPR oscilloscope, the E-80A 
EPR recorder, the optional 611 CRT, or it may be stored for future reference. 
DERIVT: Derivative 
DERIVT takes the derivative of the data file and stores the result in the plot file. 
The numerical derivative can be taken over as little as three or as many as 23 data 
points. The numerical derivative of normal EPR data is displayed as a second deriva-
tive. 
SMOOTH: Smooth with Variable Length Convolution Function 
Information in the data file may be processed with this program by using a variable 
number of values in a convolution function to smooth the data, with the result 
being stored in the plot file. The operator specifies the number of points, between 
5, ..• , 23, used to calculate the smoothed value at each point in the data file. 
INTI: First Integral 
INTI calculates the first integral (i.e. the absorption spectrum) of the standard 
EPR spectrum (1st derivative) emanating from the spectrometer. 
57 

3. Experimental Instrumentation of Electron Spin Resonance 
INT2SC: Second Integral/Spin Concentration 
This program calculates the second integral (intensity) of the normal EPR spectrum, 
prints a value for the intensity on the Teletype, stores the result in the plot file, 
and asks if a spin concentration calculation is desired. If not, the program ter-
minates. 
When the spin concentration calculation is desired, the user must supply a sample 
of known concentration (e.g. Varian strong pitch). The computer then calculates 
the known sample's second integral and compares this value to the second integral 
computed for the unknown sample. Spin concentration for the unknown is then 
printed out. 
STICK: Stick Plot of Experimental Spectrum 
STICK integrates each line in the standard experimental EPR spectrum and pro-
duces a set of lines positioned at line maxima with height proportional to the 
integral of the line. A list of line positions in Gauss and T 2 -1 's is provided as a 
user option. The purpose of the program is to allow the user to generate a theo-
retical stick plot of the EPR spectrum and compare this to the experimental stick 
plot generated by the computer, thereby giving a better feel for the accuracy of 
the proposed molecular structure. 
Data Display Programs 
OUTO: Output Data File 
OUTO outputs the data file to the EPR recorder, EPR scope, or the 611 CRT 
storage scope (optional). OUTO provides both horizontal and vertical scaling. 
OUTP: Output Plot File 
OUTP outputs the plot file to the EPR recorder, EPR scope, or the 611 CRT 
storage scope (optional). OUTP provides both horizontal and vertical scaling. 
Special Function Programs 
58 
EPRSIM: Simulate EPR Spectrum from Theoretical Parameters 
EPRSIM calculates and stores in the data file an EPR spectrum using a first order 
approximation to determine the line positions. It produces a spectrum by first 
generating a list of all line positions and intensities, and then calculating the speo-
tral shape over the region requested. The number of EPR lines generated is depen-
dent upon the number of nonequivalent nuclei, the number of equivalent nuclei 
within each nonequivalent set, the nuclear spin, and the magnitude of the hyper-
fine splitting constant associated with each set of nonequivalent nuclei. 
The line intensities related to a given set of nonequivalent nuclei are calculated as 
coefficients of the binomial expansion (a + b)n. Final intensity of the simulated 
spectrum is obtained by taking a superposition of the various sets of inequivalent 
nuclei. Line positions are calculated in field units from the number of lines gener-
ated, the magnitude of the hyperfine splitting constant, and the magnitude of the 
magnetic field can range (in Gauss). 
The final spectrum is determined by incorporation of a line shape function, either 
Lorentzian or Gaussian or some combination of the two, whose character is deter-
mined by an input parameter corresponding to the peak-to-peak width of the EPR 
line. A line shape is generated for each of the calculated EPR resonances. When 
two or more EPR lines overlap, a superposition of the intensities at each value of 
the magnetic field is calculated and saved in the data file. 

Appendix 
ADDEL: Add Two Spectral Files 
ADDFL adds two spectral files together and saves the result in a sum file. One 
application of this program might be to add an experimental spectrum to its com-
puted counterpart but with each spectrum of opposite phase. If the result in the 
sum file is a straight line then the theoretical spectrum is exactly identical to the 
experimental spectrum; if a wiggly line appears, the theoretical spectrum does not 
exactly represent its experimental counterpart. 
MULFL: Multiply Spectral File by Constant 
Data values in a particular file are multiplied by a constant and the result saved in 
a new file. For example, mUltiplying the data file by the constant -1, will invert 
the phase of the EPR spectrum. 
USTFL: List Parameters from Spectral File 
This program lists all of the parameters in the file header of a particular program. 
The user may also request a search of the data file to find and print the maximum 
and minimum values. Thus, if the program MSA V were in the data file, the operator 
would be able to list (print) all of the existing input parameters and their values 
and search for the maximum and minimum values of the multiscan averaged spec-
trum residing in the data file. 
UNW: Quadratic Curve Fit of EPR Linewidths of a Spectrum 
UNW fits a quadratic equation to the nuclear spin (independent variable) and EPR 
linewidth, T21, data. The pair of parameters, MI, T21 , is input for each of the EPR 
hyperfine lines in the spectrum. The program calCUlates the coefficients of the 
quadratic equation: 
LDPARA: Load Standard Parameter File (STPARA). 
The header information from the data file is copied into the STPARA file. Thus, 
the last set of parameters used can be saved and reused whenever MSA VST is 
executed, Le. MSA VST will use those parameters in the STP ARA file to run a 
multiscan average. 
Software Drivers 
The four software drivers constitute a set of assembly language programs generally used 
to interact with various hardware on the EPR spectrometer in the fastest possible time. 
EPRRCD: EPR Recorder Interface 
This subroutine provides a general interface between the ADAPTS computer and 
the E-80A EPR recorder via the interface cable. Computed spectra are plotted on 
the EPR recorder by using EPRRCD. 
EPRSCP: EPR Oscilloscope Interface 
Provides an interface between the ADAPTS computer and the EPR E-200 refresh 
oscilloscope via the interface cable. Computed spectra are displayed on the EPR 
scope by using EPRSCP. 
S9 

3. Experimental Instrumentation of Electron Spin Resonance 
CRT: 611 CRT Storage Oscilloscope Interface 
This subroutine provides a general interface between the ADAPTS computer and a 
Model 70-6400 CRT (optional hardware). Computed spectra are displayed on the 
CRT via this program. 
PROCIN: Process Control Interpreter 
This subroutine allows the user to mix different types of I/O commands at a reasonably 
fast rate so that control applications requiring input and output of data on a point-
by-point basis may be performed. In addition, control pulses may be generated or 
sense lines checked. The user is able to specify all of the input and output data 
channels and control sense lines in any order desired. 
The 21 programs described above constitute the software package available with the EPR/ADAPTS 
spectrometer system at the present time. Future EPR software developments will be made avail-
able to EPR/ ADAPTS owners upon completion.

Chapter 4 
ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
4.1. Homogeneous Chain-growth Polymerization 
Chain-growth polymerization occurs by free radical or ionic mechanism. The growth 
of a single polymer chain (a macromolecule) is due to the propagation of one kinetic 
chain reaction. Every free-radical chain reaction requires a separate initiation step in 
which a radical species is generated in the reaction mixture. 
Radical polymerizations can be divided into two general types according to the 
manner in which the initial radical species is formed: 
1. Homolytic cleavage of a covalent bond in the monomer by energy absorption 
(radiation, photo, thermal, or ultrasonic initiation) 
+ energy 
AB 
) A· + B· 
(4.1) 
2. Unpaired electron transfer to the monomer from initiator (or photoinitiator) 
fragments, formed by dissociation, e.g.: 
+energy 
R-R 
) 2R· 
(4.2) 
(4.3) 
In radiation initiation, the energy absorbed by the monomer is often higher than 
that required for the excitation of the molecule and dissociation of a covalent bond, 
and sufficient for the ionization of the molecule. An electron is ejected and the ioniza-
tion of the monomer molecule produces a radical-cation containing one unpaired 
electron and a positive charge (see Chapter 1.4): 
(4.4) 
Such ion-radicals are often unstable and may dissociate into a free radical and a 
cation: 
(4.5) 
But this dissociative process can also occur in the same step in which the electron 
(e-) is ejected from the irradiated monomer: 
(4.6) 
61 

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
When the electron does not have an excessive energy it may be attracted back to the 
cation, and a second free radical is produced: 
(4.7) 
Otherwise, the ejected electron is eventually trapped by another monomer molecule 
and either forms a radical-anion: 
AB+e-----AB·-
(4.8) 
or causes molecular dissociation to one radical and one anionic species: 
(4.9) 
In conclusion, the ejection of an electron from a molecule by ionizing radiation can 
produce two free radicals (A- and B·) and one cation (A+) and one anion (B-). 
Radiation-initiated polymerizations of vinyl monomers are generally, but not al-
ways, free radical reactions. The effect of free-radical inhibitors and the results of 
kinetic studies indicate that the polymerization of most vinyl monomers in the liquid 
state proceeds by a free radical mechanism430). There is, however, good evidence 
that the mechanism of initiation and propagation is ionic for some vinyl and diene 
monomers in solution at very low temperatures or in the solid state2413). 
An application of ESR spectroscopy for the study of polymerization mechanism 
has been for the first time made by Bresler et a1.297-299). These authors have 
measured the concentration of free radicals formed during polymerization of vinyl 
monomers such as methyl methacrylate, methyl acrylate, and vinyl acetate. 
ESR spectra of monomers polymerizing in bulk and highly viscous systems 
(e.g. precipitation polymerization) are not well resolved 1195, 1196). On the other 
hand, during polymerization in nonviscous media (e.g. polymerization in solution) 
it is difficult to detect free radicals by the ESR method because the concentration 
of free radicals is very low. If sufficiently high concentration is reached, the ESR 
spectra obtained during polymerization in nonviscous media are well resolved and 
easy to interprete. The ESR detection and identification of free radicals during poly-
merization under various conditions have been reviewed in detail by Fischer672, 685) 
and Takakura and Rllnby2136).

de Graaff generator or a linear accelerator. For investigations of polymerization in a 
nonsteady state, pulse radiolysis has been applied. A very high dose is fed to the 
system in a very short time (10-6 -10-9 s). Examples of solid state polymerization 
are shown in Table 4.1. 
The exact mechanism of the solid-state polymerization is unknown. Whether the 
polymerization occurs as a free-radical, or an ionic reaction, or both cannot be deter-
mined directly because of the wide variety of reactive species which can be formed 
by ionizing radiation. 
It is difficult to prepare a single crystal of a polymer which is sufficiently large 
to permit observation of ESR after irradiation. The determination of the nature of 
free radicals trapped in a vinyl polymer either by polymerization or by radiation 
damage, is made by the study of an irradiated single crystal of the corresponding 
monomer. However, only few ESR studies of irradiated single crystals of vinyl mono-
mers have been carried out27, 137,774,1628,1993,2323). This is partly because several 
monomers are readily polymerized during evaporation of the solvent from their solu-
tions in the preparation of single crystals. Another difficulty is that most vinyl mono-
mers are liquid at room temperature (see Table 4.1). The final difficulty in the pre-
paration of single crystals of most common vinyl monomers is the low temperature 
required for this purpose. 
In the crystalline monomers with a high degree of symmetry an "ex cit ion ab-
sorption" of irradiation energy may be observed 186,599). This means that absorbed 
energy in the form of mobile "exciton" may migrate over a long distance in crystal-
line monomer (102 -106 A). Such a migrating exciton may be trapped by the imper-
fections where free radicals are then formed.

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
4.2.1.1. Olefin Monomers 
ESR studying of radiation induced polymerization of ethylene (m.p. -103.6 K) have 
been reported in a few papers607, 756, 757). ESR spectrum of 'Y-irradiated ethylene 
monomer adsorbed on silica gel at 77 K is shown in Figure 4.1.

-y-irradiated ethylene adsorbed on 
silica gel at 77 K and measured at 
133 K, b. Stick plot for the radi-
cal -CH2CH2607) 
The overall ESR signal is due to four different radicals. The first component due to 
a radiation defect in the silica gel is a sharp line observed at g = 2.0007. If the signal 
from silica gel is substracted, the remaining spectrum corresponds to the dotted line 
in the center of Figure 4.1 a. The predominant component of the spectrum is assigned 
to the radical -CH2CH2, for which the coupling constant are Act = 22 G and 
Ap = 32 G. A stick plot with these coupling constant~ is shown in Figure 4.1 b. The 
third component is attributed to ethyl radical CH3 -CH2. The contribution of this 
species to the spectrum is small and almost camouflaged by the main spectrum. Two 
sharp lines with a splitting constant of 26 G, marked in Figure 4.1 by arrows, are the 
central part of the strongest quartet of the ethyl radical. Other lines which originate 
from this radical are considerably lower in amplitude and are not observed. Although 
the fourth radical is not shown in Figure 4.1 a, a strong line centered at g = 2.0071 
with a linewidth of 3.3 G is observed for irradiated polycrystalline ethylene at 77 K. 
This line is too unstable to allow its observation even at 77 K one hour after the 
irradiation. Because of its instability, this signal line is presumed to originate from 
electrons which are ejected from ethylene molecules and loosely trapped on the sur-
face" of silica gel. 
The overall mechanism of radical formation from ethylene is given as follows607):

Electrons ejected in the reaction (4.10) are trapped and the polymerization 
proceeds from the cation radicals by a cationic mechanism, a neutral radical being

4.2. Ionizing Polymerization 
located at one end of each growing chain. The ethyl radical is formed by addition of 
a hydrogen atom which for example is present on silica gel, to the double bond of the 
ethylene molecule (4.12). The ethyl radical is not expected to initiate a polymeriza-
tion reaction at the low temperature (77 K). Silica gel may contribute to the stabiliza-
tion of the cation radical by trapping the released electrons from the ethylene mole-
cules, promoting in this way the growth of polymer chains. 
Solid state polymerization of isobutene (m.p. 128 K) initiated with 'Y-irradiation 
gives the ESR spectrum presented in Figure 4.22298,2300). 
Fig. 4.2. ESR spectrum of -y-irradiated isobutene in dark at 77 K and measured at 77 K2300) 
It consist of an 8-line spectrum with the separation of about 21 G. The hyperfine 
structure ofthe spectrum may be attributed to radicals of the type R-CH2-C(CH3h. 
ESR studies of free radicals formed in 'Y-irradiated solid tetrafluoroethylene 
(m.p. 130.5 K) at 77 K324, 325) and 4.2 K1550) and adsorbed on silica ge11945) have 
also been reported. 
A xenon matrix isolation technique has also been applied to ESR studies of the 
primary processes in 'Y-irradiated ethylene1606) and tetrafluoroethylene1607). The 
main radical species which was observed in xenon-ethylene matrix was the ethyl 
radical (Fig. 4.3).

The concentration of ethyl radicals in a xenon matrix decreased to zero in 1-2 days 
even at 77 K (Figs. 4.4b and 4.4c) and after their disappearance a broad spectrum 
was obtained (Figs. 4.4c and 4.5a), which may be assigned to a polymer (oligomer) 
radical 1 606).

4.2. Ionizing Polymerization 
It is well known that pure ethylene is not polymerized in the solid state by 'Y-irradia-
tion at 77 K. During 'Y-irradiation of ethylene in xenon matrix, an energy transfer 
from xenon to ethylene monomer may take place. The mobility of ethylene radicals 
in a xenon-matrix may be higher than in pure solid ethylene. The polymer radical 
was found to isomerize upon UV-irradiation ().. > 3000 A) and the isomerized radical 
species has a well-resolved six-line spectrum (Fig. 4.5 b), which can reversibly be trans-
formed after storage in liquid nitrogen into the former broad spectrum (Fig. 4.5c). 
ESR spectrum of 'Y-irradiated pure tetrafluoroethylene consists of a broad com-
ponent at the centre and "wing peaks" (Fig. 4.6)1607). 
This spectrum was assigned to -CF2-CF2 polymer radical. On the other hand, ESR 
spectrum of 'Y-irradiated tetrafluoroethylene in xenon matrix (Fig. 4.7) shows several 
fragment radicals, e.g. ·CF 3. 
This result suggests that the scission of carbon-carbon bond takes place by 'Y-irradia-
tion of tetrafluoroethylene in xenon matrices. 
4.2.1.2. Dienes 
Butadiene can be polymerized by radical, cationic, and anionic mechanisms476). 
ESR studies of ionizing radiation-induced polymerization of 1,3-butadiene show 
that cation radicals (4.1) are precursors of allyl type radicals (4.2) which are formed 
by the following mechanism: 
'Y

The signal has been attributed to allyl free radical (4.2)1395, 1973). Detailed analysis

Where S* represents an active (electron-accepting) centre formed on the gel

(4.16) 
The mechanism of 'Y-irradiation initiated polymerization of 1 ,3-butadiene in 
CCl4 crystalline matrix at 77 K occurs also via the formation of butadiene cation 
radicalsI974,1975). 
It has been shown 113,932,2139,2140) that free radicals formed during electron 
irradiation of other diene monomers as isoprene, 1,3-pentadiene, and 2,3-dimethyl-
1,3-butadiene are quite different from those produced by chemical free radical initia-
tion or UV-irradiation (Table 4.2). 
The ESR spectrum of isoprene irradiated with electrons at 77 K is shown in Figure 4.9. 
The spectrum consists of seven lines with a hyperfine coupling constant of 14 G and 
has been attributed to free radical of the allylic type (4.4):

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
The process of the formation of allylic free radicals is probably an ion-molecule reac-
tion involving a cation-radical as a reaction intermediate: 
(4.17) 
(4.18) 
(4.19) 
Similarily the ESR spectra of electron-irradiated 1,3-pentadiene (Fig. 4. lOa) and 
2,3-dimethyl-l,3-butadiene (Fig. 4.11 a) in crystalline state are different from those 
obtained in photo-initiated free radical polymerization (Figs. 4.10b) and 4.11 b).

For 1,3-pentadiene the following ion-radical initiation mechanism has been proposed. 
An ion-radical is primarily formed by the loss of one 7r-electron from a monomer 
molecule by the ionizing radiation. This molecule-ion is then added to a monomer 
and in this way initiates the cationic polymerization from its ionic end:

4.2. Ionizing Polymerization 
(4.21) 
The radical end of the parent ion-radical, which becomes isolated from the ionic and 
by the ionic propagation, is thought to be unreactive at 77 K (i.e. of low reactivity 
compared with the cationic chain ends) and trapped in the solid monomer matrix. 
The observed radicals are inactive radical residues involved in the ionic propagation 
process, though their ESR spectra are the same as those expected for a propagating 
free-radical end in radical polymerization. Primary ion-radicals are not observed by 
ESR measurements, because ion-radicals are unstable and reactive even at 77 K. 
ESR study of polymerization of butadiene in urea canal complexes (clathrates) 
presents a separate problem. A detailed review of the polymerization of different 
monomers in clathrates has been published by Rabek 1776, 1778). The ESR spectrum 
of -y-irradiated 1,3-butadiene in urea clathrates at 77 K consists of 7 lines (Fig. 4.12) 
with a hyperfine splitting constant of 15 G1637).

This spectrum was assigned to monomer radical of the allylic type (4.5) 
·CH2 -CH=CH-CH3 
(4.5) 
which may be produced by hydrogen addition to 1,3-butadiene. Upon warming to 
room-temperature the spectrum changes into 6 x 2-line spectrum (Fig. 4.13a) 
(a1 = 14 G and a2 = 4 G), which was attributed to the propagating radical (4.6) 
occluded in the urea canals.

4.2. Ionizing Polymerization 
On cooling back to 77 K, the 6 x 2-line spectrum is transformed into a 5-line spectrum 
(Fig. 4.13b) (a = 14 G). 
This spectral change is reversible with temperature and it is interpreted in terms of 
the oscillation of the propagating radical around the COl-CI'l bond. On further warm-
ing to 400 K the propagating radical is converted to the "chain" allyl type radical 
(4.7), the room temperature ESR spectrum of which consists of 7 x 2-lines (al = 14 G, 
a2 = 4 G) (Fig. 4.14). 
R-CH2 -CH=CH-CH-CH2 -R 
(4.7) 
This radical conversion is explained by a hydrogen transfer reaction within the pro-
pagating radical through the radical chain and/or between the propagating radical 
and a neighboring polymer chain. Irradiated 1 ,3-butadiene-l,1 ,4,4-d4 (deuteriated 
butadiene) in urea canals was also examined and the results confirm the above-
mentioned identifications I637). 
4.2.1.3. Cyclic Olefines 
ESR studies of -r-irradiated cyclopentadiene at 77 K as polycrystalline (Fig. 4.15) 
and glassy (Fig. 4.16) samples show the formation of two different radicals. 
One of these radicals was identified as a radical of the type (4.8) with five equivalent 
protons (Fig. 4.15) formed by hydrogen abstraction and the second to a cation radi-
cal (4.9) (Fig. 4.16) formed by electron transfer55, 642, 1375, 1646). Based on ESR 
studies of -reradiation-induced polymerization of cyclic olefins the following mecha-

tion in solid-state. Ohnishi et al. 1993) identified the free radicals formed during electron 
beam or 'Y-irradiation of a single crystal of acrylic acid at 77 K and made a detailed 
study of the hyperfine structure of the spectrum, which is shown in Figure 4.17 a.

This double quartet spectrum was attributed to radical (4.10): 
CH3-CH-COOH 
(4.10) 
Mter annealing the sample at 150-200 K the double quartet spectrum decayed to a 
triplet attributed to a propagation radical (4.11): 
R-CH2-CH-COOH 
(4.11) 
where R is a chain containing an indefinite number of units 707). Above 250 K an 
irreversible reaction is observed. 
It has been shownI883-1885) that the free radicals trapped in 'Y-irradiated poly-
crystalline methacrylic acid have the same structure as· those trapped in solid poly-
(methacrylic acid) when irradiated with ionizing radiation. This free radical was at· 
tributed to propagating radical (4.12): 
(4.12) 
The lifetime and the ESR spectrum of this radical are different, depending on the 
matrix which surrounds the radicals. The radicals trapped in thepoly(methacrylic 
acid) are fairly stable even at room-temperature, while the radicals trapped in the 
crystalline methacrylic acid monomer are stable only at low temperatures and can-

in the monomer matrix and in the polymer matrix are shown in Figure 4.18. 
The ESR spectrum of the radicals in the monomer matrix changes with temperature. 
These radicals have a 9-line (5 + 4) structure in phase II (below the transition point) 
(Fig. 4.18a) and a 13-line (5 + 8) spectrum in phase I (above the transition)(Fig. 4.18b). 
It has been shown that the radicals in the monomer matrix have an asymmetrical 
conformation. The two ~-protons of the propagating radical (4.12) have unequal 
coupling constants, giving the conformational angle of the half-filled p-orbital to the 
C-H bond as 55° and 65°, respectively. These conformations may depend on the 
length of the radical chain, the temperature, and the environment. 
4.2.1.4.2. Acrylamides. During 'Y-irradiation of a single crystal of acrylamide at 77 K 
the free radical (4.13) is only formed and stable up to 148 K26, 27). 
CH3 -CH-CO-NH2

(4.14) 
which retains a definite direction with respect to the crystallographic axes up to

actually occur and the radicals then exhibit random orientations. Additional informa-
tion on hyperfine structure of free radicals (4.13) have been obtained from ESR 
spectra of irradiated polycrystalline acrylamide4IS). 
A detailed ESR study of a 'Y-irradiated single crystal of methacrylamide in the 
temperature range from 77 K to 288 K have been presented in paper2323). The num-
ber and the spacings of the spectral lines change according to the temperature of 
irradiation and not to the temperature of measurements. ESR study of 'Y-irradiated 
polycrystalline methacrylamide232S) show that the free radicals stable at room-
temperature begin to change their conformation near the melting point.

of.crystal imperfections as reaction sites has been pointed outl3S, 138).

77 K in the dark is shown in Figure 4.19.

The spectrum is composed of a seven-line component, a broad Singlet, and an 
additional outer group of weak spectrallinesl93, 297, 774,1181,2131). The seven line 
spectrum with a coupling constant of 22 G with the intensity ratio of 1 : 6: 10: 20:-
10 : 6 : 1 was assigned to the initiating radical (4.15) which is formed by the addition 
of a hydrogen atom to the monomer:

4.2. Ionizing Polymerization 
The spectrum is changed by photo-illumination of the irradiated sample as shown in 
Figure 4.20. 
By illuminating it with light in the wavelength region above 4000 A, the singlet de-
cays rapidly and the intensity of the outer spectrum with fine structure decreases 
gradually. The singlet may be attributed to trapped electrons. The outer spectrum, 
which disappears completely, is assigned to a radical pair774, 2131) (see Chapter 
4.2.1.4.8.). These radical pairs absorb energy and are excited by illumination of 
light above 3000 A; then the radicals disappear by combining with each other. 
The main spectrum was found to change gradually from the seven-line spectrum 
to a five-line spectrum by the photo-illumination2131). These experimental results 
indicate that the initiation radicals can be converted to propagating radicals by photo-
excitation at 77 K. 
The temperature dependence of the ESR spectrum of a photo-bleached sample 
is shown in Figure 4.21.

The intensity of the spectrum decreases with increasing temperature in the region 
103 K to 312 K. On the other hand, the seven-line spectrum changes to a nine-line 
spectrum during the temperature elevation. The nin-line spectrum becomes sharper 
at 213 K. This means that the propagation reaction takes place slowly during the 
increase of temperature. In the course of temperature increase of nonbleached samples 
from 77 K, it was observed that the radical pairs disappear at 213 K. On the other 
hand, the concentration of initiating radicals was observed to be increased by photo-
bleaching of trapped electrons. It seems that new initiating radicals are produced by 
the neutralization. An ESR study of 'Y-irradiated polymerization of methyl metha-
crylate in mineral oils has been presented in paper1424). 
The 'Y-initiated polymerization of octadecyl methacrylate in solid state has also 
been extensively studied252). 
4.2.1.4.4. Acrylonitrile and Methacrylonitrile. Radiation-induced solid-state poly-
merization of these monomers was studied by ESR spectroscopy153, 154, 193, 194, 
196,461,772,1066,1529,1657). ESR spectra of acrylonitrile recorded at 88 K and

177 K after 'Y-irradiation in polycrystalline state at 77 K in the dark are shown in 
Figure 4.22. 
When the sample temperature is increased, the observed spectrum is irreversibly trans-
formed. Two out of the five lines progressively disappear. The three-line spectrum, 
with intensity 1 : 2: 1 was, attributed to the propagating radical (4.16): 
(4.16) 
where R is a chain containing an indefinite number of units. 
The ESR spectrum of 'Y-irradiated methacrylonitrile l529) is a seven-line spectrum 
which has been attributed to radical (4.17) formed by addition of a hydrogen atom 
to the vinyl group. 
(4.17) 
By warming the irradiated monomer to about 223 K the spectrum is changed to a 
5(+4)-line spectrum which corresponds to a propagating radical with a very short 
chain. However, post-polymerization to high molecular weight does not actually 
take place. 
4.2.1.4.5. Vinyl Acetate. Free radicals produced by 'Y-irradiation of vinyl acetate in 
the solid-state have been studied by ESR 153, 935). An oriented solid vinyl acetate 
sample was prepared for ESR measurements by solidification of vinyl acetate around 
an aluminium rod at 77 K or 156 K and then 'Y-irradiated at 77 K. The oriented 
crystalline solid prepared at 156 K gives an ESR spectrum consisting of a singlet 
(Fig. 4.23) and additional absorption lines, especially when the irradiation was made 
in the dark at 77 K (Fig. 4.24). 
After irradiation with visible light for 10 min the ESR spectra of oriented crystalline 
solid vinyl acetate exhibit a distinct hyperfine structure (Fig. 4.25) and a definite 
anisotropy when the sample is rotated in the magnetic field. 
These spectra consist of a quartet with the coupling constant 12.5 G, an anisotropic 
triplet (coupling constant 33 G*») and four equivalent lines (doublet of doublet with 
coupling constants 20.8 G and 143 G*» corresponding to the radicals (4.18), (4.19)

Prolonged irradiation with visible light for 300 minutes yields an apparent five-line

(Fig. 4.26) which was attributed to the radicals (4.21) and (4.19) respectively.

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
The ESR spectrum of -y-irradiated glassy solid samples of vinyl acetate prepared at 
77 K consists of four strong lines (Fig. 4.27) which are confirmed to be isotropic 
and a weak doublet splitted by 143 G2) corresponding to radical (4.20).

Irradiation of glassy solid vinyl acetate with visible light for 30 minutes gives a sharp 
quartet (Fig. 4.28) with a splitting constant 23 G and assigned to methyl radical 
(4.22) produced by further photolysis of radical (4.18).

(4.22) 
A broad triplet with a coupling constant 22 G becomes observable on elevation of 
the temperature to 113 K and remains unchanged up to 173 K. This triplet was 
assigned to radical (4.19). The ESR studies indicate that both the crystalline and 
the glassy vinyl acetate produce the same radicals on irradiation. 
4.2.1.4.6. Styrene. Solid-state polymerization of styrene initiated with -y-irradiation 
in polycrystalline form2260) gives a broad ESR spectrum as shown in Figure 4.29a. 
After warming up the sample to about 221 K a five-line spectrum with a coupling 
constant of about 16 G is observed (Fig. 4.29b). This spectrum was attributed to 
free radicals (4.23) formed by hydrogen addition to the vinyl group. 
(4.23) 
The coupling constant of the methyl protons is as low as about 16 G, and that of 
the a-proton has also about the same value due to the delocalization of the free spin. 
Therefore a five-line spectrum is expected.

Above 90 K polymerization initiated by the cation occurs and the spectrum changes 
into four lines (1 : 3 : 3 : 1) at certain orientations and into six lines (1 : 1 : 2: 2: 1 : 1) 
at others (Fig. 4.30b). This spectrum may be assigned to an alkyl radical (4.25), 
trapped in the polymer108, 118). Unfortunately the ESR spectra give no information 
about the polymerization, since the unpaired spin is left on the nonactive end of the 
chain (4.26):

has been reported for many organic substances148, 328, 584, 745,1255,1256,1258,1319). 
The theory of ESR spectra of radical pairs is discussed in several papers 774, 793, 923,

The ESR spectra of radical pairs in 'Y-irradiated vinyl monomers in polycrystalline 
or single crystal state consist of series of outer lines. Radical pairs are observed as 
dMs = 1 and dMs = 2 transitions. 
As mentioned in Chapter 4.2.1.4.3. 'Y-irradiation of polycrystalline methyl metha-
crylate gives a spectrum with seven broad lines and additional outer groups of spectral 
lines forming the pairs marked (B1 , B2 ) and (B3, B4 ) (Fig. 4.31).

A pair of radicals gives a spectrum consisting of two groups of 13 lines with a hyper-
fine coupling constant of 11.2 G. The distance between the radicals forming the pairs 
is between 5.45 and 6.3 A. 774) or less than 6.67 A. 2131).

Beside the central five-line spectrum there are four groups of lines forming the pairs 
(B1' B2) and (B3' B4). The mean value of the hyperfine coupling constant is 10.8 G. 
The distance between the radicals in one of the pairs was calculated to be 5.9 A..

mtrile Sives the formation of radical pairs. In Figure 4.33 the ESR spectrum of 
methacrylonitrile single crystal or-irradiated at 77 K is shown. 
The complex central part of this spectrum (Fig. 4.33) was not analyzed, but on the 
wings there are two strongly anisotropic groups of lines assigned to radical pairs. The 
hyperfine coupling constant within each group was measured and found to be 
10.8 ± 2 G, and the maximum splitting between the outermost groups was 351 G, 
which corresponds to a radical distance r < 5.4 A. When the crystal was illuminated 
with red light (>4750 A), the radical pair (1) was slowly bleached and a new pair (II) 
appeared with its spectrum placed closer to the central spectrum, as illustrated in 
Figure 4.33 b. The maximum splitting of pair II, 207 G corresponds to r < 6.45 A. 
Further rotation of a bleached crystal showed that yet another radical pair (III) was 
present with a maximum splitting of 228 G, which gives a calculated separation 
r < 6.25 A between the radicals. For the pairs II and III, six lines were observed on 
the high-field side of the central line in the radical pair spectra as shown in Figure 4.34.

The ESR spectra of an irradiated acrolein single crystal are very anisotropic and

4.2.2. Polymerization in Organic Glass Matrices 
4.2.2.1. ESR Studies of Ionic Processes in 'Y-Irradiated Organic Glasses 
During 'Y-irradiation of some frozen organic glasses radical cations and electrons 
(anionic intermediates) are formed. Electrons are directly trapped in the frozen glassy 
state at 77 K858, 1906,2350,2410) and 4.2 K2033, 2461). 
The following organic glasses have been examined: 
1. n-Butylchloride1l9, 2027, 2458, 2462). After 'Y irradiation at 77 K n-butyl-
chloride shows a six-line spectrum (Fig. 4.36) due to n-butyl radicals. 
In this glassy state, the liberated electrons are captured by n-butylchloride molecules 
and the anionic intermediates are stabilized as Cl-. Therefore, primary cationic inter-
mediates, i.e. cation radicals of n-butylchloride, have a long lifetime, and they can 
migrate in n-butylchloride glass probably by positive charge transfer. 
2. 3-Methylpentane616, 726, 996, 1007, 1012, 1118, 1119, 1369, 1371, 1373, 1997, 1999, 
2289,2292,2295,2303,2458). The ESR spectrum of 'Y-irradiated 3-methylpentane in 
glassy state is shown in Figure 4.371007). 
It is composed of a broad six-line spectrum, which was attributed to 3-methyl-
pentyl radicals and a central sharp spectrum assigned to the trapped electrons. The 
later spectrum is characterized by g = 2.0025 ± 0.0003 and the width 3.7 G. Trapped 
electrons are readily bleached out by room lights and the signal shape changes as 
shown in Figure 4.37 (dotted line). Trapped electrons rapidly disappear even at 77 K 
(Fig. 4.38).

substraction of the value corresponding 
to the stright line A from the observed 
values. Line A represents, the slowly dis-
appearing electrons and line B represents 
the fast disappearing electrons2458) 
It is seen from Figure 4.38 that this disappearance is described by the superposition 
of two first-order reactionsl007, 2458). The first-order decays indicate that the elec-
trons recombine with their counterpart cations. 
Trapped electrons may be classified into two groupsl007): 
1. Those which are stabilized in shallow traps and decay rapidly. 
2. Those which are trapped deeply and decay slowly. The recombination of the 
slowly disappearing electrons with positive charges is interpreted as being brought 
about mainly by the migration of the positive charge, while the recombination of the 
fast disappearing electrons should be caused by the migration of the electrons in the 
3-methylpentane glass. 
No evidence for cation radicals of 3-methylpentane has been obtained by ESR 
spectroscopy.

Cationic intermediates are stabilized in the vicinity of their native site, and only the 
electrons migrate in the glass until they are trapped. The decay of trapped electrons 
at 77 K in the dark is very slow and this fact suggests that cation intermediates are 
trapped through the reactions (4.33) and (4.34), while the electrons are also trapped 
by the electric dipole of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran molecules and the charge recombina-
tion reaction is suppressed2458). Thermal decay of trapped electrons is reasonably 
well understood as being due to neutralization by positively charged entities which 
are not identified at present. The first-order decay of trapped electrons suggests that 
each electron reacts with a predestined partner. According to Smith and Pieroni2031), 
trapped electrons and free radicals or radical ions are distributed inhomogeneously, 
with local concentrations of these species 11 ± 5 times higher than the bulk concentra-
tion estimated on the assumption of homogeneous distribution. If this "spur model" 
of initial distribution is correct, neutralization reactions apparently occur in the spur. 
The thermal decay of trapped electrons in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran has also been 
studied by means of rapid-scan measurements1630). The decay curve of trapped elec-
trons was found to be a superposition of two reactions having different first-order 
rate constant (Fig. 4.40). 
These rate constants were determined to be 2.2 x 10-1 S-1 and 4.5 x 10-2 s-l at 
93 K for the fast and the slow reactions respectively. The fast and slow decay reac-
tions of trapped electrons were ascribed to two kinds of positive entities in the 
spurs1630). The mechanism of the electron trapping was also studied at 4.2 K2033,2461), 
and under very high doses of irradiation 1998). Application of ENDOR spectroscopy

4.2.2.2. ESR Studies of Ionic Polymerization in Organic Glass Matrices 
In the last decade several ESR studies have been devoted to the radiation-induced 
polymerization of monomer-solvent mixture which form glasses at low temperatures 
and have been reviewed in detail by Hayashi and Yoshida883, 2458). The ionic radical 
formation of the following monomers have been studied: nitroethylene884, 1656,2293, 
2301,2445,2458), isobutene884, 1656,2264,2300), dienes1395, 1965, 1971, 1974, 1975), 
vinyl ethers883, 1008, 1009,2458), acrylic monomer771 , 777,1027), acrylonitrile238), 
styrene883, 1023,2260,2299,2458,2462) and a-methylstyrene2457, 2462). 
When an organic glass matrix (S) (see Chap. 4.2.2.1.) is -y-irradiated, the primary 
reaction is the ionization of organic glass with the formation of electrons and radical 
cations (Fig. 4.41). 
Most of the electrons and radical cations recombine immediately, but some of them 
may react further. If the organic glass, e.g. 2-methyltetrahydrofuran or n-butyl 
chloride contairl a small amount of monomer (M), the secondary reaction of elec-
trons with monomer gives radical anions which may initiate anionic polymerization. 
The radical cation of organic glass can undergo positive charge transfer or proton 
transfer to monomer and in both cases may initiate a cationic polymerization 
(Fig. 4.41). 
In 3-methylpentane glass, the anionic reaction and/or the cationic reaction may 
occur, depending on the nature of the monomer. ConSidering the properties of organic 
glasses, we can assume that 2-methyltetrahydrofuran is useful for studies of the an-

4.2.2.2.1. Nitroethylene. 'Y-Irradiation of a small amount of nitroethylene (1.5 mole %) 
in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran glass gives an ESR spectrum as shown in Figure 4.42a885• 
2293,2301) 
The comparison between this signal and the signal of pure 2-methyltetrahydrofuran 
glass, shows that the solute nitroethylene captures the electrons, eliminating the sharp 
electron spectrum. New anionic intermediates are formed, which are paramagnetic 
and give a new ESR spectrum, indicated in Figure 4.42 by arrows. 
'Y-Irradiation of a larger amount of nitroethylene (28 mole %) in 2-methyltetra-
hydrofuran glass, gives an ESR spectrum as shown in Figure 4.42 b. When the tem-
perature is increased, the seven-line spectrum, due to the free radicals formed from 
2-methyltetrahydrofuran, disappears, leaving a new spectrum. This spectrum has the 
hyperfine structure due to three protons with the hyperfine constant of 16 G and a 
nitrogen nucleus with the coupling constant 8 G. The hyperfine spectrum suggests 
that it is due to the anion radicals of nitroethylene. The anion radicals disappear 
89 

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
when the temperature of the glass is increased to 133 K. The spectrum of the anion 
radicals is bleached by visible light by photo-detachment of electrons from the anion 
radicals. Because of the low concentration of nitroethylene and its low mobility in 
the glass matrices, the degree of polymerization will be low, about 2102301). Another 
mechanism for the initiation process can be proposed. Free electrons are formed 
primarily from solvent molecules by irradiation (4.32) and are then readily captured 
by nitroethylene molecules, giving anion radicals of nitro ethylene which are primary 
intermediates of the monomer (4.35): 
(4.37) 
(4.35) 
The reaction (4.35) is favored by the strong electron affinity of nitroethylene. The 
carbanion (4.38) may be formed by an ion-molecule reaction between the anion 
radicals (4.31) and nitroethylene molecules (4.36). The nitroethylene is successively 
added. The polymerization proceeds by anionic propagation (4.37)2458).

4.2.2.2.2. Isobutene. Isobutene 'Y-irradiated in 3-methylpentane glass at 77 K in the 
dark gives the ESR spectra presented in Figure 4.43. 
The spectrum consist of an eight-line component with the hyperfine separation of 
about 23 G, a IS-line component with 11.5 G separation and a sharp singlet spectrum. 
With a decreasing fraction of isobutene in the mixture, the IS-line spectrum reduces 
its intensity relative to that of the eight-line spectrum. The singlet spectrum is bleached 
by visible light (Fig. 4.43b dotted line). These spectra were attributed to cation-radicals 
(4.40)2300>, which can be formed by the following mechanism: When pure 3-methyl-
pentane (MP) is 'Y-irradiated, the ejected electrons recombine readily with their parent 
cations (4.39) because they are trapped unstably (4.38). When isobutene is added to 
3-methylpentane, the parent cations transfer their positive charge to isobutene (IB) 
(4.39).

77 K gives ESR spectrum shown in Figure 4.441965,1974). 
This spectrum has been attributed to butadiene cation-radicals (4.41) which are re-
sponsible for the cationic polymerization mechanism (4.44):

The successive addition of butadiene monomers to the cationic end produces the 
polymer of butadiene, yielding an allyl-type radical (4. 42) at the other end of the 
polymer chain.

The ESR spectrum of 1,3-butadiene -y-irradiated in the 2-methyltetrahydrofuran 
glass at 77 K is shown in Figure 4.45 1965, 1974).

4.2. Ionizing Polymerization 
Butadiene cation-radicals (4.41) add to monomers, yielding the allyl-type radical 
(4.42) in reaction (4.44). It is seen that the type of propagation, cationically (4.44) 
or anionically (4.46), depends on the type of organic glass matrix in which the reac-
tion occurs under 'Y-irradiation.

spectrum shown in Figure 4.49 1009). 
The septet-line spectrum and a sharp Singlet spectrum have been attributed to free 
radicals formed by intramolecular hydrogen transfer in the primary 2-methyltetra-

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
hydrofuran cation-radicals (4.36) (see reaction 4.33) and trapped electrons, respec-
tively. There are no cation-radicals of methyl vinyl ether formed in this glass matrix. 
The yield of trapped electrons increases remarkably with increasing concentration 
of methyl vinyl ether in 3-methylhexane glass (a nonpolar solvent), while the increase 
is insignificant in 2-methyltetrahydrofurane glass (a polar solvent). The rate of photo-
bleaching of the trapped electrons with visible light decreases with the addition of 
methyl vinyl ether to 3-methylhexane, while it increases in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. 
The bleaching of trapped electrons results in the formation of methyl radicals by a 
dissociative electron capture process: 
(4.48) 
The dissociative electron capture process of methyl vinyl ether occurs when the elec-
trons are liberated from their physical traps by visible light. This is interpreted to 
mean that the cross section of methyl vinyl ether for physical electron trapping is 
larger than that for dissociative electron capture. Under the visible light illumination, 
the electrons are repeatedly de trapped and trapped and finally captured by methyl 
vinyl ether to give methyl radicals1009). 
Similar ESR studies have been made with n-butyl vinyl ether 'Y-irradiated in 
3-methylpentane glass matrix at 77 K 1008,2458). 
4.2.2.2.5. Acrylic Acid. An interesting ESR study has been made of the reaction of 
electrons with acrylic acid in glass matrices having no polar proton such as 2-methyl-
tetrahydrofuran, triethylamine, and 3-methylhexane, and in solvents having polar 
protons such as alcohols, alkaline ice (8 N NaOH-frozen), and propionic acid1027). 
ESR spectra of acrylic acid 'Y-irradiated in the frozen glasses 2-methyl-tetrahydro-
fiuan (Fig. 4.50) and triethylamine (Fig. 4.51) show formation of a three-line spec-
trum which was attributed to the anion radical (4.45). 
[CH2 =CHCOOH]·-
(4.45) 
It is assumed that the acrylic acid anion radical (4.45) is a delocalized rr radical having 
the resonance structure (4.46): 
(4.46) 
where the unpaired electron mainly occupies the p orbital of the C atoms in the end 
COOH or CH2 groups. The 1 : 2: 1 three-line feature of the spectrum with the coup-
ling 8.5 G indicates that it is due to a species having two equivalent protons. The outer 
two lines of the three-line spectrum exhibit familiar line shape arising from the hyper-
fine anisotropy of a-proton couplings. Figure 4.50d shows the simulated spectrum 
for the -CH2 rr radical assuming the typical anisotropy of a proton coupling with 
spin a density of 0.5 on the radical carbon atom. 
A frozen methanol glass containing 5% water and ca. 2 mol % acrylic acid 'Y-irra-
diated at 77 K did not give the ESR signal of the anion radical (4.45 or 4.46) or of

tially the same as that of 'Y-irradiated pure acrylic acid, indicating an efficient yield 
of hydrogen addition radical. This spectrum was attributed to the dissociated (basic) 
form offree radical (4.48): 
(4.48) 
Rapid protonation in alcohol and alkaline ice matrices may be interpreted by two 
alternative mechanism: direct proton transfer from surrounding solvent molecules 
(4.49 and 4.51) or proton transfer from the protonated cation of the solvent (4.50 
and 4.52).

The main ESR spectrum has been attributed to radical anions of methyl methacrylate 
(4.49) formed by trapping of electrons in the glass: 
(4.49) 
The radical anion (4.49) in the 2-methyltetrahydrofuran glass is bleached by visible 
light and methyl radicals derived from the methoxy group are produced. In the 
3-methylpentane glass the radical anion (4.49) is bleached by infrared light and no 
methyl radicals were observed.

ethyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate, acrolein, acrylarnide, acrylic acid, crotonic acid, 
and methyl crotonate in organic glasses have also been described771).

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
Anion radicals (4.51) formed in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran1010, 1023,2260,2465) can-
not initiate anionic polymerization, whereas cation-radicals (4.52) formed in n-butyl 
chloride1023) may react with monomer to (4.53) and give cationic polymerization at 
one chain end. 
4.2.3. Ionizing Polymerization-Miscellaneous Problems 
ESR spectroscopy has also been applied to studies of radiation-induced polymeriza-
tion of formaldehyde 420), acetaldehyde 419), maleimide 1 071), ethylene oxide 1609), 
and vinyl fluoride, vinylidene fluoride and vinyl chloride 1608) in xenon matrices, 
methyl methacrylate in sulphur dioxide 1106), N-vinylpyrrolidone 1545), vinylsi-
loxanes1186), acrylamide-water solid systems30), and cyclopolymerization of acrylic 
and methacrylic anhydrides1021). 
ESR studies of copolymerization of ethylene with vinyl acetate655) and also 
styrene with methyl methacrylate in the polymer matrix at high pressure247) have 
been reported. 
4.3. Photopolymerization 
Without photoinitiators or photo sensitizers added, the ESR signals obtained in direct 
photopolymerization of pure monomers are generally too weak for identification of 
radical species. 
In "photosensitized polymerization" various organic or inorganic substances, 
which are decomposed readily fo form free radicals under UV irradiation, are added 
to monomers. Various types of photosensitizers for photopolymerization are re-
viewed by Oster and Yang1676) and Rabek1775, 1779). The mechanism involved in 
photosensitized reactions is inadequately known and cannot, therefore, be used for

reactions according to the chemical nature of the sensitizers. 
4.3.1. Photosensitized by Hydrogen Peroxide 
Hydroxyl radicals (HO·) are mainly associated with 'Y·radiolysis of aqueous solutions. 
Chemically, hydroxyl radicals can be readily generated from hydrogen peroxide by 
direct W_irradiation1382, 2044, 2127). ESR spectra from photolyzed hydrogen per-
oxide are shown in Figure 4.60. 
ESR spectra of hydroxyl (HO·) and hydroperoxy (HOO·) radicals may only be ob· 
served in frozen glassy state995, 1794,2333) and their parameters are listed in Table 4.3. 
Hydroxyl radicals react with organic substrates, e.g. alcohols 766, 1382, 1383) and a 
variety of carbon-centered radicals. Hydroxyl radicals are capable of initiating free 
radical polymerization of different monomers. Kuwata et al.1280) have applied ESR 
spectroscopy to study steady-state photopolymerization of vinyl acetate and methyl 
methacrylate using hydrogene peroxide as initiator, whereas Fischer and Hefter899) 
have investigated reaction kinetics of free radicals formed from photolysis of H20 2 
with acrylonitrile in methanol. 
4.3.2. Photosensitized by Hydroperoxides and Peroxides 
The tert-butyl peroxy radical (4.54) (g = 2.0137) is formed during the photolysis of

Photolysis of tert-butyl hydroperoxide on silica gel at 77 K produces an asymmetric 
singlet, unchanged after prolonged irradiation (Fig. 4;61). 
This ESR spectrum has been attributed to tert-butyl peroxy radical (4.54). Photo-
lysis of liquid cumene hydroperoxide and isopropyl hydroperoxide also produces 
peroxy radicals218, 1003, 1325, 2178).

Photolysis of tert-butyl peroxide on silica gel at 77 K gives an ESR spectrum consist-
ing of a quartet (approximate intensity ratio 1 : 3: 3: 1) superimposed on a triplet 
(Fig. 4.62). 
The quartet with splitting of 23.8 G has been attributed to methyl radical, whereas 
the triplet with splitting of about 20 G to the radical (4.56)1405). 
ESR spectroscopy has been applied to the study of: 
polymerization of dienes2139,214O) and acrylonitrile14O, 141, 143,456,1003) photo-
sensitized by tert-butyl peroxide, 
zinc alkyl-peroxides (or hydro peroxides) initiator system for polymerization1565, 1854), 
'benzoyl peroxide interpreted as photo polymerization of methyl methacrylate 1181, 
1182,1752,2055,2056) 
styrene294,295), 
and copolymerization of maleic anhydride with dimethylbutadiene2078). 
The ESR spectrum of radical species formed by UV-irradiation of methyl metha-
crylate at 77 K with 0.1 wt. % of benzoyl peroxide shows the superposition of a 
septet, an asymmetric Singlet, and a doublet from hydrogen atoms (Fig. 4.63)1181). 
The asymmetric singlet and the septet spectrum are assigned as due to a benzoyl per-
oxy radical (4.57) and a methyl methacrylate parent radical (4.58), respectively. 
These radicals may be formed by the following reactions:

After warming to higher temperatures, the observed ESR spectrum changes and a new 
pattern, which contains a septet and a quintet, is formed. The latter signal might be 
due to methyl methacrylate to which a benzoyl peroxy radical is added (4.59)1181,

cals of different structural types, and the competition between addition to a C=C

4.3.5. Photosensitized by Benzophenone 
The observation of formation of the triplet state of benzophenone by ESR spectro· 
scopy is only possible in the solid·state (single crystal) at 4.2 K I95 l). UV-irradiation 
of benzophenone in solution, e.g. in isopropyl alcohol, leads to ketyl radicals (4.62) 
and dimethyl·hydroxy methyl radicals (4.63)2143):

The benzophenone ketyl radicals (4.62) have a short lifetime (80 ms) and for that 
reason it is difficult to determine their ESR spectral 546). Iwakura et a1.1022) found 
that benzophenone ketyl radicals are stably trapped in cellulose triacetate film after 
UV irradiation of the film containing benzophenone. Using this method the ESR 
spectra of various substituted benzophenone ketyl radicals were determined (Fig. 4.64).

4.3. Photo polymerization 
Yoshida and Warashina2472), using a special UV-irradiation method1382), have 
obtained ESR spectra of ketyl radicals (4.62) with well-resolved hyperfine structure 
consisting of 150 lines (partly overlapping) (Fig. 4.65). 
The structure of this ESR spectrum is described as containing four equivalent protons 
in ortho-position of the rings with a hyperfine coupling constant of 3.1 G, four pro-
tons at meta-position with a coupling constant of 1.2 G, two protons a para-position 
of the rings with a coupling constant of 3.6 G, and one proton in the hydroxyl group 
with a constant of 2.9 G. 
Benzophenone is a very effective sensitizer for photo polymerization , photografting, 
and photodegradation1779, 1783). Until now, there are no detailed ESR studies of the 
photoinitiation process of polymerization by benzophenone published in the literature. 
4_3.6. Quinones 
Formation of semiquinone anions and semiquinone radicals during reduction or oxi-
dation processes between quinones and hydroquinones, have been observed by 
ESR92, 463,525,801,846, 1245,2023,2073,2075,23-2357,2422,2460) and ENDOR92). 
The semiquinone anion radical was observed by photolysis of benzoquinone2460) 
and duroquinone8ol). When the solution of p-benzoquinone in ethanol is photolyzed, 
the ESR signal is observed as shown in Figure 4.66 a. 
5G

during photolysis of p-benzoqui-
none solution in ethanol: a. Spec-

tion. b. Spectrum due to benzo-
semiquinone radical in acidic solu-
tion containing 30-mmole of acetic 
acid2460) 
The signal is composed of a quintet spectrum and that of a doublet of triplets of 
small triplets. The former is attributed to the p-benzosemiquinone anion radical 
(4.64) with four equivalent protons, while the latter is due to the p-benzosemiqui-
none radical (4.65). When the solution is made acidic by adding a small amount of 
acetic acid, almost all of the semiquinone anions are transformed into the semiqui-
none radicals through protonation:

and only a weak spectrum of the semiquinone anion radical remains (Fig. 4.66 b). 
The mechanism of the formation of semiquinone anion and semiquinone radicals is 
given in the original papers. 
ESR spectra of radicals formed during photolysis of chloranil in solutions are 
reported in several papers847, 1101, 2429,2463). The ESR spectra observed in solutions 
in alcohols are identified as due to the neutral semiquinone radical (Fig. 4.67 a)2463).

Fig. 4.67. ESR spectra observed during photolysis of 1 mmol of chloranile at room temperature:

The peak-to-peak line width is 0.55 G. ESR spectrum of chloranil photolyzed in 
benzene solution is shown in Figure 4.67b. The spectrum has the width 3.4 G with-
out resolved hyperfine structure, and is much wider than the spectrum of the neutral 
semiquinone radical. These results suggest that the excited chloranil molecule under 
UV light may abstract hydrogen from a benzene ring. 
Quinones have a very important role in inhibiting polymerization processes and 
also as photosensitizers of polymer photodegradation and photooxidation 1814). But 
these problems have not yet been examined by ESR spectroscopy. 
4.3.7. Photosensitized by Azo-Compounds 
Detailed ESR studies of the free radicals formed during photolysis of several azo-
compounds have been made, e.g. azo-bis(isobutyronitrile)l1O, 221, 326, 341,1320,1384, 
1535, 1721,2042, 2397,2398,2493) and 1,1' -azobis (l-cyanocyclopentane)2038). 
During the photolysis of azo-bis(isobutyronitrile )(AIBN), 2-cyano-2-propyl radi-
cals (4.66) are formed by the following mechanism:

The photolysis of AIBN in toluene at 298 K gives a completely different ESR 
spectrum (Fig. 4.69)2042) assigned to the radical (4.66) in solution. 
AIBN is a very effective sensitizer for photopolymerization of methacrylic 
acid 142) and its esters 711,1610,2029,2036,2042). For each ester, two ESR spectra 
(Fig. 470) were observed, one from the radical (4.66) and the other from radicals 
formed by addition and having the general formula (4.67):

Bullock et a1. 344) measured the formation and the decay of free radicals trapped 
in poly(methyl methacrylate) gels which were produced either by direct UV-irradia-
tion (2537 J\.) of pure monomer or by photodecomposition (3650 A) of AIBN dis-
solved in pure monomer. ESR spectra showed two types of chain end radicals (4.68) 
and (4.69) and two types of allyl-radicals (4.70) and (4.71). It was proposed that the 
allyl radicals can be produced both by photodegradation of the polymer (4.73)-(4.74) 
and by reactions of other radicals (e.g. alkyl radicals) with the unsaturated end of 
polymer chains (4.75):

Decay curves for radicals obtained in the above experiments are shown in Figure 4.7l. 
Initially the propagating radical concentration falls rapidly and after prolonged heat-
ing it falls asymptotically. The allyl radical concentration, however, shows a short 
but sharp drop and thereafter it increases noticeably before decaying slowly during 
prolonged heating time. In the AIBN-initiated samples the initial spin concentrations 
are ten to thirty times lower than those of the directly photopolymerized samples. 
The propagating radical concentration decreases in about the same way in both cases. 
After an initial decrease, the rise in allyl radical concentration for the AIBN-initiated 
system (Fig. 4.71 b) is much more marked than for the corresponding curve in Figure 
4.71 a. In the directly photopolymerized samples the initial presence of allyl radicals 
can be accounted for in terms of photo-induced main chain scission and subsequent 
disproportionation of radical (4.69) into methyl formate and allyl radical (4.70) 
(reaction 4.74). This type of reaction cannot account for the allyl radicals in AIBN-
initiated samples, since the radiation of 3600 J\. has no effect on poly(methyl metha-

calor an AIBN fragment. Free allyl radicals (4.70) and (4.71) differ in structure, but 
trapped in a polymer matrix they cannot be differentiated by ESR. The low spin 
density on the central carbon atom, together with the large line widths, prevents the 
methyl protons in radical (4, 70) from showing resolved hyerfine splittings. 
ESR studies have also been made on methyl methacrylate photopolymerization 
initiated with 4,4' -azo (bis( 4-cyanopentanoic acid))2037),

Typical ESR spectra of propagating radicals of methyl methacrylate and acrylamide 
are shown in Figures 4.72, and 4.73, respectively. 
It was found that one type of propagating radical (4. 73) is formed in all cases of 
monomers investigated. Propagating radicals derived from methyl methacrylate were 
found to exist in two conformations, and radicals derived from methylacrylate in one 
conformation. The ESR spectra generated by the propagating radical in reaction 
4.77 are dependent on rotation at the Ca-C(3 bond and on interaction of Ha , H(31 
and H(32 (nonequivalent protons) with the unpaired electron on Ca. 
ESR spectroscopy has also been applied for the study of photopolymerization 
of vinyl monomers sensitized with ZnCI2, AICI3, AlBr3' SnCI4, TiCI4, TiBr4' and 
VC14753, 755, 938, 998,1420,1421,2518) and for photosensitized polymerization of 
N-vinylcarbazole with sodium chloroaurate (NaAuCI4 . 2 H20)81) . 
4.3.9. Photosensitized by Metal Acetylacetonates 
ESR spectroscopy has been used to study photopolymerization of vinyl monomers 
(e.g. methyl methacrylate) sensitized with metal acetylacetonates1068, 1069). Mn(acach 
and Co(acac)3 have a great sensitizing effect. Since sensitization is high in the wave-
length region of charge transfer absorption and low in the ligand region, photoreduc-
tion of Co(III) to Co(II) is suggested to occur during the formation of initiating radi-
cals. ESR spectroscopy shows that the initiation is due to acetylacetonyl radicals 
from the chelate. The central metal ion is simultaneously reduced. 
Barton and Horanska 159) have reported that some metal acetyl acetonates, e.g. 
copper(1I)-acetylacetonate in carbon tetrachloride, can themselves form radical inter-
mediates which may initiate the polymerization of vinyl monomers, e.g. styrene.

Figure 4.74 shows the ESR spectrum of a solution of copper(II)-acetylacetonate in 
CCk 
The hyperfine structure ofthe ESR spectrum (an equal quartet) is due to the inter-
action of the unpaired electron of Cu2+ with the nucleus having the spin I = 3/2. 
4.4. Thermal Polymerization 
ESR studies of growing polymer chain radicals formed by thermal initiation are made 
difficult by the high reactivity of free radicals at the usually required elevated tem-
peratures. This leads to low steady-state concentration of radicals. There are a few 
methods in which growing polymer chain radicals can be stabilized: 
1. Application of a polymer matrix for studies of growing chain radicals at high 
pressure. 
2. Stabilization of free radicals on the surface of synthetic zeolites. 
3. Spin-trapping method (see Chap. 11.3). 
4.4.1. Application of a Polymer Matrix for Studies of Growing Chain Radicals at 
High Pressure 
A new method which involves trapping the growing polymer chain radicals in poly-
mer matrix by thermal decomposition of benzoyl peroxide at high pressure has been 
described by Czechoslovakian scientists in several papers2106, 2108, 2109, 2113). 
The principle of this method is the stabilizing effect of the high pressure on the 
radicals generated in the polymer matrix of poly (methyl methacrylate) or poly-
styrene, by thermal decomposition of benzoyl peroxide. The decrease of the polymer 
viscosity due to the increased temperature is compensated by the pressure effect on 
the polymer system, e.g. in poly (methyl methacrylate). At the pressure 10,000 atm 
the free radicals are relatively stable with a lifetime which makes them measurable 
by ESR even at 423 K2105). The study of the mechanism of the free-radical genera-
tion revealed that the polymer radicals can easily be trapped when the polymer matrix 
113 

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
used contains, in addition to benzoyl peroxide, a small amount of a vinyl monomer. 
In such cases, polymerization of the vinyl monomer takes place and the lifetime of 
propagating radicals is prolonged by the effect of high pressure even more than that 
of the initiator radicals. 
4.4.2. Stabilization of Free Radicals on the Surface of Synthetic Zeolites 
The growing polymer chain radicals during thermal polymerization can be stabilized 
by adsorption on synthetic zeolites (synthetic faujasite of the NaX type)1864, 1866, 
1867) 
ESR spectra of radicals obtained for n-butyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid 
by this method are shown in Figure 4.75.

The stabilization of growing macroradicals on zeolite is very useful for studying

the formation of peroxy radicals with a characteristic asymmetric spectrum. At 313 K 
the asymmetric ESR spectrum changes simultaneously into a symmetric singlet. In

4.4.3. Popcorn Polymerization 
Free radical initiation of styrene-divinylbenzene mixtures in a narrow range of com-
positions gives proliferous polymerization to produce what is commonly called "pop-
corn polymers". This occurs in a range of low concentrations of divinylbenzene, for 
which the exact position depends on polymerization conditions such as temperature, 
initiator concentration, and diluent. During proliferous polymerization intensive ESR 
signals are obtained, due to high concentrations of growing polymer radicals285-287, 
560,1492,1576). These free radicals are partly growing chain ends with low termination 
rate and partly formed by chain scission during the swelling of the styrene-divinyl-
benzene copolymer in styrene. The radicals may be trapped in the gel phase for 
many days. ESR signals are also obtained in the polymerization of technical divinyl-
benzene leading at high conversion to glassy polymers, indicating in this case also 
the presence of radicals in high concentrations 711). 
4.4.4. Thermal Polymerization-Miscellaneous Problems 
ESR spectroscopy has also been applied to studies of thermal polymerization of 
methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate301, 302), styrene294) in the presence of benzoyl 
peroxide, radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate in the presence of H2S041 5),

mers689, 903), retardation of free radical polymerization of styrene by nitrosocom-
pounds2094, 2095, 2311, 2312), azobenzenes1264), aromatic hydrazyles279), inhibition

4.5. Polymerization Initiated by Mechano-radicals 
Free radicals formed during mechanical degradation of polymers by cutting, milling, 
grinding, etc. (see Chap. 8.6) are named "mechano-radicals". In the presence of mo-
nomer they can initiate a polymerization reaction. There are two general methods 
of such polymerizationsZOS7): 
1. The "post-contact method" in which monomer is added to a sample with 
mechano-radicals which have been produced previously. 
2. The "simultaneous fracture", method in which monomer (in gas or liquid 
form) is added Simultaneously with the mechanical treatment of the polymer 
at low temperatures. 
ESR spectra of free radicals observed in the post-contact method for grinded 
(milled) poly (tetrafluoroethylene ) and methyl methacrylate are shown in Figure 4.77.

assigned to the same propagation radical (4. 75). No trace of a free poly(tetrafluoro-
ethylene) radical has been observed. 
Similar ESR studies have also been reported for the polymerization of ethylene 
initiated by poly(tetrafluoroethylene) mechano-radicals2057). 
Russian scientists have also reported that free radicals formed by mechanical 
grinding of frozen solutions (SO-ISO K) of different polymers immersed in styrene, 
methyl methacrylate, acrylic acid and other monomers are added to double bonds 
of the monomers577). 
4.6. Polymerization Initiated by Various Free Radical Initiation Systems 
4.6.1. Hydroperoxide-S02 Sys1em 
The reaction of hydro peroxides with sulphur dioxide is a convenient radical source 
for initiation polymerization of vinyl monomers1439). Using ESR with flow system 
the nature of radical intermediates has been investigated in the reaction between 
R02H (R = H, But, PhCMe2) and sulphur dioxide in several solvent media at 
293 K692, 693). 
The details of the ESR spectra (Fig. 4.7S) varied with R and with the solvent.

In every case the main signal (with R = H, only a single line Fig. 4.7S) consists of a 
singlet with g = 2.0033 ± 0.0002 which was assigned to the radical 4.76 formed by 
the reactions:

In addition to the singlet the spectrum recorded during the reaction of t-butyl hydro-
peroxide in methanol contained a multiplet, which was attributed to radical 4. 78 
(Fig.4.7Sb):

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
(4.78) 
A corresponding seven-line multiplet was also observed for the reaction of PhCMe200H 
in methanol, where free radicals (4. 77) are formed according to the reaction: 
(4.77) 
(4.81) 
In water used as solvent the spectra are different. Both organic hydroperoxides 
now produce a quartet centered on g = 2.0055 ± 0.0002 and attributed to radical 
(4.79) (Fig. 4.78c) which can be formed by the reactions: 
Me3CO· ~ 
Me2CO + Me 
Me + S02- MeS02 
Me3CO· + S02 ~ 
Me3COS02 
Me3COS02 ~ 
Me2CO + MeS02 
(4.79) 
(4.82) 
(4.83) 
(4.84) 
(4.85) 
It is not clear at present why the formation of the radicals (4. 79), rather than radicals 
(4.77), is favored in water. No radicals could be detected when the reaction of t-butyl 
hydroperoxide with sulphur dioxide is conducted in ether or acrylonitrile, but the 
addition of a few percent of water or methanol is sufficient to obtain the radicals. 
Ivin et a1.693-695, 1021) have measured ESR spectra of radicals obtained from 
t-butyl hydroperoxide and sulphur dioxide in the presence of different vinyl mono-
mers and other unsaturated compounds. The characteristics of the spectra which 
appear in the presence of various compounds are summarized in Table 4.4 and a few 
typical spectra are shown in Figure 4.79. 
Most of the ESR spectra are attributed to monomer radicals with the structure 
(4.80-4.82): 
RCHixy, 
(4.81) 
RCHXCHY 
(4.82) 
In some cases there is a second weaker set of lines corresponding to a radical with 
slightly different coupling constants. For both styrene and vinyl acetate the appear-
ance of the stronger set of lines correlates with the disappearance of radical (4. 76) 
(by addition to monomer), while the weaker set correlates with the disappearance 
of radical (4.77) (also by addition to monomer) which is the more reactive radical. 
The two sets of lines are thus attributed to radicals (4.83-4.85): 
HOS02M·, 
(4.83) 
ButOM· 
(4.85) 
were M is monomer. 
ESR studies of the sulphite radical ion addition to monomers have also been 
reported1618).

4.6.2. Tetraphenylborate-Organic Acid Systems 
It was found that the binary system of tetraphenylborate salts and organic acids, e.g. 
trichloroacetic acid, may serve as radical initiator of the vinyl polymerization1899). 
ESR studies of the reaction of the initiation system show that triphenylboron is 
produced first in reaction (4.86) and next decomposes into phenyl-radicals (4.86) 
and diborophenyl radicals (4.87) (reaction 4.87):

Figure 4.80 shows the ESR spectrum of radical (4.87) obtained from reactions 
(4.86-4.87) in ethanol solution. 
The radical (4.87) is very stable in ethanol, but unstable in other solvents such as 
acetonitrile, methyl methacrylate, and dimethylformamide in which its ESR signal 
could not be observed. 
4.6.3.Redox Systems 
The most widely used initiation redox system for free radical generation consists of 
Ti3+ -H20 2 acting in aqueous solution at pH < 2125-128, 168,453,481,555,556,662, 
670,697,1051,1460,1616,1744,2004,2072,2133,2134, 2470). This redox system was 
first used by Dixon and Norman555) for generating HO· and HOO· radicals in the 
study of intermediates formed during oxidation of alcohols. Reactions occurring 
in this redox system are: 
(4.88) 
(4.89) 
When aqueous solutions of TiCl3 and H20 2 are mixed in the resonance cavity 
("flow system for ESR studies", see Chapter 3.6.2) of the ESR spectrometer a nar-
row singlet spectrum with line width I G has been observed, which was attributed 
to the HO· radical168, 555). In the presence of an alcohol, this spectrum is replaced 
by a more complex spectrum of alcohol radicals556). 
Several authorsl744, 2004, 2134) have shown that this redox system gives two 
ESR signals which vary in intensity depending mainly on the acidity, ratio ofH20 2 
to TiCl3 (Fig. 4.81), flow rate and temperature. 
The concentration of recorded radicals is a function of the flow rate (Fig. 4.82). 
The plot shows a reciprocal peak heigth of major peaks vs. reciprocal flow rate. At 
293 K the concentration of major peak radicals (assigned to HO·) shows a maximum

Takakura and Ranby2134) have shown that the addition of H2S04 to the reacting 
solution has a very pronounced effect on the relative intensity of the two ESR signals 
(4.83).

(0.007 mole 1-1) and H20 2 (0.15 mole 1-1) in aqueous solution: a. without H2S04 at pH 1.6, 
b. with H2S04 (0.011 mole I-I) at ph 1.4, c. with H2S04 (0.044 mole I-I) at pH 1.1, d. with 
H2S04 (0.264 mole 1-1) at pH 0.5, PI and P2 refer to peak 1 and peak 2, respectively2134) 
The principal peak (P.) is at low magnetic field (g = 2.0128) and the minor peak 
(P2) at high field (g = 2.0114). The assignment of the main peak to HO' radicals is 
questioned in the following arguments: The HO' radicals are highly reactive and are, 
therefore, expected to be too shortlived to reach a steady-state concentration large 
enough for ESR observation. Several authors453, 670, 697, 2004, 2134) have interpreted 
the two peaks (PI and P2) as being due to HOO' and HO' radicals, respectively, both 
coordinated with Ti(IV) ions or a Ti(IV)-H202 complex. This assignment of the 
ESR spectra to the formation of complexes between HO' and HOO' and Ti(IV)-H202 
is further based on the marked intensity enhancement of the colored Ti(IV)-H202 
complex and the observed Ti hyperfine structure. 
According to Fischer's670) suggestion, the main complex radical species can be 
Ti-O-O·3+ formed by the following reactions: 
124 

4.6. Polymerization Initiated by Various Free Radical Initiation Systems 
(4.97) 
(4.98) 
A more detailed discussion of the kinetics of Ti-O-O·3+ fonnation was given by 
Florin697). In strongly acidic solution (pH < 1.4) the formation of complexes of 
HO· and HOO· with other species in the solution should be predominant. 
The reaction in the Ti 3+ -H20 2 redox system has been studied in the presence 
of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) as a chelating agent 734,735,905,2134). 
When a TiCl3 solution, containing an equimolar concentration of EDT A, is mixed 
with H20 2 solution in a flow system, the ESR signals due to the two peaks shown 
in Figure 4.82 disappear, and the reaction mixture is almost discolored. This suggests 
that the titanium chloride chelate with EDTA, in which EDTA is tightly bound to 
the Ti coordination sphere, cannot any longer coordinate with the resulting HO· and 
HOO· radicals. Ti3+-H20 2 system containing EDTA can initiate the fonnation of 
vinyl monomer radicals, e.g. those from vinyl acetate2134). This is an additional proof 
for the existence of HO· and HOO· as free radicals in the system. These radicals are 
also detectable by ESR spectroscopy under experimental conditions. 
Yoshida and Ranby2468) have found that when 1 ,3,5-trioxane was added to the 
Ti3+ -H20 2 reactants, the spectra of the primary HO· radicals disappear and spectra 
related to trioxane appear as shown in Figure 4.84, tentatively assigned to a hydro-
gen-bonded radical.

With a sufficient amount of trioxane added, the HO· spectra are completely con-
verted to the trioxane spectra (Fig. 4.84 b). The ESR spectra related to trioxane 
radicals are doublets with a very small splitting. Their g-value is 2.003 ± 0.002, while 
g = 2.013 ± 0.002 was recorded for the primary HO· radicals. 
Another substantial evidence for the formation of HO· and HOO· complexes 
with TiCl4 has been given by Takakura and Ranby2134) and others125, 127, 128). They

use the well-known redox system Fe2+ -H202 in water solution at pH < 2 which 
does not give an ESR signal, even though HO· and HOO· radicals are known to be 
formed556, 905). Addition of a small amount of TiCl4 to the Fe2+ -H202 system 
gives two intense ESR signals (Fig. 4.85) identical with those observed for the 
TiCI3-H20 2 system (Fig. 4.83).

(0.022 mole 1- 1)2134) 
These results may be interpreted as showing that HO· and HOO· radicals generated 
from the reaction of Fe2+ with H20 2 are associated with Ti(IV) ions, giving the 
radical type complexes assigned to the two ESR peaks. 
Similar results were obtained with another redox system Ce4+ -H202 in aqueous 
solution at pH < 2555,1744,1972). In this redox system only HOO· radicals are formed 
by the following reaction: 
(4.99) 
Addition of small amounts of TiCl4 to this system gives the characteristic one-line 
ESR spectrum assigned to a complex HOO-Ti(IV)-H2 ° 
125, 2134). Addition of 
other metal ions such as Zr02+, Hf4+, Th4+ and UO~+ 128) produces the f'6rmation 
of ESR spectra similar to those obtained by addition of very small amounts of TiCI4. 
It appears that some of the transition metal ions in high and stable oxidation states 
form complexes with free radical species in oxidation-reduction systems generating 
characteristic ESR spectra. 
Another initiation redox system is the Ti3+ -NH20H system, where amino radi-
cals are formed481, 511): 
(4.100) 
Amino radicals (H2N·) are not observed by ESR spectroscopy, probably because they 
react immediately with Ti3+ ions: 
(4.101) 
giving finally a paramagnetic complex.

4.6. Polymerization Initiated by Various Free Radical Initiation Systems 
The redox system Ti3+ -(CH3hCOOH at pH < 2 in aqueous solution produces 
free methyl radicals in a two-step reaction555, 556): 
(4.102) 
(4.103) 
The formation of methyl radicals in these conditions is concluded from the ESR ob-
servation of a quartet spectrum of narrow lines with a separation of about 23 G. 
Radical species of HO· and HOO· are also formed in the Fenton reagent system 
Fe(I1)-EDTA-H202 1970). 
4.6.3.1. Polymerization Initiated by Redox Systems 
Several reviews of this field have been published672, 685,1807-1809,2136). The condi-
tions for the reactions occurring in ESR flow system cell (see Chapter 3.6.2) are quite 
different from those of conventional polymerization during a steady-state process, 
e.g. the free radical concentration is much higher in the flow cell. The hyperfine 
structure of the ESR spectra observed by the flow technique provides, however, 
straight-forward information about the structure, concentration, reactivity, and 
even the steric conformation of the transient radicals involved, particularly for the 
initial stage of the polymerization. 
Mixing of a monomer with the redox system leads to the formation of new 
radicals by addition: 
R·+M-RM· 
(4.104) 
where R· is a primary radical from the redox system, M the monomer, and RM· a 
monomer radical which reacts further: 
RM· +nM-RMn+l· = Pn· 
(4.105) 
where p. is a growing polymer radical. 
To obtain monomer and polymer radicals with concentrations large enough for 
ESR analysis (~ 10-6 M), the initiation rate must be much faster than in conven-
tional polymerizations where radical concentrations are about 10-8 M. With the 
initiating aqueous system Ti3+ -H202' the rate of initiation in flow experiments is 
estimated to be ~ 10-2 mole litec 1 sec-I. 
4.6.3.1.1. Acrylic and Methacrylic Acid Monomers. Application of the flow method 
to investigate radical polymerization of acrylic and methacrylic acid monomers was 
fir.st made by Fischer481, 659-662, 678). 
The redox polymerization is initiated by addition of HO·, ·NH2·, ·CH3 and 
·CH20H radicals to the monomer. The generation of ·CH20H radicals for addition 
to the monomers was achieved with a large excess of methanol in the Ti3+ -H202 
127 

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
system481, 665}. After addition of the initiating radicals to monomers, well-resolved 
ESR spectra assigned to the monomer radicals have been obtained. Only "head radi-
cals" of the structure R-CH2-CX1X2 and no "tail radicals" R-CX1X 2-CH2 were 
detected in the ESR spectra. This result agrees with the general concept that the 
methylene group of CH2=CX1X2 is normally more reactive toward free radical addi-
tion than the substituted carbon. Furthermore, head radicals have more resonance 
stabilization. For some monomers, e.g. acrylic and methacrylic acid, well-defined 
ESR spectra attributed to growing polymer radicals were also observed when the 
monomer concentration was increased above certain levels. For acrylic acid the 
spectrum of polymer radicals was dominant already at a monomer concentration of 
1.5 x 10-1 mole 1-1662}. 
The coupling constant for various acrylic and methacrylic radicals obtained are 
summarized in Table 4.5.

4.6. Polymerization Initiated by Various Free Radical Initiation Systems 
The variation in the l3-coupling constant (aHp) of R-CH2-CX1X2 radicals with dif-
ferent R groups (Table 4.5) has been interpreted as largely being caused by steric 
hinderance to bond rotation of the R group attached to the l3-carbon (Cp) atom664,678). 
This is in agreement with the theory of Hp-coupling related to the conformation as 
described by Eq. (4.106}904, 2123): 
aHp = BHj3p cos2e 
(4.106) 
where BH is a constant, p is the spin density on the a-carbon (Co,) and e is the angle 
between tte axis of the 2 pz orbital of the unpaired electron and the direction of the 
Cj3-H bond, both projected on a plane perpendicular to the Ca-Cp bond direction 
(Fig. 4.86). 
Fig. 4.86. Sterle conformation of 
free radicals of the type: 
with the Ca-Cp-axis perpendicular 
to the paper plane2136) 
Ifthe two l3-protons are equivalent, the aHp-values are given by Eq. (4.107}662): 
(4.107) 
where 4> is the angle of free rotation between the projection of the Ca-R bond and 
the axis of the 2 pz orbital, representing the average position of the substituent R as 
shown in Figure 4.86, BHj3 is 58.6 G652), and cos2e is a mean value for all angles 
attained. 
With increasing size of the substituent R, in the order HO·, 'CH3, ·NH2 and 
'CH20H radicals, the aHp values tend in most cases to decrease. This indicates that 
the angle of free rotation 4> decreases. The smaller aHp values for polymer radicals, 
e.g. acrylic acid, compared with monomer radicals can be explained in a similar way 
as an effect of much larger size of the group,(Le. the chain} attached to the l3-carbon 
(Cp) atom. From the observed spectra, however, it is difficult to distinguish between 
dimer, trimer, and larger radicals, because the expected variation in the aHp values 
with the degree of polymerization is not significant. 
Methacrylic acid has an ESR spectrum with well-resolved hyperfine structure 
consisting of 16 lines (Fig. 4.87a) when observed during redox polymerization in a 
flow system66 1 , 662). 
129 

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
Fig. 4.87. ESR spectra of polymerization radicals 
of methacrylic acid: a. measured at 320 K in 
aqueous solution, b. at 234 K with solid metha-
crylic acid irradiated at 77 K with 1 MeVelec-
trons661) 
This spectrum is assigned to the growing polymer radicals. According to this inter-
pretation, the two /3-protons are not equivalent, since they show two different cou~ 
pIing constant (Table 4.5). In this conformation, the angles 9 1 and 9 2 for /31- and 
/32"Protons are 63.10 and 5604, respectively, indicating that the R group of long 
chains in radical (4.88) is "locked" in relation to the a-carbon, i.e. has a hindered 
rotation giving two different 9 averages. 
(4.88) 
Moreover, this interpretation leads to the conclusion, that the so-called "5 + 4-line" 
spectrum which has been reported for irradiated (1 MeV) methacrylic monomers in 
glass state (Fig. 4.87) is indeed caused by polymer radicals (4.88). 
On the basis of the steric structure and internal rotation of propagating radicals 
derived from ESR spectra, Fischer664, 685) discussed the relative occurrence of isci-
tactic and syndiotactic units in the polymer. 
A kinetic study of redox polymerization of acrylic acid initiated by methyl 
radicals (·CH3 ) in aqueous solutions in the flow system has been made by Fischer668). 
The rate constants obtained under flow system conditions with a rate of initiation 
Rj = 1.83 X 10-2 mole I-I sec-I were for propagation kp = 0.64 x 105 1 sec mole- 1 
and for termirtation kt = 1.52 x 108 1 sec mole-I, both of which are about one order 
of magnitude higher than for conventional steady-state solution polymerization. This 
was interpreted as a reason for the much shorter chain length of the propagation radi-
cals in the ESR flow experiments. 
4.6.3.1.2. Acrylamides. A flow system was applied to obtain high resolution ESR 
spectra of free radicals produced by the addition of hydroxyl radicals to acrylamide 
and methacrylamide in aqueous solution340). A comparison of the hyperfine coupling 
constants of the /3'Protons with those observed for other acrylic monomers leads to 
130 

4.6. Polymerization Initiated by Various Free Radical Initiation Systems 
the conclusion that the radicals (4.89) and (4.90) observed contain only one mono-
mer unit:

The two protons in the amide group were found to be magnetically inequivalent 
what can be explained in two different ways: 
1. A difference in NH bond length would be due to a a-IT exchange interaction 
to induce different spin densities at the amide protons, and 
2. The two protons may be slightly out of the molecular NCO plane and to a 
different extent. 
It is important to point out that free radicals from acrylamide and methacrylamide 
derived in various ways and trapped in a variety of solid matrices give poorly resolved 
ESR spectra27, 193,425,1929), as compared to the flow method340). 
4.6.3.1.3. Acrylonitrile. Using the TiClr H20 2 or TiCI3-H20 2-CH30H radical 
generating method in flow system a few authors have reported ESR studies of acrylo-
nitrile662, 2039, 2136). Only the ESR spectrum from the radicals (4.91) was observed 
at low concentration of acrylonitrile.

polymerization of vinyl esters was first made by Ranby and coworkers2070, 2133, 2137).

TiCl3 -H202 are shown in Figure 4.88.

The spectrum shown in Figure 4.88a, was obtained at an ordinary monomer concen-
tration of 5 x 10-2 mole 1- 1 and can be described as a doublet of triplets of narrow 
quartets (g = 2.0031). It is assigned to the monomer radical (4.93). The spectrum in 
Figure 4.88 b shows half of the spectrum obtained at saturated vinyl acetate concen-
tration, i.e. about 0.3 mole 1- 1. The weak signals superimposed on the spectrum of 
vinyl acetate monomer radicals (4.93) are considered to be due to growing polymer 
radicals. The weak signals denoted as P1 and P2 in Figure 4.88a are interpreted as 
being due to a residue of the initiating system (HOO' and HO· complex forms as 
described in Chap. 4.6.3). 
The ESR spectra for the following vinyl esters monomers in the following initating 
systems are shown: 
TiC13 -H202 for isopropenyl acetate (Fig. 4.89) and vinyl butyrate (Fig. 4.90). 
TiC13-NH20H for isopropenyl acetate (Fig. 4.91) and vinyl propionate 
(Fig. 4.92), at monomer concentrations below 0.1 mole 1- 1 . 
Isopropenyl acetate gave the spectrum (Fig. 4.89) of a quartet of triplets. Each line 
is further split into a narrow quartet (barely visible) assigned to the expected very 
weak coupling with the three protons in the acetate group. Vinyl propionate 
(Fig. 4.92), vinyl butyrate (Fig. 4.90), and isopropenyl acetate (Fig. 4.91) gave almost 
the same spectra as vinyl acetate (Fig. 4.88), except for the narrow triplets arising 
from the two protons next to the carbonyl in the ester group. The ESR spectrum 
from vinyl crotonate was rather weak and the splitting from the ester protons could 
not be resolved.

The assignments of the observed spectra to vinyl ester monomer radicals are veri-
fied by using 'NH2 radicals as initiator. The ESR spectra from these vinyl ester radi-
cals (Fig. 4.91 and 4.92) show the triplet coupling with the nitrogen atom of the 
NH2 group attached to the l3-carbon. The coupling with the l3-protons is almost the 
same as that observed for the corresponding HO-adduct radicals.

When methyl radicals are used as initiator for vinyl acetate, no detectable amounts 
of radicals (8.93) are obtained under any experimental conditions. Methyl radicals 
(-CH3 ) are less reactive than HO' and ·NH2. The reactivity of vinyl acetate is appar-
ently very low compared with that of acrylic monomers662). The coupling constants 
obtained for HO' and 'NH2 adduct radicals of various vinyl esters are listed in Table 4.7. 
As seen from Table 4.7 all vinyl ester monomer radicals show almost the same J3-cou-
pIing constant independent of the ester group. 
There is no significant variation in the aH/3 values for vinyl acetate monomer 
radicals with temperature, Le. 12 G (281 K), 12.2 G (293 K), and 12.8 G (323 K). 
These results indicate that the vinyl ester monomer radicals have the J3-CH2 group 
linked in respect to the a-carbon group in such a way that the two hydrogens remain

And for radical where the methyl group is directly attached to a tervalent carbon204l): 
(4.97) 
This means that the angle e is nearly 60° for both methylene hydrogens (see Fig. 4.86) 
and that the R group (R = HO, NH2 ) in the radicals (4.93-4.96) is above or below 
the radical plane. This phenomenon cannot be understood as being caused by the 
enhanced size of substituent R, attached to the J3-carbon. It seems more likely that 
some type of intramolecular interaction leading to a locked conformation operates 
in this case. Two explanations may be suggested2137): 
1. The formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the hydrogen of 
the J3-hydroxyl group or J3-amino group and the carbonyl oxygen of the ester group 
giving a seven-membered ring structure. This conformation seems to be feasible for 
a molecular model, although the ring structure is not planar. 
2. A titanium chelate of two vinyl ester monomer radicals in which titanium 
ions may be coordinated between the two polar side groups. 
The formation of HO· adduct radicals of vinyl acetate is mainly related to the 
concentration of initiator, monomer, and sulphuric acid. The intensity of the signal 
is strongly affected by the molar ratio of H20 2 to TiCI3 . The maximum intensity 
was obtained with a ratio close to r = 152137). When the ratio decreases below r < 10, 
either by increasing the TiCl3 concentration or by decreasing the H20 2 concentra-
tion, the intensity of the ESR signal was considerably reduced. According to simple 
kinetics, however, the highest intensity is expected at a molar ratio of unity. When 
the H20 2 /TiCI3 ratio was kept constant at the optimal value r = 16 with increasing 
concentration of the initiator, the intensity at first mcreased, passed through a maxi-
mum, and then decreased. After adding a small amount of ferric chloride, which is 
known to be a radical scavenger in the reaction system, the signal intensity decreased 
markedly down to the ESR noise level. These results suggest that species like Ti(IV) 
ions, derived from the redox reaction, may take part in radical termination, e.g. 
through a process of electron transfer. 
As seen from the spectrum in Figure 4.88 b weak signals caused by vinyl acetate 
polymer radicals were observed at saturated monomer concentration. The coupling

(p.): TiCI3 (0.06 mole 1-1), H202 (0.10 
mole I-I) and H2S04 (0.02 mole I-I )2136) 
constants obtainoo from this spectrum are aHa = 20.3 G and aH,6 = 17.5 G and 
aHOCOCH = 1.3 G. The formation of vinyl acetate and polymer radicals at increasing 
monomer is shown in Figure 4.93. 
In most cases no polymer-like substance could be detected in the reaction mixture 
immediately after mixing both solutions. The very low concentration of vinyl acetate 
polymer radicals is in marked contrast to the results for acrylic monomers662), for 
which intense, well-resolved spectra arising from polymer radicals (Fig. 4.87a) are 
easily obtained even at monomer concentration below 5 x 1,0-2 mole 1-1. For com-
parison, data obtained for acrylic acid are given in Figure 4.94 .. 
These results suggest that rather than undergo propagation, the highly reactive vinyl 
acetate radicals could, in the flow system terminate preferentially with species such 
as BO' radicals, vinyl acetate monomer radicals, or titanium ions. This is probably 
an effect of the low reactivity of vinyl acetate monomer. 
As reported by Takakura and Rllnby2133) the introduction of small amounts of 
more reactive second monomers, such as acrylonitrile, into the vinyl acetate system 
gives a well-resolved spectrum containing two new components, one assigned to new 
monomer radicals (e.g. acrylonitrile radicals) and one attributed to initial copolymer 
radicals resulting from addition of the second monomer to the vinyl acetate radicals 
(see next Chapter). 
4.6.3.1.5. Copolymerization of Vinyl Acetate and Acrylonitrile with Various Co-
monomers. Copolymerization of vinyl acetate (monomer MI ) with acrylonitrile, 
acrylic acid, acrylamide, maleic acid, and fumaric acid (monomer M2 ) has been in-
vestigated in detail by Takakura and Rllnby2133, 2135). The ESR spectra obtained 
from the binary monomer systems containing the vinyl ester and small amounts of 
monomer M2 show a predominant new signal assigned to the radical species (4.98) 
(Fig. 4.95) and (Fig. 4.96).

The initial copolymer radicals are characterized by their low aHa values. No evidence 
of the reverse type of copolymer radicals, i.e. HO-Mr(vinyl acetate)' was observed. 
This is a clear demonstration that vinyl acetate monomer has low reactivity, while 
vinyl acetate monomer radicals are highly reactive. 
The coupling constants for the initial copolymer radicals are given in Table 4.8,

The small aH values for copolymer radicals indicate that the rotation of the RCH2 
group aroun~ the C-C bond is restricted to a greater extent than in the correspond-
ing monomer radicals. This is probably due to steric hindrance of the large vinyl 
acetate units R, attached to the {3-carbon atom. In comparison the HO groups on the 
corresponding monomer radicals are small. 
The relative concentration of the various radical species during copolymerization 
was estimated from the intensities of the ESR spectral components. Typical results 
obtained from vinyl acetate-maleic acid and vinyl acetate- fumaric acid systems are 
shown in Figure 4.97, giving the relative radical concentration as a function of co-
monomer concentration. 
The addition of small amounts of co mono mer M2 (molar ratio M2/M 1 ";;0.05) causes 
in each case a sharp decrease in the concentration of vinyl acetate monomer radicals, 
while the concentration of the corresponding copolymer radical (4.98) increases. 
This indicates a rapid reaction of vinyl acetate monomer radicals with comonomer 
(M2 ), resulting in an almost instantaneous transformation to radicals (4.98). As 
expected, maleic acid and fumaric acid give the same ESR spectrum. Fumaric acid 
(trans isomer) reacts much faster than maleic acid (cis isomer) with vinyl acetate 
monomer radicals. Plots of the free radical concentration vs. concentration of co-
monomer (M2) are shown in Figure 4.98. 
The data give straight lines with a characteristic slope, which is a measure of the 
relative rate of conversion of HO-M 1· to HO-M 1 -M2 · for different M2 comonomers,

Izumi and Ranby l040, 1809) reported that copolymerization studies of acrylo-
nitrile (M I) with various comonomers (M2) gave interesting results for comparison. 
The reactivity of the acrylonitrile monomer is high and that of the acrylonitrile radi-
cal (MI') is low. Therefore copolymer radicals HO-M2-MI ' are formed and their 
relative concentration can be used to measure the reactivity of different monomer 
radicals (M2 '). 
4.6.3.1.6. Allyl Monomers. ESR measurements using the flow technique are particu-
larly useful for polymerization studies of allyl and methallyl monomers481, 564, 1039,

As the concentration of allyl alcohol was raised, an additional, less intense, spectrum 
became increasingly apparent and was attributed to allyl alcohol polymeric radicals. 
Several authors481, 1039, 1041,2040) have presented extensive studies of the effects 
of three types offree radicals HO', 'NH2, and 'CH3 from redox systems on the poly-
merization of different allyl and methallyl monomers as alcohols, carboxylic esters, 
ethers, sulphonated and nitrogen-containing monomers. The main result of these 
studies is the observation that all allyl compounds (except methallyl alcohol) add 
HO' radicals both at the tail and the head end of the monomer, the tail-addition 
(giving head radicals) always being the most frequent. With methallyl alcohol, how-
ever, only head radicals were observed. These authors have presented valuable data 
on the coupling constants and g-values for the observed free radicals. The coupling 
constants of (3-CH2 protons vary considerably with the substituents. The aH!31 cou-
pling constants (CH2 to which the initiator is added) decrease in the order 
HO> CH3 > NH2 and the aH!32 coupling constants (allyl hydrogen, CH2 with sub-
stituent) decrease in the order CH20H > CH2NH2 > CH20COCH3 > CH2S03Na, 
i.e. decrease with increased size of the substituent groupsl041). 
Izumi and Rllnbyl041, 1042) have made a detailed ESR study of the mechanism 
of radical polymerization of methallyl monomers with redox systems. In the case of 
'NH2 and HO' addition to methallyl alcohol, methallyl amine, and sodium methallyl 
sulphonate, the ESR spectra of the reacting species are interpreted as being due to 
monomer head radicals only (-NH2 and HO' are added to the monomer tail). Meth-
allyl acetate with HO' is an exception, giving hydrogen abstraction to form an allyl 
type radical. This reaction may influence the polymerization behavior of methallyl 
alcohol. This monomer behaves differently from the other allyl monomers, in which 
appreciable amounts of monomer tail radicals were found, in addition to the head 
radicals which are the main species. For methallyl monomers, this may be due to 
steric hindrance caused by the two substituents on the a-carbon. Methyl radicals 
add only to positively polarized reactive double bonds. The coupling constant of 
(3-CH2 protons vary considerably with the substituents. For H!31 ' the coupling con-
stant (aH!31) decreases in the order HO > CH3 > NH2. For H!32 (allyl hydrogen) the 
143 

4. ESR Study of Polymerization Processes 
coupling constants (aH,6 ) decrease in the order CH20H > CH2NH2 > CH20COCH3 > 
> CH2S03Na, i.e. the c5nstants decrease in the order of increased size of the groups. 
Using the ESR technique Izumi and Rllnby l040) have also investigated the co-
polymerization of several allyl and methallyl monomers (M I) with acrylonitrile. All 
results show the very low reactivity of the monomers M 1 and their radicals towards 
copolymerization with acrylonitrile. The predominant copolymer radical formed is 
MI (acrylnitrile)', which is characterized by lower aHo-values than the acrylonitrile 
monomer radical. This is interpreted as being due to restricted rotation caused by 
steric hindrance from the M 1 units attached to the (j-carbon of the acrylonitrile 
radicals. 
Interesting results have been obtained in the ESR study of trimethylolpropane 
mono allyl ether564). The observed ESR spectra (Fig. 4.99) were assigned to the

ESR spectra from copolymerizing system of vinyl acetate (Fig. 4.100) and methyl 
acrylate with trimethylol-propane monoallyl ether were also studied. 
The ESR spectrum shown in Figure 4.100 shows the presence of three radicals 
(4.104), (4.105), and/or (4.106) (4.107). In the system methyl acrylate/trimethylol-
propane mono allyl ether, the ESR spectrum was mainly due to the radicals (4.104-
4.107) in which the allylic radicals were predominant. This result is consistent with 
the observation that polymerization of methyl acrylate is strongly retarded by the

to the high reactivity of methyl acrylate radicals towards the trimethylol-propane 
monoallyl ether monomer. 
4.6.3.1.7. Miscellaneous Monomers. ESR measurements using the flow technique 
have also been applied to polymerization studies of ethylene, vinyl chloride, and 
vinyl fluoride550, 821). The spectra obtained are assigned to monomer radicals formed 
by hydroxyl radical addition to the methylene group of the monomers. However, no 
spectrum attributed to propagating radicals has been observed, probably because of 
the very limited solubility, with a resulting low concentration of these monomers 
in aqueous media. The coupling constants for some of the monomer radicals are 
summarized in Table 4.9. 
The small aHf3 values recorded for HO-adduct radicals of vinyl fluoride and vinyl 
chloride may be interpreted as being due to steric effects. 
Yoshida and Ranby2470) studied polymerization of butadiene using HO· radicals 
as initiator. The observed spectrum is assigned to the radical (4.108) or (4.109) 
formed by hydroxyl addition to the monomer: 
HO-CH2-CH-CH=CH2~ HO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2 (4.109) 
(4.108) 
(4.110) 
The main product of the reaction of hydroxyl radicals generated from the system of 
ferrous ions and H20 2 with butadiene is known to be 1,8-dihydroxy-2,6-octadiene821). 
This product is formed by dimerization of radical (4.109). Griffiths et al.821) also 
studied butadiene initiated with HO· and obtained almost the same ESR spectrum. 
They recorded, moreover, the spectrum obtained by addition of ·NH2 to butadiene. 
This spectrum was, however, highly complex, presumably because isomeric radicals 
were formed, and an unequivocal assignment was not possible. 
ESR measurements using flow technique have proved to be very useful for studies 
of initiation reactions of 1 ,2-substituted unsaturated monomers such as: maleic and 
fumaric acid557, 662, 678), crotonyl alcohol, crotonic acid, crotonitrile and croton-
aldehyde557, 662,821,1043,2039), and copolymerization of these monomers with 
acrylonitrile 392). 
Smith et al.2036) investigated the addition of hydroxyl radicals to several oximes: 
acetaldoxime, acetoxime, and 2,3-butadienone monoxime in flow system. The basic 
reaction in two steps may be represented as follows:

4.7. Anionic Polymerization 
In conclusion the flow technique combined with ESR spectroscopy is an ex-
tremely powerful method, because it allows direct observations and measurements 
of the radical formation in the initiation stage of redox reactions in polymerization. 
The method also allows the characterization of several free radicals simultaneously 
present, which is important, e.g. in copolymerization studies.

The primary radical-ion (M:-) is neither a conventional radical nOr a carbanion and 
its structure may be represented by two resonating forms (4.112), which implies 
that one end of M:- acts as a radical while the other acts as a carbanion (or vice versa) 
(4.117). By addition of one monomer molecule to M:- a dimer is formed, possessing 
one "true" radical end and one "true" carbanion end: 
147

(4.118) 
(4.112) 
(4.113) 
There is no interaction between these two centers. Such a dimer can result in further 
polymerization of a dual character. The radical end might grow according to a radi-
cal mechanism, while the carbanion end as an anionic polymerization. Monomeric 
radical ions (M-=-) may also dimerize and form dicarbanions (4.114): 
(4.119) 
which may continue to grow by the anionic mechanism only. 
A large number of radical anions have been prepared by reducing the parent 
hydrocarbon with alkali metals 749,1052,1350,1687,1827,2119). ESR studies of radi-
cal ions e.g. of benzene and toluene formed in reactions with Na or K metal mirrors 
in the presence of crown ethers, have been reported 1180). Panayotov et al. 1695) found 
experimental evidence for the formation of the anion radical of benzene as a product 
of the interaction between benzene and potassium in the presence of poly( ethylene 
oxide). The ESR spectrum of a fresh "red" colored solution is shown in Figure 4.101.

Fig. 4.101)1695) 
Under UV-light the red solution changes to brown-green giving a new ESR spectrum 
(Fig. 4.102).

stable biphenyl anion radical (4.116):

ESR spectroscopy of radical ions is given in several monographs2o, 109,259,1072) and 
will not be discussed in detail here. Only a few examples directly attributed to ionic 
polymerization will be given. 
4.7.2. ESR study of Ion Pairs, Free Ions and Electron·transfer Reactions 
The structure of ion pairs and free ions in solution and the mechanism of electron-
transfer reactions between a radical ion and the corresponding molecule, pose some 
of the most interesting problems concerning the relationship between reactivities 
and structures of radical ions in solutions. 
Weissman et al. 17, 93) have shown that the original hyperfme lines of radical an-
ions split into multiples on their association with cations possessing nuclear spin. The 
magnitude of the new hyperfine splitting constants may yield valuable information 
about the location of the cation within the pair, and the width and shape of the lines 
may reveal details of the dynamic processes involving these species2136). 
Weissman and his coworkers1064, 2385, 2482) have been among the fIrst to estab-
lish methods for measuring the rapid rates of electron-transfer reactions by ESR. 
As an example they have shown that the rate of electron exchange between the 
naphthalenide radical ions and naphthalene depends on the state of ionic association 
of the radical ions. The rate of electron transfer can be determined from the broaden-
ing of ESR lines at slow and at fast exchange rate limits. Figures 4.103 and 4.104

. 
The surrounding of an ion pair by solvent molecules is dependent on the nature of 
both the pair and the solvent and also on the temperature. The hyperfine splitting 
constant (aM), calculated from the ESR spectra of paramagnetic ion pairs, usually 
increases at higher temperatures. The structure of an ion pair may be nearly fixed at 
a certain temperature ("static model"). This means that the position of a cation with 
respect to the anion in the pair and the locations of the surrounding solvent molecules 
do not deviate substantially from their average configuration. The fluctuations are 
rapid with a frequency greater than 1010 sec- 1 952, 2120). 
In some systems ion pairs may have two or more distinct structures, i.e. two or 
more distinct patterns produced by the pair and the neighboring solvent molecules 
may coexist, each pattern lasting for a relatively long time (_10- 10 s) ("dynamic 
model"). The observed properties of the system again depend on temperature, as 
well as on the lifetime of each type of ion pair. For example, two sets of lines may 
be seen in the ESR spectrum of paramagnetic ion pairs, if they form two distinct 
and slowly interconverted types. The usual broadening, coalescence, and subsequent 
sharpening of the lines should be observed as the temperatures rises and the rate of 
interconversion increases. The distinction between the two models (static and dy-
namic) of ion pairs is not easy when only one splitting constant (aM) is deduced 
from the ESR spectrum. 
Hirota et al.947, 948) have investigated ESR spectra of alkali salts of naphthalenide 
and anthracenide ions and reported that the dynamic model of ion pairs shows a 
characteristic dependence of aM on temperature. Thus, for equilibrium of: ion 
pair (I) ~ ion pair (II), the related equilibrium constants can be calculated from the 
experimental data if aMI and aMu' pertaining to the individual ion pairs, are tem-
perature-independent. The dynamic model predicts also dependence of the width 
of the ESR lines on Mz (atomic number) of the cation 948). 
The character of ion pairs may be modified either by varying the solvent or the 
temperature of the solution. Szwarc et al.952) have shown that it is also possible to 
modify the character of an ion at constant temperature in a virtually unchanged 
150

which strongly interact with the ion pairs. 
The ESR spectrum of sodium naphthalenide (N7" Na +) in tetrahydropyran is 
shown in Figure 4.105. 
The hyperfine lines of naphthalenide are split into quadruplets by the presence of 
23Na. The magnitude of the respective splitting varies from about 1.4 G at 320 K to 
1.0 G at 236 K (Table 4.10).

On the addition of tetraglyme (-0.24 M) the aNa is greatly reduced. The ESR spec-
trum at room temperature is shown in Figure 4.106. 
The relevant splitting constant (aN a) is about 0.4 G. Lowering the temperature of 
the solution reduces aNa still further, and at 236 K the four lines merge into one 
(Table 4.10). Thevariation of line width permits calculation of the rate constant of 
interconversion.

At room temperature and for intermediate concentrations of glyme, two sets of 
lines were recognized in the spectrum; those characteristic of qIe "tight" pairs present 
in the pure tetrahydropyran, and those identified as the lines of the glymated pairs 
which were observed in the presence of an excess of glyme (Fig. 4.107).

Szwarc et al.21) have applied the ESR method with great sucess to the study of 
electron-transfer exchange between durosemiquinone triplet-ions (DQ:- 2Na+) and 
the parent quinone in tetrahydrofurane. Earlier ESR studies of semiquinone radical 
ions 799, 800) provided direct evidence for the existence of symmetric triple-ions 
(Na+DQ:-Na+) where two sodium cations interact with the unpaired electron. The 
ESR spectrum of duro semiquinone triple-ion is shown in Figure 4.108. 
Both sodium ions are transferred in the process of exchange between durosemi-
quinone triple-ions (DQ·- 2Na +) and the parent quinone. The ESR spectrum, in the

complexes (DQ'- Na +DQ) and (DQ'- 2 Na +DQ) are formed under these conditions. 
Fast electron-transfer spectra have been observed in solution saturated with duro-
quinone (2 M) as shown in Figure 4.109. 
It is probable that the exchange rates for the ion pairs and triple-ions are about the 
same (-5 x 109 M- 1 S:-l). 
The rate of an anionic polymerization in liquid phase depends on intermolecular 
collisions between radical-ion and monomer molecules. A radical ion continually 
changes its shape, its conformation, because thermal motion induces rotation around 
its various C-C bonds. These processes depend on the temperature, the viscosity of 
the solvent, the structure of the radical ion, and the end-groups. If the radical ion has 
a sufficiently long chain, intramolecular collisions between its end-groups may occur. 
Such intramolecular collisions have been investigated for the first time, by applying 
ESR spectroscopy, by Szwarc and coworkers470, 1978,2121,2122). A series of hydro-
carbons radical ions, having the structure (a-naphtyl'-HCH2)r(a-naphtyl) withj 
varying from 3 to 12, have been synthesized. The resulting ESR spectra are shown 
in Figure 4.110-4.115.

Figure 4.110 shows the spectra of (a-naphtyl·-)-(CH2)12-(a-naphtyl) recorded at 
temperatures varying from 258 K to 321 K. The shape of the recorded spectra reveals 
the effect of the intramolecular transfer only. At low rates of exchange the spectra 
of (a-naphtyl·-)-(CH2)r(a-naphtyl) are almost identical with the ESR spectra of 
a-n-butylnaphthalenide·- dissolved in hexamethylphosphortriamide of an appropriate 
concentration (0.015 mole 1-1 solution), where intermolecular transfer only occurs 
(4.111). Hence, for j = 12 and at T = 258 K, the rates of the intramolecular collisions 
of (a-naphthyl·-)-(CH2)12-(a-naphthyl) are the same as the rates of the bimolecular 
collisions at about 0.015 mole 1-1 concentration of a-n-butylnaphthalene. At higher

trum of the intermolecular system at the same temperature (Fig. 4.111). For j = 4 
(Fig. 4.112) the rate of the intramolecular collisions at 258 K seems to be comparable 
to that observed for j = 12 at 318 K (Fig. 4.110). As the temperature of the j = 4 
solution rises, the increase in the rate leads to sharpening of the lines. At 318 K, the 
spectrum of a hypothetical "dimer" appears clearly. 
For j = 3 the rate of collisions is very fast and all the recorded spectra (Fig. 4.113) 
are interpreted as those of a hypothetical "dimer" at all temperatures. The spectra

4.7.3. Initiation of Polymerization by Electron Transfer 
The ESR spectrum of the radical anion of 1,3-butadiene has been observed by con-
tinous electrolysis in liquid ammonial358, 1359). Russian scientists have reported a 
special technique in which simultaneous condensation of alkali metal vapors and 
monomers, like acrylic and methacrylic compounds1066, 1694) and dienes 754), give 
adducts which have characteristic ESR spectra (Fig. 4.116) 
These spectra have been attributed to radical anions. In the case of butadiene the 
ESR spectrum consists of five lines with the intensities 1 : 4: 6: 4: 1 and AH = 
7.617 G754). A much better-resolved hyperfme structure is found in the ESR spectra

Several ESR studies have been reported of different radical anions which can be 
applied in vinyl polymerization, e.g. radical ions from reactions of alkali metals 
(Li, Na and K) in tetrahydrofuran with hexamethyl phosphoric triamideI702), alkali 
metals with triphenylamine, triphenylphosphine and triphenylphosphine oxide483, 
1697,2438), potassium in 1,2-dimethoxy-ethylene380, 2319), potassium in tetrahydro-
furan in the presence of polyethylene oxideI700), and rubidium in bis-2-(2-methoxy-
ethoxy)ethyl ether380). 
ESR spectroscopy has also been applied to studies of mono- and disodium 
adducts of several compounds with C=C, C=O, C=N, N=N, N=NO and N=O double 
bonds which form radical anions and dianions, which may initiate anionic poly-
merization of acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate, styrene, and vinyl acetate in tetra-
hydrofuran274, 1693). 
ESR study of ion-radical complexes between carbon black ,with alkali metals 
(Li, Na, K) in tetrahydrofuran have also been reported1502). Free radicals with long 
lifetime present in heated carbon black react with sodium in tetrahydrofurane giving 
an ion-radical complex. This reaction can be registered by changes in shape and line 
width of the ESR spectra (Fig. 4.119). 
A carbon black-alkali metal complex was allowed to initiate the polymerization of 
styrene in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature in a nitrogen atmosphere. The grafted 
polymer was 35% of the product. The authors1502) suggest that "living" polystyrene

4.7.4.1. Polycyclic Aromatic Complexes 
Application of ESR spectroscopy to studies of "living" anionic polymerization of 
styrene initiated by naphthalene radical ion has been reported by Levy and SzwarcI360). 
In polynuclear systems a more extensive delocalization of the unpaired electron 
results in a greater stability of aromatic anions. ESR studies of anionic polymeriza-
tion of styrene by radical anions of acenapthylene922. 1513) and 9,1O-dirnethyl-
anthracene63) and of polymerization of I-vinylpyrene adducts with alkali metals 
(K, Na, Li)1661) have also been reported. Russian scientist published ESR studies of 
the anionic polymerization of bis(triethyleneglycol)phthalate dirnethylacrylatel377) 
and of acrolein and its derivativesI203), irlitiated by Na-naphthalene. 
4.7.4.2. Ketyl Complexes 
Special attention has been given to aromatic ketyls which are formed in the reduction 
of aromatic ketones by alkali metalsl693. 2308). The great reactivity of these highly 
colored solutions has been attributed to the presence of paramagnetic mono-anions, 
diamagnetic di-anions and various free radicals. 
Mono-alkali (U, Na, K) metal complexes of thiobenzophenone (thioketyls) have 
been studied in detail by ESR spectroscopyl047. 1504). A typical ESR spectrum of 
monosodium thiobenzophenone in THF is shown irl Figure 4.120.

This ESR spectrum consisting of about 70 lines, is very complex and its total spectral 
width is about 25 G1S04). The reactions of thiobenzophenone with equimolar amounts 
of alkali metals (U, Na and K) give deep red complexes which were shown to be 
thioketyls (4.117). It is difficult to attribute the ESR spectrum in Figure 4.120 to 
the radical anion. The reaction of thiobenzophenone, with more than twice the equi-
molar amount of alkali metals (Me), showed the formation of dark red dialkali metal 
adducts (4.118):

These dimetallic adducts (4.118) have a greater reactivity than the thioketyls (4.117)

tion1423, 1696), have also been published. 
4.7.4.4. Pyridyl Complexes 
The sodium adduct of pyridine N-oxide in tetrahydrofurane yields a violet-colored

The structure of the anion radical could not be elucidated from the ESR signal, as it 
is only a singlet-line spectrum. The anionic polymerization mechanism of vinyl mo-
nomers (styrene, methyl methacrylate, and acrylonitrile) with the sodium adduct of 
pyridine N-oxide can be explained as a charge-transfer reaction to the monomer from 
pyridyl, 2,2' -bipyridyl and 4,4' -bipyridyl anion radicals. The formation of "living" 
a-methylstyrene tetramer has also been observed243S).

These carbon disulphide-alkali metal adducts induce polymerization of N-phenyl-

Diphenyl sulphoxide reacts with an equimolar amount of potassium in tetra-
hydrofurane at 195 K to form a reddish-black solution, giving an ESR signal only 
below 200 K933). This singlet-line spectrum (Similar to that shown in Fig. 4.122 for 
the diphenylsulfone anion radical) has been attributed to a very labile diphenyl-
sulphoxide anion radical (4.124), which initiates the anionic polymerization of 
acrylonitrile, but not polymerization of methyl methacrylate, styrene, and isoprene.

Diphenylsulfone was found to react with an equimolar amount of potassium in 
tetrahydrofurane and other solvents (e.g. diglyme), yielding J,"eddish-black solution 
and giving an ESR single-line spectrum (Fig. 4.122)934). 
This signal is attributed to the formation of a relatively labile diphenylsulfone anion 
radical (4.125), which can initiate polymerization of acrylonitrile but not polymerize 
methyl methacrylate, styrene, or isoprene.

4.8. Cationic Polymerization 
The transfer of an electron from a nucleophile monomer (an electron donor (D)) to 
an electron acceptor (A), converts the monomer to a cation radical. In this initiation 
step of cationic polymerization the formation of a charge-transfer complex (CT) is 
an important intermediate step: 
D + A~(D-A) ~D·+ A--~ D;+-(solv) + A--(solv) 
(CT) 
(4.129) 
The electron-donating character of the monomer results from the presence of nucleo-
philic substituents or heteroatoms containing unshared electron pairs, e.g. nitrogen 
or oxygen. The electron acceptors (A) which participate in charge-transfer interactions 
include organic molecules containing electrophilic substituents and inorganic mole-
cules, including halogens, e.g. 12 and metal salts in their higher valence states, carbo-
nium ions, radicals, and cation radicals. Solvation of the charged species can acceler-
ate the electron transfer and ionization becomes easier in polar solvents. 
For example, it was suggested that the tetracyanoethylene (A)-initiated polymeri-
zation of N-vinylcarbazole (D) in methylene chloride results from the radical cation 
of N-vinylcarbazole (4.126), whereas in benzene, the intermediate radical anion and 
radical cation coupled to a "zwitterion" (4.127) are assumed to polymerize mono-
mers172.2166):

Neither the tetracyanoethylene radical anion nor the alkyl vinyl ether radical 
cation was observed with flow ESR experiments in methylene chloride or aceto-
nitrile2166). This seems reasonable for a reaction in which the intermediate radicals 
rapidly couple before they are solvent-separated. Similar results have been obtained 
during polymerization of isopropyl vinyl ether (D) initiated by tetracyanoquinono-
dime thane (A)2166). No free radicals were observed by ESR in this system. The above 
presented results, however, do not eliminate the transient existence of tetracyano-
quinonodimethyl radical anion. If the rate-controlling step involves an electron trans-
fer, and the subsequent reactions are relatively fast and occur before the radical an-
ion and radical cation are solvent-separated, the tetracyanoquinonodimethane radi-
cal anion would not be observed. 
Successful ESR results have been obtained in the case of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-
p-benzoquinone (A), which reacts with isobutyl vinyl ether (D) much faster than the 
analogous reaction with tetracyanoquinonodimethane. The ESR spectrum of a radi-
cal ion was recorded by flow technique and is shown in Figure 4.123.

In acetonitrile, this acceptor and alkyl vinyl ethers undergo a rapid one-electron 
transfer through a charge-transfer complex, to yield a radical anion of 2,3-dichloro-
5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (4.128) and a radical cation of the alkyl vinyl ether 
(4.129), and a subsequent cationic polymerization (4.133):

Initiation with tetracyanoquinonodimethane is assumed to proceed by an analogous 
mechanism to that in acetonitrile. 
ESR studies have been made showing that charge-transfer complexes (CT) may 
play an important role in initiating the polymerization of N-vinylcarbazole (D) with 
gaseous catalysts such as halogen or sulphur dioxide (A)1604, 2282, 2283). The results 
are summarized in Table 4.11. 
The ESR spectra obtained for almost all complexes were singlets, without hyperfine 
splitting structure, and were attributed to radical cations (4.130) or (4.131):

4.8. Cationic Polymerization 
Fig. 4.124. ESR spectrum of isobutyl 
vinyl ether-iodine system measured 
at 77 K22S7) 
The observed g-value 2.0057, somewhat larger than that for a free spin 2.0023, indi-
cates a considerable spin density on oxygen due to conjugation, which makes the 
radical cation reluctant to recombine. 
ESR signals have also been observed in systems of styrene-I2 , alkyl vinyl ether-
BF30(C2Hsh, and styrene-BF30(C2Hsh, but the radical concentration was small 
in comparison with the alkyl vinyl ether-I2 system22S7). 
4.8.1. Photo-I nduced Cationic Polymerization 
Photo-induced ionic polymerization of a-methylstyrene in polar solvents, in the 
presence of tetracyanobenzene 1011, 1013) or pyromellitic dianhydride 1014) and of 
cycIohexane oxide, occurs via cationic propagation mechanism. Tetracyanobenzene 
and pyromellitic dianhydride are known as strong electron acceptors, while a-methyl-
styrene and cycIohexane oxide are weak electron donors. A pair of these together 
forms an electron donor-acceptor (EDA) complex. 
The ESR spectrum observed during photo-irradiation of tetracyanobenzene-a-
methylstyrene in n-butanol at room temperature is composed of nine hyperfine lines 
(Fig. 4.125).

styrene (1.5 mole 1-1) and tetracyano-
benzene (0.0006 mole 1-1) UV-irradiated

This ESR spectrum has been attributed to spin coupling with the four equivalent 
nitrogen nuclei in tetracyanobenzene anion. This result shows that the electron-donor 
complex dissociates from its excited state to the ions: tetracyanobenzene anion and 
a-methyl styrene radical cation 1011, 2462). The initiation process occurs via the fol-
lowing mechanism:

4.8.2. Cationic Polymerization Initiated with Lewis Acids 
Lewis acids are used to generate carbonium ions which are applied to initiate cationic 
polymerization. The Lewis acids used as Friedel-Crafts catalysts are metal halides of 
Group III metals - most frequently the following: ZnC12, CuCl2, Ale13 , BF3, GaCI3, 
SnCl4 and SbCI5. ESR studies of Lewis acids have been presented in several papers 
753,787,788,939,940,945,1229,1354,2213,2517). It is well known that metal halides 
are inactive catalysts, and that cocatalysts such as water, protonic acids, and alkyl 
halides are required to activate the catalyst. 
It has been found that some of the pure Lewis acids have a catalytic activity in 
free radical polymerization. For example, during 'Y-irradiation of methyl methacrylate-
ZnCl2 complex (1: 1) unsymmetrical ESR spectrum have been observed as consisting 
of nine lines (Fig. 4.126 a), whereas 'Y-irradiation of pure methyl methacrylate gives 
seven-line spectra (Fig. 4.126b)940).

The spectra of methyl methacrylate-ZnCl2 complex become sharper and more sym· 
metrical with increasing temperature. The nine-line spectrum has been assigned to 
radicals of type (4.67), containing two or three monomer units.

4.9. Heterogenous Chain-Growth Polymerization 
4.9.1. Ziegler-Natta Catalysts 
Ziegler-Natta type catalyst systems are extensively used as catalysts for stereospecific 
polymerization of a-olefms and dienes. Although many studies have been carried out, 
the nature of the active polymerization centers is not completely established. 
Aluminium alkyls are the most commonly used organometallic compounds in 
Ziegler-Natta catalytic systems. ESR studies have been reported for the following 
aluminium alkyls: AlRC121251), AlEt2Cl, AlEtCI2, AlEt32261), AlEt3-ZnCI22453), 
and AlEt2Cl-ZnCI2752, 788) for initiating polymerization and copolymerization. 
Especially interesting is the bimetallic complex system AlEt3 -ZnCl2 which is the 
basis for alternating complex copolymerization 1870, 1874,2453). The behavior of the 
radicals derived from this catalytic system was examined by ESR spectra using spin 
trapping technique2453) (see Chapter 11.3). 
Several different homogeneous and heterogeneous Ziegler catalysts have been 
examined by ESR spectroscopy12, 22-24, 36, 48, 49, 64, 156,305,310,335,491,558,633, 
912-915,936,937,942-944,971,1172,1221,1297,1410, 1436, 1619, 1622, 1659,1663,1740, 
2141,2142,2195,2197,2198,2394,2395,2485) 
ESR studies are very useful for catalyst systems which involve transition metals 
such as Ti and Y, but the interpretation of the ESR spectra is difficult. It has been 
found that only "Ziegler complexes" which contain Ti(II1) with an unpaired electron 
(3 d 1 configuration) form ESR spectra. Most Ti(II1) compounds have g values in the 
range of 1.86_2.01 1302). TiCl3 itself shows two absorptions778, 1170, 1658, 1659) 
(Fig. 4.127). 
One line is sharp (Fig. 4.127b) with a g-value of 1.94 and the other is broad 
(Fig. 4.127c)1659). When triethylaluminium (AlEt3) solution was added to TiCI3, 
an ESR spectrurn{Fig. 4.128) with two new absoIptions was obtained1659, 1663). 
The solid phase from the mixture of TiCl3 and diethylaluminium chloride (AlEt2Cl) 
gives the same signal as in Figure 4.128 b, which suggests the identity of the action 
of di- and tri-alkyl aluminium on the titanium trichloride surface. The ESR signals 
(g = 1.97) obtained from the liqUid phase of both systems were assigned to reaction 
products of alkyl aluminium with titanium tetrachloride occluded in the solid. The 
intensities of the singlet-line absorption with g = 1.97 increased considerably in the 
presence of ole fins, in the same order as the polymerization activity of the catalyst 
systems, i.e. AlEt3 > AlEt2Cl > AlEtCh ~ 01659). This observation suggests that the 
ESR spectrum with g = 1.97 is due to the polymerization centers for the initial poly-
merization of propylene in presence of TiCl3 -AlEt3. 
ESR spectra of heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts of the types TiCl4 -AlR3. 
TiC4-AlRCI2, TiCI4-AlR2CI, or Ti(OR')4-AlRCh are dependent on the structure 
of the titanate and the type of solvent. The reduction of tetravalent titanium to tri-
valent in a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system has been examined in detail by IR spectro-
scopy2196).

both aliphatic and aromatic solvents, but secondary titanates give the a-TiCIJ type 
only in aromatic solvents971). 
The a-TiCIJ type catalyst species has an ESR signal with a g-value of 
1.940 ± 0.003. The 3 d1 electron in (i-TiCIJ complex is spin-paired with other (i-TiCI3 
molecules and does not give an ESR signal22- 24, 491, 971, 219S). a-TiCIJ type catalysts 
produce trans-I,4-polymerization of dienes, while (i-TiCI3 type produces cis-l,4-poly-
merization of dienes971). 
The homogeneous Ziegler catalysts of the type n-butyl titanate-AlEt3 at room 
temperature in solution show ESR spectra attributed also to Ti(III) with a g-value 
of 1.951 (Fig.4.129)9J6). 
Fig. 4.129. ESR spectrum of n-butyl titanate-triethyl-
aluminum catalyst system ~t 195 K936) 
A series of seven kinds of ESR signals was detected at Al/Ti ratios less than two, 
where no polymerization of the conjugated dienes took place. Another series of four 
signals with g-values of 1.934, 1.952, 1.966, and 1.979 was detected at Al/Ti ratios 
larger than 2.9, where the conjugated dienes were polymerized. The signals of the 
latter series were ascribed to the active species for polymerization of the conjugated 
168 

4.9. Heterogenous Chain-Growth Polymerization 
dienes, and these structures were polymerized. The signals of the latter series were 
attributed to the active species for polymerization of the conjugated dienes, and these 
structures were proposed to have at least two active titanium-ethyl bonds and one 
alkoxy group as shown in structure (4.133). Structure (4.134) was proposed for 
species responsible for the ESR signal with g-value of 1.952 and a hyperfine structure 
of 11 components636): 
(4.133) 
(4.134) 
A detailed discussion of the ESR study of these systems is presented in a later paper 
of this series937). 
Another important group of Ziegler-Natta catalysts consists of the vanadium type 
catalysts VCl4-AlR3, VCl4-AlRCl2, and VCl4-AlR2Cl. Their ESR spectra in solid 
and liquid phases are also dependent on the structure of the vanadium halide and the 
type of solvent used633, 1334, 1580). Some of these ESR spectra are shown in Figure 
4.130.

The liquid phase ofVCl4-AlEt3 shows an eight-component spectrum (Fig. 4.130a) 
due to the 7/2 nuclear spin of V, and the solid phase gives a singlet-spectrum 
(Fig. 4. 130 a). From the VCl4-AlEt2Cl and VCl4-AlEtCl2 similar spectra were ob-
tained (Fig. 4.130b and 4.130e and Figs. 4.130c and 4.130f, respectively). Since 
the width of the spectral lines corresponds to the electron density around the vana-
dium atom, these results suggest that the reducing power of the alkylaluminium com-
pounds are in the order AlEt3 < AlEt2Cl R:: AlEtCh.

4. ESR Study of Polymerization 
ESR studies of another vanadium type catalyst V(acach-AlEt3 for polymeriza-
tion944) and VO(acac h -AlEt3(AlEt2CI) for inducing alternating copolymerization 738) 
have also been reported. 
4.9.2. Phillips Catalysts 
The Phillips catalyst (chromium oxide supported on silica-alumina) is used as a com-
mercial catalyst for polymerization of ethylene. The catalyst is activated by calcina-
tion at 773-873 K in a dry air stream. 
Several authors have investigated the narrow resonance line of the ESR spectra 
of chromium-alumina or chromium-silica-alumina catalystsl12, 337, 533, 619, 620, 1080, 
1104,1431,1434,1667,1722,1764,1845,2348). The activated catalyst has an ESR spec-
trum containing a sharp and symmetrical component (Fig. 4.131) near 3500 G which 
can be assigned to Cr5+, and a very broad component between 1500G and 3500 G 
assigned to Cr3+ 1431).

catalysts: a. signal of the original catalyst

catalyst, d. signal of the used catalyst for 
ethylene polymerization for 40 min at 313 K 
under 300 mm Hg pressurel431) 
Heat treatment (573 K in vacuum) changes the ESR spectrum. The symmetrical 
signal with large amplitude from the activated catalyst changes to a small, asymmetri-
cal, broad one with less area. When ethylene is added, the amplitude of the signal 
distinctly decreases following the polymerization. The role of heat treatment is con-
sidered to be the removal of traces of impurities from the surface of the catalyst, 
exposing the Cr5+ ions on the surface. During the polymerization of ethylene at 
418 K the ESR signal intensity reaches a maximum value and then decreases continu-
ously39, 1103,2063,2965). The maximum is observed during the induction period 
which precedes the maximum rate. The decrease of relative intensity of the ESR 
spectra during polymerization is considered to be the result of a reduction of 
Cr5+ 1431). ESR studies indicate that there exists some correlation between the 
intensity of the sharp ESR signal and the catalytic activity2063, 2064).

4.9. Heterogenous Chain-Growth Polymerization 
4.9.3. Other Metal Catalysts for Polymerization 
Czechoslovak scientistsl60-163, 969, 970) have devoted several papers to the ESR study 
of copper chelates, e.g. bis-( -)ephedrine copper(II)chelate. These Cu(II)complexes 
catalyze the decomposition of different organic peroxides e.g. benzoyl peroxide, 
cumene peroxide 160, 163), and azo-bis(iso bu tyro nitrile ) 969). The reactivity of these 
complexes with a,a'-diphenyl-~-picrylhydrazyle (DPPH) has also been investigated161, 
970). Ephedrine copper(II)chelate initiate polymerization of di(methacrylate)ethylene 
glycol 1462). 
An ESR study has been reported on the polymerization of 2,6-dimethyl-phenol 
by the complex of copper(I) salt with pyridine 1836, 1837) and 2,6-dichlorophenol by 
the copper(II) complex with hexamethylphosphoramide2303). 
Formation of complexes of copper ions in the reaction of copper oleate with a 
polyketone974) and poly-4-vinylpyridine1l32) has been proved by ESR spectroscopy. 
Japanese scientists999) have reported an ESR study of vinyl polymerization initiated 
by amine-copper(II) complexes in the presence of tetrahydrofurane. 
Tkac et al.1767, 2198,2206,2207) made ESR studies on the heterogeneous catalytic 
system Ni(O)colloid-Ni(I}Ni(II) for low-pressure polymerization of butadiene. Co-
ordinated radical polymerization of butadiene by rhodium nitrate in ethanol has also 
been investigated with the application of ESR spectroscopyI626). 
ESR spectra of complex-bonded radicals formed by reaction of cobalt(II) acetyl-
acetonate with t-butyl hydroperoxide2208) and ESR study of the ageing effect of 
tris(acetonylacetonate)chromium(II}triethylaIuminium catalysts have been re-
ported94l). ESR study ofvanadyl acetonate and triethylamine complex as catalyst 
for acetylene polymerization has been presented by Russian scientists1S77). 
An ESR study of the polymerization of di(methacrylate)ethylene glycol in the 
presence of t-butyl magnesium chloride was also published842). 
Bulgarian scientists studied the vinyl polymerization initiated by metal complexes 
of dicarbonyl compounds 1698) and aromatic nitryles 1703). 
4.9.4. Polymerization Initiated by Clays 
It has been stated that neutral clays such as montmorillonite, kaolinite, and illite have 
the ability to promote the polymerization of vinyl-pyridine and butadiene 722). The 
ESR study shows that these clay minerals have unpaired electrons which are respon-
sible for inducing a "spontaneous" free radical polymerization. 
4.9.5. Polymerization Initiated by Silica Gel 
Mechanical grinding of silica gel leads to the formation of free radicals as evidenced 
by ESR signals. These radicals can initiate the polymerization of styrene, vinyl acetate, 
ethyleneimine, and even thiophene which is difficult to polymerize2079-2081). Also 
unground silica gel heated to 453-473 K exhibits high chemical activity, believed 
171 

4. ESR Study of Polymerization 
to be due to surface radicals formed during the elimination of water, as shown by 
ESR signals. 
4.9.6. Polymerization Initiated by Molecular Sieves 
During 'Y-irradiation at 77 K of molecular sieves free electrons are formed, which can 
further produce a-vinyl-substituted radicals from a-chlorovinyl (4.144) and acetylenic 
(4.145) compounds absorbed on molecular sieves 192, 245,475,1427,1428).

The main problem in these studies is that the free radicals are very reactive. For that 
reason they must be kept at low concentration for separating the molecules in the 
matrix and at low temperature to prevent radical migration. As a result the ESR 
spectra are poorly resolved. The vinyl acetyl radical gives three different spectra, 
depending on temperature1553, 1554). The ESR spectrum of the a-styryl radical 
(4.135) obtained by 'Y-irradiation at 77 K of phenylacetylene is shown in Figure

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
The formation of free radicals in polymers exposed to the simultaneous action of 
'Y-radiation and light has been studied by Russian scientists1l34, 1486, 1488, 1489, 
1771,2487). The interpretation of ESR spectra to determine the radicals formed in 
these conditions is complicated, on account of the simultaneous reactions of the 
formation and transformation of radicals. For that reason, we prefer to give in this 
chapter separate descriptions of ESR studies of free radicals formed in vacuum by 
ionizing and light irradiation respectively. The oxidation processes of free radicals 
formed during the degradation in the presence of air (oxygen) will be discussed 
separately in Chapter 7. 
5.1.1. Polyolefines 
5.1.1.1. n-Alkane Single Crystals 
'Y-Irradiation of single crystal of n-paraffins containing 4-20 carbon atoms, e.g. 
hexane, decane, hexadecane, and eicosane give rise to ESR spectra from secondary 
alkyl radicals (5.1 and 5.2?31, 773, 775, 776, 1393, 1394). 
(5.1) 
(5.2) 
The relative concentration of radicals (5.2) increases as the number of carbon 
atoms becomes larger. The quantity of radicals (5.1) is in agreement with the mecha-
nism where all C-H bonds in an n-alkane molecule are ruptured with the same proba-
bility, and in which an isomerization of primary to secondary alkyl radicals follows. 
For n-decane this mechanism predicts 45.5% of radical, (5.1) as compared to the 
experimental value of 42.5%775). 
ESR spectra of trapped electrons in 'Y-irradiated poly crystalline hydrocarbons 
as n-nonane, n-decane, and n-hexadecane l037), and radical pairs in single crystal of 
n-eicosane856), were also reported.

In this type of radical the unpaired electron occupies a carbon p-orbital and only 
the protons in the a- and (3-positions are expected to have measurable coupling con-
stants. The hyperfme coupling constant (aHp) can be described by the following 
relationship904,2123): 
(5.1) 
where BHp is a constant, p is the spin density on the a-carbon (Ca ), and S is the 
angle between the H-Cp plane and the axis of the p-orbital at the C a carbon con-
taining the unpaired electron (see Fig. 4.86). The constant BHp is small (a few gauss 
or less) and independent of S.

(5.3) 2154) 
The spectral shape of alkyl radical (5.3) differs a little for samples of different 
crystallinities (Fig. 5.2)2154). 
The hyperfine splitting constant of the H/3 is about 30 G (HQ - and H/3-protons 
are equal), while the line width varies between 15 and 25 G, because of the different 
orientation of the H/3-protons with respect to the magnetic field. Using the coupling 
constants of alkyl radicals of polyethylene obtained by Kiselev et al. 1137) aQ = 22.4 G 
and a/3 = 33.1 G and assuming Gaussian shape and the line width 15.5 G, Tamura 
and Shinohara2154) calculated the spectrum of alkyl radical (5.3) which is shown in 
Figure 5.3. 
. 
Sohma et al. 157Z, 1574) examined in detail the steric configuration of alkyl radi-
cals in connection with molecular motion of the matrix polymer. Variation in the 
steric configuration of the free radicals are due to the variations in the steric con-
formation of the molecular chain sites at which unpaired electrons are formed. This 
occurrence influences the interpretation of observed ESR spectra. 
Alkyl radicals (5.3) may be formed by dissociation of excited states (5.2i 713-
1715) or by ion-molecular reactions (5.3_5.4)1030, 2185):

Polyethylene samples irradiated at 291 K give a septet-line ESR spectrum, which 
is generally attributed to the allyl radical (5.4) with the hyperfine splitting constant 
of21 G101,439, 1082, 1191, 1309, 1310, 1638, 1641, 1649, 1650, 1812,2027):

Fig. 5.4. a. Configuration of allyl radical (5.4), b. View of the allyl radical along the Cl -C3 bond

Auerbach 102, 103) has proposed an ionic mechanism for the formation of the 
allyl radical (5.4). This mechanism seems less probable, because the positive radical 
ions largely disappear, especially after heating to room temperature2392). 
When polyethylene is irradiated by doses of several thousand megarads, the 
observed ESR spectrum becomes a singlet line which has been assigned to a con-
jugated polyene radical (5.5)1310, 1641, 1650): 
The line width of this singlet, with increasing doses, converges towards 17 G. 
The delocalization of the electron associated with a long chain of conjugated un-
saturation is expected to produce a singlet-line ESR spectrum861). Alternatively, 
the ESR spectra due to various polyene radicals may overlap and yield a broad single 
peak239). The polyenyl radicals are very stable under vacuum. In the presence of 
oxygen, the concentration of polyenyl radicals decreases. 
5.1.1.2.2. Radical Formation under UV-Irradiation. ESR of free radicals produced 
by UV-irradiation of polyethylene has been investigated by many workers322, 436, 
440,850,1053,1652,1817,1981, 1983, 1984,2144,2145,2156,2241,2242,2244,2247,2248, 
2250,2262,2263,2265,2267,2269-2274,2277,2284,2285). The polymer irradiated with 
UV-light at 77 K in nitrogen atmosphere has an ESR spectrum as presented in Figure 
S.S.a. 
Browning et al.322) and Ranby and Yoshida1812, 1817) obtained a six-line spec-
trum with a hyperfine splitting constant of 33 G, and traces of a quintet with a hyper-
fine splitting constant of 30 G. This spectrum was interpreted by these authors, and 
later also by Tsuji and Seiki227 l), as being due to the superposition of two kinds of 
free radicals: alkyl radical (5.3) (a six-line spectrum) and end radical (5.6) (quintet-
line spectrum): 
176 

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
Tsuji2247, 2265) suggested that this spectrum should be interpreted as an eight-
line spectrum, because two more lines appear on both sides of the six-line spectrum322, 
1812,1817), and can be attributed to the free radical (S. 7) which could be formed 
from radical (S.6) by internal hydrogen migration.

tube filled with nitrogen gas at 760 mm Hg, b. Pressure in the sample tube 10-6 mm Hg. The 
separation between the to Mn2+ is 86.7 G2267) 
Another possible free radical which can give an eight-line spectrum is the free 
radical (S.8) 
A small broad singlet ESR spectrum has been observed during vacuum irradiation 
of polyethylene at 77 K1652, 2267) (Fig. 5.5b). 
S. 1. 1. 2. 2.1. ESR Studies on Photosensitized Degradation of Polyethylene. The photo-
sensitized decomposition of polymers is well known and was extensively reviewed 
by Rabekl775, 1779, 1780, 1782-1784, 1814). The mechanism of photosensitized genera-
tion of free radicals in polyethylene was investigated by Tsuji et a1.2144, 2145, 2244, 
2246,2281). In the case of aromatic sensitizers, e.g. naphthalene, anthracene, phenan-
threne, and pyrene, it has been found that energy transfer from higher triplet states 
of excited sensitizer molecules to unsaturated bonds in polyethylene may occur2145, 
2281). An excited unsaturated group may release its allylic hydrogen atom, giving an 
allylic radical (S.4), for which ESR spectra have been recorded. 
In the case of polyethylene-containing ferric stearate, observable ESR signals of 
free radicals (S. 7) were obtained under UV and visible light irradiation2250). These 
results show that ferric stearate can sensitize polyethylene decomposition in that 
range of visible light which is not absorbed by the polymer molecule alone.

ethylene in the presence of 1,1 ,4,4-tetraphenylbutadiene. 
5.1.1.2.3. Conversion of Free Radicals Under Light Irradiation and Warming. An 
interesting feature is the changes of radical structures, obtained by gamma-, electron-
and light-irradiation, on further irradiation with light and on warming384, 520, 638, 
1086,1151,1467,1479,1483,1519,1602,1613,1652, 1981, 1983-1987,2156,2246,2247, 
2391,2393) 
Allylic radicals (5.4) can be converted by two mechanisms dependent on the 
experimental conditions 1983, 1985): 
1. When the allylic radicals (5.4) are irradiated with UV-light, they are converted 
to alkyl radicals (5.3). Further heating reconverts the alkyl radicals to stable allylic 
radicals (5.4):

2. When the allylic radicals (5.4) are irradiated with visible light (X> 3900 A), 
main chain scission and the presence of alkyl radicals (5. 7) are observed (5.11). This 
alkyl radical (5.7) can then be converted to another alkyl radical (5.3) by warming 
for a short time to 273 K (5.12). Long warming of the alkyl radicals (5. 7) to room 
temperature (273 K) converts them back to allylic radicals (5.4) (5.13). The trans-
formation of free radicals can be described by the following reactions:

The second poblem concerns the conversion of alkyl radicals (5. 7). Two radical 
conversions were elucidated by Tsuji et al.2242, 2246-2248, 2269, 2271):

The acyl radical (5.9) gives a sharp singlet spectrum (g = 2.001) which is formed 
after warming the sample to 195 K. The singlet decayed at about 233 K, and at 
263 K a well-resolved septet-line spectrum (g = 2.003) is formed, which has been 
attributed to allyl radical (5.4) and after visible light irradiation (A> 3900 A) con-
verts into alkyl radical (5.7)(5.15). 
Commercial polyethylene contains carbonyl groups in the main chain which 
absorb UV-light at about 2800 A. It has been shown that an ESR spectrum of poly-
ethylene is formed when a polymer sample is irradiated with UV-light of wavelength 
longer than 2.800 A 2271,2272). After absorption of photons at 77 K carbonyl groups 
are excited to the triplet state and then a Norrish type I reaction may occur:

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
At about 133 K-the free radicals (5. 7) change into alkyl radicals (5.3). Carbon 
oxide formed in reaction 5.16 reacts with radical (5.3) at about 153 K and the rate 
is controlled by diffusion of CO molecules into the polymer phase at this temperature:

The acyl radical (5.9) has been observed as a sharp singlet at 150 K in the ESR 
spectra shown in Figure 5.6. A similar singlet spectrum (g = 2.001) due to acyl radi-
cals was observed immediately after 'Y-irradiation of an ethylene-acrolein copolymer 
at 77 K2249). 
Hama et al.849, 850) suggested that the excitation of carbonyl groups in poly-
ethylene is followed by chain-bond dissociation and formation of acyl radical of type 
(5.10). These radicals are converted by the absorption of visible light to free radicals

5.1.1.2.4. Morphological Effects on the' Formation and Behavior of Radicals. The 
identity and behavior of radical species formed by UV-irradiation of crystalline 
polymers have been extensively investigated by the ESR method1275, 1388,2262,2263). 
Loy 1388) and Tsuji2242, 2263, 2265, 2271) suggested that preferential radical for-
mation occurs in the amorphous regions of the irradiated polyethylene. On the other 
hand, in a study of solution-grown polyethylene single crystals, Salovey et al.1889, 
1891) and Takayanagi et al.1275) have suggested that the free radicals are preferentially 
trapped in the intermediately disordered regions of the crystalline texture. 
Samples in which the polymer chains are oriented by stretching give two different 
ESR spectra after irradiation 926, 1088, 1137, 1268). One is attributed to radicals on 
polymer chains oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field, showing a 100line 
spectrum with a hyperfine splitting constant of 15 G and a line width of 11.5 G. The 
other spectrum,obtained with chains parallel to the magnetic field, shows a sharp 
sextet with a hyperfine splitting constant of 32.5 G. An interesting correlation be-
tween the degree of orientation and the hyperfine splitting constant of the a-proton 
has been found 1088). Salovey and Yager1891) observed the overlapping six-line and 
ten-line patterns of the ESR spectra from irradiated solution-grown crystals of poly-
ethylene. The ESR spectra were clearly resolved, because of the high crystallinity 
and excellent orientation of polyethylene chains at right angles to the lamellar 
crystals. 
Sohma et al. 1982, 1988) have recorded the variation of the alkyl radical (5.3) 
spectra at 77 K as a function of the angle (1/1) between the direction of magnetic 
field and the c-axis of polyethylene crystals (Fig. 5.7). 
From the observed ESR spectra, the principal values of the hyperfine coupling 
tensor were estimated to be I Az I = 13.6 G, I Ax I = 26.0 G and I Ay I = 40.6 G, where

5.1.1.2.5. Decay of Free Radicals. When polyethylene containing free radicals was 
heated to room temperature, a substantial decrease in radical concentration was ob-
served by several authors100, 104,486,568,569,1084,1309-1311,1191,1388,1574,1612, 
1638,1688,1936,1937,2045,2049,2391,2392), 
Free radicals present in polyethylene have different lifetimes. The fast-decaYing 
free radicals (about 1 day) are alkyl radicals (5.3). The allyl radicals (5.4) have a life-
time of several months at 77 K. The polyene radicals (5.5) are very stable even at 
room temperature I650). 
Russian scientistsl191 ) suggested that, in the presence of double bonds, alkyl 
radicals (5.3) change into allyl radicals (5.4) by hydrogen migration. A previous sug-
gestion is that alkyl radicals can migrate in polyethylene by a random-walk pro-
cess568,569). 
Work made by Ormerodl668) on the decay of alkyl radicals at room temperature 
indicates that the decay is a composite effect caused by the reactions: 
(5.20) 
R' + -CH2 -CH=CH----+ RH + -CH-CH=CH-
(5.21) 
R' + -CH-CH=CH-----+ -CH(R)-CH=CH-
(5.22) 
Waterman and Dole2392) presented evidence that alkyl radicals (5.3) which per-
sist at room temperature after an electron beam irradiation at 77 K are quantitatively 
converted to allyl radicals (5.4) by the reaction with trans-vinylene or vinyl double 
182 

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
bonds. Dienyl and trienyl radicals are formed by a similar process involving an alkyl 
radical and diene and triene structures, respectively. About 70% of the alkyl radicals 
(5.3) decayed by reacting with vinyl type unsaturation and the remainder with 
vinylene groups. 
During the irradiation of polyethylene the alkyl radicals are probably not pro-
duced in a uniform distribution but in tracks, spurs, etc. The initial distribution of 
the allyl radicals, on the other hand, depends on the localization of unsaturation, 
chiefly at vinyl end groups in polyethylene. Allyl radicals (5.4) are formed sub-
sequently to irradiation at 77 K by migration of alkyl radicals (5.3) to groups adja-
cent to a double bond2402). 
A generally accepted opinion is that radical decay occurs by recombination, 
although there are some differences in opinion concerning the decay mechanism. 
Thus, there is a question whether the kinetics is first- or second-order104, 366, 383, 
486.566,1309) 
Decay curves of alkyl radicals (5.3) can be interpreted by second-order kinet-
iCS104, 439,1574,1668,1985), although the initial and the last parts of decay curve do 
not conform to second-order kinetics (Fig. 5.8).

ethylene 1 04) 
When interpreted as first-order kinetics, the decay is presumed to involve more 
than two stages with different rate constants486, 568, 1309, 1310,2392). The decay 
constant of alkyl radicals (5.3) increases with the amorphous fraction of polyethyl-
ene. The decay is markedly catalyzed by hydrogen gas which is soluble only in the 
amorphous fraction517, 1060, 1061, 1235, 1236, 1668,2392,2401). The most reasonable 
suggestion is that alkyl radicals (5.3) under vacuum are converted to allyl radicals 
(5.4) with first-order kinetics, and a residue of the radicals decay with second-order 
kineticsI936). Allyl radicals decay according to diffusion-controlled second-order 
kinetics2402) . 
Oxygen provides an alternative decay mechanism of alkyl radicals to peroxy 
radicals. Auerbach and Saunders 1 04) have shown the effect of oxygen on the second-
order decay of alkyl radicals (5.3) in polyethylene (Fig. 5.9). 
183 

5. ESR Study of Degradation Processes in Polymers 
The amorphous and crystalline phases provide different radical recombination 
rates in a diffusion-controlled reaction366). For better understanding of this mecha-
nism there exists a useful theory of LebedevI321), which is based on a model of two 
kinetic processes: 
1. A slow motion of the radicals in the solid phase occurs until they reach a 
favorable position for the reaction followed by: 
2. A fast recombination of the radicals in the activated volume unit where they 
are located. 
Alkyl radicals trapped in crystalline regions can migrate to the surfaces of crystal-
lites by hydrogen abstraction and then decay by reaction with oxygen at the sur-
face 1936). The kinetics of the radical decay can well be explained by a diffusion 
theory, assuming that the decay rate is controlled by the rate of radical migration in 
the crystallites. 
5.1.1.2.6. Ethylene Copolymers. ESR studies of ethylene-acrolein2245, 2249) and 
ethylene-styrene2253) copolymers UV-irradiated at 77 K have given similar results 
as those for polyethylene.

2467,2488) and neutron837) radiation, many radical structures have been proposed. 
Irradiation of polypropylene at 77 K gives formation of radicals (5.12) which 
are observed as eight- or nine-line ESR spectra (Fig. 5.10)115,679,708,1149,1483,

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
There is no good agreement between the results. Chadesby et al. 1363) have 
reported formation of a six-line spectrum of alkyl radicals (5.3) during 'Y-irradiation 
of polypropylene at 77 K. Ohnishi et al. 1640) found that the spectrum of polypropyl-
ene irradiated and measured at 195 K consists of four different components, which 
could be characterized as eight-, seven-, six- and one-line spectra. No attempt was 
made to assign these spectra to specific radicals. Forrestal and Hodgson 708) inter-
preted their low temperature spectra as being composed of equal amounts of eight-
line and broad four-line spectra, which were assigned to radical (5.12) and radical 
(5.13) or (5.14), respectively:

Loy 1392) using a deuterium-substituted polymer, concluded that the spectrum 
consists of a quartet due to radical (5.13) and a trace of nonet-line spectrum due to 
radical (5.12). 
Isotactic polypropylene which is 'Y-irradiated at room temperature, gives a well-
resolved ESR spectrum of 17 lines at the same temperature. From experiments with 
oriented samples, Fischer and Hellwege679) reported that this 17-line spectrum is due 
to an allyl radical with two resonance forms (5.15) and (5.16):

The formation of allyl radical is strongly supported by ESR measurements made 
by Milinchuk et al. 1150, 1157, 1161, 1480, 1481, 1483, 1485, 1486). ESR studies of 'Y-irra-
diated isotactic polypropylene by Iwasaki et al. 1031) and Milinchuk et al. 1151 , 1159, 
1480) have shown that the 17-line spectrum appears as a 9-line spectrum when mea-
sured at 77 K. When the irradiated sample is exposed to UV-light for a short time, 
this 9-line spectrum is converted to a four-line spectrum due to radical (5.13). 
Yoshida and Ranby2467) have also analyzed the low temperature spectrum of 
oriented polypropylene and interpreted it as a sum of a quartet due to radicals 
(5.13) or (5.14) and an anisotropic spectrum due to radical (5.15). Ayscough and 
Munari 117) re-examined the ESR spectra obtained at room temperature with stretched 
and unstretched polypropylene. They compared these spectra with those of irradiated 
model hydrocarbons at 77 K, which gave an allylic radical (5.4) with a spectrum 
differing from that of the proposed radical (5.15-5.16). Ohnishi et a1. 1640) also 
proposed the formation of radical (5. 7). The lack of agreement reported for ESR 
spectra and their interpretation may partially be caused by differences in samples 
used by the various investigators. It is expected that the difference in stereoregularity 
of isotactic polypropylene and atactic polypropylene affects the ESR spectra 1265, 1665). 
The difference in hyperfine structure of the spectra of isotactic polypropylene and 
of atactic polypropylene can be explained by different radical conformation related 
to the stereo-regularity. The hyperfine coupling and conformations of radical (5.12) 
in isotactic and atactic polypropylene are shown in Tables 5.1 and 5.2, respectively.

The spectral change from a 9-Iine to a 17-Iine spectrum with elevation of tem-
perature for isotactic polypropylene can be explained by hindered oscillation of the 
l3-methylene protons. 
Japanese scientistsl270) have made ESR studies giving information on the sites 
of trapped radicals in the different phases of isotactic polypropylene samples. They 
treated the polypropylene samples with fuming nitric acid which removed the dis-
ordered regions stepwise. The free radical sites of etched samples were largely con-
centrated in the defects of crystal regions.

One spectral component is a quartet with sharp lines (Fig. 5.11) which has been 
interpreted as being due to methyl radical (5.17)322, 854, 855, 2268, 2466):

Tsuji and Seiki2268) have reported that the formation and decay of methyl radi-
cal (5.17) are dependent on pressure. The other components of spectra, containing 
broad lines, were assigned to radicals of the type (5.3), which are the counterparts of 
the methyl radicals and to radicals (5.13) and (5.14)322, 855, 1812, 1817,2278). In addi-
tion, Ranby and Yoshida1817) have suggested that the broad-line quartet could also 
be caused by radicals (5.18) formed by main chain scission: 
-CH2 -CH-CH2

A detailed mechanism of radical formation during UV-irradiation of polypropyl-
ene is described by Harna et al.854, 855) and Tsuji and Seiki2246, 2275, 2278). In their 
interpretation, the UV-light is mainly absorbed by carbonyl groups in polyproylene 
produced by oxidation 1784, 1814). The wavelength dependence of radical fonna-
tion 2275) indicates that methyl radicals and other free radicals (5.13) and (5.14), 
responSible for the broad four-line spectrum, are produced by secondary reactions 
of free radicals, which show a singlet spectrum. Photolysis with light of longer wave-
length changed the singlet spectrum to the four-line spectrum. The Singlet spectrum 
is supposed to be due to free acyl radicals (5.19) which are formed when a carbonyl 
group absorbs UV-light at 77 K. Scission of the main chain occurs and acyl radicals 
(5.19) are formed:

An ESR study of free radicals formed during the degradation of polypropylene

5.1.1.4. Molecular Motions in Solid Polyolefines 
Relations between the decay of trapped radicals and the molecular motion of the 
polymer matrix have been discussed by many authors101, 104, 1082, 1084, 1086, 1274, 
1269,1309,1379,1571,1572,1574, 1645, 1798,2049,2147,2156) 
The kinetic curves of radical amount vs temperature have typical fast and slow 
portions. At certain temperatures, considerable amounts of radicals become trapped 
in the solid polymer and the decay is practically stopped (Fig. 5.12). 
The decay characteristic of free radicals in irradiated polyethylene indicate that 
the decay varies with the motion of polymer molecules of the matrix:, trapping the 
free radicals1084). Similar phenomena have been discussed for hydrocarbon molecules 
of low molecular weightI95). An increase of pressure hinders molecular motion by 
reducing the voids. The stability of free radicals irt polyethylene2116) and polypropyl-
ene2115) increases, therefore, proportionally with pressure. At about 8000 atm, most 
of the molecular motion is eliminated, so that further increase does not significally 
affect the decay rate constant. 
Sohma et al.1086, 1572, 1574) stated that there are three temperature regions, in 
which the free radicals decay very rapidly. These regions are at about 120,200, and 
250 K and were designated as TA , TL , and TB, respectively (Fig. 5.12). The decay 
of the free radicals in high-density polyethylene at these temperatures has activation 
energies of 0.4 kcal/mole for T A, 9.4 kcal/mole for T L, and 18.4 kcal/mole for T B. 
For low-density polyethylene these values are 0.7 kcal/mol for TA , 23.1 kcal/mole 
for T L, and 24.8 kcal/mole for T B. Comparison of the time constants for the decay 
reactions, and for the molecular motions of the polymer matrix, indicates that the 
decay at T A and T B is closely related to molecular motion in the amorphous regions

of the polymer. The decay of the free radicals at T L in high-density polyethylene is 
due to molecular motion associated with local mode relaxation at lamellar surfaces, 
while that of low-density polyethylene is due to local mode relaxation in the com-
pletely amorphous regions. This study shows that the free radicals which decayed in 
the lower temperature region have a less uniform steric configuration than that of 
free radicals which decayed in higher temperature regions. 
Steric configuration of alkyl radical (5.12) in irradiated polypropylene, in rela-
tion to molecular motion of the polymer matrix, has also been proposed by Sohma 
et al.1078, 1570, 1571). The free radicals decay rapidly in two temperature regions; 
170 K (TA ) and 260 K (TB) (Fig. 5.13) called O!-, and .a-dispersion regions of mole-
cular motion. 
The activation energies of decay were found to be 11 kcal/mole at the lower 
temperature and 48 kcaI/mole at the higher temperature. The activation energy of 
the radical decay if of the same order as that of molecular motion in the same tem-
perature region 1254, 1645). The tacticity ofthe polymer affects the nature and the 
behavior of free radicals trapped in the polymer679, 723,1392,1664). Takayanagi et 
aI. 1270) suggested that free radicals formed by 'Y-irradiation of isotactic polypropyl-
ene are preferentially trapped in the intermediate disordered region of the crystal-
line texture. 
5.1.1.5. Radical Pairs in 'Y-Irradiated Polyolefines 
The formation of radical pairs in 'Y-irradiated polymers has been reported in several 
papers728-730, 732, 823, 851, 923, 1028-1030,2421). The radical pairs are detected as 
the ESR signal due to AMs = 2 transitions and the spectra are shown in Figures 5.14 
and 5.15. 
The radical pairs can be classified into two groups: 
1. Those formed between two adjacent molecules. 
2. Those formed in a single molecule.

Fig. 5.15. ~MS = 1 and ~MS = 2 spectra of 
-y-irradiated polypropylene at 77 K 1029) 
The two radicals, e.g. in polyethylene (5.20) 
(5.20) 
are produced with specific distance and orientation in the crystalline units. They are 
reported to be separated by a distance of S-1O A (e.g. for polyethylene -S.3 A)923). 
On the other hand, Grinberg et al. 823) have suggested that radical pairs in polyethylene 
are formed from randomly distributed radicals. 
The two unpaired electrons of a radical pair are coupled through exchange inter-
action to form a triplet state. The ESR spectrum of a radical pair has the characteristic 
of a triplet. For the aMs = 1 transition it shows the zero-field splitting due to mag-
netic interaction of the two unpaired spins. It also gives the weak signal at g = 4 due 
to the forbidden transition aMs = 2, which is allowed by the mixing of the state 
Ms = 0 and Ms = ± 1. For both transitions aMs = 1 and aMs = 2, the hyperfine 
separations of the ESR spectra of the radical pairs are approximately half of those 
observed for isolated radicals. The spectrum due to the aMs = 2 transition does not 
show the zero-field splitting. The aMs = 2 transition is commonly measured with a 
103 -1 04 times higher gain than in the case of the aMs = 1 transition. 
The aMs = 2 spectra of polyethylene are well-resolved (Fig. S .14), while 
aMs = 2 spectra for polypropylene have similar structure but are poorly resolved 
(Fig. S .IS). The average hyperfine separations of the aMs = 2 spectra of polyethyl-
ene and polypropylene are 16 and IS G, respectivelyl029). 
The aMs = 1 spectra of radical pairs in polymers have not been clearly observed. 
The failure to observe the aMs = 1 spectra in polymers has been interpreted as being 
due to the lack of a specific distance between the two radicals, resulting from the 
complicated structure of the macromolecules. It was possible to measure the aMs = 1 
spectra (Fig. S .16) of a vacuum-irradiated polyethylene sample which was drawn to 
1000% of its initial length 728,730). When the magnetic field was parallel to the draw

direction or to the chain axis of polyethylene, well-resolved multiples consisting of 
eleven lines were observed on both sides ofthe main sextet spectrum (5.16b). 
The sextet is assigned to the isolated alkyl radicals (5.3). The separation between 
the two outer multiplets is 371 G and the hyperfine splittings of each multiplet are 
16 G, amounting to just half of the value (32 G) of the main sextet. When the mag-
netic field is perpendicular to the draw direction, the shape and the position of the 
outer spectra change considerably, and the hyperfine structure disappears (5.16d). 
The change of the main spectrum from six lines to ten lines has been well explained 
as being due to the change of H(l! coupling of the alkyl radicals 11 37). The LlMs = 2 
spectrum of drawn polyethylene is shown in Figure 5.17. 
When the magnetic field is parallel to the chain axis, the hyperfine splitting is in 
this case 16 G. Both LlMs = 2 and LlMs = 1 spectra are thermally unstable and when 
the sample is annealed at elevated temperature they decay Simultaneously 
(Fig. 5.18)729,732,1030,1338). 
For small molecules, radical pairs are only formed in single crystals. This indi-
cates that there might be a preference for crystalline structure. For polymers, how-
ever, the formation of radical pairs is not a particular phenomenon occurring in the 
191

cals is not well elucidated. There are two hypotheses: 
1. Hydrogen-free radical produced in the dissociation of C-H bond may react 
with the adjacent molecule producing a second radical. This may result in the pair-
wise formation of radicals between the two adjacent moleculesI030):

(5.27) 
This mechanism refers to the stereospecific formation of paired radicals found 
in single crystals, and it is rather difficult to understand that the hydrogen radical 
may be formed at a random orientation. 
2. The radical pairs may originate from the recombination of a cation and an 
electron923,1030):

(5.28) 
A similar mechanism, where the charge neutralization reaction of an anion and

On the other hand, radical pairs are not believed to be ion-electron pairs, since 
the ~Ms = 2 signal cannot be bleached out by illumination with visible light, as ob-
served for trapped electrons. Therefore, the mechanism for the pairwise radical trap-
ping is still open to discussion. No reasonable explanation of the stereospecific forma-
tion of the paired radicals is as yet proposed. 
5.1.1.6. Poly-1-butene 
Irradiation of poly-I-butene with ionizing radiation at 77 K gives an ESR spectrum,

observed, which was not assigned to a specific radical structure. The octet was inter-
preted as arising from an allylic radical (5.22):

5. ESR Study of Degradation Processes in Polymers

The hyperfine splitting constants (20 G and 7 G) found for radical (5.22) agree 
well with the splitting constants found for the allylic radical in polyethylene (5.4). 
The sextet spectrum observed at 77 K has been attributed to radicals (5.3) and/or 
(5.13) which might be formed by abstraction of ethyl side groups or by C-C bond 
scission in the side chain, respectively. 
The quartet spectrum observed for amorphous samples979) at temperatures 
higher than 203 K may be due to the rearrangement of radical (5.13) to radical (5.23):

5.1.1.7. Polyisobutylene 
ESR study of polyisobutylene has been carried out by several authors373, 1392, 1798, 
2169,2170,2304,2307,2491). Irradiation of polyisobutylene with high energy radiation 
at 77 K gives a spectrum showing a broad doublet with a hyperfine splitting constant 
of 20 G. This spectrum is attributed to free radicals of the type (5.26):

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers

plex spectrum was recorded2169, 2170) containing seven basic lines with some addi· 
tional weak: lines. This spectrum is reversibly converted to the initial doublet on 
standing and is assigned to the radical (5.27): 
(5.27) 
As shown by Carstensen and Rllnby397, 398,403) irradiation of polyisobutylene 
with UV.light gives completely different spectra (Fig_ 5.20).

due to three different radicals, all of which are stable at 77 K. One of these radicals 
(5.12) is the counterpart of the methyl radical (5.17), and the other two are the radio 
cals (5.26) and (5.28):

It has been attributed to radicals (4.31)792):

Figure 5.21 presents two spectra, one sharp for ~s = 1 and one weak and 
broad for ~Ms = 2 transition characteristic for radical pairs (see Chapter 5.1.1.5). 
The spectrum for ~s = 2 disappears rapidly when the polymer is warmed to room 
temperature and recooled to 77 K. This fact indicates a recombination of free radi-
cal pairs. 
Takayanagi et al.1272) reported that, in addition to the octet-line spectrum, odd-
number hyperfine structures (5, 7 and 9 lines) are observed at liquid nitrogen tem-
perature. By increasing the temperature to about 253 K, the octet lines split clearly 
into a doublet substructure, which, by cooling to liquid nitrogen temperature, returns 
to the original octet. The octet-line spectrum was suggested by these authors to be 
due to allylic radicals (5.32) or to the alkyl radicals in the side chain (5.33):

Under UV-irradiation at 77 K, a sharp four-line spectrum with the hyperfine 
splitting constant of 22.5 G and a broad four-line spectrum are formed322, 792,1273). 
The former spectrum is attributed to methyl radicals (5.17) which decay by second 
order reaction1273). The latter spectrum is due to the follOwing radicals (5.34) and/or

Goodhead792) has reported conversion of radical (5.33) to radical (5.34) and/or 
(5.36) under UV-irradiation. 
5.1.1.10. Trapped Electrons in Polyolefines 
Irradiation of such polyolefmes as polyethylene, polypropylene, poly-4-methyl-1-
pentene, polyisobutylene with low energy -y-irradiation at 77 K produces an addi-
tional sharp singlet in the central region of the ESR spectrum, which was attributed 
to trapped electrons8S1 , 1117-1119,2409). 
Figure 5.22 shows such type of spectrum for polyethylene (g = 2;002 ± 0.001, 
MI ""-'4 G). 
A similar spectrum, but much broader (~H ""-' 20 G), was obtained by Russian 
scientists3S, 1602). The formation of this Singlet spectrum may be explained in that 
the electron is trapped by a defect in the crystalline regions of the polymer.

ESR studies of free radicals formed in -y-irradiated cis-1 ,4-polybutadiene have been 
published by many authors644, 1218, 1283, 1291, 1363,2338). ESR spectra of amorphous 
cis-1,4-polybutadiene obtained at 77 K show a singlet-line (Fig. 5.23a). 
-y-Irradiation of crystalline cis-1 ,4-polybutadiene under the same conditions gives 
a spectrum (Fig. 5.23b) in which a septet structure appears more clearly than in 
198 

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
amorphous samples (Fig. 5.23a). The singlet is superimposed by the seven-line spec-
trum which is attributed to the allyl radical (5.37)2338). 
(5.37) 
The decay rates of the radicals were found to differ depending on the aggregation 
state of the trapping matrix. For amorphous samples ESR spectra disappeared when 
the samples were warmed up to 200 K, which is close to the glass-transition tem-
perature (T g -
198 K). 
Cis-l,4-polybutadiene, trapped in a molecular sieve and irradiated with 'Y-irradia-
tion at room temperature, gives a nearly structure-less broad singlet spectrum 
(Fig. 5.24) which is quite stable2338). 
The different decay behavior of otherwise identical radicals from different sam-
ples suggests that the decay reaction of the radicals is mainly controlled by the ag-
gregation state and the molecular motion of the trapping matrix2049• 2240). 
During 'Y-irradiation of 1,2-polybutadiene at 77 K a broad spectrum is formed 
(Fig. 5.25 a) which is identical with the spectrum of poly-l,4-butadiene presented 
in Figure 5.24.

The radical (5.39) can only be formed by crosslinking. 
Irradiation of cis-l,4-polybutadiene with UV-light at 77 K gives ESR spectra 
with some resolved hyperfine structure (Fig. 5.26)400,402). 
The spectra consist of a broad main signal with a g-value approximately equal to 
that of a free spin, and two narrow signals with a separation of 510 G. The narrow 
lines are due to hydrogen atoms formed on the surface of the quartz403). The radical 
concentration increases rapidly at the beginning of the irradiation and then levels off. 
By increasing doses the spectra become asymmetric. In Carstensen's interpretation398, 
400) the broad main signal consists of an even number of lines, of which four lines 
in the centre are observed. A six-line spectrum with about 12 G hyperfine splitting 
constant is suggested from the allyl radical (5.37). The radical concentration decreases 
by heating the sample to temperatures just below the glass-transition temperature 
(Tg). Above Tg the ESR signal changes to a weak singlet. This Singlet has been at-
tributed to polyenyl radicals (5.40): 
(5.40) 
There is also a report on the ESR study of free radicals formed during the thermal 
degradation of polydienes2199). 
5.1.2.2. Polyisoprene 
Irradiation of cis-l,4-polyisoprene (natural rubber) with -y-rays at 77 K gives a sinld.et 
spectrum with no resolved hyperfine structure321, 1290, 1368, 1640, 1641,2304,2307)

When the resolution enhancement technique is applied to this broad spectrum, 
a hidden multiplet is revealed (Fig. 5.28)1368). 
The analysis of the spectrum shows that its main component can be a septet, in 
which the outermost and weakest peaks are masked with noise. The separation of 
the septet lines is 13 G and this value is nearly equal to the separation of multiplets 
due to an allyl radical (5.41):

Katzer und Heusinger1092) obtained ESR spectra of 'Y-irradiated polyisoprene 
which had a different hyperfine structure depending on the radiation dose (Fig. 5.29). 
At lower doses they obtained a quintet-line spectrum with a hyperfine splitting 
constant of 23.5 G which was assigned to the alkyl radical (5.44)1092. 2515):

At higher doses a septet-line spectrum with a hyperfine splitting constant of 
15 G is formed and assigned to radicals (5.41). 
When trans-l ,4-polyisoprene is irradiated in vacuum at ambient temperatures 
ESR spectra with some resolution are observedI283). 
Only a few ESR studies have been reported on the formation of free radicals in 
polyisoprene irradiated with UV_Iight398• 399.402.1126.1473). The observed spectra 
have similar hyperfme structures for cis- and trans-l,4-polyisoprene399). The signals 
are also similar in shape to those observed for cis-l,4-polybutadiene. Some differences 
were however observed: 1) The intensity ratio between the central lines of the spec-
trum is higher for polybutadiene than for polyisoprene, 2) The total width of the 
signal is larger for polyisoprene than for polybutadiene. The spectrum of UV-irra-
diated polyisoprene consists of eight lines with a hyperfme separation of 12 G 
and is attributed to the radicals (5.42) and (5.43). By heating to temperatures 
above T g the spectra change to a singlet, which was assigned to polyenyl radi-
cals (5.45):

who used UV-light at 77 K for the irradiation. The observed spectrum was a singlet 
without any trace of hyperfine structure. It is, therefore, concluded that no methyl 
radicals are formed. The second derivative ESR spectrum is an octet-line spectrum

5.1.3. Poly(methyl acrylate) and Poly(methyl methacrylate) 
The ESR spectra of radicals trapped in 'Y-irradiated poly(acrylic acid) have been 
examined by a few authorsl4, 464,1672,1993). 
During the past two decades, the ESR spectra of irradiated poly(methyl acrylate) 
and poly(methyl methacrylate) have been an interesting subject for a number of 
workersl3, 54,97, 98, 134, 137, 145,352-355, 373,387,441,507,508,696,736,740,763, 
764,845,882,1006,1033,1035,1131,1206,1207,1313, 1344, 1425, 1466,1471, 1484, 1640, 
1642,1645,1672,1681, 1682, 1916,2050,2054,2118,2123,2125,2191,2215,2304,2339,2363, 
2428, 2459, 2464) 
Photo-irradiated poly(methyl methacrylate) samples have only been studied by 
a few authors using ESR354, 441,1091,1465,1466,2428). Russian scientists83) have 
also studied the formation of paramagnetic centers in poly(methyl methacrylate) 
exposed to the action of laser radiation. 
ESR spectra of poly(methyl acrylate) and poly(methyl methacrylate) irradiated 
with ionizing radiation or with ultraviolet-radiation are similar, and for that reason 
they are discussed together. Both polymers give a nine-line spectrum which consists 
of an intense five-line and a weak four-line componentl37, 354, 387,422,441,845,1035, 
1131,1206,1207,1466,1471,1480,1672,1685, 1682, 2050,2054,2123,2125,2171,2339,2428) 
This nine-line spectrum (Fig. 5.30) is attributed to radicals (5.54) and (5.55):

sion383, 1754). Many investigators have tried to identify the radicals from which the

nine-line spectrum originates. The line width of the hyperfine components in this 
spectrum is well interpreted as being due to line-broadening caused by hindered oscil-
lation of the methyl group around the Ca-C{3 bond 1035,2050,2054,2125) (Fig. 5.31). 
Several authors1465, 1672,2054,2339) observed that the nine-line spectrum is pro-
duced only when excess monomer is present (5.30b). 
Hajimoto et al. 845) reported that a commercial poly(methyl methacrylate) sample, 
irradiated with electrons at 77 K, shows, at the same temperature, a spectrum con-
sisting of seven lines. Poly(methyl methacrylate) free from monomer gives spectra 
with the same overall splitting as commercial samples, but the spectra are more com-
plicated in shape and vary with the irradiation dose. At about 313 K (below the glass 
transition Tg - 363 K) radical (5.55) decays according to second-order kinetics with 
an activation energy of about 30 kcal/mol845, 1645, 2464). Tino and SZQCS2191) in-
vestigated the effect of pressure on the ESR spectra of radical (5.55). They con-
cluded that the formation of secondary chain radicals of the type (5.56) was:

and also of allyl and polyene radicals. Davis508) and Szocs2104-2106, 2108, 2111) 
established that the decay rate oUree radicals is sensitive to pressure. 
The interpretation of ESR spectra of irradiated poly(methyl methacrylate) at 
4-6 K is not completely solved1033, 1681,2054). Such a spectrum is shown in 
Figure 5.32. 
Fig. 5.32. ESR spectrum of poly (methyl methacrylate) -y-irradi-
ated at 6 K1033) 
Many possible interpretations may be applied to this well-resolved multiplet at 
6 K, considering several steric conformations of the protons in both the methylene 
and the methyl groups (Fig. 5.33). 
Iwasaki et al. 1033) concluded that this type of spectrum cannot be interpreted 
by a static mixture of a number of conformations. There is probably a non-classical 
quantum mechanical "tunneling" of the methyl groups in a poly(methyl methacrylate) 
radical. 
Other radicals trapped at 77 K after irradiation are probably CH300C· or HOOC' 
which give singlet spectra, OHC' (doublet spectrum) and 'CH3 (quartet spectrum), 
with splitting of the latter two of 130 G and 23 G respectively763, 845, 1091}.

ESR spectroscopy has also been applied to studies of photo degradation of 
poly(methyl methacrylate) sensitized by FeCl3 1469, 1705), studies of trapped ions 
from additives in poly(methyl methacrylate) and the role of energy migration in 
this polymer248, 249, 507, 2419\ and to studies of the following polymers: poly(methyl 
acrylate)924), poly(glycol methacrylate)2118, 2110, 2492) and copolymers of methyl 
methacrylate and styrene1314, 2419) and methyl methacrylate and maleic anhy-
dride2188,2189). 
5.1.4. Polystyrenes 
When polystyrene is exposed to ionizing radiation at 77 K, free radicals are formed 
which can be recorded by ESR spectroscopy14, 373, 682, 698, 702-704, 869,1001,1914, 
2096,2304,2307,2358,2420). The observed triplet-line spectrum (Fig. 5.34) has been 
assigned to free radicals (5.57): 
(5.57) 
Verma and Peterlin2358) concluded that the 6-methylene protons in radical 
(5.57) are nonequivalent. They report that, in the spectrum shown in Figure 5.34, 
each component of the main triplet with hyperfine splitting constant 20 G is further 
split into another triplet with hyperfine splitting constant 5 G. The main triplet is 
due to one set of two f3-protons which interact more strongly with the unpaired elec-
tron than the other two B-protons. The observed nonequivalence of B-protons in 
radical (5.57) is attributed to a restricted rotation at the Ca-C(J bond. As it was 
shown earlier, the hyperfine coupling constant (~H(J) (5.1) varies with a cos2e. 
Calculation made by Verma and Peterlin2358) show that the angle e1 (for the set of 
two protons giving the larger splitting of 20 G) is about 48° 39', and the angle e2 
for the other set of protons is 70° 37'. The assumption that ortho-hydrogen atoms

in the phenyl ring can influence the hyperfine splitting constant and increase it to 
the observed 35 G702) is questioned by several authorsl472, 1653,2096). On the other 
hand, it has been shown that radicals formed by 'Y-irradiation of benzene and sub-
stituted benzenes651 , 657, 704,1653,2210,2382,2369) have a large hyperfine splitting 
of the order 50 G, which is due to a cyclohexadienyl radical (5.58)658) formed by 
hydrogen addition to the benzene ring: 
+ H· --
(5.35) 
(5.58) 
Sz6cs and Placek 2112) have made an ESR study of the influence of pressure 
(1-8000 atm) on the free-radical decay in 'Y-irradiated polystyrene. They have 
pointed out the correlation between molecular motion in the relaxation region and 
the radical decay. The pressure increases the glass-transition temperature, increases 
density, and decreases the free volume of the polymer, which causes a temperature 
shift in the relaxation maxima. These parameters are related to the molecular motion 
which affects the stability of free radicals in a polystyrene matrix. 
ESR spectra of different substituted deuterated polystyrenes have been discussed 
in a few other papers 702,704,1001,2382). 
Russian scientists35, 1112, 2209) reported that, after irradiation of polystyrene at 
77 K with fast electrons, the ESR spectrum consists of a singlet superimposed on 
207 

5. ESR Study of Degradation Processes of Polymers 
the normal spectrum. The formation of this singlet-line spectrum may be attributed 
to trapped electrons in the polystyrene matrix. 
Iwasaki et al. 1029) have reported formation of radical pairs in 'Y-irradiated poly-
styrene for which ESR spectra are shown in Figure 5.35.

A broad singlet spectrum with the width of about 20 G has been found during 
UV-irradiation of polystyrene at 77 K 322, 1472, 1941). This spectrum has been attri-
buted to radical (5.57). When the sample was warmed to room temperature in the 
presence of air, the spectrum changed into an asymmetric' singlet spectrum with a 
width of about 16 G and was assigned to peroxy radicals1941). 
Fox et al.484) obtained an ESR spectrum of polystyrene in tetrahydrofurane 
glass at 77 K which had a seven-line structure and was assigned to radical (5.57) with 
two different chain conformations. Some polymer segments have a conformation 
containing three protons with hyperfrne coupling constant of 18 G and one proton 
with 54 G, while other polymer segments have a conformation with all four hyper-
frne coupling constants equal to 18 G. 
UV-irradiation of polystyrene may also cause formation of phenyl radicals1814). 
The ESR spectrum of phenyl radical obtained during UV-irradiation of benzene at 
77 K consists of six lines with a splitting constant of 6 G and with anintensity ratio 
1: 1.8: 2.6: 2.6: 1.8: 1 (Fig. 5.36)2161). 
Phenyl radicals have also been observed during electron irradiation of benzene 
at 149 K1000). 
ESR spectroscopy has also been applied to studies of the mechanism of degrada-
tion of polystyrene in the presence ofperoxides1193, 1194,2373), of photo degradation 
of brominated polystyrene 1 070), and of trapped ions from additives in polystyrene 
and the role of energy migration in this polymer949, 1712). 
Irradiation of poly(a-methylstyrene) with ionizing radiation at 77 K gives the 
ESR spectrum shown in Figure 5.37682).

tetrahydrofurane glass52, 484). 
5.1.5. Poly(vinyl chloride) and Poly(vinylidene chloride) 
The ESR study of free radicals formed in electron- and -y-irradiated poly(vinyl 
chloride) have been discussed by several authors736, 882,1057,1204,1308,2389,1463, 
1491,1640,1644,2183,2304). The typical spectrum of'Y-irradiated poly(vinyl chloride) 
at 77 K is shown in Figure 5.38. 
This septet-line spectrum with a hyperfine splitting constant of 18 G is attributed 
to allyl radical (5.59):

Lawton and Balwit 1308) suggested that the predominant radical from poly(vinyl

line spectrum was obtained after 'Y-irradiation of poly(vinyl chloride) in the dark at

suggested that 'Y-irradiated poly(vinyl chloride) in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran glass 
solution acts as an electron scavenger to produce the radicals (5.61). They proposed

Several authors901, 1560, 1641, 1888) reported that 'Y-irradiated poly(vinyl chlo-
ride) in vacuum at room temperature gives a singlet-line spectrum of 25 G peak-to-
peak width (Fig. 5.40).

This spectrum was attributed to polyene radicals (5.60). A similar singlet-line 
spectrum has been obtained during 'Y-irradiation of polyene acids86l}. 
The ENDOR spectrum of heavily irradiated (>200 Mrad) poly(vinyl chloride) 
is a singlet centered at 14.4 MHz (Fig. 5.40). 
This ENDOR spectrum provides substantial proof for the formation of polyenyl 
radical (5.60) and extensive delocalization of unpaired electrons in the radical 
(5.60)90l). 
The formation of a si!1glet-line ESR spectrum was also observed during ther-
ma1227, 882, 1364, 1365, 1666, 1680, 1989) and phot01788, 2239, 2246, 2441) degradation,

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
In Figure 5.41 single-line spectra are shown which have been obtained during 
UV-irradiation of poly(vinyl chloride) in vacuum and in presence of air. 
It has been found by Rabek and Rllnby1788, 1816) that conjugated polyene 
sequences, when present in poly(vinyl chloride), can "photosensitize" the formation 
of radicals during UV-irradiation. ESR spectra of UV "pre-irradiated" poly(vinyl 
chloride) samples containing double bonds show a much higher intensity after con-
tinued UV-irradiation (Fig. S.41). This means that the concentration of free radicals 
grows more rapidly for pre-irradiated samples (Fig. 5.42).

The decay of free radicals formed during irradiation of poly(vinyl chloride) has 
been investigated in detail by Atchinson8s, 86) and Rabek and Ranby 1788). Figure 
5.43 shows the decay curves of free radicals during warming of a UV-irradiated 
poly(vinyl chlOride) sample. 
The results obtained indicate the formation of two types of free radicals during 
UV-irradiation of poly(vinyl chloride); namely alkyl (5.61) and polyenyl (5.60) radi-
cals, which decay at different rates. Alkyl radicals disappear at a much faster rate 
than polyenyl radicals, which exist even above 323 K. 
Rabek and Ranby l786, 1787) used ESR spectroscopy for the study the role of 
commercial thermo stabilizers in photo degradation of poly(vinyl chloride).

ESR spectroscopy has also been applied to studies of the mechanism of thermal 
degradation of poly(vinyl chloride) in the presence of a second polymer843) and to 
the study of electron capture by acceptors such as anthracene, p-terphenyl, p-benzo-
quinone, and chloranil during the radiolysis of poly(vinyl chloride)1205, 2332, 2449). 
Hay882) and Fukuda 736) presented ESR spectra of poly(vinylidene chloride) 
irradiated with 'Y-rays at 77 K, and spectra obtained during thermal degradation of 
polymer samples. In the latter case a broad singlet spectrum was obtained and attri-
buted to polyene radical. A similar ESR spectrum was observed during UV-irradiation 
of poly(vinylidene chloride)1677). 
5.1.6. Fluorinated polymers 
ESR spectra of irradiated poly(tetrafluoroethylene) were studied by several workers14, 
38,58,62,236,450,699,736,889,1025,1026,1148, 1317, 1327-1329, 1353, 1432, 1433, 1478, 
1639-1640,1642, 1685,1840,1915,2006,2147-2150,2152,2153,2160,2216,2304-2307, 
2329,2375). Ionizing radiation of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) produces free radicals 
which are extremely resistant to heat (up to 523 K). Figure 5.44 shows ESR spectra 
obtained during electron irradiation of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) in vacuum at 77 K 
and 300K. 
This spectrum contains two components. One is a doublet of quintets with the 
hyperfme splitting constant 87 G and 32 G and is attributed to radicals (5.62)2147-
2149,2304). The other is a three-line spectrum assigned to radical (5.63)2216).

The triplet decays on heating to 403 K. Milinchuk et al. 1148) and Siegel and 
Hedgpeth2006) suggested that the triplet in the centre is only a part of the main 
spectrum and that its wing peaks are due to the hyperfine anisotropy of a-fluorine 
coupling. These wing peaks are characteristic for radicals having a-fluorine atoms1024). 
In the case of free radical (5.63), a change of spectrum interpreted by the mole-
cular motion around chain axis (Fig. 5.45)was observed1026, 2216). 
The geometrical structure of free radical (5.63) is determined from the hyper-
f'me structure measured at 77 K and at room temperature. The principal values of 
the hyperfine tensor, all and a.l> are 225 G and 17 G at 77 K and 110 G and 74 G at 
room temperature. The direction of all is about 45° from the molecular chain axis 
at 77 K and parallel to the chain axis at room temperature (Fig. 5.46).

A few ESR studies are also reported for other fluorine-containing polymers, such 
as: poly(vinylfluoride) and poly(vinylidene fluoride)1932, 1933,2155), copolymer of 
tetrafluoroethylene with ethylene273), copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene with hexa-

copolymer ofhexafluoropropylene and vinylidene fluoride699), polY(Q,~,~trifluoro­

ESR study of the conversion of free radicals in different fluorocarbon polymers 
under light irradiation has also been made1214, 1217). 
Polyenyl radicals, stable at room temperature, were trapped in irradiated poly-
(vinyl fluoride) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) and detected by ESR spectroscopy901, 
2155) (Fig. 5.47).

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
The narrow matrix width of the ENDOR lines strongly supports the polyenyl 
character of radicals obtained during 'Y-irradiation of these polymers. 
Free radicals formed during the fluorination of polymers were also investigated 
by ESR spectroscopy701). 
5.1.7. Poly(vinyl acetate) 
ESR spectra of free radicals generated in poly( vinyl acetate) by 'Y-radiation have been 
described by a few authors14, 1640,2114). The triplet-line spectrum (Fig. 5.49) was 
assigned to the free radical (5.64) or (5.65)2114):

5. ESR Study of Degradation Processes of Polymers 
This type of radical (5.66) is more sensitive to the stabilizing effect of pressure 
than radical (5.64). 
When poly(vinyl acetate) is irradiated with UV-light at 77 K (Fig. 5.51), a sharp 
quartet with a hyperfine splitting constant of about 23 G due to methyl radical 
(5.67) is observed, and a triplet-line spectrum tentatively assigned to free radicals 
(5.65)1473, 2251).

After subsequent treatment at 195 K the triplet-line spectrum becomes pre-
dominant. Tsuji2251) suggested that this spectrum was composed oftwo kinds of 
spectra; a triplet and a singlet. These spectra were attributed to free radicals (5.65)

5.1.8. Poly(vinyl alcohol) 
After 'Y-irradiation of poly(vinyl alcohol) at 77 K, the sample becomes purple-colored. 
The ESR spectrum obtained is shown in Figure 5.52a874). 
Illumination with visible light bleaches the color, leaving a spectrum as shown 
in Figure 5.52b. After photobleaching the spectrum is a quintet with a hyperfine 
splitting constant of 10 ± 2 G, and its intensity incerases. Subsequent warming to 
room temperature produces a new spectrum, which is a triplet with a hyperfine 
splitting constant of 32 ± 2 G (Fig. 5.52c). The same spectrum was obtained when 
poly(vinyl alcohol) films were irradiated at room temperature874, 1632). The radical 
produced at 77 K is probably the precursor of the stable radical produced at room 
temperature. The observed quintet-line spectrum has been attributed to radicals 
(5.69):

ance of the color after illumination with visible light has been interpreted in terms 
of photo detachment of electrons from traps. 
During photo-irradiation of poly(vinyl alcohol) three radicals, a singlet, a triplet, 
and a quartet have been observed by ESR spectroscopy1636).

5.1.10. Polyvinylpyridines 
Interpretation of ESR spectra of 'Y-irradiated po1yvinylpyridines is difficult. For this 
reason it is necessary to present in few words the result obtained for 'Y-irradiated 
pyridine in crystalline state or in organic rnatrices257, 413, 414, 506,1955,2288,2294, 
2296,2297). Three kinds of spectra are observed in irradiated po1ycrystalline pyridine 
at 77 K2288): 
1. A triplet spectrum with a coupling constant of about 30 G, observed at 77 K, 
which decays at about 173 K (I) 
2. An eight-line spectrum with a coupling constant of about 12 G which is ob-
served at 183 K decays at 208 K (II) 
3. An apparent singlet which decays at about 223 K (III) 
When a mixture of pyridine and alcohol is 'Y-irradiated, a ten-line spectrum with 
coupling constant of 6 G (IV) is observed at about 130 K, after the alcohol free radi-
cals disappear414, 506). Assignments of the above mentioned spectra are presented 
in Table 5.3. (Free radicals I-IV.) 
'Y-irradiation at 77 K of poly-2-vinylpyridine and poly-4-vinylpyridine gives 
triplet-line spectra with a predominant central line (Fig. 5.54)866, 1850). 
These spectra appear to be formed by the superposition of the signals of two 
radicals. The side peaks disappear either on UV-irradiation or on warming to 180 K 
with a decrease in the overall concentration of radicals. The spectra of the remaining

Some authors866• 1850) consider the possible formation, under 'Y-irradiation, of 
azabenzyl, pyridyl, pyridinyl or azacyclohexadienyl radicals. 
Pyridinyl-free radicals (5. 74) are derived from polyvinylpyridines by addition 
of hydrogen atoms to the nitrogen of the pyridine ring. These radicals can only be 
obtained by irradiation of the polymer in alcoholic glassy matrices at 77 K (Fig. 5.55).

Azacyclohexadienyl radicals (5.75) and (5. 76) are formed by 'Y-irradiated of 
polyvinylpyridines at 77 K in acid medium necessary to protonate the pyridine ring. 
The observed ESR spectrum is a triplet-line if the matrix is protonated, and a doublet-
line in the case of deuterated matrix (Fig. 5.56). 
The structure of 2-azacyclohexadienyl (5. 75) and 4-azacyclohexadienyl (5. 76)

Free radicals (5. 75) and (5. 76) are not selectively formed by 'Y-irradiation of 
poly-2-vinylpyridine and poly-4-vinylpyridine. It cannot be excluded, however, that 
they are formed together with other radicals, since the recorded spectra seem to con-
tain several superimposed signals.

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
Sohma et al. 1 533, 2049} studied the molecular motion of the end radical (5. 79) 
during the warming of the sample. 
When the radiation dose is very small, an asymmetric doublet spectrum was ob-
served at room temperature (Fig. 5.58c) and was found to be caused by superposi-
tion of the doublet and the singlet spectrum. The singlet has been assigned to the 
free radical {5.80)2266} and the doublet spectrum to free radical {5.81)2469}: 
-O-c=O 
(5.80) 
-O-CH-O-
(5.81) 
Tsuji et al.2266} reported a doublet spectrum with a separation of about 86 G 
and assigned to free radicals (5.82), and another doublet spectrum with separation 
of 125 G due to formyl radicals (5.83): 
HO-C=O 
(5.82) 
H-C=O 
(5.83) 
Yoshida and Ranby2469} have found that the doublet and triplet spectra of 
polyoxymethylene show anisotropy, while the singlet spectrum does not. The doublet 
asymmetric spectrum is considered to be related to an anisotropic hyperfine coupling 
tensor and an anisotropic g-value. The chain conformation corresponds to that of 
crystalline polyoxymethylene. 
ESR studies of polyoxymethylene photolyzed by tN-light show that the same 
types of free radicals are formed as those with 'Y-irradiation 741,742,976, 209l}.

5.1.12.3. Poly-3,3-bis(chloromethyl)oxethane 
A few studies have been made on ESR spectra of poly-3,3-bis( chloromethyl)oxethane 
irradiated with ionizing radiation460, 2250, 2258, 2259) and UV_light2256, 2276,2277). 
A three-line spectrum with a hyperfme splitting constant of about 21 G, and a 
two-line spectrum with a hyperfine splitting constant of about 18 G, were observed 
after irradiation with an electron beam in vacuum (Fig. 5.60)2256).

These spectra were attributed to free radicals (5.84) and (5.85), respectively:

On the other hand, a three-line spectrum with a hyperfine splitting constant of 
about 20 G and an asymmetric singlet spectrum were observed after UV-irradiation 
in vacuum (Fig. 5.61). These spectra were assigned to free radicals (5.84) and (5. 78).

poly(2,6-dirnethyl-l ,4-phenyleneoxide) have been interpreted as being due to the 
formation ofa dimethylphenoxy radical (5.86):

poly(2 ,6~imethyl-l ,4-phenyleneoxide) in 
benzene solution at room temperature2280) 
The ESR spectrum of the radical (5.86) is shown in Figure 5.62. 
Irradiation of the sample with UV-light at room temperature causes an increase 
of the ESR spectral intensity. This eight-line spectrum shows an effective isotropic 
hyperfine coupling of 5.7 G to the two nearly equivalent methyl groups and aniso-
tropic g-values (gl = 2.002 and gu = 2.006)2128). 
Poly(2,6-dirnethyl-l,4-phenyleneoxide) in benzene solution, UV-irradiated at 
room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere, gives a well-resolved spectrum 
(Fig. 5.63)2128,2279,2280). 
The hyperfine splitting constants are acH3(I) = 5.13 H, aCH3(II) = 6.20 G and 
aH(meta) = 1,14 G983, 2128, 2280) and the spectrum (Fig. 5.63) is attributed to radi-
cal (5.86). The different values obtained for the hyperfme splitting constant indicate 
that the methyl groups are not magnetically. equivalent at room temperature and this

fact is due to hindered rotation around the C-O bond228o, 2286). When the tempera-
ture for the measurements was higher, the ESR spectra changed (Fig. 5.64). 
The results derived from the spectrum obtained at 423 K show that both methyl 
groups become equivalent at this temperature. The hyperfme splitting constants are 
aCH3 = 5.63 G and aH(meta) = 1.23 G. These results indicate that free rotation about 
the C-O bond occur at temperatures ~423 K. A detailed mechanism of radical 
(5.86) formation and possible reactions of the phenoxy radicals (5.86) have been 
proposed by Tsuji et a1.2279, 2299). 
5.1.12.5. Polyglycols 
Poly(propylene glycols) give, under ionizing irradiation, mainly seven-line ESR 
spectra well-resolved at 140 to 180 K with a 15.5 G hyperfine splitting constant218 1}. 
These spectra have been attributed to radical (5.87): 
(5.87) 
Poly(ethylene glycols) irradiated with UV-light in aqueous solution at 77 K and 
at room temperature give ESR spectra due to formyl radicals (5.83) and radicals 
(5.88)1605).

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
It has been shown that formyl radicals have an important role in the photo-
degradation of poly(ethylene glycol). 
5.1.13. Polycarbonates 
A few ESR studies of organic carbonates and polycarbonates have been reported5n, 
828,852,853,1400,1451) 
Poly(bisphenol-A carbonate) has been investigated in detail by ESR spectroscopy 
by Hama et al. 852, 853) and by Lyons et al. 1400). ESR spectra of 'Y-irradiated poly-
carbonates are composed of a sharp singlet, some broad singlets, and a weak: signal 
with hyperfine structure. These spectra were assigned to trapped electrons (the sharp 
singlet), positive radical ions, phenoxy radicals, phenyl radicals (the broad singlets), 
and to radical (5.89)853). 
(5.89) 
ESR spectra obtained from diaryl carbonates (diphenyl, di-p-tolyl, phenyl-p-
tolyl and bis-diphenyl-propyl carbonates) 'Y-irradiated at 77 K show that one of the 
major results of irradiation is the pairwise trapping of phenoxy radicals 1451). 
The ESR spectrum of polycarbonates irradiated with UV-light at 77 K was a 
singlet with the width 16 G and g-factor 2.0045. This spectrum was attributed to 
three kinds offree radicals: phenoxy, phenyl, and polyene radicals853). Lyons et 
al.1400) observed, besides the singlet spectrum assigned mainly to phenoxy radicals, 
two weak peaks separated by about 150 G, which were attributed to radical pairs. 
ESR studies of photo transformation of poly(bisphenol-A carbonate) at 77 K 
sensitized by FeCl3512, 2214) or benzoyl peroxide 1708) have also been published. 
5.1.14. Polyesters 
5.1.14.1. Poly(/3-propiolactone) 
Poly(i3-propiolactone) electron-irradiated in vacuum at 77 K has an ESR spectrum 
(Fig. 5.65) assigned to radical (5.90)1614, 1647): 
-CH2-CH-CO-O-
(5.90) 
The spectrum shows an anisotropy in the yz plane (z is the chain direction), 
whereas in the xy plane it is nearly the same at all angular positions. The main four-
line spectrum at the angle <I> = 0° changes to sextet at <I> = 90° , where <I> is the rota-
tion angle measured at the z axis. The feature of the spectral change suggests that 
this is a double-triplet spectrum and that the doublet splitting changes with the angle, 
while .the triplet remains almost unchanged.

tained at low temperatures, is relatively short-lived and increases in signal intensity 
with increasing number (m, n) of methylene groups in the polymer chains. A second 
well-resolved five-line spectrum is stable even at room temperature. Figure 5.66 shows 
the ESR spectra of 1'-irradiated 2.8 polymer. 
The change of ESR spectra with increasing temperature is interpreted as a result 
of changing conformation of the polymer radicals.

terephthalate) (@Mylar fIlm) gives well-resolved six-line and eight-line structures 
(Fig. 5.67b)57, 385). 
This spectrum was assigned to two major radicals (5.92) and (5.93):

At that temperature radical (5.92) decaysI847). 
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) irradiated with UV-light at room temperature gives 
a poorly resolved asymmetric five-line spectrumI419), which is attributed to radical 
(5.93) and free radical (5.94) (a weak central line): 
(5.94) 
The radical (5.92), which is produced by ionizing radiation, decayed when ex-
posed to UV radiation. 
Free radical conversion in poly( ethylene terephthalate) by photoinduced post-
irradiation has been studied by Campbell and Tumer390).

Two types of radicals in 'Y-irradiated poly( ethylene-2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylate)

thalene ring (5.96)1848):

The relative concentrations of the two radicals in bulk polymer powder or pressed

5.1.15. Polyamides 
ESR spectra of 'Y-irradiated polyarnides have been studied by several authors179, 312, 
313,357,373,504,680,803,811,1089,1135,1379,1474, 1475, 1477, 1480,1640, 1868, 1952, 
1954,1992,2117,2162,2192,2336,2372). The ESR spectra observed for different poly-
arnides (Fig. 5.68) were attributed to free radicals (5.97): 
-CO-NH-CH-CH2-
(5.97) 
Fig. 5.68. ESR spectra of 'Y-irradiated at 77 K uniaxially 
oriented polyamides: a. nylon 610, b. nylon 66, c. ny-
lon 57 and d. nylon 6 1089) 
It has been shown 2192) that a change in orientation of the polyamide sample 
affects the ESR spectrum by the anisotropy of the a-proton of radical (5.97). SZQCZ 
et al. 2117) have reported that ESR spectra of polyarnides can be assigned to three 
radicals, which can be determined by measurements over a wide range of pressures 
(1-16000 atm) and temperatures (353-393 K). While the spectrum of radical (5.97) 
is predominant in the overall spectrum at room temperature, other components 
230 

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation oi Polymers 
distinctly appear at higher temperatures. At 393 K and atmospheric pressure a triplet 
spectrum was obtained and assigned to free radicals (5.98). The third component 
was the spectrum of allyl radicals (5.99) which appeared especially after treating the 
samples at elevated temperatures and high pressures: 
-CH2 -CH-CH=CH-CO-NH-
(5.99) 
It has been shown that polypropiolamide has an ESR spectrum associated with 
a conjugated bond system1464). Russian scientists224) have reported ESR studies of 
polyamides irradiated with fast neutrons. Four-line spectra have been obtained for 
polycaprolactam and six-line spectra for nylon 6 and nylon 68. 
UV-irradiation of nylon 6 at 77 K gives a two-component spectrum (Fig. 5.69)

Raftkovet al.1803) observed a singlet-line spectrum and a triplet-line spectrum 
after UV-irradiation of polycaproamide at.77 K. When the sample was warmed, the 
triplet spectrum changed Into a quintet-line spectrum which was attributed to the 
free radical (5.102): 
-CH2-CH2 
(5.102) 
On further warming the quintet-line spectrum changed to a singlet-line spectrum, 
which was assigned to free radicals produced by elimination of a hydrogen atom in 
a-position to the NH group. 
Pariskii et al. 1 706, 1707) also studied the formation and the phototransformation 
of macroradicals in polycaprolactam exposed to the action of light in the presence 
of FeCI3 . 
An ESR study of the fading of dyed nylon has recently been published466).

5. ESR Study of Degradation Processes in Polymers 
5.1.16. Polyurethanes 
ESR studies of polyurethanes were mainly made by Russian scientists184, 199, 1415, 
2371). Beachel and Changl76) studied the photodegradation of urethane model 
systems. They obtained ESR spectra for the UV-irradiated ethyl-N-ethylcarbamate, 
but not for ethylphenylcarbamate. The radical from ethyl-N-ethylcarbamate was 
identified as radical (5.103). 
(5.103) 
It was concluded that the degradation may be followed by radical attack on the 
a-hydrogen and by the formation of the hydroperoxide. 
The ESR study of polyurethanes, based on polyester diol-p,p'-diphenylmethane-
diisocyanate and ethylphenylcarbamate irradiated with UV-light under vacuum, 
shows the formation of singlet spectra at 77 K (Fig. 5.70) which change to four-line 
spectra and finally to singlet again on warrningI673).

Berlin et al. 184, 199) reported that on UV-irradiation of aromatic polyurethanes 
a singlet-line spectrum is obtained, which is attributed to delocalized electrons in 
the conjugated double bonds. They also reported that ESR spectra result from 
secondary reactions of free radicals. 
5.1.17. Sulphur-Containing Polymers 
During the 'Y-irradiation of poly( ethylene sulphide )2478) and poly(propylene sul-
phide)1821) with thiol and thioether end groups the following free radicals (5.104-
5.106) have been identified by ESR spectroscopy:

The ESR spectra ofpoly(butene-l-sulphone)115, 116, 319), poly(hexene-l-
sulphone)319), and aromatic polysulphone (prepared from 2,2'-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) 
propane and 4,4'-dichlorophenyl sulphone)1399) have been reported. Poly(vinyl 
mercaptan) and its copolymer with vinylpyrrolidone were extensively studied by 
ESR spectroscopy by M6nig et al. 1522, 1524). 'Y-Irradiation of these polymers at room 
temperature give spectra which are characteristic for randomly oriented neutral 
sulphur radicals of the type (5.106). 
'Y-Irradiation of copolymers of ethoxyvinylthiomethane and vinylpyrrolidone 
at 77 K gives a five-line spectrum with an asytnmetric signal1523). This spectrum was 
attributed to a free radical identical with the pyrrolidone radical (five lines) and to a 
radical cation localized at the sulphur atom (asymmetric line).(5.107): 
.+ 
R-S-R 
(5.107) 
This kind of free radical consists of a positive hole trapped in the sulphur non-
bonding orbital. The existence of sulphur radical cations (5.107) was established by 
measuring ESR spectra of 'Y-irradiated sulphur-containing compounds with thioether 
groups261, 379, 1183, 1184,2400). 
After 'Y-irradiation at 77 K of poly[ 1-(tert-butoxy carbonylthio )ethylene] and 
its copolymer with vinylpyrrolidone, tert-butyl radicals and other species were 
detected by ESR spectroscopy1525). One of them is the sulphur radical cation (5.107) 
Another suggestion is that electrons formed during 'Y-irradiation can be captured by 
the carboxyl group, giving a molecular anion which could be responsible for the 
central singlet line. 
5.1.18. Polysiloxanes 
Few papers have been published on the ESR study of free radicals in polysiloxanes 
produced by ionizing radiation47, 321,1216,1283,1285,1286,1671,2304,2307,2512). 
Electron irradiation gives a well-resolved ESR spectrum (Fig. 5.71), which con-
sists of two groups of lines: a quartet with the hyperfme splitting constant 23 G and 
a triplet with the hyperfine splitting constant 20 G307). 
The four-line spectrum was assigned to methyl radicals (5.108) and the three-
line spectrum to free radicals (5.109):

Poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymer is very stable towards UV-light irradiation. Free 
radicals can be observed only in sensitized photo degradation, e.g. by naphthalene2005) 
and triphenylamine2511). Poly(phenylmethylsiloxane) is less stable towards UV-
irradiation than poly( dimethylsiloxane). ESR studies of free radicals formed during 
photodegradation of poly(phenylmethylsiloxane) have been published by Russian 
scientistsl215, 2510, 2513). 
ESR was also used for detecting the presence of anion radicals of poly(phenyl-
methylsiloxane) (5.111) formed by metal reduction and cleaving of the chain597): 
(5.111) 
The interpretation ofESR spectra of anion radicals (5.111) encountered sub-
stantial difficulties due to several factors: temperature and concentration dependen-
cies, inability to obtain good spectra caused by overlapping components, and other 
gross effects that might be expected from mUltiple reduction sites within a single 
polymer molecule.

5.1.19. Biopolymers 
The application of ESR spectroscopy for the study of free radicals in biological 
systems has been reviewed in several papers139, 181,712,804,906,1396,1417,1772, 
1966,2034,2387,2447) and monographsl~l, 231, 244, 246, 477,609,887,1595,1818,1920, 
2034,2046,2103) 
5.1.19.1. Cellulose 
The presence of free radicals in irradiated cellulose was shown in ESR studies by 
manyworkers14,28,34,77-79,169,215,216,382,551,628,630,700,779,840,1120,1121, 
1391,1406,1634,1709,1869,1979,1980,2321,2333, 2334, 2341, 2342, 2431). Reviews of 
the use of ESR in studying the structure of free radicals in cellulose and its deriva-
tives initiated by ionizing radiation, light, heat, oxidation-reduction systems, and 
mechanical action were published by Arthur68, 69, 75). The line shape and width, 
and the hyperfme splitting constants of the ESR spectra of 'Y- and UV-irradiated 
cellulose depend on type of cellulose, moisture content, temperature, frequency 
distribution and intensity of the irradiation, and the resulting spin concentration28, 
77,79,700,1741) 
On 'Y-irradiation at 77 K in vacuum a pure cotton sample yields a poorly resolved 
triplet of approximately 24-26 G hyperfme splitting constant (Fig. 5.73). 
Irradiation at 300 K in vacuum or in air causes mainly a broadening of this triplet. 
Two more satellite lines appeared and the intensity of the ESR spectrum decreased 
with a loss of resolution. 
The presence of moisture reduces the number of free radicals. Crystalline regions 
of the cellulose contained larger number of more stable (long-lived) free radicals than 
amorphous regions28). 
It has been suggested79, 169) that the triplet ESR spectrum of cellulose (pure 
cotton) is due to the equal interaction of the two hydrogen atoms at C6 with the 
unpaired electron formed by the removal of the hydrogen atom at C5.

Mercerized cellulose (obtained by soaking in aqueous 20% NaOH solution for 
·30 min at room temperature) gives, after 'Y-irradiation at 77 K, an ESR spectrum

(Fig. 5.74)454).

It was suggested that the ESR spectrum of 'Y-irradiated mercerized cotton arises 
from a superposition of two triplets due to unpaired electrons at C5 and C6 in dif-
ferent anhydroglucose units. In addition, radicals at C1 and C4 have also been postu-
lated 79, 169, 454, 1979). In view of these conclusions, as well as of the changes in the 
ESR spectra of mercerized sample irradiated at 77 K and warmed to 300 K, it may 
be inferred that one of the primary species decays faster than the other.

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
Detailed ESR studies of cellulose acetate373, 391,455,521,700,2341,2450,2451), 
furoates2017), thenoates2018), benzoylated and allyated cotton cellulose454) after 
'Y-irradiation were made. 
The ESR spectrum of irradiated cellulose acetate, obtained by acetylating cel-
lulose with acetic anhydride in the presence of glacial acetic acid, amyl acetate as 
solvent, and perchloric acid as catalyst, depends on the degree of substitution 
(Fig. 5.75)455). 
At low doses of 'Y-irradiation, a sample with degree of substitution = 0.74 gives 
a poorly resolved doublet with the hyperfine splitting constant 24 G. The resolution 
and intensity of spectra increases with the increasing of the degree of substitition. 
The observed doublet spectrum is attributed to radical (5.113) 
Rcen-CH-O-CO-CH3 
(5.113) 
The triplet is assigned to free radicals formed by dehydrogenation at the C5 
carbon of the anhydroglucose units. The quartet spectrum with a hyperfine splitting 
constant of 13 ± 2 G and a g-value of 2.0044 ± 0.004 might eventually be due to 
radicals (5.114) and (5.115): 
(5.114) 
(5.115) 
After warming the 'Y-irradiated sample to 178 K another spectrum was obtained 
and assigned to peroxy radicals resulting from the decomposition of acetyl radicals. 
ESR spectra of benzoylated cottons (obtained by reaction of pure cellulose with 
benzyl chloride in pyridine for 30 min at 338 K) are similar to those of unsubstituted 
cellulose at all conditions of irradiation (Fig. 5.76). 
The nature and intensity of ESR spectra of allylated samples (obtained by reac-
tion of pure cellulose, presoaked in NaOH, with allyl bromide in xylene) recorded 
after irradiation at 77 K in vacuum is found to depend on the degree of substitution. 
The allylated sample with the lowest degree of substitution (= 0.11) gave an almost 
equally split quintet with the hyperfine splitting constant 15 ± 1 G (Fig. 5.77 a) at 
all doses of irradiation. 
Samples with higher degree of substitition gave additional lines which showed a 
better resolution when higher doses of radiation were employed454). Warming an 
irradiated sample with the highest degree of substitution (= 1.25) produced changes 
which differed considerably from those found for samples with low degree of sub-
stitution (Fig. 5.77b). The results obtained for allylated cotton suggest the presence 
of certain new radical species which are comparatively unstable. The allyl cellulose 
unit may be represented as (5.116): 
(5.116) 
During'Y-irradiation, hydrogen atoms liberated from cellulose may saturate the 
double bond in the allyl group, yielding free radicals (5.117) and (5.118):

ESR spectroscopy has been sucessfully applied in studying the mechanism of 
radiative protection of chemically modified cellulose8o, 454, 2017, 2018). Thus, the 
protective action of benzoyl groups is parallel to the yields of radicals at all doses 
used. Substitution with allyl groups, which also gives radiative protection to cotton 
cellulose at low doses of irradiation, enhances the overall radical yield. This increase 
is due to the localization of radiation damage by the substituent groups454). This 
observation indicates that the nature of primary radicals and their intermediary reac-
tions playa significant role in the radiation degradation and the radiative protection 
of cotton cellulose. 
ESR spectra of irradiated cotton cellulose, which is interacting with anhydrous 
ammonia, have also been reported931). Most of the trapped free radicals in irradiated 
cellulose are scavenged when cellulose is immersed in anhydrous liqUid ammonia. 
This indicates that liquid ammonia penetrates the highly ordered regions of cellulose. 
A small fraction of trapped free radicals in irradiated cellulose is scavenged when 
cellulose is treated with gaseous anhydrous ammonia. 
ESR spectra of traces of copper ions in purified cotton cellulose after the treat-
ment of cotton with solutions of sodium hydroxide were recorded129, 130). Complexes 
of cupriethylenediamine with cellobiose and cellulose generate similar ESR spectra 71, 
170). The ESR spectrum of a well-defmed copper-fructose complex that contained 
sodium nitrate was recorded 1). Furthermore, ESR studies of interaction of anup.onia, 
copper, and cuprammonium with cellulose are reported 170, 929). Cupric ions dissolved

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
in solutions of strong bases, such as concentrated ammonium hydroxide, form com-
plexes with fibrous cotton cellulose. These complexes have paramagnetic resonance 
properties and generate characteristic ESR spectra. 
The characteristics of cellulose radicals produced by photo-irradiation are also 
studied using ESR spectra68- 70• 171.964.1142-1145.1566.1633.1634.1741). Durinf 
UV-irradiation of cellulose two kinds of photo-induced reactions occur1633• 1634 : 
1. The direct scission of glucosidic bonds and oxidation of the cellulose due to 
the degradation. 
2. Photosensitizing reactions depending upon the contaminants, moisture con-
tent, and various oxidized groups present in the sample. 
All spectra of UV-irradiated cellulose samples contain a single line with a line 
width of about 28 G1634). In the initial stage of irradiation this singlet is the main 
spectrum. With increasing time of irradiation, two absorption lines with a line width 
of 8 G were added to the original singlet spectrum, leading to a symmetrical three-
line spectrum with line width of 8 G, 18 G and 8 G, respectively. The resulting com-
posite ESR spectrum has a middle line with a line width of 28 G showing the 
maximum intensity (Fig. 5.78).

a. 30 min, b. 120 min. c. 180 min. Dotted lines represent 
the spectra after warming to room temperature for 2 minI 634) 
According to Arthur et al.79) free radical formation in cellulose may be expected 
at C1 , C4 or C5 through the abstraction of H or OH. In case of reaction of C1 or C4 
a single-line spectrum results, whereas the cleavage of H at C5 or of the OH group at 
C6 or H from the OH group at C6 results in three-line spectra 77). At higher tempera-
ture, only singlet and triplet spectra are detectable, whereas at low temperatures, 
such as at 77 K, two doublet spectra of formyl radicals and hydrogen atoms are also 
observed966). 
Hon 964) investigated in detail the effect of wavelength for the formation of free 
radicals in photo-irradiated cellulose. No radicals were detected by ESR recordings 
when cellulose was irradiated with light of wavelength longer than 3300-3400 A. 
239 

5. ESR Study of Degradation Processes in Polymers 
Kleinert et al. 1143, 1566) found that oxygen slightly reduces the ESR signal intensity 
of UV-irradiated cellulose, while atomic hydrogen reduces it to zero. 
Several contaminants, moisture content, and various oxidized groups influence 
shape and intensity of the ESR spectra observed700, 963,1633,1634,1828,1979,1980). 
Moisture content in the range of 5-7% significantly inhibits the radical formation. 
When the moisture content is lower or higher than in that range, the formation of 
free radicals is increased963). 
The effect of several added inorganic and organic photo sensitizers on the forma-
tion of free radicals in cellulose was investigated by ESR spectroscopy646, 965, 967, 
1633,1634,1741). Hon965) reported that cellulose during irradiation with light of 
"A> 3400 A in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, benzophenone, 
riboflavin, azobisisobutyronitrile, and metal ions such as Cr2+ and Ni2+ exhibits single-
line spectra with a line width of 16 G to 26 G. On irradiation with light of "A> 2537 A, 
most of the sensitized samples exhibit five-line spectra with different relative Signal 
intensities. Among these, samples treated with Fe3+ formed spectra with strongest 
relative signal intensities965-967). A similar ESR study was made for cellobiose513). 
Nanassy et al. 1566) describe ESR studies of the effect of lignin and various gases 
on UV-photodegradation of cellulose (Fig. 5.79). 
The ESR spectrum of lignin is a single narrow line. When lignin is present in a 
pulp, a narrowing of the ESR line for the pulp occurs and· the effect increases with 
the lignin content. Hence, it can be concluded that the strongly UV-absorbing lignin 
exhibits a screening effect, which results in a reduction of free spin concentration of 
a UV-irradiated pulp. Ranby et al.1813) studied the influence of daylight on the free 
radical concentration of lignin and wood. Virgin lignin, e.g. in conifer roots unex-
posed to light, contains practically no radicals. Most radicals are formed during UV-
irradiation and therefore are photochemically induced . 
. Virnik et al.2364-2366) observed that during UV-irradiation of graft-copolymers 
of cellulose with poly(vinyl chloride}, polyacrylonitrile, and poly(methylvinyl pyri-
dine}, a singlet-line spectrum is formed. This spectrum is attributed to free radicals 
formed from photodegraded cellulose. No free radicals from the polymers grafted to 
the cellulose substrate were observed. 
5.1.19.2. Starch 
ESR spectra of 'Y-irradiated starch samples were studied by several authors9, 14, 18, 
19, 228, 1621, 1662, 1894). Mter 'Y-irradiation of starch at 128 K a triplet-line spectrum 
with the hyper fine splitting constant of about 18 G and line width of 12-14 G was 
observed (Fig. 5.80}18). 
Mter warming the sample to room temperature a doublet with hyperfine splitting 
constant of about 15 G and line width of 10-12 G is the most intense signal. The 
triplet line spectrum is interpreted similarly, as in the case of cellulose and attributed 
to free radicals at the C6 atom. During warming of the sample radical transformation 
with the migration of radical from C6 to C5 may occur. The unpaired electron in C5 
produces the doublet-line spectrum by the hyperfine interaction with H5 (5.112).

ESR studies of other 'Y-irradiated polysaccharides such as glycogen, dextran, maltose, 
cellobiose, lactose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, galactose, arabinose, ribose, and rham-
nose were also reported467, 622, 627, 705, 785, 786, 808,1238,1969,2090,2238,2322,2326). 
Photo-induced radicals in glucose and cellobiose, model compounds of the cel-
lulose molecule, were studied by ESR spectrometryI238). Very poor formations of 
radicals in glucose, as compared to that in cellobiose, were observed. A single line 
was easily produced by the use of short wavelength light. The spectrum was attri-
buted to a radical formed at the reducing C1 position of the glucose molecule. Photo-
irradiated cellobiose shows an ESR spectrum similar to that of cellulose. 
5.1.19.4. Lignin 
Free radical content of native lignin and of humic acids isolated from the soil and 
lignite was examined by ESR877, 1563, 2071). The spin concentration measured in spin 
g-1 was as follows: 
native lignin < degraded lignin < fulvic acid < humic acid. 
The spin concentration for lignin indicates a free radical content of 5 x 1019 
spins mole-I, whereas the spin concentration for humic acid was 4 x 1022 spins 
241 

5. ESR Study of Degradation Processes in Polymers 
mole-I. ESR study suggests that the radical species are ortho- and para-semiquinone, 
which are coexistent with quinohydrone and quinone moieties. A significant increase 
in free radical concentration was observed for all samples when they were converted 
to the Na salts2071), or hydrolyzed2237). Ranby et al. 1813) reported that most lignin 
radicals are photochemically induced, e.g. by daylight. 
5.1.19.5. Wool 
The ESR spectra of 'Y-irradiated wool are dependent on the temperature at which the 
irradiation is performed226, 601, 1111). Irradiation at room temperature gives glycine, 
alanine, and cystine radicals. At 77 K a broad unresolved singlet has been reportedI717). 
Most ESR spectra obtained during UV-irradiation of wool have been attributed 
to cystyl (thiyl) radicals (RS·) formed by breaking of S-S bonds1315, 1316, 1349, 1493, 
1956-1960,2423). ESR studies of solvent- and heat-treated wool were also reported600).

where: X = OH in ribonucleic acid (RNA) and X = H in deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA). 
A polymer of a sugar phosphate forms the backbone: ribose phosphate in RNA and 
deoxyribose phosphate in DNA. The side chains consist of heterocyclic bases such 
as adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine in DNA and adenine, guanine, uracil, and 
cytosine in RNA443, 1201,2383). 
DNA, the well·known biochemical substance isolated from cell nuclei which is 
the genuine source of genetic information in living cells, is at present intensively 
studied. In 1953 Crick and Watson487) elaborated the famous model ofthe "double 
helix" for DNA structure. The DNA double helix is composed of two intertwined 
polymer strands, each containing alternating sugar and phosphate groups. A planar 
side group called a base is attached to each sugar ring. A pair-wise coupling through 
hydrogen bonds between the bases belonging to the two strands stabilizes the struc-
ture of the macromolecule to the double helix. Four different bases are present in 
DNA: adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine. Base pairing through hydrogen bonds 
takes place between adenine and thymine as one pair, and guanine and cytosine as 
the other pair. The specific sequence of the bases in a DNA chain provides the chemi-
cal basis for the genetic code, which governs the protein synthesis in the cell and thus 
is the origin of all cellular properties and activities. The destruction of a single strand 
242 

5.1. Radiation and Photo-Degradation of Polymers 
of these macromolecules through radiation may be biologically important. Irradiation 
of the DNA macromolecules in a solvent, such as water, produces direct and indirect 
effects. The direct effects are caused by absorption of 'Y-irradiation by macromole-
cules, whereas the indirect are caused by reactive radiation-induced species from the 
solvent. Both effects are probably responsible for the radiation damage of chromo-
somes carrying hereditary units in the form of DNA complexes with nuc1eoproteins. 
Primary 'Y-induced free radicals in DNA were attributed to the thymine base 
(5.120), formed by hydrogen-addition to carbon atom C6, thus breaking up the 
C5 -C6 double bond to the thymine radical (5.121)1967, 1968): 
(5.40) 
(5.120) 
(5.121) 
The ESR spectra of 'Y-irradiated DNA and their single strand components are 
generally well resolved8, 608, 615, 617, 806, 958, 815, 816, 817,1340,1541,1542,1768,1890, 
1943,1944,2019-2021,2349). An ESR spectrum obtained by 'Y-irradiation of a sample 
of salmon sperm DNA at room temperature under vacuum is shown in Figure 
5.81 a474, 617).

The outer narrow lines were attributed to thymine radical (5.121). At least two 
radical species are present in the 'Y-irradiated DNA, which differ in line-width and 
have different decay rate on thermal annealing. 
After annealing at 353 K the thymine radical spectrum (Fig. 5.81 a) disappeared, 
leaving the central line as a residual dominnat component (Fig. 5.81 b). When samples 
of DNA are irradiated at 77 K the thymine radical ESR spectrum is absent 
(Fig. 5.81 c). After annealing the sample to 210 K the eight-line spectrum identical 
to Figure 5.81 a, appears. These results show that the formation of thymine radicals 
(5.121) is not a primary result of 'Y-radiation, but depends upon a chemical change 
which is only appreciable above about 200 K. It has been suggested that the primary 
243 

5. ESR Study of Degradation Processes in Polymers 
ESR spectrum originates from an anionic base radical167, 806, 902, 918, 960,1339,1340, 
1670, 1942). 
The ESR spectra recorded with the magnetic field of the spectrometer parallel 
and perpendicular to the direction of helical axis of the sample were found to be 
composed of two major components with different line-widths610, 80S, 807). The 
difference in hyperfine structure was interpreted in terms of a mixture of an anionic 
radical of thymine (or cytosine) and cationic base radical of guanine (or cytosine). 
Computer analysis and reconstruction of ESR spectra of 'Y-irradiated DNA were 
described in papers815, 816). 
Radical formation in 'Y-irradiated DNA or their single-strand components in 
frozen aqueous matrices has been a subject of many investigations2, 8, 315, 631,919, 
1116, 1339, 1341, 1922, 1953). ESR studies of DNA in frozen aqueous solutions show 
that radicals are produced by protonation of intermediate anionic species, thymine 
anions in isomeric forms. The anions are formed by the addition of radiation-produced 
electronsI339,1341):

244 

5.3. Anionic Degradation of Vinylaromatic Polymers 
The structure of the radical anions is dependent on pH of the irradiated DNA 
solutions. In thymidine at low pH the spin is best located as being shared mainly 
between C4 and C6, giving the maximum interaction with the C6 proton (5.41). At 
high pH the spin is further shared with C2, thus reducing the spin density at C6 and 
consequently the ESR doublet splitting I 341) (5.42). Finally, in thymine at high pH, 
where the molecules are doubly ionized before irradiation (5.43), the free spin den-
sity is delocalized and the interaction with the C6 proton is at minimum, giving an 
ESR singlet or unresolved doublet of small splitting. The presence and nature of 
thymine anion radicals in DNA seems to be fully established. 
An interesting problem in the study of polynucleotides is the application of ESR 
spectroscopy for detecting light-induced free radicals in DNA-acridine complexes. It 
is generally assumed that the strong internal binding of acridines to DNA occurs via 
intercalationI352), i.e. insertion of the planar dye molecules between successive base 
pairs in the double helix. In addition, further dye molecules may be weakly associated 
on the outside of the DNA helix. Even without light, the strongly bound acridines 
have a profound effect on the properties of DNA, and are well known as mutagenic 
agents. When light is introduced into the system, its energy can be transferred from 
the dye to the DNA. The long-lived triplet states of the dye are believed to be im-
portant for their stability to energy transfer, causing, in this way, the photosensitiza-
tion of the DNA macromolecule. The formation of free radicals in a DNA-acridine 
complex illuminated at 77 K was detected531, 809,810,1239). The detailed ESR study 
shows that the strongly bound intercalated dye molecules involved in the free radical 
formation, in contrast to the inactive dye molecules weakly bound on the outside of 
the DNA helix809). 
It can be concluded from the ESR study of DNA systems that the formation of 
ionic base radicals seems to be the fundamental process by which DNA responds to 
radiation. Further reactions of these radicals, either with the DNA or with external 
agents, may be important for the damage of DNA system produced by radiation. 
5.2. Free Radicals Formed in Glow Discharge of Polymers 
Glow discharge on the surface of polyethylene, poly(vinyl chloride), polystyrene, 
and poly-p-xylene samples causes the formation of macroradicals. These macroradi-
cals react further with oxygen and give peroxy radicals, which have been examined 
by ESR spectroscopy647, 1532, 2455). During glow discharge of polymer samples cross-
linking and degradation processes were observed.

tion. ESR study shows that, during the chain-breaking process, polymeric fragments 
are formed, which have the properties of polyradical anions equivalent to "living 
polymers". They are capable of initiating polymerization of a number of vinyl mono-
mers. The following mechanism of chain scission was proposed and presented in 
Table 5.41834).

Using flow techniques (described in detail in Chapter 3.6.2) hydroxy radicals can be 
generated in an ESR cavity. In the presence of water-soluble polymers, e.g. polyethyl-
ene oxide, poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(acrylic acid), poly(methacrylic acid), poly(ethyl-
ene imine), poly(propylene oxide), dextran, dextrin, soluble starch, and maltose, 
hydroxyl radicals may abstract hydrogen and form macroradicals491, 696, 2003). In

ESR Study of Polymers in Reactive Gases 
6.1. Molecular Oxygen 
Using quantum mechanics, the electronic configuration of molecular oxygen (02) 
in the ground state 3 ~g may be written as follows 770): 
Two unpaired electrons are in orbitals, each one having the orbital angular 
momentum on the molecular axis equal to unity, but resolving in different directions. 
This gives a total orbital angular momentum of zero. This state contains a molecular 
electron cloud with rotational symmetry, and it is called a sigma (~) state. The last 
two electrons have parallel spins, leading to a triplet state with paramagnetic proper-
ties. Molecular oxygen has a biradical nature and it reacts easily with other organic 
free radicals giving peroxyradicals. 
The ESR spectrum observed in gaseous oxygen at a pressure of a few mm Hg is 
very complicated. A total of 140 lines have been observed (Fig. 6.1). 
This spectrum has been fully analyzed and compared with a theoretical spec-
tiuml97, 258, 946, 2186, 2194). The relative intensity of particular lines changes with 
temperature, following the temperature response of the molecular rotational states. 
The observed absorption lines broaden rapidly with increasing pressure (Fig. 6.2) 
and are not resolved at atmospheric pressure. 
In ESR resonance cavities oxygen gives rise only to a very broad, and generally 
undetectable, absorption signal. 
Povich 1766) reported applications of ESR spectroscopy for the measurement of 
concentration and diffusion coefficient of oxygen dissolved in organic solvents. 
6.2. Singlet Oxygen 
Singlet oxygen has attracted increased attention in photooxidation processes occur-
ring in polymersl780, 1781, 1784, 1790, 1791, 1814, 1815). 
When sufficient energy is absorbed by molecular oxygen it may change its elec-
tronic configuration. Two states of excited oxygen are formed and are known as: 1107):

The electrons in the highest orbitals are paired and their spins are antiparallel. 
The first excited state-singlet oxygen 102edg)-exceeds the ground state of molecular 
oxygen e~g) by 22.5 kcal/mol (0.98 eV). Since the electrons in this state are. paired 
(have antiparallel spins) they show a characteristic ESR spectrum67, 284, 590, 639, 640, 
1108, 1109,2389,2390) (Fig. 6.3). 
2. Singlet oxygen 102e ~;) has an identical electron configuration with molecu-
lar oxygen e~g). The difference is that in the 102e~;) state the electrons in the 
antibonding (1T*) orbitals have antiparallel spins, whereas in the 3~g state these elec-
trons have parallel spins. The second excited state-singlet oxygen 102 e ~;)-exceeds 
the ground state of molecular oxygen e~g) by 37.5 kcal/mol (1.63 eV). 
6.3. Atomic Oxygen 
Atomic oxygen is formed during electric discharges in molecular oxygen956, 1452), 
and in flames. Most recently, increased attention has been devoted to the ageing of 
polymers in natural environments where atomic oxygen may be present847, 862, 863, 
1312,1814,1851). Atomic oxygen has an even number of electrons, is highly para-
magnetic, and can easily be detected by ESR spectroscopy. Its spectrum (Fig. 6.4) 
contains six fine-structure lines284, 1226).

2382) and biopolymers930. 1367) at low temperatures, free radicals are formed which 
may be detected by the ESR method. Because the depth of the penetration of hydro-
gen atoms into polymers is limited, polymers have to be exposed in "fluffs" obtained 
by freeze-drying of benzene solutions1361. 2362). It has been observed that polystyrene, 
poly(a-methylstyrene), poly(ethylene terephthalate), and polyacrylonitrile react 
with atomic hydrogen by addition575. 582) and large concentrations of polymer 
radicals can be detected by ESR. In other polymers such as polyethylene, poly-
propylene, polyisobutylene, poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl acetate), poly(methyl 
methacrylate), and polyamides, atomic hydrogen abstracts hydrogen from the poly-
mer molecules. The reactions of atomic hydrogen with polymers take place in a thin 
surface layer of about 10-6 cm574). Crosslinking reactions were also observed. 
ESR studies of deuterium atom136. 2376. 2377) and tritium reactions2448) with 
polystyrene "fluffs" were also reported.

linking of polystyrene "fluffs,,817, 1001.1002,2376,2381). Based on ESR spectra it 
was reported that the formation of free radicals in this case is not different from 
what is observed in reaction of hydrogen atoms with polystyrene or during the radiol-
ysis of that polymer.

Using ESR spectroscopy, it has been found that stable radicals present in 'Y-irra-
diated polyethylene initiate the chlorination of that polymer via the chain mecha-
nism1356).

polyquinones202 3), 
polyamides451, 803,1476), and polyurethanesI593). 
Some problems in the ESR study of photochemical oxidation of polymers were re-
viewed by Rabek and RanbyI789). 
Most polymers show asymmetric singlet-line spectra attributed to ROO, (RO') 
radicals, which are formed after introduction of air to samples containing free radi-
cals (R')' There is some difficulty in distinguishing between alkylperoxy (ROO·) 
and alkoxy (RO') radicals, since both have the unpaired electron mainly concentrated 
on oxygen atoms and neither show a hyperfme interaction with alkyl protonsI166). 
During study of photo dissociation of some alkyl hydro peroxides, Piette and Land-
graf1745) obtained alkoxy (RO') radicals showing a hyperfine splitting constant of 
3 G. This hyperfme splitting value is too small for observation even in well-resolved 
peaks of ESR spectra of solid polymers. These results have later been disclaimed 1 003, 
2124). Oxygenated radicals have smaller spin-lattice relaxation times than the majority 
of other free radicals trapped in polymers. ESR spectra of alkyl radicals (R') can be 
recorded without saturation broadening at a microwave power of about 1-3 mW, 
whereas oxygenated free radicals need a very high power, e.g. 100 mWI650). Figure 7.1 
shows a plot of the detected signal voltage (V) as a function of the square root of the 
microwave power (P) for alkyl and oxygenated radicals in polypropylene, demonstrat-
ing in this way the differences in saturation behavior.

Fig. 7.1. Saturation effect of free radicals 
trapped in 'Y-irradiated polypropylene:

The characteristic ESR signal of the oxygenated radicals (ROO') varies with the 
angle between the external field and the stretching direction of the polymer sample 
(Le. the chain axis). This effect is interpreted as arising from the density of the free 
spin in the p-orbital of the oxygen atom of peroxy radicals. Also the spin density 
distribution in the p-orbital possibly causes the g-factor anisotropy. The apparent 
principal values of the g-tensor, gil and g.l, can be expressed in terms of the principal 
values gl, g2 and g3 for the rigid state (see Chapter 2.5). The g-tensor of peroxy radi-
cals in the rigid state is approximately axially symmetric, and the value of gil is much 
larger than g.l, because of the large spin-orbit coupling constant of an oxygen atom 
and the small energy separation of the two 2 p (1T) orbitals, one of which contains 
the unpaired electron. In many cases, the value of g.l is close to the free spin value 
(--2.0023)2160), while gil is around 2.035-2.045684, 1034, 1686, 1927). From theo-
retical considerations995, 1683) the symmetry axis of the tensors, that is the direction 
of gil, is expected to be parallel to the O-O-bond. In order to elucitate the axis of 
rotational motion, it is desirable to determine the principal values and directions of 
the g-tensor, both at room temperature and 77 K (see Chapter 7.4). 
The peroxy radicals formed in various polymers decayed after different lifetimes 
(Fig. 7.2). 
The decay of alkyl radicals (R') is not observed, as they easily react with molecu-
lar oxygen at diffusion controlled rates, and are not present in detectable amounts. 
7.2. Polyethylene 
ESR studies of peroxy radicals formed during the reaction of oxygen with free radi-
cals formed under ionizing and UV-irradiation (see Chapter 5.1.1.2) were published 
by many authorsl4, 456, 1137, 1388, 1473,1476,1589,1642,1648,1650,1936,2267,2272).

Alkyl (5.3) and allyl (5.4) radicals react with oxygen immediately and give per-
oxy radicals which decay with half-lives of about 10 and 20 min, respectively1650). 
Free radicals decay quickly to a level of about 80%, and thereafter decay is rather 
slow. It is difficult to prepare a sample in which only alkyl or allyl radicals are present. 
It is also difficult to recognize from the type of free radicals, what peroxy radicals 
are formed. In Figure 7.3 the change in ESR spectra is shown for allyl radicals (5.4) 
directly after introducing air. 
Introduction of air to a polyethylene sample containing polyenyl radicals (5.5) 
did not give the asymmetric peroxide singlet spectrum (Fig. 7.4), as in the case of 
allyl radicals (Fig. 7.4). 
Polyenyl peroxy radicals decay with a half-life of 20 min1650). It has been found 
that the asymmetric spectrum of alkyl peroxy radicals in a polyethylene sample 
shows an anisotropy (Fig. 7.5).

A detailed analysis of the anisotropy of peroxy radicals is given in the description 
of peroxy radicals of poly( tetrafluoroethylene} in Chapter 7.4. 
The predominating reaction mechanism of peroxy radicals is the intermolecular 
hydrogen abstraction: 
ROO· + RH-- ROOH + R· 
(7.1) 
According to this mechanism a new alkyl free radical can be formed. In spite of 
great efforts to study the oxidation mechanism of polyolefines, this problem and its 
interpretation has not yet been fully resolved 518, 519, 1784). 
7.3. Polypropylene 
A number of workers recorded the ESR studies of radiation-produced peroxy radi-
cals of polypropylene 332, 456-458,603,623,683,684,838,1034,1154,1158,1159,1330, 
1476,1481,1591,1639,1648,1560,1651,2243) 
ESR spectra of peroxy radicals produced by 'Y-irradiation of polypropylene in 
the presence of oxygen at room temperature and at 77 K are asymmetric and do not 
show any distinct dependence upon temperature (Fig. 7.6). 
Figure 7.7 shows ESR spectra of polypropylene peroxy radicals obtained during 
thermal oxidation in the range of 383-413 K.

The spectra at 383 K show marked anisotropy independent of molecular weight

tropy as shown in Figure 7.7 for crystalline polypropylene or nearly complete averag-
ing to resemble at 403 K (amorphous samples). For the former, Rl = 2.0061 and 
gil = 2.0187. At 403 K, most spectra are symmetric and they have the following 
parameters g = 2.0067 and MI 1/2 = 8.6 G. At 413 K spectra are symmetric and have 
g = 2.0067 and £\H1/2 = 7.4 G. At 423 K the line-width is about 8 G.

Neudorfel1 591) desribes the oxygen consumption of irradiated samples as a func-
tion of the decrease of the radical concentration. The rate constants for the oxidation 
of polypropylene were also determined by ESR method458). 
The formation of peroxy radicals during UV-irradiation of polypropylene was 
investigated in detail by Tsuji2243). Typical ESR spectrum obtained during UV-irra-
diation of polypropylene at 77 K in the presence of air is shown in Figure 7.8. 
This spectrum was attributed to the free radicals (5.13) and methyl (5.17) radi-
cals. During warming of the sample to room temperature spectral changes were ob-
served. The four-line spectrum due to methyl radicals disappeared at 113 K. The 
broad four-line spectrum began to change at about 133 K and a broad singlet spec-
trum was observed at 193 K. When the spectrum was recorded at 113 K an asymmetric 
component, characteristic of peroxy radicals in a rigid matrix, was observed 
<:&t = 2.004 and gu = 2.032). This result indicates that the peroxy radicals were 
produced below 133 K, but are shifted somewhat at this temperature. The peroxy 
radicals are expected to move relatively freely as they are located on a side chain 
(7.1):

When polypropylene was UV-irradiated through a UV-33 filter a broad singlet 
spectrum with a g-value of about 2.005 and with some shoulders was observed 
(Fig. 7.9).

A similar asymmetric ESR spectrum due to peroxy radicals was observed at 
123 K and remained up to 273 K. The temperature dependence shows that the per-
oxy radicals in this case do not move so freely. This type of peroxy radicals (7.2) 
may be produced from the alkyl radicals (5.12) by the following reaction:

Milinchuk and Pshezhetskii1481) have found that peroxy radicals in polypropyl-
ene at 77 K are converted under UV-irradiation «3000 A) into alkyl radicals.

peroxides of polypropylene with amines in a styrene matrix and obtained an asym-
metric spectrum (Fig. 7.10).

This spectrum was attributed to alkoxy radicals resulting from homolytic scission 
of the 0-0 bonds in polypropylene hydroperoxide or to nitroxy radicals formed 
during the decomposition of the system hydroperoxide-amine. 
A similar ESR study was reported on the reactions of aromatic amines with 
peroxide groups in solid polymers in the temperature range from 77 K to 293 K581). 
Thermal decomposition of benzoyl peroxide 1796) and di-tert-butyl peroxalatel597) 
in polypropylene and also in other polymers produce peroxy radicals which were 
examined by ESR spectroscopy. 
7.4. Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) 
ESR spectra of peroxy radicals in poly(tetrafluoroethylene) were investigated by 
several authors62, 888-891, 893,1025,1034,1137,1148,1152,1158,1160,1330,1432,1478,

The line shape and the characteristics of ESR spectra due to peroxy radicals in 
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) are difficult to interpret and are not yet well understood. 
Temperature dependence and orientation effects on the spectral line shapes were 
studied and interpreted on the basis of general theory for randomly oriented samples 
and for molecular motion 1 034, 1534). Figure 7.11 shows the variation with tempera-
ture of the ESR spectra of peroxy radicals trapped in poly( tetrafluoroethylene ) 
powder.

7. ESR Studies of the Oxidation of Polymers 
As it has been reported by several authors1034• 1433.2160), the spectrum, at room 
temperature, of the peroxy radicals trapped in poly( tetrafluoroethylene) consists of 
two spectral components, one asymmetric and the other symmetric1034). The sym-
metric component indicated by the broken line in Figure 7.11 b is attributed to per-
oxy radicals which have enough motional freedom to average out the entire anisotropy 
in g-value. The asymmetric component indicated by the dotted line has a character-
istic line shape arising from the axially symmetric g-tensor. From the line shape the 
principal values were obtained: gu = 2.0061 and gl = 2.0221, where gii and gl repre-
sent the apparent principal values at room temperature in directions parallel and per-
pendicular, respectively, to the symmetry axis of the g-tensor. In the spectrum ob-
served at 77 K (Fig. 7.11 a) only one spectral component is observed. The following 
principal values of the g-tensor were obtained at 77 K from the line shape of the 
spectrum: g1 = 2.0384, g2 = 2.0071, g3 = 2.00261034) and g1 = 2.0385, g2 = 2.0079 
and g3 = 2.00231534). Since g2 is nearly equal to g3 at 77 K and g1 is assigned ap-
proximately to gil, it is concluded that g2 and g3 represent gl.' The symmetric com-
ponent of the ESR spectrum at room temperature was attributed to free radical (Z3) 
and the asymmetric component to free radical (Z4)889. 1034. 1148. 1433.2006.2152):

The temperature variations of the ESR line shape of the peroxy radicals (7.3) 
and (7.4) are shown in Figures 7.12 and 7.13, respectively. 
It has been found that the peaks corresponding to g1 and g2 change into a single 
line at 223 K. This coalescence indicates that the g1 and g2 of the g-tensor are averaged 
out by rapid motion. 
ESR spectra of peroxy radicals of poly( tetrafluoroethylene) obtained at room 
temperature at various orientations of the stretch axis to the magnetic field are shown 
in Figure 7.14. 
-
Angular dependence of the observed g-value for the anisotropic component of 
the room temperature spectra of an oriented poly( tetrafluoroethylene) sample is 
given in Figure 7.15. 
In general, the direction of gil does not always agree with the molecular chain 
axis. The g-value g = 2.0059, which has been found with the field parallel to the 
stretch axis, is very close to gjj = 2.0061 obtained from the line shape in the powdered 
spectrum, and g = 2.0213 measured in the perpendicular direction is near to gl = 
2.0221. This means that the symmetry axis of the g-tensor is parallel to the molecu-
lar chain axis at room temperature. 
The angular dependence of the spectra of oriented films was also observed at 
77 K (Fig. 7.16). 
The ESR spectrum observed with the field direction parallel to the stretch axis 
has a range of g-values from 2.0019 to 2.0376 (Fig. 7 .16 a). The spectrum of the 
radical giving a symmetric component at room temperature becomes anisotropic at 
77 K, because of decreasing molecular motion. The peroxy radicals (7.3) and (Z4)

trapped in amorphous regions are probably not oriented in respect to the chain axis, 
and thus produce no orientation in the spectrum. From detailed analysis of the 
changes in g-values it has been assumed that the -COO, groups lie in a plane perpen-
dicular to the molecular chain axis, as shown in Figure 7.13. The principal values 
and directions of the g-tensor are collected in Table 7.1 and the g-values in oriented 
mm in Table 7.2. 
The apparent g-tensor of a freely rotating chain radical should have axial sym-
metry in respect to the axis of rotation, because the magnitude of g-value with the 
field direction along the axis of rotation is invariant to rotation. The g-value for any 
field direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation is the same when the correlation

mum and minimum g-values during one revolution. Supposing that the very rapid 
motion around C-O bond occurs at room temperature, the g-tensor should then 
have axial symmetry about the C-O bond, and consequently the direction of gii 
should become perpendicular to the chain axis. The conclusion contradicts the 
results obtained. On the other hand, if rapid motion around the chain axis takes 
place, the g-tensor should be axially symmetric around the molecular chain axis, 
and this explanation is in agreement with experimental data. Consequently, g3 is 
invariant to rotation around the chain axis and then is equivalent to gii. For the direc-
tion perpendicular to the chain axis, the average of gl and g3 can be observed as gr, 
if the frequency of the rotational motion is sufficiently larger than gl -g2. Thus, 
gii = g3 
(7.4) 
As it is shown above, the principal values and directions of g-tensor and the tem-
perature change of the spectra of peroxy radicals have very valuable information 
related to the rotational motion around the molecular chain axis.

Che and Tench447) investigated ESR spectra of 170-labeled peroxy radicals in 
poly(tetrafluoroethylene). Admission of oxygen of 58% 170 at room temperature 
to 'Y-irradiated poly( tetrafluoroethylene) leads to a large number of new lines 
(recorded at 77 K), resulting from the coupling of the unpaired electron with the 
170 nucleus with I = 5/2 (Fig. 7.17). 
The hyperfine spectrum is centered on the g.l component and two sets of six 
equally spaced lines can be resolved with hyperfine splittings of all = 46 ± 1 G and

In several papersl148, 1152, 1160, 1478, 1480,2006,2216) the photo conversion of 
peroxide radicals in poly(tetrafluoroethylene) has been reported. Under VV-light 
(X < 3000 A) the peroxy radicals (7.3) are dissociated to fluoroalkyl radicals

At every stage of the decay of the end peroxide radical (Z 3) the free valency 
migrates along the polymer chain to a distance equal to two lengths of the C-C bond 
(ca. 3 A)1478). 
A stepwise decay curve for peroxy radicals in poly( chlorotrifluoroethylene) was 
observed893) (Fig. 7.18). 
By comparing the results with molecular mobility measurements performed by 
dielectric and mechanical relaxation methods it was concluded that the stepwise 
character of the radical decay cannot be interpreted by a bimolecular radical-radical 
recombination process. In the case of poly( chlorotrifluoroethylene) a reaction of 
trapped radicals with thermally mobilized electrons has been suggested893). This 
means that a polymer may behave as an electret. 
7.S. ESR Studies of Antioxidants 
A free radical chain mechanism for the oxidation of polymers is generally accepted 
as follows: 
Initiator ---+ R· 
(7.6) 
R· + PH ---+ p. + RH 
(7.7) 
P·+02--POO· 
(7.8) 
POO· + PH ---+ POOH + p. 
(7.9) 
POOH--PO· +·OH 
(7.10) 
where PH is polymer. 
The main role of antioxidants is to transform highly reactive polymer alkyl (p.), 
alkoxy (PO·), and peroxy (POO·) radicals into less reactive aromatic radicals (Ar) 
or phenoxyl radicals (ArO·). 
Phenolic antioxidants terminate the chain reaction by a hydrogen abstraction 
mechanism: 
p. + ArOH -- PH + ArO· 
(7.11 ) 
POO· + ArOH-- POOH + ArO· 
(7.12) 
The phenoxyl radicals formed can either react with another alkylperoxy radical 
or dimerize. The reason why certain phenols are better antioxidants than others was 
examined by many investigators. In addition to the ease of oxidation of a certain 
phenol, the stability of its phenoxyl radical is also important for the antioxidant 
activity. Reasonably long-lived phenoxyl radicals are required for reactions to occur 
between ArO· and alkyl or peroxy radicals. Radical reactivity and lifetime are depen-
267 

7. ESR Studies of the Oxidation of Polymers 
dent on the degree to which the unpaired electron can be delocalized. In general, 
the aromatic free radicals are more stable than aliphatic radicals because the unpaired 
electron can interact with the 1T-electrons in a phenyl ring. The second important 
factor influencing radical stability is the steric hindrance. In a series of phenoxyl 
radicals, the lifetime increases as the steric hindrance in the ortho and para positions 
increases330) :

ESR spectroscopy has widely been applied to determine molecular structure of 
phenoxyl radicals and also to measure relative concentrations of free radicals by 
phenolic compounds133, 330, 982-984,1765,2203,2204,2407,2408). 
Tka~ and Omelka2203, 2204) investigated the reactivity of antioxidants, e.g. 
phenols, biphenols, thiophenols, naphthols, and benzophenones, towards peroxy 
and alkoxy radicals in the presence of transition metal ions. Traces of cobalt induce 
the decomposition of hydro peroxides generated in the thermal oxidation of a poly-
mer. The principle of this method is shown in reactions:

. In Tables 7.3 and 7.4 are collected 
ESR spectra of complex-bonded phenoxyl radicals in the ligand field of cobalt gener-
ated in reactions (7.16) and (7.17). 
The radical concentration and the ratio of alkoxy and peroxy radicals in a chain 
oxidation process in the presence of (3-phenyl or a-naphthylamine (Arl-NH-Ar2) 
have also been determined from the different ESR spectra of fixed (CoIIl)-

(Ar 1-N"-Ar2) and free stable nitroxy (Arl-N-Ar2) radicals2203).

According to ESR spectra of the generated phenoxy radicals, the differently 
substituted phenols may be divided into five main groups2204): 
1. Phenols which form stable primary free radicals, e.g. phenols with two tert-
butyl groups in ortho-position and para-position substituted with alkyl groups such 
as -CH3, -CH2CH3, or -C(CH3h (Table 7.3). 
2. Phenols which form stable secondary free radicals but not in para-position 
(Table 7.3 A). Primarily formed unstable radicals change rapidly into secondary more 
stable radicals, as registered by ESR spectroscopy. When the two methyls are in ortho-
position, the oxidative coupling leads to the formation of polyphenyl ether radicals 
(Table 7.38). In the case of 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol in contrast to other phenols 
nonsubstituted in ortho-position, the delocalization of the free electrons in this posi-
tion leads to a rapid dimerization (Table 7.3 C). 
3. Phenols which give stable phenoxy radicals after coordination in the ligand 
field of the transition metal. Phenols, biphenols, naphthols, and dihydroxybenzo-
phenons belong to this group (Table 7.4). 
4. Phenols whose radicals undergo disproportionation, e.g. dihydroxythiophenols. 
5. Phenols substituted with N02 groups, e.g. nitrophenols which do not form 
radicals in nonpolar solvents. 
Westfahl et al.2408) measured relative radical concentrations, i.e. radical stability 
of phenols as a function of temperature using ESR, and found that the radical con-
centrations are a good measure of the activity as antioxidants of twelve different 
compounds studied. Westfahl2407) also applied another reaction for studying ESR 
spectra of phenols using ferricyanide ions as oxidative agent: 
HO-o-CH20H + Fe(CN)s-3 + ow -.0-o-CH20H + Fe(CN)s-4 + H20 
(7.18) 
(Z9) 
Considering the ESR spectra Westfahl proposed a division of the different 
phenols studied into two classes: one which gives stable free radicals (Z 9) and an-
other which forms relatively unstable free radicals. 
The ESR spectroscopy was also used for the study of the inhibition effect of 
some antioxidants of the polymerization of methyl methacrylate which proceeds

ESR Studies of Molecular Fracture in Polymers 
8.1. Introduction 
Molecular fracture in polymers is a very complicated phenomenon. The basic mecha-
nism of fracture may involve chain scission, slippage, unfolding, chain pulling, phase 
segregation, dewetting, and failure of fillers and reinforcements. The theory, mecha-
nism, and kinetics of molecular fracture are discussed in many publications43, 44, 146, 
158,220,336,365,367,377,488,538,542,549,1093, 1094, 1097, 1098, 1732, 1733, 1734, 1736, 
1737,1852,1862,2012,2025,2168,2359-2362,2416, 2472,2496). 
The formation of free radicals, sometimes called "mechanoradicals" in polymers 
under mechanical action, was first discovered in 1959 by Bresler et al.306) using ESR 
spectroscopy. It was further shown that the ESR method may be sucessfully applied 
for a direct study of bond rupture in highly oriented fibers and films of the follow-
ing polymers: 
polyethylene306, 510, 536, 540,1099,1100,1557,1800,1878.2474-2476,2479,2504),

8.2. Generation of Submicrocracks 
The state of the amorphous phase, the structure of the crystalline phase, defects in 
the crystals, and external impurities have influence on the formation and behavior 
of radicals in solid polymers. 
274 

8.2. Generation of Submicrocracks 
The extent of bond breakage along the surface of fracture is smaller in cast or 
moulded materials than in fibers, because a fracture involves a higher degree of un-
raveling of chains than of chain scission. Chain rupture is more localized in the crack 
surface of the cast or moulded materials than in drawn fibers, where chain breaks are 
distributed more uniformly within the stressed material540). When significant amounts 
of bond ruptures occur along certain fracture surfaces, microcracks are fonned.

cals(-x-) and stable endgroups(o-), c. Scission of internal free radical~ yielding stable atomic 
groups and end radicals, d. formation of submicrocracks as a result of submicrocracks a result 
of chain degradation of macromolecules2504) 
The strength and fracture properties of semicrystalline polymers are dependent 
on the character of the regions between the crystallites or well-ordered micelles, i.e. 
the number, orientation, and length distribution of the "tie chains" connecting 
crystalline regions122, 540). PetClrlin et al. 1738, 1739) have shown that these regions 
change significantly during drawing and processing. The most strained tie molecules, 
bridging through the amorphous layers which are sandwiched between the crystal 
cores of consecutive lamellae, are broken 1730). 
There are three models of generation of submicrocracks: 
1. Zhurkov modeI2494-2509) 
2. Peterlin model388, 488,1730,1731,1737,2359,2360) 
3. Sohrna modelllOO, 2057) 
1. In solid polymers in glassy state, where mobility of the macromolecules is 
limited, scission of chemical bonds is localized near the site of the formation of 
primary radicals. For the same reason chain end free radicals may only abstract 
hydrogen atoms from adjacent molecules. FollOwing the chain reaction may neigh-
boring macromolecules be degraded in fast reactions, and local sites of disintegration. 
are formed in a stressed polymer. Such local degraded sites may be considered as 
sub microcracks. Figure 8.1 shows the Zhurkov model of submicrocrack formation 
in an oriented polymer. 
The formation of submicrocracks was detected by small angle X-ray scattering 
technique2497, 2498, 2504). This method allows the measuring of their dimension and 
concentration. The observed crack dimensions correspond to the measured micro-
fibril diameters in deformed fibres of polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyam-
ides1243). The Zhurkov mechanism presented above does not consider cage recom-
275 

8. ESR Studies of Molecular Fracture in Polymers 
bination and cage escape of chain end free radicals. This problem was discussed in 
detail by Butyagin 368) and Davis et al. 509). The Zhurkov model has recently been 
developed by Kausch et al. 1093, 1095-1098). 
2. The Peterlin model is based on the observation that the number of radicals 
formed is dependent on the strain, but not on the stress. The radical concentration 
remains unchanged when the applied stress is removed. New radicals are only formed 
when additional stretching in the second loading cycle reaches the maximum strain 
of the previous loading. Considering these results, Peterlin 1731, 1737) proposed the 
model presented in Figure 8.2. 
a 
b 
c 
Fig. 8.2. Peterlin model of submicrocracks 
generation. In this figure the squares re-
present crystallites and the strings are the 
tie molecules connecting with crystal-
lites1737) 
From experimental results, Peterlin suggested that the applied stress is mostly 
concentrated in the tie molecules, which stretch to their maximum length at a given 
strain. Increased tensile force leads to chain rupture producing free radicals. This 
model of fracture assumes that the crystallites are sufficiently strong to remain un-
affected in large deformation of the sample, and that the polymer chains are not 
pulled out from the crystallites by the applied stress. This model was supported by 
Sohma et al. 1100, 2057), who suggested that free radicals may only be formed by 
scission of tie molecules in the case of crystalline polymers like polyethylene, poly-
propylene, and polytetrafluoroethylene. Polyethylene which has been treated with 
nitric acid removing tie molecules does not give ESR signals under stressing the 
sample, although nontreated samples give easily detected ESR spectra. The above-
described Peterlin model cannot be applied to the fracture of amorphous polymers, 
e.g. poly(methyl methacrylate) and polybutadiene, because these polymers do not 
contain tie macromolecules. 
3. In order to explain the mechanism of the formation of free radicals in amor-
phous solid polymers, Sohma 11 00, 2057) proposed that chain scission in amorphous 
solid polymers results from large scale shearing motions of the macromolecules. 
During tensile stressing of polymers strong ESR signals are detected (Fig. 8.3-
Fig. 8.6). 
While the tensile strength of polyethylene and nylon is increased roughly ten 
times by the drawing operation, the radical concentration at fracture increases from 
1011_10 13 free radicals/cm3 to approximately 1017 free radicals/cm3 540). The in-
tensity of an ESR spectrum recorded is proportional to the number of broken bonds 
in a degraded sample. The maximum number of radicals observed is particularly large 
in nylons388, 540, 2502) and may reach 1-5 x 1017 free radicals/cm3, and is substan-
tially smaller in polyethylene, i.e. 1016 free radicals/cm3, or even less2502). Figure

For constant stress (the creep test) the free-radical concentration increases 
linearly with time (Fig. 8.7b). 
It was also reported that heat treatment of solid polymers, e.g. polypropylene, 
produces an anomalous increase in radical concentration formed by mechanical 
fracture 1877). 
When impurities are present in polymer materials, they can react with primary 
radicals formed by fracture and give more stable free radicals, which may be detected 
after several days at room temperature388). It was reported that chloranil and other 
quinones were used for trapping radicals produced during the stretching of poly-
arnides848). This method provides a quantitatives measurement of the integrated 
number of free radicals produced during a stressing process.

8.3. Generation of Free Radicals in Mechanically Deformed Polyethylene 
Mechanochemical destruction of polyethylene under applied stress in vacuum may 
be described by the following mechanism2473, 2475, 2479, 2504}: 
(8.1) 
-CH2-CH2 + -CH2-CH2-CH2 ------+ -CH2 -CH3 + -CH2-CH-CH2 -

(8.3) 
Under a uniaxial tension the mechanical force deforms bonds in the polymer 
chain2500, 2507-2509}. In this process the energy required for breaking a C-C bond 
decreases (ca. 72 kcal/mol at zero stress for a perfect molecule or slightly less if rup-
ture occurs at preexisting defects, e.g. internal stress327}) and the bonds are scissioned 
by thermal fluctuation. More detailed examination of the observed activation energies 
of deformation are given in later papers41 , 509, 1692}. The homolytic breakage of 
bonds in the main chain of a polymer leads to formation of end-macroradicals. These 
radicals are very reactive and abstract hydrogen atoms from neighboring macromole-
cules; this is shown to occur in the solid state even at temperatures as low as 130 K 1800, 
2474}. The abstraction of hydrogen weakens the interatomic bonds of adjacent atoms 
considerably. The activation energy for C-C bond scission in a polymer chain in 
{j-position to the unpaired electron is by about one third higher than the activation 
278 

8.3. Generation of Free Radicals in Mechanically Deformed Polyethylene 
energy needed for the rupture of a common bond 1403). For that reason, the C-C 
bonds near the abstracted hydrogen may be considered as weaker bonds in the macro-
molecule. The free radical formed after the abstracting of hydrogen atom initiates a 
new reaction of scission. In this way mechanochemical decomposition in a stressed 
polymer may be ,considered as a rapid chain reactionI244, 2497). One radical may 
initiate the scission of about 1000 other bonds in polymer molecules2504). Conse-
quently a small number of primary radicals formed by mechanical forces and thermal 
fluctuations results in the destruction of many adjacent polymer chains and in the 
decrease of mechanical strength. 
As the supporting evidence for this deformation model, Zhurkov et al.2504) 
report that the concentration of submicroscopic cracks in a polyethylene sample at 
fracture is about the same (ca. 1016 cracks/cm3) as the concentration of radicals 
accumulated. This fact is consistent with the chain reaction model where permanent 
rupture produces no further increase in radical concentration. From infrared absorp-
tion studies, the concentration of methyl groups and groups with unsaturated bonds 
was found to be ca. 1Q19/cm3. Hence, each crack should intersect about 1000 broken 
molecules, corresponding to a crack diameter of roughly 150 A, i.e. about the value 
of the microfibril diameter in polyethylene. 
Sohrna 1978) investigated the formation of free radicals by ESR during the mecha-
nical desintegration of paraffins and low molecular weight polyethylenes by milling. 
Mechanical fracture of n.paraffin of 32 carbons did not produce radicals. For poly-
ethylene with about 100 monomer units per chain an ESR signal was observed which 
was too weak to be analysed (Fig. 8.8).

ene with a chain of 71 carbon atoms, c. Polyethylene with a chain of 100 carbon atoms, d. Poly· 
ethylene with a chain of 136 carbon atoms. All samples were milled in vacuum at 77 K1878) 
For polyethylene with 136 monomer units an ESR spectrum was recorded. The 
experimental results show that critical size for mechanical chain break in polyethyl-
ene is between 70 and 100 monomer units. These experimental results support 
Sohrna's model for the fracture of amorphous polymers. Large shearing of single 
polymer molecules, which leads to a macroscopic fracture, requires a simultaneous 
motion of each constituent monomer in the chain. Such shearing movement of a 
polymer requires more energy than that of a substance of low molecular weight. For 
sufficiently long chains SohmallOO, 2057) assumed the following relation: 
279 

8. ESR Studies of Molecular Fracture in Polymers 
(8.4) 
where n is the number of monomer units in the polymer molecule, En is the activa-
tion energy for moving one monomer unit (En = 1.01 kcal mol-I) and Ec-c the 
bond energy (Ec-c = 88 kcal mol-I). From this relation a critical value n = 83 is 
obtained, which agrees with the experimental results from measuring ESR spectra. 
When the number of monomers which move in a simultaneous and incorporated way 
is larger than 85, the C-C bond rupture consumes less energy than the shearing 
motion of the long chain. In such case the crack may proceed by breaking C-C 
bonds and not by shearing motion of polymer chains. A pair of radicals is formed 
for each main chain scission. 
The mechanical destruction of polyethylene in the presence of air is followed 
by a rapid formation of peroxy radicals510, 2057, 2505). It was found that radicals 
produced in mechanical degradation are much more reactive towards oxygen than 
radicals formed by ionizing radiation. This difference in reactivity is presumably due 
to the difference in the trapping sites for the two kinds of radicals2057). During frac-
ture, radicals are formed and trapped on freshly formed surfaces and, therefore, are 
easily accessible to oxygen, whereas free radicals, induced by ionizing radiation, are 
formed and trapped in the solid, where the presence and concentration of oxygen is 
limited by diffusion. 
8.4. ESR Study of Free Radicals Formed during Fracture in Rubber 
ESR spectroscopy was successfully applied for study of free radicals generated dur-
ing fracture in rubber45, 46,306,307,320,321,371,536,537,546,1100,1453, 1578,1765, 
1822,1839,1878,2400) and especially in ozone atmosphere 537, 539,544,545,548). The 
results obtained were reviewed in detail by DeVries537). 
Rubber samples prestrained and fractured at low temperatures exhibited strong 
ESR signals (Fig. 8.9), while samples fractured at the same temperatures but without 
prestrain showed a low, if any, free radical concentration during deformation46, 1453, 
1578) (Fig. 8.10). 
The large number of radicals produced during this deformation suggests that 
fracture is initiated in prestrained rubbers in many sites throughout the specimen 
volume. It was also found that the radical concentration varies with the rate of de-
formation, the crosslink density in the sample used, the degree of deformation, and 
the purity of the sample. When visible crazing occurs, the absorption of oxygen in· 
creases and results in the formation of peroxy radicalsl287, 1289). 
The deformation of cross-linked natural rubber shows that three different kinds 
of deformation are possible below Tg , depending on temperature and strain rate at 
which the tensile test is performed. At temperatures immediately below Tg , the 
materials deform by shear yielding or cold drawing. At temperatures below 160 K 
and above 140 K, brittle behavior is obtained. Further decrease in test temperatures 
results in the formation of crazings. Figure 8.11 shows these three regions of defor-
mation behavior in a strained rubber sample46).

8. ESR Studies of Molecular Fracture in Polymers 
The strain rate also affects the spin concentration. Figure 8.12 shows the varia-
tion of spin concentration at a given overall strain for polychloroprene. 
The number of radicals formed is related to the number of craze bands formed46). 
The formation of peroxy radicals in stretched rubber samples can be studied by 
three methods: 
1. Direct observation of alkylperoxy radicals from ESR spectra. 
2. Measuring of change in concentration of stable aryloxy radicals which are 
formed in reaction between alkylperoxy radicals and incorporated to the 
rubber sample stable radicals, e.g. galvinoxyl. 
3. Study of aryloxy radicals from phenols, e.g. hydroxygalvinoxyl, incorporated 
in rubber sample. 
Applications of these methods for the observation of radical formation in stretched 
peroxide or sulphur-cured rubbers are described in papers46, 1578, 1765, 1822). 
8.5. ESR Study of Fatigue Processes in Polymers 
ESR spectroscopy was also applied to study of bond rupture under alternating tensile 
stressesS40). Figure 8.13 shows the cumulative increase in free radical concentration 
when an alternating stress of ± 35 000 psi was superimposed upon a mean stress of 
70000 psi.

It has been found that under these conditions the number of bonds that rupture 
before the final failure of the test sample is substantially lower than the value for 
fracture under a monotonically increasing stress. 
Nagamura et al. 1SS7) applied ESR to study structural changes in high-density 
polyethylene occurring in the fatigue process. They suggested that the mosaic block 
crystals in the lamellae are fust decomposed into smaller ones by the applied cyclic 
282 

8.6. ESR Study of Free Radicals Formed during Grinding and Machining of Polymers 
stress. This process probably occurs by heat generation in the specimen under the 
cyclic stress. During repeated loading, the molecular motion excited by the internally 
generated heat may tend to initiate more stable packing of deformed molecules. 
8.6. ESR Study of Free Radicals Formed During Grinding and Machining 
of Polymers 
Various operations such as machining, grinding(milling), sawing, and cutting may 
produce large amounts of new fracture surface in comparatively small quantities of 
polymeric material. Every polymer tested produces strong ESR signals after such 
treatment122,296, 303,304, 306, 362, 364, 370, 372, 376,540,541,543,547,576,578,602, 
796,1598,1747,1800,1812,1875,1878,2416,2486, 2503). Figures 8.14-8.19 show ESR 
spectra of different polymers obtained during the grinding. 
In this case the ESR method allows an estimate of the number of bonds broken 
per unit area of new surface formed and the depth of damage at new surfaces as a 
function of fracture mode and fracture conditions. Results obtained indicate that 
during the grinding of nylon 6 at 77 K, 1013 to 1014 broken bonds/cm2 of new sur-
face are formed540). The majority of these broken bonds lie within a few IlIll below 
the surface. In semicrystalline polymers, such as nylon and polyethylene, the cracks 
propagate through amorphous regions surrounding the more ordered regions. Frac-
tures take place along preferential routes, with the result that significantly fewer 
molecular chains per cm2 of new surface area are ruptured than expected, on the 
basis of calculated number of chains passing through a unit cross section of bulk 
polymer122,547). 
ESR spectra of polymer samples milled in vacuum differ appreciably from those 
milled in presence of air. Sohma et al.2057) have shown that alkyl radicals formed 
during ball milling of polypropylene in vacuum (Fig. 8.19 a), after contact with oxy-
gen, give peroxy radicals (Fig. 8.19b). 
Particles ground from elastomers at 77 K give a large number of radicals and 
differ from those ground at room temperature which give much fewer radicals. This 
indicates two distinct fracture mechanisms being operative above and below the glass 
transition temperature 5 43). 
Free radicals have also been detected during milling and mastification of rubber, 
after trapping by freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen below the glass transition 
temperature (T g)371, 541), or by reaction with stable free radicals ("spin traps") 
previously introduced to the examined sample 1282, 1822, 1839) (see Chap. 11). 
ESR has been used most successfully by Russian scientists to investigate bond 
rupture during grinding of biopolymers as cellulose5, 7, 795, 796,1146,1414), starch5), 
gelatine4, 7), wool and silk2425), albumines3), and proteins369). 
ESR has also been used to study processes during the extraction of human 
teeth535) and formation and breakdown of the structure in hard leather produced 
on an abrasive wear machine1247, 1248).

8.7. Anomalous Behavior of Free Radicals Obtained by Sawing Technique 
8.7. Anomalous Behavior of Free Radicals Obtained by Sawing Technique 
It has been observed that decay curves of free radicals produced by sawing in liquid 
nitrogen show anomalous behavior 1100, 1879,2051,2057) (Fig. 8.20). 
On raising the temperature to 150 K a rapid increase of radical concentration 
has been observed and interpreted as being caused by excess electric charge due to 
triboelectricity and oxygen dissolved in the liquid nitrogen used. It has been found 
that sawdust particles have a strong electrical charge. These experimental results 
suggest that the excess electric charges produced by friction may play some role in 
the production of new radicals in this temperature range. In the presence of a strong 
electron scarenger, e.g. tetra-cyano-ethylene, these anomalies in the decay curve of 
free radicals disappear (Fig. 8.21). 
It has been shown by Theodorescu2175, 2176) that the electric field effects the 
ESR spectra. 
Oxygen plays an important role in the observed phenomena. No anomalous in-
crease appears when mechanical degradation is made in vacuum (Fig. 8.22). 
For explanation of these anomalies the following mechanism has been proposed 
by Sohma et al.1879, 2057): 
1. During mechanical degradation of a polymer sample at 77 K in the presence 
of oxygen, free radicals (R·) and peroxy radicals (ROO·) are formed. At the same

polymers such as polystyrene, poly( vinyl acetate), poly( vinylcyc1ohexane), and 
poly(methyl methacrylate) degraded mechanically in different hydrogen-donor 
solvents, e.g. toluene, ethylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, were reported361 , 372, 580). 
Solvent radicals formed by hydrogen abstraction were found.

Chapter 9 
ESR Studies of Graft Copolymerization 
Under ionizing irradiation of solid polymers free radicals are formed which are trapped 
in a polymer matrix (see Chap. 5). Under certain conditions, these radicals can initiate 
graft polymerization. The grafting reaction is dependent on the physical state of the 
polymer and the properties of the free radicals formed in the polymerl66, 356, 409, 
410,1512,2069). For that reason ESR spectroscopy is a very important tool for the 
study of grafting mechartism. A sample of electron- or 'Y-irradiated polymer is brought 
into contact with monomer vapour, which can diffuse into the polymer phase and 
thus reach the trapped radical sites. This reaction can be examined very well by ESR 
spectroscopy and has been applied for the study of grafting of acrylic acid and metha-
crylic acid386), methyl methacrylate480, 1153, 1155, 1934, 1937), styrene495, 496, 604, 
1624,1625,1938,2158,2159,2452) butadienel937) monochlorotrifluoroethylene2130) 
tetrafluoroethylene2129) to pol;olefmes, styren~ to polytetrafluoroethylene561, 215'7) 
and poly(chloro-trifluoroethylene)895), tetrafluoroethylene to polytetrafluoroethyl-
eneI21), and butadiene to poly(vinyl chloride)857, 2099). 
9.1. Graft Copolymerization to Polyethylene 
When polyethylene is irradiated in air, three types of radicals are observed: alkyl, 
allyl, and peroxy (see Chap. 5 and Chap. 7). Among these, peroxy radicals are un-
reactive and do not participate in grafting reactions. The initially observed alkyl radi-
cals disappear rapidly as the grafting reactions proceed. Most of the allyl radicals are 
trapped on surfaces of the crystallites, and only 10% of the radicals are trapped inside 
crystallitesI938). The reactivity of allyl radicals depends on their contact with reactive 
monomers. The rate of reaction is related to the concentration of vapour pressure of 
the monomers (Figure 9.1). 
Investigation of the grafting of methyl methacrylate i 935, 1938) and styrene2138, 
2159,2452) shows that the grafting reactions are preferentially initiated by allyl radi-
cals formed by the conversion of alkyl radicals. Seguchi and Tamura 1934, 1936, 1937) 
reported that alkyl radicals also initiate the grafting reactions, and the course of graft-
ing reaction is different for allyl and alkyl radicals. In the atmosphere of a grafting 
monomer, alkyl radicals trapped in the crystalline region migrate to reach the surface 
of the crystallite and then react with the surrounding monomer to produce propagat-
ing radicals. 
The effect of various solvents on the decay of alkyl radicals (Figure 9.2) and allyl 
radicals (Fig. 9.3) were investigated in detaill938, 2452).

9.2. Cellulose Graft Copolymers 
The acceleration of the decay of radicals by solvents may be ascribed to: 
1. The swelling of polyethylene, which facilitates the molecular motion of poly-
mer chains and enhances the probability of coupling, and 
2. Chain transfer in solvents. 
Styrene is the most effective in reducing alkyl radicals, probably because it reacts 
rapidly with polyethylene radicals and also because grafted polymer chains loosen 
the crystal structure mechanically, and enhance the mobility of polyethylene radicals 
trapped in the crystals, accelerating thus the coupling reactions. 
9.2. Cellulose Graft Copolymers 
Graft and block copolymers of cotton may be prepared by free radical-initiated graft-
ing of vinyl monomers to cellulose. In this way, the macromolecular, morphological, 
and textile properties of cotton may be modified. ESR studies of free radicals in 
graft polymerization of methacrylic acid386), ethyl acrylate I562), and styrene391 , 552, 
839,1220,1225,1804) on cotton cellulose were made. 
The ESR study of the grafting of vinyl monomers onto 'Y-irradiated cellulose 
shows the formation of living polymer radicals 72, 928). A typical ESR spectrum gener-
ated by trapped cellulosic radicals in 'Y-irradiated cotton cellulose is shown in Figure 
9.4a.

After treatment with aqueous solution of methacrylic acid (30 vol. %) for 3 min 
at 298 K, the ESR spectrum is changed (Fig. 9.4b). This spectrum is composed of a 
spectral component generated by propagating polymer radicals, and a component 
generated by trapped cellulose radicals located within the highly ordered regions of 
the macromolecules. The living polymer radical (9.1) can be generated as follows:

An interesting result was reported in the ESR study of grafting of acrylamide

detectable radicals. However, when solutions of monomers were photolysed in the 
presence of cotton cellulose, ESR spectra of propagating monomer radicals were 
recorded (Fig. 9.5). 
ESR study of grafting different monomers on cellulosic materials using redox 
systems was described76, 124). Hydroxy radicals generated by Fe2+-H202 in a flow 
system 76) (See Chap. 5.4) react with cellulose, giving free radicals which initiate graft 
polymerization of acrylonitrile. The triplet spectrum (Fig. 5.86) disappears during 
grafting and is replaced by two strong singlet spectra (Fig. 9.6).

The broader of the two singlet spectra was probably due to a radical generated 
on carbon C1 or C4 (5.112) by degradation of the cellulose molecule, and the other 
probably to one generated at the end of the growing polyacrylonitrile molecular 
chain. If the interpretation is correct, the absence of a triplet spectrum provides a 
direct proof of which way the acrylonitrile monomer is being grafted onto the cel-
lulose molecule. 
ESR spectroscopy has also been applied for study of photo-grafting of methyl 
methacrylate 1237, 1635, 2009), acrylamide, methacrylamide and diacetone and acryl-
amide 1240, 1828) and of ceric ion initiated grafting of acrylonitrile 74) onto cellulose. 
9.3. Miscellaneous Problems 
ESR spectroscopy was also used for the study of: photochemical grafting of methyl-
acrylamide on the surface of an hydro glucose triacetate film1240), ferric ion (Fe3+) 
sensitization of photo-initiated grafting of methyl methacrylate to poly(vinyl alco-
hol)1636).

9.3. Miscellaneous Problems 
It has been found that commercial thermostabilizers such as dibutyl-tin-methy-
lenebis( thioglycolate), dibutyl-tin-octylidenebis(thioglycolate), and dibutyl-tin-
dilaurate lower the extent of radiation-induced grafting of acrylonitrile and styrene 
on poly (vinyl chloride). ESR studies show that the tin compounds retard the decay 
of the free radicals produced by radiation in poly(vinyl chloride )1303).

ESR Studies of Crosslinking 
10.1. ESR Study of Enhanced Crosslinking of Polymers 
Enhanced crosslinking occurs via a chain reaction involving both a polymer and a 
monomer. An example of this reaction is the curing of an unsaturated polyester-
styrene mixture. The initiation of a chain reaction via a single radical allows the for-
mation of a sequence of crosslinks. An ESR study of enhanced crosslinking of poly-
olefins with acrylic acid438) and allyl ethers of Novolac with vinyl monomers in the 
presence of cationic catalysts was made I53l}. Using ESR Charlesby1l88) studied the 
role of S, Se and Te during radiation-induced crosslinking of polyethylene. 
10.2. ESR Study of Free Radicals Observed During the Curing of 
Unsaturated Polyester Resins 
The curing process of unsaturated polyester resins (free-radical copolymerization 
reactions between polyester fumarate and styrene) in a TiCI 3-H20 2 flow system 
was described by LehmusI333). The copolymerization proceeds with extensive cross-
linking and results in three-dimensional networks. Demrnler and Schlag532) have 
reported the importance of free radicals observed by ESR in the curing and stabiliza-
tion of polyester resins. 
10.3. ESR Study of the Vulcanization of Rubber 
The reaction mechanism is an important problem in rubber vulcanization. Extensive 
ESR studies were made on the interaction of tetramethylthiuram disulphide with 
rubber at 373-433 K in the vulcanization process232, 289,1416). The dissociation of 
tetramethylthiuran disulphide into radicals results in the formation of polymeric 
radicals. Their recombination produces three-dimensional structure (vulcanizates). 
Other ESR studies were also presented, namely: 'Y-induced vulcanization of 
rubber in the presence of sulphur 1284, 1293,2164,2165), retardation of prevulcaniza-
tion of rubber by N-nitrosodiphenylamine 1398), decomposition of vulcanization 
accelators2514), vulcanization mechanism of liquid thiocols by sodium bichromateI500), 
and reaction of hydro peroxide groups in rubber with phenothiazine 190).

10.4. ESR Spectra of Light-Irradiated Poly(vinyl cinnamate) 
The ESR spectrum of light. irradiated poly(vinyl cinnamate) at 77 K consists ofa 
broad singlet and a quartet (Fig. lO.I)lS61). 
Fig. 10.1. ESR spectrum of poly(vinyl cinnamate)

The quartet spectrum decayed rapidly when resin was kept in the dark, while 
the singlet remained almost constant and decayed only at higher temperature. The 
quartet was attributed to a main chain radical and the singlet to a crosslinked cin-
namoyl radical (J 0.1) produced by the light irradiation:

Application of Stable Free Radicals in Polymer 
Research 
Stable free radicals have been widely applied in the study of polymers. Three methods 
are commonly used: 
1. Spin-probe technique, 
2. Spin-trapping technique, 
3. Spin-labeling technique. 
These methods are mainly based on nitroxide radicals, which are highly stable 
in solid, and stable for many months in solution. 
11.1. Nitroxide radicals 
Nitroxide radicals as a class of stable organic free radicals were discovered in 
19561059,1846). From that time on the synthesis and properties of these radicals 
received increasing attention329, 351, 423, 524, 605, 650, 690, 818,1045,1114,1140,1259, 
1296,1336,1337,1402,1547,1548,1587,1586,1675, 1689, 1856-1859, 1861,2036,2076, 
2173,2310,2352) 
The most stable nitroxide radicals contain tertiary carbons bonded to the nitro-
gen, e.g. di-tert-butylnitroxide (11. 1)636, 953), 2,2-dimethyl-oxazoline derivatives 
(11.2)1105), pyrroline (11.3), and piperidine (11.4) nitroxides309, 1857):

At sufficiently high temperatures the nitroxide radicals show triplet ESR spectra 
with equal components of equal intensities, which were interpreted as being due to

11.1. Nitroxide radicals 
the coupling to the nuclear spins of the nitrogen atom479). Hyperfine splitting con-
stants (aN) of some nitroxide radicals are given in Table 11.1. 
When the nitroxide radicals are in solution of low viscosity, e.g. common organic 
solvents, as benzene at room temperature, rapid Brownian rotational motion occurs.

This results in the averaging of the isotropic g-value and the isotropic hyperfine 
coupling constant (a). With increasing temperature, the ESR spectrum shows a 
triplet line with equal components of equal intensities (Fig. 11.1). 
The time required for complete rotation of a nitroxide radical about its axis is 
called "the rotational correlation time" (r) and is 10- 11 < r < 10-6 s. The value

where: LlHpp is peak-to-peak width, and IpP_ 1 ' Ippo' Ipp+l are the measured peak-
to-peak amplitudes of three lines of ESR spectrum of nitroxide radical (Fig. 11.2). 
The values of C and C' are characteristic parameters for the nitroxide and the particu-
lar experimental conditions employed.

for determination of the rotational cor-
relation time (T) from ESR spectrum 

11.2. Spin-Probe Technique 
An analysis of the width of hyperfine lines provides information about the corre-
lation time for rotational diffusion when the solution is sufficiently diluted2076) 
or, alternatively, about translational diffusion coefficient for more concentrated 
solutions (> 10-3 M)1494). In viscous media the rotational motion is hindered and 
the tumbling rates of the molecules decrease. This gives an increase of the hyperfine 
coupling constants and a broadening of observed spectra. There are several methods 
for the calculation of rotational correlation time (7) and the tumbling rate from ESR 
spectra31, 155,317,338,717-719,787,991, 1139, 1140, 1197, 1440, 1627, 1751,2224,2374). 
11.2. Spin-Probe Technique 
The spin-probe technique has been applied to the study of interaction between 
several low molecular organic nitroxides and host polymers in which they are dis-
solved. By this method it is possible to study, using ESR spectroscopy, the mobility 
of the dissolved molecule in its microscopic environment. Several studies on the 
motions of nitroxide radicals in polymer matrix are known 1133, 1208, 1209, 1212, 1276, 
1347,1792,1793, 1904,2082-2086,2220,2224,2233,2353, 2484) 
Some of nitroxide radicals easily diffuse into various polymers 1212, 2083, 2085). 
It was found that spin-probe radicals are located in the amorphous phase of solid 
polymers2220, 2228, 2233). Since the glass-transition temperature (Tg) corresponds to 
the on-set of liquid-like translational motions of long segments of molecules in the 
amorphous phase, and the rotations of nitroxyl radicals are sensitive to changes of 
geometry of their surroundings, the rotational relaxations of probe radicals in poly-
mers at temperatures near T g can be measured. ESR spectra of polyethylene 
(Fig. 11.3) and poly(vinyl chloride) (Fig. 11.4) above the glass transition temperature 
(T g) containing nitroxide radicals (e.g. 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-hydroxy-piperidine-l-
oxyl benzoate (11.5)) show well-resolved triplet spectra.

The triplet-line spectrum shows a high degree of rotational motion of nitroxide 
radicals in the amorphous part of the polymer. During the freezing of polymer matrix 
a decrease of the mobility of nitroxide radicals and change of ESR spectra are ob-
served. From these spectra it is possible to calculate the rotational correlation time 
offree radical (7) (11.1). 
The rotational correlation time (7) obey the Arrhenius law:

The rotational activation energy of free radical rotation (Ea) does not depend 
on the size of the radical, but only on the properties of the polymer matrix1212). 
This means that the radical rotation frequency is determined by the mobility of the 
polymer segments. 
Kusumoto et al. 1276) studied, with the aid of the spin-probe method, the chain

At low temperatures the spectra have a broad line-shape suggesting that the 
polymer matrix is in a rigid state. When the temperature is raised, a small sub splitting 
appears, because a part of the chain in the probe begins to rotate sufficiently to cause 
a change in the hyperfine pattern. 
Spin-probe was also applied using polybutadiene and polyisoprene for the study 
of Overhauser effect, i.e. the dipole-dipole interaction between unpaired free radical 
electrons and protons1346, 1348). 
Spin-probe technique has also been applied for a study of polymer-plasticizer 
interactions2219). The rotational correlation time (r) of probe radicals in plasticized 
poly(vinyl chloride) at 298 K decreases strongly when the amount of plasticizer is 
increased. 
Rabold 1792) measured the interaction of sodium dodecyl sulphate with styrene-
butadiene latices by using the spin-probe technique. By this method, it is possible 
to detect quantitatively the presence of micelles in a latex. A spin-probe method 
was also applied to study the critical micelle concentration of potassium palmitate2221) 
and the dynamic structure of dimethyl sulphoxide-water mixture 339). 
Nitrogen dioxide was used as a paramagnetic probe for examination of the 
molecular motion in rigid polymers at temperatures below the glass-transition tem-
perature2351). 
Several papers260, 1246, 1793, 2220) described determinations of the glass-transi-
tion temperatures by the spin-probe technique. 
Readers may find several other applications of spin probe in polymer chemistry 
in original papers1173, 1210, 1211, 1292, 1949,2353).

11.3. Spin-Trapping Technique 
This technique has been used for the detection and identification of short-lived free 
radicals by the ESR spectra of nitroxyl addition products (spin adducts) of free radi-
cals (R-) to nitroso or nitrone compounds ("spin traps,,)673, 1046, 1049, 1294, 1728). 
This technique was mostly applied to liquid solutions using 2-nitroso-2-methyl 
propane (t-butyl-nitroxide) (11. 7), nitrosobenzene (11.8), or phenyl-N-tert-butyl-
nitrone (11.9) as spin trap for radical (R'):

Nitrogen and proton hyperfine splittings of the spin adducts are diagnostic para-
meters for the identification of the radical spin-adduct formed. 
Possible application of the spin-trapping technique to quantitative studies was 
discussed by Janzen et al.1048} and Perkins et al. I729} who have reported a success-
ful kinetic analysis of the decomposition of benzoyl peroxide in solution in the 
presence of phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (11. 9). 
The spin-trapping technique was applied to study radical polymerization424, 1165, 
1249, 1250, 1900}. Kunitake and Murakami 1249, 1250} have presented a detailed study 
of the spin-trapping method. They used 2-nitroso-2-methyl propane (11.7) and 
phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (11.9) for an ESR study of radical polymerization of 
different monomers, e.g. methyl methacrylate, styrene, vinyl acetate, acrylonitrile, 
butadiene, and isoprene. The reaction was initiated by thermal decomposition of azo-
bis(isobutyronitrile )(AIBN), di-tert-butyl peroxalate or bis( 4-tert-butylcyclohexyl)-
peroxy dicarbonate.

The ESR spectrum obtained for the polymerization mixture AIBN-styrene-2-
nitroso-2-methyl-propane at 343 K1250) is shown in Figure 11.7. 
This spectrum consists of the three-line spectrum and the six-line line spectrum 
which were attributed to the trapped initiating (11.10) and propagating radicals 
(J 1.12), respectively:

The main problem in the spin-trapping method applied to polymerization is the 
considerable change of the ESR spectrum of the examined system with time. For 
example, in the system discussed above, after 30 min the presence of radicals (11.12) 
was only indicated. After further heating at 343 K, the peak intensity decreased, and 
after 90 min the peak could no more be detected. 
The application of the spin-trapping method to a living anionic polymerization 
system was reported by Forrester and Hepburn 709). 
Especially interesting is the application of the spin-trapping method to the study 
of alternating copolymerization2453). The spin-trapping reagent used is 2,3,6-tri-t-
butylnitrosobenzene (11.13)2173), which can react with small-sized radicals giving 
radicals (11.14), while the bulky radicals are trapped in the form of radicals (11.15):

system were trapped by 2,3,6-tri-t-butylnitrosobenzene (11.13) and are shown as 
ESR spectra in Figure 11.8. 
Both types of spin-adducts (11.14) and (J 1.15) of methyl radicals derived from 
triethylaluminium were detected (Fig. II.8a). The trapping of methyl radical as 
(11.15) type adduct shows the existence of some steric hindrance in the surroundings 
of methyl radicals by the aluminium atom or other components in this catalytic

system. The detection of "sterically hindered methyl radicals" shows the possibility 
of coordinated methyl radical formation. 
In the presence of ethylene, the ESR spectra change (Fig. 11.8b). This ESR 
spectrum was assigned to (11.15) type adduct of primary radical derived from propa-
gation ethylene, while (J 1.14) type adduct of free radical shows no change at all. 
When vinyl acetate monomer was introduced to the system, the new ESR spectrum 
was obtained (Fig. 11.8c), in which neither (11.14) nor (11.15) type adducts of 
methyl radical were observed. Instead, radical adducts (J 1.14) and (11.15), derived 
from vinyl acetate propagating radicals, were detected. ESR spectra of spin· trapped 
compounds in the presence of ethylene and vinyl acetate are as shown in Figure 
11.8 d, and were attributed to free propagation vinyl acetate radical and hindered 
ethylene and vinyl acetate radicals. This result shows the participation of "hindered 
radicals" in the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymerization by coordination radicals2453). 
11.4. Spin-Labeling Technique 
The spin-labeling technique is a simple way to extend the application of ESR spectros· 
copy to diamagnetic polymeric systems which do not contain unpaired electrons. 
Organic chemistry provides methods of synthetizing different nitroxide radicals 
which may be bound to natural and synthetic polymers: 
1. By weak: intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophilic inter-
action. 
2. By formation of chemical (covalent) bonds in the reaction of a polymer group 
with an R-group in the nitroxide radicals. Such groups are hydroxyl, carboxyl, 
cyano, isocyanate, meleimide, hydroxy-imino groups, etc. 
Line-width measurements on the ESR spectra of macromolecules carrying stable 
nitroxide radicals may give information on the dynamics of the polymer chain 343, 
348,2224). It has been found that in pure polymers there is no Significant difference 
between rotational rates of free radicals (spin-probes) and bonded radicals (spin-
labels)2223). This fact indicates that bonded radicals rotate quite freely around the 
C-O bond and that in viscous polymer matrices the rotational frequencies of the 
whole polymer molecule are very slow as compared to the local mode relaxations. 
The situation changes rapidly in dilute solutions. Theory of the rotational relaxation 
process in the range of rapid rotations (7 = 10-11 - 10-9 s) was presented in 
papers94, 1140). Comparison of rotational frequencies of spin-labeled macromolecules 
in different polymer matrices shows appreciable effects of the surrounding physical 
environment348, 585, 2223). 
The spin-labeling technique was originally applied to biological macromole-
cules214, 314, 739, 820, 859, 906,1065,1075,1443,1537,1716,1907) and then extended 
to the synthetic polymers such as: 
polyethylene351, 1801, 1947), 
poly(methyl vinyl ketone )350), 
poly(methyl methacrylate)343, 819, 820, 1996), 
polystyrene32, 342, 345-349, 573),

This spectrum changes with temperature and it is analyzed to detennine long

the melting point (about 383 K for low density polyethylene) the spectrum shows 
three narrow lines (Fig. 11.11).

In solution at 370 K, where anisotropic effects are largely averaged out, the 
three-line spectrum characteristic for nitroxide radicals is formed (Fig. 11.12). 
As it was shown in Chapter 11.1 the rotational correlation time (T) may be 
calculated from these ESR spectra348).

For solid polyethylene the ESR spectra revealed the following general relaxation 
processes: 
1. a-relaxation in the range 300-308 K is attributed to large-scale reorientations 
of polymer chains within the crystalline regions. 
2. ~relaxation is attributed to cooperative segmental motions in the amorphous 
phase in the range 220-300 K 
3. 'Y-relaxation in the range 140-180 K is attributed to small-scale processes 
involving crankshaft-type motions of methylene segments.

The activation energies for these processes, determined by the study of dielectric 
and mechanical relaxation, are> 100,65-100 and 45-60 kJ mol-I, respectively 1 444).

The polymer contains approximately one nitroxide radical centre (11.17) per

the solubility of the mercurated polystyrene is low and the intermediate nitro so 
polystyrene is unstable. A better method for synthesis of spin-labeled polystyrene

The ESR spectrum of the spin-labeled polystyrene (11.17) in solution is shown 
in Figure 11.13. 
A triplet-line spectrum with an intensity ratio of approximately 1: 1 : 1 is ob-

1. The low field and central components of the triplet have further splittings due 
to interaction with the aromatic protons.

2. The line-width depends on the magnetic quantum number MI of the 14N 
nucleus. 
Figure 11.14 shows an ESR spectrum of spin-labeled polystyrene (11.17) in the 
solid state. 
Fig. 11.14. ESR spectrum of the solid 
spin-labelled polystyrene at room tem-
perature342) 
The outermost peaks arise from radicals oriented in such a way that the axis of 
1T-orhital is parallel to the applied magnetic field. 
From line-width measurements of randomly labeled polystyrene in toluene solu-
tion, the rotational correlation time (r) and activation energy (Ea) for segmental 
rotation have been calculated342, 348). As the molecular weight decreases, the rota-
tional frequency of the whole macromolecule increases348). 
The dependence of the rotational correlation times on solvent properties and 
polymer concentrations have been examined349). On account of the higher viscosity 
of a-chloronaphthalene and the poor solvent properties of cyclohexane, the rota-
tional correlation time (r) is greater in cyclohexane and a-chloronaphthalene than 
in toluene. In high molecular weight polymer samples, segmental reorientation is the 
main relaxation process. Its activation energy is 25.1 ± 0.8 kJ mol- 1 in cyclohexane 
and 26.4 ± 1.3 kJ mol- 1 in a-chloronaphthalene, as compared with 18.0 ± 0.8 kJ 
mol- 1 in toluene. The internal energy barriers to rotation were calculated to be 
8.8 kJ mol- 1 in toluene and a-chloronaphthalene and 12.6 kJ mol- 1 in cyclohexane. 
The higher internal barrier to segmental rotation in cyclohexane is probably due to a 
more tightly coiled conformation of the polymer chains in this poor solvent. The 
rotational correlation time (r) increases slowly with polymer concentration up to a 
critical value, beyond which r rises steeply. The critical concentration is close to the 
"entanglement" concentration as obtained by viscosity measurements. 
End-labeled addition polymers can be prepared by reacting "living" polymeric 
anions with 2-nitroso-2-methylpropane (11. 7) and then oxidizing the resulting

the dependence of line-width upon MN , the 1~ nucleus. This permits the evaluation 
of the rotational correlation time in end nitroxide-Iabeled poly(methyl methacrylate) 
(11.19), e.g. T = 2.8 x 10-10 s for poly(methyl methacrylate (Mv = 80000) in ethyl 
acetate solution (5% wt.) at 298 K343). 
Spin-labeling technique has also been applied to investigation of other problems, 
such as 
1. Study of the role of surface dispersion of bronzes in contact with polyiso-
butylene and polyurethanes during mechanical degradation in the friction process 794). 
2. Study of micelle solutions, in particular evaluating the critical micelle concen-
tration2374). 
3. Determining the ratio of the number of segments in loops to the number in 
trains along the surface for polymers absorbed at the solid/liquid interface 710,1843).

11.4. Spin-Labeling Technique 
Spin-labels attached to looped portions of the polymer are more mobile than those 
attached to trains, and the ESR spectra from the two sites are different. 
4. Study of bimolecular recombination, which is a diffusion-controlled process. 
It is well known that the rate constants of termination reactions depend upon such 
factors as solution viscosity, chain fleXibility, and molecular interactions between 
polymer and solvent. For investigation of these processes the spin-labeled method 
was successfully applied. The dependence of exchange rate constants and diffusion 
coefficients of stable macroradicals on the length of polymer chains in various sol-
vents was investigated, el for end nitroXide modified poly( dimethyl siloxane) and 
poly(ethylene oXide)1963 .

Chapter 12 
ESR Spectroscopy of Stable Polymer Radicals 
and their Low Molecular Analogues 
New types of stable polymer radicals and polyradical anions have been studied with 
increasing attention during the last few years. These polymers have interesting elec-
trical properties and radical reactions, and are, in practise, useful as antioxidants and 
semiconductors. These types of polymers were reviewed in detail by Braun262, 281}. 
The majority of stable polymer radicals have precursors consisting of low-molecular 
stable free radicals. In this chapter ESR spectra for low-molecular and polymer stable 
radicals are compared. 
12.1. Poly(triphenylmethyl) Radicals 
The precursor for this type of polyradicals is the well known and important triphenyl-
methyl free radical, which was investigated in detail by ESR spectroscopy1512, 1516, 
1517). Poly-carbon radicals of the triphenyl type were synthesized by polymerization 
of vinyltriphenylmethylcarbinol (12.1). The poly(p-vinyltriphenylmethylcarbinol) 
(12.2) reacts with acetyl chloride in benzene chloride and forms poly(p-vinyltriphenyl-
methyl chloride) (12.3), which in a subsequent reaction with zinc-potassium gives 
poly(p-vinyltriphenylmethyl) (12.4) radicals262, 265, 267, 276).

In contrast to low-molecular weight triphenylmethyl radicals, the corresponding 
polyradicals give an ESR spectrum with a weakly resolved hyperfine singlet structure 
(Fig. 12.1)267). 
This was attributed to the high local concentration of the radicals in macro-
molecular coils and to their interaction, as well as to very small coupling parameters 
of triphenylmethyl radicals.

The complete synthesis of this compound is described by Poirier et al. 1750) and 
Tlidos et a1.2309). DPPH crystallized from CS2 or CHC13 interacts with O2 giving 
broadening of the absorption line40). This reaction does not occur in benzene solu-
tion. For that reason DPPH should be crystallized from benzene and sealed in vacuum 
or in an inert gas. DPPH is photolyzed easily by VV-light 1750,2097,2098,2403), and 
it should, therefore, be stored in the dark. Under ionizing irradiation DPPH is decom-
posed at the same rate both in vacuum and in presence of air2471). At low initial con-
centration of DPPH in solution (solid or liquid), the decomposition is accelerated in 
the presence of air. DPPH has been the subject of many ESR studies60, 114, 197,311, 
449,459,516,523,654,744,746,748,831,860,955,957,981,994,1125,1178,1198,1213, 
1332,1386,1413,1430,1555,1838,1871,2235,2315,2345). ESR study of the water-soluble 
stable free radical p,p-disulpho-ex.,ex.'-diphenyl-(3-picrylhydrazyl (SDPPH) (a sulphon-
ated analogue of DPPH) has also been reported 1 77 3). 
DPPH stable radicals in solution produce spectra changing from a single sharp 
line for solids, to a broad line for concentrated solutions. Hyperfine structure appears 
in diluted solution831, 994) (Fig. 12.6). 
DPPH in benzene solution has a quintet-line spectrum with an overall line width 
of approximately 60 G (Fig. 12.7). 
The ESR measurements in solution are considerably affected by dissolved oxygen. 
The majority of air-saturated organic solvents contain oxygen in the order of 10-3 
mole 1-1, and this concentration is equivalent to 1018 spins cm-3 879, 2346). 
DPPH shows differences in observed line-width of ESR spectra, when measured 
in different solvents523, 2318} and polymer solutions 733). Differences in ESR spectra 
are also observed for DPPH crystallized from different solvents40) (Table 12.1). 
The DPPH in polymer matrix, e.g. in poly(methyl methacrylate), shows a poorly 
resolved five-line spectrum with the width of approximately 120 G, as shown in 
Figure 12.8. 
The broadening is caused by the anisotropic hyperfine structure, in addition to 
the isotropic hyperfine structure due to the rigidity of the polymer2471). DPPH in 
polystyrene matrix shows an exponential, rather than a Gaussian shape, for the 
wings of the exchange-narrowed lines493). In Table 12.2, g-values for DPPH deter-
mined by various authors are given.

Polycrystalline DPPH sample has a g-value of 2.0036 (gil = 2.0028 and g.L = 
2.0039)2454). Differences in the g-value for single crystals may occur, because the 
number of spins in crystal samples depends on the solvent used for the growing of 
the crystaI1505). The ESR lines of DPPH in the whole temperature range from 293 K 
to 1.7 K have Lorentzian shape2347). ESR spectra and their characteristics for dif-
ferent analogues of DPPH have been collected by Braun et a1.263) and are shown in 
Table 12.3. 
Hyde et a1.994) used the ELDOR technique to study solutions of DPPH, and ob-
tained precise values for the hyperfine coupling of the main nitrogens No< and Nfl. 
The high resolution of the ENDOR technique was utilized to obtain precise values 
for the 12 proton hyperfine couplings (Fig. 12.9) and to estimate the various N 
hyperfme couplings in solutions of DPPH502). 
Application of ENDOR spectra helps to explain the rather complex ESR spectra 
of DPPH. 
Osugi and Sasaki 1678) reported an ESR study of the photochemical reaction 
between DPPH and methyl methacrylate.

Polyvinyl-DPPH was first obtained by Henglein and Boysen908) by 'Y-irradiation 
of high polymers in the presence of DPPH. In this way groups were incorporated into 
the main chain, being connected by one of the two phenyl groups (12.11) or the 
picryl group (12.12): 
(12.11) 
(12.12) 
ESR spectra of polyvinyl-DPPH in tetrahydrofuran are shown in Figure 12.10. 
Ovenall1864) prepared the polymeric hydrazyl radical by polymerization of 
methyl methacrylate in the presence of DPPH. The polymer contained oxidizable 
N-H bonds, and upon oxidation gave polymer molecules containing free radicals 
with the ESR spectra identical to those of DPPH. Polystyrene radicals do not react 
with DPPH by this mechanism.

A new method for synthesis of polyvinyl-DPPH was described by Braun et

12.5. Polymers Containing Stable Free Radicals of the Nitroxide Type 
Formation of nitroxide stable free polymer radicals (12.17) have been observed 
during thermal oxidation of amine-terminated polyamides (nylon 6)451). The ESR 
spectra of these nitroxide radicals are shown in Figure 12.11.

A one-line ESR spectrum can be observed for nonterminated, and acid-terminate, 
polyarnides heated in the presence of air. This singlet was attributed to conjugated 
systems with unpaired electrons451, 803). 
Several other polymers containing nitroxide groups were synthesized by polymer-
analogous reactions and a few were synthesized by polycondensation of polyaddition 
reactions573, 549, 819,1691,1860). 
By oxidation of the poly-Nee 4-diphenylarnino )acryl with Pb02, a stable poly-N-
(4-diphenylnitroxyl) radical (12.18) is obtained268), and its ESR spectra are shown 
in Figure 12.12.

Compared with monomeric nitroxyl compounds, the ESR spectra of nitroxyl 
polymers show different behavior. In Figure 12.13 spectra are shown for nitroxyl 
polymers of the amide type, which were prepared by the oxidation of polymeric 
precursor for 2 hr and 30 hr respectively.

at room temperature, a. oxidation

The characteristic feature of these spectra is that the triplet fine structure of 
N-O' radical, formed at the initial stage of the oxidation, becomes broadened and 
is finally merged into a singlet as the oxidation proceeds. The reason for the broaden-
ing and change to a singlet may be considered to be either the rate or the anisotropy 
of the spin-spin coupling. As the free radical density along the polymer chains in-
328 

12.5. Polymers Containing Stable Free Radicals of the Nitroxide Type 
creases on oxidation, the increased possibility of spin-spin interaction tends to 
reduce the transition time from the excited to the ground state of spins. This effect 
may cause the broadening of the triplet lines to a singlet. 
In the case of copolymers of (12.19) with styrene or methyl methacrylate, the 
ESR spectra are retained as triplets and do not merge into broad singlets during 
oxidation (Fig. 12.14).

ture1259) 
In these copolymers, the nitroxyl radicals formed by oxidation are incapable of 
interacting with each other in long sequences, because the distribution density of 
the radicals along the polymer chains is lowered by the presence of nonradical co-
monomer units. Consequently, the triplet signals were also observed after prolonged 
oxidation (60 hr). 
A polymer containing nitronyl and nitroxyl groups, poly [4-(4',4',S',S'-tetra-

Miura et al. 1 508) recorded the anionic polymerization of 1,5-diphenyl-3-
(p-vinylphenyl) verdazyl (12. 29) and copolymerization of this monomer with styrene 
and methyl methacrylate. The polymerization of verdazyl monomer needs an excess 
of anionic initiators (n-butyllithium or sodium naphthalene), suggesting the forma-
tion of an intermediate organometallic compound (12.30) and radical (R):

weights of about 2000, with radical contents up to 60% of the theoretically possible.

naphthalene). The polymer is a dark green powder, soluble in dimethy1formamide 
and tetrahydrofuran but insoluble in benzene, acetone, and methanol. The ESR 
spectrum of the monomer shows a hyperfine structure of 9 lines, whereas the spec-
trum of the polymeric product shows one broad absorption (Fig. 12.22).

Polymeric ketyls (12.43) may initiate the polymerization of acrylonitrile, methyl 
methacrylate, and 4-vinylpyridine. Braun et al.275) have reported graft copolymeriza-
tion with these polyradical anions. 
With metals, Schiff bases give polyradical anions (12.44) 1842) which may initiate 
the polymerization of acrylonitrile:

Polymeric azocompounds with alkali metals also give polyradical anions of the 
type (12.45)264).

Copolymers of p-vinyl-trans-stilbene and styrene in reaction with sodium in 
tetrahydrofuran gives deeply colored polyradical anion (12.46)271).

This polyradical anion initiates the polymerization of acrylonitrile, methyl 
methacrylate, and styrene by an electron transfer mechanism. When styrene is used, 
"living polymers" are formed.

The interpretation of ESR spectra of the radical anion (12.49) encountered 
several substantial difficulties; temperature and concentration dependences, inability 
to obtain good spectrum, overlapping spectra, and other gross effects that might be 
expected from multiple reduction sites within a single polymer molecule.

12.11. Organic Polymeric Semiconductors 
Polymers with high electrical conductivity and semiconducting properties were first 
prepared in 1958-1960 in the USSR. Polymeric semiconductors have a different 
structure from other polymers. The macromolecules of these polymers usually coo-
tain alternating systems of double, triple, or cumulative bonds, which bind two 
carbon atoms: C=C, C=C, C=C=C=C, carbon and nitrogen: C=N, two nitrogen atoms 
N=N, benzene rings, etc. (see Table 12.4)1720,1746,2412).

12. ESR Spectroscopy of Stable Polymer Radicals Anions, and Their Low Molecular Analogues 
All of these semiconductor polymers contain unpaired electrons which give a 
narrow ESR signal, characteristic for polyconjugated polymer radicals. Figure 12.26 
shows, for example, the ESR spectrum of poly(phenylacetylene) in xylene with a 
well-resolved structure. 
10 G 
Fig. 12.26. ESR spectrum of polyphenyl-
acetylene in xylene (11.1 wt.%) at 
393 K614) 
The spectrum shows over 40 resolvable lines, which are approximately equally 
spaced about 1 G apart. The g-value is 2.0061 ± 0.00010427, 614). The symmetry of 
the hyperfine structure indicates the presence of a single paramagnetic species, and 
the even number of lines at least one odd-numbered set of equivalent protons. The 
large number of lines suggests that the unpaired electron interacts with more than 
one phenyl ring and the g-value agrees with that of hydrocarbon 1T-electron radical, 
in which the spin is delocalized over three aromatic ringsI930). The g-value is distinctly 
different from that of an oxygen-centered free radical, indicating that the paramag-
netism arises from the pure polymer, and not from its interaction with oxygen. 
Different theories of the origin of ESR spectra in semiconductor polymers have 
been reviewed in detail by KryszewskiI232), whereas the relation between ESR 
spectra and electric conductivity of polymers has been reviewed by Ehrlich612) and 
Russian scientistsI355). Readers may fmd the synthesis, properties, and ESR spectra

12. ESR Spectroscopy of Stable Polymer Radicals Anions, and Their Low Molecular Analogues 
It has been found that the carbonizing temperature substantially affects the 
number and types of free radicals formed. For all polymers reported, the peak con-
centration develops at temperatures of 623-933 K, and the spin centres frequently 
disappear at 973-1173 K. Figure 12.27 shows the ESR spectrum of polyacrylonitrile 
pyrolized at 673 K. 
The typical single line for pyrolized polymers has not yet been interpreted.

12.13. Free Radicals in Carbon Black 
Studies of paramagnetic properties of carbon blacks have been reported by several 
authors56, 66, 412, 442, 443, 526-530, 593, 747,1538-1540,1540,1584,1688). In carbon 
blacks, the initially present radicals are fairly stable up to 773-873 K, but higher 
temperatures cause a rapid decrease of the spin concentration to a minimum at 
1273-1673 K468). Above 1673 K to 3273 K radicals reappear406, 407, 468, 910,1081, 
2016,2060). The ESR spectra of these carbons treated at high temperature differ little

in appearance from those treated at lower temperature. Treatment at very high tem-
peratures (>2273 K) gives ESR spectra with increasing asymmetry. 
Oxygen affects both the radical yield and the spectrum of observed free radi-
calsSO• 868.1136.1743) (Figure 12.28). 
The line-width of about 15 G for carbon black measured in air is reduced to 
about 7 G when the sample is evacuated, and broadens to at least twice the air value 
when oxygen is introduced to the evacuated sample. The concentration of radicals 
remains constant and only the line-width changesS71). The width also varies con-
siderably from one material to another and with sample preparation and environment. 
A correlation between concentration of unpaired electrons in carbon black and 
the reinforcing properties of carbon black in the rubber vulcanization process were 
also investigated by ESR spectroscopy618. 727.1110.2061). An ESR study of stable 
macroradical complexes from polymers such as poly(n-butyl methacrylate) and 
,?oly(vinyl butyral) and carbon black has been made444).

ESR Study of lon-Exchange Resins 
ESR spectroscopy was also applied to the study of elementary processes in ion-
exchangers 783,784,1601). The exhaustive drying of sulphonated polystyrene-based 
ion-exchange resins produces free-radical centers (Fig. 13.1)'83). The radicals disap-
pear (a decrease by a factor of more than 100) upon wetting the resin and reappear 
on drying. 
H

XL ion exchange resin in: a. the ultra-dry state and 
b. under the saturation absorption conditions783) 
The reversibility of the appearance of the ESR signal upon drying and wetting 
may be interpreted as being due to the location of the spins. When the free spins 
appear at relatively inflexible sites, recombination may occur almost quantitatively 
on reabsorption of water. The role of water in this reversible process suggests further 
that the radicals may be located near ionic sites, where maximum stresses and local 
changes of dimensions are expected to arise as hydration of -S03H functions occurs. 
When about four molecules of water per -S03H group were absorbed in the resin, 
the free-spin concentration decreased from 1016_1017 to about 1014 spins g-1 and 
remained on that level with further increase of water absorption. 
The line-shapes ofESR spectra ofMn2+ ions on sulphonated polystyrene-based ion-
exchange resin change also when the degree of hydration and the temperature are 
varied784). ESR spectroscopy has also been applied to study the state of copper ions 
in a sulphonic resin2367), and the migration of Mn2+ ions in zeolites of the type NaA, 
NaX and Na y1749). 
ESR study of the effect of 'Y-irradiation on ion-exchange resins was made by 
Basinski et al.1380). Radiolysis of Zerolit FF-IP, a strongly basic polystyrene iso-
porous anion exchange resin, reveals two types of free radicals. One of them was 
formed from the skeleton of the resin. It gave a narrow resonance line in the spec-
trum, which was probably due to an oxide or peroxide radical produced by oxidation 
of the polystyrene chain. The second kind of radical gave a wider resonance line,

and was probably formed in the functional group zone of the resin. The recombina-
tion rate of the second type was much faster than that of the first type. The radical 
formed in the functional group zone was less stable in the presence of air. 
ESR study of free radicals formed in 'Y-irradiated and UV-irradiated cation-
exchange resin was reported by Russian scientists1079• 1281).
