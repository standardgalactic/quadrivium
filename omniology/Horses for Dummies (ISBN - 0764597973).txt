The truth of the matter is that as simple as riding may seem, it’s anything but.
Here’s why: With most other hobbies, your main component is something
rather undynamic. For example, the racket and ball you use to play tennis,
or the clubs and balls you require for golf. Without human energy to put
these pieces into motion, they’re nothing but unfeeling, unmoving, inanimate
objects.
Horseback riding, on the other hand, relies crucially on something that is
hardly passive in the process: the horse. Horses have the ability to operate
on their own — they don’t need a human to set them in motion. This fact is
not only true of the equine body, but it’s especially true of the equine mind.
So why do you need this book? Because we can help you understand the
horse and how it functions, both physically and mentally. Because we can
show you how to communicate what you want to a horse so he’ll do your 
bidding. And because we can show you how to care for this amazing crea-
ture, which, by the way, needs much more maintenance than your average
set of golf clubs!
After you’re comfortable with the basics of horsemanship, you’ll likely be
hooked on horses for good. Then you’ll be hungry to explore the world of
horses in even greater depth. But to get acquainted with things equine, you’ve
come to the right place. Whether you’re contemplating riding a horse for the
first time in your life, thinking about adding riding to your list of hobbies, or
wondering how to care for your first horse, we’re certain this book will be a
great help you.

About This Book
We’ve designed the second edition of Horses For Dummies to be a useful refer-
ence for beginning horse people. You can turn to any section of the book that
interests you and begin reading at that point — and not feel lost. You don’t have
to remember what you read yesterday, and you don’t have to read chapters or
sections in order. Just find something that interests you, read it, do it, and put
the book back on your shelf. We don’t expect you to read it from cover to cover.
If Horses For Dummies were a building, it would be a department store that
you can enter on whatever floor you like. You don’t have to walk past that
smelly perfume counter to get to the housewares section on the third floor.
You just walk into the housewares section.
Of course, you can feel free to read this book from cover to cover to avoid
missing one pearl of horse wisdom (or horse sense) that we’ve painstakingly
compiled for you. You won’t hear us say nay to that!
We’ve worked long and hard to bring you what we think is the consummate
beginner’s reference book on horses, and we hope that you find it as fun to
read as we found it to write. We also hope that you take all of our advice and
thank us for the rest of eternity for all the equine wisdom we’ve brought you.
Seriously, though, we’ve found great joy, comfort, and fulfillment in our personal
involvement with horses, and we hope for you the same kind of experience.
We’re certain that once you dive deep into the ocean of horseness, you’ll
never try to make it to shore.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, we refer to horses with the male pronoun (he, his, and him).
We understand that horses aren’t all male, and we don’t prefer male horses
to female horses particularly (coauthor Audrey Pavia is actually partial to
mares). This convention is merely for readability’s sake. We don’t call
horses “it” (not our horses!), and using both sexes (“his or her,” “he or she,”
and so on) makes the text hard to read. So we flipped a coin: It came up
heads — he.
We also include the following conventions to help you navigate this book:
 Italic text highlights defined terms.
 Boldfaced text highlights keywords in bulleted lists and the action part
of numbered steps.
 Monofont text highlights a Web address.

Horses For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

What You’re Not to Read
From time to time in this book, we tell you stuff that may be nice to know, but
isn’t essential to understanding the topic. In these cases, we place the text in
a gray box that we call a sidebar. Don’t feel like you have to read these, but
they’re usually kind of interesting, nonetheless.
Foolish Assumptions
In this book, we assume that you know a horse when you see one. That’s
really about all we assume. Well, we do assume that you’re interested in these
magnificent creatures and that you want to treat them kindly. You may be
considering buying a horse or learning how to ride one, or perhaps you’re
currently a horse owner and/or rider and would like to find out more about
these wonderful animals.
We also assume that you’re no dummy. You may not be an expert in the horse
field, but you’re not one to go around pretending that you are. You know that
the best way to find out about things is to read up, ask questions of those
who’ve been around the block, and keep your eyes open. We think you’re
pretty smart; after all, you bought this book, didn’t you?
How This Book Is Organized
The second edition of Horses For Dummies is made up of five parts. That’s
a lot of parts, but you need a lot of information to get started with horses.
The following sections look at each of these parts and what they cover.
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics
To fit in with the horsy crowd, you need to know equine basics. You need to
know head from tail, a trot from a canter, a star from a blaze, and withers from
a fetlock. You also need to have a good idea of how the horse sees the world,
and humankind.
In Part I, we give you some background on the human/horse relationship over
time and show you the parts of the horse and how to evaluate them. We also
get into specific details about horse colors, markings, and gaits, and spend
quite a bit of time helping you understand equine behavior — something you
absolutely have to know if you’re going to spend any amount of time around
horses. We finish Part I with a chapter devoted to the various breeds of horses.

Introduction

Part II: Selecting a Horse and 
the Stuff that Goes with Him
Buying a horse can be a daunting experience, especially if you don’t know
what you’re doing. The wrong decision can mean an unpleasant and costly
situation — one that will sour you on horses for good.
If you’re thinking about buying a horse, Part II is the place for you. In this part,
we help you decide whether horse ownership is really for you at this time in
your life, or whether leasing or taking lessons are better options. If you’re
certain you’re ready to commit to horse ownership, then read here about age
and gender differences before you buy. Our details on where and how to buy
your horse should prove pretty helpful, too.
A horse isn’t the only thing you need to be able to ride. If you plan to own
your own horse, you’ll have to get yourself some tack, grooming equipment,
riding apparel, and, oh yeah, a place to keep the animal. Go to Part II for the
lowdown on all this stuff and more.
If you aren’t ready to buy a horse yet but just want to ride, you still need to
take a look at Chapter 6. The information on tack, grooming equipment, and
riding apparel is relevant to anyone who rides a horse.
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse
If you’ve made the commitment to horse ownership — or are planning to —
Part III is very important to you. In these chapters, we give you all the basic
information you need to take care of your horse. That includes advice on
grooming, providing preventative veterinary care, recognizing common 
ailments, and figuring out exactly what to do with your horse when it’s
time to part.
Part III is not only for those who own their own horse; the information here
on grooming and recognizing common health problems also is important to
anyone interested in horse care.
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease
The payoff for all the hard work you’re doing with your horse comes in Part
IV: riding! Here, we give you details on how to handle your horse while you’re
on the ground and in the saddle. We show you how to put on the saddle and
bridle, how to mount and dismount, and how to hold the reins. And we give
you a rundown of the different riding disciplines and alert you to the various
safety issues concerning horses and riding. We also break down the different
4
Horses For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

types of equine competitions, and detail the myriad fun, noncompetitive
activities out there for those who ride.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In the Part of Tens, we tackle two very different subjects: equine myths and
horse movies. In the equine myths chapter, we strive to debunk various
untruths about horses that have pervaded our culture in recent decades. In
the movies chapter, we take a look at ten of the best horse movies ever made.
Appendix
The horse world is filled with clubs and associations that can help you learn
even more about horses than what you’ve gleaned from this book. The appen-
dix provides contact information for a number of these organizations, including
their Web sites. We’ve also added a section on recommended reading, where
you can delve even deeper into some of the horsy subjects touched upon in
this book, and other sections on equipment and publications.
Icons Used in This Book
As with all the other books in the For Dummies series, this book has little
icons in the margins that call your attention to specific types of information.
Here’s an explanation of what each of those icons means:
Procedures in the horse world may not seem to make much sense at times, yet
they’re written in stone and people always follow them. This icon indicates
these types of procedures.
This icon appears frequently throughout this book. That’s because when it comes
to horses, you need to do plenty of remembering. We’ve placed this icon next to
information that we think is important and shouldn’t be missed or forgotten.
This icon alerts you to helpful hints regarding horses, pertaining to their care
and handling. If you read the information so highlighted in this book, you’ll
find your life around horses much easier.
When you see this symbol, beware! It indicates something serious to watch
out for.

Introduction

Where to Go from Here
Go wherever you want. You can start at Chapter 1 and read all the way through
to the appendix if you want. Or, you can skip here and skip there. Or you can
go for a ride.
If you’re going to do the skipping around thing, though, can we at least ask
you to do us a favor? Before you start jumping from place to place, take a few
moments to read through Chapter 2, which gives you insights into the equine
mind. These issues are what every potential horseperson should know.
Go ahead! Start hoofin’ it!

t’s hard to find a person alive and breathing who doesn’t have a strong reac-
tion to horses. Most people love their power and grace; some find them
soulful and irresistible; others find them scary and intimidating. Regardless
of whether their response to horses is positive or negative, most people can’t
help but have an opinion about these dramatic creatures.
What is it about horses that elicits such intense reactions in people? The more
thoughtful among equiphiles have pondered this for ages. Perhaps their com-
bination of power and grace is what intrigues people. Or their sheer mass and
speed may attract others. Some — such as Audrey Pavia, your humble, nonvet
coauthor — believe the close connection between the human and equine races
is an expression of genetic memory. After all, without the horse, many of our
human ancestors would not have survived.
Although people no longer need horses to transport them from place to place,
plow their fields, and carry them into war, they still need to understand them.
Those of us who have chosen to live with these beautiful animals have an
obligation to care for them properly and enjoy them for all they are worth.
In this chapter, we introduce you to the wonderful world of horses.
Looking at a Horse’s Build and Mind
You need to understand a horse’s body and brain to appreciate what he is all
about. In horses, the same as with other creatures, the two are closely linked.
Horse people are obsessed with their horses’ bodies because a horse’s physical
structure determines not only his appearance but also his ability to function
with a rider.

Horse people have a lingo all their own when describing horses, and knowing
this terminology is important for communicating effectively on the topic of
horses. Each part of the horse’s body has a name to describe it. Knowing the
parts of the horse helps you understand and be understood by your horse’s
veterinarian, farrier (horseshoer), and horsy friends. People in the equine
world also use specific language to describe a horse’s measurements, colors,
markings, and movements.
Chapter 2 has a diagram showing the parts of the horse. Before you embark
on your new hobby, take a look at this diagram and memorize it. You’ll be
glad you did.
The horse’s mind is just as important as his body because the brain controls
everything the body does. When you’re riding a horse, this reality becomes
evident very quickly. Primitive ancestors of today’s horses were seen as
potential meals by a great many predators, and today’s domestic horse has
retained that information in his DNA. The consequence is that horses can be
flighty, especially when they find themselves in unfamiliar surroundings or
faced with an object or situation that makes them uncertain. The motto of
just about every horse out there is “Run first, ask questions later.” Knowing
that motto is extremely important if you choose to sit on the back of one of
these half-ton animals.
Training and experience can override much of the horse’s instincts to flee
perceived danger, which is why it’s so important to ride a horse that has had
both — especially when you’re a newcomer to horses. It’s also imperative
that you learn how to ride before you embark on any horseback sojourns,
regardless of whether it’s on a local trail or through the mountains of Mongolia.
Knowing how to handle a horse can mean the difference between a wonder-
ful, relaxing experience and one you’ll spend your lifetime trying to forget.
To find out more about how the horse thinks, see Chapter 2.
Checking Out Various Horse Breeds
Horses, like dogs, come in a wide variety of breeds. Some breeds have existed
for centuries, while others were developed only during the last 20 years or
so. Each breed has its own characteristics that make it unique, leaving horse
people with a healthy selection of breeds to admire. Knowing a thing or two
about the various breeds of horses helps you choose the right horse when
the time comes for you to join the ranks of horse owners.
10
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Although most horse breeds were developed in Europe and other parts of the
world, a number of breeds are uniquely American. Among these is the world’s
most populous breed, the American Quarter Horse. In the nearly 70 years
since this versatile breed officially was established in the U.S., it has spread
to a number of other nations. The second most popular breed in the U.S. is
the Paint Horse. A spinoff of the Quarter Horse, the colorful Paint’s popular-
ity has shot up to high numbers in the past 15 years.
Other breeds in the top 10 include the Appaloosa, Arabian, Miniature
Horse, Morgan, Saddlebred, Standardbred, Tennessee Walking Horse, and
Thoroughbred. Each breed has a distinct history and appearance and
appeals to a vast number of horse lovers.
For more details on the top 10 breeds, see Chapter 3. That same chapter also
provides information on some lesser-kept breeds such as the Peruvian Paso,
the Friesian, the warmblood, and draft-horse and pony breeds.
Making a Match with the Perfect Horse
The choice you make in a horse to ride can make a huge difference in whether
you come to love this hobby or dislike it. Choosing a horse is much like choos-
ing a mate: If you pick the wrong one, you won’t be happy.
Asking a few questions before you buy
Before you embark on the tremendous responsibility of horse ownership,
make certain owning a horse is really what you want. Ask yourself some
questions before you take the plunge:
 Why do I want a horse?
 Do I have the time and money for a horse?
 How do I want to ride (English, Western, shows, on trail), and how do I
want to learn the riding style of my choice?
 Who will take care of the horse on a daily basis?
 Might leasing be a better option than buying?
For more guidance on what to ask yourself and on other issues to consider
before buying a horse, see Chapter 4.

Chapter 1: Welcome to the World of Horses

Locating the right horse for you
The single most crucial aspect to finding the right horse is getting the help
of someone with experience. Without expert help, as a novice horse person,
you’re likely to make the wrong decisions about which horse is best suited
for you.
Ideally, the person who helps you with your decision will be a horse trainer,
someone who makes a living riding, training, and evaluating horses. If you
can’t find a horse trainer to help you, a riding instructor, an equine veterinar-
ian, a farrier, or someone with years of horse experience under his or her belt
is your best bet.
You’ll find available horses in any number of outlets, including:
 Classified ads from individuals in equine publications
 On the Internet
 Through trainers and breeders
 Via horse adoption groups
For more details about shopping for a horse, see Chapter 5.
Purchasing horse supplies
After you purchase your own horse, you’ll need all the accoutrements to go
with him. There is no shortage of stuff out there that you can buy for your
horse. For starters, you’ll need these basics:
 Saddle and pad
 Bridle (the headgear used on a horse during riding)
 Halter and lead rope (which provide control when you’re working with
your horse on the ground)
 Grooming supplies
You’ll also need some stuff for yourself:
 Riding boots or shoes
 Riding pants and shirt
 A helmet (if you’re smart and want to continue to be that way)
All these items can be purchased in your local tack and feed store, through
mail-order catalogs or over the Internet, among other options. For more
details on these and other items for you and your horse, see Chapter 6.
12
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Housing your horse
Where to keep your horse is a primary concern. If you’re like thousands of
horse owners around the country who live in an urban or suburban commu-
nity, a boarding stable is your only option. Choosing the right boarding stable
for your horse is important because the place where he’s kept will determine
his health, his safety, and how much you enjoy of him.
When considering a boarding stable, look for the following:
 Safe, sturdy accommodations
 Clean, safe surroundings
 Security
 Water and quality feed
 Good care
 Health requirements
 Riding facilities
 Tack storage
 Professional demeanor
But if you live on property zoned for horses and have or plan to build horse
facilities, the answer is easy: You can keep your horse at home. You have the
choice of housing your horse outdoors or indoors. In either case, you need to
provide him with a safe enclosure and shelter from the elements. You’re also
responsible for feeding him every day and cleaning up after him.
If you don’t have room on your property for a riding arena, you need access
to a community arena or one belonging to a neighbor. Finding room to ride
is especially important when you’re new to horses because you need a place
to ride where you feel safe and comfortable before you head out onto the
trail.
For more details about boarding your horse or keeping him at home, see
Chapter 7.
Taking Great Care of Your Horse
Cowboys in the movies make horse care look easy. After a long gallop, they
jump off their horses and leave them standing in the street while they head
to the saloon for some refreshments. In reality, horses need plenty of care to
stay happy and healthy, and as a horse owner, you’re the one to provide it.
13
Chapter 1: Welcome to the World of Horses

Handling daily tasks
If you keep your horse at home, you’ll be caring for him on a daily basis. Your
most important duties include feeding, providing fresh water, and picking up
manure.
If your horse is in a large pasture, he won’t need to get out for exercise every
day. But if he is confined to a stall or paddock, part of your job will be to ride
him, walk him, or provide him with exercise in some other way, preferably on
a daily basis.
Chapter 8 provides intricate details on caring for your horse’s daily needs.
Grooming your horse
An important part of horse care is grooming. A well-groomed horse looks good
and usually feels good too. Grooming gives you a chance to spend quality
time with your horse and keep an eye on his body for any changes that can
indicate disease.
Grooming involves both caring for your horse’s body and managing his mane
and tail. Hoof care is an essential part of grooming that requires you to clean
out your horse’s feet on a daily basis. In addition, it’s a good idea to bathe
your horse on a regular basis. You may also want to clip his hair during the
winter if you live in a warm climate.
For details about how to groom your horse, see Chapter 9.
Treating your horse’s illnesses
Despite their size and imposing presence, horses are fragile creatures that
often become sick or injured. Preventive care is important for horses, and it
includes:
 Routine vaccinations against a variety of equine ailments
 Deworming to get rid of harmful parasites
 Regular dental care to ensure that teeth are in good health
 Proper hoof care
 Quality feed
 Regular exercise
14
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

As a horse owner, your job is being able to recognize signs of illness in your
horse and calling a vet immediately whenever your horse is ill. Some signs
that you need to call the vet include:
 Diarrhea
 Inability to stand
 Indications of pain in your horse’s abdomen, known as colic
 Labored breathing
 Limping (known as lameness)
 Refusal to eat
 Straining to urinate or defecate
 Swollen, painful eyes
For more information on preventive care for your horse, see Chapter 10. For
details on common equine ailments, see Chapter 11.
Knowing when to part with your horse
It may be hard to imagine now, but the time may come when you want or need
to say goodbye to your horse. You may need to part ways because you’ve
outgrown him and need a mount more suited to your current skill level,
because your financial situation has changed and you can no longer afford
him, or (worse yet) because he has a terminal illness that can’t be cured.
If you need to sell your horse, do it in a way that ensures he will have a good
home, and won’t end up in the slaughterhouse — a fate that befalls many
unwanted horses. Some of your options for your horse include
 Selling
 Leasing
 Donating to a program
 Gifting to a family member
 Retiring
If your horse is sick, in pain, and can no longer be helped by veterinary medi-
cine, consider euthanasia. This humane way of ending a horse’s life is the
kindest thing you can do for your old friend.
For more details on giving up your horse, see Chapter 12.

Chapter 1: Welcome to the World of Horses

Riding Your Horse Safely and Easily
Horse handling is a skill perfected with training and experience. Receiving the
right kind of training and instruction from a qualified expert is important for
getting the most from the time you spend with horses. After you have some
knowledge under your belt, you can safely handle your horse in a variety of
situations. Remember that horses are large animals, and it takes some know-
how to deal with them.
Working with your horse from the ground
Before you can ride your horse, you need to handle him from the ground.
Given that your horse outweighs you by something like 10 times, it’s a good
idea to know how to properly deal with him when you’re standing at his side.
If you pay close attention to the info we provide about buying a horse in
Chapter 5, you can acquire an animal that has what horse people call good
ground manners. A horse with good ground manners maintains a proper 
distance from you — doesn’t crowd your space — and respects you as the
authority when you’re leading him or working around him. In turn, you need
to know how to handle your horse properly so you don’t confuse him or inad-
vertently put yourself in harm’s way. Make sure you know to succeed at:
 Approaching your horse in a stall or pasture
 Haltering your horse
 Leading your horse
 Tying your horse
 Longeing your horse
Flip to Chapter 13 for full details on handling your horse on the ground.
Looking at riding basics
Getting up on a horse’s back can be exciting. It can also be frustrating and
scary if you don’t know what you’re doing. Learning to ride in a formal setting
is crucial, because qualified instructors know how to properly teach you riding
basics.
16
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Your first decision is determining in which riding discipline you’d like to learn;
Chapter 14 has complete information on different riding disciplines. English
style riding is made up of several subtypes, including dressage, hunt seat,
and saddle seat.
 Hunt seat is used by people who want to jump their horses, although
plenty of hunt-seat riders don’t jump — they simply enjoy this style of
riding.
 Dressage is an ancient discipline that’s growing in popularity among
English riders in the U.S. It emphasizes grace and athleticism in the
horse.
 Saddle-seat riders tend to ride a certain type of horse, one that tends
to have high leg action. Many saddle-seat riders show their horses.
 Western riding, the most popular of all the disciplines, is often the style
of choice for beginning riders, because Western saddles provide the
most security. Western riding is popular with casual trail riders, as well
as those working with cattle.
Part of your equine education will include learning to saddle and bridle your
horse; see Chapter 15 for more details. When you have hoisted yourself into
the saddle, you are ready to start riding. For most people, this is what being
around horses is all about. Of course, doing it right takes education and prac-
tice. You can get an idea of the basics of mounting and riding in the different
disciplines by reading Chapter 16.
Staying safe on your horse
Horseback riding has been deemed one of the most dangerous sports, and
it results in a significant number of serious injuries to people every year.
For this reason, safety when riding is crucial.
One way to ensure that you have a safe ride on your horse is wear the proper
apparel. Footwear designed especially for riding is mandatory. Proper footwear
can keep you from getting caught up in the stirrups and being dragged if your
horse becomes out of control.
A riding helmet is an important part of safety apparel. Most horse-related
accidents involve head injuries, and more than one rider has ended up in
a vegetative state as a result of a blow to the head when falling off a horse.
Helmets designed specifically for riders can protect your valuable grey
matter in the event of an accident.
17
Chapter 1: Welcome to the World of Horses

Knowing the proper way to handle a horse — on the ground and in the
saddle — also increases your odds of staying safe while participating in
your new hobby. Don’t skimp on getting a good education on how to ride
and handle horses. You should find out how to do the following:
 Care for a horse’s hooves
 Handle yourself when you’re in close quarters with a horse
 Lead a horse
 Move around a tied horse
 Check your tack
 Ride safely by yourself and with others
You find details on all of these topics and more in Chapter 17.

Understanding Horses 
from Head to Hoof
In This Chapter
 Describing horses’ physical traits accurately
 Understanding equine instincts, senses, and language
 Keeping horses happy and trusting
F
or some reason, horses attract human beings like magnets attract steel.
This human infatuation has been going on for thousands of years. The fas-
cination began when primitive man saw horses as food. As cavemen became
more civilized, horses became valuable as beasts of burden. Basically, for most
of the horse’s history with humans, he has helped humans survive in a hostile
world.
Nowadays, however, humans have few practical reasons for keeping horses
around. Whereas humans used to use horses to provide transportation and
sustenance, we now have much speedier ways of getting to the grocery store.
So why do humans still want to keep big, unwieldy creatures that cost a lot to
house, take a lot of time to care for, eat a great deal, and produce significant
amounts of poop? What could horses possibly offer modern humans that
would make keeping equines — that is, members of the horse family — worth
all the trouble?
You get different answers to these questions depending on whom you ask.
But because we’re the ones writing this book, you’re going to get ours:
Horses are amazing, incredible creatures. They’re as breathtakingly beau-
tiful as they are powerful and fast. They’re wild in their souls yet gladly
give us their hearts. Horses offer us beauty, a connection to nature, and
a quiet and dignified companionship that no other animal can provide in
the same way. If you don’t believe us, it’s only because you really haven’t
gotten to know a horse yet. After you do, the equine mystique will reveal
itself to you.

If you want to be around horses, you need to acquire some horse sense. By
that, we mean that you need to understand some basics about horses, such
as how they’re put together physically and how to improve your relationship
with your horse by getting into his head — doing a little horse psychology, if
you will. This chapter covers these things and more.
Horse Talk: Describing Horses Correctly
If you hang around a stable for any length of time, you’ll notice that horse
people have a language all their own. This language — which sounds like a
foreign tongue to the uninitiated — is what horse people use to describe the
intricate details of the horse’s body.
If you want to fit in with the horsy set, you need to know the lingo and the
basic knowledge of horses that goes along with it. The horse’s anatomy, and
the horse’s height measurements, colorations, markings, and movements all
are essential details that real horse lovers know.
Checking out the horse’s parts
Horses are really put together. Nature made them to be virtual running
machines that can reach speeds of nearly 40 miles per hour. The equine
body is an impeccably designed combination of muscle and bone in an ele-
gant and graceful package.
People who spend time around horses not only begin to appreciate equine
anatomy but also come to understand it. Horse people talk about their horses’
bodies the way mechanics talk about cars. In the equine world, if you want to
keep up with such conversations, you must know the lingo and the blueprint.
Here are some parts of the horse you need to know (see Figure 2-1 for more):
 Withers: The area on the horse’s back just after the neck but above the
shoulders
 Fetlock: The horse’s ankle
 Forelock: The hair between the horse’s ears that falls onto the forehead
 Hocks: The elbow-like joint of the horse’s back legs.
 Muzzle: The area of the horse’s head includes the mouth and nostrils

Heard the expression, No hoof, no horse? Well, it’s true. Without healthy hooves,
horses can’t function well. Becoming familiar with the parts of the horse’s
hoof gives you intimate knowledge of this most important part of the equine
body. This knowledge helps you take better care of your horse’s tootsies, too
(see Figure 2-2).

Measuring a horse correctly
The average horse weighs anywhere from 1,000 to 1,200 pounds. But horse
people rarely refer to a horse’s weight when describing the animal’s size.
Instead, the horse’s height, measured in something called hands, is the
appraisal of choice.
One hand equals four inches, and horses are measured from the ground to the
top of the withers (see Figure 2-3), or the area of the back behind the neck and
above the shoulder. So, if a horse stands 60 inches from the ground to its with-
ers, the horse is 15 hands high. If the horse stands 63 inches from the ground,
the horse is 15.3 hands. Because a hand is an increment of 4 inches, a horse
that is 64 inches from the ground to the withers would not be 15.4 hands high
but instead is considered 16 hands. Height in hands is sometimes written as
h.h., which stands for hands high.
A horse’s height is important only if you plan to ride it — which, of course, is
what most people do. Generally speaking, an average-sized woman can com-
fortably ride a horse that is anywhere from 14.2 hands to 16.1 hands in height.
If you’re a rather tall woman, or are a man of average male height, you’ll prob-
ably want to lean toward a horse on the taller side of the range.
All this is mostly aesthetics, of course. If you’re a tall person, you look better
on a taller horse. Of course, if you’re above average in weight, a larger horse
can carry you more comfortably. If you plan to show your horse or perform
particular events with it, height may also be a consideration.

Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

You can use a regular measuring tape to determine a horse’s height, as long
as you’re good at division, because you need to divide the number of inches
you come up with by four. If you’d rather not bring your calculator to the
stable, you can buy a special horse measuring tape or a measuring stick
(even more accurate) at your local tack store. These devices are labeled in
hands, so you don’t have to do any calculating of your own.
Horse measuring tapes also are useful in determining your horse’s weight,
because the tapes usually have pound increments on one side and hand mea-
surements on the other. To determine your horse’s weight, wrap the tape
around the horse’s girth, just behind the elbow, and up behind the withers.
Seeing horses of many colors
Nature made horses to blend in with their surroundings, so the colors you
typically see in horses are meant to camouflage. Based on this definition, you
may think that horse colors should be dull, but the exact opposite is true.
The many different shades and variations of coat color that you find in the
equine world is amazing, and knowing the different horse colors helps you
describe and identify individual horses you may come across in your equine
travels. Having this knowledge also permits you to converse intelligently with
other horse lovers. You may even end up finding a favorite coloration that
you’d like to see on your own future horse!
The best way to learn horse colors is to see them. In the color section of
this book, you can find color photographs of 16 of the most common horse
colorations, along with names and descriptions of each. Some of the colors
you’ll see in the horse world include bay (reddish brown with black mane,
tail, and legs), black, chestnut (reddish body with red or blonde mane
and tail), gray (anything from nearly white to dappled gray), and palomino
(gold with lighter mane and tail).
Looking at different horse markings
Leg and facial markings are great for helping to identify individual horses.
Each marking has a name, and each name is universal among equine aficiona-
dos. Figure 2-4 shows the most common horse facial markings. Keep in mind
that the following patterns often have subtle variations.
 Bald: White that starts above the forehead, goes to the muzzle, and
extends beyond the bridge of the nose to the side of the face
 Blaze: Wide white area that runs along the bridge of the nose
23
Chapter 2: Understanding Horses from Head to Hoof

 Snip: White spot located on the muzzle, between or just below the nostrils
 Star: White spot on the forehead
 Stripe: Narrow white stripe down the center of the face, on the bridge of
the nose
Figure 2-5 shows typical white leg markings on horses. They include
 Coronet: A small white band just above the hoof
 Half cannon: A white marking that extends from the edge of the hoof
halfway up the middle of the leg
 Half pastern: A white marking that extends from the edge of the hoof
halfway up the pastern
 Sock: A white marking that extends from edge of the hoof two-thirds of
the way up the leg
 Stocking: A white marking that extends from edge of the hoof to the
knee or hock

Figuring out horse movements
If you’ve ever seen a Hollywood western, you know that horses gallop. In fact,
in the movies, all horses seem to do is gallop. In real life, however, most horses
have several other gaits besides the gallop.
The gaits are considerably different from one another. One difference is speed:
The walk is the slowest of the three. The trot is faster than the walk, and the
canter is faster than the trot. The gallop is the fastest gait of them all.
A big difference in the gaits is in the way the horse positions his legs while
he’s moving.
 In the walk, the horse puts each foot down one at a time, creating a four-
beat rhythm.
 In the trot, one front foot and its opposite hind foot come down at the
same time, making a two-beat rhythm.
 In the canter, one hind leg strikes the ground first, and then the other
hind leg and one foreleg come down together, then the other foreleg.
This movement creates a three-beat rhythm.
 In the gallop, the basic canter movement is sped up so that all four feet
are off the ground for a suspended moment. Then, each hind foot hits
the ground individually, followed by each front foot individually. To the
rider, the gallop feels very much like the canter, only faster.
When you’re riding a horse, you can feel each of these different rhythms.
(See Figure 2-6 for a visual sense of how this all works.)
Depending on the discipline or type of riding you’re doing, you may hear other
terms to describe these gaits. For example, western riders use the term jog to
describe a slow trot and lope for a slow gallop.

Just to confuse matters, the horse world has something called gaited horses,
which are horses that naturally possess one or more gaits in addition to or
instead of one or more of the basic gaits. Only horses of particular gaited
breeds have these peculiarities. Chapter 3 has info on various horse breeds,
including gaited breeds.
Mind Games: Getting into 
the Horse Psyche
You need to comprehend the world that the horse lives in to be able to
understand the horse. Think about it: The world of horses is not composed of
fast-food joints, unbalanced checkbooks, and vacations to far away countries.
Instead, horses live in a world made up of hay and grass, buzzing insects, and
assorted horsy politics.
Looking at the world through a horse’s eyes can open up all sorts of avenues for
communication between you and the horse. When you finally connect with your
horse, you’ll find that suddenly, this huge, four-legged alien is very special.
Examining equine instincts
Horses have a way of thinking about and viewing things that is uniquely their
own. The evolution of horses as prey animals gives them a special viewpoint
that helps them survive.
The components of this perspective (such as viewing the world as a series of
threats, finding safety in numbers, and looking to an authority figure for guid-
ance) make up the essence of the horse’s being. The human who understands
and sympathizes with these sometimes unhumanlike ways of looking at the
world is the person who becomes most adept at conversations with the horse.
Prey, not predator
The first thing you need to know about horses to really get into their heads is
that horses are prey animals, not predators. (The one interesting exception
to this fact is in Iceland, where Icelandic Horses have been seen catching
and eating fish from the ocean.) In the wild, horses are at the top of most
large predators’ dinner menus. Dogs and cats, on the other hand, evolved to
be hunters. Consequently, the horse looks at the world differently than the
domesticated dog and cat.
27
Chapter 2: Understanding Horses from Head to Hoof

Nowadays, horses live in domestic situations where their biggest worries are
horsefly bites, but try telling that to a horse. Long before humans ever consid-
ered building barns, haylofts, paddocks, and arenas, bolting from a potential
threat is what literally saved the horse’s hide. This instinct to flee first and
ask questions later is at the core of every equine personality.
You don’t need to spend much time around horses to witness the equine
instinct to flee: In a nutshell, horses scare easily. They often spook at what
humans view as the most benign of things: a plastic bag blowing in the wind,
a low-flying plane passing overhead, or a car backfiring nearby. To humans,
these distractions are minor, but to the ever-watchful horse, they are poten-
tially life-threatening hazards.
The ease with which horses spook may seem ridiculous, but the instinct
to flee from trouble is at the center of a horse’s psyche. Although most
domestic horses don’t have predators chasing them, they nevertheless
have a powerful instinct to be on guard. Their brains are telling them that
horse-eating monsters are out there, so they need to be on the lookout. 
If a real predator can’t be found, then, by golly, the horse will conjure up a
hunter to run from.
Let’s stay together
Closely associated with the get-the-heck-out-of-Dodge-now instinct is the herd
instinct, which is represented by the horse’s burning desire always to be with
other horses. This need stems from the fact that in the wild large numbers
mean safety. It works like this: Pretend for a moment that you’re a horse, and
a huge, terrifying saber-toothed tiger has selected horsemeat for his next meal.
When a big cat starts chasing your herd looking for prey to take down, the
chances of you being the horse that gets nailed are less when a whole herd
of other horses surrounds you.
In addition to decreasing your odds of being the unlucky item on the big cat’s
menu, being in a herd also means that you can find out about impending danger
much sooner than you would if you were alone. After all, a herdful of eyes is
better than one measly pair.
Yet the horse’s love for other horses is not completely mercenary, however.
You only need to watch a group of horses out in a field to discover that they
genuinely enjoy each other’s company. Although each horse is an individual
with his own distinct personality, horses nonetheless thrive on companion-
ship and bond strongly with their herdmates. They groom each other with
their teeth, take turns tail swishing flies from each other’s faces, and even
play horsy games together, such as tag and I-dare-you-to-try-and-bite-me.
28
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Follow the leader
Horses are social creatures, and they even have their own societal rules. In
any given herd of horses, some horses are dominant and others are submis-
sive. Horses follow a precise pecking order, with one big kahuna at the top of
the heap who lords over all the other horses. The individual personalities of
various herd members, along with factors such as age and physical ability,
determine which horses take on different roles within the herd. All in all,
horse society doesn’t operate that much differently than human society.
Human beings, on the other hand, have benefited greatly from the horse’s
intrinsic need for leadership. The horse’s penchant for dutifully submitting
to authority is what ultimately enabled humankind to domesticate the horse
thousands of years ago. After a human earns a horse’s respect (the same way
a leader horse must earn the respect of his fellow horses), the horse views
the human as an authority figure to be respected and followed in much the
same way as he views the leader horse.
When a human fails to gain a horse’s respect early on in their relationship, the
horse automatically takes charge. From the horse’s perspective, every herd —
even one made up of only two members — must have a leader. Although
first impressions are important to horses, overrun humans can make up lost
ground by becoming more assertive and telling the horse (in so many words),
“I’m the one in charge now.”
In the same way that horses test the leader horses in a herd, they also peri-
odically test their human companions to make sure that the humans still are
worthy of leadership. Horses that misbehave often do so to challenge the
authority of whoever is handling them, and they’re incredibly astute at deter-
mining the qualifications of those giving them orders. For a horse to feel
secure, he must have strong leadership. If you don’t measure up in this depart-
ment, or if the horse has a history of dealing with humans that don’t measure
up as leaders, the horse will take the leadership position from you — and we
promise you won’t like the results!
For example, in horse/human relationships where the horse has taken charge,
you often see horses leading humans around the stable instead of vice versa.
Leader horses that are being ridden make the decisions about where and when
to go, despite their riders’ pleas.
Equine followers feel safest when they have a strong leader making decisions
for them and helping them determine what is and isn’t dangerous. Human lead-
ership accounts for why many horses find comfort in their associations with
human beings. If we humans do things right, they see us as leaders. And if we
say things are okay, then they must be okay.
29
Chapter 2: Understanding Horses from Head to Hoof

The role of leader places a great responsibility on human shoulders, of course.
We must convince the horse that we are confident and knowledgeable and
worthy of their invaluable equine trust.
Surveying equine senses
From the horse’s perspective, you need to know — or literally see — how the
horse takes in the world. Humans evolved to be hunters and gatherers, chas-
ing down prey and finding appropriate plants to eat. Horses, on the other hand,
are built to avoid hunters and eat nearly everything that grows around them.
Given these fundamental distinctions, the horse’s senses are bound to have
nuances that are somewhat different from those of a human.
Sight
Sight is the most important equine sense. For a prey animal like the horse, in
the wild, good eyesight means the difference between life and death. Literally
seeing trouble coming is the best way the horse has to make it to safety before
a predator gets too close.
Because horses have long, narrow heads with eyes on either side, they have
the ability to take in more of the view than do humans. When their heads are
facing forward, horses have a nearly 180-degree field of vision in each eye
(as shown in Figure 2-7). They can see in front of and almost all the way
around their bodies, although they do have some blind spots.
Figure 2-7:
A horse can
see this
much when
facing
straight
ahead.
30
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

One of a horse’s blind spots is directly behind, so you should never approach
a horse from the back unless the horse already knows you’re there. If you’re
already next to the horse and move toward his blind spot, keep one hand on
him at all times so he is aware of your presence.
No one knows for sure how far horses can see, mainly because horses have
trouble pronouncing the letters on eye tests. Scientists who have done exper-
iments in this field have made some educated guesses that horses can see
pretty darn far, in the realm of at least hundreds of yards away. Horses can
distinguish patterns, which means they’re able to take in fine details. They
also perceive depth well.
Horses also have much better night vision than humans. Many a rider has
been out on a dark, moonless trail, dumbfounded by his or her horses’ ability
to see where the pair are going despite the incredibly dim light.
Scientists know far less about horses’ color vision than they do about other
areas of equine sight, but they’re certain that horses can see some colors.
Red and blue seem to be particularly distinct to the equine eye, but beyond
those colors, we don’t know. Researchers need to do more tests to find out
whether horses can see the full spectrum of the rainbow.
Hearing
A species that survives by getting a head start on marauding predators needs
a pretty good sense of hearing. The fact that horses have survived all the way
to modern times is testimony to their incredible hearing, which is consider-
ably better than a human’s.
If you look at the shape of the horse’s ear, you can see that it’s built sort of
like a funnel. With this design, the ear can capture sound in its outer part and
channel it down into the ear canal. The broad outer part of the horse’s ear
very adequately takes in the slightest sound in the horse’s environment.
The horse’s ear also has an amazing ability to swivel. Just watch a horse’s
ears sometime while the horse is busy eating or just hanging out. You’ll see
one ear turn forward, while the other swings to the back. Sometimes both
ears go forward at the same time, while at other times, both are poised to the
rear. The purpose of all this twisting is simple — to take in as much informa-
tion as possible at one time.
Using their extremely mobile ears, horses constantly monitor the world around
them. Just imagine trying to pay complete attention to different sounds coming in
to either ear at the same time. Impossible for a human, yet the horse does this
on a steady basis. A horse can take in the sounds of a car driving by, children
playing, a bird chirping, and a human approaching, all at once, from different
places in the environment. The horse then processes that information and
makes split-second decisions about whether to react — all the while picking
out the best blades of pasture grass or meandering down a rocky trail. The
process really is mind-blowing.
31
Chapter 2: Understanding Horses from Head to Hoof

Loud, unfamiliar noises can send a relaxed horse into a tizzy. On the other
hand, a placid, reassuring sound can ease a horse’s worries. It’s amazing to
see how a frightened horse can be comforted by a soft, gentle voice from a
calm and confident human. Keep this fact in mind when handling your horse
in a particularly noisy or frightening environment.
Smell
Like most nonhuman animals, horses have an acute sense of smell that they
regularly employ to provide them with information on what is going on around
them. Horses use their sense of smell in a number of different and important
ways.
People talk about smelling danger, but when it comes to the horse, this
metaphor is literally the case. Nature equipped the equine with a strong
olfactory sense that can tell the animal whether a predator is near. All it takes
is a strong upwind breeze to bring a dangerous scent to the attention of a wild
herd. After getting a whiff of the predator, the herd literally high-tails — their
tails stick way up in the air as they flee — it out of there in a flash.
Horses also use smell as part of their complicated social structure. Horses
typically greet each other nose to nose, each taking in the odor of the other.
Horses also come to recognize each other by scent and by sight. Mares and
foals quickly memorize each other’s scents and use this information to help
locate each other in a crowd of horses.
Most horses also greet humans in the same way. When you introduce your-
self to a horse for the first time, notice how the horse reaches out his muzzle
to sniff you. Given this olfactory penchant, the most polite way to approach a
horse is with the back of your hand extended so the horse may take in your
personal scent. Letting a horse breathe in your scent tells the animal that you
are a fellow herdmate (not a predator), and usually makes the horse more
agreeable to being handled.
The equine sense of smell also comes in handy when it’s time to eat. Although
horses also use their eyes and muzzles to ferret out the tastiest morsels in
a pasture, sense of smell plays a part as well. One plant may look just like
another to you, but a horse can get a sense of whether foliage tastes good by
first getting a whiff of it.
Touch
The equine sense of touch is an important (although often overlooked) ele-
ment to the horse. Although many people think that horses have tough hides,
they really don’t. Their skin obviously is tougher than human epidermis, but
it still is rich with nerve endings. If it weren’t, how else could a horse possibly
feel a tiny little fly landing on his body? Trust us, he can!
32
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

If you sit on a pasture fence and watch a herd of horses for a few hours, you’ll
see plenty of evidence of how horses use touch to communicate with each
other. Mothers reassure their babies with a brush of the muzzle; comrades
scratch each other’s itches with their teeth. Whenever a message needs to be
sent from one horse to another, visual cues and touch — or the threat of it —
nearly always are used.
Humans also use touch to convey messages to the horse. A gentle rubdown,
a pat on the shoulder, a vigorous massage in just the right place — these all
are ways of saying, “I’m your friend,” to a horse. Sometimes, if you’re lucky,
you get a similar tactile message in return.
Understanding equine language
Because horses are such highly social creatures, they do quite a bit of talking
to one another. Of course the equine way of communicating is nothing like
what Mr. Ed did. Horses have their own exclusive language, and traditional
nouns and verbs aren’t part of the picture.
33
Chapter 2: Understanding Horses from Head to Hoof
The phenomenon of imprinting
In 1991, a California veterinarian by the name of
Robert M. Miller, DVM, authored a book called
Imprint Training of the Newborn Foal, which
highlighted a method for getting deep into the
equine mind. Called imprinting, this procedure
involves intense handling of newborn foals, even
before they have bonded with their mothers.
The theory behind imprinting is that foals, as herd
animals, will bond closely to whomever they
make physical contact with shortly after birth.
In the wild, this instinct to bond helps the foal
stay close to its mother and the herd, and helps
him understand that he is a horse.
By spending time ritualistically handling a new-
born foal before it has even had a chance to rise
to its feet, a human being can make an impres-
sion that will last the horse its entire lifetime.
Advocates of imprinting say it produces horses
that have a strong connection to their human
handlers, making them easy to train and willing
to work. However, if not performed correctly,
imprinting can result in a horse that has no
respect for humans and can be difficult to deal
with.
Regardless of any pitfalls in the technique, a
great many horse breeders have incorporated
imprinting into their foal management programs.
The result: Any horse you meet born after 1991
may well have been imprinted.

Humans primarily use verbal language to express thoughts and emotions to
one another. Horses do the same thing within their species, only they mostly
use their bodies to get their points across. This clear way of expressing a
variety of attitudes, intents, and emotions is universal among all members of
the equine family.
To truly understand horses, you absolutely have to know how to read equine
body language. Trying to get by without this crucial skill is like trying to con-
duct business in a foreign country without comprehending the native tongue.
You just can’t do it.
Focusing on facial expressions
One of the most obvious ways that horses talk to each other — and to
humans — is by using facial expressions. Horses send out at least four dis-
tinct messages by using their faces (as shown in Figure 2-8). Each message
has a distinct look.
 I’m afraid, and I’m about to bolt. Horses that are on the verge of panic
often warn you with this expression before they take off (although they
may act in a matter of seconds). The ears are pointed toward whatever
is the source of fear. The head is held high and the whites of the eye
are showing. You sometimes can actually see the muscles in the neck
tense up.
 I’m alert and wondering what’s next. This welcome expression indi-
cates that the horse is content and curious about his surroundings.
The ears are pricked forward; the eyes are focused on the object of
wonder. The head is held at medium height.
 Get away or else! This expression immediately precedes a bite or a kick.
The horse usually directs the aggression at other horses, but occasion-
ally, ill-tempered horses direct this aggression at humans. The ears are
laid back flat against the head, the nostrils take on an oblong shape and
the mouth is open with teeth exposed. (Don’t confuse flattened ears with
ears that are simply cocked back for listening.)
 I’m relaxed and secure. The sign of a happy, healthy horse, you may see
this expression while you’re grooming, while your horse is dozing in the
pasture, or even while you’re riding together along a familiar trail. The ears
are in a relaxed state, usually pointing backward. The eye has a calm look,
and the head is at medium height.
Individual horses exhibit these expressions with subtle variations, so getting
to know the individual expressions of your particular horse helps you under-
stand him even better.
34
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Listening to the equine voice
Although body language is the primary means of equine communication,
horses also use a range of sounds to talk to each other. The most prominent
among these are the neigh, nicker, snort, and squeal. Each sound serves a par-
ticular purpose in a herd situation, and horses often use the sounds as a way of
communicating with human beings, too. Although scientists aren’t completely
sure what each of these vocalizations means in a literal sense, each one seems
to take place under certain circumstances, giving us a clue as to its intent.
 Neigh: A neigh, or whinny, is the loud call that most people associate
with the horse. You hear it as a sound effect in Hollywood westerns all
the time (usually used incorrectly — see Chapter 20 for more details).
The neigh seems to be used most often by horses that have been sepa-
rated from their herd or from a very close companion. Neighs have a
sense of urgency to them that seem to be saying, “Hey, I’m over here!”
 Nicker: The nicker is a soft, gentle call that is usually heard when horses
with a close bond greet one another. Mares nicker to their foals, and
herdmates nicker to each other. Horses that are attached to their human
caretakers sometimes nicker to them. You can also hear nickering at feed-
ing time as the person delivering the food approaches.

Chapter 2: Understanding Horses from Head to Hoof

 Snort: The snort, made by a rapid blowing of air from the nostrils, is most
often heard when a horse is alarmed in some way. If a horse comes upon
something that scares him, he may bolt, then spin around and snort at
the offending object.
 Squeal: One of the more amusing equine vocalizations is the squeal.
The squeal is usually reserved for other horses, and seems to be a 
message of controlled aggression. Strange horses often approach one
another with heads up and necks arched. After a short muzzle sniffing ses-
sion, one horse squeals to show dominance. The other horse often reacts
with an aggressive facial expression or a return squeal. The horses almost
seem to be testing each other to see who backs down first. A mare that
isn’t quite ready to breed may squeal to tell a frisky stallion to back off.
Another type of squeal comes from horses that are really frightened.
These fear squeals are higher pitched and shorter in length than their
more assertive cousins.
Do You Trust Me? Developing Bonds
Between Horses and Humans
The very instincts that have served the horse well in dealing with life as a prey
animal often are in direct conflict with life in the human world. Domesticated
horses need no longer fear ferocious carnivores because the horse’s safety
is guarded by his human companions, and his needs are (it is hoped) always
met. This new way of being, however, conflicts with everything the horse has
become throughout its long history.
Making things even odder for the horse is the fact that humankind itself was
one of the very predators that preyed upon horses thousands of years ago.
Scientists are certain that primitive man actively hunted horses for food.
In fact, many believe that human overhunting may be partially to blame for
the horse’s extinction in North America some 10,000 years ago.
This reality creates a conundrum for both horse and human. The human
creature that horses once feared is now the very same one asking the horse
for trust and companionship. These same human beings have also placed
the horse in a human world where much of its natural survival behaviors are
unnecessary. This paradox creates a weird scenario for both the horse and
human, no matter how you look at it.
The dilemma that humans and horses face boils down to a couple of questions:
 How do humans deal with the horse’s penchant for fear and flight?
 How do horses deal with this strange world so alien to anything they
would have ever encountered in the wild?
36
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Because of mankind’s greater brain capacity, the burden of bridging the gap
between the reality of the domesticated horse’s world and what a horse’s
instincts tell it falls on the human. Communicating to the horse that every-
thing’s really okay, however, requires the human to understand the equine
mind and to pay close attention to the horse’s modes of communication.
Developing a trusting relationship between horse and human can achieve
miraculous results. Many, many horses trust their human caretakers so much
that they tolerate all kinds of bizarre situations with minimal fear. Go to any
horse show and you can see what we mean. The constant commotion and
chaos that is a regular part of many horse shows would otherwise make every
horse at the show go nuts. But that rarely happens. Instead, you see scores of
horses calmly lounging around, quietly munching their hay, and performing
beautifully in the show ring when it’s their time in the spotlight. These horses
have grown accustomed to the human-dominated world in which they live and
have developed a basic trust in the humans who guide their lives.
Other examples of how horse-loving humans have helped horses transcend
the gap between primitive equine instinct and the modern human world can
be seen everyday in stables and pastures around the globe. There you find
horses that greet their caretakers with an obvious joy. Some horses become
incredibly attached to just one special person. Even more horses truly love
their jobs and are eager to come out of their stalls or pastures and do what-
ever work is asked of them.
If you want to achieve a profound bond with your horse, always put yourself
in your horse’s place and try to comprehend the equine experience. Not only
will you come to understand and appreciate your horse, but your horse also
will come to view you as a protector and ultimately will grow to trust you with
his very life.
The sections that follow cover just a few of the tasks that humans can under-
take to develop trust with their horses.
Providing companionship
Horses are herd animals, and you can’t get around that fact (see “Let’s stay
together” earlier in this chapter for more details). Just like humans, horses need
to have regular interaction with members of their own species to maintain a
healthy sense of well-being. For a horse, being alone means being vulnerable —
so vulnerable that it can be a matter of life or death.
Depriving a horse of regular companionship is inhumane and tantamount
to keeping a person in solitary confinement. Some horses can tolerate the 
situation better than others, depending on the individual personality of the
horse. But none enjoy isolation. In fact, a horse deprived of companionship
often becomes neurotic and develops stable vices, the equine equivalent to
37
Chapter 2: Understanding Horses from Head to Hoof

human nail-biting (see the section “Taking some stable vice advice” later in
this chapter). Every horse needs to have some company, whether it’s on two
or four legs.
One or more horses for a friend is the best scenario, but many horses can
also find solace in the companionship of a goat, sheep, donkey, or other
hoofed animal. Human companionship also means a great deal to horses.
Some horses — usually ones that were imprinted on humans at birth (see
the sidebar on imprinting earlier in this chapter) — actually prefer human
companionship to that of other horses. But with most horses, human com-
panionship alone doesn’t fit the bill. Human companionship is better than
nothing, however, and needs to be provided often to a horse that has no
other comrades.
Chowing down
Horses evolved on grassy plains, and in nature, horses spend most of their
time grazing. The equine digestive system supports almost constant con-
sumption of low-grade grasses.
The equine brain also is designed for plenty of foraging and chewing. Grazing
for a horse is the human equivalent to working, reading, or watching TV. For a
horse, grazing provides not only nutrition, but also mental stimulation.
The ideal situation for a horse is to be in a pasture, where he can munch on
grass for nearly 18 hours a day. A horse that can do just that is going to be a
happy, well-adjusted critter that can give in to the natural urge to chew, chew,
chew.
Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, providing a horse with pasture isn’t
always possible. Many horses — especially those in more urban areas — live
in small dirt paddocks or tidy box stalls, without access to grass. Sometimes,
these grazing-deprived horses develop stable vices because they are bored
and frustrated by their inability to express their natural urge to graze (see the
section “Taking some stable vice advice” later in this chapter).
For horses that can’t graze in a field of grass, the next best thing is frequent
feeding of roughage, like hay. You must feed horses a minimum of twice a day
for basic nutrition. More frequent feedings are even better for their brains
and help keep their digestive tracts working properly. (See Chapter 8 for
more details on feeding horses.)
Don’t forget to cut back a little on your horse’s feed if he must be laid up and
can’t exercise for some reason. Talk to your veterinarian about how much to
reduce his ration under these circumstances.
38
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Stretching out
Just as Mother Nature designed the horse to eat on a nearly constant basis,
she also built the horse for nearly constant movement.
If you watch a horse grazing out in a pasture, you’ll see that with just about
every bite of grass, the horse takes a step. In a 15-minute period, the horse
moves quite a few feet from where he originally started nibbling.
This regular movement provides exercise for both the horse’s body and mind.
Energy is slowly released as the horse moves steadily around the pasture.
Take this same horse and put him in a box stall or small paddock, and you
have a horse that feels cooped up.
For the horse that must live in small quarters without the freedom to move
about and graze, daily exercise is of vital importance (see Chapter 8 for the
full scoop). Every day, your confined equine needs to be taken out of the stall
and walked for at least half an hour, turned out into a larger paddock to run
around, or be ridden at least 45 minutes. If the horse doesn’t receive adequate
exercise, not only will he be prone to developing leg problems, but he’ll also
have plenty of pent-up energy. The horse often expresses his overabundance
of energy through stable vices (see the next section) or through misbehavior
when he finally does get out of his stall.
Taking some stable vice advice
Horses that are kept by humans in a way that is very unnatural to how they
evolved (cooped up, unable to eat with frequency, lacking mental stimulation)
sometimes develop neurotic behaviors. These stable vices, as they are known,
are the equine equivalent to nail-biting and hair-twisting. Horses with theses
problems need more stimulation in the forms of more frequent feeding, more
exercise, more companionship with other horses, and/or more room to move
around (see the previous sections). After a horse develops one of these habits,
it’s hard to break, even with a change in environment, so prevention is key:
 Cribbing: Cribbing is a bizarre but all-too-common habit, and seems to be
the equine version of obsessive-compulsive disorder. The cribbing horse
grabs a fence post or barn door in between his teeth, arches his neck, and
sucks air into his stomach. This air sucking creates a head rush that
becomes addictive. Cribbing is not only a sign of extreme boredom, it can
be harmful to the horse’s digestive system. Devices exist that are meant
to curb this behavior, but in our opinion, you’re better off addressing the
source of the problem, which is a lack of stimulation. When it comes to
cribbing, prevention is more effective than a cure. Provide your horse with
enough exercise and stimulation so that he doesn’t get into the cribbing habit.
39
Chapter 2: Understanding Horses from Head to Hoof

 Wind-sucking: Similar to cribbing, wind-sucking involves the horse taking
hold of a horizontal surface between his teeth and sucking air into his
stomach. Sometimes the horse doesn’t take hold of anything but just
sucks air into his windpipe. Usually the result of boredom, wind-sucking
is a hard habit to break. Providing a horse with plenty of roughage (hay or
pasture) to eat and daily exercise can discourage the habit.
 Weaving: A horse that weaves stands in one place, shifting weight from
one foot to the other in a rhythmic motion, back and forth, his head sway-
ing from side to side. Weaving horses are pitiful to watch. Weaving is not
only a sign of extreme boredom, but can also be a symptom of anxiety.
Weaving is almost always a stall problem that usually goes away when the
horse is moved to a pasture or a bigger stall.
 Pacing: A pacing horse walks endlessly around his stall. Horses that
exhibit this behavior usually are showing discomfort with confinement.
In most cases, horses that pace are the ones kept in box stalls. Horses in
paddocks occasionally pace, too, especially if they have a neighboring
horse they don’t get along with. Pacing is a horse’s way of saying “Get me
out of here!” Move the horse to a more open environment if possible.
 Bolting feed: Bolting feed means eating too quickly, something that horses
sometimes do when they are feeling overly hungry, anxious about the
security of their food, or simply anxious in general. It’s not healthy for
a horse to bolt his feed, because the food isn’t thoroughly chewed or
moistened. This situation can cause a blockage in the esophagus, or in
the intestines where it can lead to colic. Feed the horse more often, put
medium-sized stones in the feeder along with the feed to slow down his
eating (he’ll have to pick around the stones), and create a more secure
environment for the horse.

In This Chapter
 Choosing the right breed for your needs
 Looking at the top ten breeds in the United States
 Finding out about other less common breeds
 Recognizing other equines
H
orses have been domesticated for thousands of years, and in that time,
scores of breeds have developed. Plenty of these breeds still exist today,
giving newcomers to the equine world a swarm of choices to contemplate.
Given this vast plethora of breeds, how in the world are you supposed to
pick just one to ride or own? That’s where we come in.
Figuring out which breed is for you is the main objective of this chapter.
Feel free to turn to the color section, too, to take a peek at what some of
these breeds look like.
Picking the Best Breed for You
You may not need to settle on just one breed. Many horse owners have
absolutely no preference for a particular breed. Instead, they simply look
for individual horses that possess the character traits they prefer. If that
horse turns out to be a Quarter Horse, fine. If the horse turns out to be a
Paint, that’s fine, too. Basically, it doesn’t matter. You can go this route if
you choose. You sure won’t be the only one out there who has.
In our humble opinion, however, one of the neatest things about the horse
world is that you can choose from so many different breeds. We like the fact
that the horse world is so diverse, and that each and every breed has a small
subculture that surrounds it. That’s why we encourage you to find a few breeds
that really strike your fancy. You may not end up buying a horse of one of these
breeds, but at least you’ll have formed a strong opinion on the subject — and
strong opinions are mandatory for all horse people!

We can’t tell you which breed is best for you because every person is an indi-
vidual with different wants and needs. But we can give you some advice on
how to go about making your decision:
 Research, research, research: Do as much reading as you can about the
different breeds. Narrow your likes down to a few breeds, based on the
way the breed looks, its history — whatever strikes you. Then, write to
the breed associations for more information, or visit their Web sites on
the Internet (see the Appendix for addresses and URLs).
 Meet the horses: Find a horse show for the breeds you like and spend the
day watching real horses in action. Go backstage to visit with the horses
and their owners. (Always ask permission before petting any horse and
never feed treats without a go-ahead from the owner.) This kind of close
contact gives you a real sense of what the horses — and the people who
care about them — are all about.
42
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 
All together now: Breed associations
Breeds of horses don’t exist by themselves. Each
and every one was created by human beings, and
to this day, human beings continue to manage
the breeds.
Working together in clubs known as breed asso-
ciations, these groups serve as watchdogs for
their breeds and perform a number of vital func-
tions, the most vital of which is to register horses.
When a horse is registered with a breed associ-
ation, its name along with its parentage and other
vital information are recorded with the group. If
you buy a purebred horse, chances are the
animal already is registered with a breed associ-
ation. By registering every horse that’s born in the
breed — and thereby establishing each individual
horse’s genetic purity — the associations are
ensuring the continuation of their breed.
Breed associations also work to promote the
breeds they represent by offering information
about the breed to the public, sponsoring shows
that encourage people to own a specific breed,
and performing other services that increase the
breed’s visibility.
Breed associations are valuable resources for
information on specific horse breeds and can
be a huge help to you when you want to find out
even more about a breed than we tell you here.
Write to the breed association of your choice,
or visit its Web site for more information. (The
addresses and URLs for all the major breed
associations are listed in the Appendix.)
If the horse you buy or lease is a purebred, con-
sider getting involved with a local chapter of
your breed association. You’ll meet plenty of
other people who own and love the same breed
you do, and you’ll have a chance to participate
in a variety of activities with your horse. Most
regional breed clubs give out year-end awards
and stage shows, social events, and even edu-
cational clinics. Getting involved with a regional
club is the best way to discover more about
your breed of choice.

 Spend some time: If you find yourself getting serious about a breed and
are thinking about buying a horse to show, spend time with a few repre-
sentatives of the breed, both equine and human. Lease a horse of the
breed for a while, or ask a breeder whether you can come over and
spend time riding and handling the horses so you can get to know the
breed. Meanwhile, start hanging around at breed shows and becoming
acquainted with people involved with the breed. Horse people love to
talk about their horses, so all you have to do to get a conversation going
is ask questions and let people know you’re a fan of the breed. The pur-
pose of all this socializing is to make sure that you really are in love with
this breed before you make a commitment.
Meeting the Top Ten Horse Breeds
Hundreds of horse breeds exist in the world today, but only a handful of them
are among the top ten most popular riding breeds in the United States. The
reasons for the popularity of these breeds can be narrowed down to a couple
of factors: Each breed has a strong registering organization that promotes it
among the horse-owning public, and each breed has redeeming qualities that
a large number of horse people have come to appreciate.
Owning or riding one of the top ten breeds has its benefits. Plenty of informa-
tion and support is available on the animals that make up the breed. Horse
shows for the breed also are common and so are an array of sources from
which you can learn more about the breed. Additionally, if you want to buy a
horse of one of these breeds, you won’t have too much trouble locating one.
Fans of lesser-known breeds of horses don’t have these advantages and must
fend for themselves in many respects.
As you read our breed descriptions, keep in mind that we speak in generalities
when it comes to the personalities of different horse breeds. For example, we
say that Arabians are friendly horses. However, you may meet one or two
Arabians in your travels that are complete grouches. Remember that each horse
is an individual, and as you get to know different horses, you’ll find horses that
simply don’t match the personalities typically attributed to their breeds.
That said, we’re going to take a look at the top ten most popular riding breeds
in the United States. Their popularity is determined by the number of horses
that are registered in the breed each year. We list them here in alphabetical
order, and you can see photos of each breed in the color section in the middle
of the book. (Flip to Chapter 2 if you want general info about horse parts,
colors, markings, and movements, and check out Chapter 18 for details on
equine competitions.)

Chapter 3: Perusing Popular Horse Breeds

Appaloosa
The Appaloosa horse first was kept by the Nez Percé Indians of northern
Idaho during the 1700s and 1800s. When the Nez Percé were forced onto
reservations, the Appaloosa breed nearly died out. However, in the 1930s, a
concerned group of horsemen gathered together to start a registry to save the
breed. Since then, the Appaloosa horse has grown to considerable popularity.
The Appaloosa horse’s most distinguishing characteristic is its spotted coat,
particularly the white rump with dark spots, which is characteristic to the
breed. That said, the Appaloosa horse is represented in several different pat-
terns, including:
 Leopard — the popular white with dark spots over the body
 Blanket with spots — a dark body color with white over the rump that’s
covered with dark spots
Other physical traits include white sclera — the tissue that surrounds the
pupil and gives the eye an almost human appearance, striped hooves, and
mottled skin. Some Appaloosas also have thin manes and tails. The height
range for an Appaloosa is 14.3 to 16 hands.
Appaloosas are known for their quiet and willing temperaments. They excel in
western events, three-day eventing, and trail riding, and are known for being
athletic and versatile. Appaloosas make excellent and colorful companions.
Arabian
The Arabian is one of the oldest breeds of horse still in existence. Developed in
the Middle East several hundred years ago, many experts consider the Arabian
horse one of the finest and purest breeds alive. The Arabian also is the most
influential: Throughout equine history, humans have used Arabians to improve
the quality of other breeds. Some examples of half-Arabian breeds are the
Anglo-Arab (half Thoroughbred, half Arabian), the Quarab (half Quarter Horse,
half Arabian), the Morab (half Morgan, half Arabian) and the Ara-Appaloosa
(half Appaloosa, half Arabian). The purpose of these matings is to create half-
Arabians that possess the refinement of the Arabian breed with the traits of
another breed.
Arabian horses are known for their elegant and graceful beauty. Arabians have
small heads, and concave (or dished) faces, small ears that curve inward, and
long and arched necks. Most Arabian horses have only five spinal vertebrae
as opposed to the six vertebrae typically found in most other breeds. Having
one less vertebra gives Arabians a shorter back than many other breeds.
(Horses that are part Arabians can have either five or six vertebrae, depend-
ing on the horse.)
44
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Arabians are small horses that rarely measure much more than 15 hands in
height. You can find them in a number of different colors, particularly gray,
chestnut, bay, and black. Arabians are friendly and inquisitive horses, but they
can be high-spirited. They perform especially well in endurance competitions
and are shown in western, hunt-seat, eventing, dressage, and saddle-seat
classes. Half-Arabians usually make excellent pleasure and show horses.
Miniature
Miniature horses are the dwarfs of the equine world (smaller than ponies),
and number one in the adorable category. They are becoming increasingly
popular in the United States, even though they are too small to be ridden.
The Miniature horse has all the physical and psychological characteristics
of a regular horse in a small package.
Miniature horses were developed in the United States in the 1800s to pull
carts in and out of coal mines. This job required a tiny horse because mine
tunnels rarely accommodated normal-sized horses.
The Miniature horse of today, which stands anywhere from 6 to 7 hands high,
is kept primarily as a pet. Tiny tots can ride Miniature horses, but anyone
older than 4 years of age probably is too big to ride a Miniature horse.
Despite their small size, Miniature horses can easily pull a fully grown human
in a light cart. Many Miniature horses are used for pleasure driving, and you
can see them at special Miniature horse shows pulling light rigs in competi-
tion. They also are shown in halter classes and other special events. You can
check out a Miniature horse in the color section.
Morgan
The Morgan horse is a quintessential American breed that was developed in
Vermont during the 1700s from one horse, a little stallion named Justin Morgan.
Named after the man who owned him, Justin Morgan achieved considerable
fame for his astounding strength and willing disposition. The Morgan breed
was developed by breeding a variety of different mares to Justin Morgan.
These mares produced foals that looked almost exactly like Justin Morgan,
and so the breed was born.
Morgans today have small, elegant heads and strong, highly arched necks.
Just like their founding sire, Morgans tend to be smaller horses and rarely
reach more than 15.2 hands in height. They’re typically seen mostly in bay,
black, and chestnut, and like their founding sire, Morgans are eager to please
and willing to do whatever is asked of them.
45
Chapter 3: Perusing Popular Horse Breeds

Most Morgans are ridden simply for pleasure, although a good many are shown
in saddle-seat, western, and hunt-seat classes. The breed also is popular as a
light-carriage horse.
Paint Horse
The Paint Horse used to be considered an anomaly — a colorful but unwanted
result of many Quarter Horse-to-Quarter Horse breedings. (See the following
section for more about Quarter Horses.) Rejected by the Quarter Horse reg-
istry because of their coat markings, these patterned horses had no official
recognition in the horse world. However, in the early 1960s, a group of horse
lovers who appreciated the Paint for its unusual appearance created a registry
for the breed that helped it survive and grow.
Paint Horse coats come in a variety of different patterns, most of which fall
under the headings:
 Tobiano — a white base with dark patches
 Overo — a dark base with white patches
The breed’s conformation, or the way it’s horses are put together, is identical
to that of the Quarter Horse, with a height range of 15 to 16 hands. Its tem-
perament is much like that of the Quarter Horse too — mellow, easygoing,
and eager to please.
The Paint Horse has become wildly popular during the last two decades and
can be readily seen in stables and show arenas throughout the country. Most
Paint Horses are shown in western classes, although an occasional Paint is
seen in dressage, hunt-seat, and other English events. Paints also make excel-
lent companions and trail horses.
Quarter Horse
In the 1600s, American colonists bred horses kept by the Chickasaw Indian
nation to horses they had imported from England. The result was the begin-
nings of the American Quarter Horse, a breed that later developed to its 
present state in the American West. Used to herd cattle and carry cowboys
across the arid desert in the 1800s, the Quarter Horse has a rich and glam-
orous history. The breed earned its name as a result of its ability to run a
quarter of a mile distance faster than any other breed, a feat it still accom-
plishes today.
46
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

The Quarter Horse is a sturdy horse with a small head and muscular neck.
The breed’s hindquarters are powerful, and its legs are straight and solid.
Quarter Horses come in a number of different colors, including sorrel, chest-
nut, bay, black, dun, grulla, palomino, roan, and gray (see the color section for
photos showing various horse colors). They have a big height range, standing
anywhere from 14.3 to 16 hands tall.
One of the Quarter Horse’s most outstanding features is its disposition. This
quiet temperament is a big reason behind the Quarter Horse’s huge popularity.
Well-known for its steady, easygoing personality, the Quarter Horse makes a
good mount for beginning riders who need a quiet and forgiving horse to help
them learn.
In the show ring, Quarter Horses prevail in western events; you see them
most often in cattle-working competitions, western-pleasure classes, and
gymkhana events (see Chapter 18). The Quarter Horse is the most popular
breed of horse in the world, and numbers in the millions.
Saddlebred
The American Saddlebred horse was developed in Kentucky in the early part
of America’s history, using Morgans (see the section earlier in this chapter),
Canadian horses, Narragansett Pacers (now extinct), and horses of Spanish
breeding. The goal of the people who created the Saddlebred breed was to
develop a horse that could comfortably carry riders across Eastern terrain.
The Saddlebred is a gaited horse, capable of performing a four-beat gait called a
rack and a stepping pace in which the legs on each side move nearly in unison
with each other, in addition to an animated walk, trot, and canter. Saddlebreds
with these two extra gaits are called five-gaited Saddlebreds; they’re used in
the show ring. Not all Saddlebreds are born with the ability to move at the
rack-and-stepping pace. The ones that move only in the breed’s high-stepping
walk, trot, and canter are referred to as three-gaited.
Saddlebreds typically have long, arched necks and fine heads that they carry
rather high. The Saddlebred’s body is lithe and lean, almost like that of a human
ballet dancer. Saddlebreds range in height from 15 hands to 17 hands high.
The most common colors for this breed are bay, black, brown, chestnut, sorrel,
and gray. Known for having spirited, but willing temperaments, Saddlebreds
are easily trained, according to the people who ride them.
In the breed show ring, Saddlebreds are exhibited as either five-gaited or
three-gaited and usually in saddle seat. Driving classes also are popular for
this breed. Despite their innate penchant for being flashy, Saddlebreds also
make good pleasure horses and are shown even in open-breed events like
dressage and gymkhana.
47
Chapter 3: Perusing Popular Horse Breeds

Standardbred
If you’ve ever seen harness racing, then you’ve seen a Standardbred horse.
Standardbreds originated during the early part of American history and were
created specifically to race under harness at either the trot or the pace.
Standardbreds have an inborn ability to move at great speeds without gallop-
ing. Some members of the breed are natural born trotters and can trot at nearly
30 miles per hour. Others are born pacers (where the legs on one side move
in unison) and can attain the same speeds. The early training of prospective
Standardbred racehorses fine-tunes these innate skills while discouraging the
urge to gallop. However, Standardbreds are physically capable of galloping, as
is evidenced by the many Standardbred pleasure horses that do so every day.
The Standardbred is closely related to the Thoroughbred (which we cover later
in this chapter), although the Standardbred is considerably more muscular.
Standardbreds have rather large heads and powerful thighs. They usually
measure anywhere from 15 to 16 hands, and come in bay, chestnut, brown, gray,
and black. The Standardbred’s disposition typically is gentle and trainable.
Although the majority of Standardbreds are used for harness racing, many
retired racehorses are used as show horses and pleasure mounts. You can see
them competing in a variety of different events including western classes and
even dressage.
Tennessee Walking Horse
A group of American breeds was used to create the Tennessee Walking Horse
in the early part of the 18th century. Southern plantation owners needed a
mount that was capable of covering quite a bit of ground and doing so com-
fortably. Early Tennessee Walking Horses worked in the fields, carried their
owners long distances, and pulled the family wagon on weekends.
The Tennessee Walking Horse is a gaited horse that can perform the walk,
trot, and canter, in addition to the four-beat running walk for which it is
famous. A well-gaited Tennessee Walking Horse gives its rider the impression
of floating on air.
Tennessee Walking Horses have a straight head with larger-than-usual ears. The
breed has a gracefully arched neck, prominent withers (or front shoulders), and
large hooves. They come in just about any horse color. Ranging in height from
15 to 16 hands, Tennessee Walking Horses tend to be easygoing in personality.
Shows featuring the Tennessee Walking Horse emphasize the breed’s gaited
aspects. However, in open shows where many breeds compete together, you
find Tennessee Walking Horses in all kinds of varied events. Many Tennessee
Walking Horses are used as trail horses, too.
48
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Thoroughbred
The Thoroughbred was developed in England in the 1700s strictly for the 
purpose of racing. The breed later was imported to the American colonies,
where it ultimately influenced other breeds such as the Standardbred and
Quarter Horse (see the sections about these breeds earlier in this chapter).
Thoroughbreds are the fastest horses in the world, and can reach speeds of
40 miles per hour on the racetrack. But racing isn’t their only talent. You typi-
cally see Thoroughbreds in the show ring, where they make terrific jumpers
and dressage mounts.
The typical Thoroughbred has a straight head, high withers, and long, fine
legs. Standing anywhere from 15 to 17 hands high, Thoroughbreds have a
lean, lanky appearance that sets them apart from other breeds. The colors
you most often see in this breed are bay, chestnut, black, brown, and gray.
Although Thoroughbreds are willing horses, they can be somewhat compli-
cated in temperament, meaning they can be hard for some people to figure out.
Beginning riders sometimes have trouble handling Thoroughbreds because
of their spunky personalities.
The Thoroughbreds you most commonly see in stables and backyard pas-
tures are retired racehorses and horses bred specifically for the show world.
Most of the horses shown in hunt-seat competitions are Thoroughbreds,
although this breed also does well in other English events, such as dressage,
three-day eventing, and show jumping.

Chapter 3: Perusing Popular Horse Breeds
Making the grade horse
Oh sure, everyone wants a purebred. But what
about grade horses, those mutts of the equine
world whose parentage is unknown? Does
horseland hold a place for them?
You’d better believe it. Although everyone
makes a fuss about purebred horses, the fact of
the matter is that most companion horses are
grade horses. These horses make wonderful,
loyal, and loving equine companions despite the
fact their individual heritages are one of life’s
great mysteries.
Experienced horse people can usually spot a
breed type in any grade horse, and can tell you
whether a particular grade is a Quarter Horse,
Thoroughbred, Arabian, or Morgan horse type.
But regardless of the breed type evident in any
grade horse, what’s most important is the horse’s
health and personality.
Although the purebred world sometimes looks
down on grade horses, grade horses perform
the role of companion just as well or better than
any purebred. Some of the best trail and plea-
sure horses in the world are grade horses.
People who love these special horses don’t
mind living with the mystery of the horse’s
parentage.

Going Beyond the Top Ten
Not all breeds have substantial numbers of horses in their ranks. Plenty of
smaller, lesser-known breeds exist and are popular among certain factions of
the horse world. These types of horses have characteristics that set them
apart and make them attractive to people who want something specific from
their horses.
We cover several types of smaller breeds in the following sections. Check out
Chapter 2 if you want general information about horse parts, colors, markings,
and movements, and see Chapter 18 for the scoop on equine competitions.
Crossbreds
Although purebreds are the name of the game for many people, some prefer
crossbred horses. Crossbred horses possess characteristics from both of the
breeds in their parentage, which is why some people prefer them to purebreds.
They believe they’re getting the best of two breeds instead of one.
Some crossbreds have their own registries, such as the Morab (Morgan/
Arabian), Azteca (Andalusian/Quarter Horse), and National Show Horse
(Standardbred/Arabian). Others are recognized by the registry of one of the
parent breeds, such as the Appaloosa (may have one Quarter Horse, Arabian
or Thoroughbred parent), Quarter Horse (may have one Thoroughbred parent)
and Paint (may have one or two Quarter Horse parents).
Other crossbreds are just experiments conducted by individual breeders that
can feature any two breeds that someone decided to put together. Cross-
breeding has been a staple of the equine industry for centuries and has
resulted in the development of a number of pure breeds. It also results in
grade horses, which are the well-loved mutts of the equine world (see the
nearby “Making the grade horse” sidebar).
Draft breeds
Draft horses are living relics of humanity’s agricultural past. Originally bred
for hundreds of years to pull heavy loads, draft breeds were used only until
recently to work farms around the globe. When motorized tractors replaced
draft horses in agricultural society, these magnificent creatures nearly died
out. The work and dedication of people who love these horses saved draft
horses from sure extinction.
50
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Today, draft horses are used mostly for showing and exhibition, although some
still are used to work small farms and perform other hauling jobs not suited to
trucks and tractors. Draft horses are also ridden, and because of their docile
temperaments, make wonderful — if not rather large — companions.
Although draft horses still are considered rare, you can find several breeds
of them in North America. Each of the breeds in the following sections has
an American registry and a good number of devotees in various countries.
Belgian
American Belgians differ somewhat from their European counterparts. Belgians
in the United States are larger, heavier horses than those seen in the breed’s
native country. American Belgians stand around 18 hands and are mostly seen
in one coloration: sorrel with a flaxen (blond) mane and tail.
These days, Belgians are used primarily in the show ring and for pulling con-
tests. Some Midwestern American farmers still use Belgian teams to work their
fields, as do many of the Amish in the United States. You can see a Belgian in
the color section.
Clydesdale
The Clydesdale probably is the most well-known of all the draft breeds, thanks
to Anheuser-Busch. Clydesdale horses have been pulling the Budweiser beer
wagon for decades, and are regularly seen in the company’s TV commercials
and in exhibitions around the country.
Clydesdales usually come in a bay coloration, although they can also be seen
in chestnut, black, brown, and roan. These horses can be anywhere from 16.1
to 18 hands in height. They have wonderful dispositions and are often used
for riding as well as pulling.
Percheron
Percherons are seen only in gray or black, and average around 16 hands in
height — a little on the short side for a draft horse. What they lack in height,
they make up for in bulk. They are strong and stocky horses.
You can ride Percherons or use them to pull carts and wagons; this breed is
shown extensively in the United States. They’re known for having calm per-
sonalities and being trainable.
Shire
Shires are attractive horses with heavy feathering around their fetlocks (ankles)
see Chapter 2 for a diagram on parts of the horse) and long fuzzy beards on
their jaws. They are medium height for a draft breed, measuring anywhere
from 16 to 17.2 hands.
51
Chapter 3: Perusing Popular Horse Breeds

Shires are shown in harness and at halter in the United States and in other
countries. The breed is often seen pulling beer wagons at events in Great
Britain, and some people still use Shires to haul goods in other parts of the
world.
Suffolk Punch
The Suffolk Punch, or simply Suffolk, is a smaller draft horse, measuring in at
around 16 hands. An unusual aspect to the breed is its single color; Suffolks
only come in chestnut (which devotees of the breed spell chesnut in the
archaic way).
Suffolks are still used to do field work and pull wagons for exhibitions, but
they’re also shown and ridden.
Gaited horses
Gaited horses are those breeds possessing one or more additional gaits in
addition to or instead of the usual walk, trot, and gallop found in so-called
nongaited horses (see Chapter 2 for more about these movements). These
unusual gaits were developed in these breeds by humans to make long-
distance riding more comfortable. Equestrians who love gaited horses
claim these horses are the most enjoyable mounts to ride.
Three-gaited breeds are among the most popular horses in the United States:
the Tennessee Walking Horse and the American Saddlebred (covered in ear-
lier sections of this chapter). Other, lesser-known gaited breeds are found in
the United States, each with its own fascinating history and characteristics.
Although the breeds highlighted in the following sections aren’t as common
as the ones that made it to the top ten, they are nonetheless available in many
parts of the country.
Icelandic Horse
The Icelandic Horse is a small but sturdy creature with its roots in Viking his-
tory. The breed developed in complete isolation for more than 1,000 years
and was the horse the Vikings used in their mounted exploits.
The Icelandic Horse is known for having either four or five gaits. In addition
to the walk, trot, and gallop, all Icelandic Horses possess a gait called the tolt,
which is similar to the Tennessee Walker’s running walk. Some Icelandics also
have a gait called the flying pace, where the legs on each side of the horse
move in unison.
52
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

The Icelandic looks somewhat like a pony and measures only 12.3 to 14 hands
in height. However, despite its small size, the Icelandic is considered a horse
breed and not a pony breed. Full-grown men can easily ride this rugged little
animal. (See the section on pony breeds later in this chapter for more about
ponies.) These horses are ridden for pleasure and are good in the show ring.
Missouri Fox Trotter
The Missouri Fox Trotter was created by Missouri cattlemen in the 1800s to
carry riders across long distances of rough terrain and to work cattle. Because
the Missouri Fox Trotter was intended to be ridden for long periods of time,
a comfortable gaited aspect was bred into this willing horse. As a result, the
Missouri Fox Trotter has a special trot exemplified by a four-beat gait instead
of the usual two beats found in a typical trot.
Missouri Fox Trotters are handsome horses, measuring between 14 and
16 hands. They have easygoing personalities and generally are considered
a good horse for beginners to ride and to show.
National Show Horse
The National Show Horse is a relatively new breed created in the 1980s by
crossing Arabians to American Saddlebreds. The resulting horse turned out
to be a flashy and refined animal perfect for the show ring.
As a result of its Saddlebred heritage, the National Show Horse possesses
two other gaits besides the walk, trot, and gallop. National Show Horses are
capable of performing the slow gait and the rack, both four-beat gaits that
are comfortable to ride.
National Show Horses are on the taller side, standing 15 to 16 hands in height.
They come in a variety of horse colors, and tend to be spirited. Their primary
use is in the show ring (hence the name), where they can show off their high-
stepping gaits.
Paso Fino
You most often see the Paso Fino breed in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Colombia,
although it has quite a few fans in the United States, too. Paso Finos originally
were created by crossing Spanish Andalusians (see the “Rare breeds” section
later in this chapter) with the now extinct Spanish Jennets a couple of cen-
turies ago.
The Paso Fino gaits include the paso fino, paso corto, and the paso largo. Each
gait varies in speed and is a four-beat lateral gait (each foot hits the ground
separately, and the legs on each side move in unison) is extremely comfortable
to ride, and covers considerable ground. Some Paso Finos can also canter.
53
Chapter 3: Perusing Popular Horse Breeds

Paso Finos typically measure around 14 to 15 hands in height and have a pleas-
ing and distinctive conformation. Paso Finos possess a personality trait known
as brio, which means controlled spirit. Horses with brio are full of energy but
are completely under the rider’s control. Superb on the trail, Paso Finos also
are shown extensively in their special gaits.
Peruvian Paso
Peruvian Pasos have found a devoted following in the United States.
Developed in Peru in the 1800s to carry landowners across vast areas of
the country, the breed contains the blood of Spanish Andalusians, Arabians,
and Thoroughbreds.
Peruvian Pasos possess three gaits: the paso llano, the sobreandando, and the
huachano. Each of these gaits is a four-beat lateral gait and is designed to be
comfortable while covering considerable ground. Peruvian Paso horses that
are in top condition can maintain these gaits for hours on end.
Peruvian Pasos are on the small to medium side, measuring 14.1 to 15.1 hands
in height. They have well-muscled necks and long, thick manes and tails.
They make excellent trail horses, and are shown under saddle in their nat-
ural gaits. You can see a Peruvian Paso in the color section.
Racking Horse
The Racking Horse is not as easy to define as most other breeds of horses.
Racking Horses shared a history with the Tennessee Walking Horse (covered
earlier in this chapter) until 1971, when a group of Alabama horsemen broke
off from the Tennessee Walking Horse breed for political and economic rea-
sons, and started a registry for what they dubbed the Racking Horse. A few
years later, in 1975, the House and Senate of the Alabama Legislature named
the Racking Horse the official state horse of Alabama.
What makes the Racking Horse so special is that it is a gaited breed, able to
perform a four-beat racking gait, in addition to a walk and a canter.
Racking Horses have graceful builds, with long, sloping necks. Their legs are
smooth and their hair finely textured. The typical Racking Horse averages
around 15.2 hands, and comes in a number of colors including sorrel, chest-
nut, black, roan, white, bay, brown, gray, yellow, dun, and palomino. You may
also see a pinto coloration, known within the breed as spotted. These horses
are willing to work and eager to please their handlers.
Riders exhibit Racking Horses in saddle-seat and driving classes that are meant
to show off their racking gait, but they also show less flashy individuals in more
traditional pleasure classes. Racking horses make good trail horses and are
popular for simple pleasure riding.

Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Pony breeds
By definition, a pony is a small type of horse standing less than 14.2 hands at
the withers. However, a distinction exists between a true pony and a horse
that is simply on the short side. Not every horse under 14.2 hands is consid-
ered a pony, and not every pony over 14.1 hands is considered a horse. Ponies
are members of distinctive pony breeds. In other words, you can’t breed two
Thoroughbreds or two Arabians and get a pony. Breeders produce a pony by
breeding two ponies, or by breeding a pony to a small horse.
Ponies tend to be hardy little creatures. Most pony breeds developed in
harsh European climates with rugged terrain; they had to become durable
and levelheaded to survive.
Most adults are too big to comfortably ride a pony (neither the pony nor the
adult will be happy), although a smaller adult can do fine with a larger pony.
If you want a mount for your child, however, a pony can certainly do the job.
The following pony breeds are popular in North America:
 Shetland: The Shetland pony is the creature people most often think
about when they hear the word pony. This breed is one of the smaller
ponies around. Shetlands make excellent mounts for young children as
long as the ponies — and the kids — are properly trained. American
Shetlands are usually around 11 hands high and come in a wide variety
of horse colors.
 Welsh Ponies: These ponies come in four different types: the Welsh
Mountain Pony, the Welsh Pony, the Welsh Pony of Cob Type, and the
Welsh Cob. Each of these four names represents different heights and
conformation types within the Welsh breed. Okay, we know it’s confus-
ing, but stay with us. If you think of each type in terms of its height, it gets
a little better: The Welsh Mountain is 12.2 hands or shorter; the Welsh
Pony 12.2 to 13.2 hands high; the Welsh Pony of Cob Type is 13.2 hands
high or less; and the Cob Type is actually horse-sized at 14 to 15.1 hands
tall. All versions of Welsh Ponies make excellent equine companions for
children. The taller ones are big enough for some smaller adults. Check
out a Welsh Pony in the color section.
 Connemara: The Connemara is a refined-looking pony that excels in
jumping. Measuring on the tall side (13 to 14.2 hands), Connemaras
make suitable mounts for some adults and for children.
 Pony of the Americas: The Pony of the Americas, or POA as it is com-
monly called, originated from crossings with the Appaloosa horse and
the Shetland pony. POAs typically have Appaloosa markings, and are
good ponies for kids. In fact, the American POA breed association has
one of the most extensive youth show programs in the country. POAs
typically stand anywhere from 11.2 to 14 hands high.
55
Chapter 3: Perusing Popular Horse Breeds

Warmbloods
In the 1980s, a European type of horse called the warmblood became popular
in the United States. Seen for years in international jumping and dressage com-
petitions, the warmblood suddenly became the horse of choice for Americans
who wanted to compete in the upper levels of Olympic disciplines like dressage,
jumping, combined training (or three-day eventing), and driving.
Several different warmblood breeds exist, each named for the region it comes
from, with its own distinct characteristics. What they all have in common is
a large stature, profound athletic ability, and a high price tag. Some of these
breeds are common in the United States and Canada, while others are only
available in Europe.
Here’s a list of the warmblood breeds you see most often in North America:
 Belgian Warmblood: Averages around 16 hands; good in show jumping,
eventing, and dressage
 Dutch Warmblood (check out one of these horses in the color section):
Average around 16.2 hands; known for talent in dressage and jumping
 Hanoverian: German breed known for abilities in dressage, eventing,
and jumping; averages 16 to 17 hands
 Holsteiner: Developed in Germany; averages 16 to 17 hands; excels in
driving, eventing, jumping, and dressage
 Oldenberg: Hails from Germany; averages 16 hands high; talented jump-
ing, dressage, and eventing horse
 Swedish Warmblood: Averages 16 hands; used for show jumping, dres-
sage, and eventing
 Trakehner: German breed used for jumping, dressage, and eventing;
averages 16 to 17 hands
Rare breeds
The world is full of horse breeds, many of them rather rare. Despite their small
numbers, a handful of these breeds have managed to capture the hearts of
horse lovers everywhere. You frequently see horses of these breeds in motion
pictures or at equine fairs and exhibitions around the world. Though their
numbers are scarce, they’re important members of the horse community and
worth taking a look at.
56
Part I: Beginning with Horse Basics 

Andalusian
The Andalusian horse, also known as the Pure Spanish Horse, is one of the most
spectacular studies in horseflesh on the planet. You see this horse in museum
pieces and paintings from the Middle Ages: Leonardo da Vinci sculpted this
horse, and the winged Pegasus was based on this breed. Because Andalusians
have been around for so long, they have been instrumental in the development
of other breeds such as the Peruvian Paso, Spanish Mustang, and Lipizzaner.
Andalusians have a distinctive look. Their necks are heavy and arched; their
manes and tails are long and wavy. With a regalness about them that’s hard to
equal, even a relatively untrained eye can easily spot this breed.
Andalusians are spirited horses used for showing and pleasure riding. The
majority of individual Andalusians in the United States are located in California,
although a number of other states have small populations of this beautiful
horse. Flip to the color section to see a photo of an Andalusian.
Friesian
The Friesian horse is hard to miss in a crowd. This regal, all-black equine has
been around for centuries, developed first in Holland. The Friesian has had a
great influence in the horse world, having been used to create a number of
European breeds.
Friesians usually stand around 15 to 16 hands in height, although their proud
carriage gives the impression that they are taller. Their manes and tails are
long and flowing, and they have heavy feathering on their fetlocks. The high-
stepping movement of the Friesian is a sight to behold.
During the last several years, the Friesian’s numbers have grown in the United
States, where the breed now sports around 2,000 individuals. Friesians are
being used successfully in dressage and in carriage work.
Lipizzaner
Lipizzaners are among the most well-known of all breeds, thanks to the famous
Lipizzaner stallions of Vienna. These highly trained stallions have gained noto-
riety the world over for their skill at performing classical dressage movements
also known as airs above the ground.
Lipizzaners originated in Austria as war horses and are now seen mostly in
Europe. A handful of Lipizzaners exist in the United States where they are
shown and used for exhibitions.
Lipizzaner foals are born dark brown or black and mature to a light gray
(nearly white). Adult Lipizzaners typically have thick, wavy manes and
tails and heavy, arched necks.
57
Chapter 3: Perusing Popular Horse Breeds

Lusitano
The Lusitano, a Portuguese breed, is closely related to the Andalusian horse
(covered earlier in this chapter). The two breeds had identical histories until
modern times, when Portuguese breeders developed the Lusitano into a sep-
arate horse from the Andalusian.
Although Andalusians typically are seen in a grey coloration, Lusitanos often
come in palomino, buckskin, dun, bay, chestnut, and other colors. Lusitanos
have a rounder head and body than the Andalusian and are more compact
and agile.
Lusitanos are seen in shows and exhibitions and are used for dressage and
pleasure riding.
Spanish Mustang
In the 1500s, Spaniards entered what is now the United States through New
Mexico, bringing with them a number of their horses to populate the New
World. The descendants of these original Spanish mounts are believed to be
a breed now known as the Spanish Mustang.
Spanish Mustangs once roamed wild in the American West and have come
to be exceptionally hardy and intelligent. They tend to be on the small side,
measuring around 14 to 15 hands. Known for their incredible endurance,
Spanish Mustangs make great trail horses and companions.
Wild horse
One of the most romantic histories in horsedom belongs to the American
wild horse, a creature that still inhabits certain parts of the United States.
Believed by many to be escaped descendants of those horses used to build
the American West, wild horses are protected by federal law. Consequently,
horse wranglers can no longer capture the wild ones and sell them for pet
food, a deplorable action that was rampant until the 1970s, when the Wild
Horse Protection Act was passed.
Despite official protection, wild horses still are at the center of political con-
troversy. Ranchers who use public lands to graze livestock want wild-horse
herds kept to a minimum to allow more cattle to be grazed on the land, but
many horse lovers believe the wild horse has first rights to the land. Ranching
interests usually win out of late, and the Bureau of Land Management periodi-
cally reduces the number of horses present on the land by rounding them up
and putting them up for public adoption. Anyone who can prove they have
access to proper horsekeeping facilities can pay a small fee to adopt a wild
horse. (See Chapter 5 for more about wild horse adoptions.)
Although young wild horses can be trained in much the same way as domesti-
cally born horses, adult wild horses need special handling to adapt to captivity.
For that reason, full-grown wild horses are not recommended for beginning
equestrians.

Selecting a Horse
and the Stuff that
Goes with Him

In this part . . .
T
he chapters in Part II tell you how to select and pur-
chase a horse of your own (and all the necessary gear,
too). Before you take the plunge, you need to look deeply
into yourself and make sure that horse ownership is a com-
mitment that you’re ready to make. Chapter 4 provides
the information you need to ensure that you’re entering
horse ownership with your eyes open. In Chapter 5, we
take you through the buying process itself, from evaluat-
ing the horse to signing the contract. Chapter 6 details all
the equipment you’ll need to ride and care for your horse.
And finally, in Chapter 7, we give you the scoop on hous-
ing your new companion.

ecoming a horse owner is a serious decision; it’s serious business.
Unlike skiing, golf, or tennis, horseback riding is a hobby that involves
a living, breathing creature. When you don’t feel like playing golf or aren’t in
the mood to ski, you can just toss your equipment into the garage and forget
about it until the urge strikes again. But owning a horse is different ballgame.
When you own a horse, you’re taking responsibility for another living being
that you must feed, groom, and even ride on days when you don’t feel like it.
A horse can’t sit in a corner while you decide to do something that better
suits your mood. Horses need regular care and attention, and they need TLC.
For these reasons, you need to consider some serious points before embark-
ing on the journey of horse ownership. In this chapter, we take a look at these
important considerations and give you some advice about preparing for the
day when a horse ultimately calls you “Mom” or “Dad.”
Finding Out Why You Want a Horse
When you find yourself developing the urge to own a horse, you need to do
some soul searching. We want you to ask yourself some profound and diffi-
cult questions. Not only does your happiness and enjoyment depend on the
answers you give, but so does a horse’s well-being.
We’ve heard too many stories of people coming into the horse world on a whim,
casually entering into horse ownership without realizing the commitment
involved. The final result: The newcomer grows unhappy, and the horse ends
up paying the price for it. The owner loses interest, and the horse winds up
standing in his stall for weeks or months at a time with little or no attention
other than a minimal amount of care. Or the animal ends up being sold for a

quick buck and is marked for the slaughterhouse. In extreme cases, the owner
abandons the horse, leaving it to slowly starve to death in a grassless pasture
because no one cares anymore.
Although these scenarios sound dramatic, they do occur. We know that you
don’t want to be guilty of inflicting any such unfair treatment on a horse, the
most noble and beautiful of all domestic creatures. That’s why you need to
probe deeply into your psyche to make sure that owning a horse is really
something you want to do. And we’re going to help you do just that.
Rating your reasons for wanting a horse
People are drawn to horse ownership for a number of reasons. Some of them
are good, and others are not so good reasons.
Maybe you’ve wanted a horse your entire life, but couldn’t afford one until now.
If so, you’re part of a fascinating, primarily female trend in the horse world.
As little girls, many women longed to have a horse of their own. In fact, a horse
obsession is almost a prerequisite to being a little girl, it seems. This little-girl
passion for horses apparently reached an all-time high in the 1950s and 1960s.
And now these once-obsessed little girls are all grown up and have the dispos-
able income to fulfill their dreams.
Men are not exempt from this phenomenon. More than one little boy grew up
wanting to be a cowboy riding on a swift steed and galloping off into the sunset.
For many men, that John Wayne fantasy never went away, and horse owner-
ship makes that fantasy a reality — well, sort of.
Wanting a horse to fulfill a dream is fine as long as you realize all the real-life
responsibilities that come with horse ownership. Here’s a list of the not-so-
glamorous things you’ll be dealing with after taking the ownership plunge:
 Unappealing jobs: You won’t only be riding your horse, you’ll also be
feeding him, grooming him, and cleaning up after him. The feeding and
cleaning part is especially true if you’re keeping the horse on your own
property. Mucking stalls is hardly one of the more romantic aspects of
horse ownership, yet the task is inevitable and just about every horse
owner does it at some point in his or her life. Although horse manure
doesn’t smell anywhere near as bad as dog doo, you still won’t relish
the job. (Check out Chapters 8 and 9 for feeding and grooming details.)
 Assuming total responsibility: The horse is completely dependent on
you for food, water, exercise, and attention, so you must be willing to
make the horse’s needs a priority in your life. That means no going out to
the karaoke bar with your friends after a hard day at the office until after
you feed your horse. It also means braving any kind of weather Mother
Nature throws at you — and she can have a pretty wicked aim — to get
your horse out for grooming and exercise — whether you feel like doing
62
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

it or not. The horse stands there waiting for you to show up and give it
the care it needs, and doing so is your responsibility. Period.
 Enslaving financial obligations: Owning a horse is downright expensive.
Many horse people sport a bumper sticker on their cars that reads,
“Poverty is owning a horse,” which is not that much of an exaggeration.
If you get lucky and end up with a horse that never gets sick or injured
and doesn’t need shoes or supplements, that bumper sticker may not be
for you. However, we’ve yet to meet anyone who owns such a creature,
so odds are that you’ll be regularly coughing up cold hard cash to tend
to your horse’s special needs.
Fulfilling a dream isn’t the reason that everyone is drawn to horse ownership.
Some people just love animals and find the idea of spending time and bonding
with a horse appealing. Others see people riding and think it looks like great
fun. Both are legitimate reasons for delving into horse ownership as long as
you understand the responsibilities and drawbacks of horse ownership that
we outlined in the preceding bulleted list.
Don’t fall prey to some of the not-so-good reasons for wanting a horse:
 Zoning ordinances: You just bought a house in the country that happens
to be zoned for horses, and even though you’ve never had an interest in
horses before and aren’t terribly interested in them now, you feel like you
need to have one, well, because you can.
 Lawn ornaments: You think that horses are attractive creatures, and even
though you don’t have any great urge to care for or ride one, having a
horse on your property would make your yard look nicer.
 Junior wants one: You don’t have much interest in horses, but your
child wants one. Your child has never ridden a horse before, but rather
than giving him lessons first, you’d rather just buy a horse right away.
 Romance: You have absolutely no experience with horses but think that
the whole notion of riding is romantic. Rather than take lessons first to
see whether you actually enjoy riding, you decide to buy a horse instead.
 Spare change: You just inherited a little bit of money and want to spend
it all on buying a horse. You think that the biggest expense in horse own-
ership is the purchase price, so you aren’t worried about maintenance
costs.
If any of these scenarios sound like you, stop before you buy a horse and think.
None of the reasons in this list is adequate for taking on the huge commitment
and responsibility of horse ownership. You first need to do much more research
into what owning a horse is all about. Most important, you have to develop a
genuine interest in horses before taking the plunge into owning one. Horses
require a huge commitment of time, money, and energy, and if you aren’t sin-
cerely dedicated to your equine charge, the responsibility soon feels more
like a burden, and ultimately, you and the horse will suffer.
63
Chapter 4: Preparing to Make Your Purchase

Determining whether you’re ready
Before you accept the challenge of horse ownership, you must prepare your-
self for the experience by developing a basic knowledge of horses and what
owning one is all about.
Forfeiting the green: The money factor
Money — and how much of it you have — is a big thing to consider when
you’re debating whether to buy a horse. Horses are expensive animals to
have around, and knowing exactly how expensive before you go out and buy
one is imperative.
Find out the costs of various aspects of horse ownership in your area and
make sure that the total amount fits in your budget. Following is a rundown
of what costs you can expect to incur.
Starting up: Initial costs
Buying a decent horse means shelling out some decent money. The cost of
horses varies considerably from one place to another, but expect to spend at
least $1,000 (usually more) for a pleasure horse and much more for an animal
you want to show.
In addition to the expense of getting the horse, you need to buy equipment
and supplies, including a saddle, saddle pad, bridle, halter, grooming tools,
and so on. Plus, you need riding apparel for yourself and possibly your family
(see Chapter 6 for details on horse equipment). All these things can really
add up. Depending on whether you buy these items new or used, you can
spend anywhere from $800 to $3,000 for all this gear.
If you plan to keep your horse on your own property, you also need enough
money to create the appropriate housing for the animal. This sum can be
substantial, depending on the amount of work you have to do (see Chapter 7
for details about housing a horse).
Keeping your horse: Maintenance costs
One big mistake that newcomers to the horse world make is underestimating
the cost of maintaining a horse. In most cases, the purchase sum is minimal
compared with the amount of money that keeping the horse requires.
Here is a list of the regular expenses you can expect with horse ownership.
The costs of each item or service vary considerably depending on where you
live, so we advise calling commercial stables, veterinarians, farriers (the people
64
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

who trim and put shoes on the horse’s feet), and tack and feed stores in your
area to get a sense of how much each of these items runs:
 Boarding: If you plan to keep your horse at a commercial boarding facil-
ity rather than on your own property, you pay a monthly fee for a stall,
pasture, or paddock (a fenced enclosure). This fee usually includes food
and stall maintenance; it may or may not include bedding.
 Bedding: If your horse is kept in a stall that you’re responsible for main-
taining, you have to provide shavings or another type of bedding, which
you must clean and freshen daily.
 Feed: If you’re keeping the horse on your own property, feed includes hay
and/or pasture maintenance. If you plan to give grain or other special-diet
foods to your horse, figure in that cost as well. See Chapter 8 for more
about horse feed.
 Supplements: Many horses benefit from including feed supplements in
their diets. If your horse needs these supplements, add this cost to your
monthly expenses.
 Shoes: Most horses require new shoes every 6 to 8 weeks. A farrier still
needs to trim the hooves of horses that don’t need shoes — because
they’re either not doing much work or have tough feet — every 6 to
8 weeks. (Chapter 10 has more info about shoeing and hoof care.)
 Preventative veterinary care: Regular health maintenance for most adult
horses includes vaccinations, deworming several times a year, and teeth
floating once or twice a year. Teeth floating doesn’t mean your horse’s
teeth will be set adrift in a bucket of Efferdent. Floating is another term
for filing them down. See Chapter 10 for details.
 Veterinary treatment: When a horse gets sick, the problem can be any-
thing from a minor illness to a situation that requires major surgery. As an
owner, you must be prepared to spend money on veterinary treatment
whenever your horse becomes ill.
 Insurance: If you insure your horse for major medical, mortality, loss
of use, and/or liability, add the premiums to your list of expenses. (See
“Investigating Horse Insurance” later in this chapter for more info.)
 Training/lessons: New horse owners with little riding experience need
to continue their own and their horse’s educations with a trainer or
riding instructor. Training is a must if you intend to show your horse,
and weekly training or lessons for horse and/or rider are an expense.
 Show expenses: If you plan to show your horse, you’ll spend money on
show clothes and tack, entry fees, and transportation. (See Chapter 18
for details on showing.)

Watching the clock: Time issues
Owning a horse is much more time consuming than people usually think. The
daily care of a 1,000-pound animal that can’t be housebroken is involved.
If you’re keeping the horse at home, and the horse is going to be in a stall,
you must find time to feed it two to three times a day and make time to clean
the stall (remove the manure and soiled bedding) at least once a day. Add the
time to do these chores to the amount of time you need to spend grooming
and exercising the horse, and you’re going to spend a noteworthy chunk of
your day on horse care.
Although a horse can be an ideal family companion, don’t expect your kids to
take on too much of the time responsibility. Sure, they can help out, but as
the adult, you’re the one ultimately responsible for the horse’s care and well-
being. And considering how most kids are about such things, you’ll probably
end up having to make time to do the work yourself.
Staying loyal: Commitment issues
You have to be willing to be there for your horse every day, rain or shine, time
or no time. You can ask yourself the following questions to help determine
whether you’re ready and willing to make this commitment:
 Am I willing to give up some of my other activities to spend time caring
for my horse?
 Am I willing to drop everything and run to my horse’s side should he
get sick?
 Am I willing to spend time giving my horse medicine or treatment if he
becomes ill?
 Am I willing to take time out of my busy day, each and every day, to
groom and exercise my horse?
 Am I willing to work with my horse to solve any problems the two of us
may encounter?
 Am I willing to perform the sometimes hard physical labor that horse
care calls for?
 Am I willing to think of my horse as a partner, one who deserves
the best care and treatment, regardless of the inconvenience I may 
experience?
 If I am buying this horse primarily for my children, am I willing to con-
tinue to care for him even if my children lose interest?
If you answered yes to all of these questions, then you’re ready to make the
commitment to horse ownership.

Exploring which way you want to ride
(and how you want to learn)
If you haven’t yet figured out how you want to ride, flip to Chapter 14 to decide
which discipline interests you most. Four popular styles are hunt seat, dres-
sage, saddle seat, and western. Figuring out in which discipline you want to
ride is one of the first decisions you need to make, because the way you ride
determines what kind of horse you buy.
Most horses are trained in only one or two of the disciplines, so you then
may want to get some riding experience in the discipline you’ve chosen to
make sure that you really like it before you commit to buying a horse and
tack that you can ride only in that style.
Learning to ride is one of the smartest things you can do before you go out
and buy a horse. Although this statement sounds obvious, if you don’t know
much about riding, you may not realize how hard it is and how much work
proper riding takes. After all, you need to know much more about riding than
just hopping up on the critter’s back — which isn’t that easy, either!
Some of the benefits of learning to ride before you get your own horse are
 Knowing for certain that riding is something you truly enjoy because
you’ve already been doing it.
 Having a good sense of what type of horse is best for you, based on your
riding style and skill level.
 Evaluating horses for purchase with better insight from being able to
ride them competently.
 Avoiding the risk of ruining a new horse with poor riding skills that can
disrupt its previous training.
 Enjoying your new horse right away, instead of spending precious bond-
ing time just trying to learn the basics of riding.
We cover a few ways to get some riding experience in the following sections.
Taking regular lessons
Formal riding lessons are the best way to learn how to ride a horse. In most
areas of the civilized world, riding lessons are relatively easy to come by.
Nearly every commercial boarding facility has trainers and instructors on
staff who give lessons by the hour. In the United States, both western and
English lessons are staples at commercial riding facilities.
67
Chapter 4: Preparing to Make Your Purchase

You look for riding lessons by cracking open the telephone book and search-
ing under the heading “Riding Academies.” If several riding facilities are
accessible to you, contact an equine veterinarian in your area for help 
choosing a good one. Tell members of the veterinarian’s staff that you’re
looking for beginning riding lessons and ask whether they can recommend
a good facility in the area.
After locating a facility, we recommend that you take an initial riding lesson in
the discipline of your choice, and if you like the instructor and the quality of
the experience, sign up for a series of lessons. Most facilities offer discount
packages of four or more lessons.
If you’re arranging riding lessons for your child, make sure that the facility
you call offers lessons for young riders in your child’s age group.
The number and type of lessons you ultimately take depends on what you
can afford and how much you still need to learn. We suggest that you take as
many lessons as fit your budget. Group lessons are less expensive and can be
a fun way to learn from watching others. Individual lessons cost more, but
you’ll get more personalized attention from the instructor.
Some people continue to take lessons for years, gradually moving up in their
individual training level just as any athlete does. You can never educate your-
self enough about riding. In fact, Olympic equestrian team members continue
to take lessons even after they’ve won gold medals!
Attending horse camps
A horse camp is another way that you can start riding. By attending a horse
camp, you can combine a vacation with an intensive riding experience.
Horse camps are resorts that specialize in equine activities. Most offer lessons
for beginners and enable you to spend a concentrated amount of time with
and around horses. The camps provide access to other activities — tennis
and hiking, typically — but you have the option of spending all your time
checking out horses. (See Chapter 19 for details on horse camps.)
Horse camps are a great way for beginners to start riding. However, plan to
continue your riding education when you return home from your vacation.
True, you’ll get a good foundation in the week or two that you spend at horse
camp, but this short amount of time isn’t enough for you to completely develop
your riding skills. Sign up for ongoing lessons at a local riding academy to give
yourself more time learning in the saddle.
68
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Participating in adult education programs
More and more community colleges and private learning centers are offering
introductory courses in riding for adults. These classes can be a great way to
have a first experience on a horse because they almost always include riding
lessons. Basic information on equine anatomy, care and feeding, grooming,
and other aspects of horsemanship often are often a part of these courses.
You can find these courses in the continuing education catalogs you get in
the mail, or use the Internet to browse the curriculum of the community col-
leges and private learning centers in your area.
Using breed club programs
A number of national breed clubs sponsor programs that introduce people to
the world of horses, particularly that association’s breed. These programs
match up beginning riders and experienced professionals within the given
breed. The goal is to give new riders more information about horses and to
assist them when they’re ready to purchase that breed of horse (for a list of
breed clubs, see the Appendix).
Avoiding rental stables
Rental stables are places where you can rent a horse in increments of one
hour and take the horse out on a trail ride, usually with a group. Instead of
offering riding lessons, these facilities stick you up on a horse and send you
on your way. Most rental stables offer nothing in the way of instruction and
plenty in the way of potential disaster. Stay away from them while trying to
acquire basic horsemanship skills.
Although you can find a few good rental stables, they are not common. At
most rental stables, the horses are poorly treated and make terrible mounts.
Because they’re ridden day in and day out by people who don’t even know
the basics of riding, they lose whatever training they may have had when
they first came to the place. Horses that are uncooperative and sometimes
even dangerous are the end result.
The sad truth is that most first riding experiences occur at these kinds of sta-
bles. Consequently, most first riding experiences are unpleasant ones. Ask your
non-horsy friends about the first time they ever rode a horse, and you’ll see
what we mean. Tales of horses trying to rub riders off on trees, horses rolling
on the ground with the riders still in the saddle, horses running back to barn
while the riders hold on for dear life — these all are common rental stable
stories.

Chapter 4: Preparing to Make Your Purchase

Establishing responsibility for your horse
Before you go out and start looking for a horse, figure out exactly who is
going to ride it. Is the horse just for you, or will your spouse or children
also be riding the animal?
When more than one person in your family is going to ride the horse, you
must consider those individuals as you’re figuring out which horse to buy.
The horse needs to be suitable for the family member with the least amount
of riding experience. If you’ve been riding for years, but your spouse has never
been on a horse before, get a horse that can take care of a rank beginner
(sorry, dear). Meanwhile, sign your spouse up for riding lessons.
If your children are the only ones who plan to ride the horse, then you’d
better be absolutely certain that they’re committed to riding (as committed
as a child can be anyway). After all, if your kids can’t even sit relatively still
through The Incredibles, they may not be ready for the amount of concentra-
tion that’s required in horseback riding. Make them take riding lessons for at
least a year before you actually buy a horse. If they’re still enthusiastic about
riding after taking instruction for that long, then they’ll probably stick with it
after you purchase a horse.
Deciding between leasing or buying
Most people who want a horse have the impulse to buy one. Many horse
lovers have dreamed of having their own horse since childhood, and as adults,
are in the position to make it happen. However, owning a horse requires a
huge commitment in time and money. So, we heartily recommend another
option: leasing one.
Leasing a horse instead of or before you buy one gives you a great opportu-
nity to find out what horse ownership is all about before you commit to it.
When you lease, you function pretty much as a horse owner but without the
same financial or long-term pledges.
Shortages of horses that are available for lease never seem to occur. On the
contrary, leasing is a perfect arrangement for an owner who doesn’t have
time to ride the horse, doesn’t have the money to care for him, or no longer
has the desire or ability to ride. Why don’t people in these situations just sell
their horses? Because leasing enables them to stay in control of the horse’s
fate while eliminating some or all of the ownership responsibilities.
Although leasing can be a great way to test out your commitment to horse
ownership, the one pitfall is that you can find yourself growing attached to
the horse you’re leasing, only to discover that the owner refuses to sell the
animal or wants to sell but you can’t afford to buy.
70
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

We give you the scoop on leases in the sections that follow.
Deciphering different types of leases
Leases, which often are flexible, can work in a number of different ways.
The one you ultimately choose needs to be the one best suited to your own
needs and wants. Some examples of common lease arrangements include:
 Full leases: The owner leases the horse out completely, letting the lessee
keep the horse in the facility of his or her choice. The lessee pays a flat
fee upfront on the lease for a given amount of time (usually a year) and
assumes all of the horse’s maintenance costs, including food, shoes, and
routine veterinary care. In most cases, if the horse becomes seriously
ill or is injured, the owner is responsible for the horse’s medical bills.
These leases sometimes come with an option to buy the horse at the
end of the lease term. Consider this option if you want to get a realistic
taste of horse ownership before you commit to buying one or if you
don’t have the cash upfront to actually purchase a horse.
 Full leases with stipulations: The owner leases the horse to you but
requires that the horse be kept at the owner’s or another approved facility.
The lessee can ride the horse each and every day, but must request permis-
sion to trailer the horse off the property or do anything out of the ordinary
with the animal. Payment arrangements tend to vary considerably with
this type of lease. Owners sometimes charge a monthly fee for the lease,
which may or may not include the horse’s vet care and shoeing. This lease
arrangement is good whenever you want to get a sense of horse ownership
without the total commitment of buying. Because of the stipulations, these
kinds of leases often are cheaper than straightforward, full leases.
 Partial leases: With a partial lease, or half-lease, the owner leases the
horse to a lessee for riding only a few days a week. Oftentimes, the owner
rides the horse on the other days. Sometimes, the owner gives two half-
leases to two different people, who end up sharing the horse. In a partial
lease situation, the lessee rarely pays for any costs other than the leasing
fee. This option is great if time and/or money are limited.
Finding and choosing a horse to lease
Locating a good horse to lease is much easier than finding a good horse to
buy, in most cases. Here are some methods:
 Word of mouth: Asking around at boarding stables is one way to find
horses for lease. This method seems to work particularly well —
undoubtedly because of the strength of the horse-owner grapevine.
 Trainers: Horse trainers often have clients looking to lease out their
horses. Asking trainers in your area may turn up several options.
 Advertisements: If your area has a horse-oriented publication, check the
classified section for “for lease” ads. Tack and feed stores almost always
have bulletin boards with notices featuring horses for lease.
71
Chapter 4: Preparing to Make Your Purchase

When you consider leasing a horse, evaluate the animal as though you were
buying it. Because your commitment is limited in a leasing situation, you
don’t need to be quite as certain of your choice, but you still want to make
sure that the horse you choose is good for you. For more about characteris-
tics to consider when choosing a horse, see “Considering a Horse’s Traits”
later in this chapter.
If you’re going for a full lease, where you’re be responsible for all the horse’s
veterinary care, you may want to pay for a basic veterinary prepurchase
exam to ensure that the horse is healthy. People often don’t take this step
because of the costs involved, but you may want to consider it. Check out
Chapter 5 for more info about prepurchase exams.
Securing a written agreement
A lease is a business transaction, so put the details of the arrangement in
writing and have both parties sign the agreement. Having the agreement
looked over by an attorney before signing and then notarized upon signing
also is a good idea.
If the owner doesn’t offer a contract, draw one up yourself or have an attor-
ney do it for you. If the horse’s owner provides a contract, make sure that the
document includes these details:
 Names: Your name, address, and telephone number, and that of the
horse’s owner.
 Description: The name and a description of the horse, including age,
color, height, and registration number, if any.
 Purpose or intent: How you intend to use the horse — trail riding only,
showing in hunter classes, and so on. Write out all intended uses you
have for the horse (after discussing them with the owner).
 Equipment: Whether the lease includes use of the horse’s tack.
 Restrictions: What you won’t be doing with the horse. If the owner doesn’t
want you to trailer the horse off the property, for example, the owner
needs to stipulate that information in the lease.
 Care requirements: Any physical care the horse needs, including
grooming, exercise, feeding, and so on. Don’t forget to include any 
regular medications or treatments the horse is receiving.
 Riders: Who is permitted to ride the horse.
 Lease terms: How long the lease is for, and whether it’s renewable.
 Options: If you hope to buy the horse at the end of the lease, make sure
that the contract includes an option to buy.
 Price: The price you’re paying for the lease and how you’re going to
make payments.
72
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Insurance coverage: Details on what kind of insurance covers the horse,
particularly who is responsible for maintaining the premiums. If no insur-
ance covers the horse, indicate who is responsible if the horse is injured,
becomes ill, or dies. See “Investigating Horse Insurance” later in this
chapter for more about insurance.
 Medical care: State who is responsible for paying the horse’s medical
bills.
 Cancellation policy: Indicate whether the lease can be canceled, by
whom, and under what circumstances.
 Availability: If you’re signing a partial lease, spell out which days you
can ride and which days the owner or other lessee is using the horse.
Considering a Horse’s Traits
Okay, you’re certain that you want a horse, can afford it, have the time for it,
and you’re ready for the commitment. Now you need to start thinking about
what kind of horse you need. In the sections that follow, we provide you with
a few important characteristics to consider when thinking about what you’d
like in a horse. In Chapter 5, we get into deeper details on horse selection.
Thinking about a horse’s age
Age is an important factor when selecting a horse, for reasons we’ll explain in
the sections that follow.
Knowing why age matters
The idea of getting a young horse may be appealing because of the potential
for the animal to live longer than an older horse. However, you can’t go in a
worse direction when purchasing a first horse. Young horses typically are
inexperienced and full of bugs. They don’t have much confidence or knowl-
edge, and their training usually is only cursory. Combine these elements with
an inexperienced horse owner or rider, and you have a recipe for disaster.
The notion that a young, untrained horse and an inexperienced rider can
learn together is a romantic one that doesn’t cut it in the real world. In these
situations, the horse generally becomes unmanageable, the rider becomes
miserable, and the relationship dissolves into disaster.
When you’re learning to ride and care for a horse, your best teacher is an
older, wizened horse that forgives your mistakes and helps show you the
right way to do things. Horses older than 6 years are adults and capable of
the kind of equine maturity and experience that you need in a first horse.
73
Chapter 4: Preparing to Make Your Purchase

For example, coauthor Audrey Pavia got her first horse at the age of 13. She’d
been riding for a couple of years but definitely was a neophyte when it came
to horse ownership and serious riding. The horse her parents chose for her
was a quiet, affectionate, older mare named Peggy, who was about 15 years
old. Peggy had seen it all — including little kids who didn’t really know how
to ride — and she patiently taught Audrey much of what she, your humble
author, now knows about horses.
Breaking down age differences
The horse world has standardized ways of evaluating horses by their age.
In humans, we think of youngsters, teenagers, adults, and senior citizens.
Well, equine equivalents of these stages of life exist, too. You may be sur-
prised to see how horse age groups are similar to human age groups.
Although horses tend to age somewhat differently based on breed (larger draft
and warmblood breeds take longer to mature than smaller, lighter breeds),
what follows is a generalization about how you can categorize horses by age.
Looking at horses’ ages in this way helps you get a sense of who they are at
any given point in their lives:
 Foals: Foals are baby horses, anywhere from newborn to the age when
they are weaned from their mothers (4 to 6 months, usually). Foals are
physically awkward and curious about their surroundings, not unlike
human infants and toddlers.
 Weanlings: Weanlings usually are anywhere from 4 to 6 months in age.
As the term suggests, they are babies who have been removed from
their mothers. In human terms, weanlings are equivalent to preteens.
 Yearlings: Yearlings are young horses that have reached their first year
of life. They are the equine version of a teenybopper.
 Young horses: Horses in this category are 2 to 3 years old and are just
starting to be trained for riding. These are formative years for a horse,
and equivalent to the older teenage years for a human. These horses
tend to be harder to work with because they’re not yet mentally mature.
Physically, they’re pretty much grown up, but they still have plenty of
mental growth to go. Horses in this age range are not usually suitable
for beginning riders because of their lack of training and maturity.
 Young adult horses: Horses in the range of 3 to 6 years old are in their
peak learning phase. The majority of a horse’s basic training takes place
during this stage of life. As the horse slowly matures physically and 
mentally, he becomes ready to take on the role of serious worker and
companion. The human equivalent to this age group is the late teens to
early 20s. Most horses in this age group still are learning and so often
are not right for beginning riders. Exceptions to this rule do exist, and
mellow horses in this age bracket can be found.
74
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Adult horses: This category is for horses between 6 and 14 years of age.
Horses in this age group have matured physically and mentally, and most
of their training is complete, so they’re ready to do their jobs happily.
Adult horses are similar to humans in their late 20s to late 40s. Horses at
these ages can make good companions for novice riders, provided their
training has been good and they aren’t too full of energy.
 Senior horses: Horses 15 years old and older are seniors. Just like humans
in their senior years, 15-year-old horses start to become arthritic and
may have other health problems. When a horse reaches the age of 20, it
moves into the upper reaches of the senior range (the human equivalent
of the mid-60s and 70s age bracket). Horses at this age usually make
good mounts for beginners. They have seen it all and done it all, and not
too much fazes them. They tend to be mature, mellow, and forgiving of
beginning riders.
Studying horse bodies
A horse that has a better build, or conformation, is the one most capable
of doing the work humans ask of them. If you take time to study a horse’s
structure and anatomy, you develop an eye for what horse people call good
conformation. Horses with good conformation are the ideal for most horse
people. The following sections tell you how to spot both good and bad con-
formation. (See Chapter 2 for additional general info on horse parts.)
Recognizing normal conformation
Before you can spot the abnormal (covered in the following section), you
need an idea of how a horse with normal conformation looks. When viewing a
horse’s legs from the front, drop imaginary line from the top center of the leg
(at chest level) down to the ground. The centerlines on the legs of a horse
with good conformation essentially split each leg in half all the way to the
ground and appear to be parallel with each other.
Do the same thing when looking at the foreleg from the side. In your mind,
draw a line from the top center of the leg all the way to the ground. A horse
with good conformation has a centerline that splits the leg to the level of the
fetlock (the horse’s ankle), and then falls to the ground just behind the heel.
(See Figure 4-1 for front and side views of straight legs.)
When you view the hind leg from the side, imagine a line from the back of the
hindquarters to the ground. In a horse with good conformation, this line runs
along the back of the cannon bone to the bulbs of the heels. (See Figure 4-2 to
see correct hock angles. The hocks are the elbows of the back legs).

Although these lines and angles may sound like a lesson from geometry class,
they’re important indicators of the effects of concussion, the impact of weight
on the ground as it’s felt through the horse’s legs and hooves when it moves.
A horse with proper leg angles is able to absorb the concussion more effec-
tively and efficiently, thus placing less stress on its joints than a horse with
the wrong angles. A horse with good angles is more likely to stay sound and
healthy into old age than a horse with poor angles.
Detecting conformation faults
No horse is perfect. Every horse — just like every human — has some physical
characteristic that is less than pleasing to the eye. In horses, these conforma-
tion faults not only affect the appearance of the horse, but also the horse’s
ability to function properly in its work.
Just because a horse has some conformation faults doesn’t necessarily make
it a bad horse; however, being aware of those faults can help you know your
horse’s limitations. Ask a vet, trainer, or wise horsy friend to help you learn
to spot these faults.
Leg faults are a common problem for horses and can cause performance and
health troubles. Spotting conformation faults in horses helps you anticipate
a horse’s potential troubles. Here’s a list of some typical leg conformation
faults that can affect a horse’s health or ability. You can learn to recognize
them by sight. To spot these, view the horse when it’s standing still and alert:
 Base narrow: Base narrow is the exact opposite of base wide (see next
item). When viewed from the front, the distance between the imaginary
centerlines of the legs is narrower at hooves than it is at the chest, mean-
ing they tend to point inward from top to bottom. This construction
occurs in wide-chested horses and tends to go with toed-in or toed-out
hoof conformations. Horses with base narrow legs carry more weight on
the outsides of their legs, which means that bruising, sidebone (where
cartilage in parts of the foot become bony and hard), and arthritis com-
monly occur in these horses, affecting the outside of the leg regardless
of whether the horse is toed-in or toed-out.
 Base wide: When viewed from the front, the centerlines of the legs of
horses with base-wide conformations are wider at the hooves than they
are at the chest, meaning they tend to point outward from top to bottom.
This fault tends to show up in narrow-chested horses and usually goes
hand-in-hand with toed-out hooves. As a result of this construction, the
horse carries more weight on the inside of the leg, so the hooves tend
to land on the inside first, creating more strain on the inside of the leg.
Horses with this conformation are more prone to problems on the inside
of the leg such as bruising, sidebone, and arthritis.
 Bowlegged: The centerlines of the legs of bowlegged horses, when viewed
from the front, arc outward at the knees. If the bow in the legs is severe,
the horse may be more prone to developing arthritis in the knees.
77
Chapter 4: Preparing to Make Your Purchase

 Calf knee: The forelegs of calf-kneed horses appear to bend backward at
the knee, when viewed from the side. When asked to work hard, horses
with this problem may suffer from chip fractures of the knee.
 Knee-sprung: Knee-sprung horses, which also are described as being
over at the knee, have forelegs that appear to bend forward, when
viewed from the side. If the problem is severe, the horse is prone to
developing issues with the sesamoid bone, with resulting lameness.
 Knock-kneed: The legs of horses that are knock-kneed, when viewed
from the front, have knees that appear to come together. If this con-
struction is severe enough, it can cause arthritis in the knees.
 Sickle hocks: With sickle-hock construction, the horse has too much
angulation of the hock and stifle. Sickle hocks are the opposite of being
straight behind, and can result in arthritis of the hock if severe enough.
 Straight behind: The straight-behind build means the horse has very
little angle to its hock and stifle. Horses that are straight behind are
much more prone to hock arthritis and locking kneecaps.
 Toed-in: Also called pigeon-toed, this conformation fault results in hooves
that point toward each other. The legs usually start to turn inward at the
level of the fetlock but may start as high as the point where the leg meets
the chest. This conformation causes the hooves to paddle, or swing out-
ward while moving, creating interference between the legs and possible
injury.
 Toed-out: Also known as splayfooted, toed-out hooves point away from
each other. Similar to toed-in conformation, the toeing out may start at
the fetlock or higher up the leg. Horses with this problem tend to wing,
or swing inward while they’re moving. Sometimes the hooves can wing
in to the point where they hit each other.
Looking at gender differences
Among humans are boys and girls and men and women. Horses, however,
have a whole slew of genders that we show you in the following list:
 Colts: Intact male horses younger than 4 years old, colts typically are full
of energy. The older ones are looking for females under every rock.
 Fillies: Females younger than 4 years old, fillies are the female horses
that hormone-enraged colts most eagerly seek. Like colts, fillies also
have considerable energy, but they aren’t as hormone driven as their
male counterparts, and they don’t hide under rocks.
 Geldings: Geldings are castrated males. Many horse people think geld-
ings make the best mounts because they aren’t plagued by hormones
and the distractions that often accompany surges of these chemicals.
78
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Mares: Mares are female horses ages 4 or older. We think that mares
make wonderful companions, although many people find some mares
difficult to handle whenever the mare comes into season (heat).
Hormones, you see.
 Stallions: Colts that are 4 years or older with their reproductive organs
intact are called stallions. They have a strong interest in breeding that
can drive them to distraction, so they aren’t recommended for beginning
riders. In fact, many boarding stables don’t permit them on the premises
because they sometimes are unruly. Only experienced horse handlers
have what it takes to train and manage most stallions.
Realistically, your choice of horse is limited to either mares or geldings. If you’re
thinking about a stallion, forget it. Few stallions are suitable for beginners, no
matter how romantic the notion of riding one is. And all stallions come with
logistical problems. For instance, most boarding stables won’t allow stallions
on the premises. If a stallion gets out of a pasture and impregnates a neighbor’s
mare, the situation is ripe for a lawsuit.
The question of whether to get a mare or a gelding is a big one to some
horse people and not something that everyone agrees upon. Many people
own only geldings, while others swear by mares. Some people don’t have a
preference one way or the other. The decision on whether to get a mare or
a gelding ultimately rests with you. If you don’t have a preference — most
people don’t — then just look for the best horse regardless of gender.
Investigating Horse Insurance
Before buying a horse, think about the possibility of getting insurance cover-
age on the animal. Your horse represents an investment in money, time, and
emotion, that makes insurance a good idea. Companies that specialize in
insuring horses offer many different kinds of equine insurance. Explore all the
types of insurance to see which ones you want to buy for your new horse:
 Major medical: Major medical policies for horses are similar to the ones
humans buy. The policy covers medical costs like diagnostic procedures,
surgery, medication, and visits by a vet associated with an illness or injury.
Preventative care is rarely covered. A deductible for each incident is
common with major medical policies. You must supply a veterinary
health certificate to assure that your horse has no preexisting condi-
tions at the time you take out the policy. Age restrictions often apply to
older horses; it’s rare to find a policy covering horses aged 15 or older.
Most companies require you to cover the horse for full mortality if you
want to insure for major medical.
We highly recommend major medical insurance. If your horse develops a
serious illness, veterinary bills can mount quickly.
79
Chapter 4: Preparing to Make Your Purchase

 Surgical: Surgical coverage is a medical policy that applies only to situa-
tions where surgery is required. You must also carry a full mortality policy
on the horse. If you can’t get or can’t afford major medical insurance,
surgical is the next best thing. It protects you and your horse if the animal
requires colic surgery or another operation.
 Full mortality: Full mortality insurance covers the horse if it dies because
of illness or accident and usually pays the estimated or declared value of
the horse. Full mortality coverage is effective if the horse is stolen and
not recovered. The insurance company requires a veterinary health cer-
tificate indicating that the horse is healthy. If your horse is older than 14,
you may have trouble finding coverage.
If you paid a substantial sum of money for your horse, full mortality
insurance is a must. Even if your horse didn’t cost that much, realize
that without this insurance, your horse’s unexpected death can result
in a loss of your investment.
 Limited mortality: Limited mortality usually only covers death as a result
of accident or other specified causes. Because the policy doesn’t cover
illness, the insurance company doesn’t require a health certificate.
You’re unlikely to need this insurance on your horse unless you have spe-
cial circumstances that place your horse at risk of an accident. A typical
example of special circumstances is shipping your horse cross-country.
If you insure your horse with a limited mortality policy, and your horse
dies in a trailer accident during the trip, the insurance company will pay
out the value of the horse.
 Loss of use: If the horse is injured or ill to the point where it can no longer
be ridden, loss of use insurance compensates you. You’ll be paid a pre-
determined sum, which is based on an amount of money agreed to by
you and the insurance company. Loss-of-use policies require that you
also carry some type of medical coverage.
Some horse owners like to have this option. Some policies allow the
owner to euthanize the horse and still collect loss of use, while others
allow the owner to keep the horse even though he can’t be used for the
specific purpose that the policy indicates.
The downside of loss of use coverage is that it is difficult to collect on
and many companies don’t allow the owner to keep the horse, which
means the horse is turned over to the insurance company, which likely
will sell it for slaughter.
 Personal liability: This type of insurance protects you if your horse
injures someone or damages property. Your homeowner’s insurance
may already provide you with this coverage. Carrying personal liability
on your horse is always a good idea, if you can afford it. You never know
when your horse could accidentally hurt someone or cause damage to
another person’s possessions.
80
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

The cost of insurance depends on where you live and the type of insurance
you purchase. If you plan to cover your horse for major medical and full mor-
tality — the most common insurance coverages used by the average pleasure
horse owner — expect to spend several hundred dollars a year.
To find an equine insurer, ask your veterinarian for a reference. You can also
peruse the advertisements of most any equine publication. Most insurers take
out ads regularly, both large ads and classified listings. Locate an insurance
plan that you want to use and be prepared to insure your horse the same day
you buy it. Doing so affords you maximum protection for your investment.
Finding Expert Help
You can never educate yourself enough when it comes to horses. Even the
most experienced, savvy horse people strive to gain more equine knowledge.
As a first-time horse owner, a whole world of information and experience
awaits you. And the best place to garner that knowledge is from the profes-
sionals who deal with horses: your trainer (or other equine expert), your 
veterinarian, and your farrier. These people can guide you and help you
with your new horse, so selecting them carefully is important. Take the time
to get to know how each of these individuals relates to you and your horse.
Before you go out and start horse shopping, line up some solid people to help
you with the task. Finding the right horse isn’t easy, but you have better chance
of making it happen when you have a decent trainer (someone who teaches
horses and humans) or riding instructor (someone who teaches humans),
veterinarian, and farrier to hold your hand through the process.
A trainer or riding instructor
For beginning horse people, we can’t stress enough the importance of getting
help from someone more experienced and knowledgeable about horses, both
before you buy your horse and afterward. Owning a horse for the first time
can be challenging, and few things are more terrible than the feeling you’ll
have if something goes wrong and you have no one to turn to for help. Having
someone to call when you have a question, someone to show you the ropes
and actually teach you, hands on, how to handle, ride, and care for your horse
can make all the difference in the world.
81
Chapter 4: Preparing to Make Your Purchase

A good horse trainer is the best person to help you with your search for a
horse. Horse trainers are able to evaluate a horse on the ground and from the
saddle. They can ride any horse you’re considering to make sure the animal
is safe and well suited to you.
Assuming you can’t find a qualified trainer, a riding instructor can assist you
with finding a horse, if he or she provides this service to clients. However,
an instructor may not to be willing to ride the horse for you to determine its
suitability, because many instructors do not provide this service.
How to find a trainer or riding instructor
You have a number of options when looking for a good trainer, or at the very
least a riding instructor, if no trainer is available in your area:
 Contacting an organization that certifies riding instructors: Listed in
the Appendix of this book, these organizations may be able to provide
you with the names of certified instructors in your area.
 Attending a few horse shows in your area: As you watch the classes,
you’ll notice trainers and riding instructors working with their students
on the sidelines. The trainer or instructor is the one functioning as a
coach of sorts, giving advice before the student enters the ring, and 
constructive criticism or congratulations after the class is over.
Find a good moment and approach a trainer or instructor who seems to
be working with students who are in your age range. Tell the trainer or
instructor that you’re a new rider, ask for a card, and get basic informa-
tion about that person’s program to make sure that he or she works with
beginners. The person you contact may not have time to talk to you at
length during the show but should be happy to discuss his or her program
with you over the phone at a later date.
 Looking in your phone book: Check under “Riding Academies.” Call a
few trainers or instructors and talk to them about their riding programs.
Let them know you’re a beginning rider who’s interested in learning horse-
manship so you can eventually purchase your own horse. Take note of
the person’s personality, and get a sense of whether you think you’ll work
well with that person.
 Asking around for a referral: Call a tack and feed store, a local equine
veterinarian, or just talk to some horse owners in the area. Ask for the
name of a trainer or instructor who works with beginning riders.
After you meet an expert or two with whom you’re interested in working, take
a few private riding lessons from that person (as opposed to group lessons).
The trainer or instructor should begin and end your lesson on time and should
pay complete attention to you during the session. You need to be comfortable
and compatible with the trainer’s teaching style.
82
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Be sure to choose a trainer or instructor who incorporates different aspects
of horsemanship in his or her program. You should not only learn to ride a
horse but also to groom it, put on its tack, lead it, and care for it after riding.
What to do if you can’t find a trainer or instructor
If you live in a small town or rural area, you won’t have many choices when it
comes to picking a trainer or riding instructor. In fact, you may not be able to
find one you like, or any at all, for that matter. If that’s the case, the next best
thing is another equine expert of some kind. The expert you find may be an
equine veterinarian, a horse breeder, a shoer, or even just another horse owner
who’s been working with horses for a long time and really knows his or her
way around a stable.
When you don’t have access to a professional horse trainer or riding instruc-
tor, you have to be creative in finding someone to help you with your horse.
Go to a local horse show and introduce yourself to the competitors. Call a vet
or farrier from the phone book. Do whatever is necessary to make contact with
people experienced with horses and willing to lend you a hand.
If the expert you come up with is an equine professional, you may have to
pay that person a fee to help you buy a horse, give you lessons, or teach you
other aspects of horsemanship. If the person is a stranger to you, you need to
at least offer to pay. Many horse people are more than willing to help a new
horse owner, and some will provide you with free guidance out of the kindness
of their hearts.
Several breed associations now offer mentor programs to help beginning riders
hook up with experienced horse professionals. See the Appendix for a list of
breed associations.
A veterinarian
An important person in the lives of you and your horse is your veterinarian.
The vet you choose ultimately provides your horse with regular preventative
care and is the one who shows up in the middle of the night when your horse
is colicking or has seriously injured itself. In emergency situations like these,
your veterinarian appears as a guardian angel coming to Earth to rescue you
from whatever trouble you and your horse have gotten into.
You won’t need a regular veterinarian until after you purchase your horse.
But you need to start searching now, because you need one for your prepur-
chase examination (see Chapter 5 for details).
83
Chapter 4: Preparing to Make Your Purchase

Before you actually start shopping for a horse, locate the veterinarian you
want to hire to do the examination. Begin your homework on this subject
long before you find a horse for the vet to look at. The night before you want
someone to conduct the exam is not the time to start shopping for a vet!
If you like the prepurchase veterinarian, you may want to consider keeping
that person as your regular vet after you purchase a horse. If that’s your plan,
make sure that you evaluate the veterinarian per our advice in Chapter 10.
A farrier
Before you buy your horse, you’d be wise to start looking around for a quali-
fied farrier. The farrier is the person who trims and shoes your new horse’s
hooves.
Finding a really good farrier is incredibly important. A good farrier helps keep
your horse’s legs and feet healthy and sound. A poor farrier can make your
horse lame and even permanently destroy his soundness.
Obviously, given the effect that your farrier has on your horse’s well-being,
the selection you make regarding this equine professional is rather impor-
tant. The best person to ask for a farrier referral is a veterinarian. For more
details on how to make the best possible choice in farriers, see Chapter 10.

B
efore making the big decision to buy a horse, you need to do some 
soul-searching about horse ownership so that you’re sure that buying a
horse is what you really want. You also need to have a good idea of which
riding discipline you and your family want to choose, what you want to do
with your horse, and how you’re going to house and care for your horse.
(Chapter 4 gives you the background information you need to know before
you go horse shopping.)
After you’re sure that you want to progress into the realm of horse owner-
ship, your next step is finding the right horse; however, doing so may not be
as easy as you think. Finding a horse can be downright difficult; moreover,
getting a horse with the disposition and physical capabilities to suit your
needs and personality is almost as challenging as trying to find the right
spouse — although much less stressful.
No need to fret, though! We’re going to walk you through the horse-buying
process in this chapter, and if you follow our advice, you should end up with
a wonderful equine companion that is just right for you.
Enlisting an Expert to Help You Shop
If you’re like most people, the first time you go out to a stable to look at a
horse that you think you might buy, you’re going to be nervous. As the seller
shows you the horse, you’ll be wracked with indecision and possibly a great

deal of angst. Among the legitimate and important questions you need to ask
yourself while shopping for a horse are:
 How do I know whether this horse is the right one?
 Will the horse and I get along?
Don’t panic — you don’t have to search for the answers to these questions
alone or by the seat of your pants. You can get help with your decision and
take your time making it. You can ask a trainer or an experienced horse person
to help you decide whether the horse has the right disposition. Horse trainers
are horse experts, and as such, a big part of their job is evaluating horses and
matching them with the right riders.
Enlisting the services of a knowledgeable, experienced, and reliable horse
trainer is imperative as you begin your horse-buying quest. Without the help
of someone who has this kind of expertise, you’re not likely to find the best
animal for you. (For details about finding the right trainer, see Chapter 4.)
If you live in a rural area, finding a professional trainer to help you with your
search may be next to impossible, but you still can get the kind of help you
need for your search from an experienced horse person. A local breeder or
show competitor may be happy to provide you with assistance. (Chapter 4
contains information on finding an alternative equine expert.)
The best person to take with you when shopping for a horse is the trainer
from whom you’ve been taking riding lessons or the one who’s going to give
you lessons on your new horse. This person has a relationship with you and
is more motivated to help you find the best horse. If you’ve been taking lessons
with a riding instructor rather than a trainer, talk to the instructor about his
or her experiences purchasing horses. If your instructor lacks experience in
this area, try to find a horse trainer to help you instead (see Chapter 4 for
tips on finding a good trainer).
The trainer/expert you hire goes with you to see horses for sale, watches
the seller ride and handle the horse, and takes the horse for a test ride, too.
Then it’s your turn to ride. The trainer/expert then gives you an opinion
about whether the horse is a good match for you. Sometimes, a potential
buyer falls in love with a horse, but the trainer/expert advises against buying
him. The decision ultimately is up to you, but we advise you to weigh heavily
on the recommendation of your trainer/expert. Trainers and experts some-
times are wrong — but usually not. If your trainer/expert doesn’t like the
horse, he or she probably sees something that your untrained eye doesn’t,
and you’d be wise to move on to the next prospect.
86
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Knowing Where to Find a Horse
Unfortunately, buying a horse is more complicated than going to the mall to
pick out a new china pattern. The process is complicated by the fact that you
can shop in more than one type of place.
The best sources of horses for sale are individual sellers, horse dealers, and
breeding and training operations. If you’d prefer adopting rather than buying
a horse, rescue groups usually have them available and so does the occasional
private individual. In the end, although your horse comes from just one of
these sources, you don’t have to limit your search to only one. Check out
each of the following horse sources as you conduct your quest, and then
settle on the ones that feel right for you.
87
Chapter 5: Making the Big Buy
Using caution when e-buying a horse
The Internet has changed the way many things
are accomplished and that includes horse shop-
ping. Whereas horse shoppers used to be lim-
ited to whatever horses were available locally,
the Internet has broadened the horizon of the
market for horses to include animals all across
the country and even around the world.
Web sites dedicated to buying and selling horses
are plentiful on the Internet, leaving horse shop-
pers with the new dilemma of whether to buy a
horse that is outside of their immediate vicinities.
Plenty of horse people make long-distance pur-
chases, using videotapes and a trip out to where
the horse is located to check out the animal.
First-time horse buyers probably are better off
buying a horse locally, because of all the com-
plications of purchasing on line and via long dis-
tance. A vet conducting a prepurchase exam
and simply spending time with the horse are
two important issues that buying long-distance
makes more difficult. Add to that the expense of
shipping the horse to its new home and you may
end up breaking your budget, because shipping
responsibilities fall on the buyer.
Horses that are suitable for novices can readily be
found in most areas where horses are common,
so newbies to the horse world really don’t need
to shop long distance. If, however, you decide
to take this route, be sure to:
 Use an independent veterinarian for the pre-
purchase exam; don’t rely on the seller’s vet.
 Hop on a plane or drive to where the horse
is located and spend some time getting to
know the animal before you make a com-
mitment to buy.
 Bring along your expert.
Just because a horse is located far away doesn’t
mean you need to skip the vital steps needed to
make the right horse-buying decision.

Individual sellers
Individual horse owners put horses up for sale for any number of reasons.
Some of the better reasons (for you, the buyer) include:
 A teenage daughter who’s gone off to college and left no one to ride the
horse
 A change in financial situation such that the seller can no longer afford
to keep the horse
 The desire to replace a beginner horse with a seasoned show animal
 A loss of interest in the hobby
If you purchase a horse made available by one of these situations, you can
end up with a wonderful animal at a reasonable price.
Unfortunately, individuals also sell horses for less positive reasons. Some
examples include horses that:
 Are difficult or dangerous to ride
 Won’t load into a trailer
 Are sick or have other medical problems
 Are mean and dislike people
Buying a horse from an individual seller rather than from a trainer, breeder,
or horse dealer can be a good way to save money, but you need to exercise
caution. Individual sellers often advertise in the classified section of your
daily newspaper, in local horse publications, and on the bulletin board at
your area tack and feed store. Your trainer may also know of someone selling
a horse that is a good match for you.
Some of the potential advantages of buying a horse directly from an individ-
ual are:
 Getting a bargain: Under the right circumstances, you can get a really
good horse for a really good price. For example, if the seller is attached
to the horse yet desperate to sell him, she may charge you much less
than the horse is worth if she knows you’re going to provide the animal
with a good home.
 Avoiding the middleman: You’ll probably already be paying a fee to a
trainer or other expert to help you find the right horse (see “Enlisting an
Expert to Help You Shop” earlier in this chapter). However, when you buy
from an individual, you also avoid paying a middleman — that is, a trainer
who is selling a horse on behalf of a client — which ultimately cuts down
on the cost of the horse.
88
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Obtaining a history: Horses that come from individual sellers often come
with a known history. The seller probably can tell you who owned the
horse before, what type of work the horse did, whether a mare produced
any foals, and more. This information is important, because it helps you
get a feeling for what the horse is all about, and if you end up buying the
horse, you’ll know something about your new charge. When you know
absolutely nothing about your horse’s background, any problems that
come up can be frustrating.
Conversely, buying from an individual isn’t always the best way to go. Some of
the potential disadvantages of buying a horse directly from an individual are:
 Time-consuming searches: Calling around and visiting horses for sale
one at a time can take a great deal of time.
 Unappealing personalities: If you deal directly with individuals, you may
find yourself face-to-face with personalities that are less than appealing
to you. You may even run across people who are downright dishonest
and try to pull the wool over your eyes, an uncertainty that can add to
the frustration of horse shopping.
 Burgeoning prices: Although you may find a great bargain when looking
to buy from an individual, you also stand to pay more for a horse from
an individual than you would through a horse dealer, especially if the
individual is in no hurry to sell the horse.
When you’re thinking about buying a horse from an individual, be sure to
bring an experienced horse person with you to see the animal. A person with
experience can ascertain any behavioral problems the horse may have. If the
horse passes muster in terms of its behavior, a veterinarian can determine any
medical problems during a checkup (see “Hiring a vet to check the horse”
later in this chapter).
Horse dealers
You can find horse dealers in most areas that have an active horse industry.
Horse dealers typically purchase horses at auctions or from individuals and
then sell those horses to others at higher prices. In essence, they’re the mid-
dlemen of the horse-buying world.
You can get a good horse from an honest horse dealer. Most horse dealers
are experienced horse people who know how to judge a horse’s disposition,
quality of training, and athletic ability.
If a trainer or horse expert is helping you with your search, ask whether he or
she can recommend a reputable horse dealer. Don’t approach a horse dealer
without a recommendation from someone you know well and trust. Horse
dealers are much like used car dealers: Some are ethical; others aren’t.
89
Chapter 5: Making the Big Buy

Some horse dealers will sell a horse with a guarantee that states you can return
the horse within one year for another one if the horse develops medical or
behavioral problems. The trouble with this type of guarantee is that, most
people understandably become attached to the horse and don’t want to return
him to the dealer for fear the horse will end up going to the slaughterhouse
(see Chapter 12 for more information about horse slaughter).
Breeding and training operations
Horse breeders and trainers routinely sell horses to individual buyers. In fact,
selling horses usually is a large part of their business.
Breeders typically deal in purebred horses and sell young stock. The wean-
lings (horses between 4 and 6 months old) and yearlings (1-year-old horses)
most often available from breeders aren’t suitable for a first-time horse owner
because they’re so young. However, breeders occasionally offer older horses
for sale, possibly a retired show horse or a broodmare that has been trained
for riding.
Trainers are often good sources for older, trained horses — the kind you
need to be looking for (see Chapter 4 for more about age considerations).
The horse that’s for sale may be one with only basic training that the trainer
purchased and then schooled to a higher level. The horse may even belong
to a trainer’s client, and the client has outgrown the horse, so the trainer has
taken on the task of selling the animal. Sometimes, a trainer wants to sell off a
lesson horse to a private owner. When healthy and sound (free from lameness),
former lesson horses can make good mounts for beginning riders, and for that
reason, you need to consider them when you shop.
If you’ve taken lessons from and intend to continue working with a particular
trainer after you have your own horse, consider buying a horse directly from
your trainer. After all, you’ve been working with the trainer, and he or she
knows your skill level and personality and may have a horse for sale that is
perfectly suited to you.
As with anything else that you buy, the seller’s reputation is important —
especially when dealing with breeders and trainers. If you don’t know the
breeder or trainer, ask for referrals and find out what other horse people in
the area know about them. Make sure that the business or individual has a
good reputation before you get involved in any business dealings. You want
to make certain you’re dealing with someone who is honest about the horse
you’re buying and won’t stick you with a lemon.
90
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Adoptions
You don’t necessarily have to purchase a horse to acquire one. You can adopt
a horse for nothing or for a minimal fee through several avenues.
Although we like the idea of horse adoption, we want to caution you that it
isn’t always the best way to go when you’re a first-time horse owner looking
for a horse to ride. Some horses that are available for adoption make great
riding horses for beginners, but others are not suited for inexperienced riders.
If you want to pursue this option, do so with your horse-shopping expert in
tow. Remember to be rational and critical, the same way you would if you
were buying. Don’t take a horse home that isn’t right for you just because
he’s free or because you feel sorry for him. If the relationship doesn’t work
out (and chances are that it won’t), the results can be disastrous not only for
you but also for the horse you’re trying to help.
The following sections take you through different kinds of horse adoptions
that are available.
Rescue groups
Horses are beautiful, noble creatures, but sadly, life sometimes deals them a
bad hand. Neglect, abuse, and death at the slaughterhouse are problems that
plague horses in today’s society.
Many people around the world are sensitive to the suffering of horses, and
have banded together to help remedy the plight of these horses. The result is
a bevy of private rescue and adoption groups that save horses from unfortunate
situations. Many of these groups rehabilitate horses and then place them up
for adoption. Some rescue groups simply give the horse a quiet place to live
out his life.
91
Chapter 5: Making the Big Buy
Exercising caution at horse auctions
Although many people buy horses from public
auctions because they find good bargains, we
don’t recommend this route for first-time horse
owners. At an auction, you won’t have the oppor-
tunity to spend much — if any — time with the
horse you’re considering. In many cases, you
won’t have opportunities to ride the horse or have
a veterinarian examine the horse. Because many
public horse auctions sell horses without any kind
of guarantee, you may be setting yourself up for
a fall whenever you buy a horse this way.

Rescue groups that rehabilitate horses and place them for adoption are the
ones you need to explore when you want to adopt a horse. Some of these
groups take former racehorses (usually Thoroughbreds and Standardbreds —
see Chapter 3 for details on different breeds), retrain them for riding, and then
adopt them out or sell them at reduced fees. Others simply rehabilitate rescued
saddle horses and try to find new homes for them.
Before you consider adopting a horse from a rescue group, research the orga-
nization. Visit its facilities to find out as much as you can about the group’s
work. If the people who run the organization seem responsible, organized,
and professional, then pursue the adoption process in the same way that you
would when buying a horse. And as always, be sure to have an equine trainer
or other horse expert with you when deciding to take on a horse — whether
you’re buying or adopting the horse — and have a vet check the horse’s health.
You can also ask to take the rescue horse on a trial basis, because most respon-
sible rescue groups have an open return policy on any horse they adopt out.
In fact, many rescue groups insist that you take the horse for a trial period
while they retain ownership. Some groups even send out inspectors to spot-
check your property to make sure that you’re properly caring for the horse.
In many cases, the rescue group asks you to sign a contract stating that you
must return the horse to the group if and when you decide you no longer
want the animal. See “Signing up for a trial period” later in this chapter for
details on trial periods.
To get you started in your search, a list of equine rescue groups appears in
the Appendix.
Wild horse adoption
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) regularly rounds up wild horses
living in undeveloped regions of the country and places them in holding pens.
These horses are put up for adoption at BLM facilities in several states; just
about anyone can take one of these horses home for a nominal fee.
Wild horses are beautiful animals with a wonderful, historical past; however,
because these animals have lived their lives with virtually no human contact,
they’re generally not suitable for first-time horse owners. Adult wild horses
need extensive training before you can even handle them. Young foals are
easier to work with, but they’re years away from being ridden and usually too
much for a beginning horse person to handle.
If your dream is to adopt a wild mustang, don’t fret. After you gain consider-
able experience riding and handling horses, you can always pursue that goal.
When that time comes, you need to meet certain government-established 
criteria before you’re allowed to adopt a wild horse. You must
92
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Provide a minimum 400-square-feet (20-feet-by-20-feet) enclosure per horse
 Be at least 18 years of age or older (or have your parents cooperation)
 Prove that you can provide adequate feed, water, facilities, and humane
care for the horse
The government has specific rules about the types of facilities in which these
horses can be kept and charges an adoption fee of less than $200 per horse.
(See Chapter 3 for more information about wild horses, and the Appendix for
BLM contact information.)
Free horses
Once in a while, people find themselves in a situation in which someone wants
to give them a free horse. Horse giveaways occur for a few common reasons:
 An owner doesn’t want the hassle of selling the horse.
 An owner is primarily interested in the horse going to a good home.
 A horse is such a big pain in the neck that no one will buy him.
Unfortunately, the last reason is most common when it comes to free horses.
Any beginning rider who takes on a horse that is so difficult or so unsound
that no one will buy him is looking for serious trouble.
Just because a horse is free doesn’t mean that he doesn’t need to fit all the
same qualifications as a horse that you’d buy. If someone offers you a free
horse, and you want to consider him, jump through all the hoops you would
if you were buying: Bring a trainer/expert with you to help evaluate the horse,
have a veterinarian examine the horse, and take the horse out on trial basis.
You may be wondering why you need to go to all this trouble when the
horse is free. It seems as though you have nothing to lose because you aren’t
paying anything for him, right? No, wrong! After you take possession, all of
the horse’s problems become your problems. And if you’re like most people,
you’ll become emotionally attached to the animal and suddenly face some
difficult decisions if the horse turns out to have serious behavioral or med-
ical problems.
If you’re hoping to save a few bucks by taking any old free horse that some-
one offers, you are being penny-wise and pound-foolish, as the saying goes.
Don’t forget that the initial cost of purchase is not what creates the greatest
expense in horse ownership; the training, housing, and veterinary bills make
up the larger part of those costs. If you end up with a problem horse, those
prices you pay become even greater.

Deciding On the Perfect Horse for You
If your horse-owning experience is to be a successful one, you must find the
right horse for you. We can’t stress this point enough. If you get the wrong
horse, you’ll be miserable, the horse will be unhappy, and your venture into
horse ownership will be disastrous. That’s why heeding the advice that we
give you in the following sections is so important.
In Chapter 4, you thought about the age, conformation, and gender of the
horse you’re purchasing. Now, it’s time to get even deeper into the process.
Considering your riding style
You can’t know what kind of horse to buy until you know how you want to
ride. If you haven’t already looked at Chapter 14, you need to do so before
making any buying decisions.
Perhaps western riding is the discipline that appeals to you the most, or maybe
you like the idea of riding hunt seat. Maybe you want a horse with which you
can do both, or maybe you want a horse that you can ride English, and your
spouse and the kids can ride western.
Regardless of what discipline you choose, make sure that the horse you buy
has been trained in that discipline. The only exception is when you want to
have the horse trained in a new discipline after you buy him. However, don’t
make this judgment call on your own. Ask your trainer/expert to evaluate
whether the horse is suited to and can be trained in your chosen discipline.
You can’t ride every horse in every discipline, nor should you try. Specializa-
tion in the horse world dictates that you ride some horses western, some hunt
seat, and some saddle seat. Some horses are versatile and can do two or more
disciplines, but they still need to be trained in each one. If your only plan is
to tool around the trail, then it probably doesn’t matter too much whether
you put a western saddle on a big, rangy Thoroughbred — if you don’t care
how odd it may look. But if you plan to show your horse at all, having the
right horse for your discipline of choice is a big issue.
Choosing a purebred or a nonpurebred
Whether to buy a purebred horse or a grade horse (a horse of unknown parent-
age) depends on several factors. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.
Personal taste also comes into play. Some people couldn’t care less about
their horse’s genetic background, but others are fanatical about it. Read on
to discover which camp you are in.

Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Purebreds
In our opinion, purebred horses are really wonderful. Each and every breed
has a fascinating and unique history, and every horse of that breed is a living,
breathing relic of that amazing past (see Chapter 3 for a rundown of some of
the more well-known horse breeds).
Purebred horses have been bred over time to fit into certain niches, each
breed with its own specialties. Quarter Horses, for instance, are renowned for
their abilities in western sports, just as Paso Finos are famous the world over
for their paso gait. Clydesdales are known for their massive size and strength,
while Shetland Ponies have found acclaim as durable and reliable children’s
mounts.
If you’re planning to show your horse, and a particular breed dominates the
sport you choose, then you need to seriously consider buying a purebred horse.
If you want to show in open western pleasure shows at your local stable, for
example, you’d do best purchasing a Quarter Horse or Paint. These are the
breeds you see winning in these events most often.
Owning a purebred also provides you with an opportunity to show in breed-
specific events, too. Nearly every breed has regional shows where owners
can present their animals in a variety of classes.
Getting involved in breed showing is a good way to meet other horse people,
too. By making contact with your local breed club, you have a whole slew of
opportunities to meet horse owners with the same goals and interests.
For some people, owning a purebred horse is a status thing. Purebred horses
typically cost more than nonpurebreds, have a pedigree behind them, and
are recognizable to most horse people as purebreds. If you care about that
kind of stuff, then you’ll probably want to own a purebred horse.
For other people, purebreds simply are more beautiful and more interesting
than nonpurebreds. These individuals are willing to spend more money on a
purebred horse just so they can have a magnificent horse in their stable. In
fact, coauthor Janice M. Posnikoff, DVM, owns a purebred Miniature Horse
and enjoys the prestige that ownership brings her.
The one distinct disadvantage to purebred horses is their tendency toward
inherited diseases or weakness. Some Quarter Horses carry a gene for hyper-
kalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), a severe muscle disorder; Appaloosas are
inclined toward uveitis, a serious eye condition; Arabians have a tendency to
develop enteroliths, or stones in the intestines; Thoroughbreds are known for
having poor hooves, and the list goes on.
You can screen horses for HYPP, but not for most other breed-associated dis-
eases. Buying a purebred comes with the risk that your horse can develop
one of the conditions associated with his breed.
95
Chapter 5: Making the Big Buy

Nonpurebreds
A nonpurebred can be a horse that is the result of the crossing of two breeds
(called a crossbreed), or a horse whose parentage is simply unknown (called a
grade horse). Many breed crosses have names for the cross and associations
that register them. The Morab, which is a breeding between a Morgan and
an Arabian, is one. The Anglo-Arab, a cross between a Thoroughbred and an
Arabian, is another.
Cross-bred horses usually are the result of a deliberate breeding between
horses of differing breeds, orchestrated by people who are looking to com-
bine the qualities found in each breed.
Grade horses, on the other hand, are the mutts of the horse world. In most
cases, little thought goes into their breeding. They’re simply the product of a
stallion and a mare, put together for the purpose of creating a generic horse.
Some grade horses may actually be purebreds, but because of circumstances,
their registration papers and pedigrees are lost somewhere along the way.
The reality of the horse world is that nonpurebreds are more plentiful than
purebreds, which is just fine. Nonpurebreds can make wonderful mounts and
excellent companions, the same way purebreds can. The horse world differs
from the dog world in that sense: Pedigree just isn’t that important to the
average horse person. For them, good behavior and a sound body have much
more value than pure breeding.
Several differences exist between purebreds and nonpurebreds, however.
For one thing, nonpurebreds typically are less expensive than purebreds and
they’re easier to come by. If you open your equine search to nonpurebreds,
you have many more horses to choose from. You’re also less at risk of pur-
chasing a horse with an inherited disease if you get a grade horse, which
comes from a larger gene pool.
The disadvantages to owning a nonpurebred primarily are show related. In
many show rings, you compete against purebreds that are carefully bred to
perform in the discipline in which you’re showing. Your nonpurebred may be at
a disadvantage. Some of the more performance-oriented sports like endurance
riding and show jumping are exceptions, because more emphasis is placed
on athletic ability than form and general appearance. You commonly see
crossbreeds and even grade horses in such events.
If all you want in your first horse is an equine friend to take you out on the
trail and spend time with you around the barn, then a nonpurebred is more
than qualified for the job. Coauthor Audrey Pavia’s first horse, a little bay
96
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

mare named Peggy, was a nonpurebred and an excellent child’s mount and
companion. No one knew a thing about Peggy’s ancestry, but it didn’t matter.
She was simply a wonderful horse.
Balancing emotions and rationality
Successful horse selection requires you to compartmentalize your brain. On the
one hand, you want a horse that is emotionally appealing, but on the other
hand, you need a horse that also makes sense for you from an unemotional
standpoint. You find a particular horse attractive, friendly, and interested in
you, and you can hardly wait to ride such a beautiful creature. These are mat-
ters of the heart, so they’re important factors to consider in your decision.
But you can’t base your decision entirely on how you feel about the horse.
You need to balance your heart’s reaction with your rational side. Is the horse
well-trained and suitable for a beginning rider? Is the horse suitable for children
to ride (if your kids are going to ride him)? Is the horse easy to handle from
the ground and from the saddle? Is the animal free of any health problems?
Truly liking the horse you’re going to buy is important and so is having a
good feeling about the animal, but the practical answers to these and other
questions must take precedence over things like how good you think you
look riding the horse.
The decision to buy a particular horse needs to be a combination of intellectual
and emotional thinking. Your intellect needs to stoically compute the practical
information about any horse you’re considering, while your emotional side
needs to provide you with that all-important gut feeling that’s so necessary
when trying to decide such important matters. Using a good measure of intel-
lect and a good measure of emotion is key to establishing a balance between
the two debating sides of this decision.
Embarking on Your Horse-Shopping
Journey
Okay, you’re ready to roll up your sleeves and start really looking for that
horse. This part of the process can be both fun and scary. But if you take our
advice and have someone with you who is experienced in horse shopping
and knows her way around a barn, the process is much less stressful.
97
Chapter 5: Making the Big Buy

Getting some initial information
Before you go look at a horse that is for sale, you need to get some basic
information questions (if the advertisement doesn’t already give you the
answers):
 How much are you asking for the horse? Is this price negotiable?
 How old is the horse?
 How big is the horse (in hands)?
 What is the horse’s gender?
 In which discipline is the horse ridden?
 Has the horse ever had professional training?
 Is the horse suitable for a beginning rider?
 Is the horse suitable for children (if you have kids who will ride the
horse)?
 Does the horse load into a trailer?
 Does the horse have any bad habits such as cribbing, weaving, or pulling
back when tied? (See Chapter 2 for information on these vices.)
 Does the horse have any medical problems or a history of medical prob-
lems like colic, lameness, or allergies?
 Why are you selling the horse?
The answers to these questions help you determine whether the horse meets
your basic requirements of price range, age, gender, size, discipline, disposi-
tion, and health. If you sense a problem or incompatibility at this stage of the
game, don’t waste your time going to see the animal. Say “No, thanks,” and go
on to the next prospect. If the horse sounds great, set up a mutually accept-
able time for you to see the horse, but make sure that your trainer/expert is
available at that time, too.
Paying a visit
Bringing your trainer or equine expert with you the first time you see a horse
is important. You need that person’s opinion about the horse immediately.
If your trainer/expert gives the horse a thumbs up, then you can pursue a pre-
purchase veterinary exam and possible trial period (we cover both processes
in the sections on “Hiring a vet to check the horse” and “Signing up for a trial
period” later in this chapter). If your trainer/expert gives the horse a thumbs
down, then you shouldn’t waste any more of your or the seller’s time.
98
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

In most cases, you ride the horse on that first visit, so be sure to wear your
riding clothes when you go — and don’t forget your helmet!
Start the evaluation process when you drive out to see the horse. Your trainer/
expert can guide you through this process.
Follow these steps as you evaluate any horse:
1. Take in the entire horse. Take a long, hard look at the horse. The horse
should be wearing only a halter so you can see his conformation, or the
way he’s put together. Your trainer/expert helps you evaluate the horse’s
conformation visually and with a hands-on exam, where you feel the
horse’s legs and pick up his feet to look at the underside of his hooves
(see Chapter 4 to find out more about recognizing good and bad confor-
mation). The two of you are looking for overall balance, blemishes, and
conformation pluses and minuses in the horse. If the horse already has
been tacked up (saddled) in anticipation of your arrival, ask to see the
horse without tack after you ride him.
2. Watch the horse move. Ask the seller to walk and trot the horse away
from and toward you on a loose lead. The seller also needs to walk and
trot the horse so that you can view him from the side and have the horse
longe (move in a circle with a long rope attached at the halter or bridle;
see Chapter 13 for more information on longeing) on hard and soft ground.
Your trainer/expert watches the horse’s movement to judge whether the
horse is sound.
3. Watch the horse as someone else rides him. Ask the seller to ride (or have
someone else ride) the horse so you and your trainer/expert can watch
the horse work under saddle. The rider needs to ask the horse to walk,
trot, and canter. If you’re buying a horse that is intended for jumping,
ask the rider to take the horse over a few jumps; if the horse is for barrel
racing, ask the rider to negotiate a few barrels, and so on. Observe the
horse during this time to get a sense of what he’s like when someone is
riding him.
4. Have your trainer/expert ride the horse. This crucial step allows your
trainer/expert to get a real feel for the horse’s disposition under saddle
and his suitability as a beginner’s horse.
5. Ride the horse yourself. If your trainer/expert likes the horse, he or she
will suggest that you ride him. Work the horse in a walk, trot, and canter.
Pay attention to the way the horse feels as you ride, and ask yourself
whether you’re comfortable on the horse and whether you like the way
horse responds to you.
During this part of the process, you can rely heavily on gut feeling. Tune
into yourself and see whether the horse feels right. If the horse is meant
for your child to ride, have your child get up on the horse, too, assuming
you and your trainer/expert consider the animal safe.
99
Chapter 5: Making the Big Buy

6. Observe the horse. If you and your trainer/expert like the horse, ask
the seller whether you can spend some time handling the horse from
the ground and observing him in his stall or pasture. Lead him around,
groom him, and pick up his feet. Get a sense of what the horse’s person-
ality is like.
The horse needs to exhibit gentle, easygoing behavior. If he’s difficult to
handle or tries to bite or kick, this horse isn’t for you.
When in a stall or pasture, notice whether the horse has any stable vices
like cribbing or weaving (see Chapter 2 for more information).
7. Find out whether the horse loads into a trailer. Ask the seller whether
the horse willingly loads into a trailer. If the answer is yes, ask for a demon-
stration. Any horse that won’t load into a trailer is not a good choice as
a purchase. Even if you don’t plan to trailer the horse on a regular basis,
you may someday need to take him to the hospital or transport him from
one area to another. In these and other situations, horses that won’t load
cause enormous problems for their owners.
Just because you have a trainer/expert with you when you evaluate a horse
for purchase doesn’t mean that you sit back and let your expert do all the
work! Take this opportunity to learn about horses and how to look at them.
Be involved, and after the evaluation, when the two of you are alone, ask plenty
of questions.
Moving forward after the visit
After you evaluate the horse, thank the seller and tell him or her that you’re
interested in the horse but need some time to think about what you just saw
and experienced. After you leave the premises, discuss the horse with your
trainer/expert. If the two of you agree that the horse is a good match for you,
pay another visit to the horse and ride him again (you may have to do so as
early as the next day if other people also are interested in buying the horse.)
If you still like the horse, contact a veterinarian and arrange for a prepurchase
exam (see the following section).
Whatever you do, don’t purchase a horse without completing the entire eval-
uation process outlined here. You may be tempted to do so simply because
you’re afraid someone else may buy the horse first. Resist that temptation,
because you’re better off letting the horse go than you are buying him with-
out knowing what you’re getting. You’ll soon find another horse that you like
just as much.
100
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

If you and your trainer/expert feel positive about the horse, you may want to
give the seller a small deposit (usually around 10 percent of the purchase price)
to hold the animal while you make your final evaluation. If you decide not to
buy the horse, and the seller turns down another offer while you’re still in the
evaluation process, be prepared to lose your deposit. Some sellers keep the
deposit even if they receive no other offers on the horse. Stipulate the terms
of your deposit up front and in writing.
Hiring a vet to check the horse
After you find a horse that you and your trainer/expert agree upon, you need
to call in a veterinarian. Most equine veterinarians offer a service known as a
prepurchase exam, or a vet check in casual terms. If you hire a vet to perform
such an exam, the doctor comes out to where the horse resides and thoroughly
examines the animal.
If you’re working with a reputable trainer to find a horse, your veterinarian
may recommend that you take the horse you’re considering to a training
facility and keep him there for a one-week trial period before conducting the
prepurchase exam. Doing so gives you a chance to spend time with the horse
and ensures that the horse is drug-free before the exam. (Make sure the horse
is up-to-date on shots, deworming, and shoeing before you take him, and dis-
cuss a contract with the seller to protect both of you during the trial period.)
Note: Trainers and breeders usually extend this courtesy to other trainers
and breeders, but not usually to individuals looking to a buy a horse on their
own — another good reason to have a trainer help you with your purchase.
Make sure that you select an independent veterinarian to perform the prepur-
chase exam — not one that the seller suggests or considers the seller a client.
(We give you great tips on finding the right vet in Chapter 4.) If you’re unable
to locate an independent veterinarian on your own, contact the American
Association of Equine Practitioners for a referral (see the Appendix for this
organization’s address and telephone number).
Some aspects of the prepurchase exam are included in the basic price, but
other services cost you extra. The more tests you can have the vet perform,
the more you’ll learn about your prospective horse and the more you’ll pay
for the exam.
The results of the examination give you a good idea about any health problems
the horse may have. Keep in mind, however, that the prepurchase exam is not
foolproof. A disease or condition can evade discovery during a vet check.
101
Chapter 5: Making the Big Buy

The following are just a few of the things the vet examines:
 Vital signs: The vet checks the horse for normal temperature, respira-
tion, and pulse while at rest. After some light exercise, the vet checks
these vital signs again. Abnormal readings sometimes are a way to
detect illness.
 Heart and lungs: The vet listens to the horse’s heart and lungs with a
stethoscope to determine whether any problems are present.
 Gut sounds: Using a stethoscope, the vet listens to the sounds coming
from the horse’s gastrointestinal system. Normal gut sounds indicate a
healthy digestive system.
 Teeth: The vet examines the horse’s mouth for problems with missing
teeth, overgrown molars, poor alignment, and wear from the habit of
cribbing (see Chapter 2 for information on cribbing).
 Eyes: Using a light source, the vet checks the health of the horse’s eyes,
looking for corneal scarring, cataracts, inflammation, and other signs of
disease.
 Lameness: The veterinarian evaluates the horse’s conformation for any
faults that may affect the animal’s ability to perform in the job you
intend for him (see Chapter 2 for more information on conformation).
The horse then undergoes something called a flexion test, where he is
gaited in front of the veterinarian on hard and soft ground and in circles
so the doctor can determine any problems in movement. During the
lameness part of the examination, the vet also palpates the lower limbs
in search of abnormalities and examines the hooves visually and with a
device called a hoof tester.
 Blood: At your request, the vet will draw blood from the horse and have
it tested for equine infectious anemia (EIA), thyroid function, and other
possible problems.
 X-ray: At your request, the veterinarian may take X-rays to further evalu-
ate the horse’s soundness and health.
You also need to ask your veterinarian to do a blood or urine test for drug
detection. We’ve heard stories of sellers tranquilizing or otherwise drugging
horses before selling them, leaving the unfortunate buyers to discover the
truth after the drug wears off and the horse’s true personality comes out.
A veterinarian conducting a prepurchase exam needs to ask the seller about
the horse’s medical history and current use. The vet also asks you about what
you intend to do with the horse if you buy him. The reason for these questions
is so the veterinarian can determine whether the horse is physically capable
of performing the job you want him to do.
102
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

The veterinarian doesn’t give the horse a pass or fail on the exam: He or she
simply alerts you to the horse’s condition at the time of the exam. The vet may
tell you whether the horse seems suitable for certain disciplines or sports
depending on the correctness of his conformation, although most veterinari-
ans aren’t willing to give an opinion on this subject for liability reasons. If the
horse is suffering from a serious illness, the vet indicates the abnormal finding
on the horse’s report.
You can discuss the results of the prepurchase exam with your trainer/expert
to get his or her input, but the decision whether to purchase the animal ulti-
mately is yours.
If the horse’s health is acceptable based on the prepurchase exam, ask your
trainer/expert for advice on how to proceed. We strongly recommend taking
the horse for a trial period (see the following section); however, if doing so is
not possible, your trainer/expert may recommend that you contact the seller
to discuss another visit or the possible purchase of the horse.
Signing up for a trial period
If a horse you’re interested in has passed muster with your trainer/expert
and turned up healthy in the prepurchase exam, you can move forward to
the trial period. Most sellers will allow you to take the horse for a trial period.
We recommend negotiating for a 30-day trial period, which gives you the
greatest amount of time to get to know the horse. A week or two is better
than nothing, if that’s all the time the seller will allow.
When negotiating for the trial period, put all the terms of the trial in writing
and make sure both parties sign the agreement. As the potential buyer, you
customarily pay for the horse’s board and feed during the time he’s in your
care and possession; the seller usually pays any medical costs that come up.
If the seller doesn’t agree to a trial period, suggest a lease agreement instead.
You can opt to lease the horse for several months at an agreed fee with the
goal of getting to know the animal. At the end of your lease, you can purchase
the horse or return him to the seller (see Chapter 4 for more about leasing a
horse). The seller may agree to this arrangement because it generates monthly
income — with a good chance that you’ll buy the animal as a result of the
lease.
Before you take a horse for a trial period, make sure that seller has insured
the horse to cover any accidents or death that may result while the horse is
in your possession. If the horse isn’t insured, take out a temporary policy on
the animal yourself (the cost is $100, or so) and make sure that you stipulate
103
Chapter 5: Making the Big Buy

the terms of your liability in writing (like who is responsible for the horse’s
medical care during the trial and who is liable if the horse suddenly dies —
whatever your insurance stipulates). Before you agree to be personally
responsible for medical care when the horse is in your possession, be aware
that equine medical bills can be high. In most cases, the seller is willing to
assume this responsibility.
If a trial period or lease is out of the question (some sellers don’t feel com-
fortable allowing the horse off their property), try spending as much time
with the horse as you possibly can before you decide to buy him. Ask the
seller whether you can come and see the horse more than once, and when
you’re with the animal, tie him, lead, and groom him, and by all means ride
him to get a sense of what the horse is really like.
During your trial period or lease, spend plenty of time with the horse so the
two of you get acquainted. Perform the same tasks with the horse that you
plan to do after you buy him — or at least as much as you can. If you want to
trail ride, take the trial horse out on the trail. If you plan to jump, do some
jumping with the horse. If your children or spouse are going to be involved
with the horse after you buy him, have them spend time with the horse now
so they can see how they feel about him. In addition, the horse’s ground man-
ners are extremely important yet often overlooked when people are evaluating
a horse for purchase. Use this time to see what kind of ground manners the
horse has by spending time tying the horse, grooming him, and leading him
around the barn.
The point of all this evaluation is to make sure that you and your family are truly
compatible with the horse. If the horse hates being on the trail, constantly
refuses jumps, or is so ill-mannered that he drags you around when you lead
him, you’re better off finding out now as opposed to after you actually buy him.
Closing the deal
You’ve consulted with your trainer/expert, spoken to your veterinarian, asked
yourself some important questions, and made a decision that you want to buy
a particular horse. Now comes the business part of the deal.
Julie I. Fershtman, an attorney practicing equine law in Bingham Farms,
Michigan, and author of the book Equine Law & Horse Sense (Horses & the
Law Publishing, Franklin, Michigan) recommends that you draft a contract
and present it to the seller to sign before the purchase. Such a contract
needs to spell out all the terms of the sale for you and for the seller and 
significantly reduces the likelihood of any misunderstandings later on.
104
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Fershtman suggests that the contract contain the following information:
 Names and pertinent information: Include the names of the buyer and
seller, along with their respective addresses and telephone numbers.
 Legal rights: Ask for a guarantee that the seller is indeed the horse’s
legal owner and has the right to sell the animal.
 Description: Include a description of the horse, including size, color,
breed, and registration number, if any.
 The price that you and the seller agree upon: Indicate whether the
seller has received full payment or whether you’re paying the price in
installments. Be sure to indicate how much all installments are and the
dates when they’re due. Also list where you are to send the installments
and whether you are to will pay by check or money order. Include infor-
mation on the recourses for you and the seller have if you are unable to
make the payments.
 The date the horse becomes yours: If registration papers and pedigrees
are involved, give the dates by which you can expect to receive each of
these records.
 The terms of the warranty on the horse, if any: If you want the seller
to guarantee the horse in any way, you must spell it out on the contract.
The seller must agree to the warranty, of course. You can include express
conditions, such as “does not rear,” “is free of any lameness,” or what-
ever you determine is most important to you, and whatever the seller
will agree upon.
 Signatures of both parties.
If you want even greater protection than this brief contract can afford, con-
sult an attorney who’s experienced in equine law and ask him or her to draw
up a detailed contract.
Bringing Your Horse Home
Okay, you’ve bought yourself a horse. Do you now just hop on his back and
ride away?
No! You need to get the horse home first. The seller may be willing to deliver
the horse to your stable. If not, you can hire someone with a trailer to pick up
your horse up and bring him to his new home.
105
Chapter 5: Making the Big Buy

If you’ve never hitched up a trailer, loaded a horse, or driven a horse trailer
before, we don’t suggest that you rent a trailer and do the job yourself —
unless you have an expert on hand to help you with these tasks. Your horse
must have a good experience (as opposed to a traumatic one) traveling to his
new home. Right now, concentrate on getting your horse to wherever you plan
to keep him. You can always work on your trailering skills later.
When your horse arrives at a new home, make him feel welcome by following
these steps:
 Feed your horse: If plan to keep your horse in a stall or paddock, have
food waiting for him and make sure that you give him the same food
he’s been eating at his previous home so he doesn’t develop colic.
(See Chapter 8 for information on what to feed your horse.)
 Change food sources gradually: If you’re going to keep your horse in
a pasture where grass is his primary food source, make sure that you
gradually introduce him to the grass over a period of at least two weeks.
By gradually, we mean keep him in a stall or paddock and feed him what
his previous owner fed him, while letting him graze for only an hour the
first couple of days, two hours the next couple of days, three hours the
next two days, and so on, until his system acclimates to his new diet.
 Water your horse: Have clean, fresh water available in his enclosure.
 Stay with your horse for a while: Horses often are nervous and uncer-
tain when they move from familiar surroundings to a strange new place.
Your company helps soothe his worries and allows you to keep an eye
on him as he takes in his new environment.
 Give your horse some adjustment time: Don’t ride him right away, and
don’t take him to a horse show two days after he’s been in your posses-
sion! From the horse’s perspective, he’s just lost all that is familiar to him:
his home, his routine, and most likely the person with whom he bonded.
He needs time to adjust to his new life, and the two of you need time get
to know one another.
 Give your horse attention: Spend time grooming him, talking to him, and
just hanging out with him. Deliver his food yourself, and stand by him as
he eats. Let him graze on some grass outside his stall while you hold his
lead rope. All these things help foster a bond between the two of you.

Either way, if you’re going to be a part of the horse world, you must have a
handle on all this stuff. We don’t want you to share the fate of coauthor Audrey
Pavia’s nonhorsy husband, who after walking through a tack store in a foiled
attempt to buy his wife a gift, exclaimed, “Everything just looks like belts!”
All that leather has a purpose. And we explain it all to you in this chapter.
Let the Shopping Begin: Figuring Out
Where to Buy Equine Equipment
If you’re new to horses, you probably aren’t sure where to buy the equine
equipment and riding apparel you need. Here’s a list of the places we recom-
mend for buying tack and other horse supplies.
 Tack and feed stores: Most communities that have horses also have at
least one tack and feed store. These places not only sell food for horses,
but equipment, too. If you have more than one tack and feed store in
your area, be sure to comparison shop. Sometimes pricing differences
are huge from one store to the next in the same area. Likewise, keep an

eye out for used equipment in these places. Many tack and feed stores
sell used saddles and other items on consignment.
 Mail-order catalogs: The horse world has a number of quality mail-
order companies that deal exclusively in equine equipment. You can buy
everything from saddles to show apparel from these catalogs, often at
big discounts from retail prices. The downside of buying from a catalog
is that you can’t try on the clothes or sit in the saddle before you make a
purchase. These drawbacks shouldn’t stop you from buying a catalog,
however, because all good catalogs have a return policy enabling cus-
tomers to send back whatever doesn’t fit (see the Appendix for a list of
equine mail-order catalogs).
 The Internet: A whole slew of equine retailers have popped up on the
Internet, and many of them have mail-order catalogs. You can get great
deals shopping for horse equipment on the Internet, either through
Internet stores or on auction sites. Make sure any items you purchase
while cybershopping are backed up by a return policy.
 Consignment shops: Less common than regular tack and feed stores,
equine consignment shops deal almost exclusively in used tack. They
are great places to shop if you have a limited budget (and who doesn’t
unless you’re Donald Trump), and the reputable ones have return poli-
cies on saddles and other items that require a good fit. Keep these
shops in mind when you’re ready to upgrade and sell off your old
tack, too.
 Other horse owners: Buying your equine equipment from another
horse owner — is a good way to get a good deal on tack. People who
are getting out of horses, or simply have too much stuff (horse equip-
ment is easy to accumulate, as you may soon find out) often are
anxious to get rid of their horsy things and willing to sell the items at
low prices. You can find these people by checking out bulletin boards
at riding stables and the classified section of your daily newspaper
under “horse.”
If you buy a saddle from a private seller, take the saddle on a trial basis
so you can make sure that it fits you and your horse. If the seller is a
total stranger and doesn’t like the idea of you taking the saddle off site,
ask the seller to be present when you try the saddle on the horse. If the
seller won’t cooperate and expects you to buy the saddle outright with-
out trying it on your horse, politely refuse to buy it.

Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Okay, that’s not the original saying, but we’re cat lovers and prefer it this way.
Anyway, the modified statement is true: Riders have options in the particular
style they choose.
Each riding discipline not only has its own associated style of riding, but also
its own equipment. To function properly in the horse world — and to eventu-
ally shop intelligently for your own stuff — you need to know the differences.
In the following sections, we get you started with the most important piece of
equipment: saddles.
Surveying different types of saddles
Most people know that a saddle is a big piece of wood or fiberglass covered
with leather that goes on a horse’s back. But there’s more to it than that.
Saddles come in different styles. The one you buy depends on the type of
riding you plan to do. Pay close attention here; the saddle represents one of
your biggest investment in your new hobby.
Knowing the parts of the saddle that are common to all disciplines helps
when you’re shopping for a saddle. They include:
 Pommel: The front rise of the saddle
 Cantle: The rear rise of the saddle
 Seat: The center of the saddle where the rider sits
Hunt-seat saddle
The hunt-seat saddle (a type of English saddle) originally was designed for
fox hunters, those members of the British aristocracy who found pleasure in
chasing foxes through the countryside, leaping over fences, logs, and other
obstacles in the process.
If you plan to ride your horse in the hunt-seat discipline — eventually learn-
ing to jump — you need this saddle, because it’s designed to make going
over jumps comfortable and secure for the rider. A saddletree, the wooden
or fiberglass frame on which the saddle is constructed, determines the fit of
the saddle on the horse’s back.
A hunt-seat saddle and its parts are shown in Figure 6-1. These same parts
also apply to other English saddles.
Dressage saddle
The dressage saddle is a type of English saddle that is specifically designed
for use in the discipline of dressage. It differs from a hunt-seat saddle in that
the cantle and pommel are a bit higher, the seat is deeper, and the stirrup
irons are longer. Dressage saddles are constructed to put the rider in more of
109
Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

an upright position than you see in a hunt-seat saddle. The rider sits deep in
the saddle with her legs underneath her body, providing more contact with
the horse.
If you want to learn to ride in the dressage discipline, you need a dressage
saddle. You can learn dressage in an all-purpose hunt-seat saddle, but this diffi-
cult discipline is made easier by using a saddle that’s specifically designed for it.
A drawing of a dressage saddle appears in Figure 6-2. The parts of the dressage
saddle are identical to the parts of a hunt-seat saddle. The only differences
are the nuances of the design of those parts (refer to Figure 6-1 for the parts
of the hunt-seat saddle).
Show saddle
The show saddle is primarily used in American saddle-seat riding to show off
flashy, high-stepping horses. Show saddles are designed to keep the rider’s
weight off the horse’s front end, so the animal can produce a lot of action in
his forelegs. Consequently, the rider sits farther back on the horse with his or
her legs farther out in front than with a hunt-seat or dressage saddle.
If you ride a gaited horse, such as an American Saddlebred, Tennessee Walking
Horse, or Racking Horse, and if you plan to show in gaited classes, you need a
show saddle. You can also ride on the trail with a show saddle, although this
activity is not the show saddle’s primary purpose.

English saddles, see Figure 6-3. The parts of the show saddle are the same as
those of a hunt-seat and dressage saddles, except that the show saddle doesn’t
have a knee roll (refer to Figure 6-1 for the hunt-seat saddle). The knee roll is
the section at the front of the flap that supports the rider’s knee.

Western saddle
The western saddle was created out of sheer necessity in the old American
West. This quintessential working saddle hasn’t changed very much in design
during the past 100 years.
If you plan to compete in western events with your horse, or if you’re simply
attracted to western riding and want to participate in this discipline strictly
for enjoyment, a western saddle is what you need.
The western saddle is designed to give you a secure, comfortable ride. The
deep seat, high pommel, and high cantle help keep the rider in the western
saddle when the horse makes sudden maneuvers, making it the saddle of
choice for calf roping, reining, cutting, and other western working sports.
The long stirrups are meant for greater comfort during long hours in the
saddle (see Figure 6-4 for parts of the western saddle).

Endurance saddle
If you plan to spend long hours on the trail, consider an endurance saddle. A
cross between an English saddle and a western saddle, endurance saddles
combine the best of both worlds. They are light and easy to lift like an English
saddle, and thus give the horse less weight to carry around. The seat is deep
and comfortable like a western saddle, and some have high pommels and
saddle horns for extra security. These saddles also have more D-rings to secure
the kinds of items you need on a long trail ride, such as a water bottle, saddle
pack, and first-aid kit.
Endurance saddles come in a variety of designs for a variety of tastes. Figure 6-5

Picking out saddle pads
Saddle pads protect the horse’s back from rubbing and chafing, and they pro-
tect the saddle from sweat. Regardless of whether you’re riding English or
western, you need to buy a good saddle pad or two to place underneath your
saddle when you ride. Two popular types are
 English pads: The type of pad you need depends on the style of English
riding you plan to do. Hunt-seat riders typically use white synthetic
fleece pads underneath their saddles. Dressage riders usually use white
square-quilted cotton pads called dressage pads, and saddle-seat riders
typically use either no pad at all or a thin cotton pad.
 Western pads: For a western saddle, you need a western pad. Most west-
ern pads are made from inch-thick (or thicker) synthetic fleece or felt.
Many of these pads come in decorative designs. You can also get just a
plain white-foam western pad and put a thin Navajo-style blanket on top
of it.
Whatever type of pad you use, keep it clean by washing it regularly, either in
a washing machine or by hand (don’t put it in the dryer unless you want it to
shrink). If not kept clean, a dirty pad not only starts to smell bad, but it also
is likely to irritate your horse’s back.
Buying a saddle the smart way
A saddle is a big-ticket item — at least as far as horse equipment goes. That’s
why you need to do some homework before you buy. Here’s our advice on
buying a saddle:
 Be certain that you’re comfortable with the discipline you choose before
you invest in a saddle. Take some lessons in that type of saddle first to
be sure that you like how it feels.
 Take an experienced horse person with you when you go saddle shop-
ping. You need that person’s expertise to help you make a good decision.
(See Chapter 4 for tips on finding a horse expert.)
 Buy your saddle only after you buy or lease your horse, because the
saddle needs to fit the horse you’re riding. (Chapter 5 has info on the
horse-buying process.)
 Buy the best saddle you can afford, because you’re making a long-term
investment. Spending money on a quality saddle now pays off later.
 Research the brand names of saddles made for your discipline. Contact
the manufacturers and ask them about the features of their products.
Survey other riders in your discipline to see which brands they prefer.
114
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Purchase a saddle with a return policy. You need time to try the saddle
on your horse before you commit to keeping it (see the following section
for more information on fitting a saddle). This practice goes for used
saddles and new ones.
 Have a trainer or independent saddlemaker inspect the saddletree during
your trial period whenever you’re buying a used saddle to make sure the
frame is not broken.
 Make sure the saddle fits your rear end. The seats of saddles come in 
different sizes, measured in inches (a woman of average size and weight
typically fits in a 15- to 16-inch seat on a Western saddle, and a 17-inch
seat on an English model). Try sitting in the saddle before you take it
home (see the next section for more information).
 Consider having a saddle custom-made whenever you can’t find a saddle
that fits both you and your horse. Although you’ll spend more than if you
buy a saddle off the rack, it’s worth the money. Contact a local tack store
for a referral to a saddlemaker in your area.
English saddles do not include the stirrup leathers, stirrup irons, and girths.
You need to purchase these items separately. The purchase of a western saddle
always includes stirrups and usually includes cinches; however, you may want
to upgrade to a better cinch if the one that comes with your saddle is cheap.
Ensuring your saddle fits
Saddle shopping is more than just finding a nice-looking saddle in your price
range. You have to make sure that the saddle fits you and your horse before
you commit to buying it.
Fitting the horse
As far as the horse is concerned, a saddle that doesn’t fit correctly can result
in sore back muscles, and a corresponding bad attitude to go with it.
Finding a saddle that fits your horse takes some work. Even though saddle
manufacturers make saddletrees in different sizes (wide, medium, and narrow),
each horse is an individual and may not fit into a saddle that corresponds to
the apparent width of the horse’s back.
For that reason, when you buy a saddle, take it on a trial basis so you can be
sure that it fits. During that trial period, follow the steps outlined in the sec-
tions that follow to determine the saddle’s fit and enlist an experienced horse
person to help you determine the fit of the saddle. Saddle fitting can be tricky,
even for the most experienced riders.
115
Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

English saddles
To determine whether an English saddle fits your horse, follow these steps:
1. Put the saddle on the horse without using a saddle pad. Tighten the
girth so that the saddle is comfortably secure.
2. Have someone sit in the saddle with his or her feet in the stirrups.
3. Using a flat hand, slide your fingers underneath the pommel, near the
horse’s withers (the rise as the base of neck, where it joins the back).
See Chapter 2 for a diagram showing the parts of the horse. Your fingers
should fit comfortably between the horse and saddle. Be certain that
you can place at least three fingers between the horse’s withers and the
arch below the pommel.
4. Have a helper lift the horse’s left foreleg and pull it forward while your
fingers are in between the top of the horse’s shoulder blade and the
pommel. As the horse’s shoulder moves, make sure the saddle doesn’t
impede shoulder movement. Perform the same test on the horse’s right
side.
5. Stand behind the horse and look through the saddle (between the
underside of the saddle and the horse’s back). If the saddle fits, you
should see a tunnel of light shining through. If you don’t see any light,
the saddle is too snug. You likewise need to make sure that the saddle
isn’t too long for the horse. The seat panel shouldn’t reach past the
main part of the horse’s back onto the loins.
Western saddles
To make sure that a western saddle fits correctly, follow these steps:
1. Place the saddle on the horse’s back with a one-inch thick (or so)
saddle pad underneath it. Tighten the cinch so that it’s snug but 
comfortable.
When you try to tighten the cinch, you may find that it’s too short for
the horse’s barrel. Don’t reject the saddle simply because the cinch is
too short. If you really like the saddle and it fits, you can always buy a
longer, replacement cinch. Meanwhile, borrow a cinch that fits so you
can continue to try out the saddle.
2. Have a rider sit in the saddle with his or her feet in the stirrups.
Be sure that you can fit at least three fingers between the arch of the
pommel and the horse’s withers.
3. Examine the width of the saddletree, or frame, as it sits on the horse
and compare it with the shape of the horse’s back. On a horse with a
wide back and lower withers, the tree needs to be wide. On a narrower
back with higher withers, the tree shouldn’t be too wide. Place your fin-
gers sideways (on a flat hand) between the saddle and the top of the
horse’s shoulder to help determine the width of the tree. If the fit is so
116
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

tight that you can’t squeeze your fingers between the saddle and the top
of the horse’s shoulder, the tree is too wide for your horse. If you can put
your entire hand between the saddle and the top of the horse’s shoulder,
the tree is too narrow.
Fitting the rider
The saddle has to fit the horse, sure, but it also needs to fit you. Otherwise,
you’ll be miserable when you ride. The good news is that finding a saddle
that suits you is much easier than finding one that suits your horse.
The seats of English and western saddles are measured in inches. If you’re
taking lessons, or using a friend’s saddle and you like the feel of it, find out
the measurement of the seat. Armed with this information, you can rule out
saddles that don’t have the same seat measurement. You can also try sitting
in different saddles in a tack shop and take note of which size suits you best.
English saddles
To determine whether an English saddle fits you, try it out in the store or on
the horse, whichever is easier. We think you need try several saddles in the
store first so that you don’t find one that fits your horse perfectly but doesn’t
work for you.
Sit in the seat with your stirrups at the length you prefer (see Chapter 15 for
information about determining the right stirrup length) and gauge how com-
fortable the saddle feels. You need to have about four inches of saddle in front
of your body and four inches behind it.
If you like the way the saddle feels and you take it home to try on your horse,
check the fit on the horse’s back first. If it fits your horse, then put a pad
under the saddle and take it for a spin to see how it feels. Ask a trainer or
other person experienced in English riding to watch you and point out any
problems with the saddle that he or she may see.
Western saddles
Western saddles usually are easy to try out in the store, because they’re often
displayed on wooden sawhorses. If for some reason you can’t try the saddle
on a sawhorse, take it home and try it on your real horse. Make sure that it
fits your horse’s back first.
Adjust your stirrups to the proper length (see Chapter 15 to find out how).
Sit in the saddle with your feet in the stirrups, and judge the comfort of the
saddle. You need to have about four inches in between the front of your body
and the pommel. Your derriere needs to rest against the base of the cantle
but not squashed against the rise of the cantle.
If the saddle appears to fit you and your horse upon initial inspection, get on,
and ride in it. After half an hour of riding, it still should feel comfortable.

Tack It Up: Other Riding Requirements
Saddles are a major purchase, but the shopping doesn’t stop there. Plenty of
other accessories are needed before you can get up on your horse and start
riding.
Getting a heads-up on bridles
Bridle is the word that applies to the headgear used on the horse during riding.
A bridle consists of a headstall, the part that goes over the ears and connects
to the bit; reins, the leather straps that attach to the bit and are held by the
rider; and a bit, the piece, usually made of metal, that goes inside the horse’s
mouth — or a substitute for a bit. We cover bits (which you buy separately
from a bridle) in more detail in the following section.
Each riding discipline has its own style of bridle, but bridles within each dis-
cipline’s style also vary. The needs of your horse are the determining factors
in the kind of bridle you ultimately buy.
Bridles have buckles on them and are adjustable, so you don’t need to worry
much about matching your horse’s head to a particular bridle — most bridles
fit most horses. The exceptions to this rule are horses or ponies with a very
small heads or draft horses like Belgians or Clydesdales with a very large
heads. In either situation, you need to buy bridles that are specially suited
to the horse’s head sizes. Similarly, you occasionally may run across a bridle
that is meant for an average-sized horse but turns out to be too small.
Before you go bridle shopping, have an experienced horseperson help you
determine the type of bridle your horse needs. Figure 6-6 shows a variety of
English and western bridles. The remainder of this section explains the differ-
ent bridles.
The English disciplines of hunt seat, dressage, and saddle seat use several
different types of bridle styles. The basic bridle for each virtually is the same,
but you’ll find these following variations:
 Hunt-seat bridle: Hunt-seat riders typically use a standard snaffle bridle
with a snaffle bit. This bridle consists of a headstall strap, a browband
that goes across the forehead, a throatlatch that attaches under the
horse’s jowl, and a noseband that goes across the nose and under the
jaw. Variations of this bridle exist, including ones with a drop noseband
and a flash noseband to keep the horse from evading the action of the
bit by opening his mouth.
 Dressage bridle: The aesthetics of the dressage bridle are somewhat dif-
ferent, but riders also use the snaffle bridle in dressage.
118
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Although many of the same bits and headstalls used in hunt seat also are
used in dressage, some levels of dressage competition don’t allow cer-
tain bits and nosebands. If you intend to show in dressage, contact the
ruling dressage federation in your country to find out the latest rules.
 Saddle-seat bridle: Horses ridden saddle seat typically wear a double
bridle, which is similar to a snaffle bridle but has an additional cheek
piece to hold an additional bit.

Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

Bridles for western riding come in a few styles. Each has a headstall and reins.
Some western bridles are split-ear style, which means a piece of leather at the
top of the headstall is attached for the horse’s ear to fit through. Other west-
ern bridles have browbands instead. And still others have neither browband
nor split-ear design, and simply rest behind the horse’s ears.
Within western styles, bridles differ mostly based on whether you use a bit.
The material of western bridles likewise varies of late, and western riders can
find not only traditional leather bridles but also brightly colored and elabo-
rately patterned nylon bridles. The following list explains some of the types
of western bridles:
 Traditional western bridle: The traditional western bridle consists of a
split-ear, browband, or plain headstall design with a bit attached. If the
bit you use has a curb shank (a long, curved piece between the bit and
the part where the reins attach), a curb chain or strap under the chin is
included. A pair of reins finishes off the bridle.
 Western hackamore bridle: Not all western bridles have bits; some are
fitted with a device called a hackamore, which is a nosepiece that enables
the rider to control the horse without using a bit. Hackamore bridles are
split into these two main types:
• A bosal hackamore bridle is a rolled leather training device that’s
used to school young horses. It fits over the horse’s head like a
noseband.
• A mechanical hackamore bridle is a device that not only is for
training, but also for general riding. The mechanical hackamore
consists of a metal device that has a rolled leather noseband with
metal parts beneath it. The reins attach to the metal piece, which
helps you control the horse by putting pressure on the nose, chin,
and poll. The entire hackamore piece is attached to a western
headstall.
Breaking down bits
If you ever feel like being overwhelmed, go into any large tack store and take
a look at the bits. There are easily as many bit styles as there are breeds of
horses. Why such a huge number? Horse people throughout the centuries
have endeavored to invent a bit for every equine riding problem, and they’ve
nearly succeeded.
The purpose of a bit (which is usually made of metal) is to apply pressure to
the horse’s mouth and thus convey messages to stop, slow down, turn, and
so on. The shape of the mouthpiece determines how that pressure is applied.
Some bits are mild, meaning they apply minimal pressure. Others are harsh,
demanding the horse’s undivided attention by stricter means.
120
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Beginning riders need to ride with a relatively mild bit until they develop their
skills, because a harsh bit in inexperienced hands can result in pain for the
horse. Ask a trainer for help on properly bitting your horse.
Western and English riding use different bits. The curb bit is the most common
bit in western riding, while English riders typically use a bit called the loose
ring snaffle. See Figure 6-7 for examples of some types of western and English
bits. You can use any type of western or English bit with any type of bridle, as
long as both the bridle and bit match the same discipline — western bits with
western bridles and English bits with English bridles.
When buying a bit for your horse, you need the measurement of your horse’s
mouth, in inches. Figure this out by trying different bitted bridles on your
horse. The average bit size for a horse is 5 inches.
Ask a friend with several horses or a trainer to loan you bits in a range of 
different sizes. Try the bridles on your horse and see which bit fits the best.
The best fitting bit protrudes only a fourth of an inch on each side of the
horse’s mouth. Just to be sure of the size, measure the actual mouthpiece of
the best fitting bit with a measuring tape. The measurement in inches is the
bit size you need for your horse.

Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

Checking out assorted riding aids
The number of contraptions that have been invented through the years to aid
in riding is almost mind-boggling. The following sections list some of the most
common gear. Some of these things are necessities, but others are luxuries.
Girths/cinches
In English riding dialect, the piece of equipment that holds the saddle onto
the horse’s body is the girth. In western lingo, it is known as the cinch. You
obviously need one of these if you plan to ride your horse.
When you buy an English saddle, you have to buy a girth, too, because the
two rarely come packaged together. You can purchase a leather girth or one
made from a man-made material — either is fine (see nearby sidebar, “A great
debate: Synthetic versus leather tack,” for more information). Before you buy,
be sure to measure your horse’s girth area (underneath the horse) from one
side of the saddle to the other. The resulting number in inches is the size girth
you need.
When you purchase a western saddle, a cinch normally comes with it. If not,
you can buy one in leather, nylon, or another synthetic material, such as
Neoprene. Measure the area of your horse’s girth from the right side of the
saddle to about one-third of the way up the left side past the horse’s elbow.
Buy a cinch that is closest to that length.
For your horse’s comfort, consider buying girth cover for your English girth
or western cinch strap made of fleece (or synthetic fleece). This fuzzy cover-
ing keeps the strap from rubbing on your horse’s skin.
Stirrup irons and leathers
Only English riders need to worry about buying stirrup irons and leathers,
because western saddles come with the stirrups and leathers attached. In
case you’re wondering, stirrup irons are those metal doohickeys you keep your
feet in while you ride. Stirrup leathers are what hold the irons onto the saddle.
Stirrup irons (usually made of stainless steel, despite the name) are relatively
standard items. Make sure that you buy a pair that fit your feet while you’re
wearing riding boots or shoes, of course, and invest in some rubber pads
to go on the stirrups. The pads help your foot stay securely in the stirrup.
Be sure to get the right size pads for your stirrup irons. If you aren’t sure of
the size, take an iron with you to a tack store and ask a store employee to
help you.
122
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Find stirrup leathers that match the leather of your saddle so the entire saddle
looks like one unit. If your saddle is brown, don’t get black stirrup leathers!
Artificial aids
When riding, the legs, hands, and voice are natural aids that you use to com-
municate with the horse. Any external device that you use to send a message
(other than the bridle) is called an artificial aid, including:
 Spurs: English and western riders wear spurs on occasion. English spurs
are blunt tipped and come in either short or long lengths. Western spurs
come in a variety of styles, nearly all with something called a rowel, or
star-like wheel. Spurs attach to the heel of your boot with a leather or
nylon strap.
You use spurs to prompt a horse forward. Horses that aren’t responsive
to leg aids usually respond to the prodding of spurs. If used properly,
spurs are not inhumane but merely send the horse a stronger message
than a leg squeeze.
In the wrong hands, spurs can be cruel and dangerous devices. Before you
strap on a pair of spurs, make sure that you understand the proper way
to use them. Learn this skill from a trainer or riding instructor. Only riders
who have considerable training in the saddle should attempt to use spurs.
 Whips: Each discipline of riding has its own design of whip.
• Hunt-seat riders use a crop, a short stick with a leather bat on
the end.
• Dressage riders use a dressage whip, which is longer than a crop
with a tiny tassel on the end. Saddle-seat riders sometimes carry
a dressage whip.
• Western riders traditionally use something called a switch, which
is, in essence, a big tassel (plenty of western riders also use crops
because they’re more readily available).
For longeing a horse, a long longe whip is used to keep the horse moving
in a forward direction. (For more information on longeing, see Chapter 13.)
Although whips typically are thought of as instruments of brutality, riders
shouldn’t use them that way. Whips usually serve as visual aids for riders
who want to send any number of messages to a horse. In some cases, the
whip actually makes contact with the horse, but merely as a tap, and
never to deliver a beating.
Beating a horse is inhumane and even illegal in many places. Never use
your whip to punish your horse, and don’t stand by and allow other
people to do it either. A whip should never be used in anger.
123
Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

Exercising your options on training gear
A few of the items used in training — or at least in the management of the
horse — are worthy of your attention:
 Longe line: To exercise your horse from the ground by longeing him
(see Chapter 13 for more about longeing), you need a longe whip, men-
tioned in the previous section, and a longe line.
A longe line is a cotton or nylon rope ranging anywhere from 15 to
30 feet in length. One end of the line attaches to the horse’s halter
(we cover halters later in this chapter), cavesson (a headpiece made
just for the purpose of longeing), or bridle, the other end is held in
your hand.
We prefer cotton longe lines because they’re less likely to give you the
rope burn that synthetic lines can if the horse pull it through your
hands.
 Longe cavesson: You can longe your horse in a snaffle bridle or halter,
but a longe cavesson actually is preferable. This item fits on the horse’s
head like a halter, but unlike a halter, it features a series of rings on the
top part of the noseband. The longe line attaches to the center ring and
gives the handler good control over the horse during longeing.
 Stud chain: A stud chain is a steel-link chain usually about a foot long,
with a ring at one end and a clip at the other. The chain fits around the
horse’s muzzle in conjunction with a halter, and is used to apply pres-
sure to help control the horse.
Stud chains derive their names from being used on stallions during
breeding. Ordinary horse people tend to use them on horses that have
poor ground manners and problems leading. If you ever have to lead a
horse that prefers to drag you rather than walk beside you, a stud chain
is a literal lifesaver.
Considering a bareback pad
A bareback pad is not a necessity, but just a fun item to have around. If you
ever have a day that you don’t feel like throwing on the saddle, but would
rather just have a relaxing stroll around the barn or countryside, a bareback
pad helps make your ride more comfortable for you and your horse.
124
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Bareback pads are usually brightly colored and made from synthetic fleece.
Most have a nylon hand strap sown on near the horse’s withers specifically for
the rider to grab when security is needed. The pad attaches to the horse via a
nylon girth that buckles on either side of the horse. If you have a pony, you’ll
need to buy a bareback pad made in pony size. Bareback pads for regular-sized
horses are generally one-size-fits-all.
Most bareback pads don’t have stirrups, although some do. We don’t recom-
mend you ride your horse extensively in a bareback pad with stirrups because
this practice can result in a sore back for your horse.
Although bareback pads are great whenever you don’t feel like dealing with
your saddle, they can be dangerous if not properly secured to the horse. One
of the most common causes of horseback riding accidents is a bareback pad
that has slipped off the horse. Make certain your pad is firmly secured to the
horse with the girth that comes attached to the pad. If the girth is too loose
and you can’t make it any tighter, add more holes to it using a hole punch, or
put a saddle blanket underneath it.
Ground Work: Horse-Care Items
Riding is only one part of horsemanship. True horse people are just as dedi-
cated to caring for their horses on the ground. A trip to your local tack store or
a flip through an equine mail-order catalog shows you no shortage of horse-care
items. Making heads or tails out of all that stuff can be a challenge — unless
you have this book to show you the way!
Understanding the importance of halters
The halter is probably the piece of equine equipment that you use most often.
Just about everything you do with your horse involves a halter. In fact, halters
are so important that wearing one is the first thing a horse learns to do.
Halters differ from bridles in that halters have neither a bit nor reins. Instead,
halters exist solely to provide control of the horse from the ground. When you
take your horse out of his stall or pasture, groom your horse, bathe him, clip
him, or tie him, you use a halter.
125
Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

Halters are available in expensive leather designs and inexpensive, yet colorful
nylon versions. When you buy a halter, get one big enough to fit your horse’s
head. The halter should be comfortably loose, but not so loose that it falls
way down on the horse’s nose (see Figure 6-8 for a correct fit of a halter).
If you need to leave a halter on a horse that’s loose in the stall or pasture,
choose a breakaway model that snaps under pressure to avoid snagging the
halter on something and trapping the horse.
We recommend that you keep more than one halter on hand. You never know
when you may need a second one in an emergency.
Looking at lead ropes
You can’t own a horse and not own a lead rope. Without one, you can’t
maneuver your horse while you’re on the ground. Trying to lead the horse
by only his halter can leave you vulnerable and unable to maneuver if a prob-
lem arises.
Figure 6-8:
A correctly
fitted halter
with a
lead rope
attached.
126
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

The lead rope attaches to the ring at the bottom of the halter’s noseband,
underneath the horse’s jaw (as shown in Figure 6-8). You tie your horse with
the lead rope and hold it as the horse walks beside you.
Lead ropes are available in cotton, leather or synthetic material. Leather lead
ropes are on the expensive side, and are usually only used at horse shows.
And although synthetic lead ropes come in bright colors and in sets with
matching synthetic halters, we recommend you purchase a cotton rope (which
is also available in colors but not as bright and fancy). Cotton is less likely to
burn your hands when your horse pulls back while you’re holding the rope.
Cleaning up with grooming supplies
How do you keep a 1,000-pound horse clean? With specially made equine
grooming tools, of course. Scores of different kinds of brushes, combs, and
other doodads exist for the express purpose of horse grooming. If you like to
spend money, go ahead and buy some of them. But the list that follows is all
you really need to get started. See Figure 6-9 for illustrations of the different
basic grooming tools and Chapter 9 for specifics on grooming procedures.

Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

Brushes and grooming tools
You need to have these types of brushes and grooming tools in your tack
organizer to properly groom your horse. Each brush serves a different 
purpose:
 Currycomb: A rubber currycomb can be used to loosen the dirt in your
horse’s coat before you go over him with the stiff brush.
 Stiff brush: Also known as a dandy brush, this handy tool helps you get
the dirt out of your horse’s coat — which is no easy task.
 Soft brush: A gentler version of the stiff brush, the soft brush gets that
top layer of dust off your horse’s coat and makes it shine. This brush
also is perfect for grooming your horse’s face.
 Mane & tail brush: Some people use a comb to groom their horse’s mane
and tail, but we think that a vented brush with plastic bristles is best for
untangling hair without breaking it.
 Shedding blade: This metal blade with teeth does wonders to get rid of
loose hair when your horse is shedding out his winter coat.
Before using brushes that have been used on other horses, disinfect them
first by soaking them in a solution of one part bleach to four parts water.
You’re less likely to spread potential fungal infections between horses.
Clippers
If you want to keep your horse’s errant hairs trimmed, you need to purchase
a pair of horse clippers. Horse clippers look much like barber’s clippers, but
they’re specially made for horses in that they tend to be quieter and smaller
so as not to intimidate the horse.
Several manufacturers make horse clippers in a variety of styles. For regular
maintenance, you need only a small pair. If you intend to do serious body clips
on a regular basis, you may want to consider investing in a larger pair to use
just for that purpose.
When you buy your clippers, pick up a couple of extra blades, too. Nothing
is worse than having to clip a horse with a dull clipper blade because it’s the
only one you have. When your blades become dull, have them sharpened by
a clipper service, referred to you by your local tack and feed store.
Other tools
In addition to brushes and clippers, you need a couple of other nifty items:
128
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Buckets: You can never own too many buckets when you own a horse.
Buckets have many uses, including giving baths, serving grain and sweet
feed, and providing water in an emergency or when on the road (to name
just a few uses). Be sure to buy your buckets from a horsy source so you’re
sure that you’re getting specially designed horse buckets. Regular buckets
like the kind sold in grocery and hardware stores are not heavy-duty
enough for use with horses. Avoid rubber buckets because they collect
bacteria and are hard to clean effectively.
 Hoof pick: The standard hoof pick has a colored, rubber handle and
a metal, V-shaped head for cleaning out the underside of the horse’s
hooves. You can also find hoof picks made of solid plastic with scrapers
attached and picks with nylon brushes for cleaning feet.
 Sponges: Sponges are good for giving baths and for wiping off sweat and
other things that stick to your horse. Horse-friendly sponges are available
in different sizes, shapes, and colors. The ones you buy are a matter of
personal preference.
 Sweat scraper: Sweat scrapers come in two styles: long, straight plastic
wands; and metal bows with one straight ridge and one toothed ridge
and each end of the bow attached to a plastic handle (see Figure 6-9 to
get an idea of what each of these scrapers looks like). The toothed side
of the metal sweat scraper functions as a shedding blade for removing
loose hair during the horse’s springtime shed.
Despite the name of this tool, we recommend that it be used only for
scraping water off a freshly bathed horse. Merely scraping off sweat
isn’t healthy for your horse’s skin — water should be applied to remove
the salts.
 Tack organizer: Rather than throwing all your grooming tools into a shoe-
box, keep your equipment in a tack organizer. A tack organizer is a plas-
tic box with different compartments and a handle. You probably already
have one for your gardening tools. Buy a tack organizer at a tack store,
or get the same product at your local gardening center. Be sure to buy
yourself an organizer in a really cool color!
Playing Dress-Up: Horse Clothes
People wear clothes, so why not horses, too? Actually, horse clothes exist for
some very practical reasons. The following sections look at some common
items of horse clothing and their functions.
129
Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

Putting on coverups
Horses somehow managed to survive for a long time before humans began
dressing them in coverups. Now, it seems, they can’t do without them!
When you go to most busy stables in either summer or winter, you see several
different kinds of coverups in use. Although they may all look pretty much the
same to your as-yet-untrained eye, each one has a unique purpose.
Blankets and sheets
The term blanket applies to coverups that are used specifically to keep the
horse warm in cold weather. Blankets come in different styles and materials,
but most fit over the horse’s shoulders and reach to the horse’s tail. The body
is covered to midway down the legs. Straps sown into the blanket fit around
the horse’s girth and back legs to keep the blanket in place.
Blankets can be quilted and lined with wool. Or, they can be thin, breath-
able, and water-resistant. Whatever blanket need your horse has, a blanket
exists to fill it (see Figure 6-10 for a couple of examples of horse blankets).
Here are a couple of types of blankets on the market in the United States
and Canada:
 Stable blanket: Horses in stalls and small paddocks wear stable blankets,
which either are thick and very warm or very lightweight. A huge variety of
different stable blanket designs are out there, suited to different weather
needs and horse-owner tastes.
 Turn-out blanket: Turn-out blankets are for horses that spend most of
their time outdoors at pasture. These blankets are usually warm, water
resistant, and durable. They are fitted with special straps that prevent
the blanket from getting twisted when the horse rolls.
Not every horse needs to wear a blanket in the winter. If your horse is very
old or very young, sick or recovering from illness, has a thin winter coat, or
is body clipped, he may need a blanket. If your horse doesn’t fit one of these
descriptions, chances are that a blanket isn’t necessary. The coat that Mother
Nature gave the horse gets the animal through the cold of winter.
Some coverups are to keep horses warm — others have a different purpose.
Refer to Figure 6-10 for examples of these coverups:
 Coolers: You use coolers specifically to help a horse cool down after a
workout without catching a chill. Coolers fit over the ears and stretch to
the back of the horse, covering everything but the head and lower legs.
Coolers are worn only when the horse is being handled, never when the
horse is unattended in his stall or pasture.
130
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Antisweat sheets: The purpose of an antisweat sheet is to help a horse
cool down after a workout by absorbing the sweat and letting it evaporate
off the body. Woven in a pattern that encourages circulation, the sheet fits
over the horse like a blanket and keeps the horse warm while enabling
sweat to dry quickly.
 Flysheets: Flysheets are for use mostly in the summer to protect the
horse’s body from biting flies. The sheets are made of lightweight, breath-
able material woven tightly enough so flies cannot fit their mouth parts
through the weave.

Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

Leg protectors
Considering how important a horse’s legs are, it’s no wonder so many leg 
protection devices exist. Our favorites include the following:
 Bell boots: Bell boots protect a horse from nicking his front pasterns
(ankles) and stepping on his front shoes with his back hooves during
exercise, known as overreaching. Rubber bell boots fit over the horse’s
front hooves.
 Splint boots: Controversy rages over whether splint boots really do any
good, but their purpose is to support the horse’s tendons during work-
outs. Some people put them only on the front legs, while other riders
dress all four legs with splint boots. Splint boots are usually made from
synthetic material and are attached to the leg with hook-and-loop-fastener
enclosures.
 Polo wraps: Originally used on polo ponies to help protect their legs,
cotton polo wraps now are traditionally used by dressage riders as pro-
tection for the tendons during hard workouts. Riders in other disciplines
use them, too. No concrete scientific evidence exists to prove that polo
wraps, which are applied like wrapped bandages, do indeed help hard-
working horses, but many riders swear by them.
Before you attempt to put splint boots or polo wraps on your horse’s legs
the first time, you need a trainer or experienced person to show you exactly
how to do it. Improperly applied leg protection can actually harm your
horse’s legs.
Paying attention to assorted apparel
So many items are available for horses to wear; describing them all in this
book is impossible. Here are three of our favorites:
 Fly mask: Whoever invented the fly mask did a great service for the
domestic horse. Fly masks are mesh hoods that fit over the center part
of the head. They shield the horse’s eyes from face flies that feed on the
eyes’ moisture. Some fly masks also have ear covers that protect the
horse’s ears from biting gnats while also protecting the horse’s eyes.
 Fly wraps: These plastic mesh wraps keep flies from biting the horse’s
legs, the insects’ favorite part of the horse. The wraps go on all four legs
and fasten with hook-and-loop fasteners.
 Tail bag: They may look goofy, but tail bags are the answer to growing a
long, luxurious tail. As the name implies, the tail bag is just that: a bag
132
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

that holds a loosely braided tail. It serves as protection for fragile tail
hairs, keeping them clean and unbroken. Usually made from nylon, tail
bags often have a tassel or fringes at the end that helps the horse chase
away flies when it swings the encased swisher.
Looking Good: Your Own Riding Wear
The horse world has much tradition, and nowhere is this more obvious than
in riding apparel. Unlike the ready-to-wear market where fashions change,
equestrians have been wearing the same basic outfits for decades.
Just like with other sports, horseback riding has its own distinctive look. You
wouldn’t play tennis in jeans and a flannel shirt unless you wanted to give the
impression that you didn’t know what you were doing, right? Well, the same
thing holds true with riding. If you want to look like one of the gang, you’d better
dress like the gang, especially if you plan to show your horse.
The apparel in each discipline has its own distinct look, of course, just like the
tack. In this section, we describe the appropriate apparel for each riding style,
both for the show ring and for schooling (regular riding). Although you may see
riders donning variations of what we describe here, if you follow our advice,
you won’t find yourself in the horse-world equivalent of plaid golfing pants.
Riding apparel for children is virtually the same as it is for adults, just in minia-
ture. When you buy riding clothes for kids, get a comfortable size that really
fits. No one is more miserable than a kid trying to ride in boots or breeches
that are too big or too small.
Donning formal hunt-seat garb
Hunt-seat riding is based on British tradition and has a very formal appear-
ance. The only thing that seems to change periodically is the color of jackets
and breeches. We’ve seen green, rust, and beige come and go in popularity
during the past 15 years or so:
 Show: Hunt-seat riders in the show ring wear a white or pinstriped cotton
riding shirt, long-sleeved preferred. The women’s shirt has a band collar
that usually bears a monogram. Men wear shirts with a standard straight
collar and a regular necktie. Both genders wear breeches and dress
(riding) or field boots. (Although breech colors go in and out of style —
avoiding white if you ride hunt seat is always a safe bet.) A dark-colored
133
Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

or gray pinstriped, tapered wool riding jacket tops off the ensemble for
men and women, along with a black velvet hunt cap or riding helmet.
See Figure 6-11 for a drawing of this apparel.
 Schooling: Male and female hunt-seat riders wear breeches for school-
ing, along with dress boots, field boots, or paddock boots and chaps.
Tops are casual — anything from a T-shirt to a turtleneck. A schooling
or velvet-covered show helmet also is worn.
Dressing in elegant dressage attire
Everything about dressage is elegant, including the clothing. Very traditional
in style, dressage apparel never seems to change much:
 Show: Most dressage riders wear white cotton shirts with long or short
sleeves. Both sexes sport a stock tie, fastened with a gold horsy pin over
a band collar. In the lower levels and at smaller shows, riders often wear
light-colored breeches, black dress (riding) or field boots, a black or dark
dressage or hunting jacket, and a hunt cap or regular black helmet.
In the upper levels and at bigger shows, male and female riders wear
white breeches, black dress boots, a black derby, and a black dressage
jacket or shadbelly coat. See Figure 6-12 to get a look at dressage show
apparel.
Figure 6-11:

female hunt-
seat apparel

134
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Schooling: Dressage riders dress more casually when schooling than
they do in the show ring. Many wear any color breeches, dress boots,
field boots, or paddock boots with chaps or half-chaps, and T-shirts or
mock turtlenecks. They also wear schooling or show helmets.
Slipping into saddle-seat apparel
Although hunt-seat and dressage apparel have a distinct European look to
them, saddle-seat apparel has an old-fashioned, all-American appeal:
 Show: In the show ring, both male and female saddle-seat riders wear a
white shirt, dark jodhpurs, and a riding derby. They both wear saddle-seat
coats, day coats, or saddle-seat suit jackets, and jodhpur boots under
the jodhpurs. Women sometimes wear tuxedo shirts with feminine bow
ties or rosettes, and both genders wear wingtip or straight collars with
men’s bow ties or neckties, respectively. A vest sometimes is worn under
the coat. See Figure 6-13 for saddle-seat show attire.
 Schooling: Saddle-seat riders of both sexes usually wear jodhpurs for
schooling, along with jodhpur boots. They sometimes wear regular
breeches and paddock boots. Their tops are often casual T-shirts or
mock turtlenecks. They also usually wear a schooling helmet or hunt-
seat show helmet.

Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

Wearing western gear
Formal western attire is only required in the show ring, and then only in “rail”
classes like western pleasure, horsemanship, and trail. Otherwise, the west-
ern look is casual and comfortable, and a favorite of male riders:
 Show: In classes calling for formal western attire, female riders wear
tuxedo shirts with long-sleeved western jackets or western riding vests,
and feminine bow ties or rosettes. They also wear jeans and fringed
chaps, western paddock boots or riding boots, and broad-brimmed
western felt hats. Male riders wear straight-collared western shirts
with a western tie, along with jeans and fringed chaps. Both also wear
paddock boots or western riding boots, and a broad-brimmed western
felt hat tops off the outfit. Both wear leather belts with large silver, 
western belt buckles. See Figure 6-14 for formal western show ring
apparel.
Riders showing in performance classes such as reining, barrel racing,
and cutting need only to wear a western hat, jeans, fringed chaps, west-
ern boots or paddock boots, and a western shirt. A western tie is a nice
touch.
When buying western boots for riding, pick out a style designed specifi-
cally for riding. Most western boots for sale in regular shoe stores are
for street wear and don’t have the right style heel for safe riding. Boots
designed for riding have soles that prevent the rider’s foot from slipping
through the stirrup and help keep the rider’s foot in place. Shopping
for your boots at a tack store is the best way to find appropriate riding
boots.
Figure 6-13:

136
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Schooling: Western riders usually wear loose-fitting jeans or special riding
jeans that combine elastic with denim for a comfortable fit. They often
ride in paddock boots, western boots, or riding shoes, and wear just
about any kind of shirt including T-shirts, western shirts, or mock turtle-
necks. Cautious western riders school their horses in helmets, usually
the vented kind that endurance riders use.
Kicking around in comfortable clothes
For days when you aren’t riding but are instead doing equine-related chores
like grooming, longeing or simply mucking stalls, wear the following apparel
for comfort and safety (see Chapter 17 for details):
 Pants: Jeans or stretch tights are the most comfortable pants to work in
around the stable.
 Shirt: Wear a T-shirt, sweatshirt, mock turtleneck, or flannel shirt. Make
sure that the shirt is loose-fitting and comfortable. Make sure that it’s
something you don’t care too much about, too, because your shirt is
sure to get pretty dirty.
 Shoes: Riding shoes, barn shoes, or hiking boots are best around the
stable when the weather is dry. Rubber barn boots are good if the ground
is muddy or you plan to muck stalls. Never wear tennis shoes to work
around horses because they don’t provide your foot with much protection
if a 1,000-pound klutz steps on your toe. Of course no functional footwear
provides 100-percent protection if you get stepped on, but the heavier
the shoe, the better off your toes are, should it happen.

Chapter 6: Getting into Gear with Horse Equipment

Using your head by wearing a helmet
Riding can be a dangerous sport. Not because horses are vicious creatures, but
because the laws of the universe dictate that falling off a horse is way too easy.
Falling off a horse usually results in nothing more than muscle soreness, but
if you fall and hit your head, serious injury or even permanent brain damage
can result. To prevent these dire consequences most riders wear helmets.
Some riders, however, don’t wear helmets because they’re hot during the
summer. Helmets are also the cause of the female tragedy known as helmet
hair. Riders who don’t wear helmets are risking the health and well-being of an
often-ignored organ known as the brain every time they mount up on a horse.
Although fashion and peer pressure may dictate that you should not wear a
helmet (western riders are notorious for not wearing them). We recommend
that all riders wear a helmet whenever possible. If you are jumping horseback,
you really have no choice. When jumping, you absolutely must wear a helmet.
When you shop for a helmet, make sure you buy one for equestrians (bike
helmets will not do) that provides significant protection to your skull. In the
United States, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) sets
standards for helmet construction. If a helmet meets these standards, it
receives a seal of approval from the Safety Equipment Institute (SEI). Only
buy an SEI-approved helmet.
Helmets are especially important for children, whose growing skulls are more
fragile than the skulls of adults. Make sure your child always wears a safety
helmet when he or she rides.

Housing Your Horse Comfortably
In This Chapter
 Understanding the basics of keeping your horse in a boarding stable or at home
 Providing equine accommodations on your own property
 Establishing work and play areas for your horse
H
orses are pretty big creatures. Unlike a dog or cat, your horse can’t just
move in with you and start sleeping at the foot of the bed. No, you have
to do plenty of thinking and planning on the subject of where and how to house
your horse.
People who own horses in today’s world basically have two choices when it
comes to equine housing: Keep the horse on their own property or board the
animal elsewhere. These options are vastly different logistically, and your
choice has a significant impact on your lifestyle.
If you bought this book because you own property that’s zoned for horses,
and if you dream of a having a horse in your backyard, you may not need to
ponder the question of where to keep your equine buddy. But, maybe you
live in an urban or suburban area, have only a small backyard barely suitable
for your Labrador retriever, and think that you have little choice other than
to board your horse at your Uncle Jasper’s house 70 miles outside the city
limits.
Ultimately, you need to attain the most convenient and economically feasible
housing arrangement for your horse. You want your horse to be happy and
healthy, and you want horse ownership to be both fun and manageable for
you. Keep these points in mind when making your decisions about housing.
Before you decide where your horse can call home, we urge you to read this
chapter to get an idea of both backyard horsekeeping and boarding, along
with details on how to correctly do both. After you discover the pros and
cons of backyard horsekeeping and boarding, you’ll be able to make a much
more intelligent — and ultimately correct — decision.

Away from Home: Boarding Stables
A boarding stable is a commercial establishment that provides housing and
limited care for horses. Boarding stables earn their income by charging horse
owners a monthly fee for boarding their horse. Some boarding stables also
offer horse owners additional horse care, such as exercising or blanketing
their horses.
Most people who utilize the services of boarding stables live in urban or sub-
urban areas. They can’t keep their horses on their own land, so they board
them at a nearby stable. Accommodations for horses vary greatly from stable
to stable and region to region, with the more luxurious offerings costing more
than the ordinary ones. Generally speaking, keeping your horse in a box stall
(an indoor, barn-like enclosure — see “Housing your horse indoors” later in
this chapter for details) will cost you more than pasture boarding.
Even if you have your own horse property, you still need to consider boarding.
Boarding offers many benefits, particularly to first-time horse owners. Even if
your dream is to have your horse in your backyard, explore the possibility of
boarding for at least the first year that you own your horse.
In the following sections, we cover the advantages and disadvantages of
boarding your horse, your boarding responsibilities, and ways to find and
choose a suitable boarding stable (either commercial or private).
The pros and cons of boarding
Plenty of really good reasons exist for boarding your horse, especially if
you’re a first-time horse owner:
 Convenience: When you board your horse, you’re hiring someone else to
do much of the daily upkeep needed to maintain a horse in good, healthy
condition. And that means the boarding stable staff is responsible for
feeding your horse every day, providing water, and cleaning his stall.
If you choose to board your horse, not only do you avoid these chores,
but you also avoid worrying about things like buying and storing hay
and bedding material and disposing of equine waste.
 Help with your horse: Boarding stables are places where horse owners
of varying experience congregate. Most boarding stables also have train-
ers available for hire to boarders. First-time horse owners who board their
animals often find they’re surrounded by people who can help them with
just about any equine problem that comes up. That’s a big contrast to
being alone at home with your horse.

Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 A place to learn: You can find out a great deal about horse care and han-
dling just by being around other boarders. You may see others make
mistakes to avoid, and you can figure out the right way to do many
things by observing your fellow boarders.
 Riding facilities: Most boarding stables have arenas for exercise, wash-
racks for bathing, mechanical hot walkers for exercising your horse, and
access to riding trails. These facilities are available to horse owners as
part of their boarding fee. You may not have access to these amenities
at home.
 Social atmosphere: Boarding stables are wonderful places to meet and
make new friends who share your interest in horses. Many stables even
foster the inherent social aspect of the environment by holding events
like barbecues, dances, and play days. Boarding stables also are good
for your horse’s social life, too. Your horse will find himself with plenty
of built-in equine friends.
Of course nothing is perfect, and boarding has its downside:
 Expense: If you figure out the day-to-day expense of keeping a horse, you
discover that you spend more boarding your horse than you do keeping
him at home. Of course, you’re paying not only for the horse’s feed when
you board, but also for the services that the stable provides. The amount
of money you pay for monthly board depends on where you live and the
type of facility you choose. Board can range from $100 a month for a pas-
ture in rural areas to $700 a month or more for a full-service facility in an
urban area.
 Inaccessibility: Boarding can be very convenient because you don’t need
to worry about feeding and cleaning up after your horse daily. However,
you do have the chore of driving to and from the stable every time you
want to see your horse (as opposed to merely stepping outside your
back door).
 Politics: Just as in any situation that involves humans, boarding stables
have their politics. Boarders get into squabbles, talk behind each other’s
backs, and sometimes even try to make trouble for one another with
stable management. Of course, you can avoid much of this by keeping to
yourself, but then you miss out on many opportunities for camaraderie.
 Instability: You may keep your horse at a wonderful boarding stable for
years, only to wake up one morning to find out the place has been sold.
The new owner may be someone who couldn’t care less about the busi-
ness, or even worse, a developer who wants to knock down your horse’s
stall and build condos instead. Both of these situations — and particularly
the latter — occur in the boarding stable world more than you may think.
If it happens to you, you have to start shopping for a new place to keep
your horse.
141
Chapter 7: Housing Your Horse Comfortably

Knowing a boarder’s responsibilities
If you think that boarding sounds like a good idea, keep in mind that you also
have certain responsibilities as a boarder. You must:
 Be considerate of other horse owners. In this book, we provide you
with all the information you need to be a responsible and considerate
horse owner. If you board your horse, you have a significant obligation
to follow the rules of safety and protocol. Handling your horse carelessly
can jeopardize the safety of your fellow boarders and their horses.
 Be courteous. If you find a really nice boarding stable that you’re happy
with, count your blessings and be considerate to the staff. It’s amazing
how many boarders behave rudely to staffers whenever they want some-
thing done or have a problem. You get further with staffers by being nice
rather than demanding.
 Consider the community: Boarding stables and horse property in general
are becoming more and more scarce these days. Land developers are
gobbling up rural areas for housing and commercial buildings, minimizing
the amount of places where horses can live. Homeowners in many once-
rural-now-suburban neighborhoods also are looking to push horses out
of their communities.
If you’re boarding your horse in an urban or suburban area, your stable’s
very presence in that area is tenuous. Be considerate to the people who
live in the surrounding community so they maintain a positive opinion of
the stable.
 Pay your board: Most boarding stable owners who run clean, well-kept
operations aren’t making profits hand over fist; they put a significant
amount money back into the stable’s upkeep. So paying your board in
full, on time, every month is important. Don’t expect the stable to carry
you for a few months because you want to buy yourself a big-screen TV.
If enough boarders pay late in any given month, the stable can experience
cash flow problems.
Selecting a commercial boarding stable
Boarding stables are just like any another type of business: Some are really
good, and others are really bad. The good ones provide safe, comfortable
accommodations for horses; have caring, conscientious, and knowledgeable
staffs; and offer excellent facilities for riders. The lousy ones are just the oppo-
site: They sport unsafe conditions for horses, have staffers who couldn’t care
less, and have nothing to offer boarders in the way of conveniences or facilities.
Before you commit to keeping your horse at any commercial facility, we strongly
recommend that you thoroughly check the place out. If you haven’t already
discovered boarding stables in your area, you can find local facilities to tour
142
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

by looking in your telephone directory. Take a look at as many stables as you
can, and spend some time walking around and talking to other boarders at
these facilities. The things you’re looking for include
 Safe, sturdy accommodations. Inspect the box stalls, paddocks (small
corrals, usually with some kind of shelter), and pastures. Make sure that
each of these enclosures is well constructed and well maintained. Check
to see whether gate latches are secure and horse-proof (that is, they can’t
be opened with a flip of the nose).
Do not board your horse at a stable that uses barbed wire as an enclosure.
A close encounter with barbed wire can seriously injure your horse. If you
find a stable you really like that uses barbed wire, politely ask them to
switch to a safer fencing. If they decline, consider boarding your horse
elsewhere.
If you choose to board your horse in a pasture or paddock, look for acces-
sibility to shelter from rain, snow, wind, and hot sun. If you plan to keep
your horse in a box stall, check to make sure that the horses are given at
least 8 inches of bedding in their stalls.
 Clean, safe surroundings. The stable property should appear well main-
tained. Be wary of a place that has junk lying around and an unkempt look.
If they don’t take care of their own property, they probably won’t take
very good care of your horse either.
 Security. Find out whether a guard or caretaker is on duty at the stable
24 hours a day. Not all boarding stables provide this kind of protection,
but we recommend that you hold out for it if you can. If you can’t find
one in your area, look for a stable that provides some kind of security
to ensure your horse won’t be stolen.
 Water. Find out how water is provided to each enclosure, and scout
around to make sure that each horse at the stable has a generous supply
of water at all times. If you live in a cold climate, find out how the man-
agement keeps the water from freezing in the winter.
 Quality feed. If quality pasture isn’t available to your horse, then hay
needs to make up the majority of his diet. Make sure that the stable you’re
considering offers hay as an option for feeding. Ask to take a look at the
stored hay on the stable property, and inspect it for quality. (See Chapter 8
for information on determining hay quality.)
If the stable stores grain, be certain that it’s kept securely locked up so
that the horses can’t get to it. Any escaped horse that gets into the grain
is in danger of colicking or laminitis. (See Chapter 11 for more about pre-
venting and reacting to these and other maladies.)
Use caution with stables that feed only commercial pelleted feed with no
other options, because a diet consisting solely of pellets is unhealthy for
your horse. If a stable that you like feeds only pelleted feed as part of your
regular boarding agreement, make sure that they agree to feed your horse
hay if you provide it.
143
Chapter 7: Housing Your Horse Comfortably

 Good care. Have a talk with the stable manager and find out about the
daily care the horses receive. Make sure that your horse’s stall is cleaned
at least once a day, every day, and that your horse is fed at least twice
daily. Also, ask the manager about the stable’s pest control program.
Find out what steps are taken control flies, rodents, and internal parasites,
and what method the stable uses to dispose of its waste. (See Chapter 8
for more info on general horse care.)
If you want extra care options for your horse, such as daily exercise,
blanketing, and supplemental feeding, find out whether these options
are available at the stable and, if so, at what cost.
 Health requirements. Determine which, if any, inoculations the stable
requires for horses to board. The more inoculations the stable requires,
the less likely your horse will become ill. The stable you choose should
require regular inoculations for influenza/rhinopneumonitis and equine
encephalomyelitis, at the very minimum. Boarders also need to show
proof of regular dewormings. (See Chapter 10 for more details on pre-
ventative healthcare for horses.)
 Riding facilities. Look for good-sized, well-maintained riding arenas,
turn-out pens, washracks, and hot walkers. Look for good footing in all
riding arenas, which means the dirt is soft — without being too deep —
not hard. If you live in an area that gets a lot of rain or snow, consider
holding out for a stable with a covered or indoor arena so you can ride
all year long regardless of the weather.
If you plan to trail ride, ask the manager for a map of the local trails and
find out how you can access them. Beware of trails that require you to
spend too much time riding on busy roads before gaining access to them.
 Tack storage. You need a place to store your saddle, bridles, halter, groom-
ing equipment, and everything else you need to care for your horse (see
Chapter 6 for horse gear details). Find out whether the boarding stable
rents on-site tack lockers or storage sheds to boarders. If not, you have
to provide your own or keep your equipment at home and bring it with
you every time you visit your horse.
 A professional demeanor. The boarding stable management should
expect you to sign injury liability waivers and a boarding agreement,
and fill out other official papers stating the name of your veterinarian
and a person to contact in case of an emergency. Reputable stables also
require proof your horse is up-to-date on his vaccines. Stable management
also needs to provide you with written rules of the stable. Be wary of any
boarding stable that has an overly casual attitude about your boarding
agreement. They may also have an overly casual attitude about caring
for your horse.
 Convenient location. Be sure to choose a stable that is easy for you to
get to. If it takes you an hour to drive each way to see your horse, chances
are you won’t get to see him as often as you should.
144
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Be aware that the nicer the stable, the more you have to pay for board. Don’t
opt for a stable that isn’t up to par just because the fees are low. When it comes
to boarding stables, you really do get what you pay for.
Choosing private boarding
Boarding your horse at a commercial facility isn’t your only option. Plenty
of people who own horse property rent out stalls, paddocks, and pasture
to individual horse owners to help offset the costs of keeping their own
horses. You can find these individuals by looking at ads in your local equine
publication, your daily newspaper and often from flyers tacked up at feed
stores.
If you decide to board at a friend’s or neighbor’s house, look for the same
type of qualities and amenities you look for when considering boarding your
horse at a commercial facility (see the previous section). The quality of feed,
care, and accommodations should be no less than they’d be at a 200-horse
facility.
Most people who offer private boarding don’t have a riding arena on their
property. If you’re a beginning rider, you need access to a riding arena where
you can safely develop your skills. Before you visit a property where you may
decide to board, ask the owner whether you have access to an on-site riding
arena or a nearby community riding arena.
If you decide to board with a private party, be sure to get an agreement in
writing. The agreement needs to spell out the amount of your board, all the
services included in the boarding price, the length of prior notice you’re
required to give before vacating the property, and what your liabilities and
responsibilities are as a boarder.
Staying Close: Having a Home Stable
If you’re one of the many who dreams of seeing a horse every morning when
you look out your kitchen window, a home stable may be the right housing
option for you — provided you live on property that has been zoned for horses.
If you live in a suburban or even rural neighborhood that forbids the keeping
of livestock, you have no other option than to board.
Double-check your zoning laws by contacting officials in the city or county
where you live before you run out and buy a horse to put on your land. If it
turns out that you can keep a horse or two on your property, then you can
discover the joys of at-home horsekeeping. Knowing that your backyard
145
Chapter 7: Housing Your Horse Comfortably

horse is waiting for you whenever you get the urge to ride or simply share in
some relaxing equine company is a wonderful feeling. Plus, something about
the feel and smell of horses on the property makes even the most modest
home feel very special indeed.
Although having a horse in your backyard is a great experience, don’t overly
romanticize the notion either. Keeping a horse on your property requires an
investment of time and hard work. In the following sections, we cover the
advantages, disadvantages, responsibilities, and financial commitment of
housing a horse at home.
The pros and cons of a home stable
Here are some really good reasons to keep a horse in your own home stable:
 Easy access: No driving to the stable when you want to ride! Your horse
is right there in your yard, just outside the back door. And if your horse
needs special care like a blanket put on every night, feeding of extra or
special feed, or medicating, his close proximity is convenient.
 Security: If you like to keep a close eye on your horse, a home stable
provides a chance to watch your equine buddy nearly 24 hours a day.
 Cost: Keeping a horse on your own property is less expensive on a monthly
basis than boarding him. At a boarding stable, you pay for daily feeding,
cleanup, and the use of the facilities. With an at-home horse, you do the
work yourself — your only cost in this regard is time.
If you determine that you want to keep your horse at home, you may find that
the disadvantages can easily outweigh the benefits:
 Hard work: With an at-home horse, you’re responsible for the daily
chores of feeding and cleaning. If you work full-time, you may find that
mucking your horse’s stall is the last thing you want to do either before
or after work.
 Being tied down: Because horses need to eat at regular times each day,
you need to be home during these times to put out the feed. If you can’t
be home, you need to make arrangements with a responsible neighbor
or a professional horse sitter.
 Maintenance responsibilities: Keeping a horse in your yard means stor-
ing hay on your property and possibly maintaining a quality pasture.
Add to that list storing and disposing of the waste your horse creates
and building and maintaining proper facilities for your animal.
 No support system: New horse owners who keep their animals at boarding
facilities have the benefit of asking other horse owners and professional
trainers for help. If you keep your horse at home and you run into a
problem, chances are you have no one to turn to for immediate advice.
146
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

 Limited riding facilities: Most owners of single-family horse properties
don’t have the space, time, or money to build and maintain their own
riding facilities. If you’re one of these people, you may not have access
to an arena in which you can ride — a real problem if you’re a beginning
rider. And if your property isn’t near riding trails, you won’t have that
option for riding, either.
 Liability: All kinds of potential liabilities fall on the shoulders of horse
owners. You need to have a talk with your insurance agent to determine
exactly what kind of property insurance you need to have with a horse
at home.
Knowing your responsibilities at home
If you decide to keep your horse at home, you must uphold a number of
responsibilities:
 Cleanliness: You have an obligation to your horse and to your neighbors
to keep your property clean and well maintained. If you don’t, you may
even get in trouble with the law.
 A good image: In urban and suburban areas everywhere, horse owners
are facing a growing challenge to their hobby. Whereas horse property
was commonplace at one time, it’s becoming harder and harder for horse
owners to find communities that are accepting of horses. You can do your
part by being friendly and considerate toward your neighbors, and make
every effort to resolve any horse-related problems that arise.
 Continuing education: Because you and your horse are pretty much on
your own, you need to learn as much about horses and horsekeeping as
possible. If you don’t continue to learn, your knowledge of all things equine
won’t advance, and you’ll end up shortchanging yourself and your horse.
Read plenty of books and magazines on horses, check out responsible
discussion groups on the Internet, and most important, join an eques-
trian group in your community. (You can start with the resources in the
Appendix.)
Committing yourself financially
Purchasing property that’s zoned for horses is more costly than purchasing
property that isn’t zoned for horses. If you’re lucky enough to get horse 
property that is already outfitted with safe and comfortable equine accom-
modations, consider yourself fortunate. If you buy a place that is zoned
for horses but not set up to house them, you have expenses ahead of you.
Adequate shelters, enclosures, waterers, feeders, and other items all have to
be installed before your property is ready for a horse (see the next section
for more details).
147
Chapter 7: Housing Your Horse Comfortably

Upkeep on horse property is costly, too. You need to keep your property in
good working order, with the fences painted and the grass trimmed (unless
you have your horse do the lawn mowing for you). You need to factor these
upkeep fees into your annual budget.
Don’t forget about the cost of owning a horse, which you have to consider
whether you keep your companion at home or board him. Include veterinar-
ian and shoer bills, feed, tack, and other equipment in your budget.
Setting Up Backyard Accommodations
Okay, suppose you decide to keep your horse at home, on your own prop-
erty. Where do you keep him and what exactly are your housing options?
Well, you have a few options, and we give you a close-up look at each in the
following sections.
Keeping your horse outdoors
In nature, horses live outdoors, where they constantly roam and graze.
Outdoor enclosures confine horses in open air and are popular places to
keep horses because they are more natural. Most horses prefer to be out-
doors and seem to do best there as long as you meet their needs for food,
water, and shelter.
When it comes to outdoor accommodations for your horse, you have two
choices: pastures and paddocks.
You need to keep the enclosure you choose for your horse free from debris.
For your horse’s safety, don’t use the enclosure to store old pipes, car parts,
or anything else.
Grazing your horse in a pasture
A pasture is defined as a substantial portion of fenced land where high-quality
grass grows for equine consumption.
If you have the land, motivation, and ability to create and manage a high-quality
pasture for your horse, a pasture is the best way to go. Horses that live on
pastureland suffer the least from colic, leg problems, breathing disorders,
stable vices (see Chapter 2), and other maladies that tend to afflict horses
confined in stalls. Pastures usually can accommodate more than one horse
at a time, too, providing an opportunity for its occupants to live together in
groups, as nature intended. Pastures can range in size from a half acre to hun-
dreds of acres, depending on how much land you have available.
148
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Starting and maintaining a pasture is hard work and takes some know-how.
We don’t have room in this book to give you a crash course on how to grow a
pasture, but we have enough space to tell you to go to your local agriculture
office (look in the government listings of your telephone directory for the
County Extension office) and library for help. Find a good book with informa-
tion on growing a pasture, and follow it. One such book is Horsekeeping on a
Small Acreage by Cherry Hill, published by Garden Way Publishing.
Even if your horse is on pasture, you still may need to supplement the
animal’s diet with hay during times when the grass is not growing or is lack-
ing in quality. Don’t assume that the grass alone will provide enough suste-
nance to the horse. Overgrazing, drought, and other problems can render a
quality pasture into a field of starvation for a horse. (See Chapter 8 for more
about feeding horses.)
Don’t forget to provide your horse with shelter from hot sun and inclement
weather. Add a shed to your horse’s pasture so the animal can get out of the
weather if he wants to (see “Sheltering your horse with a run-in shed” later in
this chapter).
Putting your horse in a paddock
A paddock, by our definition, is a small outdoor enclosure that is void of
viable pasture grass, and contains dirt as footing. In certain parts of the
Eastern United States, a paddock typically is thought of as a large pen
with board fencing. In the Western United States, most horses live in small 
12-by-12-foot or 12-by-24-foot paddocks made of a pipe enclosure, known as
a pipe corral.
A paddock is the next best thing to pasture because it gives the horse room
to move around. Because paddocks are outdoors, they also provide good
ventilation and more opportunities for mental stimulation for your horse
than a box stall does. For information on setting up a paddock, contact com-
panies in your area that install paddocks (look under “Fencing” in your tele-
phone directory).
If you decide to keep your horse in a paddock, make sure that you provide
him with a place where he can seek shelter from the rain, snow, wind, and hot
sun. A three-sided, run-in shed is a good option (see “Sheltering your horse
with a run-in shed” later in this chapter).
Focusing on the right fencing
A number of options exist regarding pasture and paddock fencing, including
wood, pipe fencing, and polyvinylchloride, to name just a few. Whatever type
of fence you choose, we strongly suggest that you only use fencing material
that is designed with equine safety in mind.
149
Chapter 7: Housing Your Horse Comfortably

The best material to use, in our opinion, is polyvinylchloride, arranged in a
post-and-rail design. Polyvinylchloride (PVC) is attractive, durable, and easy
to maintain. It can be expensive to install, but will last a very long time.
Wood, although traditional and charming, is expensive and destructible
(horses love to chew it). You also need to paint wood fencing on a regular
basis, whereas polyvinylchloride never needs painting.
Pipe fencing, on the other hand, is also safe and more affordable than
polyvinylchloride, but it isn’t as attractive as polyvinylchloride. Pipe fencing
is most commonly seen in Western states, often with a corrugated metal roof.
The advantages of pipe fencing, along with cost (it’s the least expensive of
the fencing mentioned here), are easy maintenance and adaptability. Paddocks
made of pipe fencing and panels can be more easily rearranged than wood or
polyvinylchloride fencing into paddocks that are bigger or smaller.
Although wood is high maintenance and can be expensive, some people prefer
to use it because of its innate beauty. If you want wood fencing, consider putting
a hotwire above the top rail to keep your horse from chewing. A hotwire gives
your horse a mild zap of electricity if he tries to chew the fence and thus pro-
tects your wood from gnawing teeth. Even if you protect your wooden fence
from your horse’s teeth, you’ll still need to paint it every so often to keep it
from looking faded and worn. Use a quality, nontoxic paint for maintenance.
Don’t enclose your pasture with barbed wire. Barbed wire is dangerous to
use around horses. Horses easily become tangled in barbed wire and can be
sliced to ribbons by the wire in short time as they struggle to get free.
Your pasture fence needs to be high enough to discourage your horse from
jumping out, so the posts need to stand at least 5-feet high, after they’ve been
inserted into the ground. And don’t forget to include a gate! Make the gate at
least 4 feet wide to accommodate you and your horse.
Sheltering your horse with a run-in shed
An old standby in the way of equine shelter is something called a run-in shed.
The run-in shed is a three-sided rectangular shelter with one open side that
offers the horse a place to get out of the rain, snow, wind, and hot sun.
You can buy a prefabricated run-in shed from a barn manufacturer (ask at
your local feed store for references of companies in your area) or build your
own from scratch using wood or corrugated metal. Make sure that the shed is
big enough to safely accommodate however many horses you keep together
in your pasture or paddock. Occasionally, members of the herd want to crowd
into the shed at the same time.
The best location for your run-in shed is the highest ground on your pasture
or paddock, with the opening of the shed facing away from the direction that
winter winds typically blow. Keep fresh bedding in your shed to make it com-
fortable for your horse (see the next section for bedding options), and clean
it every day.
150
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Housing your horse indoors
The majority of horse owners keep their horses in outdoor enclosures, but
some owners keep them inside, at least part of the time. Indoor accommo-
dations for horses nearly always consist of a box stall, which is just what it
sounds like: a stall in the shape of a box.
Keeping a horse in a box stall has a couple of advantages:
 Stall-kept horses stay cleaner and neater. They don’t end up muddy
when it rains, or dusty when it’s dry.
 Stall-kept horses avoid bites and other scars. Horses kept outdoors in
pastures or paddocks (which we cover earlier in this chapter) usually
suffer more from such maladies.
The downside of keeping a horse in a box stall is that it is less healthy for the
horse than living outdoors. A horse that stands in nearly the same place for
hours on end is more prone to colic, leg problems, and boredom, which often
results in stable vices (see Chapter 2). Because ventilation isn’t as good in a
stall as it is outdoors, stall-kept horses also are more prone to respiratory
disease.
If you choose to keep your horse in a box stall, make sure that the stall is at
least 12-by-12 feet in size, or larger if you can manage it. Provide the horse
with at least one window to see through to give him something to do and to
improve ventilation. House another horse next door to him for companion-
ship, if possible, and put a window between them so the horses can see each
other and interact.
If you have room on your property, attach a small outdoor paddock to the
stall so the horse can go outside whenever he wants. The stall’s design also
needs to allow for plenty of cross-ventilation without being drafty.
When it comes to designing and building a box stall, we recommend you pur-
chase a prefabricated box stall made from wood or aluminum from a barn
manufacturing company, or hire a well-recommended professional to design
and build the stall. Either of these methods ensures that your horse is housed
in a stall that is appropriate in size, design, and material.
Don’t forget to keep the stall floor covered with at least 8 inches of bedding
to protect the horse’s legs and resting body from the hard concrete floor.
Horses need bedding in their stalls or shelters to be comfortable. A thick
layer of bedding material protects their legs and joints from the hard ground
and their hooves from damaging moisture in wet weather. It also absorbs
urine and keeps ammonia fumes to a minimum if it’s cleaned frequently.
Plus, horses just love clean, fluffy bedding. Just watch them roll in it when
you first put it down. (You can also use a rubber stall mat to soften the floor-
ing for your horse.)
151
Chapter 7: Housing Your Horse Comfortably

You may find that buying one type of bedding over another is easier, depend-
ing on where you live. Stick with bedding that your horse seems less likely to
eat, because such a habit is neither healthy for the equine digestive system
nor your wallet. And make sure that whatever you use is specifically made with
horses in mind. Bedding is available at your local feed store. Some common
bedding options include:
 Paper: Recycled paper bedding, made from newsprint, is absorbent, soft,
and nearly dust-free. The downside of this bedding is that it can become
easily packed down by a horse that walks around a lot in his stall.
 Peat: Peat bedding is made from partially decomposed sphagnum moss
from wet bogs or peatlands. This type of bedding is known for being
very absorbent, taking in 10 times its weight in moisture and for neutral-
izing ammonia in the stall. Peat also composts easily, and doesn’t make
horses’ hooves dry the way some wood bedding can.
 Sawdust: Sawdust bedding is made from woods including pine, cedar,
and fir. It’s highly absorbent, easy to find, and economical. The downside
of sawdust is that it can cause respiratory problems in sensitive horses.
 Straw: Straw, sold in bales, isn’t as absorbent as wood shavings but is
less dusty, very soft, and warm. It is the bedding of choice for mares
with foals.
 Wood pellets: Pelleted wood is high in absorbency, readily available,
and easy to use. Pellet bedding is typically made from soft, nontoxic
woods like pine.
 Wood shavings: Wood shavings, available loose or packaged, offer a thick,
comfortable bed, and are easy to buy and store in bulk. The best wood
shavings for horses are made from pine and/or other wood mixtures.
Wood shavings made from black walnut are toxic to horses and must be
avoided for your horse’s health!
Clean the stall of manure and fouled bedding on a daily basis. You also need
to completely and thoroughly clean the stall by using a mild bleach and water
solution at least once every six months. See Chapter 8 for more details on
managing manure.
Making Room for Work and Play
Regardless of whether you board your equine buddy or keep him at home,
you still need to make sure that environment you provide for your horse
includes equipment that specifically makes caring for and riding your horse
safer and more enjoyable. If you plan to keep your horse at home and need
the following amenities installed, talk to a trainer or other equine expert for
advice on how to create your facilities.
152
Part II: Selecting a Horse and the Stuff that Goes with Him 

Storing your gear in a tack room
You need a place to keep your saddle, bridle, grooming tools, horse blanket,
and other items you use on or for your horse (see Chapter 6 for more about
equine gear). This storage place can be as luxurious as a shed equipped with
a saddle rack and pegs for your bridle and halter or as modest as a large trunk
that you store inside a barn or other weatherproof building.
If you plan to board your horse, find out whether you can rent a tack room
or locker for a fee or supply your own. If you’re keeping your horse at home,
take advantage of the fact that you own the property and erect the nicest
tack room that you can. A roomy, well-designed tack room can enhance your
enjoyment of your horse.
When designing your tack room, think bigger than merely housing the
amount of tack that you have at this point — you’ll probably want to grow
into it. Leave plenty of wall space for bridle racks, and don’t forget shelving
for items like shampoo, clippers, supplements, and other accessories.
If you don’t have the time, money, or inclination to build your own tack room,
you can purchase a prefabricated building for this purpose. A garden shed,
outdoor playhouse, or storage shed easily converts into a tack shed.
Staying safe in a spacious work area
Horses’ bodies take up a lot of room, so you need to have a decent amount of
space for grooming, bathing, and tacking up your horse regardless of whether
you board or keep your horse at home. Besides adequate space, your work
area needs:
 Crossties or hitching posts to secure your horse while you work on him
(see Chapter 13 for more about safe means of restraining a horse).
 A washrack with a cement floor and nearby crosstie or hitching post,
water spigot, and hose for bathing your horse.
The cement floor prevents your horse from having to stand in the mud.
 Tack storage (or full-sized tack room) situated nearby so you have easy
access to your equine tools and equipment.
A sheltered work area is preferable so you can attend to your horse even
during inclement weather. A roof over your work area not only protects
you and your horse from rain or snow, it also keeps you both out of the 
blistering sun.
A contractor can do the work of putting all this in for you.

Chapter 7: Housing Your Horse Comfortably

Sharpening your skills in a riding arena
Having a safe, enclosed place to ride is extremely important, especially if
you’re a beginning rider. In an arena, you can perfect your riding skills and
gain the confidence you need to take your horse anywhere beyond the stable.
Good riding arenas have well-constructed fencing at least 4 to 41⁄2 feet in height,
along with adequate footing to help cushion the shock to your horse’s legs as
you ride. Covered arenas are best because they shelter you and your horse
from the sun, rain, and snow as you ride.
If you plan to board, make sure that the facility you choose has at least one
good-sized, well-maintained arena. If the stable has more than one arena, all
the better! Multiple arenas mean you rarely have to ride in crowded conditions.
If you plan to keep your horse at home, consider building your own arena, if
you have the money and the room. Build the largest arena you can fit onto
your property, because the more room you have to ride, the happier you’ll be.
If space is limited, make your arena at least 60 by 100 feet in size, which gives
you the minimum amount of room you need to effectively ride your horse.
The type of fencing you use for your arena depends on your budget. Pipe
fencing is adequate, but wood and polyvinylchloride fencing are much more
attractive, albeit expensive. If you plan to turn your horse out in the arena,
you want to make the fence higher — at least 5 feet — to discourage him
from jumping out. For more fencing details see “Focusing on the right fenc-
ing” earlier in this chapter.
If you don’t have room for an arena on your property, find out whether the
neighborhood you live in has a community arena where you can ride. Ask
fellow horse owners — they know where the local arenas are situated.
Accessing trails for a fun time
Few things are as relaxing and soul-enhancing as a horseback ride on a wilder-
ness trail. The soothing feel of your horse’s rhythmic step and the singing of
the birds can melt away your stress.
If trail riding is an activity you want to enjoy with your horse, be sure to house
your horse at a stable that has access to plenty of equestrian trails. Or make
sure that trails are nearby when you consider keeping your horse at home.
Don’t put yourself into a situation in which you must travel on busy streets
via horseback for an extended amount of time before you reach a trailhead.
Horses and traffic don’t mix (ever see The Horse Whisperer?), so limiting the
amount of riding you do on major thoroughfares is wise.

 Feeding and watering your horse
 Managing your horse’s health and environment
O
wning a horse means caring for him every single day. You may find that
you actually look forward to the time you spend in the stable cleaning
up after your horse and tending to his needs. Or, you may think of it as noth-
ing more than a necessary chore. The truth of the matter is that regardless
of whether you feel like it, you have to do it, even on those days when rain is
falling like mad and the last thing you want to do is trudge through the mud
and muck to get to the barn.
As a horse owner with a horse on your own property, you must deal with
three major factors in your horse’s care: feeding, exercising, and managing
the horse’s environment. If you handle all of these areas properly, you not
only will be highly regarded by your neighbors and fellow horse owners, but
your horse will love you for it, too.
If you’re boarding your horse rather than keeping him on your own property,
don’t think that you’re completely off the hook. Making sure that your horse’s
boarding facility adheres to the standards we describe regarding feeding, water-
ing, and stable management is your responsibility. Although the boarding
stable does this part of the job, you still must provide the horse with daily
exercise and hands-on care.
Handling Your Horse’s Hunger and Thirst
Food is very important to a horse, probably even more important than it is to
humans. Nature designed the horse to spend the majority of his time chewing,
swallowing, and digesting. The equine digestive system is meant to be con-
stantly on the go and to process vast quantities of fibrous foods.
The following sections cover foods that your horse needs and different meth-
ods you can use to feed your horse properly.

Figuring out what to feed your horse
Much confusion exists in the horse world about the best food to feed a horse.
The reason for this confusion probably lies in the fact that individual horses
have different nutritional requirements. Factors in determining the best diet
for a horse include where and how the horse lives and what kind of work the
horse does in addition to the horse’s own physiological makeup.
The best person to guide you when it comes to your horse’s diet is your vet.
Your vet is familiar with your individual horse and his nutritional needs and
should also be up on the local availability of different kinds of hay. (See Chap-
ter 10 for more details on finding a vet.)
Here’s some general information on horse feeds to get you started. (All of
these feeds, with the exception of pasture grass, can be purchased at a local
feed store):
 Hay: Hay is a feedstuff composed of plants that have been cut, dried,
and baled. Bales of hay are available from feed stores. Two different
types of hays exist: legumes and grasses. Alfalfa is the legume horses
most commonly eat, but clover is another option, depending on where
you live. Timothy, orchard, and Bermuda are the most common grass
hays. Coastal, brome, fescue, oat, and rye are other grasses to try.
Hay is a good feed because it provides roughage in addition to proper
nutrition. The roughage keeps the horse’s digestive system working
properly and satisfies the horse’s natural urge to chew.
If you keep your horse stabled (instead of in a viable pasture), we recom-
mend feeding at least two to three flakes (a flake is a section of a bale of
hay, weighing around 4 pounds) of an alfalfa and grass hay mix (preferably
timothy, because this grass hay has higher nutritional qualities than other
commonly available grass hays) per day for a horse of average weight
(1,100 pounds) that gets at least 30 minutes of solid exercise, two to
three times per week. If an alfalfa/grass hay mix is not available, feed one
flake of alfalfa and one flake of grass per day. Provided your horse is an
average-sized adult on a moderate exercise program, either of these
types of hay should provide all of the energy and nutrients your horse
needs to maintain his normal body weight. If your horse has trouble
keeping weight on, provide two flakes of alfalfa and one flake of grass
each day. If your horse tends to be overweight, feed a little less alfalfa.
(Consult with your veterinarian about how much food your particular
horse should be receiving.)
Generally speaking, legumes such as alfalfa are the best feed for horses
that need to put on and maintain weight, and for horses that work on a
regular basis. Timothy and other grass hays are good for horses that
need to lose weight and don’t work as hard.
158
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

 Hay cubes: You can feed your horse concentrated blocks of hay called
hay cubes. Hay cubes tend to be cheaper than hay and are good for:
• Older horses with worn-down teeth because cubes break apart
quickly when chewed.
• Horses with respiratory problems because cubes are less dusty
than regular hay.
• Horses that have trouble keeping on weight.
However, most horses prefer baled hay to cubes because baled hay sat-
isfies their need to chew.
 Pellets: Another form of concentrated feed is pellets made from alfalfa.
Pellets are even cheaper than hay cubes, but they’re not at the top of
our list of recommended feeds unless you have a horse that has respira-
tory problems or trouble keeping on weight. Horses can easily choke on
pellets, and pellets provide little in the way of chewing satisfaction for
the horse. Pellets can make a good supplement to a diet consisting pri-
marily of hay, however.
 Pasture: Horses do best when they can graze in a pasture because grazing
is most natural for them; however, providing your horse with lush pas-
ture requires work and knowledge. If you live on property where pasture
has already been cultivated, your task is to carefully maintain it. If you
want to start a pasture from scratch, you need help. Contact your local
agricultural agency for assistance in starting and maintaining a quality
horse pasture. You can find this government agency in your telephone
directory. (Check out Chapter 7 for more tips on setting up and main-
taining a pasture at home.)
You can grow a number of different kinds of pasture grasses for equine
consumption. Timothy, bromegrass, fescue, bluegrass, and orchard
grass are among the types that horses enjoy. Talk to your veterinarian
about which of the grasses that grow in your area best suit your horse.
Do not graze a pregnant mare on fescue, because doing so can cause the
mare to spontaneously abort the foal.
Horses need to be started gradually on pasture grass so it doesn’t upset
their digestive systems. Allow only an hour of grazing per day for sev-
eral days, and then increase to two hours, and so on.
If your pasture doesn’t yield a substantial amount of good-quality, nutri-
tious grass, supplement your horse’s diet with a daily ration of hay. If
you don’t, the horse may suffer from malnutrition. To verify that your
pasture is of good quality, call your local agricultural office and ask an
expert to inspect your pasture and help analyze its nutritional content.
Pay attention to weed control. Any number of toxic plants can invade your
pasture, causing liver disease, and neurological disorders. Contact your
agricultural office for a list of plants in your region that are toxic to horses.

Chapter 8: Establishing an Everyday Routine

 Grain: When it comes to horse food, people often think of grain as a
staple of the equine diet. However, if your horse is receiving only moder-
ate exercise, he probably doesn’t need any grain. Grain is a high-energy
carbohydrate that does wonders for racehorses and other serious
equine athletes but usually does little for the average horse other than
leave him with too much energy. One exception to this rule is a horse
pastured in extremely cold weather that needs the extra source of
energy to stay warm.
If you want to give your horse an occasional treat of grain, do so in mod-
eration, maybe a small amount once or twice a week. Oats, barley, corn,
or a combination of these with molasses are healthy grains that you can
feed every so often in small amounts. A serving of one or two cups of
grain makes a nice snack for your horse.
 Bran: Horse people love to give their horses warm bran mashes, and
horses love eating them. Just remember not to give your horse too much
too often (not more than once a week at the most). To feed bran (which
you can buy in your local feed store, by the way), use a bucket to mix four
to five cups of bran with some chopped up carrots or apples, and a small
amount of grain. Add enough warm water to make the bran wet but not
soupy. (Many people give their horses a bran mash before a long trailer
ride to prevent colic.)
 Commercial feeds: Horse owners have access to good-quality commer-
cial horse feeds. Available in tack stores, these pelleted feeds range from
simple mixes like alfalfa and molasses (great for mixing with vitamins,
supplements, and medications) to complex extruded feeds, which get their
name from the way they’re made (many extruded feeds are designed for
older horses, very active horses, horses with trouble keeping on weight,
and young horses).
We’re big advocates of complex extruded feeds in place of grain because
they’re designed specifically with horses in mind and balanced with vita-
mins, minerals, carbohydrates, and fats. Talk to your veterinarian to find
out whether your horse may benefit from a commercial feed.
 Treats: Few things rate as high on a horse’s list as treats. All kinds of
commercial horse treats are available at your local tack store. Or you can
stick with two old favorites: carrots and red apples cut up in small pieces
to prevent choking (especially important with ponies). The proverbial
lump of sugar is okay only once in a while — it provides absolutely no
nutritional value and isn’t very good for the horse. (You can give healthy
treats to your horse as often as you like.)
 Fat: Horses tend to get very little fat in their diets, even though this
nutrient is required for basic equine function. If your horse is worked
consistently and has trouble maintaining his weight, give him one cup of
vegetable oil daily, mixed in with the grain or other supplemental feed
(an alfalfa and molasses mix called A & M is good for this). If your horse
tends to be overweight, reduce the oil to half a cup.
160
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

 Vitamins: Horses need plenty of vitamins and minerals for good health.
Many small problems ranging from lameness to colic to infection can
result from vitamin and mineral deficiencies. We recommend that you
give your horse a dose of equine multivitamin supplement every day or
every other day. Talk to your vet about what your horse’s individual vit-
amin needs may be.
 Minerals: Provide your horse with access to a mineral salt block in his
feeder or paddock. Mineral salt blocks are available at your local feed
store. Your horse will lick the block to obtain salt and other minerals
he needs.
The quality of what you feed is just as important as the feed itself. If you buy
cheap, poor-quality hay, your horse will suffer for it. Don’t scrimp on this most
important aspect of your horse’s care.
Look for the following factors in any hay you buy to ensure its quality:
 Plenty of leaves or blades: Make sure that 60 percent or more of the hay
consists of leaves or blades as opposed to stems. Leaves and blades con-
tain most of the hay’s nutrients.
 Good scent: Good quality hay has a pleasant smell. Moldy hay has a foul
odor and needs to be avoided at all costs. Dusty hay should be avoided.
 Purity: The bale needs to contain only hay. That means no sticks, dirt,
weeds, rope, or other foreign objects.
Knowing how to feed your horse
Although feeding your horse only once a day would be easier for you, a horse’s
digestive system isn’t meant to handle only one large meal. Small, frequent
meals are the way to go when feeding horses. Provide a minimum of two feed-
ings of hay per day. Most horse owners feed once in the morning and once at
night. Feed three times a day if you can but only if you can do so consistently.
We discuss different feeding ideas to consider in the following sections.
Using a feeder for meals
Always feed your horse out of a feeder. The feeder can be something as simple
as a plastic barrel with a side cut out, or a commercial hayrack purchased at
a feed store.
The purpose of a feeder is to keep your horse from eating directly off the
ground. A horse that eats off the ground can easily ingest sand with the feed,
resulting in colic or poor absorption of food.
161
Chapter 8: Establishing an Everyday Routine

If you decide to feed your horse grain or a commercial feed, provide it to
your horse in a shallow bucket or rubber pan. Many commercial feeders
are designed so you simply dump the grain or feed directly into them.
Switching feed slowly
If your horse is eating a particular kind of hay or grain and you’d like to change
him over to something different because of a change in availability or as result
of directions from your vet, be sure to do so very gradually. Sudden, abrupt
changes in feed can result in a very sick horse.
By gradually we mean over a period of two weeks. Add 1⁄4 of the new hay to
the feed the first few days, and then switch over to 1⁄2 for a few more days.
Go to 3⁄4 new hay at the beginning of the second week, and change over com-
pletely to the new hay toward the end of that second week.
Feeding treats by hand or by feeder
People are divided when it comes to how to feed their horses treats. Some
swear that feeding treats from your hand causes a horse to become bratty
and obnoxious. Other people find that their horses don’t misbehave when
treats are handfed; they believe that feeding by hand helps foster the bond
between horse and human.
Here’s our position: If your horse acts like a spoiled kid when you hand feed
treats to him (starts pushing and crowding you, demanding that you hand
over all the goods), then your horse is not a candidate for hand feeding. We
also recommend against hand feeding whenever you plan to show your horse
at halter or another event where the horse needs to behave perfectly when
standing at your side. In these cases, give your horse his treats in a bucket or
in his feeder.
On the other hand, if your horse is gentle soul who politely waits for you to
hand over delectables and doesn’t have a job that requires him to behave a
certain way, you can go ahead and feed your horse by hand.
Watering your thirsty horse
We can’t overemphasize the importance of providing plenty of water as part
your horse’s daily care. Your horse needs water — lots of it — to stay alive
and to ensure a healthy digestive system. (The average horses drinks 8 to
14 gallons a day, and that’s with minimal exercise.) That’s why it’s vitally
important that your horse have constant access to clean, fresh H2O at all
times.
A few of the different ways that horse owners can provide water include:
162
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

 Installing an automatic waterer that automatically refills by using a float
system whenever the horse drinks from it (available from feed stores or
through equine product catalogs).
 Manually filling a large watering trough (available at feed stores) whenever
necessary. If you opt for this method, you have to be diligent in keeping
the trough full. The benefit of this approach is that you always know how
much water your horse is drinking, which can be valuable information
when your horse is feeling under the weather (your vet will need to know).
In either case, keep the waterer clean and free of algae and other debris.
You’ll know when your water needs a good scrubbing because it will turn
green from algae or you’ll see hay and other stuff floating on the top.
If you live in a climate where temperatures fall below freezing, you also need
to keep your horse’s water supply from turning to ice. You can do so with a
heating element made especially for horse waterers (available at your local
feed store), or by manually breaking the ice whenever it forms. We recommend
the heating element because it requires less work on your part and keeps the
water at a warmer temperature, which encourages your horse to drink it.
Taking Care of Other Maintenance Tasks
Daily horsekeeping requires more than just feeding and watering. You also
have to keep a close eye on your charge, exercise the critter, clean up after
him, and work at keeping pests at bay. All these things are an integral part of
maintaining a horse.
163
Chapter 8: Establishing an Everyday Routine
A word about turning out
Taking a stabled horse and giving it turn-out time,
where it can exercise on its own in an arena, is a
common practice in the horse world. Advocates
of this practice see it as a way for a confined
horse to expend some of his pent-up energy by
bucking, rearing, running, rolling, and basically
just being a horse.
Although turn-out time sounds good in theory,
we’ve seen plenty of problems arise from this
practice. Leg injuries, like bowed tendons and
even irreparable fractures, often occur during
turnouts. The reason is that horses that are
cooped up all day tend to go berserk during turn-
out time and end up hurting themselves.
If you need to turn a horse out for behavioral
reasons, or want to turn him out so he can roll
(rolling is good for horses because it helps them
stretch out their spine and back muscles), warm
him up first with a 5- to 10-minute walk, dress
him with protective legwear, and turn him out
alone (instead of with another horse).

Giving your horse the once over
Horses may seem like rather independent creatures, but in reality, they’re more
like half-ton toddlers. They easily get themselves into trouble and sometimes
develop problems through no fault of their own.
That’s why your horse needs what we like to call the daily once over. Every day,
you must take your horse out of his stall or pasture and examine him from head
to toe. This task is easier to do when you are grooming, because grooming
calls for close contact between your hands and eyes and the horse’s body.
Plus, grooming usually is enjoyable for the horse and helps the two of you
bond. (Check out Chapter 9 for the complete scoop on grooming.)
As you go over your horse, check for the following signs of trouble:
 Lumps or bumps
 Scabs or hair loss
 Swellings or hot spots, especially around backs of pasterns, lower legs,
and tendon areas (see Chapter 2)
 Rocks in hooves
 Discharge from eyes or nose; swollen or squinty eyes
 Foul smells, especially in the nose and mouth areas
 Limping, or walking stiffly
 Lack of appetite, depression, unresponsiveness, or sleepiness
For more information about what to do when you discover a problem during
your daily once over, see Chapter 11.
Exercising your horse for optimum health
Stabled horses need daily exercise to keep their minds and bodies in good
working order. Pastured horses don’t need as much exercise as their stabled
counterparts, but they still require time under saddle if they are to stay in
good physical shape.
Give your horse a minimum of 30 minutes of exercise per day — more if you
have the time (although don’t overdo it if your horse isn’t used to a lot of work).
If you don’t have time to tack up and ride, you need to at least take the horse
out and walk him for half an hour. On the other hand, 30 minutes of just walk-
ing every day isn’t enough exercise for the average horse, so you have to find
time to give your equine buddy a good work out at least a few days a week. If
you don’t, your horse will start getting a bit crazy from all that pent-up energy,
and you’ll pay for it with misbehavior on the rare days when you do ride.
164
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Although riding is the best way to exercise your horse, you can also vary the
routine by occasionally longeing, or exercising him on a rope (see Chapter 13
for information on longeing). Don’t overdo the longeing, however. Too much
of it can put severe stress on your horse’s legs and result in lameness.
Managing manure
One of the least fun things about owning a horse is cleaning up after him.
Horses are virtual poop machines that never seem to stop evacuating their
bowels. Of course if your horse is producing plenty of waste, that means his
digestive system is in good working order. Try keeping that happy thought in
mind every time you pick up your shovel.
Manure is not the only waste product your horse produces. Horses also elimi-
nate several gallons of urine per day, creating soiled bedding to clean up.
We can give you a slew of really good reasons to pick up after your horse on a
daily basis, regardless of whether he is pastured or stabled. Here are some of
the biggies:
 Your property begins to smell pretty bad if you let manure and urine-
soaked bedding pile up.
 Your horse’s health suffers if he is forced to stand in his own waste.
 The accumulated manure and urine provide a breeding ground for bacte-
ria, flies, and internal parasites (covered in the next section).
 You can get in trouble with your neighbors and the law if you don’t
clean up.
Scooping manure is really not a difficult job to perform, provided you’re in
decent physical shape and have a reasonably healthy back. All you need to
do is scoop the poop into a wheelbarrow by using a manure fork, a wonderful
invention that separates the manure balls from the dirt or bedding (it’s avail-
able at feed stores). Some folks prefer to use a shovel.
Cleaning urine-soaked bedding is a little more difficult, although the shavings,
straw, or whatever you chose for your horse’s bed sticks together when it’s
wet and so isn’t that hard to remove. You can use your manure fork for this
part of the job or a shovel, being careful not to take too much clean bedding
with you as you scoop. Remember to replace the removed bedding with clean,
fresh stuff when you’re done. (Chapter 7 has more details on bedding.)
You can dispose of the gathered waste by either dumping it in a trash recep-
tacle for pick up or keeping it to compost. Whatever you do, be sure to follow
the regulations in your municipality regarding equine waste disposal. If you
aren’t sure what those rules are, contact your county or city government for
information.
165
Chapter 8: Establishing an Everyday Routine

If you want to compost your horse’s manure and soiled bedding to use in your
garden or to spread on the surface of a riding arena, make sure that you age
the waste for at least eight weeks. We also suggest that you get a good book
on composting so you can find out all about this method of waste disposal.
Keep a close eye on your manure pile. Compost piles filled with manure have
been known to catch fire as a result of internal combustion caused by the
heat of decay.
Controlling pests
Where you find horses, you also find bugs. Flies, gnats, and intestinal worms
tend to congregate at stables, dining on the horses and making their lives a
living hell. These pests are a cold, harsh reality of the horse world, and all
owners can do is try their darnedest to control them.
If you follow the instructions regarding waste control in the previous section,
you’ll already be doing a great deal to control pests in your horse’s environ-
ment. Many species of flies and intestinal parasites need access to horse
manure to complete their life cycles. So, if you get rid of the manure quickly,
the pests can’t reproduce. This factor is especially true of internal parasites,
many of which reinfect a horse when it accidentally ingests larvae in his 
environment.
In addition to diligent waste removal, you can control flies by
 Hanging fly strips or traps around the barn. These products are good
for snagging flies.
 Purchasing biological controls from companies that specialize in this
aspect of pest control. A tiny species of predatory wasp in the Chalcididae
family that feeds on fly larvae is a popular choice among horse owners.
(This wasp is barely noticeable in the environment and won’t bother you
or your horse.)
 Applying fly sprays or wipes to your horse daily. Also, consider
installing an automated insecticide system in your barn.
 Dressing your horse in a fly mask, fly sheet, and special fly-screen leg
wraps to keep flies from biting him (see Chapter 6).
The bad news is that you can never completely eliminate flies from a horse’s
environment. The good news is that, with hard work, you can keep their
pesky numbers in check.

 Bathing your horse beautifully

F
ew things make a horse lover happier than being up on a horse that looks
really good. Mane and tail flowing, coat glowing — you’ll feel proud pass-
ing other riders on the trail as you sit astride such a glamorous beast.
Of course, your trusty steed isn’t going to come out of the pasture looking so
great — you have to make it happen. Although cleaning up a half-ton animal
after he’s been milling around in the dirt for days may not sound like a picnic,
we consider grooming is one of the most enjoyable parts of horse ownership.
And besides, most horses absolutely love the attention.
If you groom your horse every time you take him out for a ride, the effects
are cumulative. His coat shines more every day; his tail is silkier. He looks
pretty darn good, even when he’s just standing there eating in his stall, pro-
vided he hasn’t just rolled in the mud, that is. In this chapter, we give you the
essential information for making your horse look his best.
Getting Down to Business: 
Grooming Basics
Take a look in any tack store or equine supply catalog and you’ll see oodles
of grooming tools for sale. That’s because grooming is an important activity

in the horse world. You’ll soon discover just how important it is after you
spend more and more time around horses. But for now, several of the really
good reasons for grooming your horse on a regular basis are that it
 Removes sweat and dirt from your horse’s coat, helping keep his skin
healthy.
 Prevents chafing and skin irritation by removing dirt, burrs, and other
material before you put on the tack.
 Gives you a chance to inspect your horse for any unusual lumps, bumps,
or blemishes. You’re more likely to notice changes or problems as they
arise if you’re familiar with your horse’s body.
 Helps build that all-important bond between you and your horse.
 Gives your horse the attention on which he thrives.
 Earns the high regard of other horse people, who will respect and
admire your dedication to your horse.
 Helps you (and your horse) relax, and reduces the daily stress in both
your lives.
 Makes your horse look handsome and well cared for.
If you’re still not convinced that you need to take time out as often as you can
to groom your horse, then hear this: Regular grooming is important to your
horse’s health and welfare, and it’s a requirement of every horse owner, pure
and simple.
Grooming your horse isn’t hard. In fact, it’s one of the easiest and most enjoy-
able aspects of horsemanship, and it needs to be done as often as possible.
The optimum schedule is to groom your horse once a day. If you can’t spruce
him up every day, grooming your horse before and after you ride him is imper-
ative. When you groom after you ride, make sure that the horse is completely
cooled down (no longer hot and wet); trying to groom a sweaty coat is aggra-
vating and nearly impossible.
With only slight variations for personal style and preference, horse people
around the world use the grooming procedures described in the following
sections. If you hope to fit in with the horsy set, you must practice proper
grooming procedures and protocols. After becoming familiar with the
basics, you can vary the steps to suit your own personality. For example,
some people prefer to clean the hooves before grooming the body, and
others tend to the horse’s head only after taking care of every other part of
his anatomy.
168
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Starting with the right tools and setup
The first thing you need to do is assemble all of your grooming tools in a tack
box or organizer. Make sure that everything is clean and in good working order.
At a minimum, your tools need to include the following items:
 Rubber currycomb
 Stiff brush
 Soft brush
 Shedding blade
 Cloth (any old soft, clean rag will do)
 Mane and tail brush
 Hoof pick
 Hoof brush
You can find descriptions of these items and their uses in Chapter 6.
After you organize your tools, put a halter and lead rope on your horse, and
lead him to a roomy area in the stable where you can tie him securely, either
in crossties or at a post.
Never try to groom a horse that is loose in a stall or pasture. When the weather is
inclement, you also want to find a spot to shelter you and your horse from wind
and wetness. (Directions for leading and tying up your horse are in Chapter 13.)
Working the body
Start with the biggest part of the horse: his body. The body includes the
head, neck, legs, rump, and everything in between.
Everyone knows that horses are covered in hair, but unless you’ve spent some
time around horses, you may not realize that a horse’s hair is a trap for every
speck of dirt, mud, and dust that he comes into contact with. Your job as a
groomer is to get as much of that grunge off the horse’s coat as you can, expos-
ing the clean-looking, shimmering coat beneath.
If your horse is stabled indoors all the time, the amount of dirt in his coat will
be minimal. Horses that live in pastures or paddocks, however, usually require
a bit of elbow grease to get them clean.

Chapter 9: Keeping Your Horse Clean and Pretty

Use a rubber currycomb, stiff brush, soft brush, and cloth to clean the body
of your horse. With these tools at your disposal, follow these steps:
1. Use the currycomb to bring the dirt to the surface of the coat by rub-
bing in a circular motion. (If your horse has a thin coat, proceed gently
or skip this step altogether.)
Start on your horse’s left side with your currycomb in your right hand
(although if you are left-handed, you’ll probably be more comfortable hold-
ing the comb in your left hand). Begin rubbing at the end of your horse’s
neck (where it joins the head) and work down toward the horse’s body.
(See Figure 9-1 for the correct way to stand and groom.) The order in which
to groom is: neck, chest, shoulders, back, belly, rump, and haunches.
Be gentle when working around the horse’s flanks and underbelly. Some
horses are sensitive in these areas and may kick out at you.
If mud is caked on the horse’s legs, use a gentle circular motion to shake
it loose. Do so only with dry mud; wet mud is impossible to remove.
After finishing the left side, move over to the right side, switching the
currycomb to your left hand and repeating the process. If your horse is
the least bit dirty — and we’re sure he is — the dust comes to the sur-
face of his coat.
2. Use the stiff brush to dissipate the dirt into the air by brushing in short
strokes in the direction of the coat. Again, start on the horse’s left side
with the stiff brush in your right hand (or left hand, if you are a lefty)
and start at the top of the neck, moving down the horse’s neck, to his
chest, shoulder, back, barrel, belly, rump, and haunches. You can also
use the stiff brush to loosen the dirt from your horse’s legs, but you
need to be gentle.
After finishing the left side of the horse, move over to the right side and
repeat the process with the stiff brush in your left hand.
3. Use the soft brush to remove the remaining dust from the coat, brush-
ing along the lay of the coat by using short strokes. Again, start on the
horse’s left with the brush in your right hand (or left, if you prefer) and
move from the horse’s neck, to his chest, shoulder, back, barrel, belly,
rump, and haunches. Move to the right side of the horse with the brush
in your left hand, and repeat the brushing process. You should begin to
see a shine on your horse’s coat.
As you brush your horse with the stiff and soft brushes, clean the brushes
continually by rubbing them against the rubber currycomb. Doing so helps
to get rid of the dust that has accumulated in the brushes and keeps the
dirt from going back on the horse.
4. Complete the body-grooming process by wiping down the horse’s
body with the cloth. This step gives the coat even more shine and
removes any dirt and dust you may have missed.
170
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

5. Use the cloth to clean out the insides of your horse’s nostrils, where
dirt and mucus tend to accumulate.
6. Use the soft brush to gently groom your horse’s head with long, soft
strokes. Stand at the side and in front of your horse to do this step.
Although most horses enjoy having their heads groomed, some don’t.
Be sure to calmly approach your horse’s head with the brush, showing it
to him and letting him smell it before you use it on his head. Be careful
when brushing his ears because some horses are funny about having
their ears touched. If your horse objects to having his ears brushed, try
grooming them with a soft towel.
When your horse is shedding (something that occurs in early spring), you
can use your shedding blade to remove the loose hair from the coat. Use the
blade before you groom, starting on the left side of the horse, moving down
the body, and then starting again on the right.
Shedding blades work best on horses with thick winter coats. If your horse
has a thin winter coat and is shedding only minimally, you can use a shedding
stone or metal currycomb to remove the excess hair.
Use care and caution whenever you use the shedding blade. The sharp teeth
on this tool can injure your horse’s skin. Apply only minimal pressure, and
never use this tool on your horse’s legs.

Chapter 9: Keeping Your Horse Clean and Pretty

Managing the mane and tail
Your horse’s mane and tail are made up of hair not unlike human hair. And as
with human hair, regular cleaning and brushing helps keep it looking luxurious.
You need the soft brush and the mane and tail brush to tend to your horse’s
mane and tail whenever you’re grooming him. You may also want to use a
mane-and-tail detangling solution — the kind you apply when the mane and
tail are dry, not wet.
Follow these steps for grooming your horse’s mane and tail:
1. Using your fingers, pick out any shavings, burrs, or other foreign mate-
rial lodged in the mane, tail, or forelock. The forelock is the area of the
mane that hangs between the horse’s ears and down onto his forehead.
2. Separate tangles in the mane and tail with your fingers, if you can. If the
hair is badly tangled, use dry-detangling solution (available in tack stores).
Put some of the detangler in the palm of your hand and work it into the
mane and tail for later combing.
3. Using your soft brush, groom the base of the horse’s tail, where the
hairs are short. Try to reach the skin when you do this step, because
brushing helps stimulate the circulation.
4. Using the soft brush, groom the base of the mane, where it joins the crest
of the neck. Again, let the brush reach the skin to help with circulation.
5. Using the mane and tail brush, brush out the hair of the mane and
tail, gently removing any tangles with your fingers first, until you get
a silky look.
Attending to the hooves
The health of your horse’s hooves is extremely important, and you should try
to clean them daily, if possible. Hooves that are not cleaned regularly can
develop thrush (a fungal disease), stone bruises (sore spots on the bottom
of the hoof), and other problems. (See Chapter 11 for more information on
maladies that can affect the hoof.)
You need a hoof pick and hoof brush to properly clean your horse’s hooves,
and your horse needs to be securely tied to a hitching post or crossties.
Picking up the feet
Before you can clean your horse’s hooves, you have to be able to pick up his
feet. Standing on the left side of your horse, facing toward the horse’s back
end, bend down and run your left hand along your horse’s left front leg, start-
ing above the knee and moving down toward the pastern (ankle). Some horses
172
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

pick up their feet for you automatically. If yours doesn’t, lean your shoulder
against your horse’s shoulder to shift his weight to the opposite leg, and
squeeze the back of the leg you’re hoping to lift. The horse should then pick
up his foot, enabling you to cradle the left hoof with your hand. Be sure to
bend the leg back at its natural angle and not off to the side. Support this
uplifted foot in your hand and begin cleaning.
Some horses are trained to pick up their feet if you gently squeeze the horny
growth on the inside of their elbows and hocks called the chestnut. Give this a
try if you’re having trouble getting a new horse to lift his feet.
Cleaning the hooves
To clean out the inside of the uplifted hoof, take the pick in your right hand,
with the handle in your fist and the point of the pick facing away from you.
Stand at the horse’s left side at his shoulder, looking toward the back of the
horse. You’ll know you’re in the right position if your left shoulder is next to
your horse’s left shoulder. Ask your horse for his hoof (see the previous sec-
tion), and then support this uplifted foot in your left hand and start scraping
out the dirt with the tip of the hoof pick. (Figure 9-2 shows the correct way to
hold the hoof and the hoof pick.) Be sure to clean out the areas around the frog
(the triangular area on the underside of the hoof), but don’t scrape the frog
itself. Look for rocks, nails, or other items that may be lodged around the frog.
Get to know the anatomy of a horse’s foot so you can scrape in just the right
areas. See Chapter 2 for details on what the underside of the hoof looks like
under all that dirt.
After you dig out the dirt and debris from the hoof, use your hoof brush to wipe
away any excess dirt in the foot. You get a good view of the foot after you do
this, so you can spot any stones or other objects that may be lodged inside.
Figure 9-2:
Support
your horse’s
hoof in one
hand as you

pick in your
other hand.
173
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Horse Clean and Pretty

When you’re satisfied that that first hoof is clean, move to the hind leg on
the same (left) side. Facing the back of the horse, again run your hand
down the horse’s leg and lift the foot off the ground. If the horse doesn’t lift
his foot right away, push gently on his thigh so he shifts his weight to the
other leg.
After you finish the hooves on the left side, move over to the right. Don’t start
with the front leg on the right side, though. Tradition dictates that you move
from the left foreleg to the left hind leg to the right hind leg, then to the right
foreleg. Face the back of the horse with your shoulder to horse’s right shoul-
der, and lift the horse’s right leg with your right hand. The hoof pick should
be in your left.
After you clean out each hoof, use your hoof brush to clean off any dirt cling-
ing to the outside of the hoof. If the outside of your horse’s hooves are caked
with dirt, you can also use the brush to clean them off.
174
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 
Managing the mane with a pull
Some horse owners like their horses to have long,
flowing manes. Others prefer a shorter, thinner
look. In fact, people who show their horses in
western rail classes — such as western pleasure,
equitation, trail, and horsemanship — must keep
their horse’s manes short and trim. The same
goes for those who show in English events like
dressage and hunt seat, where manes are often
braided for competition and need to be kept
short and manageable.
Keeping your horse’s mane short and thinned out
is not as simple as you may think. You can’t just
take a pair of scissors and cut it. If you do, it will
look thick and chopped up. Instead, what you
need to do is pull the mane, using a mane comb.
Here is how you pull a horse’s mane:
1. Shift the horse’s clean, dry mane, to one side
of the horse’s neck. Stand next to the horse
on the side where his mane hangs down.
2. Beginning at the center of the horse’s neck,
hold your mane comb in your right hand and
take a 1-inch wide section of mane in your
left hand, between your forefinger and your
thumb.
3. Stretch down the mane hairs you’re holding.
Then, using the same fingers with which
you’re holding the hairs, push up some of the
hairs that you are holding. This leaves you
with several hairs still between your fingers.
4. Wrap these remaining hairs in the metal
mane comb and yank down in a short, quick
pull to remove some of the longer hairs,
leaving shorter mane behind.
5. Perform this step repeatedly over the length
of the entire mane until you have a nice,
neat look.
If you use short quick pulls, mane pulling
shouldn’t bother your horse. If it does, ask an
experienced horse person to help you get the
hang of it. If your horse is extremely sensitive
when it comes to having his mane pulled, you may
have to have a veterinarian come out and give
the horse a sedative before you can proceed.

Taking action when your horse refuses to lift its feet
Some horses simply won’t lift their feet when you try to clean out their
hooves. Among the different reasons for this problem are
 A lack of training — horses have to be taught to have their feet handled
at a young age.
 A lack of balance — horses have to learn to stand on three feet.
 A prior bad experience — a horse may have fallen when having his feet
worked on or may experience pain or discomfort in one of his legs.
If your horse refuses to lift his feet for cleaning or for the farrier (a specialist in
trimming and shoeing horse hooves), have him examined by a veterinarian to
make sure he isn’t experiencing pain in one or more legs. Doing so is especially
important whenever you have an older horse that is stiff when he moves or is
somehow lame.
If your horse is sound and still won’t lift his feet, he needs to be trained how
to have his feet handled. Calling in a patient, gentle, experienced trainer or
horse person is best for solving a foot-lifting problem, as opposed to trying to
deal with it yourself.
Sticking to safety rules
Although grooming is a relaxing activity for you and your horse, you don’t
want you to get too comfortable while doing it. Remember these safety tips
when you’re working on and around your horse:
 Never duck under your horse’s neck or belly. If you want to get from
one side of the horse to the other, walk around.
 Never stand directly behind your horse when grooming him. Stand off
to the side in case he decides to kick.
 Never kneel down or sit while you’re working on your horse’s legs.
Stay in a bending or squatting position so you can move out of the way
quickly if necessary.
 Never stand directly in front of your horse’s legs when grooming. Stay
to the side of the legs to avoid being struck if the horse moves forward
or strikes out.
 Never groom a horse that is loose in a stall or pasture. Always make
sure that the horse is correctly secured before you begin grooming.
 Never assume that a strange horse is open to grooming. When groom-
ing a new horse, use caution, especially when brushing the flanks and
underbelly.

Scrub-a-Dub: Bathing Your Horse
Bathing a horse isn’t that much different from washing a car, except that with
a horse, you don’t need to wax. Both objects are large, however, and require
plenty of soap, water, and elbow grease.
You can choose any number of ways to bathe your horse, but we show you
one of the fastest and easiest methods in this section.
Knowing why and when horses need baths
Why wash a horse? In nature, horses don’t get baths. In fact, the only time
wild horses ever get wet is during a rainstorm.
Captivity is essentially the main reason for washing horses. Humans like to be
around clean horses, and most horse owners see their horses as extensions of
themselves and want their equine companions to look just as good as they do.
Likewise, the fact that humans take pleasure in riding horses, more or less
demands that we keep them clean. A dirty horse is prone for trouble after
tack is placed on his body. Sweat and dirt underneath a saddle and girth can
cause chafing, itching, and sheer misery. Tack also is a breeding ground for
fungus that can infect your horse’s skin.
No firm rule exists for determining when and how often to bathe your horse.
Some horse owners bathe their horses once a month like clockwork; others
do it just before a show. Some people wait until the horse is really, really dirty.
Still others, by necessity, wait until the weather warms up or simply until they
have time to do it.
How often you bathe your horse depends on several factors, including:
 How dirty your horse is
 The purpose for which you’re using your horse
Because they’re graded on their looks, show horses get more baths than non-
competitive equines. On the other hand, bathing a horse too often isn’t good
because the shampoo can strip natural oils from the horse’s skin and coat.
If your horse works hard and gets dirty and sweaty often, you can simply opt to
rinse him all over with clear water, without the shampoo. Clear water doesn’t
hurt him and keeps his skin and coat free of irritating debris.
176
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Because horses live outside, check out the weather forecast before you give
your horse a bath. If you live in a cold climate, for example, and it’s the dead
of winter, bathe your horse only if you can provide him with warm water and
a place to wash and dry him that is warm and free of drafts. Otherwise, only
sunny warm days are good days for a bath.
Making preparations to bathe your horse
Don’t start washing that horse unless you’re prepared. Consider the 
following:
 Be sure that your horse is amenable to being washed. If you can, find out
the horse’s history with bathing. Short of that, you can try bringing him
into the washrack with the help of another person and watch his reaction
carefully as you administer the bath. Most horses are fine when tied in
a washrack (a place made especially for bathing horses, complete with
asphalt or concrete flooring and hitches for tying the horse) and when
hosed or sponged down with water. However, until you know for sure
that your horse won’t panic in the confines of a washrack or freak out at
the sight of a garden hose, hold off on the bath.
 Make sure that you have enough time to do the job right before you get
started. Washing a horse is a big chore. It takes at least 20 minutes, maybe
more, to thoroughly wash and rinse a horse and another 30 to 45 minutes
to get him dry, depending on the weather.
 Have a good place to bathe your horse. Use a specially designed washrack,
or a roomy, hard-floored area where you can securely tie the horse to a
hitching post or crossties (see Chapter 13 for information about tying
your horse).
 Use a nylon halter and lead rope if you can. Nylon halters and lead ropes
can best withstand the rigors of being soaked with water.
 Make sure you have access to running water. Garden hoses are the
most convenient way of bringing water from the faucet directly to
your horse’s body.
 Have at least 72 gallons of lukewarm water on hand. If you don’t have
access to running water, warm the water in buckets using an electrical
device called a bucket warmer, available in tack and feed stores.
 Wear clothes and shoes that you don’t mind getting wet: Bathing a horse
is messy business (see Chapter 6 for more about proper footwear).
177
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Horse Clean and Pretty

Having the right tools on hand
Assemble your bathing tools before you bring your horse to the washing
area. You need to have the following on hand:
 Shampoo: Plenty of equine shampoos are available at tack and feed
stores. You can also use human shampoo on your horse if you prefer.
(Some humans prefer to use horse shampoo on their own hair instead
of human shampoo, in an attempt to have full and glossy manes.)
 Conditioner: Some equine (and human) shampoos have a conditioner
built in. Or, you can add one later as a second step. Other horse owners
use conditioner only on the horse’s mane and tail. This decision is strictly
a matter of personal preference.
 Body sponge: For sale in tack and feed stores, body sponges are large
sponges that are good for working the shampoo into your horse’s coat.
 Face sponge: You use this sponge, usually a natural sea sponge, to clean
delicate areas of your horse’s face.
 Sweat scraper: The sweat scraper is great for removing excess water
from your horse’s coat after the bath.
178
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 
Making your equine’s locks more luxurious
Soft, silky manes and tails are both made and
born. Although Mother Nature certainly has
much to do with the quality and texture of your
horse’s lovely locks, you can do plenty to enhance
what’s already there, such as:
 Keeping it clean.Washing your horse’s mane
and tail once a month or so with a good
shampoo keeps them looking really good
and prevents them from getting dirty, sticky,
and stringy. Use a gentle shampoo, one
made especially for horses.
 Condition, condition, condition. If you put a
really good made-for-equines conditioner on
your horse’s mane and tail every time you
wash them, your horse will sport some glo-
rious tresses. Buy a premium conditioner,
one that moisturizes. Be sure to rinse it all
out after you apply it.
 Brush it out. Before every ride and after
every washing, brush that mane and tail with
your horse’s body brush to keep snarls from
getting out of control. Avoid using a comb or
any other implement that can break and pull
out the hairs.
 Wrap it up. Protect that magnificent hair
when your horse is at pasture or in the stable
with braids and bags. Large, loose braids in
the mane keep the hair from getting dirty
and tangled, and keeping a braided tail in a
tail bag protects its’ hair from knots and
mud. Just be sure to undo the braids every
three to four days to keep the hair from
falling out.
If you want your horse’s tail to grow, keep it
loosely braided and in a tail bag.

 Towels: Use towels to dry the horse’s face (and probably your own) and
to clean up any other wet areas. You also want to use a towel to dry the
back of your horse’s pasterns to prevent the growth of any fungus in this
area of the leg.
 Cooler or sweat sheet: If you’re bathing your horse on a hot summer day,
you won’t need this piece of horse clothing. However, if your horse will
be exposed to drafts while you are walking him to dry him off, a cooler
or sweat sheet (see Chapter 6) is necessary.
Washing your horse properly
With your horse securely tied in a wash area and your tools assembled, you’re
ready to start scrubbing. Now, follow these steps to give your horse a bath:
1. Starting on the left side of your horse (you wash and rinse only one
side of the horse at a time), run lukewarm water from the garden hose
on the horse’s legs if your washrack has a hot water faucet. If not, you
have to use warm water from a bucket for this step. Wetting down the
legs first enables your horse to get used to the water and to the idea that
he’s about to be bathed.
2. After the horse adjusts to the water, slowly move the hose up to where
the neck joins the head and wet the body all the way to the rear end
of the horse.
3. Apply shampoo to your sponge and begin lathering your horse’s coat,
starting where the neck joins the head and working your way down
across the body. Be sure to scrub underneath your horse, where the
girth lies, and along the back where the saddle sits, because sweat and
dirt tend to accumulate in these areas. Wash your horse’s legs and the
outsides of his hooves.
4. After you’re confident that you’ve loosened the dirt and sweat from
your horse’s coat, take the hose or a bucket of water and begin rinsing
the shampoo from your horse’s coat. Warm water is best if you have
access to it, but if not, cool water from the hose will do.
Rinse thoroughly; you don’t want to leave behind any soap residue that
can irritate your horse’s skin.
5. Shampoo, condition, and rinse the horse’s mane. If the mane is on the
right side of the horse, move over to that side.
6. Repeat Steps 1–4 for the right side of the horse.
7. Wash the horse’s tail. Wet the tail with water and apply shampoo. Be sure
to work the lather into the tail so that you lather up all of the hair. Rinse,
condition, and rinse again. Be sure to rinse out all the soap residue from
the base of the tail. Soap residue can irritate the horse’s skin, and he’ll
probably rub his tail on whatever he can find, dirtying those luxurious
locks. (See the nearby sidebar “Making your equine’s locks more luxuri-
ous” for additional tips about maintaining your horse’s tail and mane.)
179
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Horse Clean and Pretty

8. Wash the horse’s head. This step can be tricky, depending on the horse.
Most horses are cooperative when having their faces cleaned. Others have
had bad experiences or are wary of the process and give you trouble.
In either case, be gentle and considerate when washing your horse’s face.
Wet the horse’s face with a sponge and warm water. Don’t forget to wet
and wash the forelock when you do the head.
We recommend that you just rinse the face with a clean sponge and water
and avoid using shampoo on your horse’s face. Shampoo is difficult to
rinse off thoroughly, and it can get in the horse’s eyes — ouch! Avoid the
temptation to wash your horse’s face by squirting it with the garden hose.
Some horses tolerate it, but all clearly hate it.
180
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 
Private parts
Like it or not, the private areas of the horse need
to be washed on a regular basis. In the wild, the
normal course of equine reproduction keeps
these areas clean, healthy, and in working order.
When cleaning your mare or gelding’s private
areas, use a mild soap or a gel product made
specifically for that purpose. It’s available in tack
stores. You also want to have a supply of latex
gloves on hand for these kinds of procedures.
If your horse is a mare, your job is relatively easy.
All you need to do for her is to clean out the waxy
substance that builds up between the teats,
located underneath her body between her back
legs. Wet the area with warm water and apply
shampoo between the teats. Manually remove
the wax that builds up there — the latex gloves
come in handy for this task. Rinse thoroughly to
remove all that soap. Be aware that your mare
may not like all this attention and may try to kick
out at you. Be cautious until you know how she
reacts to this process.
If your horse is a gelding, you need to clean his
sheath at least once a year. A lovely little item
affectionately known as the bean can form from
a build-up of secretions in the pocket at the end
of the penis and result in irritation and swelling.
The bean needs to be removed annually, some-
times more often.
If you’ve never cleaned your gelding’s sheath,
we recommend that you have a veterinarian do
it the first time. Some geldings react violently to
interference in this very delicate area — who
can blame them? — and it’s best to have a trained
professional deal with this situation.
If your vet tells you that your gelding is amenable
to having his sheath cleaned, you can try doing
it yourself. Start out by putting on a latex glove
and covering your hand with a very small
amount of soap. Wet the area with warm water
and loosen and remove the built-up material
inside the sheath. If your horse is very cooper-
ative, he will drop his penis, which enables you
to wash that, too.
After you finish cleaning your horse’s private
parts, rinse the entire area thoroughly with cool
water, making sure to remove all the soap. Any
residue left on the horse’s private parts will irri-
tate him.
Although you can try clean your own gelding’s
sheath, the truth of the matter is that most geldings
are uncooperative when sheath-cleaning time
comes and require a sedative before they allow
their genitals to be handled. Don’t feel that you’re
cheating if you opt to skip performing this aspect
of horse care. It’s perfectly reasonable to have
your vet do the cleaning each and every time.

There is a right way to bathe a horse and a wrong way. Your horse wants you
to do it the right way by adhering to the following list of do’s and don’ts:
 Do have patience with your horse when bathing him. Bathing makes
no sense to horses; they put up with it only because we ask them to.
 Do have consideration for your horse during the bath. Use a comfort-
able water temperature and appropriate water pressure.
 Do talk to your horse when bathing him. Constantly reassure him and
tell him what a good horse he is.
 Don’t spray your horse in the face with water. How would you like it if
someone did that to you?
 Don’t get water in your horse’s eyes, ears, or nostrils. Doing so not only
causes the horse fear and discomfort, but it also can result in medical
problems.
 Don’t put your horse back in his pasture or stall while he’s dripping wet.
Caring for your horse after his bath
After giving your horse a bath, it’s time to dry him off. How fast your horse dries
depends on the thickness of his coat, the air temperature, and the humidity.
Here’s some advice to help you get that 1,000-pound, dripping-wet animal dry
in the shortest time and safest manner possible:
 Whisk away as much excess water on the body as you can by using your
sweat scraper. Start at your horse’s neck on the left side and scrape in
long strokes in the direction the hair grows, working your way across his
body. Do the same for the right side of his body. Finish by scraping the
front of his chest and his belly.
 Dry your horse’s face with a towel, being careful not to scare him with it.
Move slowly and talk to him gently and give him a chance to sniff the
towel before you put it on his face.
 Walk your horse around in the sun, if the weather is hot and sunny,
preferably on a hard surface or on grass so dust doesn’t stick to his
newly washed legs and hooves. If your horse is amenable to going on a
hotwalker (a mechanical merry-go-round of sorts), you can put him on
one of these contraptions as long as you stay there to supervise.
 Cover your horse with a cooler or sweat sheet before walking him if the
air temperature feels cool to you.
Never put your horse back in his stall, paddock, or pasture while he still is
soaking wet. Not only is this unhealthy for the horse (he can get a chill if the
weather is cold), but all your hard work goes down the drain when he gets
down and rolls!

You’ve seen those before-and-after makeover photos, right? Well, the equine
equivalent to those images are before-and-after clipping photos. Clipping is the
practice of shaving a horse’s hair, or sections of his hair, so the hair is close to
the skin. If you clip a horse that hasn’t been clipped in a few months, chances
are you won’t recognize the beast afterward. And just like in the makeover
pictures, the after photo looks a whole lot better than the before shot.
Clipping is a simple and easy way to make your horse look good. Even a less-
than-beautiful horse can be made to look much more handsome with a simple
head and leg trim.
Several ways of clipping exist. Basic maintenance clipping involves trimming
the head and legs. More extensive clipping is necessary in body clips, where
large amounts of hair are removed from the horse’s coat to help him cool
down quickly after a workout.
The type of clippers you use depends on what you plan to clip. Maintenance
clips require nothing more than a good pair of small horse clippers. Body clips,
on the other hand, call for heavy-duty equipment: body clippers. (See Chap-
ter 6 for more information on clippers.)
Clipping your horse is a relatively simple chore, provided your horse cooper-
ates. A simple maintenance clip shouldn’t take more than 15 or 20 minutes at
most. Body clips can take anywhere from half an hour to all day, depending
on the extent of the clip.
The scoop on maintenance clipping
To keep your horse looking nice and neat, perform a maintenance clip on him
at least twice a month, which means trimming the whiskers off the nose, clip-
ping the excess hair from his ears, and removing the overgrown hair on his
fetlocks (ankles). Unless you show your horse in a discipline that forbids it, you
also need to trim your horse’s bridle path (the area of the mane just behind the
horse’s ears, measuring about four inches in length) as part of this routine.
Before you clip your horse, make sure that the clipper blades you’re using
are sharp and well oiled. Read the instruction manual to learn about setting
the clipping depth and make sure your horse is clean and dry before you clip.
Several hours after a bath when the horse’s coat is completely dry is a good
time to remove hair.
Follow these steps to perform a maintenance clip on your horse. Remember
to move the clippers along the hair in the opposite direction that it grows:

Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

1. Tie your horse securely at a hitching post or at crossties (see Chap-
ter 13). If you’re not sure whether your horse is amenable to clippers, ask
someone to hold the lead rope while you do your clipping instead of tying
your horse. If your horse is cooperative, you can tie him up next time.
2. Stand to one side and start clipping your horse’s head at the jaw line,
lightly trimming hair that extends beyond the horse’s jaw line. Clip up
to the level of the jaw, removing that shaggy look. Many horses are fright-
ened of having their heads trimmed. If your horse gets panicky when you
try to clip his head, recondition him to tolerate the clippers.
If you have a clipper-phobic horse, try trimming his fetlocks, bridle path,
and whiskers with scissors. Most horses afraid of clippers don’t mind
being trimmed this way.
3. Trim the whiskers from your horse’s muzzle gently, one whisker at a
time. Although a muzzle full of whiskers isn’t pretty, some equine experts
believe that horses use their whiskers as feelers in the dark. If you prefer
that your horse keep his whiskers, simply skip this part of the process.
Nevertheless, you need to be sure to leave the long whisker-type hairs
around the horse’s eyes intact. Experts believe these hairs help keep
horses from injuring their eyes on objects in the dark.
4. Move up to the horse’s ears and trim the hair protruding around the
edges. Don’t trim the inside of the horse’s ears because the horse needs
that interior hair to protect the inner ear from insects, dirt, and other
intrusions.
5. Shave a bridle path for your horse, just behind the ears. The length of
the bridle path depends on the discipline in which you ride your horse
and/or your horse’s breed (see Chapter 14 for discipline details). If you
plan to show your horse, this detail is important. Talk to other equestri-
ans who ride in your discipline to find out the proper length of bridle
path for your horse.
If you aren’t showing but just want to create a comfortable landing strip
for the top of your horse’s headstall so his mane doesn’t get tangled in
the bridle (the actual purpose of a bridle path) clip back about three
inches of mane from behind the ears.
6. Check the back of your horse’s fetlocks to see whether your horse
has ergots, soft, horny growths at the point of the fetlock joints.
If so, take scissors and cut down the ergots so they’re only about half
an inch long.
7. Trim your horse’s fetlocks. Before you start clipping, use your hand to
feel the shape of the bone at your horse’s ankle. The object here is to clip
short the hair around the anklebone.
8. Trim the long hair that hangs over the coronet onto the top of the
hoof (see Chapter 2 for a diagram indicating the exact location of
the coronet). Clip the hair gently until the line between the top of the
hoof and the coronet is straight and void of shaggy hairs.
183
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Horse Clean and Pretty

When clipping your horse, don’t ever put your head in front of or behind
your horse’s legs or under his belly. Doing so puts you at risk for getting
kicked in the head.
Caring for your clippers
If you take good care of your clippers, they’ll take good care of your horse.
Follow these rules of clipper care:
 Keep your clippers well lubricated. Buy quality clipper lubricator and
lubricate the clippers before, while, and after you use them. You can buy
clipper oil at the same place where you got your clippers. Most tack stores
carry clipper oil.
 Use only sharp blades on your clippers. Ensure that you use blades specif-
ically made for your model, and make sure they’re sharp. Take them to a
blade sharpening service for maintenance. Places that sharpen scissors
and knives often sharpen clipper blades, too. Some tack stores also offer
this service.
 Don’t let your clippers overheat when you are using them. Check them
often while you’re clipping. If they get hot, turn them off and let them cool
so you don’t burn your horse.
 Keep your horse from stepping onto the clipper cord. If the cord breaks,
the horse can be shocked or electrocuted.
 Check the cord and plug regularly. Make sure that they aren’t frayed or
broken.
 Dismantle and clean your clippers periodically. Clean all the various
parts with a soft rag.
 Store your clippers in a dry place.
The basics of body clipping
One of the banes of the busy horse owner’s existence is the equine winter coat.
If you live in a cold climate where you don’t ride much in the winter, and if
your horse is out in a pasture, this wad of fuzzy hair is a blessing to your
horse — he needs it to keep warm. However, if you live in a temperate or,
worse yet, a mild climate, and if you ride in the wintertime, then that long
shaggy coat can be a real pain in the you-know-what.
Here’s the dilemma with winter coats: Nature designed this shaggy hair to
keep the horse warm in the coldest of winter months. In the wild, this warm
fur coat works great. Wild horses do little in the winter besides forage for
food and huddle together for warmth. But the domestic horse has a whole
184
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

other lifestyle. He is usually ridden in the winter and often is kept indoors in
a stall, where a thick winter coat is unnecessary.
When a horse in full winter coat is ridden, he sweats profusely, and it’s no
wonder. Imagine moving furniture all day dressed in a down coat! After the
horse’s workout, the thick hair is filled with sweat, and it can take hours to
dry out. In the meantime, the horse is subject to draft, chill, and ultimately 
illness, while you, the poor horse’s owner, spend half the day desperately
trying to get the horse to dry.
Humans have found a way out of this predicament: body clipping. By removing
some or all of the horse’s body hair in the wintertime, you can avoid having to
deal with the time and trouble it takes to properly cool down a hot and hairy
horse. And another perk: Clipped horses are easier to keep clean.
185
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Horse Clean and Pretty
Grooming your horse for show
If you’re planning to show your horse, you may
have your work cut out for you in the grooming
department, depending on which riding disci-
pline you’ve chosen (see Chapter 18 for details
on competitions). Although some events like
reining and cross-country jumping don’t call for
special grooming, some of the more popular
types of showing require that your horse look a
certain way.
We’re not going to try to explain every aspect of
how to groom a show horse for every possible
discipline. You can find out this information from
your trainer or from your fellow equestrians
after you become immersed in the show world.
But we can give you some general advice on
how to make your horse look good in the ring:
 A good trim. All show disciplines have one
thing in common, and that’s the requirement
for a neatly clipped horse. Ears, muzzle, and
fetlocks must be properly trimmed. In some
breeds, the bridle path (the area of the
mane just behind the ears) also needs to be
clipped. To find out how to clip these areas,
see “The scoop on maintenance clipping”
earlier in this chapter.
 Winning sheen. No matter what type of
showing you plan to do, your horse stands a
better chance of winning if his coat is clean
and shiny. Bathe your horse a day or so
before the show to give his coat time to
regain some of its natural oils. On the day of
the event, you can apply any number of
commercial coat polishing products meant
to add sheen to a horse’s coat.
 Beautiful braids. A number of disciplines —
including dressage and hunt seat — call for
the horse’s mane (and sometimes the tail) to
be braided. Although we could describe
these procedures for you here, we don’t
think a written description will help you that
much. The best way to find out the proper
braids for your discipline is to have a trainer
or fellow competitor show you how. Don’t be
shy about asking for help. Everyone has to
learn sometime, and most knowledgeable
horse people are happy to teach newcomers
the braiding ropes.
 Proper manes and tails. Some disciplines,
such as western pleasure and saddle seat,
require trimmed mane and tail styles. Learn
the particulars of your discipline and acquire
the skills needed to make your horse look like
it should for the show ring.

Of course, body clipping has its downside. In cases where horses receive 
substantial body clips, you must keep the horse constantly blanketed, which
is only logical because body clipping removes the horse’s natural means of
staying warm in winter. If you choose to clip your horse, you need to make
sure your horse wears a blanket in cold weather and that the blanket comes
off when the weather heats up. And if you have a particularly hairy horse,
you may have to do a body clip more than once during the cold weather
season.
Surveying types of body clips
If you plan to ride your horse often in the wintertime, you may want to consider
body clipping. Depending on your horse’s living conditions, work schedule,
and your personal preference, you can choose from several different types of
clips, shown in Figure 9-3.
Hunter clip
Blanket clip
Trace clip
Figure 9-3:

186
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

The following list explains the uses of the different clip styles:
 Trace clip: The trace clip is a good choice for horses that live outdoors
and do moderate work in the winter. With the trace clip, only the bottom
third of the horse’s coat is removed. The underside of the neck, belly, and
chest are trimmed. With this clip, the horse sweats less during workouts,
but still retains enough coat to stay warm outdoors in temperate weather.
In cold weather climates, a horse with a trace clip must be blanketed on
cold days and every night.
 Blanket clip: This clip requires removal of the hair on the horse’s head,
neck, chest, shoulders, and the lower portion of the abdomen and
hindquarters. The blanket clip is good for horses that work hard in the
winter but still need some protection from the cold on their legs, back,
and hips. Horses with blanket clips must be blanketed on cold days and
every night.
 Hunter clip: The hunter clip is helpful to horses that work hard out on
the field, such as foxhunters, cross-country event horses, and endurance
horses. This clip leaves a patch of hair on the back where the saddle lays
and a patch of hair on the legs. The rest of the horse is completely clipped.
Horses with hunter clips must be blanketed on cold days and every night.
 Full clip: With the full clip, the entire winter coat is removed from the
horse’s body. This clip is chosen by many riders who compete with their
horses in events year-round or who work them hard. This clip is best
used on horses that are stabled indoors. A blanket is required for cold
days and every night.
Clipping your horse’s body successfully
Body clipping is an art that takes a bit of practice. You may want to find an
experienced horse person to help you show you how to do the clipping the
first time around — or to at least get you started, anyway.
Before you start clipping, assemble everything you need to do the job:
 Body clippers: If you plan to do a full clip, blanket clip, or hunter clip,
you need a good pair of body clippers. (You can usually do a trace clip
using regular horse clippers.) If you don’t want to invest in a pair of
body clippers, you can usually rent them from a local tack and feed
store. Make sure the blades are sharp before you begin your task.
 Clipper lubricant: To keep your clippers from getting jammed or over-
heated, keep lubricating them as you clip. You can purchase clipper
lubricant at a tack and feed store.
187
Chapter 9: Keeping Your Horse Clean and Pretty

 White chalk: For any clip other than a full clip, use a piece of white chalk
to draw the outline of the clip before you start trimming. You’re better off
with grooming chalk purchased at a tack and feed store rather than black-
board chalk simply, because grooming chalk draws better on horsehair.
 Towels: Wipe the oil and hair from your clipper periodically with a towel.
You can also use a towel to wipe the hair from yourself. Clipping is messy
business, especially on windy days.
 Work goggles: You need goggles to protect your eyes from flying horse-
hair, if you’re clipping on a windy day.
When you’re ready to do the actual clipping, keep these pointers in mind:
 Wear work clothes. You’ll be covered with horsehair by the time you
finish. Consider wearing a windbreaker suit that you can just strip off
before you get in your car or go back into your house.
 Feed your horse. Give your horse a hay net filled with hay to occupy
him as you clip.
 Make sure that your horse is clean and dry before you start clipping.
A dirty coat is nearly impossible to clip.
 Lubricate your running clipper blades frequently. Lubricate before
you start trimming and frequently as you go along to keep the clippers
cutting smoothly; remove hair fragments with a brush.
 Start at the front of your horse and work backward. Start on one side
of the horse first and then work your way to the other side.
 Clip against the lay of the hair.
 Hold the clipper so the blades lay flat against the horse. This keeps
you from cutting too deep.
 Give your horse frequent breaks. Clipping not only is tiring for you, but
also for the horse. He has to stand still for long periods of time. Consider
doing your clipping in segments over two or three days.
 Check the temperature of the blades frequently. If they start to feel
hot, let them cool down before you continue.
 Sweep up the clipped hair after you finish. If you’re boarding your horse,
sweep up as a courtesy to others who use the facilities. If you keep your
horse at home, clean the hair up before the wind scatters it around.
If you clip your horse in the early spring, consider leaving some of the
hair on the ground. Birds love to use it as nesting material.

Health Problems

 Taking care of your horse yourself
D
espite their size and physical strength, horses are actually rather deli-
cate creatures when it comes to their health. When a horse gets sick,
he can be a real hassle to his owner: Bills can add up quickly, a sick horse
means time lost in the saddle, and horses are notoriously difficult to medicate.
For these reasons and more, horse owners need to work hard at preventing
equine illness. Horses require regular preventive care to keep them healthy
and able to perform the tasks asked of them.
The Doctor Is In: How a 
Vet Helps Your Horse
The best way to take care of your horse’s health is to find a good veterinarian
and work with him or her to establish a preventive care plan for your horse.
Although the cost of preventive care may tweak your wallet a bit, anteing up
is well worth the money. In return, you’ll have a happy, healthy horse who
can do whatever you ask, and lower vet bills in the long run.
In the following sections, we cover how to find the right vet for your horse
and the procedures that a vet usually handles for keeping a horse healthy.

Searching for a vet
One of the most important things you can do for your horse’s health is to
find a good veterinarian. Just like human doctors, veterinarians vary in skill,
knowledge, dedication, and bedside manner. Finding a horse doctor who can
provide you with these elements ensures that both you and your horse feel
well taken care of.
Choose a veterinarian before your find yourself in an emergency situation. A
vet already familiar with your horse can be a huge plus during an emergency.
If you’re a regular client, your request for an emergency barn call receives pri-
ority treatment over a similar request from a nonregular client.
Start your search for a vet the moment you realize you’re adding a horse to
your family. The timing may be after you have purchased your horse but before
you bring him home.
Locating a good equine veterinarian usually takes a bit of research. Don’t
settle for the first name you see in the phonebook or use the vet your next-
door neighbor is using without doing some investigation first.
The best choice for your horse’s health-care provider (preventive, regular, and
emergency care) is a veterinarian who specializes in horses. Equine veterinar-
ians are specially trained to diagnose and treat equine illnesses, and they have
more knowledge of horse issues than their small-animal counterparts. If you
can’t find a vet in your area who deals exclusively with horses, make sure that
the vet you choose has at least moderate experience in equine medicine.
Follow these steps to finding a vet who really knows equine stuff:
1. Get referrals. Unlike cat and dog owners, horse owners religiously share
veterinary information with each other — and that includes opinions
on local vets. You can easily identify the veterinarians in your area who
have the best reputations among horse owners just by listening to con-
versations around the stable concerning vets. You can even go so far as
to ask your fellow horse owners which vets they prefer. Make note of the
names you hear time and again in a positive light, and put them on the
top of your list.
If horse owners are few and far between where you live — or if equine
veterinarians are scarce — you may be limited to only one or two names.
2. Ask questions. After you’re armed with a couple of names of equine vet-
erinarians, call each one to get more information. Because most equine
vets have limited or nonexistent office staff, you may be posing your
questions directly to the actual veterinarian. Find out whether more
than one doctor works in the practice and whether the vet or vets are
available 24 hours a day for emergencies. (The answer should be “yes.”)
Also, ask about the qualifications of the doctors in the practice. Look for
a specialization in equine medicine and several years of experience.
190
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Make certain the vet provides routine care for horses, and doesn’t just
specialize in one area of equine health.
3. Meet the vet. Based on what you hear from other horse owners and over
the phone from the veterinarian or practice staff, decide which vet or
practice is your first choice. Then schedule an appointment for your
horse’s next inoculation or deworming. When the vet comes out to see
your horse, talk to him or her and try to get a feeling for the vet’s bed-
side manner. Pay close attention to the way the vet behaves with your
horse. The vet should answer all your questions in a clear and under-
standable fashion. You’re looking for someone who feels comfortable
around horses and who knows how to handle them.
At this point in the process, you can pretty much go on gut instinct.
If you like and you feel comfortable with the vet, make him or her your
permanent vet. If not, call the vet who came in second on your list and
perform the same evaluation.
If you already went through an evaluation process when choosing a veterinar-
ian who performed the prepurchase exam on your horse and were happy with
the service you received, consider this individual as your horse’s regular vet.
See Chapter 5 for more about prepurchase exams.
Taking a shot at vaccinations
A number of dangerous infectious diseases plague the horse world, but the
good news is that vaccines exist for many of them. To keep your horse in his
optimal state of health, you need to commit to a regular vaccination program,
developed with your veterinarian, to protect your horse from serious illness.
Although a host of other vaccines exist, the four that follow represent the
absolute minimum your horse needs.
 Influenza/rhinopneumonitis: These two respiratory illnesses strike
with the same kind of regularity as human flu viruses and with similar
symptoms. Your veterinarian may recommend that your horse be inocu-
lated with flu/rhino vaccine as frequently as every three months, or only
twice a year if the horse is at minimal risk of exposure — isn’t exposed
to many other horses.
 Equine encephalomyelitis: Three strains of the same encephalomyelitis
illnesses — Western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), Eastern equine
encephalomyelitis (EEE), and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis
(VEE) — can infect horses through mosquito bites. Encephalomyelitis
attacks the central nervous system and can cause severe neurological
symptoms and even death. Your veterinarian can recommend inocula-
tion against one or more of these diseases at least once a year.
 Tetanus: Tetanus isn’t contagious but can be contracted through 
open wounds. This bacterial disease can result in serious neurological
191
Chapter 10: Preventing Equine Health Problems

symptoms, such as extreme sensitivity to touch and spasm of the neck
and jaw muscles, and ultimately death in many cases. Because horses
are particularly susceptible to tetanus, veterinarians recommend an
inoculation of tetanus toxoid for your horse at least once a year.
 West Nile virus: The insidious West Nile virus has now spread across the
United States and Canada, threatening the lives of thousands of horses.
Humans, birds, and equines are the only creatures seriously affected by
the disease, which is spread by mosquitoes and attacks the nervous
system. Horses that contract West Nile virus can become permanently
damaged, and death often results. Vaccinating your horse once or twice
a year (depending on which vaccine your vet uses) is vital to protect
him from this terrible disease.
Reputable boarding stables require that all horses on the property be kept
up-to-date on inoculations against contagious diseases. If your horse is
boarded, maintaining a consistent schedule of inoculations is imperative.
Getting the bugs out with deworming
Horses, like most other animals, are quite susceptible to a number of internal
parasites. These parasites, more commonly known as worms, can cause seri-
ous damage to your horse’s internal organs. When left uncontrolled, they can
result in chronic colic (stomach pain) and even death.
Approximately 150 different species of internal parasites can infect the horse.
Don’t worry. We won’t bore you with all 150, but the more common ones
include strongyles, roundworms, pinworms, and bots.
Although keeping worms from infecting your horse is nearly impossible,
you can control their numbers. Regular deworming with a chemical agent
that is safe for horses kills parasites in their various stages of growth and 
is a necessary part of your horse’s preventive care. Discuss your horse’s
deworming needs with your vet so the two of you can come up with an effec-
tive program.
Several over-the-counter dewormers are available to horse owners at feed
stores and can be used on a regular basis under your vet’s supervision. You
can also ask your veterinarian to deworm your horse for you and or recom-
mend a dewormer rotating schedule to ensure the parasites in your horse’s
gut don’t develop a resistance to any one product.
Keeping track of teeth
Your own dentist probably preaches the importance of brushing, flossing, and
maintaining your choppers. Horses depend on their teeth just as much, if not
more than humans. Because the food they eat is so difficult to chew and digest
192
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

(try downing a sprig of alfalfa hay sometime and you’ll see what we mean),
maintaining your horse’s healthy teeth is vitally important.
To combat the normal wear that occurs from chewing such tough, fibrous
foods, nature has equipped the horse with teeth that slowly erupt from the
gum as the top layer wears off. However, the horse’s upper jaw is wider than
his lower jaw, so the upper outside teeth and lower inside teeth have nothing
to wear against as they erupt, and ridges and sharp points result. These ridges
and points restrict the horse’s normal side-to-side rotary chewing motion,
resulting in poor and painful chewing and the dropping of food. Horses with
this condition tend to chew up and down instead of side to side, making horses
with neglected teeth prone to problems like choking and colic. These sharp
points also hurt the horse when the noseband is tightened and when the bit
hits the horse’s teeth.
To keep sharp points from interfering with your horse’s ability to chew and
subsequently digest his food, have your veterinarian file down those pointy
teeth as often as once or twice a year, depending on how fast they grow.
Called floating, this procedure is an absolute must in preventive care.
Have your veterinarian examine your horse’s teeth at least twice a year to
determine when his teeth need floating. During these exams, the vet can also
spot other dental problems that may be developing, such as infected teeth or
abnormal wear.
If the Shoe Fits: The Work of a Farrier
Nearly as important as finding a veterinarian for your horse is finding a skilled
and qualified farrier, a specialist in trimming and shoeing your horse’s hooves.
Choose your farrier wisely: The health of your horse’s hooves and legs depends
on it.
In the following sections, we discuss the selection of a farrier and the health-
care tasks usually assigned to a farrier.
Finding a farrier
The best way to locate a good farrier is through a referral, and the first person
to ask for a referral is your vet. Most equine vets are well acquainted with the
farriers in their area and can recommend one or two good ones.
You can ask other horse owners for referrals as well. If you go this route, be
sure to take a consensus and see which farriers get the most thumbs up.
Don’t base your decision on the comments of only one owner — you want
to get a feeling for which farriers are able to successfully handle horses with
different shoeing needs.
193
Chapter 10: Preventing Equine Health Problems

Before you settle on a farrier, find out where the person was educated and
how long she has been in business. You want to select a farrier who has a
strong background in the trade, through both education and hands-on experi-
ence. Pick someone you’re comfortable with who seems willing to discuss
your horse’s needs in a friendly and articulate manner. Find out whether this
person is available if your horse needs corrective shoeing to fix a leg problem,
or if your horse loses a shoe.
After you have chosen a farrier, monitor his work closely. Does the farrier come
when he is supposed to, or do your horse’s feet go weeks overdue because
the farrier doesn’t show up on a regular basis? Does your farrier trim or shoe
your horse too frequently, just to pad his pockets? Most horses need shoes
and/or trimming every six to eight weeks. If your farrier wants to work on
your horse more often than this, ask him for a detailed explanation as to why.
Consider how your horse feels after being shod. Is he “ouchy,” walking gin-
gerly after a trim, or stumbling a lot after he gets his new shoes? Does he
become lame often (start limping), with a diagnosis related to poor shoeing?
If so, your farrier isn’t doing a good job.
If your horse is having trouble with his hooves or legs, consider the job your
farrier is doing, and talk to your vet about the possible causes. A farrier can
make or break a horse’s soundness (ability to move without pain).
Caring for a horse’s hooves
If you want your horse to do more than just look good, you have to take care
of his feet. A horse with poorly treated feet can be plagued with chronic lame-
ness and may eventually end up unrideable. Regular trimming and shoeing by
a qualified farrier are keys to good hoof care.
Trimming
Horses’ hooves are always growing, just like human fingernails. For your horse
to stay sound, his feet must be kept neatly trimmed at an angle parallel to the
slope of his pastern (ankle). No one is better qualified to perform this trimming
accurately than a professional farrier.
Each horse’s feet grow at a different pace, so the frequency between trimmings
varies from horse to horse. The time range for most trims can be anywhere
from six to eight weeks. No horse should ever go longer than eight weeks
without a trim.
Shoeing
The vast majority of horses ridden for pleasure and show have to wear metal
shoes for protection. Shoes guard a horse’s hoof from cracking and splitting,
two problems that can result with normal riding.
194
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Depending on the strength of your horse’s hooves and what you’re using him
for, you can opt to have your horse shod on all four feet or on just the front
hooves where the majority of pressure exists during exercise. If you ride your
horse lightly or he has very tough hooves, he probably doesn’t even need
shoes. In addition, horses that spend all their time at pasture rarely need shoes.
Because each individual horse is different, discuss your particular shoeing
needs with your farrier. Most horses need new shoes every six to eight weeks,
depending on how fast the hoof grows and how quickly the shoes wear out.
Your farrier can help you determine the frequency of shoeing for your horse.
Every now and then, one of your horse’s shoes may fall off — in other words,
the horse throws a shoe. Never ride your horse with a shoe missing from his
hoof. Doing so can result in damage to the bare hoof and possibly to the other
legs. If you’re riding when the shoe comes off, dismount, retrieve the shoe,
walk your horse back to the stable, and call your farrier to have it nailed back
on. You can also keep an item known as a hoof boot with you when you ride,
and use this as a substitute for a shoe until you make it back to the barn. If you
find your horse in his stall with a shoe missing, skip riding until the farrier
replaces the shoe.
In Control: Understanding Your 
Role in Preventive Care
In addition to having a good veterinarian and farrier, two other factors play a
large part in determining the general well-being of your horse: food and exer-
cise. You can have the best veterinarian and farrier in the world, but if you
don’t feed and exercise your horse properly, you won’t have a healthy horse.
Feeding time
The quality of the feed you provide, the frequency with which you feed it, and
the feed’s consistency are big factors in your horse’s health:
 Quality: Good feed is vitally important when it comes to your horse’s gen-
eral well-being. Poor hay or pasture lacks nutrients and may cause vitamin
and mineral deficiencies. Moldy or diseased hay can make your horse
sick. Don’t scrimp on your horse’s feed. Buying poor quality hay, or graz-
ing your horse on poor pasture just to save a few bucks will come back
to haunt you in the form of poor health for your horse. (See Chapter 8
for details on determining the quality of hay.)
 Frequency: Horses evolved as grazing animals, and so they need to eat
often. Their digestive systems can’t tolerate long periods of time without
eating. If you force your horse to go too long between meals, you’re asking
195
Chapter 10: Preventing Equine Health Problems

for trouble in the form of colic and other problems. Feed your horse at
least twice a day at regular times, with three times a day the ideal. Or,
supplement your horse’s regular feedings with low-calorie grass hay to
keep him occupied. Even better: Keep your horse in a pasture that pro-
vides access to quality grass at all times.
 Consistency: Any sudden change in feed can cause considerable disrup-
tion and even serious illness to your horse and its digestive system. If
you want to change your horse’s feed from one type to another, do so
gradually over a period of at least two weeks. The same goes for chang-
ing the amount of feed you’re giving your horse. If you want to increase
the amount, do so gradually during a week or two.
Getting exercise
Nature designed horses to be on the go all the time. Wild horses walk con-
stantly as they graze, and stand still only for a few hours a day to sleep.
Contrast this reality with the life of a typical stabled horse, who spends most
of his time standing around and moving only a few hours a day! The result of
this sedentary life can be a host of leg and digestive problems for your horse.
In the same way your own doctor has espoused the importance of getting
your rump off the couch and exercising, the same goes for your horse. If you
keep your horse in a stable, you need to make special efforts to keep his
body in good working order. Provide a minimum of 30 minutes of exercise a
day to increase circulation, loosen muscles, and provide mental stimulation.
Be sure to warm up and cool down with at least 10 minutes of walking before
and after a workout to help your horse’s body stay healthy. (See Chapter 8
for more about daily exercise.)
Exercise is not only necessary for your horse’s physical well-being but also
for his mental health. If you spent most of your time standing around inside a
box with nothing to do, you’d get pretty bored. Horses are no different, and
need time and exercise outside their stalls to keep from developing neurotic
habits (known as stable vices; see Chapter 2) and other assorted misbehaviors.
If your horse lives in a pasture and can graze at will, the need for structured
exercise is less important than for a stabled horse.

P
eople who spend significant amounts of time around horses often wonder
about the sanity of the guy who coined the phrase, “Healthy as a horse.”
Horses are notorious for getting sick. Whether a self-inflicted injury, a bout
with colic that requires surgery, or simply the arthritis that comes with old
age, horses seem to require more veterinary attention than do cats or dogs.
In fact, a vet has to treat the average horse about twice a year — not including
preventative care.
Okay, now we’ve scared you. But really, you don’t need to panic. The majority
of vet calls are for fairly common problems that the vet resolves with short-
term treatment — as long as you address the problem right away.
In this chapter, we show you some of the more common ailments and condi-
tions that can afflict your equine friend during his lifetime. Armed with this
knowledge, you’ll be able to recognize early symptoms of these ailments and
get help for your horse in a timely manner.

Tracking Symptoms (and Recognizing 
an Emergency)
Not every equine ailment requires a frantic phone call to the nearest veteri-
narian. You can deal with some problems at home, or at least monitor them
before making that call.
If your horse ever appears sick, you need to take his temperature before you
call the veterinarian. Taking your horse’s temperature isn’t the most fun part
of owning a horse, but you still need to know how to do it. The horse’s tem-
perature helps the vet decide whether the situation is an emergency or can
wait until later, or the next day.
Before you can take your horse’s temperature, you need to purchase a veteri-
nary thermometer from a pet supply or tack store, or you can simply buy
a human rectal thermometer. (Most thermometers are digital these days.)
Veterinary thermometers are better because they have a loop at the end; you
can tie some string or yarn onto the device, making it easier to hold onto while
taking the horse’s temperature. You need lubricant, too. K-Y Jelly or another
human-grade lubricant is sufficient. Stay away from petroleum jelly because it
can irritate the sensitive lining of the rectum. In a pinch, you can use your own
saliva as a lubricant.
Here’s how you actually do the deed:
1. Prepare the thermometer. If your thermometer is the old-fashioned
mercury type, shake it down so it reads 96°F (35.5°C) or below. If the
thermometer is digital, simply turn it on.
2. Lubricate the thermometer. Apply a good amount of lubricant to the
thermometer’s tip so it slides in easily.
3. Prepare your horse. Some horses are very calm when you take their
temperature; others freak out. If you have the kind of horse that doesn’t
appreciate the procedure, ask someone to hold the horse’s head before
you insert the thermometer and position the horse against a wall so he
can’t move away from you. Be patient and try to reassure the horse that
nothing terrible is about to happen to him.
4. Insert the thermometer. Stand to the side of and not directly behind the
horse. Hold the thermometer at an angle parallel to the horse’s back, lift
the tail, and slowly insert the thermometer about 3 inches into the horse’s
rectum. The thermometer should slide in gently. If the thermometer stops
part way in and won’t move forward, do not force it. Instead, pull it out
and reinsert again, angling it slightly up or down until it gently slides in.
5. Wait three minutes. Keep the thermometer inside the horse’s rectum for
three minutes, holding onto the end or the string the entire time.
198
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

6. Read the thermometer. After three minutes (or when the thermometer
beeps), you can remove the thermometer and read it. Normal adult equine
body temperature ranges from 99–101°F (37–38°C). Foals are 100–102°F
(37.5–39°C). If your horse’s temperature is above or below normal, call a
veterinarian immediately.
Here are physical signs to look for when your horse seems under the weather.
If your horse has one or more of these symptoms, the condition is an emer-
gency that warrants a call to and a possible visit from the vet:
 Bleeding: If your horse is bleeding heavily from any place on his body,
try applying pressure to stop the flow. Even if you can stop the bleeding,
call the vet. (See “Taking Care of Horse Wounds” later in this chapter for
details on how to control bleeding.)
 Blood in urine: If you see your horse urinating blood, a severe infection
or bladder injury is a possibility.
 Choking: A horse is choking if he coughs and salivates with his head
down while watery food exits his nose and mouth, backs away from his
food, acts anxious, and/or swallows repeatedly. A horse chokes when
food is trapped in the esophagus. The food doesn’t block the airway, so
the horse can still breathe, but you nevertheless must call the vet right
away. The trapped food can cause damage that will result in scarring
and subsequent narrowing of the diameter of the esophagus. This nar-
rowing causes the horse to be more prone to choking in the future.
 Colic: If your horse is sweating profusely, lying down and getting up,
pawing the ground, standing with his legs outstretched, rolling, and/or
biting at his abdomen, he’s suffering from colic. Remove his food and
lead him around at a walk until the vet arrives. We cover colic in detail
later in this chapter.
Not all colic symptoms are severe. If you see your horse behaving in any
way that indicates he may be having even slight stomach pain, you still
need to call a veterinarian.
If you see signs of colic but aren’t sure whether your horse is actually sick,
a good way to tell is to offer him a carrot. No healthy horse ever turns
down a carrot. If your horse refuses it, he’s suffering from abdominal dis-
tress or some other health problem and needs to see a vet right away.
 Diarrhea: Severe, very liquid, foul-smelling diarrhea can be life-threatening.
 Inability to stand: A horse that cannot or will not stand up is a very sick
horse. A horse that staggers or has trouble staying on his feet also is in
an emergency situation.
 Injury: Wounds that are deep or that expose the bone are emergencies,
and so are puncture wounds, which can easily become infected. You also
need to contact your vet if a less serious injury that doesn’t require sutures
begins to appear infected.
199
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

 Labored breathing: Rapid breathing, raspy breath, or heavy coughing
can be life-threatening for a horse.
 Painful eye: Call the vet if one or both of your horse’s eyes suddenly
becomes teary, the horse holds the lids partially or completely closed,
the white part of the eye is red, the eye is sensitive to light, or the sur-
face of the eye is cloudy. We cover eye problems in more detail later in
this chapter.
 Refusal to eat: When a horse won’t eat, you’re often seeing a sign of seri-
ous illness or possibly mild colic.
 Severe pain: A veterinarian needs to immediately examine any horse
that appears to have severe pain in any part of his body.
 Straining: If your horse is straining to defecate or urinate and nothing or
very little passes out, an intestinal or urethral blockage is likely.
 Swelling: Whenever any part of the horse’s body is swollen and hot to
the touch, call the vet.
Understanding Common Health Problems
Although horses are susceptible to a wide variety of ailments, the same hand-
ful of problems routinely crop up. Some of these illnesses have the potential
to be serious, while others are simply annoyances to the horse and the human.
In each situation, prompt treatment by a veterinarian is important to keep the
problem from getting out of hand.
This section outlines the most common equine health problems, along with
their symptoms, usual treatments, and general prognoses. Your veterinarian
can give you even more information — specific to your individual horse — on
any one of these conditions.
Azoturia
Azoturia, or tying up as it’s commonly called, affects a horse’s muscles. A high
amount of lactic acid in the body results in a condition that causes muscle
breakdown and severe cramping. Veterinarians don’t know why the lactic
acid content becomes so high, but they know the result is muscle and kidney
damage.
The symptoms of azoturia — anxiety, abnormally heavy perspiration, and
unusually fast pulse — usually come on 15 minutes to an hour into exercise.
Soon, the horse is experiencing intense stiffness, painful short steps, and a
resistance to walk. In severe cases, horses ultimately collapse.
200
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

If you suspect that your horse has azoturia, don’t force him to move. Instead,
call a vet immediately. The vet will likely give your horse a sedative and may
possibly treat your horse with other medications, depending on your horse’s
situation.
To prevent your horse from ever having to experience the anguish of azo-
turia, follow these guidelines:
 Provide regular exercise: Provide your horse with exercise on a daily
basis to keep his metabolism functioning properly. (Pastured horses tend
to exercise themselves and so are less prone to azoturia.) See Chapter 8
for details about including exercise in your horse’s daily routine.
 Warm up, cool down: You must spend at least 10 minutes warming up
your horse by walking and trotting. When your ride is over, walk the
horse for at least 10 minutes to help him cool down. Horses that are
properly warmed up and cooled down are less susceptible to azoturia.
 Cut feed rations: During times of long inactivity for your horse (bad
weather, lameness, and so on), reduce his intake of alfalfa (a particularly
high-protein hay) and grain. If the lay-up is short (only a day or two),
stop the grain only. Too much in the way of protein and carbohydrates
while inactive can result in azoturia when the horse returns to work.
Supplement the diet with low-protein timothy hay or orchard grass and
a fat source such as vegetable oil or rice bran so your horse still has
enough hay and energy in his diet. Chapter 8 has more info on feeding.
 Provide supplements: If your horse has repeated attacks of azoturia,
talk to your vet about supplementing the horse’s feed with vitamin E,
selenium, and fat sources such as rice bran. These additives can help
protect the horse from a recurrent attack.
Cancer
Fortunately, horses don’t often get cancer. When they do, the prognosis can
be poor, depending on where the cancer is located.
Horses can get any number of cancers, including the ones that affect the skin
and lymphatic systems. Diagnosis calls for a biopsy in the case of lumps or
tumors that appear, usually on the eye, skin, or genital area. Some cancers
are harder to diagnose because symptoms are vague. Horses that aren’t thriv-
ing and don’t respond to traditional treatments may be suffering from cancer,
which can include tumors on the internal organs.
Treatment for cancer includes surgery to remove the growth, radiation treat-
ment, chemotherapy, cryosurgery (freezing off the tumor, in the case of skin
cancer), immunotherapy (support for the immune system), and laser therapy.
201
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

The only type of cancer that can sometimes be prevented is skin cancer.
Cancerous areas on light-skinned horses may be avoided by keeping these
fair-complexioned equines out of the sun. (See “Melanomas” in this chapter
for specific information on skin cancer.)
Colic
Colic is actually a symptom, not a disease. The term colic refers to abdominal
pain, which can have any number of sources. Because horses are designed to
be grazers, they’re meant to ingest plant material at a slow and constant rate.
The equine digestive system often is upset when humans confine horses and
give them concentrated feeds.
Colic is a rather common problem among horses. It can be serious or it can be
mild, but it’s always a cause for concern and always warrants a call to the vet.
Horses suffering from colic usually are in a great deal of pain. They express
their discomfort by doing some or all of the following:
 Biting at the flanks or abdomen
 Kicking at the belly
 Lying down
 Pacing
 Pawing
 Rolling
 Standing with legs stretched out
 Straining
 Sweating profusely
 Swishing the tail violently
These bouts of pain often come in waves, so the horse may seem all right one
minute but frantic the next. The pain also can start out mild and get progres-
sively worse, or simply remain mild.
If you suspect that your horse has colic, call a veterinarian immediately. Take
away the horse’s food and walk him while you wait for the vet to arrive.
Colic classifications
Colic has two classifications: medical or surgical. Here’s a look at each and
the problems that usually cause them.
202
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

 Medical colic: Colics that can be fixed with simple medical treatment —
usually without having to transport the horse to a hospital — are consid-
ered medical colics. Medical colics are the most common classification
of colic and usually are caused by gas or impactions (blockages). Each of
these causes has its own symptoms and treatments:
• Gas colic: This type of colic is the result of gas that has built up
inside the large intestine. Consumption of spoiled food is one
common cause of gas colic, and so is eating too much of a new
food. The horse’s digestive system becomes dominated with gas-
producing organisms, resulting in excessive gas.
Gas colic usually isn’t life-threatening, but it is extremely painful
and requires immediate veterinary attention. Your vet may give
your horse a pain reliever and monitor him to determine if further
treatment is required.
• Impaction colic: This colic is caused by an impaction in the large
intestine. Any number of things can cause an impaction in the intes-
tine, but lack of sufficient water intake often is to blame, resulting
in manure that is dry, hard, and difficult to pass. Horses with teeth
problems often develop impaction colic caused by their inability to
properly chew their food. The ingestion of sand — which can happen
when horses eat hay directly off the ground, graze at pasture, or
deliberately eat sand in a turn-out arena — and dehydration also can
cause impaction colic. Veterinarians typically treat impaction colic
with pain relievers and oral administration of oil that works as a
laxative. The goal is to get the horse to pass the impacted manure.
 Surgical colic: Surgical colic refers to a colic that requires surgery for
repair. This type of colic can be caused by a number of issues, including
impactions, enteroliths (stones that form in the intestines), and other
conditions that can cause parts of the intestine to die off. In most cases
of surgical colic, the horse will die without the surgery.
Colic prevention
The good news about colic is that in many cases, it is preventable. Follow
these guidelines to keep your horse’s digestive system working properly:
 Feed often: Feeding your horse as frequently as possible is a good way
to ward off colic. The equine digestive system seems to function best
when it’s constantly working to digest fibrous foods. Keep your horse at
pasture whenever possible, or if he’s stabled, try giving him three meals
a day. Two is the absolute minimum. See Chapter 8 for more info about
feeding your horse.
 Feed hay: Veterinarians have discovered that fibrous particles inside the
intestine tend to stimulate the horse’s gut and therefore reduce the inci-
dence of colic. Give your horse a diet that includes hay to ensure he gets
plenty of fiber. However, avoid feeding the hay off the ground, so the horse
doesn’t ingest sand particles that can cause colic.
203
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

 Provide high-quality feed: When you feed your horse, give him only the
highest quality hay and/or grain. Don’t try to save a buck by purchasing
cheaper (and therefore lower-quality) feed. Avoid hay that contains mold,
weeds, and other contaminants, such as dirt.
 Provide plenty of water: Another way to prevent colic is to ensure that
your horse has access to plenty of fresh drinking water. Be sure to keep
waterers and troughs clean. In the wintertime, be certain that the horse’s
water supply hasn’t frozen over. A water heater is a good investment for
horse owners who live in frigid climates.
Keeping your water in liquid form isn’t the only service a water heater
can provide; it can also keep the water at a comfortable temperature.
Horses are less likely to drink water that is extremely cold, so keeping
water lukewarm even in winter encourages your horse to drink.
If you live in a hot climate, be sure your horse’s water stays cool in the
summer. Horses are reluctant to drink hot water. Add cool water to troughs
frequently, and bury water lines so they aren’t exposed to direct sun.
Check out Chapter 8 for details on watering your horse.
 Use electrolytes: In any situation where your horse may not be drinking
enough water (like on cold winter days) or may be losing a good deal of
body fluids and salts (during the hot summer or when exercising heavily),
supplement his feed with an electrolyte mixture. Electrolytes increase
the salt level in the horse’s body, thus stimulating his thirst. Several
commercial electrolyte products for horses are available through tack
and feed stores; you can mix them with the horse’s grain or administer
them directly into the mouth in paste form.
Although some manufacturers’ labeling on electrolyte products suggests
adding the product to the horse’s water, we don’t recommend that you
do because the taste can discourage the animal from drinking.
 Provide exercise: Regular exercise is another way to help prevent colic,
because it stimulates gut motility. Given this fact, your horse needs to
receive some kind of exercise daily — especially if your horse is stabled.
Even if you have time for only a half-hour walk around the property, the
exercise helps keep your horse’s digestive system in working order. Flip
to Chapter 8 for more info about regular exercise.
 Warm up and cool down: When you ride your horse, be sure to make time
for gradual warm-ups and cool downs before and after exercise. Don’t
work your horse hard without at least a 10-minute walk/trot warm-up first,
and be sure to finish up your ride with at least 10 minutes of walking.
Be certain that your horse is completely cooled down before you let him
have anything to eat or drink. Eating or drinking immediately after stren-
uous exercise can bring on a bout of colic.
 Care for those teeth: Horses that have problems chewing don’t properly
masticate their food before swallowing it, making them more susceptible
to impaction colic. Have a vet check your horse’s teeth at least twice a
year to determine whether they are healthy. (See Chapter 10 for details
on tooth care.)
204
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Equine influenza and rhinopneumonitis
People aren’t the only ones who get the flu. Horses have their own versions of
the virus, known as equine influenza and rhinopneumonitis (the latter caused
by the equine herpes virus). Like the human version of the flu, these viruses
spread across the country every fall and winter. They’re just as contagious as
the human version of the virus (not to humans, however!) and result in a res-
piratory infection that attacks the upper and lower respiratory tracts of the
horses it affects.
Although equine influenza and rhinopneumonitis are two different viruses,
they both cause the same symptoms, and veterinarians handle the two infec-
tions identically. If your horse has a mild case, he may just have a runny nose
and seem a bit lethargic for a few days. If his case is moderate to serious, he
runs a high fever, has runny eyes and nose, is coughing, and appears stiff.
He may also lose his appetite. Your vet will provide supportive care in the
form of fever reducers if your horse has an above-normal temperature and
may prescribe an antibiotic if a secondary bacterial infection is present.
You can reduce your horse’s chances of contracting equine influenza or
rhinopneumonitis in two ways:
 Vaccinate: The same as with the human flu vaccine, the equine version
is not foolproof. However, it can go a long way toward keeping your horse
from contracting the diseases. The number of times per year you need
to vaccinate your horse depends on how much exposure he receives
to other horses. Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations regarding
the frequency of flu/rhino vaccine. Check out Chapter 10 for more about
vaccinations.
 Practice equine hygiene: During flu/rhino season, which usually is in the
fall and winter, try to minimize your horse’s contact with other horses
that may be carrying the virus. Don’t allow him to sniff muzzles or drink
from the same trough as other horses, even those who appear healthy,
because horses can shed the virus before showing any symptoms of the
disease. If you board your horse, make sure that the stable management
requires all boarders to be current on their flu/rhino vaccines.
Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis
(EPM)
In recent years, a disease called equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM)
began affecting a small but still significant number of the U.S. equine popula-
tion. Although it was rather mysterious when it first appeared, veterinarians
now understand EPM fairly well.
205
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

A protozoa called Sarcocystis nerona causes EPM and is believed to be pre-
sent in the feces of affected opussums. The protozoa affects the spinal cord
and brain, resulting in a variety of possible symptoms, including uncoordi-
nated movement of some or all of the horse’s limbs, spastic movements of
one or more legs, tilted head, muscles that waste away in the face or one of
the hind legs, and seizures.
Diagnosing EPM isn’t easy. Sometimes a horse seems only slightly lame, or may
just perform poorly. Most often, a horse with EPM suffers from an obvious lack
of coordination, looking almost as if he is drunk when he walks. The only
way to diagnose EPM is through laboratory tests, even though they’re not
100 percent reliable. Diagnosis usually is confirmed only if the horse responds
to treatment, which consists of oral anti-protozoal medications.
To prevent EPM, you must keep opossums far away from your horse, which is
no easy feat, because opossums are common wildlife in most suburban and
rural areas. You can do much to keep opossums from contaminating your
horse’s feed, though. Follow these simple horsekeeping rules to prevent
opossums from soiling your horse’s food:
 Close it: Keep grain and other supplements in tightly lidded containers.
 Lift it: Feed your horse in a trough or bucket — never on the ground.
 Clean it: Wash feeders with soap and water on a regular basis.
 Toss it: Throw out feed that falls on the ground.
Eye problems
Horses sometimes come down with ailments that affect the eye. The most
common ones are corneal ulcers, equine recurrent uveitis, and cataracts.
 Corneal ulcers by far are the most common eye problem and often the
result of a foreign body entering the eye and causing damage to the cornea.
Bacteria can infect the damaged area and begin to erode the cornea.
(Some corneal ulcers seem to form for other reasons that vets aren’t
sure of.) Symptoms include squinting, tearing, and an obviously painful
eye. Treatment for this problem often requires application of ointment to
the eye several times a day until the ulcer heals. To help prevent corneal
ulcers, don’t let your horse hang his head out the window of a horse trailer,
where a foreign body can blow into his eye. If your horse shows signs of
eye discomfort, contact your vet immediately because corneal ulcers
worsen quickly without treatment.
206
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

 Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is the number one cause of blindness
in horses. This painful inflammatory condition has unknown causes,
although some researchers believe exposure to the leptospirosis bacte-
ria, believed to be carried by some wildlife and in contaminated streams
and ponds, may play a part in the development of ERU. (This bacteria
can be difficult to avoid, especially for horses that live in pastures with
natural water sources. A vaccine for leptospirosis exists, but there’s
some controversy about whether it can actually prevent ERU.) Anecdotal
evidence also suggests that Appaloosas are genetically prone to the dis-
ease. Symptoms include pain, tearing, and sensitivity to light. Treatment
involves the application of steroidal ointment in the eye to reduce inflam-
mation. Experimental treatment with medication implants is underway.
ERU eventually results in a loss of sight for the horse, but good manage-
ment of the condition can keep this from happening later rather than
sooner.
 Cataracts can develop in adult horses, but they’re most common in foals.
Cataracts are an opaqueness that forms in the lens of the eye and restricts
vision. The causes of equine cataracts are not completely understood,
although injury, diabetes, and ERU are three suspected culprits in adult
horses. A horse’s cataracts can be removed with surgery.
Gastric ulcers
Humans aren’t the only species that get stomach ulcers. Horses also are prone
to this malady. Equine gastric ulcers take place when the lining of the stomach
is eroded because of an overexposure to stomach acid that occurs when the
horse isn’t allowed to eat often enough and when the horse is under stress.
Gastric ulcers can be hard to diagnose because symptoms are subtle. Poor
appetite, an unattractive coat, and decreased activity all can be signs of 
gastric ulcers. Horses with severe cases repeatedly suffer bouts of colic 
(covered earlier in this chapter). They also have performance problems,
such as irritability during work and resisting work.
Diagnosing equine gastric ulcers requires use of an endoscope so the examin-
ing vet can see what is going on inside the stomach. Horses suffering from
gastric ulcers are prescribed more frequent feedings, more interaction with
other horses, and a decrease in grain. Some horses may require medication
for their ulcers.
To help prevent gastric ulcers, feed your horse frequently, and make sure
that he’s getting plenty of good-quality hay.
207
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

Heaves
Heaves is the common term for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
The illness is similar to asthma in humans in that the horse has difficulty breath-
ing in, and even more difficulty breathing out. Heaves causes inflammation
and spasm within the lungs and usually is brought on by airborne allergies to
mold, dust, and pollen, or by poor air quality. Horses suffering from heaves
may experience shortness of breath during exercise, chronic coughing, and
wheezing. Because heaves is chronic by definition, these symptoms persist
over a period of time.
Horses with heaves often have something called a heave line, which is a line
of developed muscle along the belly that forms as a result of the horse’s strug-
gle to push air out of his lungs. Presence of a heave line is a good way of
telling whether a horse suffers from heaves.
Veterinarians usually treat the disease by recommending changes in the horse’s
environment. In severe cases and to get the condition under control, a vet may
also prescribe corticosteroids, a bronchodilator, and possibly antibiotics.
Horses are born with a predisposition to heaves, but you still can do plenty
to help keep your horse from developing the condition:
 Supply good air. Horses need quality air to breathe, just like humans.
Try to give your horse as much ventilation as possible. If you’re stabling
him in a box stall, choose one that has ample windows so fresh air can
enter. Buy bedding and hay that is low in dust, and change the bedding
often to avoid ammonia build up. Avoid using straw bedding because
allergy-inducing mold spores flourish in it. (Check out Chapter 7 for
details on bedding and housing.)
 Move the horse: When cleaning your horse’s stall, move your horse out
of the immediate area so he doesn’t breathe in an excessive amount of
dust and other particles.
 Keep him outside: If your horse has a tendency toward heaves, keep
him outdoors in a pasture instead of in a stall.
 Feed low: Provide your horse with a feeder that requires him to keep his
head down when eating. Doing so encourages nasal drainage.
Although you want to keep your horse’s head down while he eats, don’t
feed your horse directly off the ground if he’s in a pasture or paddock
because he may ingest sand and develop colic (which we cover earlier
in this chapter).
208
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Skin problems
A number of different skin problems plague horses. Allergic reactions bring
on some of them, while others are the result of parasitic infections and vari-
ous other biological reactions. Five of the most common skin ailments are fly
allergies, fungal infections, hives, melanomas, and sarcoids. Each of these
problems has unique symptoms, causes, and treatments.
Fly allergies
For horses, flies are probably the worst thing in the world to be allergic to,
because where you have horses, you have flies. Sure, you can and should
do plenty to keep flies under control, but getting rid of them completely is
impossible. A fact of equine life is that flies are here to stay.
Flies are annoying enough to horses, but when a horse is allergic to these
obnoxious insects, the situation becomes unbearable. If your horse has areas
of skin that are scabby and itchy, and the flies are out in force, he probably
has a fly allergy. Your vet will recommend that you bathe your horse a couple
of times a week to remove the itchy scabs and apply a steroidal ointment on
a daily basis. The ointment is safe because it’s applied topically, and it may
contain an antibiotic, if the sores are infected. Your vet may also give your
horse a cortisone shot to relieve the inflammation or recommend regular
allergy shots to reduce your horse’s sensitivity to fly bites.
The only way to prevent your horse from developing a fly allergy is to keep
him from ever being bitten by a fly — a virtually impossible task. So, all you
can do is implement a strict pest control program in an effort to keep the fly
population under control (see Chapter 8 for tips) and minimize your horse’s
exposure to bites. You also need to use a fly mask, fly sheet, and fly-screen
leg wraps to minimize fly contact with your horse (see Chapter 6 for informa-
tion on these items.)
Fungal infections
Several different kinds of fungal organisms can affect a horse’s skin. Among
these culprits are rain scalds and ringworm. Each of these infections has dif-
ferent symptoms and treatments.
 Rain scalds (technically called dermatophilosis) is a genetic anomaly
that’s sort of a cross between a fungus and a bacteria. The organism
comes to life in damp weather and often shows up on horses when
weather conditions are wet, such as during rainy seasons or in tropical
regions.
209
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

The organism that causes rain scalds can only enter the skin at a break.
An insect bite or minor scratch that is invisible to your eye is all the organ-
ism needs to gain entry. After the condition takes hold, you see areas of
matted hair on your horse’s coat that look like paintbrush strokes. These
patches are mostly around the back area where the saddle lies, on the
hindquarters, and on the thighs. Crusty scabs accompany the matted coat.
Veterinarians usually recommend that rain scalds be treated with a 10 per-
cent iodine scrub. Exposure to sunlight also helps gets rid of rain scalds.
Keeping your horse dry in wet weather helps keep rain scalds away.
Give your horse adequate shelter to escape from rainy weather. If you
can’t keep him completely dry, provide him with a waterproof blanket
to wear during rainstorms.
 Ringworm is one or more round lesions on the horse’s skin, often found
near areas of the abdomen where the girth sits or on the back. The center
of the lesion is hairless, and can be raw or covered with a scab. Ringworm
is highly contagious to humans and other horses. The disease usually
occurs in the winter when the conditions are dark and damp and horses
are being kept indoors.
Ringworm actually goes away by itself in six to eight weeks, but to keep
it from spreading to other areas of the horse — and to other people and
animals — wash the lesion with Betadine scrub, which contains iodine
and is available from your local tack store. Aside from being sensitive to
iodine, ringworm also is sensitive to sunlight and dry conditions. You can
also treat the area with an over-the-counter ringworm medicine meant
for humans.
To prevent ringworm, keep your horse clean and dry. Sweat is a good
food source for the organism that causes ringworm, so wash or sponge
your horse down after every workout. Turn your horse out in the sun
frequently, because the organism also is sensitive to sunlight.
Another way to prevent ringworm is to avoid using tack and grooming
equipment that has been used on other horses. If you have to borrow
equipment, at least disinfect brushes, saddle pads, and other washable
items with a solution of mild bleach (one part bleach to four parts water).
Leave the solution on the item for eight minutes and then be sure to
rinse thoroughly, because bleach residue will irritate your horse’s skin.
Hives
Plenty of humans get hives, and they know how unpleasant these little lumps
can be. On horses, hives usually cover the entire body or a section of the body,
are anywhere from half an inch to a few inches in diameter, and are uniform
in shape. When you touch the hive, it gives to the pressure. Hives can be itchy
or not itchy, and swelling of the face and eyelids sometimes occurs with them.
In horses, just as in people, hives are the result of an allergic reaction to
a substance, either airborne or eaten. Horses prone to hives typically get
them from inhaling certain pollens and eating some feeds.
210
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Because hives are the result of an allergy, you can’t do much to prevent their
onset. Pay close attention to your horse and notice any possible outbreaks
right away. The sooner you address the problem, the less your horse suffers.
In severe cases, your vet may prescribe an antihistamine or give your horse a
corticosteroid injection. Your vet will also suggest removing the allergen from
your horse’s environment.
Melanomas
Melanomas are rather common tumors in horses. A predisposition to devel-
oping these tumors seems to exist in certain individual horses and in certain
breeds (Arabians and Percherons in particular). Horses that are gray in color-
ing also tend to develop melanomas as they age. In fact, 80 percent of gray
horses over the age of 15 develop melanomas.
Melanomas take on the form of black growths on or under the skin, usually
about an inch in diameter. Sometimes the lesions are hairless and ulcerated.
They can be single or clustered in groups and can grow rather large in size.
These tumors typically appear on the horse’s genitals (both male and female),
under the tail, near the anus, and on the eyelids, throat, and mouth, but they
can be found anywhere on the horse’s body.
In gray horses, melanomas usually are nonthreatening, slow-growing tumors.
You need only to remove them if they’re interfering with the horse’s function
(tumors on the anus can interfere with defecation, for example). Note: Gray
horses are the only mammals known to science that can host a cancer that is
not usually life-threatening.
In horses that aren’t gray, melanomas can be much more serious because
they can metastasize (spread to other areas of the body) quickly through
the bloodstream and affect the major organs. A melanoma in a horse that
isn’t gray usually is serious and should be surgically removed by a veterinar-
ian. If you notice any growths on your horse’s skin, contact your vet right
away.
Veterinarians have yet to discover a way to prevent melanomas.
Sarcoids
Sarcoids are common, benign skin tumors. You typically see them on the
horse’s head, stomach area, or legs. Sarcoids sometimes come in groups and
are usually about an inch to a few inches in size. They occasionally appear in
wounds that are healing.
Sarcoids are most commonly seen in two forms: flat sarcoids and proliferative
sarcoids. Veterinary researchers believe that sarcoids are the result of a virus,
although no conclusive evidence exists to prove this theory. Some sarcoids
are very aggressive and grow rapidly.
211
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

Veterinary science has yet to discover the exact cause of sarcoid tumors,
leaving horse owners with no way to prevent the problem. Treatment usually
involves removal of the tumor, either through conventional surgery, through
laser surgery, or by freezing it off using cryosurgery — although the tumors
sometimes return. Some veterinarians treat sarcoids with a topical cream
first before resorting to surgery, or they’ll combine topical treatment with
surgery to remove the tumor.
If you notice a lump anywhere on your horse, contact your veterinarian right
away.
Strangles
Strangles, a condition caused by bacteria known as Streptococcus equi, takes
hold around a horse’s neck and upper respiratory tract, forming abscesses
within the lymph nodes. The illness results in fever, lack of appetite, runny eyes
and nose, and a dry cough. The horse sometimes acts depressed and refuses
to eat, and stands with his head down. In more severe cases, the lymph nodes
enlarge (about two weeks after the disease hits) as abscesses develop. You can
see these abscesses as big lumps under the horse’s throatlatch (the area under
the jowl). Often, these lumps break open and drain externally.
Strangles is a contagious disease that spreads from one horse to another
through direct contact with secretions from the mouth and respiratory tract
that are left behind on food and water troughs or other objects. Flies also
spread it.
The only way to know for sure whether your horse has strangles is to have a
veterinarian examine him. If your horse is diagnosed with this disease, the
abscess that forms will be cut open and drained. Some vets also prescribe
antibiotics.
Many veterinarians recommend yearly inoculations with a strangles vaccine
to guard against the disease, especially if your horse is exposed to a number
of other horses.
To keep your horse from contracting strangles and other infectious diseases,
don’t allow him to drink from community watering troughs at horse shows
and other places where strange horses gather. Instead, bring your own bucket
and fill it with water when you horse needs a drink. Keep him from making
nose-to-nose contact with the other horses because any horse he meets is a
potential carrier of the disease.
212
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Thrush
Thrush, a bacterial infection of the foot, is one of the most common problems
afflicting horses today. Horses that don’t undergo regular feet cleaning are
prone to this disease. The bacteria can take hold only if the foot is routinely
packed with mud, soiled bedding, and manure for long periods of time.
Horses with thrush have a foul-smelling black discharge on the bottom of the
hoof surrounding the frog (the triangular-shaped area on the underside of
the hoof — see Chapter 2 for a diagram). When you scrape the bottom of the
hoof with a hoof pick, a clay-like material comes off, leaving deep grooves in
the hoof.
Left untreated, thrush can result in a more severe foot infection. The bacteria
also can damage the horse’s tendons. In serious cases, thrush can cause lame-
ness (which we cover later in this chapter).
If you suspect that your horse has a mild case of thrush (odor and some dis-
charge, but no lameness), you can try treating the condition yourself with an
over-the-counter thrush medication. If this treatment isn’t effective or if thrush
seems to be severe and causing your horse pain when he stands or walks, call
your veterinarian, who can treat the condition with more powerful medication.
If you provide your horse with good foot care, thrush is easy to keep at bay.
Follow these guidelines for healthy hooves:
 Clean ’em: Using a hoof pick, clean out your horse’s hooves every day
(see Chapter 9 for instructions).
 Keep ’em dry: The bacteria that causes thrush loves moisture. Keep your
horse’s feet dry by providing clean, dry bedding. Don’t let your horse
stand around in urine-soaked bedding or accumulated manure. Avoid
keeping your horse in a muddy paddock or pasture.
West Nile virus
West Nile virus was discovered in Uganda in 1937 but wasn’t diagnosed in the
United States until 1999. Since then, the disease spread from the East to the
West Coast through mosquitoes. After biting an infected bird, the mosquito
then bites a horse, injecting the virus into the horse’s bloodstream. One-third
of the horses that are bitten by an infected mosquito get sick. One-third of
these sick horses die from the disease.
213
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

The West Nile virus can cause mild-to-severe neurological symptoms in
horses, including lack of muscle coordination, stumbling and weak limbs
(ataxia), partial paralysis, muscle twitching (especially around the muzzle),
hypersensitivity to sight or sound, head drooping, lethargy, and depression.
Some horses fall asleep at inappropriate times, such as while eating. These
symptoms show up seven to 10 days after an infected mosquito bites the
horse. Some horses also run a fever early on in the disease. In cases where
horses are seriously affected by the disease, they can be left with permanent
neurological damage.
Treatment for West Nile virus includes supportive care to help the horse’s
body battle the effects of the organism. This care includes intravenous fluids
to prevent dehydration and anti-inflammatory drugs. An antibody for the West
Nile virus also has been introduced to help fight off the illness in horses.
The best way to protect your horse against West Nile virus is with an annual
vaccine (see Chapter 10 for details). You also need to practice mosquito con-
trol on your property by eliminating standing water where mosquitoes breed
(see Chapter 8 for details on pest control).
Getting a Grip on Leg Woes
Many of the ailments that plague horses are related to their legs, which prob-
ably has a great deal to do with the way people keep and ride horses. In the
wild, horses walk almost constantly as they graze, keeping their muscles loose
and flexible and their circulation up. Wild horses also trod on nicely cushioned,
plant-covered soils. Compare these scenarios to the life of stabled horses,
standing for hours on end as their muscles tighten and their joints become stiff.
Look, too, at the riding horses that regularly walk on tightly packed trails and
even asphalt and concrete. These same horses are asked to perform rather
unnatural maneuvers like trotting or cantering in tight, collected circles and
while jumping, and performing other discipline-specific maneuvers.
Another important part of the problem is that rather delicate bones, tendons,
and ligaments make up the equine leg. A horse’s legs are expected not only to
support the animal’s weight, but also the rider’s — on less-than-ideal footing
and during strenuous activity. Considering all these factors, you can easily
see why leg problems are so common.
The following sections take a look at the five most common leg ailments affect-
ing horses, and we tell you how you can help manage and prevent them.
214
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Arthritis
People aren’t the only ones who get arthritis. Horses do, too — and often.
Simply put, arthritis is an inflammation of a joint. It’s the most common form
of lameness in horses. Horses with arthritis limp — some very mildly, others
dramatically. (To find out how to determine whether your horse is lame, see
the nearby sidebar “Detecting lameness in your horse.”) Several different
forms of arthritis exist.
Degenerative joint disease
The most common type of arthritis is what is collectively known as degenera-
tive joint disease (DJD). This disease starts out mildly with an inflamed joint
capsule and can progress into erosion of the cartilage and fusion of the joint.
DJD can affect young and old horses, and the causes vary. Fifty to sixty percent
of the time, the hocks are the affected joints. The knees are the next most
common sites. Other joints such as the fetlocks and stifles can be affected, too,
although DJD in these joints tends to result in less lameness (see Chapter 2
for a diagram showing the parts of the horse). Poor conformation, hard work,
trauma, and old age are other main causes of arthritis (see Chapter 4 for
information on conformation).
Several treatments exist for DJD, and whether they’re used depends on the
severity of the problem. All are aimed at stopping the cycle of inflammation
and restoring the health of the joint fluid and joint surface cartilage.
You can’t always prevent arthritis, especially when it strikes a young horse or
when poor conformation is the cause. Sometimes, just the wear and tear of
carrying people around takes its toll on a horse’s joints. Honestly, nature didn’t
intend horses to carry humans around on their backs while doing dressage,
jumping, reining, and other equine sports. But shoeing your horse properly,
riding him on surfaces that provide good footing, and refraining from working
him too hard can help keep arthritis at bay.
You can also opt to give your horse intravenous hylauronic acid, Adequan,
yucca, chondrotin sulfates, and glucosamine as preventatives against DJD.
The use of these supplements is aimed at keeping the joint healthy before
arthritis sets in.
Ringbone
Ringbone is another type of arthritis that affects the pastern and coffin joints.
Extra bone development occurs around the joint or in the joint itself. When the
coffin joint is affected, the condition is termed low ringbone; when the pastern
joint is affected, it’s called high ringbone.
215
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

In the early stages of ringbone, bone development usually is mild and lame-
ness tends to be present but not severe. As the disease progresses, more of
the joint becomes affected and the lameness increases. In high ringbone, the
joint may actually fuse completely, which can be quite painful — most horses
with this problem are extremely lame.
Researchers don’t fully understand why horses develop this condition, but
they think that part of the problem is genetic and part has to do with uneven
trimming of the hooves. When the hooves are not trimmed completely level,
they land on the ground unevenly, causing trauma to the joint.
Treatment usually involves therapeutic shoeing, special trimming and shoeing
techniques that ensure a balanced foot. Shortening the toe during trimming
also helps to ease stress on the joint. All of the other arthritis treatments also
apply to this disease.
Because uneven trimming of the hooves can bring on ringbone, make sure
that you use a skilled and reputable farrier. See Chapter 10 for more about
finding a farrier.
Bowed tendons
Bowed tendons, or tendonitis, are a lower-leg problem. Bowed tendons occur
when tendons at the back of the leg become overstretched and strained or
torn. The back of the leg becomes very swollen, hot and painful to the touch,
and lameness usually results. Overexertion of the tendons either through
jumping, galloping, or galloping in deep footing causes bowed tendons.
A veterinarian usually uses an ultrasound of the affected tendons to diagnose
and determine the severity of the problem. Severely bowed tendons have tears
in the tendons, while mildly bowed tendons have swelling and enlargement.
Treatment is aimed at reducing the swelling by using icing, anti-inflammatory
drugs (such as phenylbutazone), and stall rest. All tendon injuries require long
periods — six months to a year — of rest and controlled exercise to heal prop-
erly. You can treat tendons that have tears in them with a drug called Bapten,
which helps the tendon heal to be stronger.
You can help prevent bowed tendons by providing proper shoeing and riding
sensibly in good footing that isn’t too deep, slippery, or muddy. Despite pre-
cautions, however, bowed tendons are sometimes unavoidable.
216
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Hoof abscesses
When an abscess forms in a horse’s hoof, it can cause severe lameness. The
abscess is an infection that starts at the bottom of the hoof or the sole and
travels up the lamina (also called the white line), and often breaks open at
the coronary band, where it drains. A puncture wound to the bottom of the
hoof usually causes the abscess. Horses with this problem appear fine one
day and suddenly very lame on one leg the next.
Vets base their diagnoses of hoof abscesses on symptoms of severe and sudden
lameness on one leg, increased pulse in the leg, and sensitivity to hoof testers.
Your veterinarian will make a final diagnosis when the abscess is found.
Treatment involves opening the abscess, which allows it to drain, and soaking
the hoof in Epsom salts. Soaking in a warm Epsom salts solution draws out
the pus from the abscess and kills the bacteria within it. Your horse also may
be prescribed anti-inflammatory/painkilling drugs such as bute or Banamine
or possibly antibiotics. Most horses recover fully from this problem in three
to five days and return to full, regular work without any problems.
Help prevent hoof abscesses by cleaning your horse’s feet daily and by getting
regular hoof trimmings from a competent farrier. Keep your horse’s bedding
clean and dry to discourage bacterial growth.
Laminitis
Laminitis, which also is known as founder, is a devastating disease that affects
an area within the hoof known as the sensitive lamina, the connective layer
between the hoof and the coffin bone that holds the coffin bone in place.
Laminitis occurs when the lamina becomes inflamed and the coffin bone
begins to separate from the hoof. With severe laminitis, the coffin bone may
actually come out of the bottom of the hoof.
In the milder forms of laminitis, the horse appears to be walking on eggshells,
moving tenderly on his feet. As the disease progresses, the horse feels greater
pain and adopts a rocked back stance, with his weight shifted toward his rear,
in an attempt to take weight off the front hooves. The horse also resists walk-
ing. As more damage occurs and subsequent pain develops, the horse starts
lying down often to take the weight off his feet.
Causes of this disease are plentiful and include trimming the feet too short, gal-
loping on hard ground, absorbing toxins from the gut during bouts with colic
(which we cover earlier in this chapter), eating too much grain, keeping the
horse on black walnut shavings, and sometimes, receiving steroid medications.
217
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

If your horse demonstrates sensitive hooves (particularly at the toe) and an
increased pulse in the leg, he may have laminitis. Consult your vet, who needs
to X-ray the affected hoof. Rotation, the separation of the bone from the hoof,
shows up on X rays.
Treatment of this disease varies depending on the severity of the problem.
The basics include complete stall rest on very soft footing (preferably soft
sand or very deep shavings), therapeutic shoeing, changes in the diet, admin-
istration of anti-inflammatory drugs such as phenylbutazone, Banamine, DMSO,
and drugs that increase the blood flow to the foot (acepromazine and nitro-
glycerine are two).
Laminitis can become so severe that the horse can die. If the horse survives,
he is prone to relapses. Each relapse means more damage, with chances of
recovery lessening with each episode. Many horses that survive also are lame
for life. If you find yourself in this situation, discuss your horse’s condition with
your veterinarian to determine whether the horse’s quality of life is such that
euthanasia may be warranted (see the section on “Coping with Euthanasia”
later in this chapter).
Provide proper shoeing; feed balanced diets that are not too rich in carbohy-
drates; and ride and stable your horse on good footing.
Navicular disease
Navicula disease involves a small bone called the navicular bone, which acts
as a fulcrum between something called the deep flexor tendon and the coffin
bone. Researchers still are debating exactly what causes the disease, but the
traditional belief is that it occurs when the bone undergoes degeneration
and — as a result of decreased circulation to the bone itself — forms cysts
and large channels inside its center. Horses with this problem typically are
lame in both front legs, and their pain tends to be isolated at the heel area.
A vet usually diagnoses this disease through the use of nerve blocks and X rays
of the navicular area. This disease has no cure, but the condition can be man-
aged. Treatment usually involves therapeutic shoeing (usually in the form of
a bar shoe, which is a type of horseshoe with a special bar at the bottom to
support the foot), drugs to help increase the blood flow to the navicular bone,
and anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs. In the most severe of cases, where
the horse stops improving with medication and shoeing, nerves to the heels
are cut so that the horse no longer feels the pain from the disease.
Prevention of this disease is difficult because researchers don’t fully know
how it develops. Veterinarians suspect a genetic link, so not breeding horses
with this problem may be a way of preventing of the disease. Be sure to pro-
vide proper shoeing, a balanced diet, and regular exercise to help avoid this
disease.
218
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Taking Care of Horse Wounds
If you spend much time around horses, you soon discover that first-aid
knowledge is a godsend. Horses are big animals, and they sometimes get
hurt. Knowing just what to do when an accident occurs not only helps your
horse, but also makes you a hero around the barn. You may just save your
horse’s life — or another’s — as you wait for the vet to arrive.
If your horse is injured, let him quiet down before attempting to release him
from any situation in which he may be trapped. Injured horses often thrash
about, sometimes causing injury to themselves and others. Horses that are
hurt often have trouble recognizing their owners and tend not to respond to
humans the way they normally do.
219
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles
Detecting lameness in your horse
Determining whether your horse is going lame,
and on which leg can be a tricky business.
Although some lamenesses are painfully obvious
to even the most casual observer, you need a
trained eye to detect the more subtle limps.
If you suspect your horse is limping, or if someone
else tells you your horse appears to be lame — a
common occurrence in the horse world because
lamenesses are most obvious while the horse is
being ridden — take these steps to help figure out
whether your horse indeed has a problem. (If he
does, a call to your veterinarian is in order.)
 Examine the legs: Do a visual inspection
of your horse’s legs, shoulders, and hips,
searching for swelling.
 Check the feet: Lift each of your horse’s feet
up one at a time and examine the frog and the
sole of the foot for bruises or foreign objects
(see Chapter 2 for a diagram showing parts
of the hoof). If the frog is filled with dirt, get
a hoof pick and clean it out so you can
clearly see around the frog. Check the out-
side of the hoof for cracks.
 Feel around: Run your hand down each of
your horse’s legs, feeling for heat, swelling,
cuts, or unusual bumps.
 Step back: Tie your horse up or ask some-
one to hold him. As your horse is standing,
check to see whether he’s putting his
weight evenly on all four feet. If one leg is
raised or cocked, it may be causing him
pain.
 View from the front: Most lamenesses are
visible when the horse is moving. If you’ve
been unable to locate any swelling or injury,
try watching your horse gait. Ask someone
to walk and trot your horse on a loose lead
rope. As the horse comes toward you,
notice whether his head bobs up as he
lands on one of his forelegs. The leg his
head bops up on is the lame leg. You can
also judge which leg is hurting by watching
the horse’s stride. The lame leg will move
faster with a shorter stride.
 View from the back:Have someone walk and
trot the horse on a loose line as you view
him from behind. If the horse’s hop rises
higher on one side as he moves, his hind leg
is lame on that side. The horse’s stride on
that leg is also faster and shorter.

Here are some important things to keep in mind when your horse is injured:
 Stay calm and call for help. Hysterics only frighten the horse further
and aggravate the situation.
 Make human safety first and foremost. If a human gets hurt trying to
help an injured horse, the human becomes the priority.
 Avoid contaminating a wound with bacteria. Before you handle any
wound on your horse, wash your hands first and wear latex gloves.
The first thing you need to do when your horse gets hurts is determine what
kind of wound your horse has suffered, and then act accordingly. The list that
follows tells you about the four most common horse wounds and what to do
about them.
 Abrasions: Abrasions are the most superficial of wounds. They tend to
result when a horse scrapes himself against something rough surface.
Abrasions can also happen when saddles or blankets fit poorly and rub
the skin away. As long as a fall doesn’t cause the abrasion, they’re not
usually critical, but they are among the most painful of wounds.
When treating an abrasion, stop the bleeding, cleanse the area with
Betadine scrub, and apply an antibiotic ointment. Do not bandage the
area. If the cause of the abrasion is a fall, call your veterinarian.
 Animal bites: Horses frequently bite each other, and on occasion, these
bites can be severe. Sometimes, horses also suffer bites from other ani-
mals like dogs, cats, and wildlife.
If your horse receives a deep bite from either another horse or another
animal, call your veterinarian right away. Bites tend to become easily
infected, and an injection of an antibiotic can ward off this possibility.
If your horse is bitten by another horse but the wound is superficial and
isn’t bleeding, you can leave it to heal on its own. Horse bites, however,
are susceptible to tetanus, so get your horse a tetanus shot if he hasn’t
been vaccinated within six months prior to the bite.
 Lacerations: A laceration is a cut anywhere on the horse’s body that can
be large or small or superficial or serious, depending on the size and
amount of bleeding.
If the wound seems minor, flush it out with water from a garden hose to
get rid of any foreign objects that may be inside. If dirt and other materi-
als continue to adhere to the skin, use water and Betadine scrub on a
sponge to gently clean it. Apply antibiotic ointment to the wound and let
it heal on its own.
If the laceration is large and deep, do not apply any ointments or sprays
and call your veterinarian immediately. Control the bleeding.
Note: When lacerations heal (both the major and minor kind), they can
develop something called proud flesh. Proud flesh is the normal first layer
220
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

of healing tissue that occurs in a wound. In horses, this first layer of tissue
tends to overproduce. When this condition occurs with your horse, you
need to have the vet come out and remove the proud flesh. The vet then
treats the area with a special ointment so the proud flesh won’t grow back.
 Puncture wounds: Puncture wounds are potentially the most serious of
wounds, because they tend to penetrate far into the horse’s flesh, deeply
implanting bacteria into the horse’s body.
Nails and other sharp objects that plunge straight into the skin usually
cause puncture wounds. Puncture wounds in hooves result from stepping
on protruding objects such as nails. If the wound is in the back third of
the hoof, bacteria may get into an area called the navicular bursa, where
an infection can travel up the entire leg and the horse can lose his life.
Don’t attempt to stop the bleeding, unless it’s profuse, but call a vet-
erinarian right away — especially if the wound is in the hoof. The vet
probably will opt to give the horse a series of antibiotic injections.
Heavy bleeding usually comes with serious equine wounds. Take these pre-
cautions if your horse is bleeding freely:
 Know the bleeding. Understanding the type of bleeding helps you gauge
the seriousness of it. If blood is spurting from your horse, chances are
that an artery is involved, and you need to take immediate action to stop
the flow. In the blood is dark and oozing, it’s coming from a vein and isn’t
immediately life-threatening.
 Keep the horse still. Calm your horse by talking softly to him and making
him stand in one place. Keep other people (especially children) and dogs
quiet. Hysterical people make for hysterical horses. The more the horse
moves around because he’s upset, the more the wound will bleed.
 Apply pressure. Regardless of whether the bleeding comes from an artery
or a vein, always bandage the wound securely. The pressure of the ban-
dage reduces the blood flow. If the bleeding is coming from an area that
is too large to bandage, hold a piece of gauze or other clean, absorbent
material firmly against the wound. If the blood is coming from an artery
and you don’t have a bandage or a cloth, use your bare hands to create
the pressure. (Wear a latex glove, if you can, to avoid infecting the wound.)
 Make a tourniquet. When an artery is spurting blood and regular pressure
won’t stop the flow, make a tourniquet. Tourniquets are most practical
for leg wounds. Wrap a clean towel or piece of cloth around the leg above
the wound (between the heart and the point of bleeding). Tighten the
tourniquet with your hands and tie it firmly until the blood flow stops.
Call a vet immediately, explain the situation, and get advice as to whether
the tourniquet will cause any harm. Your phone call also helps the vet-
erinarian determine the seriousness of the situation and how fast he or
she needs to get there. While waiting for the vet to arrive, loosen the
tourniquet every 15 minutes for a few minutes at a time to allow blood
to temporarily flow back into the leg.
221
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

Putting Together a First-Rate 
First-Aid Kit
Every good horseperson has a first-aid kit on hand to deal with any possible
emergencies that come up. What’s great about having an equine first-aid kit is
that many of the items in the kit also come in handy for humans.
Store your first-aid kit in an easily accessible place near your horse’s tack.
Make sure that you can get to it quickly in case of an emergency. The last
thing you need when you’re frantic is a first-aid kit you can’t find.
You can go out and buy yourself a preassembled equine first-aid kit at a tack
and feed store. Or you can put one together on your own. Most items for
your kit are available at your local drugstore. If you opt to create your own
kit, you need:
 Antibiotic ointment: Triple antibiotic ointments or Betadine provide the
best protection against infection for minor wounds.
 Antiseptic cleanser: Betadine scrub is your best choice and a staple for
every equine first-aid kit.
 Container: Use one of those medium-sized plastic bins that sell for a few
dollars at the discount store to hold all your first-aid supplies. You can
easily take this type of container with you whenever you travel to a horse
show or other event.
 Bandages: Elastic bandages made specifically for use on horses are
best. You have to purchase these at a tack store or through a mail-
order catalog.
 Disposable diapers: You can use disposable diapers, which are very
absorbent and thick, to apply pressure to lacerations.
 Gauze pads: Sterile gauze pads are useful when dealing with wounds,
abscesses, and other breaks in the skin. You can get a few different sizes
for use with varying types of wounds.
 Serrated knife: Because horses sometimes get tangled in ropes and other
equipment, a jagged knife is a good item to have in your kit. You can use
it to cut away an entrapping strap or rope.
 Lubricant: A product such as K-Y Jelly is useful for lubricating your ther-
mometer. Don’t use petroleum jelly, which can irritate the sensitive lining
of the rectum.
 Rubbing alcohol: You can use rubbing alcohol to disinfect your ther-
mometer between uses.
222
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

 Scissors: A pair of scissors is useful for cutting bandages and clothes in
an emergency.
 Tweezers: In the event your horse gets a splinter or other object lodged
in his skin, a pair of tweezers can come in handy.
 Veterinary or human rectal thermometer: A thermometer is good to have
around. If your horse seems ill, taking his temperature before calling the
vet helps give the doctor a better idea of what’s wrong.
Coping with Euthanasia
Sometimes, a horse’s illness is incurable. The horse may simply be too old
to fight off whatever it is that’s plaguing him. Or, the horse may be gravely ill
and veterinary science may be unable to provide any hope for the animal.
In many situations, care and treatment for a horse can be so costly that the
owner simply can’t afford to pursue it. In a number of these cases, a poor
prognosis makes trying at all unfeasible.
Euthanasia is the humane process of taking an animal’s life. Veterinarians use
a barbiturate, which they inject in large quantities into a horse’s bloodstream.
The drug stops brain function almost instantly, and the horse loses conscious-
ness. The horse then stops breathing, and his heartbeat ceases.
Euthanasia is a fact of horse ownership that no horse owner likes to think
about. At some point in your horse experience, you may have to cope with this
unfortunate reality. The following sections give you some helpful information.
Making a difficult decision
The decision to put your horse down is incredibly hard. You probably will
feel all kinds of emotions, the strongest of which is doubt. Humans are not
often put in the position of playing God, and when they suddenly find them-
selves forced to make a life and death decision over an animal they love, the
experience can be confusing and extremely upsetting.
Should you find yourself struggling with this terrible dilemma, remember that
the act of euthanasia can be a gift to a horse that is suffering. Without you to
make that decision and allow him a painless, dignified end, your horse will
undoubtedly suffer. Think about your horse’s quality of life and put yourself in
his place. Would you prefer to stay alive in his condition, or would a peaceful
death be a welcome relief? Thinking of the subject in these terms and seeking
your veterinarian’s advice can help you decide what’s best for your horse.
223
Chapter 11: Examining and Treating Equine Health Troubles

Handling the grief
Losing a beloved horse can be an incredibly painful experience. As your horse’s
caretaker, you feel profound loss, sadness, and even guilt. Your thinking process
at this time won’t be very rational, and even though you may think you did
something terrible by having your horse euthanized, in time, you’ll probably
realize that you made the right choice.
Sometimes, horse lovers can have difficulty finding a sympathetic ear when
they’re grieving. People who don’t care much for animals will tell you to just
“get over it,” or ask you what the big deal is. During your time of grieving, try
to surround yourself with other animal lovers who understand what you’re
going through.
During the past several years, a number of veterinary schools have set up grief
counseling hotlines for horse people and other pet owners who have lost a
beloved animal. A listing of these hotlines is in the Appendix of this book.
Make use of these services. They can help you work through the grieving
process and recover from your loss.
Knowing what happens 
to your horse’s remains
You may be wondering what happens to your horse’s remains after euthana-
sia. The sad reality is the disposal of equine remains is not as easy as it is
with smaller animal companions, such as dogs or cats.
If you’re fortunate enough to own a large amount of property and your zoning
laws allow it, consider burying your horse on your land. If you don’t have
land, another option is burial in a commercially run pet cemetery, if you can
afford it. It can cost upward of $1,000 to bury your horse in a pet cemetery,
depending on where you live.
Because most horse owners have neither the land nor the money to bury their
horses, they’re faced with the unpleasant reality of sending their horse’s body
to a rendering plant — the least expensive and most convenient method of
disposal. This method usually costs well under $200 for removal and disposal
of the body.
Another option is cremation. If you are fortunate enough to have a cremato-
rium near you that will accommodate a horse, you may choose this route as an
alternative to rendering or burial. Some or all of your horse’s ashes may be
returned to you for burial on your property or placement in an urn. Urns for
pet owners are available on the Internet and can be a nice final resting place
for your horse.

Chapter 12
Giving Up Your Horse
In This Chapter
 Determining whether you’ve outgrown your horse
 Selling a horse the humane way (and finding alternatives to selling)
U
nfortunately, nothing lasts forever, including human/horse relationships.
Your horse may get so old that you can no longer ride him. Perhaps
lifestyle changes prevent your having time for your horse. Maybe your first
horse has taught you so much that you’ve outgrown him. You may find your-
self wanting a horse that can provide a new challenge.
When these situations arise, do the right thing by your horse. He deserves it.
A horse isn’t an object to be discarded when he has outlived his usefulness.
Horses are feeling creatures capable of suffering, and so are deserving of 
consideration. In this chapter, we first warn you about the dangers of public
auctions and slaughterhouses, and then tell you about telltale signs that
you’ve outgrown your horse and provide several options on how to give up
your horse.
Beware of Killer Buyers
Every year, hundreds of thousands of horses are slaughtered and the meat
sold for human consumption in parts of Europe and Asia. This fate befalls not
only to old, lame animals, but young, rideable horses in their prime. How can
this be? A perfectly rideable horse can land at a slaughterhouse merely because
the horse was sold at an auction and purchased by a killer buyer. The killer
buyer gets the horse at a price that’s less than what the horse will be worth
as meat, making the animal worth more dead than alive.

In the United States, few regulations govern the transportation of slaughter-
bound horses. Consequently, the animals are crowded into double-decker
cattle trucks and sent on several-day journeys to slaughterhouses with no
food or water for the duration of the trip. All the horses suffer under these
conditions, but the infirm, the very old, and the very young suffer the most.
Debate rages in the horse world over the issue of slaughter. Some people
believe that slaughter is a practical solution for the disposal of thousands of
unwanted horses and argue that as soon as the horse arrives at the slaughter-
house, his death is quick and painless. Others offer proof that the end doesn’t
always come swiftly and feel that slaughter is no way for an animal to end up
after serving his life as a companion to humankind.
The opponents of horse slaughter succeeded in passing a law in California in
1999 to outlaw the practice of selling a horse for slaughter, although reports
of horses shipped out of state to be sold for this purpose abound. Humane
groups are currently working on national legislation to ban the practice of
horse slaughter in the United States, ending this method of horse disposal.
Until a nationwide ban on the practice is enacted, horses in the U.S. will con-
tinue to be slaughtered for human consumption elsewhere in the world. Some
experts believe that even a U.S. ban against horse slaughter won’t stop the
practice because many killer buyers will simply ship horses to Canada, where
horse slaughter is legal.
We aren’t telling you this news to bum you out, but rather to make you aware.
We want you to be aware of what happens to horses that are casually sold or
given away after they’ve outlived their usefulness, or are simply unwanted.
If you don’t give much thought to what happens to your horse after you sell
him, he’ll likely end up at a public auction, where he may be bought by a killer
buyer and shipped to slaughter.
We assume that you love your horse too much to see him end up this way.
With this fact in mind, we tell you how you can protect your horse so he
doesn’t find himself in this situation, while at the same time meeting your
own needs to get a different horse or get out of horse ownership altogether.
Figuring Out if You Need to Move On
You may have trouble imagining a time when you don’t want to or can’t ride
your companion anymore. Yet it happens to horse owners all the time. If you
lose interest in riding or if your horse can’t be ridden, your decision not to
ride your horse anymore is pretty cut-and-dried. But if you simply outgrow
your horse, the decision to stop riding him isn’t so easy. This is a gray area,
where the question of whether your skills have surpassed your horse’s skills
is a bit subjective. Emotions can muddle the situation even more, making the
decision an agonizing one.
226
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Seeing signs of outgrowing your horse
One day, you may look at your horse and realize that you’ve learned more
from him than you ever could have imagined. He served as your guide to an
exciting but uncertain world. But now you feel both comfortable and confident
in that world, and life with your horse is beginning to get a bit stagnant. If you
suspect you’re outgrowing your horse, certain signs can help you determine
the truth. Examine yourself for these feelings and situations:
 You used to love riding your horse, but you’re getting bored. You’ve
varied your riding routine and pursued different riding activities, but
nothing makes riding your horse fun. You’re certain the problem isn’t
riding itself because whenever you ride someone else’s horse, you find
the experience exhilarating.
 You enjoyed learning to ride on your horse, but now that you’re more
competent, you want to get involved in a competitive activity (see
Chapter 18 for details). Your horse is a great beginner’s horse but he’s
not a show horse. You have no hope of moving into competition if you
keep him as your mount.
 You feel you’ve mastered the basics of horsemanship and now want to
move up to the next level within your discipline so you can become a
better rider. Or, maybe you want to change to a different discipline
(see Chapter 14 for discipline details). Your horse is holding you back
because he doesn’t have the athletic ability to help you get to the next
level or to work in another discipline.
If any of these scenarios apply to you and your horse, talk with your trainer or
another equine expert who is familiar with both your riding ability and your
horse to see whether that person agrees that you’re outgrowing your horse.
Deciding your next step
When you’re certain that you’ve outgrown your horse, you must decide what
you’re going to do. If moving on in your riding is important to you, you need
to get a new horse. You can keep your first horse and care for him in addition
to your new horse, or you can find a new life for your first horse and replace
him with another horse.
If your urges to learn more aren’t more important than your relationship with
your horse, consider keeping him and continuing to ride him while taking
lessons on other horses, or put your desires to grow aside. Although many
horse people believe that you may be doing a disservice to yourself by fol-
lowing this latter option, there’s something to be said for loyalty, dedication,
and commitment to your old friend.
227
Chapter 12: Giving Up Your Horse

Looking at Options for Your Old Friend
After you make the decision to stop riding your first horse in favor of getting
another one (or even leaving the hobby completely), think long and hard
about what you’re going to do with Old Faithful. You can protect your horse
from the slaughterhouse, and we tell you how in the following sections.
Selling
Selling your horse outright is the riskiest option for your horse in terms of his
long-term future, especially if he’s in the upper age range (20 years or older).
Yet selling is the most common way of divesting oneself of an unwanted
horse. If you’re determined to sell your horse and recover your investment
but are concerned about where the horse ends up, follow these guidelines:
 Find out the meat market price for horses in your area (usually around
$1 per pound), and price your horse considerably higher than what he
would sell for at slaughter. This way, killer buyers won’t be interested
in him because they won’t be able to make money by reselling him for
slaughter.
 Don’t consign your horse to a public auction. The majority of horses
purchased for slaughter come from public auctions.
 Don’t sell your horse to a horse dealer who ships horses to slaughter
(ask him if you aren’t sure). Your horse may end up on a truck to the
slaughterhouse instead of being purchased by someone who wants to
ride him.
 Sell your horse only to a good home. Screen potential buyers by asking
them questions such as whether they’ve owned a horse before (and if
so, what happened to him), their intended uses for the horse, the type
of housing the horse will receive, and what they plan to do with your
horse when they no longer want him. Ask to see where the horse will be
kept, and check out the facilities to make sure they’re well maintained.
Watch the prospective buyer ride the horse, and think about whether
the horse is a good match for the buyer. If it doesn’t appear that the
horse and the buyer get along (the horse seems unhappy when being
ridden by this person), decline to sell the horse. Selling your horse to
someone who isn’t a good fit may result in your horse being resold at
some point down the line.
 Be cautious about potential buyers. Unscrupulous people in the horse
world sometimes pretend to be buying a horse to ride when in reality they
intend the animal for slaughter. Combat this problem by asking potential
buyers plenty of questions about themselves and their intent for the
228
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

horse, and don’t hesitate to say no if you get a bad feeling. Keeping your
horse’s price tag well above meat value helps keep these buyers away.
 Offer a buy-back option on the horse. Tell the buyer you want to buy
the horse back at the purchase price at any time in the horse’s life if the
owner decides he no longer wants the horse.
Leasing
If your horse is still healthy and sound, the best alternative to selling him is to
lease him (Chapter 4 has full details on leasing). When you lease your horse,
you still maintain control over his ultimate destiny while divesting yourself of
the time and financial responsibilities of ownership. In a lease situation, the
lessee pays you a sum for use of the horse, in addition to whatever other costs
you want to charge (board, shoes, and preventive veterinary care are the norm
in full leases). The lessee cares for and rides the horse while you collect the fee.
The three typical types of leases are
 A full lease, where someone rides and cares for your horse off your
premises.
 A full lease with stipulations, where the lessee rides and cares for your
horse on your property or at an approved facility.
 A partial lease, where the lessee shares use of the horse with you or
another partial lessee.
Some headaches come with leasing. If the horse develops a major health or
training problem, you need to get involved. If your lessee stops making pay-
ments to you or backs out of the lease, you have to deal with the problem. But
if you truly care about your horse’s future, leasing is surely the best way to go.
Donation to a program
If your horse is healthy and sound, donation to a special riding program is an
excellent alternative to selling him because most centers for therapeutic riding
accept donations of horses. Centers typically look for horses that are quiet,
gentle, and forgiving to inexperienced riders. In turn, the horse receives
excellent care. Plus, you may even be able to go visit him from time to time.
If you contact a therapeutic riding center and offer your horse for donation,
center personnel will want to evaluate the horse to make sure that he has the
right disposition for the job. If the horse passes muster, you can grant the
center legal possession and receive a charitable tax write-off for your trouble.
229
Chapter 12: Giving Up Your Horse

Although this option can be great for an older horse, we want to caution you
about two things regarding donating your horse:
 Make sure that you donate your horse to a legitimate organization. Con
artists often present themselves as representing a therapeutic riding
program when they’re really procuring free horses to sell for slaughter.
Ask for proof of the group’s nonprofit status, and pay their stables a
visit. If in doubt, contact your state government to determine whether
the group is registered as a nonprofit therapeutic riding program.
 Find out the therapeutic riding program’s policy on disposing of horses
who are no longer needed. Most therapeutic riding organizations euth-
anize horses that are too old or ill to perform their duties. However, some
organizations sell the horses for slaughter. Get the group’s policy in writ-
ing. If the group sells horses to slaughter, decline to donate your horse or
stipulate in writing that you’re donating your horse only if you’re allowed
to take the horse back or buy him back at meat price when he’s no longer
needed in the program. The horse may be returned to you when he is
very old and sick, but at least with this arrangement, you can have the
horse humanely euthanized instead of sending him off to slaughter.
Gift to a family member
If your horse is rideable but you’ve outgrown him, consider passing him along
to someone in your immediate family. Perhaps your oldest child is getting more
interested in riding and wants her own horse. Maybe your spouse hasn’t been
riding much but wants to and could benefit from the teachings of your old vet-
eran. Of course, this option only works if your family can afford to keep two
horses. If not, consider passing your horse along to a relative who seriously
wants to get into riding. You can sell the horse to your relative for a nominal fee
or even give the horse away, but only under one condition: that the relative
won’t eventually resell the horse, but will instead sell or give the horse back to
you. Get this agreement in writing so the relative feels obligated to stick to it.
Retirement
Probably the kindest option for an older horse is to retire him. Retirement is
also practical because older horses tend to be harder to sell. After years of ser-
vice, older horses often need and deserve a break from regular work. A pasture
is the best place for a retired horse, but you can’t put him out there and forget
about him. He still needs daily care, grooming, veterinary care, and TLC.
230
Part III: Taking Care of Your Horse 

Retiring a horse to pasture is a good idea, but retiring a horse to a stall or a
small, grassless paddock is not the best route to take. If your horse has noth-
ing to graze on and is confined in a small space, he will deteriorate due to the
lack of exercise and mental stimulation. If you don’t have your own pasture,
you can rent one, either at a boarding facility or a private equine property.
The most convenient arrangement is to board your horse in a pasture where
daily care is part of the boarding agreement. Even with this arrangement, try
to find a pasture that isn’t too far from where you live so you can check on
your horse on regular basis (see Chapter 7 for information on providing a
pasture for your horse).
If you can’t find a pasture where your horse receives daily care from the pas-
ture’s owner or management, you need to do the work yourself. Doing so means
grooming the horse, checking him for illness or injury, and providing him the
necessary medication or supplements.
Euthanasia
If you’re no longer riding your horse because he’s old and lame, and you can’t
afford to retire him, consider euthanasia. Although losing a companion after
all he’s done for you is painful, euthanizing him is a much kinder end than being
shipped off to slaughter. You can think of the minimal cost of the euthanasia
and disposal of the body (either by burial on your own property, cremation
by a pet cemetery, or livestock removal service to a rendering plant) as your
final gift to your old friend. See Chapter 11 for more information on euthanasia.

and in the saddle. Chapters in this part show you all the
different ways you can ride a horse. Along with descrip-

M
ost people associate horses with riding, and understandably so. Nearly
every equine image they’re exposed to depicts a human sitting on a
horse. But what most people don’t think about is that before you can get up
on the horse, you have to handle him from the ground.
Because horses are such large creatures — weighing nearly 10 times as much
as most humans — you need skill and tact (not to mention the tack!) to handle
them from the ground. The fact that most horses are gentle and enjoy human
company makes the job easier, but accidents still occur whenever humans are
careless. Even though most people worry about falling off when they ride,
humans actually are more vulnerable to horse-related injury while on the
ground.
In this chapter, we give you a crash course in horse handling from the ground
up. You’ll find out the safest and most effective ways to deal with your horse
before you get up on his back. As you discover how to handle your horse,
you’ll also explore the deep bond that develops between a human and a
horse just from hanging out together.
Establishing the Right Manners
Horses are herd animals, which means that they are genetically programmed
to be social. A big part of being social for a horse is fitting into the herd 

hierarchy. In horse-herd politics, a self-appointed leader tells the other
horses what to do. When you handle your horse on the ground, you become
the leader. If you get your horse’s buy-in, he listens to you and you have the
basis for a good relationship on the ground — one that translates into good
rapport in the saddle.
Understanding your responsibilities
Before you begin handling your horse from the ground, know that you have
certain responsibilities. As the leader of your small herd, you must hold 
up your end of the bargain by being firm, consistent, and confident. If you
aren’t, your horse will dismiss you as leader and take over the job himself.
Or, if you’re too rough, your horse may come to think of you as a predator
rather than a benevolent leader.
To help you establish the right tone with your horse, do the following:
 Be firm. When you handle your horse from the ground, remember that
you’re the one in charge, not the horse. Don’t allow your horse to push
you around — literally or figuratively. Don’t ever let the horse think that
he is the one making the decisions. If he ever tries to boss you around, 
a firm jerk on the lead rope and a loud “Quit!” should get the message
across.
 Be fair. Require the horse to do your bidding, but do so in a way that
shows compassion and understanding. For example, if you’re leading
your horse and he’s walking obediently beside you until a bale of hay
falls from a nearby rafter, scares the heck out of him, and makes him pull
away and nearly knock you off your feet, don’t punish the horse. He’s
merely reacting in a normal way to something outside of his control.
Instead, understand the circumstances of your horse’s misbehavior.
 Be patient. Think of your horse as a 1,000-pound toddler. Sometimes he
knows what he needs to do but doesn’t feel like doing it. Sometimes he’s
at a total loss and can’t figure out what you want. Have some compassion
for your horse; he’d much rather be out in a pasture eating with other
horses rather than doing things that make no sense to him. Think before
you react, make sure that your horse understands what you want before
you assume that he doesn’t, and above all, be patient.
 Be anger-free. Unfortunately, taking anger out on the ones who can’t
defend themselves is an all-too-human trait. Despite the horse’s large
size, he’s a rather gentle creature, quite vulnerable to the abuses of
humankind. (If you ever saw or read Black Beauty, you know what we
mean.) Never lose your temper with your horse and never take out your
daily frustrations on him.
236
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

 Be calm. Because horses are prey animals, they tend to be nervous
sorts. Whenever you’re around your horse, move slowly and speak qui-
etly. Loud voices and quick movements make horses nervous. And what-
ever you do, avoid waving your arms over your head when you’re
around a horse. For some reason, waving arms scare the daylights out of
some horses.
 Be consistent. Don’t be wishy-washy when you deal with your horse.
Expect the same behavior from him day in and day out. The more con-
sistent you are when you handle him, the more consistent he’ll be in his
responses to you.
Recognizing your horse’s responsibilities
Humans aren’t the only ones expected to act a certain way during on-the-
ground interactions. Horses need to have “good ground manners,” which
means they need to behave themselves when a human is handling them 
on the ground. Horses that do not have good ground manners are a hazard
and a liability, and need to be trained.
Good ground manners that you must expect from your horse include
 Standing still: When your horse is being haltered or tacked up, he needs
to stand quietly until you signal him that it’s time for him to move.
 Being nice: While you’re working around your horse, he needs to have a
pleasant attitude, meaning no attempts to bite or kick you and no threat-
ening facial expressions.
 Walking alongside: As you lead your horse, he should walk quietly
beside you, taking your cue as to speed and which direction to turn.
 Respecting your space: Your horse should always respect your physical
space, never intruding on it. He should respond immediately to your
requests for more space (see “Your horse crowds you” later in this chap-
ter for more about asking your horse for space).
Approaching Your Horse 
in the Stall or Pasture
Before you can do anything with your horse, you have to catch him. This
expression means approaching him in his stall or pasture, placing a halter
over his head, securing it, and leading him out. If your horse is well behaved
in this regard, this part is pretty easy. If he isn’t well behaved, you may have a
real tough job on your hands. Either way, handle the situation with safety
first and foremost in your mind.
237
Chapter 13: Working with Your Horse from the Ground

Retrieving your horse from a stall
Horses are much easier to catch when they’re in a stall or small paddock. The
horse realizes he has nowhere to go and rarely puts up a fight. The exception
to this rule is a horse that fears his handlers or simply hates to be handled,
both of which are the result of mistreatment.
Assuming that your horse likes you and doesn’t mind being caught, attach
the lead rope to your horse’s halter by snapping the lead rope clip onto the
ring of the halter (see Figure 13-1) and follow these steps when you go to
retrieve him from his stall:
1. Speak to your horse to let him know you’ve arrived before you enter
the stall or paddock.
2. Enter the stall or paddock.
3. Approach the horse at his left shoulder rather than directly at his
face. Horses can’t see directly under their noses or directly behind
them. If the horse’s hindquarters are facing you as you enter the stall or
paddock, make sure that the horse knows you’re there before you get
too close.
4. As you get closer to the horse, extend your hand, palm down, and let
the horse sniff you. This greeting assures the horse that you’re friend,
not foe.
5. Loop the other end of the lead rope around the horse’s neck and slip
the halter over his head. See “All Strapped In: Haltering Your Horse”
later in this chapter for details on how to put a halter on your horse.

238
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Heading toward your horse in a pasture
Catching a horse in a pasture can be tricky if the horse doesn’t want to be
caught. Fortunately, most horses don’t mind it and will cooperate, provided
the human handler approaches the horse in the right way.
Catching a horse in a pasture is different from catching him in a stall, because
in a pasture, the horse has much more room to move away from you. Follow
these steps for the best way to approach a horse that is loose in a pasture
with other horses:
1. Walk quietly toward the horse with your hands at your side and your
halter and lead rope in hand, making sure that he sees you.
2. Approach the horse at his left shoulder, never directly from the front
or back. As you make contact with the horse, gently pat or scratch his
neck, speaking softly.
3. Place the lead rope around the horse’s neck in a loop as you continue
speaking to him. Holding the noosed lead rope, proceed to put on the
halter as we describe in the next section.
Whatever you do, don’t let your horse get away without being caught. After
you make an attempt to catch the horse, keep trying until you succeed. If you
don’t, the horse quickly learns that capture can be easily eluded.
Some people take treats out in a pasture to help catch a horse, but we don’t
recommend doing so when other horses are in the pasture. The group may
get nasty and competitive with one another over the treats, leaving you vul-
nerable to a misplaced bite or kick.
Turning your horse loose in the pasture after you’re finished with him requires
some finesse, too, so that he doesn’t develop the habit of bolting away right
after you remove his halter. Take these precautions for a safe release:
 Noose the lead rope around the horse’s neck before you take the 
halter off.
 Secure the horse with the lead rope with your hand, and then slip the
halter off the horse’s head.
 Release the noose and allow the horse to walk away.
All Strapped In: Haltering Your Horse
The fundamental tool for controlling a horse on the ground is the halter. Most
horses are amenable to having a halter placed on their heads because
they’ve been wearing one since they were foals.
239
Chapter 13: Working with Your Horse from the Ground

Before placing the halter on your horse, check to make sure that the crown
strap of the halter is unbuckled and that the lead rope is attached. The hard-
est thing about learning to halter a horse is visualizing where all those straps
are supposed to go. Study horses wearing halters before you attempt to put
one on your horse. Become familiar with the way the straps sit on a horse,
and then hold a halter in your hand, imagining the horse’s head inside it. See
Chapter 6 for more details about halters.
Your horse needs to stand quietly as you halter him. If he doesn’t, you have a
behavior problem on your hands — one that a professional trainer or experi-
enced horseperson needs to deal with.
To halter your horse, follow these steps:
1. Facing the same direction as your horse while standing at his left
shoulder, place the lead rope in a loose loop around the middle of the
horse’s neck. Don’t tie the rope, but hold it together with your right
hand. Doing so secures the horse and keeps him from walking away from
you. When the lead rope is over the horse’s neck and the horse is stand-
ing still, you can release it momentarily so that your hands are free to
put on the halter.
2. With the buckle side of the strap in your left hand and the crown
strap in your right hand, slip the horse’s nose through the noseband
of the halter by reaching your right hand underneath the horse’s
neck, as shown in Figure 13-1.
3. When the horse’s nose is through the halter, bring the crown piece up
behind the horse’s ears and buckle it so the halter fits comfortably —
not too tight and not too loose.
4. Take the lead rope from around the horse’s neck and fold the excess
in your left hand while holding the attached rope just below the halter
with your right hand. You’re now ready to lead your horse out of his
stall or paddock.
On the Ropes: Leading Your Horse
Your role as your horse’s leader is never more literal than when you’re actu-
ally, physically leading him. Provided your horse is well trained and well
behaved and you’re confident and adept, leading a horse can be fun and easy.
Leading the right way
For safety reasons, you need to lead a horse the right way, and that means
standing on your horse’s left side and holding the end of the rope closest to 
240
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

your horse’s head in your right hand as described in the previous section.
Some other tips that can help you lead your horse the right way:
 Hold onto the lead rope with your right hand about 6 inches from the
halter. If your lead rope has a chain at the end, hold the rope just below
the chain so you don’t injure your hand if the horse pulls back.
If you find you need more control when leading your horse, gain it by
moving your hand closer to the halter.
 Never coil the remaining lead rope around your left hand. If you do
and the horse pulls back, the coil can tighten, trapping your hand.
 Always lead your horse from his left side. See Figure 13-2 for the cor-
rect position for leading a horse.
 Give the lead rope a gentle pull with your right hand as you begin to
walk forward. The horse should begin walking, keeping pace with you
so you remain at his shoulder.
 Turn the wrist on your right hand either left or right to turn your
horse in either direction. Turning the horse away from you is always
best because it keeps your toes away from his big clumsy hooves and
reinforces to the horse that he should stay out of your space Your horse
should follow your lead.
 Stop your horse by saying, “Whoa!” and by stopping yourself and
giving a backward tug on the rope with your right hand.
Figure 13-2:
You should
stay at your
horse’s left
shoulder

241
Chapter 13: Working with Your Horse from the Ground

When leading your horse, keep in mind that he doesn’t know which way you
intend to go at any given moment. Remember that your horse is much heav-
ier and longer than you, and can’t turn as fast or stop as quickly as you can
without warning. You know that you’re about to turn or stop, but your horse
doesn’t.
Refraining from bad habits
Try not to forget just how big your horse really is when you’re leading him.
It’s important, because if something should something happen — like your
horse spooks or starts to misbehave (see “Handling Problems from the
Ground” later in this chapter) — you can be in serious physical danger if you
aren’t leading the proper way.
Make sure you “don’t” fall into these bad habits when leading your horse:
 Don’t lead a horse by anything other than a halter and lead rope, or
the reins of a bridle. If leading by the reins, don’t loop them over the
horse’s neck while leading but rather hold them free instead. Don’t loop
them around your hand, either.
 Don’t coil or wrap the lead rope around your hand. If the horse pulls
back or runs off, the rope may tighten around your hand, and you can be
dragged.
 Don’t wrap your hand around the chain part of a lead rope (if your
lead rope has a chain, that is — not all do). If the horse pulls back, your
hand can be injured.
 Don’t put your hand in the halter to lead your horse in place using a
lead rope. If the horse bolts and your hand gets caught in the halter, you
may be dragged.
 Don’t walk in front of your horse with him trailing behind you. If your
horse suddenly bolts forward, you can be trampled.
 Don’t trot your horse when you’re leading him, unless someone is
evaluating the animal for lameness. Leading a trotting horse is difficult.
In Knots: Tying Your Horse
To tie up a horse so that he’s immobile while you’re saddling him, grooming
him, or doing anything else that requires him to stand still, you just take a
rope and tie him to a post. Right? Wrong. Although it may seem that simple,
tying a horse is anything but. Horses must be secured in just the right way or
they can get themselves into all kinds of trouble.
242
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Pulling back when frightened is one of the most common and dangerous
problems that occurs when a horse is tied (see “Your horse pulls back when
tied” later in this chapter for solutions to this problem). Another problem
involves the horse getting tangled up in the lead rope.
When tying a horse, follow these rules to ensure safety:
 Whenever possible, tie a horse in crossties, which are two ropes on
either side of the horse that attach to the sides of the horse’s halter.
Crossties need to be about the same height as the top of the horse’s
shoulders. (See Figure 13-3 to see what crossties look like.) Tying a
horse in crossties is much safer than tying a horse to a hitching post 
or other object.
Make sure that your horse is familiar with the feeling of being crosstied
before you tie him this way. Gradually get him used to the idea by
attaching one crosstie to his halter first and your lead rope to the other.
That way, he gets used to the pull that comes from the crosstie without
being completely confined in it.
And make sure that the crossties have a breakaway feature so the horse
won’t get hung up in the ties if he panics and thrashes around. Quick-
release snaps are a good feature to have on crossties, so a frightened
horse can be turned loose if he’s in danger of hurting himself or some-
one else. Consider buying a cotton lead rope that’s affixed to a panic or
quick-release snap that you can release whenever the horse pulls back
or gets tangled up. This rope is the safest kind for tying. You can also tie
a piece of baling twine between the crosstie and the ring that attaches it
to the post. In the event of an emergency, the twine will break instead of
the halter or crosstie.
 Tie a horse only by a halter and lead rope, or halter and crossties.
Never tie a horse by the reins of a bridle. If the horse pulls back, the
reins can break and the bit may damage the horse’s jaw.
 Tie a horse only to an immovable object. Horses need to be tied to
solid fence posts, hitching posts made for this purpose, horse trailers
hooked to a truck, crossties, or, if on the trail, to strong, secure tree
trunks. The rope needs to be tied so that its height is stable and won’t
slip down toward the ground. Horses are strong, and if they spook and
pull back when tied to something that isn’t secure, they can drag the
object or pull it right out of the ground.
 When tying a horse with a lead rope, use a safety, or quick-release,
knot. The knot can be released in an emergency by pulling on the loose
end. Practice tying a safety knot and make sure you know precisely how
to tie it before you use it to secure a horse. See Figure 13-4 for instruc-
tions on tying a safety knot.
243
Chapter 13: Working with Your Horse from the Ground

 Always tie a horse with the knot at about the level of the horse’s with-
ers, with no more than 3 feet of rope from the post to the halter. Doing
so keeps the horse from getting the rope over his head or from getting a
leg caught in it. See Figure 13-5 for a drawing of a horse safely tied.
 Never tie a horse with a chain shank run through his halter. If the
horse pulls back, the chain can injure him.
 Never leave a horse alone and unsupervised when tied up. You’d be
amazed at how quickly a tied horse can get into trouble.

Circle Around: Longeing Your Horse
Riding is only one way of exercising your horse. You can also do something
called longeing, where you stand in the center of an imaginary 60-foot circle
as your horse, attached to a rope that you’re holding, moves around you.
Why longe your horse? Can’t you just ride the horse for exercise? You can,
but then you’d be passing up on all the benefits that longeing provides you
and your horse. For example:
 Longeing is a way of providing controlled exercise to your horse on
days that you can’t ride. It’s safer than turning a horse out to run
around on his own because with longeing, you can control the horse’s
behavior and keep him from doing something to hurt himself.
 Longeing before riding helps a horse get rid of excess energy that can
create problems when you’re in the saddle.
 Longeing teaches your horse to respect your authority and respond to
voice commands.
The following sections tell you what you need to know to prepare your horse
for longeing and longe your horse the right way.
Readying your horse for longeing
Before you can longe your horse, you must have the proper tools. These
include:
 A 25- to 30-foot long cotton longe line to attach to the horse and hold in
your hand
Figure 13-5:
A horse is
safely tied
when there
is no more
than 3 feet
of rope
between the

post.
245
Chapter 13: Working with Your Horse from the Ground

 A halter, longeing cavesson, or English snaffle bridle to go over the
horse’s head and attach to the longe line. Figure 13-6 shows how to 
rig up a horse for longeing (see Chapter 6 for more about these pieces 
of gear):
• If you’re longeing your horse with a halter, attach the longe line to
the halter by running the clip end of the longe line through the ring
on the left side of the halter, pulling the longe line up over the
horse’s ears, and then clipping it to the ring on the right side of the
halter. Make sure that the halter is snug so that it doesn’t slide
sideways on the horse’s head when you begin longeing.
• If you’re using a longeing cavesson, outfit the horse with the caves-
son and attach the longe line to the cavesson, by clipping the longe
line to the ring on the cavesson in the center of the top of the nose-
band, which should be about 4 inches above the horse’s nostrils.
Make sure that the cavesson is snug on the horse’s head so that it
doesn’t slide around.
• If you use a snaffle bridle, outfit the horse in the bridle, prepare the
reins, and attach the longe line to the bridle. Secure the reins by
putting them over the horse’s head as if you were going to ride,
twisting them a few times, unbuckling the throatlatch, and then
rebuckling the throatlatch with the reins underneath so they don’t
swing when the horse moves. Attach the longe line to the bridle by
running the clip end of the longe line through the left bit ring and
up over the horse’s head behind the ears. Clip the longe line to the
bit ring on the other side of the bridle.
 A longe whip to encourage the horse to move forward (see Chapter 6 for
details on this tool)
 A secure, fenced area with good footing (not wet and slippery, and not
hard) big enough to longe your horse
 Leather gloves to help you keep a good grip on the longe line and to pro-
tect your hands
Before you start longeing the horse, you need to properly prepare and fit the
previously listed equipment. Have an experienced horse person who knows
how to longe help you the first few times you try.
If you plan to ride your horse after longeing him, you want to tack up the
horse in his saddle, tightening the girth or cinch securely. Likewise, if you
ride in an English saddle, be sure that the stirrup irons are run up to the top
of the leathers so the irons don’t bounce against the horse when he’s moving.
Wrap the leathers tightly around the irons to secure them. See Chapter 15 for
more about tacking up your horse.
246
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Before you attempt to longe your horse, make sure that the horse has been
trained to longe. If you’re not sure whether he’s been longed, ask an experi-
enced horse person to try longeing the horse to see whether the animal
knows what’s expected of him.
Longeing your horse properly and safely
If your horse is trained to longe and obedient, longeing can be an easy task,
after you know what you’re doing. Realize, though, that longeing takes practice.
We strongly recommend having an experienced horse person help you the
first few times you longe your horse to make sure that you and the horse are
doing it right.
Take these steps when longeing your horse (Figure 13-7 shows the proper
lunging position):
1. Prepare your horse as described in the previous section, and take
your horse to a secure area with plenty of room to work.
2. Imagine a large circle, and position your horse so that he’s prepared
to move in a clockwise direction on that circle. Hold the part of the
longe line attached to the horse’s head in your right hand. Fold up the
excess longe line in your left hand. Hold the longe whip in your left
hand, too.
3. Tell your horse “Whoa!” and step away from the animal. As you back
up, feed out some of the excess longe line loosely so you don’t pull on
the horse’s head. If your horse tries to follow you, tell him “Whoa!” until
he stops.

4. Back up until you’re about 4 feet from the horse. Point the longe whip
toward the horse’s hindquarters. If your horse knows voice commands,
tell him to “walk out.” If not, cluck to the horse to get him to walk for-
ward. As the horse starts to move, slowly back up until you’re about 10
feet away from him.
5. Adjust your position relative to the horse. You should be standing at
the top of an imaginary triangle in which the horse’s body serves as the
base, with the longe line and longe whip as the other two sides. Your
body should at an angle that puts you behind the horse’s eye. Staying in
this position keeps the horse moving forward.
Keep the horse walking in a clockwise direction for five minutes.
6. Change directions. Point the whip upright and tell the horse “Whoa!”
When the horse stops, slowly approach his head, taking up the slack in
the longe line as you go. Be sure to keep the whip pointing up so you
don’t confuse the horse.
7. Place your hand on the longe line about 4 inches from where it
attaches to the horse’s head. Turn the horse around so he faces the
opposite direction. Reverse the position of the longe line and whip. You
now should be holding the part of the longe line attached to the horse in
your left hand and the excess longe line and whip in your right.
8. Ask the horse to “walk out” again, adjusting your position as in Step 5.
Work your horse at different speeds, changing direction every five min-
utes. To get the horse to go faster, tell the horse “Trot on” and then
“Canter.” If the horse doesn’t know voice commands, cluck until the
horse speeds up to the gait you’re looking for. Cluck to the horse again if
he breaks into a slower gait.
9. To stop, step slightly out of your position so that you are even with the
horse’s head, and say “Whoa!” The horse should halt on command.

position for

10. If your horse has worked up a sweat on the longe line, cool him down
by walking him for at least 10 to 15 minutes, either on the longe line
or by leading him, using the longe line as a lead rope.
Safety issues abound on the subject of longeing. Keep all of these points in
mind when exercising your horse this way:
 Longe your horse only in an enclosed area in case he somehow gets
away from you.
 Get help while you’re new to longeing. Make sure that your horse is
quiet and well behaved while longeing before you start doing it on your
own.
 Don’t longe for long periods (20 minutes is more than enough), or too
often (twice a week maximum). Exercising in a tight circle is hard on the
horse’s legs. Give your horse plenty of walking breaks, especially if he’s
out of shape. If your horse isn’t used to being longed, build up slowly to
longer work periods, starting out with a 10-minute session and gradually
moving up in 5-minute increments per week.
 Never loop, coil, or wrap the excess longe line around your hand. You
can be seriously injured if the horse pulls away from you.
 Some horses get spunky when they’re longeing, so stay far enough
away that you won’t be kicked if the horse start frolicking on the
longe line.
 Be cautious with the longe whip. Don’t use it to strike your horse, and
be careful not to wave it around, especially in the horse’s direction.
 Try not to talk while you’re longeing except to give voice commands
to your horse. That way you won’t confuse your horse.
 When giving voice commands, carefully enunciate and differentiate
each command so the horse can distinguish between them.
Handling Problems from the Ground
Sometimes, no matter how hard you try to do things right, your horse may
make handling from the ground difficult for you. Horses are much like small
children — they easily develop bad habits and often test you to see what
they can get away with. At times, their misbehavior comes from fear; other
times, it stems from sheer boredom or lack of training.
The way you handle problem behaviors on the ground is important. If your
horse discovers that he can get away with naughty behavior, he will keep doing
it, and eventually, you’ll have a serious problem on your hands. Conversely, if
you let your horse know that you’re wise to these shenanigans and you’re con-
sistent in correcting the bad behaviors, he soon gives up that bad behavior.
249
Chapter 13: Working with Your Horse from the Ground

The following sections cover some typical stunts that horses pull when you’re
handling them on the ground and ways you can combat these behaviors.
Your horse resists being caught
Refusing to be caught is a much bigger problem with horses that live out in a
pasture with other horses. Horses who have been worked hard or don’t enjoy
being around humans all that much, because they’ve been mistreated in the
past, may come to associate being caught with something unpleasant. Horses
that that experience pain or discomfort when being ridden often resist capture.
If your horse is hard to catch, consider having him checked out by a veteri-
narian to make sure the he isn’t experiencing pain somewhere in his body
that is being exacerbated with riding. If your horse refuses to be caught — or
at least gives you a good run for your money before allowing you to get close
(even though you’ve tried catching him by using the method we describe ear-
lier “Heading toward your horse in a pasture”), the horse needs to be recon-
ditioned to associate being caught with something pleasant. If he has a health
problem, it needs to be resolved before you can begin retraining him.
Practice catching him alone in a small enclosure by using this method:
1. Arm yourself with a favorite treat like a carrot or slice of apple.
2. Attempt to approach the horse by using the method described in the
earlier “Heading toward your horse in a pasture” section. Don’t bring
a halter with you because you’re only practicing right now. Be noncha-
lant about your approach, and don’t look the horse right in the eye.
3. As you get closer to the horse, extend your hand so the horse sees the
treat. The horse probably will let you approach or may even walk
toward you to get the treat.
4. When you make contact with the horse, give him the treat, scratch
him on the withers or in his favorite spot, and then walk away before
he has a chance to leave. Practice this a number of times over a period
of a few days until the horse seems comfortable with your approach.
5. Begin placing the halter on the horse after you give him the treat.
Don’t take him out of the enclosure, though. Simply halter him, give 
him his treat, scratch him where he likes it, then remove the halter 
and leave.
When you get the feeling that the horse is comfortable with this routine,
move the horse to a larger enclosure and practice the same method for a
couple of weeks, alternating times that you take him out of his enclosure
to ride him, and times that you just halter him and remove the halter
and leave him alone.
250
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Make sure that you don’t overwork or mistreat the horse after you take
him out of the enclosure. Many horses don’t like to be caught because
they’re unhappy about what happens to them after they leave their 
pasture.
6. After several weeks of practice, you can move your horse back to the
original pasture and try this method in this larger area. If other horses
share the pasture, you have to skip the treats, because things can get
dangerous if the other horses start fighting over the food. Instead of
treats, give lots of scratches and kind words.
If, after a month or so of working on this problem, you’re not getting any-
where with your difficult-to-catch horse, you need to call in a profes-
sional trainer for help.

Chapter 13: Working with Your Horse from the Ground
Jailbreak! Catching a runaway horse
Nothing can disrupt the quiet atmosphere of a
stable like a horse that has gotten loose from his
handler. The cry “loose horse!” makes human
heads go up in a flash.
Something strange happens when a horse gets
loose at a stable. After they realize what’s going
on, other horses get excited and start bucking,
whinnying, and dancing around. Here are some
pointers on how to cope when an errant horse
makes a bid for freedom.
 Don’t panic. Stay calm and shout “loose
horse!” at the top of your lungs to warn other
people that an escapee is on the premises.
 If the escapee isn’t your charge, but you’re
leading, riding, or standing next to your
own horse when the culprit gets loose, be
aware that your horse is probably going to
react with excitement when he discovers
what’s happening. Stop in your tracks and
dismount or untie your horse quickly. Hold
on to your horse tightly and be prepared for
some dancing around.
 If a horse you’re handling gets away from
you, don’t chase him. Chasing the horse
only makes him run away from you with
increasing speed.
 Walk slowly in the direction your horse ran
to see where he’s gone. Most horses that
escape from a handler in a familiar setting
don’t go far — usually to the nearest food
storage area. If you find that he stopped
somewhere to eat, speak softly and walk up
to him slowly, placing a lead rope around
his neck to secure him. Remember not to
give off any vibes that you’re angry — if you
do, the horse won’t let you get close.
 If your loose horse is not eating but just
milling around, get a handful of hay or a
carrot and slowly walk in his direction.
After the horse sees you, stand still and
offer him the food in an outstretched hand
as you speak softly to him. Most horses are
more than happy to exchange their new-
found freedom for a bite of something tasty.
While the sellout is happily munching away,
slowly place a lead rope around his neck.
 If your loose horse has stopped to eat, but
takes off again when he sees you approach-
ing, you need the help of one or two other
people. Arm yourselves with halters, and
walk in different directions with the idea of
surrounding him by blocking all his exits.
Most horses will realize their defeat and
allow themselves to be caught.

Your horse drags you when you lead
Few things are as aggravating as having a horse drag you when you lead him.
Plenty of horses demonstrate this bad habit, and it requires work to correct.
Try the following techniques to cope with a horse that likes to drag you:
 Lead the horse in a bridle instead of a halter and lead rope. The bridle
gives you more control and makes the horse less likely to rush forward.
 Keep the horse’s head bent slightly to the left to keep the horse from
pushing into you.
 Repeatedly ask your horse to stop, then walk, on your command. This
repetition reinforces that he must stay with you and not drag you.
 Ask an experienced horse person to help you affix a stud chain (an 8-
inch chain made for use on horses) to the horse’s halter that goes over
the bridge of the nose. This chain makes pulling you along as you lead
him uncomfortable for the horse.
If you’re a newcomer to horses and find yourself handling a horse that
repeatedly drags you whenever you try to walk alongside him, you have a
serious problem. Have someone experienced handle this horse and work on
solving the problem before you try to lead the horse. The experienced han-
dler can teach the horse not to drag and can teach you what to do to avoid
being dragged. Horses that are prone to dragging tend to pull this stunt even
more with inexperienced horse people.
Your horse pulls back when tied
Horses that are in the habit of pulling back when tied create terrible prob-
lems for owners. Some horses are so bad about pulling back that they can’t
be tied at all and must be held by hand whenever they need to be secured.
Occasionally, a horse pulls back when something frightens him at the tie rack.
You can’t miss it when this happens: The horse gets a terrified look in his eye
and throws all of his weight on his haunches, practically sitting down as he
pulls with all his might against his halter. If the horse breaks loose once or
twice during such an incident, it can be the beginning of a bad habit — the
horse has discovered that pulling back means freedom. Follow these guidelines
to ensure that your horse doesn’t develop the terrible habit of pulling back:
 Always tie your horse to something secure, using a lead rope or
crossties. See the earlier section “In Knots: Tying Your Horse.”
 Tie your horse securely with a safety knot, using an unbreakable
halter and lead rope.
252
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

 Don’t tie your horse with too little rope. If the horse feels he can’t move
his head much, he may become claustrophobic and pull back.
 Be careful about how you approach your horse when he’s tied. Don’t
come at the horse suddenly with a strange object, spray the horse in the
face or upper body with water or fly spray, or do anything else that may
spook him and make him pull to get away.
 Anticipate what’s likely to scare your horse. If you have to do some-
thing to the horse’s head that frightens or upsets him — applying eye
medicine, for example — untie the rope first and hold the horse yourself
so he doesn’t have an opportunity to pull back when tied.
If a horse pulls back when tied to a hitching post or other object, try the fol-
lowing to get the horse to stop pulling:
 Pull on the loose end of the safety knot to release the horse from
being tied. Be sure to take hold of the rope so the horse can’t run away.
Don’t allow the horse to break the halter.
 Step behind the horse (well out of kicking range) and shout at him.
The horse will move forward to get away from you.
Be aware that when one horse pulls back, the other horses tied with him at
the same post often pull back, too.
If you have a horse that is a chronic puller, enlist the help of a professional
horse trainer to break this difficult-to-change habit.
Your horse bites you
Most horses are pleasant creatures, but you may run across one that is the
equine equivalent of a crabby 2-year-old. These grumpy-grouches may be
wonderful when you’re riding them, but they try to bite you when you handle
them from the ground.
Horses usually bite humans for one of two reasons: to play or to send an
aggressive message. Either way, the results are the same — an extremely
painful bite that usually leaves black and blue marks on tender human skin.
Some horses bite because they’re in constant pain or because they’re experi-
encing pain when being ridden and they now associate being handled and
ridden with discomfort. If your horse is a biter, have him checked out by a
vet to make sure he doesn’t have a medical issue behind his bad attitude.
253
Chapter 13: Working with Your Horse from the Ground

Most horses are taught at a young age not to bite humans in play or out of
aggressiveness. Horses that haven’t learned this lesson, however, must be
trained in adulthood. If you have a horse that tries to bite you when you’re
grooming or leading him, follow these guidelines to break the habit:
 If your horse bites you or attempts to bite you, respond immediately
by yelling “Quit!” and jerking once on the lead rope.
 Get to know your horse and anticipate when he may try to bite. If he
bites when you’re grooming him, let him bang his head into your raised
elbow as he turns around to bite. If he tries to bite you when you’re lead-
ing him, hold your fist up near his mouth so he bangs into your knuckles
when he swings his head around to bite.
We like the idea of feeding treats to horses, because we think it helps develop
the bond between horse and human. However, if your horse is the nippy
type, we recommend that you don’t give him treats by hand, and instead,
leave goodies for him in his feeder. Check out Chapter 6 for more info about
feeding your horse.
Your horse kicks you
Kicking is a maneuver that nature gave horses to help protect them against
predators. Unfortunately, it’s also a maneuver that gets used on humans now
and then (usually only with one hind leg rather than both at the same time).
Although most horses don’t go around kicking people, enough do to make
this behavior worth mentioning.
Most horses kick only when startled from behind; others kick deliberately to
keep humans from doing something the horse finds unpleasant. Whatever the
cause, a well-placed kick from a shod horse can do serious damage to the
human body.
Here are some pointers to avoid getting kicked by a horse:
 Never approach a horse directly from behind, because this area is one
of a horse’s blind spots. Instead approach from the side, all the while
speaking to the horse so he clearly knows you’re coming.
 If you must walk past a horse from behind, give the horse plenty of
room. Walk far enough away so the horse’s back leg can’t reach you. If
you don’t have that much room, the next best alternative is to walk so
close to the horse’s hindquarters that you’re nearly touching them. If
the horse moves to kick, you’ll only be bumped by his hock and not
kicked by his hoof.
 If a horse suddenly turns his rump toward you, pinning his ears at the
same time, the horse is threatening to kick you. Yell “Quit!” as loud as
you can and quickly get out of range.
254
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

 If you’re grooming or saddling a horse, and the horse pins his ears
and kicks out at you, yell “Quit!” and slap the horse with an open
hand on the shoulder or side. Don’t run away and leave the horse
alone, which only reinforces the bad behavior. If your horse always
reacts with a kick or kick threat when you groom a particular spot or
tighten the cinch, consider whatever you’re doing as potentially causing
the horse pain. Have a veterinarian check out the horse.
 If you find yourself dealing with a chronic kicker, get help from a pro-
fessional trainer to fix this dangerous habit.
Your horse crowds you
Well-trained horses learn at a young age to respect humans. They know that
when a human is standing nearby, they shouldn’t crowd or invade that
person’s space.
Horses who haven’t been taught this lesson can be downright bratty when it
comes to crowding. Although most horses don’t have any intention of hurting
you when they crowd, their sheer bulk can cause injury regardless of their
intent.
If you find yourself dealing with a horse who repeatedly pushes into you
when you’re leading him, grooming him, or going into his stall or pasture, you
have a crowder on your hands — a horse that needs professional help.
If your horse is generally well behaved in this area, make sure that the horse
stays that way by following these rules:
 Make sure that your horse always gives way to you when you ask him
to move. When you push on your horse’s shoulder or hindquarters from
the side, he should willingly move away from you. Practice this move-
ment with your horse every so often to remind the horse that he needs
to respect your space.
 Never allow your horse to push you up against a wall or other object.
If he does, yell “Quit!” at the horse and slap him with a flat palm on the
shoulder or side.
 Don’t let your horse get away with crowding you when you’re leading
him. If the horse starts coming into your space, use your right elbow to
jab him in the shoulder.

Selecting a Riding Discipline
In This Chapter
 Getting to know the most common riding disciplines
 Looking at other interesting riding styles
O
ne of the coolest things about horseback riding is that you can ride in
so many different ways. Humans have been riding horses for thousands
of years, so they’ve had plenty of time to create a whole bunch of different
styles (disciplines in horse lingo), many of which still are in use today.
Before you buy a horse or even take riding lessons, you have to figure out
which discipline is for you. Don’t, however, confuse discipline with sport.
One discipline can cover several sports. For example, cutting is just one of
many sports within the western riding discipline. For a rundown of different
equine sports, see Chapter 18.
In this chapter, we describe the most common forms of riding to help you get
a handle on the style you want to pursue.
Scoping Out the Most 
Popular Ways to Ride
Nearly everyone who rides has a favorite riding discipline. As a budding
equestrian, you need to find one, too, so you know in advance exactly how
you’ll be riding your horse. You don’t have to be married to a discipline for-
ever, but you need to at least start with a commitment to riding in it. You can
always switch to another discipline later on.
Your choice of a riding style is a very personal one. You need to choose a 
discipline that you find attractive and with which you feel comfortable. The
style you choose may be one that you’ve always admired from afar or one
that your friends participate in. Realize, however, that each discipline calls
for different skills. You may have more talent for one than another.

Before you choose your riding discipline, do some research. Read up on the
history of the discipline and the equine sports that ride in the discipline. Be
sure to take some lessons in the discipline before you make the serious com-
mitment of buying a horse trained in that style — and the tack (equipment)
to go with it (see Chapter 6 for more about tack). What looks good to you
from the ground may not feel comfortable when you’re in the saddle.
The most popular riding styles in the United States and Canada today are
hunt seat, dressage, saddle seat, and western. The following sections tell you
a bit about the history of each style, the sports that utilize them, and some
basics about riding in the different styles.
Showing off with hunt seat
Few feelings are more exhilarating than the sensation of cantering along on 
a horse in a hunt-seat saddle. Checking out this discipline, you discover that
wonderful sensation. The English discipline of hunt seat gets its name from
the British sport of fox hunting. Unlike fox hunting, most hunt-seat riding
takes place in an arena, although plenty of hunt-seat riders also hack (ride 
on the trail). Hunt seat is probably the most popular discipline in the world.
The uses
Hunt seat is the style of choice for many people who participate in horse
shows. In hunt-seat competitions, judges rate riders over fences (evaluating
the horse and/or rider for their skill over a course of jumps) and on the 
flat (judging horse and/or rider in the arena at the walk, trot, and canter).
Competitive hunt-seat class competition is conducted within different 
divisions determined by age and expertise of either the horse or rider.
Some riders who master hunt seat eventually move on to a sport called show
jumping. Show jumping is similar to hunt-seat competition, but it isn’t for the
faint of heart, because the jumps are higher, and time and speed are of the
essence. (See Chapter 18 for more about show jumping.)
People ride many different breeds in hunt seat, but Thoroughbreds are the
horses you see most often in this discipline (see Chapter 3 for details on dif-
ferent breeds).
The tack
Logically enough, hunt-seat riding uses hunt-seat saddles. Varying only
slightly in style from one to another (you more commonly see all-purpose
saddles and show jumping saddles), these saddles enable the rider to main-
tain close contact with the horse’s body. The seat is rather shallow, and the
stirrups are kept relatively short.
258
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Hunt-seat headgear usually consists of a single-rein bridle with a bit that
offers direct contact with the horse’s mouth. One exception is the pelham bit,
which uses two reins (see Chapter 6 for more about the tack that riders use
in hunt seat).
The ride
Hunt seat is an excellent discipline to practice if you want to develop good
balance on horseback. Hunt-seat saddles are small, and you have to learn to
ride well to ride hunt seat.
When riding hunt seat for show, judges expect you to sit in the saddle —
maintaining correct body position — as the horse walks. Figure 14-1 shows 
a hunt-seat rider in correct position. An imaginary line can be drawn up
through the back of the heel and through the hip, shoulder, and ear. At the
trot, you have to sit the trot, which means to sit firmly in the saddle. You must
also post the trot, which is the action of lifting your rear end up out of the
saddle and bringing it back down again, all to the rhythm of the horse’s gait.
At the canter, you lean slightly forward and move with the horse’s body, with
your seat firmly in the saddle. (See Chapter 2 for more details on how horses
move.)
If you plan to jump on horseback (and most hunt-seat riders do), you have to
master, or maintain, the two-point position (also known as the half-seat) while
the horse actually negotiates the jump. The position requires you to position
your torso forward over the horse’s neck while lifting your bottom off the
saddle.

Chapter 14: Selecting a Riding Discipline

Staying natural with dressage
Dressage, an English discipline, is one of the oldest riding styles in the world.
Its roots lie in ancient European military maneuvers. Consequently, this type
of riding has long been popular in Europe. Over the past three decades, dres-
sage has become rather popular in North America, too.
You can apply many of the skills you learn in dressage to other riding disci-
plines, including hunt seat, western, and saddle seat.
The uses
Dressage is primarily a competitive discipline, although not in the same
sense as other equine sports such as reining and show jumping. Dressage
competitors strive to achieve different skill levels that are measured by tests.
The dressage levels of mastery are called Introductory Level, Training Level,
First Level, Second Level, Third Level, Fourth Level, and Olympic Level. At
dressage events, the riders with the highest scores receive ribbons, but most
dressage riders care more about the quality of their own test scores rather
than those of the other competitors.
The discipline of dressage focuses on and emphasizes the horse’s natural
movements. For horse and for rider, this discipline is one of the most difficult
to master. Riders trained in dressage work very hard, which ultimately ranks
them among the best riders in the world.
Warmbloods are the most popular breed for upper-level dressage, and yet
plenty of riders compete in regional and local events on Quarter Horses,
Thoroughbreds, Appaloosas, Morgans, Saddlebreds, and many other breeds
(see Chapter 3).
The tack
The discipline of dressage calls for a dressage saddle, which looks much like
a hunt-seat saddle to the untrained eye. Closer scrutiny reveals that the seat
of a dressage saddle is deeper than that of a hunt-seat saddle. The flaps of a
dressage saddle also are wider and at a greater angle to the seat. Finally, you
wear the stirrups lower in dressage than in hunt seat.
As far as bridles go, dressage bridles don’t vary too much from the bridles
you see in hunt seat. See Chapter 6 for the complete scoop on dressage sad-
dles and bridles.
The ride
To master dressage, you and your horse must be pretty athletic. Many people
compare dressage to ballet because it calls for the same kind of grace and
discipline from the horse. You likewise have to become a very good rider to
exact that sort of bearing from your horse.
260
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

If you pursue dressage, you practice riding at the walk, trot, and canter. At
the trot, you’re taught to post (move up and down in the saddle to the rhythm
of the horse’s movement) and to sit firmly in the saddle at the trot. Figure
14-2 shows a dressage rider in correct position in the saddle at the canter.
The rider sits deep in the saddle, and an imaginary line comes behind the
heel and goes up through the hip, shoulder, and ear.
Riding high with saddle seat
Saddle seat is considered an English discipline, although it has become
uniquely American. You don’t see as much saddle seat as the other English
disciplines in most parts of the country, but this riding style nonetheless 
has its very dedicated followers. The roots of saddle-seat riding lie in the
American South, where the discipline still is popular today.
The uses
Competition is the main purpose of the saddle-seat discipline, although many
saddle-seat riders also enjoy trail riding. Shows for American gaited breeds
always contain saddle-seat classes, and so do many shows for Morgans and
Arabians. Saddle-seat classes are judged either on the horse’s action or the
rider’s position in the saddle (equitation). For a horse to be successful in
saddle-seat competition, he must be a very flashy animal.
You primarily see saddle seat on horses with high leg action, most often
gaited horses like American Saddlebreds, Tennessee Walking Horses, and
Racking Horses (see Chapter 3 for more information on gaited horses).
Figure 14-2:

261
Chapter 14: Selecting a Riding Discipline

The tack
Saddle-seat riding uses a show saddle, which is a type of English saddle,
although it’s quite different from hunt-seat and dressage saddles. Show sad-
dles are flatter than other English saddles, have a shallower seat, and feature
a design that enables the horse’s shoulders to move freely as the animal
demonstrates high, front-end action. This design causes the rider to sit far
behind the horse’s withers, taking the rider’s weight off the front part of the
horse. The stirrups are worn rather long, similar to the length of the dressage
rider’s stirrups.
The bridle that saddle seat typically uses varies considerably from other
English bridles. Called a double bridle, this piece of equipment features two
bits and two sets of reins (as opposed to one bit and one set of reins used in
conventional bridles). One set of reins controls the curb bit, which you use to
establish and maintain the set of the horse’s head (the position in which the
horse holds his head relative to his neck). The other set of reins controls a
snaffle bit, which helps keep the horse’s head and neck up high. Riders need
considerable dexterity and skill because they must use each set of reins sepa-
rately rather than together, which is the usual tendency. See Chapter 6 for
more details on show saddles and double bridles.
The ride
If you choose to ride saddle seat on a gaited horse, you’ll notice the four-beat
gaits of breeds such as the American Saddlebred, the Tennessee Walking
Horse, and the Racking Horse provide a completely different experience than
riding a so-called “trotting horse.” The fact that you’re sitting in a saddle that
puts your legs out in front of you instead of beneath you like most other dis-
ciplines (see Figure 14-3) makes the ride even more unrivaled in feeling.
The most exciting aspect of the saddle-seat discipline is the way that it better
enables you to show off the horse you’re riding. Sitting astride an animal who
commands the attention of spectators with his flashy style and assertive
presence is an exhilarating benefit of the saddle seat discipline.
Taking it easy with western
Thanks to Hollywood, almost everyone is familiar with the discipline of west-
ern riding. Every cowboy movie showcases western riding, but it isn’t the
best execution of the style that we’ve seen.
Western riding and the saddle used with it are creations that arose in the
American West and have become the most popular style of riding in the
United States. This relatively large saddle was the perfect invention for the
men who worked cattle on the range from dawn to dusk and traveled long
distances on horseback.
262
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

The uses
Cowhands who work cattle in the West still use western riding, but its biggest
function is as a form of pleasure and show riding. Western shows and rodeos
take place around the country by the thousands every year, sporting classes
such as western pleasure, trail, gymkhana, reining, roping, and cutting. In
each of these sports, the western saddle and the style of riding associated
with it is the only discipline permitted.
The discipline of western riding is also a favorite of equestrians who ride for
the sheer joy of it. Trail riders throughout North America ride in western sad-
dles, primarily because of the saddle’s comfort and the discipline’s relaxed
style.
The Quarter Horse has nearly cornered the western riding market, although
breeds like the Appaloosa and Paint are popular western horses, too. Because
of the western saddle’s design, you don’t often see rangy Thoroughbreds and
other high-withered breeds that aren’t suited to wearing the saddle in this 
discipline.
The tack
The tack you use in western riding is one of the neatest things about the dis-
cipline. The western saddle, with its high pommel and cantle (see Chapter 6)
and its very distinct horn, differs considerably from the English saddle. This
Figure 14-3:

seat rider in

263
Chapter 14: Selecting a Riding Discipline

difference isn’t surprising because the primary influences for the Western
saddle came from Spain and Mexico, not Britain.
The western saddle’s stirrups are also different in that they consist of large
fenders and are sewn directly onto the saddle’s body. Unlike English saddles,
the stirrups themselves are not made of iron, but instead are wooden with a
leather covering.
Even the girth of a western saddle — more correctly called a cinch — is differ-
ent. Unlike the English version, a part of the saddle called a latigo strap holds
the western saddle on the horse. You must loop the strap through the girth
and knot it high on the cinch ring.
Western bridles also differ considerably from their English counterparts.
Typically, western bridles consist of a leather headstall and not much else.
Some bridles bear brow bands and throatlatches, but many don’t. The bit
almost always is a curb bit — although snaffles are becoming more popular
and usually are used without curb shanks for training. A curb chain is present
on every western bridle that bears curb shanks. See Chapter 6 for a complete
explanation of the different parts of a western saddle and bridle.
The ride
If you like the idea of relaxing when you ride, western riding may be the disci-
pline for you. You wear western stirrups long, and as you ride, you find that
leaning back slightly and keeping a loose rein enable you and your horse to
travel comfortably for hours. Figure 14-4 shows a western rider in correct
position. Western riders sit back more than hunt-seat riders but still maintain
an upright position with an imaginary line that runs behind the heel up
through the hip, shoulder, and ear.

264
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

In the western discipline, the horse’s gaits are known as the walk, jog, and
lope, as opposed to walk, trot, and canter in the English disciplines. These
gaits are considerably slower than what you experience when riding English.
Generally speaking, if you ride a western horse, you experience an animal
that has been trained to have quiet, leisurely gaits. The exception is a com-
petitive rodeo horse trained to sprint around barrels and chase down cows.
Getting the Scoop on Other 
Cool Riding Styles
Hunt seat, dressage, western, and saddle seat are the four most popular
riding styles in the United States and Canada. However, they’re certainly not
the only styles of riding. Equestrians around the country use other riding
forms, each with its own unique history and particular usage. Some of these
styles are actual disciplines, but others don’t require formal training.
If you want to pursue one of the actual disciplines we discuss here, you need
to do some work finding a riding instructor who can teach them. Finding an
instructor for a less-popular discipline isn’t as easy as finding someone who
gives western riding lessons, but the trouble with ferreting out an instructor
may just be worth it to you when you come to appreciate the uniqueness of
each type of riding. Contact a riding instructor association (check out the
Appendix to get started) for a referral to a discipline specialist in your area.
Endurance
Several decades ago, North Americans discovered the wonders of the
Australian stock saddle, a piece of tack that looks like a cross between a 
dressage saddle and a western saddle. Created by Australian riders who
needed a light saddle with an easy seat for long rides through the outback,
the Australian stock saddle became the saddle of choice for many trail and
endurance riders.
The Australian stock saddle has since morphed into what is commonly
known as an endurance saddle. Endurance saddles come in a few different
styles, but each has two things in common: a comfortable seat for the rider
and a comfortable fit for the horse. Those who ride many hours on the trail 
in endurance and competitive trail riding competitions describe endurance
saddles as ideal for their sport.
In North America, riders — depending on their preference — use English 
or western bridles with endurance saddles. The use of a bridle isn’t terribly
important in this instance because riding in an endurance saddle doesn’t 
call for the mastery of a new discipline. Riders who are experienced in hunt
265
Chapter 14: Selecting a Riding Discipline

seat and dressage disciplines are most comfortable in an endurance saddle,
although western riders may have little trouble adapting to it. (See Chapter 6
for more about this saddle.)
Peruvian
Despite the fact that several American gaited breeds exist, Americans haven’t
cornered the market on gaited horses. The Peruvian Paso is a gaited breed
that is becoming more popular in the United States of late (see Chapter 3 for
more information about gaited horses).
Although you can also ride them in the more common disciplines, Peruvian
Pasos have a discipline that’s unique to the breed. Tradition dictates that you
show these horses in their native discipline. Some purists insist on riding
Peruvian Pasos in the breed’s native tack at all times, even when merely
going for a jaunt on the trail.
In Peru, people ride the Peruvian Paso in an incredibly comfortable saddle
that has wide, flat skirts, a high pommel and cantle, and a leather-hooded
stirrup. The traditional Peruvian Paso bridle is quite elaborate, featuring a
bosal type halter, a piece called a gamarilla that holds the bit, and a wide
brow band known as a tapa ojo.
Riding a Peruvian Paso in his traditional tack is very fun, although you must
specifically learn the Peruvian discipline. Many of the skills you learn in
English and western riding aren’t applicable in this discipline. Saddle-seat
riding probably bears the closest resemblance to the Peruvian discipline.
Sidesaddle
It’s hard to imagine in this day and age that people used to consider it
improper for a woman to sit astride a horse. Until the 20th century, however,
this belief was essentially the social custom when it came to riding.
For women, the answer to this expectation was something called the side-
saddle, a piece of equipment that provided female riders a secure seat while
keeping both legs on one side of the horse. In the sidesaddle, the left leg fits
in the stirrup as it would in a conventional saddle, while the right leg rests
over a fixed pommel situated on the left side of the saddle.
At first, society women simply rode sidesaddle when they needed to get from
one place to another on horseback. Eventually, women were able to ride
along on fox hunts, thanks to the invention of something called the leapers
horn, which made them secure enough to sit on a jumping horse.
266
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Today, a relatively small group of female equestrians are keeping the tradition
of sidesaddle alive, praising its elegance and historical significance. Using
modern sidesaddles in either English or western design with corresponding
bridles, they ride in arenas and on the trail in this discipline. They also show
in antique saddles, most from the 1800s, while wearing period costumes
appropriate to the saddle’s age. Some sidesaddle riders even compete in
barrel racing and other daring events.
Sidesaddle calls for a skilled rider and an obedient horse. Unlike astride disci-
plines, the aside discipline of sidesaddle doesn’t permit the rider to give leg
cues from the right. Sidesaddle riders must use a sidesaddle crop to direct
the horse on the right side, while using standard leg pressure on the left. To
learn this discipline, you need an instructor who is well versed in this form of
riding.
Bareback
Before the invention of saddles, human beings rode bareback. This riding
method worked well for transportation purposes. Humans didn’t decide they
needed saddles until they figured out they could wage war on horseback.
Today, many equestrians ride bareback. Bareback riding is not a discipline
per se, but actually just another way of enjoying your horse. Riders who
indulge in bareback riding don’t usually ride only bareback, but do so for an
occasional change of pace. Some even show in bareback riding classes, usu-
ally seen only at western shows.
Bareback riding makes you feel closer to your horse. When cantering along
without a saddle, you almost feel as though you are one with the animal. Our
ancient ancestors must have savored this exciting feeling.
Bareback riding is good for beginners because it helps create a secure and
confident riding seat. You can’t rely on the confines of a saddle to keep you
on the horse when you are riding bareback. Instead, you must learn to keep
your balance to stay on. Another bonus of bareback riding is that it saves you
time: You don’t need to spend an extra 5 to 10 minutes saddling up your
horse on the days you plan to ride bareback.
Although bareback riding can help you develop a good seat, the downside is
that falling off a horse is much easier when you’re riding bareback. Gripping
the mane can help, but if your horse is bucking, spinning, or pulling some
other athletic stunt, chances are you’re going to eat some dirt.
267
Chapter 14: Selecting a Riding Discipline

Driving
Humans have been putting the cart after the horse for millennia, and still do
so today. For many elderly and physically challenged equestrians who are
physically unable to ride — and for those who simply don’t like to ride — 
driving is the equine sport of choice.
Many people hitch up their horses to carts and drive for the sheer joy of it,
although others are serious competitors in the driving show ring. Several
breed shows have driving classes that feature one or two horses pulling dif-
ferent types of vehicles, as well as events with six- to eight-horse draft teams
hauling wagons the way they did before the advent of the automotive engine.
Horses must be specially trained to drive; some learn the style in their early
preriding training. Horses who are trained to drive are taught to pull weight
(instead of carry it), and they can be steered in a completely different way
than when they’re ridden. Drivers also must train the horses for this disci-
pline. This training includes learning to handle the reins used in driving,
which are quite different from riding reins.

 Saddling up your horse
 Securing your horse’s bridle
U
nless you’re wealthy — or starring in a movie — you probably don’t
have the luxury of having someone bring your saddled and bridled
horse out to you every time you want to ride. The task of tacking up, as horse
people call it, falls squarely upon your shoulders. Of course, to truly become
an accomplished horseperson, you need to be able to tack up a horse.
Although the basics of tacking up for English and western riding are essen-
tially the same, the differences are enough to make the process a bit confus-
ing. We unravel all those straps and buckles for you in this chapter so you
have a fundamental understanding of how to prepare a horse for riding. 
(And for more about the basics of horse equipment, be sure to check out
Chapter 6.)
Putting On a Saddle and Accessories
The saddle and accessories always go on before the bridle (the head piece
consisting of the bit, headstall, and reins) when tacking up a horse; you 
need the horse’s halter (a head harness of sorts) to secure him to crossties
or a hitching post while you saddle up. After you finish bridling, the halter
comes off.
Before you attempt to tack up a horse, have an experienced horseperson
demonstrate the steps. After you watch the process a few times, you’re ready
to try it on your own — with supervision. Don’t attempt to tack up a horse
alone until whomever is supervising you assures you that you have the
process down pat.
Before you start saddling up, do the following:
1. Tie your horse securely by his halter to a hitching post (using a quick
release knot) or crossties. (See Chapter 13 for more about tying.)

2. Groom your horse thoroughly, being careful to brush down the hairs
on the back and the girth area (check out Chapter 1 for a diagram
showing the parts of the horse). Make sure that no pieces of dirt, bed-
ding, or other foreign objects are stuck to your horse’s back or girth
area. (Chapter 9 has the full scoop on grooming.)
3. Check your saddle blanket and girth or cinch to make sure that no
burrs, sticks, or other items are clinging to the underside.
Correctly positioning and fastening the saddle on your horse’s back is
extremely important. A poor saddling job can result in discomfort or injury to
both you and your horse. The diagrams in Figure 15-1 show the correct place-
ment of English and western saddles.
Whether you’re saddling your horse with an English or a western saddle,
always begin on the left side. All tasks concerning the horse’s body begin
with a left-side approach. The tradition of working first on the left side of the
horse goes back hundreds of years, and is part of horse handling protocol.
Most horses are accustomed to being approached from the left as a result
and are likely to be more cooperative if you maintain this tradition.
The English saddle
First, familiarize yourself with the parts of the English saddle (refer to
Chapter 6). Know where all your equipment is. You need

270
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Then follow these steps to saddle a horse with an English saddle, beginning
on the horse’s left side:
1. Lay the pad over the horse’s back. Stand on the horse’s left side and
position the front of the pad a few inches above the horse’s withers, at
the base of the neck.
2. Slide the pad backward a couple of inches so the front edge of the pad
is still covering the withers.
Don’t slide the pad forward if you need to reposition it because doing so
ruffles the hairs underneath, resulting in irritation to the horse while you
ride. Instead, lift the pad off the horse’s back and reposition it. Check
both sides of the horse to make sure that the amount of pad is even on
the left and the right.
3. Pick up the saddle. Grasp the front of the saddle in your left hand and
the back of the saddle in your right. Make sure that the stirrup irons
have been pushed up to the top of the stirrup leathers so they don’t flop
around while you handle the saddle.
4. Place the saddle gently on the horse’s back in the hollow just below
the withers. About 3 inches of the pad should be showing in front of 
the saddle, and at least 3 inches showing behind (if not, the pad is too
small). To determine whether the saddle is correctly positioned on the
horse’s back, look to see whether the girth, when attached to the saddle,
fits just behind the horse’s elbows (refer to Figure 15-1 for the correct
position of a English saddle).
5. Slide the girth straps on the left side of the saddle through the tab on
your saddle pad. Go to the horse’s right side and do the same.
6. Fasten the girth to the right side of the saddle. You usually don’t store
English girths attached to the saddle, so your girth will probably be
detached. Three girth straps hang there, but you only need two. The
third one is just in case one of the other straps breaks.
Bring the girth over to the right side of the horse and fasten the girth’s
buckles to the two outside girth straps that are hanging from the saddle.
Be sure you’re fastening the part of the girth that has solid leather and
not stretch material. The stretch material attaches on the left side. (Some
girths have stretch material on both sides — in that case, it doesn’t
matter which side you attach to the left or right.) Fasten the buckles
about halfway up each girth strap.
7. Fasten the girth to the left side of the saddle. Move to the left side of
the horse and reach underneath to grasp the girth. Follow the same
buckling procedure that you did in Step 6. Be sure that the girth is rest-
ing just behind the horse’s elbows, and that it isn’t twisted. Buckle tight
enough to make the girth snug.
271
Chapter 15: Getting Ready Before You Mount

8. Gradually tighten the girth on the left side over a period of several
minutes (so as not to shock the horse with one sharp pull) until it’s
snug enough that the saddle doesn’t move. If you run out of holes on
your left-side girth straps, begin tightening the buckles on the right.
Figure 15-2 shows how you tighten an English girth.
9. Check your stirrup length. Before you mount, determine whether your
stirrups are the correct length for your legs. You can check pretty reli-
ably by holding the reins in your left hand while sliding your right hand,
palm down, under the flap of the saddle where the stirrup leather
attaches to the saddle. Using your left hand, grasp the stirrup iron and
pull it toward the crook of your arm, allowing the stirrup leather to lay
flush against the bottom of your outstretched arm. If the stirrup iron fits
snugly in the crook of your arm, the stirrups are most likely the correct
length for your leg. If the stirrups are too long or too short, the problem
will be obvious relative to your arm length.
If your stirrups need lengthening or shortening, adjust them by using the
buckle on the stirrup leather.
After you mount, you can determine whether the stirrups are truly the
correct length. You should be able to stand up in the stirrups and have
your body clear the saddle. Another way to check is to take your feet
out of the stirrups while you are sitting in the saddle and notice where
the stirrups rests against your foot. The irons should rest at the ankle
when you legs are stretched down.
10. Stretch the horse’s legs to prevent pinching. Standing at the front of the
horse, pull the left leg toward you to stretch out the skin under the girth
so it doesn’t pinch the horse. Do the same with the horse’s right foreleg.

Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

You may need to repeat Step 8 after leading your horse around, before
you mount. Many horses have a tendency to puff up their bellies by hold-
ing their breath while you tighten the girth. Before you get on, make sure
that the girth is snug enough that it feels tight if you put your fingers
between it and the horse’s body. If you can’t get your fingers in there, the
girth is too tight and needs to be let out a notch.
The western saddle
Before you start, familiarize yourself with the parts of the western saddle
(refer to Chapter 6). Have your pad and saddle ready to go. Then follow these
steps to saddle a horse with a western saddle:
1. Lay the pad over the horse’s back. Stand on the horse’s left side and
position the front of the pad a few inches above the horse’s withers, at
the base of the neck.
2. Slide the pad backward a couple of inches so the front edge of the pad
is still covering the withers.
Don’t slide the pad forward if you need to reposition it because doing so
ruffles the hairs underneath, resulting in irritation to the horse while you
ride. Check both sides of the horse to make sure that the amount of pad
is even on the left and the right.
3. Prepare the saddle. On a western saddle, the cinch is permanently
attached to the right side. Before you approach the horse, flip the cinch
up and over so it drapes across the seat. Take the right stirrup and loop
it over the saddle horn.
4. Bring the saddle to the horse. Grasp the front of the saddle in your left
hand and the back of the saddle in your right. Approach the horse’s 
left side.
5. Place the saddle on the horse’s back. From the left side of the horse,
swing the saddle up and over, and place it gently on the horse’s back.
The saddle needs to sit in the hollow just below the withers with about 
3 inches of the pad showing in front and in the back. To determine
whether the saddle is correctly positioned on the horse’s back, look to
see whether the cinch, when attached to the saddle, fits just behind the
horse’s elbows (refer to Figure 15-1 for the correct position of a western
saddle).
6. Walk around to the right side of the horse and undrape the cinch so it
hangs down. Unloop the stirrup from the saddle horn and let it hang.
7. Secure the saddle with the cinch. From the left side of the horse, reach
underneath and take up the cinch. Run the latigo strap through the ring
of the cinch, and then feed the strap through the same D-ring on the
saddle where the latigo is attached. Continue to loop the latigo strap
through the two rings until you have about 12 inches of free strap
coming from the D-ring. See Figure 15-3 to find out how to tie the knot.
273
Chapter 15: Getting Ready Before You Mount

8. Check your stirrup length. Before you mount, determine whether your
stirrups are the correct length for your legs. You can check by holding
the reins in your left hand while sliding your right hand, palm down,
under the flap of the saddle where the stirrup leather attaches to the
saddle. Using your left hand, grasp the stirrup and pull it toward the
crook of your arm, allowing the stirrup leather to lay flush against the
bottom of your outstretched arm. If the stirrup fits snugly in the crook 
of your arm, the stirrups are most likely the correct length for your leg. 
If the stirrups are too long or too short, the problem will be obvious 
relative to your arm length.
After you mount, you can determine whether the stirrups are the correct
length. You should be able to stand up in the stirrups and maintain your
balance for a few seconds in that position.
If your stirrups need lengthening or shortening, adjust them by using the
buckle flap underneath the stirrup leather. (You need to dismount to do
this, if you discovered a problem when you were already on the horse.)
9. Make sure that the cinch is snug enough that the saddle doesn’t move,
but not so snug that you can’t fit the fingers of a flat hand between the
cinch and the horse’s body. To tighten the cinch, loosen the knot, and
pull up on the outside layer of strap between the D-ring and cinch rings.
Check the cinch again after walking your horse a little and before mount-
ing. You may need to retighten the cinch if your horse has a tendency to
hold his breath when you cinch him up.

Bridling Your Horse with Ease
The bridle goes on last, because after you bridle your horse, you can’t tie him
up again until you finish with your ride. If you’ve never bridled a horse, ask
an experience horse person to show you first before you attempt it.
Before you start to bridle your horse, do the following:
1. Tie the horse securely by his halter to a hitching post (using a quick
release knot) or crossties. See Chapter 13 for more about tying.
2. Groom and saddle the horse. Chapter 9 has grooming info.
3. Check the bridle to make sure that the noseband (the part that goes
around the nose) and throatlatch (the strap that fastens around the
horse’s jowls) on an English bridle are unbuckled. If you have a throat-
latch on a western bridle, make sure it’s unbuckled, too.
4. Have an experienced horse person help you determine whether the
bit size is correct, and how short the straps need to be on the head-
stall (the part of the bridle that goes over the horse’s ears and is
attached to the bit), if your horse has never worn this particular
bridle.
The steps for putting on an English and western bridle are nearly the same.
Familiarize yourself with the parts of both bridles before you begin (refer to
Chapter 6). Then, follow these steps to put on the bridle:
1. Secure the horse with the halter. Standing at the horse’s left side,
unbuckle the halter (which you had put on the horse before saddling),
slide the noseband off, and then rebuckle the halter around the horse’s
neck (Figure 15-4 shows how the halter fits around the horse’s neck).
2. Put the reins over the horse’s head so they lay on the horse’s neck.
3. Hold the bit and headstall and stand at the left side of your horse’s
head, facing the same direction that your horse is facing. Grasp the
top of the headstall in your right hand and the bit in your left hand. Let
the bit lay against your outstretched fingers. Stand next to the horse’s
head, facing forward in the same direction as the horse.
4. Place your right hand (still holding the headstall) just on top of the
horse’s head, behind the ears. If you can’t reach above the horse’s
head, you can instead reach your arm under the horse’s jaw and around
to the right side of the horse’s head so your right hand and headstall are
just above the horse’s forehead, or above the bridge of his nose.
275
Chapter 15: Getting Ready Before You Mount

5. Open the horse’s mouth and insert the bit. With your left thumb, gently
press down on the inside corner of the horse’s lip to open his mouth and
gently guide the bit into his mouth, being careful not to bang it against
his front teeth. Raise the headstall in your right hand until the bit slides
all the way into the horse’s mouth.
6. Gently slide the headstall over the horse’s ears. Adjust the horse’s fore-
lock (the hair on the forehead between the ears) and the area of the
mane just behind the ears so the hair is smooth under the headstall. The
bridle is now in place.
7. Buckle the throatlatch and noseband, if any.
English bridle: The throatlatch and noseband need to be snug,
but not so tight that you can’t get three fingers between each of
these straps and the horse’s face.
Western bridle: You probably won’t have a noseband to tighten. If
the bridle has a throatlatch, make sure that two fingers fit between
the horse’s cheek and the strap.
Curb chain or strap: If one of these is attached to the bit, make
sure that it’s loose when you let the reins relax (one or two fingers
should fit) but makes contact with the horse’s chin when you pull
the bit shanks back at a 45-degree angle.
8. Unbuckle the halter from your horse’s neck. If you plan to mount
where you are, leave the reins over your horse’s neck. If you want to
lead your horse to another area for mounting, remove the reins from
around your horse’s neck and lead the horse by the reins.

Taking Control in the Saddle
In This Chapter
 Getting into a good mind-set for riding
 Taking riding lessons
 Mounting your horse easily
 Understanding riding (and post-ride) basics
 Coping with equine misbehavior
S
omething amazing happens when a human climbs aboard the back of a
horse. If the rider knows how to communicate with the horse, and if the
horse is receptive, the resulting experience can be magical. Achieving this
oneness of horse and rider requires hard work. Popular culture images make
riding a horse look like a piece of cake, but it takes months of practice before
you have a sense of what you’re doing.
It’s never too late to develop riding skills. With plenty of hard (albeit fun)
work, you can become as efficient a rider as any of those cowboy movie
stars. But you have to start somewhere — like this chapter.
Preparing Yourself Mentally
Riding is more than just a physical activity — it’s a mental one, too. You need
to use your brain for riding, probably even more than your body, and that
means understanding your role as a rider on an intellectual as well as an 
emotional level. Read on to see what we mean.
Beating your fear
We talk a lot about the horse’s fear in this and other chapters of Horses For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, but what about the fear you have?

If you are asking, “What fear?” right about now, then good for you. You’re
probably one of those brave souls who has no qualms about getting up on a
half-ton animal and trusting him with your life. But more than likely, you’re
one of the great majority of beginning adult riders who finds the notion of
riding a horse a bit scary.
Being afraid to ride is okay, as long as fear doesn’t keep you from trying. We
feel confident that if you follow the advice in this book, you’ll soon discover
that your fears are unfounded and that riding a good horse is one of the most
relaxing and enjoyable things anyone can do.
If you have a nagging reluctance, know that the more your riding skills
increase, the more confident you’ll feel on a horse’s back. Remember, human
beings have been riding horses for the past 4,000 years, and our species still
survives!
Acknowledging your role as the leader
Before getting up on a horse for the first time (or if you’ve already been on a
horse, make it before the first time you do it after reading this chapter), you
need to have a basic understand of what riding is all about.
The key to understanding why horses let humans ride them is leadership.
Horses are herd animals that seek a leader in any social situation. Generally
speaking, human beings have managed to convince the equine species that
humans are worthy of that leadership position. So when a human gets up on
a horse’s back and tells that horse what to do, the horse obeys because he
views the rider as his leader. (See Chapter 2 for more about the horse’s
psyche.)
This scenario works only when the rider has the leadership qualities that the
horse expects. If a rider gets up on a horse without a clue as to what to do
and how to do it, the horse quickly senses those lacking skills and takes over
the leadership role.
Taking Riding Lessons First
Have you ever ridden a horse that ran away with you, tried to roll on you,
rubbed you against a tree, or refused to move as soon as you got on? If not,
you probably know someone who has. Unfortunately, many first-time riders
have this kind of experience, and it sours them on horses forever. However, 
if they had taken riding lessons before they tried to go out on their own, 
their experiences may have been much better.
278
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

We can’t overemphasize the necessity for taking formal riding lessons before
you go out and get yourself a horse or start riding regularly on your own. You
probably wouldn’t dream of going scuba diving without first taking lessons 
or doing something as benign as golfing without finding out the rules of the
game. With horses, rider training is doubly important, because you need to
understand the rules and develop the skills before you go it alone.
Where can you get lessons? You have a number of options:
 Commercial stables: Many commercial riding establishments offer
riding lessons, usually in several disciplines. These facilities aren’t hard
to find — all you need to do is look in the phone book under “riding
academies.” Before you sign up, visit the stable and observe the lessons.
Talk to the instructors and ask them about their experiences. Look for
certified riding instructors with experience showing horses and tutoring
clients who are successful in the show ring. Certified instructors have
successfully completed a riding instructor certification program (see the
Appendix). If you like the stable and instructors, sign up for one lesson.
If the experience is good, plan to take at least several months worth of
lessons.
 Horseback vacations: The term dude ranch conjures up images of city
slickers slumped in western saddles, timidly hanging onto the saddle
horn as their horses pick their way over steep mountain trails. But these
days, dude ranches and other horseback-oriented vacation spots do
more than give trail rides to those with only a casual interest in riding.
You can take formal riding lessons at many of these places, provided you
pick a facility that caters to beginners. A horseback vacation spot actu-
ally is a great place to get started, because it not only combines a fun
atmosphere with training but also provides you with one or two weeks of
intensive riding. You can follow up this instruction with more lessons
when you get home (see Chapter 19 for more details on riding vacations).
 Riding clubs: Horse lovers tend to congregate, which is good news for
neophytes who take an interest in horses. Although clubs that exist specif-
ically to teach newcomers usually are aimed at children, they actually
offer opportunities for adults, too. One example is the Pony Club, an excel-
lent U.S. and British organization that teaches children (most of whom do
not own their own horses) horsemanship and riding skills. If you and your
child want to ride horses, sign your child up with your local Pony Club
chapter and volunteer as an adult helper (see the Appendix for informa-
tion on contacting the Pony Club). If you have a child of college age, con-
sider getting involved with an intercollegiate or college riding program.
 An equine expert: If you live in a small town or a remote area, you may
have trouble finding a commercial riding stable or riding club nearby. In
that case, try to find someone locally who can help you with your riding.
Ask other horse owners in your town to help you locate an experienced
horse person, such as a breeder, an equine veterinarian, or someone
who shows extensively. Ask this expert whether you can hire him or her
279
Chapter 16: Taking Control in the Saddle

to teach you to ride. Most horse people are more than happy to help
newcomers to the hobby provided those newcomers have a sincere and
genuine interest. (Flip to Chapter 4 for tips on finding an equine expert.)
The things you shouldn’t do include these don’ts:
 Don’t go to a stable that rents out horses by the hour without first
receiving riding instruction. Remember those friends of yours who’ve
been on the back of a runaway horse and rubbed off on trees? Most
likely, it happened in this type of place. Owners at most rent-by-hour 
stables allow the horses to develop bad attitudes and dangerous habits.
Such horses are bad news for beginning riders.
 Don’t let an inexperienced friend give you lessons on his or her horse.
If your friend is an experienced rider who owns a suitable horse for
beginning riders, then by all means, ask your friend for help. But if your
friend has only been riding a short time and has a horse he or she can
barely control, politely decline the offer and opt for one of the alterna-
tives we mention earlier.
The amount of time necessary for you to get the hang of riding depends on
you. Some people pick it up faster than others. When you are to the point
where you feel like you can competently control your horse, inside and out-
side of the arena, you know enough to begin doing some riding on your own.
But remember: You can never know too much when it comes to riding. Heck,
even the riders on the Olympic equestrian team still take lessons!
The way you keep the relationship between you and your horse healthy is to
provide continuing education for the both of you by:
 Entering into training with a professional (where you and your horse will
be schooled)
 Taking lessons as often as you can
 Practicing your riding skills and schooling your horse
Spend some riding time reinforcing the commands your horse already knows
while you practice giving them. Work in an arena once a week or so and exe-
cute turning, backing up, stopping, and other skills that you pick up in formal
lessons.
Getting Into Riding Shape
You only need to be on a horse once to discover that riding utilizes muscles
that you never knew you had. You don’t need to be a super athlete to be a
competent rider, but the stronger and more flexible you are, the easier riding
is on your body.
280
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

If you don’t already have a regular exercise routine, now may be a good time
to start one. (Be sure to talk to your doctor first.) Here are a few things to
work on that will enhance your riding abilities:
 Lose weight: If you’re overweight, it can be more difficult to mount, dis-
mount, cue the horse, and stay comfortable when riding the horse’s vari-
ous gaits. Besides, your excess weight is a hardship for the horse. Try 
to stick to a healthy diet of mostly protein and vegetables, with only a
small amount of carbohydrates per day to keep your weight down and
your energy level up Refined sugar should be avoided because it makes
you gain weight and causes your blood-sugar levels to spike and crash.
Avoiding preservatives, sugars, and processed foods whenever you can
and eating mostly whole grains and fresh foods can keep your body
strong and healthy for riding.
 Build muscle strength: If you plan to ride English, a good amount of arm
strength is needed to maintain contact with the horse’s mouth via the
reins. Women, especially, need to take note of this necessity, because
unlike most men, they do not get sufficient arm strength genetically. You
also need strong legs to cue the horse, post the trot (move up and down
in the saddle with the rhythm of the horse’s gait), and do a number of
other tasks when you are riding. Pilates exercises are a good way to build
muscle strength in the areas you’ll need it most for riding.
 Get flexible: Most people notice soreness in their legs when they first
train to ride. That’s because sitting stretched out across a horse’s back
creates a big pull on the upper, inner muscles of the thighs. Do stretch-
ing exercises for your legs and the rest of your body several times to a
week to stay flexible for riding. Yoga is another great way to stretch the
muscles you’ll need for riding.
 Build endurance: If you plan to spend much time in the saddle, like on a
long trail ride, you’ll want to build up your endurance. You can do this
with aerobics, jogging, or even walking, if you do it often and for long
periods of time. Riding for longer amounts of time over a gradual period
also helps your body become accustomed to long hours in the saddle.
After you’ve gotten into solid riding shape, you probably will ask: How long
should I ride? The answer depends on a couple of things:
 Your horse: Horses are capable of going all day, provided they’re prop-
erly conditioned. If you prefer to ride for an hour a day, once a day, you
can slowly build your horse up to this level of conditioning. If you want
to trail ride for hours on end several days a week, work your way up to
that level over a period of months. If you ride only once a week (we rec-
ommend that you ride more often), don’t expect your horse to go for
hours on that day because he’s pretty much out of shape and at risk of
developing leg problems or something called azoturia (see Chapter 11).
We also recommend that you limit arena riding to no more than one
hour per day. Arena riding is hard on your horse’s legs and can be a real
bore for your horse.
281
Chapter 16: Taking Control in the Saddle

Keep in mind that although a horse can walk for an extended time with-
out tiring, faster gaits, such as trotting and cantering, take much more
energy. Be careful about spending too much time at these faster gaits if
your horse isn’t properly conditioned. And don’t ride your horse in tight
circles or on hard ground for extended periods, both can do serious
damage to his legs.
 Your time: Most horse lovers would be happy spending most of their
waking hours in the saddle. However, unless you’re a working cowboy,
reality dictates that you’ll ride much less that that. We recommend that
you ride as often as you can, and take really long rides only on the trail
and only if your horse has been conditioned for such activity. The time
you spend riding is not only good for your horse, it’s also good for your
physical and mental well-being.
Swinging Up and Onto Your Horse
Before you can ride, you have to get on, and for most beginners, mounting is
one of the greatest challenges of riding. Adults find it especially difficult,
because they have much more bulk to get up into a saddle than does a child.
Mounting your horse with great ease and decorum takes practice. In the
beginning, we recommend that you have an experienced horse person spot
you and make sure that you’re doing it right. While this person observes,
have him or her hold onto your horse’s bridle for the sake of safety.
Before you get up on a horse and go, check the footing of the area where you
plan to ride. If you plan to ride in an arena, be sure the dirt is loose — that is,
not hard packed. Conversely, make sure the dirt isn’t so loose that your horse
has to struggle through it. And be certain that the footing is dry. Wet arenas
are among the most dangerous places to ride, longe, or turn out a horse. A
horse can easily slip and fall on wet footing, seriously injuring himself or you
in the process.
Many English riders use a mounting block to get on their horses, in large part
because their stirrups are set shorter than those of western riders. The mount-
ing block enables you to climb up nearly to the level of the horse’s back, where
you simply swing your leg over the saddle. A mounting block keeps the saddle
from slipping as you mount the horse and reduces the amount of wear and tear
on your horse’s back. You can buy one of these at a tack store or a feed store,
or through an equine Internet or mail-order catalog (see the Appendix for con-
tact information).
282
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Using a mounting block every time you get up on your horse is perfectly
acceptable. But even if you choose to use one, you also need to know how to
get on from the ground. If you get off or fall off your horse out on the trail, or
in a place where you don’t have a mounting block, you can strand yourself if
you can’t get back get on.
Mounting in a western saddle is easier than mounting in an English saddle
because western stirrups are longer and reach lower than English stirrups.
Western saddles also are less likely than English saddles to slip as you’re
mounting, and you have more to hold onto with a western saddle.
To mount your horse from the ground, follow these steps (see Figure 16-1):
1. Lead your horse to the area where you want to mount. Choose the
inside of the arena where you plan to ride, or another safe area.
2. Position yourself and stay in control of the horse. To do so, you 
need to
• Place the reins over your horse’s head. If you’re mounting English,
rest them on his neck.
• Stand at the horse’s left shoulder, facing the back of the horse with
the reins snug in your left hand. Never release the reins while
you’re mounting. You need to keep control of your horse at all
times.
• If you’re riding, grab a handful of mane at the base of the horse’s
neck with the same (left) hand. If you’re riding western, grab hold
of the saddle horn with the same (left) hand.
3. Using your right hand, grasp the stirrup and turn it toward you. Place
your left foot in the stirrup.
4. Swing into the saddle. Turn your body toward the horse as you grasp
the cantle (the rise at the back of the saddle) with your right hand.
Bounce on your right leg two or three times and then launch yourself up
into the air, swinging your right leg over the horse’s hindquarters, being
careful not to touch them, and land gently in the saddle.
5. Place your right foot in the stirrup. Divide up your reins into both
hands if you’re riding English. If you’re riding western, just gather up
your reins in your left hand.
283
Chapter 16: Taking Control in the Saddle

Focusing on Riding Fundamentals
Among the many things you practice when you take riding lessons are what
we call riding basics, or the fundamental elements you must know to success-
fully ride a horse. In the following sections, we cover how to hold the reins,
position yourself in the saddle, cue your horse, and ride along with your
horse’s gaits.
Holding the reins
Just as you figured out how to hold a knife and fork as a child, you now must
now figure out the right way to hold the reins when you ride. Holding the
reins properly is very important, because the reins are one of the primary
means of communication between you and your horse.
We describe how to hold the reins for both English and western styles in the
sections that follow. In addition to reading our descriptions, we also recom-
mend that you have a trainer or experienced horse person show you how to
do it.
English
English bridles call for two hands on the reins. When you ride English, you
hold the left rein in your left hand and the right rein in your right hand.

284
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Even though the term reins is plural, be aware that English snaffle bridles
technically have only one continuous rein that connects from one side of the
bit to the other. However, the part of the rein that connects to the left side of
the bit is the left rein. The part on the right side is the right rein.
To correctly pick up the reins, start with the reins resting on the horse’s
neck. Reach down and grasp the reins with your palms facing down and your
thumbs next to each other. After you have the reins in your hands, rotate
your wrists so that your thumbs are at the top (knuckles up) and the knuck-
les of your fingers are facing each other. Move your pinkies under each rein,
so the rein rests between your pinkie and your ring finger. Hold your hands in
a relaxed fist (see Figure 16-2).
A common mistake many beginning English riders make is that they tend to
balance themselves in the saddle by leaning against the reins. If you do this,
you’re in essence using the horse’s mouth to help keep you in the saddle,
which is considered poor riding and unfair to the horse. Imagine having 100
pounds or more pulling on your mouth in an effort to keep from falling. Ouch!
Nobody wants to do that to any horse, so we suggest that you work hard at
developing balance and security in the saddle so you won’t feel the need to
weigh heavy on the horse’s mouth.

Western reins usually are split reins, which means you have two separate
reins, one attached to the right side of the bit, the other attached to the left.
Although you’re still learning to ride, we recommend that you tie a knot in
your western reins, right above the area where your hand normally is when
you’re holding them. Knotted reins are safer for beginning riders, because
they won’t fall out of reach if you happen to drop them while riding.

Chapter 16: Taking Control in the Saddle

Western riding calls for the reins to be held in the left hand only. Doing so
theoretically frees up the right hand for roping, an important task for the
cowboys who originated this style of riding.
You can hold western reins in one of two styles: traditional and California.
These two styles exist purely as regional distinctions, with California style
being most popular in California, of course. Either way is correct, although
your riding instructor may prefer one over the other.
To ride traditional style, grasp the reins in your left fist, with the part of the
reins that leads to the bit resting between your thumb and forefinger. As you
hold the reins, the nail on your thumb should face skyward while the thumb
itself points toward the horse’s head (see Figure 16-3).
To hold the reins California style, grasp the reins in your left fist, with your
thumbnail pointed upward. The excess rein should be held in your right
hand, which rests on your right thigh (see Figure 16-4).
Positioning yourself in the saddle
Many people don’t realize how important your seat position is when riding.
Although experienced riders may seem to just casually sit up there, attaining
the proper position takes a certain amount of practice and concentration.
The way you sit in the saddle affects your and your horse’s comfort levels. It
also determines how secure you are in the saddle. Riders with correct posi-
tioning are less likely to fall off if the horse suddenly moves in an unexpected
direction.

Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Your exact position in the saddle depends on your riding discipline (see
Chapter 14 for discipline details). The following basics apply to nearly 
everyone:
 Your back: Keep your back straight when you sit in the saddle. Don’t
hunch forward, slump your shoulders, or arch your back. Just sit up
straight like you were told to do in grade school.
 Your legs: Generally speaking, your legs belong directly under you while
you’re in the saddle. They shouldn’t thrust forward ahead of your body
or lag behind. (An exception is when you’re riding saddle seat, where
your legs come out farther ahead of the body than in other disciplines.)
Furthermore, the balls of your feet (and nothing more) need to rest in
the stirrup, your toes should point up and straight ahead, and your
heels should point down.
 Your derriere: Before you get on a horse, and in the privacy of your 
own home, become familiar with your seat bones. The two bony points
between your thighs and your buttocks (one on each side) make contact
with anything firm that you sit on, provided you’re sitting up straight.
When you’re in the saddle, you should feel these two points against the
seat of your saddle, which indicates that your posture is correct.
If you don’t feel your seat bones when you’re riding, you’re probably
doing something wrong with your position. Ask a trainer, instructor, or
experienced horse person for help aligning your seat in the saddle.
 Your arms: If you’re riding English, your arms need to be bent at the
elbow, creating (theoretically) a straight line from your elbow to the bit.
You need to hold your hands about 6 inches above the horse’s withers
(the area on the back at the base of the horse’s neck). If you’re riding
western, your left hand goes a few inches above the saddle horn. Your left
arm should be bent at an approximate 45-degree angle, while your right
arm should be relaxed with your right hand resting on your right thigh.

Chapter 16: Taking Control in the Saddle

Cueing your horse
After you’re properly seated on the horse and are holding the reins, you’re
ready to start signaling the horse. Most horses understand the following
basic commands:
 Forward: Squeeze the horse’s sides with both your legs (using your calf
muscles) at the same time. Make sure that your reins are relatively loose
as you do. If the horse does not respond, you may need to gently tap the
horse with your heels and make a kissing or clucking sound.
 Stop: Pull back on the reins with one steady motion as you say “Ho” 
(or “Whoa”). Maintain the pull on the reins until the horse stops.
 Turn left: You use both your legs and the reins to communicate this
message.
If you’re riding English, pull back very slightly on only the left rein as
you move your right leg back a little and apply some pressure. Your left
leg applies pressure while staying stationary on the girth as a support
for the horse to turn around. After the horse completes the turn, relax
your hands and legs.
If you’re riding western, move your left hand to the left so the right rein
makes contact with the horse’s neck (this is called neck reining). At the
same time, move your right leg back a little behind the girth and apply
some pressure to the horse’s side. Your left leg applies pressure while
staying in place on the girth as a support for the horse to turn around.
After the horse completes the turn, relax your hands and legs.
 Turn right: Turning right calls for the same commands as turning left,
although in reverse. In English riding, pull back very slightly on only the
right rein as you move your left leg back a little behind the girth and
apply some pressure to the horse’s side. In western riding, move your
left hand to the right so the left rein makes contact with the horse’s
neck. At the same time, move your left leg back a little behind the girth
and apply some pressure to the horse’s body.
 Back up: Pull back on the reins in one steady motion at the same time
you apply leg pressure to both sides of the horse. Make a kissing or
clucking sound to the horse. Continue this command for the entire time
that you want the horse to back up. Be sure to keep your body straight
in the saddle, as leaning forward will confuse your horse.
Coordinating the movements required to signal a horse takes practice. We
recommend that you have an instructor, trainer, or experienced horse person
help you with these basic human-to-horse commands.

Chapter 16: Taking Control in the Saddle
Blazing trails on your horse
Basic riding skills are just as necessary on the
trail as they are in a riding arena. Out in the
wilderness, you may find yourself in situations
where you must turn your horse, back him up,
and of course ask him to stop and go forward.
In addition to using your basic skills, you also
need to use your head out on the trail. Stick to
these trail basics to ensure the safety of your
horse, other riders, and yourself:
 Walk up and down hills. Though your horse
may want to, don’t gallop downhill. Avoid the
urge to trot uphill, too, if you can. The faster
you go up or down a hill, the more danger-
ous it is. Riding faster up or down also is bad
for your horse’s legs, and it’s a difficult habit
to break after the horse is used to doing it.
Lean forward in the saddle when going
uphill and lean back when going downhill.
This helps your horse by shifting your
weight off the end of the horse that is bear-
ing most of the animal’s (and your) weight.
 Negotiate obstacles.Sooner or later, you and
your horse are going to come across an
obstacle on the trail that your horse won’t
want to deal with. It may be a fallen tree trunk,
a mud puddle, or a big rock. Chances are, the
obstacle will be running water because many
horses are afraid to cross creeks and
streams. You can’t allow your horse to suc-
cessfully avoid the obstacle, or your horse
soon figures out that he can dodge things he
doesn’t like rather than listening to you.
If your horse refuses to cross an obstacle,
first make sure it’s safe enough to do so. Then
get off and lead the horse through or over the
obstacle. If that doesn’t work, ask your trail
buddy to take her horse over the obstacle.
Chances are, your horse will follow. If not,
don’t risk your safety by engaging in a huge
battle with your horse. Continue your ride in
another direction, and when you get home to
the stable, find an experienced horse person
or trainer who can take your horse back on
the trail to get him over his fear of that par-
ticular object.
 Don’t allow jigging.Jigging, a cross between
a walk and a trot, is something horses do
when they ‘re anxious to get home and don’t
want to walk. If your horse starts jigging and
gets away with it, you soon have a chronic
jigger on your hands. If your horse starts jig-
ging, insist that the horse walk. If he won’t
walk, turn him around in a continuous figure
eight every time he starts to jig.
 No eating! Imagine you’re a horse on a trail
ride. Everywhere you look, you see all kinds
of grasses, flowers, and shrubbery, just wait-
ing to be eaten. Walking on the trail must the
equine equivalent of strolling through a
bakery.
Horses being horses, they’re inclined to
temptation and will reach out and try to snag
a nibble at the first opportunity. However, as
mean as it sounds, don’t let your horse have
anything to eat on the trail, for three reasons:
First, many poisonous plants exist out there.
Even one mouthful of the wrong thing can
make your horse very sick. Second, if you let
your horse eat on the trail whenever the
mood strikes, pretty soon your entire ride will
be spent sitting on top of a grazing horse.
And third, if your horse has a bit in his mouth,
some of the roughage may get caught in his
windpipe, causing breathing issues.
 Warn other riders. If you have a horse that
is particularly nasty to other horses —
especially the ones that approach from
behind — tie a red ribbon at the base of his
tail as a warning to other riders that your
horse might kick.

Moving with your horse’s gaits
As you begin to ride, you start out slow and work your way up to the faster
gaits. Your first lesson is completely at the walk. As your seat and hands
improve, your instructor moves you into a trot, and ultimately to a canter, 
or slow gallop. (See Chapter 2 for more about the different gaits.)
If you’re like most beginning riders, you’re anxious to try riding a horse 
while it gallops. We don’t blame you: After all, riding a galloping horse is 
an exhilarating feeling. But you need to be patient and work your way up to
that moment when you’re secure enough in your basic riding skills where you
can handle that kind of speed. If you work hard at riding, you’ll soon experi-
ence the glorious sensation of pounding hooves and the wind in your hair.
Delving Into Post-Ride Details
After you have your fill of riding for the day, you aren’t finished with your
horse. A few tasks remain: dismounting, untacking, cooling down, and 
grooming.
Getting off your horse
Before you can do anything else in your life, you have to get off the horse or
dismount. Dismounting is much easier than mounting because you don’t have
to battle gravity. However, you still need to dismount correctly for your own
safety and for the comfort of your horse. Dismounting is virtually the same
for both English and western riders:
1. Bring your horse to a complete halt.
2. Take your right foot out of the stirrup and position your left hand. If
you are riding in an English saddle, put the reins in your left hand, and
grasp the horse’s mane at the base of the neck with the same hand. Put
your right hand on the pommel (the front of the saddle).
290
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 
 Walk him at the end of the ride. Don’t trot
or canter during the last third of your jour-
ney home. Otherwise, your horse will think
that rushing home is okay, and you’ll soon
have trouble controlling the horse when you
turn toward the stable.
 Be safe at night. When riding at dusk or at
night, wear reflective clothing (a vest is
best) so that drivers can see you.

With a western saddle, grasp the saddle horn in your left hand as you
continue to hold the reins.
3. Swing your right leg over the horse’s hindquarters — be careful not to
touch the horse as you do —  at the same time, move your right hand
to the cantle.
4. Turn so your stomach is flat against the horse and your legs are next
to one another; remove your left foot from the stirrup.
5. Slowly slide down until your feet are touching the ground.
Never let go of the reins while you’re dismounting. You need to keep control
of your horse at all times.
Untacking your horse
After dismounting, lead your horse back to the hitching post or crossties
where you left the halter. You’re now going to remove the horse’s tack.
Untacking is basically the reverse of the procedure you followed when tack-
ing up in Chapter 15.
If you ride English, be sure to run up the stirrup irons before you walk your
horse back to his halter. The purpose is to keep the irons from banging
against the horse’s side as he walks. You can run up the irons by sliding 
them up the back strap of the stirrup leather so the irons lay flat against 
the saddle. Tuck the loop of stirrup leather through the stirrup iron to 
secure it. Follow these steps to untack your horse:
1. Restrain the horse with the halter. Stand at the horse’s left side. As 
you hold the reins in your left hand, buckle the halter strap around the
horse’s neck to restrain him (see Chapter 15 for an illustration). The
halter should still be attached to the hitching post or crosstie. Unbuckle
the noseband and throatlatch, if any.
2. Remove the bridle. With your right hand, gently slide the headstall over
the horse’s ears so that the bridle comes off the horse’s head.
Be careful not to pull the bit out of the horse’s mouth when you’re
removing the bridle. Let the horse open his mouth to drop the bit 
before you pull the bridle completely off the horse’s head.
3. Return the halter to its normal position. Loop the headstall and reins
over your shoulder or a nearby post. Unbuckle the part of the halter
that is around the horse’s neck and lower the noseband just enough to
slip the halter over the horse’s head. Then buckle it again. Be careful not
to remove the halter strap completely from the horse’s neck as you do;
otherwise, you have no restraint on the horse!
291
Chapter 16: Taking Control in the Saddle

4. Remove (English) or untie (western) the saddle’s girth (or cinch). With
an English saddle, remove the girth by unbuckling first the left side of
the girth, then the right. Remove the girth completely.
If you are using a western saddle, untie the cinch knot first. Then, loop
the latigo strap several times and tuck it into the D-ring. From the right
side of the horse, lay the cinch over the seat of the saddle, and loop the
right stirrup over the saddle horn.
5. Remove the saddle. Stand on the horse’s left side, facing the saddle.
Grasp the front of the saddle pad with your left hand and the back of the
pad with your right. Lift the pad and saddle up together, up and off the
horse’s back.
6. Put the saddle on a saddle rack. The saddle pad should be on top of 
the saddle, with the wet underside of the pad facing up to dry. With an
English saddle, you may want to lay the girth over the saddle pad, wet
side up, to dry.
Cooling down and cleaning up
In the event that you haven’t already walked your horse for at least 10 min-
utes at the end of your ride, you have to do so now. Remove your horse’s
saddle and bridle as described in the preceding section, and take the horse
for a walk around the stable by his halter (see Chapter 13 for more on leading
your horse properly). Keep walking until the horse is cool. You can tell
whether the horse is cool by putting your hand on his chest. If the horse’s
chest is hot and sweaty, keep walking. The sweat should be dried from the
most of the horse’s body by the time you finish with your walk, and his
breathing should be slow and back to normal. (If the weather is warm, you
can also sponge him or hose him off with water to help him cool down.)
For the benefit of your horse’s health, never allow your horse to eat or drink
until he’s completely cooled down! A horse that eats or drinks when hot is at
risk for colic. (See Chapter 11 for details on this malady.)
Your horse needs to be groomed after you ride as well as before. Clean out
your horse’s feet and brush the horse down using the methods we describe
in Chapter 9. If your horse sweats a lot during the ride, wash the horse off
with a hose or sponge.
Catching Tricks that Naughty 
Horses Play
Horses are much like children: They have a tendency to constantly test
authority, just to make sure that it’s still there. In your horse’s mind, the 
best time to test your authority is when you’re riding.
292
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Many horses pull the stunts in the following sections just to see what they
can get away with. In other cases, these behaviors stem from genuine fear,
poor training, and insecurity on the horse’s part. Either way, you need to call
on your superior human intellect and leadership skills to convince the horse
to change his behavior. To constantly reinforce your horse’s obedience, make
sure that every move you make when riding is your idea, not the horse’s.
Bucking
You’ve seen bucking broncos on TV. Although they may look ferocious, they
actually are made to buck with the use of a device called a bucking strap, 
tied around their flanks. Rodeo riders make these horses perform by taking
advantage of the horse’s natural tendency to buck when something unpleas-
ant or frightening is on his back.
When an average saddle horse bucks, it isn’t usually with the same force as a
rodeo bronc. Nonetheless, even a moderate buck can still remove you from
the saddle if you don’t have good balance.
Average horses usually buck for one of two reasons: They have excess energy
that they need to release, or they’re in pain. If you find yourself on a bucking
horse, sit squarely in the saddle and try to pull the horse’s head up with the
reins. A horse needs to put his head down to be able to buck.
If your horse bucks frequently when you ride, try giving him more exercise on
a regular basis to release any pent-up energy. If that doesn’t help, have a vet-
erinarian examine the horse to determine whether he is suffering from leg or
back pain. If neither one of these works, contact a trainer. Your horse may be
bucking to get out of having to work — something everyone does on occasion.
If your horse bucks you off, be sure to get right back on (or have someone
else get on) and continue riding, at least for a few minutes. You may not want
to get back on board, but you need to do so to keep the horse from thinking
he can get out of work simply by unloading you.
Rearing
When a horse rears, he stands up on his hind legs, lifting his forefeet off the
ground. Most horses rear when they are very afraid of something that is
approaching them from the front, when a severe bit or hackamore is hurting
their mouths, or when they’re resisting the rider.
Rearing while being ridden is an extremely dangerous habit that you should
not tolerate. If your horse rears with you when you ask him to do something
he doesn’t want to do, you need to hang on and wait for the rear to end.
293
Chapter 16: Taking Control in the Saddle

(Don’t pull back on the reins because doing so may throw the horse over.)
Don’t ride the horse again until a trainer has worked with the animal to cure
him of this vice.
Backing up without being asked
When a horse starts backing up even though you didn’t ask him to, the horse
is trying to resist you, probably because you asked him to do something that
he doesn’t want to do.
Make sure that you’re not inadvertently telling the horse to back up. Be sure
that your reins are loose whenever you squeeze the horse to move forward. 
If your reins are loose but the horse continues to back up, then the horse is
trying to pull a fast one. To combat this maneuver, loosen your reins and
prompt the horse forward by nudging him in the ribs with your heels. Keep
nudging until the horse gives up and moves forward.
If backing up is a repeated problem with your horse, call in the services of a
professional trainer for some help.
Spooking
Horses are prey animals by nature, and so they’re always on the alert. If
something spooks a horse, his first reaction is to shy away from the offending
creature or object. Because spooking usually comes along with quick and
sudden movements in unexpected directions, riders sometimes become
unseated.
Horses typically spook at the following objects: white plastic bags blowing in
the wind, flags, balloons, umbrellas, and anything they haven’t seen before
that they can’t identify. They also get nervous when they see an object in a
place where they haven’t seen it before.
If your horse spooks for some reason, the animal is most likely frightened 
of the object. Allow the frightened horse to turn and face the object to get a
good look at it. After the horse has a moment to carefully focus on the object,
he most likely will calm down. If the horse still refuses to pass the object, you
may need to get off the horse and lead him past. For some reason, horses are
much braver when they are being led than when they are being ridden. You
can even try going over to the object and touching it yourself so your horse
sees that it’s harmless.
294
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Many things on a trail can cause your horse to spook. Hikers with big orange
backpacks, mountain bikers, and people walking their dogs are potentially
scary things to a horse. If you come across someone on the trail that your
horse is nervous about, ask the person to stand aside and refrain from moving
so the horse can pass. Encourage that person to say something; many horses
relax after they realize the strange object in front of them is the person they
just heard speak. If the horse still is too frightened to approach the person,
you may have to get off and lead the horse.
If the horse seems deathly afraid of something and refuses to calm down,
take the horse away from the object so he doesn’t become panicky and dan-
gerous. Ask a trainer or experienced horse person to help you work with the
horse to get him over this particular fear.
Running away
Most well-trained horses wouldn’t dream of running away with a rider, but on
occasion, something can frighten a horse so badly that he takes off in a blind
panic.
If you ever lose control of a horse that is running away with you, do your best
to stay on without squeezing your legs against the horse (which only makes
the horse go faster). Pull back on the reins in a continuous motion, and say
“Ho” again and again in as calm a voice as you can muster. You also can try 
to turn the horse in a circle while he’s running, because doing so often is a
good way to slow the animal down. Turn the animal by pulling the horse’s
head around using one rein as you apply pressure with the leg on the same
side as the rein you’re pulling. Take this action slowly and gradually, however,
because a sudden and dramatic jerk to the side while the horse is running
can throw him off balance.
If you have a horse that chronically runs away with you, you have a serious
problem that needs to be handled by a professional trainer.
Refusing to move
Mules aren’t the only animals that can be stubborn. Horses sometimes refuse
to budge. Because horses that are inclined to plant their feet usually are the
kind that are good at sensing a lack of confidence in a rider, beginning riders
often encounter this problem.
If you find your horse won’t move when you first get up on his back, even
though you apply leg pressure, you have a horse who isn’t very responsive
and is testing your authority. (Just to be on the safe side, have an experienced
horse person observe you to make sure that you aren’t doing something
295
Chapter 16: Taking Control in the Saddle

wrong.) You can deal with this problem by kicking the horse with your heels
and clucking or kissing to the horse to encourage the animal to move.
If this doesn’t work, get a trainer or experienced horse person to help you
deal with the problem. Spurs and a crop may do the job, but you need help 
to properly use these devices.
Another situation where a horse may refuse to move is if the animal is afraid
of something up ahead. You can tell the difference between the two kinds of
refusals by looking at the horse’s body language. A frightened horse holds his
head up high, rotates his ears forward, tenses his body, and shows the whites
of his eyes. If that’s what you see, follow our advice under the earlier section
“Spooking.” If the horse seems relaxed but simply refuses to move, you have
a resister on your hands.
Being “barn-sour”
A horse that refuses to leave the stable for a trail ride or fights you out on the
trail in an attempt to get back home is considered barn-sour. Barn-sour horses
are potentially dangerous and a real problem to retrain.
If you have a horse that is barn-sour, your first step is to make sure that the
horse doesn’t have a physical reason for his attitude. Have a vet examine the
horse’s mouth, poll, girth, and back to make sure that the animal isn’t in pain.
If the horse is okay, then the attitude results from a lack of respect for rider
authority. You need to gain the horse’s obedience before you can expect the
animal to allow you take him away from the barn, a place that he associates
with food and security. Start by schooling the horse at home, in an arena.
Practice moving forward, backing up, turning, and stopping. The horse needs
to follow your commands completely before you attempt to take him out on
the trail. (Be sure to reward him with a pat and kind words when he does
what you want.)
When you go out for the first time after a couple of months of schooling, go
with another rider for your own safety, just in case the horse misbehaves.
Remind the horse throughout the ride that you’re in charge by asking him to
stop and back up. When it’s time to turn around and head for home, keep the
horse’s gait at a walk for the entire ride back to the stable. Avoid feeding the
horse immediately after you return to the barn.
Barn-sour horses are notoriously hard to retrain. If none of the above work,
you have to bring in a professional trainer.

Staying Safe on (and 
around) Your Horse
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to wear
 Being safe on the ground
 Keeping yourself and other riders secure
H
orses are a real joy to be around, but the fact is, they’re much bigger
than you are. The average horse weighs almost ten times as much as
the average human female. Consequently, humans have to be careful around
horses to make sure that equine bulk doesn’t end up somehow becoming a
liability to the human body.
In this chapter, we give you the details you need to be safe around horses,
regardless of whether you’re on the ground, in the saddle, alone, or with
other riders. This chapter also gives you tips about how to keep your horse
safe from himself, too!
Dressing the Right Way
Believe it or not, the clothing you wear around horses and your safety go
hand in hand. Wearing — or not wearing — something when handling these
cumbersome beasts can mean the difference between an ambulance ride to
the emergency room and going to bed that night unscathed. We cover hel-
mets, pants, footwear, and jewelry in the following sections. Be sure to check
out Chapter 6 for additional info on what to wear when you’re around horses.

Wearing a safety helmet
Probably the most important part of your equestrian wardrobe is the safety
helmet, because it protects your skull and brain. A safety helmet can protect
you in the following ways:
 On the ground: If you’re planning to be around a horse that is known 
for being difficult to handle in certain situations (freaks out while load-
ing in a trailer, has a deadly fear of clippers, needs to be given some 
bad-tasting medicine), wearing a helmet is a wise precaution.
 In the saddle: The fall from a horse’s back is not a short one, and it can
take place at a high speed. In far too many instances, helmetless riders
have fallen off their horses, hit their heads on a hard surface, and sus-
tained permanent brain damage. Wearing a safety helmet designed
specifically for equestrians can protect the most important part of your
body — your brain.
Wearing a safety helmet is especially important for children. Their heads tend
to be more breakable than those of adults.
Putting on the proper pants
The same people who ride around in tennis shoes usually ride in shorts, too,
and that’s something we don’t recommend. In fact, we’re not really sure how
people can stand riding in shorts. Bare skin has to rub against a leather saddle
only for a few minutes to make you realize that shorts and riding don’t go
together. An occasional bareback rider can get away with riding in shorts,
although that rider’s skin doesn’t stand a chance should he or she take a spill.
Your discipline determines the type of pants you should wear when you’re
riding. English riders wear riding tights or breeches. If you’re riding western,
wear jeans. No matter what, closely fitted pants are best to prevent chaffing
when you ride. For the greatest comfort, buy pants made specifically for
riding.
Stepping into safe footwear
You should always wear protective footwear whenever you’re around horses.
Always wear heavy leather boots whether you’re planning to ride your horse
or just going for a simple grooming session. Follow these rules to keep your
tootsies safe:
 Wear heavy boots when working with a horse on the ground. Heavy
boots are the footwear of choice for horse handlers, for good reason.
Sooner or later, if you spend enough time around horses, one of these
298
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

hulks is going to step on your foot. When he does, you’ll have a few hun-
dred pounds of pressure on your foot, conveniently punctuated with a
weighty metal shoe. If you’re wearing tennis shoes or sandals when that
happens, you’ll be walking around with a cane for quite a while. We rec-
ommend wearing equestrian boots, which are heavier than your average
shoe, for maximum protection.
 Wear riding shoes or boots when you’re in the saddle. You may’ve
seen people wearing tennis shoes while riding — a major no-no in our
opinion. Riding shoes or boots are made especially for equestrians.
They’re the safest form of footwear to don when riding. One reason:
Riding shoes and boots have a heel that keeps your foot from sliding
through the stirrup and trapping your leg — an important factor if you
happen to fall from your horse.
Protecting Yourself on the Ground
You may not believe it, but the majority of your time around horses is spent
on the ground and not on the horse’s back. You’ll groom, feed, and clean up
your steed on a regular basis. All this time spent in close proximity to your
horse means greater odds that an accident will occur when on the ground.
That is one reason why ground safety is so important with horses.
Another reason is that when you’re on the ground, you’re vulnerable to being
stepped on, kicked, or knocked down. Sure, if something goes wrong while
you’re riding, the ground is at least a five-foot plunge away. But when you’re
handling a horse from terra firma, more stuff can happen besides falling.
In the following sections, we cover how to stay safe when you’re cleaning a
horse’s hooves, moving around a horse in close quarters, leading a horse,
and tying a horse. We also give you a few warning signs that a horse is about
to make a sudden move. Check out Chapter 13 for more info about handling a
horse from the ground.
Caring for a horse’s hooves
Horse people always are fussing with their horses’ feet. Horses constantly are
getting their feet cleaned, their fetlock (or ankle) hair clipped, or their
hooves brushed with hoof polish.
The human urge when performing these hoof-related tasks (covered in
Chapter 9) is to kneel down on the ground next to the hoof. After all, from
this vantage point, you can get your work done much more efficiently. The
problem, though, is that kneeling close to a horse’s feet puts you in a danger-
ous position from which you can’t easily retreat. If the horse suddenly moves
299
Chapter 17: Staying Safe on (and around) Your Horse

to the side, he’ll likely step on you. If something scares him, you can even be
trampled.
When you’re fiddling with a horse’s hoof, bend or crouch instead of kneeling.
By bending or crouching, you keep your feet beneath you, enabling you to
move quickly if the horse’s body comes your way.
Remember: Don’t hold the hoof by the tip; doing so won’t give you enough
control if the horse tries to pull the leg away from you. If you hold the hoof
only by the tip, you can easily lose your grip on the hoof and drop it on your
own foot! Instead, keep your hand under the hoof or under the pastern (the
area between the hoof and the ankle). Check out Chapter 2 for information
about horse and hoof anatomy.
Keep your head out of the field of motion of the horse’s leg; don’t put your
head in an area where the horse can inadvertently conk you if he quickly
jerks up his leg to remove a fly or reacts to the tickle of clippers. As a child,
one of your authors (okay, it was me, Audrey) stuck her head behind a
horse’s foreleg while clipping a fetlock and received a lump on her forehead
roughly the size of Nevada.
Being in close quarters with a horse
When you find yourself in close quarters with a horse, the reality of the
horse’s mass becomes much more apparent. Your comparatively minute
human form can easily be squashed if a horse pins you up against a wall.
Horses that are well trained know not to encroach on a human’s space. With
these horses, you can merely push on the too-close body and cluck your
tongue to get the horse to move over and give you some breathing room.
Unfortunately, not all horses have learned this lesson, which is why you don’t
need to take chances with your well-being by being in a position that enables
a horse to pen you in.
Follow these simple rules to keep yourself out of harm’s way in close 
quarters:
 Never wedge yourself between a horse and an unmovable object. Find
a way to move the horse if you don’t have enough room to gain access
to that side of the horse.
 Never enter a box stall with a strange horse without finding out
whether the animal is okay with your presence. Nothing is more terri-
fying than finding yourself inside a small space with a horse who hates
you. If the horse pins his ears back, rushes at you, or turns his rear end
toward you, stay away!
300
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

 Never stand directly behind a horse (especially one you don’t know).
Although occurrences are rare, horses occasionally kick out at people
walking or standing behind them, causing serious injury to the kick’s
victim.
If you need to pass close behind a strange horse, make sure that the
horse knows you’re there, and pass very close to the horse’s body,
nearly touching it. That way, if the horse tries to kick, you’ll make con-
tact only with the point of the hock (or elbow of the back leg) and not
the full-force of the hoof.
 Make sure that the horse sees you: When you approach a horse that 
is loose in a stall, speak to the animal first so that it turns around and
looks at you before you enter the stall. Gauge the horse’s body language
to make sure that it is calm and receptive to your approach. (Read on, or
see Chapter 2, to find out more about how to read equine body language.)
Recognizing some dangerous horse moves
Horses typically make maneuvers that put the humans in jeopardy — although
to be fair to the horses, the poor creatures rarely mean to do so. Regardless of
whether the move is accidental, you still need to know what to watch out for.
Being forewarned about the following moves, you stand a better chance of get-
ting out of the way in time:
 Head jerks: If a horse wants you to get away from his head, he jerks it
upward and sometimes to the side at the same time.
 Swinging body: Remember these key points about equine physics:
When a horse’s front end moves to the left (he pivots on his front
hooves), the back end concurrently moves to the right, and vice versa.
 Sideways moves: If a horse is afraid of something on his right-hand side,
he will leap to the left, and vice versa.
 Forward we go: If something spooks a horse from behind, the horse
moves forward — rapidly.
 Backward ho: If you approach a horse from the front, holding something
he wants to avoid (medication, dewormer, or a frightening object, for
example), he will throw up his head, place all of his weight on his
haunches, and back up at significant speed. If this happens, don’t pull
back on the lead rope because doing so only excites the horse more and
causes further backing up. Just relax, hold the scary object behind your
back, talk softly to the horse, and give the big guy a chance to settle
down.
301
Chapter 17: Staying Safe on (and around) Your Horse

Leading a horse
Leading sounds simple enough — just walk with the lead rope and the horse
follows, right? Well, yeah, but what happens if something scares the horse
from behind? If you’re directly in front of the horse, you’re going to get 
trampled.
Horse people have discovered that leading a horse from his left side, just at
the shoulder, considerably reduces your chances of being stepped on or run
over. If you lead a horse in this way, the worst thing your horse can do is step
on your foot, and that’s much better than being trampled, don’t you think?
(See Chapter 13 for an illustration showing the correct way to lead your
horse.)
Here are some other points to remember when leading a horse:
 Never wrap the lead line around your hand or hold the loops of the
lead rope. If the horse pulls back or takes off, you’ll get dragged along
on a rough ride. Instead, hold the part of the rope near the horse’s head
in your right hand and the loose end in your left hand.
 Hold the lead rope close to the halter. Doing so gives you better con-
trol over the horse’s head and prevents you and the horse from tripping
over slack in the line.
 Never lead a horse with your hand in his halter. If the horse pulls back
or runs away, your hand can get caught and you can be dragged.
Moving around a tied horse
Many horses feel vulnerable when they’re tied to a hitching post or crossties.
Something about having their heads restrained can really set them off.
Chapter 13 has even more details about tying up horses and dealing with bad
behavior, but to avoid accidents, follow these basic rules of safety around
tied horses:
 Use a short tie. Whoever came up with the phrase “enough rope to hang
himself” must have known a horse. If you tie a horse up at a hitching
post with too much slack in the lead rope, the horse inevitably gets a
foot hung up in the rope or ends up with the rope over his neck. Always
tie a horse with a short rope (12 inches of slack is a good length) so he
can’t get himself into trouble.
 Use safety restraints: When tying a horse to a hitching post or horse
trailer, always use a safety knot. A safety knot enables you to quickly
release a panicking horse’s lead rope. If you’re cross-tying your horse,
use quick-release snaps on crossties and light ropes that break easily if
the horse pulls back.
302
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

 Never duck underneath a horse’s neck to get to the other side (even
though you may be tempted to and even if you’ve seen other
horsepeople doing it). Instead, take the long way and walk around the
horse’s front or back. Many horses don’t mind a human walking under
their necks, but enough do that you can end up with a panicked horse
and a seriously injured human.
 Use the frontal approach. All horses have a propensity for freaking out
and pulling back when they’re tied. If you’ve ever seen a horse throw all
his weight on his hindquarters and rip a hitching post out of the ground,
then you know that pulling back is a terrifying and dangerous habit.
Some horses do it routinely, but others need serious provocation before
pulling this stunt.
To avoid instigating a horse to pull back, always be slow and quiet when
approaching from the front. If you need to move toward the horse with
an object in your hand, watch the horse’s body language carefully to
determine whether the horse is scared and a pullback is imminent (see
Chapter 2 for details on equine body language).
Being Secure in the Saddle
You can have plenty of fun riding a horse, but you need to keep safety in
mind at all times if you’re going to continue to have fun. Getting hurt is a sure
way to ruin the party.
When riding, several different safety angles come into play, such as checking
your tack and knowing the etiquette for riding with other people. Remembering
all the stuff in the following sections may take some concentration at first, but
in time, it will become second nature. (Be sure to flip to Chapter 16 for general
information about maintaining control while you’re riding.)
Inspecting your tack first
Having quality tack (riding equipment) in good condition is pretty important
if you want to have a safe horseback ride. Just like the timing belt in your
car’s engine, tack can break at the most inopportune times if you don’t regu-
larly inspect it.
Before every ride, do a cursory inspection of your tack to make sure that no
accidents are waiting to happen. See Chapter 6 for details on the following
items:
 The bridle: Check it to make sure that all the buckles are tightly fas-
tened and all the pieces are securely attached. Check the stitching to
make sure it’s secure, too.
303
Chapter 17: Staying Safe on (and around) Your Horse

 The girth: On English saddles, inspect the buckles on both sides to
make sure they’re securely fastened. On western saddles, be sure that
the left latigo strap is snugly tied to the saddle’s D-ring, and the right
latigo is securely buckled to the cinch.
 The stirrups: On English saddles, check to make sure that the stirrup
leathers are securely buckled and positioned on the stirrup bar. For
western saddles, inspect the stirrup buckle to make sure that it isn’t
loose.
If you ride English, run your stirrup irons up the leathers so the irons are
flush with the saddle skirt after you dismount from your horse. Doing so
keeps your irons from catching on anything and from banging around on
your horse.
Riding by yourself
Riding alone can be a peaceful and relaxing experience. However, to ensure
your safety when you’re out on your own, follow these precautions:
 If you’ll be out on the trail, make sure that someone knows where you
are going and when you plan to return.
 Carry a cell phone with you. Keep the cell phone on your body, not
attached to your saddle. That way, if you and your horse part ways, you
still have a way to call for help.
 Stay on marked trails and make certain that you have a map or know
your way around.
Flip to Chapter 16 for additional safety info.
Riding with other horse folks
Riding is most fun when done in groups. Cruising the trail with your friends
or riding around an arena with a buddy or two can be a blast. In situations
where horses are kept at boarding stables and boarders share riding facili-
ties, riding in groups is not usually a choice; it’s mandatory simply because
everyone is forced to use the same arenas and trails at the same time.
Riders must take certain safety precautions when they’re around other riders
and horses. Following the rules in the next two sections helps keep you and
your fellow equestrians safe and makes you a popular person around the
barn!
304
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Adhering to arena etiquette
Riding is a dignified hobby, and riders are expected to behave a certain way
when they’re astride a horse. Nearly all of these expected behaviors are
related to safety, and they keep you in good stead with the other riders and
their horses.
Follow these guidelines when riding in an arena with other riders:
 Slow going: When a cowboy wants to go for a ride in the movies, he
simply leaps onto his horse and gallops off in a flurry. In the real world,
equestrians don’t behave that way unless they want to do harm to their
horses and incur the wrath of everyone around them.
When you first mount your horse, walk slowly to the riding arena. Don’t
trot or canter through the aisles of the stable, and don’t stress your
horse by tearing off into a gallop from a standstill. This behavior labels
you as a yahoo and puts you and your horse in all kinds of physical
danger.
 Stay back: When you’re riding in a head-to-tail situation, such as around
the perimeter of an arena, keep your horse several feet away from the
horse in front of you. Most horses tolerate other horses behind them,
but some won’t. As a result, crowding can end up with your horse being
kicked and even seriously hurt.
If you have a horse who kicks when other horses get too close, tie a red
ribbon at the base of your horse’s tail to warn other riders at horse
shows, organized trail rides, or other events. Likewise, when you see a
horse with a red ribbon on another horse’s tail, stay back! The ribbon is
a warning that your horse may be kicked if you get too close.
 Rear approach: If you’re approaching a horse from behind while in the
arena, do not run your horse up behind that rider. If you do, the rider’s
horse almost certainly will spook or take off, and you can be the cause
of a serious accident. Instead, if you’re trotting or cantering and going to
pass another rider from the rear while that rider is at the walk (her
horse is walking), give the rider and horse a wide berth so you don’t
upset the horse.
 Passing: When riding in an arena, you’re bound to find yourself going in
one direction while one or more riders are traveling the opposite way.
When passing one another in a riding arena, riders use the left-shoulder-to-
left-shoulder rule. When riders pass one another in opposite directions,
their left shoulders pass each other. To accomplish this feat, you may
need to stay close to the rail so the approaching rider passes you on
your left. Or, you may need to stay to the inside or middle of the arena,
away from the rail, so that an approaching rider passes you to the left.
(To understand left-shoulder-to-left-shoulder passing, see Figure 17-1.)
305
Chapter 17: Staying Safe on (and around) Your Horse

If you need to be on the inside or outside when you’re approaching a
horse and the left-shoulder rule won’t work for some reason, you can
call “inside” or “outside” to the other rider to indicate which direction
you plan to go.
 Be quiet: Again, the movies come to mind. Yelling, hollering, and yee-
hawing while on horseback is fine for actors in westerns, but in real life,
doing so frightens your horse, annoys others, and makes you look like a
dope.
The only exception to this rule is when you’re riding in gymkhana or
some other competitive speed event where such vocalizations are con-
sidered acceptable because they encourage the horse to go faster (see
Chapter 18 for more details about such events).

shoulder-to-
left-shoulder

306
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Staying safe on the trail
Trail riders also need to follow these rules of safety and etiquette while enjoy-
ing the wide-open spaces:
 Approaching: When approaching another rider, if you are trotting or
loping, slow to a walk and maintain your slow pace until you’re well past
the other horse.
 Passing: When passing another rider on the trail, do so at a walk. Many
horses can become out of control when they hear or see a horse trotting
or loping up behind them. Make sure the rider ahead of you knows
where you are and is okay with you passing, especially on narrow trails.
 Spooking horses: If you see another rider in trouble ahead of you on the
trail, either offer to help (if you can) or stop and wait until that person
has his or her horse under control before you proceed.
 Be quiet: When passing another rider, avoid yelling or doing anything
that may spook the other horse.
 Blind curves: When riding on narrow trails in high brush, go slowly
around blind curves. This rule is for your safety as well as the safety of
others, because a hiker, a mountain biker, or another rider may be
approaching from the opposite direction.
 Dismounted riders: Don’t try to ride past someone who is attempting to
mount a horse. Stop and wait until the rider is safely in the saddle before
proceeding.

ompeting with your horse as your partner is one of the most fun and
rewarding things you can do. When you show your horse, you put your
best feet forward (both your own and your horse’s), telling the world “Hey,
look what we can do!”
Equine sports run the gamut from simple stuff you can do with just about any
horse to complex events that require teams of horses. Some are easy to par-
ticipate in; others call for a considerable investment of money and time. To
find the sport that’s best for you — and your horse if you already have one —
you need to do some research along with some soul-searching. You can begin
your search for the right competition for you and your horse by reading the
descriptions we provide in this chapter. The descriptions should give you a
good idea of what’s out there.
Keeping Traditions in Hunt Seat
Hunt seat is extremely popular in the United States and is the discipline you
most often see when people are described as “riding English.” These riders
always use a hunt-seat saddle, with a seat that is inclined slightly forward
(see Chapter 6 for details on the hunt-seat saddle and other hunt-seat gear).
The apparel worn in hunt-seat classes is based on British tradition, too. A hunt
cap, hunt jacket, breeches, and high boots are the apparel judges expect to see
in the show ring. This extremely traditional sport discourages individuality in
appearance, so nearly all riders at a given show are dressed in almost exactly
the same way.

Hunt seat is primarily an arena sport, offering both jumping and flat classes.
The latter are classes that don’t involve jumping. (Check out “Getting a Leg
Up on Jumping Competitions” later in this chapter for details about events
focusing just on jumping.) If you choose to compete in hunt seat, you’ll com-
pete in a variety of classes. Equitation is one of these classes, where your
riding form is judged either “on the flat” or “over fences.” In hunters, your
horse’s form and style over a course of fences is judged. The fences range
anywhere from 2 to 4 feet in height, depending on the class. These classes 
are staged within different divisions, based on the age and expertise of either
the horse or the rider.
You can ride and compete on just about any breed in hunt-seat classes,
although judges typically favor Thoroughbred and Thoroughbred-type
horses, because these horses are the types traditionally used in the sport 
of fox hunting. Because jumping is an integral part of hunt-seat showing, 
you must become a proficient rider over fences.
Performing Precisely in Dressage
One of the oldest equine disciplines in the world, dressage dates back to train-
ing methods developed in ancient Greece. One of the Olympic disciplines,
dressage has been a traditional favorite in Europe for centuries and is gaining
considerable popularity in the United States.
Dressage, an English discipline, consists of a series of subtle maneuvers that
are meant to emphasize the horse’s natural movement. Horse-and-rider
teams perform in a rectangular-shaped arena marked with a series of letters.
These letters act as targets for particular movements during the dressage
test. Think of dressage movements as the compulsory exercises in figure
skating, with the letters functioning as spatial indicators of correct position-
ing of horse and rider.
Dressage riders at the lower levels of competition can wear the same type of
clothing seen in the hunt-seat arena: a hunt cap, hunt jacket, breeches, and
boots. In the upper levels, however, protocol dictates that dressage riders
wear a black derby, white breeches, a black jacket, black high boots, and a
white stock tie.
In dressage, horse-and-rider teams compete at different levels depending on
their expertise. Judges score dressage participants on how close to perfect
the horse-and-rider team performs precise movements. The scores of com-
peting riders are compared at the end of each competition, and the riders
with the highest scores in each level receive awards. Though riders techni-
cally are competing with each other in these events, most are more con-
cerned with improving their own individual scores from one show to the next
than they are about beating out the other riders.
310
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

You can show horses of any breed in dressage, as long as they are physically
and mentally capable of performing the required exercises. Thoroughbreds are
popular in the sport, although warmbloods are most common in the higher
levels of dressage competition because of their extraordinary athleticism.
Being Flashy in Saddle Seat
Saddle seat is one of the English disciplines, although the saddle for this type
of riding is much different than hunt-seat or dressage saddles. Show saddles,
as saddle-seat saddles are called, have a flatter seat than other English sad-
dles. The saddle’s construction forces the rider to sit far behind the horse’s
withers (the rise on the horse’s back at the base of the neck), thus taking the
rider’s weight off the front part of the horse and encouraging the animal to
show off the high action of his front legs.
Judging in saddle-seat classes typically is based on the horse’s action or the
rider’s position in the saddle, depending on whether the class is a pleasure
class, in which the horse is judged, or an equitation class, in which the rider is
judged. The class you prefer to enter depends on a number of factors, includ-
ing your and your horse’s abilities. Many riders enter both types of classes.
For a horse to be successful in this discipline, he must be a flashy creature
with animated gaits. In fact, horses in this event often have the charm of Cary
Grant, the grace of Fred Astaire, and the energy of Robin Williams.
A saddle-seat horse usually is ridden with a double bridle (see Chapter 6 for a
description of the double bridle) because it enables the rider to exert more
control over the position of the horse’s head. Saddle-seat riders are expected
to wear derbies, jackets, and jodhpurs (special riding pants) in the show ring.
Competitions in the saddle-seat discipline most commonly are seen at breed
shows at which competitors are riding gaited horses, such as the American
Saddlebred, the Tennessee Walking Horse, and the Racking Horse. Some all-
breed shows and single-breed shows also stage saddle-seat classes for
Arabians, Morgans, and some other high-stepping breeds. You also see
classes for saddle-seat riders at shows for gaited breeds, and at many single-
breed and all-breed shows. A variety of different saddle-seat classes usually
are offered, depending on the breed and type of show.
Working with Special Skills in Western
The western discipline developed more than a hundred years ago in America
from the cowboy’s need for a safe and comfortable way to ride horses among
vast herds of cattle. This legacy is not lost in the modern world today: Many
311
Chapter 18: Competing on Horseback

western events — specifically rodeos — feature classes designed to test the
cattle skills of today’s horses and riders. Even those classes that don’t
involve actual cows have a basis in working with cattle.
In most western classes, you see a very specific type of horse. You won’t find
many lanky Thoroughbreds or cobby Welsh Ponies here. The Quarter Horse
dominates this discipline, although other western-type breeds like the Paint
and Appaloosa also are common.
The following sections describe the most popular classes in western riding.
Pleasure classes
Western pleasure, along with its cousins western horsemanship and western
equitation, are the most popular classes in western showing. In these events,
riders demonstrate their own riding skills and the abilities of their horses.
Horses in these events are expected to carry their riders quietly, comfortably,
and obediently, all on a loose rein.
In western pleasure classes, horses are judged for their slow, steady move-
ment and ability to carry their necks at the same level as their backs. The
horse’s conformation (the way he’s physically constructed) weighs heavily in
the judging because only horses built a certain way are capable of the move-
ment required of a western pleasure horse. In western equitation classes, how-
ever, the emphasis is on the rider’s riding skills and position in the saddle,
rather than on the horse’s conformation and movement. In horsemanship
classes, riders must demonstrate that they can efficiently put their horses
through a series of gaits and maneuvers. Horses in horsemanship classes
must be obedient, responding quickly to their riders’ cues.
Western riders must be good riders to be successful, and they must enjoy
wearing a western hat! Both horse and rider apparel are important in these
classes, especially in western pleasure. Expensive, silver-laden saddles and
bridles are common, and riders are expected to wear a hat, fringed chaps,
western boots, and a western vest or riding jacket.
Showmanship
Many of the riders who compete in pleasure and horsemanship classes also
participate in western showmanship classes. In western showmanship, com-
petitors don’t actually ride the horse. Instead, they handle the horse from the
ground and present him to the judge. The judge evaluates the handler’s abil-
ity to show off the horse (make him look his best). The horse’s conformation
is not judged, although having an attractive and obedient horse certainly is
helpful.
312
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Any western-type horse can compete in western showmanship. Horses wear
a special show halter, and handlers are expected to wear a western hat, a
western vest or show jacket, long pants (jeans or special slacks made just for
this class), and western boots.
Gymkhana
The faint of heart need not apply for the exciting, fast-paced sport of gymkhana
(or gaming, as it’s known in some parts of the United States). If you decide to
compete in gymkhana, you’ll find yourself galloping at top speed across arenas,
making sharp turns while trying to beat the clock.
You typically see two gymkhana games at horse shows and rodeos, where
gymkhana is especially popular: barrel racing and pole bending.
 In barrel racing classes, metal or plastic barrels usually are set up in a
clover pattern. The horse-and-rider team runs through the pattern at top
speed, making a complete turn around each barrel as they pass it.
 In pole bending classes, a series of poles are set up in a straight line, and
the horse-and-rider team weaves in and out of the poles at a gallop.
Competitors ride the barrel racing and pole bending patterns one horse-and-
rider team at a time. To pull off these feats, gymkhana horses are trained to
make balanced turns and respond quickly to their riders, all the while going
as fast as they possibly can.
Gymkhana is a popular sport for good reason: Not only is it exciting to per-
form and to watch, but it’s also accessible to many equestrians. Although it
can be more dangerous than some of the other tamer western events, kids,
especially, love gymkhana because it’s so much fun. Gymkhana horses don’t
have to be expensive or highly trained to be successful at local events and
costly tack and attire are not necessary, because no dress code is enforced in
the ring. Rider and horse simply need to be athletic and dedicated to the
sport to succeed.
Reining
The sport of reining is a western event that arose from the discipline’s work-
ing legacy. Originally used as a way to maneuver horses around cattle, reining
has become a challenging sport that requires substantial training for horse
and rider. Reining horses are asked to perform spins, circles, and sliding
stops at the slightest cue from the rider.
313
Chapter 18: Competing on Horseback

Reining horses are judged on their ability to execute the various reining
maneuvers with ease and grace. In traditional reining classes, the horse-and-
rider team performs maneuvers and patterns alone in an arena before a
judge. A newer event called freestyle reining requires the horse-and-rider
team to perform to music. A popular favorite among spectators, the horse-
and-rider teams sometimes wear costumes that coincide with the rider’s
musical theme. For example, at one Quarter Horse show, a freestyle reining
horse and rider were both dressed like Madonna and performed their reining
pattern to the song “Vogue.” In freestyle reining, spectators usually decide
which team wins the class with the help of an applause meter.
Other than the costumes for freestyle reining, reining horses and their riders
require no special attire. Neat, well-cared-for tack and western clothing is all
that judges expect in the show ring.
Trail class
Good trail horses are willing to negotiate just about any obstacle you put in
their way. This concept is the basis for the trail class that you find at many
western shows. In this arena event, horses have to cope with a variety of
objects that can possibly show up on the trail.
Trail class exhibitors compete one at a time in an arena that is set up with an
obstacle course. Typical obstacles include a gate to open and close; a mail-
box to open; and a tarp, a small bridge, and wooden poles laid on the ground
to walk over.
For a horse to be successful in trail classes, the animal must be very obedi-
ent, responsive, and willing to trust the rider’s judgment. The horse must also
be proficient at a maneuver called the side pass, which enables the horse to
move in and around pole obstacles by walking sideways. Good trail horses
also are skilled at backing up on command.
Trail classes require no special apparel, although successful horse-and-rider
teams usually wear show tack and western show attire.
Cow classes
A number of different cow classes exist. Some require no direct contact with
the cow, but others are rough-and-tumble events that cause the cow quite a
bit of angst (and which get many animal rights activists up in arms) and
sometimes result in broken bones for the rider. If you’re interested in show-
ing in cow classes, gauge each sport individually and pick the one that’s best
suited to you. Following is a review of the most popular cow classes that are
commonly seen at horse shows and rodeos. Keep in mind that Quarter
Horses, Paint Horses, and Appaloosas dominate these sports.

Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Because cow classes are based on the working cowboy tradition, fancy tack
and clothing are not expected in the ring. All that cow classes require are
good working gear and typical western clothing.
Cutting
Cutting is one of the gentlest of the cattle classes, requiring no direct contact
with the cow. The sport has its roots in the 19th century, when the task of
cutting individual cattle from the herd was part of a cowhand’s job. In those
days, cutting was a basic skill for every cowboy and his horse.
Today, cutting has been refined to a delicate art. The horse-and-rider team is
placed in a pen with a small herd of cattle and asked to separate a cow from
the group. Because cattle stick together at nearly any cost, separating one of
them from a herd is a real challenge for the team. The horse and rider are
judged on how fast and effectively they move the designated cow away from
the group. Judges look for horses that are athletic and have innate cow sense,
which is almost a psychic ability to know what the cow is going to do next.
What’s interesting about this sport is that the rider’s primary job in cutting is
to not interfere with the horse. The rider simply tells the horse which cow to
cut, and the rest is up to the horse. After the horse knows which cow needs
working, the rider lets the horse do his job.
Team penning
Team penning is an exciting event that is rapidly growing in popularity. Unlike
other western events, team penning calls for cooperation between several
horse-and-rider teams. In team-penning classes, three teams must sort three
designated cows from a small herd and pen them in a paddock located at the
opposite end of the arena while making the fewest number of errors in the
process. The penning is timed, and the fastest, most accurate team wins.
Much of the growing popularity of team penning is attributable to the fact
that just about any horse can participate, as long as the horse is fast, obedi-
ent, and has good cow sense.
Calf roping
Calf roping is another cow class that sprung from the cowboy’s job. In the
Wild West, cowboys used ropes to capture and restrain calves at branding
time out on the range. These days, most calf roping goes on in the perfor-
mance arena at rodeos, where it is a timed event.
Riders can choose from two types of roping: single roping and team roping.
 In single roping, a horse-and-rider team chases down a calf in the arena
until the rider gets a rope around the calf’s neck. After the rope lands on
the calf, the rider ties her to the saddle horn, the horse stops short, and
the rider leaps off, runs to the calf, and ties three of her legs together.
315
Chapter 18: Competing on Horseback

The object is to accomplish the task in the shortest amount of time 
possible.
Another version of single roping, called breakaway roping, doesn’t
require the rider to tie the calf. As soon as the rope becomes snug on
the calf’s neck, it breaks away from the saddle horn and the timer stops
the watch.
 Competitive team roping is performed by two horse-and-rider teams.
One team is considered the heeler, the other the header. The heeler’s job
is to rope the calf’s back legs, while the header gets the rope around the
calf’s neck.
Reined cow horse
Tradition is celebrated in reined cow horse competitions, where horses older
than 3 are put to the test. In honor of the renowned California cow horse that
served as the mount of the Vaqueros (Mexican cowboys) in the 1800s, reined
cow horse contests illustrated the instincts and talents of today’s western
breeds.
Reined cow horse contests consist of three events, which must be performed
by the same horse: herd work, rein work, and cow work.
 Herd work consists of cutting (covered earlier in this chapter), where 
a single cow is removed from a herd and kept separate for a period of
time.
 Rein work involves performing a reining pattern and calls for deep
training in this discipline (see the earlier section on reining for details).
 Cow work is the part of the competition that requires the horse to con-
trol the movements of a single cow along a fence.
Cowboy mounted shooting
If you ever wanted to be a cowboy (or cowgirl), a sport called cowboy
mounted shooting was made for you. This activity utilizes the tools of every
well-respected cowboy and cowgirl: a good horse, a sure shot, and a pen-
chant for excitement. Although cowboy mounted shooting is a competitive
event, it is so much fun that it belongs in the category of pure enjoyment.
Cowboy mounted shooting is growing in popularity, in large part because the
sport attempts to capture the excitement and spirit of the days of the Old
West. Almost as fun to watch as it is to participate in, mounted shooting fea-
tures skilled riders dressed in authentic 1800s cowboy apparel with their fast
horses trained to run patterns at top speed. Riders use guns that are reminis-
cent of the type used by cowboys and cowgirls in the days of the Wild West.
Just about any breed can be used in this sport.
316
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Cowboy mounted shooting participants race against one another on horse-
back. The rider attempts to pop as many balloons as possible using a .45 cal-
iber pistol loaded with blanks, while traversing a designated pattern on his
steed at a dead run. Cowboy mounted shooters race each other two at a
time, with the winner of each race advancing to compete with the winners of
other match races until the two fastest and most accurate horse and rider
teams battle it out for all the marbles.
Competitors participate in one of four divisions: men’s, women’s, seniors’
(for folks ages 55 and older), and wrangler (for children 11 and younger).
Children who participate in the sport use Hollywood-style cap pistols instead
of real guns when they’re on horseback, although they are allowed to fire .45
caliber pistols when shooting targets on foot and accompanied by a parent.
To be a part of cowboy mounted shooting, your biggest asset will be a pen-
chant for speed, a desire to step back in time, comfort handling a gun, and
good horsemanship.
Educating Yourself at Breed Shows
One of the benefits of owning a registered purebred horse is the opportunity
that it gives you to compete in breed shows. Regional breed clubs, represent-
ing just about every popular breed, stage local shows at least once a year.
These club shows are a great way to meet people in your area and educate
yourself about your chosen breed (see Chapter 3 to find out more about dif-
ferent horse breeds).
The classes that breed shows offer depend quite a bit on the particular breed
being exhibited. Clubs emphasize different aspects of their breed’s history
and style. Breed shows proffer a wide variety of classes, each of which is spe-
cific to the type of horse being shown.
Although we don’t have room here to name every possible class you’ll see at
a show for a particular breed, a few popular classes are seen at a variety of
different breed shows.
Halter classes
In halter classes — some of the most popular events at breed shows — horses
are led into the ring wearing nothing but a fancy show halter. They are asked
to stand and trot in front of the judge without a rider as the judge evaluates
their conformation and movement.
317
Chapter 18: Competing on Horseback

Judges use a breed standard when evaluating horses in a halter class. The
breed standard specifies the physical characteristics of a theoretically per-
fect example of the breed. We say theoretically perfect, because in real life,
you won’t find a perfect horse — every horse has faults. The judge has this
standard committed to memory, and mentally compares each horse in the
ring to this ideal.
Halter classes typically are broken down by age and gender. Horses as young
as 4 months of age are shown in weanling classes that are divided by sex.
Mares are judged together, as are stallions, and also geldings (see Chapter 4
for an explanation of these terms). Some shows even stage Get of Sire and Get
of Dam classes, in which several offspring of a particular stallion or mare are
brought into the ring for evaluation, with the award going to the parent horse.
Heritage classes
One of the most exciting breed classes for spectators and exhibitors alike is
the heritage class. In heritage classes, horse and rider are decked out in dress
that represents the breed’s history.
Not all breeds have these classes, but the ones that do make the most of the
event. In Appaloosa heritage classes, for example, riders wear Native American
regalia, while the horses are tacked up in authentic Native American saddles,
bridles, and other trappings. At Arabian breed shows, the heritage class fea-
tures horses and riders wearing the spectacular native dress of the Bedouins.
The cast of Lawrence of Arabia had nothing on the participants in these
classes.
318
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 
The pitfalls of horse competitions
Horse shows, without question, are plenty of
fun, but some not-so-great stuff comes along
with showing your horse. Pressure is one of
these unfortunate side effects. No matter how
casual you are about your show career, you’re
still under considerable stress at times. Stress
comes with assorted show-related pressures:
getting your horse ready to show, getting to the
show on time, and performing well after you get
there. This kind of stress may not be what you’re
hoping to experience in your spare time! After
all, most people have enough pressure in their
jobs without inviting it into their weekends, too.
Showing costs money — sometimes a lot of
money. If you want to achieve a modicum of
success in the show ring, you need an above-
average horse, show tack, special apparel, and
a way to get your horse to the show grounds.
You can opt not to deal with the down side of
showing and still have a good time with your
horse. In fact, many people who don’t show claim
that they share a greater bond with their horses
than show riders do with their horses. Without
the pressures of showing, horse-and-rider teams
often form more uncomplicated attachments.

Some of the other breeds that feature heritage classes at their shows include
Andalusian (Spanish tack and apparel); Morgan (early American tack and
clothing); Paso Fino (South American or other Hispanic tack and costume);
and Pony of the Americas (Native American tack and regalia).
In heritage classes, the emphasis is on the authenticity and attractiveness of
the tack and dress. People usually make their own apparel and horse clothing
for these classes, because no stores sell ready-made heritage class garb
(although some specialty catalogs can provide many of the bangles and fab-
rics you need).
Enjoying the Great Outdoors 
at Trail Competitions
Not all equine competitions happen in a show ring. In olden days, most
horseback riding took place out in the wilderness, on trails that had been
forged by mounted travelers or by migrating game. Riding on these trails was
both exciting and challenging, and only the toughest horses and riders sur-
vived the harshest journeys.
Decades later, horse people who appreciate this legacy developed several
events that celebrate trail riding while also adding a competitive factor:
endurance riding, Ride and Tie, and competitive trail riding. This section
looks at these sports, which do not require any formal apparel or specific
tack.
Endurance riding
The sport of endurance riding has grown in popularity during the past 20
years. The sport’s most noteworthy event, the Tevis Cup, takes place annu-
ally in Northern California and receives international coverage. Hundreds of
smaller, local events are conducted around North America every year.
The object of endurance riding is to cover a given number of miles on horse-
back in the shortest amount of time. Endurance competitions often consist of
50- to 100-mile-per-day rides, or multiday rides that usually cover 50 miles
per day over a period of from four to six days. The horse-and-rider team that
gets to the finish line first is the winner. (Mandatory veterinary checks are
given throughout the competition, and only horses that are considered physi-
cally fit are allowed to finish the event.)
319
Chapter 18: Competing on Horseback

Endurance riding calls for a horse-and-rider team that is extremely fit and
athletic. A team must undergo serious training in the form of conditioning
over a period of months before it can compete in an endurance ride. This rig-
orous type of riding calls for a horse that is extremely well conditioned and
comfortable on the trail. Riders must be fit, too. Imagine sitting in the saddle
for 100 miles with only a few short breaks in between. Achieving that kind of
muscle strength and stamina takes considerable work.
All lighter-weight horse breeds can participate in endurance competition,
although Arabians dominate the sport because of their great capacity to
travel long distances. Horses in endurance rides are dressed in any type of
tack that the rider prefers, although most use specially made endurance sad-
dles and halter/bridle combinations (see Chapter 6 for details on riding
equipment).
Ride and Tie events
Ride and Tie events are an exciting sport that requires two humans and a
horse to make up a team. An endurance race of sorts (see the previous sec-
tion), Ride and Tie competition requires one person to be on horseback while
the other is on foot. The human team members take turns riding and running
across courses of 20- to 40-miles in length. Vet checks are conducted periodi-
cally to ensure the horse’s safety.
In Ride and Tie, human team members must alternate riding and running, but
the amount of time that one team member can spend riding is almost unlim-
ited. As long as both riders spend a given amount of time on horseback, they
can break up the running and riding however they prefer.
In Ride and Tie, the winning team is the one that finishes first with a sound
horse. This sport requires considerable conditioning by horse and human.
Competitive trail riding
Another sport that takes place on the trail is an event called competitive 
trail riding. Competitive trail riding is for riders who enjoy conditioning their
horses for trail riding and want to hone those skills to a fine art. Competitive
trail events consist of approximately 25- to 50-mile-per-day rides through vari-
ous terrains. Unlike endurance riding, competitive trail events are not races.
Instead of using time as a determining factor, judges evaluate horses primar-
ily on their physical condition, but their obedience to the rider along the trail
also is a determining factor in many events. Speed is not important, as long
as the horse and rider complete the ride within the minimum and maximum
time limits. A veterinarian and a lay judge periodically examine the horses
throughout the ride to determine their fitness as the day progresses.
320
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Just about any breed can participate in competitive trail riding. The rider
determines the type of tack he or she uses, but most riders use endurance
saddles and halter/bridle combinations.
Getting a Leg Up on Jumping
Competitions
Jumping on horseback is one of the most exciting ways to compete with your
equine companion. A few events call for jumping, which requires consider-
able skill and training on the part of both the horse and the rider.
Cross-country jumping
The practice of jumping on horseback started centuries ago when horses
were the only form of transportation, and tree-strewn trails were the only
avenues of travel. Cross-country jumping most resembles the type of jumping
riders practiced before automobiles and paved roadways became a part of
everyday human existence.
In cross-country jumping, horse-and-rider teams are expected to travel over a
given distance and negotiate a series of jump obstacles in a specified amount
of time. The obstacles on cross-country courses can be daunting: Trenches
filled with water, huge wooden fences, and combinations of the two are only
some of the obstacles placed in the horse’s way. The animal is expected to
jump over whatever he encounters without the least bit of hesitation.
Just about any breed of horse can compete in cross-country jumping, as long
as the animal is athletic and possesses considerable jumping ability. No
formal rider apparel is required for this sport.
Cross-country competitions can be staged on their own or in conjunction
with combined training events, because cross-country actually is the second
phase of combined training (covered later in this chapter).
Show jumping
Show jumping is an Olympic discipline for daredevils. Horse and rider have
to be courageous to excel in this sport, because show jumping demands that
horse and rider teams negotiate some pretty high fences.
In show jumping, horse-and-rider teams are expected to jump a series of
fences — ranging anywhere from 3 feet 6 inches in the novice classes to 6 feet
321
Chapter 18: Competing on Horseback

or more in more advanced classes — as fast as they possibly can. In show-
jumping competition, the horse-and-rider team that can jump the highest
fences with the fewest errors (knocking down a rail or refusing a jump) in the
fastest time is the winner. (In the event of ties, horse-and-rider teams partici-
pate in exciting “jump-offs,” which require negotiating a smaller, much harder
course in the fastest time.)
Horses shown in show jumping are outfitted with close contact jumping sad-
dles (a version of the hunt-seat saddle). Riders wear hunt caps, hunt jackets,
breeches, and high boots. The color and styles of apparel in this class are not
important and tend to vary from rider to rider.
Show jumping is an Olympic sport, and at the top levels, warmblood breeds
(see Chapter 3 for more information about warmbloods) often compete with
great success in this event. At smaller local or regional shows, you may see
other breeds in show jumping, too. Basically, any horse that is athletic
enough to take the jumps can compete in this sport, regardless of breed. 
As a rider, you must also be athletic and pretty darn fearless.
Checking Out Combined Training
Combined training, one of the Olympic disciplines, also is known as eventing
and three-day eventing. By any name, this activity is a challenging marathon
that requires horses and riders to display a variety of skills. Many in the
horse world consider this exercise to be the most difficult of all equine
sports.
Combined training events consist of three days of competition.
 On the first day, horse and rider perform a dressage test.
 On the second day, horse and rider negotiate a cross-country jumping
course that consists of a series of obstacles laid out over a set distance
through the countryside.
 On the third day, the team confronts a show-jumping course.
Because each of these days of competition exacts a toll on the horse-and-
rider team’s skills and energy level, combined training requires considerable
stamina and versatility from horse and rider. (We cover all these individual
events earlier in this chapter.)
To compete successfully in combined training, rider and horse must be well
trained, well conditioned, and eager to compete. A variety of good jumping
breeds, like the Thoroughbred and warmblood breeds, are most often seen in
combined training events.
322
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

The type of clothing that riders wear depends on the phase. The dressage
and show jumping phases call for dress typical for these sports, although the
cross-country phase allows riders to utilize tack and apparel that suits the
individual team. (Safety helmets always are worn in the cross-country and
show jumping portions of this sport.)
Steering Yourself Toward 
Competitive Driving
For equestrians who prefer to be behind the horse instead of on top of him,
driving is an attractive sport. Older riders and physically challenged equestri-
ans are especially drawn to competitive driving because it requires less ath-
leticism than the riding disciplines.
Driving competitions call for one or more horses to pull a two- or four-wheel
rig. Most driving competitions in the United States call for one or two horses
to a rig, but draft breeds often show in six- to eight-horse hitches (see
Chapter 3 for information on draft breeds).
Many breed clubs encourage driving, and usually offer driving classes in their
shows. The Morgan, American Saddlebred, Miniature Horse, and Arabian are
some of the light breeds that can be shown in breed-specific driving classes,
while all the draft breeds are routinely shown with heavy hitches.
The judging of driving, or harness, classes occurs in a variety of ways,
depending on the type of rig and breed of horse. Arena classes usually are
made up of flashy, animated horses. This type of driving generally features
gaited horses because of their high-stepping movements.
Driving marathons, which are the harness equivalents of cross-country jump-
ing without the jumping (see “Cross-country jumping” earlier in this chapter)
demand that horse teams pull rigs through a countryside course dotted with
obstacles they must negotiate. Driving marathon teams must be extremely
well conditioned.
Combined driving — another driving event — is an Olympic discipline that
consists of three phases much like the combined training sport (see
“Checking Out Combined Training” earlier in this chapter). In combined dri-
ving, a team of two to four driven horses performs the following:
 Presentation and arena dressage on the first day, which consists of walk-
ing and trotting patterns
 Marathon driving on the second day, which consists of traversing a six-
mile course
 Negotiating an arena obstacle course on the final day, which consists of
cones set up in various patterns
323
Chapter 18: Competing on Horseback

To compete in driving classes, horses must be specially trained to pull a rig.
If you are serious about showing in this discipline, you must invest a good
amount of money in a quality harness and rig in which to present your horse.

T
he greatest thing about horses is how much you can do with them. The
horse world is filled with all kinds of activities for those who ride — and
even for those who don’t like to climb on board but just enjoy being around
horses.
In this chapter, we introduce you to several of the most popular and enjoy-
able noncompetitive equine activities. These activities are meant to let you
spend time in your horse’s company and have plenty of fun doing it. (For
details on competitive activities, see Chapter 18.)
Riding the Trails
The number-one activity among horse owners throughout North America 
is trail riding, a hobby that takes both horse and rider into the wide-open
spaces simply for the sheer joy of it. Whether you live in the urban wilds of
New York City or the untamed wilderness of the Pacific Northwestern forests,
trail riding is something you and your horse can enjoy together.
What trail riding is
Trail riding is a very old activity. Before the days of automobiles, riding a
horse on the trail was usually the only way to get from point A to point B.
Today, people trail ride just for the fun of it. Few activities are as relaxing and
therapeutic as riding a horse out in the open. Horses have a way of helping
humans feel connected to nature, and never is this truer than when you are
riding on a shady, wooded trail or through a sweet-smelling meadow.

You can trail ride locally on your own or with a friend, or trailer your horse
out to trail ride. You can also participate in group trail rides, which are orga-
nized events usually sponsored by a riding club.
How you ride on trails
Trail riding is a pretty simple activity. You just locate a trail, saddle up your
horse, mount up, and start riding. Trail rides can be as short as an hour or as
long as an entire day. Some trail rides even stretch out over a week or more.
You just have to decide how much trail riding you want to do.
Short rides don’t call for much preparation. Your tacked-up horse and an idea
of where you are going is all you require. Assuming that trails are available in
close proximity to where you keep your horse, you can probably ride to the
trail head (the place where the trail starts). Otherwise, you need to trailer
your horse to get there.
Don’t forget your horse’s comfort on the trail. Unless you’re riding in extreme
cold or desert heat, horse-eating insects are a problem in the wide-open
spaces. Spray your horse with equine insect repellent before you go on your
ride. If gnats are a problem in your area, you may even want to invest in a
simple knitted or mesh bonnet that protects your horse’s ears from these
biting insects (available from tack stores and catalogs).
If you plan to take longer rides, be sure that you and your horse are properly
conditioned. The worst thing to do to a horse is let him stand in his stall all
week and then get on him on a Saturday and ride him for four hours on the
trail. He’ll be sore and miserable the next day, and will be less than enthused
the next time you come to take him out. Instead, starting at least one month
ahead of time, gradually increase the time you spend riding by about 15 min-
utes each ride until you’re doing at least two-thirds of the time and distance
you plan to do on a long ride.
On longer trail rides, make sure your horse will have access to water (partic-
ularly important if the weather is hot) and that you know where you’re going
in advance. Of course, you can always just go exploring, but make sure that
you have an idea of how to get back to where you started. Contrary to myth,
horses don’t always know the way back home, especially if you’re on a trail
the horse has never seen before. If you are going alone, be sure to tell some-
one where you’re going and when you’ll return, just as you would if you went
hiking by yourself.
What you need
One of the nicest things about trail riding is you don’t need a bunch of fancy
stuff to do it. Here are the basic trail riding requirements:
326
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

 A horse: The most obvious thing you need to trail ride is a horse. You
don’t have to have a fancy animal that costs as much as a Mercedes. All
you need is a quiet, obedient mount that is comfortable being ridden out
on the trail. If you plan to go on long rides, your mount must also be
exceptionally physically fit.
 Tack: You can’t ride your horse on the trail without a saddle and bridle.
You can use any kind of saddle for trail riding, although western saddles
and endurance saddles are the most comfortable for longer rides and
the tack of choice for those who do nothing but trail ride. The kind of
bridle you use depends on what discipline you typically ride. Many trail
riders use combination bridle/halters with attached lead ropes so they
can safely tie their horses up during breaks on the trail. (See Chapter 6
for details on tack.)
Make sure that whatever kind of tack you use is in good repair before
you head out on a trail ride.
 Clothes: A park ranger will arrest you if you try to trail ride in your
skivvies, so clothes are a must. You’ll need comfortable riding clothes if
you plan to enjoy yourself. If you’re riding in hot weather, wear a cool
shirt that protects you from the sun but lets your skin breathe at the
same time. In cold weather, wear layers of clothing to stay warm. Wear
appropriate riding pants and high boots, paddock boots, or riding shoes
for safety. And don’t forget your helmet. Taking a spill while riding on the
trail is a constant concern, so protection for your head is a must.
Helmets also come in handy when you ride underneath low-lying
branches. (Check out Chapter 6 for more about riding clothes.)
 Accessories: All kinds of fun accessories are available to trail riders. The
basic ones you need for longer rides are a saddlebag, a water bottle and
holder, a hoof pick, and a small first-aid kit (see Chapter 11 for informa-
tion on what a first-aid kit should contain). Your saddlebag can hold the
hoof pick, the first-aid kit, your lunch, insect repellent, lip balm, a com-
pass (if you know how to read one), and whatever other items you want
to bring with you. The hoof pick is to remove any rocks that lodge in
your horse’s hooves. The water bottle and holder are for your hydrating
needs, and the first-aid kit is to deal with any minor injuries (yours or
your horse’s) that occur on the trail.
If you own a cell phone, consider bringing it with you on trail rides. In an
emergency situation on the trail, a cell phone can be a lifesaver.
 A buddy or two: Riding alone on the trail can be relaxing and enjoyable,
but going with a friend is always best, especially when you’re first start-
ing out as a trail rider. If an emergency arises — such as your horse
becoming seriously injured or you falling and becoming immobile —
having another person with you can make a big difference in the even-
tual outcome.
Companionship is another reason to ride with a buddy. Trailing riding is
a great way for horsy friends to enjoy each other’s company.
327
Chapter 19: Riding for the Fun of It

Strutting Your Stuff in Parades
If you’ve always wanted to participate in a parade but you couldn’t walk and
play the sousaphone at the same time, then a horse may be just the answer.
Maybe you can ride and play the sousaphone, instead! Then again, maybe not,
but have you ever seen a parade without horses in it? Probably not. Horses
and parades go hand in hand. And as an equestrian, you automatically qualify
to move from parade watcher to parade participant.
Riding in a parade can be tremendous fun. You and your horse are in the
spotlight (along with your mounted comrades), and all you have to do is look
good and wave.
What a parade equestrian unit is
The equestrian units that you see in big parades are part of organized riding
groups. The riders may be members of a youth riding club, representatives of
a breed organization, or part of a horseback drill-team group (see “Joining a
Drill Team” later in this chapter for details on this type of group). The group’s
theme in the parade usually represents whatever the riding club is all about.
For example, if the club is a military-style riding group for youngsters, the
kids wear their uniforms and most likely carry flags. If the riders represent a
local palomino horse club, all the horses are palominos tacked up in their
finest garb.
How you participate in a parade
To become a participant in a big parade, you must be a member of an orga-
nized riding group, unless, of course, you are a celebrity or can justify partici-
pating on your individual merits. (If you have to think about whether you’re 
a celebrity, chances are good that you’re not.) In many smaller towns and
cities, however, the parades are small and informal enough that individual
riders can also sign up.
If riding in big parades is for you, your first step is to join a local riding group.
Of all the different kinds of riding groups, pick the one that best suits your
age group and riding interests. Your parks and recreation department should
be able to provide you with some names and numbers of riding groups in
your area.
If you’re joining an organized group primarily to ride in parades, make sure
that parades are a regular part of the group’s activities before you sign up.
328
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Parade rides usually start early in the morning and last for several hours. The
equestrian entries tend to be spaced apart in between other parade partici-
pants, and all participants start the parade route at a specific time. The eques-
trian entries are expected to ride through the entire parade route to the end
with no breaks. You’re on stage, after all, and parades don’t have intermissions!
What you need
The basics of what you need to ride in a parade vary, depending on your
riding group. However, some basics are the same for all parade riders:
 A good parade horse: Parade riding is a blast for humans, but for some
horses it can be nothing more than a series of nerve-wracking horrors.
Marching bands, weird-looking floats, cheering crowds — all these
things can drive certain horses to distraction. To have a good time
riding in a parade, you need a horse that has a quiet personality and
some experience with crowds and loud noises. Your riding group can
help you mentally condition your horse for parades, but you need to
start with an animal that is relatively calm to begin with.
If you want to ride in parades, you also need a horse that loads into a
horse trailer easily. The I’m-not-going-in-that-trailer attitude just won’t
cut it on the morning you’re rushing to get to the parade grounds on
time.
You don’t have to own a horse trailer to participate in parades. Other
people in your riding club will own trailers, and your horse usually can
double up with one of theirs when you need to take them to the parade
grounds.
 Nice tack: If you want to ride in parades on a regular basis, you probably
need to invest in a nice show saddle, complete with silver trimmings.
Most — but not all — equestrians in parades ride in western show sad-
dles. Check with your riding group to find out what type of tack your
fellow members use for parades.
 Fancy clothes: Again, what you wear depends on whom you are riding
with. If your group has a western theme, then some attractive western
show clothes are in order. If you belong to a breed club, the group may
prefer to dress in clothing that emphasizes the breed’s heritage. And
guess what you wear if your riding club is a military unit? If you said 
anything other than your uniform, drop and give us 50!
Joining a Drill Team
If your favorite part of Hollywood westerns is when the cavalry charges the
enemy, then drill-team riding may be for you. Drilling on horseback is tons of
329
Chapter 19: Riding for the Fun of It

fun and gives riders an opportunity to meet and socialize with others who
enjoy the same activity.
What drilling is
Drilling on horseback is an old activity, one that goes back all the way to the
Roman legions and possibly before. In the old days, when horses were the
primary vehicles of war, drilling was used to train mounted soldiers to follow
commands with precision and obedience.
Today, drill-team work is done mostly for fun. Riders who enjoy drilling get
together and form clubs that practice at least once a week and sometimes
more. They perform their precision drill work in parades, at county fairs, and
during horse shows. Some local horsemen’s associations have their own drill
teams or can refer you to one in your area.
How you drill
Most drill teams consist of ten to twelve horse-and-rider duos, sometimes
more. A drill caller gives drill commands that horse-and-rider teams follow.
Each command requires a specific movement; when several horse-and-rider
teams perform these moves in conjunction, the group ends up moving as a
unit.
Because of its military foundation, drill-team work calls for discipline on the
part of the riders and obedience on the part of their horses. You need to
memorize each maneuver and have your horse execute it at the moment you
hear the command. You rehearse exhibition drills, and after a few practices
with your group, you know exactly what is coming from the drill caller. The
drills you perform at exhibitions and horse shows are the same drills that
you and your team have performed at home many times over.
What you need
One of the perks of drill-team work is that you don’t need to invest a whole
lot of money to participate in the activity. The following is all you need:
 A cooperative horse: Just about any horse can do drill-team work, as
long as the animal is obedient and well mannered. Some horses really
enjoy drill-team work and look forward to it (you can tell by their happy,
relaxed attitude when they’re working — see Chapter 2 for tips on read-
ing equine body language). They like the excitement of working right
next to other horses and the quick movements and sharp turns that
drill-team work requires.
330
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

Horses that don’t like being in close proximity with other horses don’t
do well at drill-team work and can even pose a danger to others if they
have a tendency to kick or bite other equine participants.
 Good tack: You don’t need fancy tack to ride in a drill team unless the
riding group you belong to demands it. At least for practice, anyway, 
you can simply ride in a comfortable, well-fitted western saddle. (Some
groups use English saddles or the old-style military McClellan saddles 
to more closely replicate the tack used by the cavalry.)
 An outfit: Drill teams usually are color-coordinated, so your group prob-
ably will tell you what you need to wear when the drill team is perform-
ing for the public. You’ll definitely need some kind of hat (most likely a
western one), plus a shirt and pants in specific colors or even designs.
This outfit is unlikely to cost you much money. You may even be able to
pull it together from stuff you already have in your wardrobe.
Reliving the Past in Reenactments
Like to watch period films, particularly those set in Civil War times or during
the Indian Wars? Then you’ve no doubt seen reenactors in action. Although
the vast budgets of today’s motion pictures may lead you to believe all those
soldiers and cowboys you see on the silver screen are actors, in reality,
they’re usually mounted reenactors, or riders who dress up in period garb
and ride their horses in mock battles on a regular basis — whether cameras
are present or not.
What a reenactment is
Reenacting famous battles has been the hobby of thousands of horsemen for
decades. For that matter, non-horsemen play the part of foot soldiers in mock
warfare. Reenactors live in all parts of the country and recreate battles from a
variety of different wars and periods. Civil War reenactments are the most well-
known, although reenactments of Indian and U.S. cavalry fights, Revolutionary
and British battles, and scuffles from the Mexican-American War are among the
many other events that are commemorated year-round in the United States by
people who seem possessed by the spirits of those who have preceded them
throughout history.
How you reenact
Getting involved with reenacting first means joining one of the many reenact-
ment groups. They aren’t hard to find if you have access to the Internet.
Entering “reenactment” and “horse” and the name of your state in any of the
popular search engines should give you a list of groups near you.
331
Chapter 19: Riding for the Fun of It

After you find out about reenactment groups in your area, contact one or
more of them and tell them that you’re new to this activity and would like to
find out how their particular group works. After you get to know the group
and what it does, you can decide what type of person from the past you want
to portray. If the Civil War intrigues you, you’ll need to decide if you want to
be on the Union side or the Confederate side. If you like the idea of reenacting
U.S. Cavalry battles, you’ll have to decide which part you’d like to play in
these events.
After joining a group, you’ll discover all about how reenactments work and
how you can incorporate your horse into them.
What you need
You need a love of history and a burning desire to relive the past to be a reen-
actor. You also need a sense of adventure and a bit of courage, because some
of the battles that take place during reenactments can really get the adrena-
line flowing.
The type of equipment and apparel you need depends on the reenactment
group you join. Here are the basics:
 The right horse. You’ll need a horse that looks the part. If you want to
represent a U.S. cavalry soldier, you need to have a horse that is bay,
chestnut, or black. The U.S. Cavalry did not use Appaloosas and Paints,
so those breeds won’t fit in with the group. If, however, you want to help
reenact shootouts between outlaws and sheriffs, the color of your horse
won’t be that important.
Your horse needs to be calm and steady because reenactments often
involve the sound of gunshots, galloping out in the open, and even bat-
tling on horseback. Special training will likely be needed so your horse
can participate.
 The right equipment. Your horse also needs tack that is appropriate to
his position within the reenactment. If he’s a cavalry horse, he needs a
regulation cavalry saddle and bridle. You’ll also need the appropriate
gear for yourself, such as a sword, rifle, and any other accoutrements
carried by cavalry soldiers. The reenactment group that you join will
help educate you about the kind of tack you need.
 The right apparel. Clothing is an important part of reenacting, and
you’ll be expected to purchase a uniform or other apparel to look the
part. The reenactment group that you join will help educate you about
the kind of apparel you need.

Having a Horsy Vacation
Can’t get enough of your equine companion? Want to take that horse with
you next time you go on vacation? Don’t laugh — many people do just that,
and have a great time, too! The practice of taking a horse along on vacation 
is becoming more and more popular every year. People are discovering that
having their horse along on a trip — when they can do more than weekend
riding — is just plain fun.
If your usual vacation spot is a beach in the Bahamas, you’ll need to alter
your plans a bit to accommodate your horse, but not by much. The number
of neat places you can go with your horse in tow is amazing.
You can take your horse on vacation with you in one of two ways:
 You can go camping with your horse in specially designated horse-
camping campgrounds or in the backcountry (where the paved roads
don’t go).
 You can trailer your critter to a horseback vacation resort that allows
you to bring your own horse.
Even if you can’t bring your own horse with you, you can still enjoy a great
horsy vacation. Check out all your options in the following sections.
Camping out with your horse
If you love regular camping, then you will really love horse camping. Few
things are as wonderful as waking up on a dewy morning in your tent and
hearing your horse munching his hay just outside.
Horse camping is not a new activity. Before the days of cars, plenty of people
on long journeys were forced to horse camp! Today, horse camping is a recre-
ational activity and quite enjoyable at that.
What horse camping is
Horse camping is, simply, camping with horses. It has all the same elements
as regular camping, except that your horse comes with you and you get to
ride him on your camping trip. Horse camping can be done the same way as
car camping, where you drive up to your campsite, or the same way as back-
packing, where you hike — or in this case ride — to your campsite.
Many people go horse camping in tents, with their horses tied or corralled
nearby. Others bring RVs along so they can have a bit of luxury in the great
outdoors. Many people think that the best horse camping comes when you
sleep in a tent, though. When you tent camp, you stand a better chance of
333
Chapter 19: Riding for the Fun of It

hearing your horse moving around through the night. Not only are you able
to keep watch on your horse, but you also get neat, regular reminders that
he’s out there. Sure, if you’re a light sleeper, you won’t get a really good
night’s rest this way, but we think that knowing your horse is okay is better
than sleeping like a rock. Save that for when you get home!
The biggest reason people take their horses camping is so they can go trail
riding with them. Although most campers hike on camping trips, horse
campers ride. Coming out of your tent in the morning, feeding the horses,
cooking up your breakfast, and then heading out on the trail is a great feeling.
How you camp out
Camping with horses is a little more complicated than camping without them.
You need to trailer the horse to the campsite and then secure the horse so he
doesn’t wander off in the middle of the night.
Horse campers use a few different ways to keep their horses close to camp:
 Campground corrals: Campgrounds that are specially designated for
horses often have permanent corrals made of pipe or other strong mate-
rial. These corrals usually are secure, and they’re your best bet when
horse camping. When your horse is in a permanent corral, you tend to
rest a little easier. You rarely see campground corrals in the backcoun-
try, so keep that in mind if the security of a corral is important to you.
 Portable corrals: A number of different portable corrals are on the
market. They’re designed to keep camped-out horses from leaving the
campsite of their own accord. These portable corrals fold up; you can
store them in a truck or horse trailer — or even in a horse pack (a back-
pack that goes on a horse whose job is to carry only equipment) — and
then put them together when you set up camp. Some of them come with
electricity so the horse gets a mild shock if he tries to bust out.
The benefits of portable corrals are that they allow the horse freedom to
move about and lie down. The problem, however, is that they serve
mostly as a mental barrier rather than a physical one. If a horse really
wants to get out of a portable corral, he will — and that includes the
electric ones.
 Tie-outs: Many horse campers opt to tie their horses to a tie-out, or
picket line, strung between two trees or staked to the ground. For a
horse to be safely tied out or staked out, the animal must be used to this
kind of restraint. Otherwise, the horse may get himself tangled up, panic,
and incur serious injuries. (See Chapter 13 for details on tying a horse
properly.)
The benefit of tying out a horse when camping is that it gives you the
freedom to camp wherever you like, knowing your horse is secure. The
downside is that the horse is at risk for getting tangled in the line.
334
Part IV: Handling Your Horse with Ease 

 Trailer tying: Some horse campers tie their horses to the rings on the
side of a horse trailer with a lead rope. This method is good for keeping
the horses nearby and under close watch, but the problem is that the
horse can’t lie down, something he needs to do to get valuable REM
sleep (see Chapter 20 for information on how horses sleep).
What you need
To really enjoy your horse-camping expedition, you need the following:
 A plan: Embark on your camping trip with a solid idea of where you’re
going and how to get there. Make reservations for your campsite, if pos-
sible, and be sure to choose a campground that has drinkable water,
which is available to your horse at all times. Horses need plenty of fresh
water to stay healthy, especially in hot weather.
 An experienced horse: Horses that never leave the stable are not good
candidates for horse camping. A horse needs to be used to traveling and
riding on unfamiliar trails before you take him on an overnight trip. Your
horse also needs to be relatively calm. Horses that frighten at the drop
of a hat can be a hazard on a camping trip. The horse must load easily
into a trailer, too, unless you want to begin and end your camping trip
with a battle!
 A horse trailer: Unless you plan to ride from the stable to the camp-
ground, you need a horse trailer to pull your steed behind you. Make
sure that your trailer is in good shape before you head out on a camping
trip (see Chapter 18).
 Camping experience: Don’t make your horse-camping experience your
very first camping experience. Successful camping — especially tent
camping — takes some practice. Learn how to do it on your own before
adding your horse to the mix.
 Camping buddies: Plan your horse-camping trip to include a friend or
two. Camping with friends is not only safer, but it’s much more fun, too!
 Camping gear for humans and horses: Don’t throw all your gear
together at the last minute. Make a list a week before your trip so you
won’t forget to bring something important.
Besides your usual camping equipment, your horse needs you to bring
some stuff for him too: a halter and lead rope, saddle, bridle, saddle pad,
grooming tools, a first-aid kit for the road, a water bucket, a supply of
your horse’s usual food, and insect repellent.
Towing your horse to a resort
Horse resorts are resorts with facilities and activities that are horse friendly.
They usually are located in wilderness areas and feature homey, country-
style themes. Many offer organized trail rides, riding lessons, and other horse
335
Chapter 19: Riding for the Fun of It

activities. Many also offer a number of wonderful luxuries for non-horsy
human guests.
Before you pick a horse resort for your vacation, do some research. First,
figure out how far you want to drive to get there (remember, your horse will
be in tow!). Then, start scoping out the horse resorts within that driving dis-
tance. The Internet is a great resource for this research. By putting “horse”
and “vacation” plus the state of your destination in a search engine, you’ll get
a list of horse resorts to choose from.
You can consider shipping your horse ahead of you by using a horse trans-
portation company, and then flying to the resort yourself. This option will
cost you a bit of dough, though, so be prepared.
Before you make reservations at any horse resort, ask these questions.
 Can I bring my horse?
 What health certificates are required?
 Can you send me written information on the facility, including rates?
 Can you provide me with some guest references?
 Do you have what I want in a vacation?
Taking a trip without your own horse
If you can’t take your horse with you, or would rather not go through the
hassle of transporting your equine buddy, you can still have a horsy vacation.
In fact, if you want to combine horses with your holiday, you have a plethora
of options to choose from. Just put “horse” and “vacation” in any Internet
search engine, and you’ll see what we mean.
Horseback vacations come in many different styles. Some take place at
resorts, where riding is one of several activities in which you and your family
can participate. Others are intensive adventures where you ride for days on
end while you see the countryside.
Spending time on a horseback vacation is a great way to learn to ride, pro-
vided you choose the right kind of vacation. A weeklong, training-intensive
vacation can provide an incredible opportunity to learn while you get away
from it all. If your riding skills don’t need honing, and you just want to enjoy
some new scenery on horseback, you can go to a dude ranch or other riding
vacation facility where daily trail rides are the main activity.
Whatever horseback vacation you choose, be sure to research it first. Ask
plenty questions and get referrals from other guests to make sure the vaca-
tion is everything that it’s hyped up to be. Then pack your boots and your
helmet and go have some fun!

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens is a hodgepodge of fun information
regarding horses. In these chapters, we tackle some of
the most common myths about the equine species. We
also present you with a list of some of the best horse
movies ever made.

Chapter 20
Ten Horse Myths
In This Chapter
 Discovering how horses think
 Getting the scoop on matters of equine health
 Finding out how horses meet their end
G
iven how long horses have been a part of human culture, the fact that
oodles of equine misinformation abound isn’t surprising. Although the
horse may not be as maligned as Sasquatch, the poor equine has suffered his
share of urban myths. As horse lovers, we’re here to set the record straight
regarding horses, their behavior, and various other stuff about them.
Horses Are Dumb
Horses are not the only nonhuman animals to suffer under this assumption.
In fact, dogs seem to be the only species that isn’t regularly thought of by
humans as lacking in brainpower.
The myth that horses are stupid is a result of human misunderstanding of
equine behavior. Humans tend to judge other animals by themselves, or at
the very least, by man’s best friend, the dog. After watching and interacting
with horses for a short time, you realize that these animals are smart — often
smarter than we would like them to be.
Horses are neither predators like dogs nor cognitive thinkers like humans.
They are a prey species that has been designed by nature to function in a com-
pletely different way. The main purpose of nearly all of equine behavior is to
survive in a potentially hostile environment. So, although horses may not be
capable of sniffing out bombs like beagles or understanding the exact meaning
of human language, their behaviors all add up to brilliance at the job of sur-
vival. See Chapter 2 for more information about equine instincts and behavior.

Horses Will Run Toward a Fire
We’re not sure where this myth came from because we’ve never heard of a
horse that ran toward a fire instead of away from it. Maybe somewhere, at
some time, a horse or two did run back into a burning barn in a panic. Going
back to the barn could make sense from the horse’s perspective in certain
circumstances, because horses that have lived their entire lives in box stalls
(an unnatural way to keep a horse, by the way) associate those stalls with
safety. The instinct to return to a place of safety during a frightening moment
dominates a horse’s thinking. A horse doesn’t have the reasoning power to
understand that the barn is no longer safe because fire will soon consume it.
Horses Don’t Sleep Lying Down
Because they’re prey animals and need to make a quick getaway in times of
emergency, horses have an amazing ability to doze on their feet. However,
contrary to myth, they do lie down for heavy-duty shut-eye. For a horse to get
the few hours of valuable REM sleep each day that is necessary for good
health, he must either lie flat on his side or in a recumbent position with his
nose resting on the ground.
Horses Hate People
If you’ve ever ridden a horse that has treated you unkindly, you’re probably
surprised to see meanness listed in this book as a myth. Unfortunately, a
great many people have had unpleasant first-time experiences with horses.
Then again, most people have their first riding experiences at poorly run,
rent-by-the-hour stables (something we vehemently recommend against in
this book). Not realizing that the horses at many of these establishments are
poorly trained and badly treated, these first-time riders get up on the animal
expecting to have a pleasant experience and end up traumatized because the
horse tries to rub them off on a tree, run away with them, or get down on his
knees and roll while they’re in the saddle.
Horses that behave this way are reflecting the unkind and callous way
they’ve been treated by the people responsible for their care and by no
means are the norm in the horse world. The great majority of horses are
gentle, friendly, and willing to do anything asked of them, provided they’re
extended kindness and respect in return.
Horses Are Aloof
Human beings have a tendency to judge all other animals by the dog. Most
dogs are happy, friendly, and demonstrative. When a dog likes you, you know
it. That wagging tail and kissy tongue are hard to miss.
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Horses, on the other hand, are different. Dogs are easy when it comes to love.
With a horse, you have to earn it. And after you do earn that love and trust
(and gaining such feeling from a horse is an honor and an accomplishment on
your part), it will be expressed to you in subtle ways: a head gently pressed
against your chest, a soft whinny, or a nuzzle with a velvet nose. Horses
aren’t aloof; they’re simply more discerning and more subtle in demonstrat-
ing affection than your average canine.
Horses Vocalize a Lot, Just Like 
in the Movies
Next time you see a western, play close attention. You’ll discover that the
horses in the movie whinny every time they appear on screen. You won’t see
their mouths move, or witness any logical reason for their vocalizations.
Instead, they’ll just gallop into scenes, accompanied by the sound. Sometimes
you’ll hear the whinny as the horse comes to a sudden stop; other times, as
the horse takes off at a mad gallop. Sometimes you’ll hear the whinny when
the horse is just standing there in the background, doing absolutely nothing.
In case you haven’t figured it out by now, the horses in movies are not actu-
ally whinnying. Their neighs are equine sound effects that have been added
by the filmmakers for effect. As you become more and more familiar with
equine behavior, this constant cinematic whinnying will start to drive you
crazy. You’ll come to realize that horses whinny for only certain reasons:
when they anticipate being fed; when they’re greeting a friend; or when
they’re engaged in courtship or parenthood. They don’t whinny when their
actor-rider needs to make a grand entrance; they don’t whinny when the
director wants to make sure that the audience knows they’re watching a
western; and they sure as heck don’t whinny with their mouths closed!
Horses Are Always Healthy
Horses, as a species, are plagued with all kinds of health problems, many of
which have been exacerbated by domestication. The average horse needs to
be seen by a vet a couple of times a year for minor problems, but plenty of
horses come down with at least one major illness in their lifetimes. The term
“healthy as a horse” to indicate someone in good health must have been
coined by someone who never owned a horse! See Chapters 10 and 11 to find
out more about equine health problems and how to prevent them.
They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?
Well, they used to. A gunshot wound to the head at one time was the tradi-
tional method of putting a horse out of its misery. In some very rural places,
341
Chapter 20: Ten Horse Myths

shooting still is the method of choice for destroying a horse. But for the most
part, an injection administered by a veterinarian is the most widely used —
and most humane — form of euthanasia for suffering equines these days. See
Chapter 11 for more about equine euthanasia.
Old Horses Go Off to the Glue Factory
This myth is a hundred years old or more, yet it still persists. In the old days,
horses too old to work were sent to the glue factory for slaughter so their
parts could be used to make glue. Today, natural glue is made mostly from
the skin, bones, and hooves of cattle, which are by-products of the food-
animal industry.
Instead of going to the glue factory, unwanted horses these days are sent off
to slaughter, where their meat is used mostly for human consumption in parts
of Europe and Japan. Unlike the days of the glue factory, when only old horses
were used for their parts, today’s slaughterhouses receive horses of any age
and condition. See Chapter 12 for more information about equine slaughter.
A Broken Leg Equals a Death Sentence
for a Horse
As recently as 25 years ago, this statement would have been true. Today,
however, advancements in veterinary medicine have created a world where a
fractured leg no longer means a death sentence.
Horses used to be destroyed when they broke a leg because mending a frac-
tured leg was notoriously difficult. The fact that equine legs are too big for
casting and the unavailability of general anesthesia, sterile conditions, equip-
ment large enough to handle a horse, and surgeons capable of performing the
delicate surgery made the procedure fail most of the time. Attempts to fix
broken bones often resulted in infection in the affected leg or severe founder
in the opposite hoof, a result of bearing all the weight of the horse while the
broken leg was healing.
Nowadays, through much work and determination in the veterinary profes-
sion, a good number of veterinarians are skilled enough to perform the neces-
sary surgery. Equipment and metal leg implants also large enough for a horse
needing care for a fracture are readily available.

Ten Great Movies about Horses
In This Chapter
 Capturing the magic of horses on the silver screen
 Recommending films for horse lovers
T
he combination of beauty, grace, and power in horses lends itself to the
silver screen. Flowing manes and tails, galloping hooves, and big, expres-
sive eyes make for great cinematography. This reality has not been lost on
filmmakers who have been making movies about horses since motion pic-
tures began.
You’ve no doubt seen many horses in the movies through the years. They’re
a staple in just about any adventure film that takes place before the turn of
the 20th century, providing transportation for cowboys, crusaders, and
ancient Greeks. In these films, horses provide a backdrop to lend credibility
to the story. After all, you can’t shoot a movie about an ancient battle without
having horses in the picture.
Although the majority of movies containing horses aren’t about the horses
themselves, some movies have focused primarily on equine characters. Not
merely vehicles on which to perch actors, the horses in these films are the
stars. The stories center on their speed, courage, and huge capacity for love,
and in the process, capture the essence of what horses are all about.
The film industry has produced scores of wonderful horse movies over the
years. Here are ten of the best, in our opinion.
Black Beauty
The classic book Black Beauty, written by Anna Sewell in the late 1800s, has
been made into films no less than six times since the first Black Beauty was
released in 1917. The most recent version of the story came out in 1994 and
is a great tribute to Sewell’s brilliant novel.

Told from the point of view of Black Beauty, a black stallion living in Victorian
England, the movie gives a sympathetic and realistic view of what it’s like to
be a horse. We watch as Beauty changes hands many times, never knowing
what his fate will be and finding himself at the mercy of sometimes kind,
sometimes cruel owners. The end of the film brings tears to even the most
stoic horse lover.
The Black Stallion
Based on the first book in The Black Stallion series by Walter Farley, The
Black Stallion the film, released in 1979, is a truly classic horse movie.
Beautifully shot, the story centers on a boy named Alec and a jet-black
Arabian stallion he calls The Black.
Alec and The Black find themselves shipwrecked on a desert island after the
ship they’re traveling on sinks in stormy seas. The two build a profound bond
as they await rescue and return to civilization, where The Black becomes a
racehorse like no other.
The Black Stallion Returns
Because of the huge commercial and critical success of The Black Stallion,
Farley’s second book in the series, The Black Stallion Returns, was made into
a film in 1983.
In this movie, Alec and The Black are reunited. When The Black’s original
owners from the Middle East come to America to retrieve him, Alec stows
away on a ship to Morocco to find his horse. The result is an adventure
through the picturesque Sahara and a desert race between Arabian horses
that is a definite must-see.
Hidalgo
If you love action, adventure, and horses, then you’ll appreciate the 2004 film
Hidalgo, starring Viggo Mortensen. It’s the tale of a pinto mustang stallion
named Hidalgo and his master, Frank, who travel to the Middle East to com-
pete in a grueling race. The story starts out in the American West and ends in
the sands of the Sahara.
Although billed as a true story by Disney, Hidalgo is actually a controversial
film among some in the horse industry. Taken from the journals of Frank
Hopkins, a horseman who lived in the 1800s, the events shown in the film
344
Part V: The Part of Tens 

cannot be corroborated, according to some researchers. Supporters of the
film say Hopkins’ journals are accurate, and a stallion named Hidalgo did
travel to the Middle East in the late 1800s to compete against hundreds of
Arabian horses in a 3,000-mile endurance race.
Regardless of whether you believe the story, Hidalgo is a great film for horse
lovers. It features exciting racing scenes and beautiful horses.
The Horse Whisperer
Actor and horseman Robert Redford turned the best-selling novel The Horse
Whisperer into a film in 1998. Starring Redford, Kristin Scott Thomas, and a
young Scarlett Johansson, the movie centers around a girl and her horse as
they struggle to recover from a horrific riding accident.
Horse people love The Horse Whisperer, in large part because of Redford’s
efforts in equine accuracy. Unlike many other films about horses, The Horse
Whisperer is right on in its portrayal of horse actions and behaviors.
The Man from Snowy River
It’s hard to find a horse person who hasn’t seen and loved the 1982 version of
The Man from Snowy River, an Australian film about a young boy named Jim
Craig who’s trying to save his family’s farm in the picturesque Outback. An
old rancher, played by Jack Thompson, takes the boy under his wing and
helps him become a skilled horseman.
The beautiful Australian scenery combined with some hair-raising chase scenes
with wild horses leave a lasting impression of this film on all who see it.
My Friend Flicka
A classic horse film from 1943 that’s loved by children the world over, My
Friend Flicka stars a young Roddy McDowell who falls in love with a renegade
filly named Flicka. Despite warnings from his horse breeder father to stay
away from the filly, because she is the daughter of a “crazy” mare, McDowell’s
character, Ken McLaughlin, believes in the foal’s spirit.
When Flicka becomes ill, Ken takes on the role of caretaker. His intense bond
with the young horse proves to be healing in many ways, particularly
between Ken and his hard-to-please father.

Chapter 21: Ten Great Movies about Horses

National Velvet
One of the most famous horse movies of all time is National Velvet. Released
in 1945 and starring Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney, National Velvet tells
the story of a girl named Velvet who defies the odds and tackles the daring
sport of steeplechasing on an amazing horse named Pie.
When Pie and Velvet enter the Grand National steeplechase, their skills at
hurtling terrifying obstacles while galloping at full speed are put the test. The
two prove to be a dynamic team that gives the male riders and their horses a
run for their money.
Run, Appaloosa, Run
This 1966 Disney film about a Nez Perce Indian girl named Mary Blackfeather
and her Appaloosa stallion, Holy Smoke, was filmed in the Pacific Northwest,
where the Appaloosa breed evolved. An actual event, the Oak Stampede
Suicide Race in Washington, is the focus of the film. Mary and Holy Smoke
enter the race in an attempt to help Mary’s tribe.
The footage of the Oak Stampede Suicide Race, a controversial event that has
since been condemned by humane societies around the United States, is the
highlight of the film. Horses and riders plunge 120 feet down a ravine and
charge through water in their attempts to be first across the finish line.
Seabiscuit
In the 1930s, when the United States was struggling with the Depression, a
hero rose up from the West and gave everyone hope. This champion was a
small chestnut stallion named Seabiscuit.
Based on the bestselling book by Laura Hillebrand, the movie Seabiscuit, star-
ring Jeff Bridges, was released in 2003 and did an amazing job of capturing
the mood of pre-World War II America. Although some of the horse details in
the movie are a bit inaccurate, the film still does a great job of illustrating
how the courage and heart of one horse can help raise the spirit of a nation.

lighten as they get older. One variety, called flea-bitten gray, is usually seen on older horses.

hite horses are solid white with pink
muzzles and light-colored hooves.
Don’t confuse white horses with gray
horses. Gray horses have some colored
hairs in their coats — whites do not. White
horses are sometimes seen with blue eyes
(these horses are also called cremellos) or
brown eyes.

Buckskin
T
he true buckskin has a yellow or gold body coloration with a black mane and tail. The lower legs are usually black
and can have white markings. Many horse lovers believe that a horse must have a dark stripe down the back to be
considered a buckskin, but in reality, true buckskins have no dorsal stripe.
Palominos have a golden yellow body coloration with white manes and tails.

D
un horses have a gold body color and a black or brown mane and tail. The most distinctive indication of a dun
coloration is a dark stripe running down the length of the horse’s back. Sometimes, you may see a transverse
stripe across the withers as well as horizontal stripes on the legs. The dun coloration is considered the closest thing
to a natural “wild” color in the horse.
R
ed duns are a type of dun with a reddish tint to their coats. They have a dark stripe running down the back and have a 
reddish or flaxen (blond) mane and tail. The horse in this photo is a classic red dun. He also has some roan characteristics.

hestnut-colored horses have a distinct reddish color on their bodies and usually have the same color in the mane 
and tail. Chestnut colorations come in a variety of shades, from dark to light. A light chestnut horse is shown here.
Chestnut horses can be a dark reddish color, as in this classic liver chestnut.

T
he body color of a sorrel horse is light red. Sorrels are sometimes hard to distinguish from chestnuts. The main dif-
ference between the two is that sorrels usually have more of a yellow tint to their coats than chestnuts do. Sorrels
tend to have a mane and tail color that matches the body color, although sorrel horses sometimes have flaxen manes
and tails.
B
ay horses have bodies that are anywhere from dark tan to reddish brown. Their manes and tails are always black, 
and they often have black on the lower parts of their legs.

H
orses described as brown have a brown or light black body coloration with a lighter color around the muzzle, flank, 
and inside upper legs. The mane and tail are always black.
T
he bodies of red roans are covered with a uniform mixture of white hairs mixed with red hairs. The head and lower
legs are usually darker than the rest of the body because these areas have a proliferation of red hairs. The manes
and tails of red roans can be black, red, or flaxen.

lue roans have a uniform mixture of white hairs mixed with black hairs, which gives the body a bluish appearance —
hence the name. The heads and lower legs of blue roans are usually darker than the bodies. The mane and tail are

or a horse to be considered a true black, his body color must be a solid black with no light areas anywhere on his
body. The mane and tail are black as well.

T
he Appaloosa’s most distinguishing characteristic is its spotted coat. Represented in several different patterns, including
the popular leopard (shown) and blanket with spots (a dark body color with white over the rump, which is covered with
dark spots), this characteristic sets the breed apart. Other physical traits include white sclera in the eye, striped hooves, and
mottled skin. Some Appaloosas also have thin manes and tails. The height range for an Appaloosa is 14.3 to 16 hands.
A
rabians are known for their elegant and graceful beauty. The head of the Arabian is small and has a concave, or dished, 
face. The Arabian’s ears are small and curve inward, and its neck is long and arched. Most Arabians have only five spinal
vertebrae, as opposed to the six vertebrae typically found in most other breeds. This one less vertebra gives Arabians a
shorter back than a lot of other breeds. Arabians are small horses that rarely measure much over 15 hands in height.

M
iniature horses are the dwarfs of the equine world and number one in the “adorable” category. The Miniature
horse has all the physical and psychological characteristics of a regular horse in a very small package. The Miniature
horse, which stands anywhere from 6 to 7 hands high, is kept primarily as a pet. Tiny tots can ride Miniature horses,
but anyone over the age of four years old is probably too big to ride a Miniature horse.
M
organs have small, elegant heads and strong, highly arched necks. They also have very deep chests, giving them con-
siderable endurance. Just like their founding sire, Justin Morgan, Morgans tend to be smaller horses and rarely reach
more than 15.2 hands in height. They are eager to please and willing to do whatever is asked of them.

P
aint Horse coats come in a variety of different patterns, most of which fall under the heading of tobiano (a white base
with dark patches) or overo (a dark base with white patches, shown). The breed’s conformation is identical to that of
the Quarter Horse, with a height range of 15 to 16 hands. Its temperament is very much like the Quarter Horse’s, too:
mellow, easygoing, and eager to please. (The Paint Horse in this photo is a yearling.)
T
he Quarter Horse is a sturdy horse with a small head and a muscular neck. The breed’s hindquarters are powerful, and
the legs are straight and solid. Quarter Horses have a big height range, standing anywhere from 14.3 to 16 hands tall.
One of the Quarter Horse’s most outstanding features is its disposition. Its quiet temperament is a big reason behind
the Quarter Horse’s huge popularity.

T
he Saddlebred is a gaited horse, capable of performing a rack and a stepping pace in addition to an animated
walk, trot, and canter. Saddlebreds typically have long, arched necks and fine heads that they carry rather high.
The Saddlebred’s body is rather lithe and lean, almost like that of a human ballet dancer. Saddlebreds range in height
from 15 to 17 hands.
S
tandardbreds have an inborn ability to move at great speeds without galloping. Some members of the breed are
natural-born trotters and can trot at nearly 30 mph. Others are born pacers (where the legs on one side move in
unison) and can attain these same speeds. Standardbreds can also gallop. The Standardbred is closely related to the
Thoroughbred, although the Standardbred is considerably heavier in muscle. Standardbreds have rather large heads
and powerful thighs. They usually measure anywhere from 15 to 16 hands.

T
he typical Thoroughbred has a straight head, high withers, and long, fine legs. Standing anywhere from 15 to 17 hands
high, Thoroughbreds have a lean, lanky appearance that sets them apart from other breeds. Thoroughbreds are willing
horses but can sometimes be too spirited for beginning riders. This depends on the individual horse, however. Some
Thoroughbreds do make good mounts for beginners.

he Tennessee Walking
Horse is a gaited
horse and can perform, 
in addition to the walk,
trot, and canter, a four-
beat running walk for
which it is famous. A
Tennessee Walking Horse
has a straight head with
larger-than-usual ears.
The breed has a gracefully
arched neck, prominent
withers, and large hooves.
Ranging in height from 
15 to 16 hands, Tennessee

T
he Andalusian horse, also known as the Pure Spanish Horse, is one of the most spectacular studies in horse
flesh on the planet. You see this horse in museum pieces and paintings from the Middle Ages. Leonardo da
Vinci sculpted this horse, and the winged Pegasus was based on this breed. Andalusians’ necks are heavy and
arched; their manes and tails are long and wavy. The breed is between 14.3 and 15 hands in height. With a
regalness about them that is hard to equal, even a relatively untrained eye can easily spot this breed.
T
he Belgian is an old European draft breed that’s gaining popularity in the United States. American Belgians, such as the one in
this photo, are slightly larger and heavier than their European counterparts. American Belgians are around 18 hands in height
and are usually sorrel with a flaxen mane and tail. Most Belgians are used for pulling, although some are also ridden.

T
he result of Trakehner, Gelderland, and Thoroughbred crossings, the Dutch Warmblood was developed to be
the consummate performance horse. Standing 16 to 17 hands high, Dutch Warmbloods are especially known
for their skills in jumping, dressage, and carriage driving.
D
eveloped in Peru in the
1800s to carry plantation
owners across vast areas of
land, the Peruvian Paso 
possesses three gaits: the 
paso llano, the sobreandando,
and the huachano. Each of
these gaits is designed to be
comfortable while covering
considerable ground. Peruvian
Pasos that are in top condition
can maintain these gaits for
hours on end. Peruvian Pasos
are small to medium in size,
measuring 14.1 to 15.1 hands in
height. They have well-muscled
necks and long, thick manes
and tails.

R
acking Horses have a
graceful build, with a long,
sloping neck. Their legs are
smooth, and their hair is
finely textured. The typical
Racking Horse averages
around 15.2 hands. What
makes the Racking Horse 
so special is that it’s a gaited
breed, able to perform a
four-beat racking gait in
addition to a walk and a 
canter. Racking Horses are
willing to work and eager 
to please their handlers.
W
elsh Ponies come in four different types: the Welsh Mountain Pony, the Welsh Pony, the Welsh Pony of Cob Type, and the
Welsh Cob. Each of these four names represents different heights and conformation types within the Welsh breed. It’s easiest
to think of each type in terms of its height: The Welsh Mountain is 12.2 hands or shorter; the Welsh Pony is 12.2 to 13.2 hands
high; the Welsh Pony of Cob Type is 13.2 hands high or less; and the Welsh Cob is actually horse-sized at 14 to 15.1 hands tall.
